You may have gotten the unsolicited texts, LinkedIn messages or other
offers from scammers posing as recruiters. The may even have a
legitimate-looking listing on a job hiring site. You have a virtual
interview, then the recruiter starts asking for personal information
like your Social Security number to fill out “employment paperwork” —
but actually they’re stealing your identity. Plus, examining the Sahm
Rule and use of the U.S. dollar in Lebanon.

the next version of OSNews</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-08, from: OS News</p>
<p>Despite being live since 1997, OSNews has had fairly few redesigns in
the grand scheme of things. If my memory serves me correctly, we’ve had
a grand total of 6 designs, and we’re currently on version 6, introduced
about 5 years ago because of unpleasant reasons. It’s now 2024, and for
a variety of reasons, we’re looking to work towards version 7 of our
almost 30 year old website, and we need help. I have a very clear idea
of what I want OSNews 7 to be like – including mockups. The general
goals are making the site visually simpler, reducing our dependency on
WordPress extensions, and reducing the complexity of our theme and
website elements to make it a bit easier for someone like me to change
small things without breaking anything. Oh and a dark mode that works.
Note that we’re not looking to change backends or anything like that –
WordPress will stay. If you have the WordPress, design, and developer
skills to make something like this a reality, and in the process shape
the visual identity of one of the oldest continuously running technology
news websites in the world, send me an email.</p>

“You’re an animal, Sibling Dex. You are not separate or other. You’re an
animal. And animals have no purpose. Nothing has a purpose. The world
simply is. If you want to do things that are meaningful to others, fine!
Good! So do I! But if I wanted to crawl into a cave and watch
stalagmites with Frostfrog for the remainder of my days, that would also
be both fine and good. You keep asking why your work is not enough, and
I don’t know how to answer that, because it is enough to exist in the
world and marvel at it. You don’t need to justify that, or earn it. You
are allowed to just live. That is all most animals do.”

<p>
I tend to read whatever the opposite of cozy science fiction is: angry
and worried about the world, building tension from speculative
extrapolations of what could go wrong. This, on the other hand, is
science fiction that encourages you to just <em>chill</em> for a minute.
</p>
<p>
I don’t know if I could read a lot of this, because I <em>am</em> angry
and worried about the world, and reading other peoples’ words along the
same lines is cathartic. But the message here — that you don’t need to
justify yourself, that you can just <em>be</em> — is soothing, and was
necessary for me. And it’s all done with wit and care. What a delightful
novella.

its ban on onshore wind farms just days after a new Labour government
came into power. The ban came into effect in 2015, and was part of a
planning policy that required onshore wind projects to prove local
communities did not object to new turbines. The new chancellor, Rachel
Reeves, called the rule “absurd.” The Labour Party has pledged to double
onshore wind energy by 2030 and decarbonize the power sector completely

How and when Britain goes green matters on a global scale. “Britain is

“It’s where the Industrial Revolution began in the 18th century, giving
rise to a global economy driven by coal, oil and gas and with it, the
emissions of planet-heating greenhouse gases. So the speed and scale of
Britain’s energy transition is likely to be closely watched by other

<h2 id="getting-the-most-out-of-twm-x11s-default-window-manager">Getting
the most out of TWM, X11’s default window manager</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-08, from: OS News</p>
<p>Graham’s TWM page has been around for like two decades or so and
still isn’t even remotely as old as TWM itself, and in 2021 they
published an updated version with even more information, tips, and
tricks for TWM. The Tab Window Manager finds its origins in the lat
1980s, and has been the default window manager for the X Windowing
System for a long time, now, too. Yet, few people know it exists – how
many people even know X has a default window manager? – and even fewer
people know you can actually style it, too. OK, so TWM is fairly easy to
configure but alot of people, upon seeing the default config, scream
‘Ugh, thats awful!’ and head off to the ports tree or their distro
sources in search of the latest and greatest uber desktop environment.
There are some hardcore TWM fans and mimimalists however who stick
around and get to liking the basic feel of TWM. Then they start to mod
it and create their own custom dekstop. All part of the fun in Unix :).
↫ Graham’s TWM page I’ll admit I have never used TWM properly, and
didn’t know it could be themed at all. I feel very compelled to spend
some time with it now, because I’ve always liked the by-now classic
design where the right-click desktop menu serves as the central location
for all your interactions with the system. There are quite a few more
advanced, up-to-date forks of TWM as well, but the idea of sticking to
the actual default X window manager has a certain charm. I almost am too
afraid to ask, because the answer on OSNews to these sorts of questions
is almost always “yes” – do we have any TWM users in the audience? I’m
extremely curious to find out if TWM actually has a reason to exist at
this point, or if, in 2024, it’s just junk code in the X.org source
repository, because I’m looking at some of these screenshots and I feel
a very strong urge to give it a serious go.</p>

now is that when I click to drag an icon from a lower Dolphin window to
a higher one, it brings the lower window forward, but then, when I hover
for a bit over the other window, it brings it back up. Of course, this
only works if the destination window remains at least partially visible,
which might not always be the case. For usability’s sake, there needs to
be an option to start a drag operation from one window to the next
without altering the Z-order.</p>

id="review-of-prescribed-fires-finds-gaps-in-key-areas-as-us-forest-service-looks-to-improve-safety">Review
of prescribed fires finds gaps in key areas as US Forest Service looks
to improve safety</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — Two years after the U.S. Forest Service sparked
what would become the largest and most destructive wildfire in New
Mexico’s recorded history, independent investigators say there are gaps
that need to be addressed if the agency is to be successful at using
prescribed fire as a tool to reduce risk amid climate change.  </p>
<p>The investigation by the Government Accountability Office was
requested by U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández after communities in her
district were ravaged in 2022 by the Hermit’s Peak-Calf Canyon
Fire.  </p>
<p>The congresswoman wanted to know what factors the Forest Service had
identified as contributing to the escape of prescribed fires over the
last decade and whether the agency was following through with reforms
promised after a pause and review of its prescribed burn program.  </p>
<p>The report made public Monday notes there were 43 escapes documented
between 2012 and 2021 out of 50,000 prescribed fire projects. That
included blazes in national forests in more than a dozen states, from
the California-Nevada border to Utah, New Mexico, Idaho, North Carolina
and Arkansas.  </p>
<p>With the U.S. Forest Service and other land management agencies
tapping into federal infrastructure and inflation reduction funding to
boost the number of prescribed burn operations over the next 10 years,
Leger Fernández said it’s more important than ever to ensure they are
doing it safely.  </p>
<p>The congresswoman was visiting northern New Mexico over recent days,
appreciating how things have greened up with summer rains. But the
forests are still tinder boxes, she said.  </p>
<p>“We need to address our forest, but we need to do it in a responsible
way,” she told The Associated Press. “When you play with fire, there is
no margin for error.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Forest Service ignites about 4,500 prescribed fires each year,
reducing fuels on about 1.3 million acres. It’s part of a multi-billion
dollar cleanup of forests choked with dead trees and undergrowth.  </p>
<p>There have been mixed results as federal land managers have fallen
behind on some projects and skipped over some highly at-risk communities
to work in less threatened ones, according to a 2023 AP review of data,
public records and congressional testimony.  </p>
<p>However, the Forest Service said in a response to the GAO that it is
making progress and generally agrees with the findings made public
Monday. Forest Service Chief Randy Moore wrote that his agency will
create and implement a corrective action plan to address the gaps.  </p>
<p>Moore also noted 2023 marked a record year for treatments of
hazardous fuels on forest lands and his agency was on track to offer
more training to build up crews who can specialize in prescribed burn
operations.  </p>
<p>“The agency is using every tool available to reduce wildfire risk at
a pace and scale which will make a difference within our current means,”
Moore wrote.  </p>
<p>The GAO reviewed volumes of documents over several months,
interviewed forest officials and made site visits over many months. The
investigation found the Forest Service has taken steps toward
implementing several immediate recommended changes following the
Hermit’s Peak-Calf Canyon Fire. That included developing a national
strategy for mobilizing resources for prescribed fire projects.  </p>
<p>There were dozens of other actions the agency identified as part of
its 2022 review, but the GAO found “important gaps remain” as the Forest
Service hasn’t determined the extent to which it will implement the
remaining actions, including how or when.  </p>
<p>The GAO is recommending the Forest Service develop a plan for
implementing the reforms, set goals, establish a way to measure progress
and ensure it has enough resources dedicated to day-to-day management of
the reform effort. It also pointed out that the Forest Service in agency
documents recognized the reforms will require major changes to practices
and culture.  </p>
<p>Leger Fernández said she hopes change will come quickly because
wildfires are becoming more expensive and more dangerous.  </p>
<p>“They are killer fires now. They move very fast, and people cannot
get out of the way fast enough,” she said. “And I think that kind of
massive emergency that they are will lead to faster change than you
might normally see in a large federal bureaucracy.”</p>

There are some things money can’t buy, and it seems a clean power grid
is one of them. Despite authorizing billions of dollars to subsidize
renewable energy development through the Inflation Reduction Act and the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Biden administration remains off
track to reach its target of
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2023-05/DOE%20-%20100%25%20Clean%20Electricity%20-%20Final.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>100%

still building renewable energy at only
<a href="https://energyinnovation.org/publication/reaching-90-percent-clean-electricity-in-the-us-by-2035/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>half
the rate that is needed</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Among the barriers holding up clean energy deployment, local opposition
looms large. As developers seek out new sites on which to build wind and
solar, they are repeatedly
<a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/23022024/community-opposition-and-grid-challenges-slow-pace-of-renewable-efforts/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>finding
themselves at odds</u></a> with neighbors who object to their projects
on aesthetic, economic, or political grounds. Whether through
<a href="https://scholarship.law.columbia.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1201&context=sabin_climate_change" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>formal
laws</u></a> or protracted permitting processes, these objections have
begun to have a noticeable effect on the pace of renewable energy
adoption. In a
<a href="https://emp.lbl.gov/news/larg-e-scale-wind-and-solar" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>recent
survey</u></a> by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, wind and
solar developers reported seeing roughly a third of their siting
applications canceled over the five years prior, with two of the most
common reasons being “community opposition” and “local ordinances or
zoning.”
</p>
<p>
But what if the solution to this impasse has been hiding in plain sight
— or more accurately, behind a chain link fence?
</p>
<p>
The U.S. has around
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1364032113006199#:~:text=It%20is%20estimated%20that%20about,7.3%20TWh%20from%20landfill%20gas." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>270
million acres</u></a> of so-called “marginal land,” a designation that
includes retired mines, closed landfills, former industrial facilities,
brownfield sites, and depleted or unproductive farmland. That’s around
twice the land area that would be required for a
renewables-and-nuclear-only power grid, the most land-intensive net-zero
scenario
<a href="https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy22osti/81644.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>modeled
by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory</u></a>. These neglected
properties are more than just an eyesore for neighbors — they also
represent wasted prospects for economic development, and in many cases
pose a contamination risk to the local environment. To law professors
<a href="https://michigan.law.umich.edu/faculty-and-scholarship/our-faculty/alexandra-klass" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Alexandra
Klass</u></a> and
<a href="https://iee.psu.edu/people/hannah-wiseman" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Hannah
Wiseman</u></a>, however, they are an opportunity in disguise.
</p>
<p>
In their
<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4747870" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>new
paper</u></a>, forthcoming in the <em><em>Minnesota Law
Review</em></em>, Klass and Wiseman (of the University of Michigan and
Penn State, respectively) propose directing the bulk of new clean energy
development to these marginal lands. It’s a concept they call
“repurposed energy,” and it offers a way to, in one fell swoop, avert
local objections, reclaim unproductive land, and create new
opportunities for economically dislocated communities.
</p>
<p>
It’s not a new concept — since 2008, the Environmental Protection
Agency’s
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/re-powering" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>RE-Powering
America’s Land Initiative</u></a> has offered funding to developers
looking to build renewable energy on potentially contaminated land.
</p>
<p>
What the new paper proposes, however, is a greater convergence of public
benefits on this specific subset of projects, which Klass views as a
down payment on societal acceptance. “If you can come up with a project
that’s going to have community support, that means you can actually
build it,” she told me. “And that’s worth paying a little extra money up
front.”
</p>
<p>
Consider some of the most common objections to renewable energy siting:
that it
<a href="https://whyy.org/articles/offshore-wind-critics-say-farms-will-damage-shore-economies-and-ruin-ocean-views/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ruins
the view</u></a>,
<a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/sports/outdoors/2024/03/02/wisconsin-prairie-chickens-threatened-by-proposed-solar-farm-along-buena-vista-state-wildlife-area/72803144007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>disrupts
habitats</u></a>, or
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/solar-capacity-grows-some-americas-most-productive-farmland-is-risk-2024-04-27/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>occupies
valuable farmland</u></a>. Each would seem to carry less weight when
applied to, say, an abandoned mine instead of a pristine coastline.
Throw in low purchase prices, pre-existing transmission lines at retired
coal or gas power plants, and the chance to direct jobs and revenue to
low-income communities (where contaminated properties are
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/ej-research/epa-research-environmental-justice-and-contaminated-sites#:~:text=Low%2Dincome%2C%20tribal%2C%20indigenous,increased%20exposures%20to%20environmental%20hazards." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>disproportionately
located</u></a>), and you’ve got, in theory, an attractive site for a
solar or wind farm.
</p>
<p>
In spite of these upsides, practical examples of repurposed energy
remain few and far between. Only 0.7% of the renewable energy capacity
installed in the United States since 1997 has been on reclaimed land,
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/re-powering" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>according
to EPA data</u></a>. That’s because, faced with the possibility of
extravagant cleanup costs and liability for prior contamination, most
developers prefer to take their chances with a greenfield.
</p>
<p>
Klass and Wiseman propose a set of policy changes that could, they hope,
spur a renewable energy renaissance on marginal lands. First, there are
some existing incentives for repurposed energy they propose expanding.
Certain state funding programs – like Massachusetts’ SMART Program – and
streamlined permitting processes – like New York’s Build-Ready Program –
could offer a template for other states seeking to accelerate
redevelopment of their own brownfields. Layering more such benefits on
top of federal funding opportunities like the IRA’s Energy
Infrastructure and Reinvestment Program, they contend, could help
stimulate broader interest from developers.
</p>
<p>
Second, they offer a set of new, more ambitious reforms to entice clean
energy companies onto marginal lands. Among them:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Giving the Department of Energy direct permitting authority over
repurposed energy would require an act of Congress, but could accelerate
approvals. Klass and Wiseman point out that many sites containing
hazardous chemicals may already be in the federal regulatory sphere.
</li>
<li>
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission could direct regional
transmission organizations to grant repurposed energy projects priority
in interconnection queues, bypassing a lengthy part of the development
timeline.
</li>
<li>
State offices that oversee brownfield cleanup and development could
establish separate divisions for repurposed energy, better equipping
them to deal with and resolve clean energy developers’ unique needs.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Klass sees the paper as a timely contribution at a critical juncture for
the renewable energy industry. “We’re at an important moment in time
where there’s a lot of federal funding available,” she told me. “But we
are not on track to build the amount of clean energy we need to meet our
targets.” By focusing support on repurposed energy, she thinks
policymakers may be able to erode some of the sociopolitical barriers
holding back the industry.
</p>
<p>
There is evidence to support this belief. A
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214629620304485" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>2021
study</u></a> found that objections to wind farms tended to fade when
the infrastructure was sited in areas with fewer lakes, hills, or other
features of aesthetic or recreational value, suggesting that plants
sited on already-disturbed land might indeed arouse less opposition.
“You start with these types of projects that we hope will engender less
community opposition and provide more community benefits,” Klass said.
“Maybe you scale it up later, maybe you don’t. But it allows a pathway
through some of this local opposition.”
</p>
<p>
It’s a view that resonates in the industry, although that doesn’t make
this kind of development easy. Jonathan Mancini is the senior vice
president of solar project development at
<a href="https://www.ameresco.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Ameresco</u></a>,
which has built solar on around 20 landfills across the United States.
He told me that sites with soil contamination are capped with an
impermeable barrier to prevent the hazardous material from spreading,
and building a solar farm on top requires using bespoke racking systems
that won’t penetrate that cap. On top of that, would-be developers have
to employ third-party engineers to monitor the cap’s integrity and
undergo additional reviews by state regulators to ensure that the weight
of the solar system will not damage it. “Currently, the permitting
timeline for such projects takes up to three years to complete,” he told
me.
</p>
<p>
Dedicated state support in places like Massachusetts, Illinois, and
Maryland has helped Ameresco alleviate some of the costs. “Utility
programs or state administered programs do incentivize the use of these
types of projects,” Mancini said. But he noted that more support would
be helpful to overcome the barriers repurposed energy projects face.
“Additional policy measures at the local and/or state level would make
these projects move faster through permitting and approval.”
</p>
<p>
Michael Gerrard, the founder of Columbia University’s Sabin Center for
Climate Change Law and one of the country’s foremost environmental
lawyers, thinks the idea could accelerate clean energy deployment.
“Local opposition is one of the most important impediments [to renewable
energy],” he pointed out to me. By undercutting aesthetic and land use
concerns, repurposed energy could “have a very positive impact finding
ways to reduce that,” he said.
</p>
<p>
Gerrard also noted, however, that local opposition is not the only
barrier to renewable energy development. In addition to more stringent
permitting requirements, “transmission, interest rates, supply chains,
local content restrictions, workforce shortages — all of those are
impediments,” he said. Repurposed energy is no magic bullet, he added,
but it doesn’t have to be. “We need a lot of magic buckshot,” he said,
“and this article proposes quite a few pellets.”

id="nato-chief-quickest-way-to-end-ukraine-war-is-to-lose-it-but-wont-bring-peace">NATO
chief: Quickest way to end Ukraine war is to lose it; but won’t bring
peace</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — As NATO prepares to convene on Tuesday a three-day
summit in Washington to celebrate its 75th birthday, the alliance is
reinforcing its support for Ukraine in the ongoing war with Russia.</p>
<p>During a news conference with a handful of reporters Sunday
previewing the summit, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said all
NATO members want peace, and that can be achieved if Russian President
Vladimir Putin understands he cannot win on the battlefield.</p>
<p>“The quickest way to end this war is to lose the war,” he said. “But
that that will not bring peace. That will bring occupation.”</p>
<p>Stoltenberg outlined key measures NATO would take, including the
establishment of a dedicated command in Germany, enhanced financial and
military aid, and bilateral security agreements.</p>
<p>Stoltenberg emphasized these initiatives while addressing the
complexities of Ukraine’s potential NATO membership and the alliance’s
united front against Russian aggression.</p>
<p>The precise language of the final agreement of the summit regarding
Ukraine’s NATO membership is still under negotiation, he said.</p>
<p>In April, Stoltenberg said the alliance did not expect to offer
Ukraine NATO membership during the summit, but rather a “bridge” to
membership.</p>
<p>At the summit, that “bridge” will encompass five essential
components:</p>
<p>Security assistance command: NATO is setting up a new command in
Germany, with logistical hubs in Eastern Europe, to coordinate
international security assistance for Ukraine. This will involve 700
personnel led by a three-star NATO general, according to
Stoltenberg.</p>
<p>Stoltenberg said there have been differences among allies about “the
approach or types of weapons Ukraine should be delivered.” Those
differences create bureaucratic delays, and the goal is to make delivery
faster and easier.</p>
<p>“This new command will have a very robust mandate, so there will be
no need for consensus on each and every delivery,” he said.</p>
<p>Financial pledge: Since February 2022, NATO allies have provided
around $43 billion annually in military support to Ukraine. The upcoming
summit is expected to extend this commitment for another year, laying a
foundation for future support.</p>
<p>Immediate weapon deliveries: Announcements on delivering more weapons
and ammunition, particularly air defense systems, are anticipated at the
summit to bolster Ukraine’s defense.</p>
<p>While the secretary-general did not offer specifics, a senior U.S.
official indicated that announcements can be expected from NATO allies
this week regarding the provision of F-16 aircraft to Ukraine.</p>
<p>Bilateral security agreements: Twenty NATO allies will have signed
bilateral security agreements with Ukraine by the start of the summit,
offering additional security guarantees and reinforcing collaborative
defense efforts.</p>
<p>Interoperability: Efforts are underway to align Ukrainian armed
forces with NATO standards, including a joint training center in Poland
and programs on military acquisitions and procurement.</p>
<p>Hungary won’t participate or obstruct</p>
<p>Stoltenberg addressed concerns about Hungary’s stance on Russia’s war
in Ukraine and its potential to block NATO decisions.</p>
<p>He recounted a recent visit to Budapest, where he secured an
agreement with Prime Minister Viktor Orban ensuring that Hungary will
not obstruct the proposed support measures for Ukraine.</p>
<p>Budapest will not participate in the new NATO security assistance
command for Ukraine but will fulfill its other NATO obligations and
contribute to the common budget, Stoltenberg said.</p>
<p>The secretary general highlighted NATO’s diverse engagements with
Moscow even after the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>He noted a recent conversation between U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd
Austin and the Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov, underscoring
the routine nature of such contacts.</p>
<p>Stoltenberg said NATO must function cohesively in developing new
defense strategies, emphasizing unity despite differing perspectives,
such as those represented by leaders like Orban.</p>
<p>Future relationship with the US</p>
<p>Stoltenberg is confident that the United States would continue to be
a staunch NATO ally regardless of future election outcomes, attributing
past criticisms by former president Donald Trump primarily to defense
spending issues rather than NATO itself.</p>
<p>He emphasized that any secretary-general must be able to work with
all leaders within the alliance, comparing NATO to a big family that
every now and then has arguments and disagreements.</p>
<p>Stoltenberg recounted his experience working with presidents Barak
Obama, Trump, and Joe Biden, noting that despite differing political
leadership, the U.S. has remained a steadfast and committed NATO
ally.</p>

<h2 id="us-troops-leave-niger-base-at-niamey">US troops leave Niger base
at Niamey</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Niamey, Niger — U.S. troops have completed a withdrawal from their
base in Niger’s capital of Niamey and will fully depart from Agadez in
the north before a Sept. 15 deadline set by the country’s military
rulers, both countries said Sunday.</p>
<p>Niger’s military leaders scrapped a military cooperation deal with
Washington in March, after seizing power in a July 2023 coup.</p>
<p>The United States had around 650 soldiers in Niger as part of
anti-jihadist missions in several Sahel nations of West Africa,
including a major drone base near Agadez.</p>
<p>“The defense ministry of Niger and the U.S. Defense Department
announce that the withdrawal of American forces and equipment from the
Niamey base 101 is now completed,” the two countries said in a
statement.</p>
<p>A final flight carrying U.S. troops was due to leave Niamey late
Sunday.</p>
<p>The U.S. presence had stood at around 950 troops, and 766 soldiers
have left Niger since the military ordered their departure, AFP learned
at a ceremony at the base attended by Niger’s army chief of staff Maman
Sani Kiaou and US General Kenneth Ekman.</p>
<p>“American forces are now going to focus on quitting airbase 201 in
Agadez,” the statement said, insisting that the withdrawal would be
completed by September 15 as planned.</p>
<p>Niger had already ordered the withdrawal of troops from France, the
former colonial power and traditional security ally, and has
strengthened ties with Russia which has provided instructors and
equipment.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Germany’s defense ministry also said it would end
operations at its airbase in Niger by August 31 following the breakdown
of talks with military leaders.</p>
<p>A similar shift has taken place in neighboring Mali and Burkina Faso,
which are also ruled by military leaders and faced with violence from
jihadist groups.</p>

Orleans Essence Festival wraps up 4-day celebration of Black
culture</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New Orleans, Louisiana — For 30 years, the Essence Festival of
Culture has brought together people from all walks of life and from
around the world to connect through conversation, shared experiences
and, of course, music.</p>
<p>The nation’s largest annual celebration of Black culture was set to
end Sunday with musical performances by Janet Jackson and a special
tribute to Frankie Beverly &amp; Maze, the soul band that closed the
event for the festival’s first 15 years. Beverly, now 77, has said he is
stepping away from performing live, and the group has been on a farewell
tour.</p>
<p>Others scheduled to perform included Victoria Monet, Teedra Moses,
Tank and the Bangas, Dawn Richard, SWV, Jagged Edge, Bilal and Anthony
Hamilton.</p>
<p>Barkue Tubman-Zawolo, chief of staff, talent and diasporic engagement
for Essence Ventures, told The Associated Press the festival helps
connect the global Black community.</p>
<p>“Historically, as Black people, sometimes we’re not sure where our
heritage comes from,” Tubman-Zawolo said. “America is just one place.
But within America there’s a melting pot of different Black cultures:
Africa, Latin, Europe, the Caribbean. Understanding that allows our
power to be even greater.”</p>
<p>Tubman-Zawolo said those connections could be seen throughout this
year’s Film Festival, held at the city’s convention center, where fans
heard from storytellers from Nigeria, Ghana and the Caribbean “who are
targeting our stories about us, for us, globally.”</p>
<p>She noted similar connections through the Food and Wine stage, where
discussions highlighted Caribbean and African cuisine; the Soko Market
Place, where vendors from all over the world shared their craft; and on
the Caesars Superdome stage, which spotlighted Caribbean and African
artists including Machel Montano of Trinidad and Ayra Starr of
Nigeria.</p>
<p>“All of that occurred over four days,” Tubman-Zawolo said. “But the
beauty of it is, it doesn’t stay here. (Fans) take it with them.”</p>
<p>New Orleans Mayor Latoya Cantrell said this year’s “We Love Us” theme
was appropriate.</p>
<p>“This whole ‘We Love Us’ theme brought us together to build
communities,” she said.</p>
<p>The festival’s impact on the city and state has surpassed $300
million, with more than 500,000 people visiting since 1994.</p>
<p>Essence started the festival as a way to celebrate 25 years of the
magazine’s history.</p>
<p>“The locals are being incorporated in a manner that we can see and
touch and feel and smell. That has been a part of the evolution of
Essence,” Cantrell said.</p>
<p>The event’s current contract ends in 2026, but Essence Ventures CEO
Caroline Wanga has said the festival’s “forever home” is New
Orleans.</p>
<p>“That’s what we believe as well,” Cantrell said. “We have a
foundation that’s been laid over 30 years. The city is always ready and
prepared to host this event and more. I think staying in New Orleans is
the best fit and best marriage, the best partnership.”</p>

envoy expresses regret over alleged military sex crimes in Okinawa</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Tokyo — U.S. Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel expressed regret
Saturday for the handling of two cases of sexual assaults allegedly
committed by American military personnel on Okinawa, which have again
stoked resentment of the heavy U.S. troop presence on the strategic
island in Japan’s far southwest.</p>
<p>The issue broke out late last month, triggering an uproar over
reports that two American service members had been charged with sexual
assaults months earlier.</p>
<p>Both cases were first reported in local media in late June. In one
arrest made in March, a member of the U.S. Air Force was charged with
the kidnapping and sexual assault of a teenager, and while in May a U.S.
Marine was arrested on charges of attempted rape resulting in injury.
Further details about the alleged victims were not released.</p>
<p>Okinawa police said they did not announce the cases out of privacy
considerations related to the victims. The Foreign Ministry, per police
decision, also did not notify Okinawa prefectural officials.</p>
<p>The cases are a reminder to many Okinawans of the 1995 rape of a
12-year-old girl by three U.S. service members, which sparked massive
protests of the U.S. presence. It led to a 1996 agreement between Tokyo
and Washington to close a key U.S. air base, although the plan has been
repeatedly delayed due to protests at the site designated for its
replacement on another part of the island.</p>
<p>Emanuel said he deeply regretted what happened to the individuals,
their families and their community, but fell short of apologizing.
“Obviously, you got to let the criminal justice process play out. But
that doesn’t mean you don’t express on a human level your sense of
regret.”</p>
<p>“We have to do better,” he said, adding that the U.S. military’s high
standards and protocols for education and training of its troops was
“just not working.”</p>
<p>Emanuel said the U.S. may be able to propose measures to improve
training and transparency with the public at U.S.-Japan foreign and
defense ministers’ security talks expected later this month in
Tokyo.</p>
<p>On Friday, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said the
Japanese authorities would do their utmost to provide more prompt
disclosures of alleged crime related to U.S. military personnel on
Okinawa while protecting victims’ privacy.</p>
<p>The cases could be a setback for the defense relationship at a time
when Okinawa is seen increasingly important in the face of rising
tensions with China.</p>
<p>Some 50,000 U.S. troops are deployed in Japan under a bilateral
security pact, about half of them on Okinawa, where residents have long
complained about heavy U.S. troop presence and related accidents, crime
and noise.</p>
<p>Emanuel commented on the issue while visiting Fukushima, on Japan’s
northeast coast.</p>
<p>Earlier Saturday, the ambassador visited the nearby town of
Minamisoma to join junior surfers and sample locally-caught flounder for
lunch, aiming to highlight the safety of the area’s seawater and seafood
amid ongoing discharges of treated and diluted radioactive water from
the tsunami-ruined Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.</p>
<p>China has banned Japanese seafood over the discharges, a move Emanuel
criticized as unjustified.</p>

id="despicable-me-4-debuts-raking-in-122.6-million-since-opening-wednesday">‘Despicable
Me 4’ debuts, raking in $122.6 million since opening Wednesday</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — After a historically bad first half of the year, the box
office is suddenly booming.</p>
<p>“Despicable Me 4,” the Illumination Animation sequel, led the way
over the holiday weekend with $75 million in ticket sales Friday through
Sunday and $122.6 million since opening Wednesday, according to studio
estimates Sunday.</p>
<p>The Independence Day holiday weekend haul for the Universal Pictures’
release further extends the considerable box-office reign of the
Minions, arguably the most bankable force in movies today. And it also
kept a summer streak going for Hollywood.</p>
<p>Though overall ticket sales were down more than 40% from levels prior
to the COVID 19 pandemic, heading into the summer moviegoing season,
theaters have lately seen a succession of hits. After Sony’s “Bad Boys:
Ride or Die” outperformed expectations, Pixar’s “Inside Out 2” rapidly
cleared $1 billion in ticket sales worldwide, making it the first
release since “Barbie” to reach that mark. Last weekend, the Paramount
prequel “A Quiet Place: Day One” also came in above expectations.</p>
<p>With “Deadpool &amp; Wolverine” tracking for a $160 million launch
later this month, Hollywood’s summer is looking up.</p>
<p>“If you look at the mood of the industry about eight weeks ago, very
different than today,” says Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for
Comscore. “The song says what a difference a day makes. What a
difference a month has made.”</p>
<p>It helps to have the Minions at your disposal. Since first debuting
in the 2010 original “Despicable Me,” each entry of the franchise —
including two sequels and two “Minions” spinoffs — has seemingly
guaranteed to gross around $1 billion. The four previous movies all made
between $939 million (2022’s “Minions: Rise of Gru”) and $1.26 billion
(2015’s “Minions”) globally.</p>
<p>That run has helped give Illumination founder and chief executive
Chris Meledandri one of the most enviable track records in Hollywood.
“Despicable Me 4,” directed by Chris Renaud and Patrick Delage, returns
the voice cast led by Steve Carell and Kristen Wiig and doubles down on
more Minion mayhem. Reviews (54% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) weren’t
particularly good for the latest installment, which includes a witness
protection plot and a group of Minions transformed into a superhero
squadron. But in their 12-year run, little has slowed down the
Minions.</p>
<p>“This is one of the most beloved franchises, quite frankly, in the
history of film, and certainly animation,” said Jim Orr, distribution
chief for Universal. “Chris Meledandri and Illumination have their
finger on the pulse of what families and audiences around the world want
to see.”</p>
<p>Family movies are powering the box office. “Despicable Me 4”
performed strongly despite the still considerable drawing power of
“Inside Out 2.” In its fourth weekend of release, the Pixar sequel added
another $30 million domestically and $78.3 million overseas.</p>
<p>“Inside Out 2,” with $1.22 billion in ticket sales thus far, is
easily the year’s biggest hit and fast climbing up the all-time ranks
for animated releases. It currently ranks as the No. 5 animated release
worldwide.</p>
<p>Instead of cannibalizing the opening weekend for “Despicable Me 4,”
“Inside Out 2” may have helped get families back in the habit of heading
to theaters.</p>
<p>“What happened, I think, is the release calendar finally settled into
a nice rhythm,” said Dergarabedian, referencing the jumbled movie
schedule from last year’s strikes. “It’s all about momentum.”</p>
<p>The continued strong sales for “Inside Out 2” were enough to put the
film in second place for the domestic weekend. Last week’s top new film,
“A Quiet Place: Day One,” slid to third with $21 million in its second
weekend, with another $21.1 million from overseas theaters. That was a
steep decrease of 60%, though the Paramount prequel has amassed $178.2
million worldwide in two weeks.</p>
<p>The run of hits has caused some studios to boost their forecasts for
the summer movie season. Heading into the most lucrative season at
theaters, analysts were predicting a $3 billion summer, down from the
more typical $4 billion mark. Now, closer to $3.4 billion appears
likely.</p>
<p>The weekend’s other top new release was Ti West’s “MaXXXine,” the
third in a string of slasher films from A24 starring Mia Goth. In 2,450
locations, “MaXXXine” collected $6.7 million in ticket sales, a
franchise best. The film, which follows “X” and “Pearl” (both released
in 2022), stars Goth as a 1980s Hollywood starlet being hunted by a
killer known as the Night Stalker.</p>
<p>Angel Studios, which last year released the unexpected summer hit
“Sound of Freedom,” struggled to find the same success with its latest
Christian film, “Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trot.” It debuted
with $3.2 million.</p>
<p>Kevin Costner’s big-budget gamble, “Horizon: An American Saga,”
didn’t do much to turn around its fortunes in its second weekend. The
first chapter in what Costner hopes will be a four-part franchise –
including a chapter two Warner Bros. will release in August – earned
$5.5 million in its second weekend. The film, which cost more than $100
million to make, has grossed $22.2 million in two weeks.</p>
<p>Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian
theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released
Monday.</p>

id="texas-coastal-residents-told-to-expect-power-outages-flooding-as-beryl-moves-closer-to-landfall">Texas
coastal residents told to expect power outages, flooding as Beryl moves
closer to landfall</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MATAGORDA, TEXAS — Beryl began lashing Texas with rain and
intensifying winds Sunday as coastal residents boarded up windows, left
beach towns under evacuation orders and prepared for the powerful storm
that has already cut a deadly path through parts of Mexico and the
Caribbean.</p>
<p>Although Beryl remained a tropical storm Sunday as it churned toward
Texas, it threatened to potentially regain hurricane strength in the
warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico before making landfall early Monday.
The storm was projected to come ashore in the middle of the Texas coast
around Matagorda Bay, an area about 161 kilometers (100 miles) south of
Houston, but officials cautioned the path could still change.</p>
<p>Texas officials warned the storm would cause power outages and
flooding but also expressed worry that not enough coastal residents and
beach vacationers in Beryl’s path were heeding warnings to leave.</p>
<p>“One of the things that kind of trigger our concern a little bit,
we’ve looked at all of the roads leaving the coast and the maps are
still green,” said Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is serving as the
state’s acting governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is traveling overseas.
“So we don’t see many people leaving.”</p>
<p>Along the Texas coast, many residents and business owners took the
typical storm precautions, but also expressed uncertainty about the
storm’s intensity.</p>
<p>In Port Lavaca, Jimmy May fastened plywood over the windows of his
electrical supply company and said he wasn’t concerned about the
possible storm surge. He recalled that his business had escaped flooding
in a previous hurricane that brought a 6-meter storm surge.</p>
<p>“In town, you know, if you’re in the low-lying areas, obviously, you
need to get out of there,” he said.</p>
<p>At the nearby marina, Percy Roberts showed his neighbor Ken Waller
how to properly secure his boat as heavy winds rolled in from the bay
Sunday evening.</p>
<p>“This is actually going to be the first hurricane I’m going to be
experiencing,” Waller said, noting that he’s a little nervous but feels
safe following Roberts’ lead. “Pray for the best but expect the worst, I
guess.”</p>
<p>Farther down the coast in Freeport, Mark Richardson, a 64-year-old
retiree, said homeowners were busy “trying to tie everything down” and
worried that Beryl had people unsure about where along the Texas coast
it would make landfall. He spent Sunday morning on the beach and said
ocean swells were quickly rising.</p>
<p>“The ocean is getting very angry, very fast,” he said.</p>
<p>The earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 hurricane in the
Atlantic, Beryl caused at least 11 deaths as it passed through the
Caribbean on its way to Texas. The storm ripped off doors, windows and
roofs with devastating winds and storm surge fueled by the Atlantic’s
record warmth.</p>
<p>Three times in its one week of life, Beryl has gained 56 kph in wind
speed in 24 hours or less, the official weather service definition of
rapid intensification.</p>
<p>Beryl’s explosive growth into an unprecedented early whopper of a
storm shows the literal hot water of the Atlantic and Caribbean, and
what the Atlantic hurricane belt can expect for the rest of the storm
season, experts said.</p>
<p>Texas officials warned people along the entire coastline to prepare
for possible flooding, heavy rain and wind. The hurricane warning
extended from Baffin Bay, south of Corpus Christi, to Sargent, south of
Houston.</p>
<p>Beryl lurked as another potential heavy rain event for Houston, where
storms in recent months have knocked out power across the nation’s
fourth-largest city and flooded neighborhoods. A flash flood watch was
in effect for a wide swath of the Texas coast, where forecasters
expected Beryl to dump as much as 25 centimeters of rain in some
areas.</p>
<p>Potential storm surges between 1.22 and 2.13 meters above ground
level were forecast around Matagorda. The warnings extended to the same
coastal areas where Hurricane Harvey came ashore in 2017 as a Category 4
hurricane, far more powerful than Beryl’s expected intensity by the time
the storm reaches landfall.</p>
<p>Those looking to catch a flight out of the area could find that
option all but impossible as Beryl closed in. Hundreds of flights from
Houston’s two major commercial airports had been delayed by midafternoon
Sunday and dozens more canceled, according to FlightAware data.</p>
<p>In Corpus Christi, officials asked visitors to cut their trips short
and return home early if possible. Residents were advised to secure
homes by boarding up windows if necessary and using sandbags to guard
against possible flooding.</p>
<p>The White House said Sunday that the Federal Emergency Management
Agency had sent emergency responders, search-and-rescue teams, bottled
water, and other resources along the coast.</p>
<p>Several coastal counties called for voluntary evacuations in
low-lying areas that are prone to flooding. Local officials also banned
beach camping and urged tourists traveling on the Fourth of July holiday
weekend to move recreational vehicles from coastal parks.</p>
<p>Beryl earlier this week battered Mexico as a Category 2 hurricane,
toppling trees but causing no injuries or deaths before weakening to a
tropical storm as it moved across the Yucatan Peninsula.</p>
<p>Before hitting Mexico, Beryl wrought destruction in Jamaica,
St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and Barbados. Three people were reported
dead in Grenada, three in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, three in
Venezuela and two in Jamaica.</p>
<p>Beryl would be the 10th hurricane to hit Texas in July since 1851 and
the fourth in the last 25 years, according to Colorado State University
hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach.</p>

Alaska tourist spot will vote whether to ban cruise ships on Saturdays
to give locals a break</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>JUNEAU, Alaska — Each year, a crush of tourists arrives in Alaska’s
capital city on cruise ships to see wonders like the fast-diminishing
Mendenhall Glacier. Now, long-simmering tensions over Juneau’s tourism
boom are coming to a head over a new voter initiative aimed at giving
residents a respite from the influx.</p>
<p>A measure that would ban cruise ships with 250 or more passengers
from docking in Juneau on Saturdays qualified for the Oct. 1 municipal
ballot, setting the stage for a debate about how much tourism is too
much in a city that is experiencing first-hand the impacts of climate
change. The measure would also ban ships on July 4, a day when locals
flock to a downtown parade.</p>
<p>The “ship-free Saturdays” initiative that qualified last week will go
to voters unless the local Assembly enacts a similar measure by Aug. 15,
which is seen as unlikely.</p>
<p>Juneau, accessible only by water or air, is home to the Mendenhall
Glacier, a major draw for the cruise passengers who arrive on
multi-story ships towering over parts of the modest downtown skyline.
Many residents of this city of about 32,000 have concerns about
increased traffic, congested trails and the frequent buzz of
sight-seeing helicopters transporting visitors to the Mendenhall and
other glaciers.</p>
<p>Deborah Craig, who has lived in Juneau for decades, supports
ship-free Saturdays. Craig, who lives across the channel from where the
ships dock, often hears their early-morning fog horns and broadcast
announcements made to passengers that are audible across the water.</p>
<p>The current “overwhelming” number of visitors diminishes what
residents love so much about Juneau, she said.</p>
<p>“It’s about preserving the lifestyle that keeps us in Juneau, which
is about clean air, clean water, pristine environment and easy access to
trails, easy access to water sports and nature,” she said of the
initiative.</p>
<p>“There’s this perception that some people are not welcoming of
tourists, and that’s not the case at all,” Craig said. “It’s about
volume. It’s about too much — too many in a short period of time
overwhelming a small community.”</p>
<p>The current cruise season runs from early April to late October.</p>
<p>Opponents of the initiative say limiting dockings will hurt local
businesses that rely heavily on tourism and could invite lawsuits. A
voter-approved limit on cruise passenger numbers in Bar Harbor, Maine,
another community with a significant tourism economy, was challenged in
federal court.</p>
<p>Laura McDonnell, a business leader who owns Caribou Crossings, a gift
shop in Juneau’s downtown tourist core, said she makes 98% of her annual
revenue during the summer season.</p>
<p>Tourism is about all the “local businesses that rely on cruise
passengers and our place in the community,” said McDonnell, who is
involved in Protect Juneau’s Future, which opposes the initiative.</p>
<p>Some schools recently closed due to factors including declining
enrollment, while the regional economy faces challenges, she said.</p>
<p>“I think that as a community, we really need to look at what’s at
stake for our economy,” she said. “We are not in a position to be
shrinking our economy.”</p>
<p>The cruise industry accounted for $375 million in direct spending in
Juneau in 2023, most of that attributable to spending by passengers,
according to a report prepared for the city by McKinley Research Group
LLC.</p>
<p>After a two-year pandemic lull, cruise passenger numbers rose sharply
in Juneau, hitting a record of more than 1.6 million in 2023. Under this
year’s schedule, Sept. 21 will be the first day since early May with no
large ships in town.</p>
<p>The tourism debate is polarizing, and the city has been trying to
find a middle ground, said Alexandra Pierce, Juneau’s visitor industry
director. But she noted there also needs to be a regional solution.</p>
<p>If the Juneau initiative passes, it will impact other, smaller
communities in southeast Alaska because the ships, generally on trips
originating in Seattle or Vancouver, Canada, will have to go somewhere
if they can’t dock in Juneau on Saturdays, she said.</p>
<p>Some residents in Sitka, south of Juneau, are in the early stages of
trying to limit cruise visitation to that small, island community, which
is near a volcano.</p>
<p>Juneau and major cruise lines, including Carnival Corp., Disney
Cruise Line, Norwegian Cruise Line and Royal Caribbean Group, agreed to
a limit of five large ships a day, which took effect this year. They
more recently signed a pact, set to take effect in 2026, seeking a daily
limit of 16,000 cruise passengers Sundays through Fridays and 12,000 on
Saturdays.</p>
<p>Pierce said the overall goal is to keep total cruise passenger
visitation around 1.6 million, and to even out daily numbers of visitors
that can spike to about 18,000 on the busiest days and feel “a bit
suffocating.” Juneau traditionally has been the most popular cruise port
in the state.</p>
<p>A number of projects around Juneau are expected to help make existing
cruise numbers feel less impactful. Those include plans for a gondola at
the city-owned ski area and increased visitor capacity at the Mendenhall
Glacier recreation area, she said.</p>
<p>Renée Limoge Reeve, vice president of government and community
relations for the trade group Cruise Lines International Association
Alaska, said the agreements signed with the city were the first of their
kind in Alaska.</p>
<p>The best strategy is “ongoing, direct dialogue with local
communities” and working together in a way that also provides a
predictable source of income for local businesses, she said.</p>
<p>Protect Juneau’s Future, led by local business leaders, said the
success of the ballot measure would mean a loss of sales tax revenue and
millions of dollars in direct spending by cruise passengers. The group
was confident voters would reject the measure, its steering committee
said in a statement.</p>
<p>Karla Hart, a sponsor of the initiative and frequent critic of the
cruise industry, said the threat of litigation has kept communities from
taking steps to limit cruise numbers in the past. She was heartened by
legal wins this year in the ongoing fight over the measure passed in Bar
Harbor, a popular destination near Maine’s Acadia National Park.</p>
<p>She believes the Juneau initiative will pass.</p>

heat bakes millions in large swaths of US, setting records and fanning
wildfires</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Las Vegas — Roughly 130 million people were under threat over the
weekend and into next week from a long-running heat wave that broke or
tied records with dangerously high temperatures and is expected to
shatter more from East Coast to West Coast, forecasters said.</p>
<p>Ukiah, north of San Francisco, hit 117 degrees Fahrenheit (47 degrees
Celsius) on Saturday, breaking the city’s record for the date and tying
its all-time high. Livermore, east of San Francisco, hit 111 F (43.8 C),
breaking the daily maximum temperature record of 109 F (42.7 C) set more
than a century ago in 1905.</p>
<p>Las Vegas tied the record of 115 F (46 C), last reached in 2007, and
Phoenix topped out at 114 F (45.5 C), just shy of the record of 116 F
(46.7 C) dating to 1942.</p>
<p>The National Weather Service said it was extending the excessive heat
warning for much of the Southwest through Friday.</p>
<p>“A dangerous and historic heatwave is just getting started across the
area, with temperatures expected to peak during the Sunday-Wednesday
timeframe,” the National Weather Service in Las Vegas said in an updated
forecast.</p>
<p>In Las Vegas, where the mercury hit 100 F (37.7 C) by 10:30 a.m.,
Marko Boscovich said the best way to beat the heat is in a seat at a
slot machine with a cold beer inside an air-conditioned casino.</p>
<p>“But you know, after it hits triple digits it’s about all the same to
me,” said Boscovich, who was visiting from Sparks, Nevada to see a Dead
&amp; Company concert Saturday night at the Sphere. “Maybe they’ll play
one of my favorites — ‘Cold Rain and Snow.’”</p>
<p>In more humid parts of the country, temperatures could spike above
100 F (about 38 C) in parts of the Pacific Northwest, the mid-Atlantic
and the Northeast, said Jacob Asherman, a weather service
meteorologist.</p>
<p>Heat records shattered across the Southwest</p>
<p>Meteorologists predicted that temperatures would be near daily
records in the region through most, if not all, of the coming week, with
lower desert highs reaching 115 to 120 degrees F (46.1 to 48.8 C).</p>
<p>Rare heat advisories were extended even into higher elevations
including around Lake Tahoe, on the border of California and Nevada,
with the National Weather Service in Reno, Nevada, warning of “major
heat risk impacts, even in the mountains.”</p>
<p>“How hot are we talking? Well, high temperatures across (western
Nevada and northeastern California) won’t get below 100 degrees (37.8 C)
until next weekend,” the service posted online. “And unfortunately,
there won’t be much relief overnight either.”</p>
<p>Indeed, Reno hit a high of 104 F (40 C) on Saturday, smashing the old
record of 101 F (38.3 C).</p>
<p>More extreme highs are in the near forecast, including 129 F (53.8 C)
for Sunday at Furnace Creek, California, in Death Valley National Park,
and then around 130 F (54.4 C) through Wednesday.</p>
<p>The hottest temperature ever officially recorded on Earth was 134 F
(56.67 C) in July 1913 in Death Valley, eastern California, though some
experts dispute that measurement and say the real record was 130 F (54.4
C), recorded there in July 2021.</p>
<p>The worst is yet to come across the West and mid-Atlantic</p>
<p>Triple-digit temperatures are likely in the West, between 15 and 30 F
(8 and 16 C) higher than average into next week, the National Weather
Service said.</p>
<p>The Eastern U.S. also was bracing for more hot temperatures.
Baltimore and others parts of Maryland were under an excessive heat
warning as heat index values could climb to 110 F (43 C), forecasters
said.</p>
<p>“Drink plenty of fluids, stay in an air-conditioned room, stay out of
the sun, and check up on relatives and neighbors,” read a National
Weather Service advisory for the Baltimore area. “Young children and
pets should never be left unattended in vehicles under any
circumstances.”</p>
<p>Deaths are starting to mount</p>
<p>In Arizona’s Maricopa County, which encompasses Phoenix, there have
been at least 13 confirmed heat-related deaths this year, along with
more than 160 other deaths suspected of being related to heat that are
still under investigation, according to a recent report.</p>
<p>That does not include the death of a 10-year-old boy last week in
Phoenix who suffered a “heat-related medical event” while hiking with
family at South Mountain Park and Preserve, according to police.</p>
<p>California wildfires fanned by low humidity, high temperatures</p>
<p>Firefighters dispatched aircraft and helicopters to drop water or
retardant on a series of wildfires in California.</p>
<p>In Santa Barbara County, northwest of Los Angeles, the Lake Fire has
scorched more than 19 square miles (49 square kilometers) of grass,
brush and timber. Firefighters said the blaze was displaying “extreme
fire behavior” and had the “potential for large growth” with high
temperatures and low humidity.</p>
<p>Festival revelers meet the heat with cold water and shade</p>
<p>At the Waterfront Blues Festival in Portland, Oregon, music fans
coped by drinking cold water, seeking shade or freshening up under water
misters. Organizers of the weekend revelries also advertised free access
to air conditioning in a nearby hotel.</p>
<p>Angelica Quiroz, 31, kept her scarf and hat wet and applied
sunscreen.</p>
<p>“Definitely a difference between the shade and the sun,” Quiroz said
Friday. “But when you’re in the sun, it feels like you’re cooking.”</p>

<h2 id="nato-to-discuss-russia-north-korea-military-cooperation">NATO to
discuss Russia-North Korea military cooperation</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The NATO summit scheduled for this week will include a
discussion among the allies about strengthening security ties with South
Korea and Japan against deepening military cooperation between Russia
and North Korea, experts said.</p>
<p>The leaders of 32 NATO members will convene in Washington July 9 to
11 to discuss ways to provide continued military support to Ukraine to
help it defend itself against Russia, which invaded more than two years
ago.</p>
<p>Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea — sometimes referred to
as the Indo-Pacific 4 or IP4 — are invited to the NATO summit. The
United States, Japan and South Korea plan to meet on the sidelines of
the summit.</p>
<p>Among the items that analysts expect NATO to discuss with Japan and
South Korea is the growing military cooperation between Russia and North
Korea.</p>
<p>“The Russian-North Korean agreement is a problem for both NATO
countries and for the countries in the Northeast Asia,” said Bruce
Bennett, a senior defense analyst at the RAND Corporation.</p>
<p>“I expect that it will be discussed at this meeting. It may become a
critical aspect of the meeting, if, by that time, intelligence is saying
that North Korea is sending many military personnel to support Russia in
Ukraine,” Bennett said.</p>
<p>After Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim
Jong Un signed a mutual defense pact in Pyongyang last month, some
speculated that North Korea could dispatch army engineers to
Russian-occupied Donetsk to rebuild the war-torn region.</p>
<p>Pentagon press secretary Major General Patrick Ryder said at a press
conference on June 25 that the U.S. is keeping an eye on a possible
dispatch of troops but warned North Korea about sending military forces,
saying they would be “cannon fodder in an illegal war against
Ukraine.”</p>
<p>North Korea on June 27 renewed its support for Russia’s war against
Ukraine, saying, “We will always be on the side of the Russian army” in
“the war of justice.”</p>
<p>Both Washington and Seoul have estimated that Pyongyang sent about
10,000 containers of munitions to Russia. Moscow and Pyongyang denied
arms exchanges between the two.</p>
<p>But in the defense pact that Putin and Kim signed last month, they
agreed to set up ways to bolster their defense capabilities and openly
announced possible military and technical cooperation.</p>
<p>“NATO members will discuss the implications of closer Russia-North
Korea relations and how best to respond, including in terms of risks and
opportunities,” said Matthew Brummer, a professor at the National
Graduate Institute for Policy Studies in Tokyo.</p>
<p>“Risks primarily include material outcomes, such as how North Korea
involvement will come to bear on warfighting in Ukraine. But there are
also opportunities to be exploited, including how to use increased North
Korea involvement to drive a wedge between China and Russia,” he
said.</p>
<p>“The reemerging axis between China, Russia and North Korea has most
certainly precipitated the security link between Europe and Asia. As a
result, I expect increased NATO involvement in East Asia, especially
with Japan, which is the world’s greatest latent military power,”
Brummer said.</p>
<p>Beijing said that it is keeping “a close eye” on the NATO summit and
that it hopes the summit does not “target any third party.”</p>
<p>Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington,
told VOA on Tuesday that “the Asia-Pacific lies beyond the geographical
scope of the North Atlantic” and that “NATO’s attempt to make eastward
inroads into the Asia-Pacific will inevitably undermine regional peace
and stability.”</p>
<p>“The countries and people in this region are on high alert against
this and firmly oppose any words or actions designed to bring military
blocs into this region and stoke division and confrontation,” he
said.</p>
<p>The U.S. State Department did not respond to an inquiry by VOA’s
Korean Service seeking a response to Beijing’s comments.</p>
<p>Luis Simon, director of the Elcano Royal Institute in Brussels,
Belgium, said he would not rule out NATO countries conducting joint
military exercises with its East Asian partners “in the Korean Peninsula
context rather than in a China context” because it offers
“diplomatically an easier entry point.”</p>
<p>At the same time, he said, “It will be more with NATO allies rather
than the NATO as a whole because NATO as a whole is very clear about
being laser focused” on defending Ukraine.</p>
<p>The Japan Air Self-Defense Force announced on June 25 that it will
hold a series of joint drills in July with Germany, Spain and France —
all NATO members.</p>
<p>David Maxwell, vice president of the Center for Asia Pacific
Strategy, also said that bilateral arrangements between South Korea and
individual NATO countries could be possible as “a number of NATO
countries are member states of the United Nations Command.”</p>
<p>The U.N. Command is a multinational military body created during the
Korean War of 1950-53 to defend against North Korean aggression.</p>
<p>Some analysts said there are limits to NATO’s involvement in the
Indo-Pacific.</p>
<p>“Most of the countries in NATO are focused on the Atlantic area, and
those who have projection capabilities” that can go beyond that “have
rather small ones,” said Barry Posen, Ford international professor of
political science at MIT.</p>
<p>William Ruger, a nonresident senior fellow at Defense Priorities,
said U.S. “capabilities, material and policy bandwidth” are not
sufficient to deal with the security of both Europe and Asia.</p>

id="sizzling-sidewalks-unshaded-playgrounds-pose-risk-of-burns">Sizzling
sidewalks, unshaded playgrounds pose risk of burns</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PHOENIX, Arizona — Ron Falk lost his right leg, had extensive skin
grafting on the left one and is still recovering a year after collapsing
on the searing asphalt outside a Phoenix convenience store where he
stopped for a cold soda during a heat wave.</p>
<p>Now using a wheelchair, the 62-year-old lost his job and his home.
He’s recovering at a medical respite center for patients with no other
place to go; there he gets physical therapy and treatment for a
bacterial infection in what remains of his right leg, which is too
swollen to use the prosthesis he’d hoped would help him walk again.</p>
<p>“If you don’t get somewhere to cool down, the heat will affect you,”
said Falk, who lost consciousness due to heat stroke. “Then you won’t
know what’s happening, like in my case.”</p>
<p>Sizzling sidewalks and unshaded playgrounds pose risks for surface
burns as air temperatures reach new summertime highs in Southwest U.S.
cities such as Phoenix, which just recorded its hottest June on record.
The average daytime high was 43 degrees Celsius (109.5 degrees
Fahrenheit), without a single 24-hour high below 37.7 Celsius (100
Fahrenheit).</p>
<p>Young children, older adults and homeless people are especially at
risk for contact burns, which can occur in seconds when skin touches a
surface of 82 C (180 F).</p>
<p>Since the beginning of June, 50 people have been hospitalized with
such burns, and four have died at Valleywise Health Medical Center in
Phoenix, which operates the Southwest’s largest burn center, serving
patients from six states, according to its director, Dr. Kevin Foster.
About 80% were injured in metro Phoenix.</p>
<p>Last year, the center admitted 136 patients for surface burns from
June through August, up from 85 during the same period in 2022, Foster
said. Fourteen died. One out of five were homeless.</p>
<p>“Last year’s record heat wave brought an alarming number of patients
with life-threatening burns,” Foster said of a 31-day period with
temperatures at or above 43 C (110 F) during Phoenix’s hottest
summer.</p>
<p>In Las Vegas, which regularly sees summertime highs in the triple
digits, 22 people were hospitalized in June alone at the University
Medical Center’s Lions Burn Care Center, said spokesperson Scott Kerbs.
That’s nearly half as many as the 46 hospitalized during all three
summer months last year.</p>
<p>As in Phoenix, the desert sun punishes Las Vegas for hours every day,
frying outdoor surfaces such as asphalt, concrete and metal doors on
cars and playground equipment such as swings and monkey bars.</p>
<p>Contact with pavement</p>
<p>Surface burn victims often include children injured walking barefoot
on concrete or touching hot surfaces, adults who collapsed on a sidewalk
while intoxicated, and older people who fell on the pavement due to heat
stroke or another medical emergency.</p>
<p>Some don’t survive.</p>
<p>Thermal injuries were among the main or contributing causes of last
year’s 645 heat-related deaths in Maricopa County, which encompasses
Phoenix.</p>
<p>One victim was an 82-year-old woman with dementia and heart disease
admitted to a suburban Phoenix hospital after being found on the
scorching pavement on an August day that hit 41.1 C (106 F).</p>
<p>With a body temperature of 40.5 C (105 F), the woman was rushed to
the hospital with second-degree burns on her back and right side,
covering 8% of her body. She died three days later.</p>
<p>Many surface burn patients also suffered potentially fatal heat
stroke.</p>
<p>Valleywise hospital’s emergency department recently adopted a new
protocol for all heat stroke victims: submerging patients in a bag of
slushy ice to quickly bring down body temperature.</p>
<p>Recovery for those with skin burns was often lengthy, with patients
undergoing multiple skin grafts and other surgeries, followed by months
of recovery in skilled nursing or rehabilitation facilities.</p>
<p>Bob Woolley, 71, suffered second- and third-degree burns to his
hands, arms, leg and torso after he stumbled onto the broiling backyard
rock garden at his Phoenix home while wearing only swim trunks and a
tank top.</p>
<p>“The ordeal was extremely painful; it was almost unbearable,” said
Woolley, who was hospitalized at the Valleywise burn center for several
months. He said he considers himself “95% recovered” after extensive
skin grafts and physical therapy and has resumed some former activities
such as swimming and motorcycle riding.  </p>
<p>Children among the burned</p>
<p>Some burn victims in Phoenix and Las Vegas were children.</p>
<p>“In many cases, this involves toddlers walking or crawling onto hot
surfaces,” Kerbs said of those hospitalized at the Las Vegas center.</p>
<p>Foster said about 20% of the hospitalized and outpatient skin-burn
victims seen at the Phoenix center are children.</p>
<p>Small children aren’t fully aware of the harm a sizzling metal door
handle or a scorching sidewalk can cause.</p>
<p>“Because they’re playing, they don’t pay attention,” said urban
climatologist Ariane Middel, an assistant professor at Arizona State
University who directs the SHaDE Lab, a research team that studies the
effects of urban heat.</p>
<p>“They may not even notice that it’s hot.”</p>
<p>In measuring surface temperatures of playground equipment, the team
found that in 37.7-degree C (100 F) weather without shade, a slide can
heat up to 71.1 C (160 F), but a covering can bring that down to 43.8 C
(111 F). A rubber ground cover can hit as high as 86.6 C (188 F), a
handrail can heat up to 48.8 C (120 F) and concrete can reach 55.5 C
(132 F).</p>
<p>Many metro Phoenix parks have covered picnic tables and plastic
fabric stretched over play equipment, keeping metal or plastic surfaces
up to 30 degrees Fahrenheit cooler. But plenty do not, Middel said.</p>
<p>She said cooler wood chips are better underfoot than rubber mats,
which were designed to protect kids from head injuries but soak up heat
in the broiling sun. Like rubber, artificial turf gets hotter than
asphalt.</p>
<p>“We need to think about alternative surface types, because most
surfaces we use for our infrastructure are heat sponges,” Middel
said.</p>
<p>Pets in danger, too</p>
<p>Hot concrete and asphalt also pose burn risks for pets.</p>
<p>Veterinarians recommend dogs wear booties to protect their paws
during outdoor walks in summer or keeping them on cooler grassy areas.
Owners are also advised to make sure their pets drink plenty of water
and don’t get overheated. Phoenix bans dogs from the city’s popular
hiking trails on days the National Weather Service issues an excessive
heat warning.</p>
<p>Recovering at Phoenix’s Circle the City, a respite care facility he
was sent to after being released from Valleywise’s burn unit, Falk said
he never imagined the Phoenix heat could cause him to collapse on the
broiling asphalt in his shorts and T-shirt.</p>
<p>Because he wasn’t carrying identification or a phone, no one knew
where he was for months. He has a long road ahead but still hopes to
regain part of his old life, working for a concessionaire for
entertainment events.</p>
<p>“I kind of went into a downward spiral,” Falk said. “I finally woke
up and said, ’Hey, wait, I lost a leg.’ But that doesn’t mean you’re
useless.”</p>

id="north-dakota-tribe-goes-back-to-its-roots-with-a-massive-greenhouse-operation">North
Dakota tribe goes back to its roots with a massive greenhouse
operation</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BISMARCK, North Dakota — A Native American tribe in North Dakota will
soon grow lettuce in a giant greenhouse complex that when fully
completed will be among the country’s largest, enabling the tribe to
grow much of its own food decades after a federal dam flooded the land
where they had cultivated corn, beans and other crops for millennia.</p>
<p>Work is ongoing on the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation’s
1.3-hectare greenhouse that will make up most of the Native Green Grow
operation’s initial phase. However, enough of the structure will be
completed this summer to start growing leafy greens and other crops such
as tomatoes and strawberries.</p>
<p>“We’re the first farmers of this land,” Tribal Chairman Mark Fox
said. “We once were part of an Aboriginal trade center for thousands and
thousands of years because we grew crops — corn, beans, squash,
watermelons — all these things at massive levels, so all the tribes
depended on us greatly as part of the Aboriginal trade system.”</p>
<p>The tribe will spend roughly $76 million on the initial phase, which
also will include a warehouse and other facilities near the tiny town of
Parshall. It plans to add to the growing space in the coming years,
eventually totaling about 5.9 hectares, which officials say would make
it one of the world’s largest facilities of its type.</p>
<p>The tribe’s fertile land along the Missouri River was inundated in
the mid-1950s when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers built the Garrison
Dam, which created Lake Sakakawea.</p>
<p>Getting fresh produce has long been a challenge in the area of
western North Dakota where the tribe is based, on the Fort Berthold
Indian Reservation. The rolling, rugged landscape — split by Lake
Sakakawea — is a long drive from the state’s biggest cities, Bismarck
and Fargo.</p>
<p>That isolation makes the greenhouses all the more important, as they
will enable the tribe to provide food to the roughly 8,300 people on the
Fort Berthold reservation and to reservations elsewhere. The tribe also
hopes to stock food banks that serve isolated and impoverished areas in
the region, and plans to export its produce.</p>
<p>Initially, the MHA Nation expects to grow nearly 907,000 kilograms of
food a year and for that to eventually increase to 5.4 million to 6.4
million kilograms annually. Fox said the operation’s first phase will
create 30 to 35 jobs.</p>
<p>The effort coincides with a national move to increase food
sovereignty among tribes.</p>
<p>Supply chain disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic led tribes
nationwide to use federal coronavirus aid to invest in food systems,
including underground greenhouses in South Dakota to feed the local
community, said Heather Dawn Thompson, director of the U.S. Department
of Agriculture’s Office of Tribal Relations. In Oklahoma, multiple
tribes are running or building their own meat processing plant, she
said.</p>
<p>The USDA promotes its Indigenous Food Sovereignty Initiative, which
“really challenges us to think about food and the way we do business at
USDA from an Indigenous, tribal lens,” Thompson said. Examples include
Indigenous seed hubs, foraging videos and guides, cooking videos and a
meat processing program for Indigenous animals.</p>
<p>“We have always been a very independent, sovereign people that have
been able to hunt, gather, grow and feed ourselves, and forces have
intervened over the last century that have disrupted those independent
food resources, and it made it very challenging. But the desire and goal
has always been there,” said Thompson, whose tribal affiliation is
Cheyenne River Sioux.</p>
<p>The MHA Nation’s greenhouse plans are possible in large part because
of access to potable water and natural gas resources.</p>
<p>The natural gas released in North Dakota’s Bakken oil field has long
been seen by critics as a waste and environmental concern, but Fox said
the tribal nation intends to capture and compress that gas to heat and
power the greenhouse and process into fertilizer.</p>
<p>Flaring, in which natural gas is burned off from pipes that emerge
from the ground, has been a longtime issue in the No. 3 oil-producing
state.</p>
<p>North Dakota Pipeline Authority Director Justin Kringstad said that
key to capturing the gas is building needed infrastructure, as the MHA
Nation intends to do.</p>
<p>“With those operators that are trying to get to that level of zero,
it’s certainly going to take more infrastructure, more buildout of
pipes, processing plants, all of the above to stay on top of this
issue,” he said.</p>
<p>The Fort Berthold Reservation had nearly 3,000 active wells in April,
when oil production totaled 203,000 barrels a day on the reservation.
Oil production has helped the MHA Nation build schools, roads, housing
and medical facilities, Fox said.</p>

<h2 id="ready-to-come-out-scientists-emerge-after-year-on-mars">‘Ready
to come out?’ Scientists emerge after year ‘on Mars’</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The NASA astronaut knocks loudly three times on what
appears to be a nondescript door and calls cheerfully: “You ready to
come out?” </p>
<p>The reply is inaudible, but beneath his mask he appears to be
grinning as he yanks the door open, and four scientists who have spent a
year away from all other human contact, simulating a mission to Mars,
spill out to cheers and applause. </p>
<p>Anca Selariu, Ross Brockwell, Nathan Jones and team leader Kelly
Haston have spent the past 378 days sealed inside the “Martian” habitat
in Houston, Texas, part of NASA’s research into what it will take to put
humans on the Red Planet.  </p>
<p>They have been growing vegetables, conducting “Marswalks,” and
operating under what NASA terms “additional stressors,” such as
communication delays with “Earth,” including their families; isolation
and confinement.  </p>
<p>It’s the kind of experience that would make anyone who lived through
pandemic lockdowns shudder, but all four were beaming as they reemerged
Saturday, their hair slightly more unruly and their emotion apparent.
 </p>
<p>“Hello. It’s actually so wonderful just to be able to say hello to
you,” Haston, a biologist, said with a laugh. </p>
<p>“I really hope I don’t cry standing up here in front of all of you,”
Jones, an emergency room doctor, said as he took to the microphone, and
nearly doing just that several moments later as he spotted his wife in
the crowd.  </p>
<p>The habitat, dubbed Mars Dune Alpha, is a 3D-printed,
160-square-meter facility, complete with bedrooms, a gym, common areas,
and a vertical farm for growing food. </p>
<p>An outdoor area, separated by an airlock, is filled with red sand and
is where the team donned suits to conduct their “Marswalks,” though it
is still covered rather than being open air. </p>
<p>“They have spent more than a year in this habitat conducting crucial
science, most of it nutrition-based and how that impacts their
performance … as we prepare to send people on to the Red Planet,” Steve
Koerner told the crowd. Koerner is the deputy director at NASA’s Johnson
Space Center. </p>
<p>“I’m very appreciative,” he added. </p>
<p>This mission is the first of a series of three planned by NASA,
grouped under the title CHAPEA — Crew Health and Performance Exploration
Analog. </p>
<p>A yearlong mission simulating life on Mars took place in 2015-2016 in
a habitat in Hawaii, and although NASA participated in it, it was not at
the helm. </p>
<p>Under its Artemis program, America plans to send humans back to the
Moon to learn how to live there long-term to help prepare a trip to
Mars, sometime towards the end of the 2030s.</p>

when good people promote policies that have the opposite effect of what
