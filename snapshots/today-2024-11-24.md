## FAQs are not the answer

date: 2024-11-30, from: Blog by Fabrizio Ferri-Benedetti

<p>Everybody loves to hate Frequently Asked Questions, or FAQs. More often than not, technical writers pale and stagger at the sight of hefty, unsorted FAQs, as if they were beholding a writhing mass of primal chaos. Others value their pragmatic qualities: FAQs, they say, lower the bar to contribution and are good fuel for LLMs and search engines. My opinion is that FAQs pose a problem only when there&rsquo;s no strategy around their usage.</p>

I wasn&#39;t clear enough yesterday. We&#39;re losing the word &quot;podcast&quot; very quickly. It&#39;s coming to mean video interviews on YouTube. Our only hope is upgrading the open platform in a way that stimulates the imagination of creators, and there&#39;s no time to waste.

</ul>

<p>Our website has a new look! The illustrated algae-eared rabbit nav helped solve the problem of navigating on mobile. We added a lot of information to this wiki over the years, creating separate portals for its evergrowing content was inevitable, we hope you like the re-design. Some of the content has shifted, and we've simplified many of the pages.</p>

<p>A couple of folks on <a href="https://merveilles.town" target="_blank">Merveilles</a> got together recently and made a Diablo Tribute tape. A limited run of physical cassettes are currently in production, but in the meantime the tribute album is available to download on <a href="https://spectralepoch.bandcamp.com/album/a-tribute-to-diablo" target="_blank">Bandcamp</a>.</p>

<p>Next month on December 6th, Devine will share the stage with Iszoloscope, Oddie(Orphx) & Creature at Foufounes Electriques in Montréal as part of <a href="https://ampindustrialevents.com/index.html" target="_blank">AMP Industrial Events</a>. Then on the 7th, we will both(remotely) present a summary of all the interesting analog communication schemes that inspired and found their way into <a href="https://100r.co/site/rabbit_waves.html">Rabbit Waves</a> and <a href="https://100r.co/site/wiktopher.html">Wiktopher</a> for <a href="https://creativecodingutrecht.nl/en/calendar/iterations-2024" target="_blank">Iterations 2024</a> organized by Creative Coding Utrecht.</p>

<p>Devine's talk for Handmade Seattle 2024 entitled A Shining Palace Built Upon the Sand was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfnEfFb8yks&t=1908s" target="_blank">released online</a>(YouTube), we also released the <a href="https://100r.co/site/shining_sand.html">written transcript</a>.</p>

<p>Due to the ongoing Canada Post strike we had to close the sale of stickers in our <a href="https://100r.co/site/store.html">store</a>, we'll let you know once we resume operations (this also applies to Patreon supporters, we'll ship perks your way as soon as we can).</p>

<p><b>Book Club:</b> This month we are still reading <i>The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes</i> by Arthur Conan Doyle.</p>

## Power User Vs. Strong POV

The just-released elementary OS 8 is interesting, but it has a problem—its impressive but prescriptive interface paradigm has to live in an ecosystem of power users. Who blinks first?

## Black Friday 2024: Mini PC deals

date: 2024-11-29, from: Liliputing

<p>Mini PCs can serve a variety of purposes. There are high-performance models that you can use as a full-fledged desktop or even gaming PC. There are fanless models that can be used as silent media players, digital signage systems, file servers, or network utilities. And there are pocket-sized models that you can easily hide behind [&#8230;]</p>

## Hack your Amazon Fire tablet with Fire Toolbox (Install Google Play, disable Amazon apps, and more)

date: 2024-11-29, from: Liliputing

<p>Amazon&#8217;s Fire tablets offer a lot of bang for the buck. With list prices starting as low as $60, they&#8217;re far cheaper than any iPad, and more affordable than most tablets from companies like Samsung, Google, or Lenovo. Amazon&#8217;s tablets also go on sale for even lower prices at least a few times a year [&#8230;]</p>

## MSI Claw 7 and 8 AI+ handheld gaming PCs with Intel Lunar Lake go up for pre-order for $800 and up

date: 2024-11-29, from: Liliputing

<p>The first MSI Claw handheld gaming PC wasn&#8217;t very well received when it launched earlier this year as the first (and only) model in the space to feature an Intel Meteor Lake processor and Intel Arc integrated graphics.

## Lenovo Legion Go S could be a cheaper handheld gaming PC

date: 2024-11-29, from: Liliputing

<p>The Lenovo Legion Go has proven to be a relatively popular handheld gaming PC since shortly after it first launched a year ago. But with list prices starting at $700, it&#8217;s not exactly the most affordable option around. So it&#8217;s unsurprising that Lenovo is not only planning a next-gen model that will bring improved performance, [&#8230;]</p>

## GHC 9.12.1-rc1 is now available

date: 2024-11-29, from: Glasgow Haskell Compiler

<h1>GHC 9.12.1-rc1 is now available</h1>
<h4 class="text-muted">Zubin Duggal - 2024-11-29</h4>

<p>The GHC developers are very pleased to announce the availability
of the release candidate for GHC 9.12.1. Binary distributions, source
distributions, and documentation are available at <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/9.12.1-rc1">downloads.haskell.org</a>.</p>
<p>We hope to have this release available via ghcup shortly.</p>
<p>GHC 9.12 will bring a number of new features and improvements, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The new language extension <a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0522-or-patterns.rst">OrPatterns</a> allowing you to combine multiple
pattern clauses into one.</p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0569-multiline-strings.rst">MultilineStrings</a> language extension to allow you to more easily write
strings spanning multiple lines in your source code.</p></li>
<li><p>Improvements to the OverloadedRecordDot extension, allowing the built-in
<code>HasField</code> class to be used for records with fields of non lifted representations.</p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0409-exportable-named-default.rst">NamedDefaults</a> language extension has been introduced allowing you to
define defaults for typeclasses other than <code>Num</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>More deterministic object code output, controlled by the <code>-fobject-determinism</code>
flag, which improves determinism of builds a lot (though does not fully do so)
at the cost of some compiler performance (1-2%). See <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/12935">#12935</a> for the details</p></li>
<li><p>GHC now accepts type syntax in expressions as part of <a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0281-visible-forall.rst">GHC Proposal <span>#281</span></a>.</p></li>
<li><p>The WASM backend now has support for TemplateHaskell.</p></li>
<li><p>… and many more</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A full accounting of changes can be found in the <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/9.12.1-rc1/docs/users_guide/9.12.1-notes.html">release notes</a>.
As always, GHC’s release status, including planned future releases, can
be found on the GHC Wiki <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/GHC-status">status</a>.</p>
<p>We would like to thank GitHub, IOG, the Zw3rk stake pool,
Well-Typed, Tweag I/O, Serokell, Equinix, SimSpace, the Haskell
Foundation, and other anonymous contributors whose on-going financial
and in-kind support has facilitated GHC maintenance and release
management over the years. Finally, this release would not have been
possible without the hundreds of open-source contributors whose work
comprise this release.</p>
<p>As always, do give this release a try and open a <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/new">ticket</a> if you see
anything amiss.</p>

## [Podcast] Your docs are your infrastructure

date: 2024-11-26, from: Blog by Fabrizio Ferri-Benedetti

<p>I recently was a guest on The Stack Overflow&rsquo;s Podcast today, talking about docs (of course), the Vale prose linter, job titles, automation, LLMs, and much more. You can listen to the entire episode here or <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2024/11/26/your-docs-are-your-infrastructure/">in the SO blog</a>, or <a href="https://the-stack-overflow-podcast.simplecast.com/episodes/your-docs-are-your-infrastructure/transcript">read the transcript</a>. Getting docs closer to developers was one of my personal goals this year, and I think these kind of appearances might help. We need to be where developers are.</p>

## Swift Vision: Improving the Approachability of Data-Race Safety

date: 2024-11-25, from: Michael Tsai

Holly Borla (via Mastodon, forum): This document lays out several potential paths for improving the usability of Swift 6, especially in simple situations where users aren&#8217;t intending to use concurrency at all. [&#8230;] A key tenet of our thinking in this vision is that we want to drastically reduce the number of explicit concurrency annotations [&#8230;]

## Why I became a Documentation Engineer (and what that even means)

date: 2024-11-24, from: Blog by Fabrizio Ferri-Benedetti

<p>A reader asked me how they’d become a Documentation Engineer, because they saw I got hired as one and felt curious about what it takes to get there. This inevitably got me thinking about job titles and the evolution of tech writing, two topics that are quite central to this blog. Let me begin with the short answer: As a tech writer you’ll have to wear many hats, but you’ll always be a technical writer. Depending on your preferences, some hats will be more comfortable than others. Docs Engineer is one of those.</p>
