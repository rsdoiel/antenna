## Congressional hearing: US should name more Americans as 'unjustly detained' in China

date: 2024-09-19, from: VOA News USA

Washington — A hearing to seek the release of imprisoned Americans in Beijing highlighted reasons for the U.S. to expand its list of U.S. citizens wrongly detained in China to prioritize their return.


Members of Congress and witnesses argued at a congressional hearing this week that the U.S. government should expand the list of Americans that it designates as being “unjustly detained” in China.


“More Americans should be considered to be unjustly detained by the State Department,” Representative Chris Smith, the chair of the Congressional Executive Commission on China, said Wednesday in opening remarks at the CECC hearing.


China is known for a justice system lacking transparency and arbitrarily detaining foreigners as well as its own citizens.


The State Department officially had three Americans listed as unjustly detained in China including American Pastor David Lin, who has now been released by Beijing, the State Department announced on Sunday. 


The other two are Kai Li and Mark Swidan. Li, a businessman from Long Island, was detained by China in 2016 and sentenced to 10 years in prison in 2018 for espionage, which his family denies. Swiden, a Texas businessman, was detained in 2012 and convicted on drug-related charges in 2019. His supporters say there is evidence he was not in China at the time of the alleged offense.


Although estimates vary, human rights organizations assess that more U.S. citizens are wrongly detained in China. 


Dui Hua, a human rights group that advocates for clemency and better treatment of detainees in China, doubts about 200 Americans who are held under coercive measures in China and more than 30 who are barred from leaving the country.


The James W. Foley Legacy Foundation, a group that seeks to free Americans held captive abroad, estimates that 11 U.S. nationals are wrongfully detained in China, including those subject to exit bans.


In the opening statement of his testimony, Nelson Wells, the father of detained American citizen Nelson Wells, Jr., lamented that “Nelson is not considered a political prisoner or held unjust” by the State Department.


Later, he added, “We tried to get Nelson’s name included” in the list and expressed his hope that the hearing will pave the way.


Nelson Wells, Jr., from New Orleans, was arrested in 2014 in China and sentenced to life on drug-related charges, which his family denies. His term was reduced to 22 years in 2019, and he will remain in prison until 2041.


The U.S. determines whether its citizens are detained “unlawfully or wrongfully” by either “a foreign government or a non-governmental actor” based on criteria set by the Levinson Act signed into law in 2020.


Such criteria “can include, but is not limited to, a review of whether the individual is being detained to influence U.S. policy, whether there is a lack of due process or disparate sentencing for the individuals, and whether the person is being detained due to their U.S. connections, among other criteria,” said a spokesperson for the State Department in a statement to VOA Korean on Tuesday.


“The Secretary of State has ultimate authority to determine whether a case is a wrongful detention. This determination is discretionary, based on the totality of the circumstances, and grounded in the facts of the case. We do not discuss the wrongful detention determination process in public,” the spokesperson continued.


A spokesperson for the Foley Foundation told VOA that it believes 11 Americans currently detained in China meet “the criteria for wrongful detention, as specified in Levinson Act.”


Its report, published in July, says China “remains the leading country in wrongfully detaining U.S. nationals,” based on the data collected by the Foley Foundation in the period from 2022 to 2024.


Sophie Richardson, a visiting scholar at Stanford University’s Center on Democracy, Development, and the Rule of Law, told VOA China’s practice of arbitrary detention is harmful to its culture and economy.


“It’s a big part of what is deterring people from going to the country,” including students who are interested in studying Chinese as well as business executives who are “concerned they might run afoul of certain kinds of data regulations and [be] arbitrarily detained,” said Richardson, a former China director at Human Rights Watch.


A record number of approximately 15,200 high-net worth individuals are expected to leave China in 2024, according to New World Wealth, a wealth intelligence firm, cited by the Henley Private Wealth Migration Report.


Harrison Li, the son of Kai Li, said, “The Chinese government clearly wants more Americans to travel to China, but as long as our loved ones are being held, as long as there are so many people at risk, then that travel warning must be escalated.”


The State Department currently advises Americans to “reconsider” traveling to the country “due to the arbitrary enforcement of local laws,” including exit bans and wrongful detention. The next level of advisory would say “do not travel.”


Bob Fu, the founder and president of China Aid, a human rights group that advocates for religious freedom, told VOA that “increasing international isolation” felt by the Chinese Communist Party could have led it to the release of David Lin.  


He said the prospect for the release of other Americans would depend on “how much persistent pressure from the highest level of the U.S. government” is exerted on Beijing.


The State Department spokesperson told VOA Korean that the U.S. has raised the case of “other wrongfully detained Americans” in addition to David Lin and will “continue to push for the release of other Americans.”

## 2024 Is Looking Like a Stellar Year for Solar Power

date: 2024-09-19, from: Heatmap News

Ember: 2024 will be another record year for solar</h3><p>The explosive growth in solar power shows no signs of stopping this year. New <a href="https://ember-climate.org/insights/in-brief/solar-power-continues-to-surge-in-2024/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--EkGIwN5bLHHAvecKAh8G9Tkc_fIh3K7nZGK7Q7tKLyy9OLPBg5y5lCVzAuvSosEEAU7dg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">analysis</a> from energy think tank Ember forecasts the world is on track to add 593 gigawatts of solar power in 2024, nearly 30% more than last year’s installations and nearly 200 GW more than the International Energy Agency predicted at the start of the year. The report underscores how a handful of countries are responsible for most of the world’s new solar capacity. China leads, followed by the U.S., India, Germany, and Brazil. These five countries are on track to account for 75% of new global installations in 2024. And they are sustaining their growth year after year.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Ember</small></p><p>Here’s the most important takeaway from the Ember report: <strong>“This now puts ambitious climate pledges within reach.”</strong> It’s very possible – and indeed likely – that the world will triple solar capacity by 2030. In this scenario, solar power would generate a quarter of the world’s electricity. “Countries need to plan ahead to make the most of the high levels of solar capacity being built today and ensure the continued build-out of capacity in the coming years,” the report says.</p><h3>2. Fed interest rate cut could boost investment in renewable projects</h3><p>The Federal Reserve announced yesterday that it would reduce the benchmark federal funds rate by half a percentage point, from just over 5% to just below. What does this mean for renewable energy? Well, it just became a much more enticing investment, <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/federal-reserve-interest-rates-energy?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--EkGIwN5bLHHAvecKAh8G9Tkc_fIh3K7nZGK7Q7tKLyy9OLPBg5y5lCVzAuvSosEEAU7dg" rel="noopener" target="_self">wrote Heatmap’s Matthew Zeitlin</a>. High interest rates have an outsize effect on renewable energy projects, because the cost of building and operating a renewable energy generator like a wind farm is highly concentrated in its construction. Wood Mackenzie estimates that a 2% increase in interest rates pushes up the cost of energy produced by a renewables project by around 20%, compared to just over 10% for conventional power plants. “As rates fall, projects become increasingly financially viable,” said Advait Arun, senior associate of energy finance at the Center for Public Enterprise and Heatmap contributor.</p><h3>3. EU official warns ‘climate breakdown’ is becoming the norm</h3><p>The European Union’s head office has warned that the extreme weather devastating parts of the continent are proof that “climate breakdown” is “fast becoming the norm,” <em><em>The Associated Press</em></em> <a href="https://apnews.com/article/eu-climate-floods-wildfires-disaster-8338ec7a0030cc8069800b0e95ed61c9?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--EkGIwN5bLHHAvecKAh8G9Tkc_fIh3K7nZGK7Q7tKLyy9OLPBg5y5lCVzAuvSosEEAU7dg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>. Parts of Europe are experiencing some of the worst flooding in at least two decades, while Portugal has declared a “state of calamity” as enormous wildfires rage out of control and threaten the homes of more than 200,000 people. “We face a Europe that is simultaneously flooding and burning. These extreme weather events ... are now an almost annual occurrence,” said EU Crisis Management Commissioner Janez Lenarcic. “The global reality of the climate breakdown has moved into the everyday lives of Europeans.” Europe is the fastest warming continent on Earth.</p><h3>4. AI weather startup Brightband emerges from stealth</h3><p><strong></strong>Today the startup Brightband emerged from stealth with $10 million in Series A funding and a unique plan to commercialize generative AI weather modeling. Instead of trying to go up against Weather.com, Brightband is tailoring models to specific industries such as insurance, finance, agriculture, energy, and transportation. The round was led by Prelude Ventures. AI models like Brightband’s are trained on decades worth of past weather data, and when fed a snapshot of current conditions, can predict what will come next, much like ChatGPT does with text.

## The Startup Making the Weather a Hot Investment

date: 2024-09-19, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzY0NTA1MC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczMDA3Nzg0OX0.JoiHcoAkeqINmMHvWqJtou86MN7XDmyEGqUC30tvjdk/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p>The weather has never been hotter.</p>
<p>The past few years have seen a boom in the weather prediction industry, with AI-based weather models from the likes of <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/graphcast-ai-model-for-faster-and-more-accurate-global-weather-forecasting/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Google DeepMind</u></a>, <a href="https://www.huaweicloud.com/intl/en-us/about/takeacloudleap2024/ai-weather-prediction.html#:~:text=Pangu%2DWeather%20can%20generate%20a,and%20heat%20waves%2C%20and%20more." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Huawei</u></a>, and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/high-performance-computing/earth-2/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Nvidia</u></a> consistently outperforming traditional models. Most of that work has been research-oriented, but today the startup Brightband emerged from stealth with $10 million in Series A funding and a unique plan to commercialize generative AI weather modeling. Instead of trying to go up against Weather.com, Brightband is tailoring models to specific industries such as insurance, finance, agriculture, energy, and transportation. The round was led by Prelude Ventures. </p>
<p>Weather forecasting has traditionally been the domain of the public sector, with the most widely used models coming from the U.S. National Weather Service and the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. Brightband’s CEO Julian Green told me that private companies haven’t been able to break in “because it has cost so much to have billion dollar supercomputers,” which are required to run today’s so-called “numerical” weather models. </p>
<p>These models rely on complex atmospheric equations based on the laws of physics to predict future weather patterns, and because of their computational intensity, are usually <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/ai-churns-out-lightning-fast-forecasts-good-weather-agencies" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>only updated four times daily</u></a>. It’s possible then that AI-based weather prediction could thus actually <em><em>reduce</em></em> energy demand — because while it takes a lot of energy to train an AI model, after that’s done, generating forecasts is simple. “So instead of six hours to have a forecast, it takes under a second. Instead of using a billion dollar supercomputer, you’re using a laptop,” Green told me. </p>
<p>AI models like Brightband’s are trained on decades worth of past weather data, and when fed a snapshot of current conditions, can predict what will come next, much like ChatGPT does with text. “Think about the weather AI prediction problem as predicting the next frame in a radar sequence,” Green told me. </p>
<p>He said that customizing forecasts for particular industries will also be as simple as querying a large language model. A wind farm operator could, for example, “just take an attached file of historical wind energy production, and throw it in there and say, <em><em>hey, tell me what the wind energy is going to be like next week</em></em>.” Likewise folks in the aviation industry could have the model tell them if their plane’s wings are likely to ice up, utilities could get detailed insight into expected energy demand and generation, and finance companies could get up-to-the-minute information about weather-sensitive commodities. Previously, companies would’ve had to build their own forecasting teams or hire third-party advisors to get such specific predictions.</p>
<p>Brightband wants to further differentiate itself from the types of models that tech companies have already built by using only raw data inputs to generate its forecasts, from sources such as satellites, weather balloons, and radar systems. Perhaps surprisingly, this is not the way that most models currently work. Because there are data gaps, such as over oceans and in the developing world, the datasets used to train today’s AI weather models, Green explained, “smear the available data over a three-dimensional grid of the globe,” diluting the accuracy of both the real-time weather and presumably the resulting forecasts. </p>
<p>It’s hard to say how much more accurate using only raw data inputs will be, because “that’s what nobody has done yet,” Green told me. Data gaps are still an issue of course, but Green told me that Brightband’s approach will also allow the company to better analyze when and where filling these gaps would add the most value. </p>
<p>Brightband says it hopes to publish a paper by year’s end with an open-source version of its forecast model, alongside evaluation tools to assess its performance.</p>

## European Commission to order Apple to take interoperability measures after company refuses to comply with DMA

date: 2024-09-19, from: OS News

The European Commission has taken the next step in forcing Apple to comply with the Digital Markets Act. The EC has started two so-called specification proceedings, in which they can more or less order Apple exactly what it needs to do to comply with the DMA &#8211; in this case covering the interoperability obligation set out in Article 6(7) of the DMA. The two proceedings entail the following: The first proceeding focuses on several iOS connectivity features and functionalities, predominantly used for and by connected devices. Connected devices are a varied, large and commercially important group of products, including smartwatches, headphones and virtual reality headsets. Companies offering these products depend on effective interoperability with smartphones and their operating systems, such as iOS. The Commission intends to specify how Apple will provide effective interoperability with functionalities such as notifications, device pairing and connectivity. The second proceeding focuses on the process Apple has set up to address interoperability requests submitted by developers and third parties for iOS and IPadOS. It is crucial that the request process is transparent, timely, and fair so that all developers have an effective and predictable path to interoperability and are enabled to innovate. ↫ European Commission press release It seems the European Commission is running out of patience, and in lieu of waiting on Apple to comply with the DMA on its own, is going to tell Apple exactly what it must do to comply with the interoperability obligation. This means that, once again, Apple&#8217;s childish, whiny approach to DMA compliance is backfiring spectacularly, with the company no longer having the opportunity to influence and control its own interoperability measures &#8211; the EC is simply going to tell them what they must do. The EC will complete these proceedings within six months, and will provide Apple with its preliminary findings which will explain what is expected of Apple. These findings will also be made public to invite comments from third parties. The proceedings are unrelated to any fines for non-compliance, which are separate.

## Haitian American news site faces harassment over post-debate Ohio coverage

date: 2024-09-19, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK  — Journalists at a news site that covers the Haitian community in the United States say they've been harassed and intimidated with racist messages for covering a fake story about immigrants eating the pets of people in an Ohio town.


One editor at the Haitian Times, a 25-year-old online publication, was "swatted" this week with police turning up at her home to investigate a false report of a gruesome crime. The news site canceled a community forum it had planned for Springfield, Ohio, and has shut down public comments on its stories about the issue because of threats and vile posts.


The Times, which had the Committee to Protect Journalists conduct safety training for its journalists in Haiti, has now asked for advice on how to protect staff in the United States, said Garry Pierre-Pierre, founder and publisher.


"We've never faced anything like this," Pierre-Pierre said Wednesday.


Site says it isn't backing down


The Times has debunked and aggressively covered the aftermath of the story about immigrants supposedly eating the dogs and cats of other Springfield residents, as it was spread by Ohio Sen. JD Vance, Donald Trump's Republican running mate in the presidential election, and Trump himself in his debate with Democrat Kamala Harris.


Despite receiving hundreds of these messages, the site isn't backing down, said Pierre-Pierre, a former reporter at The New York Times who echoed a mission statement from his old employer in making that promise.


"We do not want to hibernate," he said. "We're taking the precautions that are necessary. But our first duty is to tell the truth without fear or favor, and we have no fear."


Pierre-Pierre, who emigrated to the United States in 1975, started the Haitian Times to cover issues involving first- and second-generation Haitians in the United States, along with reporting on what is happening in their ancestral home. It started as a print publication that went online only in 2012 and now averages 10,000 to 15,000 visitors a day, although its readership has expanded in recent weeks.


Macollvie Neel, the New York-based special projects editor, was the staff member who had police officers show up at her doorstep on Monday.


It was triggered when a Haitian advocacy group received an email about a crime at Neel's address. They, in turn, notified police who showed up to investigate. Not only did the instigators know where Neel lived, they covered their tracks by funneling the report through another organization, she said.


Neel said she had a feeling something like this might happen, based on hateful messages she received. But it's still intimidating, made more so because the police who responded were not aware of the concept of doxxing, or tracing people online for the purpose of harassment. She said police searched her home and left.


She was always aware that journalism, by its nature, can make people unhappy with you. This takes the threat to an entirely new level. Racist hate groups who are ready to seize on any issue are sophisticated and well-funded, she said.


"This is a new form of domestic terrorism," she said, "and we have to treat it as such."


'It’s outrageous’


Katherine Jacobsen, the Committee to Protect Journalists' U.S., Canada and Caribbean program coordinator, said it's a particularly acute case of journalists being harassed in retaliation for their coverage of a story. "It's outrageous," she said. "We should not be having this conversation. Yet we are."


Even before Springfield received national attention in recent weeks, the Haitian Times had been covering the influx of immigrants to the Midwest in search of jobs and a lower cost of living, Pierre-Pierre said. A story currently on its site about Springfield details how the furor "reflects America's age-old battle with newcomers it desperately needs to survive."


Another article on the site talks about the NAACP, Haitian American groups and other activists from across the country coming to the aid of Springfield residents caught in the middle of the story.


Similarly, the Times has heard from several other journalists — including from Pierre-Pierre's old employer — who have offered support. "I'm deeply touched," he said.

## Biden to host Quad leaders at Delaware home

date: 2024-09-19, from: VOA News USA

washington — President Joe Biden has made it a priority to elevate the relationship of the Quad, four countries touched by the Indo-Pacific region, the White House said, as he prepares to host the leaders of Japan, India and Australia on Saturday at his Delaware home.


The region stretches from the U.S. West Coast to the shores of India to the northeast waters of Japan to the waters around Australia, and includes the many tiny, diffuse islands of the Pacific. That swath of the globe, the U.S. Commerce Department says, holds more than half the world's people and two-thirds of its economy.


And, administration officials said, this summit is personally important to Biden, as demonstrated by his decision to host the visitors in his private home in Wilmington, about 160 kilometers from the White House.


"The Biden-Harris administration has made elevating and institutionalizing the Quad a top priority," White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. "And this leaders' summit will focus on bolstering the strategic convergence among our countries, advancing our shared vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific region, and delivering concrete benefits for our partners in the Indo-Pacific in key areas."


Officials say the leaders will act on the region's concerns and will announce moves on illegal fishing in Southeast Asia and the Pacific.




"We've moved forward substantially on efforts that basically allow for the Pacific and Southeast Asia to track — largely untracked to this point — illegal fishing fleets that are the scourge of these extraordinarily important fishing areas," U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell told reporters Wednesday. "Vast majority of those fishing fleets are Chinese. We think these capacities will be indeed very helpful in helping local governments repel illegal fishing in their home waters."


Biden often likes to say that the U.S. is at an inflection point — a fact he has stressed recently as American voters face a tense November election with two very different presidential candidates.


Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump disagree on how to maintain the crucial U.S.-China relationship.


Trump is campaigning hard on harsh tariffs on China, saying, in a recent rally, "I'm putting a 200% tariff on them," while making false claims that Chinese automakers are putting up large factories in Mexico.


And Harris is expected to continue Biden's more cautious policy of keeping lines of communication open even while competing forcefully in many areas.


Beijing recently showed its sensitivity to hearing its name in U.S. election rhetoric, with Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning saying last week: "The election is an internal affair of the U.S. I won't comment on election remarks. But we oppose the U.S. using the election to criticize China."


Analysts say pulling the leaders of four powerful democracies into one room gives them space to talk freely.


"So really, I think the real agenda is not spoken about. It's China," said Rafiq Dossani, a senior economist at the RAND research corporation and a professor of policy analysis. "It's how to manage the rivalry with China."


"Each has their concerns about China," he told VOA. "That becomes, then, the text of the subtext or the background story."


But this group's interests extend far beyond China, analysts say.


"This is certainly not a Contain China club," said Kathryn Paik of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "The primary objectives of the Quad have focused on health, on delivering infrastructure needs, on enhancing countries' ability to monitor their maritime domains and their maritime resources, and on people-to-people ties between these countries."


VOA State Department Bureau Chief Nike Ching and Kim Lewis contributed to this report.

## US House Republicans fail to pass funding bill as shutdown approaches

date: 2024-09-19, from: VOA News USA

washington — Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives failed on Wednesday to pass a funding bill that included a controversial voting measure backed by Donald Trump, complicating efforts to avert a possible government shutdown at the end of the month.


Despite urging from Trump, the Republican candidate in the Nov. 5 presidential election, House Republicans were unable to muster enough votes to pass the package and send it on the Democratic-controlled Senate. With Democrats mostly united in opposition, the bill failed by a vote of 202-220, with 14 Republicans voting against and three Democrats in favor.


House Speaker Mike Johnson said afterward that he would craft a new temporary spending bill that would keep the government running beyond Oct. 1, when current funding is set to expire. He did not provide details.


"Now we go back to the playbook, draw up another play and we'll come up with another solution," Johnson said. "I'm already talking to colleagues."


Democrats in the House and the Senate say they are eager to pass a stopgap spending bill to avert a disruptive shutdown that would furlough hundreds of thousands of federal workers.


However, they opposed the version that Johnson brought to a vote on Wednesday, because it was paired with an unrelated voting bill that would require Americans to provide proof of citizenship when they register to vote and require states to purge non-citizens from their registration lists.


Johnson also has to contend with a contingent of Republicans who typically vote against stopgap funding bills.


Trump has made illegal immigration a central issue in his re-election bid and has falsely claimed that Democrats are registering illegal immigrants to vote, the latest in a long line of lies about election fraud.


House Republicans say their bill is needed to ensure that only American citizens vote. It is already illegal for a noncitizen to vote in federal elections and in state elections in every state, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.


"It's already illegal for a minor to purchase alcohol, yet we still card them. We still enforce the law," said Republican Representative Aaron Bean.


Senate Democrats have refused to consider the Republican voting bill, saying it would risk disenfranchising legitimate voters while doing nothing to bolster election security. A 2017 study found 30 instances of suspected illegal immigrant votes out of more than 25 million cast.


Democratic Representative Steny Hoyer predicted that Johnson would ultimately bring up a straightforward spending bill that could attract Democratic support — a dynamic that has played out repeatedly over the past year as Republicans have been paralyzed by infighting.


"We've seen this film before. Let's just skip to the ending today," he said.


Congress faces an even more critical deadline on Jan. 1, by which time lawmakers will have to raise the nation's debt ceiling or risk defaulting on more than $35 trillion in federal government debt.

## What the Jumbo Fed Cut Means for Renewables

It’s the beginning of an unwinding of years of high interest rates that have weighed on the global economy and especially renewable energy.</p><p>The Federal Reserve’s economic projections also indicated that the federal funds rate could fall another half point by the end of the year and a full point in 2025. The Federal Reserve began hiking interest rates from their near-zero levels in March 2022 in response to high inflation.</p><p><a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/fed-interest-rate-renewables" target="_self">High interest rates, which drive up the cost of borrowing money, have an outsize effect on renewable energy projects</a>. That’s because the cost of building and operating a renewable energy generator like a wind farm is highly concentrated in its construction, as opposed to operations, thanks to the fact that it doesn’t have to pay for fuel in the same way that a natural gas or coal-fired power plant does. This leaves developers highly exposed to the cost of borrowing money, which is directly tied to interest rates. “Our fuel is free, we say, but our fuel is really the cost of capital because we put so much capital out upfront,” <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-06/understanding-the-horrible-year-for-us-offshore-wind?sref=vuYGislZ" target="_blank">Orsted Americas chief executive David Hardy said in June</a>.</p><p>So what does that mean in practice? Let’s look at some numbers. </p><p>Wood Mackenzie<a href="https://www.woodmac.com/blogs/the-edge/higher-interest-rates-could-hold-up-energy-investment/" target="_blank"> estimates that a 2% increase in interest rates</a> pushes up the cost of energy produced by a renewables project by around 20%, compared to just over 10% for conventional power plants. </p><p>Meanwhile <a href="https://www.lazard.com/media/xemfey0k/lazards-lcoeplus-june-2024-_vf.pdf" target="_blank">the investment bank Lazard estimates</a> that reducing the cost of capital (the combined cost of borrowing money and selling equity in a project, both of which can be affected by interest rates) from 7.7% — the bank’s rough assumption over the summer — to 5.4% would lower the levelized cost of energy for an offshore wind system from $118 to $97 — around 17% — and for a utility solar project from $76 to $54 — roughly 28%. While there's not a one-to-one relationship between interest rates and the cost of capital, they move in the same direction.<br/></p><p>Reductions in cost of capital also make more renewables project viable to finance. According to a model developed by the Center for Public Enterprise, a typical renewable energy project with a weighted average cost of capital of 7.75% will have a debt service coverage ratio (a project’s cash flow compared to its loan payments)<strong> </strong>of 1.16. Investors consider projects to be roughly viable at 1.25.</p><p>So at the cost of capital assumed by Lazard, many projects will not get funded because investors don't see them as viable. If the weighted average cost of capital were to fall one percentage point to 6.75%, a project’s debt service coverage ratio would rise to 1.28, just above the viability threshold. If it fell by another percentage point, the debt ratio would hit a likely compelling 1.43.</p><p>“As rates fall, projects become increasingly financially viable,” Advait Arun, senior associate of energy finance at the Center for Public Enterprise and Heatmap contributor, told me matter-of-factly.<strong> </strong></p>

## Man who sold fentanyl-laced pill liable for $5.8 million in death of young female customer

date: 2024-09-18, from: VOA News USA

LOS ANGELES — In 2019, Brandon McDowell was contacted by a sophomore in college who asked to buy Percocet, a prescription painkiller. 


What the 20-year-old sold her instead were counterfeit pills laced with fentanyl, a deadly synthetic opioid that can be lethal in a dose as small as 2 milligrams. Hours later, Alexandra Capelouto, also 20, was dead in her Temecula, California, home. 


It is an increasingly common scenario as fentanyl overdoses have become a leading cause of death for minors in the last five years, with more than 74,000 people dying in the U.S. from a synthetic opioid in 2023, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 


McDowell has been behind bars since 2022 with a fentanyl possession conviction. But the Capeloutos have now won an additional $5.8 million judgment against him for the death of their daughter. 


"We've won the battle but not the war," said Matt Capelouto, Alexandra's father. "We still have a long ways to go in terms of holding drug dealers accountable for deaths." 


Baruch Cohen, the Capeloutos' lawyer, said this was the first time a drug dealer has been held liable civilly for someone's death, to his knowledge. 


"Here's the hope that this judgment will be the shot that's heard around the world, so to speak," Cohen said. "Because if it inhibits another drug deal from going down, where the drug dealer ... realizes that, besides the jail sentence, he is liable for millions of dollars of damages, maybe he'll think twice." 


McDowell, now 25, first pleaded guilty in California federal court in 2022 for possession with intent to distribute fentanyl, a charge that carries a 20-year minimum sentence if linked to death or serious injury and convicted by a jury. McDowell was sentenced to nine years in prison. 


Alexandra's father felt that wasn't enough. He and his wife, who was diagnosed with stage four breast cancer that year and has been battling it since, decided to sue McDowell for wrongful death. 


"For taking somebody's life, that was not a fair sentence," he said. "I was going to pursue every means possible to make sure justice was served." 


While McDowell filed for bankruptcy, the Capeloutos won a judgment of about $5 million against him. The Superior Court of Riverside County found he sold harmful narcotics with "willful and malicious" intent that led to Alexandra Capelouto's death. A few months later, the Capeloutos filed another case in federal bankruptcy court to ensure that McDowell could not escape his debt under bankruptcy. 


"Bankruptcy is designed for honest debtors, not crooked criminal debtors," Cohen said. "This judgment will haunt him the rest of his life, and when he does make money, we'll garnish it. When he does buy property, we'll put a lien on it." 


Judge Mark Houle ruled in the Capeloutos' favor, ordering a $5.8 million judgment against Brandon McDowell that includes a year and half of interest in addition to the initial $5 million. 


Since his daughter's death, Matt Capelouto founded the non-profit Stop Drug Homicide to advocate for families and push for more legislation to hold drug dealers accountable. One is Alexandra's Law, which would require a formal warning be given to anyone with a drug-related conviction to inform them of the dangers of dealing drugs and that they could be charged with murder if they distribute drugs that lead to someone's death. 


In California, it can be difficult for prosecutors to charge drug dealers with someone's death because they must prove the dealer had knowledge that the drugs could cause death, Capelouto said. Having an admonishment on the record for dealers who have been convicted of a drug-related crime could be used as evidence in future cases if someone dies from the drugs they sold. Alexandra's Law is included in Proposition 36, a tough-on-crime ballot measure that Californians will vote on in November. 


Capelouto is also part of a group of 60 families suing Snapchat for its role in the distribution of deadly narcotics. Alexandra Capelouto and Brandon McDowell had communicated over Snapchat when she bought pills from him. 


Justin McDowell, Brandon's father, said it is unfair for his son to take all the blame. He said his son was struggling with drug abuse and had been in rehab, and he didn't live with him at the time because the McDowells had younger children. 


"My son is no drug dealer at all. They were both users. They both had an addiction," he said. "He was a stupid 20-year-old kid." 


Justin McDowell said he felt like the Capeloutos were seeking revenge through their lawsuits, and he did not have the money and resources to fight on his son's behalf in court. Brandon McDowell was being held at the federal prison in San Pedro during the lawsuit and did not have lawyers to defend himself in civil or bankruptcy court. 


"I think that's sad, that shouldn't be allowed," Justin McDowell said. "We'll wait for him to get out of prison, give him a hug, and figure out how to deal with the situation ... the kid's never going to make $5.8 million in his life." 


Matt Capelouto said there was no evidence of his daughter having a drug addiction, and Brandon McDowell's addiction does not absolve him of responsibility in her death. 


"When you go from drug user to drug dealer, you cross a line from needing help to needing to be held accountable," he said.

## Teamsters union declines to endorse Trump or Harris

date: 2024-09-18, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The International Brotherhood of Teamsters declined Wednesday to endorse Kamala Harris or Donald Trump for president, saying neither candidate had sufficient support from the 1.3 million-member union.


"Unfortunately, neither major candidate was able to make serious commitments to our union to ensure the interests of working people are always put before big business," Teamsters President Sean O'Brien said in a statement. "We sought commitments from both Trump and Harris not to interfere in critical union campaigns or core Teamsters industries — and to honor our members' right to strike — but were unable to secure those pledges."


Harris met Monday with a panel of Teamsters, having long courted organized labor and made support for the middle class her central policy goal. Trump also met with a panel of Teamsters and even invited O'Brien to speak at the Republican National Convention, where the union leader railed against corporate greed.


The Teamsters said Wednesday that internal polling of its members showed Trump with an advantage over Harris.


The Teamsters' choice to not endorse came just weeks ahead of the November 5 election, far later than other large unions such as the AFL-CIO and the United Auto Workers, which have chosen to back Harris.

## GNOME 47 released with accent colours and completely new open/save file dialogs

date: 2024-09-18, from: OS News

The GNOME project has released their newest major version, GNOME 47, and while it&#8217;s not the most groundbreaking release, there&#8217;s still a ton of good stuff in here. Two features really stand our, with the first one being the addition of accent colours. Instead of being locked into the default GNOME blue accent colour, you can now choose between a variety of colours, which is a very welcome addition. I use the accent colour feature on all my computers, and since I run KDE, I also have this nifty KDE feature where it&#8217;ll select an accent colour automatically based on your wallpaper. No, this isn&#8217;t a groundbreaking feature, but considering GNOME&#8217;s tendency towards not allowing any customisation, this is simply very welcome. A much more substantial feature comes in the form of brand new open/save file dialogs, and I&#8217;m sure even the GNOME developers themselves are collectively sighing in relief about this one. GNOME&#8217;s open/save dialogs were so bad they became a meme, and now they&#8217;re finally well and truly fixed, thanks to effectively removing the old ones and adding new ones based on the GNOME Files file manager. GNOME 47 comes with brand new file open and save file dialogs. The new dialogs are a major upgrade compared with the previous versions, and are based on the existing Files app rather than being a separate codebase. This results in the new dialogs having a much more complete set of features compared with the old open and save dialogs. With the new dialogs you can zoom the view, change the sort order in the icon view, rename files and folders, preview files, and more. ↫ GNOME 47 release notes And yes, this includes thumbnails. There&#8217;s tons more in GNOME 47, like a new design for dialog windows that look and feel more like they belong on a mobile UI, tons of improvements to Files, the Settings application, GNOME Online Accounts, Web, and more. GNOME 47 will make its way to your distribution of choice soon enough, but of course, you can always build and install it yourself if you&#8217;re so inclined.

## Climate week talks to include critical minerals and seabed mining debate

date: 2024-09-18, from: VOA News USA

Washington — When activists, policymakers and representatives from across the globe gather next week in New York to participate in climate week, one pressing issue on the agenda that is less frequently discussed and known will be the environmental impact of seabed mining.


As countries look for ways to lower emissions, critical minerals are playing a key role in that transition. Critical minerals are used in all kinds of green technologies, from solar panels and wind turbines to batteries in electric vehicles. And one place where those mineral resources are abundant is deep under the sea.


The debate over accessing seabed resources is heated. Supporters say the technology exists to safely access these critical minerals undersea, but environmentalists and activists say the potential of undiscovered biodiversity on the seafloor is too important to endanger.


During climate week, which will take place on the sidelines of U.N. General Assembly meetings, organizers are expected to host a roundtable on the environmental impact of seabed mining and other discussions about critical minerals.




The World Economic Forum says that if the globe wants to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, two-thirds of vehicles must be powered by electric batteries. And the International Energy Agency says that to reach that goal, the world needs six times more mineral resources by 2040 than it has today.


Some of the largest mineral deposits are found on the ocean floor in the form of polymetallic nodules, or rocks.


Ocean of resources


According to the International Seabed Authority, or ISA, there are 21 billion tons of polymetallic nodules strewn across the seabed of the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, or CCZ. Each nodule contains a combination of electric vehicle battery components such as nickel, manganese, copper and cobalt. The ISA plans to release regulations for mining in the international waters of the CCZ by 2025.




The ISA has already awarded 17 exploration contracts for polymetallic nodules in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone – a large swath of the Pacific Ocean the size of the continental United States which sits between Hawaii and Mexico. Three of those exploration contracts went to The Metals Company, a Canadian deep-sea mining company.


The Pacific Island Nations of Nauru, Kiribati and Tonga have sponsored The Metals Company’s efforts to develop a portion of the seabed. In an interview with VOA, CEO Gerard Barron said the company is ready to begin as soon as the ISA allows mining.


“Our collector methodology is to put a robot on the seafloor which crawls around the ocean floor and fires a jet of water at the nodule and it creates an inverse pressure and lifts the nodule up, and so we don’t go down and scour the seafloor,” said Barron via Zoom, adding that TMC has spent the past decade focused on testing this equipment and collecting data on its environmental impact as part of its permit application to the ISA.




Moratorium needed


Critics worry scooping up these mineral-rich rocks will disrupt important biodiversity – much of it still unnamed and some of it undiscovered. Researchers have found that 90% of the more than 5,000 species in the zone are new to science. Eddie Palu, president of the Tonga Fishery Association, wants a pause for more research.


“We demand a moratorium on the seabed mining until the environmental, economic and social risk are comprehensively understood,” he said during a panel discussion at the recent Pacific Islands Forum in Tonga.


Shiva Gounden from Greenpeace Australia Pacific, who also sat on the panel, agreed.


“We know only very little of the deep sea, and the race for the final frontier could cause irreversible damages to the people and to the communities of our Pacific,” Gounden said.


But scientists say no light and very little oxygen reaches the deep sea – limiting the life there to mostly bacteria and small invertebrates.


The Metals Company’s Barron said combating climate change is a bigger threat to the planet than undersea mining, adding that the company’s environmental impact studies show that “we can safely collect these nodules” and turn them into battery metals without having “a negative impact on the ocean.”


“The notion that we can do any extraction with zero impact is a dream,” added Barron. “The oceans are impacted by every single thing we do today, especially global warming. So, we need to address the main driver for climate change and reduce emissions.”


Fueling innovation 


Still, the quest to do just that – access minerals on the seabed with minimal impact to the environment – has created competition between technology companies.


U.S. tech startup Impossible Metals is testing a robot which can avoid nodules where it detects life and harvests those where it does not.


“The vehicle hovers above the seabed, uses the camera and it actually picks up the nodules one by one. So this really minimizes all of the negative concerns around big sediment plumes,” CEO Oliver Gunasekra told VOA in an interview.


Gunaskera’s company spun off Viridian Biometals. Its technology bypasses energy-intensive processes such as smelting with bacteria which can separate metal ore from the rock around it. The process creates no emissions or waste.


“The bacteria need oxygen just like we do to breathe. And when there's not enough oxygen in the water around them, the bacteria have learned that there's oxygen in the rocks, and they have adapted to breathe that oxygen,” said Viridian CEO Eric Macris.


Impossible Metals and Viridian Biometals say they are two to three years out from commercializing their technology, depending on funding. TMC says it could be ready to begin its collection operations as soon as international regulations are released next year.

## Mississippi town moves Confederate monument that became an eyesore

date: 2024-09-18, from: VOA News USA

grenada, mississippi  — A Mississippi town has taken down a Confederate monument that stood on the courthouse square since 1910 — a figure that was tightly wrapped in tarps the past four years, symbolizing the community's enduring division over how to commemorate the past.


Grenada's first Black mayor in two decades seems determined to follow through on the city's plans to relocate the monument to other public land, a concrete slab behind a fire station about 5.6 kilometers from the square.


But a new fight might be developing. A Republican lawmaker from another part of Mississippi wrote to Grenada officials saying she believes the city is violating a state law that restricts the relocation of war memorials or monuments.


The Grenada City Council voted to move the monument in 2020, weeks after police killed George Floyd in Minneapolis. The vote seemed timely: Mississippi legislators had just retired the last state flag in the U.S. that prominently featured the Confederate battle emblem.


The tarps went up soon after the vote, shrouding the Confederate soldier and the pedestal he stood on. But even as people complained about the eyesore, the move was delayed by tight budgets, state bureaucracy or political foot-dragging.


A new mayor and city council took office in May, prepared to take action. On Sept. 11, with little advance notice, police blocked traffic and a work crew disassembled and removed the 6.1-meter stone structure.


"I'm glad to see it move to a different location," said Robin Whitfield, an artist with a studio just off Grenada's historic square. "This represents that something has changed."


Still, Whitfield, who is white, said she wishes Grenada leaders had invited the community to engage in a discussion about the symbol, to bridge the gap between those who think moving it is erasing history and those who see it as a daily reminder of white supremacy. She was among the few people watching as a crane lifted parts of the monument onto a flatbed truck.


"No one ever talked about it, other than yelling on Facebook," Whitfield said.


Mayor Charles Latham said the monument has been "quite a divisive figure" in the town of 12,300, where about 57% of residents are Black and 40% are white.


"I understand people had family ... fight and die in that war, and they should be proud of their family," Latham said. "But you've got to understand that there were those who were oppressed by this, by the Confederate flag on there. There's been a lot of hate and violence perpetrated against people of color, under the color of that flag."


The city received permission from the Mississippi Department of Archives and History to move the Confederate monument, as required. But Representative Stacey Hobgood-Wilkes of Picayune said the fire station site is inappropriate.


"We are prepared to pursue such avenues that may be necessary to ensure that the statue is relocated to a more suitable and appropriate location," she wrote, suggesting a Confederate cemetery closer to the courthouse square as an alternative. She said the Ladies Cemetery Association is willing to deed a parcel to the city to make it happen.


The Confederate monument in Grenada is one of hundreds in the South, most of which were dedicated during the early 20th century when groups such as the United Daughters of the Confederacy sought to shape the historical narrative by valorizing the Lost Cause mythology of the Civil War.


The monuments, many of them outside courthouses, came under fresh scrutiny after an avowed white supremacist who had posed with Confederate flags in photos posted online killed nine Black people inside the historic Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015.

## Renewable Energy’s Farmland Free-for-All

And it’s frighteningly unclear how developers will resolve this problem – or if they even can. </p><p>As solar and wind has grown rapidly across the country, so too have protests against solar and wind power on “prime farmland,” a loose term used by industry and government officials to describe property best suited for growing lots of crops. Towns and counties are banning the construction of solar and wind farms on prime farmland. State regulators – including those run by Democrats – are restricting renewable development on prime farmland, and members of Congress are looking at cutting off or restricting federal funds to projects on prime farmland. </p><p>In theory, meeting our country’s climate goals and industry needs should require <a href="https://today.oregonstate.edu/news/installing-solar-panels-agricultural-lands-maximizes-their-efficiency-new-study-shows" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>very little farmland</u></a>. But those same wide expanses flush with sunlight and gusts of wind sought after by developers happen to often be used by farmers: A USDA study released this <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/109209/err-330.pdf?v=9082.7" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>year found</u></a> more than 90% of wind turbines and 70% of solar farms in rural areas were sited on agricultural land. </p><p>It would be easy for an activist or energy nerd to presume this farmland free-for-all is being driven by outside actors or adverse incentives (and there’s a little bit of that going on, as we’ll get to). </p><p>However, weeks of reporting – and internal Heatmap News datasets – have revealed to me that farmland opposition actually has a devilishly simple explanation: many large farm owners are just plain hostile to land use changes that could potentially, or even just hypothetically, impact their capacity to grow more crops. </p><p>This means there is no easy solution and as I’ll explain, it is unclear whether the renewables sector’s efforts to appear more accommodating to agricultural businesses – most notably agri-voltaics – will stem the tide of local complaints from rural farmers. </p><p>“This is a new land use that is very quickly accelerating across the country and one of the major reactions is just to that fact,” Ethan Winter of American Farmland Trust, a nonprofit promoting solar education in farm communities, told me. “These are people who’ve been farming this land for generations in some instances. The idea of doing anything to take it out of agricultural production is just hard for them, for their community, and it’s about the culture of their community, and if solar is something that can be considered compatible with agriculture.” </p><h2>Tracking the conflict</h2><p>Over 40% of all restrictive ordinances and moratoriums in Heatmap Pro's database are occurring in counties with large agricultural workforces. </p><p>In fact, our internal data via Heatmap Pro has found that agricultural employment can be a useful predictor of whether a community will oppose the deployment of renewables. It's particularly salient where there's large-scale, capital-intensive farming, likely because the kind of agriculture requiring expensive machinery, costly chemicals, and physical and financial infrastructure — think insurance and loans — indicates that farming is the economic cornerstone of that entire community.</p><p>Resentment against renewables is pronounced in the Corn Belt, but it’s also happening even in the bluest of states like Connecticut, where state environmental regulators <a href="https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/deep/permits_and_licenses/client-concierge/draft-guidance-for-siting-solar-on-agricultural-land.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>have recommended</u></a> against developing on prime farmland and require additional permits to build on preferred fertile soils. Or New York, where under pressure from farming groups including the state Farm Bureau, the state legislature last year included language in a new <a href="https://legislation.nysenate.gov/pdf/bills/2023/s4006c#page=115" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>permitting authority law</u></a> limiting the New York Power Authority from approving solar and wind on “land used in agricultural production” unless the project was agrivoltaics, which means it allows simultaneous farming of the property. The state legislature is now looking at <a href="https://nysfocus.com/2024/04/05/transmission-renewable-energy-transition-new-york" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>additional curbs</u></a> on siting projects in farmland as it considers new permitting legislation. </p><p>Deanna Fox, head of the <a href="https://nyfb.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>New York Farm Bureau</u></a>, explained to me that her organization’s bottom-up structure essentially means its positions are a consensus of its grassroots farm worker membership. And those members really don’t trust renewables to be safe for farmland. </p><p>“What happens when those solar arrays no longer work, or they become antiquated? Or farmland loses its agricultural designation and becomes zoned commercial? How does that impact ag districting in general? Does that land just become commercial? Can it go back to being agricultural land?” Fox asked. “If you were to talk to a group of farmers about solar, I would guarantee none of them would say anything about the emotional aspect of it. I don’t think that's what it really is for them. [And] if it’s emotional, it’s wrapped around the economics of it.”</p><p>Surveys of farmers have hinted that fears could be assuaged if developers took steps to make their projects more harmonious with agricultural work. As we reported last week, a <a href="https://www.ssii.org/report-70-of-americas-farmers-open-to-solar-development/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>survey by</u></a> the independent research arm of the Solar Energy Industries Association found up to 70% of farmers they spoke with said they were “open to large-scale solar” but many sought stipulations for dual usage of the land for farming – a practice known as agrivoltaics. </p><p>Clearly, agrivoltaics and other simultaneous use strategies are what the industry wants to promote. As we hit send on last week’s newsletter, I was strolling around RE+, renewable energy’s largest U.S. industry conference. Everywhere I turned, I found publicity around solar and farming.</p><p>The Department of Energy even got in on the action. At the same time as the conference, the department chose to announce a <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/articles/biden-harris-administration-invests-nearly-20-million-improve-siting-renewable-energy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>new wave of financial prizes</u></a> for companies piloting simultaneous solar energy and farming techniques. </p><p>“In areas where there has been a lot of loss of farmland to development, solar is one more factor that I think has worried folks in some communities,” Becca Jones-Albertus, director of DOE’s solar energy technologies office, told me during an interview at the conference. However agri-voltaics offer “a really exciting strategy because it doesn’t make this an <em><em>either or</em></em>. It’s a <em><em>yes and</em></em>.” </p><p>It remains to be seen whether these attempts at harmony will resolve any of the discord. </p><h2>Grazing: Helpful or irrelevant? </h2><p>One industry practice being marketed to farm communities that folks hope will soften opposition is sheep grazing at solar farms. At RE+, The American Solar Grazing Association, an advocacy group, <a href="https://www.grazinglands.org/events/solar-grazing-documentary-premiere-reception" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>debuted a documentary</u></a> about the practice at the conference and had an outdoor site outside the showroom with sheep chilling underneath solar panel frames. The sheep display had a sign thanking sponsors including AES, Arevon, BP, EDF Renewables, and Pivot Energy. </p><p>Some developers like Avangrid have found grazing to be a useful way to mitigate physical project risks <a href="https://www.avangrid.com/w/avangrid-begins-largest-solar-grazing-operation-in-the-pacific-northwest" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>at solar farms</u></a> in the Pacific Northwest. Out in rural Oregon and Washington, unkempt grasslands can present a serious fire risk. So after trying other methods, Avangrid partnered with an Oregon rancher, Cameron Krebs, who told me he understands why some farmers are skeptical about developers coming into their neck of the woods. </p><p>“Culturally speaking, this is agricultural land. These are communities that grow wheat and raise cattle. So my peers, when they put in the solar farms and they see it going out of production, that really bothers the community in general,” he said. </p><p>But Krebs doesn’t see solar farms with grazing the same way. </p><p>“It’s a retooling. It may not be corn production anymore. But we’re still going to need a lot of resources. We’re still going to need tire shops. I think there is a big fear that the solar companies will take the land out of production and then the meat shops and the food production would suffer because we don’t have that available on the landscape, but I think we can have utility scale solar that is healthy for our communities. And that really in my mind means honoring that soil with good vegetation.” </p><p>It’s important to note, however, that grazing can’t really solve renewables’ farmland problem. Often grazing is most helpful in dry Western desert. Not to mention sheep aren’t representative of all livestock – they’re a small percentage. And Heatmap Pro’s database has found an important distinction between farms focused on crops versus livestock — the latter isn’t as predisposed to oppose renewable energy. </p><h2>The uproar around Oak Run </h2><p>Ground zero for the future of renewables on farmland is Savion's proposed Oak Run project in Ohio, which at up to 800 megawatts of generation capacity would be the state’s largest solar farm. The developer also plans to let farmers plant and harvest crops in between the solar arrays, making it the nation’s largest agri-voltaics site if completed.</p><p>But Oak Run is still being opposed by nearby landowners and local officials citing impacts to farmland. At Oak Run’s proposed site, neighboring township governments have passed resolutions opposing construction, as has <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/18052024/ohio-solar-projects-politics/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the county board of commissioners</u></a>, and town and county officials sued to undo Oak Run’s approval at the Ohio Power Siting Board. Although that lawsuit <a href="https://opsb.ohio.gov/news/OPSB-approves-Oak-Run-Solar-Project+in-Madison-County" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>was unsuccessful</u></a>, its backers want to take the matter to the state Supreme Court. </p><p>Some of this might be tied to the pure fact Ohio is super hostile to renewables right now. Over a third of counties in the state have restricted or outright banned solar and wind projects, according to Heatmap Pro’s database.</p><p>But there’s more at play here. The attorney representing town and county officials is Jack Van Kley, a lawyer and former state government official who remains based in Ohio and who has represented many farms in court for myriad reasons. I talked to Van Kley last week for an hour about why he opposes renewables projects (“they’re anything but clean in my opinion”), his views on global warming (“I don’t get involved in the dispute over climate change”) and a crucial fact that might sting: He says at least roughly two thirds of his clientele are farmers or communities reliant on agricultural businesses. </p><p>“It’s neighbor against neighbor in these communities,” he told me. “You’ve got a relatively low number of farmers who want to lease their land so that the solar companies can put solar panels on them for thirty or forty years, and it’s just a few landowners that are profiting from these projects.” </p><p>Van Kley spoke to a concern voiced by his clients I haven’t really heard addressed by solar developers much: overall impacts to irrigation. Specifically, he said an outsized concern among farmers is simply how putting a solar or wind farm adjacent or close to their property will impact how groundwater and surface water moves in the area, which can impact somebody’s existing agricultural drainage infrastructure. </p><p>“If you do that next to another property that is being farmed, you’ll kill the crop because you’ll flood the crop,” he claimed. “This is turning out to be a big issue for farmers who are opposing these facilities.” </p><p>Some have <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/open/2023/07/this-lawyer-is-a-thorn-in-ohio-green-energys-side-whos-paying-the-bills.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>tried to paint</u></a> Van Kley as funded or assisted by the fossil fuel lobby or shadowy actors. Van Kley has denied any involvement in those kinds of backroom dealings. While there’s glimpses of evidence <a href="https://energynews.us/2024/08/26/connections-confirmed-between-grassroots-ohio-solar-opposition-and-dark-money-natural-gas-group/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>gas</u></a> and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/02/18/1154867064/solar-power-misinformation-activists-rural-america" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>coal money</u></a> plays at least a minor role with other characters fomenting opposition in the state, I really have no evidence of him being one of these people right now. It’s much easier and simpler to reason that he’s being paid by another influential sect – large landowners, many of whom work in agriculture.</p><p>That’s the same conclusion John Boeckl reached. Boeckl, an Army engineer, is one of the property owners leasing land for construction of the Oak Run project. He supports Oak Run being built and has submitted testimony in the legal challenge over its approvals. Though Boeckl certainly wants to know more about who is funding the opposition and has his gripes with neighbors who keep putting signs on his property that say “no solar on prime farmland,” he hasn’t witnessed any corporate skullduggery from shadowy outside entities.</p><p>“I think it’s just farmers being farmers,” he said. “They don’t want to be told what to do with their land.”</p>

Newport County, Rhode Island </strong>– I’ve learned that climate activists in Rhode Island are now using local protests to oppose NIMBYs who are challenging renewables projects. </p>
<ul><li>On Sept. 19, members of Climate Action Rhode Island – a <a href="https://world.350.org/rhodeisland/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>local offshoot of 350.org</u></a> – will be on the ground disrupting the entrance to <a href="https://www.discovernewport.org/blog/post/newport-mansions-wine-food-festival/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a lavish dinner</u></a> hosted by the Preservation Society of Newport County, a wealthy architectural conservation group that sued federal regulators over their approval of Eversource’s Revolution offshore wind project.</li><li>As that lawsuit works its way through the courts, activists are using local opposition to draw public attention to the Preservation Society and portray it as an obstacle to progress on decarbonization with op-eds, meetings, and now more protests. </li><li>Nick Horton of Climate Action Rhode Island told me that this public awareness campaign may also target the TV network HBO, as its show “The Gilded Age” <a href="https://www.newportmansions.org/gilded-age/episode-deep-dive/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has been filmed</u></a> at the Preservation Society’s historic mansions. </li><li>“I think broadly speaking the environmental movement really needs to start organizing around the threat of NIMBYism, and needs to start identifying these NIMBY organizations as prime bad actors in the pushback against the renewable energy transition,” Horton said. </li></ul>
<p><strong>2.

<ul><li>The tribes are opposing offshore wind for many of the same reasons tribes in California and Washington state have fought against development – impacting the viewshed could hinder tribal cultural practices. This litigation also cites potential environmental impacts and requests additional government analysis. </li><li>This lawsuit arrives as two coastal counties – Coos and Curry – will <a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2024/08/07/coos-county-offshore-wind-development/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>vote this November</u></a> on a non-binding ballot measure expressing opposition to offshore wind. </li></ul>

<ul><li>Fresh off news of the lawsuit, Gevo – a sustainable aviation fuel startup that plans to use the pipeline to transport its products – today announced it acquired <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/09/12/2945038/0/en/Gevo-to-Acquire-Red-Trail-Energy-Assets-in-North-Dakota-Including-Operating-Low-Carbon-Ethanol-Production-and-Carbon-Sequestration-Facilities-Expanding-Platform-for-Sustainable-Avi.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a new biofuels plant in North Dakota</u></a> that it said can “mitigate risk” tied to the South Dakota plant it plans to link to Summit. </li><li>I spoke with Gevo CEO Patrick Gruber last month about Summit and his answer presaged this move: “When do we need a pipeline? Do I need it tomorrow? Nope. I don’t need it until 2027, 2028, I have a lot of time here. I don’t need it until then. I’ve got options, really. We have a lot of game to play still.” </li><li>I’ll be watching for future developments in the Summit saga as well as whether CO2 pipeline opposition is fueling local moratoria against solar and wind as well. </li></ul>
<p><strong>4. Houston County, Georgia </strong>– One of Georgia’s largest proposed solar projects has been rejected by a potential host county over its potential impacts to bear habitat and property values. </p>

## US Federal Reserve cuts key rate by sizable half-point, signaling end to its inflation fight

date: 2024-09-18, from: VOA News USA

Washington — The U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday cut its benchmark interest rate by an unusually large half-point, a dramatic shift after more than two years of high rates helped tame inflation but that also made borrowing painfully expensive for American consumers.


The rate cut, the Fed's first in more than four years, reflects its new focus on bolstering the job market, which has shown clear signs of slowing. Coming just weeks before the presidential election, the Fed's move also has the potential to scramble the economic landscape just as Americans prepare to vote.


The central bank's action lowered its key rate to roughly 4.8%, down from a two-decade high of 5.3%, where it had stood for 14 months as it struggled to curb the worst inflation streak in four decades. Inflation has tumbled from a peak of 9.1% in mid-2022 to a three-year low of 2.5% in August, not far above the Fed's 2% target.


The Fed's policymakers also signaled that they expect to cut their key rate by an additional half-point in their final two meetings this year, in November and December. And they envision four more rate cuts in 2025 and two in 2026.


In a statement, the Fed came closer than it has before to declaring victory over inflation: It said it "has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%."


Though the central bank now believes inflation is largely defeated, many Americans remain upset with still-high prices for groceries, gas, rent and other necessities. Former President Donald Trump blames the Biden-Harris administration for sparking an inflationary surge. Vice President Kamala Harris, in turn, has charged that Trump's promise to slap tariffs on all imports would raise prices for consumers even further.


Rate cuts by the Fed should, over time, lower borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans and credit cards, boosting Americans' finances and supporting more spending and growth. Homeowners will be able to refinance mortgages at lower rates, saving on monthly payments, and even shift credit card debt to lower-cost personal loans or home equity lines. Businesses may also borrow and invest more.


Average mortgage rates have already dropped to an 18-month low of 6.2%, according to Freddie Mac, spurring a jump in demand for refinancings.


The Fed's next policy meeting is Nov. 6-7 — immediately after the presidential election. By cutting rates this week, soon before the election, the Fed is risking attacks from Trump, who has argued that lowering rates now amounts to political interference. Yet Politico has reported that even some key Senate Republicans who were interviewed have expressed support for a Fed rate cut this week.


The central bank's officials fought against high inflation by raising their key rate 11 times in 2022 and 2023. Wage growth has since slowed, removing a potential source of inflationary pressure. And oil and gas prices are falling, a sign that inflation should continue to cool in the months ahead. Consumers are also pushing back against high prices, forcing such companies as Target and McDonald's to dangle deals and discounts.


Yet after several years of strong job growth, employers have slowed hiring, and the unemployment rate has risen nearly a full percentage point from its half-century low in April 2023 to a still-low 4.2%. Once unemployment rises that much, it tends to keep climbing. Fed officials and many economists note, though, that the rise in unemployment this time largely reflects an influx of people seeking jobs — notably new immigrants and recent college graduates — rather than layoffs.


At issue in the Fed's deliberations is how fast it wants to lower its benchmark rate to a point where it's no longer acting as a brake on the economy — nor as an accelerant. Where that so-called "neutral" level falls isn't clear, though many analysts peg it at 3% to 3.5%.

## Time for Tariffs and Permitting Reform?

## Eric Dresselhuys, CEO of ESS, Makes the Case for Iron-Flow Batteries

date: 2024-09-18, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzY0NDMyNi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1NTk0NDk3OH0.Y4GDr1B00pPzFM-Mj61RMK1jjKzN1WsjjCDareyDnPg/image.jpg?width=900&height=410&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p>While in Anaheim for RE+ last week, I met with Eric Dresselhuys, CEO of long duration iron-flow battery storage manufacturer ESS Inc. We chatted about battery fires, community buy-in, and the future of China policy. I came in expecting optimism and left feeling we need a lot more conversations like this one.<br/></p>
<p>The following is an abridged version of our conversation that has been edited for clarity. </p>
<p><strong>How does your product address the opinion that battery storage has a buy-in problem? </strong></p>
<p>It’s not so much an opinion as just reporting the obvious, which is that lithium-ion batteries on the grid have a buy-in problem. Maybe if you’re in rural western Australia nobody cares because there are no human beings around, but if you look at the need for energy storage to facilitate the energy transition, it’s pretty clear we have to put batteries all over the place and specifically close to where human beings live. And that’s a problem. </p>
<p>Can iron-flow help solve that problem? I think unequivocally we can. It’s a very different architecture. It’s a battery that’s really designed from the beginning to operate as a grid backup battery. If you go back to look at lithium, it was never designed to go onto the grid. It was designed to go into camcorders, phones. This is not the technology I think anybody would’ve picked for the grid if they had started from scratch. </p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing any change in demand for your product from protests over lithium battery projects? </strong></p>
<p>I think it’s the old gag of <em><em>all politics are local</em></em>. The politics of siting is a local problem. What’s simultaneously true is adoption of storage on the grid is growing at a phenomenally high rate. And yet there are stories [about opposition] all over the place. There was just one up in Marin County, California, where the <a href="https://www.marinij.com/2023/03/13/marin-battery-storage-project-sparks-early-opposition/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>community said</u></a> it’s in an area adjacent to wetlands. And they said you know what? We’re just not going to put a– </p>
<p><strong>But are these communities opposed to lithium storage actually choosing iron-flow over these projects, or are they just saying no to any development? </strong></p>
<p>Right now, they’re just saying no. The communities are not going to solve the problem. They’re going to tell you what is unacceptable and it’s going to be somebody else’s job to solve the problem. </p>
<p>I’ll use <a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/iron-flow-battery-ess-schiphol-airport-technology-startup" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam</u></a> [as an example]. They said, <em><em>we have thousands of gallons of jet fuel laying around. And people. And airplanes. We can’t put a lithium battery out here. </em></em>So they’re using an iron-flow and sought out a non-lithium battery to solve their energy storage problems because it was safer. </p>
<p><strong>China policy looms large over the future of U.S. battery supplies. What do you think the final endgame will be of our approach to China’s dominance in this business segment? </strong></p>
<p>It’s a great question that I don’t think I know the answer to. I think the next step is to try and get the playing field somewhat level. The amount of subsidy that goes into renewables in general and batteries in particular in China is daunting. People talk about the IRA and all these things as if it’s a lot of money, but it’s a pittance compared to what China is putting in. </p>
<p>Getting the playing field a little more level in the short term through a combination of incentives here and tariffs coming on will be a next step. Until we get carbon accounting — cradle-to-grave carbon accounting — it’ll be hard to get things totally level because in the U.S. we enforce environmental laws and we don’t employ prison labor to build [these] things. Until we get that full ESG accounting, I think there’s going to be some limitation. </p>
<p><strong>Okay one fun question – what was the last song you listened to? Keeping ‘em honest here at Heatmap News. </strong></p>

## Sean 'Diddy' Combs makes fresh bid for bail in sex trafficking, conspiracy case

date: 2024-09-18, from: VOA News USA

New York — Lawyers for Sean "Diddy" Combs asked a judge Wednesday to let him await his sex trafficking trial at his luxury home on an island near Miami Beach, rather than a grim federal jail in Brooklyn. 


Combs' lawyers offered a $50 million bail package — using his mansion as collateral — in exchange for releasing him to home detention with GPS monitoring. A hearing on the request was scheduled for Wednesday afternoon. On Tuesday, a U.S. magistrate judge in Manhattan ordered Combs held without bail. 


The hip-hop mogul whose career blossomed in the 1990s was arrested on Monday on charges contained in an indictment that accuses Combs of using his "power and prestige" for "sex trafficking, forced labor, interstate transportation for purposes of prostitution, drug offenses, kidnapping, arson, bribery and obstruction of justice." 


It describes the inducement of female victims and male sex workers into drugged-up, elaborately produced sexual performances dubbed "Freak Offs" that Combs arranged, directed, masturbated during and often recorded. The events would sometimes last days and require IVs to recover from, the indictment said. 


It alleges he coerced and abused women for years while using blackmail, including the videos he shot, and shocking acts of violence to keep his victims in line, coordinated and facilitated from the top down by a network of associates and employees. 


Combs' attorney Marc Agnifilo submitted a letter to Judge Andrew L. Carter on Wednesday seeking the release of Combs, 54, on conditions including home detention with GPS monitoring, along with a restriction on all visitors to his residences except for family, property caretakers and friends who are not considered co-conspirators. 


Combs' house is on Star Island, a man-made dollop of land in Biscayne Bay, reachable only by a causeway or boat. It is among the most expensive places to live in the United States. Combs' request echoes that of a long line of wealthy defendants who have offered to pay multimillion-dollar bails in exchange for home detention in luxurious surroundings. 


"Sean Combs has never evaded, avoided, eluded or run from a challenge in his life," the defense said in a court filing. "He will not start now." 


Combs was expected to reenter his not guilty plea in his initial appearance before Carter. 


So far, prosecutors have successfully argued that he is a danger to the community and a flight risk and should remain incarcerated until trial. 


For all the revelations that came with the unsealing of the indictment Tuesday, most of what it outlines had been described in a November lawsuit filed by his former longtime girlfriend and protege, the R&B singer Cassie, whose legal name is Cassandra Ventura. The suit was settled the following day, but its allegations have followed Combs since. 


Its descriptions of beatings, sexual assaults, silencing tactics and "Freak Offs" were echoed throughout the criminal indictment, though it did not use her name or the names of any other women. 


Agnifilo, also without naming Ventura but clearly referring to her, argued at Tuesday's arraignment that the entire criminal case is an outgrowth of one long-term, troubled-but-consensual relationship that faltered amid infidelity. 


The "Freak Offs," Agnifilo contended, were an expansion of that relationship, and not coercive. 


"Is it sex trafficking?" Agnifilo asked. "Not if everybody wants to be there." 


Prosecutors, however, portrayed the scope as far larger. They said in court papers that they had interviewed more than 50 victims and witnesses and expect the number to grow. 


Like many aging hip-hop figures — including many of those he beefed with in the bicoastal rap feuds of the 1990s alongside the Notorious B.I.G. — the Bad Boy Records founder Combs had established a gentler, more worldly public image. The doting father of seven children was a respected international businessman, whose annual "White Party" in the Hamptons was once a must-have invitation for the jet-setting elite. 


But prosecutors said he used the same companies, people and methods he used to build his business and cultural power to facilitate his crimes. They said they would prove it with financial, travel and billing records, electronic data and communications and videos of the "Freak Offs" to prove their case. 


The AP does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly, as Ventura did. 


Combs was arrested late Monday in a Manhattan hotel, roughly six months after federal authorities raided his luxurious homes in Los Angeles and Miami and revealed they were conducting a sex trafficking investigation. 


During the searches, law enforcement seized narcotics, videos of the "Freak Offs" and more than 1,000 bottles of baby oil and lubricant, according to prosecutors. They said agents also seized firearms and ammunition, including three AR-15s with defaced serial numbers. 


The indictment portrays Combs as so violent that he caused injuries that often took days or weeks to heal. His employees and associates sometimes witnessed his violence and kept victims from leaving or tracked down those who tried, the indictment said. 


A conviction on every charge in the indictment would require a mandatory 15 years in prison with the possibility of a life sentence. 


Combs and his attorneys denied similar allegations made by others in a string of lawsuits filed after Ventura's.

## False reports of explosives found in car near Trump rally spread online

date: 2024-09-18, from: VOA News USA

New York — Law enforcement officials on Long Island worked quickly on Wednesday to publicly knock down social media posts falsely reporting that explosives had been found in a car near former President Donald Trump's planned rally in New York.


The false reports of an explosive began circulating hours before the Republican presidential nominee's campaign event at Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, just days after he was apparently the target of a second possible assassination attempt.


Nassau County Police Commissioner Patrick Ryder said police questioned and detained a person who "may have been training a bomb detection dog," near the site of the rally and "falsely reported explosives being found."


Lt. Scott Skrynecki, a spokesperson for the county police, said in follow-up messages that the person, who police have not yet identified, was a civilian and not a member of a law enforcement agency.


He also said the person was not working at or affiliated with the event, which is expected to draw thousands of Trump supporters to the arena that was formerly the home of the NHL's New York Islanders.


The rally is Trump's first on Long Island, a suburban area just east of New York City, since 2017.


In 2020, President Joe Biden defeated Trump by a roughly 4% margin on Long Island, besting him in Nassau County by about 60,000 votes, though Trump carried neighboring Suffolk County by more than 200 votes.


Earlier Wednesday, Skrynecki and other county officials responded swiftly to knock down the online line claims, which appear to have started with a post from a reporter citing unnamed sources in the local police department.


The claims were then shared widely on X, formerly Twitter, by a number of prominent accounts, including that of the company's owner, Elon Musk, which has nearly 200 million followers. Spokespersons for X didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment.


"False," Skrynecki texted the AP as the claims spread.


"No. Ridiculous. Zero validity," said Christopher Boyle, spokesperson for Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman.

## Boeing to start temporary furloughs amid Seattle strike

date: 2024-09-18, from: VOA News USA

New York — Boeing said Wednesday it would start temporary furloughs of professional and white-collar staff as it seeks to conserve cash amid a labor strike that has shuttered Seattle manufacturing plants.


The furloughs, which pertain to executives, managers and workers, will be initiated in the coming days and affect tens of thousands of Boeing employees, company officials said.


Boeing plans for "selected employees to take one week of furlough every four weeks on a rolling basis for the duration of the strike," said a message to employees from CEO Kelly Ortberg.


The new Boeing boss added that he and the rest of the leadership team "will take a commensurate pay reduction for the duration of the strike."


Boeing had said that furloughs were on the table earlier in the week when it announced a hiring freeze, travel budget austerity measures and a reduction of supplier expenditures.


About 33,000 Seattle-area Boeing workers with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 751 walked off the job Friday after overwhelmingly rejecting a contract renewal.


The two sides resumed talks Tuesday with the assistance of mediators from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service.


The IAM blasted Boeing in a bargaining update posted late Tuesday.


"We are frustrated," the IAM said. "The company was not prepared and was unwilling to address the issues you've made clear are essential for ending this strike: Wages and Pension. The company doesn't seem to be taking mediation seriously."


Ortberg's message to employees reiterated his commitment to "resetting our relationship with our represented employees and continuing discussions with the union to reach a new agreement that is good for all of our teammates and our company as soon as possible."

## Two years after Mahsa Amini's death, Western allies sanction dozen Iranian officials

date: 2024-09-18, from: VOA News USA

Washington  — The U.S., Canada and Australia hit a group of Iranian officials with sanctions Wednesday for their participation in suppressing protests and detaining people in relation to the death of Mahsa Amini, an Iranian woman who died in the custody of Iran's morality police two years ago for improperly wearing a mandatory headscarf.


Amini, 22, died on Sept. 16, 2022, in a hospital after being arrested for allegedly not wearing her mandatory headscarf, or hijab, to the liking of the authorities. Her death sparked nationwide protests against the country's hijab laws and its ruling theocracy.


Included in Wednesday's sanctions are a dozen officials accused of killing and detaining protesters, suppressing protests in 2019 and 2022 and arresting journalists.


The country's new reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian campaigned on a promise to halt the harassment of women by morality police. Still, since Amini's death, videos have emerged of women and girls being roughed up by officers.


In 2023, a teenage Iranian girl was injured in a mysterious incident on Tehran's Metro while not wearing a headscarf and later died in the hospital. In July, activists say police opened fire on a woman fleeing a checkpoint in an attempt to avoid her car being impounded for her not wearing the hijab.


U.S. Treasury official Bradley T. Smith said, "Despite the Iranian people's peaceful calls for reform, Iran's leaders have doubled down on the regime's well-worn tactics of violence and coercion." The U.S. and its allies "will continue to take action to expose and hold accountable those responsible for carrying out the Iranian regime's cruel agenda," Smith said.


The sanctions, which block access to U.S. property and bank accounts and prevent the targeted people and companies from doing business with the U.S. are largely symbolic since many of the individuals do not interact with the U.S.


In March, a United Nations fact-finding mission determined that Iran is responsible for the "physical violence" that led to the death of Amini. It also found that the Islamic Republic employed "unnecessary and disproportionate use of lethal force" to put down the demonstrations that erupted following Amini's death and that Iranian security forces sexually assaulted detainees.


Increasingly, on the streets of Iranian cities, it's becoming more common to see a woman passing by without a mandatory headscarf.

## US targets second major Chinese hacking group

date: 2024-09-18, from: VOA News USA

Washington — The United States has identified and taken down a botnet campaign by China-directed hackers to further infiltrate American infrastructure as well as a variety of internet-connected devices.


FBI Director Christopher Wray announced the disruption of what he called Flax Typhoon during a cyber summit Wednesday in Washington, describing it as part of a much larger campaign by Beijing.


“Flax Typhoon hijacked Internet-of-Things devices like cameras, video recorders and storage devices — things typically found across both big and small organizations,” Wray said. “And about half of those hijacked devices were located here in the U.S.”


Wray said the hackers, working under the guise of an information security company called the Integrity Technology Group, collected information from corporations, media organizations, universities and government agencies.


“They used internet-connected devices — this time, hundreds of thousands of them — to create a botnet that helped them compromise systems and exfiltrate confidential data,” he said.


But Flax Typhoon’s operations were disrupted last week when the FBI, working with allies and under court orders, took control of the botnet and pursued the hackers when they tried to switch to a backup system.


“We think the bad guys finally realized that it was the FBI and our partners that they were up against,” Wray said. “And with that realization, they essentially burned down their new infrastructure and abandoned their botnet.”


Wray said Flax Typhoon appeared to build on the exploits and tactics of another China-linked hacking group, known as Volt Typhoon, which was identified by Microsoft in May of last year.


Volt Typhoon used office network equipment, including routers, firewalls and VPN hardware, to infiltrate and disrupt communications infrastructure in Guam, home to key U.S. military facilities.


The Chinese Embassy in Washington Wednesday rejected the U.S accusations.


"Without valid evidence, the U.S. jumped to an unwarranted conclusion and made groundless accusations" Chinese Embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu told VOA in an email, responding to the allegations about Flax Typhoon.


"The U.S. itself is the origin and the biggest perpetrator of cyberattacks," Liu added. "We urge the U.S. to stop its worldwide cyber espionage and cyberattacks, and stop smearing other countries under the excuse of cyber security."


The FBI and the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency have previously warned that Chinese-government directed hackers, like Volt Typhoon, have been positioning themselves to launch destructive cyberattacks that could jeopardize the physical safety of Americans.


Following Wednesday’s announcement by the FBI, the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) issued an advisory encouraging anyone with a device that was compromised by Flax Typhoon to apply needed patches.


It said that as of this past June, the Flax Typhoon botnet was making use of more than 260,000 devices in North America, Europe, Africa and Southeast East.


The NSA said almost half of the compromised devices were in the U.S. Another 18 countries, including Vietnam, Bangladesh, Albania, China, South Africa and India, were also impacted.

## US Justice Department sues over Baltimore bridge collapse and seeks $100 million in cleanup costs

date: 2024-09-18, from: VOA News USA

BALTIMORE — The U.S. Justice Department on Wednesday sued the owner and manager of the cargo ship that caused the Baltimore bridge collapse, seeking to recover more than $100 million that the government spent to clear the underwater debris and reopen the city's port. 


The lawsuit filed in Maryland alleges that the electrical and mechanical systems on the ship, the Dali, were improperly maintained, causing it to lose power and veer off course before striking a support column on the Francis Scott Key Bridge in March. 


"This tragedy was entirely avoidable," according to the lawsuit. 


The collapse snarled commercial shipping traffic through the Port of Baltimore for months before the channel was fully opened in June. 


"With this civil claim, the Justice Department is working to ensure that the costs of clearing the channel and reopening the Port of Baltimore are borne by the companies that caused the crash, not by the American taxpayer," Attorney General Merrick Garland said in written statement. 


The case was filed against Dali owner Grace Ocean Private Ltd. and manager Synergy Marine Group, both of Singapore. The companies filed a court petition days after the collapse seeking to limit their legal liability in what could become the most expensive marine casualty case in history. 


The ship was leaving Baltimore bound for Sri Lanka when its steering failed because of the power loss. Six members of a road work crew on the bridge were killed in the collapse. The men were working an overnight shift filling potholes on the bridge deck when it suddenly crumbled beneath them, sending them tumbling into the water. 


"This accident happened because of the careless and grossly negligent decisions made by Grace Ocean and Synergy, who recklessly chose to send an unseaworthy vessel to navigate a critical waterway and ignored the risks to American lives and the nation's infrastructure," said Chetan Patil, the acting deputy assistant attorney general. 


On Tuesday, the victims' families declared their intent to file a claim seeking to hold the ship's owner and manager fully liable for the disaster. Several other interested parties, including city officials and local businesses, have filed opposing claims accusing the companies of negligence. 


The families are also calling for more robust workplace protections, especially for immigrant workers. All the victims were Latino immigrants who came to the United States in search of better-paying jobs and opportunities.

## US now allows passport renewals online

date: 2024-09-18, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Americans can now renew their passports online, bypassing a cumbersome mail-in paper application process that often caused delays.


The U.S. State Department announced Wednesday that its online passport renewal system is now fully operational.


"By offering this online alternative to the traditional paper application process, the Department is embracing digital transformation to offer the most efficient and convenient passport renewal experience possible," Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement.


After staffing shortages caused mainly by the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in lengthy passport processing delays, the department ramped up hiring and introduced other technological improvements that have reduced wait times by about one-third over last year. It says most applications are now completed in far less than the advertised six to eight weeks. The online renewal system is expected to further reduce that.


The system will allow renewal applicants to skip the current process, which requires them to print out and send paper applications and a check by mail and submit their documents and payment through a secure website, www.Travel.State.Gov/renewonline.

## Reinventing the Clock: NASA’s New Tech for Space Timekeeping

date: 2024-09-18, from: NASA breaking news

Here on Earth, it might not matter if your wristwatch runs a few seconds slow. But crucial spacecraft functions need accuracy down to one billionth of a second or less. Navigating with GPS, for example, relies on precise timing signals from satellites to pinpoint locations. Three teams at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, are at work to push timekeeping for space exploration to new levels of precision.

<p>Today, the Federal Reserve will announce what it will do with the interest rates that steer the economy. It&#8217;ll cut them — that&#8217;s almost certain, but the question is how aggressively. The Fed is independent. Fed Chairs generally refuse to get dragged into politics, though their decisions can be politicized. We&#8217;ll look at the politics of rate decisions.

## Intel to spin off its chipmaking business

date: 2024-09-18, from: OS News

Intel&#8217;s woes are far from over. Pat Gelsinger, the company&#8217;s CEO, has announced that Intel&#8217;s chipmaking business will be spun off and turned into a separate company. A subsidiary structure will unlock important benefits. It provides our external foundry customers and suppliers with clearer separation and independence from the rest of Intel. Importantly, it also gives us future flexibility to evaluate independent sources of funding and optimize the capital structure of each business to maximize growth and shareholder value creation. There is no change to our Intel Foundry leadership team, which continues to report to me. We will also establish an operating board that includes independent directors to govern the subsidiary. This supports our continued focus on driving greater transparency, optimization and accountability across the business. ↫ Pat Gelsinger This is a big move, and illustrated the difficulties Intel is facing. Its foundry business lost $7 billion last year, and it&#8217;s cutting 15% of its workforce &#8211; 15000 people &#8211; indicating it needs to do something to turn the ship around. Intel is also pausing construction on two additional plants in Europe, but will continue its expansion efforts in the United States. Bitter note is that Intel received a massive cash injection from the US Biden administration, yet then proceeds to fire 15000 people. Socialism for the rich, capitalism for the poor.

## Google wins challenge against $1.66B EU antitrust fine

date: 2024-09-18, from: VOA News USA

BRUSSELS — Alphabet unit Google won its challenge on Wednesday against a $1.66 billion antitrust fine imposed five years ago for hindering rivals in online search advertising, a week after it lost a much bigger case. 


The European Commission, in its 2019 decision, said Google had abused its dominance to prevent websites from using brokers other than its AdSense platform that provided search adverts. The practices it said were illegal took place from 2006 to 2016.


The Luxembourg-based General Court mostly agreed with the European Union competition enforcer's assessments of the case, but annulled the fine.


"The court [...] upheld most of the commission's assessments, but annulled the decision imposing a fine of almost 1.5 billion euros [$1.66 billion] on Google, on the grounds in particular that it had failed to take into account all the relevant circumstances in its assessment of the duration of the contractual clauses that it had found to be unfair," the judges said.


The AdSense fine, one of a trio of fines that have cost Google a total of some $9 billion, was triggered by a complaint from Microsoft in 2010.


Google has said it changed the targeted contracts in 2016 before the Commission's decision.


The company last week lost its final fight against a $2.6 billion fine levied for using its price comparison shopping service to gain an unfair advantage over smaller European rivals.

## Why Geothermal Is So Hot Right Now

	Geothermal is getting closer to the big time. Last week, Fervo Energy — arguably the country’s leading enhanced geothermal company — 
	<a href="https://fervoenergy.com/fervo-energys-record-breaking-production-results-showcase-rapid-scale-up-of-enhanced-geothermal/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>announced</u></a> that its Utah demonstration project had achieved record production capacity.

Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p><blockquote>
<strong>Robinson Meyer:</strong> I just wanted to hit a different note here, which is, Sarah, you’ve alluded a few times to your past in the oil and gas industry. I think this is true across Fervo, is that of course, the technologies we’re discussing here are fracking derived. What has your background in the oil and gas industry and hydrocarbons taught you that you think about at Fervo now, and developing geothermal as a resource?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Sarah Jewett:</strong> There are so many things. I mean, I’m thinking about my time in the oil and gas industry daily. And you’re exactly right, I think today about 60% of Fervo’s employees come from the oil and gas industry. And because we are only just about to start construction on our first power facility, the percentage of contractors and field workers from the oil and gas industry is much higher than 60%.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Jesse Jenkins: </strong>Right, you can’t go and hire a bunch of people with geothermal experience when there is no large-scale geothermal industry to pull from.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Jewett: </strong>That’s right. That’s right. And so the oil and gas industry, I think, has taught us, so many different types of things. I mean, we can’t really exist without thinking about the history of the oil and gas industry — even, you know, Wilson and I are sort of comparing our learning rates to learning rates observed in various different oil and gas basins by different operators, so you can see a lot of prior technological pathways.<br/>
<br/>
	I mean, first off, we’re just using off the shelf technology that has been proven and tested in the oil and gas industry over the last 25 years, which has been, really, the reason why geothermal is able to have this big new unlock, because we’re using all of this off the shelf technology that now exists. It’s not like the early 2000s, where there was a single bit we could have tried. Now there are a ton of different bits that are available to us that we can try and say, how is this working? How is <em><em>this</em></em> working? How’s this working?<br/>
<br/>
	So I think, from a technological perspective, it’s helpful. And then from just an industry that has set a solid example it’s been really helpful, and that can be leveraged in a number of different ways. Learning rates, for example; how to set up supply chains in remote areas, for example; how to engage with and interact with communities. I think we’ve seen examples of oil and gas doing that well and doing it poorly. And I’ve gotten to observe firsthand the oil and gas industry doing it well and doing it poorly.<br/>
<br/>
	And so I’ve gotten to learn a lot about how we need to treat those around us, explain to them what it is that we’re doing, how open we need to be. And I think that has been immensely helpful as we’ve crafted the role that we’re going to play in these communities at large.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Wilson Ricks: </strong>I think it’s also interesting to talk about the connection to the oil and gas industry from the perspective of the political economy of the energy transition, specifically because you hear policymakers talk all the time about retraining workers from these legacy industries that, if we’re serious about decarbonizing, will unavoidably have to contract — and, you know, getting those people involved in clean energy, in these new industries.<br/>
<br/>
	And often that’s taking drillers and retraining some kind of very different job — or coal miners — into battery manufacturers. This is almost exactly one to one. Like Sarah said, there’s additional expertise and experience that you need to get really good at doing this in the geothermal context. But for the most part, you are taking the exact same skills and just reapplying them, and so it allows for both a potentially very smooth transition of workforces, and also it allows for scale-up of enhanced geothermal to proceed much more smoothly than it potentially would if you had to kind of train an entire workforce from scratch to just do this.</blockquote><div class="horizontal-rule"></div><p>This episode of Shift Key is sponsored by …</p><p><strong>Watershed</strong>’s climate data engine helps companies measure and reduce their emissions, turning the data they already have into an audit-ready carbon footprint backed by the latest climate science.

## Iconic US container firm Tupperware files for bankruptcy

date: 2024-09-18, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Tupperware Brands and some of its subsidiaries filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Tuesday, the food container firm said in a statement.


The company, known for its trademark food storage containers, has been hit by dwindling sales in recent years.


Last year the New York Stock Exchange-listed firm warned of "substantial doubt" about its ability to keep operating in light of its poor financial position.


"Over the last several years, the company's financial position has been severely impacted by the challenging macroeconomic environment," president and CEO Laurie Ann Goldman said in a statement announcing the bankruptcy filing.


"As a result, we explored numerous strategic options and determined this is the best path forward," added Goldman.


The company said it would seek court approval for a sale process for the business to protect its brand and "further advance Tupperware's transformation into a digital-first, technology-led company."


The Orlando, Florida-based firm said it would also seek approval to continue operating during bankruptcy proceedings and would continue to pay its employees and suppliers.


"We plan to continue serving our valued customers with the high-quality products they love and trust throughout this process," Goldman said.


The firm's shares were trading at $0.5099 Monday, well down from $2.55 in December last year.


Tupperware said it had implemented a strategic plan to modernize its operations and drive efficiencies to ignite growth following the appointment of a new management team last year.


"The company has made significant progress and intends to continue this important transformation work."


In its filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, Tupperware listed assets of between $500 million and $1 billion and liabilities of between $1 billion and $10 billion.


The filing also said it had between 50,000 and 100,000 creditors.


Tupperware, whose name became synonymous with its airtight plastic containers, in recent years lost popularity with consumers and an initiative to gain distribution through big-box chain store Target failed to reverse its fortunes.


The company's roots date to 1946, when chemist Earl Tupper "had a spark of inspiration while creating molds at a plastics factory shortly after the Great Depression," according to Tupperware's website.


"If he could design an airtight seal for plastic storage containers, like those on a paint can, he could help war-weary families save money on costly food waste."


Over time, Tupper's hermetically sealed plastic containers also became associated with "Tupperware Parties," where friends would gather with food and drink as a company representative demonstrated the items.

## US decision on Nippon bid for US Steel pushed to after election, sources say

date: 2024-09-18, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON/TOKYO — The U.S. national security panel reviewing Nippon Steel's $14.9 billion bid for U.S. Steel let the companies refile their application for approval of the deal, a person familiar with the matter said, delaying a decision on the politically sensitive merger until after the Nov. 5 presidential election.


The move offers a ray of hope for the companies, whose proposed tie-up appeared set to be blocked when the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) alleged on Aug. 31 the transaction posed a risk to national security by threatening the steel supply chain for critical U.S. industries.


CFIUS needs more time to understand the deal's impact on national security and engage with the parties, the person said on Tuesday. Refiling sets a new 90-day clock to review the proposed tie-up and make a decision.


The review was expected to take close to the full 90 days, another person familiar with the matter said.


Nippon Steel declined to comment. CFIUS and U.S. Steel did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Reuters.


"Extending the timeline takes pressure off the parties and, importantly, pushes the decision past the election in November," said Nick Klein, a CFIUS lawyer with DLA Piper.


The deal has become a political hot potato. This month, Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, said at a rally in Pennsylvania, the swing state where U.S. Steel is headquartered, that she wants U.S. Steel to remain "American owned and operated," echoing a view held by President Joe Biden.


The White House reiterated that position on Tuesday.


Harris' Republican rival Donald Trump has pledged to block the deal if elected. Both candidates have sought to woo union votes.


Postponing the decision to after the U.S. elections will “dial down” the political temperature but does not guarantee approval, said David Boling, a former U.S. trade official who is now an analyst at Eurasia Group.


"Regardless of the CFIUS review, Nippon Steel still must reach an agreement with the United Steelworkers," Boling said. "Without that, it's very hard to see this deal happening."


The United Steelworkers Union, which vehemently opposes the deal, said on Tuesday "nothing has changed regarding the risks that Nippon's acquisition would pose to national security or the critical supply chain concerns that have already been identified."


The deal is being closely watched in Japan, a close U.S. ally and its biggest foreign investor.


"Further strengthening economic relations, including expanding mutual investment between Japan and the U.S., are essential for both countries," Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Moriya told reporters on Wednesday.


Nippon Steel shares were up 1.1% in afternoon trading in Tokyo. U.S. Steel shares closed down 0.4% on Tuesday.


CFIUS is concerned Nippon Steel's merger could hurt the supply of steel needed for critical transportation, construction and agriculture projects, it said in its August letter to the companies, exclusively obtained by Reuters.


It also cited a global glut of cheap Chinese steel, and said that under Nippon, a Japanese company, U.S. Steel would be less likely to seek tariffs on foreign steel importers. It added that decisions by Nippon could "lead to a reduction in domestic steel production capacity."


In a 100-page response letter to CFIUS, also exclusively obtained by Reuters, Nippon Steel said it will invest billions of dollars in U.S. Steel facilities that otherwise would have been idled, "indisputably" allowing it to "maintain and potentially increase domestic steelmaking capacity in the United States."


The company also reaffirmed a promise not to transfer any U.S. Steel production capacity or jobs outside the U.S. and would not interfere in any of U.S. Steel's decisions on trade matters, including decisions to pursue trade measures under U.S. law against unfair trade practices.


The deal, Nippon added, would "create a stronger global competitor to China grounded in the close relationship between the United States and Japan."


Robust CFIUS reviews take 90 days but it is common for companies to withdraw their filings and resubmit them to give them more time to address the panel's concerns.


According to CFIUS's 2023 annual report, 18% of companies seeking deal approval refiled their applications last year. Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel filed for the review in March, and CFIUS allowed them to refile in June, starting a second 90-day clock that runs out on Sept. 23, Reuters reported on Friday.


In December, CFIUS could approve the deal, possibly with measures to address national security concerns, recommend that the president block it, or extend the timetable again.

## US Air Force general: Russia military larger, better than before Ukraine invasion

date: 2024-09-18, from: VOA News USA

PENTAGON — Russia's military is bigger and stronger than it was prior to invading Ukraine in February 2022, the commander of United States Air Forces in Europe and Africa cautioned Tuesday.


"Russia is getting larger, and they're getting better than they were before. … They are actually larger than they were when [the invasion] kicked off," Air Force General James Hecker told reporters at the Air & Space Forces Association's annual Air, Space & Cyber Conference.


The improvements come despite heavy casualties inflicted by Ukraine. U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin has estimated that since 2022, more than 350,000 Russian troops have been killed or wounded.


"The rates of casualties that they're experiencing are staggering," Pentagon press secretary Major General Pat Ryder told reporters Tuesday in response to a question from VOA.


On Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered that the Russian army grow by 180,000 active-duty troops for a total of 1.5 million soldiers, making Russia's military the second largest in the world, behind China's.


"Russia is going to be something that we're going to have to deal with for a long time, no matter how this thing ends," Hecker said.


However, William Pomeranz, a senior scholar at the Kennan Institute, told VOA that "this move suggests that Vladimir Putin is losing the war."


"This is an open signal from Vladimir Putin that his army and his military is in trouble and doesn't have the resources to maintain troops in the field," Pomeranz said.


Despite Russian improvements on the battlefield, Ukraine has continued to put chinks in Russia's armor, shooting down more than 100 Russian aircraft since Moscow began its full-scale invasion, which amounts to dozens more aircraft than Russia has been able to down on the Ukrainian side, according to General Hecker.


"So what we see is the aircraft are kind of staying on their own side of the line, if you will, and when that happens, you have a war like we're seeing today, with massive attrition, cities just being demolished, a lot of civilian casualties," he said.


To gain even the slightest advantages in a war where no clear side dominates the skies, Ukraine has turned to low-cost solutions that also appeal to the U.S. military.


"We have to get on the right side of the cost curve with this. Taking down $10,000, $15,000, $20,000 one-way UAVs [drones] with $1 million missiles, we just can't afford to do that in the long-term," the general told reporters. 


General Chance Saltzman, the chief of the U.S. Space Force, announced Tuesday that a Space Force pilot program that uses commercial satellite imagery and related analytics to create more situational awareness for military leaders has proven very cost-effective when compared with traditional intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance collection via U.S. MQ-9 drones, which are expensive and limited in number.


AFRICOM was able to use the $40 million Tactical Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Tracking Program to maintain situational awareness during the full withdrawal of U.S. forces from two air bases in Niger in July and August. The drawback, however, was that instead of real-time situational awareness, the data took one to four hours to get to the security team.


"Not as good as real time, right? With MQ-9 that you would have, but it's better than nothing, right?" Hecker said.


Hecker also said the U.S. was looking into more cost-effective ways to sense incoming threats around bases, including methods like Ukraine's Sky Fortress system that uses thousands of inexpensive sensors to identify aerial threats. He says the technology has been demonstrated in Romania and other countries.

## China’s influence campaign intensifies as US election nears

date: 2024-09-18, from: VOA News USA

washington — At first glance, Noah R. Smith might seem like your typical social media user. His bio says he’s a father, a former “Track and Field representative,” and a current member of the PanAm Sports organization.


On July 14, a day after the first assassination attempt on Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, Smith shared three posts from an account named “TRUMP WON.”




One post declared, “AMERICA was attacked today … we must get it together. It’s literally a matter of life and death,” accompanied by an image depicting a divine hand halting a bullet aimed at Trump.


Another post urged “all MAGA GOD Fearing Patriots” to connect, stating, “Grow These Accounts, UNITED We Are Strong.”


While it might seem that Smith is a devoted Trump supporter, closer inspection suggests otherwise. His cover photo features Chinese watermarks, his profile picture is sourced from a company that provides photos, videos and music, and his bio is lifted from an authentic account named Laurel R. Smith.


In reality, Noah R. Smith is impersonating a U.S. voter who supports Trump. A joint investigation by VOA Mandarin and Doublethink Lab (DTL), a Taiwanese social media analytics firm, uncovered 10 such accounts on X.


These accounts are linked to China’s Spamouflage network — a state-sponsored operation aimed at supporting the Chinese government and undermining its critics. This network was first identified by social media analytics company Graphika in 2019 and was used to target Hong Kong pro-democracy protesters at that time.


Following the assassination attempt on July 14, the accounts began promoting pro-Trump content. Previously, they shared material consistent with Spamouflage’s broader interests: defending China, criticizing U.S. foreign policy, and exploiting divisive domestic issues such as gun violence and racial tensions.


DTL labeled this network of accounts posing as Americans “MAGAflage 1,” because they all seem to be promoting Trump’s slogan “Make America Great Again [MAGA].”


“The MAGAflage accounts are different because they are not just criticizing stuff. They are amplifying positive content about Trump,” Jasper Hewitt, a digital intelligence analyst at Doublethink Lab, told VOA Mandarin.


He added that it’s too early to draw conclusions about whom China is supporting, as researchers are still tracking accounts that criticize both Republican candidate Donald Trump and Democratic candidate Kamala Harris.


“Engaging with the MAGA movement, or any part of the political spectrum, might merely be a new attempt to generate authentic traffic,” Hewitt told VOA.


The first MAGAflage network was discovered by Elise Thomas, a senior analyst at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, in April 2024. This network focuses on promoting positive content of Trump. She told VOA earlier that by wrapping a topic in a U.S. partisan political frame, these accounts got “a reasonable amount of engagement from real American users.”




Limited influence 


The VOA Mandarin investigation revealed that the accounts operate in coordination. Six out of the 10 accounts were created in 2015 but had their first visible posts on May 18 or May 19, 2022.


The batch accounts — the 10 new accounts — are not very active. Each account has roughly 100 posts or reposts over the last two years. The batch accounts were inactive for one year but were awoken after the first Trump assassination attempt.


Additionally, these accounts occasionally post or repost Chinese content.


For example, an account named Super-Rabbit shared praise for China's political and economic model from state-linked influencers like Shanghai Panda and Xinhua News Agency’s reporter Li Zexin. One post from September 3 contrasted U.S. President Joe Biden’s inactivity with China’s President Xi Jinping’s engagement in Africa.


“When Joe Biden is sitting on the beach wasted away, China’s President Xi is shaking hands with various African leaders and making a better impact in Africa,” the post said.




VOA contacted the Trump and Harris campaigns for comment but did not receive a response as of publication time.


Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, told VOA in a statement that “China has no intention and will not interfere in the U.S. election, and we hope that the U.S. side will not make an issue of China in the election.”


So far, the newly discovered MAGAflage 1 accounts have had limited influence, with only a handful of followers and minimal interactions.


U.S. intelligence agencies issued their latest assessment earlier this month, warning that Russia, Iran, and China are intensifying efforts to influence the U.S. presidential election.


While Russia remains the primary concern, officials noted that Chinese online influence actors have “continued small scale efforts on social media to engage U.S. audiences on divisive political issues, including protests about the Israel-Gaza conflict and promote negative stories about both political parties.”

## Senate Republicans again block legislation to guarantee rights to IVF

date: 2024-09-18, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Republicans have blocked for a second time this year legislation to establish a nationwide right to in vitro fertilization, arguing that the vote is an election-year stunt after Democrats forced a vote on the issue.


The Senate vote was Democrats' latest attempt to force Republicans into a defensive stance on women's health issues and highlight policy differences between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump in the presidential race, especially as Trump has called himself a "leader on IVF."


The 51-44 vote was short of the 60 votes needed to move forward on the bill, with only two Republicans voting in favor. Democrats say Republicans who insist they support IVF are being hypocritical because they won't support legislation guaranteeing a right to it.


"They say they support IVF — here you go, vote on this," said Illinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth, the bill's lead sponsor and a military veteran who has used the fertility treatment to have her two children.


The Democratic push started earlier this year after the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos can be considered children under state law. Several clinics in the state suspended IVF treatments until the GOP-led legislature rushed to enact a law to provide legal protections for the clinics.


Democrats quickly capitalized, holding a vote in June on Duckworth's bill and warning that the U.S. Supreme Court could go after the procedure after it overturned the right to an abortion in 2022.


The bill would establish a nationwide right for patients to access IVF and other assisted reproductive technologies and a right for doctors and insurance companies to provide it, an effort to pre-empt state efforts to limit the services. It would also require more health insurers to cover it and expand coverage for military service members and veterans.


In a statement after the vote, Harris said Republicans in Congress "have once again made clear that they will not protect access to the fertility treatments many couples need to fulfill their dream of having a child."


Republican vice presidential candidate and Ohio Sen. JD Vance, who missed the vote because he was campaigning, said during a stop in Wisconsin that the measure was not a serious IVF bill, but a measure designed to make Republicans look bad.


"The Senate blocked a ridiculous showboat bill that had no chance of passing," Vance said.


Republicans argued that the federal government shouldn't tell states what to do and that the bill was an unserious effort. Only Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska voted with Democrats to move forward on the bill both times.


South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the No. 2 Senate Republican, said that Democrats are trying to create a political issue "where there isn't one."


"Let me remind everybody that Republicans support IVF, full stop," Thune said just before the vote.

## US lawmakers welcome Russian activist freed in August prisoner swap

date: 2024-09-18, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — U.S. lawmakers welcomed Vladimir Kara-Murza to Capitol Hill Tuesday, celebrating the release of the Russian activist from a Kremlin prison last month. 


Kara-Murza was part of the biggest prisoner exchange between the U.S. and Russia since the end of the Cold War. 

 

Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Ben Cardin said Tuesday that Kara-Murza "was at the forefront of the human rights struggle and an inspiration for so many people around the world." 

 

In a letter written upon Kara-Murza's release, Cardin said, "Your return home is both a personal victory and a testament to the unwavering strength of the human spirit." 

 

Democratic Representative Bill Keating described Kara-Murza as one of the people Russian President Vladimir Putin most despises because of his ability to speak directly to the Russian people. Kara-Murza has twice survived suspected poisoning attempts. 

 

Kara-Murza, a deputy leader of the People's Freedom Party, was arrested in Russia in April 2022 and later faced charges of treason and spreading disinformation about the Russian military. Russian prosecutors suggested he face the maximum 25-year sentence in a prison colony. 

 

Kara-Murza was awarded the Václav Havel Human Rights Prize by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in October 2022 and the Pulitzer Prize for commentary in 2024. 

 

"Surreal doesn't come close to describing what I feel — just a few weeks ago sitting in a maximum-security prison in Siberia and now seeing so many friends in the halls of the U.S. Congress," Kara-Murza told a gathering of lawmakers, journalists and activists on Capitol Hill. 

 

Kara-Murza thanked the public for keeping their attention focused on his situation.


"The only way we will be able to achieve long-term peace, stability, security and democracy on the European continent will be with a peaceful, free and democratic Russia," he said.


The Biden administration secured the release of 16 detainees in return for the release of eight detainees and two minors on Aug. 1.


James O'Brien, assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, thanked Kara-Murza for his work on the Global Magnitsky Act, bipartisan legislation that authorizes the U.S. government to sanction government officials throughout the world who are human rights offenders.


"Vladimir, you gave us one of the main tools that we use to focus our advocacy for your freedom in the Global Magnitsky Act, and your work on that, I'm sure you didn't do it as a tool for yourself, but your work on that has helped us enormously as we work to free prisoners in the Western Hemisphere, in other countries across the world," O'Brien said.


Democratic Senator Chris Coons said Putin is still holding untold numbers of political prisoners in Russia.


"We must realize [Putin] does that, like all authoritarians, because he's afraid, afraid of his own people, afraid of accountability, afraid of the Ukrainians who just on the border of Russia are fighting with determination," Coons said.

## Experts say voters should feel confident in US elections this year

date: 2024-09-18, from: VOA News USA

washington — American voters face a challenging duality as they count down the days until November's presidential election: a security landscape that officials say has become ever more dangerous even as the infrastructure to hold elections has become ever-more secure. 


The run-up to the 2024 election has seen the "most complex threat landscape yet," according to Cait Conley, a senior adviser at the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the government body responsible for overseeing election security. 


"We do see a growing and diverse array of foreign adversaries, foreign actors, trying to disrupt our elections," Conley said Tuesday, speaking at Politico's AI and Tech Summit in Washington.  


But U.S. voters should feel confident, she added. 


"We have been surging resources," Conley said. "We have seen tremendous investment and progress in ensuring the full spectrum of security and resilience of our election infrastructure." 


Nevertheless, Conley and other U.S. officials acknowledge the dangers are widespread, often extending beyond the voting booth. 


Physical threats 


The FBI and U.S. Postal Service said Tuesday they are investigating suspicious packages sent to election workers in at least 12 states. 


CISA officials have reported a growing number of swatting incidents — false reports to emergency services about violence or an emergency at a home or other location — targeting election workers. 


And the number of direct threats is rising rapidly. 


"We are seeing an unprecedented and extremely disturbing level of threats of violence, and violence, against public officials," said U.S. Deputy General Lisa Monaco, also speaking at the summit in Washington.  


"For sure weekly and, sometimes, daily," Monaco said of the frequency of the threats. 


Many of the threats target officials responsible for conducting elections. 


"These are people who are simply volunteering their time to help all of us undertake the most fundamental right," she said. "These are people who are being threatened simply for doing their job." 


Officials also warn that other public servants are getting a growing number of threats, including law enforcement officers, prosecutors and elected officials and candidates. 


"It's serious," said Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, citing Sunday's apparent assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump as he played golf at his course in West Palm Beach, Florida. 


He also pointed to the rash of threats in Springfield, Ohio, following the spread of unsubstantiated rumors about Haitian immigrants eating pets.




"We are in a heightened threat environment … a threat environment that is of deep concern," Mayorkas said. "It requires vigilance at every level of government and frankly on every block of each community across this country." 


Concerns about the heightened threat environment are not new. 


Homeland Security officials have been warning of the dangers since at least January 2021, saying lone offenders or small groups could be motivated to carry out attacks motivated by a range of political and personal grievances.




Only now, high emotions over the election combined with efforts by U.S. adversaries are fueling discontent and anger that could lead to more attacks. 


Cyber operations 


"When it comes to malign influence campaigns, we are seeing a very aggressive set of actors," Monaco said. 


Many of the efforts to sow discord have originated in Russia and Iran, and to a lesser extent China.  But they are far from alone. 




"We're seeing more actors in this space acting more aggressively in a more polarized environment and doing more with technologies, in particular AI," Monaco said.  


Earlier this month, the U.S. Justice Department took action against what it said were two Russian plots to spread disinformation, taking down 32 fake news websites while bringing charges against two employees of Russia-backed media outlet RT, accusing them of funneling nearly $10 million to a U.S. company to promote material favorable to the Russian government. 




And last week, the U.S. State Department accused a number of Russian media companies, including RT, of working directly for Russia's intelligence agencies – charges Russia and RT denied. 




US preparations 


The best defense, Monaco said, is for U.S. voters to be careful about where they get their information. 


"We have to be very vigilant on what we are consuming," she said. 


Experts like Margaret Talev, who directs the Syracuse University Institute for Democracy, Journalism and Citizenship in Washington, agree. 


Voters should "take a pause. Take a minute," Talev told VOA. "It involves all of us teaching ourselves, taking our time and trying to verify information from multiple sources rather than just believing the first thing that we see." 


The National Association of Secretaries of State (NASS), whose members play key roles in running elections, has also sought to make getting verified information easier, pushing a social media campaign it calls #TrustedInfo2024. 


NASS says its goal is "to promote election officials as the trusted sources of election information during the 2024 election cycle and beyond." 


And CISA, the cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency, has been working with election officials across the country to make sure they are ready for almost any contingency. 




CISA officials have also tried to rein in the hype about the dangers of AI, or artificial intelligence, blamed for helping U.S. adversaries to spread disinformation more effectively. 


"Generative AI is not going to fundamentally introduce new threats to this election cycle," the agency's Conley told VOA earlier this month.




While AI is exacerbating existing threats, so far it has not produced anything elections officials have not already seen. 


"This threat vector is not new to them," Conley said. "And they have taken the measures to ensure they're prepared to respond effectively."

## Bluesky’s Current Efforts on Trust and Safety

<https://bsky.social/about/blog/09-18-2024-trust-safety-update>
