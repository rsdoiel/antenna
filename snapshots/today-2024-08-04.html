id="kamala-harris-can-be-the-pro-innovation-president-silicon-valley-needs">Kamala
Harris Can Be the Pro-Innovation President Silicon Valley Needs</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-04, from: Ben Werdmuller’s blog</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div class=&quot;known-bookmark&quot;&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;e-content&quot;&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
[<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/03/opinion/kamala-harris-innovation-technology.html">Reid
Hoffman in the New York Times</a>]
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“As Vice President Harris defines her vision for how best to lead the
United States in this moment in time, she has an opportunity to take the
torch passed to her by President Biden in an explicitly pro-innovation
direction. Instead of governing by tweet, Mr. Biden passed bipartisan
legislation like the Inflation Reduction Act and the Infrastructure
Investment and Jobs Act that authorized hundreds of billions of dollars
for new manufacturing construction and investment.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman explains why Silicon Valley should get
behind Harris, counter to the example set by Musk, Andreessen, and a few
others. Hoffman is a co-signatory of VCs for Kamala, which makes clear
that most Silicon Valley funders are in favor of the Democratic
candidate and current Vice President.
</p>
<p>
Hoffman make the case clearly:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“Under the Biden-Harris administration, U.S. stock market indexes hit
all-time highs, with the S&amp;P 500 increasing by 48 percent.
Unemployment dropped below 4 percent. The number of U.S. manufacturing
jobs hit its highest level since 2008. While Mr. Trump’s great ambition
was to build a big beautiful border wall, Mr. Biden actually secured the
necessary funding to build large-scale factories for manufacturing
semiconductors, electric vehicles, batteries, solar cells and more. And
we’re now constructing them at stunning rates.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I’m more pro-regulation than Hoffman is. Harris should maintain a strong
antitrust stance, too, I believe, as well as providing new protections
against the worst excesses of AI and other technologies that might harm
vulnerable groups. But it’s certainly true that her administration will
be better for innovation than her opponent, even if the latter might be
better for lining the pockets of a few select billionaires.
</p>
<p>
This is also true:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“In a speech Ms. Harris gave on the future of A.I. in 2023, she noted
that we must “reject the false choice that suggests we can either
protect the public or advance innovation.”“
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It is a false choice. Regulation, principles, and a duty of care to the
public are not anti-innovation: in fact, they promote it. And that’s the
direction we should all be heading in.

uBlock Origin may soon be disabled</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-04, from: OS News</p>
<p>As uBlock Origin lead developer and maintainer Raymond Hill explained
on Friday, this is the result of Google deprecating support for the
Manifest v2 (MV2) extensions platform in favor of Manifest v3 (MV3).
“uBO is a Manifest v2 extension, hence the warning in your Google Chrome
browser. There is no Manifest v3 version of uBO, hence the browser will
suggest alternative extensions as a replacement for uBO,” Hill
explained. ↫ Sergiu Gatlan at Bleeping Computer If you’re still using
Chrome, or any possible Chrome skins who have not committed to keeping
Manifest v2 extensions enabled, it’s really high time to start thinking

<div class="e-content aside-content">
<p>
Somehow, I need to deal with my sadness.
</p>
<p>
Do we all?
</p>
<p>
It’s like it sits just under the surface, ready to spring up. Is every
adult like this? I think it must be more common than anyone talks about.
It’s not even that the world is getting harder, between climate change
and nationalism and war; it’s the narrowing vice of what it takes to
just be alive. There’s no time, there’s no money, we’re all expected to
be a part of a template that someone else has established for their own
benefit. It’s maybe easier if you’re rich, because more money roughly
translates to more time and more freedom, at least in America, but even
the rich get trapped into their own cycles of spending and acquiescence
in order to maintain their lifestyles. Even rich kids compare their
lives to people who have it better. They’ve got to keep earning,
somehow.
</p>
<p>
I had a conversation with a good friend recently. I told her that I felt
like I was living in a branch in the timestream, and I was waiting for
the world to snap back to the main timeline.
</p>
<p>
“Ben,” she patiently told me, “this <em>is</em> the main timeline.”
</p>
<p>
I mean, fuck.
</p>
<p>
I’m older than I think I am. That’s a common problem too, I think:
finding yourself stuck in that late twenties / early thirties mindset
where you’re still exploring and nothing is really set in stone yet. I’m
forty-five. My next major milestone birthday is <em>fifty</em>. I’m
fifteen years away from being sixty years old. Is it always going to
feel like this? When, exactly, will I have my shit together?
</p>
<p>
I’m still dealing with the loss of my mother and everything that led up
to it. It’s been thirteen years since I moved to America to be closer to
her, because she needed supplementary oxygen and it wasn’t clear how
long she would live for. For so much of that time, I was worried about
her. The two fridge-sized oxygen concentrators running in parallel so
she would have enough to breathe, the clear tubes snaking around the
house as she moved; the day she had her double lung transplant, when the
ICU nurses eventually had to kick me out of her room; her first steps,
set perfectly to Beyoncé’s Super Bowl half-time show; the joy of being
free; the slow sadness of the drugs taking it all away from her. The
nightmare trauma of palliative care and my guilt for not having done
more. Wishing I’d said more to her in those final hours. Wishing I’d
talked more with her overall. Feeling, despite everything I know, that I
must have disappointed her, she must be mad at me, because she’s never
shown up in a dream for me since.
</p>
<p>
My life hasn’t been real. It’s all a hyper-surreal collection of scenes
that I’ve been disassociated from to varying degrees. After her loss, I
fell into a trough of feeling like nothing at all mattered, like I was
disconnected from the cause and effect of reality. It was all a dream.
</p>
<p>
It was not a dream. This <em>is</em> the main timeline.
</p>
<p>
One of the things about being a third culture kid — or maybe this isn’t
about being a third culture kid at all, maybe it’s just about me, or
maybe everyone feels this — is that however you may superficially appear
to be a part of an archetype, you’re <em>not</em> a part of it. For all
those years with a British accent, going to an English school, I was
missing the cultural touchpoints and feeling of <em>belonging</em>. Some
people are anchored in place, nationhood, nationality, their hometowns.
The only feeling of belonging that really made sense to me was family:
the only people who had that same background, that mix of cultural
touchpoints and recognition. Losing family is about the profound hole
that’s left when someone you love is suddenly gone, a real hurt, but
it’s also about losing a tether: losing belonging itself.
</p>
<p>
I have always felt like I don’t really matter to anyone, except to my
family. I could disappear tomorrow and, shrug. When I was younger, I
convinced myself that there was some kind of magic incantation that
other people knew and I didn’t; if I could just learn the password, I’d
be a part of what everyone else was a part of. Until then, I wasn’t good
enough. I needed to prove myself.
</p>
<p>
When I didn’t date in high school, it was because I wasn’t good enough.
(All those beautiful people who did — I admired them so much. To my
teenage eyes, to hook up with someone meant that they
<em>accepted</em>you. What an unattainable thing for someone who didn’t
feel like he belonged.) (And: Christ, why was my body so <em>big</em>. I
hated my physicality. I wanted so badly for someone to tell me I was
okay. This is still true.) Every job I didn’t get, I wasn’t good enough.
When my startups didn’t hit the highs I was hoping for, I wasn’t good
enough. Every mistake, I wasn’t good enough. I didn’t measure up.
</p>
<p>
I don’t measure up. I’m not good enough. Even in my chosen profession,
I’ve never been in the cool developer circle, I’ve never quite made it
into the in crowd. I am still scared of my body, of catching myself in
the mirror. I’m still looking for the password.
</p>
<p>
This backchannel in my head is exhausting. It’s another reason to think:
eh, I don’t matter, nothing I do is really that important.
</p>
<p>
The thing about being convinced that you’re in some kind of dream-world
fork of reality is that you don’t face these things. The temptation is
to slide and slide — nothing really matters, remember? — and pretend
that one day you’ll go back to how it was before any of it started. But
you have to; there is no going back; if this <em>is</em> a fork, it’s
been worked on so long that there’s no way you could possibly rebase to
the main branch. This is life.
</p>
<p>
Which brings me to: I have a son.
</p>
<p>
He’s beautiful and smart; his smile cuts through everything else. He
sings the alphabet song in the back seat of the car and randomly walks
up to me and says “hug” before wrapping me in an embrace. I wish my
mother could have met him, is the toxic thought, but he is infused with
everything that was good about her. To him, I want to be the belonging
she represented to me. The belonging that my dad still represents for
me. (Largely unacknowledged: I am terrified of losing him, too.)
</p>
<p>
That means I have to deal with this sadness, this untethered unreality.
This has to be the main branch, because no other branch has him in it.
What I do matters to him, a lot, and it will for the rest of his life.
</p>
<p>
Therapy? Yes, of course. Parts Work and reflection and perspective. I
have a trauma therapist and Erin and I have a couples therapist and
these things work.
</p>
<p>
But they don’t cut to the sadness. The sadness is there, always. And I
have to deal with it, don’t I, because eventually it will infuse itself
into my son. I don’t want him to carry it. I want him to be free of its
tendrils. I want him to not feel how I feel.
</p>
<p>
I’ve been focused on the loss of belonging, and the idea of returning to
a less complicated timeline. I think, though, the way to deal with the
sadness is simpler, although also harder.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, finally, I’ve got to make peace with myself.
</p>
<p>
That’s the job.
</p>
<p>
I’ll be honest: I don’t have the first clue how to do it.
</p>
<p>
And I don’t know how universal this is. Is this something that’s unique
to me? Something that a lot of people quietly deal with? Is this sadness
sitting just underneath everybody’s skin, or is it just an infection
under mine? If it <em>is</em> lurking everywhere, shallowly digging its
way into everyone, what can we do about it? How can we tell each other
that we belong, that we’re okay, that it’s alright?
</p>
<p>
And if it’s not: please, finally, what’s the password? Not for my sake.
For his.

id="wall-street-week-ahead---flaring-economic-worries-threaten-us-stocks-rally">Wall
Street week ahead - Flaring economic worries threaten US stocks
rally</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — Economic fears are roiling Wall Street, as worries grow
that the Federal Reserve may have left interest rates elevated for too
long, allowing them to hurt U.S. growth.</p>
<p>Alarming economic data in recent days have deepened those concerns.
U.S. job growth slowed more than expected in July, a Friday report
showed, while the unemployment rate increased to 4.3%, heightening fears
that a deteriorating labor market could make the economy vulnerable to a
recession.</p>
<p>The jobs report exacerbated a selloff in stocks that began on
Thursday, when data showing weakness in the labor market and
manufacturing sector pushed investors to dump everything from chip
stocks to industrials while piling into defensive plays.</p>
<p>Richly valued tech stocks tumbled further on Friday, extending losses
in the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC to more than 10% from a record closing
high reached in July. The benchmark S&amp;P 500 index .SPX has slid 5.7%
from its July peak.</p>
<p>“This is what a growth scare looks like,” said Wasif Latif, president
and chief investment officer at Sarmaya Partners. “The market is now
realizing that the economy is indeed slowing.”</p>
<p>For months, investors had been heartened by cooling inflation and
gradually slowing employment, believing they bolstered the case for the
Fed to begin cutting interest rates. That optimism drove big gains in
stocks: the S&amp;P 500 remains up 12% this year, despite recent losses;
the Nasdaq has gained nearly 12%.</p>
<p>Now that a September rate cut has come into view following a Fed
meeting this week, investors are fretting that elevated borrowing costs
may already be hurting economic growth. Corporate earnings results,
which saw disappointments from companies such as Amazon, Alphabet and
Intel, are adding to their concerns.</p>
<p>“We’re witnessing the fallout from the curse of high expectations,”
said James St. Aubin, chief investment officer at Ocean Park Asset
Management. “So much had been invested around the scenario of a soft
landing, that anything that even suggests something different is
difficult.”</p>
<p>Next week brings earnings from industrial bellwether Caterpillar
CAT.N and media and entertainment giant Walt Disney DIS.N, which will
give more insight into the health of the consumer and manufacturing, as
well as reports from healthcare heavyweights such as weight-loss
drugmaker Eli Lilly LLY.N.</p>
<p>Bets in the futures markets on Friday suggested growing unease about
the economy. Fed fund futures reflected traders pricing an over-70%
chance of a 50-basis point cut at the central bank’s September meeting,
compared to 22% the day before, according to CME FedWatch. Futures
priced a total of 116 basis points in rate cuts in 2024, compared to
just over 60 basis points priced in on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Broader markets also showed signs of unease. The Cboe Volatility
index .VIX - known as Wall Street’s fear gauge - hit its highest since
March 2023 on Friday as demand for options protection against a stock
market selloff rose.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, investors have rushed into safe haven bonds and other
defensive areas of the market. U.S. 10-year yields - which move
inversely to bond prices - on Friday dropped as low as 3.79%, the lowest
since December.</p>
<p>Sectors that are often popular during times of economic uncertainty
are also drawing investors.</p>
<p>Options data for the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund XLV.P showed
the average daily balance between put and call contracts over the last
month at its most bullish in about three years, according to a Reuters
analysis of Trade Alert data. Trading in the options on Utilities Select
Sector SPDR Fund XLU.P also shows a pullback in defensive positioning,
highlighting traders’ expectations for strength for the sector.</p>
<p>The healthcare sector .SPXHC is up 4% in the past month, while
utilities .SPLRCU are up over 9%. By contrast, the Philadelphia SE
Semiconductor index .SOX is down nearly 17% in that period amid sharp
losses in investor favorites such as Nvidia NVDA.O and Broadcom
AVGO.O.</p>
<p>To be sure, some investors said the data could just be a reason to
lock in profits after the market’s overall strong run in 2024.</p>
<p>“This is a good excuse for investors to sell after a huge year to
date rally,” said Michael Purves, CEO of Tallbacken Capital Advisors.
“Investors should be prepared for some major volatility, particularly in
the big tech stocks. But it will probably be short-lived.”</p>

<p>Limine is an advanced, portable, multiprotocol bootloader that
supports Linux, multiboot1 and 2, the native Limine boot protocol, and
more. Limine is lightweight, elegant, fast, and the reference
implementation of the Limine boot protocol. The Limine boot protocol’s
main target audience is operating system and kernel developers that want
to use a boot protocol which supports modern features in an elegant
manner, that GRUB’s aging multiboot protocols do not (or do not
properly). ↫ Limine website I wish trying out different bootloaders was
an easier thing to do. Personally, since my systems only run Fedora
Linux, I’d love to just move them all over to systemd-boot and not deal
with GRUB at all anymore, but since it’s not supported by Fedora I’m
worried updates might break the boot process at some point. On systems
where only one operating system is installed, as a user I should really
be given the choice to opt for the simplest, most basic boot sequence,
even if it can’t boot any other operating systems or if it’s more
limited than GRUB.</p>

<h2 id="exploring-o3-optimization-for-ubuntu">Exploring O3 optimization
for Ubuntu</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-04, from: OS News</p>
<p>Following our recent work 5 with Ubuntu 24.04 LTS where we enabled
frame pointers by default to improve debugging and profiling, we’re
continuing our performance engineering efforts by evaluating the impact
of O3 optimization in Ubuntu. O3 is a GCC optimization 14 level that
applies more aggressive code transformations compared to the default O2
level. These include advanced function and the use of sophisticated
algorithms aimed at enhancing execution speed. While O3 can increase
binary size and compilation time, it has the potential to improve
runtime performance. ↫ Ubuntu Discourse If these optimisations deliver
performance improvements, and the only downside is larger binaries and
longer compilation times, it seems like a bit of a no-brainer to enable
these, assuming those mentioned downsides are within reason. Are there
any downsides they’re not mentioning? Browsing around and doing some
minor research it seems that -O3 optimisations may break some packages,
and can even lead to performance degradation, defeating the purpose
altogether. Looking at a set of benchmarks from Phoronix from a few
years ago, in which the Linux kernel was compiled with either O2 and O3
and their performance compared, the results were effectively tied,
making it seem not worth it at all. However, during these benchmarks,
only the kernel was tested; everything else was compiled normally in
both cases. Perhaps compiling the entire system with O3 will yield
improvements in other parts of the system that do add up. For now, you
can download unsupported Ubuntu ISOs compiled with O3 optimisations
enabled to test them out.</p>

id="in-win-for-mexico-us-will-expand-areas-for-migrants-to-apply-online-for-entry-at-southern-border">In
win for Mexico, US will expand areas for migrants to apply online for
entry at southern border</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Mexico City — The Biden administration will expand areas where
migrants can apply online for appointments to enter the United States to
a large swath of southern Mexico, officials said Saturday, potentially
easing strains on the Mexican government and lessening dangers for
people trying to reach the U.S. border to claim asylum.</p>
<p>Migrants will be able to schedule appointments on the CBP One app
from the states of Chiapas and Tabasco, extending the zone from northern
and central Mexico, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said. The move
satisfies a request of Mexico, an increasingly close partner of the U.S.
in efforts to control extraordinary migration flows.</p>
<p>The change will spare migrants from traveling north through Mexico to
get one of 1,450 appointments made available daily, CBP said. The agency
said it will happen soon but did not give a date.</p>
<p>“We consistently engage with our partners in the Government of Mexico
and work together to adjust policies and practices in response to the
latest migration trends and security needs,” CBP said in a
statement.</p>
<p>The statement confirmed remarks a day earlier by Mexico’s Foreign
Affairs Secretary Alicia Bárcena, who said closer relations with the
United States cut migration sharply from late last year.</p>
<p>U.S. officials have said increased Mexican enforcement is largely
responsible for a sharp drop in U.S. arrests for illegal border
crossings during the first half of this year. Mexican officials have
stepped up their presence at highway checkpoints and on railroads
leading to the U.S. border, returning most to southern Mexico.</p>
<p>In June, the U.S. temporarily suspended asylum processing for those
who enter the country illegally, making CBP One of the only avenues for
migrants to enter the U.S. to seek asylum and further driving down
illegal entries. U.S. officials said arrests for illegal crossings
plunged 30% in July from the previous month to the lowest level of Joe
Biden’s presidency and the lowest since September 2020.</p>
<p>“We have managed to decompress our [northern] border in a very
meaningful way and that has helped … our relationship with the United
States be very, very dynamic and very positive,” Bárcena said
Friday.</p>
<p>More than 680,000 people scheduled CBP One appointments at eight
Mexican land crossings with the U.S. from its introduction in January
2023 through June. The top nationalities are Venezuelan, Cuban and
Haitian. U.S. authorities recently limited slots for Mexicans due to the
high number of applicants from the country.</p>
<p>The perils of traveling through Mexico to be kidnapped or robbed has
prompted many migrants to fly to northern border cities like Tijuana for
their CBP One appointments once they reach the southernmost point from

going to survive and it’s going to come back’: A year after Maui
wildfire, survivors press on</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LAHAINA, Hawaii — They have combed the ashes for mementos, worried
about where they would sleep, questioned their faith and tried to find a
way to grieve amid the great, unsettling devastation. Residents have
faced a year of challenges, practical and emotional, since the deadliest
U.S. wildfire in a century decimated the historic town of Lahaina, on
Maui, on Aug. 8, 2023.</p>
<p>To mark the anniversary, The Associated Press interviewed seven
survivors its journalists first encountered in the days, weeks or months
after the fire, as well as a first responder who helped fight the
flames. Among their difficulties, they also have found hope, resilience
and determination: the Vietnam veteran who has helped others deal with
post-traumatic stress; the Buddhist minister with a new appreciation for
the sunsets from Lahaina; the college-bound teen aspiring to become a
Maui firefighter himself.</p>
<p>Here is a series of vignettes examining some of their experiences
over the past year.</p>
<p>Coping and staying</p>
<p>Even as he hid behind a seawall from the flames, Thomas Leonard knew
Lahaina’s wildfire was going to give him flashbacks to his service as a
U.S. Marine in Vietnam 55 years ago. The exploding cars and propane
tanks sounded just like mortars.</p>
<p>“Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom — one car after another,” he said.</p>
<p>The nightmares started a few months later. His Veterans
Administration doctor prescribed new sleeping medication.</p>
<p>“Thank God for the VA,” he said.</p>
<p>The 75-year-old retired mailman learned to identify signs of
post-traumatic stress disorder at a VA clinic in 2001, helping him spot
and cope with new triggers. He’s also helped fellow fire survivors.</p>
<p>“I’ve learned to be a really good listener on that with other people,
what they’re going through,” he said.</p>
<p>His condo building is still a pile of ash and rubble. Leonard
suspects it might take years to rebuild, but he’s determined to see it
through. He’s been living in hotels and a rented condo.</p>
<p>“We all got to stay together here on Maui,” Leonard said. “We’re
going to survive and it’s going to come back.”</p>
<p>Memories of gold</p>
<p>After Elsie Rosales arrived on Maui from the Philippines in 1999, she
scrimped on a hotel housekeeper’s salary. As she saved up enough to buy
a five-bedroom house in Lahaina in 2014, she did allow herself a few
luxuries: gold bracelets, delicate hoop earrings, things she could never
have afforded if she remained in the Philippines.</p>
<p>Like the home — her pride, her American dream — the jewelry was a
reminder of what’s possible in the U.S.</p>
<p>It all was wiped out in the wildfire that destroyed Lahaina. When she
finally was allowed back on the property, she dug through the debris for
anything that survived. All she found was a broken bangle.</p>
<p>She used insurance money to pay off the mortgage on the house. She’s
now renting a two-bedroom apartment with her husband, their son and
their son’s girlfriend in Kahului, an hourlong bus ride from
Lahaina.</p>
<p>On those long commutes, she reflects on how she amassed her jewelry
collection, only for it to vanish.</p>
<p>“When I’m not working, I keep thinking about everything that burned,”
she said. “Especially my jewelry. Everything that I worked hard
for.”</p>
<p>Missing the mana</p>
<p>Surfing off his Lahaina home always gave Ekolu Lindsey “mana,”
spiritual energy. The house was in his family for five generations.</p>
<p>He’s so familiar with the area he notices when more crabs are around
or fish are undersized. He has brought school groups there to teach them
about the coral, seaweed and the ocean.</p>
<p>“My reset button is to jump in the water at home,” he said.</p>
<p>That has been impossible since the wildfire turned his house to
rubble. His property is now clear of debris but has no electricity or
other utilities. Reconstruction is well off.</p>
<p>He’s living at a friend’s place on Oahu, another island, a plane ride
away. He couldn’t find anything in Lahaina for less than $4,000 a
month.</p>
<p>He returns regularly to Maui to help restore native forests, a focus
of the nonprofit his father founded, Maui Cultural Lands. Sadness weighs
on him as he drives the winding coastal highway to Lahaina.</p>
<p>State conservation officials won’t allow people to enter the ocean
from the burn zone. He surfs on Oahu, but it’s not the same.</p>
<p>“You get the physical exercise,” he said, but not the “rejuvenation
of that mana.”</p>
<p>The right track</p>
<p>As he was dying of colon cancer, Mike Vierra spent sleepless nights
fretting about where his wife, Leola, and their daughter would live when
he was gone. The wildfire had reduced their home of more than half a
century to hardened pools of melted metal, burned wood and broken
glass.</p>
<p>By the time he passed away in April, the answer still wasn’t
clear.</p>
<p>Leola Vierra and her daughter moved multiple times after the fire,
switching hotel rooms and vacation rentals whenever the unit’s owners
would return.</p>
<p>“Everything was so unsettled,” she said.</p>
<p>The Vierras, married 57 years, also couldn’t find their beloved cat,
Kitty Kai. But in February, they learned Kitty Kai had found her way to
Kahului, 30 miles (48 kilometers) across the West Maui Mountains.</p>
<p>The reunion, while joyful, complicated their housing search.
Landlords are less likely to rent to families with pets.</p>
<p>Not until last month did Vierra find some stability, securing a
six-month lease while they wait to someday rebuild on their own
property. Their new place has a yard, a sundeck and an ocean view.</p>
<p>“I have been so depressed ever since my husband passed, and I can
feel my mind and my memory all going downhill,” she said. “With this new
home, I think I will be able to accept more things now, because it seems
like I’m on the right track.”</p>
<p>Cherishing sunsets</p>
<p>As the flames approached, Ai Hironaka and his family — wife, four
children, French bulldog — crammed into his Honda Civic and drove off,
leaving behind their home and the Japanese Buddhist temple where he was
resident minister and caretaker.</p>
<p>Losing those buildings and being uprooted amid the greater
devastation has tested him as a Buddhist. How should he behave as a
disaster victim? What is the appropriate response when someone gives him
donated clothing he doesn’t want? If he feels ungrateful, he turns to
the teachings of his religion.</p>
<p>“We all have an evil nature, self-centeredness,” he said.</p>
<p>After moving three times in the months after the fire, he now lives
across the island, nearly an hour away, at another temple, Kahului
Hongwanji Mission, where he also serves as resident minister. He
performs much of the same work he did at the Hongwanji Mission in
Lahaina: leading ceremonies and counseling members, including fire
survivors.</p>
<p>He returns to the site of the Lahaina temple occasionally to check
the columbarium, an area for storing funeral urns, which survived. He
misses the town, the beach parks, the parents on his son’s high school
football team.</p>
<p>And he misses the sunsets from Lahainaluna High School, overlooking
the ocean. When he goes back now, he does not take that view for
granted.</p>
<p>“I have to capture that,” he said, “because I cannot see this
tomorrow.”</p>
<p>From football to firefighting</p>
<p>Before the fire, Morgan “Bula” Montgomery was a kid who loved playing
football and paddling in the ocean. College wasn’t on his radar.</p>
<p>But the University of Hawaii offered full-ride scholarships for
Lahainaluna High School graduates at any school in its system following
the disaster. Montgomery thought, “Why not?”</p>
<p>He plans to leave Maui this fall to study fire science at Hawaii
Community College on the Big Island, inspired by the devastation and the
firefighters who tried to save the community.</p>
<p>“I want to come back to Lahaina and come back to Maui and try to be a
firefighter,” he said.</p>
<p>Montgomery’s family lost their two-bedroom apartment to the fire, but
also found opportunity. Montgomery and fellow Lahainaluna football
captains were invited to the Super Bowl in Las Vegas this year. It was
one of just a handful of times he has left Maui.</p>
<p>After spending time in a hotel, the family secured a rental house
about an hour drive across the island. It’s not convenient for his canoe
paddling practices in Lahaina. But it’s the biggest house they’ve lived
in, with five bedrooms, enough for his mom and her five children.</p>
<p>He’s a little nervous about leaving Maui but grateful for the
scholarship.</p>
<p>“An opportunity for school or free tuition is something you’ve got to
take advantage of,” Montgomery said.</p>
<p>‘That’s what we do’</p>
<p>Ikaika Blackburn, an 18-year veteran of the Maui Fire Department,
talks often with his crewmates about the blaze that consumed Lahaina: at
the fire house kitchen table, over cups of coffee while waiting for
calls or during family gatherings on days off.</p>
<p>His five-person crew was one of the first on the scene. There was no
time to think, “no time to have these sentimental feelings,” as he
fought through the night. He spent a lot of time growing up with his
grandparents in Lahaina. His wife is from the town. His mother-in-law
lost her home.</p>
<p>At daybreak, it set in: “We lost Lahaina.”</p>
<p>Blackburn and his crew spent days talking about it, “just releasing
it and not holding it all in,” he said. Recalling how they rushed from
one part of town to the next, trying to find a way to stop it.</p>
<p>“For the most part, we’re able to always win,” he said. “We’re always
able to get ahead of it.”</p>
<p>But this fire was different, uncontrollable. Firefighters and
investigators from outside Maui helped him understand that his crew did
all they could.</p>
<p>Blackburn followed his father’s footsteps as a Maui fire captain.
Firefighting feels like something he was born to do.</p>
<p>And he has kept doing it. This year’s busy brushfire season hasn’t
triggered memories of last August, he said, because nothing compares to
that fire.</p>
<p>“We respond to fires all the time,” he said. “That’s what we do.”</p>
<p>Lahaina Strong</p>
<p>When wildfire struck, Jordan Ruidas couldn’t sleep. Eager to help
families in the 21 homes that burned, she started a Facebook fundraiser
titled, “Lahaina Strong,” which raised more than $150,000.</p>
<p>That was in 2018.</p>
<p>Five years later, Ruidas and Lahaina Strong again emerged as leaders,
pushing officials to control tourism and try to find enough housing for
local residents after the 2023 fire destroyed thousands of
buildings.</p>
<p>Ruidas was seven months pregnant when last year’s fire destroyed
Lahaina. She sometimes missed prenatal checkups. Traveling nurses at
community hubs for fire survivors would check her blood pressure.</p>
<p>The fire spared her neighborhood and two months later she gave birth
at home to a daughter, Aulia.</p>
<p>“I don’t think I’ve dealt with all the emotions that came with losing
Lahaina and being postpartum,” she said. “I feel like I cope by staying
busy with work, with Lahaina Strong.”</p>
<p>Ruidas brought the baby along, strapped to her chest, when she helped
organize a “fish-in” protest at a popular beach resort demanding more
short-term rental housing be made available for survivors.</p>
<p>She still hasn’t been able to bring herself to visit the burn
zone.</p>
<p>“My kids will never grow up seeing or knowing the Lahaina that I grew
up seeing and knowing,” she said. “The Lahaina that we lost was a very
special and beautiful place.”</p>

id="tropical-storm-debby-moving-through-gulf-toward-florida-with-hurricane-warnings">Tropical
Storm Debby moving through Gulf toward Florida with hurricane
warnings</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MIAMI, FLORIDA — A tropical depression strengthened into Tropical
Storm Debby north of Cuba on Saturday and was predicted to become a
hurricane as it moves through the Gulf of Mexico on a collision course
with the Florida coast.</p>
<p>The National Hurricane Center said in an update posted at 5 a.m.
Sunday that Debby was located about 195 miles (315 kilometers)
south-southwest of Tampa, Florida, and about 255 miles (410 kilometers)
south-southwest of Cedar Key, Florida. The storm was moving
north-northwest at 13 mph (20 kph) with maximum sustained winds of 50
mph (85 kph).</p>
<p>The storm was strengthening over the southeastern Gulf and expected
to be a hurricane before making landfall in the Big Bend region of
Florida, the hurricane center said.</p>
<p>Wind and thunderstorms have spread over a broad area including
southern Florida, the Florida Keys and the Bahamas. A hurricane warning
and tropical storm warnings were in effect for sections of Florida’s
coast and a tropical storm watch was added for coastal Georgia in the
latest advisory.</p>
<p>Debby is likely to bring drenching rain and coastal flooding to much
of Florida’s Gulf Coast by Sunday night and predictions show the system
could come ashore as a hurricane Monday and cross over northern Florida
into the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>Forecasters warn it also could drop heavy rains over north Florida
and the Atlantic coasts of Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina
early next week.</p>
<p>Debby is the fourth named storm of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season
after Tropical Storm Alberto, Hurricane Beryl and Tropical Storm Chris,
all of which formed in June.</p>
<p>The National Hurricane Center in Miami predicted the system will
strengthen as it curves off the southwest Florida coast, where the water
has been extremely warm. Intensification was expected to proceed more
quickly later on Sunday.</p>
<p>A hurricane warning was issued for parts of the Big Bend and the
Florida Panhandle, while tropical storm warnings were posted for
Florida’s West Coast, the southern Florida Keys and Dry Tortugas. A
tropical storm watch extended farther west into the Panhandle. A warning
means storm conditions are expected within 36 hours, while a watch means
they are possible within 48 hours.</p>
<p>Tropical storms and hurricanes can trigger river flooding and
overwhelm drainage systems and canals. Forecasters warned of 6 to 12
inches (150mm to 300 mm) of rain and up to 18 inches (450 mm) in
isolated areas, which could create “locally considerable” flash and
urban flooding. Forecasters also warned of moderate flooding for some
rivers along Florida’s West Coast.</p>
<p>Heaviest rain could be in Georgia, South Carolina</p>
<p>Some of the heaviest rains could actually come next week along the
Atlantic Coast from Jacksonville, Florida, through coastal regions of
Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina. The storm is expected to
slow down after making landfall.</p>
<p>“We could see a stall or a meandering motion around coastal portions
of the southeastern United States,” National Hurricane Center Director
Michael Brennan said in a Saturday briefing. “So that’s going to
exacerbate not just the rainfall risk, but also the potential for storm
surge and some strong winds.”</p>
<p>Flat Florida is prone to flooding even on sunny days, and the storm
was predicted to bring a surge of 2 to 4 feet (0.6 to 1.2 meters) along
most of the Gulf Coast, including Tampa Bay, with a storm tide of up to
7 feet (2.1 meters) north of there in the sparsely populated Big Bend
region.</p>
<p>Forecasters warned of “a danger of life-threatening storm surge
inundation” in a region that includes Hernando Beach, Crystal River,
Steinhatchee and Cedar Key. Officials in Citrus and Levy counties
ordered a mandatory evacuation of coastal areas, while those in
Hernando, Manatee, Pasco and Taylor counties called for voluntary
evacuations. Shelters opened in those and some other counties.</p>
<p>Citrus County Sheriff Mike Prendergast estimated 21,000 people live
in his county’s evacuation zone. Officials rescued 73 people from storm
surge flooding during last year’s Hurricane Idalia. Prendergast said by
phone that he hopes not to have a repeat with Debbie.</p>
<p>“After the storm surge does come in, we simply don’t have enough
first responders in our agency and among the other first responders in
the county to go in and rescue everybody that might need to be rescued,”
he said.</p>
<p>Flood preparations underway</p>
<p>Gov. Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency for 61 of Florida’s
67 counties, with the National Guard activating 3,000 guard members.
Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp made his own emergency proclamation on
Saturday.</p>
<p>The White House said federal and Florida officials were in touch and
FEMA “pre-positioned” resources including water and food.</p>
<p>In Tampa alone, officials gave out more than 30,000 sandbags to
barricade against flooding.</p>
<p>“We’ve got our stormwater drains cleared out. We’ve got our
generators all checked and full. We’re doing everything that we need to
be prepared to face a tropical storm,” Tampa Mayor Jane Castor said.</p>
<p>Christina Lothrop is the general manager at Blue Pelican Marina in
Hernando Beach, a barrier island about 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of
St. Petersburg. She said the public ramp was jammed Saturday with people
launching boats.</p>
<p>“Today it’s kind of normal, which is kind of weird,” Lothrop told The
Associated Press by telephone.</p>
<p>Workers at her marina have been preparing since Tuesday, however,
securing boats stored on racks, stowing tool boxes and tying everything
down.</p>
<p>“Right now what we’re doing is mostly tying up boats,” Lothrop
said.</p>
<p>Before closing Saturday, Lothrop planned to raise computers off the
floor and sandbag and tape doors. Idalia pushed about a foot of water
(30 centimeters) into the store.</p>
<p>Betti Silverman, whose home in Crystal River was under an evacuation
order, said on Saturday afternoon that she doubted her family would
leave. Silverman’s waterfront home flooded during Idalia just as her
family was moving in, ruining boxes and furniture in the garage. But she
said the forecast for Debby didn’t seem as severe.</p>
<p>“We’ve been in Florida our whole lives, in South Florida, so
hurricanes are not really a big, big thing,” Silverman said.</p>
<p>On Friday, crews pulled floating cranes away from a bridge
construction project across Tampa Bay, lashing together 74 barges and 24
floating cranes and anchoring them, project engineer Marianne Brinson
told the Tampa Bay Times. Crews also laid down cranes on land on their
sides.</p>
<p>Pinellas County paused a $5 million beach renourishment project
necessitated in part by erosion from past storms.</p>
<p>For some, the name Debby summons bad memories of a 2012 tropical
storm of the same name that caused $250 million in losses and eight
deaths, including seven in the Sunshine State. That storm dumped
torrential rains, including an astronomical 29 inches (730 mm) south of
Tallahassee.</p>
<p>More storms in the Pacific, but no threat to land</p>
<p>More than 750 miles (1,200 kilometers) off Mexico in the Pacific
Ocean, Hurricane Carlotta continued moving westward with top sustained
winds of 85 mph (140 kph). Carlotta began losing strength Saturday and
is likely to dissipate into a remnant of thunderstorms.</p>
<p>Farther west, Tropical Storm Daniel formed in the Pacific. It was
more than 1,500 miles (2,400 kilometers) from the southern tip of Baja
California and was also expected to dissipate without striking land.</p>

id="tribes-wait-to-get-items-back-6-months-after-museums-shut-native-exhibits">Tribes
wait to get items back, 6 months after museums shut Native exhibits</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Tucked within the expansive Native American halls of the
American Museum of Natural History is a diminutive wooden doll that
holds a sacred place among the tribes whose territories once included
Manhattan.</p>
<p>For more than six months now, the ceremonial Ohtas, or Doll Being,
has been hidden from view after the museum and others nationally took
dramatic steps to board up or paper over exhibits in response to new
federal rules requiring institutions to return sacred or culturally
significant items to tribes — or at least to obtain consent to display
or study them.</p>
<p>Museum officials are reviewing more than 1,800 items as they work to
comply with the requirements while also eyeing a broader overhaul of the
more than half-century-old exhibits.</p>
<p>But some tribal leaders remain skeptical, saying museums have not
acted swiftly enough. The new rules, after all, were prompted by years
of complaints from tribes that hundreds of thousands of items that
should have been returned under the federal Native American Graves
Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990 still remain in museum
custody.</p>
<p>“If things move slowly, then address that,” said Joe Baker, a
Manhattan resident and member of the Delaware Tribe of Indians,
descendants of the Lenape peoples European traders encountered more than
400 years ago. “The collections, they’re part of our story, part of our
family. We need them home. We need them close.”</p>
<p>Sean Decatur, the New York museum’s president, promised tribes will
hear from officials soon. He said staff these past few months have been
reexamining the displayed objects in order to begin contacting tribal
communities.</p>
<p>Museum officials envision a total overhaul of the closed Eastern
Woodlands and Great Plains halls — akin to the five-year, $19 million
renovation of its Northwest Coast Hall, completed in 2022 in close
collaboration with tribes, Decatur added.</p>
<p>“The ultimate aim is to make sure we’re getting the stories right,”
he said.</p>
<p>Discussions with tribal representatives over the Ohtas began in 2021
and will continue, museum officials said, even though the doll does
actually not fall under the Native American Graves Protection and
Repatriation Act because it is associated with a tribe outside the U.S.,
the Munsee-Delaware Nation in Ontario, Canada.</p>
<p>The museum also plans to open a small exhibit in the fall
incorporating Native American voices and explaining the history of the
closed halls, why changes are being made and what the future holds, he
said.</p>
<p>Lance Gumbs, vice chairman of the Shinnecock Indian Nation, a
federally recognized tribe in New York’s Hamptons, said he worries about
the loss of representation of local tribes in public institutions, with
exhibit closures likely stretching into years.</p>
<p>The American Museum of Natural History, he noted, is one of New
York’s major tourism draws and also a mainstay for generations of area
students learning about the region’s tribes.</p>
<p>He suggests museums use replicas made by Native peoples so that
sensitive cultural items aren’t physically on display.</p>
<p>“I don’t think tribes want to have our history written out of
museums,” Gumbs said. “There’s got to be a better way than using
artifacts that literally were stolen out of gravesites.”</p>
<p>Gordon Yellowman, who heads the department of language and culture
for the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes, said museums should look to create
more digital and virtual exhibits.</p>
<p>He said the tribes, in Oklahoma, will be seeking from the New York
museum a sketchbook by the Cheyenne warrior Little Finger Nail that
contains his drawings and illustrations from battle.</p>
<p>The book, which is in storage and not on display, was plucked from
his body after he and other tribe members were killed by U.S. soldiers
in Nebraska in 1879.</p>
<p>“These drawings weren’t just made because they were beautiful,”
Yellowman said. “They were made to show the actual history of the
Cheyenne and Arapaho people.”</p>
<p>Institutions elsewhere are taking other approaches.</p>
<p>In Chicago, the Field Museum has established a Center for
Repatriation after covering up several cases in its halls dedicated to
ancient America and the peoples of the coastal Northwest and Arctic.</p>
<p>The museum has completed four repatriations to tribes involving
around 40 items over the past six months, with at least three more
repatriations pending involving additional items. Those repatriations
were through efforts that were underway before the new regulations,
according to Field Museum spokesperson Bridgette Russell.</p>
<p>At the Cleveland Museum in Ohio, a case displaying artifacts from the
Tlingit people in Alaska has been reopened after their leadership gave
consent, according to Todd Mesek, the museum’s spokesperson. But two
other displays remain covered up, with one containing funerary objects
from the ancient Southwest to be redone with a different topic and
materials.</p>
<p>And at Harvard, the Peabody Museum’s North American Indian hall
reopened in February after about 15% of its roughly 350 items were
removed from displays, university spokesperson Nicole Rura said.</p>
<p>Chuck Hoskin, chief of the Cherokee Nation, said he believes many
institutions now understand they can no longer treat Indigenous items as
“museum curiosities” from “peoples that no longer exist.”</p>
<p>The leader of the tribe in Oklahoma said he visited the Peabody this
year after the university reached out about returning hair clippings
collected in the early 1930s from hundreds of Indigenous children,
including Cherokees, forced to assimilate in the notorious Indian
boarding schools.</p>
<p>“The fact that we’re in a position to sit down with Harvard and have
a really meaningful conversation, that’s progress for the country,” he
said.</p>
<p>As for Baker, he wants the Ohtas returned to its tribe. He said the
ceremonial doll should never have been on display, especially arranged
as it was among wooden bowls, spoons and other everyday items.</p>
<p>“It has a spirit. It’s a living being,” Baker said. “So if you think
about it being hung on a wall all these years in a static case,
suffocating for lack of air, it’s just horrific, really.”</p>

wildfires rage in US, volunteers save animals with warm hearts and cool
heads</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>COHASSET, California — While firefighters continued to battle
California’s biggest wildfire of the year, Norm Rosene was spending
18-hour days behind fire lines with a different task –- saving the
animals.</p>
<p>Tucked in an old wooden barn in the decimated forest town of Cohasset
in northern California, his team stumbled upon a calf that appeared to
be just a few days old. Its mother protectively hovered over her baby
while it nursed.</p>
<p>“It’s critical for us to get feed and water … especially because the
temperature is supposed to go up to the hundreds (above 37 degrees
Celsius) over the next few days,” said the 66-year-old volunteer. “They
drink a lot of water, especially the mom’s going to need water and food
to be able to nurse the calf.”</p>
<p>He made sure any smoldering hay or small fires still burning near the
barn were extinguished, alerted nearby firefighters and moved on to the
next home.</p>
<p>With more than 26,000 residents evacuated due to the Park Fire and
over 1,554 square kilometers scorched as of Wednesday, there were cats,
dogs, chickens, horses, and goats left behind.</p>
<p>Worried owners depend on volunteers like Rosene to rescue their
beloved pets and keep their livestock alive until they can return to
their homes.</p>
<p>“If people can’t take their animals, they sometimes want to stay,”
Rosene said. “So if we can come and help them take their animals, then
they will come out of that disaster area and they are safer and they
feel better because they didn’t leave their animals behind.”</p>
<p>When the Park Fire started last Wednesday, Rosene at first thought it
wouldn’t come his direction. But by evening, the winds had changed. He
and his wife Janice evacuated his home in Chico around 1 a.m.</p>
<p>“It’s almost terrifying because the wind was blowing and the fire was
roaring and it’s coming right at you and the embers are like fireflies
just darting all over the sky,” Rosene said, showing images of a blood
red sky blanketed with billowing columns of black smoke.</p>
<p>But the fire burned through his area quickly and thankfully left his
house intact. Within hours, he and his wife were already at work
evacuating animals.</p>
<p>The couple began volunteering 12 years ago with the North Valley
Animal Disaster Group, a team of now about 300 volunteers. They’re
trained for all types of disasters, from floods to fires, and nearly
every type of rescue you could think of – helicopter rescue, high angle
rope rescue, search and rescue – as well as animal behavior and
handling.</p>
<p>“That’s why our team is allowed to go behind fire lines and work
within the fire disaster system because we integrate with them and we
don’t get in the way of the firefighters,” Rosene said. “They like
having us back there because when they find an animal they don’t know
what to do with it.”</p>
<p>They’ve dealt with all types of animals, and Rosene is team’s
designated snake-and-lizard handler. He’s even evacuated two giant emus
and their chicks. Every pet is worth saving.</p>
<p>For large animals, the goal is to keep them where they are, as long
as they’re safe.</p>
<p>“When they get stressed by fire and smoke … now you try to load them
into a trailer or truck it can be a real challenge,” he said.</p>
<p>If they have to be evacuated, Rosene and others will coax them into
the back of their trailer and take them to the Camelot Equestrian Park.
Smaller animals like cats and dogs are taken to an emergency shelter in
Oroville.</p>
<p>Sometimes owners will bring in their animals if they are unable to
care for them, Rosene said. There are about 100 in the small animal
shelter and 70 in the large animal shelter from the Park Fire, and they
are taking care of 850 more within the evacuation area.</p>
<p>Even if the fire is out in an area, it can take days for an
evacuation order to lift. Crews have to clear the numerous hazards that
appear in the aftermath of a fire, such as falling trees and power
lines, exposed nails and broken glass, and tree holes filled with
embers.</p>
<p>During the devastating Camp Fire in 2018, which destroyed several
towns including nearly the entire community of Paradise, Rosene and
others helped more than 4,000 displaced animals. He and group founder
John Maretti have traveled to more than a dozen countries to teach and
respond to disasters.</p>
<p>“If there’s one lesson here, it’s for people to be prepared to take
their pets with them during a fire,” Rosene said. “So if they have a go
bag for themselves, they should have a go bag for their pets.”</p>

id="harris-campaign-staffs-up-in-battleground-states-sun-belt">Harris
campaign staffs up in battleground states, ‘Sun Belt’</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WILMINGTON, Delaware — Vice President Kamala Harris’s presidential
campaign is staffing up in battleground states over the next two weeks
including in the ‘Sun Belt’ that increasingly looked out of reach for
President Joe Biden, citing momentum for her White House bid as
grassroots engagement and fundraising soar. </p>
<p>“Our grassroots engagement is proving that Kamala Harris is strong in
both the Sun Belt and the Blue Wall — with multiple pathways to 270
(electoral votes),” wrote Dan Kanninen, the campaign’s battleground
states director in a memo on Saturday. </p>
<p>The Sun Belt refers to states including Georgia, Arizona and Nevada,
and the Blue Wall includes Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. U.S.
President Joe Biden won all six of those states in 2020 by thin margins,
but just weeks ago, his campaign said the Sun Belt and North Carolina
looked increasingly out of reach. </p>
<p>Harris energizes race</p>
<p>Harris’ takeover of the Democratic presidential campaign has injected
new energy, money and enthusiasm into the race, which is translating
into a shift in polls that show her pulling even with Republican former
President Donald Trump or ahead in some battleground states. </p>
<p>Since Biden endorsed Harris on July 21, 200,000 volunteers have
joined the Harris campaign, while over 350,000 supporters attended their
first phone bank, rally or other campaign event - an over 350% increase
in event attendees, Kanninen said. </p>
<p>Harris’ campaign announced on Friday it raised $310 million in July,
fueled by small-dollar donations. </p>
<p>In the next two weeks, the campaign will add 150 more staff in the
“Blue Wall,” and will more than double its staff in Arizona and North
Carolina, Kanninen said. </p>
<p>Harris campaign operations on the ground are more extensive than
Trump’s, he said. </p>
<p>“In Nevada, Team Harris has 13 offices, while Trump has just one,”
Kanninen wrote. “In Pennsylvania, we have 36 coordinated offices while
Trump has just three. In Georgia, we have 24 offices while the Trump
team didn’t open their first until June.” </p>
<p>The Trump campaign did not immediately confirm the accuracy of those
numbers, and it did not respond to a request for comment. </p>
<p>This week Trump’s campaign was set to launch a $10 million
advertising blitz in six battleground states. A super PAC supporting
Trump, MAGA Inc., kicked off a parallel ad blitz after it said it will
spend $32 million in three states with new ads criticizing Harris. </p>
<p>Some political experts have questioned Trump’s lack of campaign
infrastructure in recent days. </p>
<p>“Those of us who are interested in voting are like, ‘Why don’t you
need a ground game?’” political historian Heather Cox Richardson said in
a Facebook livestream. “It really takes feet on the ground, knuckles on
doors, meetings with people, everything to get money circulating. He is
not trying to get enough votes.” </p>
<p>Search for running mate. continues</p>
<p>Harris was expected to meet in person this weekend with the top
contenders vying to join the ticket as the candidate for vice president,
Reuters reported on Friday, citing sources.  </p>
<p>She will meet with leading contenders Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and
Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro for interviews on Sunday, according
to sources familiar with her plans.  </p>
<p>Other top names include U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg,
U.S. Senator Mark Kelly, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear and Illinois
Governor J.B. Pritzker. </p>
<p>Harris held a marginal one-percentage-point lead over Trump in a
recent Reuters/Ipsos poll, closing the gap that opened in the final
weeks of Biden’s reelection bid. </p>
<p>The three-day poll showed Harris supported by 43% of registered
voters, with Trump supported by 42%, within the poll’s 3.5 percentage
point margin of error.</p>

id="katie-ledecky-swims-into-olympics-history-winning-800-freestyle-in-paris">Katie
Ledecky swims into Olympics history, winning 800 freestyle in Paris</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NANTERRE, France — Every year on August 3, Katie Ledecky is reminded
of her first Olympic gold medal. </p>
<p>She was just 15 years old, a reserved high schooler who had
surprisingly made the U.S. swim team for the London Games. Then she went
out and shocked the world, beating everyone in the 800-meter
freestyle. </p>
<p>Twelve years to the day, Ledecky did it again. </p>
<p>Not a stunner, but one for the ages. </p>
<p>Gold medal No. 9. </p>
<p>Ledecky capped another stellar Olympics by becoming only the second
swimmer to win an event at four straight Summer Games, holding off
Ariarne Titmus, the “Terminator,” to win the 800 free Saturday
night. </p>
<p>It was Ledecky’s second gold medal in Paris and the ninth of her
remarkable career, which marked another milestone. </p>
<p>She became only the sixth Olympian to reach that figure, joining
swimmer Mark Spitz, track star Carl Lewis, Soviet gymnast Larisa
Latynina, and Finnish runner Paavo Nurmi in a tie for second place. </p>
<p>The only athlete to win more golds: swimmer Michael Phelps with
23. </p>
<p>Ledecky was very aware of the significance of the date. </p>
<p>“Every August 3rd, the video [of her first Olympic gold] gets posted
somewhere and you kind of reminisce,” she said. “So, when I saw it was
August 3rd, I was like, ‘Oh boy, I’ve got to get the job done.’” </p>
<p>That she did, going faster than her winning time in Tokyo to finish
in 8 minutes, 11.04 seconds. Titmus was right on her shoulder nearly the
entire race, but Ledecky pulled away in the final 100. </p>
<p>Titmus, who beat Ledecky in the 400 freestyle, settled for silver at
8:12.29. The bronze went to another American, Paige Madden at
8:13.00. </p>
<p>Phelps had been the only swimmer to win the same event at four
straight Olympics, taking gold in the 200 individual medley at Athens,
Beijing, London and Rio de Janeiro. </p>
<p>Now he’s got company. </p>
<p>Titmus added some perspective to Ledecky’s consistency over the last
dozen years, noting where she was when the American won that first gold
in London. </p>
<p>“I was in grade six in primary school,” Titmus said. “That’s how
remarkable she is.” </p>
<p>Their friendly rivalry has driven both to greater heights. They each
won two golds and four medals at these games, which pushed Ledecky to 14
overall and left the 23-year-old Aussie with four golds and eight medals
in her career. </p>
<p>“To think that eight years later, I challenged her into her fourth
consecutive in the 800 is pretty cool,” Titmus said. “So I’m really
proud of myself and I feel very honored and privileged to be her rival,
and I hope I’ve made her a better athlete. She has certainly made me
become the athlete I am. I felt so privileged to race alongside
her.” </p>
<p>Dominant for a dozen years</p>
<p>Ledecky has dominated the distance freestyle events over the last
dozen years — and isn’t done yet. She’s made it clear she plans to keep
swimming at least through the 2028 Los Angeles Games.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“It’s not easy,” Ledecky said. “I’ll take it year by year, and we’ll
see if I can keep giving everything I’ve got for as long as I have left
in me.” </p>
<p>Another gold for Canadian teenager  </p>
<p>Summer McIntosh stamped herself as one of the swimming stars of the
Paris Olympics with her third individual gold medal, winning the 200
individual medley. </p>
<p>The 17-year-old Canadian chased down American Alex Walsh and held off
another U.S. swimmer, Kate Douglass, to finish in an Olympic record of
2:06.56. </p>
<p>Douglass grabbed the silver in the star-studded final at 2:06.92, but
the Americans lost the bronze when Walsh, the silver medalist in this
event at Tokyo who recorded a time of 2:07.06, was disqualified because
she did not finish the backstroke segment on her back. </p>
<p>Kaylee McKeown, who touched fourth, was bumped up to the bronze at
2:08.08. </p>
<p>It was a bitter blow for Walsh, whose younger sister, Gretchen, has
won a gold medal and two silvers in Paris. </p>
<p>McIntosh set several world records ahead of the Paris Olympics, and
she backed up the enormous expectations by claiming a starring role at
La Defense Arena along with Léon Marchand and Ledecky. </p>
<p>McIntosh also won gold medals in the 200 butterfly and 400 IM, plus a
silver in the 400 freestyle. She fell just 0.88 seconds — the margin of
her loss to Titmus — shy of matching Marchand’s four individual
golds. </p>
<p>“It’s pretty surreal,” said McIntosh, who became the first Canadian
athlete to win three golds in a single Olympics. “I’m just so proud of
myself and how I’ve been able to recover and manage events. </p>
<p>US sets world record </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The United States made up for a disappointing showing in Tokyo by
setting a world record in the 4x100 mixed medley relay. </p>
<p>Ryan Murphy, Nic Fink, Gretchen Walsh and Torri Huske held off China
for a winning time of 3:37.43, breaking the mark of 3:37.58 set by
Britain when it won gold in the wild and woolly event’s Olympic debut
three years ago. </p>
<p>With each team picking two men and two women, the U.S. and China both
went with their male swimmers in the first two legs. </p>
<p>Murphy put the U.S. in front on the backstroke, China’s Qin Haiyang
slipped past Nic Fink on the breaststroke, but Walsh put the Americans
back in front on the butterfly before Huske held off Yang Junxuan to
secure the gold. </p>
<p>The Chinese team, which also included Xu Jiayu and Zhang Yufei, took
silver in 3:37.55. The bronze went to Australia in 3:38.76. </p>
<p>Marchand swam the breaststroke leg for France but couldn’t add to his
already impressive haul of four individual golds. The French finished
fourth, more than two seconds behind the Aussies. </p>
<p>When the British won gold in 2021, the Americans finished fifth.
Britain was seventh this time. </p>
<p>Hungarian claims butterfly gold </p>
<p>Kristóf Milák of Hungary won the men’s 100 butterfly, chasing down
three swimmers on the return lap. </p>
<p>Milák was only fourth at the turn, but he rallied to touch in 49.90.
Canada grabbed the silver and bronze, with Josh Liendo finishing in
49.99 and Ilya Kharun next at 50.45. </p>
<p>Milák had failed to defend his Olympic title in the 200 butterfly,
settling for a silver behind French star Marchand. </p>
<p>Milák claimed silver in the 100 fly three years ago, but he didn’t
have to worry about the guy who beat him in that race. American Caeleb
Dressel stunningly failed to qualify for the final, posting only the
13th-fastest time in the semifinals Friday. </p>
<p>Kharun added another bronze to the one he garnered in the 200
butterfly.</p>

id="harris-rejects-trumps-idea-to-debate-her-on-fox-with-live-audience">Harris
rejects Trump’s idea to debate her on FOX with live audience</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>reuters — Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump proposed to
debate Democratic U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris on Fox News on
September 4, and the Harris campaign said Trump is trying to back out of
a debate that had been set to run on ABC. </p>
<p>The rules would be similar to the first debate with President Joe
Biden, who has since dropped his reelection bid, Trump said in a post on
Truth Social late Friday. But this time it would have a “full arena
audience” and take place in the battleground state of Pennsylvania,
Trump said. </p>
<p>Trump and Biden had agreed to a second debate on September 10 on ABC
News which the former president had suggested should be moved to Fox,
the most popular network with his followers. </p>
<p>Harris, who on Friday secured the delegate votes needed to clinch the
Democratic nomination for the November 5 election, said Saturday that
she plans to participate in the originally planned debate. </p>
<p>“It’s interesting how ‘any time, any place’ becomes ‘one specific
time, one specific safe space,’” she wrote on social media platform X.
“I’ll be there on Sept. 10, like he agreed to. I hope to see him
there.” </p>
<p>Trump ‘running scared,’ says Harris camp</p>
<p>Harris spokesperson Michael Tyler said Trump is “running scared” and
that her campaign is happy to discuss further debates after the
September 10 one that “both campaigns have already agreed to.” </p>
<p>On Saturday, Trump said on Truth Social that Harris is “afraid to do
it” and that he will see her on September 4, “or I won’t see her at
all.” </p>
<p>On Friday he said that the ABC debate had been “terminated” in that
Biden would no longer be in it and because he himself was in litigation
with ABC. </p>
<p>ABC on July 26 outlined qualification requirements for the debate but
did not mention any candidates by name. </p>
<p>Requirements include proving polling support and state ballot access
by September 3. </p>
<p>Recent polls show a tight contest between Harris and Trump, who had
enjoyed a bigger lead over Biden after the first debate. </p>
<p>ABC News had no comment about whether Trump had dropped out of the
debate, a spokesperson said. </p>
<p>Fox News did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p>
<p>Trump’s proposal for the debate on Fox came right after the
Democratic National Committee launched an advertising campaign Friday
taunting him by saying “the convicted felon is afraid to debate” and
questioning whether that is due to his stance on abortion. </p>
<p>David Plouffe, an adviser to former President Barack Obama who
recently joined the Harris campaign, posted on social media: “Now, he
seems only comfortable in a cocoon, asking his happy place Fox to host a
Trump rally and call it a debate. Maybe he can only handle debating
someone his own age.” </p>
<p>Trump is 78 and Harris is 59. </p>
<p>Former Democratic President Jimmy Carter, who turns 100 on Oct. 1,
said, “I’m only trying to make it to vote for Kamala Harris,” the
Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported Saturday.</p>

battle California wildfire ahead of storms, lightning</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>chico, california — Firefighters made progress Saturday against
California’s largest wildfire of the year ahead of expected
thunderstorms that could unleash fire-starting lightning and erratic
winds and erode progress made over the past week. Dry, hot conditions
posed similar threats across the fire-stricken West. </p>
<p>“We’re not completely out of the woods yet, but we’re looking very,
very good,” CalFire official Mark Brunton said in a video update
Saturday. “This is moving at a very fast pace.” </p>
<p>Containment of the Park Fire, now California’s fourth-largest
wildfire on record, is at 27% as of early Saturday. Brunton said the
relatively milder weather the last few days allowed firefighters to
build containment lines. </p>
<p>But hotter weather, fuels and terrain will continue posing challenges
for the estimated 6,500 firefighters battling the fire, which has spread
over 1,621 square kilometers since allegedly being started by arson in a
park in the Sierra Nevada foothills east of the Sacramento Valley city
of Chico. For comparison, the city of Los Angeles covers about 1,302
square kilometers. </p>
<p>Suppression crews will also start removing damaged infrastructure in
some areas Saturday to allow residents to return home. </p>
<p>The fire originated at low elevations, where it quickly burned
through thick grass and oaks, destroying at least 567 structures and
damaging 51 so far. As it has climbed higher, the vegetation has changed
to a greater concentration of trees and brush, Cal Fire said. </p>
<p>The fire’s push northward has brought it toward the rugged lava rock
landscape surrounding Lassen Volcanic National Park, which has been
closed because of the threat. </p>
<p>“There’s a lot of really steep drainages in that area,” CalFire
spokesperson Devin Terrill said. “It takes a lot more time to access
those areas.” </p>
<p>After a brief respite, firefighters are now bracing for treacherous
conditions of hot and dry weather, along with expected thunderstorms
with potential thunder strikes and gusty winds. </p>
<p>The collapse of thunderstorm clouds can blow wind in any and all
directions, said Jonathan Pangburn, a fire behavior analyst with Cal
Fire. “Even if there’s not lightning per se, it is very much a
safety-watch-out environment for our firefighters out there,” Pangburn
said. </p>
<p>The Park Fire is among almost 100 large fires burning across the
western U.S. Evacuation orders were in effect for 28 of the fires,
according to the National Interagency Fire Center. </p>
<p>Three wildfires burned in Colorado on Friday near heavily populated
areas north and south of Denver, with about 50 structures damaged or
destroyed, thousands of people under evacuation orders, and human
remains found in a destroyed house earlier this week. </p>
<p>The Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office is investigating a blaze
threatening hundreds of homes near the Colorado city of Littleton as
arson. </p>
<p>Karlyn Tilley, a spokesperson for Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office,
said the investigation is ongoing and they are using a dog specially
trained to sniff out sources and causes of fires. Tilley said just
because they suspect the fire was human-caused doesn’t mean it was
intentional. </p>
<p>Firefighters were making good progress on the fire despite the steep,
rocky terrain and blistering heat, and no houses had been burned,
officials said. </p>
<p>The cause and origin of a fatal blaze west of the town of Lyons was
being probed by the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and
Explosives, with specially trained fire investigators from the agency
helping local authorities, agency spokesperson Crystal McCoy said. The
area blackened by that fire remained relatively unchanged after it
burned five houses. </p>
<p>The largest of the Colorado fires, west of Loveland, grew to 38.5
square kilometers after previously burning 49 homes and other
structures. Its cause is under investigation. </p>
<p>Scientists say extreme wildfires are becoming more common and
destructive in the U.S. West and other parts of the world as climate
change warms the planet and droughts become more severe.</p>

and Conditional GET issues</a>.

<h2 id="netnewswire-and-conditional-get-issues">NetNewsWire and
Conditional GET Issues</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-03, from: Innessential (Brint Simmons’ blog)</p>
<p>
I had thought that NetNewsWire’s conditional GET support was rock-solid
— and so my first reaction was to be very surprised to
<a href="https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2024/08/02/fs/">learn that it’s
not</a>!
</p>
<p>
My second reaction was to be appreciative — Rachel’s work here on
setting up a test server and reporting on the results is really great.
My goal has always been to make NetNewsWire a model net citizen, and
learning where it’s not is super valuable. So: much respect and thanks
to Rachel for this.
</p>
<h4 id="the-data">
The Data
</h4>
<p>
Let’s look at some data and try to figure out what’s happening.
<a href="https://rachelbythebay.com/api/fsr/4467c09c31370b8375c6b2a320aa77cd5d999cd4">Here’s
Rachel’s report for NetNewsWire</a>.
</p>
<p>
Things to know: these are all requests for a NetNewsWire-specific feed,
and the copy of NetNewsWire making these requests is on my personal
laptop. That laptop is occasionally used for development, which can
throw things off, but not often. You can even see in the data a gap
lasting just over two weeks where there were no requests (I was on
vacation).
</p>
<p>
(You can also see some anomalies from when I had it on my dev machine
also — ignore every row where ip is v6, since that’s my dev machine.)
</p>
<p>
Another thing to know: this is testing direct feed-reading, as with the
On My Mac (or iPhone/iPad) and iCloud accounts. With systems such as
Feedly, Feedbin, and so on, we get the data from the sync system and not
directly from the site.
</p>
<h4 id="ignoring-timing-issues">
Ignoring Timing Issues
</h4>
<p>
Let’s set aside, at least for today, the timing issues. That situation
could be improved, but it very much reflects that this is a desktop app
with a command that allows you to refresh feeds manually, without having
to wait for the next poll.
</p>
<h4 id="conditional-get-issues">
Conditional GET Issues
</h4>
<p>
First, a refresher on how this should work.
</p>
<p>
When a server returns a Last-Modified header, the client should return
that exact same string in follow-up requests in an If-Modified-Since
header. The server then looks at the If-Modified-Since header and
decides to either return a 200 plus the feed — if it <em>has</em> been
modified since — or return a 304 Not Modified response and an empty
body.
</p>
<p>
It’s the same story with the Etag header. The client should save it and
return it in follow-up requests in an If-None-Match header.
</p>
<p>
This is great because it can save a ton of bandwidth, which is great for
server and app alike. And NetNewsWire’s been doing this since the early
2000s.
</p>
<p>
But clearly there’s a bug! In some cases, NetNewsWire is not picking up
and saving the changed Last-Modified and Etag headers. Sometimes it
does, and sometimes it keeps using whatever it already had and ignores
the new ones.
</p>
<p>
What could account for this? Let’s look at the logic.
</p>
<h4 id="feed-processing-logic">
Feed processing logic
</h4>
<p>
Here’s what happens when a feed download completes without errors and
the content is non-empty:
</p>
<p>
First we check the hash of the raw feed data against the hash of the raw
feed data the last time it actually changed. If those hashes match, then
the app stops processing, because the feed hasn’t changed: it’s exactly
the same as last time.
</p>
<p>
This is an optimization that deals with the fact that many servers
unfortunately don’t support conditional GET. It allows the app to skip
feed parsing and updating the database. Saves a bunch of work. Good for
battery life.
</p>
<p>
If the hashes don’t match, then processing continues: it parses the feed
and then sends the parsed articles to the code that updates the
database.
</p>
<p>
After that it updates and saves the hash of the raw feed data, and
finally it stores the conditional GET info — it saves any Last-Modified
and Etag header values to send with the next request.
</p>
<p>
This isn’t actually the code, but it’s what the logic looks like:
</p>
<pre><code>downloadDidComplete(httpResponse, feed, feedData)
    hash = feedData.md5
    if hash == feed.previousHash then return
    parsedFeed = parse(feedData)
    updateDatabase(feed, parsedFeed)
    feed.previousHash = hash
    feed.conditionalGetInfo = conditionalGetInfoFromResponse(httpResponse)
</code></pre>
<h4 id="my-theory">
My theory
</h4>
<p>
There’s a great chance you’ve already spotted what I think is the issue:
it’s that optimization where we check the hash of the raw feed data and
return if it matches the previous hash.
</p>
<p>
Here’s what I think has happened in some of the tests: the raw feed data
was unchanged, but one or both of the Last-Modified and Etag header
values <em>did</em> change.
</p>
<p>
NetNewsWire never picked up the changes to those headers, because that
code didn’t run — it had already bailed when it saw that the raw feed
data was unchanged.
</p>
<p>
The assumption I made when I wrote this code was that if the raw feed
data was unchanged then of course the Last-Modified and Etag header
values would be unchanged too, so there was no need to check to see if
they were new.
</p>
<p>
And I think that in real-world situations this is probably true pretty
much all the time, and it’s only in tests like this where my assumption
wouldn’t be true.
</p>
<p>
But I can’t say that for sure! This is a real bug, and we’ll fix it and
add a test or tests to make sure it doesn’t happen again.
</p>
<p>
Here’s what the new logic should look like:
</p>
<pre><code>downloadDidComplete(httpResponse, feedData, feed)
    hash = feedData.md5
    if hash != feed.previousHash {
        parsedFeed = parse(feedData)
        updateDatabase(feed, parsedFeed)
        feed.previousHash = hash
    }
    feed.conditionalGetInfo = conditionalGetInfoFromResponse(httpResponse)
</code></pre>
<p>
With the above logic, conditionalGetInfo gets updated no matter what.
</p>
<h4 id="ps-there-could-be-other-bugs">
PS There could be other bugs
</h4>
<p>
My theory does point to a bug that should get fixed. But is it the only
bug? Is it even the bug that causes the issues in these tests?
</p>
<p>
Though I’m pretty confident that this is the bug — seems pretty obvious,
right? — more investigation and testing is warranted.

Vance head to Georgia after Harris event in same arena</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ATLANTA, GEORGIA — Former President Donald Trump returns Saturday to
Georgia, which he lost four years ago, to campaign in a state that
Democrats and Republicans see as up for grabs yet again.</p>
<p>Trump’s 5 p.m. event alongside his running mate, Ohio Senator JD
Vance, comes just days after Vice President Kamala Harris rallied
thousands in the same basketball arena at Georgia State University in
Atlanta.</p>
<p>Both parties are focusing on Georgia, a Sun Belt battleground that
Democrats had signaled just two weeks ago they would sideline in favor
of a heavier focus on the Midwestern “blue wall” states. President Joe
Biden’s decision to end his campaign and endorse Harris fueled
Democratic hopes of an expanded electoral map.</p>
<p>“The momentum in this race is shifting,” Harris told a cheering,
boisterous crowd on Tuesday. “And there are signs Donald Trump is
feeling it.”</p>
<p>Biden beat Trump in the state by 11,779 votes in 2020. Trump
pressured Georgia’s Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to
“find” enough votes to change the outcome. Trump was later indicted in
Georgia for his efforts to overturn the election, but the case remains
on hold while courts decide whether the Fulton County district attorney
can continue to prosecute it.</p>
<p>In announcing Saturday’s rally, the Trump campaign accused Harris of
costing Georgians money due to inflation and higher gas prices, which
have risen from pandemic-era lows at the end of the Trump
administration. The campaign also noted the case of Laken Riley, a
nursing student from the state who was killed while jogging in a park on
February 22. A Venezuelan citizen has been indicted on murder charges in
her death.</p>
<p>Trump and his allies have repeatedly labeled Harris the current
administration’s “border czar,” a reference to her assignment leading
White House efforts on root causes of migration.</p>
<p>But in recent days, Trump has lobbed false attacks about Harris’ race
and suggested she misled voters about her identity. Harris has stated
for years in public life that she is Black and Indian American.</p>
<p>At her rally in Atlanta, Harris called Trump and Vance “plain weird”
— a lane of messaging seized on by many other Democrats of late — and
taunted Trump for wavering on whether he’d show up for their upcoming
debate, currently on the books for September 10 on ABC.</p>
<p>Saying earlier that he would debate Harris, Trump has more recently
questioned the value of a meetup, calling host network ABC News “fake
news,” saying he “probably” will debate Harris, but he “can also make a
case for not doing it.”</p>
<p>The fact that Harris and Trump have been focusing resources on
Georgia underscores the state’s renewed significance to both parties
come November. Going to Atlanta puts Trump in the state’s largest media
market, including suburbs and exurbs that were traditional Republican
strongholds but have become more competitive as they’ve diversified and
grown in population.</p>
<p>In a strategy memo released after Biden left the race, Harris
campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon — who held the same role for Biden —
reaffirmed the importance of winning the traditional Democratic blue
wall trio of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania but also argued that
Harris’ place atop the ticket “opens up additional persuadable voters”
and described them as “disproportionately Black, Latino and under 30” in
places like Georgia.</p>
<p>Next week, along with her eventual running mate, Harris plans to
visit that Midwestern trifecta, along with North Carolina, Arizona and
Nevada. On Friday, she will make another stop in Georgia.</p>

<h2 id="call-for-startups">Call for startups</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-03, from: Ben Werdmuller’s blog</p>
<div class="e-content entry-content">
<p>
<img src="https://werd.io/file/66ae5659ec5999fbf003fdd2/thumb.jpg" alt="Two people working on a startup, probably." width="1024" height="576">
</p>
<p>
I don’t invest any more, but here are some areas I’d be interested to
see startups explore:
</p>
<p>
<strong>The hallway track for remote and hybrid teams.</strong> One
reason many companies are enacting return to office policies is to
re-establish cross-pollination across teams. Yes, a strong, intentional
remote culture would render that moot, but not every company
<em>has</em> that. So what does it look like to build scaffolding that
goes beyond the water cooler and intentionally surfaces ideas and
reactions across teams, including across timezones? Slack is a set of
chatrooms at heart — what if you optimize for asynchronous reflection
and building on ideas, not just real-time discussion?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Composable, local AI made easy.</strong> There are lots of use
cases for AI in the enterprise, but for many high-value use cases
sharing data with centralized services owned by OpenAI, Microsoft, or
Google isn’t tenable. Sensitive data needs to be treated carefully, and
protective contract terms often aren’t enough (consider what happens
when a provider is subpoenaed, for example). Let’s make building AI
tools that don’t share data beyond your local computer incredibly easy,
even for people who can’t code.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Pro tools for the fediverse.</strong> The fediverse is going to
continue to grow, in part because of the maturity of its underlying
technology, and in part because countries across the world are
tightening anti-monopoly rules, creating strong business reasons to
adopt open standards and interoperability. Many fediverse platforms and
services don’t meet the needs of larger organizations or professional
use cases, due to the wrong mix or features or a more technical user
experience. How can startups remove friction from taking advantage of
the fediverse, and add ecosystem tools that grow in value as more users
onboard? (By the way, I still think an API service that helps people
build tools on the fediverse has legs.)
</p>
<p>
<strong>Substack (or Ghost) for indie and open source
developers.</strong> Substack and Ghost have paved the way for a kind of
journalist entrepreneur who can launch a subscription and make a living
by themselves. What if we could do the same thing for indie developers
who wanted to support their work? Imagine built-in subscriptions
connected to a social discovery mechanism where developers recommend
other developers’ work: a network that makes it far easier for
developers to make a living from doing what they love independently.
This is particularly important in a world where many developers have
left big cities and are resisting return to office mandates: going it
alone could be a viable alternative. Kickstarter et al let people
support a <em>project</em>; this would allow you to support the creator,
with more network effects and built-in software integrations than
something like a Patreon.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Metrics in a box.</strong> A tool that connects to your
analytics, payment processor, newsletter tool, etc, and automatically
gives you insights, generates actionable reports on your preferred
cadence, and answers questions without you needing to deal with schemas,
configure specific views, or make queries yourself. You could refine its
outputs by giving it feedback in natural language, and ask questions
using the same. Another way of putting this: what if your in-house data
analyst was software that you didn’t need to configure?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Redefine the US rail experience.</strong> Private rail cars (or
— more ambitiously — whole trains?) that operate a bit like a WeWork:
luxury accommodations, high-bandwidth satellite wifi, phone call booths,
desks, private rooms with comfortable beds. Make it easy to choose to
take a long-distance train instead of a flight without sacrificing
comfort or connectivity. High-speed rail is great and important, and
such a business would expand to get there, but in the meantime this
experience would make the longer travel time matter a great deal less,
while helping business travelers to lower their carbon footprint. One
can imagine this initially working best between destinations like Miami
and New York, or San Francisco and LA, but the real goal would be
nationwide. (Hey, dream big.)
</p>
<p>
<strong>Magic for the elderly.</strong> A lot of people swear by
services like Magic’s executive assistant offering: a way for executives
and entrepreneurs to get remote help with doing important work. But we
all need help as we get older. What does it look like for older people
to get their own executive assistants to help them with administration
and life’s daily chores?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Open bookkeeping and administration for distributed
groups.</strong> There’s plenty of bookkeeping and administration
software out there. Most of it is understandably privacy-focused,
allowing very few people to access your sensitive information. But what
happens if you’re part of a group — an extended family managing a house,
say, or a loose co-operative — that needs to have a shared view of their
finances and administration? There’s very little for them beyond, say,
Open Collective, which is for a very specific kind of organizational
unit. What does it look like for a group to share and stream their
finances and decisions?
</p>
<p>
—
</p>
<p>
It’s been six years (gulp) since I last invested in a startup as part of
any kind of fund, but I’m still excited by the idea and the ethos of
startups. While there are plenty of bad businesses out there (for any
definition of “bad”), the idea of a group of people getting together and
trying to build a new, useful product as part of a sustainable business
engine really appeals to me. There’s definitely a part of me that wishes
I still could make financial bets into ventures. (Let’s be clear: I
could never have invested in an idea like reinventing rail travel. That
wasn’t my area. But wouldn’t it be cool?)
</p>
<p>
I really like <a href="https://homebrew.co/philosophy">Homebrew’s
investment process statement</a>, which is very close to how I’d want to
do it too (commit the time and energy to help build an ethical,
enduring, high-quality business). And this piece in particular stands
out to me:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We invest in mission-driven founders who embrace big – big ideas, big
impact, big risk.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The combination of real mission, impact, and risk is important. That’s
where the exciting stuff is.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://greylock.com/">Greylock</a>, the veteran Silicon Valley
venture capital firm, recently put out
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/call-startups-greylock-partners-93fuc/">a
call for startups</a> that was all AI, all the time. Long-time readers
will know that I have a contrarian take on that — and that I worry AI is
sucking oxygen away from other, genuinely useful products that could
form the basis of great businesses. I also don’t shy away from AI
completely: there are real applications for the technology that will
linger long after the hype cycle has died down. Still, their post was
the inspiration for this one: I think there are more interesting,
broader, longer-term trends that are worth paying attention to.
</p>
<p>
What are you excited by? If you were an investor — or if you are — what
would you be keeping your eye out for?

ends touring, citing permanent damage to singer’s voice</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — Aerosmith says Steven Tyler’s voice has been
permanently damaged by a vocal cord injury last year and the band will
no longer tour.</p>
<p>The iconic band behind hits such as “Love in an Elevator” and “Livin’
on the Edge” posted a statement Friday announcing the cancellation of
remaining dates on its tour and provided an update on Tyler’s voice.</p>
<p>“He has spent months tirelessly working on getting his voice to where
it was before his injury. We’ve seen him struggling despite having the
best medical team by his side. Sadly, it is clear that a full recovery
from his vocal injury is not possible,” the statement said. “We have
made a heartbreaking and difficult, but necessary, decision — as a band
of brothers — to retire from the touring stage.”</p>
<p>Tyler announced he injured his vocal cords in September during a show
on the band’s Peace Out: The Farewell Tour. Tyler said in an Instagram
statement at the time that the injury caused bleeding but that he hoped
the band would be back after postponing a few shows.</p>
<p>Tyler’s soaring vocals have powered Aerosmith’s massive catalog of
hits since its formation in 1970, including “Dream On,” “Walk This Way”
and “Sweet Emotion.” They were near the start of a 40-date farewell tour
when Tyler was injured.</p>
<p>“We’ve always wanted to blow your mind when performing. As you know,
Steven’s voice is an instrument like no other,” the band said in
Friday’s statement to fans.</p>
<p>“It has been the honor of our lives to have our music become part of
yours,” the band said. “In every club, on every massive tour and at
moments grand and private you have given us a place in the soundtrack of
your lives.”</p>
<p>Aerosmith is a Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame inductee and a four-time
Grammy-winning band. In addition to Tyler, its members are Joe Perry,
Brad Whitford, Tom Hamilton and Joey Kramer.</p>

id="as-recruiting-rebounds-us-army-expands-basic-training-for-modern-warfare">As
recruiting rebounds, US Army expands basic training for modern
warfare</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Buoyed by an increase in recruiting, the U.S. Army will
expand its basic combat training in what its leaders hope reflects a
turning point as it prepares to meet the challenges of future wars.</p>
<p>The added training will begin in October and comes as the Army tries
to reverse years of dismal recruiting when it failed to meet its
enlistment goals. New units in the U.S. states of Oklahoma and Missouri
will train as many as 4,000 recruits every year.</p>
<p>Army leaders are optimistic they will hit their target of 55,000
recruits this year and say the influx of new soldiers forced them to
increase the number of training sites.</p>
<p>“I am happy to say last year’s recruiting transformation efforts have
us on track to make this year’s recruiting mission, with thousands
awaiting basic training” in the next year, U.S. Army Secretary Christine
Wormuth said. Adding the two new locations, she said, is a way to get
the soldiers trained and into units quickly, “with further expansion
likely next spring if our recruiting numbers keep improving.”</p>
<p>The expanded training is part of a broader effort to restructure the
Army so that it is better able to fight against a sophisticated
adversary such as Russia or China. The U.S. military spent much of the
past two decades battling insurgent groups in Iraq and Afghanistan
rather than fighting a broader war with another high-tech, more capable
nation.</p>
<p>Brigadier General Jenn Walkawicz, head of operations for the U.S.
Army’s Training and Doctrine Command, said there will be two new
training companies at Fort Sill in Oklahoma and two at Fort Leonard Wood
in Missouri.</p>
<p>Driving the growth is the successful Future Soldier Prep Course,
which was created at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, in August 2022 as a
new way to bolster enlistments. That program gives lower-performing
recruits up to 90 days of academic or fitness instruction to help them
meet military standards and move on to basic training.</p>
<p>Created two years ago, the program has been cited as a key reason
Army leaders expect that this fall they will reverse several years of
recruiting shortfalls. In the budget year that ended September 30, the
Army brought in a bit more than 50,000 recruits, falling far short of
the publicly stated “stretch goal” of 65,000.</p>
<p>The Army has 151 training companies overall that work with recruits
at Fort Jackson and Fort Moore, Georgia, in addition to the 15 training
companies assigned to the prep course. Army leaders have expanded the
prep course, which is expected to bring in nearly 20,000 recruits this
budget year, and that total is expected to spike in 2025.</p>
<p>Due to the Army’s recruiting struggles, the number of recruits going
through basic training dropped in recent years. As a result, the 15
training units, which total 27 soldiers each, including 16 drill
sergeants, were available for the prep course. But as the prep course
grows, those units are not available to do basic training.</p>
<p>“We don’t want to mess with that because right now that formula’s
working and it’s provided a lot of value for the Army,” Walkawicz said.
So, the Army is creating the four new companies and has developed plans
for more if needed.</p>
<p>She added that Fort Sill and Fort Leonard Wood have the
infrastructure, barracks and room to accommodate the new units and could
take more if needed. The costs of the program are limited because the
Army already had the equipment and rooms, but there will be maintenance,
food, staffing and other costs. Army officials did not provide a total
price.</p>
<p>The move to add units is the latest change in what has been a
tumultuous time for the Army. Coming out of the Iraq and Afghanistan
wars, when the service grew dramatically to fill the nation’s combat
needs, the U.S. military began to see recruiting dip.</p>
<p>Unemployment has been low, corporate jobs pay well and offer good
benefits, and, according to estimates, just 23% of people ages 17 to 24
are physically, mentally and morally qualified to serve without
receiving some type of waiver. Moral behavior issues include drug use,
gang ties or a criminal record.</p>
<p>Those problems were only amplified as the coronavirus pandemic took
hold, preventing recruiters from meeting with students in person at
schools, fairs and other public events.</p>
<p>In 2022, the Army fell 15,000 short of its enlistment goal of 60,000,
and the other services had to dig deep into their pools of delayed entry
candidates to meet their recruiting numbers. Then in 2023, the Army,
Navy and Air Force all missed their recruitment targets. The Marine
Corps and the tiny Space Force have consistently hit their goals.</p>
<p>Partly in response to the recruiting shortfalls, Army leaders slashed
the size of the force by about 24,000, or almost 5%. They said many of
the cuts were in already vacant jobs.</p>

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“In the most recent financial quarter, Apple generated $24.4 billion in
revenue from Services. The Mac, iPad, and wearables categories together
generated just $22.3 billion. Only the iPhone is more important to
Apple’s top line than Services.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is an interesting piece about how Apple’s services revenue is set
to overtake its hardware business.
</p>
<p>
Over on his blog Pixel Envy,
<a href="https://pxlnv.com/linklog/apple-services-revenue/">Nick Heer
worries</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“It would be disappointing if Apple sees its hardware products
increasingly as vehicles for recurring revenue.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I’d go further. The beauty of Apple’s product line is that they’re
comparatively well-made products that push the boundaries of user
experience, bringing technology breakthroughs to a creative audience: as
Jobs put it, “bicycles for the mind”. Customers (including me) accept
higher prices because the products are exceptional, but that depends on
a product line that is complete.
</p>
<p>
If the product offering is a higher-priced hardware device <em>and</em>
premium monthly services on top of it, the investment starts to have
diminishing returns. It’s a loss of focus on what made Apple great, and
why people keep coming back to it. It’s greed, essentially: continuing
to push the Apple user base further and further, assuming the breaking
point is very far out.
</p>
<p>
That puts them at risk from being disrupted by someone else. Windows
ain’t it, but at some point someone is going to come in with a really
great set of hardware on an alternative stack. The question won’t be
whether it beats Apple as-is, but simply whether it’s good
<em>enough</em> at a lower price point. And then that company will grow
their offerings, until before you know it, Apple has serious
competition. It’s disruption 101, and the further Apple pushes out its
expense and friction, the more susceptible it becomes.

<p>Another month, another chunk of progress for the Servo rendering
engine. The biggest addition is enabling table rendering to be spread
across CPU cores. Parallel table layout is now enabled, spreading the
work for laying out rows and their columns over all available CPU cores.
This change is a great example of the strengths of Rayon and the
opportunistic parallelism in Servo’s layout engine. ↫ Servo blog On top
of this, there’s tons of improvements to the flexbox layout engine,
support generic font families like ‘sans-serif’ and ‘monospace’ has been
added, and Servo now supports OpenHarmony, the operating system
developed by Huawei. This month also saw a lot of work on the
development tools.</p>

id="minority-farmers-set-for-2-billion-from-usda-after-years-of-discrimination">Minority
farmers set for $2 billion from USDA after years of discrimination</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>COLUMBIA, Missouri — The Biden administration has doled out more than
$2 billion in direct payments for Black and other minority farmers
discriminated against by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the
president announced Wednesday.</p>
<p>More than 23,000 farmers were approved for payments ranging from
$10,000 to $500,000, according to the USDA. Another 20,000 who planned
to start a farm but did not receive a USDA loan received between $3,500
and $6,000.</p>
<p>Most payments went to farmers in Mississippi and Alabama.</p>
<p>USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack told reporters that the aid “is not
compensation for anyone’s loss or the pain endured, but it is an
acknowledgment by the department.”</p>
<p>The USDA has a long history of refusing to process loans from Black
farmers, approving smaller loans compared to white farmers, and in some
cases foreclosing quicker than usual when Black farmers who obtained
loans ran into problems.</p>
<p>National Black Farmers Association Founder and President John Boyd
Jr. said the aid is helpful. But, he said, it’s not enough.</p>
<p>“It’s like putting a bandage on somebody that needs open-heart
surgery,” Boyd said. “We want our land, and I want to be very, very
clear about that.”</p>
<p>Boyd is still fighting a federal lawsuit for 120% debt relief for
Black farmers that was approved by Congress in 2021. Five billion
dollars for the program was included in the $1.9 trillion COVID-19
stimulus package.</p>
<p>But the money never came. White farmers in several states filed
lawsuits arguing their exclusion was a violation of their constitutional
rights, which prompted judges to halt the program shortly after its
passage.</p>
<p>Faced with the likelihood of a lengthy court battle that would delay
payments to farmers, Congress amended the law and offered financial help
to a broader group of farmers. A new law allocated $3.1 billion to help
farmers struggling with USDA-backed loans and $2.2 billion to pay
farmers who the agency discriminated against.</p>
<p>Wardell Carter, who is Black, said no one in his farming family got
so much as access to a loan application since Carter’s father bought
34.4 hectares of Mississippi land in 1939. He said USDA loan officers
would slam the door in his face. If Black farmers persisted, Carter said
officers would have police come to their homes.</p>
<p>Without a loan, Carter’s family could not afford a tractor and
instead used a horse and mule for years. And without proper equipment,
the family could farm at most 16.2 hectares of their property — cutting
profits.</p>
<p>When they finally received a bank loan to buy a tractor, Carter said
the interest rate was 100%.</p>
<p>Boyd said he’s watched as his loan applications were torn up and
thrown in the trash, been called racial epithets, and was told to leave
in the middle of loan meetings so the officer could speak to white
farmers.</p>
<p>“We face blatant, in-your-face, real discrimination,” Boyd said. “And
I did personally. The county person who was making farm loans spat
tobacco juice on me during a loan session.”</p>
<p>At 65, Carter said he’s too old to farm his land. But he said if he
receives money through the USDA program, he will use it to get his
property in shape so his nephew can begin farming on it again. Carter
said he and his family want to pitch in to buy his nephew a tractor,
too.</p>

id="simone-biles-raises-gymnastics-bar-so-high-that-5-skills-bear-her-name">Simone
Biles raises gymnastics bar so high that 5 skills bear her name</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>paris — It is not enough — it has never been enough — for Simone
Biles to do gymnastics.</p>
<p>The 27-year-old American star has been intent almost from the start
on pushing the sport in new directions by doing things that have never
been done before. That could continue this week when she tries for her
eighth Olympic medal in Paris.</p>
<p>Five elements currently bear her name in the Code of Points after she
successfully completed them in an international competition: two on
vault, two on floor exercise and one on balance beam.</p>
<p>A quick primer.</p>
<p>Biles I (Floor exercise version)</p>
<p>She was just a teenager and recently minted national champion when
Biles performed a tumbling pass at the 2013 world championships that she
completes by doing a double layout with a half-twist at the end.</p>
<p>The move looks dangerous — Biles is essentially flying blind — but
she and former coach Aimee Boorman came up with it because it was less
taxing on her legs.</p>
<p>“It was almost kind of necessity is the mother of invention,” Boorman
told The Associated Press in 2015. “Her calf was hurting. She had bone
spurs in her ankles and she’s really good at floor with landings.”</p>
<p>Biles II (floor exercise version)</p>
<p>Biles returned to the sport in 2018 following a two-year layoff after
winning the all-around at the 2016 Olympics.</p>
<p>Not content to merely repeat herself, Biles began working on a
triple-twisting, double flip that is now known simply as ” the
triple-double.” She unveiled it while winning the 2019 U.S.
Championships then did it again at the world championships a few months
later when she won the fifth of her record six world all-around
titles.</p>
<p>“I wanted to see how it looked,” she explained afterward.</p>
<p>Biles I (vault version)</p>
<p>As with a lot of gymnastics elements, Biles took a Cheng vault and
added another layer of difficulty — this one an extra half twist on a
vault originally done by China’s Cheng Fei.</p>
<p>The vault requires Biles to do a round-off onto the vault, then a
half-twist onto the table before doing two full twists. It entered the
Code after she made it part of her routine at the 2018 world
championships.</p>
<p>“I’m embarrassed to do floor and vault after something like that,”
U.S. men’s gymnast Yul Moldauer said in 2018. “You see Simone do that
and she’s smiling the whole time. How does she do that?”</p>
<p>Biles II (vault version)</p>
<p>This may be the most dazzling, most daring one of them all.</p>
<p>The Yurchenko double pike had never been completed by a woman in
competition, and few men have even tried. She began tinkering with it in
2021, but it’s in the last year that it has morphed into perhaps the
most show-stopping thing done in the sport.</p>
<p>The vault asks Biles to do a round-off back handspring onto the
table, then two backward flips in pike position with her hands
essentially clasped to her knees. She does it with so much power, she
can sometimes overcook it. At the U.S. Olympic trials last month, it
drew a standing ovation.</p>
<p>“No, it’s not normal,” longtime coach Laurent Landi said after she
drilled it at the 2023 U.S. Championships. “She’s not normal.”</p>
<p>Biles I (balance beam version)</p>
<p>For all of her explosive tumbling, Biles is a wonder on balance beam,
too, where she can make doing intricate moves on a four-inch-wide piece
of wood seem almost casual.</p>
<p>The same year she debuted the triple-double on floor, she added a
double-twisting, double-tucked dismount off the beam. She stuck it at
the 2019 world championships, though she has since taken it out of her
repetoire.</p>
<p>What does the new uneven bars skill look like?</p>
<p>The skill Biles submitted requires her to do a forward circle around
the lower bar before turning a handstand into a 540-degree pirouette.
USA Gymnastics teased the move on X ahead of the Games. She didn’t
attempt it during the team or all-around competitions but still won gold
in both.</p>

<p>date: 2024-08-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>HONOLULU — College wasn’t on Keith Nove Baniqued’s mind after her
family’s home burned down in a deadly wildfire that decimated her Hawaii
town. The 17-year-old, who was 7 when she moved to Maui from the
Philippines, was about to start her senior year of high school but
shifted her focus to her family’s struggles to find a place to live amid
the tragedy.</p>
<p>Nearly a year after the fire that destroyed thousands of other homes
and killed 102 people in historic Lahaina, Baniqued is headed to the
University of Nevada, Las Vegas. And her family doesn’t have to worry
about how to pay for it, thanks to $325,000 in college scholarships
awarded Wednesday to 13 Lahainaluna High School graduates attending
schools on the U.S. mainland.</p>
<p>“Even being a senior, I really didn’t know if I was going to pursue
higher education anymore, only because I didn’t want to leave my family
in the situation that we were in,” she recalled of her feelings after
the fire.</p>
<p>Her school survived the blaze, but was closed for two months. The
reopening restored a small sense of normalcy and reignited her dream to
attend college beyond Hawaii’s shores. She also realized a college
degree would put her in a better position to help her family’s long-term
recovery.</p>
<p>She applied to colleges with nursing programs, channeled her feelings
about surviving the fire into scholarship essays and decided she would
attend UNLV — partly because its popularity among Hawaii students would
make it feel a bit like home.</p>
<p>Using a grant from the Maui Strong Fund of the Hawaii Community
Foundation, the Downtown Athletic Club of Hawaii is providing Baniqued
and her 12 classmates with about $25,000 each — meant to cover
out-of-state college costs after other scholarships and financial aid
for the first year.</p>
<p>“A lifechanging opportunity like this can be beneficial to any Hawaii
high school graduate, and even more so for Lahainaluna graduates and all
they’ve gone through,” said Keith Amemiya, president of athletic club,
which has been spearheading a fundraising campaign to support the
Lahainaluna student-athletes and coaches whose homes were destroyed by
the fire.</p>
<p>In a separate effort after the fire, the University of Hawaii
announced scholarships for 2024 Lahainaluna graduates to attend any
campus in the statewide system. Nearly 80% of a graduating class of 215
applied to UH campuses, according to school data. As of last week, 105
students had registered at a UH school, leading to a record-number of
college-bound Lahainaluna graduates, school officials said, who expect
that number to increase by mid-August.</p>
<p>Ginny Yasutake, a Lahainaluna counselor, reached out to Amemiya to
see if there was a way to do something similar to the UH scholarship for
student athletes who opted to leave Hawaii for college.</p>
<p>With help from the Hawaii Community Foundation, they found funding to
help even students who weren’t athletes. Both organizations are
committed to finding a way to provide the scholarships beyond freshman
year of out-of-state college and also to underclassmen affected by the
fire, Amemiya said.</p>
<p>“These scholarships kind of came in as a last-minute dream,” said
Principal Richard Carosso.</p>
<p>And the Hawaii scholarships provided an opportunity to many who never
thought college was even possible, he said.</p>
<p>Pursuing college highlights the resilience of a graduating class
whose freshman year of high school was disrupted by the beginning of the
COVID-19 pandemic, Carosso said.</p>
<p>Emily Hegrenes, headed to the University of California, Los Angeles,
wrote in her scholarship essay about how she had to find a way to train
as a swimmer because the Lahaina Aquatic Center was closed in a
restricted burn zone.</p>
<p>“But for my final high school season, I worked harder than ever to
recruit enough swimmers to hold team practice at a pool
forty-five-minutes away from my hometown,” she wrote. “With my Lahaina
cap on, I proudly dove straight into my fears.”</p>
<p>Talan Toshikiyo, who plans to attend Oxnard College in California,
said he aspires to become an engineer and attain financial stability
because it was already difficult for Native Hawaiians like him, and
other locals, to afford living in Hawaii before the fire.</p>
<p>“I hope Lahaina is not changed when I come back from the Mainland,”
he wrote in his essay. “I dream one day all the rent in Maui will be
lower so locals will be able to afford it and not have to move far far
away.”</p>

deaths of people without air conditioning underscore inequity</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PHOENIX, ARIZONA — Mexican farm worker Avelino Vazquez Navarro didn’t
have air conditioning in the motor home where he died last month in
Washington state as temperatures surged into the triple digits.</p>
<p>For the last dozen years, the 61-year-old spent much of the year
working near Pasco, Washington, sending money to his wife and daughters
in the Pacific coast state of Nayarit, Mexico, and traveling back every
Christmas.</p>
<p>Now, the family is raising money to bring his remains home.</p>
<p>“If this motor home would have had AC and it was running, then it
most likely would have helped,” said Franklin County Coroner Curtis
McGary, who determined Vazquez Navarro’s death was heat-related, with
alcohol intoxication as a contributing cause.</p>
<p>Most heat-related deaths involve homeless people living outdoors. But
those who die inside without sufficient cooling also are vulnerable.
They are typically older than 60, living alone and with a limited
income.</p>
<p>Underscoring the inequities around energy and access to air
conditioning as summers grow hotter, many victims are Black, Indigenous
or Latino, such as Vazquez Navarro.</p>
<p>“Air conditioning is not a luxury, it’s a necessity,” said Mark
Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors’
Association, which represents state energy assistance programs. “It’s a
public health issue, and it’s an affordability issue.”</p>
<p>The most vulnerable</p>
<p>People living in mobile homes or in aging trailers and RVs are
especially likely to lack proper cooling. Nearly a quarter of the indoor
heat deaths in Arizona’s Maricopa County last year were in those kinds
of dwellings, which are transformed into a broiling tin can by the
blazing desert sun.</p>
<p>“Mobile homes can really heat up because they don’t always have the
best insulation and are often made of metal,” said Dana Kennedy, AARP
director in Arizona, where many heat-related deaths occur.</p>
<p>Research shows mobile home dwellers are particularly at risk in
blistering hot Phoenix, where 45-degree Celsius (113 Fahrenheit) weather
is forecast for this weekend.</p>
<p>“People are exposed to the elements more than in other housing,” said
Patricia Solís, executive director of the Knowledge Exchange for
Resilience at Arizona State University, who worked on mapping hot
weather impacts on mobile home parks for a state preparedness plan.</p>
<p>Worse, some parks bar residents from making modifications that could
cool their homes, citing esthetic concerns. A new Arizona law required
parks for the first time this summer to let residents install cooling
methods such as window units, shade awnings and shutters.</p>
<p>In Arizona’s Maricopa County, home to Phoenix, 156 of 645
heat-related deaths last year occurred indoors in uncooled environments.
In most cases, a unit was present but was not working, was without
electricity or turned off, public health officials said.</p>
<p>One victim was Shirley Marie Kouplen, who died after being overcome
by high temperatures inside her Phoenix mobile home amid a heat wave
when the extension cord providing her electricity was unplugged.</p>
<p>Emergency responders recorded the 70-year-old widow’s body
temperature at 41.7 C (107.1 F). Kouplen, who was diabetic and had high
blood pressure, was rushed to a hospital, where she died.</p>
<p>Kouplen apparently was struggling financially, if the shabby
condition of her mobile home was any indication. It still sits on Lot
60, surrounded by a chain-link fence with a locked gate and a dirt
driveway overgrown with weeds.</p>
<p>It’s unclear how the cord got unplugged, if Kouplen had an
electricity account or how she got her power.</p>
<p>“Losing your air conditioning is now a life-threatening event,” said
Texas A&amp;M University climate scientist Andrew Dessler, who grew up
in hot, humid Houston in the 1970s. “You didn’t want to lose your air
conditioning, but it wasn’t going to kill you. And now it is.”</p>
<p>Arizona’s regulated utilities have been banned since 2022 from
cutting off power during the summer, following the 2018 death of a
72-year-old woman after Arizona Public Service disconnected her
electricity over a $51 debt.</p>
<p>Ann Porter, spokesperson for Arizona Public Service, which provides
electricity to homes in the park where Kouplen lived, said “due to
privacy concerns” the company could not say if she had an account at the
time of her death or in the past. Porter said the utility does not cut
power from June 1 to Oct. 15.</p>
<p>Cutoffs can occur after those dates if mounting debts are not
paid.</p>
<p>Arizona is among 19 states with shut-off protections, leaving about
half of the U.S. population without safeguards against losing
electricity during the summer, the National Energy Assistance Directors
Association said in a new study.</p>
<p>Almost 20% of very-low-income families have no air conditioning at
all, especially in places such as Washington state, where they weren’t
commonly installed before climate-fueled heat waves grew increasingly
stronger, more frequent and longer lasting.</p>
<p>Not only in the Southwest</p>
<p>In the Pacific Northwest, several hundred people died during a 2021
heat wave, prompting Portland, Oregon, to launch a program to provide
portable cooling units to vulnerable, low-income people.</p>
<p>Chicago, better known for its cold winters, saw a heat wave kill 739
mostly older people over five days in 1995. Amid high humidity and
temperatures over 37.7 C (100 F), most victims had no air conditioning
or couldn’t afford to turn on their units.</p>
<p>In 2022, Chicago adopted a cooling ordinance after three women died
in their apartments in a building for older adults on an unusually warm
spring day. Certain residential buildings must now have at least one
air-conditioned common area for cooling when the heat index exceeds 26.6
C (80 F) and cooling is unavailable in individual units.</p>
<p>Nonprofits in historically hotter areas such as Arizona also are
trying to better address the inequities low-income people face during
the sweltering summers. The Phoenix-based community agency Wildfire
recently raised money to buy over $2 million worth of air conditioning
equipment to help 150 households statewide over three years, Executive
Director Kelly McGowan said.</p>
<p>Laws protect renters in some places. Phoenix landlords must ensure
that air conditioning units cool to 28 C (82 F) or below and that
evaporative coolers lower the temperature to 30C (86 F).</p>
<p>Palm Springs, California, and Las Vegas, Nevada, both desert cities,
have ordinances requiring landlords to offer air conditioning in rental
dwellings. Dallas, where temperatures can pass 43.3 C (110 F) in the
summer, has a similar law.</p>
<p>But most renters pay their own electricity costs, leaving them to
agonize whether they can afford to even turn on the cooling or how high
to set the thermostat.</p>
<p>A new report estimates the average cost for U.S. families to keep
cool from June to September will grow nationwide by 7.9% this year, from
$661 in 2023 to $719 this summer.</p>
<p>Wolf noted the federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program,
which grants money to states to help families pay for heating and
cooling, is underfunded, with 80% going to heat homes in winter.</p>

<h2 id="the-blowing-smoke-up-your-ass-theory-of-ai">The “blowing smoke
up your ass” theory of AI</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-03, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Let me preface this by saying that I don’t believe the current AI tools are entirely useless. There probably are some good use cases out there and it’s an overall interesting tech. Having said that, I have some thoughts I want to share with you.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
I love technology. I’m not obsessed with it but I do enjoy staying up to
date with what’s happening in the tech world. This is both on the
hardware and on the software side of things. Sadly, the current state of
tech news is quite boring because it’s dominated by AI. AI this, AI
that. New AI companies cropping up, old companies pivoting to AI, and
companies that have no business being in the AI race announcing their AI
strategies. It’s everywhere. And yet, there are PLENTY of examples of
how bad this tech can be.
</p>
<p>
And yet, “people” keep being super optimistic. And when I say people, I
mean mostly developers. Because that’s my current theory: the vast
majority of the AI hype is driven by tech people who are struggling to
realise that AI is most useful in their line of work. Every time people
discuss AI the best example they can come up with for how useful these
tools are is coding. AI tools are—allegedly—great if you need help
coding something and you don’t know how to do it. Which is great, if
you’re a developer.
</p>
<p>
The current state of AI is filled with mostly nonsense. Just look at
what the big players are announcing. Google has tried to shove its
stupid AI thing inside search results and has failed spectacularly and
they’re now slowly retreating. Apple had an entire event dedicated to AI
to announce a smarter Siri and some smart—allegedly—writing aid. Cool, I
guess? OpenAi is announcing all sorts of tools that are cool tech demos
but I can’t see why the population at large should be excited about any
of that stuff.
</p>
<p>
I’m starting to believe that tech companies—and their VC companions—are
drinking way too much of their own Kool-Aid because they fail to realise
that the vast majority of the usefulness of AI tools can be found in the
industries that work on said tools. At least that’s my current theory.
But hey, I said it many times before, I’m a complete idiot and I’m happy
to be proven wrong. If you have a different theory I want to hear it so
get in touch or maybe ask your AI bot to get in touch with me.
</p>

<h2 id="what-makes-a-good-human-interface">What makes a good human
interface?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-03, from: The Sephist blog</p>
<p>
<em>When I discuss interfaces on this blog, I’m most often referring to
software interfaces: intermediating mechanisms from our human intentions
to computers and the knowledge within them. But the concept of a human
interface extends far before it and beyond it. I’ve been trying to build
myself a coherent mental framework for how to think about human
interfaces to knowledge and tools in general, even beyond
computers.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>This is the second of a pair of pieces on this topic. The other is
<a href="https://thesephist.com/posts/interface/">Instrumental
interfaces, engaged interfaces</a>.</em>
</p>
<hr>
<p>
What makes a user interface <em>good?</em>
</p>
<p>
What are the qualities we want in something that mediates our
relationship to our knowledge and tools?
</p>
<p>
When I visited Berlin earlier this year for a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73JkiEClyO4">small conference
on AI and interfaces</a>, I spent my last free night in the city
wandering and pondering whether there could be a general answer to this
expansive question. My focus — both then and now — is on
<a href="https://thesephist.com/posts/interface/"><em>engaged
interfaces</em></a>, interfaces people use to deeply understand or
explore some creative medium or knowledge domain, rather than to
complete a specific well-defined task. (In this post, when I write
<em>interface</em>, I specific mean this type.) The question of what
makes an interface compelling is particularly interesting for this type
because, as I noted in the
<a href="https://thesephist.com/posts/interface/">other post in this
series</a>, inventing good primitives for engaged interfaces demands
broad, open-ended exploration. I was hopeful that foundational
principles could guide our exploration process and make our search more
efficient.
</p>
<p>
I returned home from that trip with a hazy sense of those principles,
which have since become more crisp through many conversations, research,
and experiments.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<em>What makes a good human interface?</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
A good engaged interface lets us do two things. It lets us
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
<strong>see</strong> information <em>clearly</em> from the right
<em>perspectives</em>, and
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>express</strong> our intent as <em>naturally</em> and
<em>precisely</em> as we desire.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
<em>To see and to express</em>. This is what all great engaged
interfaces — creative and exploratory tools — are about.
</p>
<h2 id="to-see">
To see
</h2>
<p>
A good engaged interface <strong>makes visible what is latent</strong>.
In that way, they are like great maps. Good interfaces and maps enable
us to more effectively explore some domain of information by visualizing
and letting us <em>see</em> the right slices of a more complex,
underlying reality.
</p>
<p>
Data visualizations and
<a href="https://thesephist.com/posts/notation/">notations</a>, the
backbone of many kinds of graphical interfaces, are maps for seeing
better. Primitives like charts, canvases, (reverse-)chronological
timelines, calendars, are all based on taking some meaningful dimension
of information, like time or importance, and mapping it onto some space.
</p>
<p>
If we take some liberties with the definition of a data visualization,
we can consider interface patterns like the “timeline” in an audio or
video editing app. In fact, the more capable a video editing tool, the
greater variety of maps that tool offers users, enabling them to
<em>see</em> different dimensions of the underlying project. An
experienced video editor doesn’t just work with video clips on a
timeline, but also has a “scope” for visualizing the distribution of
color in a frame, color histograms and curves for higher-level tuning,
audio waveforms, and even complex filtered and categorized views for
navigating their vast library of source footage. These are all maps for
seeing information clearly from diverse perspectives.
</p>
<p>
Straying even further, a table of contents is also a kind of data
visualization, a map of a longer document that helps the reader
<em>see</em> its structure at a glance. A zoomed-out thumbnail grid of a
long paged document is yet another map in disguise, where the reader can
<em>see</em> a different more scannable perspective on the underlying
information.
</p>
<p>
Even when there isn’t an explicit construction of space in the
interface, there is often a hidden metaphor gesturing at one. When we
open a folder in a file browser, for example, we imagine hierarchies of
folders above and below to which we can navigate. In a web browser, we
imagine pages of history coming before and after the current page. When
editing a document, the undo/redo “stack” gestures at a hidden
chronological list of edits. Sometimes, these hidden metaphors are worth
reifying into concrete visuals, like a list of changes in a file history
view or a file tree in the sidebar of a code editor. But over time these
inherently cartographic metaphors get collapsed into our imagination as
we become more adept at seeing them in our minds.
</p>
<h2 id="to-express">
To express
</h2>
<p>
Once we’ve seen what is in front of us, we need to act on that
understanding. Often that comes in the form of manipulating the thing
being visualized — the thing we <em>see</em> in the interface. A good
engaged interface also helps us here by <strong>transparently
translating natural human interactions into precise intents</strong> in
the domain of the tool.
</p>
<p>
Simple applications accomplish this by letting the user directly
manipulate the element of interest. Consider the way map applications
allow the user to explore places by dragging and zooming with natural
gestures, or how the modern
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WIMP_(computing)">WIMP</a>
desktop interface lets users directly arrange windows that logically
correspond to applications. When possible, directly manipulating the
underlying information or objects of concern, the <em>domain
objects</em>, minimizes cognitive load and learning curve.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes, tools can give users much more capability by inventing a new
abstraction. Such an abstraction represents latent aspects of a domain
object that couldn’t be individually manipulated before. In one type of
implementation, a new abstraction shows <em>individual attributes</em>
of some underlying object that can now be manipulated independently. We
often see this in creative applications like Photoshop, Figma, or
drag-and-drop website builders, where a sidebar or attribute panel shows
independent attributes of a selected object. By interacting directly a
color picker, font selector, or layout menus in the panel — the
<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1978942.1979033"><strong>surrogate
objects</strong></a> — the user indirectly manipulates the actual object
of concern. To make this kind of interaction more powerful many of these
tools also have a sophisticated notion of selection. “Layers” in image
editing apps are a new abstraction that makes both selection and
indirect attribute manipulation more useful.
</p>
<p>
A second type of surrogate object is focused not on showing individual
attributes, but on revealing <em>intermediate states</em> that otherwise
wouldn’t have been amenable to direct manipulation, because they weren’t
concrete. Spreadsheet applications are full of UI abstractions that make
intermediate states of calculation concrete. A typical spreadsheet will
contain many cells that store some intermediate result, not to mention
the concept of a formula itself, which is all about making the
computation itself directly editable. Version control systems take the
previously inaccessible object of past versions of a document or the
concept of a single change — a “diff” — and allow the user to directly
manipulate them to undo or reorder edits.
</p>
<h2 id="direct-manipulation">
Direct manipulation
</h2>
<p>
All of the interfaces I mention above are examples of <strong>direct
manipulation</strong>, a term
<a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~ben/papers/Shneiderman1983Direct.pdf">dating
back at least to 1983</a> for interfaces that:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Make key objects for some task visible to the user, and
</li>
<li>
Allow rapid, reversible, incremental action on the objects.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
This kind of an interface lets us re-use our intuition for physical
objects, movement, and space to see and express ideas in more abstract
domains. An underrated benefit of direct manipulation is that it enables
low-friction iteration and exploration of an idea space. Indeed, I think
it’s fair to say that direct manipulation is itself merely a means to
achieve this more fundamental goal: let the user easily iterate and
explore possibilities, which leads to better decisions.
</p>
<p>
In the forty years since, direct manipulation has eaten away at nearly
every corner of the landscape of knowledge tools. But despite its
ubiquity, the most interesting and important part of creative knowledge
work — the <em>understanding, coming up with ideas, and exploring
options</em> part — still mostly takes place in our minds, with paper
and screens serving as scratchpads and memory more than true thinking
aids. There are very few direct manipulation interfaces to ideas and
thoughts themselves, except in specific constrained domains like
programming, finance, and statistics where mathematical statements can
be neatly reified into UI elements.
</p>
<p>
Of course, we have information tools that use direct manipulation
principles, like graphical word processors and mind mapping software.
But even when using these tools, a user has to read and interpret
information on screen, transform and manipulate them in the mind, and
then relay their conclusions back into the computer. The intermediate
states of thinking are completely latent. In the best thinking tools
today, we still can’t play with thoughts, only words.
</p>
<p>
We are in the pre-direct manipulation, program-by-command-line age of
thinking tools, where we cannot touch and shape our thoughts like clay,
where our tools let us see and manipulate words on a page, but not the
concepts and ideas behind them.
</p>
<p>
This realization underlies all of my
<a href="https://thesephist.com/posts/prism/">technical research</a> and
<a href="https://thesephist.com/posts/synth/">interface
explorations</a>, though I’m certainly
<a href="https://worrydream.com/MediaForThinkingTheUnthinkable/">not
early nor unique</a> in pursuing this vision. To me, solving this
problem means freeing our most nuanced and ineffable ideas from our
individual heads. It would give us a way to translate those thoughts
into something we can hold in our hands and manipulate in the same way
we break down an algebra problem with pencil and paper or graphs on a
grid.
</p>
<p>
What could we accomplish if, instead of learning to hold the ever more
complex problems in our world within our minds, we could break down and
collaborate on them with tools that let us see them in front of us in
full fidelity and bring our full senses and dexterity to bear on
understanding and exploring the possibilities?

id="maui-fire-lawsuit-parties-reach-4b-global-settlement-court-filings-say">Maui
fire lawsuit parties reach $4B global settlement, court filings say</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>HONOLULU — The parties in lawsuits seeking damages for last year’s
Maui wildfires have reached a $4 billion global settlement, a court
filing said Friday, nearly one year after the deadliest U.S. wildfire in
more than a century.</p>
<p>The term sheet with details of the settlement is not publicly
available, but the liaison attorneys filed a motion Friday saying the
global settlement seeks to resolve all Maui fire claims for $4.037
billion. The motion asks the judge to order that insurers can’t
separately go after the defendants to recoup money paid to
policyholders.</p>
<p>“We’re under no illusions that this is going to make Maui whole,”
Jake Lowenthal, a Maui attorney selected as one of four liaisons for the
coordination of the cases, told The Associated Press. “We know for a
fact that it’s not going to make up for what they lost.”</p>
<p>Thomas Leonard, who lost his Front Street condo in the fire and spent
hours in the ocean behind a seawall hiding from the flames, welcomed the
news.</p>
<p>“It gives us something to work with,” he said. “I’m going to need
that money to rebuild.”</p>
<p>Hawaii Gov. Josh Green said in a statement that seven defendants will
pay the $4.037 billion to compensate those who have already brought
claims for the August 8, 2023, fires that killed 102 people and
destroyed the historic downtown area of Lahaina on Maui.</p>
<p>Green said the proposed settlement is an agreement in principle and
would “help our people heal.”</p>
<p>“My priority as governor was to expedite the agreement and to avoid
protracted and painful lawsuits so as many resources as possible would
go to those affected by the wildfires as quickly as possible,” he said
in a statement.</p>
<p>He said it was unprecedented to settle lawsuits like this in only one
year.</p>
<p>“It will be good that our people don’t have to wait to rebuild their
lives as long as others have in many places that have suffered similar
tragedies,” Green said.</p>
<p>Hawaiian Electric CEO Sheelee Kimura said the settlement will allow
the parties to move forward without the added challenges and
divisiveness of litigation.</p>
<p>“For the many affected parties to work with such commitment and focus
to reach resolution in a uniquely complex case is a powerful
demonstration of how Hawaiʻi comes together in times of crisis,” Kimura
said in a statement.</p>
<p>Hawaiian Electric said the settlement will help reestablish the
company’s financial stability. It said payments would begin after final
approval and were expected no earlier than the middle of next year.</p>
<p>Gilbert Keith-Agaran, a Maui attorney who represents victims,
including families who lost relatives, said the amount was “woefully
short.” But he said it was a deal plaintiffs needed to consider given
Hawaiian Electric’s limited assets and potential bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Lowenthal noted there were “extenuating circumstances” that made
lawyers worry the litigation would drag on for years.</p>
<p>Now that a settlement has been reached, more work needs to be done on
next steps, like how to divvy up the amount.</p>
<p>“This is the first step to allowing the Maui fire victims to get
compensation sooner than later,” Lowenthal said.</p>
<p>More than 600 lawsuits have been filed over the deaths and
destruction caused by the fires, which burned thousands of homes and
displaced 12,000 people. In the spring, a judge appointed mediators and
ordered all parties to participate in settlement talks.</p>
<p>Four other defendants did not immediately respond to email messages
or phone calls seeking comment. They are Maui County, Hawaiian Telcom,
Kamehameha Schools — formerly known as Bishop Estate — and West Maui
Land Co.</p>
<p>Spectrum/Charter Communications declined to comment.</p>

colleges reembracing SAT as admissions requirement</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic made it impossible to administer the SAT exam
to high school students worldwide. In response, US colleges and
universities that required the exam for admissions made the test
optional. Now, with the pandemic in the rearview mirror, a trend is
growing in higher education to again require the SAT. VOA’s Robin Guess
has the story.</p>

<h2
id="pentagon-chief-revokes-plea-deals-with-3-sept.-11-suspects">Pentagon
chief revokes plea deals with 3 Sept. 11 suspects</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Friday scrapped a
plea agreement with September 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, just
two days after the announcement of a deal that reportedly would have
taken the death penalty off the table.</p>
<p>Deals with Mohammed and two alleged accomplices announced Wednesday
had appeared to have moved their long-running cases toward resolution –
but sparked anger among some relatives of those killed on September 11,
2001, as well as criticism from leading Republican politicians.</p>
<p>“I have determined that, in light of the significance of the decision
to enter into pre-trial agreements with the accused … responsibility for
such a decision should rest with me,” Austin said in a memorandum
addressed to Susan Escallier, who oversaw the case.</p>
<p>“I hereby withdraw from the three pre-trial agreements that you
signed on July 31, 2024 in the above-referenced case,” the memo
said.</p>
<p>The cases against the 9/11 defendants have been bogged down in
pre-trial maneuverings for years, while the accused remained held at the
Guantanamo Bay military base in Cuba.</p>
<p>The New York Times reported this week that Mohammed, Walid bin Attash
and Mustafa al-Hawsawi had agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy in
exchange for a life sentence, instead of facing a trial that could lead
to their executions.</p>
<p>Much of the legal jousting surrounding the men’s cases has focused on
whether they could be tried fairly after having undergone methodical
torture at the hands of the CIA in the years after 9/11.</p>
<p>The plea agreements would have avoided that thorny issue, but they
also sparked sharp criticism from political opponents of President Joe
Biden’s administration.</p>
<p>‘Sweetheart deal’</p>
<p>Republican lawmaker Mike Rogers, the chairman of the House Armed
Services Committee, sent a letter to Austin that said the deals were
“unconscionable,” while House Speaker Mike Johnson said they were a
“slap in the face” to the families of the nearly 3,000 people killed in
the September 11 attacks.</p>
<p>And Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s running mate, JD
Vance, described the agreements as a “sweetheart deal with 9/11
terrorists,” saying during a campaign rally: “We need a president who
kills terrorists, not negotiates with them.”</p>
<p>Mohammed was regarded as one of Al-Qaida chief Osama bin Laden’s most
trusted and intelligent lieutenants before his March 2003 capture in
Pakistan. He then spent three years in secret CIA prisons before
arriving at Guantanamo in 2006.</p>
<p>The trained engineer – who has said he masterminded the 9/11 attacks
“from A to Z” – was involved in a string of major plots against the
United States, where he had attended university.</p>
<p>Bin Attash, a Saudi of Yemeni origin, allegedly trained two of the
hijackers who carried out the September 11 attacks, and his U.S.
interrogators also said he confessed to buying the explosives and
recruiting members of the team that killed 17 sailors in an attack on
the USS Cole.</p>
<p>After the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, he took refuge in
neighboring Pakistan and was captured there in 2003. He was then held in
a network of secret CIA prisons.</p>
<p>Hawsawi is suspected of managing the financing for the 9/11 attacks.
He was arrested in Pakistan on March 1, 2003, and was also held in
secret prisons before being transferred to Guantanamo in 2006.</p>
<p>The United States used Guantanamo, an isolated naval base, to hold
militants captured during the “War on Terror” that followed the
September 11 attacks in a bid to keep the defendants from claiming
rights under U.S. law.</p>
<p>The facility held roughly 800 prisoners at its peak, but they have
since slowly been repatriated to other countries. Biden pledged before
his election to try to shut down Guantanamo, but it remains open.</p>

<h2 id="us-military-sending-reinforcement-to-the-middle-east">US
military sending reinforcement to the Middle East</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — U.S. warships and fighter jets are headed to the Middle
East and nearby areas to bolster American defenses in support of Israel,
as both countries brace for a possible military strike by Iran.</p>
<p>U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin late Friday signed orders to move
the additional assets and capabilities to the Middle East and parts of
Europe, following pledges by Tehran and its proxies to take revenge for
the killings this past week of a top Hezbollah commander in Lebanon and
the Hamas terror group’s political leader on Iranian soil.</p>
<p>The U.S. moves include sending the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft
carrier strike group to the Middle East, along with naval cruisers and
destroyers capable of shooting down ballistic missiles.</p>
<p>In addition, the U.S. is sending an additional fighter squadron to
the region and is taking steps to allow for the deployment of land-based
missile defense capabilities.</p>
<p>The Pentagon did not say when the various ships and planes will be in
place, but in a statement Friday it described the moves as necessary to
“mitigate the possibility of regional escalation by Iran or Iran’s
partners and proxies.”</p>
<p>The statement also said the movement of more military capabilities to
the region aims “to improve U.S. force protection, to increase support
for the defense of Israel, and to ensure the United States is prepared
to respond to various contingencies.”</p>
<p>The new orders came just hours after Austin pledged additional
support to Israel during a call with Israeli Defense Minister Yoav
Gallant.</p>
<p>“The secretary reiterated ironclad support for Israel’s security and
informed the minister of additional measures to include ongoing and
future defensive force posture changes that the department will take to
support the defense of Israel,” Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said
during a briefing.</p>
<p>The Pentagon’s support for Israel since the October 7 Hamas terror
attack “should leave Iran, Lebanese Hezbollah and other Iranian-backed
terrorist groups with no doubt about U.S. resolve,” she said.</p>
<p>Tensions in the region have escalated significantly in the past week,
following an Israeli strike in Lebanon that killed Fouad Shukur,
Hezbollah’s top military commander, and the subsequent assassination of
Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh, who was in Tehran to celebrate
the inauguration of Iran’s new president.</p>
<p>Israel has not publicly claimed responsibility for Haniyeh’s death,
but Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, put the onus on
Israel and called for retribution.</p>
<p>“The criminal, terrorist Zionist regime martyred our dear guest in
our territory and has caused our grief, but it has also prepared the
ground for a severe punishment,” Khamenei posted on the X social media
platform.</p>
<p>“It is our duty to take revenge,” he added in a separate post.</p>
<p>Iranian officials said Thursday they planned to meet with
representatives from Iran’s key proxies — including Hamas, Hezbollah,
Yemen’s Houthis and militias in Iraq and Syria — to plan their next
steps.</p>
<p>“How Iran and the resistance front will respond is currently being
reviewed,” said Major General Mohammad Bagheri, Iran’s armed forces
chief, speaking on Iranian state TV.</p>
<p>“This will certainly happen, and the Zionist regime [Israel] will
undoubtedly regret it,” he added.</p>
<p>But U.S. officials, seeking to prevent the tensions from exploding
into a regional war, have repeatedly signaled that Washington would not
leave Israel undefended.</p>
<p>During a call Thursday between U.S. President Joe Biden and Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Biden “discussed efforts to support
Israel’s defense against threats, including against ballistic missiles
and drones, to include new defensive U.S. military deployments,”
according to the U.S. readout.</p>
<p>U.S. defense officials Friday likewise emphasized Israel would not
stand alone in the face of Iranian aggression.</p>
<p>“We will stand with Israel in their self-defense,” said Singh.</p>
<p>“These are defensive capabilities,” Singh added. “All of our
capabilities that we have there in the region are defensive and to send
a message of deterrence.”</p>
<p>Besides the additional ships and warplanes headed to the Middle East,
the Pentagon has a U.S. Marine Corps amphibious ready group with some
4,000 troops in the region.</p>
<p>The USS Theodore Roosevelt carrier strike group is also in the Middle
East but is expected to leave once the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft
carrier strike group arrives.</p>
<p>This would not be the first time the U.S. has enhanced its defensive
capabilities to help shield Israel from an Iranian attack.</p>
<p>This past April, the U.S. moved naval destroyers and other military
assets into the region while coordinating with Britain, Jordan, Saudi
Arabia and other allies in the Middle East to thwart a massive drone and
missile barrage by Iran.</p>
<p>At the time, one U.S. official called the effort an “incredible
military achievement.”</p>
<p>Whether the U.S. will be able to rely on a similar coalition to deter
a second Iranian attack on Israel, however, is unclear.</p>
<p>Whether Iran and its proxies would attempt another aerial attack on
Israel, after an estimated 99% of the missiles and drones that they
launched in April failed to hit a target, is also unclear.</p>
<p>“Iran is currently in the process of making a difficult decision on
how to respond to the targeting killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh
in Tehran,” said Robert Murrett, a retired U.S. vice admiral and deputy
director of the Institute for Security Policy and Law at Syracuse
University.</p>
<p>“Iran will likely carefully calibrate its response to the Israelis,”
Murrett told VOA via email. “They [the Iranians] are fully aware of the
regional implications of any direct or indirect attack on Israel with or
without surrogates.”</p>
<p>In the meantime, the Pentagon insisted Friday that a further
escalation between Iran and Israel “is not inevitable.”</p>
<p>“We do believe there is an off-ramp here, and that is that [Gaza]
cease-fire deal,” between Israel and Hamas, Singh said.</p>
<p>Some information from Reuters was used in this report.</p>
