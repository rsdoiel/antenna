## Microsoft is bringing annoying Windows 11 Start menu ads to Windows 10

date: 2024-08-26, from: OS News

Earlier this year, Microsoft introduced a so-called &#8220;Account Manager&#8221; for Windows 11 that appears on the screen when you click your profile picture on the Start menu. Instead of just showing you buttons for logging out, locking your device or switching profiles, it displays Microsoft 365 ads. All the actually useful buttons are now hidden behind a three-dot submenu (apparently, my 43-inch display does not have enough space to accommodate them). Now, the &#8220;Account Manager&#8221; is coming to Windows 10 users. ↫ Taras Buria at Neowin Yes, this is a really small ad int he grand scheme of things, but the mere concept of my operating system showing me all kinds of ads and upsells, as both Windows and macOS have been doing aggressively for years now, is so deeply offensive to me. It shows such utter disrespect to me as a user, and shows that Microsoft and Apple see me not as an end user, but as a ripe plum ready to be bled dry at every turn. It&#8217;s revolting. As the latest release, Windows 11 has always been the most ad-ridden of the Windows releases still in use, but it seems Windows users can&#8217;t escape the onslaught either. I&#8217;m especially expecting ever more aggressive ads and upsells for Windows 11 to appear in Windows 10 now that the 2025 cutoff date for Windows 10 support is nearing, of course appearing at the most inopportune times &#8211; because everybody loves a giant fullscreen ad on your operating system when you&#8217;re trying to give a presentation or meet that tight deadline you forced yourself yo stress about by playing a bit too much League of Legends. If you want an ad- and upsell-free operating system, your options are legion &#8211; there&#8217;s countless Linux distributions and the various BSDs to choose from.

## Disposable vape products creating worldwide pollution

date: 2024-08-26, from: VOA News USA

The rapid rise in disposable electronic cigarette, or vape, usage is creating a tidal wave of pollution, and it’s raising serious environmental concerns. Aron Ranen reports from New York City about one woman who is trying to make a difference.

## No unmodified files remain from original import of OpenBSD

date: 2024-08-26, from: OS News

The greek quiz is so obscure that it is ridiculous &#8212; noone can play this. Replace it with a new quiz about galley (ship) parts. This commit changes the LAST UNMODIFIED ORIGINAL FILE (meaning revision 1.1.1.1) from the original import that created OpenBSD on Oct 18, 1995. With this commit, we have completed an amusing mission of replacing the final parts of the original OpenBSD. We have reached OpenBSD of Theseus. ↫ Theo de Raadt With this change to a quiz game in OpenBSD, every single line of the OpenBSD code base is newer than that first, original import. Now I&#8217;m curious to see which other projects have achieved this milestone, and when.

It got called the crisis in cosmology. But now astronomers can explain some surprising recent discoveries.

## The Rising Popularity of Plug-In Hybrids

date: 2024-08-26, from: Heatmap News

Fire in Rivian factory parking lot damages dozens of vehicles</h3><p>A fire <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/fire-rivians-illinois-plant-damages-multiple-evs-no-injuries-reported-2024-08-25/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--lPJUwrMRFYzUXqVg3Qg5cPsRgbVG8TpjS6JFz3AK30uV51OCYrHQJOsyYs953xypO3EWH" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">broke out</a> in the parking lot at Rivian’s Normal, Illinois, plant on Saturday, damaging dozens of cars before being extinguished. The plant itself was not affected, according to the Normal Fire Department, and no one was injured. The source of the blaze is under investigation. Rivian’s Normal factory produces all of the EV company’s current models. Last week Rivian got the city’s approval to expand the plant by about 1.3 million square feet to manufacture the upcoming mass-market R2 SUV. EVs catch fire less often than gas-powered cars, but they burn hotter and are harder to put out once alight.</p><h3>2. Fauci recovering from West Nile infection</h3><p><strong></strong>Dr. Anthony Fauci, the former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, is recovering from West Nile Virus, a spokeswoman <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/25/us/fauci-west-nile-virus-hospitalized.html?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--lPJUwrMRFYzUXqVg3Qg5cPsRgbVG8TpjS6JFz3AK30uV51OCYrHQJOsyYs953xypO3EWH" target="_blank">said</a>. Fauci was hospitalized with fever, chills, and fatigue but is now at home and is expected to make a full recovery. According to Dr. Jonathan LaPook, the chief medical correspondent for CBS News, Fauci thinks he was infected after being bitten by a mosquito in his backyard. West Nile is the most common mosquito-borne disease in the United States, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/west-nile-virus/about/index.html?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--lPJUwrMRFYzUXqVg3Qg5cPsRgbVG8TpjS6JFz3AK30uV51OCYrHQJOsyYs953xypO3EWH" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to</a> the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. So far this year 216 cases have been confirmed. About one in five infected people develop symptoms. <a href="https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-west-nile-virus?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--lPJUwrMRFYzUXqVg3Qg5cPsRgbVG8TpjS6JFz3AK30uV51OCYrHQJOsyYs953xypO3EWH" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">According to</a> the Environmental Protection Agency, climate change is one of many factors that increase the risk of human exposure to West Nile by accelerating mosquito development, biting rates, and disease incubation.</p><h3>3. Unpacking the rising popularity of plug-in hybrids</h3><p><strong></strong><em>The Wall Street Journal</em> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/the-plug-in-hybrid-car-starts-to-win-over-buyers-2155e054?mod=hp_lead_pos6&utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--lPJUwrMRFYzUXqVg3Qg5cPsRgbVG8TpjS6JFz3AK30uV51OCYrHQJOsyYs953xypO3EWH" target="_blank">explores</a> what’s going on with plug-in hybrid cars, which have been on the market for more than a decade but are experiencing a bit of a revival as of late. The number of models on sale in the U.S. has nearly doubled over the last five years, to 47, and sales were up 60% in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2024. While conventional hybrids come with a small battery and motor that helps power the car’s engine to reduce fuel use, plug-in hybrids have a bigger battery that’s strong enough to run the vehicle exclusively on electricity for a little while before the gas engine takes over. The recent rise in sales is attributed in part to automakers being forced to comply with new tailpipe emissions rules, and drivers being EV curious but not quite ready to abandon gas entirely. “Plug-in hybrids balance the need to reduce vehicle emissions and offer consumers an entry point to electrified vehicles,” a Stellantis spokesperson told the <em><em>Journal</em></em>. GM is bringing back plug-in hybrids in 2027 after axing the Chevrolet Volt. Toyota, Volkswagen, and Ford are all either considering rolling out a plug-in hybrid in the U.S. or expanding existing lineups.</p><h3>4.

Promethean Particles produces metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), which are “composed of metal ions interconnected by organic molecules to form a porous, lattice-like structure.” These nanoparticles have huge surface area, and the size of their pores can be customized to trap different gases and liquids. So the technology is being eyed as an option for capturing carbon at source for storage and transport, but like many CCS technologies, it is very expensive.

## Alaska landslide kills 1,injures 3 in Ketchikan, authorities say

date: 2024-08-26, from: VOA News USA

ANCHORAGE, Alaska  — One person was killed and three were injured by a landslide that prompted a mandatory evacuation in the Alaska city of Ketchikan, authorities said.


Three people were transported to Ketchikan Medical Center following the landslide, which struck around 4 p.m. Sunday and damaged homes and infrastructure, the Ketchikan Gateway Borough and City of Ketchikan said in a joint statement Sunday.


Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy declared an emergency for Ketchikan, while Borough Mayor Rodney Dial and city Mayor Dave Kiffer issued a separate emergency declaration.


"Friends, is with a heavy heart we relay that a landslide in the city has taken a life, caused several injuries, damaged homes and impacted our community," Dial said in the statement.


Kiffer said the loss of life was "heartbreaking, and my heart goes out to those who lost their homes."


"In my 65 years in Ketchikan, I have never seen a slide of this magnitude. With the slides we have seen across the region, there is clearly a region-wide issue that we need to try to understand with the support of our State geologist," Kiffer said.


Two of the victims were admitted to the hospital and one was treated and released. All other individuals have been accounted for, the statement said.


Multiple homes were impacted by the landslide and a mandatory evacuation was ordered for residents of Third Avenue and nearby streets, while a shelter was set up at Ketchikan High School, the borough and city said.


A potential secondary landslide area was identified to the south of the original slide location and crews were standing by, the statement said.

## China opposes US sanctions on firms with alleged ties to Russia's war efforts

date: 2024-08-25, from: VOA News USA

Beijing — China on Sunday expressed its opposition to the latest U.S. sanctions on Chinese companies over their alleged ties to Russia's war in Ukraine, saying it will adopt necessary measures to safeguard the rights and interests of the country's businesses.


The U.S. announced Friday sweeping sanctions on hundreds of firms in Russia and across Europe, Asia and the Middle East, accusing them of providing products and services that enable Russia’s war effort and aiding its ability to evade sanctions. The U.S. Department of State said it was concerned by “the magnitude of dual-use goods exports” from China to Russia.


The Ministry of Commerce in China in its statement firmly opposed the U.S. putting multiple Chinese companies on its export control list. The move bars such companies from trading with U.S. firms without gaining a nearly unobtainable special license.


The ministry said the U.S. action was “typical unilateral sanctions," saying they would disrupt global trade orders and rules, as well as affect the stability of the global industrial and supply chains.


“China urges the U.S. to immediately stop its wrong practices and will take necessary measures to resolutely safeguard the legitimate rights and interest of Chinese companies,” it said.


The U.S. action is the latest in a series of thousands of U.S. sanctions that have been imposed on Russian firms and their suppliers in other nations since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The effectiveness of the sanctions has been questioned, especially as Russia has continued to support its economy by selling oil and gas on international markets.


According to the U.S. State Department, some China-based companies supplied machine tools and components to Russia companies.


China has tried to position itself as neutral in the Ukraine conflict, but it shares with Russia high animosity toward the West.


After Western countries imposed heavy sanctions on Russian oil in response to Russia sending troops into Ukraine in February 2022, China strongly stepped up its purchase of Russian oil, increasing its influence in Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin also underlined the importance of China by meeting in Beijing with Chinese leader Xi Jinping soon after being inaugurated for a fifth term in the Kremlin.

## The Windows Control Panel being “deprecated” isn’t news

date: 2024-08-25, from: OS News

Virtually every tech media outlet has been reporting that Microsoft is deprecating the Control Panel in Windows as if that&#8217;s some sort of big revelation we should be outraged about. They&#8217;re basing this on the following, now changed, paragraph someone found buried deep in a Windows support site somewhere: The Control Panel is a feature that&#8217;s been part of Windows for a long time. It provides a centralized location to view and manipulate system settings and controls. Through a series of applets, you can adjust various options ranging from system time and date to hardware settings, network configurations, and more. The Control Panel is in the process of being deprecated in favor of the Settings app, which offers a more modern and streamlined experience. ↫ Windows support website It seems the sudden avalanche of articles about this spooked Microsoft, because when you open the same website now, that last line instead reads: Many of the settings in Control Panel are in the process of being migrated to the Settings app, which offers a more modern and streamlined experience. ↫ Windows support website The idea that the Control Panel is being &#8220;deprecated&#8221; is not exactly a new one; it&#8217;s been an ongoing process since the release of Windows 8, twelve years ago now. With every new Windows release, more Control Panel applets are removed in favour of expanding the Settings application, to a point where few regular users have a need to open it directly. Settings still does rely on old Control Panel applets, though, and it won&#8217;t take you many clicks through Settings to end up at a classic applet. So, while directly opening the Control Panel might not be a common thing people do, using classic applets sure is. Microsoft may be changing the verbiage of its support page to remove the word &#8220;deprecated&#8221;, but that ain&#8217;t fooling anyone: the Control Panel has already been gutted beyond recognition, and it&#8217;s definitely in the process of being deprecated &#8211; in true Microsoft fashion, it&#8217;s just taking them a really long time, because nobody inside Microsoft seems to really care about Windows anymore.

## Wall Street Week Ahead — 'Super Bowl' Nvidia earnings stand to test searing AI trade

date: 2024-08-25, from: VOA News USA

New York — The rally in U.S. stocks faces an important test [...]  with earnings from chipmaking giant Nvidia NVDA.O, whose blistering run has powered markets throughout 2024.  


The S&P 500 .SPX has pared a sharp drop it suffered after U.S. economic worries contributed to a sell-off at the beginning of the month and again stands near a fresh all-time high.  


Nvidia, whose chips are widely seen as the gold standard in artificial intelligence, has been at the forefront of that rally, jumping by more than 30% since its recent lows. The stock is up some 150% year-to-date, accounting for around a quarter of the S&P 500’s 17% year-to-date gain.  


The company’s Aug. 28 earnings report, coupled with guidance on whether it expects corporate investments in AI to continue, could be a key inflection point for market sentiment heading into what is historically a volatile time of the year. The S&P 500 has fallen in September by an average of 0.78% since World War Two, the worst performance of any month, according to CFRA data.  


"Nvidia is the zeitgeist stock today," said Mike Smith, a portfolio manager at Allspring Global Investments, which holds the company's shares in its portfolios. "You can think of their earnings four times a year as the Super Bowl."  


Some investors are getting ready for fireworks. Traders are pricing in a swing of around 10.3% in Nvidia’s shares the day after the company reports earnings, according to data from options analytic firm ORATS. That's larger than the expected move ahead of any Nvidia report over the last three years and well above the stock's average post-earnings move of 8.1% over that same period, ORATS data showed.   


The results come at the end of an earnings season during which investors have taken a less forgiving view of big tech companies whose earnings failed to justify rich valuations or prodigious spending on AI. Examples include Microsoft MSFT.O, Tesla TSLA.O and Alphabet GOOGL.O, whose shares are all down since their July reports.  


Nvidia’s valuations have also climbed, as the stock soared about 750% since the start of 2023, making it the world’s third-most valuable company as of Thursday, while also drawing comparisons to the dotcom bubble of more than two decades ago. The company’s shares trade at about 37 times forward 12-month earnings estimates, compared with a 20-year average of 29 times, according to LSEG Datastream.  


Market sentiment could depend as much on Nvidia's guidance as its results. Evidence that it sees robust demand will be a bullish sign that companies are continuing to invest rather than pull back in anticipation of an economic slowdown, said Matt Stucky, chief portfolio manager, equities, at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management.  


Nvidia's "connection to the largest companies in the U.S. stock market makes this a must-watch event," he said. "The biggest piece that investors want to know is whether there is sustainability and what demand will look like in '25 and '26," he said.  


The trajectory of monetary policy and the U.S. economy also looms large for investors. In a Friday morning speech in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell offered an explicit endorsement of interest rate cuts, saying further cooling in the job market would be unwelcome.  




Investors will be watching U.S. labor market data on Sept. 6 for evidence of whether last month’s unexpected downshift in employment carried over to August. Signs that employment is continuing to weaken could bring back the recession fears that rocked markets earlier this month.  


A tight presidential race between Vice President Kamala Harris, a Democrat, and Republican former President Donald Trump may also whip up market uncertainty in the weeks ahead.  


The August surge in stocks may make it difficult for markets to make much more headway in the near term even if Nvidia’s earnings impress Wall Street, said John Belton, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, which holds shares of the chipmaker.  


The S&P 500 trades at 21 times expected earnings, far above its long-term average of 15.7.  


"The stock market as a whole is still trading at stretched valuations so the bar remains high," Belton said.

## Microsoft’s Copilot falsely accuses court reporter of crimes he covered

date: 2024-08-25, from: OS News

German journalist Martin Bernklau typed his name and location into Microsoft&#8217;s Copilot to see how his culture blog articles would be picked up by the chatbot, according to German public broadcaster SWR. The answers shocked Bernklau. Copilot falsely claimed Bernklau had been charged with and convicted of child abuse and exploiting dependents. It also claimed that he had been involved in a dramatic escape from a psychiatric hospital and had exploited grieving women as an unethical mortician. Copilot even went so far as to claim that it was &#8220;unfortunate&#8221; that someone with such a criminal past had a family and,&#160;according to SWR, provided Bernklau&#8217;s full address with phone number and route planner. ↫ Matthias Bastian So why did Copilot (which is just OpenAI&#8217;s ChatGPT with sparkles) claim Bernklau did all sorts of horrible things? Well, his occupation &#8211; journalist &#8211; is a dead giveaway. He has written a lot of articles covering court proceedings in Tübingen on abuse, violence, and fraud cases, and since Copilot is just spicy autocorrect, it has no understanding of context and pinned the various crimes he covered on Bernklau. Adding in his address, phone number, and a damn planned route to his home is just the very disgusting icing on this already disgusting cake. What makes matters even worse, if you can believe it, is that Bernklau has absolutely no recourse. He contacted the public prosecutor&#8217;s office in Tübingen, but they stated they can&#8217;t press charges because the accusations coming from Copilot aren&#8217;t being made by a real person. And to make it still even worse, Microsoft just threw its hands in the air and absolved itself of any and all responsibility by pointing to its terms of service, in which Microsoft discards liability for content generated by Copilot. Convenient. This is nothing short of a nightmare scenario that can utterly destroy someone&#8217;s life, and the fact that Microsoft doesn&#8217;t care and the law isn&#8217;t even remotely prepared to take serious matters like these on is terrifying.

## Hurricane Hone sweeps past Hawaii, dumping enough rain to ease wildfire fears

date: 2024-08-25, from: VOA News USA

HONOLULU — Hurricane Hone passed just south of Hawaii on Sunday, dumping so much rain that the National Weather Service called off its red flag warnings that strong winds could lead to wildfires on the drier sides of the islands.


Meanwhile, the eastern Pacific saw a new threat emerge as Tropical Storm Hector formed, packing top sustained winds of 75 kph (45 mph). There were no coastal watches or warnings in effect as Hector churned far out at sea, the National Hurricane Center said.


Hone had top winds of 140 kph (85 mph) Sunday morning as it swirled slowly past the Big Island, centered about 72 kilometers (45 miles) off its southernmost point, according to Jon Jelsema, a senior forecaster at the Central Pacific Hurricane Center. He said tropical storm force winds were blowing across the island's southeast-facing slopes, carrying up to 30 centimeters or more of rain.


Floods closed Highway 11 between Kona and Hilo, and a higher-altitude alternative, the Cane Road, was closed by flooding as well, isolating properties like the Aikane Plantation Coffee Co. outside Pahala, where owner Phil Becker said his 25-centimeter rain gauge overflowed in the deluge.


"We've got quite a lot of flood damage, the gulches are running full speed ahead and they're overflowing the bridges, so we're trapped down here, we can't get in or out," Becker said Sunday.


Becker said his plantation is off the grid, powered with batteries charged by solar electricity, and his family is safe, so they have no reason to evacuate. The weather may even prove beneficial: "We've been in a drought situation so the coffee is probably loving all this rain," he said.


Hurricane Gilma, meanwhile, weakened to a still-major Category 3 hurricane Saturday night, but it was far east of Hawaii and forecast to weaken into a depression before it reaches the islands.


Shelters were opened as Hurricane Hone blew in and beach parks on the eastern side of the Big Island were closed due to dangerously high surf, Hawaii County Mayor Mitch Roth said.


Jelsema offered a vivid metaphor for the rainfall: "As the rain gets pushed up the mountain terrain it wrings it out, kind of like wringing out a wet towel," he said.


"It's been really soaking those areas, there's been flooding of roads. Roads have been cut off by high flood waters there in the windward sections of the big island, and really that's the only portion of the state that's had much flooding concern at this point," he said.


Hone, whose name is Hawaiian for "sweet and soft," poked at memories still fresh of last year's deadly blazes on Maui, which were fueled by hurricane-force winds. Red flag alerts are issued when warm temperatures, very low humidity and stronger winds combine to raise fire dangers. Most of the archipelago is already abnormally dry or in drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.


The Aug. 8, 2023, blaze that torched the historic town of Lahaina was the deadliest U.S. wildfire in more than a century, with 102 dead. Dry, overgrown grasses and drought helped spread the fire.


Calvin Endo, a Waianae Coast neighborhood board member who lives in Makaha, a leeward Oahu neighborhood prone to wildfires, has worried for years about dry brush on private property behind his home. He's taken matters into his own hands by clearing the brush himself, but he's concerned about nearby homes abutting overgrown vegetation.


"All you need is fire and wind and we'll have another Lahaina," Endo said as the storm approached. "I notice the wind started to kick up already."


The cause of the Lahaina blaze is still under investigation, but it's possible it was ignited by bare electrical wire and leaning power poles toppled by the strong winds. The state's two power companies, Hawaiian Electric and the Kauai Island Utility Cooperative, were prepared to shut off power if necessary to reduce the chance that live, damaged power lines could start fires, but they later said the safety measures would not be necessary as Hone blew past the islands.


Roth said a small blaze that started Friday night in Waikoloa, on the dry side of the Big Island, was brought under control without injuries or damage.

## US rapper Macklemore cancels Dubai gig over alleged UAE role in Sudan war

date: 2024-08-25, from: VOA News USA

Dubai, United Arab Emirates — U.S. rapper Macklemore has announced he is cancelling an upcoming show in Dubai over the UAE's involvement in the conflict in Sudan, charges the Gulf state has denied.


The rapper best known for hits like 2012's "Thrift Shop" made the announcement in a post on social media on Saturday.


"I have decided to cancel my upcoming show in Dubai this October," he said.


"Over the last several months I've had a number of people reach out to me, sharing resources and asking me to cancel the show in solidarity with the people of Sudan," he said.


"Until the UAE stops arming and funding the RSF I will not perform there," Macklemore added, referring to the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces that have been battling the Sundanese army.


War has raged since April 2023 between the Sudanese army, under the country's de facto ruler Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the RSF, which is commanded by Burhan's former deputy Mohamed Hamdan Daglo.


For months, the army has accused the UAE of supporting the RSF.


In June, Sudan's ambassador to the United Nations Al-Harith Idriss al-Harith Mohamed called Abu Dhabi's financial and military support for the RSF the "main reason behind this protracted war."


The UAE has denied allegations of RSF support as "disinformation," saying that it's efforts are focused exclusively towards de-escalation and alleviating Sudan's humanitarian suffering.


Macklemore has released socially aware music in the past, supporting LGBTQ+ rights while also criticizing ills including poverty and consumerism.


In his latest track released in May, Macklemore voices support for Palestinians and also praises students across the United States protesting against Israel's war in Gaza.


The song, "Hind's Hall," is named after a building at Columbia University that students recently occupied and renamed after Hind Rajab, a six-year-old Palestinian girl killed in Gaza.

## Weeks after floods, Vermont businesses struggling to get visitors to return

date: 2024-08-25, from: VOA News USA

burke, vermont — Two bouts of flooding from storms in July has hampered businesses and destinations in an economically depressed section of northern Vermont, with some still closed as they continue to repair damage and others urging visitors, who were deterred by the weather, to make the trip. 


Kingdom Trails, a popular destination for mountain bikers, draws tens of thousands of visitors a year. But the storms that hit the region on July 10 and July 30 washed away some roads and bridges, damaged homes and trails, and discouraged visitors at the height of the season. 


Businesses and destinations are picking up the pieces, with some still closed in nearby Lyndonville, while others want to get the word out that they are very much open. 


"I can't stress enough that we are open and our community is welcoming people," said Abby Long, executive director of Kingdom Trails. "We're encouraging folks to not only come visit Kingdom Trails and have an awesome time but sign up to volunteer mucking and gutting houses for the morning and then relax on the trails in the afternoon." 




The storms caused $300,000 in damages to the trails — and that doesn't account for the loss of membership revenue, she said. The trails were closed for about a day and a half as crews worked furiously to get them back open. The cost of repairs comes on top of the $150,000 in damages suffered in last summer's flooding. 


"That is not sustainable," Long said. 


So far, 341 businesses in Vermont have reported flood damage to the state this year, according to Economic Development Commissioner Joan Goldstein. Last summer, about 1,100 businesses were affected, she said. 


In Lyndonville, a popular diner that had been in business since 1978 will not be reopening after getting damaged in the July 10 storms. The owner of the Miss Lyndonville Diner is having repairs done and plans to sell the restaurant. She told the Caledonian Record that the flooding convinced her it was time to retire. 


Leaving ski industry


The nearby Village Sport Shop, which also has been in business for nearly 50 years, has decided to close its flooded Lyndonville shop and exit the ski industry, according to a social media post by the business. 


"With the multiple flooding events we have endured and the evolution we have needed to take as a business, we have come to the decision it is time to turn our focus towards the summer side of the business and relieve ourselves from the flood risks the lowest lying real estate on the strip endures," the post said. The business has a trailside bicycle shop in East Burke. 


A bagel shop and a Walgreens drugstore were still temporarily closed as they recover from the flood damage. 




On Tuesday, President Joe Biden approved a major disaster declaration making federal funding available to help individuals and communities recover from the July 9-10 flooding from the remnants of Hurricane Beryl. Governor Phil Scott has requested a separate disaster declaration for the July 30 storms and flooding. 


In May, Vermont became the first state to enact a law requiring fossil fuel companies to pay a share of the damage caused by extreme weather fanned by climate change. But officials have acknowledged that collecting any money will depend on litigation against a much-better-resourced oil industry. 


In Burke, a town of about 1,650 that is home to the Burke Mountain ski area, Kingdom Trails is a huge economic driver, said Town Administrator Jim Sullivan. 


"It's traumatic, it's unbelievable the extent that it ripples out," he said. "If Kingdom Trails can't open, people cancel their reservations at the Airbnbs and at the inns. We have restaurants that are counting on all of those people coming here. And it's just a chain event that eventually dwindles where you have these absolutely beautiful days and you just don't have the people here that we normally would have if we didn't have this devastation." 


'Screeching halt'


The East Burke Market was having a really good summer but when the trails closed down, business "came to a bit of a screeching halt," said co-owner Burton Hinton. 


Each of the storms caused hundreds of thousands of dollars in road and property damage, Sullivan said. The town lost a bridge in the July 10 flooding and the whole mountain road in the storm weeks later, he said. 


"We're still waiting for some direction from the federal government. In the meantime, everybody has really come together and done a great job of helping each other. True community," he said. 


About 60 student-athletes who race in cross-country mountain biking with the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Cycling League, and 40 coaches, were in Burke to train at Kingdom Trails when the latest flooding hit on July 30. 


The group had to pivot to ride on gravel for a few days but then some trails reopened quickly, said Michael Morrell, with the National Interscholastic Cycling Association, who was with them. 


"The trail system up here and the trail crew are just so efficient, and the trails, many of the trails, they drain very well," he said on August 1. 


Still, he said he felt terrible for those reliant on getting tourists to visit the local trails. 


"I feel so bad that their roads are closed," Morrell said. " ... We're just glad that we can help support them in any way we can."

## US crossword fan creates puzzles celebrating Black heritage

date: 2024-08-25, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — It started a couple of years ago when Juliana Pache was doing a crossword puzzle and got stuck.


She was unfamiliar with the reference that the clue made. It made her think about what a crossword puzzle would look like if the clues and answers included more of some subjects that she was familiar with, thanks to her own identity and interests — Black history and Black popular culture.


When she couldn't find such a thing, Pache decided to do it herself. In January 2023, she created blackcrossword.com, a site that offers a free mini-crossword puzzle every day. And Tuesday marked the release of her first book, Black Crossword: 100 Mini Puzzles Celebrating the African Diaspora.


It's a good moment for it, nearly 111 years after the first crossword appeared in a New York newspaper. Recent years have seen an increasing amount of conversation around representation in crossword puzzles, from who's constructing them to what words can be used for answers and how the clues are framed. There's been a push to expand the idea of the kinds of "common knowledge" players would have to fill them out.


"I had never made a crossword puzzle before," Pache, 32, said with a laugh. "But I was like, ‘I can figure it out.’"


And she did.


Made 'with Black people in mind'


Each puzzle on Pache's site includes at least a few clues and answers connecting to Black culture. The tagline on the site: "If you know, you know."


The book is brimming with the kinds of puzzles that she estimates about 2,200 people play daily on her site — squares made up of five lines, each with five spaces. She aims for at least three of the clues to be references to aspects of Black cultures from around the world.


Pache, a native of the New York City borough of Queens with family ties to Cuba and the Dominican Republic, had a couple of goals in mind when she started. Primarily, she wanted to create something that Black people would enjoy.


"I'm making it with Black people in mind," she said. "And then if anyone else enjoys it, they learn things from it, that's a bonus but it's not my focus."


She's also trying to show the diversity in Black communities and cultures with the clues and words she uses, and to encourage people from different parts of the African diaspora to learn about each other.


"I also want to make it challenging, not just for people who might be interested in Black culture, but people within Black culture who might be interested in other regions," she said. "Part of my mission with this is to highlight Black people from all over, Black culture from all over. And I think ... that keeps us learning about each other."


What, really, is 'general knowledge'?


While on the surface if might just seem like a game, the knowledge base required for crosswords does say something about what kind of knowledge is considered "general" and "universal" and what isn't, said Michelle Pera-McGhee, a data journalist at The Pudding, a site that focuses on data-driven stories.


In 2020, Pera-McGhee undertook a data project analyzing crossword puzzles through the decades from a handful of the most well-known media outlets. The project assessed clues and answers that used the names of real people to determine a breakdown along gender and race categories.


Unsurprisingly, the data indicated that for the most part, men were disproportionately more likely than women to be featured, as well as white people compared to racial and ethnic minorities.


It's "interesting because it's supposed to be easy," Pera-McGhee said. "You want ... ideally to reference things that people, everybody knows about because everyone learns about them in school or whatever. ... What are the things that we decide we all should know?"


There are efforts to make crosswords more accessible and representative, including the recently started fellowship for puzzle constructors from underrepresented groups at The New York Times, among the most high-profile crossword puzzles around. Puzzle creators have made puzzles aimed at LGBTQ+ communities, at women, using a wider array of references as Pache is doing.


Bottom line, "it is really cool to see our culture reflected in this medium," Pache said.


And, Pera-McGhee said, it can be cool to learn new things.


"It's kind of enriching to have things in the puzzle that you don't know about," she said. "It's not that the experience of not knowing is bad. It's just that it should maybe be spread out along with the experience of knowing. Both are kind of good in the crossword-solving experience."
