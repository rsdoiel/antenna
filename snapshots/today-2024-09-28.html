dead, millions without power after Helene’s march across southeastern
US</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PERRY, Florida — Hurricane Helene caused dozens of deaths and
billions of dollars of destruction across a wide swath of the
southeastern United States, and more than 3 million customers went into
the weekend without power and, for some, a continued threat of
floods.</p>
<p>Helene blew ashore in Florida’s Big Bend region as a Category 4
hurricane late Thursday packing winds of 225 kilometers per hour and
then quickly moved through Georgia, the Carolinas and Tennessee. The
storm uprooted trees, splintered homes and sent creeks and rivers over
their banks and straining dams.</p>
<p>Western North Carolina was essentially cut off because of landslides
and flooding that forced the closure of Interstate 40 and other roads.
There were hundreds of water rescues, none more dramatic than in rural
Unicoi County in eastern Tennessee, where dozens of patients and staff
were plucked by helicopter from the roof of a hospital that was
surrounded by water from a flooded river.</p>
<p>The storm, now a post-tropical cyclone, was expected to hover over
the Tennessee Valley on Saturday and Sunday, the National Hurricane
Center said. Several flood and flash flood warnings remained in effect
in parts of the southern and central Appalachian Mountains, while high
wind warnings also covered parts of Tennessee and Ohio.</p>
<p>Among the at least 44 people killed in the storm were three
firefighters, a woman and her 1-month-old twins, and an 89-year-old
woman whose house was struck by a falling tree. According to an
Associated Press tally, the deaths occurred in Florida, Georgia, North
Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia.</p>
<p>When the water hit knee-level in Kera O’Neil’s home in Hudson,
Florida, she knew it was time to escape.</p>
<p>“There’s a moment where you are thinking, ‘If this water rises above
the level of the stove, we are not going to have much room to breathe,’”
she said, recalling how she and her sister waded through chest-deep
water with one cat in a plastic carrier and another in a cardboard
box.</p>
<p>Evacuations and record rainfall</p>
<p>In North Carolina, a lake featured in the movie “Dirty Dancing”
overtopped a dam and surrounding neighborhoods were evacuated, although
there were no immediate concerns it would fail.</p>
<p>People also were evacuated from Newport, Tennessee, a town of about
7,000 people, amid concerns about a dam near there, although officials
later said the structure had not failed.</p>
<p>Tornadoes hit some areas, including one in Nash County, North
Carolina, that critically injured four people.</p>
<p>Atlanta received a record 28.24 centimeters of rain in 48 hours, the
most the city has seen in a two-day period since recordkeeping began in
1878, Georgia’s Office of the State Climatologist said on the social
platform X. Some neighborhoods were so badly flooded that only car roofs
could be seen poking above the water.</p>
<p>Moody’s Analytics said it expects $15 billion to $26 billion in
property damage.</p>
<p>Climate change has exacerbated conditions that allow such storms to
thrive, rapidly intensifying in warming waters and turning into powerful
cyclones sometimes in a matter of hours.</p>
<p>Big Bend region hit hard</p>
<p>Florida’s Big Bend is a part of the state where salt marshes and pine
flatwoods stretch into the horizon, and where the condo developments and
strip malls that have carved up so much of the state’s coastlines
elsewhere are largely absent.</p>
<p>It’s a place where Susan Sauls Hartway and her 4-year-old Chihuahua
mix, Lucy, could afford to live within walking distance of the beach on
her salary as a housekeeper.</p>
<p>At least, until her house was carried away by Helene. Friday
afternoon, Hartway wandered around her street near Ezell Beach,
searching for where the storm may have deposited her home.</p>
<p>“It’s gone. I don’t know where it’s at. I can’t find it,” she said of
her house.</p>
<p>Born and raised in rural Taylor County, Hartway said there is nowhere
in the world she would rather be, even after Helene. But she’s watched
as wealthier residents from out of state have bought up second homes
here. She wonders how many of them will sell out — and what will happen
to the locals who have nowhere else to go.</p>
<p>“There’s so many people down here … this was all they had,” she
said.</p>
<p>The community has taken direct hits from three hurricanes since
August 2023.</p>
<p>All five who died in one Florida county were in neighborhoods where
residents were told to evacuate, said Bob Gualtieri, the sheriff in
Pinellas County in the St. Petersburg area. Some who stayed ended up
having to retreat to their attics to escape the rising water. He said
the death toll could rise as crews go door-to-door in flooded areas.</p>
<p>More deaths were reported in Georgia and the Carolinas, including two
South Carolina firefighters and a Georgia firefighter who died when
trees struck their trucks. Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin reported at
least one death in his state.</p>
<p>Power loss and infrastructure damage</p>
<p>President Joe Biden said he was praying for survivors, and the head
of the Federal Emergency Management Agency headed to the area. The
agency deployed more than 1,500 workers, and they helped with 400
rescues by late Friday morning.</p>
<p>Officials urged people who were trapped to call for rescuers and not
tread floodwaters, warning they can be dangerous due to live wires,
sewage, sharp objects and other debris.</p>
<p>In Georgia, an electrical utility group warned of “catastrophic”
damage to utility infrastructure, with more than 100 high-voltage
transmission lines damaged. And officials in South Carolina, where more
than 40% of customers were without power, said crews had to cut their
way through debris just to determine what was still standing in some
places.</p>
<p>The hurricane came ashore near the mouth of the Aucilla River, about
30 kilometers northwest of where Hurricane Idalia hit last year at
nearly the same ferocity. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said the damage
from Helene appears to be greater than the combined effects of Idalia
and Hurricane Debby in August.</p>
<p>The destruction extended far beyond Florida.</p>
<p>Historic flooding expected</p>
<p>A mudslide in the Appalachian Mountains washed out part of an
interstate highway at the North Carolina-Tennessee state line.</p>
<p>Another slide hit homes in North Carolina, and occupants had to wait
more than four hours to be rescued, said Ryan Cole, the emergency
services assistant director in Buncombe County. His 911 center received
more than 3,300 calls in eight hours Friday.</p>
<p>“This is something that we’re going to be dealing with for many days
and weeks to come,” Cole said.</p>
<p>Forecasters warned of flooding in North Carolina that could be worse
than anything seen in the past century. The Connecticut Army National
Guard sent a helicopter to help.</p>
<p>Helene was the eighth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season,
which began June 1. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
has predicted an above-average season this year because of record-warm
ocean temperatures.</p>

id="glock-pistols-popular-among-us-criminals-because-theyre-easily-modified-report-says">Glock
pistols popular among US criminals because they’re easily modified,
report says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BALTIMORE — Glock pistols are a popular choice for people committing
gun crimes, in part because they can be easily converted into fully
automatic weapons using a small device, according to a new report based
on data from nearly three dozen U.S. cities.</p>
<p>Often called Glock switches or auto sears, the devices have received
heightened attention in recent years because they’re increasingly
turning up at crime scenes. They effectively turn semiautomatic weapons,
which fire one bullet per trigger pull, into machine guns that can spray
continuous gunfire.</p>
<p>Authorities believe the shooters who killed four people and injured
17 others in Birmingham, Alabama, last weekend were using conversion
devices to make their guns more powerful. About 100 shell casings were
recovered from the scene.</p>
<p>A report by the anti-violence organization Everytown for Gun Safety
says criminals often choose Glocks because they’re relatively cheap and
easy to operate and modify. But the brand is perhaps best known for its
popularity among law enforcement officers, who almost exclusively carry
Glock handguns.</p>
<p>The report was released this week ahead of a conference Thursday in
Baltimore hosted by Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a group that falls
under Everytown’s umbrella. The organization called on Glock and other
weapons manufacturers to take responsibility for their products and do
more to prevent violence.</p>
<p>“We have to build that level of accountability for them as well,”
Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott said in an interview. “At some point, as a
country, the sanctity of the lives of Americans has to begin to outweigh
the sanctity of American guns.”</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Glock didn’t respond to an email seeking
comment.</p>
<p>Scott and other mayors said while local elected officials are often
at the forefront of pushing for better gun policies, Congress must also
step up and address the issue.</p>
<p>Researchers found that four gun manufacturers accounted for more than
40% of the recovered guns they studied, with Glock alone accounting for
18%. The team compiled data from 34 U.S. cities about guns recovered
from crime scenes in 2023.</p>
<p>“They’re basically profiting off of pain,” said John Feinblatt,
president of Everytown. “They’re prioritizing profits over safety.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the prevalence of machine gun conversion devices has
increased dramatically — 570% between 2017 and 2021, according to the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The devices are
banned under federal law. Most are small pieces of metal or plastic made
with a 3D printer or ordered online.</p>
<p>The report also found that recoveries of Polymer80 ghost guns —
untraceable, unassembled firearms that can be purchased online —
increased nearly 1,200% across 28 cities over the past five years. Those
numbers have started trending downward following the implementation of a
new federal rule and a wave of state legislation banning the weapons,
according to the report. Polymer80, once a leading manufacturer of ghost
guns in the U.S., also shut down operations last month after a deluge of
lawsuits.</p>
<p>The city of Baltimore was among those who filed suit. City officials
announced a settlement agreement in February after the Nevada-based
company agreed to stop selling its products to Maryland residents.</p>
<p>The city’s lawsuit accused Polymer80 of intentionally undermining
federal and state firearms laws by designing, manufacturing and
providing gun assembly kits without serial numbers to buyers who don’t
undergo background checks. It was filed the same day Maryland’s
statewide ban on ghost guns went into effect in 2022 following a law
change that expanded the definition of a firearm to include “an
unfinished frame or receiver.”</p>
<p>A year later, recoveries of ghost guns in Baltimore had dropped 25%,
according to the report.</p>
<p>Gun violence has also decreased significantly in the city over
roughly the past two years, a positive trend that experts and officials
attribute to a wide range of factors, including expanded anti-violence
programs and ongoing police reform. Violence is trending downward
nationally as well following a sharp spike during the COVID-19
pandemic.</p>
<p>The report suggests several actions that manufacturers could take to
keep their firearms out of the hands of criminals, including through
increased oversight of the gun dealers they work with. Manufacturers
could also focus on producing safer weapons that aren’t easily modified
and fund advertising campaigns to increase public awareness of gun
safety.</p>
<p>“I think common sense can get through to people. I think wanting to
save the lives of our children can get through to people,” said Kansas
City Mayor Quinton Lucas. “Manufacturers could do things tomorrow that
would make guns safer and save lives.”</p>

id="the-price-of-gold-keeps-climbing-to-unprecedented-heights.-heres-why">The
price of gold keeps climbing to unprecedented heights. Here’s why</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — The rush for gold just keeps coming.</p>
<p>Gold hit another all-time high this week. Recent gains for the
precious metal are largely credited to ongoing economic uncertainty,
geopolitical tensions and strong demand from central banks around the
world.</p>
<p>If trends continue, analysts have bullish outlooks on the price of
gold for the months ahead. But the future is never promised. Here’s what
you need to know.</p>
<p>Where does the price of gold stand today?</p>
<p>The New York spot price of gold closed Tuesday at just over $2,657
per Troy ounce — the standard for measuring precious metals, which is
equivalent to 31 grams — the highest recorded to date, per FactSet. That
would make a gold bar or brick weighing 400 Troy ounces worth more than
$1.06 million today.</p>
<p>This week’s record high means that the price of gold has climbed
hundreds of dollars per Troy ounce over the last year. Tuesday’s price
is up nearly $145 from a month ago and more than $740 from this time in
2023.</p>
<p>The price of gold is up nearly 30% year to date, analysts note —
outpacing the benchmark S&amp;P 500’s roughly 20% gain since the start
of 2024.</p>
<p>Why is the price of gold going up?</p>
<p>There are a few factors behind the recent gains.</p>
<p>Interest in buying gold often comes at times of uncertainty — with
potential concerns around inflation and the strength of the U.S. dollar,
for example, causing some to look for alternative places to park their
money. Gold also surged in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Among sources of uncertainty today are geopolitical tensions — which
escalated over recent days with Israel’s deadly strikes in Lebanon. And
the ongoing wars in Gaza and Ukraine have continued to fuel fears about
the future worldwide.</p>
<p>In markets like the U.S., there’s also particular concern about the
health of the job market. Last week’s larger-than-usual half-point cut
by the Federal Reserve signals a new focus on slowing employment
numbers, and more rate cuts are expected before the end of the year. And
such action arrives in the midst of a tumultuous election year — which
could prove crucial to economic policy in the road ahead, too.</p>
<p>In the near future, people are considering “any case of turbulence in
the economy,” FxPro senior market analyst Michel Saliby explained. “This
is why they’re keeping a decent portion of gold in their portfolio as a
‘safe haven.’”</p>
<p>Analysts also point to strong demand from central banks around the
world. Joe Cavatoni, senior market strategist at the World Gold Council,
noted last month that central bank demand was well-above the five year
average — reflecting “heightened concern with inflation and economic
stability.”</p>
<p>Recent stimulus measures in China aimed at boosting consumer spending
are also expected to up retail investments, Saliby added, further
boosting gold’s performance.</p>
<p>Is gold worth the investment?</p>
<p>Advocates of investing in gold call it a “safe haven,” arguing the
commodity can serve to diversify and balance your investment portfolio,
as well as mitigate possible risks down the road. Some also take comfort
in buying something tangible that has the potential to increase in value
over time.</p>
<p>Experts caution against putting all your eggs in one basket.</p>
<p>Both retail and institutional investors shouldn’t be influenced by
the “FOMO effect,” or fear of missing out, Saliby notes — explaining
that people should not risk all their money just because they are seeing
others rake in gains. He advises investors to watch the market and
always have a clear risk management strategy for their position.</p>
<p>If geopolitical tensions cool, Saliby expects the price of gold to
correct slightly, perhaps falling around $50 to $80. But he remains
bullish overall for the near future — expecting gold’s spot price to
soon surpass the $2,700 mark previously predicted for 2025, and perhaps
reach as high as $2,800 or $2,900 if trends continue.</p>
<p>Still, future gains are never promised and not everyone agrees gold
is a good investment. Critics say gold isn’t always the inflation hedge
many say it is — and that there are more efficient ways to protect
against potential loss of capital, such as through derivative-based
investments.</p>
<p>The Commodity Futures Trade Commission has also previously warned
people to be wary of investing in gold. Precious metals can be highly
volatile, the commission said, and prices rise as demand goes up —
meaning “when economic anxiety or instability is high, the people who
typically profit from precious metals are the sellers.”</p>
<p>If you do choose to invest in gold, the commission adds, it’s
important to educate yourself on safe trading practices and be cautious
of potential scams and counterfeits on the market.</p>

imposes new fine, demands payments before letting X resume</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SAO PAULO/BRASILIA BRAZIL — Brazil’s Supreme Court said on Friday
that social platform X still needs to pay just over $5 million in
pending fines, including a new one, before it will be allowed to resume
its service in the country, according to a court document. </p>
<p>Earlier this week, the Elon Musk-owned U.S. firm told the court it
had complied with orders to stop the spread of misinformation and asked
it to lift a ban on the platform. </p>
<p>But Judge Alexandre de Moraes responded on Friday with a ruling that
X and its legal representative in Brazil must still agree to pay a total
of $3.4 million in pending fines that were previously ordered by the
court. </p>
<p>In his decision, the judge said that the court can use resources
already frozen from X and Starlink accounts in Brazil, but to do so the
satellite company, also owned by Musk, had to drop its pending appeal
against the fund blockage.  </p>
<p>The judge also demanded a new $1.8 million fine related to a brief
period last week when X became available again for some users in
Brazil. </p>
<p>X, formerly known as Twitter, did not immediately respond to a
request for comment. </p>
<p>According to a person close to X, the tech firm will likely pay all
the fines but will consider challenging the fine that was imposed by the
court after the platform ban.  </p>
<p>X has been suspended since late August in Brazil, one of its largest
and most coveted markets, after Moraes ruled it had failed to comply
with orders related to restricting hate speech and naming a local legal
representative. </p>
<p>Musk, who had denounced the orders as censorship and called Moraes a
“dictator,” backed down and started to reverse his position last week,
when X lawyers said the platform tapped a local representative and would
comply with court rulings. </p>
<p>In Friday’s decision, Moraes said that X had proved it had now
blocked accounts as ordered by the court and had named the required
legal representative in Brazil.</p>

dismisses China’s Ukraine peace plan over material support for
Russia</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>new york — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday that
China’s words and actions regarding ending Russia’s war on Ukraine do
not “add up,” as the Beijing government continues to allow Chinese
companies to “fuel Russia’s war machine.”</p>
<p>The United States and China are planning a call between President Joe
Biden and President Xi Jinping in the coming days, with China’s material
support for Russia in the war on Ukraine expected to be a key topic on
the U.S. agenda. </p>
<p>Friday afternoon, Blinken held talks with Chinese Foreign Minister
Wang Yi on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York.</p>
<p>Ukraine </p>
<p>Following talks that lasted more than an hour, Blinken told reporters
at a news conference that any peace plan to end Russia’s war on Ukraine
must be based on the principles of the U.N. Charter, particularly
territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence.</p>
<p>“A peace in which the aggressor gets everything that it sought, and
the victim does not have its rights upheld, is not a recipe for a
lasting peace, and certainly not a just one,” Blinken said when asked
about a peace proposal by China and Brazil.</p>
<p>Earlier on Friday, China and Brazil pushed forward with efforts to
rally developing countries behind a plan to end Russia’s war in Ukraine,
despite Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s rejection of the
initiative, viewing it as favorable to Moscow’s interests.</p>
<p>The meeting between Blinken and Wang came amid growing U.S. concerns
over Chinese firms supplying semiconductor chips and drones to Moscow,
which have significantly bolstered Russia’s battlefield capabilities in
its war against Ukraine.</p>
<p>Blinken said, “Roughly 70% of the machine tools that Russia’s
importing, coming from China, Hong Kong.  Ninety percent of the
microelectronics, from China, Hong Kong.  And this is materially helping
the Russians produce the missiles, the rockets, the armored vehicles,
the munitions that they need to perpetuate the war, to continue their
aggression.”</p>
<p>In New York, Wang told reporters that China had discussed with other
countries the importance of preventing escalation in Russia’s war on
Ukraine.</p>
<p>“Russia and Ukraine are neighbors that cannot be moved away from each
other and amity is the only realistic option,” Wang said, emphasizing
that other nations should support an international peace conference
involving Russia and Ukraine. </p>
<p>Taiwan</p>
<p>On Friday, Blinken said he also “emphasized the importance of
maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait” during the
meeting with his Chinese counterpart.</p>
<p>Rick Waters, former deputy assistant secretary of state for China and
Taiwan, said the United States and China share an interest in
maintaining diplomatic and military communication.</p>
<p>“You’re not going to resolve disputes over Taiwan or the South China
Sea in those channels, but I don’t think either leader wants a military
mishap to put them in a corner where they might have to contend with
escalation or, even worse, conflict,” Waters, now managing director of
Eurasia Group’s China practice, said in a recent interview with VOA.</p>
<p>The People’s Republic of China (PRC) will celebrate its National Day
on Tuesday, commemorating the founding of the country in 1949.</p>
<p>Taiwan celebrates October 10, known as “Double 10,” as the
anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China (ROC) in 1912. The
Republic of China is Taiwan’s formal name.</p>
<p>Taiwan has been self-ruled since 1949, when Mao Zedong’s communists
took power in Beijing after defeating Chiang Kai-shek’s Kuomintang
nationalists in a civil war, prompting the nationalists’ relocation to
the island.</p>
<p>PRC leaders usually carefully watch the speeches from leaders in
Taiwan during its Double 10 celebrations.</p>
<p>Since Taiwan’s democratically elected President Lai Ching-te took
office in May, Beijing has increased military pressure against Taiwan.
The PRC has deemed Lai a separatist.</p>
<p>U.S. officials have stressed to their Chinese counterparts that the
more pressure China applies to Taiwan, the more it risks pushing Taiwan
further away, according to sources familiar with recent diplomatic
discussions between Washington and Beijing.</p>
<p>Analysts indicate they do not expect Lai to advocate for issues
considered taboo by China in the coming months.</p>
<p>“Taiwan President Lai has been quite careful not to touch China’s red
lines in his public remarks since becoming the president of Taiwan,”
Dennis Wilder, senior fellow for the Initiative for U.S.-China Dialogue
on Global Issues at Georgetown University, told VOA. “I would guess that
he will try again to reach out to Beijing and do not expect him to push
independence themes.”</p>
<p>Wilder added, “The Chinese leadership came to the conclusion long ago
that because of Lai’s deep green background they would never be able to
trust him. Thus, there is very little he can do, as was the case as well
with former President Tsai [Ing-wen], to convince Beijing that they
should improve cross-strait relations while he is in office.” He was
referring to Taiwan’s political coalition known for its pro-independence
platform.</p>

<h2 id="harris-visits-border-patrol-leaders-in-arizona">Harris visits
Border Patrol leaders in Arizona</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>DOUGLAS, Arizona — U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris walked a scrubby
stretch of fence line along Arizona’s border with Mexico on Friday,
seeking to project an image of strength against illegal migration as she
confronts one of her biggest vulnerabilities in the November
election.</p>
<p>In her first trip to the international boundary since becoming the
Democratic presidential nominee, Harris chatted with local Border Patrol
leaders as they strode along a rust-colored stretch of wall built during
Barack Obama’s presidency. Temperatures in Douglas, Arizona, neared 37.7
degrees Celsius during a conversation that lasted about half an
hour.</p>
<p>“They’ve got a tough job, and they need, rightly, support to do their
job,” Harris said of the Border Patrol as she entered the Douglas port
of entry for a briefing on efforts to block the flow of fentanyl across
the border. “They are very dedicated. And so I’m here to talk with them
about what we can continue to do to support them. And also thank them
for the hard work they do.”</p>
<p>Later, she was expected to call for further tightening asylum
restrictions, moving beyond President Joe Biden’s policy on an issue
where her rival, former President Donald Trump, has an edge with voters.
Hundreds of people packed into a gymnasium to hear her speak.</p>
<p>Trump and his fellow Republicans have pounded Harris relentlessly
over the Biden administration’s record on migration and fault the vice
president for spending little time visiting the border during her time
in the White House.</p>
<p>Harris will outline her plan to crack down further on asylum claims
and keep the restrictions in place longer compared with the executive
order that Biden signed this summer, according to a campaign official
who spoke on condition of anonymity because Harris had not yet made the
announcement. The official briefed reporters aboard Air Force 2 en route
to Arizona.</p>
<p>Harris arrived by helicopter in Douglas, where she met with Mayor
Donald Huish, Cochise County Sheriff Mark Dannels and County Supervisor
Ann English, along with Senator Mark Kelly and Attorney General Kris
Mayes.</p>
<p>Immigration and border security are top issues in Arizona, the only
battleground state that borders Mexico and one that contended with a
record influx of asylum-seekers last year. Voters favor Trump on
migration, and Harris has gone on offense to improve her standing on the
issue and defuse a key line of political attack for Trump.</p>
<p>In nearly every campaign speech she gives, Harris recounts how a
sweeping bipartisan package aiming to overhaul the federal immigration
system collapsed in Congress earlier this year after Trump urged top
Republicans to oppose it.</p>
<p>“The American people deserve a president who cares more about border
security than playing political games,” Harris plans to say, according
to an excerpt of her remarks previewed by her campaign.</p>
<p>After the immigration legislation stalled, the Biden administration
announced rules that bar migrants from being granted asylum when U.S.
officials deem that the southern border is overwhelmed. Since then,
arrests for illegal border crossings have fallen.</p>
<p>Harris will also use her trip to remind voters about her work as
attorney general of California in confronting crime along the border.
During an August rally in Glendale, outside Phoenix, she talked about
helping to prosecute drug- and people-smuggling gangs that operated
transnationally and at the border.</p>
<p>“I prosecuted them in case after case, and I won,” Harris said
then.</p>
<p>The vice president’s trip to Douglas thrusts the issue of immigration
into the brightest spotlight yet less than six weeks before Election
Day.</p>
<p>Trump didn’t wait for her to arrive there before pushing back. He
pointed Friday to purported data about criminals entering the U.S.
illegally in a bid to link Harris to violent crimes committed by
migrants. In a scathing diatribe, he said “blood is on her hands.”</p>
<p>“These are hard, tough, vicious criminals that are free to roam in
our country,” Trump said at a manufacturing plant in Michigan.</p>
<p>Earlier in the week, he told voters that “when Kamala speaks about
the border, her credibility is less than zero.”</p>
<p>The Trump campaign has also countered with its own TV ads deriding
the vice president as a failed “border czar.”</p>
<p>“Under Harris, over 10 million illegally here,” said one spot.
However, estimates on how many people have entered the country illegally
since the start of the Biden administration in 2021 vary widely.</p>
<p>Harris also never held the position of border czar. Instead, her
assignment was to tackle the “root causes” of migration from three
Central American nations — El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras — that
were responsible for a significant share of border crossers.</p>
<p>The vice president took a long-term approach to an immediate problem,
helping persuade multinational corporations and Latin American
businesses to invest in the region. That, she argued, would create jobs
and give locals more reasons to stay home rather than take the arduous
trek north.</p>
<p>Still, Trump has continued to decry an “invasion” of border
crossers.</p>
<p>Douglas, where Harris appeared, is an overwhelmingly Democratic
border town in GOP-dominated Cochise County, where the Republicans on
the board of supervisors are facing criminal charges for refusing to
certify the 2022 election results. Trump was in the area last month,
using a remote stretch of border wall and a pile of steel beams to draw
a contrast between himself and Harris on border security.</p>
<p>The town of 16,000 people has strong ties to its much larger
neighbor, Agua Prieta, Mexico, and a busy port of entry that’s slated
for a long-sought upgrade. Many locals are as concerned with making
legal border crossings more efficient as they are with combatting
illegal ones.</p>

<h3>
Who Isn’t Amped About Climate Policy?
</h3>
<p>
On the first night of climate week, I headed over to a happy hour hosted
by a bunch of progressive climate advocacy nonprofits, including Climate
Cabinet, Data for Progress, and Evergreen Collaborative. The event was
called “Progress No Matter What,” and the theme was states’ ability to
advance climate action regardless of national politics.
</p>
<p>
On the packed back patio of a beer garden on the Lower East Side, a
handful of speakers took turns climbing atop a picnic bench to address
the boisterous crowd. State and federal officials celebrated the
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/save/rebates" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>billions
of dollars</u></a>
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/scep/energy-efficiency-and-conservation-block-grant-program" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>flowing
to states</u></a> to decarbonize and pressed attendees not to ignore the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/8-climate-races-election-2024" target="_self"><u>down-ballot
climate champions</u></a> running for office in November. Then, to close
things out, White House Climate Advisor Ali Zaidi got up. Over the past
year, I’ve heard Zaidi deliver the same impassioned but rehearsed
preamble on press call after press call reminding us of President
Biden’s climate accomplishments during his term. But here, Zaidi let
loose. He said the <em><em>Wall Street Journal</em></em> had
<a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/energy-oil/americas-ambitious-climate-plan-is-faltering-ac833191" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>published
a story</u></a> that morning that started with the line “Climate
optimism is fading.” He didn’t think so. “This is popular shit!” he
declared, of efforts to fight climate change while reducing pollution,
and the audience erupted in cheers. — <em><em>Emily Pontecorvo</em></em>
</p>
<h3>
A Video Journal of Climate Extremes
</h3>
<p>
Last weekend, I attended the U.S. premiere of
<a href="https://herenowproject.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>The
Here Now Project</em></em></u></a> at the inaugural Climate Film
Festival — and was totally wowed. The 75-minute documentary is
unnarrated and composed entirely of archival cell phone videos, vlogs,
and news clips that were shot during climate disasters in 2021, ranging
from
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Texas_power_crisis" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
Texas power crisis</u></a> that left almost 250 people dead after a
February cold snap to the
“<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/12/turkey-sea-snot-climate-change/620756/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>sea
snot</u></a>” that covered Turkey’s Sea of Marmara over that summer.
</p>
<p>
While it’s harrowing to see all the footage back-to-back — and to learn
about disasters I hadn’t paid close attention to at the time, like
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/07/21/china-floods-subway-people-trapped/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
subway flooding in Zhengzhou</u></a> or
<a href="https://worldenvironmentalconservancy.org/dust-and-sand-storms-hit-brazil/#:~:text=Between%20September%208th%20and%20October,Sul%2C%20Minas%20Gerais%20and%20Goi%C3%A1s." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
dust storms in Brazil</u></a> — I was even more struck by the seemingly
universal urge people have to document the way extreme weather upends
their lives, even when those lives are quite immediately at risk.
</p>
<p>
The movie’s power lies in echoes and patterns of human nature, from our
curiosity to our horror to our powerful compassion and self-sacrifice. I
spoke to the filmmakers, Greg Jacobs and Jon Siskel, for
<a href="https://heatmap.news/culture/climate-change-movies-film-festival" target="_self"><u>my
article</u></a> about the Climate Film Festival last week, and Jacobs
told me they hope to make <em><em>The Here Now Project</em></em> an
ongoing chronicle of climate change in the style of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_(film_series)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Michael
Apted’s famous </u><u><em><em>Up</em></em></u><u> series</u></a>; I very
much hope they will succeed. — <em><em>Jeva Lange</em></em>

<h3>
In Search of a Demand Signal for Carbon Dioxide Removal
</h3>
<p>
At several events this week related to carbon dioxide removal, the
conversation turned again and again to the challenge of finance and the
scarcity of buyers. During a marine carbon removal panel on Monday, for
instance, James Lindsay, the director of investments at the
philanthropic Builders Initiative described the tension between
simultaneously trying to raise capital for a given carbon removal
approach while also trying to prove that it’s safe and actually works.
While there are a few buyers, like the Frontier Climate initiative, that
accept these conditions and are willing to support nascent approaches
that may or may not work out, making one big deal with Frontier doesn’t
provide the consistent cash flow that a startup needs to progress, he
said.
</p>
<p>
Later that day, at a mini-conference hosted by the direct air capture
company Climeworks, CEO Christoph Gebald declared that the industry
simply cannot rely on voluntary purchases if it is going to scale. “We
need to transition to regulated markets,” he said. Josh Becker, a
California State Senator gave a brief presentation on a bill he
introduced this year,
<a href="https://theclimatecenter.org/our-work/bill-tracker/sb-308-becker-carbon-dioxide-removal-market-development-act/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>SB
308</u></a>, to do just that. It was a “government-enabled, market led”
policy that would have required corporate polluters to begin paying for
carbon removal. The bill “died a mysterious death,” he said, but he
plans to try again in 2025.
</p>
<p>
The event closed out with a panel on “the economic opportunity of carbon
removal in the U.S.,” and yet the talk once again turned to the economic
obstacles. “Demand is an existential challenge,” Giana Amadour,
executive director of the Carbon Removal Alliance, said. “If we want
deployment beyond these 1,000- to 10,000-ton facilities, we need a
demand signal that is robust, steady, resilient, growing, in order to
make sure these companies can raise the private and public sector
funding they need.” — <em><em>Emily</em></em>

<h3>
Clean Energy for the People
</h3>
<p>
While most of the energy developers, technologists, and investors I
spoke to and/or heard speak this week were excited about
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/ai-climate-week-clean-energy" target="_self"><u>artificial
intelligence</u></a> as a way to bring forward demand for clean
electrons, there was one interesting note of caution from Katie Rae,
chief executive of Engine Ventures, the investment firm that has backed
Commonwealth Fusion Systems and the long-duration battery company Form
Energy. “The government has to think about it: Are the people going to
get energy? Or are
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/ai-additionality-framework" target="_self"><u>the
hyperscalers going to get energy</u></a>? The pitchforks can come.” —

<h3>
Journey to the Center of the Earth (With My Face on It)
</h3>
<p>
On Tuesday morning, I stopped by “Geothermal House,” a day-long event
and installation at the Hall des Lumières near City Hall. It’s a former
bank building that now hosts “immersive experiences,” which essentially
amount to wandering around a room decorated with floor to ceiling
projections of art, like the paintings of Chagall. This time, however,
the room was made up to bring you miles deep within the Earth’s crust.
</p>

VR lounge at Geothermal
House.</small><small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Emily
Pontecorvo</small>
</p>
<p>
The event was put on by Project InnerSpace, a nonprofit dedicated to
transferring skills and knowledge from the oil and gas industry to scale
geothermal energy. “This is the first time geothermal has shown up at NY
Climate Week,” the group’s executive director, Jamie Beard, declared at
the start of a series of panels held in the central hall. Unfortunately,
the talks were nearly impossible to hear in the cavernous marble room,
but I spent some time wandering around, watching the animated
projections of geothermal power plants and hit up the “VR lounge,” which
offered a much more convincing immersive experience and taught me about
the difference between “enhanced” and “advanced” geothermal.
</p>
<p>
The event also had some of the best swag I saw at Climate Week,
including a station where you could 3D print your face onto “the core of
the Earth.” Jeva was accurate when she compared the resulting object to
a

<h3>
A Tribal Home, Lost
</h3>
<p>
Two members of the Jean Charles Choctaw Nation — which is considered to
be one of the first communities in the U.S. to be displaced by climate
change — spoke at an event on Wednesday hosted by EarthRights
International. They emphasized the way the state of Louisiana failed to
keep the tribe intact during the relocation effort, with Chief Deme
Naquin and Tribal Secretary Chantel Comardelle explaining that while
their own story is one marked by failure, they hope other communities
will be able to learn from it. After all, it’s not just a house or
neighborhood that you lose to something like coastal erosion; it’s also
the stories and memories of the place you’d called home. “We probably
weren’t the first” community to be displaced by climate change, Chief
Deme told the room, “but we’re <em><em>definitely</em></em> not the
last.” — <em><em>Jeva </em></em>
</p>
<h3>
‘AI Doesn’t Care Where It Goes to School’
</h3>
<p>
And over in D.C., during “National Clean Energy Week,” a more
industry-focused panel-ganza, the cofounder and chief executive of the
most important company in energy was sharing his thoughts on the sector.
That would be Nvidia’s Jensen Huang, the head of the company that
designs the chips that power many artificial intelligence models and
applications.
</p>
<p>
During his one-hour chat with former Education Secretary Margaret
Spellings at the Bipartisan Policy Center on Friday, Huang focused
mostly on what good AI could do for energy and grid efficiency,
including weather simulation and designing smart grids. While it’s true,
Huang said, “that AI does take energy,” AI-trained models can predict
weather and climate “tens of thousands of times more energy efficiently”
than supercomputers. But he was also straightforward about the intense
energy demands of training artificial intelligence models.
</p>
<p>
“These data centers could consume, today, maybe 100 megawatts. In the
future it will be 10, 20 times more than that.” To reduce strain on the
grid, these data centers could be located “where the energy” is located,
Huang suggested. “The AI doesn’t care where it goes to school.” And like
a student, “it’s okay” if it sometimes has to “take a nap” when the
sun’s not out. — <em><em>Matthew </em></em>

id="us-moves-against-iranian-actors-charged-with-election-meddling">US
moves against Iranian actors charged with election meddling</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The United States put bounties on three Iranian hackers,
charging them with multiple crimes in connection with an attempt to
undermine former President Donald Trump’s reelection campaign and upend
the upcoming U.S. presidential election.</p>
<p>Friday’s actions by multiple U.S. government agencies came with just
a little over a month until U.S. voters go to the polls and as U.S.
officials seek to push back against what they describe as ever more
brazen attempts by Iran to foment division and discord in Washington and
beyond.</p>
<p>“You and your hackers can’t hide behind your keyboards,” said FBI
Director Christopher Wray in a video statement.</p>
<p>“If you try to meddle in our elections, we’re going to hold you
accountable,” Wray said. “As long as you keep attempting to flout the
rule of law, you’re going to keep running into the FBI.”</p>
<p>Iranian officials have previously and repeatedly rejected U.S.
accusations of election meddling. The Iranian Mission to the United
Nations has not yet responded to VOA’s request for comment on the latest
allegations.</p>
<p>But an indictment unsealed by the U.S. Justice Department assigns
responsibility for Iran’s long-standing efforts, as well as a recent
hack-and-leak operation aimed at derailing the Trump campaign, to three
hackers employed by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or
IRGC.</p>
<p>It accuses Masoud Jalili, Seyyed Ali Aghamiri and Yaser Balaghi of
engaging in what prosecutors describe as a wide-ranging campaign to hack
into the work and personal email accounts of current and former
government officials, campaign officials and members of the media.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said their list of victims includes a former State
Department official, a former presidential homeland security adviser and
at least two former CIA officials.</p>
<p>But starting in May, prosecutors allege, the three Iranians turned
their attention to the Trump campaign, stealing documents and materials
that they then sought to leak to the public.</p>
<p>“I think this information is worth a good [U.S. news publication]
piece with your narration,” they wrote in an email to a U.S. news outlet
in late July or early August, according to the indictment. “Let me know
your thoughts.”</p>
<p>The revelations build on a U.S. intelligence assessment shared last
week, which alleged Iranian actors tried to ensnare officials with the
reelection campaign of U.S. President Joe Biden, before Biden’s decision
to drop out of the race.</p>
<p>The Trump campaign first announced the suspected hack last month,
initially blaming “foreign sources hostile to the United States.” U.S.
intelligence officials attributed the attack to Iran about a week
later.</p>
<p>“The defendants’ own words make clear that they were attempting to
undermine former President Trump’s campaign in advance of the 2024 U.S.
presidential election,” said U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland
during a news conference to announce the charges Friday.</p>
<p>All three are believed to remain in Iran, although the U.S. is
offering a reward of up to $10 million for information that leads to
their arrests. And both the State Department and the FBI have issued
wanted posters of the suspects.</p>
<p>“We will follow these people for the rest of their lives,” Garland
said.</p>
<p>The indictment also makes clear that the efforts spearheaded by the
Iranian hackers have not necessarily abated, noting there have been
efforts to potentially steal more information as well as to leak already
stolen materials to media outlets.</p>
<p>“When it comes to advanced persistent threat actors, you can never be
fully confident that you have eradicated them from an environment,” a
senior FBI official told reporters Friday, briefing on the condition of
anonymity. “So, we remain fully engaged with the victims in this case,
which include presidential campaigns, as well as individuals associated
with those campaigns, to breed resilience among their systems and their
various email accounts.”</p>
<p>U.S. intelligence agencies have previously said that Tehran is
working to hurt the campaign of Trump, believing his election would be
detrimental to Iran’s goals in the Middle East and beyond.</p>
<p>Senior officials said the latest indictment shows Iranian officials
remain intent on damaging the Trump campaign.</p>
<p>“Iran perceives this year’s elections to be particularly
consequential in terms of the impact they could have on its national
security interests,” said the senior FBI official. “We will be more
persistent than the Iranian actors in ensuring that we are assisting
victims of this activity [and] increase their resilience against these
actors.”</p>
<p>Jalili, Aghamiri and Balaghi are charged with multiple counts of
conspiracy to commit identity theft, aggravated identity theft, access
device fraud, unauthorized access to computers and wire fraud.</p>
<p>The various charges carry maximum penalties ranging from two to 27
years in prison.</p>

<h2 id="tennessee-is-hurricane-country-now">Tennessee Is Hurricane
Country Now</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-27, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p>
After a hurricane makes landfall comes the eerie wait for bad news. For
Hurricane Helene — now a tropical storm as it barrels toward Nashville —
that news came swiftly on Friday morning: at least 4 million are without
power after the storm’s Thursday night arrival near Florida’s Big Bend
region; more than
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/27/weather/helene-deaths.html?smid=url-share" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">20
are dead</a> in three states; and damage estimates are already in the
billions of dollars.
</p>
<p>
But that’s just the news from the coasts.
</p>
<p>
As Helene is set to illustrate yet again, hurricanes are
<em><em>not</em></em> just coastal events — especially in the era of our
warming climate. The National Weather Service
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/NWSGSP/posts/920403820113200?ref=embed_page" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>warned</u></a>
towns in the Blue Ridge Mountains of South Carolina and Georgia that
Helene will be “one of the most significant weather events” in the
region in “the modern era,” while the Appalachians are in store for a
“catastrophic, historic flooding disaster” according to AccuWeather’s
Chief Meteorologist Jonathan Porter during a briefing with reporters
Friday morning. He added for good measure: “This is not the kind of
language we use very often.”
</p>
<p>
Helene’s dangerous inland impacts are precisely what the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/noaa-hurricane-forecast-2024" target="_self"><u>sounded
the alarm over earlier this year</u></a>. Ninety percent of hurricane
fatalities result from water, and almost 60% of those are freshwater
deaths caused by heavy rainfall. Such fatalities often occur hundreds of
miles from the shore in flash floods fueled by the warmer atmosphere,
which can hold and dispense
<a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/is-extreme-weather-climate-change#:~:text=which%20means%20worse%20deluges" target="_self"><u>far
more moisture</u></a> in a short period than would have been possible in
the pre-industrial era.
</p>
<p>
With Helene specifically, “there are going to be communities that are
cut off” as bridges are compromised and roadways wash out, Porter said.
Especially in mountain communities that might have
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/wildfire-traffic-jam-evacuation" target="_self"><u>only
one or two ways in and out of town</u></a>, that kind of rain raises the
level of difficulty for any sort of emergency response and can make
evacuation impossible. There have already been reports of 12 to 15
inches of rain in some parts of North Carolina.
</p>
<p>
“This is steep terrain,” Porter said. “When you get rain rates of 2 to 4
inches per hour, that is going to result in very significant flash

<p class="drop-caps">
When Hurricane Helene began to take shape in the Gulf of Mexico, there
was one factor that quickly made the storm stand out to meteorologists:
its size. Helene is “unusually large,” the
<a href="https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/communities-need-to-prepare-for-catastrophic-life-threatening-inland-flooding-from-helene-even-well" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>National
Hurricane Center</u></a> said; “exceptionally large,” per the
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/09/25/helene-florida-hurricane-path-update/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>Washington
Post</em></em></u></a>. Upon landfall, it was one of largest hurricanes
in modern history, according to hurricane expert
<a href="https://michaelrlowry.substack.com/p/helene-rapidly-strengthens-through?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=913838&post_id=149492482&utm_campaign=email-post-title&isFreemail=true&token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoyNzA5MjcsInBvc3RfaWQiOjE0OTQ5MjQ4MiwiaWF0IjoxNzI3NDQ4OTYwLCJleHAiOjE3MzAwNDA5NjAsImlzcyI6InB1Yi05MTM4MzgiLCJzdWIiOiJwb3N0LXJlYWN0aW9uIn0.r-Nw51qAkkeKWgdDcEQiveASrWdVfXfBprAcMopmPrw&r=5t1r&triedRedirect=true&utm_medium=email" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Michael
Lowry</u></a> — bigger than Harvey, bigger than Katrina,
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/09/26/hurricane-helene-storm-size-miles/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>surpassed</u></a>
only by 2017’s Hurricane Irma, which was one of the
<a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions/dcmi.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>costliest
tropical storms</u></a> on record and resulted in dozens of
<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/wr/mm6730a5.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>deaths</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Bigger does not always correlate to stronger. Discussions around the
strength of a hurricane typically center on its wind speeds (which is
what the categories connote) and the volume of rain it is expected to
unleash. But in Helene’s case, there was both size and power — when the
storm made
<a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2024/al09/al092024.update.09270318.shtml?" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>landfall</u></a>
in Florida’s Big Bend region late Thursday night, it was classified as a
Category 4 storm, with sustained winds of 140 miles per hour.

a state of emergency in 61 of the state’s 67 counties ahead of the
storm, speaking to the breadth of damage he expects to see and the long
recovery process to come. Already,

and millions are without electricity. As Helene continues its course,
it’s bringing

In the hours and days to come, we’ll get a better understanding of how
well forecasters did predicting the path and strength of this storm, a
task that has become increasingly difficult. Because at the same time
technology has improved oversight of these storms, with artificial
intelligence models that have raised the bar for prediction accuracy and
the ability to deploy radar systems as they pass overhead, climate
change is altering the ingredients that feed their formation. For
example, record-high temperatures in oceans have changed the behavior of
storms as they form, Matt Lanza, who monitors Atlantic storm activity
for
<a href="https://theeyewall.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em>The
Eyewall</em></u></a>, explained to me, resulting in more storms
intensifying rapidly ahead of landfall. This has made storms like 2023’s
Hurricane Idalia tougher to
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/hurricane-idalia-florida-storm-surge" target="_self"><u>predict</u></a>,
despite being closely tracked.
</p>
<p>
Helene, too,
<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tropical-storm-helene-hurricane-path-maps-track-forecast/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>rapidly
intensified</u></a> on its way to reaching land. The area of Florida
where it hit, a little over 50 miles from the state capital in
Tallahassee, is no stranger to storms— in just the past 13 months,
Florida’s Big Bend has had to absorb the impacts of both Idalia and
Hurricane Debby, each of which caused
<a href="https://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/news/look-back-debby" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>billions</u></a>
of
<a href="https://www.wfla.com/weather/tracking-the-tropics/hurricane-idalia-claimed-12-lives-caused-3-6-billion-in-damage-nhc-report-finds/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20NOAA%20National,from%20%242.6%20to%20%244.2%20billion." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>dollars</u></a>
in damages. Still, Truchelut said Hurricane Helene could be a “truly
unprecedented scenario for North Florida.” Part of the unusual force
behind this storm can be attributed to another unprecedented scenario —
the warmth of the water in the Gulf of Mexico.
<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/storm-hurricane-helene-florida-gulf-coast/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>CBS
News</u></a> said the water surface temperature below the storm’s
formation was up to 89 degrees Fahrenheit, which is as much as 4 degrees
above average. This follows the overall Gulf warming trend
<a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/news/gulf-mexico-getting-warmer" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>observed</u></a>
by NOAA, which the agency says “increases the intensity of hurricanes.”
</p>
<p>
Another factor that allowed Helene to grow so huge so fast was the lack
of
<a href="https://www.weather.gov/ilx/swop-springtopics" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>wind
shear</u></a>, a term meteorologists use to refer to the way wind
changes speed or direction or both across different elevations. Strong
upper-level winds can
<a href="https://www.weather.gov/source/zhu/ZHU_Training_Page/tropical_stuff/hurricane_anatomy/hurricane_anatomy.html#:~:text=Wind%20shear%20is%20a%20change,level%20winds%20are%20too%20strong." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>inhibit</u></a>
storms from forming or growing. In Helene’s case, however, warm water
was accompanied by low wind shear and plenty of moisture— conditions
that aligned to provide tremendous energy for the storm’s formation. The
only thing really standing in Helene’s way was its own size, Lanza
noted, which would have made it more difficult for the storm to get
organized and strengthen further.
</p>
<p>
The most obvious reason size matters is the footprint the storm will
have on land. To give you an idea of just how large Helene is, Lowry
said in his
<a href="https://michaelrlowry.substack.com/p/helene-rapidly-strengthens-through?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=913838&post_id=149492482&utm_campaign=email-post-title&isFreemail=true&token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoyNzA5MjcsInBvc3RfaWQiOjE0OTQ5MjQ4MiwiaWF0IjoxNzI3NDQ4OTYwLCJleHAiOjE3MzAwNDA5NjAsImlzcyI6InB1Yi05MTM4MzgiLCJzdWIiOiJwb3N0LXJlYWN0aW9uIn0.r-Nw51qAkkeKWgdDcEQiveASrWdVfXfBprAcMopmPrw&r=5t1r&triedRedirect=true&utm_medium=email" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>newsletter</u></a>
Friday that the full breadth of its winds upon landfall stretched over
450 miles across, nearly half the entire width of the Gulf of Mexico.
This means the effects of the storm began long before it officially made
landfall and will continue long after the eye of the storm has moved on.
</p>
<p>
Hours before Helene officially reached Florida, rain was already
drenching communities in the storm’s projected path. Meanwhile, “Severe
and life-threatening impacts from Helene will occur hundreds of miles
from the cone confines, especially on the eastern half of the storm,”
Florida meteorologist Ryan Truchelut wrote in the
<a href="https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/hurricane/2024/09/25/hurricane-helene-florida-forecast-catastrophic-storm-surge-flooding-rainfall/75378086007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>Tallahassee
Democrat</em></em></u></a>, summing up just how far-reaching Helene’s
effects could be. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
<a href="https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/communities-need-to-prepare-for-catastrophic-life-threatening-inland-flooding-from-helene-even-well" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>issued</u></a>
a self-described “rare news release” on Wednesday to warn of the
potential for major flooding as far inland as Appalachia, some 300 miles
from the Gulf Coast.

<p>
Another serious size-related consideration relates to the potential
<a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/stormsurge-stormtide.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>storm
surge</u></a>, or how far above average tides the water will rise. “When
you have a storm this big, you’re just inherently moving a lot of water
over a broader area,” Lanza said. As Hurricane Helene’s eye approached
Florida, water levels easily surpassed
<a href="https://x.com/ericfisher/status/1839481161082392823" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>multiple</u></a>
storm surge records. But what stood out to Lanza was not just that the
surge was powerful, it was also that the threat of surge was so
widespread. “A much smaller storm, you can still have a very large storm
surge, but it’s going to be very isolated near to where it comes
ashore,” he told me. “With a storm like Helene, because of its size,
near and east of where it comes ashore, you’re going to have a massive
storm surge — and you’re going to have a pretty big storm surge even
down the coast from that.” The NHC
<a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>warned</u></a>
that much of Florida’s Western coastline would see multiple feet of
water.
</p>
<p>
Messaging the risks of these storms to an extreme weather-weary public
is another challenge stemming from climate change. “Record breaking” has
now become a familiar phrase for most of us, describing everything from
extreme temperatures to rainfall rates. But as tropical storms become
more intense, fueled by warming-influenced weather conditions, finding
ways to accurately convey threats to the public is increasingly
essential.
</p>
<p>
Ahead of Helene’s landfall, the NHC stressed that the storm surge would
be “unsurvivable,” encouraging residents to heed evacuation orders.
According to
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/26/us/hurricane-helene-florida-big-bend-evacuation.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>The
New York Times</em></em></u></a>, the warnings — paired with memories of
those other recent storms — seemed to have worked, leaving Big Bend-area
towns “eerily empty.” Even the local Waffle House, a business widely
recognized for
<a href="https://www.wctv.tv/2024/09/26/crawfordville-waffle-house-location-closes-helene-barrels-toward-big-bend/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>making
its own assessments</u></a> of hurricane risk, was shuttered on
Thursday.
</p>
<p>
The NHC is experimenting with new graphics in hopes of better conveying
risks outside of the classic
“<a href="https://noaanhc.wordpress.com/2024/08/12/nhc-cone-heads-in-a-new-direction/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>cone
of uncertainty</u></a>,” which illustrates the predicted path of a
tropical storm’s eye. The center shared an image on social media showing
inland risks from storms, not just those along the coast.
</p>
<p>
So if you noticed the NHC’s risk map for Hurricane Helene colored the
entire state in a palette of watches and warnings, the reason why is
twofold: Yes, the risks really are that widespread with this storm, but
the agency is also trying to get better at telling you about them. And
in the case of major hurricane like Helene, the more warning, the
better.

id="in-meeting-with-zelenskyy-trump-promises-good-for-both-sides-deal-to-end-russias-war-in-ukraine">In
meeting with Zelenskyy, Trump promises ‘good for both sides’ deal to end
Russia’s war in Ukraine</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Former President Donald Trump met with Ukrainian
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in New York on Friday, promising that he
“can work out something that’s good for both sides” to end the
Russia-Ukraine war, if elected.  </p>
<p>In response to VOA’s question, the Republican presidential nominee
repeated his claim he will quickly end the fighting that began with
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.  </p>
<p>“We have a very good relationship, and I also have a very good
relationship, as you know, with [Russian] President [Vladimir] Putin.
And I think if we win, I think we’re going to get it resolved very
quickly.”   </p>
<p>It’s a significant meeting for Zelenskyy as he works for assurances
that Washington will continue to support his war efforts no matter who
wins in U.S. presidential election in November.     </p>
<p>“We have a common view that the war in Ukraine has to be stopped, and
Putin can’t win,” Zelenskyy said as he stood next to Trump.    </p>
<p>Trump has repeatedly said he wants the Russia-Ukraine war to end but
has not stated whether he wants Kyiv to win or keep all its territories.
    </p>
<p>“We’ll see what happens,” he said Thursday in response to a question
about whether Ukraine should turn over some of its own land to Russia to
end the war.     </p>
<p>Zelenskyy admitted he cannot win against Russia before the tightly
contested presidential election.   </p>
<p>“We understand that after November we have to decide, and we hope
that the friends of [the] United States will be very strong, and we
count on it,” he said. “That’s why I decided to meet with both
candidates, with all honor to them.”    </p>
<p>Trump is virtually tied in the polls with Vice President Kamala
Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee. Zelenskyy with Harris in
Washington on Thursday, following a separate meeting with President Joe
Biden.  </p>
<p>Unlike Trump, who is pushing for Kyiv to strike a deal with Moscow,
Harris underscored that it’s up to Ukraine to decide how the war will
end.       </p>
<p>“I will continue to stand with Ukraine, and I will work to ensure
Ukraine prevails in this war,” she vowed.     </p>
<p>Without mentioning names, Harris criticized Trump by denouncing calls
for Ukraine to end the war by ceding territory to Russia, focusing on a
proposal from Republican vice-presidential nominee JD Vance that would
mean Ukraine is left with less land and no path to an alliance with the
West.    </p>
<p>Vance suggested in a recent interview that Ukraine and Russia halt
fighting and create a demilitarized zone at the current battle lines.
Kyiv would need to adhere to a neutral status and stop its bid to join
NATO.    </p>
<p>“These proposals are the same as those of Putin, and let us be clear,
they are not proposals for peace,” Harris said. “Instead, they are
proposals for surrender, which is dangerous and unacceptable.”       
 </p>
<p>“It’s not a surrender,” Trump responded Thursday. “What my strategy
is, to save lives.”      </p>
<p>Tension between Trump and Zelenskyy   </p>
<p>Tension has been brewing between the two leaders. During a campaign
event in North Carolina on Wednesday, Trump slammed Zelenskyy for making
“little, nasty aspersions” toward him. He appeared to be referring to
Zelenskyy’s comments in a recent New Yorker magazine article that Trump
“doesn’t really know how to stop the war even if he might think he knows
how.”   </p>
<p>     </p>
<p> Trump suggested the Ukrainian leader together with the Biden
administration are at fault for prolonging the war that followed
Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.      </p>
<p>     </p>
<p>“Biden and Kamala allowed this to happen by feeding Zelenskyy money
and munitions like no country has ever seen before,” Trump said. He
argued that Kyiv should have made concessions to Moscow before Russian
troops attacked, asserting that Ukraine is now “in rubble” and in no
position to negotiate the war’s end.       </p>
<p>Zelenskyy, who has been in the United States since Sunday to attend
the United Nations General Assembly in New York, was scheduled to depart
Thursday but extended his visit as Trump announced the meeting.   </p>
<p>Trump complains of impeachment  </p>
<p>Trump spent a significant part of the open-to-press portion of his
Friday meeting with Zelenskyy complaining about his 2019 impeachment by
Democrats in Congress.    </p>
<p>The impeachment was triggered by a phone call he had with Zelenskyy
in July of that year in which Trump, who was president at the time,
asked the Ukrainian leader to start an investigation into Biden — then
his Democratic presidential rival — and his son Hunter Biden.  </p>
<p>“It was a hoax, just a Democrat hoax, which we won,” said Trump, who
was acquitted by the Republican-majority Senate at that time.    </p>
<p>Trump praised Zelenskyy for being “like a piece of steel” in
supporting his claim that he did nothing wrong during their phone call.
Zelenskyy did not respond to Trump’s remarks related to the impeachment.
 </p>
<p>Zelenskyy is also dealing with attacks from congressional Republicans
loyal to Trump demanding that the Ukrainian leader fire his ambassador
to the United States, Oksana Markarova, over Zelenskyy’s visit earlier
this week to an ammunition factory in Pennsylvania, a hotly contested
battleground state in the November U.S. presidential election. Zelenskyy
met with the Democratic governor of the state, Josh Shapiro.
        </p>
<p>In a letter to Zelenskyy, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson on
Wednesday said the visit to the factory that makes munitions for Ukraine
was a “partisan campaign event designed to help Democrats,” that amounts
to “election interference.”     </p>
<p>The White House called Johnson’s letter a “political stunt” and
pointed out that Zelenskyy recently met Republican Governor of Utah
Spencer Cox in a “similar event.”   </p>
<p>Ahead of Zelenskyy’s visit, the U.S. administration announced $8
billion in new aid for Ukraine. In a statement, Biden said the aid
includes a Patriot missile battery and missiles, as well as
air-to-ground munitions and a precision-guided glide bomb with a range
of up to 130 kilometers.          </p>
<p>The White House said no announcement is imminent regarding Ukraine’s
request for weapons donors to allow Ukrainian forces to use the weapons
to strike targets deeper inside Russia. </p>

EVs next year</u></a>. The 31-year GM veteran started her career as an
engineer.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
</p>
<p>
<strong>How bad was last night?</strong>
</p>
<p>
I was texting all night and into this morning, checking in on my staff
and whether they have power at their homes and whether we’re able to
operate our facilities. Unfortunately, these big storms are happening
more and more frequently and it’s getting harder for our grid to
reliably and consistently provide energy for all of the things we’re
trying to do. And this isn’t just a U.S. problem.
</p>
<p>
<strong>How worried are you about the idea that there’s a slowdown in EV
sales?</strong>
</p>
<p>
There’s no doubt that the acceleration has not happened as quickly as
was predicted. But that doesn’t mean that the EV segment isn’t growing.
It’s still a huge growth opportunity. We’ve got a lot of products
covering a lot of segments that weren’t available before, everything
from the affordable Equinox EV to full-size trucks with the Silverado
and a luxury vehicle with the Cadillac Lyric. And obviously the
supertruck Hummer.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Which new EV model do you think will do the best?</strong>
</p>
<p>
I have two favorites and I’ve driven them all. I actually was in the
Cadillac Lyric for quite a while, and it’s, by far, the best vehicle
I’ve ever driven, based on performance and luxury features. Just
absolutely loved the product.
</p>
<p>
And then the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/chevy-equinox-ev" target="_self"><u>Equinox
EV</u></a>. To get a family sized SUV that starts at $35,000 and you add
in the tax incentives, you’re talking under $30,000 for an EV for a
family. That’s a game changer, to be able to have something that’s
affordable. It’s a fantastic product with incredible range, great
performance, and all the features that you can imagine. These are the
things that will really open the doors for people that maybe couldn’t or
weren’t considering an EV in the past.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What else do you worry about?</strong>
</p>
<p>
I worry about the stability of our country’s infrastructure,
particularly the grid. We need to more reliably and consistently provide
energy for all of the things we’re trying to do to make the energy
transition a reality. And we have a long way to go.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What about a lack of EV charging infrastructure?</strong>
</p>
<p>
If you go on a long road trip and you drive through areas that don’t
have public EV charging stations, it’s a little unnerving. People need
to see more charging stations in their daily lives — like we’re used to
seeing a gas station on every corner. The more people that can see that
EV charging stations are readily available, even though they probably
will use one rarely, they just want to know it’s there. It gives that
sense of comfort that it’s available. And charging at home isn’t
feasible for everybody, particularly in urban areas. So it’s going to be
important to see that our customers see more charging infrastructure
when they are out and about.
</p>
<p>
<strong>How are you feeling about Plug-In Hybrids (PHEVs)?</strong>
</p>
<p>
As long as consumers have concerns over the charging infrastructure,
PHEVs are going to help bridge that gap for customers that either aren’t
ready or aren’t able to make the full transition to an EV. But from a
chief sustainability officer’s perspective, the only way we get to zero
is by charging with green energy. And so we want that transition to
happen as quickly as it possibly can.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What did GM learn from its Bolt experience and what do you
expect from the new Bolt due out in late 2025?</strong>
</p>
<p>
The Bolt was a terrific product. And the customer base was extremely
passionate, extremely loyal, and probably the highest customer
satisfaction score of some vehicles ever, not just at GM. So for the new
Bolt, we’re going to build on that equity and that passion that we’ve
had and do it as efficiently as possible.
</p>
<p>
We really needed to transition, and that’s what we’re doing. The new
Bolt EV will be on the new Ultium battery platform, and so it’ll be
profitable and an affordable EV. We heard a lot from Bolt customers and
that passion is certainly something that drives us.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Any advice for all the sustainability executives out here who
are having a hard time getting traction within their companies?</strong>
</p>
<p>
When I first got the phone call to take this role, my first question
was, why me? You know, I don’t have a sustainability background, I’m not
sure what I can contribute.
</p>
<p>
But in reality, knowing the business has been a huge advantage to be
able to communicate and understand all the challenges to being a chief
sustainability officer. I know how long it takes to put a product into
production. I know all of the things that an engineer needs to balance
around cost and quality and performance.
</p>
<p>
So I tell other CSOs to meet [their C-suite colleagues and stakeholders]
where they’re at. Talk to the CEO about how making the company more
sustainable means making the company more resilient and stronger for the
future, ensuring that we have a positive impact on the world. Educate
the CFO on how all this saves money. When you look at the things we’re
doing from an environmental or health and safety standpoint, they’re
just good for people. It’s about doing the right thing. So it doesn’t
even have to be a debate over climate change, right?
</p>
<p>
<strong>How does that dynamic work within GM?</strong>
</p>
<p>
Saving energy, saving water, those save costs. And there isn’t anybody
who disagrees with saving costs.
</p>
<p>
Now, there are some things that we may want to do today, but we just
can’t justify it. Some of our largest challenges are in our assembly
plants, around things like heating and cooling and with our paint ovens.
Even if we had the capital, or wanted to allocate the capital, to make
those transitions today to electric, it really doesn’t make sense in
every case, because natural gas is really cheap.
</p>
<p>
And so we need to focus instead on, how do we make what we do more
efficient? How do we use less resources? How do we continue to make our
manufacturing processes more efficient and make sure that we’re
allocating our resources, our capital, our investments in the places
that we can make the biggest impact today? And then prepare ourselves
for when this transition is more readily available.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What other companies do you admire for their work in
sustainability?</strong>
</p>
<p>
One of the things I love about this job is really the collaboration. The
CSO space is a very friendly space. We’re all trying to work on the same
issues, right? It’s a very unique situation where you all have the same
challenges, regardless of what your company does, and so it’s extremely
collaborative.
</p>
<p>
There are a lot of companies just doing incredible work in
sustainability. I’ve spent time recently with the CSO of
Colgate-Palmolive and one of their big wins this year was developing a
recyclable toothpaste tube. What’s really cool about their story is that
they made [their IP] available for everyone. We’ve also had
conversations with Nike and Lululemon around materials. It’s a good
opportunity for us to come up with solutions together. And we’re working
with the tech companies too, Google, Amazon, Microsoft.
</p>
<p>
Partnering with NGOs has also been helpful, working on everything from
how to purchase renewable energy, including virtual power plants, and
how you take advantage of all those EVs out there that can help generate
power for days like today when so many people have lost power.

id="as-ukraine-war-enters-a-critical-period-the-eu-moves-ahead-without-the-us">As
Ukraine war enters a critical period, the EU moves ahead without the
US</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BRUSSELS — s the war in Ukraine enters a critical period, the
European Union has decided that it must take responsibility for what it
sees as an existential threat to security in its own neighborhood and is
preparing to tackle some of the financial burden, perhaps even without
the United States.</p>
<p>EU envoys have been working in Brussels this week on a proposal to
provide Ukraine with a hefty loan package worth up to $39 billion. It
was announced by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen
during a trip to Kyiv last Friday.</p>
<p>“Crucially, this loan will flow straight into your national budget,”
she told President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. “It will provide you with
significant and much-needed fiscal space. You will decide how best to
use the funds, giving you maximum flexibility to meet your needs.”</p>
<p>Zelenskyy wants to buy weapons and bomb shelters and rebuild
Ukraine’s shattered energy network as winter draws near.</p>
<p>In international matters, particularly involving major conflicts, the
EU rarely moves ahead without the U.S., but it hopes this decision will
encourage others to come forward.</p>
<p>Russian troops and an election close in</p>
<p>Almost 1,000 days since their full-scale invasion, Russian forces are
making advances in the east. Ukraine’s army has a shaky hold on part of
the Kursk region in Russia, which has provided a temporary morale boost,
but as casualties mount it remains outmanned and outgunned.</p>
<p>On the political front, Zelenskyy hopes to secure support for a
“victory plan” that might force Russian President Vladimir Putin to the
negotiating table. He’s trying to persuade U.S. President Joe Biden and
other allies to help strengthen Ukraine’s hand in any future talks.</p>
<p>But a U.S. election looms, and polls suggest that Donald Trump might
return to the White House in January. Trump has been critical of U.S.
aid to Ukraine. On Wednesday, he said Zelenskyy should have made
concessions to Putin before the invasion began in February 2022.</p>
<p>Most of the 27-nation EU fears that a Putin victory would lead to
deep uncertainty. Russia’s armed forces are depleted and currently
incapable of another war, but the prospect of a future land grab in
Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania or Poland remains.</p>
<p>Reworking a G7 loan plan</p>
<p>The EU loans are part of a plan by the Group of Seven major
industrialized nations to take advantage of interest earned on about
$250 billion worth of frozen Russian assets, most of them held in
Europe. These windfall profits are estimated at around $5 billion to $6
billion a year.</p>
<p>The profits underpin the G7 plan. The EU would stump up $20 billion,
the U.S. $20 billion, and Canada, Japan and the U.K. $10 billion
together, for a combined total of $50 billion. The scheme expires at the
end of the year, before the next U.S. president takes office.</p>
<p>Now, amid differences over how long the Russian asset freeze should
be guaranteed, the EU has decided to go it alone. Its offer of up to $39
billion in loans accounts for almost the entirety of the U.S. share as
well.</p>
<p>The U.S. wants to ensure that the assets are locked away for at least
three years to guarantee the income. But EU member Hungary insists this
should only happen in 6-month increments. Hungarian Prime Minister
Viktor Orbán styles himself as a peacemaker and is too close to Putin
for many of his partners’ comfort.</p>
<p>The other 26 EU countries feel they must move now because time is
running out.</p>
<p>Evolving alliance with the United States</p>
<p>The U.S. election is just weeks away. The Europeans are wary of
Trump’s unpredictability and are testing scenarios to help protect
themselves from the kind of battering, like tariff hikes, their
economies received during his past presidency. But they also see the
Democrats as more inward looking these days.</p>
<p>Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act left European leaders fuming over
rules that favored American products. China and war in the Middle East
are the foreign policy priorities of Democrat or Republican candidates
alike, and for now the U.S. is in the grip of election campaign
fever.</p>
<p>The EU hopes that Vice President Kamala Harris, if she is elected
president, would enter the loan program as previously planned and reduce
the EU’s financial burden. But that remains an open question for now,
and EU members say Ukraine’s position is too precarious to hesitate.</p>
<p>Political delays in the U.S. Congress last year over a $60 billion
support package starved Ukrainian troops of weapons and ammunition for
months, resulting in “real consequences on the battlefield,” in the
words of NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg.</p>
<p>Pressing ahead on pressing needs</p>
<p>Helping Ukraine in military terms is a challenge for the Europeans.
They could not do it alone, and cannot match the U.S. transport,
logistics and equipment superiority, despite progress in ramping up
their defense industries to supply arms and ammunition.</p>
<p>But the world’s biggest trading bloc does wield economic might. It
has already given Ukraine about $132 billion since the full-scale
invasion started. Within weeks it appears ready to provide tens of
billions more, even though going it alone is not in the EU’s DNA.</p>
<p>“I do not know what the Americans, the United States with the new
presidency, will do or not,” EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said
on Tuesday. But, he said, “as long as the Ukrainians want to resist, we
have to support them. Otherwise, we will make a historical mistake.”</p>
<p>The Biden administration did announce Wednesday that the U.S. will
send Ukraine a major military aid package, including cluster bombs and
an array of rockets, artillery and armored vehicles. A U.S. official
also said billions of dollars more in assistance would arrive over the
coming months.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, deliberations on the EU’s share of the G7 loan package
will be high on the agenda of a summit of the bloc’s leaders in Brussels
on October 17-18.</p>

Helene is one of the largest storms on record to strike the Gulf Coast,
with its winds covering an area of about 420 miles. The storm’s size
means its effects will be felt in cities far north of the coast, even as
it weakens. As of Friday morning it had been downgraded to a tropical
storm. In Georgia, more than 900,000 are without power.

reiterated that she is not against fracking, and has called for
investing in “diverse sources of energy,” but hasn’t said much more on
the issue yet. President Biden paused approvals for new liquified
natural gas export terminals while the Energy Department studied their
climate effects, a move that angered the industry but pleased climate
activists who say the terminals lock in greenhouse gas pollution for
decades to come. A judge has since blocked the freeze, but new approvals
remain slow. Pennsylvania is a major natural gas producing state, and a
must-win battleground for the 2024 election. Republican candidate Donald
Trump has promised to lift the permitting freeze if elected in November.

that oil and gas operations account for around 15% of global
energy-related emissions. It calls for a 50% reduction in emissions
intensity for those operations by the end of the decade to align with a
planway toward net zero by 2050, and electrification is one step on that
path. But the IEA notes that “tackling methane emissions is the single
most important measure that contributes to the overall fall in emissions
from oil and gas operations.”

id="trump-and-zelenskyy-will-meet-as-tensions-rise-over-us-backing-for-ukraine">Trump
and Zelenskyy will meet as tensions rise over US backing for
Ukraine</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Donald Trump is set to meet with Ukrainian President
Volodymyr Zelenskyy as public tensions have been rising between the two
over Ukraine’s defense against Russia’s invasion. </p>
<p>Trump said Zelenskyy asked for the meeting. The visit is set for
about 9:45 a.m. Eastern Time at Trump Tower in New York, less than a day
after Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump’s Democratic opponent, met
with the Ukrainian leader and expressed unwavering support. </p>
<p>“I look forward to seeing him tomorrow,” Trump said in a press
conference Thursday. “I believe I will be able to make a deal between
President [Vladimir] Putin and President Zelenskyy, quite quickly.” </p>
<p>The meeting is highly anticipated and comes as Election Day nears,
with Trump and Harris taking sharply different positions on backing
Ukraine in the third year of its war with Russia. </p>
<p>Trump argues Putin would never have invaded had he been president
while derisively calling Zelenskyy a “salesman” for getting U.S.
assistance for Ukraine. Trump has in recent days praised Russia’s
historic military victories and insisted the U.S. needs “to get out” and
end its involvement with Ukraine. </p>
<p>Friday’s meeting almost wasn’t scheduled despite Zelenskyy’s office
saying something had been planned during the Ukrainian leader’s visit to
the U.N. General Assembly, during which he is making his endgame pitch
to allies. </p>
<p>In an interview with The New Yorker magazine that was published
earlier this week, Zelenskyy implied Trump does not understand and
oversimplifies the conflict. The Ukrainian leader said Trump’s running
mate JD Vance was “too radical” and had essentially advocated for
Ukraine to “make a sacrifice” by “giving up its territories.” </p>
<p>Trump ripped Zelenskyy and Ukraine on two separate occasions this
week. Speaking Wednesday in North Carolina, Trump referred to Ukraine as
“demolished” and its people as “dead.” </p>
<p>“Any deal — the worst deal — would’ve been better than what we have
now,” Trump said. “If they made a bad deal, it would’ve been much
better. They would’ve given up a little bit and everybody would be
living, and every building would be built and every tower would be aging
for another 2,000 years.” </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Harris on Thursday stood alongside Zelenskyy and said
Trump’s push for Ukraine to quickly cut a deal to end the war were “not
proposals for peace,” but “proposals for surrender.” Trump on Thursday
said he was not advocating for a surrender. </p>
<p>While Trump and Vance have long been skeptics of U.S. backing for
Ukraine, other Republican allies of the former president have backed
Kyiv’s defense against Moscow’s invasion and argue supporting Ukraine is
in America’s interest. </p>
<p>One ally of both Ukraine and Trump is Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. At
a closed-door meeting Zelenskyy had with senators on Capitol Hill, also
on Thursday, Graham stood up and said he had been talking to Trump about
the Ukrainian president, according to a person familiar with the
situation and granted anonymity to discuss the private meeting. </p>
<p>Graham told those in the room he would talk to Zelenskyy privately
about his conversations with Trump, the person said. As the meeting came
to a close, Graham pulled Zelenskyy aside and the two had a private
conversation. </p>
<p>Graham is close to the former president, despite an
on-again-off-again relationship, and has often played a role as an
intermediary on various subjects. He did not respond to a message
seeking comment Thursday.</p>

id="is-china-us-competition-driving-the-africa-proposal-in-the-un">Is
China-US competition driving the Africa proposal in the UN?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Johannesburg — This week at U.N. meetings in New York, the United
States said that two African countries should have permanent seats on
one of the world’s major decision-making bodies, the United Nations
Security Council.</p>
<p>For years, numerous African leaders have called for the continent to
have representation on the U.N. Security Council, which since World War
II has had just five permanent members: the U.S., France, the UK, Russia
and China.</p>
<p>This week, the top representative of one of those permanent seats,
U.S. President Joe Biden, threw his weight behind the idea. However,
there was one major caveat, which Kenyan analyst Cliff Mboya said is not
going over well on the continent. The new African members would not have
veto power on decisions.</p>
<p>“We’ve already seeing a lot of backlash… like this is a big joke, the
question is what is the point in joining the Security Council if you
don’t have veto powers, what are you going to do there?” asked
Mboya.</p>
<p>That could play in China’s favor, as it has long positioned itself as
a fellow developing country and leader of what’s become known as the
Global South, while disparaging the West for its colonial past, said
Mboya, a postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Africa-China Studies at
the University of Johannesburg.</p>
<p>“So I don’t think this helps the U.S. and the West in terms of
perception and narratives, and it will only embolden African countries
to lean more to the East because it just speaks to the hypocrisy,” he
said. “China’s been able to, you know, build this coalition of emerging
and developing countries against the U.S. and Western-led world
order.”</p>
<p>But Paul Nantulya, a research associate with the Africa Center for
Strategic Studies, said he thought the announcement was a “win’’ for
U.S. diplomacy and would mostly be welcomed by African nations as it
opens the door to further negotiations.</p>
<p>“Regarding China, China has been very, you know, kind of like sitting
on the fence. So rhetorically China has said all the right things,
supporting Africa’s, what it calls Africa’s legitimate interests in the
United Nations, including the United Nations Security Council,” he
said.</p>
<p>But its plan for that has been hazy, he added.</p>
<p>“When it comes to specific details, in terms of whether China
supports permanent African representation on the council with veto
power, when it comes to that China has not articulated a position.”</p>
<p>Among those in New York this week calling for U.N. reform was South
African President Cyril Ramaphosa. He said, quote: “Africa and its 1.4
billion people remain excluded from its key decision-making
structures.”</p>
<p>U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has also called for reform,
saying the UNSC hasn’t kept up with a changing world and Africa is
underrepresented.</p>
<p>Some African countries want veto power in the Security Council
dispensed with entirely.</p>
<p>If there is reform, and Africa gets the two seats on the Security
Council that the U.S. proposes, key contenders could include the
continent’s largest economy, South Africa; most populous country,
Nigeria; or North African heavyweight Egypt, Nantulya told VOA.</p>
<p>However, analysts say any future process of adding African countries
as permanent members is likely to face hurdles, as there will be
problems reaching consensus. Nantulya said some African politicians
think it could even drive a wedge between countries on the
continent.</p>
<p>There are also concerns the U.S. statement could just be rhetoric —
and so far no timeline has been given regarding the next steps. Under
U.N. rules, any change to Security Council membership would need
approval from two-thirds of the General Assembly, including all five
permanent members.</p>

to meet Chinese counterpart amid concerns over China’s drone supply to
Russia</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is scheduled to
meet with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Friday, on the sidelines
of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.</p>
<p>This meeting between the countries’ top diplomats comes amid growing
U.S. concerns over Chinese firms supplying chips and drones to Moscow,
which have significantly bolstered Russia’s battlefield capabilities in
its war against Ukraine.</p>
<p>Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell has told the Congress that
China’s material support for Russia’s war effort “comes from the very
top.”</p>
<p>Blinken’s talks with Wang will take place ahead of a call between
U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping, expected
later this fall.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told the
U.N. General Assembly that Ukraine would never accept a deal imposed by
other nations to end Russia’s 31-month invasion, questioning the motives
of China and Brazil in pushing for negotiations with Moscow.</p>
<p>For months, U.S. officials have accused China of actively aiding
Russia’s war effort. Washington has sanctioned Chinese firms providing
crucial components to Russia’s defense industry.</p>
<p>State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller recently told VOA that
the U.S. openly discusses its “differences” with China to ensure that
both countries “at least understand where the other is coming from, even
if we can’t reach an agreement.”</p>
<p>He added that Washington is managing its relationship with China to
prevent it from “veering from competition into conflict.”</p>
