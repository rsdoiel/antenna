## US now allows passport renewals online

date: 2024-09-18, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Americans can now renew their passports online, bypassing a cumbersome mail-in paper application process that often caused delays.


The U.S. State Department announced Wednesday that its online passport renewal system is now fully operational.


"By offering this online alternative to the traditional paper application process, the Department is embracing digital transformation to offer the most efficient and convenient passport renewal experience possible," Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement.


After staffing shortages caused mainly by the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in lengthy passport processing delays, the department ramped up hiring and introduced other technological improvements that have reduced wait times by about one-third over last year. It says most applications are now completed in far less than the advertised six to eight weeks. The online renewal system is expected to further reduce that.


The system will allow renewal applicants to skip the current process, which requires them to print out and send paper applications and a check by mail and submit their documents and payment through a secure website, www.Travel.State.Gov/renewonline.

## Reinventing the Clock: NASA’s New Tech for Space Timekeeping

date: 2024-09-18, from: NASA breaking news

Here on Earth, it might not matter if your wristwatch runs a few seconds slow. But crucial spacecraft functions need accuracy down to one billionth of a second or less. Navigating with GPS, for example, relies on precise timing signals from satellites to pinpoint locations. Three teams at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, are at work to push timekeeping for space exploration to new levels of precision.

<p>Today, the Federal Reserve will announce what it will do with the interest rates that steer the economy. It&#8217;ll cut them — that&#8217;s almost certain, but the question is how aggressively.

## Intel to spin off its chipmaking business

date: 2024-09-18, from: OS News

Intel&#8217;s woes are far from over. Pat Gelsinger, the company&#8217;s CEO, has announced that Intel&#8217;s chipmaking business will be spun off and turned into a separate company. A subsidiary structure will unlock important benefits. It provides our external foundry customers and suppliers with clearer separation and independence from the rest of Intel. Importantly, it also gives us future flexibility to evaluate independent sources of funding and optimize the capital structure of each business to maximize growth and shareholder value creation. There is no change to our Intel Foundry leadership team, which continues to report to me. We will also establish an operating board that includes independent directors to govern the subsidiary. This supports our continued focus on driving greater transparency, optimization and accountability across the business. ↫ Pat Gelsinger This is a big move, and illustrated the difficulties Intel is facing. Its foundry business lost $7 billion last year, and it&#8217;s cutting 15% of its workforce &#8211; 15000 people &#8211; indicating it needs to do something to turn the ship around. Intel is also pausing construction on two additional plants in Europe, but will continue its expansion efforts in the United States. Bitter note is that Intel received a massive cash injection from the US Biden administration, yet then proceeds to fire 15000 people. Socialism for the rich, capitalism for the poor.

## Google wins challenge against $1.66B EU antitrust fine

date: 2024-09-18, from: VOA News USA

BRUSSELS — Alphabet unit Google won its challenge on Wednesday against a $1.66 billion antitrust fine imposed five years ago for hindering rivals in online search advertising, a week after it lost a much bigger case. 


The European Commission, in its 2019 decision, said Google had abused its dominance to prevent websites from using brokers other than its AdSense platform that provided search adverts. The practices it said were illegal took place from 2006 to 2016.


The Luxembourg-based General Court mostly agreed with the European Union competition enforcer's assessments of the case, but annulled the fine.


"The court [...] upheld most of the commission's assessments, but annulled the decision imposing a fine of almost 1.5 billion euros [$1.66 billion] on Google, on the grounds in particular that it had failed to take into account all the relevant circumstances in its assessment of the duration of the contractual clauses that it had found to be unfair," the judges said.


The AdSense fine, one of a trio of fines that have cost Google a total of some $9 billion, was triggered by a complaint from Microsoft in 2010.


Google has said it changed the targeted contracts in 2016 before the Commission's decision.


The company last week lost its final fight against a $2.6 billion fine levied for using its price comparison shopping service to gain an unfair advantage over smaller European rivals.

## Why Geothermal Is So Hot Right Now

	Geothermal is getting closer to the big time. Last week, Fervo Energy — arguably the country’s leading enhanced geothermal company — 
	<a href="https://fervoenergy.com/fervo-energys-record-breaking-production-results-showcase-rapid-scale-up-of-enhanced-geothermal/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>announced</u></a> that its Utah demonstration project had achieved record production capacity. The new approach termed “enhanced geothermal,” which borrows drilling techniques and expertise from the oil and gas industry, seems poised to become a big player on America’s clean, 24/7 power grid of the future.

Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p><blockquote>
<strong>Robinson Meyer:</strong> I just wanted to hit a different note here, which is, Sarah, you’ve alluded a few times to your past in the oil and gas industry. I think this is true across Fervo, is that of course, the technologies we’re discussing here are fracking derived. What has your background in the oil and gas industry and hydrocarbons taught you that you think about at Fervo now, and developing geothermal as a resource?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Sarah Jewett:</strong> There are so many things. I mean, I’m thinking about my time in the oil and gas industry daily. And you’re exactly right, I think today about 60% of Fervo’s employees come from the oil and gas industry. And because we are only just about to start construction on our first power facility, the percentage of contractors and field workers from the oil and gas industry is much higher than 60%.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Jesse Jenkins: </strong>Right, you can’t go and hire a bunch of people with geothermal experience when there is no large-scale geothermal industry to pull from.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Jewett: </strong>That’s right. That’s right. And so the oil and gas industry, I think, has taught us, so many different types of things. I mean, we can’t really exist without thinking about the history of the oil and gas industry — even, you know, Wilson and I are sort of comparing our learning rates to learning rates observed in various different oil and gas basins by different operators, so you can see a lot of prior technological pathways.<br/>
<br/>
	I mean, first off, we’re just using off the shelf technology that has been proven and tested in the oil and gas industry over the last 25 years, which has been, really, the reason why geothermal is able to have this big new unlock, because we’re using all of this off the shelf technology that now exists. It’s not like the early 2000s, where there was a single bit we could have tried. Now there are a ton of different bits that are available to us that we can try and say, how is this working? How is <em><em>this</em></em> working? How’s this working?<br/>
<br/>
	So I think, from a technological perspective, it’s helpful. And then from just an industry that has set a solid example it’s been really helpful, and that can be leveraged in a number of different ways. Learning rates, for example; how to set up supply chains in remote areas, for example; how to engage with and interact with communities. I think we’ve seen examples of oil and gas doing that well and doing it poorly. And I’ve gotten to observe firsthand the oil and gas industry doing it well and doing it poorly.<br/>
<br/>
	And so I’ve gotten to learn a lot about how we need to treat those around us, explain to them what it is that we’re doing, how open we need to be. And I think that has been immensely helpful as we’ve crafted the role that we’re going to play in these communities at large.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Wilson Ricks: </strong>I think it’s also interesting to talk about the connection to the oil and gas industry from the perspective of the political economy of the energy transition, specifically because you hear policymakers talk all the time about retraining workers from these legacy industries that, if we’re serious about decarbonizing, will unavoidably have to contract — and, you know, getting those people involved in clean energy, in these new industries.<br/>
<br/>
	And often that’s taking drillers and retraining some kind of very different job — or coal miners — into battery manufacturers. This is almost exactly one to one. Like Sarah said, there’s additional expertise and experience that you need to get really good at doing this in the geothermal context. But for the most part, you are taking the exact same skills and just reapplying them, and so it allows for both a potentially very smooth transition of workforces, and also it allows for scale-up of enhanced geothermal to proceed much more smoothly than it potentially would if you had to kind of train an entire workforce from scratch to just do this.</blockquote><div class="horizontal-rule"></div><p>This episode of Shift Key is sponsored by …</p><p><strong>Watershed</strong>’s climate data engine helps companies measure and reduce their emissions, turning the data they already have into an audit-ready carbon footprint backed by the latest climate science.

## To Strike Fear Into Napoleon's Occupying Army, These Retreating Soldiers Burned Down Their Own City

## Iconic US container firm Tupperware files for bankruptcy

date: 2024-09-18, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Tupperware Brands and some of its subsidiaries filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Tuesday, the food container firm said in a statement.


The company, known for its trademark food storage containers, has been hit by dwindling sales in recent years.


Last year the New York Stock Exchange-listed firm warned of "substantial doubt" about its ability to keep operating in light of its poor financial position.


"Over the last several years, the company's financial position has been severely impacted by the challenging macroeconomic environment," president and CEO Laurie Ann Goldman said in a statement announcing the bankruptcy filing.


"As a result, we explored numerous strategic options and determined this is the best path forward," added Goldman.


The company said it would seek court approval for a sale process for the business to protect its brand and "further advance Tupperware's transformation into a digital-first, technology-led company."


The Orlando, Florida-based firm said it would also seek approval to continue operating during bankruptcy proceedings and would continue to pay its employees and suppliers.


"We plan to continue serving our valued customers with the high-quality products they love and trust throughout this process," Goldman said.


The firm's shares were trading at $0.5099 Monday, well down from $2.55 in December last year.


Tupperware said it had implemented a strategic plan to modernize its operations and drive efficiencies to ignite growth following the appointment of a new management team last year.


"The company has made significant progress and intends to continue this important transformation work."


In its filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, Tupperware listed assets of between $500 million and $1 billion and liabilities of between $1 billion and $10 billion.


The filing also said it had between 50,000 and 100,000 creditors.


Tupperware, whose name became synonymous with its airtight plastic containers, in recent years lost popularity with consumers and an initiative to gain distribution through big-box chain store Target failed to reverse its fortunes.


The company's roots date to 1946, when chemist Earl Tupper "had a spark of inspiration while creating molds at a plastics factory shortly after the Great Depression," according to Tupperware's website.


"If he could design an airtight seal for plastic storage containers, like those on a paint can, he could help war-weary families save money on costly food waste."


Over time, Tupper's hermetically sealed plastic containers also became associated with "Tupperware Parties," where friends would gather with food and drink as a company representative demonstrated the items.

## US decision on Nippon bid for US Steel pushed to after election, sources say

date: 2024-09-18, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON/TOKYO — The U.S. national security panel reviewing Nippon Steel's $14.9 billion bid for U.S. Steel let the companies refile their application for approval of the deal, a person familiar with the matter said, delaying a decision on the politically sensitive merger until after the Nov. 5 presidential election.


The move offers a ray of hope for the companies, whose proposed tie-up appeared set to be blocked when the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) alleged on Aug. 31 the transaction posed a risk to national security by threatening the steel supply chain for critical U.S. industries.


CFIUS needs more time to understand the deal's impact on national security and engage with the parties, the person said on Tuesday. Refiling sets a new 90-day clock to review the proposed tie-up and make a decision.


The review was expected to take close to the full 90 days, another person familiar with the matter said.


Nippon Steel declined to comment. CFIUS and U.S. Steel did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Reuters.


"Extending the timeline takes pressure off the parties and, importantly, pushes the decision past the election in November," said Nick Klein, a CFIUS lawyer with DLA Piper.


The deal has become a political hot potato. This month, Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, said at a rally in Pennsylvania, the swing state where U.S. Steel is headquartered, that she wants U.S. Steel to remain "American owned and operated," echoing a view held by President Joe Biden.


The White House reiterated that position on Tuesday.


Harris' Republican rival Donald Trump has pledged to block the deal if elected. Both candidates have sought to woo union votes.


Postponing the decision to after the U.S. elections will “dial down” the political temperature but does not guarantee approval, said David Boling, a former U.S. trade official who is now an analyst at Eurasia Group.


"Regardless of the CFIUS review, Nippon Steel still must reach an agreement with the United Steelworkers," Boling said. "Without that, it's very hard to see this deal happening."


The United Steelworkers Union, which vehemently opposes the deal, said on Tuesday "nothing has changed regarding the risks that Nippon's acquisition would pose to national security or the critical supply chain concerns that have already been identified."


The deal is being closely watched in Japan, a close U.S. ally and its biggest foreign investor.


"Further strengthening economic relations, including expanding mutual investment between Japan and the U.S., are essential for both countries," Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Moriya told reporters on Wednesday.


Nippon Steel shares were up 1.1% in afternoon trading in Tokyo. U.S. Steel shares closed down 0.4% on Tuesday.


CFIUS is concerned Nippon Steel's merger could hurt the supply of steel needed for critical transportation, construction and agriculture projects, it said in its August letter to the companies, exclusively obtained by Reuters.


It also cited a global glut of cheap Chinese steel, and said that under Nippon, a Japanese company, U.S. Steel would be less likely to seek tariffs on foreign steel importers. It added that decisions by Nippon could "lead to a reduction in domestic steel production capacity."


In a 100-page response letter to CFIUS, also exclusively obtained by Reuters, Nippon Steel said it will invest billions of dollars in U.S. Steel facilities that otherwise would have been idled, "indisputably" allowing it to "maintain and potentially increase domestic steelmaking capacity in the United States."


The company also reaffirmed a promise not to transfer any U.S. Steel production capacity or jobs outside the U.S. and would not interfere in any of U.S. Steel's decisions on trade matters, including decisions to pursue trade measures under U.S. law against unfair trade practices.


The deal, Nippon added, would "create a stronger global competitor to China grounded in the close relationship between the United States and Japan."


Robust CFIUS reviews take 90 days but it is common for companies to withdraw their filings and resubmit them to give them more time to address the panel's concerns.


According to CFIUS's 2023 annual report, 18% of companies seeking deal approval refiled their applications last year. Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel filed for the review in March, and CFIUS allowed them to refile in June, starting a second 90-day clock that runs out on Sept. 23, Reuters reported on Friday.


In December, CFIUS could approve the deal, possibly with measures to address national security concerns, recommend that the president block it, or extend the timetable again.

## US Air Force general: Russia military larger, better than before Ukraine invasion

date: 2024-09-18, from: VOA News USA

PENTAGON — Russia's military is bigger and stronger than it was prior to invading Ukraine in February 2022, the commander of United States Air Forces in Europe and Africa cautioned Tuesday.


"Russia is getting larger, and they're getting better than they were before. … They are actually larger than they were when [the invasion] kicked off," Air Force General James Hecker told reporters at the Air & Space Forces Association's annual Air, Space & Cyber Conference.


The improvements come despite heavy casualties inflicted by Ukraine. U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin has estimated that since 2022, more than 350,000 Russian troops have been killed or wounded.


"The rates of casualties that they're experiencing are staggering," Pentagon press secretary Major General Pat Ryder told reporters Tuesday in response to a question from VOA.


On Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered that the Russian army grow by 180,000 active-duty troops for a total of 1.5 million soldiers, making Russia's military the second largest in the world, behind China's.


"Russia is going to be something that we're going to have to deal with for a long time, no matter how this thing ends," Hecker said.


However, William Pomeranz, a senior scholar at the Kennan Institute, told VOA that "this move suggests that Vladimir Putin is losing the war."


"This is an open signal from Vladimir Putin that his army and his military is in trouble and doesn't have the resources to maintain troops in the field," Pomeranz said.


Despite Russian improvements on the battlefield, Ukraine has continued to put chinks in Russia's armor, shooting down more than 100 Russian aircraft since Moscow began its full-scale invasion, which amounts to dozens more aircraft than Russia has been able to down on the Ukrainian side, according to General Hecker.


"So what we see is the aircraft are kind of staying on their own side of the line, if you will, and when that happens, you have a war like we're seeing today, with massive attrition, cities just being demolished, a lot of civilian casualties," he said.


To gain even the slightest advantages in a war where no clear side dominates the skies, Ukraine has turned to low-cost solutions that also appeal to the U.S. military.


"We have to get on the right side of the cost curve with this. Taking down $10,000, $15,000, $20,000 one-way UAVs [drones] with $1 million missiles, we just can't afford to do that in the long-term," the general told reporters. 


General Chance Saltzman, the chief of the U.S. Space Force, announced Tuesday that a Space Force pilot program that uses commercial satellite imagery and related analytics to create more situational awareness for military leaders has proven very cost-effective when compared with traditional intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance collection via U.S. MQ-9 drones, which are expensive and limited in number.


AFRICOM was able to use the $40 million Tactical Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Tracking Program to maintain situational awareness during the full withdrawal of U.S. forces from two air bases in Niger in July and August. The drawback, however, was that instead of real-time situational awareness, the data took one to four hours to get to the security team.


"Not as good as real time, right? With MQ-9 that you would have, but it's better than nothing, right?" Hecker said.


Hecker also said the U.S. was looking into more cost-effective ways to sense incoming threats around bases, including methods like Ukraine's Sky Fortress system that uses thousands of inexpensive sensors to identify aerial threats. He says the technology has been demonstrated in Romania and other countries.

## China’s influence campaign intensifies as US election nears

date: 2024-09-18, from: VOA News USA

washington — At first glance, Noah R. Smith might seem like your typical social media user. His bio says he’s a father, a former “Track and Field representative,” and a current member of the PanAm Sports organization.


On July 14, a day after the first assassination attempt on Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, Smith shared three posts from an account named “TRUMP WON.”




One post declared, “AMERICA was attacked today … we must get it together. It’s literally a matter of life and death,” accompanied by an image depicting a divine hand halting a bullet aimed at Trump.


Another post urged “all MAGA GOD Fearing Patriots” to connect, stating, “Grow These Accounts, UNITED We Are Strong.”


While it might seem that Smith is a devoted Trump supporter, closer inspection suggests otherwise. His cover photo features Chinese watermarks, his profile picture is sourced from a company that provides photos, videos and music, and his bio is lifted from an authentic account named Laurel R. Smith.


In reality, Noah R. Smith is impersonating a U.S. voter who supports Trump. A joint investigation by VOA Mandarin and Doublethink Lab (DTL), a Taiwanese social media analytics firm, uncovered 10 such accounts on X.


These accounts are linked to China’s Spamouflage network — a state-sponsored operation aimed at supporting the Chinese government and undermining its critics. This network was first identified by social media analytics company Graphika in 2019 and was used to target Hong Kong pro-democracy protesters at that time.


Following the assassination attempt on July 14, the accounts began promoting pro-Trump content. Previously, they shared material consistent with Spamouflage’s broader interests: defending China, criticizing U.S. foreign policy, and exploiting divisive domestic issues such as gun violence and racial tensions.


DTL labeled this network of accounts posing as Americans “MAGAflage 1,” because they all seem to be promoting Trump’s slogan “Make America Great Again [MAGA].”


“The MAGAflage accounts are different because they are not just criticizing stuff. They are amplifying positive content about Trump,” Jasper Hewitt, a digital intelligence analyst at Doublethink Lab, told VOA Mandarin.


He added that it’s too early to draw conclusions about whom China is supporting, as researchers are still tracking accounts that criticize both Republican candidate Donald Trump and Democratic candidate Kamala Harris.


“Engaging with the MAGA movement, or any part of the political spectrum, might merely be a new attempt to generate authentic traffic,” Hewitt told VOA.


The first MAGAflage network was discovered by Elise Thomas, a senior analyst at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, in April 2024. This network focuses on promoting positive content of Trump. She told VOA earlier that by wrapping a topic in a U.S. partisan political frame, these accounts got “a reasonable amount of engagement from real American users.”




Limited influence 


The VOA Mandarin investigation revealed that the accounts operate in coordination. Six out of the 10 accounts were created in 2015 but had their first visible posts on May 18 or May 19, 2022.


The batch accounts — the 10 new accounts — are not very active. Each account has roughly 100 posts or reposts over the last two years. The batch accounts were inactive for one year but were awoken after the first Trump assassination attempt.


Additionally, these accounts occasionally post or repost Chinese content.


For example, an account named Super-Rabbit shared praise for China's political and economic model from state-linked influencers like Shanghai Panda and Xinhua News Agency’s reporter Li Zexin. One post from September 3 contrasted U.S. President Joe Biden’s inactivity with China’s President Xi Jinping’s engagement in Africa.


“When Joe Biden is sitting on the beach wasted away, China’s President Xi is shaking hands with various African leaders and making a better impact in Africa,” the post said.




VOA contacted the Trump and Harris campaigns for comment but did not receive a response as of publication time.


Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, told VOA in a statement that “China has no intention and will not interfere in the U.S. election, and we hope that the U.S. side will not make an issue of China in the election.”


So far, the newly discovered MAGAflage 1 accounts have had limited influence, with only a handful of followers and minimal interactions.


U.S. intelligence agencies issued their latest assessment earlier this month, warning that Russia, Iran, and China are intensifying efforts to influence the U.S. presidential election.


While Russia remains the primary concern, officials noted that Chinese online influence actors have “continued small scale efforts on social media to engage U.S. audiences on divisive political issues, including protests about the Israel-Gaza conflict and promote negative stories about both political parties.”

## Senate Republicans again block legislation to guarantee rights to IVF

date: 2024-09-18, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Republicans have blocked for a second time this year legislation to establish a nationwide right to in vitro fertilization, arguing that the vote is an election-year stunt after Democrats forced a vote on the issue.


The Senate vote was Democrats' latest attempt to force Republicans into a defensive stance on women's health issues and highlight policy differences between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump in the presidential race, especially as Trump has called himself a "leader on IVF."


The 51-44 vote was short of the 60 votes needed to move forward on the bill, with only two Republicans voting in favor. Democrats say Republicans who insist they support IVF are being hypocritical because they won't support legislation guaranteeing a right to it.


"They say they support IVF — here you go, vote on this," said Illinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth, the bill's lead sponsor and a military veteran who has used the fertility treatment to have her two children.


The Democratic push started earlier this year after the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos can be considered children under state law. Several clinics in the state suspended IVF treatments until the GOP-led legislature rushed to enact a law to provide legal protections for the clinics.


Democrats quickly capitalized, holding a vote in June on Duckworth's bill and warning that the U.S. Supreme Court could go after the procedure after it overturned the right to an abortion in 2022.


The bill would establish a nationwide right for patients to access IVF and other assisted reproductive technologies and a right for doctors and insurance companies to provide it, an effort to pre-empt state efforts to limit the services. It would also require more health insurers to cover it and expand coverage for military service members and veterans.


In a statement after the vote, Harris said Republicans in Congress "have once again made clear that they will not protect access to the fertility treatments many couples need to fulfill their dream of having a child."


Republican vice presidential candidate and Ohio Sen. JD Vance, who missed the vote because he was campaigning, said during a stop in Wisconsin that the measure was not a serious IVF bill, but a measure designed to make Republicans look bad.


"The Senate blocked a ridiculous showboat bill that had no chance of passing," Vance said.


Republicans argued that the federal government shouldn't tell states what to do and that the bill was an unserious effort. Only Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska voted with Democrats to move forward on the bill both times.


South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the No. 2 Senate Republican, said that Democrats are trying to create a political issue "where there isn't one."


"Let me remind everybody that Republicans support IVF, full stop," Thune said just before the vote.

## US lawmakers welcome Russian activist freed in August prisoner swap

date: 2024-09-18, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — U.S. lawmakers welcomed Vladimir Kara-Murza to Capitol Hill Tuesday, celebrating the release of the Russian activist from a Kremlin prison last month. 


Kara-Murza was part of the biggest prisoner exchange between the U.S. and Russia since the end of the Cold War. 

 

Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Ben Cardin said Tuesday that Kara-Murza "was at the forefront of the human rights struggle and an inspiration for so many people around the world." 

 

In a letter written upon Kara-Murza's release, Cardin said, "Your return home is both a personal victory and a testament to the unwavering strength of the human spirit." 

 

Democratic Representative Bill Keating described Kara-Murza as one of the people Russian President Vladimir Putin most despises because of his ability to speak directly to the Russian people. Kara-Murza has twice survived suspected poisoning attempts. 

 

Kara-Murza, a deputy leader of the People's Freedom Party, was arrested in Russia in April 2022 and later faced charges of treason and spreading disinformation about the Russian military. Russian prosecutors suggested he face the maximum 25-year sentence in a prison colony. 

 

Kara-Murza was awarded the Václav Havel Human Rights Prize by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in October 2022 and the Pulitzer Prize for commentary in 2024. 

 

"Surreal doesn't come close to describing what I feel — just a few weeks ago sitting in a maximum-security prison in Siberia and now seeing so many friends in the halls of the U.S. Congress," Kara-Murza told a gathering of lawmakers, journalists and activists on Capitol Hill. 

 

Kara-Murza thanked the public for keeping their attention focused on his situation.


"The only way we will be able to achieve long-term peace, stability, security and democracy on the European continent will be with a peaceful, free and democratic Russia," he said.


The Biden administration secured the release of 16 detainees in return for the release of eight detainees and two minors on Aug. 1.


James O'Brien, assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, thanked Kara-Murza for his work on the Global Magnitsky Act, bipartisan legislation that authorizes the U.S. government to sanction government officials throughout the world who are human rights offenders.


"Vladimir, you gave us one of the main tools that we use to focus our advocacy for your freedom in the Global Magnitsky Act, and your work on that, I'm sure you didn't do it as a tool for yourself, but your work on that has helped us enormously as we work to free prisoners in the Western Hemisphere, in other countries across the world," O'Brien said.


Democratic Senator Chris Coons said Putin is still holding untold numbers of political prisoners in Russia.


"We must realize [Putin] does that, like all authoritarians, because he's afraid, afraid of his own people, afraid of accountability, afraid of the Ukrainians who just on the border of Russia are fighting with determination," Coons said.

## Experts say voters should feel confident in US elections this year

date: 2024-09-18, from: VOA News USA

washington — American voters face a challenging duality as they count down the days until November's presidential election: a security landscape that officials say has become ever more dangerous even as the infrastructure to hold elections has become ever-more secure. 


The run-up to the 2024 election has seen the "most complex threat landscape yet," according to Cait Conley, a senior adviser at the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the government body responsible for overseeing election security. 


"We do see a growing and diverse array of foreign adversaries, foreign actors, trying to disrupt our elections," Conley said Tuesday, speaking at Politico's AI and Tech Summit in Washington.  


But U.S. voters should feel confident, she added. 


"We have been surging resources," Conley said. "We have seen tremendous investment and progress in ensuring the full spectrum of security and resilience of our election infrastructure." 


Nevertheless, Conley and other U.S. officials acknowledge the dangers are widespread, often extending beyond the voting booth. 


Physical threats 


The FBI and U.S. Postal Service said Tuesday they are investigating suspicious packages sent to election workers in at least 12 states. 


CISA officials have reported a growing number of swatting incidents — false reports to emergency services about violence or an emergency at a home or other location — targeting election workers. 


And the number of direct threats is rising rapidly. 


"We are seeing an unprecedented and extremely disturbing level of threats of violence, and violence, against public officials," said U.S. Deputy General Lisa Monaco, also speaking at the summit in Washington.  


"For sure weekly and, sometimes, daily," Monaco said of the frequency of the threats. 


Many of the threats target officials responsible for conducting elections. 


"These are people who are simply volunteering their time to help all of us undertake the most fundamental right," she said. "These are people who are being threatened simply for doing their job." 


Officials also warn that other public servants are getting a growing number of threats, including law enforcement officers, prosecutors and elected officials and candidates. 


"It's serious," said Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, citing Sunday's apparent assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump as he played golf at his course in West Palm Beach, Florida. 


He also pointed to the rash of threats in Springfield, Ohio, following the spread of unsubstantiated rumors about Haitian immigrants eating pets.




"We are in a heightened threat environment … a threat environment that is of deep concern," Mayorkas said. "It requires vigilance at every level of government and frankly on every block of each community across this country." 


Concerns about the heightened threat environment are not new. 


Homeland Security officials have been warning of the dangers since at least January 2021, saying lone offenders or small groups could be motivated to carry out attacks motivated by a range of political and personal grievances.




Only now, high emotions over the election combined with efforts by U.S. adversaries are fueling discontent and anger that could lead to more attacks. 


Cyber operations 


"When it comes to malign influence campaigns, we are seeing a very aggressive set of actors," Monaco said. 


Many of the efforts to sow discord have originated in Russia and Iran, and to a lesser extent China.  But they are far from alone. 




"We're seeing more actors in this space acting more aggressively in a more polarized environment and doing more with technologies, in particular AI," Monaco said.  


Earlier this month, the U.S. Justice Department took action against what it said were two Russian plots to spread disinformation, taking down 32 fake news websites while bringing charges against two employees of Russia-backed media outlet RT, accusing them of funneling nearly $10 million to a U.S. company to promote material favorable to the Russian government. 




And last week, the U.S. State Department accused a number of Russian media companies, including RT, of working directly for Russia's intelligence agencies – charges Russia and RT denied. 




US preparations 


The best defense, Monaco said, is for U.S. voters to be careful about where they get their information. 


"We have to be very vigilant on what we are consuming," she said. 


Experts like Margaret Talev, who directs the Syracuse University Institute for Democracy, Journalism and Citizenship in Washington, agree. 


Voters should "take a pause. Take a minute," Talev told VOA. "It involves all of us teaching ourselves, taking our time and trying to verify information from multiple sources rather than just believing the first thing that we see." 


The National Association of Secretaries of State (NASS), whose members play key roles in running elections, has also sought to make getting verified information easier, pushing a social media campaign it calls #TrustedInfo2024. 


NASS says its goal is "to promote election officials as the trusted sources of election information during the 2024 election cycle and beyond." 


And CISA, the cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency, has been working with election officials across the country to make sure they are ready for almost any contingency. 




CISA officials have also tried to rein in the hype about the dangers of AI, or artificial intelligence, blamed for helping U.S. adversaries to spread disinformation more effectively. 


"Generative AI is not going to fundamentally introduce new threats to this election cycle," the agency's Conley told VOA earlier this month.




While AI is exacerbating existing threats, so far it has not produced anything elections officials have not already seen. 


"This threat vector is not new to them," Conley said. "And they have taken the measures to ensure they're prepared to respond effectively."

## What Does OpenAI’s New Breakthrough Mean for Energy Consumption?

date: 2024-09-17, from: Heatmap News

The company said these models perform better than their existing ones on some tasks, especially related to math and science. “This is a significant advancement and represents a new level of AI capability,” the company said.</p><p>But is it also a significant advancement in energy usage? </p><p>In the short run at least, almost certainly, as spending more time “thinking” and generating more text will require more computing power. As Erik Johannes Husom, a researcher at SINTEF Digital, a Norwegian research organization, told me, “It looks like we’re going to get another acceleration of generative AI’s carbon footprint.”</p><p>Discussion of energy use and large language models has been dominated by the gargantuan requirements for “training,” essentially running a massive set of equations through a corpus of text from the internet. This requires hardware on the scale of tens of thousands of graphical processing units and <a href="https://www.ri.se/en/news/blog/generative-ai-does-not-run-on-thin-air" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>an estimated 50 gigawatt-hours of electricity to run</u></a>. </p><p>Training GPT-4 cost “more than” $100 million OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/openai-ceo-sam-altman-the-age-of-giant-ai-models-is-already-over/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has said</u></a>; the next generation models will likely <a href="https://time.com/6984292/cost-artificial-intelligence-compute-epoch-report/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>cost around $1 billion</u></a>, according to Anthropic chief executive Dario Amodei, a figure that might balloon to $100 billion for further generation models, according to Oracle founder Larry Ellison.</p><p>While a huge portion of these costs are hardware, the energy consumption is considerable as well. (Meta reported that when training its Llama 3 models, power would sometimes <em><em>fluctuate</em></em> by “tens of megawatts,” <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21783" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>enough to power thousands of homes</u></a>). It’s no wonder that OpenAI’s chief executive Sam Altman <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-18/sam-altman-s-helion-energy-promises-fusion-power-by-2028" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has put hundreds of millions of dollars into a fusion company</u></a>.</p><p>But the models are not simply trained, they're used out in the world, generating outputs (think of what ChatGPT spits back at you). This process tends to be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24066646/ai-electricity-energy-watts-generative-consumption" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>comparable to other common activities like streaming Netflix or using a lightbulb</u></a>. This can be done with different hardware and the process is more distributed and less energy intensive.</p><p>As large language models are being developed, most computational power — and therefore most electricity — is used on training, Charlie Snell, a PhD student at University of California at Berkeley who studies artificial intelligence, told me. “For a long time training was the dominant term in computing because people weren’t using models much.” But as these models become more popular, that balance could shift.</p><p>“There will be a tipping point depending on the user load, when the total energy consumed by the inference requests is larger than the training,” said Jovan Stojkovic, a graduate student at the University of Illinois who has written about optimizing inference in large language models. </p><p>And these new reasoning models could bring that tipping point forward because of how computationally intensive they are.</p><p>“The more output a model produces, the more computations it has performed. So, long chain-of-thoughts leads to more energy consumption,” Husom of SINTEF Digital told me.</p><p>OpenAI staffers have been downright enthusiastic about the possibilities of having more time to think, seeing it as another breakthrough in artificial intelligence that could lead to subsequent breakthroughs on a range of scientific and mathematical problems. “o1 thinks for seconds, but we aim for future versions to think for hours, days, even weeks. Inference costs will be higher, but what cost would you pay for a new cancer drug? For breakthrough batteries? For a proof of the Riemann Hypothesis? AI can be more than chatbots,” OpenAI <a href="https://x.com/polynoamial/status/1834280969786065278" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>researcher Noam Brown tweeted</u></a>.<br/><br/>But those “hours, days, even weeks” will mean more computation and “there is no doubt that the increased performance requires a lot of computation,” Husom said, along with more carbon emissions. </p><p>But Snell told me that might not be the end of the story. It’s possible that over the long term, the overall computing demands for constructing and operating large language models will remain fixed or possibly even decline. </p><p>While “the default is that as capabilities increase, demand will increase and there will be more inference,” Snell told me, “maybe we can squeeze reasoning capability into a small model ... Maybe we spend more on inference but it’s a much smaller model.”</p><p>OpenAI hints at this possibility, describing their o1-mini as “a smaller model optimized for STEM reasoning,” in contrast to other, larger models that “are pre-trained on vast datasets” and “have broad world knowledge,” which can make them “expensive and slow for real-world applications.” OpenAI is suggesting that a model can know less but think more and deliver comparable or better results to larger models — which might mean more efficient and less energy hungry large language models.<strong> </strong></p><p>In short, thinking might use less brain power than remembering, even if you think for a very long time.</p>

## Things you really should know about Windows Input, but would rather not

date: 2024-09-17, from: OS News

Are you developing a game for Windows, and are you working on input handling? At first, it could reasonably be assumed that mouse and keyboard should be the simplest parts of this to deal with, but in reality, they are not – at least if we are talking about Windows. In fact, several extremely popular AAA games ship with severe mouse input issues when specific high-end mice are used, and some popular engines have issues that are still extant. In this article we’ll explore a few reasons why that is the case, and end up with a solution that works but is still unsatisfactory. I assume that there is a whole other level of complexity involved in properly dealing with accessories like steering wheels, flight sticks, and so on in simulators, but so far I never had the pleasure of working on a game that required this, and this article will not cover those types of input devices. ↫ Peter &#8216;Durante&#8217; Thoman So, what is the problem? Basically, there are two ways to handle mouse input in Windows: if you use batched raw input processing, which is pretty much a requirement, you need to also choose whether or not to keep legacy input enabled. If you keep it enabled, the legacy input will add so much junk to your message queue it can negatively impact the performance of your game quite harshly. If you disable it, however, something really fun happens: you can no longer move the game window&#8230; Because the Windows UI uses legacy input. Thoman has a solution that he and his company uses, and he considers it an ugly hack, but they just don&#8217;t know of a better way to solve this issue. Thoman keeps legacy input enabled, but just limits the number of message queue events per frame that are being processed (they limit it to 5). As far as they can tell, this doesn&#8217;t seem to have any negative side effects, but it&#8217;s clearly a bit of an ugly hack that shouldn&#8217;t be necessary. I found this a rather interesting niche topic, and I wonder how many people have struggled with this before, and what kind of other solutions exist.

## Myanmar diaspora protests at Chinese Embassy in Washington

date: 2024-09-17, from: VOA News USA

Washington — More than 50 Burmese Americans gathered in front of the Chinese Embassy in Washington, protesting China's alleged interference in Myanmar's internal affairs.


The protest on Saturday, part of a global campaign, called on China to withdraw its support for Myanmar's military junta and respect the will of the people, who have been fighting for democracy since the February 2021 coup.


The protest — with demonstrators waving banners that read "Reject Junta's Sham Elections" and "Solidarity With the People of Myanmar" — was sparked by a statement released earlier Saturday by the Chinese Embassy in Myanmar, saying that China was not interfering in the country's affairs and would continue to promote peace and stability.




"We reject the Chinese Embassy's statement that they're not interfering in Myanmar's internal matters," said Yin Aye, a protest leader who has been organizing demonstrations in the Washington area since the 2021 coup. "If they would stop supporting sham elections and truly pressure the military to stop causing so much pain to our people, we might believe them."


Yin Aye referred to China's close ties with Myanmar's military junta and its alleged interference in the operations of ethnic resistance forces in northern Shan State, actions that have drawn widespread criticism from Burmese and pro-democracy groups.


On August 29, the Ta'ang National Liberation Army, or TNLA, an armed ethnic group fighting against the junta in northeastern Myanmar, said it had received a letter from Chinese authorities in the border town of Ruili warning the group to halt its offensive in northern Shan State, where key Belt and Road Initiative projects are located, or face consequences.


Hla Kyaw Zaw, a veteran observer of China-Myanmar relations, said China's recent actions, particularly its warning to the TNLA, have sparked outrage among the Myanmar public, who view it as a direct threat to ethnic resistance forces fighting for democracy.


"The language used in the letter was undiplomatic and threatening," Hla Kyaw Zaw told VOA’s Burmese Service.


A spokesperson for the TNLA told VOA that Chinese authorities had warned the group in the letter to stop fighting, maintain stability along the China-Myanmar border and protect Chinese citizens. The letter warned that failure to comply would result in China "teaching them a lesson" and holding the group responsible for any consequences.


When asked about the letter at a regular press briefing in late August, China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Liu Jian did not confirm or deny Beijing had sent the letter.


“China is closely following the situation in Myanmar and the developments of the conflict in northern Myanmar and has been working to promote peacetalks and ceasefire,” spokesperson Liu Jian said. “As Myanmar’s biggest neighboring country, China has all along sincerely hoped that Myanmar will achieve stability and development and has worked actively to this end.”


Since then, members of the Myanmar diaspora have intensified protests outside Chinese embassies worldwide, accusing China of supporting Myanmar's military coup.


Protests worldwide


Saturday's protest in Washington was part of a series of coordinated demonstrations by Burmese diaspora communities worldwide.


In July, activists in Washington, New York, San Francisco, London and Tokyo protested outside Chinese embassies and consulates.


In the July protest in Washington, protesters attempted to hand deliver an open letter to Chinese authorities, urging Beijing to halt its support for Myanmar's military junta. However, the letter went unanswered.




"When we handed the letter to the Chinese embassy here in D.C., they refused to accept it. They didn't even acknowledge our demands," said Yin Aye.


Activists were instructed to send the letter by post, but previous attempts to mail similar letters to the Chinese Embassy were returned undelivered.


Despite the lack of formal response, Myanmar activists say the Chinese Embassy in Washington has been monitoring their protest activities in recent weeks.


"Now, we see them videotaping our protests," Yin Aye said.


Voice of America reached out to the Chinese embassies in Washington and Yangon for comment about the protests but did not receive a response by the time of publication.


War crimes allegations


The Myanmar diaspora argues that China's support for Myanmar's military is not only undermining the will of the people but also enabling war crimes, including aerial bombardments and the targeting of internally displaced persons.




Minmin Berwald, an activist of Myanmar descent, was compelled to participate in the protest on Saturday.


"I want to ask China to immediately stop supporting this military regime and interfering in Burma's internal affairs," Berwald said. "It's not just homes being set on fire. Internally displaced people who have fled war are being bombarded."


China's contradictory stance


China has maintained a complex position toward Myanmar since the February 2021 coup, balancing its own interests with regional stability, Hla Kyaw Zaw said. She noted that China has sent high officials to Myanmar, called for peace in the country and sponsored mediating talks between the junta and the armed ethnic groups.


After the coup, however, China's official Xinhua news agency described the military's takeover and replacement of elected ministers as a "major cabinet reshuffle," avoiding the use of the term "coup."


Beijing called for all parties in Myanmar to "resolve their differences" and refrained from condemning the military. In 2022, China also abstained from voting on U.N. Security Council Resolution 2669, which called for an end to violence in Myanmar. However, critics argue that China's actions on the ground suggest deeper involvement.


A veteran China-Myanmar affairs expert in Yangon, who requested anonymity for security reasons, said China's statements often appear contradictory. "It's clear that China wants to control the situation to its advantage," the expert said, referring to China's public calls for peace while its actions suggest otherwise.


China, for its part, has denied interfering in Myanmar's internal affairs on multiple occasions. In its statement Saturday, the Chinese Embassy in Myanmar reiterated its position of noninterference and called for a peaceful resolution to the conflict. The embassy also condemned what it called "unjustified accusations" from individuals and media.




The fight continues


Protesters also called for China to take a more active role in cutting off support to Myanmar's junta, including halting the supply of jet fuel used in airstrikes against civilians. Amnesty International has documented multiple cases of the Myanmar military using airpower to target civilian areas, and activists argue that China's continued engagement with the junta implicates them in these atrocities.


For now, the protesters have vowed to keep returning to the Chinese Embassy in Washington. "We will continue to protest, continue to speak out," said Yin Aye.

## A brief history of QuickTime

date: 2024-09-17, from: OS News

We all know about the Desktop Publishing revolution that the first Macs and their PostScript LaserWriter printers brought in the late 1980s, but many have now forgotten the Desktop Video revolution that followed in the next decade. At its heart was support for multimedia in Apple’s QuickTime. QuickTime isn’t a single piece of software, or even an API in Classic Mac OS, but a whole architecture to support almost any media format you could conceive of. It defines container and file formats for multiple media types, forming the basis for the MPEG-4 standard, extensible encoding and decoding of a wide variety of media using Codecs, and more. ↫ Howard Oakley As a Windows users before I switched to the Mac somewhere in 2003 or 2004 or so, I mostly associated QuickTime with an annoying piece of crapware I sometimes had to install to watch videos, despite my Windows installation being perfectly capable of playing a whole slew of video codecs just fine. To make matters worse, Apple eventually started forcing Windows users to also install their auto-update tool that ran in the background, which would occasionally just&#8230; Install stuff without your permission. Of course, QuickTime was a whole lot more than that, especially on the Mac, where it was simply a core technology of the Mac operating system and the name of the built-in video player. It also served as underpinnings for a whole slew of related technologies, from movie editors like iMovie to the QuickTime streaming tools included in Mac OS X Server, so odds are that somehow, somewhere, you&#8217;ve used QuickTime in your life time. I&#8217;m not entirely ashamed to admit I had to check if QuickTime was still part of macOS today &#8211; I haven&#8217;t actively used macOS since, I think, the Snow Leopard days in 2009 &#8211; but it obviously has been sunset quite a while ago in favour of AVFoundation, which macOS still uses today.

## Pentagon inspector general: Ukraine is 'job one' for defense oversight

date: 2024-09-17, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the U.S. Congress has appropriated $174 billion, including U.S. weapons and materiel, to respond to the crisis and help Ukraine defend itself against Russia’s aggression.


U.S. Department of Defense Inspector General Robert Storch calls the oversight of U.S. security assistance to Ukraine his office’s “job one,” with more than 200 people assigned to that task.


In an interview with Voice of America’s Ukrainian Service, Storch discussed the challenges in obtaining the information necessary for such oversight in a country that is fighting a war, suffers from endemic corruption and has no large-scale U.S. military presence.


According to the most recent quarterly Special Inspector General report to the U.S. Congress on Operation Atlantic Resolve (the name of the U.S. military response to Russian operations in Ukraine), issued in mid-August, there were 57 open investigations as of June 30, 2024. They involved “grant and procurement fraud, corruption, theft, program irregularities, and diversion and counter-proliferation of technology of weapons systems components.”


In January, Ukraine’s SBU security service reported that it had uncovered a $40 million corruption scheme, implicating defense ministry officials and arms supplier managers, that involved the embezzlement of funds for purchase of 100,000 mortar shells.


That case did not involve U.S.-provided materiel. However, in September 2023, Oleksii Reznikov was removed as Ukraine’s defense minister “over various corruption cases despite enjoying a solid reputation in representing Ukraine in its discussions with Western allies,” Reuters reported.


Storch told VOA that the Pentagon is working with Ukraine’s military to ensure that it provides timely and accurate information, and with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s government to fight corruption. He said that in the days immediately following Russia’s full-scale invasion, Ukraine’s armed forces were delinquent in providing information, but that the situation has improved, in part thanks to oversight.


While corruption remains endemic in Ukraine, Storch said that Ukraine’s anti-corruption institutions are maturing and that the oversight community is working to ensure that such progress continues. The following has been edited for length and clarity.


VOA: You are overseeing numerous Pentagon programs. How robust is oversight of the delivery of weapons to Ukraine?


Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Defense Robert Storch: We are leading a robust, comprehensive oversight effort that really covers all aspects of U.S. assistance to Ukraine. I have responsibility over the security assistance that's provided, and we partner very closely, hand-in-glove, with our great colleagues from the State Department Office of Inspector General and the U.S. Agency for International Development Office of Inspector General to make sure we're covering all aspects of humanitarian or other assistance that's being provided to Ukraine.


VOA: How large is your team that is overseeing the Ukrainian program?


Storch: We have a lot of things pulling at us and lots going on in the world with the Department of Defense. But Ukraine is very much job one. I always say it's really a matter of the highest priority for my office and for my colleagues’ offices as well.


So, in the case of the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General, we have over 200 people who are engaged in one aspect or another of oversight over U.S. security assistance to Ukraine. That includes about 30 people who were forward deployed in the region. We have several offices in Germany. We have folks in Poland. And we have both investigators and programmatic oversight personnel at the [U.S.] Embassy in Kyiv. If you take all of our partners from State and AID in oversight entities, it is between 300 and 400 people who are engaged in oversight in this whole-of-government effort.


VOA: When you talk to Ukrainian officials, do they appreciate the importance of reporting?


Storch: Without exception, they acknowledge the importance of making sure that we get the information we need to be able to do our oversight to make sure there's accountability, and frankly to be able to tell the decision-makers here in Washington that that's going on. …


I go up to the Hill [Capitol Hill, location of the U.S. Congress] not infrequently. And you know, I'm not a policymaker. It's up to the administration and the Congress to set what the policies are. But one of the things I get asked all the time is, ‘Are we getting the information we need to carry out our work?’ and we have been getting that, and we're going to work to make sure we continue to.


 




VOA: The Pentagon transfers materiel to the Ukrainian armed forces. Do they understand the importance of oversight, and do they provide timely self-reporting?


Storch: We work really closely to make sure that's the case. That's one of the big lines of effort with regard to our oversight. We've done a number of reports looking at the monitoring and the reporting. There are obligations that the Ukrainian armed forces have for reporting on the status of the equipment, and U.S. personnel keep track and there's a database. When things are lost or destroyed, they have to be reported in a certain way. … [T]hat's one area where I like to think that our oversight has really made a difference. When we first started on that, the level of delinquency in that reporting was really pretty high, and some of that was because, when the war started, the U.S. personnel had to leave the country.


There was equipment being provided and really no one doing that sort of accountability and inventory. So, a lot of it has been playing catch-up. And … there are challenges with a wartime setting and a lot of this equipment is being used on the front lines and [in] really difficult and sad situations. And so being able to maintain accountability is difficult, but we do a lot of work on that.


VOA: In one of your reports, you mentioned endemic corruption in Ukraine. You worked in Ukraine in 2007 to 2009 to help the country overcome corruption. Can you compare the situation in Ukraine now to what you saw back then?


Storch: I actually had the opportunity to work and live in Ukraine back in 2007 to 2009, when I was with the Department of Justice working with the Ukrainians to help them develop measures to address official corruption. And I had the opportunity to go back on a number of occasions and provide assistance in the drafting of the anti-corruption legislation, and that created the National Anti-Corruption Bureau and the Office of the Special Anti-Corruption Prosecutor, so I have had a lot of experience out there and have seen the way these institutions have matured. The Ukrainians made it happen ...


But Ukraine has had long-standing issues with corruption, obviously, and people are working to address it. One of the things we talk about in our quarterly reporting … is that they're continuing to make efforts to address it, and we continue as the United States both to provide assistance in that, and then, in the oversight community, to do oversight over that to make sure that progress is being made.


VOA: Your report mentions that there are 57 investigations ongoing into allegations ranging from irregularities in procurement to corruption, diversion and theft. Have any of those allegations been substantiated?


Storch: At this point, based on our completed work, we haven't substantiated those allegations, but obviously the investigations continue, right?


VOA: About half of the allegations involve the proliferation of weapons. How high is the risk of diversion?


Storch: Sure, there's a significant risk there, but we always want to make sure we're doing everything we can to address it, and that's why I mention the programmatic oversight.


We have a website [with] links to the hotlines that my office and our counterparts operate. I really encourage folks to take advantage of that to report that information. So, people can look into it.


VOA: There is reporting that the Pentagon overestimated the value of some of the U.S. equipment destined for Ukraine. Do you think this accounting error will persist or is it being corrected?


Storch: We're doing everything we can to help the [Defense] Department to address it. We became concerned about that pretty early on and consulted with the department about it and, without getting too complex, basically the department was using a methodology to value the materiel that was being provided that resulted in an overvaluation of it. If you were donating your car, you probably wouldn't be able to donate the cost of buying a new car like that, right? It's a little more complicated than that, but basically it resulted in an overvaluation. Initially the Department looking into it found about $6.2 billion that they thought was overstated. We came in and did additional oversight, which is reflected in our reporting, and found about $1.9 billion additionally.


So, the answer to your question is we made recommendations to help the Department address the issues, and we're going to keep working to make sure those recommendations are carried out and the problems addressed.

## An 11-Year-Old Boy Rescued a Mysterious Artwork From the Dump. It Turned Out to Be a 500-Year-Old Renaissance Print

## US court upholds British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell's sex trafficking conviction

date: 2024-09-17, from: VOA News USA

new york — A U.S. court on Tuesday upheld disgraced British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell's conviction on sex trafficking charges for helping the late financier Jeffrey Epstein abuse underage girls.


Maxwell's lawyers had argued that her convictions violated an agreement Epstein reached with federal prosecutors 15 years ago and violated the statute of limitations. They also cited judicial error and a miscalculation of the federal sentencing guidelines range as reason to reject her conviction and sentence.


But the ruling by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York said Epstein's non-prosecution agreement with federal prosecutors in Florida didn't bar federal prosecutors in New York from bringing a case. They also found that Maxwell's indictment was within the statute of limitations.


Maxwell, 62, was found guilty in December 2021 of luring young girls to Epstein so he could molest them, between 1994 and 2004. She was sentenced to 20 years in prison in June 2022.


Epstein sexually abused children hundreds of times over more than a decade, exploiting vulnerable girls as young as 14. Prosecutors said Maxwell, his longtime companion, helped him and made the abuse possible.


He killed himself in 2019 while awaiting trial.


Epstein and Maxwell's associations with royals, presidents and billionaires were not a prominent part of her trial but mentions of friends such as Bill Clinton and Donald Trump showed how the pair exploited their connections to impress their prey.


The trial revolved around allegations from only a handful of Epstein's accusers. Four testified that they were abused in the 1990s and early 2000s at Epstein's mansions in Florida, New York, New Mexico and the Virgin Islands.


Maxwell is serving her sentence at a low-security federal prison in Tallahassee, Florida.

## Facebook owner Meta bans Russia state media outlets over 'foreign interference'

date: 2024-09-17, from: VOA News USA

London — Meta said it's banning Russia state media organization from its social media platforms, alleging that the outlets used deceptive tactics to amplify Moscow's propaganda. The announcement drew a rebuke from the Kremlin on Tuesday. 


The company, which owns Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, said late Monday that it will roll out the ban over the next few days in an escalation of its efforts to counter Russia's covert influence operations. 


"After careful consideration, we expanded our ongoing enforcement against Russian state media outlets: Rossiya Segodnya, RT and other related entities are now banned from our apps globally for foreign interference activity," Meta said in a prepared statement. 


Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov lashed out, saying that "such selective actions against Russian media are unacceptable," and that "Meta with these actions are discrediting themselves." 


"We have an extremely negative attitude towards this. And this, of course, complicates the prospects for normalizing our relations with Meta," Peskov told reporters during his daily conference call. 


RT was formerly known as Russia Today. Rossiya Segodnya is the parent company behind state news agency RIA Novosti and news brands like Sputnik. 


"It's cute how there's a competition in the West — who can try to spank RT the hardest, in order to make themselves look better," RT said in a release. 


Rossiya Segodnya did not respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press. 




Meta's actions comes days after the United States announced new sanctions on RT, accusing the Kremlin news outlet of being a key part of Russia's war machine and its efforts to undermine its democratic adversaries. 


U.S. officials alleged last week that RT was working hand-in-hand with the Russian military and running fundraising campaigns to pay for sniper rifles, body armor and other equipment for soldiers fighting in Ukraine. They also said RT websites masqueraded as legitimate news sites but were used to spread disinformation and propaganda in Europe, Africa, South America and elsewhere. 




Earlier this month, the Biden administration seized Kremlin-run websites and charged two RT employees of covertly providing millions of dollars in funding to a Tennessee-based content creation company to publish English-language social media videos pushing pro-Kremlin messages. 


Moscow has rejected the allegations. 


Meta had already taken steps to limit Moscow's online reach. Since 2020 it has been labeling posts and content from state media. Two years later, it blocked state media from running ads and putting their content lower in people's feeds, and the company, along with other other social media sites like YouTube and TikTok, blocked RT's channels for European users. Also in 2022 Meta also took down a sprawling Russia-based disinformation network spreading Kremlin talking points about the invasion of Ukraine. 


Meta and Facebook "already blocked RT in Europe two years ago, now they're censoring information flow to the rest of the world," RT said in its statement. 


Moscow has fought back, designating Meta as an extremist group in March 2022, shortly after sending troops into Ukraine, and blocking Facebook and Instagram. Both platforms — as well as Elon Musk's X, formerly known as Twitter, which is also blocked — were popular with Russians before the invasion and the subsequent crackdown on independent media and other forms of critical speech. The social media platforms are now only accessible through virtual private networks.

## Sean 'Diddy' Combs charged with racketeering, sex trafficking

date: 2024-09-17, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — Music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs has been hit with three federal charges of racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution, according to an indictment unsealed on Tuesday.  


Combs, 54, was arrested in Manhattan by federal agents on Monday night, following a year in which his career was derailed by several lawsuits accusing him of physical and sexual abuse. 


Marc Agnifilo, Combs' lawyer, said he was disappointed with the decision to pursue an "unjust prosecution" of the rapper and producer. 


"Sean 'Diddy' Combs is a music icon, self-made entrepreneur, loving family man, and proven philanthropist who has spent the last 30 years building an empire, adoring his children, and working to uplift the Black community," Agnifilo said on Monday night. "He is an imperfect person, but he is not a criminal." 


Agnifilo added that Combs voluntarily relocated to New York in anticipation of the charges. 


Combs, who has also been known as P. Diddy and Puff Daddy, was a major figure in hip-hop in the 1990s and 2000s. He founded the label Bad Boy records, and is credited with helping turn rappers and R&B singers such as Mary J. Blige, Faith Evans, Notorious B.I.G. and Usher into stars. 


His reputation came under fire last November when former girlfriend Casandra Ventura, an R&B singer known as Cassie, accused him in a lawsuit of serial physical abuse, sexual slavery and rape during their decade-long relationship. She agreed to an undisclosed settlement one day after suing, even as Combs denied her allegations. 


His legal pressures mounted, and he has faced several civil lawsuits by women and men who accused him of sexual assault and other misconduct. His lawyers have been fighting those cases in court. Federal agents raided his homes in Los Angeles and Miami Beach, Florida six months ago. 


Singer Dawn Richard, formerly of Danity Kane, last week accused Combs in a lawsuit of sexual assault, battery, sex trafficking, gender discrimination and fraud. 


A Michigan judge this month ordered Combs to pay $100 million to Derrick Lee Smith, who said Combs drugged and sexually assaulted him at a party almost 30 years ago, after Combs failed to show up to defend himself in court. A lawyer for Combs said he would seek to dismiss that judgment. 


Combs has also rejected claims in a February sex trafficking lawsuit by Rodney "Lil Rod" Jones, who Combs employed as a producer on his 2023 release "The Love Album: Off the Grid." 


The indictment is not Combs' first brush with the law. He was acquitted in March 2001 of bribery and weapons charges in a criminal trial stemming from a nightclub shooting that left three people wounded.

## Analysts say Vietnam official's US trip could set path to C-130 deal

date: 2024-09-17, from: VOA News USA

HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam — Analysts say this week’s visit to Washington by Vietnamese Defense Minister Phan Van Giang shows advances in cooperation between the two countries, despite rising Vietnamese nationalism that may indicate rising anti-American sentiment in Vietnam.


A U.S.-based analyst told VOA on September 12 that Giang’s trip set the groundwork for Hanoi to potentially purchase military cargo planes from the United States this year.


Giang met with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin at the Pentagon on Monday. [September 9] Both leaders "reaffirmed the importance of the U.S.-Vietnam partnership," the Defense Department said in a statement, and noted the one-year anniversary of the elevation of the countries’ ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership, the highest tier in Hanoi's diplomatic hierarchy.




The leaders also underscored the importance of working together to address the lasting impacts of the U.S.-Vietnam War. Austin announced that the U.S. would budget $65 million over the next five years to complete the decontamination of Bien Hoa airbase of dioxin, bringing the total from department to $215 million. The airbase was the primary storage site for the toxic chemical Agent Orange during the U.S.-Vietnam War and remains an environmental and public health hazard for those nearby.


Andrew Wells-Dang, who leads the Vietnam War Legacies and Reconciliation Initiative at the United States Institute of Peace, told VOA by phone on September 5 that diplomatic visits are key to advancing war-remediation efforts, including finding and identifying the remains of missing soldiers. He said that along with the U.S. visit of Deputy Defense Minister Vo Minh Luong in July, visits from authorities provide "opportunity for them to have high level support."


Zachary Abuza, a professor at the National War College in Washington and an expert on Southeast Asia, said joint war-reconciliation efforts also set the groundwork for defense cooperation more broadly.


"The United States is very pleased with the growth in bilateral defense relations, and it started from very low levels and was built on humanitarian missions," Abuza said during the August 29 call.


"We've just continued to build on that," he added.


Cargo planes


Reuters reported in July that Hanoi was considering purchasing Lockheed Martin C-130 cargo planes from the U.S., according to unnamed sources.


The U.S.-based analyst, who asked that his name to be withheld because he has not been cleared to discuss the topic, said the C-130 deal was discussed but not finalized during Giang's visit. The analyst said the deal was held back by the "massive [U.S.] bureaucracy" and because solidifying the purchase during the Washington visit would be "too inflammatory for the Chinese."


Ian Storey, senior fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore, noted Vietnam's delicate diplomatic balancing act, illustrated by Giang's travel itinerary before the Washington trip.


"Vietnam aims to keep its relations with the major powers in balance," he wrote in an email on August 30. "As such, Vietnamese Defense Minister Phan Van Giang visited Russia and China in August."


Storey added that the purchase of C-130 planes would not pose a threat to China in its maritime territorial disputes with Vietnam.


"C-130 aircraft would enable the Vietnamese to transport troops and supplies to its occupied atolls in the South China Sea, but these assets are non-strategic and won't shift the dynamics in the South China Sea," he wrote.


Nguyen The Phuong, a maritime security expert at the University of New South Wales Canberra, said the C-130 purchase would be a "symbolic move."


"Vietnam will try to explore more areas of security and defense cooperation between Vietnam and the United States to upgrade to a higher, more meaningful level," he told VOA on August 30. "The C-130 would be the symbol of that kind of evolving relationship," he said.


Phuong said a C-130 is a likely entry point as there is still mistrust between the former foes regarding lethal weapons, and the deal would not rankle China too much.


"It could be quite advantageous for Vietnam," he said of a potential C-130 purchase. "Vietnam can improve its relationship with the United States, and at the same time, we could not anger China because Vietnam would just buy non-lethal weapons."


Rising nationalism


Although there are positive signs to improving Hanoi-Washington relations, there have also been recent instances of anti-Western sentiment that could be an impediment to the countries relations, Phuong said.


Fulbright University Vietnam, which has significant backing from the United States, is facing accusations of fomenting a “color revolution,” similar to the popular uprisings in former Soviet republics.


On August 21, Vietnam National Defense TV aired a critique of Fulbright for allegedly not displaying the Vietnamese flag at a graduation ceremony and facilitating a color revolution.


The report has since been taken down, but Phuong said the Fulbright issue and other recent incidents show tension between Vietnam's conservative and liberal factions.


"It's a presentation of a continuous struggle between different factions, one conservative and one liberal," Phuong said.


Abuza said that Vietnamese authorities may be attempting to tighten control ahead of the anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War in 1975.


"Next April is the 50th anniversary of the fall of Saigon," he said. "The Vietnamese want to control that narrative 100%. There are a lot of sensitivities."


Along with the Fulbright incident, Phuong pointed to recent uproar around Vietnamese celebrities who were pictured with the South Vietnam flag while traveling to the United States. In addition, a Vietnamese high school student faced cyber bullying and was summoned by police after posting in September that he wanted to leave the country and would "probably never see the [Communist] Party positively again."


"There's extreme nationalism in Vietnam at the moment," Phuong said. "It's against Western values."

The auction will take place on October 29 and cover eight areas on the Outer Continental Shelf off Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Maine. The area could provide 13 gigawatts of offshore wind energy, if fully developed. The Biden administration has a goal of installing 30 GW of offshore wind by 2030, and has approved about half that amount so far.

The report warns that we might not see the same kind of growth for solar jobs in 2024, though. Residential installations have dropped, and large utility-scale projects are struggling with grid connection.

## China says it tailed US aircraft over Taiwan Strait

date: 2024-09-17, from: VOA News USA

Beijing — The Chinese military tailed a U.S. aircraft that flew through the politically sensitive Taiwan Strait on Tuesday, Beijing's army said, vowing to "resolutely defend national sovereignty."


"On September 17, a U.S. P-8A anti-submarine patrol aircraft flew through the Taiwan Strait," Li Xi, a senior captain and spokesperson for the Eastern Theater Command of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, PLA, said in a statement.


The PLA theater command "organized fighter jets to tail and stand guard against the US aircraft's flight, dealing with it in accordance with the law," Li said.


"Theater troops are on constant high alert to resolutely defend national sovereignty and security and regional peace and stability."


Beijing views self-ruled Taiwan as a renegade province and claims jurisdiction over the body of water that separates the island from the Chinese mainland.


The U.S. Navy's Seventh Fleet said in a statement that a "P-8A Poseidon transited the Taiwan Strait in international airspace on Sept. 17 (local time)."


The statement did not mention the aircraft being tailed by the Chinese military.


"By operating within the Taiwan Strait in accordance with international law, the United States upholds the navigational rights and freedoms of all nations," it said.


"The aircraft's transit of the Taiwan Strait demonstrates the United States' commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific."


Taiwan's defense ministry said in a statement "a US P-8A aircraft passed through Taiwan Strait from south to north this morning."  


"The military has monitored the situation and no anomaly was detected in our surroundings," it said.


China also accused Germany of heightening security risks in the Taiwan Strait on Saturday after two of its military vessels sailed through the waterway.


Taipei thanked Washington on Tuesday for approving $228 million worth of "return, repair, and reshipment of spare parts" for its aircraft and related equipment, the 16th such sale of arms to the island under U.S. President Joe Biden.


Taiwan's defense ministry said in a separate statement the deal was expected to take effect in a month and "will help maintain the combat readiness and safety of various types of aircraft equipment of our air force".

## Judge rejects former Trump aide's bid to move Arizona case to federal court

date: 2024-09-17, from: VOA News USA

PHOENIX — A judge has rejected a bid by Mark Meadows, a former chief of staff to President Donald Trump, to move his charges in Arizona's fake elector case to federal court, marking the second time he has failed in trying to get his charges out of state court.


In a decision Monday, U.S. District Judge John Tuchi said Meadows missed a deadline for asking for his charges to be moved to federal court, didn't offer a good reason for doing so and failed to show that the allegations against him related to his official duties as chief of staff to the president.


Meadows faces charges in Arizona and Georgia in what authorities allege was an illegal scheme to overturn the 2020 election results in Trump's favor. He had unsuccessfully tried to move charges in the Georgia case last year. It's unknown whether Meadows will appeal the decision. The Associated Press left phone and email messages for two of Meadows' attorneys.


While not a fake elector in Arizona, prosecutors said Meadows, while chief of staff, worked with other Trump campaign members to submit names of fake electors from Arizona and other states to Congress in a bid to keep Trump in office despite his November 2020 defeat. Meadows has pleaded not guilty to the charges in Arizona and Georgia.


In 2020, Democrat Joe Biden won Arizona by 10,457 votes.


The decision sends Meadows' case back down to Maricopa County Superior Court.


In both Arizona and Georgia, Meadows argued his charges should be moved to federal court because his actions were taken when he was a federal official working as Trump's chief of staff and that he has immunity under the supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution, which says federal law trumps state law.


Arizona prosecutors said Meadows' electioneering efforts weren't part of his official duties at the White House.


Meadows last year tried to get his Georgia charges moved but his request was rejected by a judge whose ruling was later affirmed by an appeals court. Meadows has since asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review the ruling.


The Arizona indictment says Meadows confided to a White House staff member in early November 2020 that Trump had lost the election. Prosecutors say Meadows also had arranged meetings and calls with state officials to discuss the fake elector conspiracy.


Meadows and other defendants are seeking a dismissal of the Arizona case.


Meadows' attorneys said nothing their client is alleged to have done in Arizona was criminal. They said the indictment consists of allegations that he received messages from people trying to get ideas in front of Trump — or "seeking to inform Mr. Meadows about the strategy and status of various legal efforts by the president's campaign."


In all, 18 Republicans were charged in late April in Arizona's fake electors case. The defendants include 11 Republicans who had submitted a document falsely claiming Trump had won Arizona, another Trump aide and five lawyers connected to the former president.


In August, Trump's campaign attorney Jenna Ellis, who worked closely with former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, signed a cooperation agreement with prosecutors that led to the dismissal of her charges. Republican activist Loraine Pellegrino became the first person to be convicted in the Arizona case when she pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge and was sentenced to probation.


The remaining defendants have pleaded not guilty to the forgery, fraud and conspiracy charges in Arizona.


Trump wasn't charged in Arizona, but the indictment refers to him as an unindicted coconspirator.


The 11 people who were nominated to be Arizona's Republican electors met in Phoenix on Dec. 14, 2020, to sign a certificate saying they were "duly elected and qualified" electors and claimed Trump had carried the state.


A one-minute video of the signing ceremony was posted on social media by the Arizona Republican Party at the time. The document was later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored.


Prosecutors in Michigan, Nevada, Georgia and Wisconsin have also filed criminal charges related to the fake electors scheme.

## Next generation of Buffetts is poised to become one of the biggest forces in philanthropy

date: 2024-09-17, from: VOA News USA

OMAHA, Neb.  — The next generation of Buffetts — Howard, Susie and Peter — is poised to become one of the most powerful forces in philanthropy when their 94-year-old father, the legendary businessman and leader of Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett, eventually passes away.


But it wasn't always going to be that way.


Buffett announced in June that he would donate his fortune, now valued at nearly $144 billion, to a charitable trust managed by his three children when he dies, instead of giving it to the Gates Foundation, as he indicated 18 years ago.


The next generation of Buffetts will then have 10 years to give the money away, Warren Buffett said.


In the meantime, the elder Buffett continues to make huge annual donations to the Gates Foundation and his four family foundations, which will continue throughout his lifetime. He first mentioned plans for a new charitable trust in November.


Howard Buffett told The Associated Press he's learned what his father told him and his siblings about philanthropy was true: "It's not so easy to give away money if you want to do it smart, if you want to be intelligent about it."


The middle Buffett child, Howard said his father is as sharp as ever and that he hopes he lives a long time, adding: "It's pretty amazing that he's giving us this opportunity."


Buffett has entrusted Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates with significant annual gifts to their foundation since 2006 — a remarkable $43 billion to date.


"Wealthy people don't tend to give their money to other people to give away," said James Ferris, founding director of The Center on Philanthropy and Public Policy at the University of Southern California. But many of the wealthiest people are also hesitant to hand over their fortunes to the next generation over concerns that it hampers their ingenuity, he said.


Ferris thinks the story of Buffett's changing philanthropic intentions is a positive one. "It shows how a donor is making choices and is adapting to circumstances," he said.


The Gates Foundation did not say when it learned of Buffett's decision or what the impact will be on its budget. It previously said in a statement that "Warren Buffett has been exceedingly generous," and that he has "played an invaluable role in championing and shaping the foundation's work to create a world where every person can live a healthy, productive life."


Over the years, Buffett gave the Gates Foundation large annual donations, but also donated billions to foundations run by his three children and a fourth family foundation. Their work offers some insight into the priorities of the next generation of Buffetts.


The Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, named after Warren Buffett's first wife, is the largest in terms of donations. It supports organizations that provide reproductive health care and access to contraception and abortion around the world. Susie Buffett, 71, is its board chair and Peter Buffett, 66, is a board member.


Susie Buffett also leads The Sherwood Foundation, a major supporter of early childhood development nationally that gives grants to organizations and projects within Omaha, Nebraska, the Buffetts' hometown.


Peter Buffett's NoVo Foundation has been an important funder of organizations advocating for the autonomy of girls and women and against gender-based violence. In 2020, Peter and his wife, Jennifer, decided to reorient their focus, expanding their support for Native American communities and projects to build sustainable, local communities with a focus on agriculture and food access.


The Howard G. Buffett Foundation has focused on conflict mitigation and agriculture around the world. Since 2022, it has donated some $800 million — more than most countries — to humanitarian initiatives in Ukraine during the country's war with Russia. These include supporting food distribution at schools, demining activities, and the rebuilding of a major publishing company and a key bridge transporting grain.


In a relatively rare interview for a family that seldom makes time to speak with the media, Howard Buffett, 69, said he couldn't predict exactly how he and his siblings would give away their father's fortune. However, he said they would continue to take risks and find ways to make the biggest difference as their father recommended.


"I can tell you, we'll sit down in a room when the time comes, and we'll get it figured out pretty quickly," he said, acknowledging that the directive to donate all the money within 10 years was a challenge.


The siblings' different ways of thinking and approaches to giving are assets, he said.


"What this is going to do is we're going to bring all of our collective experience together," he said.


But don't expect to find the family name on a lot of buildings, which the siblings have largely avoid even as they've given away more than $15 billion of their father's money since 2006.


Kathleen Enright, president and CEO of the Council on Foundations, said the Buffetts have effectively made philanthropy a family business, with the next generation now seasoned donors who have built enduring institutions in their foundations.


"It is a big deal," she said, of the amount of money that the Buffetts are poised to give away, noting that because the fortune will likely continue to grow, they will have to give away highly visible sums to spend it down.


The tight timeframe to give away his fortune after his death reflects one of Warren Buffett's longstanding conditions for receiving charitable funding. He has instructed the Gates Foundation and his family's foundations to grant out the full amount they received within a year.


The next generation of Buffetts have run their foundations with tiny staffs — much like how Warren Buffett oversees his massive Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate with only about two dozen people at its headquarters in Omaha.


Howard Buffett said his foundation employs just 22 staff members. It granted $458.1 million in 2023, according to tax documents. He acknowledged that his "lean" staff puts some limits on their capacity, but said the way they've scaled their work is through creating strong and enduring relationships with other organizations to help implement their ideas.


In contrast, the Gates Foundation has one of the largest endowments at $75.2 billion, funded by donations from Bill Gates and Warren Buffett. It employs more than 2,000 people, many of them technical experts all over the world, and is known for making highly directed grants with rigorous reporting requirements. The foundation has said it will wind down its operations within 25 years after its founders' deaths.


Howard Buffett said he likes a challenge and thinks that in general, wealthy people should give their money away within their lifetimes, rather than holding it in perpetual foundations.


"Somebody is going to spend that money. Somebody is going to give that money away," he said. "So, I would rather do that with my brother and sister and do it together, as a partnership, than see it done any other way."

## US will ‘continue to push’ for release of detainees in China, State Department says

date: 2024-09-17, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — On Monday, after the U.S. State Department announced the release of David Lin, an American pastor, from nearly two decades of imprisonment in China, officials said more work remains to secure the freedom of other Americans held in China. 


U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters that the U.S. government had been working to secure Lin's release for some time. 


“When it comes to David Lin, we are glad to see he is released. We welcome it. We’ll continue to push the release of other Americans,” Miller said during a regular press briefing.


Lin, 68, was detained in 2006 after entering China. He was later convicted of contract fraud and given a life sentence in 2009. After Chinese courts reduced his sentence, he was set to be released from Beijing in 2029.


Bob Fu, a pastor and founder of ChinaAid, a nonprofit dedicated to religious freedom in China, called the original charges against Lin a “scam” and said they were facilitated by the Chinese government as a gambit to unjustly take hostages.


The imprisonment and now release of Lin, Fu told VOA, is especially significant as China is increasingly cracking down on religious practices within the country, with human rights violations in Xinjiang and Tibet and growing governmental restrictions on Christian traditions. 


Despite this, Fu said that the success of Lin’s release could be attributed to two factors: the souring of the global public opinion on China and the hard work of U.S. officials.


“This shows that if our top political leaders really take this seriously and persistently, it will bear fruits for our citizens' freedom,” he said.


According to the Dui Hua Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to freeing detainees through dialogue with China, over 200 American nationals in China under coercive measures, including wrongful detentions and exit bans.


The State Department has listed two other detained individuals as priority cases: Businessman Kai Li, accused of espionage in 2016, and Mark Swidan, convicted of drug trafficking in 2019.


“We’ll continue to push the release of other Americans,” Miller said. “It’s something that we have been working on for some time.”


Miller declined to say if Lin's release had been the result of a swap, according to a report by Reuters.


China's embassy in Washington declined to comment when asked if Beijing had received anything from the U.S. in return for Lin's release, according to Reuters. The embassy also told Reuters that Chinese authorities handle criminal suspects in accordance with the law and "treat them equally regardless of their nationality."


Later this week, a U.S. congressional hearing is set to be held on Americans who have been arbitrarily imprisoned in China.


Some material for this report came from Reuters.

## Boeing says it's weighing temporary layoffs to save cash during machinists strike

date: 2024-09-17, from: VOA News USA

seattle — Boeing plans to freeze hiring and reduce travel and is considering temporary layoffs to save cash during a factory worker strike that began last week, the company told employees Monday. 


The company said the moves, which include reduced spending on suppliers, were necessary because "our business is in a difficult period." 


Chief financial officer Brian West detailed 10 immediate cutbacks in a memo to employees. They include a freeze on hiring across all levels, a pause in pay increases for managers and executives who get promoted, and a cancellation of all travel that isn't critical. 


"We are also considering the difficult step of temporary furloughs for many employees, managers and executives in the coming weeks," West said. 


Boeing's business is in a difficult spot, he said, adding: "This strike jeopardizes our recovery in a significant way." 


About 33,000 workers represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers began a strike early Friday. The walkout came after workers rejected an offer of a 25% increase in pay over four years. The union originally sought a pay hike of at least 40%. 


Representatives of the company and the union are scheduled to meet Tuesday with federal mediators. The union has started to survey its members to learn what they want most in a new contract. 


Striking workers are picketing at several locations around Washington state, Oregon and California. 


Outside Boeing's huge factory in Everett, Washington, Nancie Browning, a materials-management specialist at Boeing for more than 17 years, said last week's offer was worse than the one that prompted a two-month strike in 2008. She said that without annual bonuses that workers have come to depend on, the proposed pay increase was more like 9%, not 25%. 


"We just want a piece of the pie like everybody else," she said. "Why should we work all this overtime and bust our backs while these guys [Boeing executives] are sitting up in their suites just raking in the cash?" 


The bonuses have emerged as a flash point for union members. Workers say they range from $3,000 to $5,000 a year. 


Boeing says it is hard to calculate bonuses in a way that is fair to 33,000 people who perform different jobs. So instead, the company proposes to ditch the payouts and replace them with automatic contributions of $4,160 per year to each employee's 401(k) retirement account. 


Workers are bitter that in contract extensions over the past 16 years, Boeing ended its traditional pension plan and lowered health care benefits. 


"We want our pension back," said Jacob Bustad, a machinist with Boeing for 14 years who was also on the picket line in Everett. "We just keep losing and we never gain, while the people at the top just get more and more money. Boeing has done really good for me and my family, but these last years have been hard." 


Boeing has lost more than $25 billion since the start of 2019 and burned through $4.3 billion in the second quarter of 2024 alone as it stood poised to post another money-losing year. The strike will delay deliveries of new planes, which are an important source of cash for the company. 


Stephanie Pope, the head of Boeing's commercial airplanes division, cited the company's $60 billion in total debt in urging blue-collar workers to accept the contract offer last week. She called it the best offer Boeing had ever made — and it was endorsed by the union's local president and negotiators. 


But workers rejected the recommendation of their own leaders, which had not happened since 1995. 


Additional cost-cutting moves spelled out in the chief financial officer's memo included eliminating first- and business-class service for anyone on travel that is deemed critical and stopping spending on outside consultants. 


West also said Boeing plans to make "significant reductions in supplier expenditures" and will stop most supplier purchase orders related to the 737, 767 and 777 airplane models. 


After the strike started, Moody's put Boeing on review for a possible credit downgrade, and Fitch said a strike longer than two weeks would make a downgrade more likely. Both agencies rate Boeing debt one notch above noninvestment or junk status.

## Communal Luxury: The Public Bathhouse

<h2 id="no-running-water-at-home">No Running Water at Home</h2>
<p>For people in industrial societies, few activities demand more privacy than washing and grooming the body. We usually do it alone, in our private bathrooms, with locked doors. Seen in a historical context, that is unusual. Bathing in the presence of others has been the rule rather than the exception. As late as the first half of the twentieth century, many households, even in the most advanced industrial societies, did not have running water at home, let alone a private bathroom. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>A bathroom requires a domestic water supply, but also a sewer drain, and an energy source to heat the water. Of course, it&rsquo;s possible to have a hot bath at home without these infrastructures. Ever since Antiquity, the rich have built private baths in their houses. Most often, they could do that because less well-off people - either servants or slaves - filled and emptied their bathtubs with bucketloads of water and collected firewood to heat them.</p>
<p>However, for most people, it was more practical to take their bodies to the water rather than the other way around. For some, that meant bathing in rivers, lakes, and springs. For others, especially in urban environments, it meant visiting the public bathhouse.</p>

<h2 id="is-bathing-unsustainable">Is Bathing Unsustainable?</h2>
<p>Modern bathing practices are a textbook example of an unsustainable lifestyle based on fossil fuels. Hot water production is the second largest energy use in many homes (after space heating and/or cooling), and much of it is used for bathing or showering. <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> The modern bathroom also uses a lot of water and adds extra energy use through space heating and waste-water treatment. Building and renovating bathrooms requires resources, too.</p>
<p>Sustainability advocates follow two strategies to address these problems. The first strategy concentrates on technological solutions, such as low-flow showerheads, water boilers heated by solar collectors, waste-water heat recovery systems, and greywater recycling. The second strategy counts on behavioral or social changes by questioning modern standards of cleanliness: bathing or showering shorter and less frequently, taking cold showers, or doing a cat wash at the sink. <sup id="fnref1:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>These strategies are unlikely to bring much results. Many technological fixes are difficult or impossible to install in existing buildings, especially in cities. For example, as the number of floors increases, an apartment building quickly runs out of roof space to install solar collectors for all residents. On the other hand, promoting discomfort as a sacrifice for sustainability is unlikely to engage broader environmental practices. <sup id="fnref1:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Communal bathing makes it easier to disconnect bathing practices from fossil fuels.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Communal bathing could be a third approach, but it&rsquo;s rarely mentioned. That&rsquo;s remarkable because, in terms of resource efficiency, it&rsquo;s hard to beat. Building and operating a bathhouse for 1,000 people requires much less energy than building and operating 1,000 individual bathrooms. A public bathhouse is also more efficient concerning materials, money, and space. <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p>
<p>Just as importantly, public bathing makes applying the sustainable technologies mentioned above more feasible. That further reduces energy consumption and makes it possible to disconnect bathing practices from fossil fuels. Finally, a public bathhouse can achieve significantly improved sustainability without promoting discomfort. On the contrary, pooling resources to build something for a community rather than for every household separately allows for a high level of sustainable extravagance. That may be an easier sell than cold showers.</p>

<h2 id="bathing-in-rivers-lakes-and-hot-springs">Bathing in Rivers, Lakes, and Hot Springs</h2>
<p>Nature has provided humans with bathing facilities through streams, rivers, pools, lakes, waterfalls, and rain showers. Humanity spent much time in tropical Africa, where bathing did not require artificially heated water for comfort. When we moved into colder climates, Nature presented us with another solution: hot springs. Many tens of thousands of thermal springs exist around the planet — only a few present-day countries lack them entirely. <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup><sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></p>
<p>Bathing in hot springs was common in ancient civilizations all over the world. However, it&rsquo;s a practice that goes back even further in time. Archeological evidence abundantly shows that many prehistoric settlements established themselves near hot springs. <sup id="fnref1:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup><sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> It&rsquo;s impossible to prove rock solid that people used those waters for bathing, but why wouldn&rsquo;t they, especially in cold regions? <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Enjoying a hot bath is a practice that predates recorded history.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Today&rsquo;s bathing culture relies on fossil fuels, but if we consider the historical context, enjoying a hot bath is not unsustainable. In the case of hot springs, the entire infrastructure and operation — water supply, drainage, and heat source — are already in place.</p>
<p>Our ancestors also invented the steam or sweat bath to take advantage of cold water in all seasons and climates. Rather than heating water, it heats people so they can bathe comfortably in cold water. The earliest steam huts, from prehistoric times, were little more than small log cabins or tent-like structures covered with woolen blankets or hides. <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup><sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup><sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup><sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="the-birth-of-the-bathhouse">The Birth of the Bathhouse</h2>
<p>Artificial bathing facilities made from brick or stone appeared around 4,000 years ago. <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup> They could be an open-air pool, a bathhouse, or a private bathroom. Many bathhouses and bathing pools were built on top of natural hot springs, modifying the natural environment to make it more convenient, safe, and attractive.<sup id="fnref2:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup><sup id="fnref1:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> People also began to divert water into urban bathing facilities using canals, pipes, and aqueducts. They started building baths that used artificially heated water as well.</p>
<p>The Ancient Romans are most famously associated with the public bathhouse, although they took much inspiration from the Ancient Greeks. Greek bathhouses comprised rooms with individual hip baths against the walls. Sitting up straight, the bathers threw hot water over themselves or had this done by a servant. In contrast, Roman bathers shared the water in large bathtubs or pools. Both used steam baths as well. <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup><sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup><sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup><sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup></p>
<p>At the height of the Empire, there were around 1,000 public baths in the city of Rome alone for a population of about 1 million people - one bathhouse per 1,000 people. <sup id="fnref2:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup><sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup> The most prominent bathhouses were the &ldquo;thermae,&rdquo; which could hold up to a few thousand people bathing at the same time. These facilities, which only appeared in the largest cities, were richly decorated with mosaics, marble floors and pools, granite columns, and statues. However, most Ancient Roman bathhouses were smaller neighborhood baths called &ldquo;balnea.&rdquo; <sup id="fnref1:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="the-preindustrial-bathhouse">The Preindustrial Bathhouse</h2>
<p>The public bathhouse&rsquo;s history continues after the Roman Empire&rsquo;s demise. In the East, the Roman bathhouse evolved into the hammam, which ditched the pools and concentrated more on sweating as a cleaning method.<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup><sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup> After a sweat bath, people threw water over themselves. Reminiscent of the small Roman baths known as balnea, hammams spread in large numbers in all cities of the Islamic world as they facilitated bodily cleanliness and the accomplishment of body ablutions before praying. <sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup></p>
<p>In Western Europe, many Roman baths fell into disrepair. However, the public bathhouse returned in full swing during the late Middle Ages, when a new period of urbanization set in. <sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup><sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup><sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup> In the 13th, 14th, and 15th centuries, a lot of European cities had a public bathhouse per 2,000 to 5,000 citizens.<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup> Many were steam baths inspired by the hammam. A second type of bathhouse offered wooden bathtubs to seat a small group of people. The medieval bathhouse was known as a &ldquo;stew,&rdquo; which refers to the oven that either heated water for the bathtubs or filled the room with steam. <sup id="fnref1:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup><sup id="fnref1:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup></p>

<p>Northern Europe and Russia - never conquered by Roman or Islamic Empires - stuck to sweat and hot air baths. For example, public &ldquo;banyas&rdquo; existed in towns throughout Muscovy during the Middle Ages. <sup id="fnref1:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> Asia also developed independent bathing cultures. For instance, in late medieval Japan, people shared private hot baths among families, neighbors, and friends for economic reasons. For these &ldquo;cooperative baths&rdquo; of mostly four to ten individuals, every bather brought a portion of firewood to heat the water. That practice evolved into larger public baths - &ldquo;sento&rdquo; - which experienced rapid growth from the fifteenth century onwards.<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup><sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="bathing-for-pleasure">Bathing for Pleasure</h2>
<p>Nowadays, sustainability advocates who promote shorter or less frequent showers implicitly regard bathing as a strictly utilitarian practice. However, for most of history, bathing was never just about hygiene. Apart from getting clean, people also visited public baths to relax, have fun, and socialize. Rather than a quick affair, the bathing process — no matter its form — often went on for hours. <sup id="fnref2:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup><sup id="fnref1:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup></p>
<p>The Ancient Greeks sat together in individual bathtubs, having conversations, for which the space&rsquo;s acoustics were optimally suited. <sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup> In Ancient Rome, public baths were places where people went almost daily to be seen, mingle, relax, gossip, dine, or play sports and study. Bathers accessed beauty treatments such as massages, shaving, hairdressing, and depilating. They celebrated parties and anniversaries and honored foreign guests. <sup id="fnref3:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup><sup id="fnref1:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup><sup id="fnref1:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup><sup id="fnref2:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup><sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rather than a quick affair, the bathing process — no matter its form — often went on for hours.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The medieval European bathhouse continued these traditions with less splendor but not necessarily with less revelry. In particular, medieval stews with wooden bathtubs were often a place of amusement that also furnished food, drink, music, and various types of bodily care. <sup id="fnref2:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup> In Japan, during the 16th century, public baths became places to gather and socialize, with large groups of people eating, drinking, and singing. <sup id="fnref1:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup><sup id="fnref2:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup> River bathing, which continued around cities and in rural areas until the 20th century, was a kind of play in which swimming was a potential element. <sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup></p>
<p>At the same time, bathing was considered essential to prevent and cure diseases, following the Hippocratic ideas that people could maintain or restore the balance of bodily fluids by exposing the body to cold, hot, moist, or dry circumstances. The layout of preindustrial baths reflected these ideas, featuring pools and spaces of different temperatures. <sup id="fnref4:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup><sup id="fnref1:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="communal-luxury">Communal Luxury</h2>
<p>While these elements of pleasure, social interaction, and health continue today in mineral spas, there is a crucial difference with earlier bathing practices. The present-day spa is far too expensive to substitute for a private bathroom. In contrast, the historical public bathhouse was an egalitarian institution.</p>
<p>Roman public baths had no or low entrance fees and were open to everyone. There were no areas reserved for higher-ranking patrons. Combined with the splendid architecture and opulent decoration of the baths, this ensured that even the most humble servant would have a taste of luxury. <sup id="fnref5:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup><sup id="fnref2:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup><sup id="fnref2:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup> These customs continued into the European Middle Ages and were shared by bathing cultures across the world. <sup id="fnref3:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup> For example, in Japan, the bathhouse aided in &ldquo;slowly deconstructing the existing social hierarchy and created a new cultural flow between the elite and the commoners.&rdquo; <sup id="fnref3:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup><sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup></p>
<p>The only separation happened between men and women, and it was far from universal across space and time. They would either go to different bathhouses, occupy different sections, or share the same spaces at different times of the day or the week. <sup id="fnref2:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup><sup id="fnref6:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup><sup id="fnref3:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup><sup id="fnref3:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup><sup id="fnref4:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="the-fuel-use-of-roman-bathhouses">The Fuel Use of Roman Bathhouses</h2>
<p>How sustainable was that communal luxury? Most research about the energy use of bathhouses concerns Ancient Roman baths. Historians have sometimes faulted the large bathhouses from the Empire for their wastefulness, arguing that their widespread use caused deforestation. <sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup><sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup><sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup> However, in recent years, archeological research, thermal analysis, and heat transfer studies have made it increasingly clear that Ancient Roman bathhouses, in spite of their opulence, were remarkably energy-efficient buildings. <sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup><sup id="fnref1:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup></p>
<p>The first reason was the hypocaust system. It consisted of one or more underground furnaces that distributed hot air under the floor and into the hollow walls (some baths had heated ceilings, too). Because of the large radiant surfaces, the spaces in the building could be heated at a lower temperature, saving energy. Although the water for the pools was reheated periodically in an insulated boiler close to the furnace, the heat in the floors and the walls helped to keep it warm for an extended period. <sup id="fnref1:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup><sup id="fnref2:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup></p>
<p>A study of the Stabian Baths, one of the oldest surviving thermae, shows a fuel consumption of between 5 and 8 kg of firewood per hour, depending on the season. <sup id="fnref2:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup><sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup> That corresponds to a wood supply of slightly more than 60 ash trees per year, which was unlikely to cause deforestation. <sup id="fnref3:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup> Firewood consumption was probably even lower because Roman baths routinely supplemented wood with other locally available fuels, often waste products: reeds, harvest by-products (olive pits, orchard trimmings, chaff), and animal wastes (dung and bones). <sup id="fnref3:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many Roman baths were heated almost exclusively by solar energy on sunny days.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Following the same methodology, a study of a later bathing complex - the Forum Baths in Ostia - shows that the Romans continued improving their bathhouses&rsquo; energy efficiency. <sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup><sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup> The Forum Baths were three times larger than the Stabian Baths - 923m2 versus 310m2 of heated spaces - but their calculated annual wood consumption is not even twice as high: roughly 100 trees per year. <sup id="fnref1:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup><sup id="fnref4:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup> The newer bathhouse had thicker walls (two meters instead of one meter), as well as much larger glazed windows, which increased the share of solar radiation. <sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup> Earlier research has shown that the Forum baths were heated almost exclusively by solar energy on sunny days. <sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup></p>
<p>The studies above assume that the Romans heated their baths for 24 hours daily and only shut them down for maintenance. Roman bathhouses likely continued to be heated through the night, as it was more practical and energy-efficient. Many baths were open daily, and it could take a whole day to heat them from a cold state. In later centuries, medieval stews and hammams often used the heat or the ashes of the furnace to bake bread and other foods at night. <sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup> Hammams and medieval stews were less energy-efficient than Roman baths. Hammams had heated floors but no heated walls and few windows, while medieval stews often had none of these.</p>

<h2 id="roman-bathhouse-versus-private-shower">Roman Bathhouse Versus Private Shower</h2>
<p>How does the energy use of the Roman bathhouse compare to that of the modern shower? Academic research does not provide an answer, but a quick calculation shows that the Roman bathing experience, which lasted for hours, was more energy-efficient than the present-day private shower, which lasts, on average, 9 minutes. The daily energy use of the Forum baths corresponds to the daily energy use of 557 showers. <sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup> While we don&rsquo;t know how many people visited the Forum Baths daily, they likely surpassed that number: the baths could host up to 500 bathers simultaneously. <sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Roman bathing experience, which lasted for hours, was more energy-efficient than the present-day private shower, which lasts, on average, 9 minutes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, in the calculation above, the energy use for the shower only concerns water heating, while the fuel use for the public baths also - and mainly - includes space heating. <sup id="fnref5:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup> For example, assuming that the water in the pools of the Stabian baths was changed only once per day, heating the water accounted for less than 10% of the total energy use, corresponding to the energy use of only 52 showers. The low energy use for water heating is partly explained by the excellent thermal insulation of the heated floors and walls, meaning that space and water heating cannot be separated. However, it is also because the Romans shared the water in pools, while every shower requires freshly heated water.</p>
<p>The Roman bathhouse also compares favorably to the typical backyard sauna, for which the fuel consumption hovers between 5 and 15kg of firewood per session. <sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup> Only sixteen such sauna sessions require as much fuel as the Stabian baths used daily. The sauna has no heated floor and walls. Furthermore, historically, it was often built partly underground to save fuel, but nowadays, it&rsquo;s usually a badly insulated building standing in a cold climate.</p>

<h2 id="the-public-baths-of-the-industrial-revolution">The Public Baths of the Industrial Revolution</h2>
<p>Bathing practices have changed quite a lot since Roman and late medieval times, particularly in most of the Western world. Few of us will have the time or even the need to linger in a bathhouse for several hours daily, and some of us may feel uncomfortable bathing in public. <sup id="fnref1:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup> However, a bathhouse can also take a form more in line with modern bathing habits. The public bathhouse of the Industrial Revolution demonstrates this.</p>
<p>In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, cities received large numbers of immigrants who came to work in factories. Most of these people were housed in overcrowded tenement buildings without running water, leading to unsanitary conditions. <sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup> Recurring epidemics and new medical insights led to a &ldquo;gospel of cleanliness&rdquo; that resulted in a new wave of public bathhouses across the Western world. Many of these baths only disappeared between the 1950s and 1980s.</p>
<p>The public hygiene movement began in England and peaked there in the 1840s. By 1896, more than 200 municipalities in Britain were maintaining public baths. The English bathhouse emulated the splendor of Roman baths in its architecture and decoration: it was &ldquo;large, handsome, and costly.&rdquo; <sup id="fnref1:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup> However, it did not copy the Ancient bathing customs. It now reserved different sections of the bathhouse for different social classes. Furthermore, while the pools still provided social interaction, the bathtubs were now placed in individual compartments. Finally, the modern bathhouse instituted maximum time limits for using the pool and the bathtubs. <sup id="fnref2:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup><sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup><sup id="fnref:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="the-shower-bathhouse">The Shower Bathhouse</h2>
<p>Germany, the first to follow the British on the continent, also built monumental bathhouses. <sup id="fnref:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup> However, in the 1880s, Berlin physician Oscar Lasser argued that the large baths were too costly to build in the necessary numbers. He proposed the introduction of smaller bathhouses with nothing but showers in individual compartments. Until then, the shower was only attached to a bathtub or used in barracks and prisons, where soldiers and inmates were showered with cold water. <sup id="fnref1:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup><sup id="fnref3:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup><sup id="fnref3:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup></p>
<p>The shower bathhouse became the dominant public bath type in most of Western Europe and also in North America, where the sanitary reform movement took off in the 1890s. <sup id="fnref:50"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">50</a></sup><sup id="fnref:51"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup> It cleared away the last vestiges of the Ancient bathing culture by ditching the pools and switching to a more practical architecture. For better or worse, the public bathhouse from the Industrial Revolution was the &ldquo;antithesis of the preindustrial bathhouse.&rdquo; <sup id="fnref1:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup> Although bathers still made use of communal infrastructure, there was no more space for pleasure, social interaction, public nakedness, and social mixing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For better or worse, the public bathhouse from the Industrial Revolution was the antithesis of the preindustrial bathhouse.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the higher social classes gradually gained access to their private water supply and bathrooms, the public bath became increasingly associated with poverty. Although shower bathhouses did not have separate sections for different social classes, they were mainly built in low-income neighborhoods, aimed at the poor only. Bathers were led to their shower cubicle by an attendant, who opened the tap, decided on the water temperature, and started a timer. People had at most 20 minutes to undress, shower, and dress again.<sup id="fnref4:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup><sup id="fnref2:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup> &ldquo;The poor had to be clean but not enjoy it too much.&rdquo; <sup id="fnref5:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="bring-back-the-public-bathhouse">Bring Back the Public Bathhouse?</h2>
<p>In Europe and North America, the public bathhouse disappeared once everyone got their private bathroom - although we still bathe together in sports centers and continue using communal bathrooms in hostels or campings. The public bathhouse survives elsewhere but is in decline almost everywhere. For example, Cairo had only eight hammams in 2000, compared to more than seventy at the beginning of the 19th century.<sup id="fnref:52"><a href="#fn:52" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">52</a></sup><sup id="fnref:53"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">53</a></sup> In 1968, greater Tokyo boasted 2,687 public bathhouses. In 2022, only 462 were left. <sup id="fnref:54"><a href="#fn:54" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">54</a></sup><sup id="fnref:55"><a href="#fn:55" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">55</a></sup></p>
<p>Historically, the bathhouse was born out of the need for efficiency: bathing was too resource-intensive to organize individually. That is no longer the case thanks to the advance of central infrastructures - fossil fuels, electricity, water supply, sewers. However, in the context of the present environmental crisis, the resource efficiency of the public bathhouse has become relevant once again. It&rsquo;s a solution that could reduce energy use relatively quickly without the need for new technologies or sacrificing comfort. Resilience is another argument for the bathhouse. <sup id="fnref:56"><a href="#fn:56" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">56</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="what-type-of-public-bathhouse-do-we-want">What Type of Public Bathhouse Do We Want?</h2>
<p>The metamorphosis of the public bath in the 19th and 20th centuries, which also affected public baths outside the Western world, presents a challenge to anyone wanting to revive public bathing for sustainability. What type of bathhouse do we want? Of course, the Roman bath and the shower bathhouse are both extremes, and many intermediate forms are imaginable. Nevertheless, any designer of a future bathhouse will have to make decisions that are likely to be controversial.</p>
<p>For example, one could argue that the shower bathhouse not only fits modern bathing practices but also maximizes resource efficiency. That is especially true when the government, rather than the bather, controls shower duration and water temperature. In that way, the public bathhouse could become a technology to enforce frugality upon the whole population. However, to put it mildly, such an approach is unlikely to generate enthusiasm for reviving public bathhouses. Neither does it do much to improve social interaction. <sup id="fnref:57"><a href="#fn:57" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">57</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Advocating for the return of the preindustrial public bathhouse, which centers around social interaction and communal luxury, may be more successful in luring people away from their private bathrooms, but it also runs into obstacles. The public bathhouse has faced resistance for 2,000 years, mostly because of conflicting views about health and morals. <sup id="fnref:58"><a href="#fn:58" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">58</a></sup> For example, concerns about debauchery and prostitution - real and imagined - run throughout the history of the bathhouse in all cultures. <sup id="fnref:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">59</a></sup> Separating males and females does not fully address those worries.</p>

<p>Any plea for reviving public baths will also have to deal with the fear of contagious disease. For example, a &ldquo;lockdown&rdquo; of society, as many governments applied during the coronavirus pandemic in 2020 and 2021, is incompatible with public bathhouses. Such a measure only works when everybody has a private bathroom. <sup id="fnref:60"><a href="#fn:60" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">60</a></sup> The link between communal bathing and health is complex. Science has confirmed many of the health benefits of cold, hot, and steam baths and has also shown the importance of social interaction. However, bringing people together will always raise health risks, too.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-build-a-low-tech-bathhouse">How to Build a Low-tech Bathhouse?</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s another distinction between bathhouses built before and after the Industrial Revolution: preindustrial baths worked with renewable fuels, while industrial baths ran on fossil fuels. Many modern bathhouses had an on-site coal power plant, which heated the space and the water and provided electricity for lighting. Fossil fuel-powered bathhouses are more energy efficient than fossil fuel-powered private bathrooms, but we can do better than that.</p>
<p>A large bathhouse heated by a hypocaust system and large windows is still hard to beat as a carbon neutral technology, at least based on sustainable wood production. <sup id="fnref:61"><a href="#fn:61" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">61</a></sup><sup id="fnref:62"><a href="#fn:62" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">62</a></sup> However, biomass combustion creates air pollution, while we could also power a bathhouse with renewable energy sources that don&rsquo;t have that problem. The most apparent solution for space and water heating is flat plate solar collectors in which the sun heats water. Heat-generating windmills are a low-tech alternative to solar thermal collectors in less sunny climates. <sup id="fnref:63"><a href="#fn:63" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">63</a></sup> Other potential heat sources are geothermal energy and factory waste heat.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fossil fuel-powered bathhouses are more energy efficient than fossil fuel-powered private bathrooms, but we can do better than that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A solar or wind-powered bathhouse&rsquo;s biggest drawback is its dependency on favorable weather conditions. To compensate for that, solar or wind power can be combined with thermal energy storage, such as insulated water tanks. Storing heat in a thermal mass for longer periods is much cheaper and more sustainable than storing electricity in chemical batteries. However, it requires space that only communal bathing can offer. Steam baths and saunas are more difficult to disconnect from biomass combustion, but some innovative examples exist. <sup id="fnref:64"><a href="#fn:64" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">64</a></sup></p>
<p>Clustering bathing facilities in a shared infrastructure also creates sufficient space for a bathhouse to have extensive heat insulation (a decisive factor in energy consumption) and provide for its water supply (for example, by catching and storing rainwater) as well as wastewater treatment (for example through phytoremediation using plants).</p>
<p>Architects have applied some of these ideas in countries where public baths are still used. For example, in a mountain village in China, a community bathhouse for 5,000 people is largely off-the-grid, pumping up its water from a well, heating it with solar collectors, and filtering the run-off wastewater from the showers and the toilets in basins filled with bamboo plants. <sup id="fnref:65"><a href="#fn:65" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">65</a></sup></p>

<p>However, a public bathhouse also fits the more high-tech vision of a centralized energy infrastructure based on solar PV panels and wind turbines that provide electricity. In such a configuration, public bathhouses could absorb excess electricity during abundantly sunny or windy days. Rather than curtailing the electricity from surplus solar and wind power, we could use it to power electric heat pumps and store the heat in the thermal mass of public baths. <sup id="fnref:66"><a href="#fn:66" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">66</a></sup> While this approach is less resource-efficient than off-grid bathhouses operating without electricity, it still beats a scenario in which a centralized renewable power grid supplies energy to many private bathrooms.</p>

<p>The first written reference to the steam bath dates back to the fifth century BC, when Greek historian Herodotus compared the Scythian sweat bath north of the Black sea to the Greek steam bath of his time. However, it&rsquo;s very likely that its origins go back to prehistoric times. Not surprisingly, the steam bath and the hot air bath initially spread in regions with cold and long winters: northwestern Europe, Russia, Alaska, and Canada.

<p>One of the earliest archeological records of human-made bathing facilities dates back to around 2300 BC in what is now Pakistan. The inhabitants of Mohenjo-daro, the probable capital of the Indus civilization, built wells and drainage systems allowing for private bathrooms in most residential buildings, as well as a large, communal bathing pool. The private bathrooms had a 1m2 shallow platform, where people threw buckets of water over themselves. The &ldquo;Great Bath&rdquo; was a brick basin with steps on either side and a capacity for 160 m3 of water. As the city was located in a hot desert climate, there was no need for heating the water.

<p>The study assumes that the baths were heated for 24 hours per day and only shut down for maintenance. The fuel used for heating up the bath initially (calculated at 35 kg in the case of the Stabian Baths) is added only once to the total yearly energy use. The results are also based on the assumption that the water of the baths was changed once per day (and thus had to be heated from a cold state once per day).&#160;<a href="#fnref:37" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Whether or not the (small) windows in the Stabian baths had glass or shutters is not entirely clear. The study concludes that energy use is pretty similar with both glazed and unglazed windows. However, the Forum baths, with windows several meters high, would have required almost 1.5 times more wood to heat rooms with unglazed windows during the month of May, and more than twice as much in the coldest month.&#160;<a href="#fnref:40" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>A fuel use of 7.5 to 12 kg/hr averages at 9.75 kg/hr, which corresponds to 234 kg firewood per day. One kg of wood contains roughly 5 kWh of thermal energy, which brings the daily fuel use of the Forum baths to 1,170 kWh. A shower of 8.9 minutes (the average in the netherlands) takes 2.1 kWh of thermal energy. <sup id="fnref3:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> Conclusion: the daily energy use of the Forum Baths equals that of 557 showers.

The data I use are a rough estimation based on numbers that I found on internet forums and websites.

<p>This is especially true in Western Europe, where opposition grew so strong that the bathhouse eventually disappeared in some regions between the sixteenth and the nineteenth century. <sup id="fnref8:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup> The reasons for the temporal demise of bathing in Western Europe - a unique event in world history - are controversial among historians. Some point to the pressure of the Catholic and Protestant church, who increasingly perceived the medieval stews as places of immorality and sin. <sup id="fnref1:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">59</a></sup> Others see the cause in epidemics, or point to changing medical views - doctors no longer considered hot water and steam healthy. <sup id="fnref9:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup> Opposition started even before organized religion appeared. Ancient Roman philosopher Seneca was critical of the larger Roman baths and wrote several rants against them. He complained about the noise in the thermae, and accused them of extravagance and hedonism. See, for example: Moral letters to Lucilius by Seneca. Letter 86. On Scipio&rsquo;s villa. <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Moral_letters_to_Lucilius/Letter_86">https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Moral_letters_to_Lucilius/Letter_86</a>&#160;<a href="#fnref:58" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>In Ancient Rome, some bathhouses allowed mixed bathing, while others separated male and female bathers. Prostitution was legal, but the fact that a man&rsquo;s wife had bathed with other men was a legitimate reason for divorce. <sup id="fnref9:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup> In Muslim Spain, substantial fines were assessed to men who either slipped into the bathhouse on days assigned to women, or who were caught spying through the windows of the structure. Women risked their legal rights if they did the same. Abusing a woman in a bathhouse, even verbally, carried the death penalty. See: Powers, James F. &ldquo;Frontier municipal baths and social interaction in thirteenth-century Spain.&rdquo; The American Historical Review 84.3 (1979): 649.667. In the Low Countries during the middle ages, authorities distinguished &ldquo;honest&rdquo; from &ldquo;dishonest&rdquo; stews. To maintain the quality of the &ldquo;honest&rdquo; bathhouses, they abolished, mixed bathing, set rules for bathmaids, and made prostitution in the bathhouse illegal. <sup id="fnref10:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>&#160;<a href="#fnref:59" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a>&#160;<a href="#fnref1:59" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt that public bathhouses were a vector in historical epidemics. Medical tracts even advised against visiting the bathhouse. However, almost all baths remained open, very likely because they were seen as a service too essential to withdraw. At least, that was the case in the medieval Low Countries and in the Roman Empire, see: <sup id="fnref11:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup><sup id="fnref2:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>&#160;<a href="#fnref:60" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Moreover, the hypocaust was further improved in the middle ages, meaning that it could be made even more energy efficient than in Roman times.

<p>For example, researchers at the University of Stuttgart have devised a hybrid storage system consisting of a pressurized water and steam tank that serves as a storage for solar energy. The steam can be released in a sauna anytime, while the water serves to heat the space. See: Schaefer, M., et al. &ldquo;Development of a zero-energy-sauna: Simulation study of thermal energy storage.&rdquo; Energy and Buildings 256 (2022): 111659.  <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378778821009439">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378778821009439</a>. A very low-tech example is &ldquo;Solauna&rdquo;, which works with solar heat alone, basically by building a very large and well-insulated solar box cooker. See: <a href="https://www.biopiscinas.pt/en/solar-sauna/">https://www.biopiscinas.pt/en/solar-sauna/</a>. &ldquo;Lytefire&rdquo; creates heat and steam by sunlight from mirrors concentrated on a metal plate or a bag of stones.

<p>See: <a href="https://www.designboom.com/architecture/bao-split-bathhouse/">https://www.designboom.com/architecture/bao-split-bathhouse/</a>. Another example is a bathhouse in Eastern Iran, built in 2004, which runs on two solar collector fields (195 m2 total) and two thermally insulated storage tanks (3m3 each). The facility supplies hot water for twelve showers and four baths, serving the hot water demands of 150 people per day.
