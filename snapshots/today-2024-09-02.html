<p>date: 2024-09-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>In New York, aspiring fashion designers often attend colleges like
the Fashion Institute of Technology or Parsons School of Design. But for
those without the means or access to higher education, a Harlem-based
fashion incubator – a company that helps new fashion designers grow and
learn the business – is providing alternative paths to the industry.

in Shanghai, Chinese bookstore reopens in Washington</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — A Chinese bookstore reopened in Washington on Sunday,
six years after the Chinese government forced it to close its doors in
Shanghai.</p>
<p>JF Books was teeming with books — and customers — when it opened its
doors in Washington’s Dupont Circle neighborhood. In the storefront, the
shop’s name is displayed in English and Mandarin in neon green lights.
The sporadic rain was perhaps fitting considering the bookstore’s
namesake “jifeng” means “monsoon” in Mandarin.</p>
<p>The bookstore is located next to Kramers, an indie bookstore that has
been a Washington fixture for decades. Yu Miao, who runs JF Books, says
he hopes his bookstore becomes an institution for the local community,
too.</p>
<p>“I hope the bookstore can establish a connection between people in
the Chinese community, and this connection could be established through
knowledge,” Yu told VOA shortly before the shop opened for business.
“Also, I hope the bookstore’s function can go beyond the Chinese
community. It can also contribute to the local community.”</p>
<p>The shop sells Chinese-language books from Mainland China, Hong Kong
and Taiwan, in addition to a selection of English-language books. It
will also regularly host speakers for events.</p>
<p>Founded in Shanghai in 1997 as Jifeng Bookstore, the shop ran into
trouble in 2017 when its landlord said the lease couldn’t be extended.
The bookstore looked for a new location, but the prospective landlords
at each potential site received warnings or notifications from the
government.</p>
<p>Jifeng Bookstore is one of several independent bookstores that
Beijing has forced to close in recent years.</p>
<p>The fact that bookstores have become a battleground underscores the
Chinese government’s broader repression of free expression and crackdown
on anything deemed to be critical of the government, according to Sophie
Richardson, the former China director at Human Rights Watch.</p>
<p>“[Chinese President] Xi Jinping and his government have clearly
targeted a great deal of hostility at scholars,” Richardson told VOA at
the bookstore. “Their books are regarded as potential threats, and so
the party does what the party knows how to do, which is to send people
into exile, to send them to jail, to shut down bookstores.”</p>
<p>China’s Washington embassy did not immediately reply to VOA’s email
requesting comment for this story.</p>
<p>Gesturing at the throngs of people who were looking at books about
everything from Chinese history to science, Richardson, who is now a
visiting scholar at Stanford, added that there is a clear hunger for
Chinese books.</p>
<p>“It’s amazing to see this clear demand for this kind of material in
an environment where people can get it free of fear of persecution,” she
said.</p>
<p>That’s another reason why Yu wanted to reopen the bookstore: It can
be difficult to find Chinese-language books in the United States, he
said. “And so, I think there must be many others that have the same
concern,” he said.</p>
<p>When Jifeng Bookstore closed its doors in 2018, Yu never expected it
to reopen.</p>
<p>“I thought it was closed, then its story ended,” Yu said. “I never
imagined to reopen the bookstore.”</p>
<p>Now, JF Books has joined a rising number of independent Chinese
bookstores that are being opened by members of the diaspora in cities
around the world. They sell books and hold discussions about politics
and history in a way that the Chinese government has stifled inside
China.</p>
<p>JF Books already has scheduled three speakers for September. Howard
Shen, a graduate student at Georgetown University, told VOA that he’s
especially excited about the upcoming events.</p>
<p>“It’s such a big thing in the Chinese speaking community in D.C. We
are all very excited to have this bookstore. It’s such a meaningful
place for all Chinese in the world who love freedom,” said Shen, who is
from Taiwan. </p>
<p>One corner of the store features farewell messages that customers
wrote back when the store was forced to shutter in 2018. Leading up to
the bookstore’s second floor, photos on the wall memorialize the
bookstore’s two-decade history in Shanghai. At the top of the staircase,
photos show the bookstore’s final day in 2018.</p>
<p>“Jifeng Bookstore will soon depart from Shanghai,” the caption of one
photo reads, “but the monsoon will continue to blow.”</p>

id="us-prioritizes-deterrence-over-denuclearization-on-north-korea-experts-say">US
prioritizes deterrence over denuclearization on North Korea, experts
say</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — As North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs become
increasingly sophisticated, U.S.-based experts see the United States
shifting the focus of its diplomacy from the pursuit of denuclearization
of the Korean Peninsula to one of deterrence. </p>
<p>Officially, the U.S. State Department insists that denuclearization
remains the primary goal of the United States and South Korea, a policy
that is unlikely to change regardless of the outcome of the November
U.S. presidential election. </p>
<p>But in a series of email interviews with VOA Korean, more than half a
dozen experts said they saw scant hope that North Korean leader Kim Jong
Un could be persuaded to give up his growing nuclear arsenal and that
the U.S. must concentrate instead on seeing that it is never used.  </p>
<p>“I think, in practical terms, most Americans believe we have little
choice at this point but to prioritize deterrence, at least for the
foreseeable future,” said Michael O’Hanlon, director of foreign policy
research at the Brookings Institution in Washington, in an email to VOA
Korean this week.  </p>
<p>Robert Peters, research fellow for nuclear deterrence and missile
defense at the Heritage Foundation, told VOA Korean via email that
American politicians on both sides of the political spectrum are
questioning whether North Korea would even consider abandoning its
nuclear weapons. </p>
<p>“I think there is little appetite in either political party to seek
denuclearization with North Korea, given the failures of the late
2010s,” Peters said, referring to the collapse of the nuclear talks
between former U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim
Jong Un, who met three times in 2018 and 2019. </p>
<p>“I think all sides recognize that Kim will not give up nuclear
weapons at any price.”  </p>
<p>Shifting priorities </p>
<p>Negotiations over North Korea’s nuclear program between Washington
and Pyongyang have been nearly nonexistent since October 2019. </p>
<p>Peters added, “Bottom line — without question, the ground has shifted
regarding how we think about the North Korean nuclear threat.”  </p>
<p>Gary Samore, former White House coordinator for arms control and
weapons of mass destruction during the Obama administration, said
Washington’s shift in direction was inevitable. </p>
<p>“The U.S. government has been forced to place more emphasis on
deterrence over denuclearization because Kim Jong Un has shown no
willingness to negotiate a nuclear deal or even meet with the U.S. to
discuss denuclearization,” Samore told VOA Korean via email. </p>
<p>“Instead, North Korea has continued to advance its nuclear and
missile program, and the U.S. has responded by strengthening military
cooperation with the ROK and Japan, including joint efforts to enhance
extended deterrence.” </p>
<p>ROK stands for Republic of Korea, the official name of South Korea.
 </p>
<p>Denuclearization of North Korea is now viewed in Washington as a
“mission impossible,” said Bruce Bennett, a senior defense analyst at
the RAND Corporation. </p>
<p>“I think it is fair to say that the U.S. government is now more
focused on deterrence, which is largely succeeding, than on
denuclearization,” Bennett told VOA Korean via email. </p>
<p>“This change does not mean that the U.S. and ROK have abandoned
trying to negotiate for denuclearization, which North Korea steadfastly
refuses to do, but rather that our governments no longer see
denuclearization as a viable solution to the North Korean nuclear weapon
threat.” </p>
<p>Markus Garlauskas, director of the Indo-Pacific Security Initiative
at the Atlantic Council, told VOA Korean via email it was “fully
appropriate” that Washington has been paying more attention in recent
years to deterring North Korean aggression than attempting to negotiate
denuclearization. </p>
<p>“I have long argued that Kim Jong Un does not intend to give up his
nuclear weapons, that the nuclear weapons and missile capabilities of
North Korea have grown and will continue to grow, meaning that we in the
United States and its allies must adjust our strategy and policy
accordingly,” he said. </p>
<p>“We should not let hopes of negotiations get in the way of making
tough decisions to improve deterrence,” added Garlauskas, who served as
the U.S. national intelligence officer for North Korea from 2014 to
2020. </p>
<p>He stressed, however, that “accepting the reality that North Korea is
nuclear-armed and will remain so while under Kim Jong Un’s leadership”
does not mean that the U.S. should or would give up denuclearization as
a goal. </p>
<p>“Our principled stand can and should remain that North Korea must
comply with U.N. Security Council resolutions by halting its nuclear and
ballistic missile programs and relinquishing its nuclear weapons, and I
do think there is still broad agreement on that in Washington,”
Garlauskas said. </p>
<p>Commitment to denuclearization </p>
<p>Sydney Seiler, who until last year was the national intelligence
officer for North Korea on the U.S. National Intelligence Council, said
the U.S. should keep denuclearization as a priority, adding that
“denuclearization and deterrence are not mutually exclusive.” </p>
<p>“We have a responsibility on a day-by-day basis to deter provocative
actions, coercion, blackmail and even possible invasion by North Korea
and have been doing so for the last 70 years of armistice,” said Seiler,
who is now a senior adviser on Korean affairs at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies. </p>
<p>“Successfully ensuring deterrence does not mean abandoning the goal
of the denuclearization of North Korea,” he told VOA Korean via
email. </p>
<p>Robert Abrams, a retired U.S. Army four-star general who served as
commander of U.S. Forces Korea from 2018 to 2021, emphasized that a
strategy of deterrence should be clearly differentiated from the goal of
denuclearization. </p>
<p>“The U.S. strategic deterrent was never about stopping the North
Korean regime from developing their own nukes,” Abrams told VOA Korean
in an August 20 email. </p>
<p>“Sanctions and diplomatic efforts were intended to stop North Korea’s
nuclear program. The strategic deterrent is to deter North Korea from
ever using nuclear weapons, and that has obviously been very
successful.” </p>
<p>Officially, Washington reiterates that denuclearization of North
Korea remains a goal of the U.S.-South Korea alliance. </p>
<p>“The United States and the ROK continue to pursue the shared
objective of the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,” a
State Department spokesperson told VOA Korean via email this week. “We
believe that the only effective way to reduce nuclear threats on the
peninsula is by curbing the proliferation of nuclear weapons.” </p>
<p>But the spokesperson stressed that deterrence was also a crucial
element of U.S. policy toward North Korea. </p>
<p>“At the same time, the United States and the ROK will continue
working together to strengthen extended deterrence in the face of
increasingly aggressive DPRK rhetoric about its nuclear weapons
program,” the spokesperson said. </p>
<p>He added that the 16-month-old Washington Declaration “reinforces the
fact that any nuclear attack by [North Korea] against [South Korea] will
be met with a swift, overwhelming and decisive response from the United
States.” </p>
<p>In April 2023, U.S. President Joe Biden and South Korean President
Yoon Suk Yeol adopted the Washington Declaration, which outlines a
series of measures to deter North Korea’s nuclear weapons use.</p>

<h2 id="at-us-theme-parks-halloween-celebrations-start-in-summer">At US
theme parks, Halloween celebrations start in summer</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>los angeles, california — Halloween has arrived earlier than ever at
major U.S. theme parks, as operators such as Disney, Six Flags, and
Universal Studios seek to expand their reach and build on consumers’
love of spooky costumes and scares. </p>
<p>Theme park operators have introduced a range of attractions, live
performances, merchandise and food and beverages in August — before
summer has ended and well before the October 31 holiday — to take
advantage of the surging popularity of Halloween. These holiday-themed
efforts come at a time when domestic theme park attendance has slumped,
following a surge in demand after COVID.  </p>
<p>Edithann Ramey, chief marketing officer at Six Flags, told Reuters
that the theme parks saw attendance gains and increases in guest
spending in 2023 when it introduced attractions based on the horror
films “SAW” and “The Conjuring.” </p>
<p>The offerings were so successful that the theme park company has been
investing more in Halloween experiences, Ramey said. </p>
<p>“It’s become this time of the year that’s grown in explosive ways,”
Ramey said. “It’s become a billion-dollar industry in the last five
years.”</p>
<p>Jakob Wahl, chief executive for the International Association of
Amusement Parks and Attractions, said Halloween has become one of the
strongest selling points for parks that cater to young people and
families.  </p>
<p>“We actually see a growth every year in terms of Halloween events,
not only North America, but across the world,” Wahl said.  </p>
<p>Disney starts season in August</p>
<p>Walt Disney’s parks started the Halloween season earlier than ever
this year with “Mickey’s Not So Scary Party” beginning on August 9 and
running through the end of October.  </p>
<p>The Oogie Boogie Bash, a separately ticketed event named for the
“Nightmare Before Christmas” villain, sold out this year in 11 days,
Disney said. Its popularity prompted the company to push the release
date to August 25 from September 5. </p>
<p>“We’ve seen from our guests in years past that there’s a demand for
them to come and enjoy that season with us,” said Tracy Halas, creative
director of Disney Live Entertainment.  </p>
<p>Six Flags also kicks off Halloween early this year, on September 14,
with a new experience called “Saw: Legacy of Terror” celebrating the
20th anniversary of the “SAW” horror movie franchise.  </p>
<p>Following the $8 billion merger of Six Flags and former rival Cedar
Fair, which created the nation’s largest amusement park operator, with
42 parks across 17 states, Six Flags is increasing its investment in
Halloween.  </p>
<p>That includes adding Hollywood-themed experiences to Six Flags Fright
Fest based on Netflix’s science fiction series, “Stranger Things,” as
well as horror films “Texas Chainsaw Massacre,” and “The Conjuring.”</p>
<p>Universal adds ‘Ghostbusters’ haunted house </p>
<p>Comcast-owned Universal Studios 2024 Halloween Horror Nights in
Orlando runs from August 30 to November 3, the longest season they’ve
ever had. The company did not immediately respond to a Reuters request
for comment. </p>
<p>Universal is adding a “Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire” haunted house to
its Halloween programming alongside the first attraction inspired by
horror franchise, “A Quiet Place.”  </p>
<p>Universal also aims to attract guests at Universal Studios Japan with
a new 4D show in collaboration with the anime television series
“Chainsaw Man.”  </p>
<p>Both Universal Orlando and Japan will add cast members dressed as the
antagonists called Death Eaters to haunt Diagon Alley during Horror
Nights.  </p>
<p>Disney villain Cruella de Vil hosted a “Let’s Get Wicked” celebration
at Hong Kong Disneyland in 2022, which received an industry award and
returns this year.</p>

<p>date: 2024-09-02, from: Blog by Fabrizio Ferri-Benedetti</p>
<p>
I’ve recently found out about
<a href="https://typespec.io/">TypeSpec</a>, a new language aimed at
describing web APIs, through
<a href="https://nordicapis.com/api-design-in-the-post-openapi-era/">an
interview</a> that bears the provocative title of <em>API Design in the
Post-OpenAPI Era</em>. Leaving aside the fact that OpenAPI is very much
alive, what left me stupefied was the assertion that OpenAPI files
should be “automatically generated artifacts and nothing more”. After
digging a bit, I found the picture to be slightly more reassuring, but
still quite representative of a world that keeps steering away from
human-driven design to bury itself in curly brackets paradises. A
regression, rather than progress, if you ask me.

id="california-lawmakers-approve-laws-banning-deepfakes-regulating-ai">California
lawmakers approve laws banning deepfakes, regulating AI</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Sacramento, California — California lawmakers approved a host of
proposals this week aiming to regulate the artificial intelligence
industry, combat deepfakes and protect workers from exploitation by the
rapidly evolving technology.</p>
<p>The California Legislature, which is controlled by Democrats, is
voting on hundreds of bills during its final week of the session to send
to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s desk. Their deadline is Saturday.</p>
<p>The Democratic governor has until Sept. 30 to sign the proposals,
veto them or let them become law without his signature. Newsom signaled
in July he will sign a proposal to crack down on election deepfakes but
has not weighed in on other legislation.</p>
<p>He warned earlier this summer that overregulation could hurt the
homegrown industry. In recent years, he often has cited the state’s
budget troubles when rejecting legislation that he would otherwise
support.</p>
<p>Here is a look at some of the AI bills lawmakers approved this
year.</p>
<p>Combating deepfakes</p>
<p>Citing concerns over how AI tools are increasingly being used to
trick voters and generate deepfake pornography of minors, California
lawmakers approved several bills this week to crack down on the
practice.</p>
<p>Lawmakers approved legislation to ban deepfakes related to elections
and require large social media platforms to remove the deceptive
material 120 days before Election Day and 60 days thereafter. Campaigns
also would be required to publicly disclose if they’re running ads with
materials altered by AI.</p>
<p>A pair of proposals would make it illegal to use AI tools to create
images and videos of child sexual abuse. Current law does not allow
district attorneys to go after people who possess or distribute
AI-generated child sexual abuse images if they cannot prove the
materials are depicting a real person.</p>
<p>Tech companies and social media platforms would be required to
provide AI detection tools to users under another proposal.</p>
<p>Setting safety guardrails</p>
<p>California could become the first state in the nation to set sweeping
safety measures on large AI models.</p>
<p>The legislation sent by lawmakers to the governor’s desk requires
developers to start disclosing what data they use to train their models.
The efforts aim to shed more light into how AI models work and prevent
future catastrophic disasters.</p>
<p>Another measure would require the state to set safety protocols
preventing risks and algorithmic discrimination before agencies could
enter any contract involving AI models used to define decisions.</p>
<p>Protecting workers</p>
<p>Inspired by the monthslong Hollywood actors strike last year,
lawmakers approved a proposal to protect workers, including voice actors
and audiobook performers, from being replaced by their AI-generated
clones. The measure mirrors language in the contract the SAG-AFTRA made
with studios last December.</p>
<p>State and local agencies would be banned from using AI to replace
workers at call centers under one of the proposals.</p>
<p>California also may create penalties for digitally cloning dead
people without consent of their estates.</p>
<p>Keeping up with the technology</p>
<p>As corporations increasingly weave AI into Americans’ daily lives,
state lawmakers also passed several bills to increase AI literacy.</p>
<p>One proposal would require a state working group to consider
incorporating AI skills into math, science, history and social science
curriculums. Another would develop guidelines on how schools could use
AI in the classrooms.</p>

id="wall-street-week-ahead-us-stock-rally-broadens-as-investors-await-fed">Wall
Street Week Ahead — US stock rally broadens as investors await Fed</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — A broadening rally in U.S. stocks is offering an
encouraging signal to investors worried about concentration in
technology shares, as markets await key jobs data and the Federal
Reserve’s expected rate cuts in September.</p>
<p>As the market’s fortunes keep rising and falling with big tech stocks
such as Nvidia NVDA.O and Apple AAPL.O, investors are also putting money
in less-loved value stocks and small caps, which are expected to benefit
from lower interest rates. The Fed is expected to kick off a
rate-cutting cycle at its monetary policy meeting on Sept. 17-18.</p>
<p>Many investors view the broadening trend, which picked up steam last
month before faltering during an early August sell-off, as a healthy
development in a market rally led by a cluster of giant tech names.
Chipmaker Nvidia, which has benefited from bets on artificial
intelligence, alone has accounted for roughly a quarter of the S&amp;P
500’s year-to-date gain of 18.4%.</p>
<p>“No matter how you slice and dice it you have seen a pretty
meaningful broadening out and I think that has legs,” said Liz Ann
Sonders, chief investment officer at Charles Schwab.</p>
<p>Value stocks are those of companies trading at a discount on metrics
like book value or price-to-earnings and include sectors such as
financials and industrials. Some investors believe rallies in these
sectors and small caps could go further if the Fed cuts borrowing costs
while the economy stays healthy.</p>
<p>The market’s rotation has recently accelerated, with 61% of stocks in
the S&amp;P 500 .SPXoutperforming the index in the past month, compared
to 14% outperforming over the past year, Charles Schwab data showed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the so-called Magnificent Seven group of tech giants —
which includes Nvidia, Tesla TSLA.O and Microsoft MSFT.O — have
underperformed the other 493 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 by 14 percentage
points since the release of a weaker-than-expected U.S. inflation report
on July 11, according to an analysis by BofA Global Research.</p>
<p>Stocks have also held up after an Nvidia forecast failed to meet
lofty investor expectations earlier this week, another sign that
investors may be looking beyond tech. The equal weight S&amp;P 500
index, a proxy for the average stock, hit a fresh record [last] week and
is up around 10.5% year-to-date, narrowing its performance gap with the
S&amp;P 500.</p>
<p>“When market breadth is improving, the message is that an increasing
number of stocks are rallying on expectations that economic conditions
will support earnings growth and profitability,” analysts at Ned David
Research wrote.</p>
<p>Value stocks that have performed well this year include General
Electric GE.N and midstream energy company Targa Resources TRGP.N, which
are up 70% and 68%, respectively. The small-cap focused Russell 2000
index, meanwhile, is up 8.5% from its lows of the month, though it has
not breached its July peak.</p>
<p>The jobs report “tends to be one of the more market moving releases
in general, and right now it’s going to get even more attention than
normal.”</p>
<p>Investors are unlikely to turn their back on tech stocks,
particularly if volatility gives them a chance to buy on the cheap, said
Jason Alonzo, a portfolio manager with Harbor Capital.</p>
<p>Technology stocks are expected to post above-market earnings growth
over every quarter through 2025, with third-quarter earnings coming in
at 15.3% compared with a 7.5% gain for the S&amp;P 500 as a whole,
according to LSEG data.</p>
<p>“People will sometimes take a deep breath after a nice run and look
at other opportunities, but technology is still the clearest driver of
growth, particularly the AI theme which is innocent until proven
guilty,” Alonzo said.</p>

Clooney, Brad Pitt disappointed their new film skips cinemas</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Venice, Italy — Hollywood heavyweights George Clooney and Brad Pitt
admit they are disappointed their latest comedy “Wolfs” is not getting a
broad cinema release and instead heading almost straight onto Apple
TV.</p>
<p>“It is a bummer,” Clooney said on Sunday, adding that television
streamers, such as Apple, were nevertheless vital to the future of
filmmaking, presenting actors with opportunities and generating bigger
audiences for their work.</p>
<p>“Streaming, we need it, our industry needs this,” he said.</p>
<p>Written and directed by Jon Watts, “Wolfs” is an old-fashioned crime
caper with Clooney and Pitt playing lone-wolf professional fixers who
are forced to work together with comically unfortunate consequences.</p>
<p>Apple originally signaled it would place the film in a large number
of cinemas before the TV release, but instead opted to show it briefly
in a restricted number of U.S. movie theatres and then run it on its
global TV service.</p>
<p>“We’ll always be romantic about the theatrical experience. At the
same time, I love the existence of the streamers because we get to see
more story, we get to see more talent, it gets more eyes,” said Pitt.
“It’s a delicate balance right now and it’ll right itself.”</p>
<p>Asked what it meant if two of the biggest names in the business could
not get a broad cinema release, as they had requested, Clooney quipped:
“Clearly we’re declining.”</p>
<p>Sixteen years after last appearing together in 2008’s Coen brothers’
comedy “Burn After Reading,” Pitt and Clooney said they jumped at the
chance to reunite when they read Watts’ script for “Wolfs.”</p>
<p>“I got to say, just as I get older, just working with the people that
I just really enjoy spending time with has really become important to
me,” said Pitt, who turned 60 last year.</p>
<p>In a news conference full of light-hearted banter, Clooney, said
Pitt, was fortunate still to be offered parts. “He’s 74 years-old and
he’s very lucky at this age to still be working.”</p>
<p>On a more serious note, he denied a New York Times story in August
that said both he and Pitt had been paid more than $35 million each to
appear in the film.</p>
<p>“I’m only saying that because I think it’s bad for our industry if
that’s what people think is the standard bearer for salaries. I think
that’s a terrible thing. It will make it impossible to make a film,” he
said.</p>
<p>“Wolfs” is showing out of competition at the Venice Film Festival,
which runs until Sept. 7.</p>

<p>date: 2024-09-01, from: OS News</p>
<p>Telegram doesn’t hold up to the promise of being private, nor secure.
The end-to-end encryption is opt-in, only applies to one-on-one
conversations and uses a controversial ‘homebrewn’ encryption algorithm.
The rest of this article outlines some of the fundamentally broken
aspects of Telegram. ↫ h3artbl33d Telegram is not a secure messenger,
nor is it a platform you should want to be on. Chats are not encrypted
by default, and are stored in plain text on Telegram’s server. Only
chats between two (not more!) people who also happen to both be online
at that time can be “encrypted”. In addition, the quotation marks
highlight another massive issue with Telegram: its “encryption” is
non-standard, home-grown, and countless security researchers have warned
against relying on it. Telegram’s issues go even further than this,
though. The application also copies your contacts to its servers and
keeps them there, they’ve got a “People nearby” feature that shares
location data, and so much more. The linked article does a great job of
listing the litany of problems Telegram has, backed up by sources and
studies, and these alone should convince anyone to not use Telegram for
anything serious. And that’s even before we talk about Telegram’s utter
disinterest in stopping the highly illegal activities that openly take
place on its platform, from selling drugs, down to far more shocking and
dangerous activities like sharing revenge pron, CSAM, and more. Telegram
has a long history of not giving a single iota about shuttering groups
that share and promote such material, leaving victims of such heinous
crimes out in the cold. Don’t use Telegram. A much better alternative is
Signal, and hell, even WhatsApp, of all things, is a better choice.</p>

<p>date: 2024-09-01, from: OS News</p>
<p>If you’re reading this, you did a good job surviving another month,
and that means we’ve got another monthly update from the Servo project,
the Rust-based browser engine originally started by Mozilla. The major
new feature this month is tabbed browsing in the Servo example browser,
as well as extensive improvements for Servo on Windows.
Servo-the-browser now has a redesigned toolbar and tabbed browsing! This
includes a slick new tab page, taking advantage of a new API that lets
Servo embedders register custom protocol handlers. ↫ Servo’s blog Servo
now runs better on Windows, with keyboard navigation now
fixed, –output to PNG also fixed, and fixes for some font- and
GPU-related bugs, which were causing misaligned glyphs with incorrect
colors on servo.org and duckduckgo.com, and corrupted images on
wikipedia.org. Of course, that’s not at all, as there’s also the usual
massive list of improved standards support, new APIs, improvements to
some of the developer tools (including massive improvements in Windows
build times), and a huge number of fixed bugs.</p>

<p>date: 2024-09-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — Does American tennis have a pickleball problem?</p>
<p>Even as the U.S. Open opened this week with more than a million fans
expected for the sport’s biggest showcase, the game’s leaders are being
forced to confront a devastating fact — the nation’s fastest-growing
racket sport (or sport of any kind) is not tennis but pickleball, which
has seen participation boom 223% in the past three years.</p>
<p>“Quite frankly, it’s obnoxious to hear that pickleball noise,” U.S.
Tennis Association President Dr. Brian Hainline grumbled at a recent
state-of-the-game news conference, bemoaning the distinctive pock, pock,
pock of pickleball points.</p>
<p>Pickleball, an easy-to-play mix of tennis and ping pong using paddles
and a wiffleball, has quickly soared from nearly nothing to 13.6 million
U.S. players in just a few years, leading tennis purists to fear a day
when it could surpass tennis’ 23.8 million players. And most troubling
is that pickleball’s rise has often come at the expense of thousands of
tennis courts encroached upon or even replaced by smaller pickleball
courts.</p>
<p>“When you see an explosion of a sport and it starts potentially
eroding into your sport, then, yes, you’re concerned,” Hainline said in
an interview with The Associated Press. “That erosion has come in our
infrastructure. … A lot of pickleball advocates just came in and said,
‘We need these tennis courts.’ It was a great, organic grassroots
movement but it was a little anti-tennis.”</p>
<p>Some tennis governing bodies in other countries have embraced
pickleball and other racket sports under the more-the-merrier belief
they could lead more players to the mothership of tennis. France’s
tennis federation even set up a few pickleball courts at this year’s
French Open to give top players and fans a chance to try it out.</p>
<p>But the USTA has taken a decidedly different approach. Nowhere at the
U.S. Open’s Billie Jean King National Tennis Center is there any such
demonstration court, exhibition match or any other nod to pickleball or
its possible crossover appeal.</p>
<p>In fact, the USTA is flipping the script on pickleball with an
ambitious launch of more than 400 pilot programs across the country to
broaden the reach of an easier-to-play, smaller-court version of tennis
called “red ball tennis.” Backers say it’s the ideal way for people of
all ages to get into tennis and the best place to try it is (wait for
it) on pickleball courts.</p>
<p>“You can begin tennis at any age,” USTA’s Hainline said. “We believe
that when you do begin this great sport of tennis, it’s probably best to
begin it on a shorter court with a larger, low-compression red ball.
What’s an ideal short court? A pickleball court.”</p>
<p>And instead of the plasticky plink of a pickleball against a flat
paddle, Hainline said, striking a fuzzy red tennis ball with a stringed
racket allows for a greater variety of strokes and “just a beautiful
sound.” Players can either stick with red ball tennis or advance through
a progression of bouncier balls to full-court tennis.</p>
<p>“Not to put it down,” Hainline said of pickleball, “but compared to
tennis … seriously?”</p>
<p>So what does the head of the nation’s pickleball governing body have
to say about such comments and big tennis’ plans to plant the seeds of
its growth, at least in part, on pickleball courts?</p>
<p>“I don’t like it but there is so much going on with pickleball, so
many good things, I’m going to stick to what I can control, harnessing
the growth and supporting this game,” said Pickleball USA CEO Mike
Nealy.</p>
<p>Among the positive signs, Nealy said, is the continuing construction
of new pickleball courts across the country, raising the total to more
than 50,000. There’s also growing investment in the game at clubs built
in former big-box retail stores, pro leagues with such backers as Tom
Brady, LeBron James and Drake, and the emergence of “dink-and-drink”
establishments that tap into the social aspect of the game by allowing
friends to enjoy pickleball, beer, wine and food under the same
roof.</p>
<p>“I don’t think it needs to be one or the other or a competition,”
Nealy said of pickleball and tennis. “You’re certainly going to have the
inherent frictions in communities when tennis people don’t feel that
they’re getting what they want. … They’re different games but I think
they are complimentary. There’s plenty of room for both sports to be
very successful.”</p>
<p>Top-ranked American tennis player Taylor Fritz agreed. “There are
some people in the tennis world that are just absolute pickleball
haters, and that’s fine. But for me, I don’t really have an issue with
pickleball. I like playing sometimes. … I don’t see any reason why both
of them can’t exist.”</p>

rattlesnakes at Colorado ‘mega den’ make their live debut</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CHEYENNE, Wyoming — A “mega den” of hundreds of rattlesnakes in
Colorado is getting even bigger now that late summer is here and babies
are being born.</p>
<p>Thanks to livestream video, scientists studying the den on a craggy
hillside in Colorado are learning more about these enigmatic — and often
misunderstood — reptiles. They’re observing as the youngsters, called
pups, slither over and between adult females on lichen-encrusted
rocks.</p>
<p>The public can watch too on the Project RattleCam website and help
with important work including how to tell the snakes apart. Since
researchers put their remote camera online in May, several snakes have
become known in a chat room and to scientists by names including
“Woodstock,” “Thea” and “Agent 008.”</p>
<p>The live feed, which draws as many as 500 people at a time online, on
Thursday showed a tangle of baby snakes with tiny nubs for rattles. They
have a lot of growing to do: A rattlesnake adds a rattle segment each
time it sheds its skin a couple times a year, on average.</p>
<p>The project is a collaboration between California Polytechnic State
University in San Luis Obispo, snake removal company Central Coast Snake
Services and Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>By involving the public, the scientists hope to dispel the idea that
rattlesnakes are usually fierce and dangerous. In fact, experts say they
rarely bite unless threatened or provoked and often are just the
opposite. </p>
<p>Rattlesnakes are not only among the few reptiles that care for their
young. They even care for the young of others. The adults protect and
lend body heat to pups from birth until they enter hibernation in
mid-autumn, said Max Roberts, a CalPoly graduate student researcher.</p>
<p>“We regularly see what we like to call ‘babysitting,’ pregnant
females that we can visibly see have not given birth, yet are kind of
guarding the newborn snakes,” Roberts said Wednesday.</p>
<p>As many as 2,000 rattlesnakes spend the winter at the location on
private land, which the researchers are keeping secret to discourage
trespassers. Once the weather warms, only pregnant females remain while
the others disperse to nearby territory.</p>
<p>This year, the scientists keeping watch over the Colorado site have
observed the rattlesnakes coil up and catch water to drink from the cups
formed by their bodies. They’ve also seen how the snakes react to birds
swooping in to try to grab a scaly meal.</p>
<p>The highlight of summer is in late August and early September when
the rattlesnakes give birth over a roughly two-week period.</p>
<p>“As soon as they’re born, they know how to move into the sun or into
the shade to regulate their body temperature,” Roberts said.</p>
<p>There are 36 species of rattlesnakes, most of which inhabit the U.S.
They range across nearly all states and are especially common in the
Southwest. Those being studied now are prairie rattlesnakes, which can
be found in much of the central and western U.S. and into Canada and
Mexico.</p>
<p>Like other pit viper species but unlike most snakes, rattlesnakes
don’t lay eggs. Instead, they give birth to live young. Eight is an
average-size brood, with the number depending on the snake’s size,
according to Roberts.</p>
<p>Roberts is studying how temperature changes and ultraviolet sunlight
affect snake behavior. Another graduate student, Owen Bachhuber, is
studying the family and social relationships between rattlesnakes.</p>
<p>The researchers watch the live feed all day.</p>
<p>“We are interested in studying the natural behavior of rattlesnakes,
free from human disturbance. What do rattlesnakes actually do when we’re
not there?” Roberts said.</p>
<p>Now that the Rocky Mountain summer is cooling, some males have been
returning. By November, the camera running on solar and battery power
will be turned off until next spring, when the snakes will re-emerge
from their “mega den.”</p>

transfers ‘some aircraft’ used by former Afghan army to Uzbekistan</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The United States has handed over to the Uzbek
government possession of aircraft that former Afghan air force personnel
flew to Uzbekistan after the Taliban takeover of Kabul in 2021.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the U.S. State Department told VOA on Thursday
that the ownership of “some aircraft” was transferred to Uzbekistan as
part of the Department of Defense’s Excess Defense Articles program.</p>
<p>“This transfer was agreed in the context of our strong bilateral
cooperation on counterterrorism, counternarcotics and enhanced border
security,” the spokesperson told VOA in an email, without saying how
many aircraft were transferred to the Uzbek government.</p>
<p>The fate of aircraft that were flown to Uzbekistan after the fall of
Afghanistan into the hands of the Taliban has been a bone of contention
between the Taliban and Uzbekistan for three years.</p>
<p>Afghan air force personnel flew about 46 aircraft — 22 military
planes and 24 helicopters — to Uzbekistan as the government in
Afghanistan collapsed in the face of the Taliban’s advances in August
2021.  </p>
<p>The Taliban, who consider the aircraft to be Afghan property,
objected to the handover of the aircraft to Uzbekistan.</p>
<p>“The Ministry of Defense [of the Taliban] clearly declares that the
United States has no right to donate or confiscate the property of the
Afghan people,” the spokesperson of the Taliban’s Ministry of Defense
said in an audio message sent to media this week.</p>
<p>The Taliban spokesperson also called on Uzbekistan to make a
“reasonable decision” to return the aircraft to the Taliban.</p>
<p>Local media in Uzbekistan reported last week that the U.S. ambassador
said the aircraft had already been transferred.</p>
<p>Tashkent has not commented yet on the transfer. However, Uzbek
authorities previously said that the aircraft belonged to the United
States because the U.S. government paid for them and that it would not
return the military equipment to the Taliban.</p>
<p>Tashkent-Taliban relations</p>
<p>Alisher Hamidov, an expert on Central Asia, told VOA that the
transfer of aircraft to Uzbekistan may complicate the relations between
Tashkent and the Taliban.</p>
<p>“The situation with the planes may now endanger Uzbekistan’s
diplomatic relations,” he said, adding that Tashkent has been playing
mediator between Kabul and other countries over the past three
years.</p>
<p>“The main goal was to bring Afghanistan [Taliban] to the
international arena, restore relations and, of course, strengthen
Uzbekistan’s economy and foreign policy,” Hamidov added.</p>
<p>Uzbekistan has cultivated close relations with the Taliban, though it
does not officially recognize the Taliban’s government in
Afghanistan.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the Taliban’s deputy prime minister, Abdul Ghani
Baradar, attended the inauguration ceremony of the Termez International
Trade Center in Uzbekistan’s border town of Termez.</p>
<p>On August 17, the prime minister of Uzbekistan, Abdulla Aripov,
visited Kabul and signed 35 trade and investment agreements valued at
$2.5 billion.</p>

id="tens-of-thousands-protest-in-israel-as-netanyahu-vows-to-settle-the-score-with-hamas">Tens
of thousands protest in Israel, as Netanyahu vows to ‘settle the score’
with Hamas</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>JERUSALEM — Tens of thousands of Israelis protested in the streets
Sunday night, chanting “Now! Now!” as they demanded that Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu reach a cease-fire with Hamas after six more hostages
were found dead in Gaza.</p>
<p>Thousands of people gathered outside Netanyahu’s office in Jerusalem.
In Tel Aviv, hostages’ relatives marched with coffins to symbolize the
death toll.</p>
<p>“We really think that the government is making these decisions for
its own conservation and not for the lives of the hostages, and we need
to tell them, ‘Stop!’” Shlomit Hacohen, a Tel Aviv resident, told The
Associated Press.</p>
<p>The protest appeared to be the largest such demonstration in nearly
11 months of war.</p>
<p>Earlier Sunday, Netanyahu vowed to intensify the fight with Hamas
after the Israeli military recovered the bodies of six hostages, all of
whom were apparently shot to death by the militants just as troops were
zeroing in on their location in Gaza.</p>
<p>“Those who kill hostages do not want an agreement” for a Gaza
cease-fire, Netanyahu said in a statement, telling Hamas leaders, “We
will hunt you down, we will catch you and we will settle the score.”</p>
<p>A military spokesperson, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, told reporters
in a briefing, “According to our initial estimation, they were brutally
murdered by Hamas terrorists a short time before we reached them.” They
were found in a tunnel in the southern city of Rafah.</p>
<p>By evening, grieving and angry Israelis surged into the streets,
chanting, “Now! Now!” and demanding that Netanyahu reach a cease-fire
with Hamas to bring the remaining hostages home and halt nearly 11
months of fighting in Gaza.</p>
<p>Israel’s largest trade union, the Histadrut, called a general strike
for Monday to try to bring economic pressure on the government. The
strike is expected to shut down or disrupt major sectors of the economy,
including banking, health care and the country’s main airport.</p>
<p>Netanyahu also accused Hamas of carrying out a shooting attack
earlier Sunday that killed three police officers near the city of Hebron
in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Hamas has not claimed responsibility
for the attack but called it a “heroic operation by the resistance.”</p>
<p>Netanyahu said, “We are fighting on all fronts against a cruel enemy
who wants to murder us all. The fact that Hamas continues to commit
atrocities such as those it committed on October 7 obliges us to do
everything we can to ensure that it can no longer do so.”</p>
<p>The Israeli military said the West Bank attackers fired at a vehicle
at the checkpoint near Hebron. “Security forces have begun to search for
the terrorists,” it said in a statement.</p>
<p>While the fighting in Gaza and the West Bank remained at the
forefront, “humanitarian pauses” were started at several locations in
Gaza so that the U.N. agency for Palestinians and the World Health
Organization could start vaccinating 640,000 children under the age of
10 over the next several days against the threat of polio.</p>
<p>The disease was recently detected in Gaza for the first time in 25
years.</p>
<p>An Israeli military spokesman, Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, told CNN’s
“State of the Union” show that Israeli forces are continuing to search
tunnels near where the bodies of the hostages were found, only a
kilometer from where a living hostage, Qaid Farhan Alkadi, a member of
the Bedouin community in southern Israel, was rescued last week.</p>
<p>Oma Neutra, the mother of another hostage, Omer Neutra-Oma, said on
CNN, “It’s time for the leaders to get this done,” to reach a cease-fire
to halt nearly 11 months of fighting in Gaza precipitated by the October
7 Hamas attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and led to the capture
of about 250 hostages.</p>
<p>“Enough is enough,” she said.</p>
<p>The Israeli counteroffensive has killed nearly 41,000 Palestinians in
Gaza, most of them women and children, according to Gaza health
officials, while the Israeli military says the death toll includes
several thousand Hamas combatants.</p>
<p>Israel says it believes 101 Israeli and foreign hostages remain in
Gaza, but about one-third of them is believed to be dead, while the fate
of the others is not known.</p>
<p>Senior Hamas officials said that Israel, in its refusal to sign a
cease-fire agreement, was to blame for the newest deaths.</p>
<p>“Netanyahu is responsible for the killing of Israeli prisoners,”
senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri told Reuters. “The Israelis should
choose between Netanyahu and the deal.”</p>
<p>Hamas has offered to release the hostages in return for an end to the
war, the withdrawal of Israeli forces and the release of dozens of
Palestinian prisoners, including high-profile militants, jailed by
Israel.</p>
<p>The Hostage Families Forum called on Netanyahu to take responsibility
and explain what was holding up an agreement.</p>
<p>“They were all murdered in the last few days, after surviving almost
11 months of abuse, torture, and starvation in Hamas captivity. The
delay in signing the deal has led to their deaths and those of many
other hostages,” it said.</p>
<p>Defense Minister Yoav Gallant called on the government to reverse a
decision last Thursday to keep Israeli forces in the Philadelphi
Corridor along the border with Egypt, a key point of contention in
negotiations for a cease-fire in Gaza.</p>
<p>“The Cabinet must gather immediately and reverse the decision made on
Thursday,” Gallant said in a statement. “We must bring back the hostages
that are still being held by Hamas.” Gallant and Netanyahu got into a
shouting match over the corridor issue, but other security officials
sided with Netanyahu.</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden, who has closely followed the fate of the
hostages, said the six bodies found in the Gaza tunnel included Israeli
American Hersh Goldberg-Polin. Biden said he was “devastated and
outraged.”</p>
<p>“Hamas leaders will pay for these crimes. And we will keep working
around the clock for a deal to secure the release of the remaining
hostages,” he said in a statement.</p>
<p>Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee,
said she and her husband, Doug Emhoff, spoke to Goldberg-Polin’s
parents, Jon and Rachel, to express their condolences.</p>
<p>“My heart breaks for their pain and anguish,” Harris said. “I told
them: As they mourn this terrible loss, they are not alone. Our nation
mourns with them.”</p>
<p>Some material in this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters
and Agence France-Presse.</p>

id="family-confirms-death-of-israeli-american-hostage-hersh-goldberg-polin">Family
confirms death of Israeli-American hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>JERUSALEM — The family of Israeli-American hostage Hersh
Goldberg-Polin announced the young man’s death early Sunday, ending a
relentless campaign by his parents to rescue him that included meetings
with world leaders and an address to the Democratic convention last
month.</p>
<p>Goldberg-Polin, 23, was seized by militants at a music festival in
southern Israel on October 7. The native of Berkeley, California, lost
part of his left arm to a grenade in the attack. In April, a
Hamas-issued video showed him, his left hand missing and clearly
speaking under duress, sparking new protests in Israel urging the
government to do more to secure his and others’ freedom.</p>
<p>Israel’s announcement is bound to bring urgent new calls for Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to reach a deal to bring home remaining
hostages. The Israeli leader has taken a tough line in negotiations and
repeatedly said that military pressure is needed to bring home the
hostages. According to Israeli media, he has feuded with top security
officials who have said a deal should be reached urgently.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden, who had met with the parents, said he was
“devastated and outraged.”</p>
<p>“It is as tragic as it is reprehensible,” he said. “Make no mistake,
Hamas leaders will pay for these crimes. And we will keep working around
the clock for a deal to secure the release of the remaining
hostages.”</p>
<p>The family issued a statement early Sunday, hours after the Israeli
army said it had located bodies in Gaza.</p>
<p>“With broken hearts, the Goldberg-Polin family is devastated to
announce the death of their beloved son and brother, Hersh,” it said.
“The family thanks you all for your love and support and asks for
privacy at this time.”</p>
<p>There was no immediate comment from the army, details on the exact
circumstances of his death or identities of other bodies recovered.</p>
<p>Asked about the case earlier on Saturday, Biden said bodies were
still being identified and that families were being notified. But he
called for an end to the war and said cease-fire efforts were
progressing.</p>
<p>“I think we’re on (the) verge of having an agreement,” he said as he
left church in Delaware. “It’s just time to end. It’s time to finish
it.”</p>
<p>Goldberg-Polin’s parents, U.S.-born immigrants to Israel, became
perhaps the most high-profile relatives of hostages on the international
stage. They met with Biden, Pope Francis and others and addressed the
United Nations, urging the release of all hostages.</p>
<p>On August 21, his parents addressed a hushed hall at the Democratic
National Convention — after sustained applause and chants of “bring him
home.”</p>
<p>“This is a political convention. But needing our only son — and all
of the cherished hostages — home is not a political issue. It is a
humanitarian issue,” said his father, Jon Polin. His mother, Rachel, who
bowed her head during the ovation and touched her chest, said “Hersh, if
you can hear us, we love you, stay strong, survive.”</p>
<p>Both wore stickers with the number 320, representing the number of
days their son had been held. It had long become part of a morning
ritual — tear a new piece of tape, write down another day.</p>
<p>“I find it so remarkable how nauseating it is every single time,’’
Rachel Goldberg-Polin told The Associated Press in January, ahead of the
100-day mark.”And it’s good. I don’t want to get used to it. I don’t
want anybody to get used to the fact that these people are
missing.’’</p>
<p>She asked other people around the world to take up the ritual, too,
not only for her son, who moved to Israel with his family when he was 7,
but for the other hostages and their families.</p>
<p>She and her husband sought to keep their son and the others held from
being reduced to numbers, describing Hersh as a music and soccer lover
and traveler with plans to attend university since his military service
had ended. At events she often addressed her son directly in the hope he
could hear her, urging him to live another day.</p>
<p>Some 250 hostages were taken on October 7. Before the military’s
announcement of the latest discovery of bodies, Israel said it believed
108 hostages were still held in Gaza and about one-third of them were
dead. In late August, the Israeli military recovered the bodies of six
hostages in southern Gaza.</p>
<p>Eight hostages have been rescued by Israeli forces, the most recent
found on Tuesday. Most of the rest were freed during a weeklong
cease-fire in November in exchange for the release of Palestinians
imprisoned by Israel.</p>
<p>Two previous Israeli operations to free hostages killed scores of
Palestinians. Hamas says several hostages have been killed in Israeli
airstrikes and failed rescue attempts. Israeli troops mistakenly killed
three Israelis who escaped captivity in December.</p>
