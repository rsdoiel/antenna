## eBPF from Go - IV - Code generation

date: 2024-10-28, from: Miek Giebin blog

Played more with TinyGo, but it always generates code for (minimal) reflection - i.e. the reflect package, because it requires that for its map implementation. I could skip or not generate that, but then that would mean using a map would be &hellip; weird? Anyhow it looked that even TinyGo does too much for eBPF. So plan D: generate eBPF code (and Go code) using Go. Cilium has done a lot of work in this regard.
