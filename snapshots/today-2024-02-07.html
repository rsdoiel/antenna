id="stars-athletes-plan-to-flock-las-vegas-for-super-bowl-events">Stars,
Athletes Plan to Flock Las Vegas for Super Bowl Events</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — Las Vegas will be flooded with so many pre- Super Bowl
events that Shaquille O’Neal lowered the prices to his popular
carnival-themed “Shaq’s Fun House.”</p>
<p>Instead of raising the rate, O’Neal decided to offer potential
attendees more bang for their buck to the NBA legend’s sixth annual
event planned for Friday in Sin City. He made the decision to lower the
rates after purchasing an expensive suite at the Formula One that cost
nearly five times more than normal to watch the racing event in Las
Vegas last year.</p>
<p>“We’re not going to do that to the people,” said O’Neal, who said the
going rate for Fun House starts at $99 but will increase as the event
nears. He’ll bring back Lil Wayne, Diplo and himself under his name DJ
Diesel to perform during his over-the-top festival — which features
several attractions including a Ferris wheel, circus performers and
premium bar.</p>
<p>“We could’ve done $200, $250 or $300,” said O’Neal whose event will
take place XS Nightclub at the Wynn — a hotel that will host Rob
Gronkowski ’s Gronk Beach in Encore on Saturday afternoon and Sports
Illustrated’s The Party in XS Nightclub later that night. “But I don’t
like taking advantage of people. We want to have the best party with the
best rides, performers and just hanging out.”</p>
<p>Along with O’Neal’s event, the days leading up to the Super Bowl
between the Kansas City Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers will include
concerts from some of the biggest stars including Travis Scott, Green
Day, Killer Mike, Kelly Clarkson, Ice Spice, Future and David Guetta.
The week will include some comedy too.</p>
<p>Here’s a look at some of the invite-only and public events during a
busy Super Bowl week:</p>
<p>Fanatics Party</p>
<p>Michael Rubin is known for his exclusive summer bashes in the
Hamptons — which bring out stars like Beyoncé, Jay-Z, Leonardo DiCaprio,
Jennifer Lopez, Ben Affleck and Kendall Jenner.</p>
<p>Now, Rubin, the founder and CEO of Fanatics, will host his
invite-only daytime event at Marquee Dayclub at the Cosmopolitan the day
before the Super Bowl. His event will feature performances by Travis
Scott, The Chainsmokers, Ice Spice, A$AP Ferg, Meek Mill, Lil Baby,
Fabolous, Ludacris, Ne-Yo and Kid Laroi.</p>
<p>Madden Bowl</p>
<p>After Killer Mike collected three Grammys during his arrest-shortened
night, the Atlanta-based rapper is expected to be one of the performers
at the EA Sports’ The Madden Bowl.</p>
<p>Rock group Green Day will headline the Friday night event at House of
Blues. It will also feature Big Boi of OutKast and Breland.</p>
<p>“Las Vegas isn’t ready for the show we’re about to bring,” Big Boi
said.</p>
<p>In addition to the music performances, the event will include the
Madden NFL 24 Championship Series in front of a live audience — where
two of the world’s best players will travel to Las Vegas for their share
of the $1 million prize pool and title of Ultimate Madden Bowl
champion.</p>
<p>Kevin Hart and O’Neal’s production companies will hold a
star-studded, stand-up comedy showcase.</p>
<p>Actor Deon Cole will host the two-night show called the All Star
Comedy Jam with performances by D.L. Hughley, Earthquake, Desi Banks and
Aida Rodriguez. The event will be held inside the Resorts World Theatre’
5,000-capacity venue on Friday and Saturday night.</p>
<p>Gospel Celebration</p>
<p>Cedric the Entertainer and Tichina Arnold will help bring the gospel
to Sin City.</p>
<p>The stars of the CBS show The Neighborhood will host the Super Bowl
Soulful Celebration at the Palms Casino Resort on Wednesday night. The
lineup includes some of gospel’s best from Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, Mary
Mary, Kirk Franklin, Robin Thicke and the NFL Players Choir including
Tully Banta-Cain and Bryan Scott, who played in the league.</p>
<p>“I want people to feel empowered walking away from this show,” Arnold
said. “You should never walk way feeling drained. You should walk way
feeling loved.”</p>
<p>CBS Mornings co-host Nate Burleson, a former NFL player, will receive
the Lifetime of Inspiration award. He will be the sixth person to
receive the honor the show’s 25-year history.</p>
<p>Previous recipients include Tony Dungy, Ray Lewis, Tim Brown, Troy
Vincent and Deion Sanders.</p>
<p>Gronk Beach</p>
<p>Despite being retired, Rob Gronkowski keeps making his presence felt
during the NFL’s championship week. </p>
<p>The four-time Super Bowl winner — who views himself the “MVP of Fun”
— will host a music festival called “Gronk Beach” the day before the big
game. The beach-themed party will feature a performance by DJ
Afrojack.</p>
<p>“It’s all about going there and having a good time. Just losing your
mind in a great and positive way,” Gronkowski said. “You can dance free,
be yourself freely and just enjoy yourself with great company around
you.”</p>
<p>Gronkowski placed his tickets starting at $74.</p>
<p>Billy Idol</p>
<p>Instead of riding his motorcycle on Super Bowl Sunday, Billy Idol
will be strolling on stage a few hours before kick off to perform during
a pre-game concert.</p>
<p>The legendary British rocker will perform Sunday just outside
Allegiant Stadium, where the NFL’s two best teams face off. He’s
expected to perform a 35-minute set on two different stages at On
Location’s Club 67 and Touchdown Club in front of nearly 9,000
guests.</p>
<p>Idol said he’s stoked about the setup being arranged by One Location
— a premium hospitality provider of the NFL. The hospitality company
offers various packages including Idol’s performance, attendance at NFL
Honors and postgame field access.</p>
<p>Maluma &amp; SiriusXM</p>
<p>Colombian superstar Maluma will take his vibrant Latin music vibes
into Las Vegas with the help of SiriusXM.</p>
<p>Maluma will headline a special concert at The Theater at Virgin
Hotels on Thursday night for SiriusXM subscribers and Pandora listeners.
He’s expected to perform songs from his latest album Don Juan including
Según Quién and COCO LOCO along with other fan favorites such as
Hawái.</p>
<p>Future and David Guetta are expected to perform at the invite-only
h.wood Homecoming Weekend pop up bash on Friday followed by another show
with Jack Harlow and Kaytranada performer the next night at a custom
venue on the Las Vegas Strip across from the Wynn.</p>
<p>On Saturday night, Zach Bryan will headline the Bud Light Backyard
Tour.</p>
<p>Tiësto will headline a show at LIV at Fontainebleau on Saturday while
21 Savage and 50 Cent are expected to perform the same night.</p>
<p>Lil Wayne will hit the stage once again but this time with T-Pain as
a co-headliner at the Alex Morgan and Dan Marino-hosted Michelob ULTRA
Country Club at Topgolf on Saturday night. Bryan and Leon Bridges will
perform at The Chelsea in The Cosmopolitan on Friday.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Guy Fieri will host his Guy’s Flavortown Tailgate, a free
and family-friendly event that he expects will draw more than 10,000.
Diplo will perform.</p>
<p>GQ will hold Super Bowl party Friday at the The Nomad Library and
sports agent Leigh Steinberg will host an event Saturday morning at
Ahern Luxury Boutique Hotel.</p>

Man Arrested in California for Theft of Trade Secrets</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — A Chinese-born U.S. researcher has been arrested on
charges of stealing trade secrets, including technology used to detect
nuclear missile launches, the Justice Department said Wednesday. </p>
<p>Chenguang Gong, 57, of San Jose, California, was arrested on Tuesday,
the department said in a statement.</p>
<p>Gong, who became a US citizen in 2011, is accused of transferring
more than 3,600 files from the research and development company where he
briefly worked to personal storage devices.</p>
<p>The company was not identified.</p>
<p>According to court documents, the files included blueprints for
infrared sensors used in space-based systems to detect nuclear missile
launches and track ballistic and hypersonic missiles.</p>
<p>The files also allegedly included blueprints for sensors designed to
enable U.S. military aircraft to detect heat-seeking missiles and take
countermeasures.</p>
<p>U.S. Attorney Martin Estrada said Gong “had previously sought to
provide the People’s Republic of China with information to aid its
military.”</p>
<p>“We know that foreign actors, including the PRC, are actively seeking
to steal our technology, but we will remain vigilant against this threat
by safeguarding the innovations of American businesses and researchers,”
Estrada said.</p>
<p>According to court documents, Gong worked at the unidentified company
from January 2023 to April 2023 as a circuit design manager for infrared
sensors.</p>
<p>The Justice Department said meanwhile that two Iranians have been
charged in another case involving sensitive technology.</p>
<p>Abolfazi Bazzazi, 79, and his son Mohammad Resa Bazzazi, 43, were
indicted in New York on charges of violating export laws by conspiring
between 2008 and 2019 to export equipment used in the aerospace industry
to Iran.</p>
<p>“The Bazzazis devised an intricate scheme to evade US export laws in
obtaining U.S. equipment and technology to be exported to Iran and for
the Government of Iran,” U.S. Attorney Breon Peace said.</p>
<p>“The defendants allegedly attempted to obtain commercial and military
aircraft items from multiple U.S. companies that supply the military,
aerospace and firefighting industries,” Peace said.</p>
<p>The Bazzazis reside in Iran and remain at large.</p>

id="mexico-overtakes-china-as-leading-source-of-goods-imported-to-us">Mexico
Overtakes China as Leading Source of Goods Imported to US</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — For the first time in more than two decades, Mexico last
year surpassed China as the leading source of goods imported to the
United States. The shift reflects the growing tensions between
Washington and Beijing as well as U.S. efforts to import from countries
that are friendlier and closer to home.</p>
<p>Figures released Wednesday by the U.S. Commerce Department show that
the value of goods imported to the United States from Mexico rose nearly
5% from 2022 to 2023, to more than $475 billion. At the same time, the
value of Chinese imports imports tumbled 20% to $427 billion.</p>
<p>The last time that Mexican goods imported to the United States
exceeded the value of China’s imports was in 2002.</p>
<p>Economic relations between the United States and China have severely
deteriorated in recent years as Beijing has fought aggressively on trade
and made ominous military gestures in the Far East.</p>
<p>The Trump administration began imposing tariffs on Chinese imports in
2018, arguing that Beijing’s trade practices violated global trade
rules. President Joe Biden retained those tariffs after taking office in
2021, making clear that antagonism toward China would be a rare area of
common ground for Democrats and Republicans.</p>
<p>As an alternative to offshoring production to China, which U.S.
corporations had long engaged in, the Biden administration has urged
companies to seek suppliers in allied countries (“friend-shoring’‘) or
to return manufacturing to the United States (“reshoring’‘).
Supply-chain disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic also led U.S.
companies to seek supplies closer to the United States
(“near-shoring’’).</p>
<p>Mexico has been among the beneficiaries of the growing shift away
from reliance on Chinese factories. But the picture is more complicated
than it might seem. Some Chinese manufacturers have established
factories in Mexico to exploit the benefits of the 3-year-old
U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement, which allows for duty-free trade in
North America for many products.</p>
<p>Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said this week that the
trade status gives Mexico new leverage, saying it would make it hard for
the U.S. to close the two countries’ border to limit immigration, as
suggested in negotiations on a border bill in the U.S. Senate.</p>
<p>“The negotiation is proposing closing the border,” he said. “Do you
think Americans, or Mexicans, but especially the Americans, would
approve that? The businesses wouldn’t take it, maybe one day, but not a
week.”</p>
<p>Some industries — especially auto manufacturers — have set up plants
on both sides of the border that depend on each for a steady supply of
parts.</p>
<p>Derek Scissors, a China specialist at the conservative American
Enterprise Institute, noted that the biggest drops in Chinese imports
were in computers and electronics and chemicals and pharmaceuticals —
all politically sensitive categories.</p>
<p>“I don’t see the U.S. being comfortable with a rebound in those areas
in 2024 and 2025,” Scissors said, predicting that the China-Mexico
reversal on imports to the United States likely “is not a one-year
blip.’’</p>
<p>Scissors suggested that the drop in U.S. reliance on Chinese goods
partly reflects wariness of Beijing’s economic policies under President
Xi Jinping. Xi’s draconian COVID-19 lockdowns brought significant swaths
of the Chinese economy to a standstill in 2022, and his officials have
raided foreign companies in apparent counterespionage
investigations.</p>
<p>“I think it’s corporate America belatedly deciding Xi Jinping is
unreliable,” he said.</p>
<p>Overall, the U.S. deficit in the trade of goods with the rest of the
world — the gap between the value of what the United States sells and
what it buys abroad — narrowed 10% last year to $1.06 trillion.</p>

<h2 id="beyond-the-1-mb-barrier-in-dos">Beyond the 1 MB barrier in
DOS</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-08, from: OS News</p>
<p>Last month, we covered Julio Merino’s article about going from 0 to 1
MB in DOS, and now they’re back for breaking beyond that 1 MB barrier. I
know I promised that this follow-up article would be about DJGPP, but
before getting into that review, I realized I had to take another detour
to cover three more topics. Namely: unreal mode, which I intentionally
ignored to not derail the post; LOADALL, which I didn’t know about until
you readers mentioned it; and DOS extenders, which I was planning to
describe in the DJGPP article but they are a better fit for this one.
So… strap your seat belts on and dive right in for another tour through
the ancient techniques that DOS had to pull off to peek into the memory
address space above the first MB. And get your hands ready because we’ll
go over assembly code for a step-by-step jump into unreal mode. ↫ Julio
Merino What’s amazing is that I don’t even remember having to deal with
any of this while using MS-DOS back in the day. Games tended to use DOS
extenders automatically (DOS/4G!), but I don’t remember if I ever had to
set up any of the DOS above-640k stuff manually.</p>

<h2
id="special-counsel-completes-biden-classified-documents-investigation">Special
Counsel Completes Biden Classified Documents Investigation</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The Justice Department special counsel investigating
President Joe Biden’s handling of classified documents has completed his
inquiry and is expected to make a report soon to Congress and the
public, Attorney General Merrick Garland told lawmakers in a letter
Wednesday. </p>
<p>Garland did not detail the conclusions of the report from special
counsel Robert Hur, but said he was committed to disclosing as much of
the document as possible once the White House completes a review for
potential executive privilege concerns. That process is expected to be
completed by the end of the week, said Ian Sams, a spokesman for the
White House counsel’s office. </p>
<p>The yearlong investigation centered on the improper retention of
classified documents by Biden from his time as a U.S. senator and as
vice president. Sensitive records were found at his Delaware home and at
a private office that he used in between his service in the Obama
administration and becoming president. </p>
<p>The resolution of the investigation arrives in a pivotal year for the
president as he pursues reelection in a deeply polarized political time.
Though the probe’s outcome is expected to lift a legal cloud over Biden,
criticism of his handling of classified records could blunt his ability
to attack Donald Trump - his presumptive opponent in November - over a
pending indictment charging the former president with hoarding
top-secret files at his Mar-a-Lago estate and obstructing FBI efforts to
get them back. </p>
<p>Challenge likely</p>
<p>Trump and other Republicans are likely to challenge the legitimacy of
the investigation by noting that it was launched by the Biden Justice
Department. </p>
<p>But Garland sought to insulate the department from claims of bias and
conflicts of interest by last year appointing Hur, a former U.S.
attorney for Maryland during the Trump administration, to handle the
Biden investigation and by naming a different special counsel, Jack
Smith, to oversee investigations into Trump. </p>
<p>While the Trump investigation resulted in dozens of felony charges
against the ex-president last year, the outcome of the Biden probe is
expected to be different. Justice Department policy prohibits the
indictment of a sitting president and, unlike in the Trump
investigation, no evidence has emerged to suggest that Biden engaged in
comparable conduct or willfully held on to records he wasn’t supposed to
have. </p>
<p>Even so, the White House’s response to the discovery of classified
documents early last year was delayed and incomplete. </p>
<p>The White House did not disclose the Justice Department’s
investigation until January 2023, when it acknowledged the discovery two
months earlier of a “small number” of classified documents by Biden
lawyers as they closed an office at the Penn Biden Center, a think tank
affiliated with the Ivy League school. Biden has said he was surprised
by the initial trove discovered by his lawyers. </p>
<p>The FBI subsequently conducted a 13-hour, top-to-bottom check of his
Wilmington, Delaware, home, where agents located documents with
classified markings from his time as a vice president and senator and
took possession of some of his handwritten notes. Biden’s personal
lawyers have also revealed that they had found a document bearing
classified markings while searching the Wilmington property but said
they had not found others during a separate inspection of his Rehoboth
Beach home. </p>
<p>The looming conclusion of the investigation had been foreshadowed
last fall when Biden sat for a voluntary interview at the White House
with Hur’s team. Interviews of key subjects in an investigation are
often done near the end. </p>
<p>Justice Department regulations require Congress to be notified of any
investigative steps or proposed actions by a special counsel that were
rejected by department leadership. There were no such actions, Garland
wrote.</p>

<h2 id="my-everything-everywhere-all-at-once-dream">My “Everything,
Everywhere, All at Once” Dream</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-08, from: Jessica Smith’s blog</p>
<p>
A few months ago I had this funny dream, which has come back into my
mind a few times since and I figure I might as well share. Basically I
was back at high school, but Penny Wong was our dictatorial principal,
and I was in her office getting castigated for something stupid
(probably shooting my mouth off in class; that would’ve been very
in-character for me at that time). Anyway, she assigned me to some
cleaning detail in punishment for what I’d done, which is where I think
you can see the influence of
<a href="https://www.jayeless.net/wiki/my-novel.html">my novel</a>
coming in because that’s a pretty standard punishment in the world of
that
story.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
So, there I was, miserably scrubbing windows and removing cobwebs and
whatnot, when I looked into one of the buildings and saw
<em>another</em> detention going on, an in-classroom detention, and who
should I see in detention but VIVIAN, my now-partner, mucking around
with some mates. But it wasn’t Vivian as I know him now, it was Vivian
as I’ve seen him in photos of his high school days, packing a bit too
much weight and sporting a crazy afro. So I decided to sneak away from
<em>my</em> detention, and went up to him in class, where he turned to
me with a blank, confused look in his eyes.
</p>
<p>
“You don’t know me in this universe, do you?” I asked.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” he said. “Uh, I mean, that’s correct, I don’t know you.” (This is
<em>exactly</em> how he answers negative tag questions in real life;
it’s so annoying.)
</p>
<p>
“Well,” I said, “in another universe, you know me <em>very</em> well.”
</p>
<p>
And I walked away again, leaving it at that. As I did, he kind of went
back to mucking around with his mates, but it was with half an eye on me
as I went, wondering what could’ve been.
</p>
<div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1">
<p>
Actually, I had one detention in year 12 where I was supposed to do
this, as well. I say “supposed to” because I was so annoyed I even HAD
detention (basically I’d been like ten seconds late to school, and then
five minutes later there was a fire drill and everyone had to congregate
outside, so if I’d come FIVE MINUTES LATE instead of TEN SECONDS no one
would’ve known I was late and I wouldn’t have been given a detention. I
remember venting my frustration to my classmates that I was being
PUNISHED for TRYING to be on time, which they found hilarious.) that I
just flat-out refused to do it, and the teacher was so thrown (I was
mostly a good kid, just a smart ass) that she just went, “Okay then,”
and let me. So not quite the way my dream turned out,
then. <a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a>

High Court to Hear Arguments on Trump’s Eligibility to Regain
Presidency</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The U.S. Supreme Court hears oral arguments Thursday
about whether likely Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is
ineligible for the office and must be excluded from states’ ballots
because of his role in the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S.
Capitol.</p>
<p>On that day, a mob of the former president’s supporters who believed
his rhetoric that the November 2020 election was stolen stormed the
Capitol to try to prevent lawmakers from certifying Joe Biden’s
victory.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, a federal appeals court rejected Trump’s claim
that he has “absolute immunity” from prosecution on criminal charges in
a separate election interference case, United States of America v.
Trump.</p>
<p>That case was brought by special counsel Jack Smith in U.S. District
Court in Washington, resulting in four indictments in connection with
Trump’s widespread efforts to overturn the 2020 election.</p>
<p>Trump is likely to also appeal this case to the Supreme Court. He
maintains the various criminal and civil lawsuits brought against him
are part of Biden’s “witch hunt” to eliminate a political opponent — a
claim the White House and Democrats deny.</p>
<p>Trump v. Anderson</p>
<p>Trump v. Anderson, to be brought before the Supreme Court on
Thursday, addresses whether Trump must be barred from participating in
the Colorado primary election under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment to
the U.S. Constitution.</p>
<p>The case began as Anderson v. Griswold, filed by Citizens for
Responsibility and Ethics in Washington on behalf of Norma Anderson, a
former Republican lawmaker in Colorado, with five other Republican and
independent voters, against Colorado Secretary of State Jena
Griswold.</p>
<p>Both cases look at whether Trump is an insurrectionist who tried to
stop the peaceful transfer of power and whether under Section 3 he
should be barred from holding office again.</p>
<p>Section 3 was written in 1866 after the end of the Civil War to keep
former Confederates — officials from the 11 Southern states that seceded
from the United States to protect the institution of slavery — from
returning to power.</p>
<p>It provides: “No person shall be a Senator or Representative in
Congress, or elector of President and Vice-President, or hold any
office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State,
who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an
officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature,
or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the
Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or
rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies
thereof. But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove
such disability.”</p>
<p>Trump’s lawyers argue that Section 3 does not apply to presidents,
that January 6 was not an insurrection, and that Trump was only
exercising his free-speech rights.</p>
<p>In November, a Colorado judge ruled that Trump engaged in
insurrection. But she ruled against blocking him from the state’s 2024
presidential primary ballot, finding that Section 3 did not apply to the
president. That part of her ruling was appealed and later reversed by
the Colorado Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Amicus briefs</p>
<p>Various scholars, election officials, lawmakers and other political
figures have filed amicus — “friend of the court” — briefs to share
their views in support of or against Trump.</p>
<p>One of them is Mark Graber, Regents professor at the University of
Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law and a leading expert in
constitutional law on insurrections and the 14th Amendment. His brief
argues that the Colorado Supreme Court’s ruling is consistent with how
the legal community understood insurrection at the time Section 3 was
framed, and that it correctly ruled an insurrection occurred.</p>
<p>“Donald Trump incited that insurrection,” Graber told VOA.</p>
<p>“He was told his tweets were inspiring violence against election
workers. He responded by intensifying his tweets. He was told there were
people in the crowd with weapons who intended to invade Congress. He
responded by saying, ‘When there’s fraud, you don’t use the usual means.
You fight — you fight like hell,’” he said. “A reasonable person could
say given Trump’s behavior, he intended to inspire an insurrection and
participate.”</p>
<p>In response to another central question in this case — whether the
14th Amendment applies to the president — Graber said the answer was
“obvious.”</p>
<p>“Every member of Congress who used the phrase ‘officer of the United
States’ in the 39th Congress said that the president was included,” he
underscored.</p>
<p>Others argue that enforcement of the 14th Amendment is for Congress
to determine, including Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita, who filed
a brief with 26 other Republican attorneys general.</p>
<p>“Section 3 is not self-executing textually,” he said during a
Wednesday event hosted by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think
tank. He argued that under Section 5 that provides, “Congress shall have
power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this
article,” lawmakers should determine how the 14th Amendment is to be
enforced.</p>
<p>Alan Dershowitz, Felix Frankfurter professor of law at Harvard Law
School who defended Trump during his Senate impeachment trial, supports
this argument.</p>
<p>“In the absence of congressional action, I don’t believe the 14th
Amendment is self-enforcing,” he told VOA. “Otherwise, why would you
need Article 5 of the 14th Amendment that explicitly gives Congress the
power to make these decisions?”</p>
<p>A group of 25 leading historians, including Allan J. Lichtman,
distinguished professor of history at American University, argued in
their brief that Section 3 covers Trump and does not “require another
act of Congress or a conviction” of insurrection.</p>
<p>Lichtman told VOA it’s clear that Section 3 is designed to guard
against “not just ex-Confederates but future insurrectionists.”</p>
<p>“They wanted an amendment that would last in perpetuity and couldn’t
be tampered with by future congresses because it’s part of the
Constitution,” Lichtman said.</p>
<p>Legal questions aside, the American people should have the right to
choose their president, not judges, said Rokita. “Voters will lose all
confidence if judges decide that voters cannot even consider one of our
nation’s two leading presidential candidates,” he warned.</p>
<p>Far-reaching impact</p>
<p>Although the Supreme Court will only decide on the Colorado case, the
impact would be far-reaching, including for the state of Maine, whose
secretary of state ruled in December that Trump should be taken off the
state’s primary ballot, and pending cases in 11 other states that
challenge his electoral eligibility, as well as others in the
future.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court could uphold the Colorado ruling, which would be a
devastating blow to Trump’s reelection bid. Or it could rule that Trump
cannot be disqualified under Section 3 and put him back on the
ballot.</p>
<p>The justices could also decline to make a final decision and leave it
to lawmakers - for example, let Congress decide whether to certify
Trump’s victory should he win in November.</p>
<p>Six of the nine Supreme Court justices were appointed by Republican
presidents, including three by Trump. But since the question has almost
no legal precedent, it’s difficult to predict the justices’ individual
rulings based on their ideology.</p>
<p>It will be difficult for the justices to “contradict the historical
evidence,” said Lichtman. However, given the political magnitude, the
Supreme Court is likely to “take a technical off-ramp” and “punt on this
issue.”</p>
<p>Dershowitz agreed, predicting the justices would either “say the 14th
Amendment just doesn’t apply absent congressional action, or they will
figure out some way of putting off the ultimate issue.”</p>
<p>He underscored the importance of a unanimous decision by the Supreme
Court.</p>
<p>“A split decision would keep the country very divided,” he said.
“That means we’re likely to see a narrow decision that doesn’t decide
broad issues.”</p>
<p>It is unclear how long the Supreme Court will take to rule. In the
coming months, the high court also will likely deliberate on Trump’s
appeal of the election interference case prosecuted by Smith, which was
rejected Tuesday by a federal appeals court.</p>

id="journalists-criticize-tucker-carlson-over-putin-interview">Journalists
Criticize Tucker Carlson Over Putin Interview</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Former Fox News anchor Tucker Carlon’s announcement on
Tuesday that he interviewed Russian President Vladimir Putin has been
met with disapproval from an array of journalists, some of whom say the
Kremlin may use the interview for propaganda purposes.</p>
<p>In a video posted on the social media platform X, Carlson said he
wanted to interview the longtime Russian leader because “Americans have
a right to know all they can about a war they are implicated in.”</p>
<p>In mid-March, Russia is set to hold presidential elections, which
Putin is all but guaranteed to win. Putin likely agreed to the interview
with Carlson because he thinks it will help his campaign, according to
Mikhail Rubin, deputy editor-in-chief of the Russian investigative
outlet Proekt Media.</p>
<p>Carlson “needs to understand that he’s a part of the presidential
election campaign, and he’s going to help [Putin], unfortunately,” Rubin
told VOA.</p>
<p>Rubin added that Carlson’s interview is likely to be used to paint
Moscow in a positive light.</p>
<p>“The most important is to show that Putin is open and that American
journalists can work inside Russia because Russia is an open and free
country,” Rubin said.</p>
<p>But that narrative is plainly false, said Rubin, who fled the country
in 2021 for safety reasons.</p>
<p>“If I go to Russia, as far as I understand, I will be arrested the
next day,” said Rubin, who is now based in Washington. “I’m not sure
that I will ever see my father again.”</p>
<p>Other Russian journalists shared similar critiques on social
media.</p>
<p>“I am like hundreds of Russian journalists who have had to go into
exile to keep reporting about the Kremlin’s war against Ukraine. The
alternative was to go to jail,” said Russian journalist Yevgenia Albats
on X. Meanwhile, Carlson was “shooting from the $1,000 Ritz suite in
Moscow,” she said.</p>
<p>Carlson also drew criticism for appearing to ignore the poor state of
press freedom in Russia, which has led to the arrests of scores of
reporters inside the country and forced many others into exile.</p>
<p>“Quite something to complain about how not enough American
journalists are reporting on the Russian side of Putin’s invasion of
Ukraine when two of them — Evan Gershkovich and Alsu Kurmasheva — are in
jail right now for doing just that,” Max Seddon, Moscow bureau chief for
the Financial Times, said in a post on X.  </p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal’s Gershkovich was arrested in March 2023 on
espionage charges that he, his employer and the U.S. government
vehemently deny.</p>
<p>Kurmasheva, an editor at VOA’s sister outlet Radio Free Europe/Radio
Liberty, was jailed in October 2023 and is facing charges for failing to
register as a “foreign agent” and spreading false information about the
Russian military. She and her employer reject the charges.</p>
<p>Besides Kurmasheva and Gershkovich, at least 20 other journalists
were jailed in Russia as of the end of 2023, according to data from the
Committee to Protect Journalists.</p>
<p>Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the interview was recorded on
Tuesday.</p>
<p>The interview will likely be published Thursday, according to the
Wall Street Journal. Carlson said it will be uploaded live and unedited
to X, where he launched a show after he was abruptly fired from the
conservative channel Fox News last year.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The right-wing television personality hosted a prime-time show on Fox
News from 2016 until his firing in 2023. Carlson’s departure came
shortly after Fox News agreed to pay over $787 million to Dominion
Voting Systems to settle a defamation lawsuit over false election
claims, many of which Carlson himself propagated.</p>
<p>The Tucker Carlson Network did not immediately reply to VOA’s email
requesting comment.</p>
<p>After accusing U.S. media of “fawning pep session” interviews with
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Carlson went on to claim that
“not a single Western journalist has bothered to interview the president
of the other country in this conflict, Vladimir Putin.”</p>
<p>Journalists took to social media to criticize that claim, as
well.</p>
<p>“Does Tucker really think we journalists haven’t been trying to
interview President Putin every day since his full-scale invasion of
Ukraine?” CNN’s Christiane Amanpour said in a post on X. “It’s absurd —
we’ll continue to ask for an interview, just as we have for years
now.”</p>
<p>Even the Kremlin fact-checked that claim from Carlson.</p>
<p>“No, Mr. Carlson is wrong. In fact, he cannot know this,” Peskov, the
spokesperson, said, adding that the Kremlin receives many requests for
interviews with Putin.</p>

Drone Strike in Iraq Kills Iran-Backed Militant Group Commander</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Pentagon — The United States military says it carried out a drone
strike on a vehicle in Baghdad, killing a leader of an Iranian-backed
militant group.</p>
<p>U.S. Central Command, which oversees U.S. military operations in the
Middle East, said the strike on Tuesday killed a commander of the
militant group Kataib Hezbollah who was “responsible for directly
planning and participating in attacks on U.S. forces in the region.”</p>
<p>Two U.S. officials confirmed to VOA that the commander was operations
officer Wisam Mohammad al-Saedi. Photos on social media allegedly showed
his Iraqi identification card that was pulled from his body.</p>
<p>VOA had earlier reported the United States military was involved in
an airstrike against a high-value target in the Middle East but had not
identified al-Saedi by name.</p>
<p>Video shared on social media showed a vehicle engulfed in flames on a
Baghdad highway.</p>
<p>The U.S. strike was in response to the almost 170 drone, rocket and
missile attacks against U.S. forces in the Middle East since
mid-October, one of which killed three U.S. service members and wounded
dozens more in northern Jordan last week.</p>
<p>A wave of U.S. airstrikes in Iraq and Syria on Friday pounded targets
associated with Iranian-backed militias responsible for the attacks. The
strikes targeted three locations in Iraq, as well as another four in
Syria, and they destroyed more than 80 individual targets, ranging from
command-and-control centers and intelligence hubs to missile and drone
storage facilities, according to the latest U.S. assessments.</p>
<p>But while U.S. officials have defended the strikes as necessary
following a drone attack that killed three U.S. soldiers at a base in
Jordan last month, Iraqi officials have voiced increased anger,
summoning the U.S. chargé d’affaires in Baghdad to protest. They have
charged that some of the U.S. strikes hit elements of Iraq’s own
security forces.</p>
<p>The U.S. State Department said Monday that Iraq was not given any
warning but added the U.S. strikes should not have come as a
surprise.</p>
<p>Pentagon press secretary Major General Pat Ryder said Monday the U.S.
had no plans for a long-term military campaign against the militias in
Iraq and Syria, but he noted the U.S. response to the killing of its
service members was “not complete.”</p>
<p>The U.S. has about 2,500 troops in Iraq tasked with advising and
assisting Iraqi security forces as they pursue the remnants of the
Islamic State terror group, also known as ISIS or Daesh.</p>
<p>And while talks between the U.S. and Iraq are underway to eventually
reduce the U.S. military footprint and transition from the counter-IS
mission to what officials describe as more traditional
military-to-military relationship with Baghdad, the process has been
complicated by the attacks.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Iranian-backed Houthi militants once again ignored U.S.
calls to stop attacking international shipping lanes or face
consequences, this time firing six anti-ship missiles from
Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen into the Red Sea and the Gulf of
Aden.</p>
<p>U.S. Central Command said late Tuesday that one of the missiles
caused minor damage to the Marshall Islands-flagged, Greek
owned-and-operated bulk carrier MV Star Nasia in the Gulf of Aden, while
another missile landed in the water near the ship. U.S. forces shot down
a third missile in the area.</p>
<p>There were no reported injuries, and the ship was able to continue
toward its destination, CENTCOM said in a statement.</p>
<p>In the southern Red Sea, CENTCOM said three missiles likely targeting
the Barbados-flagged, U.K.-owned cargo ship MV Morning Tide landed in
the water without causing any damage.</p>
<p>The latest Houthi launches came as an unclassified Defense
Intelligence Agency report released Tuesday confirmed that Houthi
militants in Yemen were using various missiles and drones of Iranian
origin in its recent attacks across the region. The report compares
publicly available images of Iranian weapons to those employed by the
Houthis and highlights the strengthening relationship between the
Houthis and Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.</p>
<p>Earlier Tuesday, the U.S. military said it conducted its latest
self-defense strikes against two Houthi kamikaze drone boats that were
laden with explosives.</p>
<p>CENTCOM, which oversees U.S. forces in the region, said the vessels
“presented an imminent threat to U.S. Navy ships and merchant vessels in
the region.”</p>
<p>The Houthis have said their Red Sea attacks are in solidarity with
the people of Gaza and have vowed to continue them, despite the U.S. and
British strikes.</p>

<h2 id="apple-killed-music-on-the-move-for-me">2024-02-07 Apple killed
music on the move, for me</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-07, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
2024-02-07 Apple killed music on the move, for me
</h1>
<p>
I was thinking about joining the
<a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/cool-tech-zone/tangara">Tangara</a>
crowdfunding. It’s a kind of iPod, but better in that it is all open.
Yay!
</p>
<p>
But then I realized something: Having an iPhone made listening to music
such a shit show that I basically stopped and switched my entire
phone-based audio entertainment to podcasts. Because podcast clients are
great (at least <a href="https://icatcher.app/about/">iCatcher</a> is)
where as Apple Music is a pain. Having used iTunes when it was cool
until it was unusable, and then realizing what a pain the weird AAC
formats on the files were, and the DRM on some of them, preventing me
from playing them on other machines I owned. I was so angry.
</p>
<p>
In a fit of hate I decided I was going to
<a href="2019-07-08_Apple_Photos">move all my pictures out of
iPhotos</a> and all my music out of iTunes and never go back. And I did.
And so the Apple Music app died, and I guess no alternatives were
allowed on the App Store because Apple is great like that, and so when
the iPod classic I had with
<a href="2017-12-21_Rockbox_on_the_iPod">Rockbox</a> installed
<a href="2022-11-18_iPod%2C_iPad%2C_iPhone%2C_iPiss">finally died</a>,
all I was left with was podcasts on the iPhone.
</p>
<p>
And so now I don’t even know whether I want to listen to music any more
while I’m on the move.
</p>
<p>
Apple killed music on the move, for me.
</p>
<p>
At home it’s a different story, of course, but Tangara is a portable
music player.
</p>
<p>
I wish Tangara the best of luck.

a Chinese company known for its burly electric bikes,</a> surprised many
in the snowboarding community when it announced its
<a href="https://electrek.co/2023/12/17/cyrusher-ripple-are-electric-snowboards-going-to-be-a-thing/">electric
snowboard in December</a>. Part snowboard and part
snowmobile/e-skateboard/scooter, the Cyrusher Ripple mounts a jagged 3kW
hub motor-wheel in a rear hole on a snowboard and puts the battery in a
backpack that the rider must wear. Cyrusher states that the Ripple can
go 30+ miles at speeds up to 30 miles per hour.

To our surprise, they actually had some review models and sent us one
that we took up to Vermont to put through the paces. Would it actually
work, and more importantly, would it be a fun form of transportation?

<p>Social networks and RSS. We really should be on the case for all
social media networks to support RSS feeds outbound at least (inbound
nice too). And also add features to make interop really useful. I’ve
enumerated them <a href="https://textcasting.org/">here</a>. I am making
software that builds on this feature in social networks. And yes we do
have some examples of that, thinking of WordPress and competitors. I
think they are perfectly good bases for social networks.</p>

<p>I went skiing today at
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belleayre_Mountain">Belleayre</a>.
First time in five years. It was great. I’ve been working out to get
ready for it, and was concerned maybe I’m finally too old, but it’s
good. My body remembers how to ski. And being in shape makes the
difference. No doubt at some point I will be too old for it. But not
yet. And the snow was really good, for the east. Packed powder, very
little ice. No lift lines. Sometimes a little crowded on the slopes but
about the same as any ski area in the west. It pays to go on weekdays if
you can. Here’s a

<h2 id="why-you-may-soon-be-getting-more-air-quality-alerts">Why You May
Soon Be Getting More Air Quality Alerts</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-07, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTQwNjM0OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1OTU3NDUwOH0.pOaylM8OV6uqh03-QBKJZQMFePVOAAYm2mhTQZYizEE/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
The Environmental Protection Agency finalized new air pollution rules on
Wednesday, strengthening standards that had not been updated in over a
decade. Somewhat counterintuitively, the change could mean that even as
the air gets cleaner, you might get more air quality alerts.
</p>
<p>
As part of the rule change, the EPA updated its Air Quality Index, that
colorful scale that many Americans grew
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/wildfire-smoke-aqi-eyewatering-acres" target="_self">intimately
familiar with</a> last summer, as wildfire smoke went from being a West
Coast problem to a hazard for almost the entire country, seemingly
overnight.
</p>
<p>
The AQI is both easy to interpret, with a color code that goes from a
healthy green to a perilous purple, and esoteric. The colors correspond
with numbers from zero to upwards of 300, and those numbers correspond
with measures of five different pollutants — particulate matter, ozone,
carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide.
</p>
<p>
The Clean Air Act tasks the EPA with
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/criteria-air-pollutants/naaqs-table" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">setting
standards</a> for each of these pollutants. If local concentrations of
any one of them tick up above those protective standards, the AQI will
jump from green to a more alarming color. The higher the level of
pollution is, the higher the AQI and the darker the color will be.
</p>
<p>
Previously, the EPA’s annual standard for concentrations of particulate
matter was 12 micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m3). Based on
epidemiological research showing that this standard did not adequately
protect public health, the agency has now lowered the standard to 9
µg/m3.
</p>
<p>
Air quality has improved immensely since the 1970s when the Clean Air
Act was passed, preventing
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/clean-air-act-overview/highlights-clean-air-act-40th-anniversary" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hundreds
of thousands of premature deaths</a>. But thousands of people still die
early, are rushed to the emergency room, develop asthma, or miss work
due to air pollution.

The new AQI scale doesn’t mean you need to rethink how you make
decisions about when to spend time outdoors or whether to wear a mask.
But it does mean that if and when people make decisions based on the
AQI, they will be more informed by the science and, in aggregate,
contribute to lower all of these public health costs. The rules are
expected to prevent 4,500 premature deaths per year by 2032.

Some parts of the country could start to see more days with “moderate
air quality,” the yellow category. “People who live in places that have
frequent flips over nine — those will be people who have environmental
justice issues or live near traffic and industries and big cities and so
forth — they are going to get warned a little more,” John Bachmann, a
former associate director in EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation told me.
“Which is a positive thing.” The agency
<a href="https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/" target="_blank">considers
moderate air quality</a> to be “acceptable,” but there may still be a
risk for people who are particularly sensitive to pollution.
</p>
<p>
Also, during major air quality events like wildfires or chemical fires,
impacted areas could now be deemed “hazardous” when previously they may
have been “very unhealthy,” or deemed “very unhealthy” when before they
would have been simply “unhealthy.” This will affect when and how public
health officials respond to these kinds of events.
</p>
<p>
“This is for everybody, not just the most exposed or the most sensitive
people. So on both ends of it, this is a step in the right direction,”
Bachmann said.
</p>
<p>
As part of the changes, the agency will also now require cities with
more than 350,000 people to report the AQI seven days a week, up from
five — a rule that’s been in place since 1999. However, the agency said
that most states and cities are already doing this.
</p>
<p>
The new AQI scale will take effect in 60 days, in early April.

World’s Biggest Offshore Wind Developer Had a Horrible 2023, and It’s
America’s Fault</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-07, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTQwNzM5MC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcxODI1MjI2N30.tYaJn0S-vYdnrdVoi7fXeZwSm7Uj4X4npgPnnuXVF8M/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
The Danish energy developer Orsted delivered a withering verdict on its
experiment trying to build wind farms in the United States: Bad. It’s
lost a ton of money, the company said Wednesday, so it’s going to do
less of that going forward, and take on way less risk.
</p>
<p>
That Orsted had struggled in the U.S. offshore wind market was no secret
— late last year, it
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/everyones-mad-at-offshore-wind-developers" target="_self">cancelled
two projects in New Jersey</a> — but its earnings report put some grim
figures on it.
</p>
<p>
The company said that it had 9.6 billion Danish kroner worth of fees
(about $1.4 billion) related to one New Jersey project, Ocean Wind 1,
and had booked $4 billion of losses, most of which were due to Ocean
Wind 1’s cancellation. Overall, it reported a a loss of almost $3
billion in 2023, entirely due to the fees and impairments it reported.
Otherwise, the company would have had a more than $2 billion
profit.<br/> <br/> The company’s offshore wind misadventure won’t just
weigh on its balance sheet or stock price. Investors, including the
Danish government, will miss out on the company’s dividend for three
years, through 2025. And the company’s chairman, Thomas Thune Andersen,
said he would step down next month.
</p>
<p>
All this also meant that the company expects to have
<a href="https://orstedcdn.azureedge.net/-/media/annual-report-2023/orsted-ar-2023.pdf?rev=526307f68e2047b3a1df8dd2cdf719ec&hash=E6069E12C1792AD620FA12898587394C" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">far
less installed renewable capacity</a> developed by the end of the decade
than it had previously targeted, down to 35 to 28 gigawatts from the 50
GW it had projected as recently as last year. (It has just under 16 GW
at the moment.) The company will cut its planned investment by more than
half, according to Morningstar analyst Tancrede Fulop.
</p>
<p>
Orsted and other wind developers have blamed a combination of supply
chain issues, high interest rates, and inflexibility in the contracts
signed with state governments for the failures, delays, and
cancellations of projects
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/everyones-mad-at-offshore-wind-developers" target="_self">up
and down the East Coast</a> last year. In New York, Orsted and other
developers failed to get their contracts adjusted to
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/offshore-wind-new-york-public-service-commission" target="_self">account
for higher costs</a>, and so were forced to cancel and, in some cases,
re-bid.
</p>
<p>
The company said in a presentation to investors that it was “now focused
predominantly on the Northeast,” essentially throwing in the towel on
anywhere south of New York, having withdrawn from the New Jersey project
and declaring that its
<a href="https://orsted.com/en/media/news/2024/01/skipjack-wind-to-be-repositioned-for-future-offtak-815811" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Maryland
project</a>, Skipjack, will continue development “with minimal spend.”
</p>
<p>
The trouble wasn’t just in the United States, though — Orsted also said
it was pulling out of Norway, Spain, and Portugal, while it was
“deprioritising development in other markets including Japan.” It does,
however, seem committed to maintaining some presence here, having
submitted a
<a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/offshore-wind-new-york-developers-rebid-equinor-bp-orsted-eversource-rwe-national-grid/705852/#:~:text=%C3%98rsted%20also%20rebid%20its%20924,power%20supply%20contract%20in%20October." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new
bid for Sunrise Wind</a>, a planned wind farm off the east coast of Long
Island.
</p>
<p>
In a call with analysts, the company’s chief executive Mads Nipper said
that Orsted will spend far less money on projects before making the
final approval to go forward with construction. The company also said
that it will “pursue offtake opportunities where attractive with low
pre-FID commitments and inflation protection” — in other words, bid for
projects with low upfront costs and someone else around to absorb rising
costs.

<h2 id="a-rant-on-arc-search">A rant on ARC Search</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-07, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<p>
I was listening to the most recent
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/6/24063221/ai-search-arc-galaxy-s24-spatial-video-vergecast">Vergecast</a>
episode last night and an interview with Josh Miller, CEO of The Browser
Company, makers of the ARC Browser and the new ARC Search app. I found
the whole interview baffling.
</p>
<p>
Josh is rightfully complaining about the state of the web, specifically
the mobile web, but the solution he’s proposing is so stupidly naive
that I’m not entirely sure whether he’s just fucking with us.
</p>
<p>
His whole point is that search engines are not the best way to surface
information. You search for something, you’re presented with a list of
links, and you have to click through them and actively look for the
thing you were searching for. The proposed solution is AI—who would have
thought—that essentially googles for you, “reads” a bunch of the links,
and then creates a summary page.
</p>
<p>
All this is obviously done by stripping away all the tracking and ads
that are part of today’s web.
</p>
<p>
You’re smart and so you probably spotted the issue with this approach
already. Firstly, without a search engine in the mix, the AI has no way
to search for anything. So if the goal is to replace the traditional
search engine then we’re already failing. Because we’re not replacing
anything, we’re just hiding it behind some AI tool.
</p>
<p>
Maybe this is a problem that can be solved by maintaining a new
dedicated index but then you just have a search engine with a different
UI in front of it.
</p>
<p>
The second issue is one of trust. Should I just trust ARC Search? Who
can guarantee that the sources used by ARC are not just companies that
have paid ARC to be used as such? “But Manu, ARC Search doesn’t just
provide the answer to your query, it also provides links to the
sources.“ Well then congratulations, you just recreated an AI-nerfed
SERP with fewer links and more extra layers.
</p>
<p>
Now, let’s ignore all this and imagine this approach does work. Let’s
imagine we all get on board with this stupid idea of having an AI
searching for you. What happens to the web as a whole? Why should I keep
creating content for the web if I’m a content creator who relies on
traffic to run my creative business? No one will visit my site because
the relevant content will be consumed by some boring ass generated
pages. And without content on the web, products like ARC Search are
pointless.
</p>
<p>
What would happen, if something like this were to go mainstream, is that
more and more content would go behind a paywall, kept away from AI. And
for good reason.
</p>
<p>
I’m very unimpressed by this interview. I’m also very unimpressed by
most AI products these days.
</p>
<p>
The problem with search is not the UI. Having an AI search for me won’t
solve the issue of the sea of garbage content out there.
</p>
<p>
But hey, the product is here so let’s take it for a spin and see if it’s
any good. I just downloaded ARC Search on my phone and searched for
<em>“books on Japanese aesthetics”</em>.
</p>
<p>
This is what a “regular” search looks like inside ARC search and yes,
that’s a Google search, because it obviously is.
</p>

<div class="m-m">

</div>
</figure>
<p>
The first thing I see is a books section with 4 suggested books and 42
more 1 click away. If I’m looking for a book, that’s probably a good
enough starting point. Below that section, there are a bunch of sites,
related queries, the usual stuff.
</p>
<p>
Let’s do the same thing, using this revolutionary way to browse the web
powered by AI. Conveniently, ARC tells me the AI is reading 6 web pages.
</p>
<figure class="m-o" data-template="with">

</div>
</figure>
<p>
There are probably 700-billion-trillion pages out there but ARC has
picked 6. Why those 6? No idea. Have those 6 paid to be there? No idea.
Should I just trust that those 6 are reputable sources? Yup. A couple of
seconds later this is what I get:

5 books recommended to me in a somewhat compact list. Then I have 3 Top
Search Results that are just the top 3 links in Google search. After
that I get a completely pointless repetition of the initial list but
this time with some more information and worse information density. At
the end, I get a bunch of more links.
</p>
<p>
Can you tell me in what way this is better than a normal search results
page? The problem with search is that it’s full of fucking spam and ads.
That’s the problem with search. The solution to search is not to
“reinvent the browser” or to use AI to power searches for you. The
solution to search is a search engine that is aligned with the users.
</p>
<p>
I’d much rather support <a href="https://kagi.com">Kagi</a> and
<a href="https://search.marginalia.nu">Marginalia</a> than The Browser
Company.

<p>date: 2024-02-07, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links The CHIPS Act treats the symptoms, but not the causes:
Monopoly destroyed America’s high-tech capacity. Hey look at this:
Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2004, 2009, 2014, 2019, 2023
Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current
writing projects, current reading The CHIPS Act treats the symptoms, but
not the causes (permalink) There’s this great throwaway line in 1992’s
Sneakers, where Dan Aykroyd, playing a conspiracy-addled hacker/con-man,
is feverishly telling Sydney Poitier (playing an ex-CIA spook) about a
1958 meeting Eisenhower had with aliens where Ike said, “hey, look, give
us your technology, and we’ll give you all the cow lips you want.”
Poitier dismisses Aykroyd (“Don’t listen to this man. He’s
certifiable”). We’re meant to be on Poitier’s side here, but I’ve always
harbored some sympathy for Aykroyd in this scene. That’s because I often
hear echoes of Aykroyd’s theory in my own explanations of the esoteric
bargains and plots that produced the world we’re living in today. Of
course, in my world, it’s not presidents bargaining for alien technology
in exchange for cow-lips – it’s the world’s wealthy nations bargaining
to drop trade restrictions on the Global South in exchange for IP laws.
These bargains – which started as a series of bilateral and then
multilateral agreements like NAFTA, and culminated in the WTO agreement
of 1999 – were the most important step in the reordering of the world’s
economy around rent-extraction, cheap labor exploitation, and a brittle
supply chain that is increasingly endangered by the polycrisis of
climate and its handmaidens, like zoonotic plagues, water wars, and mass
refugee migration. Prior to the advent of “free trade,” the world’s rich
countries fashioned debt into a whip-hand over poor, post-colonial
nations. These countries had been bankrupted by their previous colonial
owners, and the price of their freedom was punishing debts to the IMF
and other rich-world institutions in exchange for loans to help these
countries “develop.” Like all poor debtors, these countries were said to
have gotten into their predicament through moral failure – they’d “lived
beyond their means.” (When rich people get into debt, bankruptcy steps
in to give them space to “restructure” according to their own plans.
When poor people get into debt, bankruptcy strips them of nearly
everything that might help them recover, brands them with a permanent
scarlet letter, and subjects them to humiliating micro-management whose
explicit message is that they are not competent to manage their own
affairs): https://pluralistic.net/2021/08/07/hr-4193/#shoppers-choice So
the poor debtor nations were ordered to “deregulate.” They had to sell
off their state assets, run their central banks according to the
dictates of rich-world finance authorities, and reorient their
production around supplying raw materials to rich countries, who would
process these materials into finished goods for export back to the poor
world. Naturally, poor countries were not allowed to erect “trade
barriers” that might erode the capacity of this North-South transfer of
high-margin goods, but this was not the era of free trade. It wasn’t the
free trade era because, while the North-South transfer was largely
unrestricted, the South-North transfer was subject to tight regulation
in the rich world. In other words, poor countries were expected to
export, say, raw ore to the USA and reimport high-tech goods, with low
tariffs in both directions. But if a poor country processed that ore
domestically and made its own finished goods, the US would block those
goods at the border, slapping them with high tariffs that made them more
expensive than Made-in-the-USA equivalents. The argument for this
unidirectional trade was that the US – and other rich countries – had a
strategic need to maintain their manufacturing industries as a hedge
against future geopolitical events (war, but also pandemics, extreme
weather) that might leave the rich world unable to provide for itself.
This rationale had a key advantage: it was true. A country that manages
its own central bank can create as much of its own currency as it wants,
and use that money to buy anything for sale in its own currency. This
may not be crucial while global markets are operating to the country’s
advantage (say, while the rest of the world is “willingly” pricing its
raw materials in your country’s currency), but when things go wrong –
war, plague, weather – a country that can’t make things is at the rest
of the world’s mercy. If you had to choose between being a poor
post-colonial nation that couldn’t supply its own technological needs
except by exporting raw materials to rich countries, and being a rich
country that had both domestic manufacturing capacity and a steady
supply of other countries’ raw materials, you would choose the second,
every time. What’s not to like? Here’s what. The problem – from the
perspective of America’s ultra-wealthy – was that this arrangement gave
the US workforce a lot of power. As US workers unionized, they were able
to extract direct concessions from their employers through collective
bargaining, and they could effectively lobby for universal worker
protections, including a robust welfare state – in both state and
federal legislatures. The US was better off as a whole, but the richest
ten percent were much poorer than they could be if only they could smash
worker power. That’s where free trade comes in. Notwithstanding racist
nonsense about “primitive” countries, there’s no intrinsic defect that
stops the global south from doing high-tech manufacturing. If the rich
world’s corporate leaders were given free rein to sideline America’s
national security in favor of their own profits, they could certainly
engineer the circumstances whereby poor countries would build
sophisticated factories to replace the manufacturing facilities that sat
behind the north’s high tariff walls. These poor-country factories could
produce goods ever bit as valuable as the rich world’s shops, but
without the labor, environmental and financial regulations that
constrained their owners’ profits. They slavered for a business
environment that let them kill workers; poison the air, land and water;
and cheat the tax authorities with impunity. For this plan to work, the
wealthy needed to engineer changes in both the rich world and the poor
world. Obviously, they would have to get rid of the rich world’s tariff
walls, which made it impossible to competitively import goods made in
the global south, no matter how cheaply they were made. But free trade
wasn’t just about deregulation in the north – it also required a whole
slew of new, extremely onerous regulations in the global south.
Corporations that relocated their manufacturing to poor – but nominally
sovereign – countries needed to be sure that those countries wouldn’t
try to replicate the American plan of becoming actually sovereign, by
exerting control over the means of production within their borders.
Recall that the American Revolution was inspired in large part by fury
over the requirement to ship raw materials back to Mother England and
then buy them back at huge markups after they’d been processed by
English workers, to the enrichment of English aristocrats. Post-colonial
America created new regulations (tariffs on goods from England), and –
crucially – they also deregulated. Specifically, post-revolutionary
America abolished copyrights and patents for English persons and firms.
That way, American manufacturers could produce sophisticated finished
goods without paying rent to England’s wealthy making those goods
cheaper for American buyers, and American publishers could subsidize
their editions of American authors’ books by publishing English authors
on the cheap, without the obligation to share profits with English
publishers or English writers. The surplus produced by ignoring the
patents and copyrights of the English was divided (unequally) among
American capitalists, workers, and shoppers. Wealthy Americans got
richer, even as they paid their workers more and charged less for their
products. This incubated a made-in-the-USA edition of the industrial
revolution. It was so successful that the rest of the world – especially
England – began importing American goods and literature, and then
American publishers and manufacturers started to lean on their
government to “respect” English claims, in order to secure bilateral
protections for their inventions and books in English markets. This was
good for America, but it was terrible for English manufacturers. The US
– a primitive, agricultural society – “stole” their inventions until
they gained so much manufacturing capacity that the English public
started to prefer American goods to English ones. This was the thing
that rich-world industrialists feared about free trade. Once you build
your high-tech factories in the global south, what’s to stop those
people from simply copying your plans – or worse, seizing your
factories! – and competing with you on a global scale? Some of these
countries had nominally socialist governments that claimed to explicitly
elevate the public good over the interests of the wealthy. And all of
these countries had the same sprinkling of sociopaths who’d gladly see a
million children maimed or the land poisoned for a buck – and these
“entrepreneurs” had unbeatable advantages with their countries’
political classes. For globalization to work, it wasn’t enough to
deregulate the rich world – capitalists also had to regulate the poor
world. Specifically, they had to get the poor world to adopt “IP” laws
that would force them to willingly pay rent on things they could get for
free: patents and other IP, even though it was in the short-term,
medium-term, and long-term interests of both the nation and its
politicians and its businesspeople. Thus, the bargain that makes me
sympathetic to Dan Aykroyd: not cow lips for alien tech; but free trade
for IP law. When the WTO was steaming towards passage in the late 1990s,
there was (rightly) a lot of emphasis on its deregulatory provisions:
weakening of labor, environmental and financial laws in the poor world,
and of tariffs in the rich world. But in hindsight, we all kind of
missed the main event: the TRIPS (Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of
Intellectual Property Rights). This actually started before the WTO
treaty (it was part of the GATT, a predecessor to the WTO), but the WTO
spread it to countries all over the world. Under the TRIPS, poor
countries are required to honor the IP claims of rich countries, on pain
of global sanction. That was the plan: instead of paying American
workers to make Apple computers, say, Apple could export the “IP” for
Macs and iPhones to countries like China, and these countries would
produce Apple products that were “designed in California, assembled in
China.” China would allow Apple to treat Chinese workers so badly that
they routinely committed suicide, and would lock up or kill workers who
tried to unionize. China would accept vast shipments of immortal, toxic
e-waste. And China wouldn’t let its entrepreneurs copy Apple’s designs,
be they software, schematics or trademarks. Apple isn’t the only company
that pursued this strategy, but no company has executed it as
successfully. It’s not for nothing that Steve Jobs’s hand-picked
successor was Tim Cook, who oversaw the transfer of even the most
exacting elements of Apple manufacturing to Chinese facilities, striking
bargains with contractors like Foxconn that guaranteed that workers
would be heavily – lethally! – surveilled and controlled to prevent the
twin horrors of unionization and leaks. For the first two decades of the
WTO era, the most obvious problems with this arrangement was wage
erosion (for American workers) and leakage (for the rich). China’s
“socialist” government was only too happy to help Foxconn imprison
workers who demanded better wages and working conditions, but they were
far more relaxed about knockoffs, be they fake iPods sold in market
stalls or US trade secrets working their way into Huawei products. These
were problems for the American aristocracy, whose investments depended
on China disciplining both Chinese workers and Chinese businesses. For
the American people, leakage was a nothingburger. Apple’s profits
weren’t shared with its workforce beyond the relatively small number of
tech workers at its headquarters. The vast majority of Apple employees,
who flogged iPhones and scrubbed the tilework in gleaming white stores
across the nation, would get the same minimal (or even minimum) wage no
matter how profitable Apple grew. It wasn’t until the pandemic that the
other shoe dropped for the American public. The WTO arrangement – cow
lips for alien technology – had produced a global system brittle supply
chains composed entirely of weakest links. A pandemic, a war, a ship
stuck in the Suez Canal or Houthi paramilitaries can cripple the entire
system, perhaps indefinitely. For two decades, we fought over
globalization’s effect on wages. We let our corporate masters trick us
into thinking that China’s “cheating” on IP was a problem for the
average person. But the implications of globalization for American
sovereignty and security were banished to the xenophobic right fringe,
where they were mixed into the froth of Cold War 2.0 nonsense. The
pandemic changed that, creating a coalition that is motivated by a
complex and contradictory stew of racism, environmentalism, xenophobia,
labor advocacy, patriotism, pragmatism, fear and hope. Out of that stew
emerged a new American political tendency, mostly associated with
Bidenomics, but also claimed in various guises by the American right,
through its America First wing. That tendency’s most visible artifact is
the CHIPS Act, through which the US government proposes to use policy
and subsidies to bring high-tech manufacturing back to America’s shores.
This week, the American Economic Liberties Project published “Reshoring
and Restoring: CHIPS Implementation for a Competitive Semiconductor
Industry,” a fascinating, beautifully researched and detailed analysis
of the CHIPS Act and the global high-tech manufacturing market, written
by Todd Achilles, Erik Peinert and Daniel Rangel:
https://www.economicliberties.us/our-work/reshoring-and-restoring-chips-implementation-for-a-competitive-semiconductor-industry/#
Crucially, the report lays out the role that the weakening of antitrust,
the dismantling of tariffs and the strengthening of IP played in the
history of the current moment. The failure to enforce antitrust law
allowed for monopolization at every stage of the semiconductor
industry’s supply-chain. The strengthening of IP and the weakening of
tariffs encouraged the resulting monopolies to chase cheap labor
overseas, confident that the US government would punish host countries
that allowed their domestic entrepreneurs to use American designs
without permission. The result is a financialized, “capital light”
semiconductor industry that has put all its eggs in one basket. For the
most advanced chips (“leading-edge logic”), production works like this:
American firms design a chip and send the design to Taiwan where TSMC
foundry turns it into a chip. The chip is then shipped to one of a small
number of companies in the poor world where they are assembled, packaged
and tested (AMP) and sent to China to be integrated into a product.
Obsolete foundries get a second life in the commodity chip (“mature-node
chips”) market – these are the cheap chips that are shoveled into our
cars and appliances and industrial systems. Both of these systems are
fundamentally broken. The advanced, “leading-edge” chips rely on
geopolitically uncertain, heavily concentrated foundries. These
foundries can be fully captured by their customers – as when Apple
prepurchases the entire production capacity of the most advanced chips,
denying both domestic and offshore competitors access to the newest
computation. Meanwhile, the less powerful, “mature node” chips command
minuscule margins, and are often dumped into the market below cost,
thanks to subsidies from countries hoping to protect their corner of the
high-tech sector. This makes investment in low-power chips uncertain,
leading to wild swings in cost, quality and availability of these
workhorse chips. The leading-edge chipmakers – Nvidia, Broadcom,
Qualcomm, AMD, etc – have fully captured their markets. They like the
status quo, and the CHIPS Act won’t convince them to invest in onshore
production. Why would they? 2022 was Broadcom’s best year ever, not in
spite of its supply-chain problems, but because of them. Those problems
let Broadcom raise prices for a captive audience of customers, who the
company strong-armed into exclusivity deals that ensured they had
nowhere to turn. Qualcomm also profited handsomely from shortages,
because its customers end up paying Qualcomm no matter where they buy,
thanks to Qualcomm ensuring that its patents are integrated into global
4G and 5G standards. That means that all standards-conforming products
generate royalties for Qualcomm, and it also means that Qualcomm can
decide which companies are allowed to compete with it, and which ones
will be denied licenses to its patents. Both companies are under orders
from the FTC to cut this out, and both companies ignore the FTC. The
brittleness of mature-node and leading-edge chips is not inevitable.
Advanced memory chips (DRAM) roughly comparable in complexity to
leading-edge chips, while analog-to-digital chips are as easily
commodified as mature-node chips, and yet each has a robust and
competitive supply chain, with both onshore and offshore producers. In
contrast with leading-edge manufacturers (who have been visibly
indifferent to the CHIPS incentives), memory chip manufacturers
responded to the CHIPS Act by committing hundreds of billions of dollars
to new on-shore production facilities. Intel is a curious case: in a
world of fabless leading-edge manufacturers, Intel stands out for making
its own chips. But Intel is in a lot of trouble. Its advanced
manufacturing plans keep foundering on cost overruns and delays. The
company keeps losing money. But until recently, its management kept
handing its shareholders billions in dividends and buybacks – a sign
that Intel bosses assume that the US public will bail out its “national
champion.” It’s not clear whether the CHIPS Act can save Intel, or
whether financialization will continue to hollow out a once-dominant
pioneer. The CHIPS Act won’t undo the concentration – and
financialization – of the semiconductor industry. The industry has been
awash in cheap money since the 2008 bailouts, and in just the past five
years, US semiconductor monopolists have paid out $239b to shareholders
in buybacks and dividends, enough to fund the CHIPS Act five times over.
If you include Apple in that figure, the amount US corporations spent on
shareholder returns instead of investing in capacity rises to $698b.
Apple doesn’t want a competitive market for chips. If Apple builds its
own foundry, that just frees up capacity at TSMC that its competitors
can use to improve their products. The report has an enormous amount of
accessible, well-organized detail on these markets, and it makes a set
of key recommendations for improving the CHIPS Act and passing related
legislation to ensure that the US can once again make its own
microchips. These run a gamut from funding four new onshore foundries to
requiring companies receiving CHIPS Act money to “dual-source” their
foundries. They call for NIST and the CPO to ensure open licensing of
key patents, and for aggressive policing of anti-dumping rules for cheap
chips. They also seek a new law creating an “American Semiconductor
Supply Chain Resiliency Fee” – a tariff on chips made offshore.
Fundamentally, these recommendations seek to end the outsourcing made
possible by restrictive IP regimes, to undercut Wall Street’s power to
demand savings from offshoring, and to smash the market power of
companies like Apple that make the brittleness of chip manufacturing
into a feature, rather than a bug. This would include a return to
previous antitrust rules, which limited companies’ ability to leverage
patents into standards, and to previous IP rules, which limited
exclusive rights chip topography and design (“mask rights”). All of this
will is likely to remove the constraints that stop poor countries from
doing to America the same things that postcolonial America did to
England – that is, it will usher in an era in which lots of countries
make their own chips and other high-tech goods without paying rent to
American companies. This is good! It’s good for poor countries, who will
have more autonomy to control their own technical destiny. It’s also
good for the world, creating resiliency in the high-tech manufacturing
sector that we’ll need as the polycrisis overwhelms various places with
fire and flood and disease and war. Electrifying, solarizing and
adapting the world for climate resilience is fundamentally incompatible
with a brittle, highly concentrated tech sector. Pluralizing high-tech
production will make America less vulnerable to the gamesmanship of
other countries – and it will also make the rest of the world less
vulnerable to American bullying. As Henry Farrell and Abraham Newman
describe so beautifully in their 2023 book Underground Empire, the
American political establishment is keenly aware of how its chokepoints
over global finance and manufacturing can be leveraged to advantage the
US at the rest of the world’s expense:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/10/10/weaponized-interdependence/#the-other-swifties
Look, I know that Eisenhower didn’t trade cow-lips for alien technology
– but our political and commercial elites really did trade national
resiliency away for IP laws, and it’s a bargain that screwed everyone,
except the one percenters whose power and wealth have metastasized into
a deadly cancer that threatens the country and the planet. (Image:

<h2 id="the-messy-truth-of-americas-natural-gas-exports">The Messy Truth
of America’s Natural Gas Exports</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-07, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTM5NjE5MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2MzYwODE0OH0.5Gl-Y_zZ4R-WmAw7Ey6RGhL8XwqV0dnfDN-Wo8S8b3M/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Late last month, Joe Biden made what has been hailed as one of the
biggest climate policy decisions of the past year. <br/>
</p>
<p>
He announced that the federal government would temporarily stop
approving new export terminals for liquified natural gas. The move was
celebrated as a victory by climate activists and lamented by fossil-fuel
companies; Donald Trump promised that, if elected, he will reverse the
move.
</p>
<p>
But what will the pause <em>really </em>mean for the climate? Will it
stop exports from rising in the near-term, and can we say with any
certainty whether it will make carbon emissions go up or down? How
should we even <em>think</em> about this decision?
</p>
<p>
In this inaugural episode of Shift Key, Heatmap’s new podcast, my
co-host Jesse Jenkins, an energy systems expert and professor at
Princeton University, and I unpack the president’s decision and try to
figure out what — if anything — it means for the climate.
</p>
<p>
Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:
</p>
<p>
<strong>Robinson Meyer:</strong> Since this news came out, I think
there’s been a lot of discussion online about whether this is
necessarily the optimal choice. Could we be using that gas to do
something else? How should we be managing it? And I just want to make a
point before we go on that this is literally what climate policy means.
</p>
<p>
There’s a sense I see from some places, which is like, well, “Is cutting
off fossil fuel exports at this very arbitrary place, the optimal
policy?” And I just want to make the point that like, number one, we are
not on an optimal policy pathway at all. And in the absence of a policy
that I think both you and I think is very unlikely to pass, which is a
globally normalized carbon price that’s imposed evenly in all
jurisdictions and is priced at a level that we can attain the 1.5C or
1.6C, whatever end temperature goal we want to achieve –
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jesse Jenkins:</strong> Yeah, I’m going to go ahead and say
that’s unlikely.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer</strong>: Yes, in the absence of a global carbon price
that is uniformly enforced across all jurisdictions, we are going to
make suboptimal decisions. And not only are we going to make suboptimal
decisions, but we are going to stop investing in fossil fuels below what
would be economically optimal if climate change didn’t exist. That’s
literally what climate change means.
</p>
<p>
And at the same time, we are going to invest above what would be
economically optimal in all of these fossil fuels if you take climate
change into account, because that is the signal failure of global
climate policy, is that we keep plowing money into fossil fuels and
under-investing in alternatives and in scaling up alternatives. We’ve
underinvested in those things for at least 20 years. That’s a different
show about whether we’re still doing it or how much we’re still doing
it.
</p>
<p>
I just want to get into this whole discussion by saying when we talk
about whether we’re fiddling knobs in the right way, or enough this way,
or enough that way, or whether we’re taking all these things into
account, we are never going to do this perfectly. And the whole point of
climate change is at some point you just have to stop investing in the
fossil fuel system.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins</strong>: Yeah, economists call this the second best
policy or third best policy. I just call it “the real world.” We’re all
just muddling through all the time and how we’re going to make progress
or not is whether we muddled through better or worse.
</p>
<p>
So I agree, it’s theoretically helpful to think about what an
economically ideal rationalized policy would be. But we’re so far from
that world that I think the question is, “is this better than the
alternative decision you could make about this particular thing right
here?”
</p>
<p>
And hopefully, that’s the view that the Department of Energy is taking
when they think about the public interest here. It’s not like, well,
could we have had some more ideal climate policy that meant we were
doing something else over in this other part of the economy instead of
doing this?
</p>
<p>
That’s an interesting conversation to have on Twitter, but maybe not the
core of the question that the DOE and the Biden administration are
grappling with right here.

Europe-wide protests</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-07, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
<em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Spanish farmers have joined a wave
of protests sweeping Europe. They’re demanding more support from the EU
and their government and say they’re fed up with high costs and
stringent environmental standards. Then, thousands of Indian men have
lined up to apply for construction jobs in Israel, which relies heavily
on migrant labor — especially since revoking Palestinian work permits
since the war in Gaza.

<li>‘World’s largest carbon removal plant’ will soon be up and running
</h3>
<p>
<strong></strong>One to watch for this week: A Bill Gates-backed startup
called Graphyte plans to begin operations at its Arkansas carbon removal
plant by Friday,<em> E&amp;E News</em>
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=1eb9bd9465&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.
The facility, which has been dubbed the “world’s largest carbon removal
plant,” relies on biomass matter like sawdust and farming waste that, if
left to decompose, would release a lot of carbon. Graphyte wants to stop
the decomposition process by drying the waste out, shaping it into
bricks, and burying the bricks underground for years and years, thus
keeping the carbon from ever reaching the atmosphere.

the company’s process keeps the cost of carbon removal below $100 per
ton, a key benchmark for scalability. Graphyte hopes to remove 15,000
metric tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by the end of 2024 and
continue scaling quickly from there.

can’t help sitting here thinking that the silly season has begun,” she
told her colleagues.

<li>UK watchdog bans ‘zero emissions’ from EV ads
</h3>
<p>
<strong></strong>Carmakers in the United Kingdom can no longer use the
words “zero emissions” in ads to describe their electric vehicles. The
U.K.’s advertising watchdog, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA),
says the claim is misleading for consumers because it ignores emissions
from manufacturing and charging. If carmakers want to use the term, they
must find a way to explain this nuance. The precedent-setting move is
part of a bigger crackdown on greenwashing – the ASA has also banned
misleading ads from oil groups and airlines, the <em>Financial
Times</em>
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=24bfb90a77&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.
But it comes at a time when carmakers are striving to increase their EV
sales to avoid hefty fines: As of this year, fully-electric cars must
make up at least 22% of new cars sales in the U.K. If a company misses
that target, it will be fined £15,000 for every non-compliant vehicle.
So the question is how much the words “zero emissions” really matter for
sales. BMW, for example, uses the term in Google ads. But a quick look
at Google Trends shows “EVs” (in red) is a far more popular search term
than “zero emissions” (in blue), at least in the U.K.:

<p>
As EV options flood the market, a much more reliable way to boost sales
than touting emissions reductions is by introducing cutting edge smart
features, like lidar sensors, according to

from energy think-tank Ember. In 2023, wind power generation in the bloc
surpassed that of gas plants for the first time. Compared to 2022,
fossil fuel power generation fell by almost 20% overall, with
electricity from coal plants plummeting by 26% and gas down 15%.
Greenhouse gas emissions from the power sector fell by 19% as a result,
more than the huge reduction seen during the pandemic. Ember added that
the EU’s power-sector emissions are now almost half their 2007 peak
levels. “Fossil fuels are playing a smaller role than ever as a system
with wind and solar as its backbone comes into view,” said Sarah Brown,
Ember’s Europe program director.

on the Coast Actually Love Offshore Wind, a New Poll Shows</h2>

<p class="drop-caps">
Last year, I got two kinds of stories about offshore wind in my inbox.
One was about the industry’s struggle with inflation and higher interest
rates. The other was about rampant claims that the industry was killing
whales — an idea for which there is
<a href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/new-england-mid-atlantic/marine-life-distress/frequent-questions-offshore-wind-and-whales" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">no
evidence</a>, and which was found to be
<a href="https://energyandpolicy.org/fossil-fuel-funding-anti-offshore-wind-ads/" target="_blank">spread
by groups</a> with
<a href="https://www.climatedevlab.brown.edu/anti-offshorewindnetwork" target="_blank">ties
to the fossil fuel industry</a>.
</p>
<p>
But while both narratives have set the industry back to some extent,
neither appears to have damaged public support for building wind farms
in the ocean. Americans living on the coasts largely support offshore
wind and want to see the industry continue to grow, according to a
<a href="https://climatenexus.org/poll/u-s-coastal-county-residents-support-offshore-wind-development" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new
poll</a>.
</p>
<p>
The poll was conducted in November 2023 by Climate Nexus, a climate
change strategic communications group, and Turn Forward, an offshore
wind advocacy nonprofit that says it does not receive funding from wind
farm developers.

</iframe>
</center>
<p>
A representative sample of 2,038 adults living in coastal counties along
the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and Gulf of Mexico were asked about
their views of offshore wind. More than two-thirds responded that they
support offshore wind farm construction, and 63% responded favorably
when asked specifically whether they supported offshore wind farms near
where they lived. Nearly 60% endorsed the U.S. government selling more
leases to expand the industry’s development.
</p>
<p>
Public sentiment, for the most part, was positive across party lines.
The majority of Republican respondents also said they supported offshore
wind, both in general (57%), and near where they live (52%).
</p>
<p>
A more polarizing question was whether respondents preferred offshore
wind development to expanding offshore oil and gas, with 71% of
Democrats opting for wind but only 33% of Republicans. (26% of
Republicans said they had no preference.)

</iframe>
</center>
<p>
One of the more intriguing parts of the poll tried to suss out what
people had heard and read about offshore wind, and where they were
getting information about the emerging industry. Local opposition groups
like
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/300299345115758/" target="_blank">Protect
Our Coast New Jersey</a> have developed large followings on Facebook,
where members share their fears that wind turbines will harm marine
mammals, tourism, and property values — and also argue against the basic
facts of climate change. Several grassroots groups, including Protect
Our Coast New Jersey, have been found to have financial relationships
with

fuel-funded think tanks like the Caesar Rodney Institute</a>.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>Conservative outlets like Fox News have also fueled the
narrative that offshore wind development is killing whales. Media
Matters, a media watchdog,
<a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/fox-news-aiding-fossil-fuel-funded-campaign-targeting-offshore-wind" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">found</a>
that Fox has “aired at least 54 segments suggesting that offshore wind
development is causing whale deaths.” A
<a href="https://www.climatedevlab.brown.edu/anti-offshorewindnetwork" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a>
published last year by researchers at Brown University that mapped out
the networks of anti-offshore wind groups in the U.S. suggested that
social networks and conservative news outlets like Fox function as “a
feedback loop of opposition and misinformation.”

</iframe>
</center>
<p>
According to the new poll, 53% of coastal Americans have received
information about offshore wind on TV news, and 48% have seen posts
about it on social media. Those were the two top sources of information,
followed by newspapers, family and friends, and TV ads. But even so,
most respondents — 56% — said that everything they have seen, read, or
heard about offshore wind has been more positive than negative.
</p>
<p>
But while the poll may be a good temperature check on public sentiment,
it doesn’t necessarily change some of the headwinds that offshore wind
development faces. An
<a href="https://scholarship.law.columbia.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1201&context=sabin_climate_change" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">earlier
report</a> from Columbia University researchers found that local
opposition to renewable energy projects, including offshore wind
projects, is growing. The report specifically documents instances where
community groups have passed laws to block projects or filed lawsuits
against developers or local officials.
</p>
<p>
There are currently four lawsuits pending in federal court against
Vineyard Wind, a project that is already under construction, from a
group called Nantucket Residents Against Turbines. In New Jersey, at
least two communities passed resolutions last year calling on state and
federal officials to impose a moratorium on offshore wind projects,
citing whale deaths. And last October, a group called Protect Our Coast
LINY
<a href="https://nysfocus.com/2023/10/26/wind-turbines-energy-long-island-democrats-republicans" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">celebrated
a victory</a> when New York Governor Kathy Hochul vetoed a bill that
would have greenlit placing an offshore wind transmission cable under
the sand in Long Beach, which the group had been fighting.
</p>
<p>
Even if the majority of coastal citizens support an American offshore
wind industry, a vocal minority can still wield a lot of power to hold
it back — especially when they have the backing of fossil fuel money.

techniques? To study this question, we construct proof-of-concept
examples of deceptive behavior in large language models (LLMs). For
example, we train models that write secure code when the prompt states
that the year is 2023, but insert exploitable code when the stated year
is 2024. We find that such backdoor behavior can be made persistent, so
that it is not removed by standard safety training techniques, including
supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and adversarial training
(eliciting unsafe behavior and then training to remove it). The backdoor
behavior is most persistent in the largest models and in models trained
to produce chain-of-thought reasoning about deceiving the training
process, with the persistence remaining even when the chain-of-thought
is distilled away. Furthermore, rather than removing backdoors, we find
that adversarial training can teach models to better recognize their
backdoor triggers, effectively hiding the unsafe behavior. Our results
suggest that, once a model exhibits deceptive behavior, standard
techniques could fail to remove such deception and create a false
impression of safety…

I have a podcast about Solarpunk for writers called Solarpunk Prompts.
It’s about halfway through season 2. The episode released today is
called <strong>The Tower</strong>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Displaced people are moved into a new sustainable climate-controlled
tower designed to help them find community. For some it’s a dream come
true, for others a culture shock. How will this setting come to life as
a vision for a Solarpunk future? How can we envision a better way of
living by focusing on their humanity?
</p>

data-cites="Solarpun">@Solarpun</span></span><span
class="invisible">kPrompts/episodes/the-tower</span></a>
</p>
<p>
The podcast is based around the idea of providing a new writing prompt
each episode that explores some of the themes of the Solarpunk genre and
activist movement. We discuss some inspirations, considerations, and
various ways to tell the story.
</p>
<p>
While the subject matter is focused on writing, the audience is quite
diverse. Many non-writers enjoy it simply to learn more about Solarpunk
in general.
</p>
<p>
Have a listen! You can find it at the link above, or by searching in
your favorite podcast app. If you don’t know what Solarpunk is at all,
you might try listening to Episode 1 of Season 1 for an overview of the
genre and movement, and the reasons why this podcast came into being.
</p>
<p>
Most episodes are around 10 minutes long. The Tower is our longest at
just over 16 minutes.

id="nikki-haley-trounced-by-none-of-these-candidates-in-nevada-republican-primary">Nikki
Haley Trounced by ‘None of These Candidates’ in Nevada Republican
Primary</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LAS VEGAS — Nikki Haley was swamped Tuesday in Nevada’s symbolic
Republican presidential primary as GOP voters resoundingly picked the
“none of these candidates” option on the ballot in a repudiation of the
former U.N. ambassador who is the last remaining major rival to
front-runner Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Trump, the former president, didn’t compete in the primary, which
doesn’t award any delegates needed to win the GOP nomination. He’s
instead focused on caucuses that will be held Thursday and will help him
move closer to becoming the Republican standard-bearer.</p>
<p>That leaves the Republican results on Tuesday technically
meaningless. But they still amount to an embarrassment for Haley, who
has sought to position herself as a candidate who can genuinely compete
against Trump. Instead, she became the first presidential candidate from
either party to lose a race to “none of these candidates” since that
option was introduced in Nevada in 1975.</p>
<p>Haley had said beforehand she was going to “focus on the states that
are fair” and did not campaign in the western state in the weeks leading
up to the caucuses. Her campaign wrote off the primary results with a
reference to Nevada’s famous casino industry.</p>
<p>“Even Donald Trump knows that when you play penny slots the house
wins,” spokeswoman Olivia Perez-Cubas said. “We didn’t bother to play a
game rigged for Trump. We’re full steam ahead in South Carolina and
beyond.”</p>
<p>Trump joked on his social media network, “Watch, she’ll soon claim
Victory!”</p>
<p>Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican, had announced beforehand that
he would vote for “none of these candidates” on Tuesday. Several
Republicans interviewed heading to the polls said they intended to do
the same.</p>
<p>Washoe County Republican Party Chair Bruce Parks, who pushed for the
GOP to hold caucuses, said that he told voters who called his office —
and Trump supporters — to participate in the primary by voting for “none
of these candidates” over Haley.</p>
<p>“They basically told us they don’t care about us,” Parks said in an
interview after the race was called. “By marking ‘none of these
candidates,’ we respond in kind — we don’t care about you either.”</p>
<p>The Associated Press declared “None of these candidates” the winner
at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday based on initial vote results that showed it
with a significant lead over Haley in seven counties across the state,
including in the two most populous counties.</p>
<p>There was also a Democratic primary on Tuesday that President Joe
Biden easily won against author Marianne Williamson and a handful of
less-known challengers. Rep. Dean Phillips of Minnesota was not on the
ballot.</p>
<p>Biden issued a statement thanking Nevada voters for their support
and, with an eye toward an expected matchup in November, warned that
Trump is trying to divide America.</p>
<p>“I want to thank the voters of Nevada for sending me and Kamala
Harris to the White House four years ago, and for setting us one step
further on that same path again tonight. We must organize, mobilize, and
vote. Because one day, when we look back, we’ll be able to say, when
American democracy was a risk, we saved it — together,” Biden said.</p>
<p>Nevada lawmakers added “none of these candidates” as an option in all
statewide races as a way post-Watergate for voters to participate but
express dissatisfaction with their choices. “None” can’t win an elected
office, but it came in first in primary congressional contests in 1976
and 1978. It also finished ahead of both George Bush and Edward Kennedy
in Nevada’s 1980 presidential primaries.</p>
<p>The caucuses on Thursday are the only Nevada contest that count
toward the GOP’s presidential nomination. But they were seen as
especially skewed in favor of Trump because of the intense grassroots
support they require from candidates and new state party rules that
benefitted him further.</p>
<p>Trump is expected to handily win the caucuses, which should deliver
him all 26 of the state’s delegates. Delegates are party members,
activists and elected officials who vote at the national party
conventions to formally select the party’s nominee.</p>
<p>“If your goal is to win the Republican nomination for president, you
go where the delegates are. And it baffles me that Nikki Haley chose not
to participate,” Trump’s senior campaign adviser Chris LaCivita said in
an interview before the primary.</p>
<p>Nevada, the third state in the field after Iowa and New Hampshire,
was set to hold a state-run primary election instead of party-run
caucuses after Democrats controlling the Legislature changed the law to
try to boost participation.</p>
<p>Caucuses typically require voters to show up for an in-person meeting
at a certain day or time, while elections can offer more flexibility to
participate, with polls open for most of the day on Election Day, along
with absentee or early voting.</p>
<p>But Nevada Republicans chose to hold party-run caucuses instead,
saying they wanted certain rules in place, like a requirement that
participants show a government-issued ID.</p>
<p>The caucuses require a candidate to intensely organize supporters
around the state to be competitive, a feat that Trump, the former
president and prohibitive front-runner, was easily positioned to do.</p>
<p>The Nevada GOP also restricted the involvement of super PACs like the
one Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis was relying on to boost his now-suspended
campaign. And the party barred candidates from appearing both on the
primary ballot and in the caucuses.</p>
<p>Former Vice President Mike Pence and South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott
also signed up to compete in Nevada’s primary instead of the caucuses
before ending their presidential campaigns.</p>

Bening Honored as Harvard’s Hasty Pudding Woman of the Year</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — Annette Bening, a two-time Golden Globe winner who
recently received her fifth Oscar nomination, was feted Tuesday with a
raucous parade full of colorful costumes and drag performers as part of
festivities honoring her as Harvard University’s Hasty Pudding
Theatricals 2024 Woman of the Year.</p>
<p>A few hours later, Benning endured a celebrity roast before attending
a performance of the Hasty Pudding Theatricals’ 175th production, “Heist
Heist Baby.”</p>
<p>She joined a group of synchronized swimmers on stage doing swim
strokes to the song “Pump Up the Jams,” a reference to her role in the
swimming movie “Nyad.” Then, she cut the hair of a volunteer in an
effort to give him her signature look. And then she donned a seagull
costume and acted out the role of the sea bird, a reference her role in
the movie version of Anton Chekhov’s “The Seagull,” squawking and
waiving her arms.</p>
<p>“I did it all myself with no one’s help,” Benning joked, after
accepting the traditional pudding pot and trying to start a speech by
thanking her kindergarten teacher. Her husband, Warren Beatty, won the
man of the year award in 1975.</p>
<p>The Pudding is the oldest theatrical organization in the nation and
one of the oldest in the world. Since 1951, it has bestowed this award
annually on women “who have made lasting and impressive contributions to
the world of entertainment.” Other winners have included Meryl Streep,
Julia Roberts, Scarlett Johansson and Jennifer Coolidge.</p>
<p>Festivities began with the parade at Harvard. Bening, wearing a brown
coat, hat and sunglasses, blew kisses to the crowd, and at one point,
was pecked on both cheeks by drag performers. As the parade ended, she
launched into a can-can dance with several other people.</p>
<p>“We’re absolutely thrilled to honor Annette Bening in this milestone
175th anniversary year for the Hasty Pudding,” said Josh Hillers, the
organization’s president. “Hot off her Oscars nomination for Best
Actress, we’re excited to present her with the most prestigious award in
the entertainment industry.”</p>
<p>Bening, who also has won a Screen Actors Guild Award and starred in
“The Grifters” and “American Beauty,” earned her fifth Oscar nomination,
this one for best actress, for playing the prickly long-distance swimmer
Diana Nyad in the movie “Nyad.”</p>
<p>Barry Keoghan, best known for his roles in “Saltburn,” “Dunkirk,”
“The Killing of a Sacred Deer,” “Eternals” and “The Banshees of
Inisherin,” is the recipient of its 2024 Man of the Year Award. He will
be honored Friday night.</p>

Celebrates Black History Amid African Americans’ Anger Over Gaza</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden celebrated Black History Month
Tuesday at the White House amid slipping support from Black voters
distressed by the administration’s stance on the war in Gaza and
disillusioned by what they see as a lack of progress on Biden’s racial
justice agenda.</p>
<p>“Tonight, let’s reflect on how we make history, not erase history,”
Biden said Tuesday evening, taking a jab at Republican-controlled state
legislatures that have introduced bills that would limit what schools
can teach about race and American Black history.</p>
<p>Vice President Kamala Harris, who spoke before Biden, was more
direct.</p>
<p>“Across our nation, we have witnessed extremists try to erase our
history,” she said during the White House reception with Black leaders.
“They censor history textbooks and cancel history classes.”</p>
<p>In a statement, the White House touted legislative victories and
executive orders promoting racial equity that has seen a 60% increase in
Black wealth since the pandemic, record levels of entrepreneurship, and
significant reductions in child poverty. They highlighted support for
Black-owned businesses, expanded access to affordable housing, improved
educational opportunities and efforts to address health care and
educational disparities.</p>
<p>Yet polls suggest support for the president among Black voters is
slipping. A USA Today/Suffolk University poll released in January shows
Biden carrying the support of just 63% of Black voters, a steep decline
from the 87% he had in 2020.</p>
<p>Troubled by Gaza</p>
<p>As images of death and destruction in Gaza mobilized activists, a
coalition of more than 1,000 Black faith leaders pressed Biden to call
for a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas.</p>
<p>The campaign grew organically from the congregation, said the
Rev. Timothy McDonald III, one of the first pastors who signed the open
letter.</p>
<p>“They pushed us to make that statement,” said McDonald, founder of
the African American Ministers Leadership Council and senior pastor of
the First Iconium Baptist Church in Atlanta, Georgia.</p>
<p>“Young people were saying, ‘You’re all supposed to be faith leaders,
and you’re doing nothing about all of this?’” McDonald told VOA. He
noted that just as with the civil rights movement, the distress and
anger felt by younger parishioners quickly spread to older members of
the congregation.</p>
<p>Community leaders say that Black Americans who support Palestinian
rights see the conflict through the lens of racial justice, with the
solidarity of a minority group that knows how it feels to be oppressed,
displaced and deprived.</p>
<p>Steve Phillips, author and founder of Democracy in Color, a political
media organization, pointed to Martin Luther King Jr.’s 1967 “A Time to
Break Silence” speech. In it, King denounced U.S. involvement in the
Vietnam War as morally unjust and said it diverted Americans’ attention
from racism and poverty at home.</p>
<p>“There’s just so much resonance and similarity to this same kind of a
moment,” Phillips told VOA.”</p>
<p>Responding to international and domestic pressures, Biden has shown a
more sympathetic tone toward Palestinians, saying last week he sees “the
trauma, the death and destruction,” and understands “the pain and
passion felt by so many here in America and around the world.”</p>
<p>The administration says a permanent cease-fire will only benefit
Hamas at this point. But it is pushing for a deal that would secure a
temporary halt in fighting in return for the release of Israeli hostages
held by Hamas and release of Palestinians in Israeli prisons.</p>
<p>Waning enthusiasm</p>
<p>Even before the October 7 Hamas attack, there were signs of waning
Black enthusiasm for Biden and frustration over the lack of progress on
issues that emerged alongside the Black Lives Matter movement.</p>
<p>“There was a fairly high-profile announcement about efforts to look
at racial justice when the president first came in. And then you never
heard much follow-up after that,” Phillips said.</p>
<p>A bill designed to ensure that minority voters can participate
equally in the electoral process, and a bill to prevent racial profiling
by law enforcement have been languishing in Congress. </p>
<p>Only 50% of Black adults said they approve of Biden in a December
AP-NORC poll, down from 86% in July 2021. Biden’s opponent is eager to
capitalize.</p>
<p>“Joe Biden no longer has a base,” said Karoline Leavitt, national
press secretary for the campaign of leading Republican nominee and
former President Donald Trump. </p>
<p>“Key Democrat constituencies, such as African Americans, Hispanic
Americans and women, are supporting President Trump because they are
sick and tired of Crooked Joe’s record-high inflation, open borders,
crime and chaos,” she told VOA.</p>
<p>With most polls showing Biden having a comfortable lead over Trump
among Black voters, the bigger threat is not Black voters shifting to
Trump but low voter turnout that could sway results in the most
competitive states, including Georgia, Pennsylvania and Michigan.</p>
<p>Disinformation</p>
<p>Efforts to discourage voters of color from going to the polls are
being fueled by voter suppression efforts, including through social
media disinformation, said Atiba Ellis, a professor at Case Western
Reserve University School of Law.</p>
<p>“This has a long history,” Ellis told VOA, pointing to intimidation
in the 1860s by white supremacist groups to prevent recently freed
enslaved people from participating in the political process and Jim Crow
laws in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that prevented Black
people from voting.</p>
<p>A source close to the Biden campaign, who asked not to be identified
as is customary when discussing electoral strategy, said the campaign is
combating disinformation with “early and substantial investments,”
including $25 million in television and digital ad spending in August in
top battleground states focusing on Black and Hispanic media.</p>
<p>“Making sure that the right and the correct information is out
there,” the source said. “That’s how we can better combat the wrong
information, with the right information.”</p>
<p>Black Americans, a group the president calls the “backbone of the
Democratic Party,” number about 34.4 million and account for 14.0% of
eligible voters in November, according to Pew Research Center
projections.</p>

Billion Bipartisan Security Agreement in Jeopardy in US Senate</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden is calling on lawmakers to support the U.S.
Senate’s $118 billion bipartisan agreement on border security that would
also provide aid to Israel and Ukraine. But a growing number of
Republicans say they plan to withhold their support for the measure.

how WhatsApp plans to interoperate with other messaging apps</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>As noted by Wired, WhatsApp wants the messaging services it connects
with to use the same Signal Protocol to encrypt messages. Meta is also
open to apps using alternate encryption protocols so long as companies
can prove “they reach the security standards that WhatsApp outlines in
its guidance.” The third-party services will also have to sign a
contract with Meta before they plug into WhatsApp, with more details
about the agreement coming in March. ↫ Emma Roth at The Verge They way
this should work is that these megacorporations create free and open
APIs any instant messaging application can tap into. I’m not looking to
bring other services into WhatsApp; I’m looking to bring all services
together in one unified application that respects my platform’s
conventions and integrates properly with the operating systems I use. I
feel like this contractual interoperability Facebook (and Apple) is
offering is not interoperability at all, and does not reflect the spirit
of the Digital Markets Act.</p>

<p>
On Tuesday, North Dakota Republican Kelly Armstrong insisted Congress
needs to put actual muscle behind all its talk of environmental justice.
Freedom Caucus member Debbie Lesko of Arizona made an argument for
reducing worldwide greenhouse gas emissions. South Carolina’s Jeff
Duncan, who has
<a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-congress-votes/jeff-duncan/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">repeatedly
voted against</a> economic assistance for Ukraine, made the case that
the United States is all that stands between Kyiv and Putin.
</p>
<p>
Confused? Dizzy? Disoriented? I can hardly blame you.
</p>
<p>
This, unfortunately, is all part of the Republican Party’s fossil fuel
defense strategy. In the first
of<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-lawmakers-hold-first-two-hearings-bidens-lng-pause-2024-02-06/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
two hearings on the Hill</a> this week concerning the White
House’s<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/biden-lng-export-trump-campaign" target="_self">
pause on approving new permits</a> for facilities to export liquified
natural gas, Americans got a good preview, but you can plan to see a lot
more of it.
</p>
<p>
In addition to the hearings, the party will also
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/republicans-plan-broadside-targeting-bidens-lng-decision/" target="_blank">reportedly</a>
convene an “energy week” later this month to promote the
“<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/7176?s=3&r=5" target="_blank">Unlocking
Domestic LNG Potential Act</a>,” which aims to stop the Department of
Energy’s “interference” in approving LNG exports and put such decisions
in the hands of the more conservative-friendly Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission.
(<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/1130" target="_blank">Earlier
attempts</a> to do the same have so far failed to make it through the
Democrat-controlled Senate). The gameplan appears to be straight out of
The Heritage Foundation’s
<a href="https://thf_media.s3.amazonaws.com/project2025/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf" target="_blank">Project
2025</a> playbook for a Republican presidential victory this
November.<br/>
</p>
<p>
In practice, the strategy looked a lot like Republicans on the House
Energy, Climate, and Grid Security Subcommittee raising traditionally
liberal talking points to undermine the Biden administration’s order. By
their topsy-turvy logic, the administration should not pause approving
new export terminals because natural gas is the cleanest fossil fuel,
and thus our best bet for fighting climate change — an argument that is
still under
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/lng-exports-pause-biden-emissions" target="_self">considerable
debate</a> in the scientific community, and coming from these folks is
especially weird. It’s not every day you hear a Republican witness
praise “the world’s call for cleaner energy,” as Toby Rice, the CEO of
the largest U.S. natural gas producer, EQT Corp., did on Tuesday.
</p>
<p>
House Republicans kept up their Opposite Day bit by:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Insisting Biden take into account the “environmental justice” of
low-income Americans whose electricity could be affected by a
hypothetical end to natural gas production — something that, to be
clear, is not currently on the table. They also cited the human rights
of miners in the Congo and China who toil for the minerals used in
renewable energy production. While that is
<a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/07062023/mining-clean-energy-human-rights/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a
concern for sure</a>, it was hard not to feel the cynicism of the
argument when Americans near LNG export terminals
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/lng-front-line-communities-louisiana" target="_self">suffer
greatly, too</a>.
</li>
<br/>
<li>
Making the case that un-pausing LNG permitting is critical to America’s
continued support of European allies in the face of Russian aggression —
even when many of them have voted to <em>block</em> Ukrainian aid and
will even
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/06/us/politics/border-ukraine-israel-aid-congress.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">do
so again later today</a>.
</li>
<br/>
<li>
Eric Cormier, a Republican witness and the senior vice president of
entrepreneurship and strategic initiatives at the Southwest Louisiana
Economic Development Alliance, claimed investment in the export
terminals is necessary because coastal Louisiana needs to rebuild from
its repeated hurricanes and floods — apparently
<a href="https://www.wwno.org/coastal-desk/2022-03-03/climate-change-could-prove-more-deadly-in-louisiana-without-immediate-action-report-says" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">missing
the irony</a> of making such an argument in a warming world. He also
dismissed the pollution caused by LNG, claiming the export terminals are
not built near significant population centers, and in doing so confirmed
the fears of frontline residents who say their health and livelihoods
have been intentionally
<a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/energy/article/Gulf-Coast-residents-fear-they-live-in-sacrifice-17443457.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sacrificed</a>
for the sake of industry.
</li>
<br/>
<li>
Rice, the natural gas CEO, also claimed that the Biden administration’s
LNG pause is part of an activist “playbook” of delaying and introducing
uncertainty, even when delay and doubt are
<a href="https://news.ucsb.edu/2022/020729/denial-doubt-and-delay#:~:text=Further%2C%20the%20study%20found%20that,decades%20of%20misleading%20public%20messaging." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">literally</a>
out of the <em>fossil fuel</em> playbook against <em>climate change
action</em>.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Needless to say, the whole charade could make you start to feel a bit
loopy, and that was even before an argument broke out over the meaning
of the words “pause” versus “ban.” Republicans repeatedly used the
B-word to refer to the LNG permitting pause, though Republican witness
Brigham McCown, the director of the Hudson Institute’s American Energy
Security Initiative, put his foot in his mouth when he claimed, “This is
a ban, and I don’t think we’re going to see the pause end until after
the presidential election.”
</p>
<p>
Democrats and their lone witness, lawyer Gillian Gianetti of the Natural
Resources Defense Council, put on a good (if weary) face pushing back on
Republicans. “The repeated references to this action as a ban, as a fan
of<em> The Princess Bride</em>, makes me think of Inigo Montoya,”
Gianetti quipped at one point: “They keep saying the word ban, but I
don’t think they know what it means.”
</p>
<p>
But ranking member Diana DeGette of Colorado perhaps encapsulated the
hearing best in her opening round of questioning. “I can’t help sitting
here thinking that the silly season has begun,” she told her colleagues.
</p>
<p>
She’s not wrong, either. Silly season is just
<a href="https://www.energy.senate.gov/hearings/2024/2/full-committee-hearing-to-examine" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">getting
started</a>.

right to repair: sellers will be liable for a year after products are
fixed</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-06, from: OS News</p>
<p>Europe’s right-to-repair rules will force vendors to stand by their
products an extra 12 months after a repair is made, according to the
terms of a new political agreement. Consumers will have a choice between
repair and replacement of defective products during a liability period
that sellers will be required to offer. The liability period is slated
to be a minimum of two years before any extensions. The rules require
spare parts to be available at reasonable prices, and product makers
will be prohibited from using “contractual, hardware or software related
barriers to repair, such as impeding the use of second-hand, compatible
and 3D-printed spare parts by independent repairers,” the Commission
said. ↫ Jon Brodkin at Ars Technica An excellent set of rules, and once
again puts the EU at the forefront of consumer protection. Maybe some of
it will trickle down to other places in the world.</p>

Apple to EU: “Go fuck yourself” (06 Feb 2024)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-06, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links Apple to EU: “Go fuck yourself”: The dictionary
definition of malicious compliance. Hey look at this: Delights to
delectate. This day in history: 2004, 2009, 2014, 2019, 2023 Colophon:
Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing
projects, current reading Apple to EU: “Go fuck yourself” (permalink)
There’s a strain of anti-anti-monopolist that insists that they’re not
pro-monopoly – they’re just realists who understand that global
gigacorporations are too big to fail, too big to jail, and that
governments can’t hope to rein them in. Trying to regulate a tech giant,
they say, is like trying to regulate the weather. This ploy is cousins
with Jay Rosen’s idea of “savvying,” defined as: “dismissing valid
questions with the insider’s, ‘and this surprises you?’”
https://twitter.com/jayrosen_nyu/status/344825874362810369?lang=en In
both cases, an apologist for corruption masquerades as a pragmatist who
understands the ways of the world, unlike you, a pathetic dreamer who
foolishly hopes for a better world. In both cases, the apologist
provides cover for corruption, painting it as an inevitability, not a
choice. “Don’t hate the player. Hate the game.” The reason this foolish
nonsense flies is that we are living in an age of rampant corruption and
utter impunity. Companies really do get away with both literal and
figurative murder. Governments really do ignore horrible crimes by the
rich and powerful, and fumble what rare, few enforcement efforts they
assay. Take the GDPR, Europe’s landmark privacy law. The GDPR
establishes strict limitations of data-collection and processing, and
provides for brutal penalties for companies that violate its rules. The
immediate impact of the GDPR was a mass-extinction event for Europe’s
data-brokerages and surveillance advertising companies, all of which
were in obvious violation of the GDPR’s rules. But there was a curious
pattern to GDPR enforcement: while smaller, EU-based companies were
swiftly shuttered by its provisions, the US-based giants that conduct
the most brazen, wide-ranging, illegal surveillance escaped unscathed
for years and years, continuing to spy on Europeans. One (erroneous) way
to look at this is as a “compliance moat” story. In that story, GDPR
requires a bunch of expensive systems that only gigantic companies like
Facebook and Google can afford. These compliance costs are a “capital
moat” – a way to exclude smaller companies from functioning in the
market. Thus, the GDPR acted as an anticompetitive wrecking ball,
clearing the field for the largest companies, who get to operate without
having to contend with smaller companies nipping at their heels:
https://www.techdirt.com/2019/06/27/another-report-shows-gdpr-benefited-google-facebook-hurt-everyone-else/
This is wrong. Oh, compliance moats are definitely real – think of the
calls for AI companies to license their training data. AI companies can
easily do this – they’ll just buy training data from giant media
companies – the very same companies that hope to use models to replace
creative workers with algorithms. Create a new copyright over training
data won’t eliminate AI – it’ll just confine AI to the largest, best
capitalized companies, who will gladly provide tools to corporations
hoping to fire their workforces:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/09/ai-monkeys-paw/#bullied-schoolkids
But just because some regulations can be compliance moats, that doesn’t
mean that all regulations are compliance moats. And just because some
regulations are vigorously applied to small companies while leaving
larger firms unscathed, it doesn’t follow that the regulation in
question is a compliance moat. A harder look at what happened with the
GDPR reveals a completely different dynamic at work. The reason the GDPR
vaporized small surveillance companies and left the big companies
untouched had nothing to do with compliance costs. The Big Tech
companies don’t comply with the GDPR – they just get away with violating
the GDPR. How do they get away with it? They fly Irish flags of
convenience. Decades ago, Ireland started dabbling with offering
tax-havens to the wealthy and mobile – they invented the duty-free
store:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duty-free_shop#1947%E2%80%931990:_duty_free_establishment
Capturing pennies from the wealthy by helping them avoid fortunes they
owed in taxes elsewhere was terribly seductive. In the years that
followed, Ireland began aggressively courting the wealthy on an
industrial scale, offering corporations the chance to duck their
obligations to their host countries by flying an Irish flag of
convenience. There are other countries who’ve tried this gambit – the
“treasure islands” of the Caribbean, the English channel, and elsewhere
– but Ireland is part of the EU. In the global competition to help the
rich to get richer, Ireland had a killer advantage: access to the EU,
the common market, and 500m affluent potential customers. The Caymans
can hide your money for you, and there’s a few super-luxe stores and
art-galleries in George Town where you can spend it, but it’s no Champs
Elysees or Ku-Damm. But when you’re competing with other countries for
the pennies of trillion-dollar tax-dodgers, any wins can be turned into
a loss in an instant. After all, any corporation that is footloose
enough to establish a Potemkin Headquarters in Dublin and fly the
trídhathach can easily up sticks and open another Big Store HQ in some
other haven that offers it a sweeter deal. This has created a global
race to the bottom among tax-havens to also serve as regulatory havens –
and there’s a made-in-the-EU version that sees Ireland, Malta, Cyprus
and sometimes the Netherlands competing to see who can offer the most
impunity for the worst crimes to the most awful corporations in the
world. And that’s why Google and Facebook haven’t been extinguished by
the GDPR while their rivals were. It’s not compliance moats – it’s
impunity. Once a corporation attains a certain scale, it has the excess
capital to spend on phony relocations that let it hop from jurisdiction
to jurisdiction, chasing the loosest slots on the strip. Ireland is a
made town, where the cops are all on the take, and two thirds of the
data commissioner’s rulings are eventually overturned by the federal
court: https://www.iccl.ie/digital-data/iccl-2023-gdpr-report/ This is a
problem among many federations, not just the EU. The US has its
onshore-offshore tax- and regulation-havens (Delaware, South Dakota,
Texas, etc), and so does Canada (Alberta), and some Swiss cantons are,
frankly, batshit:
https://lenews.ch/2017/11/25/swiss-fact-some-swiss-women-had-to-wait-until-1991-to-vote/
None of this is to condemn federations outright. Federations are
(potentially) good! But federalism has a vulnerability: the autonomy of
the federated states means that they can be played against each other by
national or transnational entities, like corporations. This doesn’t mean
that it’s impossible to regulate powerful entities within a federation –
but it means that federal regulation needs to account for the risk of
jurisdiction-shopping. Enter the Digital Markets Act, a new Big Tech
specific law that, among other things, bans monopoly app stores and
payment processing, through which companies like Apple and Google have
levied a 30% tax on the entire app market, while arrogating to
themselves the right to decide which software their customers may run on
their own devices:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/06/07/curatorial-vig/#app-tax Apple has
responded to this regulation with a gesture of contempt so naked and
broad that it beggars belief. As Proton describes, Apple’s DMA plan is
the very definition of malicious compliance:
https://proton.me/blog/apple-dma-compliance-plan-trap Recall that the
DMA is intended to curtail monopoly software distribution through app
stores and mobile platforms’ insistence on using their payment
processors, whose fees are sky-high. The law is intended to extinguish
developer agreements that ban software creators from informing customers
that they can get a better deal by initiating payments elsewhere, or by
getting a service through the web instead of via an app. In response,
Apple, has instituted a junk fee it calls the “Core Technology Fee”:
EUR0.50/install for every installation over 1m. As Proton writes, as
apps grow more popular, using third-party payment systems will grow less
attractive. Apple has offered discounts on its eye-watering payment
processing fees to a mere 20% for the first payment and 13% for
renewals. Compare this with the normal – and far, far too high – payment
processing fees the rest of the industry charges, which run 2-5%. On top
of all this, Apple has lied about these new discounted rates, hiding a
3% “processing” fee in its headline figures. As Proton explains, paying
17% fees and EUR0.50 for each subscriber’s renewal makes most software
businesses into money-losers. The only way to keep them afloat is to use
Apple’s old, default payment system. That choice is made more attractive
by Apple’s inclusion of a “scare screen” that warns you that demons will
rend your soul for all eternity if you try to use an alternative payment
scheme. Apple defends this scare screen by saying that it will protect
users from the intrinsic unreliability of third-party processors, but as
Proton points out, there are plenty of giant corporations who get to use
their own payment processors with their iOS apps, because Apple decided
they were too big to fuck with. Somehow, Apple can let its customers
spend money with Uber, McDonald’s, Airbnb, Doordash and Amazon without
terrorizing them about existential security risks – but not mom-and-pop
software vendors or publishers who don’t want to hand 30% of their
income over to a three-trillion-dollar company. Apple has also reserved
the right to cancel any alternative app store and nuke it from Apple
customers’ devices without warning, reason or liability. Those app
stores also have to post a one-million euro line of credit in order to
be considered for iOS. Given these terms, it’s obvious that no one is
going to offer a third-party app store for iOS and if they did, no one
would list their apps in it. The fuckery goes on and on. If an app
developer opts into third-party payments, they can’t use Apple’s payment
processing too – so any users who are scared off by the scare screen
have no way to pay the app’s creators. And once an app creator opts into
third party payments, they can never go back – the decision is
permanent. Apple also reserves the right to change all of these policies
later, for the worse (“I am altering the deal. Pray I don’t alter it
further” -D. Vader). They have warned developers that they might change
the API for reporting external sales and revoke developers’ right to use
alternative app stores at its discretion, with no penalties if that
screws the developer. Apple’s contempt extends beyond app marketplaces.
The DMA also obliges Apple to open its platform to third party browsers
and browser engines. Every browser on iOS is actually just Safari
wrapped in a cosmetic skin, because Apple bans third-party
browser-engines:
https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/13/kitbashed/#app-store-tax But, as
Mozilla puts it, Apple’s plan for this is “as painful as possible”:
https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/26/24052067/mozilla-apple-ios-browser-rules-firefox
For one thing, Apple will only allow European customers to run
alternative browser engines. That means that Firefox will have to “build
and maintain two separate browser implementations — a burden Apple
themselves will not have to bear.” (One wonders how Apple will treat
Americans living in the EU, whose Apple accounts still have US billing
addresses – these people will still be entitled to the browser choice
that Apple is grudgingly extending to Europeans.) All of this sends a
strong signal that Apple is planning to run the same playbook with the
DMA that Google and Facebook used on the GDPR: ignore the law, use
lawyerly bullshit to chaff regulators, and hope that European federalism
has sufficiently deep cracks that it can hide in them when the enforcers
come to call. But Apple is about to get a nasty shock. For one thing,
the DMA allows wronged parties to start their search for justice in the
European federal court system – bypassing the Irish regulators and
courts. For another, there is a global movement to check corporate
power, and because the tech companies do the same kinds of fuckery in
every territory, regulators are able to collaborate across borders to
take them down. Take Apple’s app store monopoly. The best reference on
this is the report published by the UK Competition and Markets
Authority’s Digital Markets Unit:
https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/63f61bc0d3bf7f62e8c34a02/Mobile_Ecosystems_Final_Report_amended_2.pdf
The devastating case that the DMU report was key to crafting the DMA –
but it also inspired a US law aimed at forcing app markets open:
https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/2710 And a
Japanese enforcement action:
https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Japan-to-crack-down-on-Apple-and-Google-app-store-monopolies
And action in South Korea:
https://www.reuters.com/technology/skorea-considers-505-mln-fine-against-google-apple-over-app-market-practices-2023-10-06/
These enforcers gather for annual meetings – I spoke at one in London,
convened by the Competition and Markets Authority – where they compare
notes, form coalitions, and plan strategy:
https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/cma-data-technology-and-analytics-conference-2022-registration-308678625077
This is where the savvying breaks down. Yes, Apple is big enough to run
circles around Japan, or South Korea, or the UK. But when those
countries join forces with the EU, the USA and other countries that are
fed up to the eyeballs with Apple’s bullshit, the company is in serious
danger. It’s true that Apple has convinced a bunch of its customers that
buying a phone from a multi-trillion-dollar corporation makes you a
member of an oppressed religious minority:
https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/12/youre-holding-it-wrong/#if-dishwashers-were-iphones
Some of those self-avowed members of the “Cult of Mac” are willing to
take the company’s pronouncements at face value and will dutifully
repeat Apple’s claims to be “protecting” its customers. But even that
credulity has its breaking point – Apple can only poison the well so
many times before people stop drinking from it. Remember when the
company announced a miraculous reversal to its war on right to repair,
later revealed to be a bald-faced lie?
https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/22/vin-locking/#thought-differently Or
when Apple claimed to be protecting phone users’ privacy, which was also
a lie? https://pluralistic.net/2022/11/14/luxury-surveillance/#liar-liar
The savvy will see Apple lying (again) and say, “this surprises you?”
No, it doesn’t surprise me, but it pisses me off – and I’m not the only
one, and Apple’s insulting lies are getting less effective by the day.

us in a second and we’ll get on with the show, but first, a word from
our sponsor.

</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>Hello. I’m Robinson Meyer, the founding
executive editor of Heatmap News.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jesse Jenkins:</strong> And I’m Jesse Jenkins, an energy systems
professor and climate policy expert at Princeton University.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>And you are listening to the first episode of
Shift Key, a new podcast about climate change and the shift away from
fossil fuels from Jesse and me, brought to you by Heatmap News. On
today’s episode, we are going to talk about the President’s decision
last month to pause approvals for new export terminals for liquefied
natural gas. I think it’s been the biggest climate story of the past few
weeks. It, as you have already heard, is quite complicated. We’re also
going to talk about our upshifts and downshifts for the week. So let’s
get into it!
</p>
<p>
Last month, Jesse, the Biden administration temporarily stopped
approving new liquefied natural gas export terminals. They said this was
going to allow the energy department to study the effects they would
have on the climate, that exporting liquefied natural gas would have on
the climate, and it was basically taken kind of immediately as a victory
for climate activists. The President said in a statement that, “During
this period we will take a hard look at the impacts of LNG exports on
energy costs, America’s energy security, and our environment. This pause
on new LNG approvals sees the climate crisis for what it is: the
existential threat of our time.”
</p>
<p>
You have written about, or you’ve tweeted about, this pause. I have
written a little about it. I think it’s kind of worth flagging that
there is something weird about this whole policy discussion. The
announcement is that the President has decided to pause new approvals
from the energy department of new export terminals of liquefied natural
gas. It is not clear what terminals exactly we’re talking about. Because
there are some terminals that are already operating, there are some that
are under construction—those have already been approved, those aren’t
affected by this announcement at all. And then there’s like, some number
of terminals in the pipeline. What’s even at the heart of this
discussion? What did the President actually do, Jesse, and what
terminals are we actually talking about? Because I think there’s tons of
numbers floating around about the effect that this pause will have or
not have—what is the scale of even the export infrastructure that we’re
talking about?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins: </strong>Yeah so it’s important to get our heads around
the scale of LNG, or liquefied natural gas exports already, which have
really surged in just a few years’ time to a pretty significant scale.
So already, existing export terminals in the U.S. can export about, or
can consume about, 10% of all U.S. natural gas production, as of 2023.
So that’s a big chunk. One tenth of all the gas that we’ve produced in
the country can be shipped out of these existing export terminals.
That’s up from zero as recently as 2016. So this is all very recent
construction. And already under construction are another set of
terminals that have their permits approved, are unaffected by this
recent decision by the President. Those would basically double our
current export capacity. They would be able to consume about 11% more of
2023 gas production. And then beyond those ones which already have their
financing lined up and are under construction, there’s a bunch of
additional terminals that have already been approved as well, but
haven’t quite lined up the financing and long-term offtake or buyer
agreements they need to turn a shovel and get started. Those, if all
completed, and there’s no guarantee that they would finish, but if all
completed, that would almost be equivalent to total U.S. current exports
again, so another 9% of all U.S. gas production.
</p>
<p>
So, what we’re talking about here is the next tranche of terminals that
are seeking approval now, but haven’t lined up their permits from both
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Department of Energy.
They are charged by Congress both with determining the environmental
impact and also whether these terminals are in the public interest. Any
exports of natural gas have to be approved as “in the public interest.”
We’ll come back a bit later to how exactly we think about that term. So
what this pause is doing is basically saying, “Hey, we’ve added a ton of
terminals very quickly. We’ve got a lot more in the pipeline, coming up
soon. And we have yet more terminals asking for approval. Maybe we
should pause and rethink whether or not that scale of export is in the
public interest.” And the biggest terminal that is at sort of the heart
of this debate right now is—I’m going to reveal my lack of Louisiana
French here—but, Calcasieu Pass or CP2. So this is the second and very
large expansion of an existing terminal in Louisiana on the Gulf Coast
near the Texas border. So this is a big terminal that already exists.
The new one would be, I think the largest yet. It’s about a 10 billion
dollar project. And it itself, that single facility, could consume about
3% of all U.S. gas production today.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> I think that’s a very important point, just to
go back to what you were saying earlier, which is there’s a set of
export terminals already operating—today those consume about 10% of U.S.
natural gas. We are locked in to roughly double that, to more than
double that, without anything related to this decision.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins:</strong> And we could even triple it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>And we could even triple it basically if
everything that already has approvals is built. And that’s not
necessarily likely. When you talk to energy analysts, they’re like,
“Projects get approved here that will never actually get built or secure
the financing.” But we could triple it. And so to some degree, this
whole discussion—maybe this is a very poor way to frame it—but we are
talking about an increase in LNG export capacity that is so far down the
road. And also, so removed in some ways, from what’s actually concretely
going to happen in the economy—like, what is already locked in—that in
some ways it just gives perspective to the whole conversation. Because
we are not talking about whether there’s going to be more LNG in 2027.
The U.S. is going to be exporting a huge amount more—potentially
double—the amount of LNG that it’s exporting now in 2027 or in 2030. We
are talking about how many <em>additional</em> LNG terminals on top of
that that the U.S. builds, which presumably would then be operating for
several decades to come, right? Operating through the 2030s, through the
2040s. This is a question almost about where U.S. LNG export capacity is
going to top out and not about will we be exporting more gas in 2027
than we are now, because we know that we absolutely will be exporting
more gas in 2027.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins:</strong> That’s really important context for this,
because if you hear some of the public debate about it, or some of the
reaction from the oil industry, or the gas industry or others, they’re
trying to pin this as if Biden is saying, “No more LNG. We’re not going
to do LNG exports.” As if it were affecting our current exports, or
we’re going to cancel projects already under construction. The reality
is that that’s not true at all. And I think the way you framed it is
good. Really the question isn’t “Are we going to be able to secure our
allies in Europe right now during their current effort to shift away
from Russian natural gas?” It’s not, “Are we going to be surging
exports?” We will. It’s “What do we want the U.S.’s contribution to the
global energy supply mix to look like in the 2030s and 2040s, when the
facilities that are currently being permitted would be online and
operating?” ’Cause they’re going to operate for at least 20 years to pay
back their investors, at least that’s what they want to do if they don’t
want to become stranded assets.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> It’s kind of worth backing up here for a second
and giving context about just how much has changed in the world of LNG,
even in the past decade. Less than a decade ago, in 2016 was when the
U.S. started exporting liquefied natural gas. From that moment, from
when we started exporting LNG, to now, we have gone from obviously
having no LNG export industry, to having the world’s largest LNG export
industry—surpassing Australia and Qatar, which were previously the two
biggest LNG exporters worldwide. I wonder if you could just talk a
second about how did we even get to this place, where the U.S. is not
only exporting liquefied natural gas but determining the world’s supply
of liquefied natural gas, and where these export decisions and export
approval decisions made by the federal government have an incredibly
important role in determining just how much LNG there will be worldwide?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins: </strong>Yeah it’s actually really remarkable. The
whole story of the U.S. gas industry over the last couple decades has
been as transformative as the story around how cheap solar P.V. and
batteries have gotten, for example. When I started studying energy
topics, first got turned on to these issues in the mid 2000s, I started
researching these topics and the context for LNG at that point was that
the U.S.’s supply of natural gas had peaked and was declining. And we
were net importers of gas, and were discussing permits and approvals for
LNG <em>import</em> terminals around the country, including one proposed
for Coos Bay, Oregon, where I was going to school at the University of
Oregon. One import terminal is built in Everett, outside of Boston. But
other than that terminal, what happened instead is that we didn’t build
any of those import terminals, and the ones that had started as import
terminals, flipped the script and started to become export terminals
instead. What changed between 2005 and 2016 was the shale gas
revolution. It was just starting to take off around the time when we
were talking about imports, that companies like Mitchell Energy had
figured out how to use directional drilling and hydraulic fracturing to
unlock all of this natural gas that was stuck in tight pores within
shale formations all across the country. That transformed us from a net
importer to a net exporter of both natural gas and oil over the course
of about a decade. So, <em>huge</em> reversal. From the time President
Obama was thinking about these terminals in his administration, when we
were mostly thinking about imports, by the end of his administration
they were approving the first export terminals that then were built
under the Trump administration, and here we are now.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> I think it’s important because, first of all,
this is a kind of forgotten chapter of U.S. energy policy—like the 2006
energy bill which still shapes a ton of energy policy in the U.S., most
notably because it revamped how fuel mileage standards worked, but a
whole idea, a whole animating idea behind that law was that the U.S. was
about to run out of natural gas, which it had had in kind of limitless
supply for decades before that, and we had to figure out what we going
to do about that. But then I think at the same time, there’s this other
point that comes out of that too, which is that in this announcement
that’s going to pause export terminal approvals, Secretary of Energy
Jennifer Granholm said that the last study of how LNG affects the
climate, of how U.S. LNG exports specifically affect the climate, was
conducted in 2018. And 2018 is like 5 years ago now, I guess 6 years ago
now, which is long enough that it does make sense to go back and study
that. But if you think about it being conducted in 2018, and the
industry had only really started in 2016, I think it does actually
reveal just how outdated that study may be, and just how much has
changed in such a short period of time.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins:</strong> Yeah, it’s almost like maybe we want to pause
and take stock of how fast this is moving and think about where we want
it to go from here. I think that’s one of the most compelling arguments,
to take stock of what’s happened. Because this has been a very rapid
change in the U.S.’s role in the global energy supply mix, in the
certain geopolitical implications of that, in the implications for the
American economy, both on the supply side, the role of gas producers and
shippers and the revenues that that brings in. But also just as
importantly, the impact on U.S. natural gas prices, and the impact on
consumers and industries that depend on natural gas here, which have
also been all of a sudden dramatically affected by global markets now,
because we’re tied to, in a much bigger way, the impacts of global
demand for LNG here in the U.S.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> Before we move on and talk about what this means
broadly, I want to bring up another facet of this discussion, and
another facet of this debate. I think the Biden administration
decision—one subtext of all of the news about it—is that it caught
activists a little bit by surprise. Climate activists had begun
campaigning around the LNG export terminal issue, and they had begun
lobbying Biden to do it, but he did it very, I think earlier than was
expected, and he did it before there was full mobilization around this
idea. And that’s quite interesting. I think it’s interesting because it
reveals how the Biden administration is thinking about this, and
thinking about its relationship with activists. I think it’s interesting
because it reveals how eager the administration is to cater to climate
activists and to cater to what it sees as interests that particularly
motivate young voters. But it also means that some ideas that activists
used have just, never went through a cycle of getting talked about or
covered. I just want to talk briefly about this idea that I think
activists have particularly focused on in campaigning against these
terminals, and this is this idea of leakage. The claim that activists
have made, and the claim that the left-aligned climate movement has made
is that liquified natural gas is not only bad for the climate, it’s
actually worse for the climate than coal. When energy experts tend to
think about natural gas, they’re like, “Well, it’s bad if it replaces
renewables but it’s good if it replaces coal.” And the claim that the
climate movement has made is basically, “No no no. It’s actually
<em>worse </em>than coal.”
</p>
<p>
There’s been a lot of citations of this one study by Robert Howarth who
is a professor at Cornell. The study has not been peer-reviewed to my
knowledge, it has also not been published in a major scientific journal,
or in a scientific journal. In fact, the version if you find it online,
is basically a PDF. What he claims in the study, which I should say is
not what the conventional take on LNG has been, is that if you count up
all the leakage, all the places across the natural gas systems—the
pipelines, the storage containers, the tankers—if you count all the
places where methane leaks out of the system, then natural gas, and
especially liquified natural gas, is worse than coal. It’s 30% worse.
And if you move LNG across the ocean on particularly old tankers that
are very leaky, than natural gas is not only 30% worse than coal, it’s
three times worse than coal for the climate. And this set of claims
about leakage is interesting because I would say, first of all, it’s a
very hard set of claims to reconcile with what the conventional energy
accounting is on leakage. But number two, Bill McKibben wrote about it
for <em>The New Yorker</em>, it’s kind of permeated the discourse
without a lot of interrogation of whether it is true per se. And that
isn’t to say that it has to be true for the Biden administration to have
made the correct decision here, but it is an extremely important piece
of the messaging and the rhetoric around this decision that has not
really been interrogated at all yet.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins: </strong>Yeah and there is a wider range of literature
on this which Howarth has contributed to over the years in peer-reviewed
journals, but is not of course the only one looking at this question and
the sort of wider range of literature shows a bit of a different
picture. I took a look at the working paper from Howarth. There is a
story you can tell if you add it up in a certain way, that there are
some shipments of LNG that have very high leakage rates that could be on
par with or worse than coal-fired power, that it might displace on the
other end. But it is contained to certain circumstances, like you
mentioned the really old tankers, that don’t capture the gas that boils
off as liquified natural gas is shipped and gets hot enough to start to
evaporate, turn back into a gas. We should probably mention, to keep LNG
liquid, you have to cool it to minus several hundred degrees in order to
keep it in a liquid state and make it dense enough to ship on these
tankers. And so that takes a lot of energy, but it also means that some
of it boils off, effectively, as it gets above that liquefied point as
it ships. Older tankers will vent that to the atmosphere as methane, and
methane is a very potent greenhouse gas, particularly on short time
horizons. It doesn’t live in the atmosphere as long as CO2, because it’s
photodegraded in the atmosphere by sunlight, and breaks down into its
constituent parts over time. So the potency of methane relative to CO2
really depends on what time period you’re looking at. So in the
scientific literature there’s two shorthands for this that are commonly
used. One is the global warming potential over a twenty year period, and
the other is the global warming potential over a hundred year period, so
GWP20 and GWP100. Basically what that does is tries to integrate the
total warming impact that methane emissions or other non-CO2 greenhouse
gases have over that time period and then compare it to the amount of
impact that a ton of CO2 would have. CO2 is very different from the
other greenhouse gases because it’s basically permanent, once it’s up in
the atmosphere, it will stay there for centuries, because the processes
that pull CO2 out of the atmosphere are very slow. It’s, you know,
weathering of rocks on geologic time scales, a little bit of absorption
in the oceans each year on net, and so it takes a very long time for CO2
to come out of the atmosphere. For human purposes, it’s effectively
permanent.
</p>
<p>
So if you care a lot about short term impacts, over the next ten or
fifteen or twenty years—and you might care a lot about that if you think
we’re close to certain irreversible tipping points in the climate
system, then you care a lot more about methane than you do about CO2.
But if you think that what really matters is the long term total
concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere, because that’s what’s going to
drive long term equilibrium warming impacts—the flip side of methane not
lasting very long, is if we cut it, it will very quickly affect
temperature. So it’s a much more direct kind of thermostat knob to turn
on than CO2. It’s closer to true that methane is a flow problem and CO2
is a stock problem, so it’s about the cumulative amount of CO2, versus
about the annual emissions of methane. Say we focus on CO2 now, and then
we cut methane in ten to fifteen years, that will have a very immediate
impact on warming circa 2050. Whereas if we focus on methane now and let
CO2 accumulate, that’ll have a near-term impact, in the 2030s and 40s,
but it will potentially lead to greater warming in the long term. So
it’s a really complicated picture. Where you come out on the coal versus
gas side of things really hinges a lot on whether you’re looking at this
near-term impact or this centuries-scale impact. And whether you’re
assuming that we are using very old leaky container ships for LNG
shipment, or the more modern ones that don’t let all that energy in that
methane get wasted, they capture that methane on board, and use it to
power the engines and cooling equipment that keeps the LNG liquid
throughout the shipment. And Howarth’s paper actually looks at that too,
and shows that for modern tankers, the impact is much smaller than for
the worst case scenario.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> This question about the 20-year versus 100-year
horizon, this is the actual disagreement at the heart of the Howarth
paper. Is this right, that basically everyone knows that these LNG
systems are somewhat leaky—it’s that if you’re looking at a 100-year
timescale, you care less about those leaks because the methane that
leaks out is degraded by the time you get to year 25 or year 50, and
that warming potential that the leaked methane contributed is kind of
gone. But if you look at a 20-year timescale, you care a lot because of
the greater role that leaky methane plays on short timescales. Is that
right?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins:</strong> I think that’s one. I think there’s three
things that you have to do in order to come up with the numbers that
Howarth does. One is, you have to focus on the 20-year potential. Two
is, you have to focus on worst-case leakage scenarios rather than more
optimistic scenarios or more forward-looking scenarios that reflect the
fact that all of these new exports are going to be carried on modern
ships that don’t allow that gas to be wasted. They consume it and use it
as their fuel instead of diesel. So that has a much more modest
emissions impact. And then also that we’re not going to be significantly
reducing methane emissions from the U.S. oil and gas supply chain, which
is the current policy of the Biden administration, right? With the
methane fee that was established by the Inflation Reduction Act and
passed by Congress last session, and methane regulations that were
finalized at the EPA under the Biden administration in December, both of
which should significantly reduce methane leaks across the U.S. side of
that supply chain. So if you look at, say, 2030, when CP2 might be
coming online, by that point, if those policies work as intended, U.S.
leakage rates should be much lower than they are now, and the modern
ships that are built to carry LNG from these new terminals that we’re
building now, will avoid those significant shipment-related leakage that
gives you the worst case picture.
</p>
<p>
Those are two big pieces: the 20 year versus 100 year potential, and
your pessimism or optimism about leakage. There’s a third piece, which I
think we can get into a little bit later, which is what scenarios you
assume about what all of that U.S. LNG displaces on the global stage.
And if part of that is displacing other people’s natural gas production,
which is very likely, then the leakage is very true on both sides of the
pond, right? There is leakage in Russia which is actually huge—one of
the worst in the world. There’s leakage in other gas producing regions
that if we might be displacing, and if you count that on 20-year
timescales, it’s also very large. And so the offsetting effect of
displacing other production is also quite relevant, and I didn’t see
that taken into account in Howarth’s work.
</p>
<p>
[AD BREAK]
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> Since this news came out, I think there’s been a
lot of discussion online that says, you know, about whether this is
necessarily the optimal choice. Whether this is necessarily, could we be
using that gas to do something else? How should we be managing it? And I
just want to make a point before we go on that This is literally what
climate policy means. There’s a sense I see from some places, which is
like, well, “Is cutting off fossil fuel exports at this very arbitrary
place, the optimal policy?” And I just want to make the point that like,
number one, we are not on an optimal policy pathway at all. And in the
absence of a policy that I think both you and I think is very unlikely
to pass, which is a globally normalized carbon price that’s imposed
evenly in all jurisdictions and is priced at a level that we can attain
the 1.5C or 1.6C, whatever end temperature goal we want to achieve—
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins:</strong> Yeah, I’m going to go ahead and say that’s
unlikely.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>Yes, in the absence of a global carbon price
that is uniformly enforced across all jurisdictions, we are going to
make suboptimal decisions. And not only are we gonna make suboptimal
decisions, but we are going to stop investing in fossil fuels below what
would be economically optimal if climate change didn’t exist. That’s
literally what climate change means. And at the same time, we are going
to invest above what would be economically optimal in all of these
fossil fuels if you take climate change into account, because that is
the signal failure of global climate policy, is that we keep plowing
money into fossil fuels and under-investing in alternatives and in
scaling up alternatives. We’ve underinvested in those things for at
least twenty years. That’s a different show about whether we’re still
doing it or how much we’re still doing it. I just want to get into this
whole discussion by saying when we talk about whether we’re fiddling
knobs in the right way, or enough this way, or enough that way, or
whether we’re taking all these things into account, we are never going
to do this <em>perfectly</em>. And the whole point of climate change is
at some point you just have to stop investing in the fossil fuel system.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins: </strong>Yeah, economists call this the second best
policy or third best policy. I just call it “the real world.” We’re all
just muddling through all the time and that’s how we’re going to make
progress or not is whether we muddled through better or worse. So I
agree, it’s theoretically helpful to think about what an economically
ideal rationalized policy would be. But we’re so far from that world
that I think the question is, “is this better than the alternative
decision you could make about this particular thing right here?” And
hopefully, that’s the view that the Department of Energy is taking when
they think about the public interest here. It’s not like, “Well, could
we have had some more ideal climate policy that meant we were doing
something else over in this other part of the economy instead of doing
this?” That’s an interesting conversation to have on Twitter, but maybe
not the core of the question that the DOE and the Biden administration
are grappling with right here.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>Yeah. So I think at the heart of this whole
thing, including at the heart of this question of what’s in the public
interest, is this question of trade-offs. Because when we export
liquefied natural gas in the U.S., we’re making a series of trade-offs
about how the U.S. energy system should work, and how American consumers
and Americans living among energy infrastructure should interact with
that energy system, and we’re also making a series of trade-offs about
how the world should power itself, and what kind of fuels the world
should use. At the most basic level there’s this question of, you know,
if you export liquefied natural gas and countries burn it instead of
coal, that’s good. And if you export liquefied natural gas and countries
burn it instead of building renewables, that’s bad. That is the most
basic calculation here. But it is actually very, very hard to know which
of those two paths you’re taking as you continue to increase LNG export
capacity across the U.S. and as you export every additional ton of
liquefied natural gas.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins:</strong> Yeah that’s right and it’s even more
complicated, because what you basically have are similar but
counter-acting and opposite effects on both sides of the trade equation.
So whatever’s happening abroad in terms of natural gas displacing
something there, we’re having the opposite effect here, which is that
our natural gas prices go up, and we’re consuming less natural gas, so
something is substituting for natural gas here, and is that coal or is
that renewables? And it’s sort of the flip-side of the coin. So let’s
sort of unpack that. There’s a really useful if simplistic framework for
this that you’d learn in a Micro Econ 202 class, which is global trade,
or the trade of a fungible good between two different regions—the
underpinning of all of the modern economy, one part of the world can
produce something cheaper than another part of the world, so it makes
sense for the place that has the lower cost of supply to export it to
the place with the higher cost of supply. The exporting region wins
because it gets to sell more of its product at a higher price, and the
importing region wins because it gets to consume more of that product at
a lower price than if it tried to produce it domestically. So this is
sort of the basic framework for trade, and economists would describe
this using these concepts of elasticities of supply and demand, which
describes basically what happens when you either change demand to
prices, or when you change prices to demand.
</p>
<p>
The basic concept is: we’re going to be exporting a lot more of our
North American natural gas supplies. That effectively acts as a big
demand increase in the North American context, in the U.S. Already we’re
exporting 10% of all gas production, again it could double or even
triple with current permits that are already approved. Alright, so what
does economics tell us about what happens when demand increases? Well,
if you want to produce more, it’s going to come at a higher price. So if
we want to get more supply to meet that demand, prices in North America
and the U.S. are going to go up for natural gas to induce some of that
new supply. So now, we’re exporting more, but U.S. prices for gas are
higher, so what does that do for consumption of natural gas? Well, if
prices rise, basic economics will tell us that consumers will want to
consume less, all else equal. So we’re going to shift away from natural
gas in the U.S. as a response to that higher price.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>So if we were to build more LNG export terminals
domestically, the most likely outcome is we burn less natural gas in the
U.S., right?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins:</strong> That’s right. We pay a higher price for gas
and therefore we burn less of it here, and so the question is, what
substitutes for that demand destruction? Why are we lowering our
consumption? And there’s three ingredients to that. One is that we could
just use less of it. Our major industries like plastics that consume a
lot of natural gas to make ethane and ethaline for plastic—they are just
less competitive in the global economy, so they consume less, and that
could be one form. The other could be that we switch in the electricity
sector where gas is often the marginal supplier and kind of swings back
and forth depending on price. We could substitute either coal or
renewables in some combination to reduce our use of natural gas in the
electricity sector. So some combination of those three things: lower
consumption, greater renewable energy supply, and greater coal supply is
what’s going to drive down consumption of gas in the U.S. And obviously
those three things have very different implications for U.S. emissions.
With coal, often having been the direct substitute for gas in
electricity markets—and we often see this very direct inverse
relationship between gas and coal shares as the gas price goes up or
down. So in the near term I would expect, if gas prices go up in the
U.S., we would see all else equal, more coal-fired power generation, in
the long term maybe more renewables additions, because renewables are
also more economically attractive the higher the gas price is. I see
that a lot in the long-term modeling we do.
</p>
<p>
I want to unpack another piece of this which is that because demand for
gas declines, the increase in U.S. gas production or supply is not as
large as the increase in exports. So that’s important to keep in mind.
Say we build this facility, it’s enough to consume 3% of U.S. natural
gas supply today—that doesn’t mean that U.S. natural gas supply goes up
by 3%, because some of that additional exports is going to come from the
reduction in consumption, so freeing up current supply to export. Then
some of it, a portion of it, is going to come from increased natural gas
production in the U.S. But the sort of ratios there depend on what you
assume about how relatively responsive supply and demand are to changes
in prices. If you assume they’re equally responsive, then it’s a 50/50
split—basically half of the supply of exports comes from reducing
consumption, and half of the new exports comes from increasing supply.
Could be some other ratio if you assume, as I think is fair, that supply
tends to be more responsive to price than consumers. So that’s
interesting because if you care about leakage rates, that’s important.
The best case scenario is, the reduction in consumption comes from more
renewables, and then the increase in supply is smaller than you thought
and therefore has less methane leakage than it would otherwise have if
you count it one for one as all new exports are coming from new supply.
</p>
<p>
So I can easily construct a story here, with very plausible assumptions,
where increasing LNG exports in the U.S. is a net increase or decrease
in U.S. emissions, depending on which of those scenarios you sort of
concoct. And in either case it’s in the order of plus or minus one
percentage point of 2005 emissions, if we’re accounting for all of the
currently pending permits that could be affected by this decision. So
it’s a nontrivial amount, but it’s not huge, so the U.S. picture is
ambiguous.
</p>
<p>
If we look at the rest of the world equation, it’s the exact opposite.
We’re going to increase supply in the global stage, so that’s going to
lower prices. So how do producers and consumers respond to lower prices?
Well, the consumer side is going to increase its consumption, and some
of that is going to be new energy consumption that wouldn’t otherwise
have been economic—people are just going to consume more energy for
industry and heating and overall economic welfare. Some of that is also
going to substitute for other energy supply that would’ve been provided.
That could be renewables or coal in industry and electricity. And again,
whether you think that LNG exports are displacing coal or renewables is
a huge factor in the global climate calculus. But those lower prices are
also going to disincentivize producers elsewhere in the world, whether
it’s in Russia or Algeria or Qatar, to reduce their production of
natural gas, too. And the leakage rates that go along with that will
also fall—so methane emissions overseas will fall, and that also offsets
some of the impact here.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>In other words, because the U.S. is about to
regulate methane emissions, assuming the U.S. does regulate methane
emissions—which basically means assuming a Biden administration wins a
second term—the U.S. is about to have basically cleaner natural gas than
anywhere else.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins:</strong> Anywhere but Qatar and the Middle East.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> Yeah, and so if the effect of the U.S. exporting
some natural gas—exporting more LNG—is that it reduces natural gas
extraction in, like, Kazakhstan, which is an extremely leaky system,
then that could be good from a leak basis. If what you care about is
leaks on a 20-year time frame, you can actually construct a world where
the U.S. should export a lot of LNG because we really care about
reducing leaks globally.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins: </strong>That’s right, yeah. And so on the global
stage, again, I can come up with a story where it’s a net increase or
decrease of a few tens of millions of tons of emissions. So it’s just a
very ambiguous picture from a climate perspective. It’s not quite as cut
and dried as a simple equation would give you.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> Let me just ask a question right out that I
think gets at the discussion we just had, which is that do you think we
can say with any confidence that cutting off U.S. LNG exports at a
certain point—especially at the point that the Biden administration will
have to use at least as a minimum, which is roughly double what our
current export capacity is—do you think we can say with any confidence
that that is going to increase emissions globally? Or even do you think
we can say with any confidence that it’s going to decrease emissions
globally? Is there any way to talk confidently about what this will do
to greenhouse gas emissions globally as a result?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins:</strong> I think if we look at just the individual
facility question, just one incremental increase or decrease in U.S.
exports, I don’t think there’s any confidence. I think you can easily
say it’s a slight benefit for the global climate, I think you can easily
say it’s a slight negative for the global climate, I think my prior is
that it’s probably relatively neutral. It’s not very good or very bad.
So that’s where I sort of come out, if you’re just thinking about a
single facility. But I think the other perspective to keep in mind is,
what is the aggregate supply that we’re putting on the global stage
mean? And how consistent is that or not consistent with a global effort
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and confront climate change? So
remember, ostensibly, the world all agreed at the Paris Climate Summit
to try to reduce emissions and keep global warming in aggregate to less
than 2C and try to target aspirationally 1.5C. If you believe that the
world is committed to that goal, then there’s a great paper on this
exact question by Shuting Yang, Sara Hastings-Simon, and Arvind
Ravikumar, on whether or not we have enough carbon budget effectively
left to export the LNG that we’re planning. What they conclude is that
in the near-term, pre-2035, there’s probably a reasonable case that LNG,
where it substitutes for coal in, say, Pakistan or India or other
LNG-importing countries, is a net benefit for the global climate in the
very short term.
</p>
<p>
What they find, and I’ll just quote the abstract here, “We find that the
long-term planned LNG expansion is not compatible with Paris climate
targets of 1.5C and 2C. Here the potential for emissions reductions from
LNG through coal-to-gas switching is limited by—” the fact that, to
paraphrase, if we’re going to be on that 2C world, we’ll have already
phased out all of the coal or stopped building new coal that could be
displaced by LNG in the later half of the 2030s. So at that point, what
we’ll be doing as the U.S. is either stranding a bunch of assets, if the
world really is serious about that 2C goal, or we’ll be basically
committing to lock in more emissions than we can afford under a 2C
world.
</p>
<p>
They also, though, say that we should keep in mind that we are not on
track for a 2C world. So while the world is aspirationally pushing in
that direction, the current trajectory is more like a 3C trajectory,
where it’s likely that emerging economies will be depending on coal
through the 2030s and 2040s. And in that case, they argue that U.S. LNG
could be thought of as an insurance policy, to make some incremental
progress on emissions, and also we should say improve air quality in
emerging economies where coal-fired generation and industry is a huge
polluter that causes significant loss of life and health effects. Then
in that world it sort of maybe is a net benefit. So I come out of it as
sort of like, what world do you think we’re living in and where do you
think we’re going? Do you act as if we’re in the world that we observe
around us right now? Or do you act as if we’re going to move onto the
trajectory that we all say—the world has said we care about, a world
where we are desperately trying to reduce emissions to a level that
holds climate change below 2C.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> It’s actually kind of an unusual problem to
encounter in climate policy, but one that I wonder if we’re going to
keep hitting as we get deeper and deeper into the transition. There’s a
lot of things that you can do to fight climate change. They are both the
things you should do anyway, and insurance against a 3C or 4C world.
Insurance against a catastrophically warming world. What is interesting
about LNG export, is that it doesn’t have that quality. Like, build a
lot more solar. If you’re considering whether we should just build
double, triple, quadruple U.S. current solar capacity, the answer is
basically always yes. That’s going to both cut off these extreme
catastrophic risks that the world experiences with extremely
catastrophic levels of global warming, in line with 3C, 4C warming. And
also it’s going to get us closer to accomplishing this 1.5C, 1.6C, at an
optimal, or the best-we-can-get world, right?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins:</strong> Yup.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> LNG does not work like that. There’s a very
unusual decision we have to make around it, which is: do you aim for the
world we want to hit, which is 1.5C, 1.6C, as close to our current level
of warming as possible, get to net zero as soon as we can—a world that
the U.N., that the Paris agreement, that all the countries globally have
committed to and say they want to hit—but a track that at the same time
they’re manifestly not on? Or do you want to say, well actually what we
want to do is buy insurance against 3C? But it’s a very weird insurance
product, because it says like, “well you won’t—”
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins:</strong> It’s sort of an admission of failure.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> Yeah, exactly. It’s almost like you if you were
to buy—
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins:</strong> A short!
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>Yeah.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins: </strong>You’re shorting the Paris Agreement,
effectively. You’re saying I don’t believe that the world is going to
get its act together and cut emissions fast enough to comply with our
nominal targets, so I’m going to buy a short, which is that we should
export more LNG.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> It’s like if there were a form of life insurance
that required you to amputate a couple fingers or maybe, like, a
forearm. Or the way this life insurance works is that you can never be
rich. So you know your family won’t be destitute after you die, but at
the same time, well enjoy living your life, you know you are losing a
forearm right?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins:</strong> That’s a grim analogy!
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> It’s a grim analogy but I think it’s such an
unusual decision. It’s really not a kind of decision we encounter a lot
in other policy spaces.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins:</strong> Yeah, and so I think the question for the U.S.
when you’re thinking about what do we do from a climate perspective is,
“Do we act in the world over the things that we have influence over?”
Right? Which is not what China and India and Pakistan decide to do.
Really, we can indirectly influence that. But what we have direct
influence over are decisions about U.S. energy production and our
economy and U.S. policy. And so the question is, do we use our U.S.
policy decisions and the things that we have direct influence over to
operate as if the world is going to align itself with our ostensible
targets? And with the targets that we’ve set for the country itself,
which is to cut greenhouse gas emissions rapidly and to get on track to
net zero by 2050?
</p>
<p>
Or do we say, you know what, we’ll do that for our domestic economy,
we’ll make sure that we cut our own emissions. But as far as exports go,
that’s not our responsibility, that’s up to the global stage, and what
they demand and as long as the world is demanding more gas, or oil or
coal from the U.S., we’ll supply it, because that signifies that, you
know, they’re making decisions that aren’t consistent with that world,
and we might as well supply it instead of somebody else. I think that’s
the calculus, right? It’s which world do you operate in? You can easily
make the, again, the realist take, which is like, well, what’s the point
of giving up our exports, especially if they’re marginally cleaner than
other people’s exports, if the demand is still out there, and it’s gonna
be just satisfied by Russia or by somebody else?
</p>
<p>
But it also is an admission that we just don’t believe that the world is
going to do what we are committed to doing. I think you have to ask
yourself, like, would we have more influence over the rest of the world
if we actually acted as if we believed it? And not just over our
domestic emissions, but over our exports? This is particularly relevant
for countries like Australia. They talk about this all the time, where
their domestic emissions are like one tenth of the amount of emissions
that go out the door, or on the ships with their coal and LNG exports.
So they’re a huge net exporter of energy, you know, and so it’s like, a
much more central part of the debate in Australia is like, well, what is
their responsibility as a global climate actor? Do they only have to
meet their domestic climate goals, or do they also have to take some
responsibility for their energy exports? We just really haven’t been
having that conversation at the same level in the US. And maybe that’s
exactly the point of, you know, forcing this issue right now.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>There’s another side of that though, which is,
let’s say we bet against the world’s ability to hit its own climate
targets, we build these export terminals. We are like, “Well, we’re
going to try to hit our targets. But if you want to buy gas, that’s
fine.” If the world then hits its targets, if the world keeps to its
Paris Agreement goals, then we’re the one stuck with the stranded
assets!
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins:</strong> That’s true!
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> Then suddenly, there’s all these rusty LNG
terminals sitting around the Gulf Coast that didn’t need to be built.
And that’s a hit to our economy. And so I think there’s like, to some
degree, the view where we say, “We’re just going to let the world be the
world, and we’re going to do the best we can. But if the world wants to
buy our natural gas, then we’re happy to sell it” is actually not the
most selfish way of looking at this. Because if you were to fully,
because you have to think about whether there’s actually going to be
that demand there in order to figure out whether this even makes sense
as an investment. Not that I mean, by the way—as a policy question, this
isn’t really a question about whether this, these makes sense as an
investment, because that’s presumably up to, because the only thing the
government has been asked to do is figure out whether they’re in the
public interest, that’s more a question about investors. Still, I don’t
think we want all this rusty construction that never got used sitting
around in the Gulf Coast, because we bet against the world and we bet
wrong.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins:</strong> Yeah. I mean, that’s, I think, essentially,
the question that the investors have to grapple with. And there’s
certainly a bear case and a bull case. This is why a lot of these
terminals that have been approved, don’t yet have enough contracted
demand to actually get the banks lined up and go start construction. So
I think there is really an open question about whether the demand will
even be there for these projects. In the end the case that the folks
pushing back on the Biden administration would make right now is, “Well,
that’s up to the private sector, you shouldn’t be meddling with that,
you know, if there’s demand for it, there’s demand for it, let the
private sector decide.”
</p>
<p>
I think that’s somewhat fair, because if we aren’t putting public money
behind these projects, the way we do for, say, for clean energy projects
that are getting subsidies from the U.S. for construction, then it’s
more of a private sector question. On the other hand, at the local
level, there is a lot of public support—packages here, there’s basically
tax abatements for all of these projects to encourage them to site in
Louisiana instead of Texas or Mississippi or whatever. So the states
sort of fight over it, and at the local level, one of the things I was
really struck by in the reporting that Heatmap put up recently talking
to residents near CP2 and these other terminals was, just the level of
tax abatements that have been provided for existing terminals mean that
they’re paying nothing into the local economies, public coffers. They
don’t pay local, local or state taxes. And so the communities that are
bearing the toxic and polluting impacts of these facilities in their
backyards are not getting any sort of public compensation for that. That
is an important question at the local level.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> I think it’s important to bring in this
perspective, too, because this is a whole other argument that exists
about the whole other way of even understanding this decision, which is
that there’s an entire set of activists who are engaged on this issue
who care about the climate, but that is not actually their main argument
they make. What they argue is that “These terminals go into our
communities, or people from the Gulf Coast. These terminals go into our
communities, they’re extremely pollution intensive. They give our kids
asthma. Our communities, because of how close they are to fossil fuel
extraction, and because of all these different sites, smell like rotten
eggs all the time, it smells bad. Cancer rates are very high. We don’t
want this infrastructure here. And so it’s not in our public interest to
have it.”
</p>
<p>
And when you factor in the tax abatements that gets even worse, right? I
think this is like a whole other argument against these LNG terminals,
that they are extremely pollution intensive. And what I should say is,
it’s a very bio-diverse area of the country. You know, people don’t
think about the Gulf Coast as being bio-diverse, but by the way,
Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, some of the most biodiverse areas of
the continental United States. Setting aside biodiversity, it’s bad to
have a big, cancerous, carcinogenic, hyper-polluting, smelly piece of
infrastructure next to your town. And that’s a whole other case against
these terminals. And that’s been a whole other nexus of how people have
argued about them to the Biden administration. I think that’s totally
valid.
</p>
<p>
I think what’s interesting is that that actually suggests another kind
of trade-off, right? Because if, and I don’t want to be too academic
about this, but like, if a country in Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast
Asia is deciding whether to burn coal, or to burn imported U.S. liquid
natural gas, and we don’t make that liquid natural gas available, so
they burn coal instead—that’s like bad for all the people who live
around that coal plant. Right? Now they have asthma, now they have heart
disease, and they’re interacting, not with natural gas air pollution,
which is bad but cleaner than coal. They’re interacting with coal, which
produces one of the worst kinds of power-related air pollution that
there is and is responsible for early deaths and stunted births and
stunted growth and heart disease and lung disease worldwide, and is the
main driver of global air pollution problems. I think what’s interesting
is like, how do you balance, if you’re the Biden administration, these
local concerns in the Gulf Coast, around the local air pollution effects
and local water pollution effects of an LNG terminal, with this trade
off that maybe that means people around the world have to encounter more
coal pollution? Conventional toxic air pollution from coal? Ultimately,
I think you say, “Well, look, folks in the Gulf Coast, those are Biden’s
constituents, those are Americans. And so we should rank their desire to
avoid pollution higher.” I think that lens is one that if we were to
bring to other aspects of foreign policy, or even other aspects of
climate policy, would be seen and depicted as really noxious ways to
understand foreign policy, and a really bad way to think about the world
and an unethical way to think about the world. And that’s just like
another one of these trade-offs. That’s kind of inherent in where you
draw the line that I think is really, really difficult. Very
interesting.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins: </strong>Yeah. And it all comes back to this question
of the public interest, who is the public that you’re interested in?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>Right.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins:</strong> And it’s not clear in statute, what that
means. So until the Supreme Court overthrows the Chevron Doctrine, which
we’ll talk about in another podcast, the current law of the land is that
the agencies need to interpret what that means and figure out how to
decide what’s in the public interest. So we’ll see what happens. But I
think this does raise this big question, right, who is the public that
you’re interested in here, if you’re the Biden administration, or the
Department of Energy? And you know what we’ve seen here is that there
are some pretty clear winners and losers domestically. To sum up, the
winners are gas producers and owners of LNG pipelines that shipped to
the terminals and the terminals that ship this gas overseas. Those are
the winners.
</p>
<p>
They get more money for their product, they sell more of their product,
they make more profit. And, you know, if you’re just looking at sort of
the U.S. national accounts, right, our GDP, like that’s on the positive
side of the ledger. But of course, we should also keep in mind that
there are particular people who benefit from that, right? It’s a
particular class and group of people in the U.S. that exclusively
benefit basically, from that side of the equation.
</p>
<p>
On the other side of the equation, and I think at the end of the day,
this is the part that the Biden administration will lean into, because
it’s the strongest case and the most broadly popular case against the
terminals, if they decide to, you know, justify their decision here more
aggressively. And that’s that anyone in the U.S., any business or
household or industry that consumes natural gas, is going to be paying a
higher price if we are going to export more to the world, because that’s
a big increase in demand for U.S. supply. And when demand goes up,
prices go up. Even more concerning, I think, is that the U.S. will see
much more volatile natural gas prices, the more we link our markets to
the global stage. We see this in the oil markets all the time, right?
</p>
<p>
We are a net exporter of oil, we are physically energy secure, right?
That long-sought goal of energy independence, we’ve achieved it. If
there was a conflict of war that sort of broke out tomorrow, we could
meet all of our domestic needs, without any trouble. That said, when a
crazy dictator on the other side of the world—thanks Vlad—you know,
decides to invade his neighbor right in an unprovoked war, and causes a
huge global conflict and disruption of energy supplies, prices at the
pump in Princeton, and you know, Des Moines and Denver, that goes up
overnight. Because oil is a globally traded fungible commodity. And if
demand in Europe spikes, people are willing to pay a huge amount because
supply from Russia is disrupted, that’s gonna affect the prices that we
have to pay even for the gas and oil that we produce here in the United
States. And that has not been the case, historically, right? We’ve been
a separate market for gas. While oil has been globally traded, we have
been isolated in North America, because gas is so much harder to ship
around the world than oil is.
</p>
<p>
Well with LNG, it’s, you know, it costs more to ship but it becomes easy
to ship it as a liquid just like oil. And if we are now you know, going
to be shipping something like a third of all of our supply overseas, if
there’s a conflict or weather-related disaster that knocks out supply
somewhere around the world, or a big increase in demand, you know,
because of a cold weather event, or you know, in the case of Japan,
after Fukushima, they shut down all their nuclear plants and had a huge
increase in demand for LNG overnight, like any of those kinds of global
conflicts or crises that are totally out of our control, will
immediately increase natural gas prices across the United States. Not by
as much as the global price, there’s always going to be a wedge between
the two because of shipping costs, but it will drive up prices. And
that’s exactly what we saw in 2022, when prices in the U.S. tripled,
because of the demand for LNG in Europe and Asia and elsewhere. So
that’s the clear loser side, it’s like households trying to heat
themselves in the winter, and in a year when there’s some conflict on
the other side of the world that drives up their heating prices, they
have no control over. And any U.S. industries that depend on cheap gas
to be globally competitive, and might lose market share, you know, might
have to lay off people, you know, might not contribute as much to our
economy on that side of the ledger.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> And this is not like a minor consideration
either, right? Like this is actually a significant piece of
macroeconomic policymaking. This would have a major effect on the U.S.
macroeconomy, because cheap natural gas and cheap electricity are not
like rounding errors on how the current U.S. economy is structured. Over
the past decade and a half, they have become major traits of the U.S.
economy and major determinants of U.S. global competitiveness. And
that’s not to say, by the way, that it should be cheap forever. I think
what’s going to happen over time is that we replace that cheap U.S.
natural gas as an input into electricity with cheap renewables and cheap
zero carbon electricity. But increasing U.S. natural gas costs and
increasing U.S. electricity costs is not a minor thing. That is actually
a very significant piece of macroeconomic policymaking and would matter
quite a bit to a lot of industries that have nothing to do with fossil
fuels.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins:</strong> That’s right. And I should say, this was a
question that the Obama administration looked at, I think in circa 2016
or 2014, that was looked at under the Trump administration. So they have
done these analyses in the past. And the conclusion, which is sort of
basic economics is like on net, there are gains from trade here to be
had, you know, because we’re going to be selling or producing more gas
and selling it at a higher price and earning more profits for gas
producers that offsets these other negative impacts.
</p>
<p>
But I think again, it raises the question of who is the public that you
care about? Do you just care about the aggregate GDP? Or do you care
about more about certain constituents or industries more than others,
right? Do you care that about household costs more than you care about,
you know, the profit of LNG companies? Or stockholders and gas
producers? That’s just a subjective question, right? There’s no
objective answer there. There are winners and losers in every trade
decision on both sides of the ledger, right? Both in the importing and
exporting countries.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>And do you care about commodity exports or
higher manufacturing exports? There’s a lot here.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins: </strong>Yeah, maybe you might want to pause and think
about it. And that’s where I come out after spending a week thinking
about it myself. It’s like, yeah, there’s a lot to unpack here. And
things are changing rapidly, right? The global geopolitical situation is
not at all the same as it was six years ago, or four years ago, the
climate situation is not really the same as it was, you know, six years
ago or four years ago. And, you know, the U.S. economy is shifting in
important ways, too. So maybe you want to pause and think about how far
you want to go here. That I think is the best case for the Biden
administration’s decision. It’s just like, Whoa, this is moving real
fast. Let’s slow down. And think about all of the myriad implications of
this decision on consumers, on local populations in Louisiana, on you
know, globally competitive businesses and industries that depend on
cheap gas and electricity, on our role in the global economy and
geopolitics and security as a big exporter of LNG. I mean, these are all
relevant pieces of the equation. And there isn’t really a clear cut
answer here.
</p>
<p>
[AD BREAK]
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins:</strong> All right, Rob. So what has you excited this
week? What is your upshift for the week?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> I think my upshift for the week is unusually
vehicle-related. And it is that the EIA came out with a finding this
week that hybrids, plug in hybrids, and battery electric vehicles were
16.3% of new car sales last year. That’s obviously not where we need to
be. But it represents significant growth from last year, or rather from
2020, when hybrids, plug in hybrids and battery vehicles were 12.9% of
sales. It continues to grow. I think two interesting things is that
hybrids and fully electric vehicles are kind of growing at roughly the
same rate, battery electric may be catching up. It’s good news for a lot
of reasons. I mean, does it reflect that the battery electric market is
where we would want it to be? Not necessarily but I think it’s good news
because it shows that especially as tailpipe regulations as the EPA
prepares to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from light duty vehicles,
from light duty cars and trucks, that there’s a lot of potential there
to increase the BEV and hybrid share. And especially that consumers are
recognizing that well, if they’re not ready to buy an electric vehicle
yet they should buy a hybrid, which is something that a lot of consumers
I know who bought new cars recently have gone through.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins: </strong>Yeah, I think actually what was surprising
there was the hybrid portion of that picture. I think we were all
expecting battery electric sales to increase, and you know, the question
is how much. I think that it reached about, just pure battery electric
vehicles, top 7% of all U.S. sales. But what was surprising is the
hybrid share, which was basically flat for the last several years, at
around 5% of the market, soared to over 7.5% of the market, over 1.1
million hybrids sold in 2023, about exactly the same amount of total
vehicles as battery electric vehicles. So there’s been some reporting
that like you know, people are choosing hybrids as EV demand slows, but
that’s actually not the case. It’s that instead of just EVs growing, we
have EVs growing at a 50% Share, annual increase, and all of a sudden
hybrids are back in the game! With the release of a lot of new models
that don’t really cost any more than the conventional versions. It
almost makes me wonder why we even sell the conventional versions of
some of these cars.
</p>
<p>
But I recently saw that the Hyundai Tucson hybrid cost about $600 more
than the equivalent trim of the internal combustion version. And it’s
just a better car, like it’s got 50% better fuel economy, it’s faster,
it’s got more horsepower. It’s quieter when you’re driving around the
city, like why do they even sell the other one? And so that’s sort of
why I think we’re seeing hybrid sales go up, it’s just if you’re gonna
buy an internal combustion engine car, the better internal combustion
engine car, it happens to be a hybrid now, and it doesn’t cost you an
arm and a leg more. And it pays itself back in just a matter of months
in fuel costs.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>Jesse, what’s your upshift for the week?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins:</strong> So my upshift on a little more personal note,
I just began a new teaching semester here at Princeton, and I’m teaching
my favorite class, which is the Introduction to the Electricity Sector.
We cover engineering, economics and regulation. And it’s a really fun
class. This is the fifth year I’ve been teaching it here at Princeton. I
helped teach it with my adviser at MIT for several years and kind of
adapted it when I got here to Princeton.
</p>
<p>
And it’s really running nice and smoothly now. The fifth time’s the
charm, right? So this year, it’s been fun, it’s running smoothly, we
have a big excited class. And what I really love about the class is the
mix of students in it, we have about half undergraduates and half
graduate students. And you know, maybe half of the students are from
engineering disciplines. But it really spans the entire university.
We’ve got, you know, engineering students that are interested in the
electricity sector, we’ve got policy students from the School of Public
and International Affairs, we have science and humanities and economics
and political science students. And so it’s just a really interesting
mix. And I think it reflects just how inherently interdisciplinary and
also inherently important the electricity sector is. You know, I always
find it exciting to see students from all these different backgrounds
deciding they want to spend this semester with me, learning about
electricity regulation, and thermodynamics and microeconomics
principles. So it’s gonna be a fun one.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>Yeah, that’s sweet. What’s your downshift?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins:</strong> So my downshift was news that I read this
week, it was broken by the Guardian, that the U.S. oil lobby, the
American Petroleum Institute, just took out like an eight figure media
buy, to spread the idea that fossil fuels are vital to global energy
security—not, you know, coincidental timing around the debates over LNG.
So we can expect the airwaves and the paid advertising in the newspaper
and everything to just be flooded with ads, making the case that because
the world is in crisis, and conflict, and there’s a war in the Middle
East, and there’s war in Ukraine, that that makes U.S. oil and gas
supplies so much more important for the global security situation.
Obviously they’re gonna make the most compelling case they can for their
industry, that’s their job. But I think the thing that makes me most
angry or frustrated about this, the reason that’s my downshift, is that
it ignores the part of the story where the U.S. is totally vulnerable to
these conflicts, too.
</p>
<p>
We talked about that earlier that, you know, when there’s a war, say,
Houthis interdite trade through the Suez Canal, and that disrupts all
kinds of oil shipments from the Middle East to Europe, like that isn’t
just contained in Europe, that spills over and infects the price of the
pump, and the cost of heating homes right here in the U.S. immediately.
So this idea that, you know, the oil and gas industry is so good for
security, it may be true for sort of global geopolitics and like helping
our allies overseas. But it doesn’t mean that the U.S. economy is secure
by any means. We are totally vulnerable to these conflicts around the
world. And we will be until we sever our reliance on globally traded
commodities like oil and LNG.
</p>
<p>
And the only way to do that, of course, is to accelerate the Clean
Energy Transition, to accelerate the growth of EVs, and of heat pumps
and renewable energy, that are capital investments. Once you make them,
you’re no longer dependent on what happens on the other side of the
world. And, you know, they’re not running the ad campaign making that
point.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>Well, I’m not going to claim that that’s an
upshift. But I do think that this is kind of interesting in the light of
the LNG decision, because my understanding is that that campaign was
locked in before the LNG decision was even made. And the Biden
administration I have to say while it has presided over, of course, the
U.S. drilling more oil and natural gas than it ever has before, in not
only U.S. history, but the U.S. is drilling more oil and natural gas
than any country ever before has.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins:</strong> Yeah, we’re now the Saudi Arabia of oil.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> Well, without the ability to control it, but
yeah. But I think at the same time, what this shows is that, like, the
oil industry isn’t gonna give credit for that either. Chevron just this
week announced that it was going to expand capacity again this year. And
I think that there is this kind of like realpolitik way of looking at
this, which is like, “Look, if the oil and gas industry is going to run
these giant ad campaigns against Democratic administrations, no matter
what Democratic officials actually do, then by all means Democratic
administrations should like try to slow the growth of those industries.”
</p>
<p>
I mean, that’s a very, very, like sociopathic way of looking at it. But
like, if there is this very tough question, that’s like, “Should the
U.S. do this? Who would it be bad for, who would it be good for, and the
primary beneficiaries of such a policy would be the fossil fuel industry
itself and not U.S. consumers? Then why should Biden not pause LNG
exports, right?”
</p>
<p>
My downshift for the week, speaking of capital goods, speaking of big
investments, was that Jerome Powell, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve
really made it seem like the Fed isn’t going to cut rates in March,
which is actually quite worrying me at this point. Interest rates are at
their highest point in more than 20 years. That’s really decreasing
investment in renewables and in the kind of big clean electricity and
clean energy investments that we need to fight climate change.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins:</strong> It also makes EVs more expensive to lease.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> Yeah, it’s just bad for the transition all
around. I understand the Feds’ desire to make sure that it finishes
fighting inflation. But I think inflation has been pretty much under
control for the past six months. And I’m worried that although we have
this very booming economy right now that like, it’s a little unstable,
and keeping rates too high could kill it. And I’m also just worried that
we’re not, that a lot of great investments and a lot of great investment
that’s already happened from American companies and in technologies and
infrastructure that could be built here in the U.S., is not going to
happen or companies are going to die because capital is so expensive
right now. So, that’s my downshift for the week. Y
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins:</strong> You heard it here, folks, Robinson Meyer
launching his campaign for Fed Chair. You got my vote.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> Okay. Well, this has been great. And, Jesse,
I’ll see you here next week. And thanks so much! This was fun.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins:</strong> Okay, That’s a wrap.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> Shift Key is a production of Heatmap News. The
podcast was edited by Jillian Goodman, our Editor in Chief is Nico
Lauricella, multimedia editing and audio engineering by Jacob Lambert
and Nick Woodberry. Our music is by Adam Kromelow. Thanks so much for
listening. And see you next week.

<h2 id="i-was-wrong-about-plug-in-hybrids">I Was Wrong About Plug-in
Hybrids</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-06, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTM5NTMyOC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1MjYxMDczOH0.xVTBpZi6Nm9AC0BkD7VDsA_C8gHq_pknzHw8NsXq0Gs/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
When my sister’s long-lived Scion met a sudden, destructive end last
month, she was ready to take the leap into electric. She tried one
plug-in hybrid she could find in Topeka, Kansas — an old Chevy Volt —
before rejecting it in favor of a gently used Nissan Leaf.
</p>
<p>
Across town, my parents had been car-shopping, too. And while they
thought about a plug-in hybrid as a way to dip their toes into
electrification, they found only one on the nearby lots — a used car the
dealer tried to sell above MSRP because, well, they could. Mom and dad
wound up with a traditional hybrid Hyundai crossover instead.
</p>
<p>
Such struggles are no surprise. The PHEV has become an uncommon sight as
most automakers have introduced fully electrified vehicles and,
increasingly, left the plug-in hybrid behind. However, as full EVs have
run into headwinds, the PHEV might be due for a comeback. Five years
after giving up on plug-in hybrids to go all-electric, General Motors
now
<a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/gm-reverses-all-in-ev-strategy-to-bring-back-plug-in-hybrids" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">says</a>
it will start making them again.
</p>
<p>
This is good news for a country that, frankly, needs a starter EV.
</p>
<p>
I admit it: Five years ago, when GM ditched hybrids to go fully
electric, I was glad. Yes, the Chevy Volt had shifted lots of people to
electrified driving. But the plug-in hybrid is a paragon of “jack of all
trades, master of none.”
</p>
<p>
With electric car components jammed in alongside its traditional hoses
and belts, a PHEV is never going to be a great gasoline car. And because
it must contain all the parts for petroleum propulsion, a plug-in hybrid
can fit only a small battery with a limited range. The new Toyota Prius
Prime PHEV can deliver up to 44 miles of electric driving, and that
meager figure is a major leap from the around 25 miles of the previous
model. The soon-to-be-axed
<a href="https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1138730_subaru-crosstrek-hybrid-phev-is-at-the-end-of-its-extension-cord" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Subaru
Crosstrek PHEV</a> delivers only 17 all-electric miles, and costs
thousands more than a normal gas version.
</p>
<p>
From a climate perspective, PHEVs also looked like an easy way out for
carmakers who should have been fully electrifying their lineups instead
— a way for brands like Toyota to call their cars
“<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/toyota-prius-vw-audi-kia" target="_self">electrified</a>”
without actually building battery EVs. It was a half-measure, a
“<a href="https://www.slashgear.com/1055046/the-reason-why-chevrolet-discontinued-the-volt/#:~:text=The%20end%20of%20the%20Volt&text=Rather%2C%20it%20was%20a%20stepping,Bolt%20making%20the%20Volt%20redundant." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">stepping
stone</a>,” in a world that needs to completely turn over its car fleet.
</p>
<p>
For drivers, though, the core argument for the PHEV has always been a
compelling one. Its battery range is limited, yes, but the electric
miles are probably enough to accomplish a commute or local errands.
Local electric driving drastically cuts one’s gasoline budget. On longer
trips, there’s no need for the range anxiety that comes with a true EV
since the gas engine has your back.
</p>
<p>
Yet PHEVs struggled to catch on fully during their first wave. A decade
ago, when precious few mainstream EVs were on sale, plug-in hybrids
<a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2023/trends-in-electric-light-duty-vehicles" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">accounted</a>
for about half of electrified U.S. car sales. About five years ago, when
mass-market EVs like the Tesla Model 3 and Y arrived — and the Chevy
Volt departed the scene — things changed. By 2023, PHEVs made up only 20
percent, meaning Americans bought four times as many pure EVs as plug-in
hybrids.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps the America of five years ago simply was not yet familiar enough
with electric driving to understand the benefits a plug-in hybrid could
deliver. Buyers who were truly bullish on electric, like me, jumped
right past the hybrid and bought a full EV. The fact that plug-in
hybrids cost a lot more while delivering a pittance of electric miles
didn’t help.
</p>
<p>
But that was then. In 2024, the legacy car companies sound far less
enthusiastic about their plans to electrify completely. While
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/are-ev-sales-really-slowing-data" target="_blank">EV
demand is not cratering</a>, as some apocalyptic headlines would
suggest, it is possible that electric cars are entering a holding
pattern, or at least a
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/redwood-is-exactly-what-tesla-needs" target="_self">gap
year</a> or two. Drivers willing to buy a pricey new EV have mostly done
so. Millions more are biding their time, waiting for better charging
infrastructure where they live, a wave of truly affordable EVs, or some
other factor to push them toward pure electric.
</p>
<p>
These people need a starter EV — something to get their feet wet in
electrified driving that isn’t a $40,000 new car. Now that a handful of
decent electrics have been on the market for several years, a used full
EV <em>could</em> fill that role. That’s especially true for families
that have a combustion vehicle or hybrid as their other car, and can
drive a used Chevy Bolt or Nissan Leaf around town without having to
worry so much about its diminishing battery.
</p>
<p>
Still, most Americans want their car to do everything, including a long
road trip if necessary. They should consider the PHEV. In parts of the
country without a lot of charging infrastructure, the plug-in hybrid
would make an ideal beginner EV, given the security of the gas engine to
ease one’s range anxiety.
</p>
<p>
But with the automakers having gone full electric in the past few years,
plug-in hybrids are few and far between. Toyota, which has been dragging
its feet about pure EVs, makes plug-in hybrid versions of the RAV4 and
the Prius. The Wrangler 4xe plug-in hybrid is Jeep’s signature
electrified effort so far. BMW, Kia, Hyundai, and others offer PHEV
variants of some of their vehicles (though that’s no guarantee you’ll
find the one you want at your local dealership, given their niche
status.) PHEV sales
<a href="https://www.bts.gov/content/gasoline-hybrid-and-electric-vehicle-sales" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lag
behind</a> both ordinary hybrids and full electric vehicles.
</p>
<p>
With General Motors ready to revive its plug-in hybrid line, perhaps the
technology is due to catch its second wind just as weary buyers look for
a more comfortable way to start driving on electrons. As with full
battery EVs, it comes down to price and range. If Chevy can cook up a
Volt 2.0 that impresses on both fronts, then the PHEV may finally find
its footing in the U.S.

“significant national security risk” in that the huge amount of data
they collect could be sent to China.

<p>date: 2024-02-06, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
Two years of working on Luro full time has taught me a lot about
#startuplife. While I could probably fill a book with what I’ve learned
so far, the biggest takeaway is you’re always busy if you’re on a small
team. Here’s a list of jobs that you always need to be doing when
creating a company…
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Planning new features
</li>
<li>
Building new features
</li>
<li>
Marketing new features
</li>
<li>
Updating old features
</li>
<li>
Managing technical debt
</li>
<li>
Establishing processes
</li>
<li>
Documenting everything
</li>
<li>
Hopping on calls
</li>
<li>
Getting feedback
</li>
<li>
Contacting existing customers
</li>
<li>
Acquiring new customers
</li>
<li>
Improving onboarding
</li>
<li>
Assuring quality
</li>
<li>
Filling out enterprise software acquisition forms
</li>
<li>
Evaluating software tools for internal use
</li>
<li>
Tracking competitors
</li>
<li>
Building culture
</li>
<li>
Hiring people
</li>
<li>
Managing people
</li>
<li>
Meeting payroll
</li>
<li>
Providing health insurance
</li>
<li>
Pitching VCs
</li>
<li>
Creating FOMO
</li>
<li>
Casting vision
</li>
<li>
Investor updates
</li>
<li>
Emailing lawyers
</li>
<li>
Accounting and taxes
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Not enough that we should overly glamorize entrepreneurs, but it’s a
lot. Especially, when you’re also tasked with building the darn thing.
My list doesn’t even get into the all the nuance of all the required
systems and processes you need to build either. That’s a whole other
post.

<p><span
class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Waveshare’s
PoE HAT is the first for Raspberry Pi 5</span></p>
<pre><code>        &lt;div class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/pi-5-poe-hat-waveshare.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;auto&quot; class=&quot;insert-image&quot; alt=&quot;Pi 5 PoE HAT Waveshare F&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
Power over Ethernet lets you run both power and networking to certain
devices through one Ethernet cable. It’s extremely convenient,
especially if you have a managed PoE switch, because you get the
following benefits:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
A single cable for power + Ethernet (no need for separate power
adapters)
</li>
<li>
No need to have electrical service near every device
</li>
<li>
Simple remote power on/off capability (assuming you have a managed
switch)
</li>
<li>
Centralized power management (e.g. one UPS in a rack room covering all
powered devices)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I have used the Raspberry Pi PoE and PoE+ HATs for years now, allowing
me to have 4 or 5 Raspberry Pi per 1U of rack space, with all wiring on
the front side. I also use PoE for cameras around my house, though there
are dozens of use cases where PoE makes sense.
</p>
<p>
The Raspberry Pi, since it only requires 3-10W of power, is an ideal
candidate for PoE, assuming you can find a HAT for it.

A controversial technique has produced detailed maps of the magnetic
fields in colossal galaxy clusters. If confirmed, the approach could be
used to reveal where cosmic magnetic fields come from.

<p>date: 2024-02-06, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
Stock in New York Community Bank plunged last week after it said it was
setting aside additional funds as a cushion in case some of its
commercial real estate loans went bad. The value of commercial office
space is falling as more people work from home, and investors are still
skittish. Plus, Canada extends a ban on noncitizen housing purchases.
And we’ll hear how one flour mill is rebuilding a year after the
devastating Turkey-Syria earthquake.

<p>I’m doing some writing about writing and finding the phrase “RSS,
Atom and RFD” too cumbersome. Most people don’t care and see the
distinctions as unnecessary. But I want to be accurate, and recognize
that while RSS is the most-used kind of feed, there are others, and our
software works with them. I’m trying this construction:
“RSS-compatible.” I think that expresses the most important point, the
choice of format is up to you, but now, by 2024, they all work pretty
much the same way.</p>

Regulators hate them, saying all the popularity of massive, heavy SUVs
runs counter to environmental targets. Paris even slapped some hefty
fines on SUVs parking in the city. But European consumers are showing
nothing but love for the SUV, in all shapes and sizes. In a new

The storm that dropped huge amounts of rain on Southern California
Sunday and Monday caused at least $11 billion in damages and economic
losses, according to Accuweather. Dangerous winds, flooding, and
landslides pummeled the region, hitting Los Angeles and its surrounding
neighborhoods particularly hard. The University of California at Los
Angeles recorded an incredible 12 inches of rain over 24 hours.
Landslides swept through high-income communities including Beverly
Hills, burying cars and forcing residents to evacuate.

suggests the planet has already warmed by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius
above preindustrial levels. In fact, the researchers say humans have
raised the global temperature by 1.7 degrees Celsius, or about 3.1
degrees Fahrenheit. Much of the scientific community puts current
warming at about 1.2 degrees Celsius, so this new calculation has
climate experts in a tizzy.<br/><br/>The research hinges on observations
from six sea sponges in the Caribbean Sea. These sponges are very old,
and their skeletons contain what <em>The New York Times</em>

“chemical fingerprints” of the ocean temperatures going back to 1700,
long before we started measuring in the 1850s. The findings suggest
global warming began about 40 years earlier than previously thought,
which means the preindustrial base line level to which we compare
temperatures today is flawed. The authors say current warming is half a
degree Celsius higher than the most common estimates.<br/><br/>Not
everyone agrees. Some critics say data from a single location should not
upend global temperature assessments. Others slam the authors for
confusing the public. “It is the date of the reference period that
matters rather than whether it is labelled pre-industrial or not,”

<li>EU reportedly backs down on farming emissions cuts
</h3>
<p>
Farmers across the European Union have been protesting for weeks against
a plan to curb greenhouse gas emissions from the agricultural sector,
and it looks like their efforts paid off: A new plan for cutting the
bloc’s emissions by 90% by 2040, set to be unveiled today, nixes the
call for a 30% reduction in gases like methane and nitrogen, which are
linked to farming, the <em>Financial Times

The conflict stems from farmers’ concerns that policymakers are ignoring
them, and with European Parliament elections just a few months away,
center-right politicians are trying to win over every vote they can. But
there will be consequences: The agricultural sector is projected to be
“the biggest emitter by 2040 unless the EU takes action,”

new green policies without losing support from key demographics.

with some help from the U.S. government. However, Save the Children says
one-third of those displaced by the disaster are still homeless.

<p>It’s been an exceedingly weird 24 hours. Last night the Senate
released the text of the national security supplemental bill on which a
bipartisan team of negotiators has been working for four months.
Negotiators were working on adding a border component to an urgent
measure to fund aid to Ukraine, Israel, and Gaza, since extremist House
Republicans said they would not pass such a measure until Congress also
addressed what they insisted was a crisis at the U.S. border.</p>

<h2 id="coraquest">CoraQuest</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-06, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>

</iframe>
<p>
<a href="https://www.coraquest.com/">CoraQuest</a> is a “family
cooperative dungeon crawler” created by adorable dad-daughter duo Dan
and Cora Hughes from Huddersfield, UK. Feeling the boredom of pandemic
lockdown, Dan and Cora (8yo) decided to design a board game and
<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cabbagedan/coraquest/description">put
it on Kickstarter</a>. I’ve wanted an easy “Dungeons and Dragons for
Kids” game for a long time and this hits all the marks. It’s
imaginative, tactile, visual, and it has
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzLi8IWmLKU">a simple
ruleset</a> that kids can easily grok. I backed it the minute I saw it.
</p>
<p>
CoraQuest comes with ~9 or so premade adventures so parents can run a
one-shot without much preparation. The dungeon is a stack of 9x9 tiles
with special story cards mixed in that map to story beats in the premade
adventure. I embellish a bit and give the bad guys names like “Gerald”
and “Geoffrey”. Add some funny voices and it’s a guaranteed good time
for kids. My son and his friends played for two hours the other day and
the kids didn’t even think about devices. That is worth the price of
admission alone.
</p>
<p>
There’s other aspects that make this game great like how you can upload
drawings to <a href="https://www.coraquest.com/cc/creator.html">design
your own heroes and enemies</a>, there’s
<a href="https://www.coraquest.com/hoodez-hidden-door/">narrated
quests</a> to offload that responsibility, but to me the best part is my
kids love it and ask for it. The infectious laughter of Dan and Cora has
infected our house and young Cora is a role model that I often point to
and tell my kids they can make a cool game everyone loves if you set
your mind to it. I love the game so much I’ve
<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cabbagedan/coraquest-keep-on-questing-expansion/description">bought
the expansion</a> as well as a
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CK9WNG57">short story book</a> that
takes place in the CoraQuest fantasy universe.
</p>
<p>
If you’re looking for a game to play with your kids and their friends, I
highly recommend CoraQuest.

id="isr-roundtable-2023-the-future-of-preserving-the-integrity-of-the-scholarly-record-together">ISR
Roundtable 2023: The future of preserving the integrity of the scholarly
record together</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-06, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<p>
Metadata about research objects and the relationships between them form
the basis of the scholarly record: rich metadata has the potential to
provide a richer context for scholarly output, and in particular, can
provide trust signals to indicate integrity. Information on who authored
a research work, who funded it, which other research works it cites, and
whether it was updated, can act as signals of trustworthiness. Crossref
provides foundational infrastructure to connect and preserve these
records, but the creation of these records is an ongoing and complex
community effort. Crossref has always shown a deep commitment to
preserving the integrity of the scholarly record in an open and scalable
manner.
</p>
<p>
Given the increasing concerns in the community about matters of research
integrity and integrity of the scholarly record (ISR), we at Crossref
have been engaging with community members to understand what
developments are needed. In 2022, we organised
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/isr-part-four-working-together-as-a-community-to-preserve-the-integrity-of-the-scholarly-record/" target="_blank">a
roundtable discussion to talk about our role</a> and the applicability
of Crossref’s services in preserving and assessing the integrity of the
scholarly record. We’ve acted on much of that feedback since, and so in
October 2023, we organised a follow-up event, once more gathering
representatives of publishers, research integrity experts,
policy-makers, academic institutions, funders, and researchers (the full
list of participants can be found in the appendix). This post aims to
offer insight into the discussions at this event and the next steps. The
objective of this event was to take the conversation forward by:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Sharing the progress made by Crossref on matters related to ISR since
the last roundtable event.
</li>
<li>
Sharing information about how metadata contributes to the Research
Nexus, and can act as trust markers for research outputs.
</li>
<li>
Apprising the community about the latest membership trends and examples
of activities that we see, such as title transfer disputes, unregistered
DOIs, requests for deleting records, and
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02192" target="_blank">sneaked
references</a> .
</li>
<li>
Building upon the ideas discussed during the 2022 roundtable event to
progress the conversation about issues related to ISR.
</li>
<li>
Learning from the participants about their experiences of pursuing
research integrity initiatives.
</li>
<li>
Last but no less importantly, hearing from the participants their
perspectives on strategies for preserving the integrity of the scholarly
record, and opportunities for collaborating to leverage metadata to
assess the integrity of the scholarly record.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The event was kicked off by Ed Pentz, who spoke to the participants
about how integrity is key to Crossref’s mission, and Crossref’s vision
of the
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/research-nexus/" target="_blank">Research
Nexus</a>. Next, Amanda Bartell, the Head of Member Experience at
Crossref, shared the recent developments and trends in community
behaviour. She expanded upon the actions taken by Crossref as part of
its ISR program since the last roundtable event, which include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/news-crossref-and-retraction-watch/" target="_blank">Acquisition
and opening of the Retraction Watch database</a>, which makes it easier
to access information on retractions and corrections.
</li>
<li>
Increased participation in the Global Equitable Membership (GEM)
program, enabling a wider section of the community to provide and access
trust signals.
</li>
<li>
Newer developments around metadata that act as trust signals: e.g. 120K
grants or awards now have a Crossref DOI, and the
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/open-funder-registry-to-transition-into-research-organization-registry-ror/" target="_blank">planned
transition of the Open Funder Registry into ROR</a>.
</li>
<li>
Recruitment of a Community Manager to focus on working with publishers
and editors, including on ISR
(<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/perspectives-madhura-amdekar-meeting-community-pursuing-research-integrity/" target="_blank">that’s
me!</a>), and recruitment of
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/perspectives-luis-montilla-sci-fi-concepts-reality-scholarly-ecosystem/" target="_blank">a
Technical Community Manager</a> to enable greater use of our APIs.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Amanda highlighted that all Crossref members should be using ROR IDs to
provide affiliations for authors (along with ORCID iDs) in their
Crossref metadata. She also shared some latest examples of community
behaviours that we have seen, such as requests from authors to delete
records of works that were published without their permission, title
ownership disputes between publishers, and the recent instance of
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02192" target="_blank">sneaked
references</a>.
</p>
<p>
Ivan Oransky, co-founder of Retraction Watch, and Lena Stoll, Product
Manager at Crossref, were next, and they spoke about the future of the
Retraction Watch database, and about the
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/services/crossmark/" target="_blank">Crossmark
service</a>. After this, some of the other roundtable participants
shared initiatives that they have undertaken that support ISR:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Jodi Schneider from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign spoke
about
<a href="https://www.niso.org/standards-committees/crec" target="_blank">NISO’s
CREC Working Group</a> that has created a Recommended Practice that
should be followed by relevant stakeholders for communicating retracted
research (Crossref’s Director of Product Rachael Lammey was the co-chair
of that group).
</li>
<li>
Kihong Kim from the Korean Council of Science Editors shared information
about the workshops that the Council has organised for researchers on
publishing in journals.
</li>
<li>
Alberto Martín-Martín from Universidad de Granada presented his thoughts
on how to reconcile the publishing system and the institutional view of
tracking research outputs.
</li>
<li>
Bianca Kramer from Sesame Science spoke about her analysis of and the
implications of sneaked references, duplicate references, and missing
references for citation integrity.
</li>
<li>
Joris van Rossum from STM Solutions spoke about the STM Integrity Hub
and the integrity tools that are being developed in collaboration with
some publishers.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Some of the most valuable reflections stemmed from discussions in small
groups on these three key questions:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
What value do you see in the integrity and completeness of the scholarly
record in the way you operate? How do you contribute to it? How can it
support you to achieve your own goals?
</li>
<li>
Are you aware of Crossref services? What are the barriers to more
uptake? What are the challenges and opportunities?
</li>
<li>
What information is essential and nice to have for you in the scholarly
records to support trust signalling and ascertaining trustworthiness?
</li>
</ol>
<p>
As groups shared their discussions, a few themes became apparent that I
would like to elaborate on further.
</p>
<h2 id="what-is-complete">
What is “complete”?
</h2>
<p>
Given the prompt to talk about the value of completeness of the
scholarly record, an immediate reaction at most tables was: how much
metadata qualifies as “complete” metadata? Can the scholarly record be
considered complete if some publishers or journals do not use Crossref?
What is the optimum level of metadata that should be deposited by
members - should a minimum data standard be defined by disciplines, or
should there be standard data requirements for all? The composition of
metadata appears to change over time, too, as the processes change and
our ability to record their facets increases. While there were spirited
discussions about what constitutes a complete scholarly record, everyone
agreed that “completeness” of metadata, as much as is possible, should
be the aim. Unambiguous and consistent standards may help with this, for
example, the Metadata 20/20 community creation of
<a href="https://metadata2020.org/resources/metadata-principles/" target="_blank">principles</a>
and
<a href="https://metadata2020.org/resources/metadata-practices/" target="_blank">best
practices</a>, and potentially also using
<a href="https://www.niso.org/press-releases/2021/01/nisos-recommended-practice-reproducibility-badging-and-definitions-now" target="_blank">a
set of recognition standards and reproducibility badges</a>.
</p>
<p>
Global participation is equally important for a truly “complete”
scholarly record. In order to enable as many in the scholarly community
as possible to participate in Crossref services and metadata, Crossref
launched the
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/gem/" target="_blank">Global Equitable
Membership (GEM)</a> program in 2023. Under this initiative, membership
and content registration fees are waived off for members from the least
economically advantaged countries. We are seeing first signs that
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/the-gem-program-year-one/" target="_blank">this
initiative meaningfully lowers the barriers to participation</a> for
organisations based in those countries, and allows the global community
to contribute towards the building of a comprehensive research
ecosystem.
</p>
<p>
At the end of the day, it is important to recognize that rich metadata
is crucial because it can be used for all kinds of analysis, which in
turn can drive decision-making. Even if some of the metadata components
are sporadically missing, that could be acceptable, because every piece
of data counts!
</p>
<h2 id="corrections-and-retractions">
Corrections and Retractions
</h2>
<p>
Similar to last year, retractions and corrections continued to be a
topic of great interest in this year’s roundtable. This was not
surprising given their relevance as trust indicators as well as the
recent development with the acquisition of the Retraction Watch database
by Crossref. Having heard from Ivan about the Retraction Watch
<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/retraction-watch-database-user-guide/retraction-watch-database-user-guide-appendix-b-reasons/" target="_blank">taxonomy
of reasons for retractions</a> and the metadata included in the
database, participants expressed the need to investigate this taxonomy
as a community standard. While the Retraction Watch taxonomy is not
widely known, we at Crossref are working to map the Crossmark taxonomy
with the Retraction Watch taxonomy, which will enable complete
integration of the Retraction Watch database with the Crossref database.
</p>
<p>
It would also be useful to add more information to retraction notices.
Having more information about the reasons for retraction will not only
destigmatize retractions, but certain additional information, such as
submission dates for those outputs, might help with ethical
investigations to determine whether manuscripts were being submitted to
multiple publishers simultaneously.
</p>
<p>
On the topic of retractions, another aspect that came up in the room was
about incentives for researchers to publish as much and as quickly as
possible. If researchers indulge in unethical publishing practices due
to this pressure to publish, that is hugely detrimental to the cause of
research integrity and to the progress of scientific research in
general. However, there is a distinction to be made between the
integrity of the research and the integrity of the scholarly record -
unethical research and publishing practices, including but not limited
to data falsification, fabrication, and plagiarism, affect research
integrity while integrity of the scholarly record is affected by
unavailability of metadata, outdated metadata, incomplete metadata
records, and incorrect metadata (e.g. as seen in the case of
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02192" target="_blank">sneaked
references</a>).
</p>
<p>
There was a lot of discussion about
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/services/crossmark/" target="_blank">Crossmark</a>,
a cross-platform service provided by Crossref that allows readers to
discover whether an item has been updated, corrected, or retracted just
by clicking a button that is standardised across publication platforms.
While most participants acknowledged its importance, they also pointed
out that its uptake has been limited and publishers do not use it as
much, perhaps because it is difficult to implement and there’s a matter
of providing more clarity about it to the readers. There were
suggestions to add a notification system to Crossmark such that every
time a published output is retracted, a notification goes out. This
seemed of particular interest to funders, whose grievance was that they
are usually the last to find out when research that they have funded is
retracted. They would welcome notifications that would alert them to
such events.
</p>
<p>
We already have plans to consult with the community more specifically
about what changes they’d like to see to Crossmark that will enable them
to implement it easily and use it more frequently. Take a look
<a href="https://community.crossref.org/t/communicating-post-publication-updates-inviting-feedback-on-the-next-steps-for-crossmark/4744" target="_blank">at
this thread on our community forum and add your thoughts for our next
steps on Crossmark</a>.
</p>
<h2 id="the-importance-of-education">
The importance of education
</h2>
<p>
There was an overwhelming sentiment that there was a need for collective
arbitration of research integrity issues. However, everyone recognized
that this is not a role for Crossref. We can act as a “trust broker” by
bridging different metadata and identifiers that otherwise might not
interact, creating a network of research outputs whose credibility can
be verified by others. Many participants called for Crossref to increase
its efforts in educating community members about the importance of
metadata and how different pieces can be linked together to make
meaningful connections.
</p>
<p>
Research practices vary between countries, and between institutions.
Correspondingly, the metadata being provided by diverse Crossref members
may also vary. There is an opportunity here for the global research
community to work together to increase awareness about ethical
standards, so that a lack of specific metadata or its variances
(e.g. unusually formatted metadata, or non-standard metadata fields) may
not be construed as “lower quality” metadata. Many felt that the
greatest need for education about metadata is for the academic community
– although individual researchers contribute a wealth of metadata
associated with any published research output, they do not necessarily
understand how metadata contributes to the completeness of the scholarly
record. There is a further opportunity to talk to the academic community
about how different metadata components link together to form a rich
network, supporting visibility and confidence in their work. A greater
awareness about these topics is likely to encourage researchers to
provide more metadata and identifiers.
</p>
<p>
While most participants at the roundtable event agreed about the need
for this conversation and the educational opportunities here, if
Crossref were to lead these efforts, it would represent, in some eyes, a
diversion from its mission. We do have several initiatives already to
support our communities. As part of the
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/community/ambassadors/" target="_blank">Crossref
Ambassadors program</a>, volunteers from the international scholarly
community who believe in Crossref’s mission liaise with our team to
conduct training in their communities about using Crossref services and,
generally, about the importance of metadata. In 2023, we also launched a
new online public forum,
<a href="https://theplace.discourse.group/" target="_blank">the
PLACE</a>, in collaboration with the Committee on Publication Ethics
(COPE), the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ), and the Open
Access Scholarly Publishers Association (OASPA). This forum is a place
where new publishers can connect with these organisations and learn
about best practices in scholarly publishing via discussion posts and by
asking questions, as they get started. Another initiative that is
designed to help new Crossref members is the “Managed Member Journey”:
as members join and move through the various stages of membership, key
information is shared with them during each of these stages in the form
of triggered automated emails, web pages, and webinars.
</p>
<p>
While Crossref’s direct interactions with researchers are limited, we
welcome the community’s recognition of the need to raise awareness about
these matters. We have started engaging more closely with the reporters
of metadata issues, in many cases investigators and ‘sleuths’ in the
area of research integrity, and plan some closer collaborations with
this group in 2024. We are open to supporting community efforts to
inform other stakeholders about the importance and uses of metadata.
</p>
<h2 id="incentives-for-the-community">
Incentives for the community
</h2>
<p>
Another theme that was heard repeatedly was “incentives”: incentives for
researchers to contribute to a “complete” scholarly record, incentives
for publishers to improve metadata, and incentives for everyone to
report on and register retractions.
</p>
<p>
As I mentioned before, a shared sentiment is that researchers may not be
aware of the value of rich metadata. While more publications, increased
citations, and greater grant funding are some examples of incentives
that are part of the current academic settings, the right incentives
probably do not exist for researchers to provide complete metadata. With
the diverse set of participants present at this meeting, some groups
also discussed how the current research assessment system can change to
incorporate other metrics, perhaps those based on open science and open
data.
</p>
<p>
What could be the incentives for publishers to improve the metadata
collected and deposited by them? One suggestion was that clearly defined
benefits of rich metadata can incentivise publishers. Being aware of
what funders are mandating, can be another incentive. On the same note,
funders will benefit from knowing what metadata is being provided by
publishers. This metadata is available through our open API, and nine
key checks on members’ activity are available through our public
<a href="https://crossref.org/members/prep/" target="_blank">Participation
Reports</a>.
</p>
<p>
Retractions featured again in the discussion on the topic of incentives.
As shared by Ivan, retractions are on the rise every year, with about
43k retractions currently in the Retraction Watch database. On the other
hand, retractions registered in Crossmark at the time of the meeting
numbered just 14k and have recently jumped up to 25k thanks to
Hindawi/Wiley’s dedication to good open metadata. Besides the fact that
the uptake of Crossmark by Crossref members is limited, another reason
for the low number of retractions being registered is the associated
stigma. Corrections and errata are usually conflated with retractions,
and all these terms, which represent different kinds of updates that may
happen to a published item, have a stigma associated with them in the
academic community. There is a need to destigmatize retractions, and
perhaps incentivize them by noting that these updates are essential to
uphold the integrity of the scholarly record and to highlight the
publishers that are showing leadership in addressing the issues openly
through up-to-date Crossref metadata.
</p>
<h2 id="what-metadata-is-nice-to-have-in-the-scholarly-record">
What metadata is nice to have in the scholarly record?
</h2>
<p>
We asked everyone what information they think is essential as well as
“nice to have” in the scholarly record to support trust signalling, and
we heard a range of answers. Peer review information was recognized to
be important. This would include data on who the peer reviewers were and
<a href="https://www.niso.org/standards-committees/peer-review-terminology" target="_blank">standard
peer review terminology that has been published by NISO</a>. More
generally, as much metadata as possible about the main actors of the
peer review process was considered important - such as designating who
the corresponding author is, and who the handling editor or the
decision-making editor was.
</p>
<p>
As special issues led by guest editors in journals have been brought to
the attention of late due to the uncovering of irregularities in some of
them, one of the first suggestions in this context was more metadata
about special issues. Participants thought that it would be useful to
collect and distribute information on handling/guest editors of special
issues, peer reviewers, as well as submission and acceptance dates.
Recently, COPE has released guidance on
<a href="https://publicationethics.org/node/56239" target="_blank">“best
practices for guest-edited collections”</a> , highlighting that this
topic looms at the forefront for the scholarly information industry.
</p>
<p>
Adding information on ethical approvals provided by institutional review
boards would add more nuance to the research outputs. Metadata about
clinical trials helps to add transparency to research in a field, where
reproducibility is of primary importance. Conflicts of interest are
another factor that could be a cause of concern if not reported
accurately; these declarations were mentioned by the participants as
important for signalling trust.
</p>
<p>
Recognizing that it is the relationships in the metadata that add
context to research output, participants echoed that better interlinking
between preprints and their published versions is required. To aid with
all of this, it has been suggested that a complete list of all metadata
that can be deposited with Crossref be made available in a simple
format, so that members have more visibility about all the possibilities
that exist for providing metadata.
</p>
<h2 id="next-steps">
Next steps
</h2>
<p>
We asked all participants if the discussions prompted them to plan to
take any actions in the near future. Several attendees reflected that
the discussion encouraged them to go back and review the metadata that
they are depositing with Crossref, and how they can make more use of the
data openly available from Crossref. We also heard how some found
training opportunities therein - discussion points from the event could
be included in workshops for affiliated researchers, and in COPE
guidance for members. As encouraged by members of the
<a href="https://www.niso.org/standards-committees/crec" target="_blank">NISO’s
CREC Working Group</a>, some participants were looking to respond in the
(then open) consultations of the
<a href="https://groups.niso.org/higherlogic/ws/public/download/29165/RP-45-202X_NISO_Communication_of_Retractions_Removals_and_Expressions_of_Concern_CREC_draft_for_public_comment.pdf" target="_blank">draft
Recommended Practice, NISO RP-45-202X, Communication of Retractions,
Removals, and Expressions of Concern (CREC)</a>. One message resonated
loud and clear: preserving the integrity of the scholarly record cannot
be a lone endeavour and has to be a community effort. Attendees
expressed their commitment to continue these conversations, with the
next most opportune time being at the
<a href="https://www.stm-assoc.org/events/stm-week-2023/" target="_blank">STM
week</a>. Everyone recognised that collaboration in this space is the
need of the hour: facilitating information and data sharing across all
the players in the ecosystem would be crucial to progressing this topic.
As Bianca Kramer declared during her presentation, “I am committed to
using only open data in my research, as access to data is important for
the community to detect problems at scale”.
</p>
<p>
At our end, we are looking to act on suggestions that are specific to
Crossref:
</p>
<h3 id="consultation-with-the-community-about-crossmark">
Consultation with the community about Crossmark
</h3>
<p>
One of the first things that we are doing in early 2024 is to consult
with our community about the developments needed in the Crossmark
service. Our key aim with this exercise would be to understand how we
can enable a more effective uptake of this service so that Crossref
members can easily fulfil their obligation of keeping their records
updated. We are keen to understand what we can do to help our members to
send us metadata about updates to an output, and how we can help
downstream services that use this data. Insights from this consultation
will also help inform how the Retraction Watch data can be most
effectively integrated into Crossmark and communicated to users. Please
visit the discussion and add your thoughts here:
<a href="https://community.crossref.org/t/communicating-post-publication-updates-inviting-feedback-on-the-next-steps-for-crossmark/" target="_blank">https://community.crossref.org/t/communicating-post-publication-updates-inviting-feedback-on-the-next-steps-for-crossmark/</a>.
</p>
<h3 id="development-of-resources-for-using-our-api">
Development of resources for using our API
</h3>
<p>
As there is clearly no dearth of metadata components that the community
thinks would be “nice to have” for signalling trust, it is equally
important to equip users and downstream service providers to be able to
access the rich metadata that is available with Crossref. This rich
metadata opens up new avenues for the development of services and
resources that can benefit the scholarly community. On account of this,
we plan to prioritise development of resources for using Crossref APIs.
These efforts would include making available workbooks with a variety of
API use cases - ranging from how to use basic API queries, to how to use
APIs for obtaining grant information or for obtaining citation data and
so on, as well as retrieving corrections, retractions, and update
information, especially when the Retraction Watch dataset merges in with
the rest of the Crossref metadata.
</p>
<h3 id="working-group-to-facilitate-community-efforts-for-preserving-isr">
Working group to facilitate community efforts for preserving ISR
</h3>
<p>
We are looking to set up a working group that will facilitate the
various stakeholders in the scholarly ecosystem to work together towards
preserving the integrity of the scholarly record. One direction for the
group could be to consider the role and impact of Crossref metadata in
ISR. Another area of focus will be to enrich information about
retractions, corrections, and expressions of concern. Raising
industry-wide awareness about the current concerns in upholding the
integrity of the scholarly record, and how comprehensive metadata can
act as markers of trust about research output, would be another focal
point.
</p>
<h3 id="continued-community-outreach">
Continued community outreach
</h3>
<p>
We will continue our efforts to engage with the community on the very
important issues surrounding ISR. We are particularly keen to redouble
our efforts to include more funders and institutions in these
conversations. Preserving the integrity of the scholarly record needs to
be a truly inclusive effort and will benefit from diverse voices in the
community. With that in mind, consulting with the community in Asia is
next on our radar.
</p>
<p>
We look forward to working with the community further on this important
topic - if you are keen to participate in these discussions and want to
contribute towards preserving the integrity of the scholarly record, we
would love to hear from you. Please write to us at
<a href="mailto:feedback@crossref.org">feedback@crossref.org</a> if you
have any suggestions on this topic.

<p>In the January 16th issue, the <em>Tech</em> reported on a
