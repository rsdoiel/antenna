Apart from getting started in the midst of one of Silicon Valley's regular downturns, another great thing about the beginnings of Nvidia was that instead of insisting on the "minimum viable product" our VCs, Sutter Hill and Sequoia, gave us the time to develop a real architecture for a family of chips. It enabled us to get an amazing amount of functionality into a half-micron gate array; <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/12/hardware-io-virtualization.html">I/O virtualization</a>, a DMA engine, a graphics processor that rendered curved surfaces directly, not by approximating them with triangles, a sound engine and support for game controllers.  As I write, after a three decade-long history of bringing innovations to the market, Nvidia is <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c43661bb-a087-4a54-a4b4-a6549d9156c3">America's third most valuable company</a>.  <br />
<br />
I've written <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/search/label/venture%20capital">several times</a> about how in pursuit of a quicker buck, VCs have largely discarded the slow process of building an IPO-ready company like Nvidia in favor of building one that will be acquired by one of the dominant monopolists.  These VCs don't support innovation. Even if their acquisition-bound companies do innovate in their short lives, their innovations are rarely tested in the market after the acuisition.<br />
<br />
Below the fold I discuss a new paper that presents a highly detailed look at the mechanisms the dominant companies use to neutralize the threats startups could pose to their dominance.<br />
<span><a name='more'></a></span>
<br />
In <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4713845"><i>Coopting Disruption</i></a> law professors Mark Lemley (Stanford) and Matthew Wansley (Cardozo) ask a good question:<br />
<blockquote>
Our economy is dominated by five aging tech giants—Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft. Each of these firms was founded more than twenty years ago: Apple and Microsoft in the 1970s, Google and Amazon in the 1990s, and Facebook in 2004. Each of them grew by successfully commercializing a disruptive technology—personal computers (Apple), operating systems (Microsoft), online shopping (Amazon), search engines (Google), and social networks (Facebook). Each of them displaced the incumbents that came before them. But in the last twenty years, no company has commercialized a new technology in a way that threatens the tech giants. Why?
</blockquote>
The TL;DR of Lemley and Wansley's answer to their question <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4713845">is</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
While there are many reasons for the tech giants’ continued dominance, we think an important and overlooked one is that they have learned how to coopt disruption. They identify potentially disruptive technologies, use their money to influence the startups developing them, strategically dole out access to the resources the startups need to grow, and seek regulation that will make it harder for the startups to compete. When a threat emerges, they buy it off.  And after they acquire a startup, they redirect its people and assets to their own innovation needs.
</blockquote>
<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4713845">They observe that</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
a company that is started with the goal of being swallowed by a tech giant probably isn’t contributing much to society.
</blockquote>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
They start by identifying the advantages and disadvantages the incumbents possess in their efforts to monetize innovations. Their list of advantages is:<br />
<ul>
<li>"large incumbents can take advantage of economies of scale" not just in manufacturing, but also in marketing an distribution by exploiting their existing customer relationships.</li>
<li>"Large incumbents can also take advantage of economies of scope. Innovation creates “involuntary spillovers”—new knowledge that has economic value beyond the specific product that the firm was developing."</li>
<li>"large incumbents can access capital at a lower cost" for example from retained earnings from their cash cows.</li>
<li>"large incumbents may have another potential advantage—a longer investment time horizon" even more so now with the compression of VC time horizons.</li>
</ul>
Their list of incumbents disadvantages in innovation is more interesting:<br />
<ol>
<li>"their success will cannibalize their own market share" or "More generally, a monopolist has diminished incentives to introduce new products, improve product quality, or lower prices because any new sales generated replace its existing sales." Economists call this "Arrow's replacement effect"; more specifically: "The general lesson is, all else equal, the larger a firm’s market share and the less it is threatened by competition, the weaker its incentives to innovate. So we should expect large incumbents to not innovate much. And if they can dispense with the competitors rather than have to compete with them, they will do that."</li>
<li>"their managers prefer to deliver incremental innovations to their existing customers". Unlike Arrow's theory, "Christensen’s theory of disruptive innovation, ... focuses on the career incentives of middle managers ... Incumbent managers have an incentive to deliver sustaining innovations—incremental improvements in quality to the firm’s existing products that will please its existing customers. But they have substantial disincentives to pursue projects that upset the apple cart, even if doing so would bring new customers to the firm" The fundamental problem is that "Housing an innovation project inside a firm with diverse lines of business creates conflict with those other businesses. Some firm assets—cash, cloud computing, equipment, facilities, and engineers’ time—are rivalrous and finite, so executives must be willing to fight internal constituencies to devote those resources to innovation." Ingenuity, NASA's wildly successful Mars helicopter is a good example, as Eric Berger reports in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/02/before-ingenuity-ever-landed-on-mars-scientists-almost-managed-to-kill-it/"><i>Before Ingenuity ever landed on Mars, scientists almost managed to kill it</i></a>. It was competing for cost, weight and risk with Perseverance's primary mission.</li>
<li>"their single veto point decision-making structure encourages risk-aversion" More specifically: "Inside a large incumbent, decisions about whether to fund an innovative project must pass through one veto point. In the venture capital market, many competing investors independently decide whether to finance an innovative idea. Inside a firm, an employee with an innovative idea must pitch an idea to managers who ultimately report to one executive gate-keeper. In the venture capital market, if a would-be startup founder pitches an idea to ten VC firms, and nine of them are not persuaded, the idea gets funded." The advantage of market-based finance over internal finance applies not just to the initiation but also the continuation of an innovation project. Inside a firm, an executive who has soured on a project can terminate it. In the venture capital market, when a startup’s initial investors grow skeptical, the company can still pitch outsiders on infusing more cash." The authors make this important point (my emphasis): "And while economists often describe markets as efficient, there is no reason to believe individual corporate executives make efficient (or even rational) decisions. Just ask Twitter. Markets work not because private executives make good decisions but because the ones who make bad decisions get driven out. But <b>that dynamic only works with competition</b>."</li>
<li>"they cannot appropriately compensate employees working on innovation projects." The reason they cannot is that: "Startups solve this problem by giving employees stock options. Every employee with significant equity knows that if the startup successfully exits, they will be rewarded. Stock in a large, diversified public company does not create similar incentives. The incentives are diluted because the value of the stock will be affected by too many variables unrelated to the success of the specific innovation project." And that: "large firms do not recognize internal “property rights” to innovations that employees develop. If they did, employees might become reluctant to share information. But not protecting internal property rights gives innovative employees incentive to leave. If employees at a large firm found their own startup and raise venture capital to fund it, they will earn a much greater share of the profits of the innovation."</li>
</ol>
The authors go on to describe five techniques incumbents use to neutralize the threat of disruption that innovative startups might pose; network effects, self-preferencing, paying for defaults, cloning, and coopting the disruptor. They claim other have described the first four, but they don't amount to an  adequate explanation for why the tech giants haven't been disrupted. I will summarize each of the four in turn..
<h3>Network effects</h3>
Nearly  three decades ago W. Brian Arthur, in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Increasing-Returns-Dependence-Economics-Cognition/dp/0472064967"><i>Increasing Returns and Path Dependence in the Economy</i></a> explained how increasing returns to scale, or network effects, of technology markets typically led to them being dominated by one player. Consider a new market opened up by a technologcal development. Several startups enter, for random reasons one gets bigger then the others, network effects amplify its advantage in a feedback loop.<br />
<br />
This effect is more important now, as the the giants' business models have evolved to become <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4713845">platforms</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The tech giants’ core businesses are built on platforms. A platform is an intermediary in a two-sided market. It connects users on one side of the market with users on the other side for transactions or interactions.<br />
...<br />
Platforms tend to exhibit network effects—the addition of a new user increases the value of a platform to existing users and attracts new users.
</blockquote>
This is precisely the mechanism Brian Arthur described, but applied to a business model that has since been enabled by the Internet.<br />
<h3>Self-preferencing</h3>
Self-preferencing happens when a platform isn't just a two-sided market, but one in which the platform itself is <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4713845">a vendor</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Amazon, for example, both invites third party vendors to sell their products in its online marketplace and sells its own house brands that compete with those vendors.  Amazon has a powerful advantage in that competition. It has access to data on all of its competitors—who their customers are, which products are selling well, and which prices work best. And it controls which ads consumers see when they search for a specific product. Assuming Amazon uses that information to prefer its own products to those of its competitors (either by pricing strategically or by promoting its own products in search results) – something alleged but not yet proven in a pending antitrust case -- the result is to bias competition. Vendors cannot realistically protest Amazon’s self-preferencing (or just go elsewhere) because Amazon has such a dominant share in the online retail market.
</blockquote>
<h3>Paying for defaults</h3>
The value of the default position is notorious <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4713845">because</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Alphabet pays Apple a reported $18 billion (with a b) each year for Google to be the default search engine on iOS devices. Android and iOS together account for 99% of the U.S. mobile operating system market. Consequently, almost everyone who uses a smartphone in America is accustomed to Google search. Alphabet claims that “competition is just a click away.” But research and experience have shown that defaults can be somewhat sticky. So controlling the default position can give Alphabet (or whoever wins the Apple bid) an advantage. That said, someone has to be the default, and it might be better for consumers if the default is the search engine most users already prefer. The real problem might be the idea of paying for placement, whoever wins the bidding war.
</blockquote>
<h3>Cloning</h3>
There are many examples of a tech giant tryng to neutralize the threat from a startup by using the threat of cloning their product to force the startup to sell itself, or of actually cloning the product and using their market power to swamp the startup. Meta's addition of Reels to Instagram in response to Tik Tok is an obvious example. But the authors make two good points: <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4713845">First</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Cloning is only objectionable if the tech giant wins out not by competition on the merits, but by exclusionary conduct.
</blockquote>
Second, that cloning <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4713845">often fails</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Google+, Google’s effort to build a social media service that combined the best of Facebook and Twitter was an abject failure. Apple’s effort to control the music world’s move to streaming by offering its own alternative to Spotify hasn’t prevented Spotify from dominating music streaming and eclipsing the once-vibrant (and Apple-dominated) market for music downloads. Meta’s effort to copy Snap, then TikTok, by introducing Stories and Reels has not proven terribly successful, and certainly has not prevented those companies from building their markets.
</blockquote>
The fact that the giants can clone a startup's product leads the authors to <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4713845">ask</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
If the product is cloneable, then why would you buy the company and burn cash paying off its VCs?
</blockquote>
There are two possible answers. It may be faster and easier, though likely not cheaper, to "acquihire" the startup's talent than to recruit equivalent talent in the open market. Or it may be faster and easier, though likely not cheaper, to acquire the company and its product rather than cloning it.
<h3>Inadequate Explanation</h3>
The authors use the example of <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4713845">Microsoft</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Microsoft enjoyed strong network effects in the 1990s as the dominant maker of operating system software – far more dominant than it is today. It cloned internet browser technology from upstarts like Netscape, and it engaged in anticompetitive conduct designed to ensure that it, not Netscape, became the browser of choice.82 But Microsoft’s victory over Netscape was short-lived. New startups – Mozilla and then Google – came out of nowhere and took the market away from it. Microsoft still benefits from network effects, and it still uses cloning and self-preferencing to send users to its Edge browser. But it doesn’t work. Microsoft employed all the tools of a dominant firm in a network market, but it still faced disruption.
</blockquote>
So these four techniques aren't an explanation for the recent dearth of disruption.<br />
<h3>Coopting disruption</h3>
The authors imagine themselves as a tech giant, asking what else they would do to prevent disruption, and coming up with <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4713845">four new techniques</a>:<br />
<ul>
<li>"First, you would learn as much as you can about which companies had the capability to develop disruptive innovations and try to steer them away from competing with you – perhaps by partnering with them, or perhaps by investing in them."</li>
<li>"Second, you would make sure that those companies could not access the critical resources they would need to transform their innovation into a disruptive product."</li>
<li>"Third, you would tell your government relations team to seek regulation that would build a competitive moat around your position and keep disruption out."</li>
<li>"Fourth, if one of the companies you were tracking nevertheless did start to develop a disruptive product, you would want extract that innovation—and choke off the potential competition—in an acquisition."</li>
</ul>
These are the techniques they call "coopting disruption", pointing out that the <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4713845">tech giants have</a>:<br />
<ul>
<li>"built a powerful reconnaissance network covering emerging competitive threats by investing in startups as corporate VCs and by cultivating relationships with financial VCs."</li>
<li>"accumulated massive quantities of data that are essential for many software and AI innovations, and they dole out access to this data and to their networks selectively."</li>
<li>"asked legislators to regulate the tech industry—in a way that will buttress incumbents."</li>
<li>"repeatedly bought potentially competitive startups in a way that has flown—until a few years ago—below the antitrust radar."</li>
</ul>
The authors detail many examples of each of these techniques, for example Facebook conditioning access to user data on the purchase of advertising, and Google's purchase of DoubleClick and YouTube. Interestingly, they contrast the recent purchasing of the tech giants with Cisco's famously successful purchases in the 90s:
<blockquote>
The Cisco story exemplifies how the venture capital market, as a market, is better at exploring a series of risky ideas than a firm with a single risk-averse gatekeeper. It also illustrates how the advantages of a large incumbent—in this case access to markets and existing customer relationships—can sometimes extract more market value out of a technology than a new entrant.
</blockquote>
The rapid evoluution of networking technology at the time meant that even Cisco, the largest company in the market, didn't have the R&amp;D resources to explore all the opportunities. They depended upon VCs to fund the initial explorations, rewarding them by paying over the odds for the successes. Their market power then got the successes deployed much faster than a startup could.<br />
<h3>Why Is Cooption Bad?</h3>
The authors explain the <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4713845">harms of cooption</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Our claim here is that the same dynamics that inhibit disruptive innovation by longstanding employees of large incumbents inhibit disruptive innovation by new employees from acquired startups.<br />
...<br />
The tech giants win from coopting disruption even though it destroys social value. In fact, they benefit in two ways. They make faster incremental progress on the sustaining innovations that they want. They get the new code, the valuable intellectual property, and the fresh ideas of the startup. And, critically, they also kill off a competitor. They no longer have to worry about the startup actually developing the more disruptive innovation and leapfrogging them or other tech giants acquiring the startup and using its assets to compete with them.
</blockquote>
And, by making the innovators from the startup rich, the acquirer greatly reduces their incentives for future innovation. <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/02/the-stanford-digital-library-project.html">Andy Bechtolsheim</a> is an outlier.<br />
<h3>Remedies?</h3>
Lemley and Wansley, who seem to think in fours, make a set of four proposals for how these harms might be reduced:<br />
<ul>
<li><b>Unlocking Directorates</b> &mdash; under the Clayton Act "interlocking officers and directors between companies that compete, even in part, are illegal <i>per se</i> – without any inquiry into whether the companies in fact restrained competition because of their overlapping interests or whether the conduct offered procompetitive benefits." Companies with less than $4.1M in revenue are exampt, which excludes most startups; this should be revised.</li>
<li><b>Limiting Leveraging of Data and Networks</b> &mdash; "we would impose on incumbent tech monopolists a presumptive duty of nondiscrimination in access where the defendant (1) provides or sells data or network access to at least some unaffiliated companies and (2) refuses to provide or sell the same data or network access to the plaintiff company on comparable terms, but (3) the plaintiff does not operate a competing network or otherwise compete with the defendant in the market from which it collected the relevant data."</li>
<li><b>Regulating Regulation</b> &mdash; "Done right, regulation of technology can be beneficial and even necessary to the development of that technology, minimizing the risk of harm to third parties and ensuring that the world views the technology as safe and trustworthy. But all too often regulation has become a way to insulate incumbents from competition, with predictable results." The authors' suggestions exemplify this difficulty, being rather vague and aspirational.</li>
<li><b>Blocking Cooptive Acquisitions</b> &mdash; this is the most complex of the four proposals, and builds on <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/45467503"><i>Nascent Competitors</i></a> by C. Scott Hemphill & Tim Wu, who write:<br />
<blockquote>
We favor an enforcement policy that prohibits anticompetitive conduct that is reasonably capable of contributing significantly to the maintenance of the incumbent s market power. That approach implies enforcement even where the competitive significance of the nascent competitor is uncertain.
</blockquote>
Justifying blocking mergers because of a nascent threat that might never materialize is problematic. But it is only more so than the current way anti-trust works, by projecting likely harm to consumer welfare, which also might never materialize (although it almost always does). Lemley and Wansley explain <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4713845">the dilemma</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
antitrust enforcers need a strategy for blocking cooptive acquisitions that works within existing case law (or plausible improvements to that law) and is surgical enough to avoid chilling investment.
</blockquote>
Some cases are <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4713845">obvious</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
For cooptive acquisitions like Facebook/Instagram deal, we think Hemphill and Wu’s strategy makes sense. Zuckerberg’s email arguing for acquiring startups like Instagram because “they could be very disruptive to us” is a smoking gun of anticompetitive intent.
</blockquote>
But Lemley and Wansley go further, arguing for blocking megers based the startup's ability to <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4713845">innovate distruptive technology</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Of course, an approach to policing startup acquisitions based on innovation capabilities need limits. Many startups have some innovation capabilities that could have a significant effect on competition. We can cabin enforcement in three ways&mdash;by focusing on specific technologies and specific firms and by looking at the cumulative effects of multiple acquisitions.
</blockquote>
Their examples of technologies include generative AI and virtual and augmented reality, both cases where it is already too late. The companies they identify "Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, and Meta" are all veterans of multiple acquisitions in these areas. But they argue that committing to
<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4713845">challenge fuure mergers</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
would create socially desirable incentives for startups. A startup developing one of the listed technologies would gain stronger incentives to turn its innovations into the products that its management team believed would garner the highest value on the open market—rather than the one most valuable to the tech giants. They would also gain stronger incentives to build a truly independent business and go public since an acquisition by the tech giants would be a less likely exit.
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
I think these would all be worthwhile steps, and I'm all in favor of updating anti-trust law and, even better, actually enforcing the laws on the books. But I am skeptical that the government can spot potentially disruptive technologies before the tech giants spot and acquire them. Especially since the government can't be embedded in the VC industry the way the tech giants are. Note that many of the harms Lemley and Wansley identify happen shortly after the acquisition. Would forcing Meta to divest Instagram at this late date restore the innovations the acquisition killed off?<br />

## About these regional bank-commercial real estate concerns…

date: 2024-02-22, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>Commercial real estate is a market that&#8217;s been sagging with lots of people still working from home. That&#8217;s been a source of consternation for regional banks with exposure to commercial real estate, like New York Community Bancorp, which Moody&#8217;s recently downgraded. But is all this anxiety actually overblown? We dig in. Plus, Japan&#8217;s stock market climbs out of a decadeslong slump, and the first online-only grocer will soon begin accepting SNAP benefits.</p>

## Twitter's big competitive advantage

date: 2024-02-22, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><i>I wrote this <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1760681139407360255">on Twitter</a> this morning. Re-posted here with minimal editing. The fact that I could write it on Twitter was the point.</i></p>
<p>Twitter has one advantage over all the other social webs. no character limit. </p>
<p>I started typing a post on Threads which has a large character limit compared to the others, but ran out of space and decided to write it over here in twitter instead. </p>
<p>yes they charge me $8 a month for it, but it's worth it. </p>
<p>we have to get used to the idea of paying for value, it's how we avoid the messes of the last 20 years. esp if we can make sure we retain copies of everything we write (guaranteed by using our own writing tools, btw) which is another requirement for the new blogosphere. </p>
<p>btw, i'm having a blast these days. it's like tinkerbell in peter pan. all the open web needed was people to believe it exists for it to come (back) into existence.</p>
<p>still diggin. </p>
<p>ps: i also like they have simple styling, but where are the freaking links, twitter. do I have to pay another $8 to get those??</p>
<p>pps: the worst character limit is bluesky, i can't write anything there. too bad, it's a really nice system otherwise.</p>
<p>ppps: it would be nice to give something like this a title so you don't have to read pgf after pgf to try to figure out where i'm going and if you're interested. so i gave it a title, using markdown syntax. maybe they could just support markdown. hmmm.</p>
<p>pppps: i asked chatgpt to draw an illustration. that light in the middle of the room is the open social web. it's a vision of self-reliance, empowerment and cooperation. I asked for the light to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell">tinkerbell</a>, but i guess they were concerned the image might belong to someone. creeping shitification. </p>

## British Judges to Rule on US Extradition of WikiLeaks’ Julian Assange

date: 2024-02-22, from: VOA News USA

London — British judges are set to rule whether Julian Assange, the founder of the whistleblowing website WikiLeaks, will be extradited to the United States after he launched a last-ditch legal bid this week to block the order, the latest chapter in a legal battle stretching back nearly 14 years.


U.S. prosecutors are seeking Assange’s extradition in relation to 18 federal charges relating to allegations of hacking and theft of classified material, after Wikileaks published a trove of stolen U.S. diplomatic cables and military documents in 2010 relating to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.


Reserved judgement


The two-day hearing at the High Court in London concluded Wednesday and the two senior judges hearing the case are expected to deliver a ruling in the coming days or weeks. “We will reserve our decision,” judge Victoria Sharp said. It is unclear when she and fellow judge Jeremy Johnson will issue their decision.


Julian Assange’s supporters staged demonstrations outside the London court and in cities across the world, with protestors marching on U.S. embassies to demand Assange’s release.


Assange was not present at the High Court due to his poor health, and he did not appear via video link.


Assange’s defense


His defense lawyers argued the extradition warrant was politically motivated and that Assange was simply doing his job as a journalist by publishing the stolen U.S. files, according to Simon Crowther, a legal adviser for the human rights group Amnesty International, which is campaigning for the extradition order to be blocked.


“Firstly, they pointed out this is something that journalists do all the time: you receive classified material as journalists from confidential sources and you publish it when it’s in the public interest, particularly when it covers issues such as war crimes, crimes against humanity, accusations of torture, extrajudicial execution,” Crowther said.


“So, Julian Assange’s lawyers were able to point to legal arguments and found legal precedent that showed that this is political action that journalists take. And as a result, they say it’s outside of the extradition treaty between the U.S. and the U.K.,” he added.


Crowther said the second argument the lawyers made is that Assange’s actions were protected under guarantees of freedom of expression.


Press freedom


Press freedom campaigners have called for the United States to drop the charges against Assange and for him to be released from the high-security Belmarsh prison in London. Rebecca Vincent, the director of campaigns at Reporters Without Borders, said Assange would not get a fair trial in the United States.


“The publication by WikiLeaks in 2010 of the leaked classified documents exposed information that was in the public interest and informed journalism around the world. The prosecutor and other US officials have stated that as a foreign national, Assange will not be afforded First Amendment protections. Combined with the fact that the Espionage Act has no public interest defense, that means he cannot get a fair trial,” Vincent told VOA in a statement.


US prosecutors


U.S. prosecutors insist that Assange would receive a fair trial. In past hearings, British judges have also ruled that Assange would receive fair treatment under the U.S. judicial system.


Clair Dobbin, one of the lawyers representing the U.S. government, argued that Assange had encouraged people to steal documents, and that the published material contained unredacted names of U.S. sources, putting their lives at risk. She told the court this week that Assange had published them “indiscriminately” without redactions, and alleged that his actions were “unprecedented” and did not constitute journalism.


Assange could not therefore be “treated as akin to an ordinary journalist or Wikileaks akin to an ordinary publisher,” she said.


WikiLeaks cables


In 2010, WikiLeaks published a trove of diplomatic cables relating to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq that had been stolen by the U.S. Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning. Assange said Manning’s leaks exposed abuses by the United States military, including potential war crimes.


Assange was first arrested in Britain in 2010 on unrelated allegations of rape and sexual assault in Sweden. He jumped bail and sought refuge inside the Ecuadorian Embassy, where he stayed for seven years.


Sweden later dropped the charges. However, Assange was evicted from the Ecuadorian embassy in 2019 and imprisoned for breaching bail.


The British government signed an extradition order to the United States in June 2022, after successive failed legal challenges by Assange.


'Life in danger'


Assange’s wife Stella has repeatedly claimed that the 52-year-old’s life is in danger if he is extradited to the U.S. “It's an attack on all journalists, all over the world. It's an attack on the truth and an attack on the public's right to know. Julian is a political prisoner, and his life is at risk,” she told reporters outside the High Court as the hearing began this week.


In previous legal challenges, Assange’s lawyers unsuccessfully sought to block the extradition on claims that the U.S. prison system would constitute a risk to his life, potentially causing him to commit suicide.


“If he was extradited to the U.S., Julian Assange could be held in solitary confinement – prolonged solitary confinement. And that constitutes a violation of the (convention on the) prohibition of torture,” Amnesty’s Simon Crowther told VOA.


U.S. authorities have disputed the notion that Assange would inevitably be held in solitary confinement.


Prison term


If he is found guilty in the U.S., Assange’s lawyers say he could face a prison sentence of up to 175 years, but a term of 30 to 40 years was more likely. U.S. prosecutors have said he would serve no more than 63 months.


The Australian parliament last week called for Assange, who holds Australian citizenship, to be allowed to return to his homeland in a motion supported by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.


If Assange wins his case at the British High Court, a full appeal hearing will be held. If his legal bid fails, the case could be taken to the European Court of Human Rights. However, Britain could seek to extradite Assange to the United States before European judges could rule on the case.

## Will SCOTUS Block a Major Air Pollution Rule?

date: 2024-02-22, from: Heatmap News

Supreme Court weighs challenge to EPA pollution rule</h3><p><strong></strong>The Supreme Court this week has been hearing arguments in what CNN <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=3f61ae5970&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">called</a> “the most significant environmental dispute at the high court this year,” and things aren’t looking good for the Environmental Protection Agency. Several states and energy companies want to block the EPA’s “good neighbor” plan, which seeks to impose strict emissions limits on industrial activities in 23 states in an effort to prevent pollution from drifting across state lines and forming dangerous smog. Challengers say the regulation is overreaching and want its implementation delayed. Yesterday the court’s conservative majority appeared skeptical of the EPA’s authority, citing the fact that lower court decisions have paused the regulation in 12 states.<br/><br/>Environmental groups worry a ruling against the EPA here could set a dangerous precedent. “The Supreme Court — if it were to block this rule — would effectively be saying to industry, ‘Look, any time you face costs from a regulation, come on up and take a shot. We might block that rule for you,’” Sam Sankar, senior vice president for programs at Earthjustice, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=86ca751348&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a><em> E&E News.</em></p><h3>2.

The company saw $4.4 billion in annual revenue, up 167% from 2022, but it still lost more money per vehicle ($43,000) in Q4 than in the two quarters prior. It also forecast no growth in vehicle production for 2024, and said it will cut 10% of its staff as EV sales growth slows. “We firmly believe in the full electrification of the automotive industry, but recognize in the short-term, the challenging macro-economic conditions,” CEO RJ Scaringe <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=f5d4f90667&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>. The company is expected to unveil its smaller, more affordable R2 electric SUV in two weeks. Scaringe has <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=ce56f4425b&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">called</a> the vehicle “Rivian’s version of the Tesla Model 3.”</p><h3>3.

The first dealer allocations of the Fiat 500e models sold out in less than a week. The car is lightweight, has a range of about 150 miles, and is one of the cheapest EVs in the U.S., starting at $32,500. Globally it has sold more than 185,000 units, but Stellantis seems to know Americans like big cars, and <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=7fb47ffcbb&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reportedly</a> plans to launch electric pickups, SUVs, and muscle cars.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

China’s climate targets in jeopardy as CO2 emissions rise</h3><p><strong></strong>China’s carbon emissions increased by 12% between 2020 and 2023, putting its 2025 climate goals in jeopardy, according to <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=a3a18e26c6&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">analysis</a> from <em>Carbon Brief</em>. One reason for the emissions uptick is that drought has reduced output from hydropower, forcing China to rely more on coal. “China has approved 218 GW of new coal power in just two years, enough to supply electricity to the whole of Brazil,” <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=e76d2319b4&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> <em>Reuters</em>. But at the same time, huge amounts of renewable energy are coming online. This presents a strange contradiction: Coal plants will see less use, which could spark outcry from all the new coal plant operators, and “potential pushback against the energy transition,” <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=3a17cd1695&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst for the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.

## NASA Center Boosted YF-12 Supersonic Engine Research

Supersonic flight became a reality in October 1947, when the Bell X-1 rocket plane broke the sound barrier. NASA’s Lewis Research Center in Cleveland (now, NASA Glenn), which had served as the agency’s aeropropulsion leader since it was established in the 1940s, subsequently helped NASA advance the technology needed to make longer supersonic flights possible.

## Good news on the emissions front

date: 2024-02-22, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>In a bright spot for news on the climate crisis, new data shows that U.S. carbon emissions dipped by 1.8% last year. Most of the reduction in emissions is coming from the power sector. We&#8217;ll explore what&#8217;s driving the shift and where progress still needs to be made. Plus, Nvidia saw a 265% revenue bump from a year ago. Then, inflation and health care remain key worries for voters.</p>

## Pluralistic: The majority of censorship is self-censorship; The Bezzle excerpt (Part V) (22 Feb 2024)

date: 2024-02-22, from: Cory Doctorow's blog

Today's links The majority of censorship is self-censorship: &#8230;But the majority of self-censorship is intentionally cultivated by an outside power. The Bezzle excerpt (Part V): Keep your hands at 10 and 2. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2009, 2014, 2019, 2023 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading The majority of censorship is self-censorship (permalink) I know a lot of polymaths, but Ada Palmer takes the cake: brilliant science fiction writer, brilliant historian, brilliant librettist, brilliant singer, and then some: https://pluralistic.net/2022/02/10/monopoly-begets-monopoly/#terra-ignota Palmer is a friend and a colleague. In 2018, she, Adrian Johns and I collaborated on "Censorship, Information Control, &#38; Information Revolutions from Printing Press to Internet," a series of grad seminars at the U Chicago History department (where Ada is a tenured prof, specializing in the Inquisition and Renaissance forbidden knowledge): https://ifk.uchicago.edu/research/faculty-fellow-projects/censorship-information-control-information-revolutions-from-printing-press/ The project had its origins in a party game that Ada and I used to play at SF conventions: Ada would describe a way that the Inquisitions' censors attacked the printing press, and I'd find an extremely parallel maneuver from governments, the entertainment industry or other entities from the much more recent history of internet censorship battles. With the seminars, we took it to the next level. Each 3h long session featured a roster of speakers from many disciplines, explaining everything from how encryption works to how white nationalists who were radicalized in Vietnam formed an armored-car robbery gang to finance modems and Apple ][+s to link up neo-Nazis across the USA. We borrowed the structure of these sessions from science fiction conventions, home to a very specific kind of panel that doesn't always work, but when it does, it's fantastic. It was a natural choice: after all, Ada and I know each other through science fiction. Even if you're not an sf person, you've probably heard of the Hugo Awards, the most prestigious awards in the field, voted on each year by attendees of the annual World Science Fiction Convention (Worldcon). And even if you're not an sf fan, you might have heard about a scandal involving the Hugo Awards, which were held last year in China, a first: https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/science-fiction-authors-excluded-hugo-awards-china-rcna139134 A little background: each year's Worldcon is run by a committee of volunteers. These volunteers put together bids to host the Worldcon, and canvass Worldcon attendees to vote in favor of their bid. For many years, a group of Chinese fans attempted to field a successful bid to host a Worldcon, and, eventually, they won. At the time, there were many concerns: about traveling to a country with a poor human rights record and a reputation for censorship, and about the logistics of customary Worldcon attendees getting visas. During this debate, many international fans pointed to the poor human rights record in the USA (which has hosted the vast majority of Worldcons since their inception), and the absolute ghastly rigmarole the US government subjects many foreign visitors to when they seek visas to come to the US for conventions. Whatever side of this debate you came down on, it couldn't be denied that the Chinese Worldcon rang a lot of alarm-bells. Communications were spotty, and then the con was unceremoniously rescheduled for months after the original scheduled date, without any good explanation. Rumors swirled of Chinese petty officials muscling their way into the con's administration. But the real alarm bells started clanging after the Hugo Award ceremony. Normally, after the Hugos are given out, attendees are given paper handouts tallying the nominations and votes, and those numbers are also simultaneously published online. Technically, the Hugo committee has a grace period of some weeks before this data must be published, but at every Worldcon I've attended over the past 30+ years, I left the Hugos with a data-sheet in my hand. Then, in early December, at the very last moment, the Hugo committee released its data &#8211; and all hell broke loose. Numerous, acclaimed works had been unilaterally "disqualified" from the ballot. Many of these were written by writers from the Chinese diaspora, but some works &#8211; like an episode of Neil Gaiman's Sandman &#8211; were seemingly unconnected to any national considerations. Readers and writers erupted in outrage, demanding to know what had happened. The Hugo administrators &#8211; Americans and Canadians who'd volunteered in those roles for many years and were widely viewed as being members in good standing of the community &#8211; were either silent or responded with rude and insulting remarks. One thing they didn't do was explain themselves. The absence of facts left a void that rumors and speculation rushed in to fill. Stories of Chinese official censorship swirled online, and along with them, a kind of I-told-you-so: China should never have been home to a Worldcon, the country's authoritarian national politics are fundamentally incompatible with a literary festival. As the outrage mounted and the scandal breached from the confines of science fiction fans and writers to the wider world, more details kept emerging. A damning set of internal leaks revealed that it was those long-serving American and Canadian volunteers who decided to censor the ballot. They did so out of a vague sense that the Chinese state would visit some unspecified sanction on the con if politically unpalatable works appeared on the Hugo ballot. Incredibly, they even compiled clumsy dossiers on nominees, disqualifying one nominee out of a mistaken belief that he had once visited Tibet (it was actually Nepal). There's no evidence that the Chinese state asked these people to do this. Likewise, it wasn't pressure from the Chinese state that caused them to throw out hundreds of ballots cast by Chinese fans, whom they believed were voting for a "slate" of works (it's not clear if this is the case, but slate voting is permitted under Hugo rules). All this has raised many questions about the future of the Hugo Awards, and the status of the awards that were given in China. There's widespread concern that Chinese fans involved with the con may face state retaliation due to the negative press that these shenanigans stirred up. But there's also a lot of questions about censorship, and the nature of both state and private censorship, and the relationship between the two. These are questions that Ada is extremely well-poised to answer; indeed, they're the subject of her book-in-progress, entitled Why We Censor: from the Inquisition to the Internet. In a magisterial essay for Reactor, Palmer stakes out her central thesis: "The majority of censorship is self-censorship, but the majority of self-censorship is intentionally cultivated by an outside power": https://reactormag.com/tools-for-thinking-about-censorship/ States &#8211; even very powerful states &#8211; that wish to censor lack the resources to accomplish totalizing censorship of the sort depicted in Nineteen Eighty-Four. They can't go from house to house, searching every nook and cranny for copies of forbidden literature. The only way to kill an idea is to stop people from expressing it in the first place. Convincing people to censor themselves is, "dollar for dollar and man-hour for man-hour, much cheaper and more impactful than anything else a censorious regime can do." Ada invokes examples modern and ancient, including from her own area of specialty, the Inquisition and its treatment of Gailileo. The Inquistions didn't set out to silence Galileo. If that had been its objective, it could have just assassinated him. This was cheap, easy and reliable! Instead, the Inquisition persecuted Galileo, in a very high-profile manner, making him and his ideas far more famous. But this isn't some early example of Inquisitorial Streisand Effect. The point of persecuting Galileo was to convince Descartes to self-censor, which he did. He took his manuscript back from the publisher and cut the sections the Inquisition was likely to find offensive. It wasn't just Descartes: "thousands of other major thinkers of the time wrote differently, spoke differently, chose different projects, and passed different ideas on to the next century because they self-censored after the Galileo trial." This is direct self-censorship, where people are frightened into silencing themselves. But there's another form of censorship, which Ada calls "middlemen censorship." That's when someone other than the government censors a work because they fear what the government would do if they didn't. Think of Scholastic's cowardly decision to pull inclusive, LGBTQ books out of its book fair selections even though no one had ordered them to do so: https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/06/books/scholastic-book-racism-maggie-tokuda-hall.html This is a form of censorship outsourcing, and it "multiplies the manpower of a censorship system by the number of individuals within its power." The censoring body doesn't need to hire people to search everyone's houses for offensive books &#8211; it can frighten editors, publishers, distributors, booksellers and librarians into suppressing the books in the first place. This outsourcing blurs the line between state and private surveillance. Think about comics. After a series of high-profile Congressional hearings about the supposed danger of comics to impressionable young minds, the comics industry undertook a regime of self-censorship, through which the private Comics Code Authority would vet comings for "dangerous" content before allowing its seal of approval to appear on the comics' covers. Distributors and retailers refused to carry books without a CCA stamp, so publishers refused to publish books unless they could get a CCA stamp. The CCA was unaccountable, capricious &#8211; and racist. By the 60s and 70s, it became clear that comic about Black characters were subjected to much tighter scrutiny than comics featuring white heroes. The CCA would reject "a drop of sweat on the forehead of a Black astronaut as 'too graphic' since it 'could be mistaken for blood.'" Every comic that got sent back by the CCA meant long, brutal reworkings by writers and illustrators to get them past the censors. The US government never censored heroes like Black Panther, but the chain of events that created the CCA "middleman censors" made sure that Black Panther appeared in far fewer comics starring Marvel's most prominent Black character. An analysis of censorship that tries to draw a line between private and public censorship would say that the government played no role in Black Panther's banishment to obscurity &#8211; but without Congressional action, Black Panther would never have faced censorship. This is why attempts to cleanly divide public and private censorship always break down. Many people will tell you that when Twitter or Facebook blocks content they disagree with, that's not censorship, since censorship is government action, and these are private actors. What they mean is that Twitter and Facebook censorship doesn't violate the First Amendment, but it's perfectly possible to infringe on free speech without violating the US Constitution. What's more, if the government fails to prevent monopolization of our speech forums &#8211; like social media &#8211; and also declines to offer its own public speech forums that are bound to respect the First Amendment, we can end up with government choices that produce an environment in which some ideas are suppressed wherever they might find an audience &#8211; all without violating the Constitution: https://locusmag.com/2020/01/cory-doctorow-inaction-is-a-form-of-action/ The great censorious regimes of the past &#8211; the USSR, the Inquisition &#8211; left behind vast troves of bureaucratic records, and these records are full of complaints about the censors' lack of resources. They didn't have the manpower, the office space, the money or the power to erase the ideas they were ordered to suppress. As Ada notes, "In the period that Spain’s Inquisition was wildly out of Rome’s control, the Roman Inquisition even printed manuals to guide its Inquisitors on how to bluff their way through pretending they were on top of what Spain was doing!" Censors have always done &#8211; and still do &#8211; their work not by wielding power, but by projecting it. Even the most powerful state actors are not powerful enough to truly censor, in the sense of confiscating every work expressing an idea and punishing everyone who creates such a work. Instead, when they rely on self-censorship, both by individuals and by intermediaries. When censors act to block one work and not another, or when they punish one transgressor while another is free to speak, it's tempting to think that they are following some arcane ruleset that defines when enforcement is strict and when it's weak. But the truth is, they censor erratically because they are too weak to censor comprehensively. Spectacular acts of censorship and punishment are a performance, "to change the way people act and think." Censors "seek out actions that can cause the maximum number of people to notice and feel their presence, with a minimum of expense and manpower." The censor can only succeed by convincing us to do their work for them. That's why drawing a line between state censorship and private censorship is such a misleading exercise. Censorship is, and always has been, a public-private partnership. The Bezzle excerpt (Part V) (permalink) I'm out on tour with my new novel, The Bezzle, a cyberpunk revenge thriller about Marty Hench, a two-fisted forensic accountant, and a guerrilla war he wages on a prison-tech provider that treats incarcerated people as assets to be strip-mined: https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/16/narrative-capitalism/#bezzle-tour If you'd like an essay-formatted version of this thread to read or share, here's a link to it on pluralistic.net, my surveillance-free, ad-free, tracker-free blog: https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/22/self-censorship/#acab As part of the promotion for the book, I've been serializing an excerpt: Chapter 14, in which Marty takes on a side-quest to recover the stolen royalties of one-time funk star Stephon Magner (AKA Steve Soul) which were stolen by his scumbag manager and then sold on to an even scummier sample-licensing clearinghouse. Today, I bring you part five, in which Marty's simple cross-referencing project is violently altered by an encounter with the criminal gangs of the LA Sheriffs Deputy departments, a real crime-syndicate whose reign of terror continues to this day: https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-05-17/dozens-of-lasd-deputies-ordered-to-show-suspected-gang-tattoos-reveal-others-who-have-them I'm posting this installment en route to San Diego, where I'll be appearing tonight at Mysterious Galaxy: https://www.mystgalaxy.com/22224Doctorow From there, it's back to LA, where I'm appearing on Saturday evening with Adam Conover at Vroman's: https://www.vromansbookstore.com/Cory-Doctorow-discusses-The-Bezzle And then on Monday I'll be at Third Place Books with Neal Stephenson: https://www.thirdplacebooks.com/event/cory-doctorow From there, I'm off to Portland, Phoenix, Tucson and points further: https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/16/narrative-capitalism/#bezzle-tour Here's part one of the serial: https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/17/the-steve-soul-caper/#lead-singer-disease Part two: https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/19/crad-kilodney-was-an-outlier/#copyright-termination Part three: https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/20/fore/#lawyer-up Part four: https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/21/im-feeling-unlucky/#poacher-turned-keeper And now, part five! * * * The storefront had an old break room with a first-­aid kit, and a bathroom with a sink. I sponged myself clean in the mirror, ate two expired Aleves and three 200 mg expired Tylenols out of the kit. The ass was ripped most of the way out of my pants, so I moved my wallet to my front pocket, which my massage therapist had been nagging at me to do for years. I opened the door more carefully this time and limped out into the parking lot. My rental—­a little red Civic—­was the only car left in the parking lot, except for a rusted junker with no tires that was the perennial sentry of its farthest corner. I bipped the doors open with my fob, checked the back seat, then slid inside. I checked my reflection in the rearview mirror and winced, which pulled at my bruises and set blood oozing from my lip and cheekbone again, which made me wince harder. I was already halfway to Quasimodo and I tried to remember if there was a 7-­Eleven on the route home where I could buy a couple of bags of frozen peas for the swelling. I reset the mirror and backed out of my spot. The pain was increasing. They’d have Advil at the 7-­Eleven, and I’d remembered where there was one on the way back to my Airbnb. As I waited for a red light at Eagle Rock and Colorado Boulevard, I watched as a homeless man labored across the road with his shopping cart. I was still watching him when I realized the light had been green for some time and had just toggled yellow. I made the turn and headed up Colorado, but I was barely a hundred yards down the road when I heard a siren blat and saw the police lights. I checked my mirrors and saw the LASD cruiser directly behind me, racing right up to my bumper, slowing only at the very last moment. The cruiser’s high beams blinked insistently and the siren whooped. I pulled over. I waited while the officer slowly got out of his car and walked to my driver’s-­side window. I kept my hands at ten and two. The officer tapped my window and made a roll-­down motion, so I hit the button, moving slowly, putting my hand back. I got a light in my face, squinting and thus reopening my cheekbone and lip. “Everything all right, sir?” “Yes,” I said, feeling the blood ooze down my chin. “I was beaten up,” I said, stating the obvious. “That is unfortunate,” the officer said. “License and registration.” I got my driver’s license out of my wallet and found the rental papers in the glove box and handed them over. He crunched back to his cruiser and I watched him in the side mirror. He’d left his cruiser’s headlights on and in the glare it was hard to tell, but it looked like there was another cop in the car whom he was conferring with. After a long delay, he came back. “Step out of the car, please.” I did. He turned me around and had me plant my hands on the hood, kicked my feet apart, and roughly frisked me, getting his hand inside the rent in the seat of my pants and patting my boxer shorts and giving my balls a hard squeeze. “Sir, do you know why I stopped you?” “I don’t,” I said. “You proceeded unsafely through a traffic signal. Have you been drinking, sir?” “I haven’t.” “Have you consumed any cannabis or other drugs?” “I haven’t.” He turned me around and shone his light in my eyes. “If I search your car, am I gonna find any drugs?” “No, sir.” “Because I am gonna search that car and if I do find drugs and you’ve been lying to me, this is gonna be a lot worse than it needs to be.” I didn’t dignify that with a response. My head hurt. My face hurt. My back hurt. This was a bullshit stop. I expected the deputy’s partner to get out of the cruiser while my tormentor tossed the rental car, but he stayed put. I did, too. Obviously. I wasn’t going to take off on foot. I’m a forensic accountant, not a gang kid getting fifteen minutes of fame on Cops. He spent long enough on the rental that I started to worry. Who knew what some previous driver might have shoved between the seats? But after pulling out the floor mats and tossing them onto the grassy verge beside the car, he finally stood up. “All right, sir. I’m going to go and get a breathalyzer test. You can refuse it and I will then suspend your license for twenty-­ four hours. I will arrest you for a suspected DUI and bring you in for a blood test. If you fail that test, you will be subject to additional criminal penalties. Do you understand me?” He had old coffee on his breath. My face hurt. “I’ll take a test.” Back to the cruiser. It had been half an hour at least. Once the breathalyzer was done—­fifteen minutes, if memory served—­I could go to the 7-­Eleven for painkillers and frozen peas. I decided I’d add a six-­pack, I was so tired. My face hurt. I knew that mouthing off to this cop wouldn’t make things go faster, quite the opposite, but as he took his leisurely time coming back to me, I was hard-­pressed not to. I blew. “May I sit down?” I asked. “My face hurts.” He didn’t bother to look up from his phone. “Stay where you are, sir.” I stood. My face hurt. Time crawled. Finally, the breathalyzer beeped. He held it up and squinted at it, then used his phone to light up its face. When he did, his sleeve rode up and revealed the “998” tattoo on his forearm. Suddenly, I didn’t care so much about the pain in my face. The cop looked at me. He was an older guy, but quite a silver fox, in a Clooneyoid sort of way. Had the same smile lines at the corners of his lips and eyes. But on him, they looked mean. Dangerous. A man who would smile at you while he beat your face in. “All right, sir,” he said. “I’m going to write you a citation for reckless driving and you will be free to go.” He smiled. “Thank you for your cooperation.” It sounded like “fuck you.” Back to the cruiser again. When he was done writing, he switched off his headlights, and the bubble light inside the car lit up his partner. Heavyset. Smiling. Excellent teeth. He gave me the same look as he had just before kicking me in the ribs. I gasped involuntarily and my ribs burned. His smile got bigger. The Clooneyoid deputy returned with my ticket. I looked at it and then I realized he’d said “reckless driving”—­not “dangerous driving.” This was a summons, not a citation. For a misdemeanor. Two points off my license and I’d have to go to court. Depending on the judge, I could be in for fines or even a jail sentence. Clooneyoid saw me figuring this out and he smiled, too. Everyone was having a great time tonight except for poor old Marty Hench. “See you in court, sir,” he said. I exercised extreme care on the drive to the 7-­Eleven, even backing out of my parking spot and reparking so that I was perfectly centered between the white lines. The clerk didn’t bat an eye at my hamburger face. I gave myself five minutes to bury my bruises in the frozen peas before I backed out and drove the rest of the way to my Airbnb. I drove five under the limit the whole way, and when I got out of my rental, I looked long and hard up and down the street for an LA Sheriff’s Department cruiser.

## Japan’s Nikkei hits record high thanks to chips

date: 2024-02-22, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Tokyo&#8217;s main stock exchange closed at a record high on Thursday, beating a three-decade old record and largely due to semiconductor microchips. The surge comes after U.S.-based chipmaker Nvidia posted Q4 financial results that beat estimates. An Nvidia-based bounce drove tech stocks in Europe too. Also on the program: How will Albania&#8217;s controversial migration deal with Italy work?</p>

## China to Send More Pandas to US, Jump-Starting New Era of 'Panda Diplomacy'

date: 2024-02-22, from: VOA News USA

BEIJING — China's Wildlife Conservation Association is working with the National Zoo in Washington in an arrangement that could bring more pandas back to the United States, signaling improving diplomatic relations between the two superpowers.


China has lent its beloved bears to zoos in various countries over the years as goodwill animal ambassadors and also fostered a modern Sino-U.S. "panda diplomacy" with the gesture.


"Relevant Chinese institutions have signed agreements with the Madrid Zoo in Spain and the San Diego Zoo in the United States on a new round of international cooperation in the protection of giant pandas," said Mao Ning on Thursday, spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry, when addressing a query at a regular press briefing.


"They are also working with the Washington National Zoo in the United States and [Viennna Zoo] in Austria to actively negotiate and launch a new round of cooperation."


Earlier, the Wildlife Conservation Association said on its WeChat social media account that it had reached and signed agreements for the conservation of giant pandas with several zoos.


Back in November, the National Zoo in Washington returned three pandas to China as part of a more than 50-year-old legacy, leaving Georgia's Zoo Atlanta as the only one in the U.S. with a giant panda program.




That loan agreement for the zoo's four pandas expires this year, which meant there would be no pandas in the U.S. for the first time since 1972 when the Chinese government presented two giant pandas as gifts to the United States after President Richard Nixon's historic Cold War visit to China.


"We look forward to a new round of international giant panda protection cooperation with relevant countries, which will further expand scientific research results on the protection of giant pandas and other endangered species, and promote people-to-people bonds and people-to-people friendship," Mao said.


Over the past year, China and the United States have had fraught relations over a number of global issues from regional wars, trade disputes and ongoing spying allegations. Leaders from both countries have had several round of talks over the past few months to ease tensions.

The centerpiece of Republicans&#8217; case for impeaching Democratic president Joe Biden is the allegation that he and his son Hunter each accepted a $5 million bribe from Ukrainian oil and gas company Burisma when Biden Sr. was vice president. But in the last week, that accusation has revealed quite a different problem, one that implicates Republicans.

## Russia Takes Center Stage in US Political Battle

date: 2024-02-22, from: VOA News USA

washington — Russia has taken center stage in American political discourse after the death of a prominent opposition figure there, putting congressional Republicans under increased pressure to support Ukraine.


U.S. President Joe Biden has highlighted in his recent statements one of the differences between him and his challenger, former U.S. President Donald Trump.


At a recent rally, Trump said that if he were president and a NATO member fell short of its financial commitments to the security bloc, he would not protect that ally. "In fact, I would encourage them" — meaning Russia — "to do whatever the hell they want," Trump said.


"Every president since Truman has been a rock-solid supporter of NATO, except for Donald Trump," a stentorian male voice intones in an ad released this week by the Biden campaign. "Trump wants to walk away from NATO. He's even given Putin and Russia the green light to attack America's allies. … No president has ever said anything like it. It's shameful. It's weak. It's dangerous. It's un-American."




The divide was further compounded by the death last week of opposition leader Alexey Navalny in a Russian prison.


Biden has been quick to lay blame and threaten stiff sanctions over the 47-year-old's death in an Arctic penal colony, which Russian officials say was caused by "sudden death syndrome."


"The fact of the matter is, Putin is responsible," Biden said. "Whether he ordered it, he's responsible for the circumstances they put that man in. And it's a reflection of who he is. It just cannot be tolerated. I said there will be a price to pay."


The Kremlin said Biden's allegation is "unfounded" and "insolent," but authorities have denied Navalny's mother access to his body.


A different line


Trump and his Republican Party have taken a different line, with Trump saying he would not support NATO as strongly as Biden has. And, in a recent event with Fox News, he cast himself as a victim of political persecution, like Navalny.


"It's a horrible thing, but it's happening in our country, too," Trump said Tuesday night. "We are turning into a communist country in many ways. And if you look at it, I'm the leading candidate. I get ... I never heard of being indicted before. ... I got indicted four times, I have eight or nine trials, all because of the fact that — and you know this — all because of the fact that I'm in politics."


Trump was vague on how he'd end the war, instead saying that if he were president, Putin would never have invaded Ukraine.


Republicans have grown more vocal in questioning why they should fund the conflict. Russian forces recently captured a key Ukrainian city, Avdiivka, which the White House points to as proof that Ukrainian forces need urgent help.


In urging members of Congress to pass a $60 billion aid package for Ukraine, national security adviser Jake Sullivan argued it is "in our cold-blooded, national security interest to help Ukraine stand up to Putin's vicious and brutal invasion."


"We know from history that when dictators aren't stopped, they keep going," Sullivan told reporters this week in a briefing. "The cost for America rises, and the consequences get more and more severe for our NATO allies and elsewhere in the world."


Some Republicans are confident that they will pass the stalled $95 billion aid package, most of which is for Ukraine.


"I think the slow response from Europe and the United States, of course, that hurts Ukraine," Republican Representative Brian Fitzpatrick said on a recent visit to Ukraine. "And that's why we can't let this happen, why we're going to get something done."


War's symbolism grows


Meanwhile, as Ukraine nears the second anniversary of the invasion and U.S. aid hangs in the balance, the war has taken on greater symbolic meaning.


"This has become about America," journalist and author Peter Pomerantsev told VOA's Russian Service via Skype. He is also a senior fellow at the SNF Agora Institute at Johns Hopkins University. "Will America continue to play the role of a power that keeps its promises, that respects its alliances and that is capable of projecting strength?


"Or is America over as a serious power? That's the question now," he said. "It's no longer about Russia or Ukraine. Now all eyes of the world are on America, and the way America decides will have epic consequences."

<a href="https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/C3ojf4gMDwe">Threads</a> is like a new airport, like Denver's airport was a few years ago, and Twitter feels like the old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaGuardia_Airport">LaGuardia</a>. Not sure what Mastodon feels like. I'll have to think about that. Maybe the airport in New Orleans which is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Armstrong_New_Orleans_International_Airport">Armstrong Field</a> now, IIRC. It used to be called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Armstrong_New_Orleans_International_Airport#:~:text=The%20airport%20was%20originally%20named,Airport%20retained%20the%20code%20NEW.">MSY</a> and it still is actually, even though the name changed.

## Are there any gutsy NYT op-ed columnists?

date: 2024-02-22, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Certainly <i>one</i> of the NYT columnists must have noticed that the management is playing a dangerous game with our election.</p>
<p>When are they going to write a column raising the question of how non-transparent the process is, and how dangerous it has become. </p>
<p>Might take a bit of courage to do that, and being willing to put your career on the line, for all of us.</p>
<p>Just asking the question, even if they fired you, seems as big an issue as the question raised by the special prosecutor re Biden's age?</p>
<p>I've been a columnist for a somewhat major publication myself, and I promise you, if I were witnessing what's going on at the NYT, I'd submit the column, and if they didn't run it, I'd offer it to their competitors, and if they wouldn't take it, I'd run it publicly on a blog, and say that they wouldn't run it. </p>
<p>You can't really witness something like this without speaking up. They gave you the platform, you should use it.</p>

## Alleged Japanese Crime Boss Accused of Trafficking Nuclear Material

date: 2024-02-22, from: VOA News USA

new york — A leader of a Japan-based crime syndicate conspired to traffic uranium and plutonium from Myanmar in the belief that Iran would use it to make nuclear weapons, U.S. prosecutors alleged Wednesday. 


Takeshi Ebisawa, 60, and his confederates showed samples of nuclear materials that had been transported from Myanmar to Thailand to an undercover Drug Enforcement Administration agent posing as a narcotics and weapons trafficker who had access to an Iranian general, according to federal officials. The nuclear material was seized, and samples were later found to contain uranium and weapons-grade plutonium. 


"As alleged, the defendants in this case trafficked in drugs, weapons and nuclear material — going so far as to offer uranium and weapons-grade plutonium fully expecting that Iran would use it for nuclear weapons," DEA Administrator Anne Milgram said in a statement. "This is an extraordinary example of the depravity of drug traffickers who operate with total disregard for human life." 


The nuclear material came from an unidentified leader of an "ethic insurgent group" in Myanmar who had been mining uranium in the country, according to prosecutors. Ebisawa had proposed that the leader sell uranium through him in order to fund a weapons purchase from the general, court documents allege. 


According to prosecutors, the insurgent leader provided samples, which a U.S. federal lab found contained uranium, thorium and plutonium, and that "the isotope composition of the plutonium" was weapons-grade, meaning enough of it would be suitable for use in a nuclear weapon. 


Ebisawa, who prosecutors allege is a leader of a Japan-based international crime syndicate, was among four people who were arrested in April 2022 in Manhattan during a DEA sting operation. He has been jailed awaiting trial and is among two defendants named in a superseding indictment. Ebisawa is charged with the international trafficking of nuclear materials, conspiracy to commit that crime, and several other counts. 


An email seeking comment was sent to Ebisawa's attorney, Evan Loren Lipton. 


U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said Ebisawa trafficked the material from Myanmar to other countries. 


"He allegedly did so while believing that the material was going to be used in the development of a nuclear weapons program, and the weapons-grade plutonium he trafficked, if produced in sufficient quantities, could have been used for that purpose," Williams said in the news release. "Even as he allegedly attempted to sell nuclear materials, Ebisawa also negotiated for the purchase of deadly weapons, including surface-to-air missiles." 


The defendants are scheduled to be arraigned Thursday in federal court in Manhattan.

## Biden Cancels Federal Student Loans for Nearly 153,000 Borrowers

date: 2024-02-22, from: VOA News USA

CULVER CITY, Calif.  — President Joe Biden said Wednesday that while a college degree was still a ticket to a better life, that ticket is often too expensive, as he announced he was canceling federal student loans for nearly 153,000 borrowers.


Biden, who is in the midst of a three-day campaign swing through California, made the announcement as part of a new repayment plan that offers a faster path to forgiveness, putting the spotlight on his debt cancellation efforts in his reelection campaign.


"Too many Americans are still saddled with unsustainable debt in exchange for a college degree," he said from a local library before he went on to campaign-related events. Loan relief helps the greater economy, he said, because "when people have a student debt relief, they buy homes. They start businesses, they contribute. They engage."


The administration began sending email notifications on Wednesday to some of the borrowers who will benefit from what the White House has called the SAVE program. The cancellations were originally scheduled to start in July, but last month the administration said it would be ready almost six months ahead of schedule, in February.


"Starting today, the first round of folks who are enrolled in our SAVE student loan repayment plan who have paid their loans for 10 years and borrowed $12,000 or less will have their debt cancelled," Biden posted on social media Wednesday. "That's 150,000 Americans and counting. And we're pushing to relieve more."


The first round of forgiveness from the SAVE plan will clear $1.2 billion in loans. The borrowers will get emails with a message from Biden notifying them that "all or a portion of your federal student loans will be forgiven because you qualify for early loan forgiveness under my Administration's SAVE Plan."


In his email to borrowers, Biden wrote he had heard from "countless people who have told me that relieving the burden of their student loan debt will allow them to support themselves and their families, buy their first home, start a small business, and move forward with life plans they've put on hold."


More than 7.5 million people have enrolled in the new repayment plan.


He said Wednesday that it was the kind of relief "that can be life-changing for individuals and their families."


"I'm proud to have been able to give borrowers like so many of you the relief you earned," he said, asking the crowd gathered for his speech how many had debt forgiven. Many raised their hands.


Borrowers are eligible for cancellation if they are enrolled in the SAVE plan, originally borrowed $12,000 or less to attend college and have made at least 10 years of payments. Those who took out more than $12,000 will be eligible for cancellation but on a longer timeline. For each $1,000 borrowed beyond $12,000, it adds an additional year of payments on top of 10 years.


The maximum repayment period is capped at 20 years for those with only undergraduate loans and 25 years for those with any graduate school loans.


Biden announced the new repayment plan last year alongside a separate plan to cancel up to $20,000 in loans for millions of Americans. The Supreme Court struck down his plan for widespread forgiveness, but the repayment plan has so far escaped that level of legal scrutiny. Unlike his proposal for mass cancellation — which had never been done before — the repayment plan is a twist on existing income-based plans created by Congress more than a decade ago.


Biden said he remained steadfast in his commitment to "fix our broken student loan system," working around the court's ruling to find other ways to get it done.

## Why Clean Energy Projects Are Stalling Out on Native Lands

date: 2024-02-22, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTUyODEwNy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1NzQyOTY2MH0.y5GsP87im-X8qP6a99SfiiAAtrxCnoDqLS8cZ9P36LU/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">
	It’s windy in the Great Plains and it’s sunny in the Southwest. These two basic geographic facts underscore much of the green energy transition in the United States — and put many Native American tribes squarely in the middle of that process.</p><p>
	The National Renewable Energy Laboratory <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy13osti/57748.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has estimated</a> that “American Indian land comprises approximately 2% of U.S. land but contains an estimated 5% of all renewable energy resources,” with an especially large amount of potential solar power. Over the past few months, a spate of renewable energy projects across the country have found themselves entangled with courts, regulators, and tribal governments over how and under what circumstances they are permitted on — or even near — tribal lands.</p><p>
	In Oklahoma, a federal judge ordered that <a href="https://tulsaworld.com/news/local/indigenous/judge-orders-removal-of-wind-farm-opposed-by-osage-nation/article_4b8a68a0-a013-11ee-b127-77bf0d501d98.html" target="_blank">dozens of wind turbines be removed</a> after ruling that the developers had violated federal law by not seeking mineral rights<em><strong>.</strong></em> In Arizona, <a href="https://www.archaeologysouthwest.org/wp-content/uploads/Updated-Press-Release-Tribes-File-Federal-Lawsuit-to-Halt-Sunzia-Project-and-Protect-Sacred-and-Historic-Sites.pdf" target="_blank">two tribes and two nonprofits sued</a> the Bureau of Land Management, objecting to the planned route of a massive transmission project. Tribes <a href="https://ctclusi.org/tribe-disappointed-with-wind-energy-decision-citing-failure-of-boem-to-honor-its-obligations-to-tribe-and-impacts-to-fisheries-cultural-resources-and-heritage/" target="_blank">objected to designating</a> an area off the Oregon coast for wind farming, and federal energy regulators announced a new policy requiring energy developers to get tribal permission prior to seeking any permits for projects on tribal lands.</p><p>
<span></span>“We are establishing a new policy that the Commission will not issue preliminary permits for projects proposing to use Tribal lands if the Tribe on whose lands the project is to be located opposes the permit,” <a href="https://ferc.gov/media/h-5-p-15309-000" target="_blank">the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</a> said in a filing denying a trio of pumped-storage hydropower projects on Navajo Nation land in Arizona and New Mexico.</p><p>
	“Navajo Nation is in support of solar power, and the Navajo utility has <a href="https://www.ntua.com/caresactsolar.html" target="_blank">developed some solar sites</a>, which are operating right now,” George Hardeen, public relations director for the Navajo Nation leadership, told me. “But pumped storage, we’re not quite ready for that.” Just like everyone else in Arizona, New Mexico, or neighboring states, the Navajo Nation has a heavily contested relationship with its surrounding water resources. The Navajo Nation recently lost a case in the Supreme Court, where it argued the federal government had an obligation to <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/2023/06/supreme-court-rules-5-4-against-navajo-nation-in-water-rights-dispute/" target="_blank">meet its water needs</a> under 1868 and 1849 treaties.</p><p>While the legal issues around tribal governance are distinct, the dilemmas and tradeoffs of energy development — renewable or otherwise — are not. Energy production itself is nothing new for the Navajo Nation. The <a href="https://media.srpnet.com/navajo-generating-station-permanently-shuts-down/" target="_blank">now-shuttered Navajo Generating Station</a> operated for almost 50 years with a workforce that was almost exclusively Navajo. Along with a neighboring mine, it generated tens of millions of dollars of royalty and other payments for the Navajo Nation and the neighboring Hopi Tribe.
</p><p>But the competing goals of speedy renewable energy development versus protection of the landscape become heightened on native lands.<br/>
</p><p>
	“You’ve always had consultation requirements,” Heather Tanana, a visiting professor at the University of California-Irvine, told me. “The big change is the weight of the tribal voice in that process,” describing FERC’s policy as a “shift to actual empowerment of tribal communities who decide what is going to happen.”
</p><p>
	FERC’s decision is consistent with a Biden administration-wide effort to empower tribes on a “nation-to-nation” basis. This effort has naturally heavily involved the Department of Interior — led for the first time by a Native American, Pueblo of Laguna member Deb Haaland — which oversees the Bureau of Indian Affairs, as well as a bevy of agencies including the Bureau of Land Management and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, which play major roles in energy infrastructure.
</p><p>
	“Having the agency take this position is consistent is what the administration has said it should do,” Tanana said. “It’s good because it shows something tangible and real, and not just good intentions that haven’t always played out well in the past.”</p><p>That’s putting it mildly. The history of energy development and Native Americans is marked by exploitation, whether the subject is the <a href="https://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=OS005" target="_blank">Osage murders</a> of the 1920s, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3222290/" target="_blank">lung cancer</a> among Navajo uranium mine workers, or the construction of dams that <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/klamath-river-iron-gate-dam" target="_blank">obliterated native fishing grounds</a>. </p><p>“The Biden administration is very sensitive to tribal concerns,” Warigia Bowman, a law professor at the University of Tulsa, told me. But enforcement of the new requirements will be up to regulators and prosecutors across the country, Bowman said.<br/></p><p>
	That enforcement has been especially harsh in Osage County. Typically, landowners control both the surface and mineral rights of their land, which essentially means they can sell both the land they own and the rights to what’s underneath it. But the mineral rights on the Osage Nation Reservation are exclusively owned by the Osage Tribe and overseen by the elected Osage Minerals Council, which can lease out mineral rights. And, like many in the petroleum business, the Osage Minerals Council has <a href="https://osagenews.org/osage-minerals-council-oil-and-gas-is-here-to-stay/" target="_blank">lamented limitations on drilling</a>.</p><p>
<span></span>“What’s special about the Osage wind case is the specifics of land ownership for the Osage,” Bowman said. “It’s unusual to have surface and mineral rights separated.”
</p><p>
	It’s these mineral rights that have turned into a massive headache for wind developers. The energy developers Enel and Osage Wind leased over 8,000 acres in Osage County for a wind farm starting in 2010. The Osage Minerals Council sued in 2011, saying the project would block its ability to develop any resources underneath the area the developers had leased. Then the federal government sued in 2014 when construction began, arguing that the excavation for the wind turbines’ foundations constituted mining without permission.
</p><p>
	Late last year, a federal judge ruled that the developers owed monetary damages and the “ejectment of the wind towers.” The developers estimated that complying with the injunction <a href="https://www.oklahoman.com/story/news/2024/02/17/osage-nation-oklahoma-wind-farm-ruling-wake-up-call/72538442007/" target="_blank">would cost almost $260 million</a>.
</p><p>And energy development doesn't have to be on tribal land in order to potentially run afoul of laws and regulations mandating consultation. The Tohono O’odham Nation and San Carlos Apache Tribe, along with the nonprofit groups the Center for Biological Diversity and Archeological Southwest, sued the Bureau of Land Management seeking an injunction to stop construction of the SunZia transmission line, <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/29052023/sunzia-transmission-project-approval/" target="_blank">a decades-in-the-waiting</a> 4,500 megawatt project that seeks to bring wind energy west from New Mexico. The project got approval from BLM last spring. The suit filed in January argued that the developers failed to adequately consult with tribes over “sacred and cultural resources in the San Pedro Valley,” even if the <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/tribal-lawsuits-threaten-bidens-clean-energy-push/" target="_blank">proposed route</a> was on a mixture of federal, state, and private land.</p><p>“Under the [National Historic Preservation Act], agencies are required to make a good faith effort to identify Indian tribes for consultation,” Tory Fodder, a law professor at the University of Arizona, explained to me in an email. “The NHPA provides fairly robust consultation mechanisms for tribal cultural and religious sites that are not necessarily confined to the reservation of a tribe.” Since, Fodder said, both the Tohono O’odham Nation and the San Carlos Apache claim “ancestral connections to the area,” they should have been consulted early on.<del></del></p><p>The BLM and Pattern Energy both claim they were. In a response to the suit, the <a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/eenews/f/eenews/?id=0000018d-a86b-dff1-a7df-edfb35060000" target="_blank">federal government argued</a> that it had “engaged in lengthy, good faith consultation efforts with the Tribes and other consulting parties regarding the San Pedro Valley,” and that the route had been finalized since 2015, giving the tribes and nonprofits years to intervene. </p><p>In an emailed statement, Pattern Energy’s vice president of environmental and permitting, Natalie McCue, said: “Respecting tribal sovereignty and completing the United States’ largest clean energy project is not a binary choice. We deeply respect the Tohono O’odham Nation’s and the San Carlos Apache Tribe’s right to self-governance and to express their views on cultural protection. Given this, we were saddened by the decision to pursue legal action, especially given our commitment to open, good-faith dialogue on these vital issues.” Oral arguments in the case are scheduled for March; in the meantime, construction has been allowed to continue.</p><p>
	On the West Coast, there's growing tribal opposition to the beginning of a process for offshore wind development. The Confederated Tribes of the Coos, Lower Umpqua, and Siuslaw Indians said they were “extremely disappointed” in the Bureau Ocean Energy Management’s decision to designate two areas off the Oregon coast <a href="https://www.boem.gov/newsroom/press-releases/boem-finalizes-wind-energy-areas-oregon" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">for wind energy development</a>. </p><p>While the BOEM said the designation only came after “extensive engagement and feedback from the state, Tribes, local residents, ocean users, federal government partners, and other members of the public,” the Confederated Tribes contend that the areas “are within the Tribe’s ancestral territory, contain viewsheds of significant cultural and historic significance to the Tribe, and are important areas for Tribal fishing,” and that the Tribes only became aware of the designation from the Oregon Governor’s office, not the BOEM directly.
</p><p>Although the stakes of the zero-carbon transition are new, the issues of sovereignty and exploitation of Native American lands are as old as the United States. “The Tribe will not stand by while a project is developed that causes it more harm than good,” the Tribal Council Chair Brad Kneaper said in a release. “This is simply green colonialism.” </p>

## Biden's Team Challenges How President Is Portrayed in Press

date: 2024-02-21, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — Occupants of the White House have grumbled over news coverage practically since the place was built. Now it's U.S. President Joe Biden's turn: With a reelection campaign underway, there are signs that those behind the president are starting to more aggressively and publicly challenge how he is portrayed. 


Within the past two weeks, an administration aide sent an unusual letter to the White House Correspondents' Association complaining about coverage of a special counsel's report on Biden's handling of classified documents. In addition, the president's campaign objected to its perception that negative stories about Biden's age got more attention than remarks by Donald Trump about the NATO alliance. 


It's not quite "enemy of the people" territory. But it is noticeable. 


"It is a strategy," said Frank Sesno, a professor at George Washington University and former CNN Washington bureau chief. "It does several things at once. It makes the press a foil, which is a popular pattern for politicians of all stripes." 


It can also distract voters from bad news. And while some newsrooms quickly dismiss the criticism, he says, others may pause and think twice about what they write. 


The letter from Ian Sams, spokesman for the White House counsel's office, suggested that reporters improperly framed stories about the February 8 release of Special Counsel Robert Hur's report. Sams pointed to stories by CBS News, The Wall Street Journal, The Associated Press and others emphasizing that Hur had found evidence that Biden willfully retained and disclosed classified material. Sams wrote that much of that so-called evidence didn't hold up and was negated by Hur's decision not to press charges. 


He said it was critical to address it when "significant errors" like misstating the findings and conclusions of a federal investigation of a president occur. 


It was Sams' second foray into press criticism in a few months; last fall, he urged journalists to give more scrutiny to House Republicans and the reasons behind their impeachment inquiry of Biden. 


"Everybody makes mistakes, and nobody's perfect," Sams told the AP. "But a healthy back and forth over what's the full story helps make both the press and the government sharper in how the country and world get the news they need to hear." 


Kelly O'Donnell, president of the correspondents' association and an NBC News correspondent, suggested Sams' concerns were misdirected and should be addressed to individual news organizations. 


"It is inappropriate for the White House to utilize internal pool distribution channels, primarily for logistics and the rapid sharing of need-to-know information, to disseminate generalized critiques of news coverage," O'Donnell said. 


In a separate statement, Biden campaign spokesman T.J. Ducklo criticized media outlets for time spent discussing the 81-year-old president's age and mental capacity, an issue that was raised anew when Biden addressed the Hur report with reporters. He suggested that was less newsworthy and important than Trump's NATO comments. 


Americans deserve a press corps that covers Trump "with the seriousness and ferocity this moment requires," said Ducklo, who resigned from the White House in 2021 for threatening a reporter. 


To be fair, deadline times likely affected the initial disparity in coverage that Ducklo pointed out. And Trump's remarks have hardly been ignored by media outlets. 


The criticism comes amid the backdrop of unhappiness among some journalists about how much Biden is made available for questions — an issue that surfaced again when Biden turned down an opportunity to appear before tens of millions of Americans in an interview during the Super Bowl pregame show. 


The 33 news conferences Biden has given during the first three years of his presidency is lower than any other American president in that time span since Ronald Reagan, said Martha Kumar, a Towson University professor emeritus and expert on presidents and the press. Similarly, the 86 interviews Biden has given is lower than any president since she began studying records with Reagan. By comparison, Barack Obama gave 422 interviews during his first three years. 


Instead, Biden prefers more informal appearances where reporters ask a few questions, with comparatively little opportunity for follow-up, she said: The 535 such sessions that Biden conducted was second only to Trump's 572. 


One example followed Biden's remarks Friday after the death of Russian dissident Alexey Navalny. Another was Biden's early evening availability following the release of Hur's report, a chaotic scene where reporters tried to outshout one another. The president's performance, and remarks about his forgetfulness that were made in Hur's report, led to more questions about the impact of age on his ability. 


"It did not serve him well," Kumar said. Some on Biden's team, meanwhile, believe the president showed a combativeness in the face of criticism that Americans will appreciate.

## Head of Boeing's 737 MAX Program Leaves After Midair Incident

date: 2024-02-21, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Boeing said on Wednesday it was replacing the head of its troubled 737 MAX program effective immediately, the first major executive departure since the January 5 midair panel blowout of a new Alaska Airlines MAX 9. 


Ed Clark, who had been with the plane-maker for nearly 18 years, departed as Boeing has been dealing with its latest crisis and has vowed to ramp up quality efforts. 


Regulators have curbed the plane-maker's production, and lawmakers and customers have been scrutinizing production and safety measures.  


Boeing has scrambled to explain and strengthen safety procedures after a door panel detached during flight on a new Alaska Airlines 737 MAX 9, forcing pilots to make an emergency landing while passengers were exposed to a gaping hole 16,000 feet above the ground.  


Clark's departure came after Boeing's board met this week and approved the changes, according to sources familiar with the matter. He oversaw the company's production facility in Renton, Washington, where the plane involved in the accident was completed. 


Clark was previously chief mechanic and engineer for the 737 before being named head of the program in 2021. He was the fifth person in four years to run the 737 program. 


Katie Ringgold is replacing him as vice president and general manager of the 737 program, according to a memo seen by Reuters sent to staff by Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Stan Deal, who said the plane-maker was working to ensure "that every airplane we deliver meets or exceeds all quality and safety requirements. Our customers demand, and deserve, nothing less." 


The latest mishap occurred as Boeing was still working to rebuild its reputation following the 20-month grounding of the 737 MAX following two fatal crashes that killed a total of 346 people. That grounding was lifted in November 2020.  


Airline industry executives have expressed frustration with Boeing's quality control. The only other major manufacturer of commercial aircraft is France's Airbus. 


The memo was first reported by the Seattle Times. 


The FAA grounded the MAX 9 for several weeks in January and has capped Boeing's production of the MAX while it audits the plane-maker's manufacturing process, which has suffered a string of quality issues in recent years. 


The door panel that flew off the MAX 9 appeared to be missing four key bolts, according to a preliminary report from the U.S. National Safety Transportation Board in early February. The panel is a plug-in placed on some 737 MAX 9s instead of an additional emergency exit.  


According to the report, the door plug in question was removed to repair rivet damage, but the NTSB has not found evidence the bolts were reinstalled. 


The disclosure has prompted anger among Boeing's airline customers. Some, including Alaska Airlines, announced they would conduct enhanced quality oversight of planes before they leave the Boeing factory.

## Czech Republic Extradites Suspect in Iran-Backed Murder Plot to US

date: 2024-02-21, from: VOA News USA

PRAGUE — The Czech Republic on Wednesday extradited a man facing charges in the United States for plotting the murder of a prominent critic of Iran's government, the Czech Justice Ministry said. 


The ministry said Polad Omarov was handed to representatives of U.S. authorities at the Prague Vaclav Havel Airport on Wednesday morning after the suspect had exhausted all options of appeal. 


Omarov was arrested in the Czech Republic in January 2023. The ministry said the justice minister had ruled in July last year in favor of extradition, but the action was delayed by the suspect's complaint with the constitutional court, which was rejected. 


Omarov, along with Rafat Amirov and Khalid Mehdiyev, were charged with murder-for-hire and money laundering for their roles in the thwarted Tehran-backed assassination attempt of a critic of Iran's government who is a U.S. citizen and lives in Brooklyn, New York. 


The U.S. did not name the alleged victim when it detailed charges in January 2023, but Mehdiyev was arrested in 2022 in New York for having a rifle outside the Brooklyn home of journalist Masih Alinejad. A longtime critic of Iran's head-covering laws has promoted videos of women violating those laws to her millions of social media followers. 


U.S. prosecutors in 2021 also charged four Iranians alleged to be intelligence operatives for Tehran with plotting to kidnap a New York-based journalist and activist. While the target of that plot was not named, Reuters confirmed it was Alinejad. 


U.S. prosecutors have said Omarov was a resident of the Czech Republic and Slovenia. The Czech Justice Ministry said on Wednesday he was a citizen of Georgia.

## Is This the End of American Polyester?

date: 2024-02-21, from: Heatmap News

Many that have been tested are linked to serious human health risks like cancer and reproductive harm. And yet, they continue to pollute our air, water, food, and consumer products.<br/></p><p>Among these is 1,4-dioxane, a chemical solvent that’s been <a href="https://cen.acs.org/environment/pollution/14-Dioxane-Another-forever-chemical/98/i43" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">linked</a> to liver cancer in lab rodents and classified as a probable human carcinogen. It’s a multipurpose petrochemical, issuing from the brownfields of defunct industrial sites, chemical plants, and factories that use it in solvents, paint strippers, and degreasers. It shows up as an unintentional contaminant in consumer personal care products, <a href="https://www.wcia.com/business/press-releases/cision/20230117CG88857/ny-state-bans-laundry-detergents-containing-probable-carcinogen-dioxane-free-brand-ingredients-matter-shares-results-of-study/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">detergents</a>, and cleaning products and then goes down the drain into sewer systems. </p><p>It is also an unavoidable byproduct from the production of polyethylene terephthalate, more commonly known as PET, one of the most ubiquitous materials in the world. PET is the clear, odorless, food-safe plastic bottle you drink water out of. It’s also the basis of the world’s most popular fabric, used in everything from yoga leggings to baby onesies and area rugs; more than half of all fabric manufactured worldwide today is polyester. “You can't make PET polyester without creating this toxic byproduct 1,4-dioxane,” Mike Belliveau, co-founder of the advocacy organization <a href="https://defendourhealth.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Defend Our Health</a>, told me. “It’s uniquely tied to the chemistry of the polymer.”</p><p>To be clear, there is no 1,4-dioxane in polyester products themselves. But like so-called “<a href="https://heatmap.news/lifestyle/raincoats-pfas-gore-tex-patagonia-rei" target="_self">forever chemicals,</a>” 1,4-dioxane dissolves quickly and completely into water, making it <a href="https://cen.acs.org/environment/pollution/14-Dioxane-Another-forever-chemical/98/i43" target="_blank">almost impossible to remove</a> once it gets into a river or reservoir.<br/></p><p>In 2012, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency included 1,4-dioxane in the third iteration of what’s called the Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule, a <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2015-10/documents/ucmr3_factsheet_general.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">list</a> the agency puts out every five years of chemicals it considers suspicious and wants states to start testing for. The EPA’s Toxic Release Inventory data shows that in 2019, the <a href="https://cen.acs.org/environment/pollution/14-Dioxane-Another-forever-chemical/98/i43" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">top four </a>industrial producers of 1,4-dioxane in the U.S. were PET plastic or polyester factories; <a href="https://enviro.epa.gov/triexplorer/release_fac?p_view=USFA&fld=&trilib=TRIQ1&TAB_RPT=1&Fedcode=&LINESPP=&sort=RE_TOLBY&industry=ALL&FLD=RELLBY&FLD=TSFDSP&sort_fmt=2&TopN=&STATE=All+states&COUNTY=All+counties&chemical=0000123911&year=2022&report=&BGCOLOR=%23D0E0FF&FOREGCOLOR=black&FONT_FACE=arial&FONT_SIZE=10+pt&FONT_WIDTH=normal&FONT_STYLE=roman&FONT_WEIGHT=bold" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in 2022</a>, it was five out of the top 10. That same year, a polyester manufacturer lost its permit to dispose of its waste at a treatment plant in New Jersey after state authorities discovered 1,4-dioxane in the drinking water and <a href="https://www.mcall.com/2022/01/25/cancer-causing-substance-in-new-jersey-drinking-water-traced-to-lehigh-county-authority-waste-treatment-plant/?clearUserState=true" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">traced it back</a> to the company.</p><p>Now, nearly 12 years later, not only has 1,4-dioxane proved to be shockingly prevalent, it has also been shown to be shockingly dangerous. The EPA may be on the verge of declaring, effectively, that almost any exposure to 1,4-dioxane constitutes an unreasonable risk to human health. Doing so would rock the American chemical and plastics manufacturing industry. But the alternative is being okay with <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/17/health/cancer-incidence-rising-report/index.html" target="_blank">rising cancer rates</a> – an inconvenient fact the chemical industry would rather you not think about when you’re at the store.</p><h3>In the Water</h3><p>North Carolina offers one representative case study. In 2013, a team <a href="https://www.northcarolinahealthnews.org/2016/09/12/tainted-waters-new-drinking-water-threat-concerns-scientists-officials/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">from NC State University</a> began testing for and finding 1,4-dioxane throughout the Cape Fear watershed, a network of rivers that starts in the mountains above Greensboro and flows southeast through Fayetteville and Wilmington before emptying into the ocean. At first, it was unclear exactly who the culprit of this widespread carcinogenic contamination could be. But by 2015, researchers <a href="https://www.northcarolinahealthnews.org/2016/09/12/tainted-waters-new-drinking-water-threat-concerns-scientists-officials/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">had pinpointed</a> a handful of sources: the wastewater treatment plants of Asheboro, Greensboro, and Reidsville. </p><p>Greensboro processed wastewater from <a href="https://ncnewsline.com/2023/07/21/investigations-into-spikes-of-in-14-dioxane-in-asheboro-high-point-still-inconclusive/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an industrial waste transporter and chemical plant</a>, Asheboro from a plastics plant, and Reidsville from Dystar, a dye and chemical manufacturer, and Unifi, a polyester manufacturer. DAK (now known as Alpek), another plastic manufacturer in Fayetteville, was also <a href="https://ncnewsline.com/2023/07/21/investigations-into-spikes-of-in-14-dioxane-in-asheboro-high-point-still-inconclusive/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">releasing 1,4-dioxane</a> into the Lower Cape Fear River near Wilmington at a high enough level to consistently violate its permit. It is impossible at the moment to distinguish 1,4-dioxane’s impact on the health of people in the Cape Fear watershed <a href="https://ncnewsline.com/2022/10/20/pfas-found-in-blood-samples-of-more-than-1000-people-in-cape-fear-river-basin/" target="_blank">from the impact</a> of the more infamous class of carcinogenic forever chemicals that also lurk there: PFAS. But as with many pollutants, in the U.S., 1,4-dioxane’s is <a href="https://defendourhealth.org/news/federal-government-concludes-that-common-plastic-endangers-human-health/" target="_blank">disproportionately found</a> in Black and Brown communities.</p><p>Wherever PET or polyester is made, from the Gulf Coast to the Nakdonggang watershed in Korea, 1,4-dioxane is a problem. Typical water treatment technology can’t remove it, so when polyester manufacturers or other industries discharge contaminated wastewater to municipal treatment plants, the carcinogen flows right through and ends up in the groundwater or watershed.</p><p>In North Carolina, the state, the cities, and manufacturers began arguing about what could, and should, be done about it. “My biggest concern in drinking water in North Carolina right now, it’s 1-4 dioxane,” Tom Reeder, Assistant Secretary for the Environment at the state Department of Environmental Quality, <a href="https://www.northcarolinahealthnews.org/2016/09/12/tainted-waters-new-drinking-water-threat-concerns-scientists-officials/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> in 2016. </p><p>Dystar and Unifi submitted remediation plans to Reidsville, and Dystar <a href="https://edocs.deq.nc.gov/WaterResources/DocView.aspx?dbid=0&id=3123923&cr=1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> the NC Department of Environmental Quality’s Division of Water Resources that it was distilling the 1,4-dioxane out of its wastewater and storing it on-site. Dystar didn’t answer Heatmap’s questions, and Unifi said the spokesperson qualified to speak on the topic wasn’t available. The NC DEQ referred Heatmap to Reidsville, which didn’t respond to calls and emails. The lead 1,4-dioxane researcher at NC State also did not respond to requests for information or an interview. </p><p>Perhaps this is because of how contentious this issue has been for all involved parties. In 2022, the NC Environmental Management Commission attempted to make a rule limiting 1,4-dioxane in factory wastewater to .35 parts per billion. Unifi and Dystar wrote letters protesting the rule and Asheboro filed a lawsuit against the limits, with <a href="https://courier-tribune.com/news/local/asheboro-sues-to-stop-limit-on-chemical-discharge/article_94599890-bfee-5a57-8613-aa717a2d9b79.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Reidsville attempting to join</a>. The rule was eventually <a href="https://ncnewsline.com/2023/07/21/investigations-into-spikes-of-in-14-dioxane-in-asheboro-high-point-still-inconclusive/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">nullified</a> because it didn’t fully consider the financial burden it would impose on these cities. </p><p>But the way the science is going, these decisions may be taken out of North Carolina’s hands. </p><h3>An Unreasonable Risk</h3><p>In 2016, Congress passed an amendment to the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA, or “toss kuh”) instructing the EPA to fast-track risk analyses of chemicals of concern. Under the new law, if the EPA finds that a chemical poses an “unreasonable risk” to human health, it is required to regulate it down to reasonable levels — regardless of the economic impact. One of the first 10 chemicals on the docket was 1,4-dioxane. </p><p>Then, of course, came 2017 and the arrival of the Trump administration, which interfered to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/23/trump-appointees-epa-toxic-chemical-pfas-pfbs-toxic" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">weaken</a> EPA’s published toxicity findings to make them cheaper for industry to comply with. For example, the 1,4-dioxane analysis excluded the risk of exposure via drinking water, even though more than <a href="https://cen.acs.org/environment/pollution/14-Dioxane-Another-forever-chemical/98/i43" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">7 million people in the U.S</a>. have drinking water with detectable levels of 1,4-dioxane. Many of the findings were <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/ninth-circuit-urged-to-force-epa-to-take-new-look-at-cancer-causing-chemical/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">repeatedly challenged</a> in court. </p><p>When the Biden administration reanalyzed 1,4-dioxane, the draft findings published in 2023 said that 1,4-dioxane poses an “unreasonable risk” to the health of PET and polyester plant workers and people with contaminated drinking water. “As high as 2.3 in 100 exposed workers would be at risk of cancer over a lifetime of exposure,” Jon Kalmuss-Katz, a senior attorney with Earthjustice, which has submitted comments to the EPA, told me. “The EPA considers the range of unreasonable risk to be one in 10,000 to one in a million.” That’s a 100- to 10,000-fold difference.</p><p>Some advocates saw a death knell for any remaining environmental arguments for polyester. “The federal government basically concluded that polyester PET poses an unreasonable risk to human health,” Belliveau told me. </p><p>The risk evaluation has already gone through a comment period and a peer-review process, and the EPA expects to finalize its evaluation this year. When asked for comment, an EPA representative said, “Actual conditions and releases are highly variable and subject to site-by-site process conditions. The draft supplement to the risk evaluation should not be interpreted to suggest all sites that manufacture PET or polyester present unreasonable risk.” </p><p>Despite letters from the American Chemistry Council, the Cleaning Institute, the Plastics Industry Association, and the PET manufacturer Alpek (formerly DAK) attempting to poke holes in the science, the advocates I spoke to were confident the “unreasonable risk” determination will stay. </p><p>At that point, the EPA has several tools it can use. “EPA can regulate manufacturing, can ban the chemical, can ban uses of the chemical, can restrict releases of the chemical to the environment,” says Kalmuss-Katz. “But the underlying mandate is always the same. EPA has to ensure that the chemical no longer presents an unreasonable risk.”</p><p>According to Thomas Mohr, a hydrogeologist who wrote the book on the<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Environmental-Investigation-Remediation-4-Dioxane-Stabilizers/dp/1566706629" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> investigation and remediation of 1,4-dioxane</a>, polyester plants could simply require employees to wear respirators, and there are commercially available technologies available to filter out the chemical from wastewater — things like vacuum stripping and incineration, collecting it on a resin, or blasting it with ultraviolet light. But these processes are specialized and come with added costs. </p><p>That latter consideration is important for an industry that is already struggling to compete with low-cost polyester from China and other developing countries. Of the 115 American polyester manufacturing companies in the 1970s, only 12 remain in business today, according to a history book by Unifi, the polyester manufacturer in Reidsville. </p><p>Unifi barely survived the great textile offshoring of the late 1990s and early 2000s, mostly by shrinking and laying off large swaths of its workforce, buying and setting up plants in China and South America, and specializing in premium recycled polyester in its North Carolina plant. At the beginning of February, Unifi announced it would <a href="https://www.ecotextile.com/2024020531653/materials-production-news/unifi-begins-cost-cutting-to-boost-finances.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cut costs to shore up its finances</a>. Adding a high-price treatment unit might be too much for it to bear. (Unifi said its spokesperson on this topic was not available for comment.)</p><p>Belliveau of <a href="https://defendourhealth.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Defend Our Health</a> said he would be happy to see PET and polyester go away. But that’s a far-off vision for such a popular material. “EPA is not known for its radical vision, so I doubt they’re going to call for the shut-down of PET polyester in the U.S.,” he told me. “They might say that we need to adopt a drinking water standard or put better control in plants for workers.”</p><p>“Often there is a multi-year phase-out period,” Kalmuss-Katz said. “There is time to respond to innovate and to develop safer alternatives and to get those out into use.” Some of those alternatives could be polyester recycling technologies. France-based <a href="https://www.carbios.com/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Carbios</a> and California-based <a href="https://www.ambercycle.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ambercycle</a>, both startups working on textile-to-textile polyester recycling, say their processes don’t produce 1,4-dioxane. A representative for <a href="https://circ.earth/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Circ</a>, a Virginia-based textile recycling startup, would only say that it, “is adhering to all local and federal regulations to ensure its process is in line with the highest regulatory standards for safe chemistry… this is something the team will be following closely as data becomes more available.” </p><p>Polyester has become a core part of almost everyone’s wardrobe, used for its high performance, versatility, and affordability. More importantly for the Carolinas, it provides some of the few remaining jobs in a formerly vibrant textile center. To that, Kalmuss-Katz said, “Congress made pretty clear that the price of producing polyester cannot be fenceline communities are left with disproportionate and unreasonable cancer burdens.”</p><p>Still, even if the EPA’s decision is the final nail in the coffin of the PET and polyester industry in the U.S., it doesn’t really solve the problem, or rather, not for everyone. Like other industries before it — leather tanning, rayon manufacturing, dye houses and dye manufacturing — it will continue to exist in its dirtiest form in other, less regulated countries. If the United States’ past history of offshoring turns out to be prologue, most consumers probably won’t notice the difference, except perhaps in slightly cheaper prices. Fashion companies will certainly notice, but are incentivized to look the other way. </p><p>For a few people paying attention, polyester will simply join a long list of products — chocolate, electronics, cheap meat — that come with a niggling feeling in the back of our minds: this has probably harmed someone on its way to me. </p>

## James Biden Tells Lawmakers Joe Biden Had No Involvement in Family’s Business Dealings

date: 2024-02-21, from: VOA News USA

Washington — James Biden told congressional investigators that his brother, President Joe Biden, "never had any involvement" in the family's business dealings as James Biden appeared for a private interview Wednesday on Capitol Hill as part of House Republicans' impeachment inquiry.


"I have had a 50-year career in a variety of business ventures. Joe Biden has never had any involvement or any direct or indirect financial interest in those activities," the younger Biden said in an opening statement obtained by The Associated Press. "None."


The interview with James Biden is the latest in a series that Republican lawmakers have conducted recently as they seek to rebuild momentum for an impeachment process surrounding the Biden family's overseas finances that has stalled in recent months.


Criticism over the lack of evidence directly related to the president has grown even among those in the Republican Party who have thrown cold water on allegations that Biden was directly involved in his family members' supposed efforts to leverage the last name into corporate paydays domestically and abroad.


The Republican investigation was undercut again last week when an FBI informant who claimed there was a multimillion-dollar bribery scheme involving the president, his son Hunter, and a Ukrainian energy company was charged with fabricating the story.


The informant's claims had been central to the Republican effort in Congress to investigate the president and his family. An attorney for Hunter Biden, who is expected to give a deposition next week, said the charges show the probe is "based on dishonest, uncredible allegations and witnesses."


Both James and Hunter Biden were subpoenaed by the committee in November. Lawyers for James Biden have said that there was no justification for the subpoena because the committee had already reviewed private bank records and transactions between the two brothers. The committee found records of two loans that were made when Joe Biden was not in office or a candidate for president.


"With my appearance here today, the committees will have the information to conclude that the negative and destructive assumptions about me and my relationship with my brother Joe are wrong," James Biden said in his. "There is no basis for this inquiry to continue."


But Republicans have pushed back on the Biden family's defense, saying the evidence they have gathered since early last year paints a troubling picture of "influence peddling" in the family's business dealings, particularly with international clients.

## US Ambassador Meets With Gabon Coup Leader

date: 2024-02-21, from: VOA News USA

YAOUNDE, CAMEROON — A U.S. delegation met with the military ruler of Gabon on Tuesday and reiterated the need for a quick return to constitutional order six months after the nation’s August 30 coup.


Even so, the U.S. ambassador to Gabon who led the delegation, Vernelle Trim FitzPatrick, said economic and diplomatic relations with the Central African state will be reinforced despite sanctions imposed on Gabon's coup leaders.


Military ruler General Brice Clotaire Oligui Nguema pleaded for U.S sanctions to be lifted.


Speaking later on Gabon’s state television, FitzPatrick said the United States finds it important to discuss strengthening trade and commercial relations with Gabon to gain the support of the U.S Congress in fostering ties with the nation.


FitzPatrick, who has been ambassador to Gabon for about a month, also said the United States will assist with the transition to civilian rule but did not say how.


Gabon's military, led by Nguema, ousted President Ali Bongo Ondimba in a bloodless coup on August 30. The military accused Bongo of rigging Gabon's August 26 elections and ruining the country’s economy.


After the coup, Washington suspended most nonhumanitarian aid and asked for a quick return to constitutional order. Gabon's military leaders said elections would be held in August 2025, after an inclusive national dialogue this April.


Nembe Patrice, an economic adviser at Alternance 2023, a group of opposition parties created in 2023 to fight for political change in Gabon, said civilians want Nguema to organize elections and hand power to democratically elected officials.


He also said he hopes the United States will advise Nguema not to be a candidate.

## Water cooling is overkill for Pi 5

date: 2024-02-21, from: Jeff Geerling blog

<span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Water cooling is overkill for Pi 5</span>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p><strong>tl;dr</strong>: 52Pi and Seeed Studio's water cooling solution for the Raspberry Pi 5 can be fun, and works better than any other solution—but at a <em>steep</em> price, and with a number of annoying quirks.</p>

<p><img class="insert-image" width="700" height="auto" alt="Ice Pump water cooling block installed on Raspberry Pi 5" src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/ice-pump-installed-pi-5-hero.jpg"></p>

<p>A few months ago, 52Pi reached out and asked if they could send a new water cooling kit they were working on for the Raspberry Pi 5. At the time, the hope was we could figure out a way to get very high overclock with adequate cooling.</p>

<p>Unfortunately—for reasons I'll explore more soon—the Pi 5 can't overclock beyond 3.0 GHz (it's not physically possible). Some of why is explained in my blog post <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2023/overclocking-and-underclocking-raspberry-pi-5">Overclocking and <em>Underclocking</em> the Raspberry Pi 5</a>.</p>

<p>But water cooling is still fun, and the product is in production now, so I figured I'd still give it a fair shot, and see if I thought it might be worth buying for certain niche use cases.</p></div>

## Blinken Meets with Brazil's President Ahead of G20 Talks

date: 2024-02-21, from: VOA News USA

Brasilia, Brazil — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met in Brazil Wednesday with President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva ahead of talks with his counterparts from the Group of 20. 


“The United States and Brazil are doing so many important things together, we're working together bilaterally, regionally, globally. It's a very important partnership,” Blinken said after the meeting in Brasilia.


The secretary of state then left for Rio de Janeiro, where the G20 ministerial meetings are taking place.  Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov will be in attendance so there’s potential for a rare face-to-face interaction between the two.


Blinken also plans to discuss the Multinational Security Support Mission in Haiti with G20 partners on the sidelines of the meetings, addressing the Haitian people’s call for help to restore security and stability. 




No G20 joint statement expected on Gaza, Ukraine 


The G20, comprising 19 countries including the G7, the European Union and the African Union, represents about 85% of global GDP, 75% of global trade and two-thirds of the global population. 


The G7 comprises the world's richest and most powerful countries. 


Last week, G7 foreign ministers expressed outrage over the detention death of Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny and pledged unwavering support to Ukraine as the two-year mark of Russia’s invasion approaches. 


The G7 foreign ministers’ joint statement also advocated for “prolonged and durable pauses in the hostilities leading to a sustainable cease-fire” in Gaza while expressing “deep concern” over the “devastating” impact of Israel’s planned military operations in Rafah, where more than a million civilians are taking refuge. 


Ramin Toloui, assistant secretary of state for economic and business affairs, said the U.S. will underscore the damage caused by the “Kremlin’s war of aggression” and “encourage all G20 partners to redouble their calls for a just, peaceful and lasting end” to the war on Ukraine. 


But Toloui said Brazil would not “attempt to mobilize a joint statement” during the upcoming G20 foreign ministers’ meetings. 


Distinct foreign relations 


From Brazil, Blinken will travel to Buenos Aires to meet with the newly inaugurated Argentine President Javier Milei to discuss bilateral and global issues. 


Argentina boasts one of the largest Jewish populations in South America. Following Milei's recent visit to Israel, a senior U.S. official said Blinken will engage in discussions with Milei regarding “the way forward between Israel and Gaza.” Other topics high on the agenda include critical minerals and sustainable economic growth. 




Blinken's diplomatic missions to Argentina and Brazil will navigate the countries' distinct foreign relations concerning various countries and issues, such as Russia, Gaza and China. 


Lula initially assured Russia that President Vladimir Putin, who faces an International Criminal Court arrest warrant, would not be arrested if he attended the G20 summit in November in Brazil. However, he later amended his stance, indicating that the decision would ultimately be in the hands of Brazil's judiciary. 


During his visit to Cairo, Feb. 14 and 15, Lula strongly criticized Israel's military actions in Gaza, advocating for a "definitive cease-fire." He announced Brazil's new contribution to the United Nations’ Palestinian refugee agency, or UNRWA, and supported Palestine's recognition as a sovereign state with full U.N. membership. 


Lula wrote on the social media platform X, “While Hamas militants' attack on October 7 against Israeli civilians is indefensible and deserved strong condemnation from Brazil, Israel's disproportionate and indiscriminate response is unacceptable." 


In contrast, during his visit to Israel in early February, Milei, a pro-Israel far-right leader, announced his intention to relocate Argentina's embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a move previously made by only the United States and a few other countries. 


Milei also announced his government's intention to classify Hamas as a terrorist organization. 


This visit marked his first bilateral trip since his inauguration in December. 


Following his meeting with Blinken on Friday, Milei plans to visit Washington and speak at the Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, on Feb. 24, a gathering expected to be filled with supporters of former U.S. President Donald Trump. 

 

BRICS and China 


In 2025, Brazil will lead the BRICS group (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) of emerging nations, in which China is a key player. During a state visit to Beijing last year, Lula called for BRICS countries to trade in their own currencies and end the U.S. dollar’s trade dominance. Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates officially joined the bloc on Jan. 1. 


Last month, Lula held talks with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in which the two pledged to strengthen a comprehensive strategic partnership between the two countries. 


In comparison, Milei has turned down an offer to join BRICS. During his presidential campaign, he said he would freeze relations with China. 


Milei also chose to acquire secondhand American F-16 fighters from Denmark, favoring them over new Chinese JF-17 fighter aircraft. 


“The United States is the largest source of foreign direct investment in Brazil, and we have a robust presence of U.S. companies in Brazil, as well as in Argentina, and we’re looking forward to deepening our economic ties between both of them,” Brian Nichols, the assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs, told VOA in a recent phone briefing. 


Nichols emphasized the importance of countries trading freely while understanding the trade-offs involved. 


“The United States is offering up a comprehensive and powerful alternative to those who may not necessarily have others’ best interests at heart,” he said.

## The SunOS JDK builder

date: 2024-02-21, from: OS News

This is the (work in progress) SunOS jdk builder. The aim is to attempt to download, patch, and build any relevant jdk tag, and do so for SPARC and x86, and for illumos and Solaris 11.4. It has currently been spot-tested on current illumos/x86 (specifically Tribblix m32). It is dependent on the jdk-sunos-patches repository, which holds all the patches for each tag. ↫ Peter Tribble Built by Peter Tribble, the same person behind Tribblix, and he&#8217;s published a blog post with more details about this project. I&#8217;ve definitely been seeing an uptick recently in interest in Solaris, which is great to see. It&#8217;s gotten me interested in installing Tribblix on my dual-Xeon workstation to see just how much I&#8217;ve been missing since last using Solaris like 15-20 years ago.

## UK Court Concludes Two-Day Hearing Over New Assange Extradition Appeal

date: 2024-02-21, from: VOA News USA

LONDON — Britain's High Court on Wednesday finished hearing two days of arguments over whether to grant WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange a fresh appeal against his extradition to the United States to face espionage charges.


Two senior judges heard evidence from his lawyers and those representing Washington, and opted against making an immediate decision on what is likely Assange's final UK bid to block extradition.


"We will reserve our decision," judge Victoria Sharp said as the latest legal proceedings in the long-running case concluded. It is unclear when she and judge Jeremy Johnson will issue their ruling.


Washington indicted Assange, the Australian founder of WikiLeaks, multiple times between 2018 and 2020 over its publication of hundreds of thousands of secret military and diplomatic files on the U.S.-led wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.


Assange has since waged a half-decade battle against being sent there, but has lost successive rulings in recent years. If he fails again, he could be extradited within weeks.


Lawyers for the U.S. government urged the court to reject his arguments on various grounds.


Clair Dobbin said that Assange had "solicited" the secret U.S. files and, in eventually publishing them "indiscriminately" without redactions, that his actions were "unprecedented" and did not constitute journalism.


"The evidence shows that from the time the appellant started WikiLeaks... he sought to recruit individuals with access to classified information," Dobbin added. "He worked with hackers."


In response, one of Assange's lawyers, Mark Summers, hit out at Dobbin's testimony for failing to address that he was exposing "state-level crimes."


"We heard no answer at all," he said, adding "that is protected conduct" under UK law. 


Assange was absent from court for the two-day session, and did not follow the proceedings via video due to illness, his lawyer said. 


Dozens of his supporters massed outside on both days, demanding that the judges halt his extradition. 




His lawyers said Tuesday that the US charges were "political" and that he was being prosecuted "for engaging in ordinary journalistic practice of obtaining and publishing classified information."


Assange's lawyers also argued that the decades-long prison sentence he faces was "disproportionate," accusing Washington of acting in "bad faith" and contravening its extradition treaty with Britain. 


U.S. President Joe Biden has faced domestic and international pressure to drop the 18-count indictment against Assange in a Virginia federal court, filed under his predecessor Donald Trump. 


Major media organizations, press freedom advocates and the Australian parliament have all denounced the prosecution under the 1917 Espionage Act, which has never been used over the publishing of classified information. 


"We call again on the Biden administration to find a political solution to bring this case to a close," Reporters Without Borders said Wednesday, adding that Assange "cannot get a fair trial" in the United States.


But in court, Dobbin noted the prosecution had continued under two different presidential administrations because "it is based on law and evidence, not political inspiration."


It had "profound consequences" for both the U.S. and those whose names were disclosed, she added.


If the High Court rules against Assange, he will have exhausted his UK legal options.


His wife Stella Assange has said he would then ask the European Court of Human Rights to temporarily halt the extradition.




This would need to happen within 14 days of losing the appeal bid, his lawyers say.


The couple, who have two children together, met while Assange was holed up in Ecuador's London embassy for seven years from 2011. 

 

He had fled there to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he faced accusations of sexual assault that were later dropped.


He was arrested by UK police in 2019.


A UK district judge previously blocked his extradition on the grounds he would likely kill himself in US custody.


But the High Court reversed the decision on appeal in 2021 after Washington vowed not to imprison him in its most extreme prison, "ADX Florence."


It also pledged not to subject him to the harsh regime known as Special Administrative Measures and eventually allow him to be transferred to Australia. 


In March 2022, the UK's Supreme Court refused permission to appeal there, arguing that Assange had failed to "raise an arguable point of law."


Months later, the interior minister at the time, Priti Patel, formally signed off on his extradition.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-02-21, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2019/12/23/you.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Consider this quote from a <a href="https://wapo.st/48uLvKF">WP article</a> about a court ruling on abortion in Alabama. “Women who actually know what happened, feel under attack and almost powerless.” When historians look back on this election, they will be amazed that all the attention wasn't focused on reproductive rights, esp when 1. It mattered so much to virtually every American, in very real non-abstract ways, and 2. There was such a dramatic difference between the two parties and candidates on this issue. I think I understand why journalism can't get there. Because they would have to turn the agenda over to the people, and give up a power they have and enjoy, even if that power has repeatedly sent us wildly in the wrong direction, focusing on things that don't matter as much as the gut-wrenching decision Americans have to make this year. Do we want to let Republicans enslave women, 1/2 half the populace, or do we want to return to the way things were before Dobbs. I don't have to explain. Very few people on the fence here. What we need are people directly affected by this situation, women of childbearing age, and let them speak, over and over, every day, about all the ways their lives are turned upside down by the direction the Repubs are taking us. No longer <i>trying</i> to take us. There isn't much to argue about here, it's fairly black and white and it is a real division, not one of the bullshit devisions the Repubs have been able to trick the journalists to focus on.

## Can Nostalgia Help Sell EVs?

New report finds the IRA is starting to work, but not exactly as expected </h3><p><strong></strong>A year and a half ago, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act, which will spend an estimated $500 billion in grants and tax credits to incentivize people and businesses to switch from burning fossil fuels to using cleaner, zero-carbon technologies. Is it working? In the third episode of <em>Heatmap</em>’s podcast “Shift Key,” hosts Robinson Meyer and Jesse Jenkins dive into a <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=30fe0bd4fa&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new report</a> from a coalition of major energy analysts — including MIT, the Rhodium Group, and Jenkins’ lab at Princeton — that looks at data from the power and transportation sectors and concludes that yes, the law is starting to decarbonize the American economy. But it isn’t working in the way many people might expect. While the transportation sector came in at the upper end of what modelers projected for this year, the power sector is lagging behind largely because of a drop in new onshore wind projects. As a result, the power sector is not on track to cut emissions 40% by 2030, as compared to 2005 levels, as the bill’s supporters have hoped.<br/><br/>“Unfortunately, we're just not building out at the pace that would be economically justified,” Jenkins told Meyer. “And that is really an indicator that there are a substantial number of other non-economic frictions or barriers to deployment of wind in particular at the pace that we want to see.”<br/><br/>Subscribe to “Shift Key” and find the episode on <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=1eabb451e4&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Apple Podcasts</a>, or wherever you get your podcasts.</p><h3>2. Volkswagen hopes nostalgia will boost its U.S. EV sales</h3><p><strong></strong>Volkswagen wants to double its market share in the United States by 2030, and it’s hoping a little bit of nostalgia will help do the trick, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=e5fca97499&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">according to</a> <em>The New York Times.</em> The German company is reviving the iconic Scout brand with a line of electric pickups and sport utility vehicles, and leaning hard on its electric ID.Buzz, which resembles the Microbus – aka the Hippie Van. And Pablo Di Si, president of Volkswagen Group of America, hinted at an EV Beetle revival. Last week the company inaugurated a new factory site in South Carolina where the electric Scout vehicles will be built. “This market is turning electric, and everybody’s starting from scratch,” Arno Antlitz, the chief financial officer of Volkswagen, told the <em>Times</em>. “This is our unique opportunity to grow.” The paper notes that Volkswagen has been trying since the 1970s to grow in the U.S., with little success. The first electric Scouts will go on sale in 2026.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

Biden administration announces $500 million for wildfire prevention</h3><p><strong></strong>The Biden administration is <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=ea88630967&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">putting $500 million</a> toward wildfire prevention in 21 areas that the Agriculture Department has identified as being high risk. Those include forests like Mt. Hood National Forest in Oregon, but also 4 million acres in southern California. The money comes from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), and the U.S. Forest Service’s Collaborative Wildfire Risk Reduction Program. The total IRA and BIL funding for wildfire resilience sits at $2.4 billion, <em>The Hill </em><a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=88213e93e0&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>. More than 2.6 million acres were <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=ff5bde67af&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">burned</a> in wildfires last year.</p><h3>4. Chemical tanker with ‘sails’ embarks on first journey</h3><p><strong></strong>The first chemical tanker to be retrofitted with wind “sails” has <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=f37c5348e1&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">set out</a> on its first wind-assisted voyage. The MT Chemical Challenger left Antwerp on Friday, headed for Istanbul. Along its journey the ship will test out four newly installed giant aluminum sails that are meant to help reduce fuel consumption by up to 20%. Last year Cargill put “WindWings” made by BAR Technologies on one of its cargo ships, so the Chemical Challenger isn’t breaking entirely new ground, but the project does represent growing interest within the shipping industry to reduce carbon emissions. The International Maritime Organization last year said shipping emissions must drop by at least 40% by 2030, and be eliminated by around 2050, to be in line with Paris Agreement targets. But there are no legally binding measures to implement these guidelines. International shipping accounted for about 2% of global energy-related CO2 emissions in 2022, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=727acedbfd&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to</a> the International Energy Agency. </p><h3>5. EU considering carbon removal certification rules</h3><p><strong></strong>The European Union is <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=ca6e3c0d5d&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">considering</a> implementing a carbon removals certification process that could help legitimize and police an industry that’s still nascent, but growing fast. Companies claiming to remove planet-warming CO2 from the atmosphere have so far been left to police themselves, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=7e496e55bf&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote Justine Calma</a> at <em>The Verge</em>. “Lax rules — or no rules at all — could give companies a way to keep polluting while misleadingly promising to draw down those emissions later.” The EU’s proposed framework sets definitions for “permanent” removal vs. “temporary” carbon storage, and identifies different methods like wood-based construction, forest restoration, soil management, and others. It does not include “activities that do not result in carbon removals or soil emission reductions,” such as “avoided” deforestation or renewable energy products. To be certified in the eyes of the EU, projects will need to be quantifiable, long term, sustainable, and must capture carbon that would have otherwise been released into the atmosphere. The framework has been approved by the European Parliament and the Council and Commission – it now needs formal government adoption. “If adopted, the certification process would be voluntary for carbon removal companies,” Calma explained. “But only certified projects would count toward a country’s progress in meeting the European Union’s climate goals.”</p><h2>THE KICKER</h2><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

## Israeli Airstrikes Hit Northern, Southern Gaza

date: 2024-02-21, from: VOA News USA

United Nations — The Israeli military said Wednesday it carried out airstrikes in northern and southern Gaza, a day after the United States vetoed a U.N. Security Council resolution that called for an immediate humanitarian cease-fire, scaled up aid access and rejected the forced displacement of Palestinians.


The Israel Defense Forces reported killing dozens of militants, including in the Khan Younis area of the southern part of the Gaza Strip.


The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said Wednesday it recorded 118 deaths during the past day, pushing the total number of Palestinians killed to 29,313 with another 69,333 injured since the war began in October.




“Demanding an immediate, unconditional cease-fire without an agreement requiring Hamas to release the hostages will not bring about a durable peace,” said U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield of the Algerian-drafted resolution.


For weeks, the United States, Egypt, Qatar and Israel have been involved in delicate negotiations aimed at the release of all hostages and an extended pause in the fighting.


“Instead, it could extend the fighting between Hamas and Israel, extend the hostages’ time in captivity, an experience described by former hostages as 'hell,' and extend the dire humanitarian crisis Palestinians are facing in Gaza,” Thomas-Greenfield said, adding “none of us want that.”


Algeria first presented the 15-member Security Council with its text three weeks ago and delayed a vote to give those negotiations time. But the country’s Ambassador Amar Bendjama said silence is no longer an option and it is time for the council to act.




“We are rapidly approaching a critical juncture where the call to halt the machinery of violence will lose its significance,” he said of Israel’s impending incursion on the southern city of Rafah, where 1.5 million Palestinians are sheltering.


“Today, every Palestinian is a target for death, extermination and genocide,” he said. “We should ask ourselves; how many innocent lives must be sacrificed before the council deems it necessary to call for a cease-fire?”


The Algerian text had strong council support – 13 members voted for it, Britain abstained, and the U.S. cast its veto. It is the third time Washington has used its council veto to block a cease-fire measure.


“The call for a cease-fire should have been agreed to a long time ago,” Palestinian envoy Riyad Mansour said. “What fresh hell needs to be crossed for this council to finally demand a cease-fire?”


Israel’s envoy called the idea of a cease-fire “absurd” and not a magic solution.


“So why is the council charged with security so fixated on aiding these monsters staying in power?” Ambassador Gilad Erdan asked, warning Hamas would attack Israel again given the chance.


Erdan urged the council as a whole to condemn the Hamas terror attack of Oct. 7, which it has so far not done. Several council members said in their remarks that the council should take this step.


US counter-proposal


The United States is proposing its own draft resolution, which several diplomats said had not yet been officially circulated at the council.


Seen by VOA, it calls for a temporary cease-fire “as soon as practicable” and based on a formula of all hostages being released. It also notes the “urgent need for a viable plan” to protect civilians from an Israeli offensive in Rafah.


The U.S. proposal “underscores that such a major ground offensive should not proceed under current circumstances” and “rejects any other effort at forced displacement of the civilian population in Gaza.”  


“Colleagues, this is not, as some members have claimed, an American effort to cover for an imminent ground incursion,” Thomas-Greenfield said of the U.S. text. “Rather, it is a sincere statement of our concern for the 1.5 million civilians who have sought refuge in Rafah.”




Thomas-Greenfield told reporters that the United States would work with other council members in good faith to get the resolution “over the finish line.”


Israel has warned it plans to carry out an offensive in Rafah, the area of southern Gaza along the Egyptian border. Israeli officials say the operation is necessary to target Hamas members there. The officials have also mentioned evacuations of civilians without providing any detailed plans. 


United Nations officials have repeatedly said no place is safe for civilians to go in Gaza.


Egypt objects to the evacuation of Palestinians into its territory, saying it would amount to their forced displacement. Israel denies that is its intention.


The World Food Program said it is pausing deliveries in northern Gaza, until safe conditions are in place for distribution. About 300,000 people are believed to still be living in the north, in dire conditions including looming famine.


WFP said it resumed deliveries Sunday after a three-week suspension after an aid truck was hit in an air strike. But chaotic situations with crowds climbing aboard their trucks, looting and violence, including gunfire, had impeded food distribution and made it unsafe.


Israel began its military campaign to eliminate Hamas after the group’s fighters crossed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people according to Israeli officials and taking about 250 others hostage. Hamas, designated a terror group by the U.S., the U.K. and EU, is believed to still be holding about 130 hostages in Gaza, including 30 who are believed to be dead.

## Is Biden’s Climate Law Actually Working?

date: 2024-02-21, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTUxNTM2NS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2Nzk1NTg1M30.9o7bwScZUHyNXfrAviTrji8SIJDqRDb3gTkbxO-E7ao/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">
	A year and a half ago, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act, the biggest climate law in American history — and arguably in world history. The law will spend an estimated $500 billion in grants and tax credits to incentivize people and businesses to switch from burning fossil fuels to using cleaner, zero-carbon technologies.
	<br/>
</p><p>
	That’s the goal, at least. But is the IRA actually working? Now, 18 months after its passage, we’re starting to be able to answer that question. 
	<a href="http://www.cleaninvestmentmonitor.org/reports/clean-electricity-and-transport-2023" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">A new report</a> from a coalition of major energy analysts — including MIT, the Rhodium Group, and our cohost Jesse Jenkins’ lab at Princeton — looks at data from the power and transportation sectors and concludes that yes, the law is starting to decarbonize the American economy.
</p><p>
But it isn’t working in the way many people might expect, because while electric vehicles are on track to meet the IRA’s climate goals, the power sector is not.
</p><p>
	That’s the opposite of what you might think from reading the popular press, which has bemoaned 
	<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/are-ev-sales-really-slowing-data" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_self">an alleged slowdown in new EV sales</a>. But the new report finds that the transportation sector actually came in at the upper end of what modelers expected to see this year. About 9.2% of new cars sold last year in the United States were zero-emissions vehicles; after the IRA passed, modelers had expected EVs to come in anywhere from 8.1 to 9.4% of sales.
</p><p>
	But the power sector is lagging behind what modelers had expected to see. While the three groups had projected that 46 to 79 gigawatts of new zero-carbon power would come online last year, only 32.3 gigawatts of new capacity actually did. That is primarily due to a drop in new onshore wind projects, which fell below the installation levels achieved in 2020 and 2021. While solar and batteries continued to go gangbusters, exceeding previous records, they could not make up for the drop in wind. That means that the power sector 
	<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/solar-and-battery-storage-2024" target="_self">is not on track to cut emissions 40% by 2030</a>, as compared to 2005 levels, as the bill’s supporters have hoped.

</iframe></center><p>Here is an excerpt from our conversation:</p><blockquote><strong>Robinson Meyer: </strong>First, let's do the moment of truth. Let’s just first get into the data. So in the power sector, what do we see?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Jesse Jenkins:</strong> What we see in the electricity sector is a new record set for zero carbon electricity generation and storage capacity additions. So that's new power plant and battery storage construction.<br/>
<br/>
	In aggregate, we saw over 32,000 megawatts or 32 gigawatts of new zero carbon generation and storage added to the U.S. grid in 2023. That's about a 32% increase from the rate in 2022. And it edges out a previous record that we saw in 2021 of about 31.6 gigawatts. So good news is we're setting new record growth rates in total in terms of wind and solar and battery additions.<br/>
<br/>
	Unfortunately, that does fall on the lower end of what we were projecting in most of the modeling results. We were looking for, on average, about 46 to 79 gigawatts, so call it 40 to 80 gigawatts on average of additions in 2023 and 2024. We fell short of the low end of that range at 32.3 gigawatts. So unless the pace accelerates substantially in 2024, we're probably going to fall a bit behind schedule in terms of capacity additions.<br/>
<br/><strong>Meyer</strong>: And do we have a sense of what's driving that? Because I think that's a very surprising finding, that we're behind schedule in the power sector, where I think people feel pretty good generally about the pace of decarbonization. Or I think where the common wisdom, at least, is that the pace of decarbonization is like proceeding apace. What's driving this underperformance of the model?<br/>
<br/><strong>Jenkins</strong>: So it's really the difference between solar and wind additions.
<br/>
<br/>The solar sector added about 18.4 gigawatts of capacity in 2023. That's up massively from just about 11 gigawatts in 2022. It's about double what we had seen in 2020, which was kind of our reference when we were doing our modeling as we started the REPEAT project in 2021. And so that's looking encouraging and in fact is running ahead of schedule with the average pace of additions that we saw in REPEAT project results.
<br/>
	Batteries are growing way faster than we expected. <br/><br/>And that helps really make the most of those solar capacity additions because solar and batteries are kind of like peanut butter and jelly, they go together quite well. And that's because solar has this nice, regular daily fluctuation, right? From the sun rising and setting. And that pairs really well with batteries, which today in a way lithium ion batteries are best suited for, you know, only a few hours of storage. So they'll charge for three or four hours in the middle of the day when we've got an abundance of sun. And then they'll discharge in the evening to help meet the evening peak of demand when everybody's coming home from work.<br/>
<br/>
	The batteries basically helped shift the solar output from the middle of the day to hit that evening peak. And that's, that's really helpful. Where things are running behind schedule is really in the wind sector, where we only built about half of the peak rate, actually less than half that we've seen historically in 2023. Additions of wind power in 2023 were only about 6.3 gigawatts, and that's down from nearly 15 gigawatts in each of 2020 and 2021.<br/>
<br/>
	So that's a step backwards at a time when we should be smashing new record growth rates across all of these sectors. And that's giving me the biggest concern as we look at in the next couple of years.
<br/><strong><br/>Meyer</strong>: And that's, I mean, last show we talked about offshore wind and the troubles in offshore wind and how it seems like some big offshore wind projects that we thought might be coming online in the middle of this decade might not be coming online till the end of the decade. But when we talk about wind underperforming in terms of the whole country over the past year, we're really still talking about onshore wind. This is like big turbines in the middle of the Great Plains, not big turbines off the coast of New York, New Jersey, right?
<br/><strong><br/>Jenkins</strong>: That's right. Yeah, I think I don't think we had any significant offshore wind capacity additions coming in 2024. You know, most of that we were expecting would come in between 2026 and 2030 or 2035. So this is really a story about onshore wind, where if we look at the economics of onshore wind across the country, there's a tremendous number of sites that look very economic given the incentives provided by the Inflation Reduction Act. <br/><br/>And unfortunately, we're just not building out at the pace that would be economically justified. And that is really an indicator that there are a substantial number of other non-economic frictions or barriers to deployment of wind in particular at the pace that we want to see.</blockquote><div class="horizontal-rule"></div><p>

## Pluralistic: Google reneged on the monopolistic bargain; The Bezzle excerpt (Part IV) (21 Feb 2024)

date: 2024-02-21, from: Cory Doctorow's blog

Today's links Google reneged on the monopolistic bargain: A search monopolist should never do a layoff, buyback or dividend for so long as it's enshittifying. The Bezzle excerpt (Part IV): LA Sheriff's Deputies are the most violent gangs in LA. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2009, 2014, 2019, 2023 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading Google reneged on the monopolistic bargain (permalink) A funny thing happened on the way to the enshittocene: Google &#8211; which astonished the world when it reinvented search, blowing Altavista and Yahoo out of the water with a search tool that seemed magic &#8211; suddenly turned into a pile of shit. Google's search results are terrible. The top of the page is dominated by spam, scams, and ads. A surprising number of those ads are scams. Sometimes, these are high-stakes scams played out by well-resourced adversaries who stand to make a fortune by tricking Google: https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/phone-numbers-airlines-listed-google-directed-scammers-rcna94766 But often these scams are perpetrated by petty grifters who are making a couple bucks at this. These aren't hyper-resourced, sophisticated attackers. They're the SEO equivalent of script kiddies, and they're running circles around Google: https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/24/passive-income/#swiss-cheese-security Google search is empirically worsening. The SEO industry spends every hour that god sends trying to figure out how to sleaze their way to the top of the search results, and even if Google defeats 99% of these attempts, the 1% that squeak through end up dominating the results page for any consequential query: https://downloads.webis.de/publications/papers/bevendorff_2024a.pdf Google insists that this isn't true, and if it is true, it's not their fault because the bad guys out there are so numerous, dedicated and inventive that Google can't help but be overwhelmed by them: https://searchengineland.com/is-google-search-getting-worse-389658 It wasn't supposed to be this way. Google has long maintained that its scale is the only thing that keeps us safe from the scammers and spammers who would otherwise overwhelm any lesser-resourced defender. That's why it was so imperative that they pursue such aggressive growth, buying up hundreds of companies and integrating their products with search so that every mobile device, every ad, every video, every website, had one of Google's tendrils in it. This is the argument that Google's defenders have put forward in their messaging on the long-overdue antitrust case against Google, where we learned that Google is spending $26b/year to make sure you never try another search engine: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-27/google-paid-26-3-billion-to-be-default-search-engine-in-2021 Google, we were told, had achieved such intense scale that the normal laws of commercial and technological physics no longer applied. Take security: it's an iron law that "there is no security in obscurity." A system that is only secure when its adversaries don't understand how it works is not a secure system. As Bruce Schneier says, "anyone can design a security system that they themselves can't break. That doesn't mean it works &#8211; just that it works for people stupider than them." And yet, Google operates one of the world's most consequential security system &#8211; The Algorithm (TM) &#8211; in total secrecy. We're not allowed to know how Google's ranking system works, what its criteria are, or even when it changes: "If we told you that, the spammers would win." Well, they kept it a secret, and the spammers won anyway. A viral post by Housefresh &#8211; who review air purifiers &#8211; describes how Google's algorithmic failures, which send the worst sites to the top of the heap, have made it impossible for high-quality review sites to compete: https://housefresh.com/david-vs-digital-goliaths/ You've doubtless encountered these bad review sites. Search for "Best ______ 2024" and the results are a series of near-identical lists, strewn with Amazon affiliate links. Google has endlessly tinkered with its guidelines and algorithmic weights for review sites, and none of it has made a difference. For example, when Google instituted a policy that reviewers should "discuss the benefits and drawbacks of something, based on your own original research," sites that had previously regurgitated the same lists of the same top ten Amazon bestsellers "peppered their pages with references to a ‘rigorous testing process,’ their ‘lab team,’ subject matter experts ‘they collaborated with,’ and complicated methodologies that seem impressive at a cursory look." But these grandiose claims &#8211; like the 67 air purifiers supposedly tested in Better Homes and Gardens's Des Moines lab &#8211; result in zero in-depth reviews and no published data. Moreover, these claims to rigorous testing materialized within a few days of Google changing its search ranking and said that high rankings would be reserved for sites that did testing. Most damning of all is how the Better Homes and Gardens top air purifiers perform in comparison to the &#8211; extensively documented &#8211; tests performed by Housefresh: "plagued by high-priced and underperforming units, Amazon bestsellers with dubious origins (that also underperform), and even subpar devices from companies that market their products with phrases like ‘the Tesla of air purifiers.’" One of the top ranked items on BH&#38;G comes from Molekule, a company that filed for bankruptcy after being sued for false advertising. The model BH&#38;G chose was ranked "the worst air purifier tested" by Wirecutter and "not living up to the hype" by Consumer Reports. Either BH&#38;G's rigorous testing process is a fiction that they infused their site with in response to a Google policy change, or BH&#38;G absolutely sucks at rigorous testing. BH&#38;G's competitors commit the same sins &#8211; literally, the exact same sins. Real Simple's reviews list the same photographer and the photos seem to have been taken in the same place. They also list the same person as their "expert." Real Simple has the same corporate parent as BH&#38;G: Dotdash Meredith. As Housefresh shows, there's a lot of Dotdash Meredith review photos that seem to have been taken in the same place, by the same person. But the competitors of these magazines are no better. Buzzfeed lists 22 air purifiers, including that crapgadget from Molekule. Their "methodology" is to include screenshots of Amazon reviews. A lot of the top ranked sites for air purifiers are once-great magazines that have been bought and enshittified by private equity giants, like Popular Science, which began as a magazine in 1872 and became a shambling zombie in 2023, after its PE owners North Equity LLC decided its googlejuice was worth more than its integrity and turned it into a metastatic chumbox of shitty affiliate-link SEO-bait. As Housefresh points out, the marketing team that runs PopSci makes a lot of hay out of the 150 years of trust that went into the magazine, but the actual reviews are thin anaecdotes, unbacked by even the pretense of empiricism (oh, and they loooove Molekule). Some of the biggest, most powerful, most trusted publications in the world have a side-hustle in quietly producing SEO-friendly "10 Best ___________ of 2024" lists: Rolling Stone, Forbes, US News and Report, CNN, New York Magazine, CNET, Tom's Guide, and more. Google literally has one job: to detect this kind of thing and crush it. The deal we made with Google was, "You monopolize search and use your monopoly rents to ensure that we never, ever try another search engine. In return, you will somehow distinguish between low-effort, useless nonsense and good information. You promised us that if you got to be the unelected, permanent overlord of all information access, you would 'organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.'" They broke the deal. Companies like CNET used to do real, rigorous product reviews. As Housefresh points out, CNET once bought an entire smart home and used it to test products. Then Red Ventures bought CNET and bet that they could sell the house, switch to vibes-based reviewing, and that Google wouldn't even notice. They were right. https://www.cnet.com/home/smart-home/welcome-to-the-cnet-smart-home/ Google downranks sites that spend money and time on reviews like Housefresh and GearLab, and crams botshittened content mills like BH&#38;G into our eyeballs instead. In 1558, Thomas Gresham coined (ahem) Gresham's Law: "Bad money drives out good." When counterfeit money circulates in the economy, anyone who gets a dodgy coin spends it as quickly as they can, because the longer you hold it, the greater the likelihood that someone will detect the fraud and the coin will become worthless. Run this system long enough and all the money in circulation is funny money. An internet run by Google has its own Gresham's Law: bad sites drive out good. It's not just that BH&#38;G can "test" products at a fraction of the cost of Housefresh &#8211; through the simple expedient of doing inadequate tests or no tests at all &#8211; so they can put a lot more content up than Housefresh. But that alone wouldn't let them drive Housefresh off the front page of Google's search results. For that, BH&#38;G has to mobilize some of their savings from the no test/bad test lab to do real rigorous science: science in defeating Google's security-through-obscurity system, which lets them command the front page despite publishing worse-than-useless nonsense. Google has lost the spam wars. In response to the plague of botshit clogging Google search results, the company has invested in&#8230;making more botshit: https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/16/tweedledumber/#easily-spooked Last year, Google did a $70b stock buyback. They also laid off 12,000 staffers (whose salaries could have been funded for 27 years by that stock buyback). They just laid off thousands more employees. That wasn't the deal. The deal was that Google would get a monopoly, and they would spend their monopoly rents to be so good that you could just click "I'm feeling lucky" and be teleported to the very best response to your query. A company that can't figure out the difference between a scam like Better Homes and Gardens and a rigorous review site like Housefresh should be pouring every spare dime it brings in into fixing this problem. Not buying default search status on every platform so that we never try another search engine: they should be fixing their shit. When Google admits that it's losing the war to these kack-handed spam-farmers, that's frustrating. When they light $26b/year on fire making sure you don't ever get to try anything else, that's very frustrating. When they vaporize seventy billion dollars on financial engineering and shoot one in ten engineers, that's outrageous. Google's scale has transcended the laws of business physics: they can sell an ever-degrading product and command an ever-greater share of our economy, even as their incompetence dooms any decent, honest venture to obscurity while providing fertile ground &#8211; and endless temptation &#8211; for scammers. The Bezzle excerpt (Part IV) (permalink) This week marks the publication of my latest novel, The Bezzle, and to celebrate, I'm serializing an excerpt from Chapter 14 in six parts: https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250865878/thebezzle The Bezzle is a revenge story, a crime novel, and a technothriller. It stars Martin Hench, a hard-fighting forensic accountant who specializes in unwinding high-tech scams. Hench made his debt in last year's Red Team Blues (now in paperback!); The Bezzle is a standalone followup: https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250865854/redteamblues The serial tells the tale of Stefon Magner, AKA Steve Soul, a once-famous R&#38;B frontman whose disintegrating career turned to tragedy when his crooked manager forged his signature on a rights assignment contract that let him steal all of Stefon's royalties, which ballooned after modern hiphop artists discovered his grooves and started buying licenses to sample them. The first three installments related the sad circumstances of Stefon's life, and the real-world analogues (like Leonard Cohen and George Clinton, both of whom were pauperized by sticky-fingered managers) as well as one real-world countermeasure, copyright termination, a thing that more artists should know about and use: https://pluralistic.net/2021/09/26/take-it-back/ Today's installment weaves in a major subplot for the first time in the serial: Los Angeles's notorious, murderous Sheriff's Deputy gangs. These are another unbelievable true tale: for decades, the LASD's deputies have formed themselves into criminal gangs, some of which require that initiates murder someone to be inducted: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_LASD_deputy_gangs They sport gang tattoos, have secret signs, and run vast criminal enterprises. This has been the subject of numerous investigative press reports, and one extensive official report that called the gangs "a cancer": https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/deputy-gangs-cancer-los-angeles-county-sheriffs-department-scathing-re-rcna73367 The sordid tales of the LASD gangs beggar belief. For example, deputies in charge of LA County jails forced inmates to pit-fight and took bets on the outcomes: https://www.aclu.org/publications/report-cruel-and-usual-punishment-how-savage-gang-deputies-controls-la-county-jails The taxpayers of LA have shelled out tens of millions of dollars to settle claims against LA's criminals with badges: https://news.yahoo.com/deputies-accused-being-secret-societies-230851807.html Periodically, LA judges and officials will insist that they are tackling the problem: https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-05-17/dozens-of-lasd-deputies-ordered-to-show-suspected-gang-tattoos-reveal-others-who-have-them But at every turn, the LA police "unions" manage to crush these investigations: https://abc7.com/los-angeles-county-lasd-deputy-gangs-cliques/13492081/ And top cops are right there with them, insisting that these aren't "gangs" &#8211; they're just "subgroups": https://lapublicpress.org/2024/01/former-la-sheriff-villanueva-sheriffs-gangs-are-just-subgroups/ It's very weird being an Angeleno and knowing that one of the largest, most militarized, best funded police departments in the world has been openly captured by a hyperviolent crime syndicate. When I was in the Skyboat Media studios last December with Wil Wheaton recording the audiobook for The Bezzle, Wil broke off from reading to say, "You know, someone's going to read this and google it and have their mind blown when they discover that it's real": https://sowl.co/8nyGh That's one of my favorite ways to turn literature into something more than entertainment. It's why I filled the Little Brother books with real-world surveillance, cryptography and security tech, giving enough detail to advance the plot and give readers an idea of what search terms would let them understand and use the concepts in the novel. That's something I'm happy to keep up with the Hench novels, unpicking the inner workings of scams and corruption. The more of us who are wise to this, the sooner we'll be able to get rid of it. Here's part one of the serial: https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/17/the-steve-soul-caper/#lead-singer-disease Part two: https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/19/crad-kilodney-was-an-outlier/#copyright-termination Part three: https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/20/fore/#lawyer-up And now, onto part four! * * * The last of the boxes had been shelved. Benedetto rose from his chair. “Thank you, gentlemen,” he said to the movers, and dug a roll of twenties out of his pocket and handed each of them two of their own. He turned to me as they filed out. “You wanna get sushi? The place next door is great.” The empty storefront was in a down-­at-­heels strip mall in Eagle Rock. On one side, there was a Brazilian jujitsu studio that never seemed to have any students training in it. On the other side was Sushi Jiro, name on a faded sign with half its lightbulbs gone. Beyond that was a vaping store. “The place next door is good?” He laughed. “You San Francisco motherfuckers got terrible LA restaurant radar. Put Sushi Jiro in the Mission and it’d have a Michelin star and a six-­month waiting list. Here it’s in a strip mall and only the locals know how good it is. Bet you never had a decent meal in this town, am I right?” “I’ve had a few,” I said, “but I admit my track record isn’t great.” “Let’s improve it.” The sushi was amazing. # Inglewood Jams had the kind of books that were performatively bad, designed to foil any attempt at human comprehension. But whoever cooked them was an amateur, someone who mistook complexity for obfuscation. Like cross-­referencing was a species of transcendentally esoteric sorcery. I don’t mind cross-referencing. It’s meditative, like playing solitaire. I had Bene­detto send over some colored post-­it tabs and a big photocopier with an automatic feeder and I started making piles. One night, I worked later than I planned. Sushi Jiro was becoming a serious hazard to my waistline and my sleep-­debt, because when your dinner break is ten yards and two doors away from your desk, it’s just too damned easy to get back to work after dinner. That night, I’d fallen into a cross-­referencing reverie, and before I knew it, it was 2 a.m., my lower back was groaning, and my eyes were stinging. I straightened, groaned, and slid my laptop into my bag. I found my keys and unlocked the door. The storefront was covered with brown butcher’s paper, but it didn’t go all the way to the edge. I had just a moment to sleepily note that there was some movement visible through the crack in the paper over the glass door when it came flying back toward me, bouncing off my toe, mostly, and my nose, a little. I put my one hand to my face as I instinctively threw myself into the door to close it again. I was too late and too tired. A strong shoulder on the other side of the doorframe pushed it open and I stumbled back, and then the guy was on me, the door sighing shut behind him on its gas lift as he bore me to the ground and straddled my chest, a move he undertook with the ease of much practice. He pinned my arms under his knees and then gave me a couple of hard hits, one to the jaw, one to the nose. My lip and nose were bleeding freely and my head was ringing from the hits and from getting smacked into the carpet tiles over concrete when I went down backward. I struggled—­to free my arms, to buck off my attacker, to focus on him. He was a beefy white guy in his late fifties, with watery dark eyes and a patchy shave that showed gray mixed in with his dark stubble. As he raised his fist for another blow, I saw that he was wearing a big class ring. A minute later, that ring opened my cheek, just under the orbit of my eye. Apart from some involuntary animal grunts, I hadn’t made a sound. Now I did. “Ow!” I shouted. “Shit!” I shouted. “Stop!” I shouted. He split my lip again. I bucked hard but I couldn’t budge him. He had a double chin, a gut, and he was strong, and used that bulk to back up his strength. It was like trying to free myself from under a boulder. That kept punching me in the face. The strip mall would be deserted. Everything was closed, even the vaping store. Shouting wouldn’t help. I did it anyway. He shut my mouth for me with a left. I gagged on blood. He took a break from punching me in the face, then. I think he was tired. His chest heaved, and he wiped sweat off his lip with the back of his hand, leaving behind a streaky mustache of my blood. He contemplated me, weighing me up. I thought maybe he was trying to decide if I had any fight left in me, or perhaps whether I had any valuables he could help himself to. He cleared his throat and looked at me again. “Goddammit, I messed your face up so bad I can’t tell for sure. I hope to fuck that you’re Martin Hench, though.” Even with my addled wits, this was an important piece of intelligence: he came here for me. This wasn’t a random act of senseless Los Angeles street violence. This was aimed at me. I was briefly angry at Benedetto for not warning me that Chuy Flores was such a tough son of a bitch. Then I had the presence of mind to lie. “I don’t know who the fuck this Mark Hendricks is.” My voice was thick with gargled blood, but I was proud of Mark Hendricks. Pretty fast thinking for a guy with a probable concussion. The guy slapped me open-­handed across the face, and as I lay dazed for a moment, he shifted, reached into my back pocket for my wallet, and yanked it—­and the seat of my pants—­free. Before I could react, his knees were back on my biceps, pinning my arms and shoulders. It was a very neat move, and fast for an old guy like him. He flipped my wallet open and squinted at it, then held it at arm’s length, then smiled broadly. He had bleach-­white teeth, a row of perfectly uniform caps.

## February 20, 2024

date: 2024-02-21, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog

Both global and national affairs appeared to shift over the holiday weekend. Events of the past week or so highlighted the global stakes of not stopping the aggression of Russia&#8217;s president Vladimir Putin. In turn, those global stakes highlighted that Trump&#8217;s MAGA Republicans are strengthening Putin&#8217;s hand.

## pg_dumpbinary v2.15 released

date: 2024-02-21, from: PostgreSQL News

<p><strong>Zurich, Switzerland - Febuary 14th, 2024</strong></p>
<h2>pg_dumpbinary</h2>
<p><code>pg_dumpbinary</code> dumps a PostgreSQL database to a binary format. The resulting dump must be restored
using <code>pg_restorebinary</code>, which is provided.</p>
<p>Version 2.15 has been published, this release adds a new option and fixes a bug reported by users since
last release.</p>
<ul>
<li>Add -w, --where command line option to pg_dumpbinary to apply a filter
    to the data dumped. The filter will be used in a WHERE clause for data
    export, this clause will be applied to all tables dumped.</li>
<li>Fix error "DBD::Pg::db do failed: server closed the connection unexpectedly"
    when the attempt to dump the pre-data section fail.</li>
</ul>
<p>A full list of changes and acknowledgments can be found <a href="https://github.com/lzlabs/pg_dumpbinary/releases/tag/v2.15">here</a></p>
<p><code>pg_dumpbinary</code> is useful when:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have bytea that can not be exported by <code>pg_dump</code> because the
  total size of the escape/hex output exceeds 1Gb.</li>
<li>You have custom type that stores <code>\0</code> internally in bytea but data
  are exported by pg_dump as char/varchar/text.  In this case pg_dump
  truncates all data after the first '\0', resulting in data loss.</li>
<li>Other cases where a binary output format is useful.</li>
</ul>
<p>In these kinds of cases <code>pg_dumpbinary</code> helps by dumping the
PostgreSQL database in a binary format. In all other cases
the pg_dump/pg_restore commands distributed with PostgreSQL are
preferred.</p>
<p>See the documentation for a more complete description of available
features.</p>
