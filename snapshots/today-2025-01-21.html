id="i-am-a-disappointed-trump-voter-who-was-told-it-would-be-the-past-by-now">I
Am a Disappointed Trump Voter Who Was Told It Would Be the Past by
Now</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-21, from: McSweeney’s Internet Tendency</p>
<p>
Well, they say you should never trust a politician, and it seems I’ve
been duped.
</p>
<p>
For months before and since I cast my vote for Donald J. Trump—and yes,
I’m one of those people who really leans into the “J” for some reason—I
have been promised by every reliable source that change was finally
coming to America, after four years of the failed leadership of Joe
Biden and then the four years before that, which I can’t remember.
</p>
<p>
But it’s abundantly clear that the Trump presidency is delivering more
of the same. And it’s the bad kind of same that’s been happening lately,
not the good kind of same like from the good old days. When men could be
men, women could be women, and I didn’t have to go to work or pay for
anything because I was a child.
</p>
<p>
On issue after issue, we are being force-fed “now” when we were promised
“then.”
</p>
<p>
Take rising prices. On January 20th, at noon sharp, I busted down the
door of my local grocery store like it was Black Friday—and after
management told me that the door would’ve opened automatically if I had
waited two more seconds, I was shocked by what I saw.
</p>
<p>
A dozen eggs still cost four dollars. So did a gallon of milk. And my
fifth-grade teacher, who I used to run into all the time there? Still
dead.
</p>
<p>
Something was wrong. I thought maybe these grocery workers were some
sort of uncontacted people who were living under the tragic illusion
that Joe Biden was still president. But no. They’re modern people. They
keep up with the news through Facebook, just like you and me. And yet,
they were acting as if there was no difference between the day Biden
left office and the day Trump took office.
</p>
<p>
Then there’s the male loneliness epidemic. The voices who talk to me in
my head—mostly Barstool hosts via my earbuds—convinced me that maybe
this terrible feeling of isolation they told me I was experiencing might
finally be a thing of the past. But even though I voted for the guy who
has spent decades betraying absolutely every single person in his life
as soon as they no longer suit his immediate needs, I still have no
friends.
</p>
<p>
I was also promised that my vote would bring an end to <span
class="caps">DEI</span>, ERGs, <span class="caps">CSR</span>, and <span
class="caps">LGBTQ</span>, leaving only real American letters like <span
class="caps">UFC</span> and <span class="caps">EIEIO</span>. And yet,
when I showed up to work this morning, not a single one of my female
co-workers had vanished in a puff of smoke. And also, they still won’t
let me smoke at work! What decade is this—not the 1950s?
</p>
<p>
Then I got home, turned on the TV, and found that the Washington
Commanders are still called the Washington Commanders? And they’re doing
crazy hot right now? And the couples in the commercials for my favorite
erectile dysfunction pills are still interracial? And they’re crazy hot
right now?
</p>
<p>
To let off some steam, I went to the globe store to see if I could get
my model globe replaced—now that the United States is acquiring
Greenland, Canada, Mexico, Panama, and I imagine the UN would probably
throw in some random bonus ones, like Suriname. But the disgruntled
employee at the front desk insisted mine was up-to-date and that none of
those places are states yet—presumably because she’s one of those
deep-state operatives that the administration still hasn’t gotten around
to axing.
</p>
<p>
Now, to be fair, Donald Trump has kept some promises. He brought back
TikTok. And he did it so effectively that it happened on the last guy’s
watch.
</p>
<p>
But everything else about his presidency thus far implies that Donald
Trump is the same guy he was eight years ago, doomed to disappoint as
compared to the extravagantly transformative promises he has made. That
even he is subject to political gravity and the constraints, however
loosened, of the Constitution.
</p>
<p>
And if that’s the case, let me draw a clear line in the sand: I will not
be voting for him in 2028.

Is what you’re doing taking a large amount of text and asking the LLM to
convert it into a smaller amount of text? Then it’s probably going to be
great at it. If you’re asking it to convert into a roughly equal amount
of text it will be so-so. If you’re asking it to create more text than
you gave it, forget about it.

<p>date: 2025-01-21, from: O’Reilly Radar</p>
<p>TL;DR: Enterprise AI teams are discovering that purely agentic
approaches (dynamically chaining LLM calls) don’t deliver the
reliability needed for production systems. The prompt-and-pray
model—where business logic lives entirely in prompts—creates systems
that are unreliable, inefficient, and impossible to maintain at scale. A
shift toward structured automation, which separates conversational
ability from business logic execution, […]</p>

<h2 id="welcome-home-president-nyarlathotep">Welcome Home, President
Nyarlathotep</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-21, from: McSweeney’s Internet Tendency</p>
<p>
Please allow me to take your umbrella,
<a href="https://www.mcsweeneys.net/columns/the-dread-lord-nyarlathotep-presidential-library">Dread
Lord</a>. My advisors informed me this morning during my final daily
presidential briefing that Hell had frozen over in honor of your return.
They certainly made their decision frigidly clear, by golly. I’m happy
the Capitol One Arena could accommodate the final details of your
resummoning ritual on such short notice. The intestinal pedestal erected
so the guests of honor from TikTok, Meta, Amazon, and SpaceX can
properly show fealty by licking your pustuled tentacle was a
particularly nice touch.
</p>
<p>
I know we do not see eye-to-eye sockets on most things. As President
these past four years, I repeatedly
<a href="https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/well-we-gave-nyarlathotep-a-chance-and-he-gave-us-four-years-of-horror-but-its-time-to-move-on-as-a-nation">tried
to remind the nation</a> about the unequivocal evidence that you are not
a “rational human being” in any traditional sense of the term but rather
an Outer God of Chaos devoid of any semblance of conscience, humility,
or even sentient logic. You, meanwhile, cursed my family with bile
plagues, plotted retribution from your Shadow Palace at Mar-a-Lago, and
raged incoherently from some surreal psychic plane known in the common
tongue as Truth Social. You also somehow managed to eternally infect
millions of American minds with false visions of nightmarish and
imaginary foes, bird-murdering windmills, and cheap eggs.
</p>
<p>
But never mind that you’re a convicted necromancer with a paper trail
linking you to every conceivable atrocity, crime against natural law,
and humiliating deviance. The country made its voice loud and clear last
November—and by “loud and clear,” I mean less than 23 percent of the
nation’s total population.
</p>
<p>
So it goes. The gears of this Great Nation grind on, no matter who or
how many people beg us to stop and reconsider. My only responsibility
today is to pass the torch that will help illuminate a new era that’s
somehow more hauntingly grotesque, bleak, and horrifying than your
first.
</p>
<p>
Some say I, in my tenure as Commander-in-Chief, could have helped
silence the trumpets that began heralding your apocalyptic return from
nearly the moment I assumed the presidency. Critics in my own party say
I should have encased the Necronomicon in tetanus-riddled barbed wire
and used one of Elon’s rockets to jettison it into the sun. Or, perhaps,
I should have properly outfitted the country’s already problematically
powerful Witchfinder Generals to root out your mindless goblin horde
that stormed the Capitol in a last-ditch effort to appease you. I was
even informed there is some pretty clear language in the Constitution’s
tattered remnants that explicitly lay out a simple legal spell to banish
you back to the Salted Plains of Mar-a-Lago for the rest of your
unnatural life.
</p>
<p>
To which I say: Look, it really was more a top-to-bottom failure of
every conceivable institutional safeguard that brought us here. Maybe
even a fatal flaw in capitalism’s occultic fabric that inevitably
metastasizes humanity’s worse inclinations. I’m just spitballing, but
maybe American worship of wealth exacerbates these baser tendencies
toward a societal breaking point. And, once broken, that rending in
reality charts a direct path for a Stalker Among the Stars such as
yourself into the Oval Office
</p>
<p>
I’m just saying, they can’t really lay it all at my feet, alright? I’m
sure you and I can at least agree on that. Well, that and
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/20/us/politics/biden-pardons-family.html">pardoning</a>
our respective progeny.
</p>
<p>
But at the end of the day, I suppose I don’t care what the political
historians, marginalized constituents, fearful targets of your ire,
experts in the arcane, or my own tired eyes tried to tell me. For
reasons I have never been able to articulate convincingly, I believe the
American Democratic Experiment is greater than any one vindictive and
insatiable Elder God.
</p>
<p>
I know you campaigned on a renewed platform of “I See All, And It Shall
Burn.” I know innumerable cretins, nihilists, billionaires, and crypto
bros are at the gates, salivating at the Body Politic’s final,
shuddering gasps. But it’s either this or permitting Americans to
realize the truth: Humanity is still capable of conjuring its own
protective communities—and that scares the shit out of feckless
politicians, soul-shirking opportunists, and maybe even Outer Gods.
</p>
<p>
But if my hunch is correct—and hey, there’s a first time for
everything—we should be good to go. So, before I escort you into the
Inauguration Day Fealty Orgy, let me be the first to say: Welcome home,
Dread Lord Nyarlathotep.

<p>
DeepSeek are the Chinese AI lab who dropped the best currently available
open weights LLM
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/26/deepseek-v3/">on
Christmas day</a>, DeepSeek v3. That model was trained in part using
their unreleased R1 “reasoning” model. Today
<a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1">they’ve released R1
itself</a>, along with a whole family of new models derived from that
base.
</p>
<p>
There’s a whole lot of stuff in the new release.
</p>
<p>
<strong>DeepSeek-R1-Zero</strong> appears to be the base model. It’s
<a href="https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Zero/tree/main">over
650GB</a> in size and, like most of their other releases, is
<a href="https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Zero/blob/main/LICENSE">under
a clean MIT license</a>. DeepSeek warn that “DeepSeek-R1-Zero encounters
challenges such as endless repetition, poor readability, and language
mixing.” … so they also released:
</p>
<p>
<strong>DeepSeek-R1</strong> - which “incorporates cold-start data
before RL” and “achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1 across
math, code, and reasoning tasks”. That one is also MIT licensed, and is
a similar size.
</p>
<p>
I don’t have the ability to run models larger than about 50GB (I have an
M2 with 64GB of RAM), so neither of these two models are something I can
easily play with myself. That’s where the new <strong>distilled
models</strong> come in.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
To support the research community, we have open-sourced
DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, and six dense models distilled from
DeepSeek-R1 based on Llama and Qwen.

</blockquote>
<p>
This is a fascinating flex! They have models based on Qwen 2.5 (14B,
32B, Math 1.5B and Math 7B) and Llama 3 (Llama-3.1 8B and Llama 3.3 70B
Instruct).
</p>
<p>
Weirdly those Llama models have an MIT license attached, which I’m not
sure is compatible with the underlying Llama license. Qwen models are
Apache licensed so maybe MIT is OK?
</p>
<p>
(I also

noticed</a> the MIT license files say “Copyright (c) 2023 DeepSeek” so
they may need to pay a little bit more attention to how they copied
those in.)
</p>
<p>
Licensing aside, these distilled models are fascinating beasts.

Running DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-GGUF
</h4>
<p>
Quantized versions are already starting to show up. So far I’ve tried
just one of those -
<code>unsloth/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-GGUF</code> released by
<a href="https://unsloth.ai/">Unsloth AI</a> - and it’s really fun to
play with.
</p>
<p>
I’m running it using the combination of
<a href="https://ollama.com/">Ollama</a>,
<a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a> and the
<a href="https://github.com/taketwo/llm-ollama">llm-ollama plugin</a>.
</p>
<p>
First I fetched and ran the model using Ollama itself:
</p>
<pre><code>ollama run hf.co/unsloth/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-GGUF:Q8_0
</code></pre>
<p>
This downloads around 8.5GB of model data and starts an interactive chat
interface.
</p>
<p>
Once the model has been fetched, LLM can talk to it as well. I prefer
using LLM for experiments because it
<a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/logging.html">logs
everything to SQLite</a> for later exploration.
</p>
<p>
I installed the plugin and ran it like this:
</p>
<pre><code>llm install llm-ollama
llm -m 'hf.co/unsloth/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-GGUF:Q8_0' \
  'a joke about a pelican and a walrus who run a tea room together'
</code></pre>
<p>
Each response starts with a <code>&lt;think&gt;…&lt;/think&gt;</code>
pseudo-XML tag containing the chain of thought used to help generate the
response. For “a joke about a pelican and a walrus who run a tea room
together” that started like this:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<code>&lt;think&gt;</code><br /> Okay, so I need to come up with a joke
about a pelican and a walrus running a tea room together. Hmm, that’s an
interesting combination. Let me think about how these two characters
might interact in a humorous situation.
</p>
<p>
First, let’s consider their characteristics. Pelicans are known for
their long beaks and Webbed feet, often seen near the beach or water.
Walruses have big teeth, thick fur, and they’re generally found in
colder climates, like icebergs or snowy areas. So, combining these two
into a tea room setting is already a funny image.
</p>
<p>
[…]
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It then thought for <em>20 paragraphs</em> before outputting the joke!
Here’s
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/f505ce733a435c8fc8fdf3448e3816b0">the
full transcript</a> and here’s the output at the end, after the
<code>&lt;/think&gt;</code> tag:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<strong>The Joke:</strong>
</p>
<p>
A pelican and a walrus decide to open a quaint little tea room together.
The walrus, with its big size, struggles to find comfortable chairs, so
it sits on the table by accident, knocking over the teapot. Meanwhile,
the pelican, trying to help, uses its beak to place saucers on the
table, causing a few spills.
</p>
<p>
After a series of comical mishaps, the walrus looks up and says with a
grin, “This isn’t so fishy anymore.” The pelican smirks and remarks,
“Maybe not, but we do have a lot of krill in our tea!”
</p>
<p>
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Setup:</strong> Pelican and Walrus run an unlikely tea room.
Their sizes lead to comedic chaos.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Punchline:</strong> “This isn’t so fishy anymore” is a pun on
the situation becoming less absurd. The follow-up joke introduces
“krill,” a play on words that ties into both marine life (“fish”) and
tea, making it humorous while fitting the theme.
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
So yeah, the joke is <em>awful</em>. But the process of getting there
was such an interesting insight into how these new models work.
</p>
<p>
This was a relatively small 8B model. I’m looking forward to trying out
the
<a href="https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B">Llama
70B version</a>, which isn’t yet available in a GGUF I can run with
Ollama. Given
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/9/llama-33-70b/">the
strength of Llama 3.3 70B</a> - currently my favourite GPT-4 class model
that I’ve run on my own machine - I have high expectations.
</p>
<h4 id="can-it-draw-a-pelican-">
Can it draw a pelican?
</h4>
<p>
I tried <a href="https://github.com/simonw/pelican-bicycle">my
classic</a> <code>Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle</code>
prompt too. It
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/ddd21a016cd7be74fd3e18407e1e313e">did
not do very well</a>:
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/r1-peli-1.svg" alt="Blue square, abstract white shape on it" style="max-width: 100%;" />
</p>
<p>
It looked to me like it got the order of the elements wrong, so I
followed up with:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<code>the background ended up covering the rest of the image</code>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/ddd21a016cd7be74fd3e18407e1e313e#response-1">thought
some more</a> and gave me this:
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/r1-peli-2.svg" alt="Blue square, abstract white shape on it" style="max-width: 100%;" />
</p>
<p>
As with the earlier joke, the chain of thought in the transcript was far
more interesting than the end result.

[Microsoft] said it plans in 2025 “to invest approximately $80 billion
to build out AI-enabled datacenters to train AI models and deploy AI and
cloud-based applications around the world.”
</p>
<p>
For comparison, the James Webb telescope cost $10bn, so Microsoft is
spending eight James Webb telescopes in one year just on AI.
</p>
<p>
For a further comparison, people think the long-in-development ITER
fusion reactor will cost between $40bn and $70bn once developed (and
it’s shaping up to be a 20-30 year project), so Microsoft is spending
more than the sum total of humanity’s biggest fusion bet <em>in one
year</em> on AI.
