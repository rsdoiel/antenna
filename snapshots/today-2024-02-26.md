## Trump Appeals $454 Million Judgment in New York Civil Fraud Case

date: 2024-02-26, from: VOA News USA

New York — Donald Trump has appealed his $454 million New York civil fraud judgment, challenging a judge's finding that Trump lied about his wealth as he grew the real estate empire that launched him to stardom and the presidency.


The former president's lawyers filed a notice of appeal Monday asking the state's mid-level appeals court to overturn Judge Arthur Engoron's Feb. 16 verdict in Attorney General Letitia James' lawsuit.


Trump's lawyers wrote in court papers that they're asking the appeals court to decide whether Engoron "committed errors of law and/or fact" and whether he abused his discretion and/or his jurisdiction.


Engoron found that Trump, his company and top executives, including his sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr., schemed for years to deceive banks and insurers by inflating his wealth on financial statements used to secure loans and make deals. Among other penalties, the judge put strict limitations on the ability of Trump's company, the Trump Organization, to do business.


The appeal ensures that the legal fight over Trump's business practices will persist into the thick of the presidential primary season, and likely beyond, as he tries to clinch the Republican presidential nomination in his quest to retake the White House.


If upheld, Engoron's ruling will force Trump to give up a sizable chunk of his fortune. Engoron ordered Trump to pay $355 million in penalties, but with interest the total has grown to nearly $454 million. That total will increase by nearly $112,000 per day until he pays.

## Flood Risk Is Hurting Texas Home Prices

date: 2024-02-26, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDM0MDAwMC9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2ODQzODE2Nn0.7qLtGHwtvJDuHPOt-W4Ue-pqu3d_1ggV3S7sxzg1utg/image.png?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C1%2C0%2C1"/><br/><br/><p>
<em><strong>Current conditions: </strong>Mexico City’s iconic jacaranda trees have bloomed early • More than half of Australia’s Victoria state is under an extreme bushfire danger alert • It could hit 63 degrees Fahrenheit in Green Bay, Wisconsin, tomorrow. The average February high is 29 degrees.</em>
</p><h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2><h3>1. Study: Mandatory flood risk disclosures hit Texas property prices</h3><p>
<strong></strong>New research offers a glimpse into how climate change continues to alter the real estate landscape in America. A recent <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=a61c304ced&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study</a> from Fannie May examined a Texas law, enacted in 2019 after Hurricane Harvey, that requires properties at risk of flooding be listed as such. The study found that the law has decreased prices for flood-prone homes by $15,000 on average. The study “comes as many states adopt or consider similar flood disclosure requirements,” E&E News <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=9b1974f310&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>. Harvey caused $155 billion in property damage. Experts say climate change is making hurricanes more <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=887a6e5e79&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">destructive</a>.
</p><h3>2. First U.S. Jeep EV coming soon</h3><p>
<strong></strong>Eco-conscious Jeep lovers have been waiting patiently for a fully-electric version of their favorite vehicle, and their wait will soon be over. Jeep’s first EV – the Wagoneer S SUV – is entering production in the second quarter of 2024 and could be delivered to customers by July, the company’s CEO Antonio Filsosa <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=7effd79c86&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>. It will be the first EV to sit on Stellantis’ new STLA Large EV platform. An electric Recon (which is inspired by the Wrangler) could be <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=053458b66b&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">available</a> by the end of the year. Stellantis-owned Jeep saw a 6% drop in U.S. sales last year, and is slashing prices on some of its best selling vehicles to combat the dip. It is no doubt hoping the EV push will help turn things around. “They’ve suddenly got a lot more competition than they traditionally have had,” Sam Abuelsamid, an e-mobility analyst at market research firm Guidehouse Inc., told <em>The Detroit News</em>. “There’s certainly opportunity for them to grow their share, but it’s not going to be easy.”

</p><h3>3. UN Environment Assembly kicks off in Nairobi </h3><p>
<strong></strong>The sixth session of the <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=146952b6ec&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">United Nations Environment Assembly</a> (UNEA-6) gets underway in Nairobi, Kenya, today. Member states will consider 19 draft resolutions on issues including climate change, pollution, and biodiversity. At the last meeting, in 2022, the group adopted 14 resolutions, including one on ending plastic pollution, which was called “the most significant environmental multilateral deal since the Paris Agreement,” <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=7c34313642&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to</a><em> The Associated Press</em>. “UNEA-6 won’t solve the world’s problems overnight,” <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=8585339ee3&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> Inger Andersen, executive director of the UN Environment Programme. "What it will do is unite nations under the banner of environmental action, focus minds and energies on key solutions and guide the work of UNEP in this critical period for people and planet.” The meeting runs until March 1.
</p><h3>4. Farmer protests escalate in Brussels</h3><p>
<strong></strong>The streets of Brussels are clogged with nearly 1,000 large tractors today as farmers descend on the city to protest environmental policies being discussed by EU agriculture ministers. Piles of tires were set on fire and manure was dumped onto the streets. Some tractors plowed through barricades. Police fired water cannons. Farmers across Europe have been protesting for weeks, demanding that policymakers do more to help out the agriculture sector, including scrapping some policies aimed at significantly reducing the bloc’s emissions by 2040. “We are not against climate policies,” the head of one farming organization told <em><a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=c674fef35d&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Reuters</a></em>. “But we know that in order to do the transition, we need higher prices for products because it costs more to produce in an ecological way.” The protests may be working: The EU has <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=dc4d261347&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">already back-tracked</a> on cutting farming emissions, and nixed plans to urge citizens to eat less meat.

<strong></strong>This went slightly under the radar last week, but is worth highlighting: Retail giant Walmart has <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=d718687db0&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hit a 2030 goal</a> of reducing its Scope 3 emissions – six years early. Through the company’s “Project Gigaton” initiative, Walmart suppliers have removed 1 billion metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions from their value chains by reducing emissions, sequestering them, or avoiding them altogether. Project Gigaton launched in 2017. It’s a voluntary program that asks suppliers to set science-based emissions reduction targets in areas like waste, packaging, energy use, and transportation. Nearly 6,000 suppliers have signed up, and nearly 75% of net U.S. sales now come from Project Gigaton suppliers, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=b5bae81d7d&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>.<br/>
<br/>
	Scope 3 emissions – which come from a company’s supply chain and also from the ways consumers use its products – usually represent about <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=7cd566c008&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">70%</a> of a company’s carbon footprint. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was set to require all U.S.-listed companies to disclose their Scope 3 emissions, but appears poised to <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=c9cd9d7c38&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">roll back this rule</a>, leaving companies and individual states to take the initiative. Already California is requiring large companies doing business in the state to report Scope 3 emissions by 2027.

<p>Chinese phone maker TECNO is the latest company making a play for the handheld gaming PC. But the company&#8217;s new TECNO Pocket GO is a little different from&#8230; anything else on the market.

## Apple Announces Post-Quantum Encryption Algorithms for iMessage

date: 2024-02-26, updated: 2024-02-23, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Apple announced <a href="https://security.apple.com/blog/imessage-pq3/">PQ3</a>, its post-quantum encryption standard based on the <a href="https://pq-crystals.org/kyber/">Kyber</a> secure key-encapsulation protocol, one of the post-quantum algorithms <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/post-quantum-cryptography/selected-algorithms-2022">selected</a> by NIST in 2022.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot of detail in the Apple <a href="https://security.apple.com/blog/imessage-pq3/">blog post</a>, and more in Douglas Stabila&#8217;s <a href="https://security.apple.com/assets/files/Security_analysis_of_the_iMessage_PQ3_protocol_Stebila.pdf">security analysis</a>.</p>
<p>I am of two minds about this. On the one hand, it&#8217;s probably premature to switch to any particular post-quantum algorithms. The mathematics of cryptanalysis for these lattice and other systems is still rapidly evolving, and we&#8217;re likely to break more of them&#8212;and learn a lot in the process&#8212;over the coming few years. But if you&#8217;re going to make the switch, this is an excellent choice. And Apple&#8217;s ability to do this so efficiently speaks well about its algorithmic agility, which is probably more important than its particular cryptographic design. And it is probably about the right time to worry about, and defend against, attackers who are storing encrypted messages in hopes of breaking them later on future quantum computers...</p>

When he launched his &#8220;special military operation&#8221; in 2022, Putin expected his tanks to roll into Kyiv within days, a proof of concept for his vision of a reconstituted Soviet Union.</p>

## February 25, 2024

date: 2024-02-26, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog

The last several days have seen a Republican stampede to distance the party from the Alabama Supreme Court&#8217;s decision of a week ago, when it ruled that embryos frozen for in vitro fertilization (IVF) should be considered children and that their injury can be treated like injury to a child. That decision has led major healthcare providers in Alabama to stop IVF procedures out of fear of prosecution.

## Dragons and Dancers Parade Through Manhattan's Chinatown for Lunar New Year

date: 2024-02-26, from: VOA News USA

New York — Dragons took a starring role at the Lunar New Year parade in Manhattan's historic Chinatown on Sunday — it's the Year of the Dragon, after all — as hundreds of revelers filled the cold clear air with the sound of drums, cymbals and puffs of confetti.


Lions and red lanterns were interspersed with around a dozen groups displaying traditional dragon puppets, which stretched up to 20 meters (65 feet) long, in interconnected segments held by up to 11 people walking beneath.


Two people also held up a giant golden picture frame with the Chinese character for "Dragon" on a red background.


Other staples of the parade included waves of red lanterns, a file of classic cars, as well as formations by local civic organizations, businesses, New York City agencies, and politicians. Many marchers yelled "Happy New Year" in English, mixing in traditional greetings in Mandarin and Cantonese wishing financial prosperity.


Asian communities across the world started ringing in the Lunar New Year on Feb 10, celebrating the Year of the Dragon in the Chinese zodiac. Fireworks, parades and other Lunar New Year rituals are centered around removing bad luck and welcoming prosperity.


In New York, there have already been major celebrations in larger Chinese immigrant enclaves in Queens and Brooklyn. While the symbolic new lunar cycle ended earlier this week with the full moon, Manhattan's parade was scheduled for the weekend.

## Kayakers Paddle in Death Valley After Rains Replenish Lake

date: 2024-02-26, from: VOA News USA

DEATH VALLEY NATIONAL PARK, Calif — Kayakers have been paddling in one of the driest places on Earth after a series of record rainstorms battered California's Death Valley and replenished Lake Manly.


Park Ranger Nichole Andler said Badwater Basin at Death Valley National Park, which runs along part of central California's border with Nevada, "is normally a very beautiful, bright white salt flat."


This year it is a lake.


In the past six months, Death Valley has received more than double its annual rainfall amount, recording more than 12.45 centimeters (4.9 inches) compared to a typical year that gets about 5.08 centimeters (2 inches). Temperatures at or above 54.44 C (130 F) have only been recorded on Earth a handful of times, mostly in Death Valley.


Badwater Basin is the lowest point in North America at 85.95 meters (282 feet) below sea level and has been a favored spot for tourists to take selfies and briefly walk along the white salt flats ringed by sandy-colored mountains.


"It's the lowest point, in North America. So it's going to collect water, but to have as much water as we have now — and for it to be as deep and lasting as long as it has — this is extremely uncommon," Andler said. "If it's not once-in-a-lifetime, it's nearly."


Andler said kayakers should come soon since water levels are expected to drop in a matter of weeks, though the lake "will probably be here into April. If we're lucky, May. And then it'll be a muddy, wet mess, and then it'll dry out into those gorgeous white salt flats."


On Thursday, Heather Gang of Pahrump, Nevada, and her husband, Bob, were among hundreds of visitors playing in the water. Most waded into the lake, though the couple and others paddled where the water reached up to about a foot (0.3 meters) deep in parts.


"It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to kayak Lake Manley," Heather Gang said.


It was a sharp contrast to the Death Valley of the past where they figured they had once stood around the same spot and looked at the chalky salt flats for as far as the eye could see.


The couple has been eyeing the lake's evolution ever since last year's storms started filling the lake. In the fall, they drove out to see it re-emerge as a lake but they said it wasn't deep enough for kayaks like now. This time the water reached up to the boardwalk.


The lake, which is currently about 9.66 kilometers long and 4.83 kilometers wide, is still nowhere near its original state thousands of years ago after it formed during the Ice Age and covered a significant part of the park and was several hundred feet deep.


Bob Gang said he had heard the lake had filled up to the point that boaters could go on it about 20 years ago, so he didn't want to miss out on the experience this time.


"It's a lot of fun," said Bob Gang, who gave a girl a ride on his kayak. "It's good to see the little kids out here enjoying this and seeing something totally unique."


It could be another 20 years before boaters return, he added, but "with climate change, who knows, maybe this will be the normal."


Guo Yu, an assistant research professor of hydrometeorology at the Nevada-based Desert Research Institute, said the lake's size is a "simple natural phenomenon."


It's linked to a wet winter from a strong El Nino — a natural and occasional warming of part of the Pacific Ocean that can lead to more precipitation than usual in California — plus climate change, which brings more intense atmospheric rivers to the area more frequently, Yu said.


Scientists need to study Lake Manly now, he said, to see if they can harness the water for other uses in the future, such as drinking water throughout the dry Southwest.


Tiffany Pereira, an associate research scientist at the institute, said the lake's size now can be beneficial to local flora and fauna.


Certain seed species endemic to the area, meaning they only naturally exist in Death Valley, have lain dormant for a decade or more and are now beginning their short-lived life cycle because there is enough water to sustain them.


"They hang out, they do their thing, and as soon as it dries up, that's it. They're done," she said.


For now, friends Trudell Artiglere and Sheri Dee Hopper of Las Vegas will enjoy paddling through the lake. At the end of the day on Thursday, Artiglere said, their salt-encrusted kayaks looked like "glazed donuts."

## US Airman Sets Himself on Fire Outside Israeli Embassy in Washington

date: 2024-02-26, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — A U.S. military service member set himself on fire, in an apparent act of protest against the war in Gaza, outside the Israeli Embassy in Washington on Sunday afternoon, authorities said.


The man was transported to an area hospital after the fire was put out by U.S. Secret Service officers, DC Fire and EMS posted online. The man remains in critical condition, a Metropolitan Police Department spokesperson said Sunday afternoon.


An Air Force spokesperson confirmed that the incident involved an active-duty airman.


"I will no longer be complicit in genocide," said the man, wearing military fatigues, in a video he broadcasted live over the internet, according to The New York Times.


He then doused himself in a clear liquid and set himself on fire, screaming "Free Palestine," the Times reported.


Local police and Secret Service are investigating the incident.


Israel's embassy has been the target of continued protest against the war in Gaza.


The war in Gaza has led to pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli protests in the United States.


The protests started after Oct. 7 when Hamas, the Palestinian Islamist group that rules Gaza, killed 1,200 Israelis and seized 253 hostages in a cross-border attack.

Since then, Israeli forces have waged a military campaign against the coastal enclave, laying much of it to waste, with nearly 30,000 people dead, according to Palestinian health officials.


In December, a protester set herself on fire outside the Israeli Consulate in Atlanta.

## Biden to Summon Congressional Leaders to Discuss Ukraine, Government Funding

date: 2024-02-26, from: VOA News USA

Washington — President Joe Biden will convene the top four congressional leaders at the White House on Tuesday to press lawmakers on passing an emergency aid package for Ukraine and Israel, as well as averting a looming government shutdown next month, according to a White House official.


The top four leaders include Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson, Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, and Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.


During the meeting, the president will discuss the “urgency” of passing the aid package, which has bipartisan support, as well as legislation to keep the federal government operating through the end of September, said the White House official, who was granted anonymity to discuss a meeting not yet publicly confirmed.


The Republican-led House is under pressure to pass the $95 billion national security package that bolsters aid for Ukraine, Israel as well as the Indo-Pacific. That legislation cleared the Senate on a 70-29 vote earlier this month, but Johnson has been resistant to put the aid bill up for a vote in the House.


“This is one of those instances where one person can bend the course of history. Speaker Johnson, if he put this bill on the floor, would produce a strong, bipartisan majority vote in favor of the aid to Ukraine,” Jake Sullivan, the White House national security adviser, said Sunday on ABC's “This Week.”


Sullivan stressed that Ukrainians need weapons and ammunition to fend off Russian forces, and that in his personal conversations with the speaker, he “has indicated that he would like to get the funding for Ukraine.”


Separate from the national security package, the first tranche of government funding is due to expire Friday. The rest of the federal government, including agencies such as the Pentagon, Department of Homeland Security and the State Department, expires on March 8.


In a letter to his colleagues sent Sunday, Schumer said there was not yet an agreement to avoid a partial shutdown of the agencies whose funding expires this week. That includes the departments of Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, Agriculture and Veterans Affairs.


“While we had hoped to have legislation ready this weekend that would give ample time for members to review the text, it is clear now that House Republicans need more time to sort themselves out,” Schumer wrote in the letter. The Senate majority leader called on Johnson to “step up to once again, buck the extremists in his caucus, and do the right thing" by greenlighting funding to keep the government open.

## Biden, Utah's Governor Call for Less Bitterness, More Bipartisanship in Politics

Washington — President Joe Biden and Utah Gov. Spencer Cox disagree on many issues but they were united Saturday in calling for less bitterness in politics and more bipartisanship.


"Politics has gotten too personally bitter," said Biden, who has practiced politics since he was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1972. "It's just not like it was." The Democratic president commented while delivering a toast to the nation's governors and their spouses at a black-tie White House dinner in their honor.


Biden said what makes him "feel good" about hosting the governors is "we have a tradition of doing things together. We fight like hell, we make sure that we get our points across. At the end of the day, we know who we work for. The objective is to get things done."


Cox, a Republican and chairman of the National Governors Association, preceded Biden to the lectern beneath an imposing portrait of Abraham Lincoln above the fireplace in the State Dining Room.


The Utah governor said the association "harkens back to another time, another era, when we did work together across partisan lines, when there was no political danger in appearing with someone from the other side of the aisle and we have to keep this, we have to maintain this, we cannot lose this," he said.


Cox leads an initiative called "Disagree Better" that aims to reduce divisiveness. He had joked earlier in the program that he and Biden might be committing "mutually assured destruction" by appearing together at the White House since they're both up for reelection this year.


He told Biden that as state chief executives, governors "know just a very little bit of the incredible burden that weighs on your shoulders. We can't imagine what it must be like, the decisions that you have to make, but we feel a small modicum of that pressure and so, tonight, we honor you."


Biden said he remembered when lawmakers would argue by day and break bread together at night. He is currently embroiled in stalemates with the Republican-controlled House over immigration policy, government funding and aid for Ukraine and Israel.


Cox went on to say that his parents taught him to pray for the leader of the country.


"Mr. President, I want you to know that our family prays for you and your family every night," he said. "We pray that you will be successful because if you are successful that means that United States of America is successful and, tonight, we are always Americans first, so thank you."


Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat who is the association's vice chairman, also offered a toast.


"We have a lot more in common and a lot more that brings us together as Americans for love of country and love of the people of our country," he said.


Vice President Kamala Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff, were among Cabinet secretaries and White House officials who sat among the governors. The group included North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, who in December ended his bid to become the Republican presidential nominee and challenge Biden.


Guests dined on house-made burrata cheese, an entree choice of beef braciole or cod almandine and lemon meringue tart with limoncello ice cream for dessert.


After dinner, the program moved to the East Room for a performance by country singer Trisha Yearwood.


The governors, in Washington for their annual winter meeting, heard from Biden and Harris on Friday during a separate session at the White House.

## 'One Love' Gets More Box Office Love, No. 1 for Second Week

date: 2024-02-25, from: VOA News USA

Los Angeles — For a second straight week, biopic “ Bob Marley: One Love” continues to exceed expectations by claiming the No. 1 spot at the box office, overcoming two debut films and Sony's “Madame Web” that's still producing subpar numbers.


The Paramount film starring Kingsley Ben-Adir pulled in $13.5 million during its second week of release. The project, which was produced for about $70 million, already eclipsed that mark, grossing nearly $72 million domestically in North America.


It's an impressive achievement for the Reinaldo Marcus Green-directed Marley's musical biopic that's focused on the Rastafarian legend's story during the making of his 1977 album “Exodus" while leading up to his impactful concert in his native Jamaica.


"Some of his greatest hits came out nearly 50 years ago, but his music still resonates through this film,” said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for data firm Comscore.


“One Love” drew nearly $2 million more than “Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba - To the Hashira Training” which placed No. 2. The latest installment in the Japanese anime series from Crunchyroll and Sony debuted with $11.7 million.


“Demon Slayer” scored the impressive opening number from only 1,949 locations — far less than “One Love” with 3,597 and 3,020 for “ Ordinary Angels " — a faith-based Lionsgate film starring Hilary Swank that placed third at the box office with an estimated $6.5 million.


“There might not be any huge blockbuster films recently, but there some real gems out there for moviegoers to see,” Dergarabedian said.


All three of those films outperformed better than “Madame Web," which has struggled to find its footing after the superhero movie flopped last week. It was thought the Spider-Man spinoff would draw strong numbers — especially with Dakota Johnson starring as the film's lead Marvel character.


But so far, it hasn't lived up to the hype, producing just $6 million in its second week and grossing a little more than a disappointing $35 million.


After its 10th weekend, Universal's animated “Migration” rounded out the top five with $3 million, bringing its domestic total to $120 million. “Argylle” placed sixth with $2.8 million barely outpacing “Wonka," which reeled in $2.5 million. Paul King’s musical starring Timothee Chalamet as a young Willy Wonka has grossed more than $214 million in 11 weeks.


The Ethan Coen-directed “Drive-Away Dolls” debuted eighth with $2.4 million ahead of “The Beekeeper” and “The Chosen” season four, a Christian series focused on Jesus Christ.


Dergarabedian called this past week a slow one. But next week, he expects it'll pick up greatly with the highly anticipated “Dune: Part Two” making its long-waited debut, which should end the top spot reign by “One Love.”


“It's the calm before the sandstorm,” he said.


Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.


1. “Bob Marley: One Love,” $13.5 million.

2. “Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba - To the Hashira Training,” $11.5 million.

3. "Ordinary Angels," $6.5 million.

4. “Madame Web,” $6 million.

5. “Migration,” $3 million.

6. “Argylle,” $2.8 million.

7. “Wonka,” $2.5 million.

8. “Drive-Away Dolls,” $2.4 million.

9. “The Beekeeper,” $1.9 million.

10. “The Chosen,” Episodes 4-6, $1.7 million.

## Scopetrex

date: 2024-02-25, from: Microcores blog



<p>Since I started hacking on computer hard- and software in the 1980s, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_6809" title="Motorola 6809">Motorola's
6809 processor</a> is one of my favorite 8-bit CPUs. The 6809 is the last generation of Motorola's 8-bit CPU family, which started with the 6800 in 1974 and also was used in a number of microcontrollers of the 6805, HC11 and 9S12 families. The latter are still used in automotive applications today. If you know the 6502, the 6809 feels quite familiar, since it has an identical bus interface and very similar assembler programming model without some of the constraints of the 6502 such as an 8-bit stack pointer or a lack of 16-bit address registers. This is not really surprising, since a number of Motorola 6800 engineers left the company to develop the 6502 and then joined MOS.</p>

<p>However, the 6809 only came to the market in 1978 - only a year before the 68000 - and thus was quite late (and also rather expensive compared to the 6502 and Z80). Only a few home computers used the processor, e.g. the Dragon 32 and 64, the Tandy Color Computer and Thompson's MO5 and TO7.</p>

<p>Another system which used the 6809 was a quite special game console, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vectrex" title="Vectrex">Vectrex</a>. Instead of a standard raster-based screen, the Vectrex used its CRT as a vector display by controlling the X and Y deflection as well as the intensity of the CRT's electron beam directly. This is done by generating analog voltages for the X and Y position using an 8-bit digital-to-analog converter (DAC0808). Since DACs were quite expensive back then, the single DAC analog output is multiplexed using a CD4052 analog multiplexer to the various connectors. The rest of the Vectrex hardware is rather simple. A 6522 VIA connects to the DAC and some control functions and a AY3-8912 chip generates sound and provides another 8-bit port to interface to the Vectrex controllers. The remaining chips are an 8 kB ROM, 1 kB of SRAM (32 kB in the Scopetrex), some 74-series glue logic and a number of op-amps and other analog chips to generate the analog signal outputs.</p>

<p>Vectrexes were only built for about two years and unfortunately have become highly sought after (read: expensive) collector's items. Luckily, since the Vectrex uses only standard components, it is rather simple to build a clone. The software situation is also quite nice, since Jay Smith, then head of Smith Engineering (the designer of the Vectrex), allowed new hard/software development on a fee- and royalty-free basis and has also allowed duplication of the original Vectrex software on a not-for-profit basis.</p>

<p>Such a Vectrex clone is available in form of the <a href="https://github.com/schlae/scopetrex" title="Scopetrex">Scopetrex by TubeTime</a>. This is not a 100% replica since it uses a different PCB form factor and a 32 kB SRAM instead of the original 1 kB, but is perfectly compatible with all original software. It's a good project to get started with a more complex hardware build if you have some soldering experience and most of the parts are still available new from vendors such as Digikey or Mouser. The 6809 CPU (you will need at least the 1.5 MHz version 68A09, a 68B09 will also work fine - both the versions with internal clock generator and the one without that has the "E" suffix can be used) and the sound chip (a AY3-8910 or YM2149 can also be used) can be easily found on aliexpress.</p>

<p>My Vectrex build worked out of the box, now I only need to find a suitable vector display. You can use an oscilloscope in X-Y mode, but most modern scopes no longer feature a Z (intensity) input, so the display is disturbed by vectors which should not be drawn (intensity = 0). If you have an old analog Hameg 203, this will work nicely... A picture of the successful bringup is shown below.</p>

<p>By concidence, <a href="https://itwww.hs-pforzheim.de/daten/mitarbeiter/johannsen/vectrex_lab/projects/scopetrex/scopetrex.htm" title="Scopetrexes">a colleague in Germany has also started building Scopetrexes</a>. Small world...</p>

## I have a new* website

date: 2024-02-25, from: Manu - I write blog

<p>Well, kinda. It’s not really new as you can see. The typeface is—probably—still the same, the layout is mostly the same but lots of things have changed. Let me go through them</p>
<h2>Typefaces</h2>
<p>This site is now—potentially—using web fonts. I’m saying potentially because if you’re reading this on a Mac or on something running iOS you’re probably seeing a system font. My old site was designed around the Iowan typeface but that’s only available on iOS and Mac so most people were seeing a different version using one of the other available serif typefaces. That choice was because I went through a phase where I was trying to push my site toward extreme minimalism. And if you ask me, I had quite the success in that regard. My site was just 1 single HTTP request, the CSS was stupidly optimized and everything was stupid fast and stupid lightweight. But the designer in me was bothered by this and I decided to bring back a web font. If you’re on Windows or Android you’re now getting served Iowan as a web font. I’m also now using a sans-serif font for a couple of small details. I have no idea what you’re seeing because I’m defaulting on a system font.</p>
<p>I also messed with the typography a little bit and changed a few things here and there but the site should still feel mostly the same. I’m not done fine-tuning all this and I’m sure I’ll keep changing little things here and there for months but I had enough and I decided to push it live.</p>
<h2>New “Where do you go from here?” section</h2>
<p>Back when I designed my site, that section between the content of the post and the archive was meant to be a place to store my contact info and not much else. But it ended up being a place to dump all sorts of stuff and there were just too many links and I didn’t want to add more to make things worse.</p>
<p>That’s why I decided to rethink that section entirely and it’s now a lot more organised but still quite minimal. All the old links are still there but now there’s direct access to two new things.</p>
<h2>Guestbook</h2>
<p>The first of those two new things is a <a href="/guestbook">guestbook</a>. I thought about making one months ago but back then I didn’t want to mess with my site. But now it’s here and I can’t wait to see what you people out there are going to write on it.</p>
<h2>Supporters</h2>
<p>The second is the <a href="/supporters">supporters</a> page. I don’t want kindness to go unnoticed and I plan to make that page a lot more useful and structured. I want to provide as much value as possible to those who are kind enough to support what I do and that’s going to be just one of the places where I plan to do it.</p>
<h2>Closing thoughts</h2>
<p>I’m quite happy with this subtle refresh. My site’s been the same for almost 7 years at this point but I still think it works quite well so I don’t want to completely redesign it. At least not yet. Maybe in another 7 years.</p>
<p>As always, <a href="mailto:hello@manuelmoreale.com">my inbox is always open</a> so if you want to share your thoughts you know what to do. And don’t forget to sign my guestbook!</p>

## Lisp in Small Processors

date: 2024-02-25, from: Microcores blog



<p>While AI is all the rage again, the previous AI wave was focusing on languages like Lisp and Prolog and even built hardware with special processors optimized to execute Lisp code, made by companies such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolics" title="Symbolics">Symbolics</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_Machines" title="Lisp Machines, Inc. (LMI)">Lisp Machines, Inc.</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments_Explorer" title="TI Explorer">Explorer Series by Texas Instruments</a>. The machines used OSes written in Lisp and provided the user with large, bitmapped screens to operate a mouse-based GUI and networking.</p>

<p>Lisp machines originated at <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu" title="MIT's AI Lab">MIT's AI Lab</a> and were influential for a number of reasons. A certain Richard Stallman was a graduate student at the AI Lab and unhappy with the commercialization of the Lisp technology by LMI and Symbolics, started to develop Free Software such as Emacs and the gcc compiler and started the Free Software Foundation. The LMI LAMBDA machine was based on Western Digital's NuBus bus system and was subsequently acquired by TI to create the Explorer. </p>

<p>The NuBus was, in turn, used by Motorola 68k-based Macintosh and early PowerPC systems as well as the NeXT Cube. These NuBus-based Macs were subsequently used to create personal Lisp workstations which employed a VLSI integrated Lisp chip and used the Mac as I/O system. Both Symbolics and TI offered such a system, MacIvory and MicroExplorer, respectively. The latest development is an emulator of Symbolics Lisp machines, the <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?GeneraOs" title="Genera OS">Genera OS</a>.</p>

<p><strong>If you own a MacIvory or MicroExplorer card you want to sell, please get in touch</strong></p>

<p>However, there were also efforts to implement Lisp on smaller machines, including popular 8-bit CPUs. The <a href="https://archive.org/details/BYTE_Vol_04-08_1979-08_Lisp" title="BYTE August 1979">August 1979 issue of BYTE magazine</a> was dedicated to Lisp and did not only provide a lot of background on the language and its application, but also published the implementation of a Lisp interpreter written by S. Tucker Taft in assembly for the Motorola 6800. Unfortunately, the space in that issue was constrained, so only a part of the interpreter source code was published and the complete code could be ordered from BYTE. 45 years later, this is no longer possible, so I thought the code was lost...</p>

<p>Thanks to the power of Mastodon, Pablo Marx (thanks a lot!) managed to find the original listing of that Lisp implementation and sent me <a href="files/BYTE_6800_LISP_Interpreter.pdf" title="Lisp source PDF">the scanned document as PDF</a> as well as <a href="https://github.com/pablomarx/lisp6800" title="Github 6800 Lisp repository">a link to his github repository with the 6800 Lisp code</a>.</p>

<p>If you are interested to know how a low-level implementation of a Lisp VM, including the REPL, lambdas, and a garbage collector works, I can recommend taking a look at this article and the accompanying source code. I'm thinking of porting the VM to my <a href="https://github.com/schlae/scopetrex" title="Scopetrex">Scopetrex Vectrex game console clone</a>. This is a fascinating piece of hardware based on Motorola's 6809 CPU, the successor of the 6800, which is not binary compatible. However, the <a href="https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/13975/how-did-the-6809-achieve-source-code-compatibility-with-the-6800" title="conversion">assembler source code can be easily converted</a>. The Vectrex and the Scopetrex clone use a vector CRT display, which makes developing software for the system quite interesting.</p>

<p>Automatic conversion of the assembly code should also be possible, e.g. there is a <a href="https://colorcomputerarchive.com/repo/Documents/Manuals/Programming/6502-6809Translator%20%28Computer%20Systems%20Consultants%29.pdf" title="6502 to 6809 converter">6502 to 6809 converter</a>.</p>

There's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJVWZy4QOy0">Beatles song</a>, by John Lennon, that was written by cribbing promotional items from a 19th-century <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Being_for_the_Benefit_of_Mr._Kite!#Background">circus poster</a>.

## Nine EVs that lease for under $400/month: Ioniq 5, Solterra, Niro, Ioniq 6, more

For whatever reason, all EVs get the full $7500 applied to leases, however. So that has <a href="https://electrek.co/best-electric-vehicle-leases/">more people leasing EVs</a> than ever before. </p>



<p>The number of electric vehicle models that can be leased for less than an average monthly lease cost of $400/month has grown by 50% since last August. The list now includes nine models with factory offers that rival lease terms on low-priced ICE vehicles such as the Toyota Camry LE, Chevy Equinox LT, and Honda HR-V LX. Two of those EV models have a range of over 300 miles.</p>

## Consumers Pushing Back Against Price Increases — And Winning

date: 2024-02-25, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Inflation has changed the way many Americans shop. Now, those changes in consumer habits are helping bring down inflation.


Fed up with prices that remain about 19%, on average, above where they were before the pandemic, consumers are fighting back. In grocery stores, they're shifting away from name brands to store-brand items, switching to discount stores or simply buying fewer items like snacks or gourmet foods.


More Americans are buying used cars, too, rather than new, forcing some dealers to provide discounts on new cars again. But the growing consumer pushback to what critics condemn as price-gouging has been most evident with food as well as with consumer goods like paper towels and napkins.


In recent months, consumer resistance has led large food companies to respond by sharply slowing their price increases from the peaks of the past three years. This doesn't mean grocery prices will fall back to their levels of a few years ago, though with some items, including eggs, apples and milk, prices are below their peaks. But the milder increases in food prices should help further cool overall inflation, which is down sharply from a peak of 9.1% in 2022 to 3.1%.




Public frustration with prices has become a central issue in President Joe Biden’s bid for re-election. Polls show that despite the dramatic decline in inflation, many consumers are unhappy that prices remain so much higher than they were before inflation began accelerating in 2021.


Biden has echoed the criticism of many left-leaning economists that corporations jacked up their prices more than was needed to cover their own higher costs, allowing themselves to boost their profits. The White House has also attacked “shrinkflation,” whereby a company, rather than raising the price of a product, instead shrinks the amount inside the package. In a video released on Super Bowl Sunday, Biden denounced shrinkflation as a “rip-off.”


Consumer pushback against high prices suggests to many economists that inflation should further ease. That would make this bout of inflation markedly different from the debilitating price spikes of the 1970s and early 1980s, which took longer to defeat. When high inflation persists, consumers often develop an inflationary psychology: Ever-rising prices lead them to accelerate their purchases before costs rise further, a trend that can itself perpetuate inflation.


“That was the fear — that everybody would tolerate higher prices,” said Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY, a consulting firm, who notes that it hasn't happened. “I don't think we've moved into a high inflation regime.”




Instead, this time many consumers have reacted like Stuart Dryden, a commercial underwriter at a bank who lives in Arlington, Virginia. On a recent trip to his regular grocery store, Dryden, 37, pointed out big price disparities between Kraft Heinz-branded products and their store-label competitors, which he now favors.


Dryden, for example, loves cream cheese and bagels. A 12-ounce tub of Kraft's Philadelphia cream cheese costs $6.69. The store brand, he noted, is just $3.19.


A 24-pack of Kraft single cheese slices is $7.69; the store label, $2.99. And a 32-ounce Heinz ketchup bottle is $6.29, while the alternative is just $1.69. Similar gaps existed with mac-and-cheese and shredded cheese products.


“Just those five products together already cost nearly $30,” Dryden said. The alternatives were less than half that, he calculated, at about $13.


“I’ve been trying private-label options, and the quality is the same and it’s almost a no-brainer to switch from the products I used to buy a ton of to just the private label," Dryden said.


Alex Abraham, a spokesman for Kraft Heinz, said that its costs rose 3% in the final three months of last year but that the company raised its own prices only 1%.


“We are doing everything possible to find efficiencies in our factories and other parts of our business to offset and mitigate further price increases,” Abraham said.


Last week, Kraft Heinz said sales fell in the final three months of last year as more consumers traded down to cheaper brands.


Dryden has taken other steps to save money: A year ago, he moved into a new apartment after his previous landlord jacked up his rent by about 50%. His former apartment had been next to a relatively pricey grocery store, Whole Foods. Now, he shops at a nearby Amazon Fresh and has started visiting the discount grocer Aldi every couple of weeks.


Samuel Rines, an investment strategist at Corbu, says that PepsiCo, Kimberly-Clark, Procter & Gamble and many other consumer food and packaged goods companies exploited the rise in input costs stemming from supply-chain disruptions and Russia's invasion of Ukraine to dramatically raise their prices — and increase their profits — in 2021 and 2022.


A contributing factor was that millions of Americans enjoyed solid wage gains and received stimulus checks and other government aid, making it easier for them to pay the higher prices.


Still, some decried the phenomenon as “greedflation." And in a March 2023 research paper, the economist Isabella Weber at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, referred to it as “seller's inflation.”


Yet beginning late last year, many of the same companies discovered that the strategy was no longer working. Most consumers have now long since spent the savings they built up during the pandemic.


Lower-income consumers, in particular, are running up credit card debt and falling behind on their payments. Americans overall are spending more cautiously. Daco notes that overall sales during the holiday shopping season were up just 4% — and most of it reflected higher prices rather than consumers actually buying more things.


As an example, Rines points to Unilever, which makes, among other items, Hellman's mayonnaise, Ben & Jerry's ice cream and Dove soaps. Unilever jacked up its prices 13.3% on average across its brands in 2022. Its sales volume fell 3.6% that year. In response, it raised prices just 2.8% last year; sales rose 1.8%.


“We're beginning to see the consumer no longer willing to take the higher pricing,” Rines said. “So companies were beginning to get a little bit more skeptical of their ability to just have price be the driver of their revenues. They had to have those volumes come back, and the consumer wasn’t reacting in a way that they were pleased with.”


Unilever itself recently attributed poor sales performance in Europe to “share losses to private labels.”


Other businesses have noticed, too. After their sales fell in the final three months of last year, PepsiCo executives signaled that this year they would rein in price increases and focus more on boosting sales.


“In 2024, we see ... normalization of the cost, normalization of inflation,” CEO Ramon Laguarta said. “So we see everything trending back to our long-term” pricing trends.


Jeffrey Harmening, CEO of General Mills, which makes Cheerios, Chex Cereal, Progresso soups and dozens of other brands, has acknowledged that his customers are increasingly seeking bargains.


And McDonald's executives have said that consumers with incomes below $45,000 are visiting less and spending less when they do visit and say the company plans to highlight its lower-priced items.


“Consumers are more wary — and weary — of pricing, and we’re going to continue to be consumer-led in our pricing decisions,” Ian Borden, the company's chief financial officer, told investors.


Officials at the Federal Reserve, the nation's primary inflation-fighting institution, have cited consumers' growing reluctance to pay high prices as a key reason why they expect inflation to fall steadily back to their 2% annual target.


“Firms are telling us that price sensitivity is very much higher now,” Mary Daly, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and a member of the Fed's interest-rate setting committee, said last week. “Consumers don't want to purchase unless they're seeing a 10% discount. ... This is a serious improvement in the role that consumers play in bridling inflation.”


Surveys by the Fed's regional banks have found that companies across all industries expect to impose smaller price increases this year. The New York Fed says companies in its region plan to raise prices an average of about 3% this year, down from about 5% in 2023 and as much as 7% to 9% in 2022.


Such trends suggest that companies were well on their way to slowing their price hikes before Biden's most recent attacks on price gouging.


Claudia Sahm, founder of SAHM Consulting and a former Fed economist, said, “consumers are more powerful than President Biden.”

## Productivity Surge Helps Explain US Economy's Surprising Resilience

date: 2024-02-25, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Trying to keep up with customer demand, Batesville Tool & Die began seeking 70 people to hire last year. It wasn't easy. Attracting factory workers to a community of 7,300 in the Indiana countryside was a tough sell, especially having to compete with big-name manufacturers nearby like Honda and Cummins Engine. 


Job seekers were scarce. 


"You could count on one hand how many people in the town were unemployed," said Jody Fledderman, the CEO. "It was just crazy.'' 


Batesville Tool & Die managed to fill just 40 of its vacancies. 


Enter the robots. The company invested in machines that could mimic human workers and in vision systems, which helped its robots "see" what they were doing. 


The Batesville experience has been replicated countlessly across the United States the past couple of years. Worker shortages have led many companies to invest in machines. They've also been training the workers they do have to use advanced technology so they can produce more with less. 


The result has been an unexpected productivity boom, which helps explain a great economic mystery: How has the world's largest economy stayed so healthy, with brisk growth and low unemployment, despite brutally high interest rates that are intended to tame inflation but that typically cause a recession? 


To economists, strong productivity growth provides an almost magical elixir. When companies roll out more efficient technology, their workers can become more productive: They increase their output per hour. A result is that companies can often boost profits and raise pay without having to jack up prices. Inflation can remain in check. 


The Fed's aggressive streak of rate hikes — 11 of them starting in March 2022 — managed to bring inflation from a four-decade high of 9.1% to 3.1%. But, to the surprise to the economists who'd forecast a recession, the higher borrowing costs have caused little economic hardship. 




Perhaps the likeliest explanation is the greater efficiencies that companies like Batesville Tool & Die have managed to achieve. Before productivity began its resurgent growth last year, a rule of thumb was that average hourly pay could rise no more than 3.5% annually for inflation to stay within the Fed's 2% target. That would mean that today's roughly 4% average annual pay growth would have to shrink. Higher productivity means there's now more leeway for wage growth to stay elevated without igniting inflation. 


The productivity boom marks a shift from the pre-pandemic years, when annual productivity growth averaged a tepid 1.5%. Everything changed as the economy rocketed out of the 2020 pandemic recession with unexpected vigor, and businesses struggled to re-hire the many workers they had shed. 


The resulting worker shortage sent wages surging. Inflation jumped, too, as factories and ports buckled under the strain of rising consumer orders. 


Desperate, many companies turned to automation. The efficiency payoff began to arrive almost a year ago. Labor productivity rose at a 3.6% annual pace from last April through June, 4.9% from July through September and 3.2% from October through December. 




At Reata Engineering & Machine Works, "efficiency was kind of forced on us,'' CEO Grady Cope said. With the job market roaring, the company, based in Englewood, Colorado, couldn't hire fast enough. Meantime, its customers were starting to balk at paying higher prices. 


So Reata installed robots and other technology. Software allowed it to automate the delivery of price quotes to customers. That process used to require two weeks. Now, it can be done in 24 hours. 


Many economists and business people say they're hopeful that the productivity boom can continue. Artificial intelligence, they note, is only beginning to penetrate factory floors, warehouses, stores and offices and could accelerate efficiency gains. 


Automation raises fears that machines will replace human workers, killing jobs. Some workers supplanted by robots do often struggle to find new work and end up settling for lower pay. 


Yet history suggests that in the long run, technological improvements actually create more jobs than they destroy. People are needed to build, upgrade, repair and operate sophisticated machines. Some displaced workers are trained to shift into such jobs. And that transition is likely to be eased this time by the retirement of the vast baby boom generation, which is causing labor shortages. 


Some of today's productivity gains may be coming not just from advanced technology but also from more satisfied workers. The tight labor markets of the past three years allowed Americans to change jobs and find others that pay better and make them happier and more productive. 


Justin Thompson, of Kalamazoo, Michigan, felt burned out by his job as a police officer, with its 16-hour workdays ."I was literally running myself into the ground,'' he said. 


Thompson's wife saw a job posting for operations manager at a charter airline. Even without airline experience, his wife felt he could use skills he gains as a Marine Corps infantryman — handling logistics for missions — during tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. 


She was right. Omni Air International hired him in 2019. 


Thompson, 43, loves the new job, which allows him to work from home when he's not traveling. And his Marine experience — which included developing ways to improve efficiency — has proved invaluable. 


Other workers have switched from low-skill jobs to those that allow them to be more productive. 


At Reata Engineering, staffers were trained to use new sophisticated equipment. 


"The whole point is not to lay people off,'' said Cope, the CEO of Reata Engineering. "The point is to make people do jobs that are more interesting'' — and pay better, too.

## Republican Trying to Block Party From Paying Trump's Legal Bills

date: 2024-02-25, from: VOA News USA

COLUMBIA, S.C.  — At least one member of the Republican National Committee is working to slow Donald Trump's attempted takeover of the organization by pushing to keep the committee neutral until Trump is officially the presidential nominee and avoid picking up his legal bills.


Two draft resolutions are being circulated by Henry Barbour, a national committeeman from Mississippi, for consideration at the RNC's upcoming March meeting in Houston. Barbour said support for the resolutions among RNC members is growing but he does not yet have the needed co-sponsors, and any resolutions would ultimately be nonbinding.


The effort comes after Trump last week publicly called to replace the RNC's current leaders and install one of his senior campaign advisers and his daughter-in-law Lara Trump in top roles. Lara Trump suggested earlier in the week that GOP voters would support the committee paying her father-in-law's legal bills as he faces a raft of criminal and civil indictments.


Trump senior campaign adviser Chris LaCivita, whom the former president wants to install as the party's chief operating officer, told reporters Friday night that the RNC would not pay Trump's legal bills.


In a statement on Saturday, LaCavita said "the primary is over and it is the RNC's sole responsibility to defeat Joe Biden and win back the White House."


"Efforts to delay that assist Joe Biden in the destruction of our nation," he said. "Republicans cannot stand on the sidelines and allow this to happen."


One of Barbour's proposed resolutions says that the RNC and its leadership will stay neutral throughout the presidential primary and not take on additional staff from any of the active campaigns until a candidate has the needed delegates to be the nominee.


The second resolution says the organization will not pay the legal bills of any candidate for federal or state office but will instead focus its spending on efforts directly related to the 2024 election.


"The RNC has one job. That's winning elections," Barbour said. "I believe RNC funds should be spent solely on winning elections, on political expenses, not legal bills."


The RNC was paying some of Trump's legal bills for New York cases that started while he was president, The Washington Post reported. But current RNC Chairperson Ronna McDaniel said in November 2022 that the RNC would stop p


aying once Trump became a candidate again and started running for the 2024 presidential election.


Trump is spending millions on lawyers in civil cases and four criminal cases, but he also has legal debts that top half a billion dollars.


Former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, who is Trump's last major challenger in the GOP primary, said a family member or campaign manager should not be leading the RNC.


"I would hope that the people in the RNC know that they have a responsibility, a responsibility to put in people in the RNC who are going to look out in the best interest of all of the Republican Party, not just one person," Haley said.


The resolutions were first reported by The Dispatch on Saturday.

## Cops & Computers

date: 2024-02-25, from: Chris Coyier blog

I watched the Netflix Documentary American Nightmare. It feels like standard fare at this point, where we dip back a decade or two to some crime story that had a few twists and turns in it and make it freshly popcorn worthy again. This was the &#8220;is this the real life Gone Girl?&#8221; case. Denise [&#8230;]

## New York City Owl Flaco Dies After Crashing Into Building

date: 2024-02-25, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — Tributes poured in Saturday for Flaco, the beloved Eurasian eagle-owl that became a feel-good New York story after escaping its Central Park Zoo enclosure and flying free around Manhattan.


Flaco was found dead on a New York City sidewalk Friday night after apparently flying into a building. It was a heartbreaking end for the birders who documented the owl's daily movements and the legions of admirers who eagerly followed along.


"Everybody feels the same, they're devastated," said Nicole Blair, a New York City artist who devoted much of her feed on the X platform to photos and memes featuring the celebrity owl with checkerboard black and brown feathers and round sunset-hued eyes.


Staff from the Wild Bird Fund, a wildlife rehabilitation center, declared Flaco dead shortly after the collision. A necropsy was expected Saturday.


Flaco was freed from his cage at the zoo a little over a year ago by a vandal who breached a waist-high fence and cut a hole through a steel mesh cage. The owl had arrived at the zoo as a fledgling 13 years earlier.


Flaco sightings soon became sport. The owl spent his days perched on tree branches, fence posts and fire escapes and nights hooting atop water towers and preying on the city's abundant rats.


Like a true celebrity, the owl appeared on murals and merchandise. A likeness occupied a spot on Blair's New York City-themed Christmas tree, right next to "Pizza Rat," the infamous rodent seen in a YouTube clip dragging a slice down a subway stairwell.


"I got to see him on my birthday," Blair said of her encounter with Flaco in Central Park in the fall. "It was kind of an unbelievable situation, and I'm like, this is the best birthday present ever."


But she and others worried when Flaco ventured beyond the park into more urban sections of Manhattan, fearing the owl would ingest a poisoned rat or encounter other dangers.


"The vandal who damaged Flaco's exhibit jeopardized the safety of the bird and is ultimately responsible for his death," the zoo said in a statement Friday. "We are still hopeful that the NYPD which is investigating the vandalism will ultimately make an arrest."


Flaco fans shared suggestions Saturday for a permanent bronze statue overlooking New York City. One requested that the owl's remains be buried in Central Park.


"Flaco the owl was, in many ways, a typical New Yorker — fiercely independent, constantly exploring, finding ways to survive ever-changing challenges," read a post on the X platform, reflecting a common sentiment. "He will be missed."


David Barrett, who runs the Manhattan Bird Alert account, suggested a temporary memorial at the bird's favorite oak tree in the park.


There, he wrote in a post, fellow birders could "lay flowers, leave a note, or just be with others who loved Flaco."

## Trump Wins South Carolina, Closing In On Republican Nomination

date: 2024-02-25, from: VOA News USA

charleston, south carolina  — Donald Trump won South Carolina's Republican primary on Saturday, easily beating former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley in her home state and further consolidating his path to a third straight Republican nomination.


Trump has now swept every contest that counted for Republican delegates, adding to previous wins in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Haley is facing growing pressure to leave the race but says she's not going anywhere despite losing the state where she was governor from 2011-17.


A rematch between Trump and President Joe Biden is becoming increasingly inevitable. Haley has vowed to stay in the race through at least the batch of primaries on March 5, known as Super Tuesday, but was unable to dent Trump's momentum in her home state despite holding far more campaign events and arguing that the indictments against Trump will hamstring him against Biden.


The Associated Press declared Trump the winner as polls closed statewide at 7 p.m. That race call was based on an analysis of AP VoteCast, a comprehensive survey of Republican South Carolina primary voters. The survey confirmed the findings of pre-Election Day polls showing Trump far outpacing Haley statewide.


"I have never seen the Republican Party so unified as it is right now," Trump declared, taking the stage for his victory speech mere moments after polls closed. He added, "You can celebrate for about 15 minutes, but then we have to get back to work."


South Carolina's first-in-the-South primary has historically been a reliable bellwether for Republicans. In all but one primary since 1980, the Republican winner in South Carolina has gone on to be the party's nominee. The lone exception was Newt Gingrich in 2012.


Trump was dominant across the state, even leading in Lexington County, which Haley represented in the state Legislature. Many Trump-backing South Carolinians, even some who previously supported Haley during her time as governor, weren't willing to give her a home-state bump.


"She's done some good things," Davis Paul, 36, said about Haley as he waited for Trump at a recent rally in Conway. "But I just don't think she's ready to tackle a candidate like Trump. I don't think many people can."




At Haley headquarters on Saturday night, supporters waved her signs in front of a large projection screen showing Trump's speech, blocking it from view. That, of course, didn't make the defeat any less crushing.


About an hour later, Haley took the stage and said: "What I saw today was South Carolina's frustration with our country's direction. I've seen that same frustration nationwide."


"I don't believe Donald Trump can beat Joe Biden," Haley said, later adding: "I said earlier this week that no matter what happens in South Carolina, I would continue to run. I'm a woman of my word."


She said she plans to head to Michigan for its primary on Tuesday — the last major contest before Super Tuesday. Still, she faces questions about where she might be able to win a contest or be competitive.


Trump and Biden are already behaving like they expect to face off in November.


Trump and his allies argue Biden has made the U.S. weaker and point to the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan and Russia's decision to launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Trump has also repeatedly attacked Biden over high inflation earlier in the president's term and his handling of record-high migrant crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border.


Trump has questioned — often in harshly personal terms — whether the 81-year-old Biden is too old to serve a second term. Biden's team in turn has highlighted the 77-year-old Trump's own flubs on the campaign trail.


Biden has stepped up his recent fundraising trips around the country and increasingly attacked Trump directly. He's called Trump and his "Make America Great Again" movement dire threats to the nation's founding principles, and the president's reelection campaign has lately focused most of its attention on Trump suggesting he'd use the first day of a second presidency as a dictator and that he'd tell Russia to attack NATO allies who fail to keep up with defense spending obligations mandated by the alliance.




Haley also criticized Trump on his NATO comments and also for questioning why her husband wasn't on the campaign trail with her — even as former first lady Melania Trump hasn't appeared with him. Maj. Michael Haley is deployed in the Horn of Africa on a mission with the South Carolina Army National Guard.


But South Carolina's Republican voters line up with Trump on having lukewarm feelings about NATO and continued U.S. support for Ukraine, according to AP VoteCast data from Saturday's primary. About 6 in 10 oppose continuing aid to Ukraine in its fight against Russia. Only about a third described America's participation in NATO as "very good," with more saying it's only "somewhat good."


Haley has raised copious amounts of campaign money and is scheduled to begin a cross-country campaign swing on Sunday in Michigan ahead of Super Tuesday on March 5, when many delegate-rich states hold primaries.


But it's unclear how she can stop Trump from clinching enough delegates to become the party's presumptive nominee for the third time.


Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., complimented Haley while speaking to reporters at Trump's election night party in Columbia but suggested it was time for her to drop out.


"I think the sooner she does, the better for her, the better for the party," Graham said. Later, the senator was greeted with boos after Trump called him to the stage to address those gathered.


Trump's political strength has endured despite facing 91 criminal charges related to his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss to Biden, the discovery of classified documents in his Florida residence and allegations that he secretly arranged payoffs to a porn actress.


The former president's first criminal trial is set to begin on March 25 in New York, where he faces 34 counts of falsifying business records related to hush money paid to porn star Stormy Daniels in the closing weeks of his 2016 presidential campaign.


Biden won South Carolina's Democratic primary earlier this month and faces only one remaining challenger, Dean Phillips. The Minnesota Democratic congressman has continued to campaign in Michigan ahead of the Democratic primary there, despite having little chance of actually beating Biden.


Though Biden is expected to cruise to his party's renomination, he faces criticism from some Democrats for providing military backing to Israel in its war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Some in his party support a ceasefire as the death toll in Israel's war has reached 30,000 people, two-thirds of them women and children. The war could hurt the president's general election chances in swing states like Michigan, which is home to a large Arab American population.

## Marginalia: 3 Years

date: 2024-02-25, from: Marginallia log

It&rsquo;s been three years since the inception of Marginalia Search, then a dinky experiment to find where the heck the cool Internet has gone, now my full time job.
While there&rsquo;s always things that can be improved, it&rsquo;s fair to say the search engine has never worked as well as it does right now.
A great number of milestones have been reached, perhaps biggest of all the search engine has moved out of my living room and into a proper enterprise server.

## A Text Oriented Web

date: 2024-02-25, from: Robert's Ramblings

The web is a busy place. There seems to be a gestalt resonant at the moment on the web that can be summarized by two phrases, "back to basics" and "simplification". It is not the first time I've seen this nor is it likely the last. This blog post describes a thought experiment about a simplification with minimal invention and focus on feature elimination. It's a way to think about the web status quo a little differently. My intention is to explore the implications of a more text centered web experience that could coexist as a subset of today's web.

I think the following could form the "good stuff" in a Crockford[^1] sense of pairing things down to the essential.

- the transport layer should remain HTTP but be limited to a few methods (GET, POST and HEAD) and the common header elements (e.g. length, content-type come to mind)
- The trio of HTML, CSS and JavaScript is really complex, swap this out for Markdown augmented with YAML (Markdown and YAML already have a synergy in Markdown processors like Pandoc)
- A Web form is expressed using GHYITS[^2], it is delimited in the Markdown document by the familiar "`^---$`" block element, web form content would be encoded as YAML in the body of the POST using the content type "`application/x-yaml`".
- Content would be served using the `text/markdown; charset: utf-8` content type already commonly used to identify Markdown content distinct from `plain/text`

I need a nice name for describing the arrangement of Markdown+YAML over HTTP arrangement. Is the descriptive acronym for "text oriented web", i.e. "tow", enough? Does it already have a meaning in software or the web? Would the protocol be "tow://"? I really need something a bit more clever and catchy if this is going to proceed beyond a thought experiment.
