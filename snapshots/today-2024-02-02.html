Most of Banana Pi’s single-board computers are powered by ARM-based
processors. But the upcoming Banana Pi BPI-F3 has a RISC-V processor
instead. The company says the SpacemiT RISC-V K1 processor selected for
this board is a 64-bit, 8-core chip with single-core performance
comparable to what you’d expect from a 1.3 GHz ARM Cortex-A55 processor.

Employers Added Surprisingly Robust 353,000 Jobs In January</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The nation’s employers delivered a stunning burst of
hiring to begin 2024, adding 353,000 jobs in January in the latest sign
of the economy’s continuing ability to shrug off the highest interest
rates in two decades.</p>
<p>Friday’s government report showed that last month’s job gain — far
above what economists had predicted — topped the December gain of
333,000, a figure that was itself revised sharply higher. The
unemployment rate stayed at 3.7%, just above a half-century low.</p>
<p>Wages rose unexpectedly fast in January, too. Average hourly pay
climbed a sharp 0.6% from December, the fastest monthly gain in nearly
two years, and 4.5% from January 2023. The strong hiring and wage growth
could complicate or delay the Federal Reserve’s intention to start
cutting interest rates later this year.</p>
<p>The latest gains showcased employers’ willingness to keep hiring to
meet steady consumer spending. It comes as the intensifying presidential
campaign is pivoting in no small part on views of President Joe Biden’s
economic stewardship. Public polls show widespread dissatisfaction
largely because even though inflation has sharply slowed, most prices
remain well above pre-pandemic levels. Some recent surveys, though, show
public approval gradually improving.</p>
<p>This week, the Fed took note of the economy’s durability, with Chair
Jerome Powell saying “the economy is performing well, the labor market
remains strong.” The central bank made clear that while it’s nearing a
long-awaited shift toward cutting interest rates, it’s in no hurry to do
so.</p>
<p>The details in Friday’s jobs report pointed to broad hiring gains
across the economy. Professional and business services, a category that
includes managers and technical workers, added 74,000 jobs. Healthcare
companies added 70,000, retailers 45,000, governments at all levels
36,000 and manufacturers 23,000.</p>
<p>The unemployment rate has now come in below 4% for two straight
years, the longest such streak since the 1960s.</p>
<p>“Overall, the labor market remains strong and continues to defy
expectations of a softening,’’ said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S.
economist at High Frequency Economics.”For Fed officials, these data
strongly support patience on rate cuts. Policymakers will be in no rush
to lower rates if job and wage growth continue to be robust over coming
months.’’</p>
<p>To fight inflation, the Fed raised its benchmark rate 11 times
beginning in March 2022. The higher borrowing costs were widely expected
to boost unemployment and likely cause a recession. Yet the economy has
managed to deliver enough job growth to avoid a downturn without
accelerating inflation pressures. Inflation cooled throughout 2023,
making it likelier that the Fed would achieve a “soft landing” — taming
inflation without derailing the economy.</p>
<p>A series of high-profile layoff announcements, from the likes of UPS,
Google and Amazon, have raised some concerns about whether they might
herald the start of a wave of job cuts. Yet measured against the
nation’s vast labor force, the recent layoffs haven’t been significant
enough to make a dent in the overall job market. Historically speaking,
layoffs are still relatively low, hiring is still solid and the
unemployment rate is still consistent with a healthy economy.</p>
<p>Consumers as a whole have proved more resilient than expected in the
face of the Fed’s rate hikes. Having socked away savings during the
pandemic, most were willing to spend it as the economy reopened. And a
wave of early retirements, some of them related to COVID-19, limited the
number of people available for work and contributed to a tight labor
market.</p>
<p>The gradual improvement in public confidence has emerged in a series
of recent surveys. A measure of consumer sentiment by the University of
Michigan has jumped in the past two months by the most since 1991. A
survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York found that Americans’
inflation expectations have reached their lowest point in nearly three
years. And a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public
Affairs Research found that 35% of U.S. adults call the national economy
good, up from 30% who said so late last year.</p>
<p>The rate at which Americans are quitting their jobs, considered a
reliable predictor of wage trends, has slowed to pre-pandemic levels.
That suggests that workers have grown somewhat less confident of finding
a better job elsewhere. Employers, as a result, may be less likely to
feel pressure to raise wages to keep them — and to increase their prices
to make up for their higher labor costs. That cycle can perpetuate
inflation.</p>

THE TOP FIVE
</h2>
<h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Volvo splits with Polestar</li>
</ol>
</h3>
<p>
Yesterday, Swedish automaker Volvo announced it is pulling funding from
Polestar, its EV arm, which has struggled to gain a foothold in the
market. As Jennifer Mossalgue
<a href="https://electrek.co/2024/02/01/volvo-breaks-up-with-polestar-and-sees-its-stock-soar/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reports</a>
in <em>Electrek</em>, Polestar is bleeding cash — it announced plans to
cut 15% of its workforce last week, and needs a billion-dollar cash
infusion over the next year to stay in business. Polestar will instead
become the purview of Volvo parent company Geely, owned by Chinese
billionaire Li Shufu.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Tesla settles lawsuit over water pollution
</h3>
<p>
Yesterday, a judge in California’s San Joaquin County
<a href="https://sfdistrictattorney.org/press-release/tesla-inc-settles-environmental-enforcement-action-brought-by-california-district-attorneys/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ordered</a>
Tesla to pay $1.5 million to settle a lawsuit brought by more than two
dozen counties, including Los Angeles and San Francisco, for mislabeling
hazardous waste and sending it to landfills that could not accept the
particular substances, including “paint materials, brake fluids, used
batteries, antifreeze and diesel fuel.” The lawsuit alleged that at
least 101 facilities violated California’s waste management laws,
including the factory in Fremont. The electric vehicle-maker has had
multiple previous tangles with the Environmental Protection Agency over
pollution from its factories.
</p>
<p>
“While electric vehicles may benefit the environment, the manufacturing
and servicing of these vehicles still generates many harmful waste
streams,” said San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins in a press
release. “Today’s settlement against Tesla, Inc. serves to provide a
cleaner environment for citizens throughout the state by preventing the
contamination of our precious natural resources when hazardous waste is
mismanaged and unlawfully disposed.”

that would direct the EPA to study the environmental impacts of
artificial intelligence. It also asks the National Institute of

voluntarily report those impacts. AI, like

<li>Rooftop solar’s woes continue</li>
</ol>
</h3>
<p>
Earlier this week the software company Aurora Solar laid off 20% of its
500-person staff, about a year after it raised $200 million in a Series
D round.
</p>
<p>
“Like many other companies in the solar industry, we’ve felt the effects
of larger macroeconomic challenges, including higher interest rates and
the impact of NEM 3.0 in California,” Aurora Solar
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/30/aurora-solar-layoffs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a>
Tim De Chant at <em>TechCrunch</em>.
</p>
<p>
NEM 3.0 is California’s latest iteration of a net metering regulation.
Under the new structure, which came into effect in April of last year,
compensation rates for solar customers in the state dropped by about
75%, which means rooftop solar is no longer the steal deal it once was.
</p>
<p>
The news is the latest in a series of signs that the rooftop solar
industry is in a tough spot at the moment — as Alana Semuels
<a href="https://time.com/6565415/rooftop-solar-industry-collapse/https://time.com/6565415/rooftop-solar-industry-collapse/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a>
in <em>Time</em> last week, more than 100 residential solar-related
companies declared bankruptcy in 2023 alone.

<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Otters are inadvertent erosion fighters</li>
</ol>
</h3>
<p>
Sea otters are playing a crucial role in stopping estuaries in
California from eroding away, according to a
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00217-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">delightfully-titled</a>
article in <em>Nature</em>. After conservation efforts succeeded in
helping sea otter populations in the state rebound from the brink of
extinction, researchers found that the animals were inadvertently
stopping salt marshes like Monterey Bay’s Elkhorn Slough from washing
away by eating the crabs that were picking at vegetation that keeps the
sandy banks of the marsh together. Erosion in the areas where otters
returned slowed from 30 centimeters a year to 10 centimeters a year.
</p>
<p>
“It’s remarkable when you think about it,” Jane Watson, a community
ecologist at Vancouver Island University in Nanaimo, Canada, told
<em>Nature’s </em>Jude Coleman. “You can have a single animal, the sea
otter, come in and through predation actually mitigate the effects of
erosion.”
</p>

THE KICKER
</h2>
<p>
It’s cloudy with a chance of flurries in Punxsutawney, PA, where the
eponymous rodent is scheduled to make his prediction for Groundhog Day,
and the <em>Washington Post</em>’s Kasha Patel has a story about it
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/02/01/groundhog-day-prediction-spring-winter/" target="_blank">told
entirely in verse.</a> Punxsutawney Phil, Patel notes, has a bit of
competition these days:
</p>
<p>
“The National Weather Service issues seasonal outlooks based on computer
models and science. They do not have a groundhog for reliance.”

Self-Enforcing Protocol to Solve Gerrymandering</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-02, updated: 2024-01-26, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>

In 2009,

wrote</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
There are several ways two people can divide a piece of cake in half.
One way is to find someone impartial to do it for them. This works, but
it requires another person. Another way is for one person to divide the
piece, and the other person to complain (to the police, a judge, or his
parents) if he doesn’t think it’s fair. This also works, but still
requires another person—­at least to resolve disputes. A third way is for
one person to do the dividing, and for the other person to choose the
half he wants.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The point is that unlike protocols that require a neutral third party to
complete (arbitrated), or protocols that require that neutral third
party to resolve disputes (adjudicated), self-enforcing protocols just
work. Cut-and-choose works because neither side can cheat. And while the
math can get really complicated, the idea …

<h2 id="pb-winnie-lim">P&amp;B : Winnie Lim</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-02, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<p>
This is the 23rd edition of <em>People and Blogs</em>, the series where
I ask interesting people to talk about themselves and their blogs. Today
we have Winnie Lim and her blog,
<a href="https://winnielim.org">winnielim.org</a>
</p>
<p>
I first discovered Winnie’s website thanks to the recomendation of
<a href="https://longest.voyage">Jamie Crisman</a> who’s been featured
on the series a couple of months ago. I had her site listed on my
spreadheet and was planning to contact her so imagine my surprise when
she appeared as a supporter on my Ko-Fi page! It was such a delightful
moment. I love to be able to feature people who are supporters of the
series because it gives this fun project a sense of community.
</p>

</p>
<hr />
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Let's start from the basics: can you introduce
yourself?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
This is Winnie, and I’m from
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore">Singapore</a> where
I’ve spent most of my life except a few years when I worked in San
Francisco. I was a self-taught designer in both print and digital from
2000-2016 before I had to quit due to chronic migraines and
photosensitivity.
</p>
<p>
I don’t have any hobbies per se in the sense of things I enjoy doing
because I seem to
<a href="https://winnielim.org/journal/my-mind-the-invisible-loudspeaker/">lack
the ability to feel pleasure</a>, but I do a variety of things that
enrich me: reading, exercise, photography, learning, and I am trying to
pick up drawing. Perhaps one day I would like to learn how to play the
keyboard.
</p>
<p>
I try to publish at least once a week, mostly documenting my life and
struggles with both my health and existence.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>What's the story behind your blog?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I got really into learning how to make websites when I had my first
computer at 15 all the way back in 1996. So my first website was on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoCities">Geocities</a>. It felt
like a natural progression to start blogging when I saw other people
start doing it in the late 90s. My first blog was on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greymatter_(software)">Greymatter</a>
on a now defunct domain. I would just post links to websites I liked and
perhaps some emo poetry. A while later my friend introduced me to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LiveJournal">Livejournal</a>,
which is interesting to me till this day because the inherent culture
and dynamics of it encouraged people to pour out their feelings on it. I
don’t know if I am rewriting my own history but I feel like Livejournal
was instrumental in the process in setting the tone of my writing till
today. It gave me the idea that writing my feelings out to some
invisible audience could be somewhat therapeutic. One thing that is now
permanently gone from the Livejournal era is the ability to easily
follow and like your friend’s blog, and publish only to your network of
friends. I hope something like this can exist on federated systems one
day.
</p>
<p>
Sadly Livejournal got sold, and I moved to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vox_(blogging_platform)">Vox</a>,
which also got sold, then to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterous">Posterous</a> – well
you get the idea. I finally bought the domain winnielim.org sometime in
2012 and set up my blog there. I had loved the network effects and
community of early twitter, so when Medium came along I got a job there,
hence publishing exclusively there for a while, continued even after I
left the job but stopped when it started putting up paywalls. My
personal lived history of the internet has taught me it is really
important to have our own domain. It is not just about the ownership of
content but it is sad when urls go dead.
</p>
<p>
I felt very alienated and lonely as a young person in the 1990s. It was
incredible to discover the internet and know there is an entire world
out there, that there are actually many people living diverse lives that
were not visible or encouraged in Singapore. Reading people’s vulnerable
and honest writing on their blogs made me feel like I was not alone. So
I try to pay it forward by doing the same with my writing.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>What does your creative process look like when it comes to
blogging?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
Since 2013 I mostly just turn up every Sunday, and start writing. Half
the time I have no idea what I’m writing about till I finish writing it.
The other times I have an idea but it becomes something else entirely in
the writing process. They call it intuitive writing I guess. Once in a
long while I write <a href="https://winnielim.org/book-reviews/">book
reviews</a> or essays to share something in a more structured way. Those
take considerable focus and multiple-sittings, so I don’t do it very
often.
</p>
<p>
I do publish more frequently than weekly if I get inspired or if
circumstances encourage it, like my recent trip to Japan where I tried
to <a href="https://winnielim.org/tag/japan2023/">travel blog during the
trip</a>.
</p>
<p>
I’ve tried writing “proper” pieces before where there is a ton of
editing and proofreading by other people, but I didn’t enjoy the
process. It made me feel disconnected from the writing. Some of these
pieces did very well, which made me realise that being able to write
however I want is more important than views.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe
the physical space influences your creativity?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I do believe that physical space influences creativity. I constantly
feel inspired in a place like Japan, where the culture itself has
aesthetic and creative elements. But I also believe it is important to
cultivate a capacity to be creative anywhere, because sometimes in life
we get caught in circumstances and environments that are not ideal.
</p>
<p>
I try to keep my entire home a creative environment. It is not one of
those beautiful minimalistic environments like you see in youtube
videos. It is more like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zakka">zakka style</a>, where it
contains things that feel creative to me: lots of
(<a href="https://www.instagram.com/launshae">my partner</a>’s) artwork
hung up on the walls, tons of books, art materials and tools, a warm and
cosy space that feels psychologically safe. A lot of it is thanks to my
partner who is an artist and an efficient organiser.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your
tech stack?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I use <a href="https://opalstack.com/">Opalstack</a> as my webhost, they
offer VPS-like hosting but managed. I chose them because I used to use
Webfaction, which got sold. For a few years in between I hosted my
website on a droplet at Digital Ocean, but I decided managing my own
server is too tedious.
</p>
<p>
Like many others I use
<a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">Namecheap</a> for my domains. It
was highly recommended in the 2000s, so I used it and stuck with it
since I have no issues with it so far.
</p>
<p>
For the beginning few years my blog in its current incarnation was on
Jekyll, but it is now on Wordpress because I want to be able to
dynamically query it like
<a href="https://winnielim.org/experiments/website/this-website-as-a-learning-and-reflection-tool/">I
am querying my second brain</a>. I also use a plugin called
<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/pods/">Pods</a> that allows me to
create custom post types and surface relationships between them easily.
Everything is connected, and I want to demonstrate and understand these
connections. A blog post is not just a piece of writing to me. It is a
piece of my self, and these pieces track the process of my becoming.
Sometimes
<a href="https://winnielim.org/journal/remembering-forgotten-lessons-and-selves/">I
forget and I get lost</a>, so these pieces and connections help to
<a href="https://winnielim.org/journal/returning-to-ones-core/">bring me
back</a> to who I am and who I aspired to be. These are not things that
a static website can do, so I stay with Wordpress despite its obvious
issues.
</p>
<p>
It is also important to use something that has proven stability and
longevity.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would
you do anything differently?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I would host my own website using the same domain right from the start.
But given the highly-ephemeral and experimental nature of the web back
then, I think it would have been challenging not to hop on new
technologies and platforms, especially because I have an experimental
nature. But I am envious of blogs who ignored all of those things and
persistently stayed on their own domain or even on Blogger. It is such a
magnificent thing to see an archive that spans decades because on the
internet we create and destroy content like it doesn’t matter since it
is so easy to do so. Witnessing some permanence is beautiful when
everything is so transient.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Financial question since the web is obsessed with money: how
much does it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost or does it
generate some revenue? And what's your position on people monetising
personal blogs?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
For now Opalstack is $115 a year, and it costs $15 to renew my domain.
These costs increase every now and then. So roughly it is about $11 a
month, which is about 2 cups of coffee.
</p>
<p>
When I first quit my job I tried to use Patreon to gather monetary
support, not so much for my writing but for my interactive experiments.
However along with my chronic illness, that experience made me realise I
don’t have the personality required for this. I am too afraid of
rejection, and it also makes me deeply uncomfortable to the point of
being perpetually anxious when people <em>do</em> support me. It felt
stressful to try to upkeep something to some invisible expectations, and
during times when I fell sick and was unable to work on my projects I
felt like I was letting people down.
</p>
<p>
I do understand when people monetise blogs, but I hope it can be a model
where some people are supporting the content financially in order for
everybody else to read it free. This is because there is already deep
inequality in this world, and putting content behind pay walls is
exacerbating that inequality.
</p>
<p>
Having freely accessible information on the internet during the 90s
impacted my life so deeply, a major contributor to my career. I know it
changed so many people’s lives, and lifted people out of their poor
living circumstances. However I understand that it is the only source of
income for some people and paywalls are the only way to go for them. I
am encouraged by examples of people who are successful with the
some-supporters-pay-for-the-rest model though, like
<a href="https://kottke.org/members/">kottke.org</a>.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth
checking out? And also, who do you think I should be interviewing
next?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I love a ton of blogs – I have hundreds of blogs on my rss reader – so
it is difficult to pick a few, but if I really have to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://brainbaking.com/">Brain Baking</a>: Wouter writes
widely and deeply, a quality I really appreciate on the internet.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://ruk.ca/">Peter Rukavina</a>: classic example of
blogging that is rare these days – frequent, slice of life updates.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://popagandhi.com/">Popagandhi</a>: Adrianna has been a
huge inspiration for me because she has been writing transparently and
vulnerably since the early 2000s. She was writing about lgbtq when it
was still considered taboo (at least in Singapore), and till today
continues to write on some potentially divisive topics.
<a href="https://popagandhi.com/2005/01/the-eight-ages-of-a-woman/">Some
of her early writing</a> has this heartbreaking poetic quality.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/pb-eli-mellen">another</a> vote for
<a href="https://maya.land/">maya.land</a>: I’ve not seen a range of
topics like this anywhere else.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I also love <a href="https://blogroll.org/">blogroll.org</a> for always
recommending new interesting blogs to follow. I think Wouter of Brain
Baking would be a great interview subject.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Final question: is there anything you want to share with
us?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
The longevity of websites is something I still think about. I often
wonder
<a href="https://winnielim.org/journal/on-writing-to-exist-and-website-graveyards/">what
would happen to my website</a> after I pass on. I know of at least
<a href="https://www.sheldonbrown.com/">one great website</a> that is
being maintained by family and friends after the owner passed on, but
what would happen when they too are no longer around? There is this
attitude that websites are ephemeral and not important, but there is a
lot of richness, history and information within them that deserves to be
preserved. It would be sad that we didn’t try hard enough to keep them.
I know there is the <a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a>
that is doing great work, but I wish there was an option to keep a
website in its entirety. Wordpress has recently launched
<a href="https://wordpress.com/blog/2023/08/25/introducing-the-100-year-plan/">a
100-year plan</a>, but it is only for wordpress.com users and it costs
38k. I wish there are more viable solutions out there.
</p>
<p>
Finally, I hope people will not be afraid to pick up new skills, hobbies
or any learnings at any age. I recently started to
<a href="https://wynlimdraws.tumblr.com/">learn how to draw</a>, and I
think being unafraid of
<a href="https://winnielim.org/journal/daring-to-be-ugly/">“being
ugly”</a> or failure goes a long way. I see too many people not pursue
art/skills/hobbies because it is “too late”, “no talent”, or if they do
they give up because they cannot tolerate not living up to their
internal standards. But we can relish the process of doing things
without being great at it. For me, it is also an act of rebellion
towards an utilitarian world.

<h2 id="uk-court-throws-out-trumps-steele-dossier-lawsuit">UK Court
Throws Out Trump’s ‘Steele Dossier’ Lawsuit</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>London — London’s High Court on Thursday threw out Donald Trump’s
lawsuit against a British private investigations firm over the “Steele
dossier” which alleged ties between Trump’s election campaign and
Russia.</p>
<p>Trump, the frontrunner for the 2024 Republican presidential
nomination, had brought a data protection lawsuit against Orbis Business
Intelligence about claims in a dossier written by its co-founder, former
British intelligence officer Christopher Steele.</p>
<p>Judge Karen Steyn ruled that the former U.S. president’s case could
not continue, saying in a written ruling that “there are no compelling
reasons to allow the claim to proceed.”</p>
<p>Trump said in a witness statement made public in October that he
brought the case to prove claims in the so-called Steele dossier,
published by the BuzzFeed website in 2017, that he engaged in “perverted
sexual acts” in Russia, were false.</p>
<p>Many of the allegations were never substantiated and lawyers for
Trump, 77, said that the report was “egregiously inaccurate” and
contained “numerous false, phony or made-up allegations.”</p>
<p>Steyn noted that Trump said the allegations were untrue, adding: “I
have not considered, or made any determination, as to the accuracy or
inaccuracy of the (allegations).”</p>
<p>Orbis argued that Trump brought the claim simply to address his
“longstanding grievances” against the company and Steele.</p>
<p>Steyn said in her ruling that she did not need to decide that because
Trump had “no reasonable grounds for bringing a claim for compensation
or damages.”</p>
<p>The London lawsuit is one of many legal cases involving Trump, who
faces four separate criminal prosecutions in the United States.</p>
<p>Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung said in a statement:
“President Trump will continue to fight for the truth and against
falsehoods such as ones promulgated by Steele and his cohorts.”</p>
<p>Orbis did not respond to a request for comment.</p>

Rescued, Armed Man Detained at P&amp;G Factory in Turkey</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ANKARA — Police detained an armed man who took staff hostage at a
Procter &amp; Gamble factory in northwestern Turkey on Thursday and
rescued seven hostages, ending a protest against Israel’s military
campaign in Gaza, the local governor’s office said.</p>
<p>The Kocaeli governor’s office said that the hostages were unharmed,
adding that the operation to rescue them was launched after negotiations
with the hostage-taker failed.</p>
<p>“Our security forces intervened and neutralized the suspect,” the
statement said, adding that he was an employee of the factory who
“wanted to draw attention to the ongoing occupation in Gaza.”</p>
<p>P&amp;G thanked the authorities for their handling of the crisis.</p>
<p>“The fact that no one was harmed is our greatest relief. We are
grateful to the authorities and first responders who managed the
situation with courage and professionalism,” the company said in a
statement.</p>
<p>“Our efforts to support those employees most directly impacted, their
families and the entire P&amp;G community are ongoing.” </p>
<p>The hostage-taker entered the factory in Gebze industrial zone in
Kocaeli province around 3 p.m. (1200 GMT), the Demiroren news agency
said earlier, adding that police had then rushed to the scene and sought
to persuade him to give himself up. </p>
<p>The hostages were six men and a woman, media reports had said. </p>
<p>A photo released by local media earlier showed a man inside the
factory whose face was covered with a Palestinian scarf and who was
wearing what looked possibly like an explosive device. </p>
<p>Another photo from the scene showed the man holding a gun in one hand
and making a ‘V’ sign with his other hand in front of a wall on which
Turkish and Palestinian flags were painted with a script that reads:
“Gates will open. Either coffin rest or death for Gaza.”</p>

I’m a little bit
<a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/search?search_api_fulltext=timelapse">nutty
about timelapses</a>, and have made them with dashcams, GoPros, full

<a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/pi-timelapse">even Raspberry

<p>
But one thing I <em>haven’t</em> done (until now) is make easy

security around my house.
</p>
<p>
Eventually I’m planning on automating things further, but for now,
here’s my process for building up a timelapse that’s relatively small in
file size, preserving only frames where there’s motion from frame to
frame.
</p>
<p>
For something like clouds/sky, or natural environments, it’s better to
do a straight timelapse export and maybe recompress it if you want, but
for indoor or outdoor security footage, it’s nice to condense it down.

and Ukraine, they warn that the Western Balkans should not be
ignored. </p>
<p>U.S. Representative Pete Sessions told VOA on Wednesday that Russia
has been a part “of destabilizing the Balkans for a number of years,”
and that it has demonstrated it uses misinformation and military force
to fulfill its objectives. </p>
<p>“Destabilizing the Balkans is something that each of the countries
there see,” he said. “And they see these not only happening, but they
see whether it’s a deliberate attempt to undermine these nations.”  </p>
<p>Sessions said the United States needs to stand behind these nations
and “work within established parameters, the EU, NATO and other
organizations. … The United States needs to be front and center to say,
‘We support this, and we will stick together.’ That is what these
nations need. The United States of America standing strong with them
individually and as a group.” </p>
<p>‘Part of Putin’s strategy’ </p>
<p>Edward P. Joseph, a Balkans analyst at Johns Hopkins University’s
School of Advanced International Studies, agrees.  </p>
<p>“The Balkans are part of Putin’s strategy. He wants to divide Europe
from the United States, and he wants to divide Europe within itself. And
the Balkans are a prime avenue for him to do that,” he told VOA on
Wednesday.  </p>
<p>Sessions and Joseph participated this week in an annual security
forum in Congress focused on this issue and held around the time of the
National Prayer Breakfast. They were joined by politicians and lawmakers
from Europe and the Western Balkans, a region of six countries including
Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Kosovo, North Macedonia and
Serbia.  </p>
<p>Analysts say Moscow uses political interference and disinformation
that it deploys through its historically close ties with Serbia and
other friendly actors in the region.  </p>
<p>“Russia is active with its operations in the Balkans at very low
cost,” Joseph said. He cited as an example Serbia hosting the Russian
media outlets Russia Today and Sputnik. </p>
<p>“These are platforms that are giving pro-Russian narratives around
the region,” he said. “And that’s only one of the ways that Serbia
affects, in a negative way, advancing Russian agenda.”  </p>
<p>Focus on integration </p>
<p>During the security forum, Naz Durakoglu, assistant secretary of
state for legislative affairs, said the U.S. is very concerned about the
influence of China and Russia in the region and works in a variety of
ways to strengthen democracy in those countries. These include foreign
aid, a focus on the fight against corruption and promotion of reforms
“to help integrate Western Balkan countries into the EU and with each
other.” </p>
<p>Albania is a NATO member and works closely with the United States.
Its former defense minister, Fatmir Mediu, is one of the organizers of
the security forum. </p>
<p>“The way that forces such as Russia and China act is, first they try
to ignite new conflicts,” he told VOA. “The second is to create a kind
of status quo regarding certain situations and unresolved problems to
prevent membership in the European Union and NATO and expand their
geoeconomic and geopolitical influence.” </p>
<p>China Belt and Road </p>
<p>Durakoglu said that while Russia exerts its influence through gas and
disinformation, China furthers its interests mostly through economic and
infrastructure investments. </p>
<p>Valbona Zeneli, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, has written
extensively about the Chinese and Russian influence in the Western
Balkans. </p>
<p>“The Western Balkans has seen a significant expansion of Chinese
influence over the last decade, in line with Beijing’s geo-economic and
diplomatic vision of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), and in the
broader strategic context of China-EU relations,” she wrote in recent
research paper. She is also working on a book on the topic.  </p>
<p>“The geo-strategic position of the Western Balkans is perfect as a
bridgehead to EU markets and a key transit corridor for the Chinese BRI.
Chinese interests in the region are strongly related to infrastructure
projects and privatization opportunities, where demand for preferential
lending is high and acquisition prices are low,” she said. </p>
<p>‘We hold the cards’</p>
<p>As Russia and China align their positions in opposition to the West,
experts say they want to divert attention from the major world
conflicts, such as Ukraine, Middle East and China’s increasingly hostile
posture in South China Sea.</p>
<p>To Albania’s Mediu, it is clear that “there is a move by Russia but
also by China, maybe also by Iran to create problems in the Balkan
region, to have another point of conflict and to shift attention from
Ukraine.”  </p>
<p>In countering this influence, the U.S. is supporting allies in the
region. The Pentagon has confirmed last month’s approval by the United
States of the potential sale of Javelin anti-tank missiles to Kosovo for
an estimated $75 million.  </p>
<p>“This proposed sale will support the foreign policy goals and
national security of the United States by improving the security of a
European partner which is an important force for political and economic
stability in Europe,” the Pentagon said. </p>
<p>It added that the sale “will improve Kosovo’s long-term defense
capacity to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity to meet its
national defense requirements.” </p>
<p>Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic expressed “deep disappointment” at
the decision. Russia also “strongly condemned” the plans. </p>
<p>The proposed sale comes during tensions between Kosovo and Serbia
that the EU is seeking to resolve. In its continued rejection of its
former province’s independence, Serbia has had the firm support of
Russia and China. </p>
<p>With all the concern over Russia’s and China’s forays in the region,
Joseph of Johns Hopkins University said the good news is the West holds
the cards.  </p>
<p>“This is not like Ukraine. Russia is too far to bring in land forces.
The NATO members surround the Balkans. All the countries in the region
except Serbia want to join NATO. And some are already members of NATO,”
he said.</p>
<p>The European Union, he said, “is by far the main trading partner. So,
we hold the cards. We have to use them correctly.”</p>

attributed to Iranian-backed militias. The attack has many U.S.

id="redox-gets-more-linux-utilities-changes-resource-path-format-and-more">Redox
gets more Linux utilities, changes resource path format, and more</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-02, from: OS News</p>
<p>The Redox project has published an overview of the progress made in
January, and it’s a long list. Redox now supports the Raspberry Pi 3
Model B+, a few of System76’s Cosmic Desktop applications now run on
Redox, several more Linux applications haven been ported (most notably
for me, nano, my CLI text editor of choice), and much more. The most
important change is an overhaul of how Redox handles resource paths:
Redox has a microkernel core, with drivers and other resource providers
running as tasks and providing “schemes”. A scheme is the name of a
resource provider, and until now, resources have been accessed using
URI/URL format. For example, files would be accessed as
file:path/to/my_file, and a TCP connection would be accessed as
tcp:127.0.0.1. This format, while forward-looking, has not been very
backwards-compatible. In order to simplify our efforts to port Linux
software to Redox, we have decided to change our resource path format to
the Linux-compatible /scheme/scheme_name/path/to/resource. Paths that do
not begin with /scheme will be assumed to refer to the file scheme, so
/path/to/my_file is treated by the system as
/scheme/file/path/to/my_file, but the application will only see the
/path/to/my_file portion. Using this format, normal paths now look just
like Linux paths, while drivers and other resources can still be
addressed without breaking software. ↫ Ron Williams The change is an
ongoing process, so you might encounter some issues related to it in the
coming time.</p>

<p>That was back in August and since then, there has not been anything
too noteworthy in terms of Windows bootability support on ReFS.
Meanwhile, Microsoft has also not updated the officially supported ReFS
version up from 3.10 yet, and as such, trying to run Windows on any
newer ReFS version leads to an immediate crash on the newest Canary
build 26040. Apparently, the crash is worse than it was on previous
builds as it now throws up no recovery messages either. ↫ Sayan Sen at

<h2 id="reactos-details-its-new-graphical-installer">ReactOS details its
new graphical installer</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-01, from: OS News</p>
<p>The ReactOS project is working on a new graphical installer to
replace the older, text-mode one. In the first blog post about this
effort, from December 2023, developer hbelusca details their work on
setupapi, the module that enables “reading and processing INF files,
moving/copying files from an installation source media to a target,
supporting also extraction from compressed .CAB cabinet files”, as well
as device installation functions. The second post dives into
partitioning during installation, which involves a lot of very delicate
work, from partitioning to installing the bootloader, and from copying
files to modifying the registry. On top of that, this needs a GUI, and
preferably one that’s better and more versatile than the well-known blue
text-mode setup we all know from old versions of Windows. The new GUI
presents more options, allows for bootloader settings, and, of course,
partitioning in a non-destructive way before committing. In addition,
while the blue text-mode setup can only go forward, the new GUI is
bidirectional. The third and final post dives into testing all this work
and fixing bugs. The post goes into great detail describing a number of
bugs and their fixes, and is well worth a read, too.</p>

Hurricane Center’s Forecasts to Expand to Include Inland Areas</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ST. PETERSBURG, Florida — The “cone of uncertainty” produced by the
National Hurricane Center to forecast the location and ferocity of a
tropical storm is getting an update this year to include predictions for
inland areas, where wind and flooding are sometimes more treacherous
than damage to the coasts. </p>
<p>The Miami-based hurricane center said Thursday on the X social media
platform that the new, experimental forecast tool will be ready around
August 15, just before the traditional peak of the hurricane season that
begins June 1. </p>
<p>“This experimental graphic will help better convey wind hazard risk
inland in addition to coastal wind hazards,” the center said in the
post. </p>
<p>The traditional cone in use for years generally shows the forecast
track of a hurricane or tropical storm but is focused on wind and storm
surge along the coasts — and forecasters always warn not to focus on the
center line alone. Heavy rains and strong winds can be deadly and cause
significant damage inland, which happened in 2022 with Hurricane Ian,
when 149 people died in Florida. </p>
<p>The goal of the expanded forecast cone is to make sure people who
don’t live along a coast are aware of the dangers they could still face,
said Jamie Rhome, deputy director of the hurricane center. The new cone
features colors to show which places face threats in a much broader way
than before. If someone lives in one of those areas, “you are under
risk,” Rhome said. </p>
<p>There’s growing evidence that the impacts of climate change — such as
rising sea levels — are making the most severe hurricanes even more
intense and increasing the likelihood that a developing hurricane will
rapidly intensify and lead to more flooding and more powerful storm
surges battering coastlines, experts say. </p>
<p>After Ian blasted across the Fort Myers, Florida, area — where the
most people died and the worst damage was caused — the storm kept
dumping rain and toppling trees across a wide swath of the state of
Florida. Floods were reported around Orlando and its theme parks, south
to Kissimmee, east to Daytona Beach, and in central Florida’s cattle and
citrus country. </p>
<p>Ian produced between 10 and 20 inches (51 centimeters) of rain across
much of central Florida, the hurricane center reported. </p>
<p>People near rivers were deeply and possibly unexpectedly affected.
After Ian slogged through inland DeSoto County and the Peace River
flooded the community, Fire Chief Chad Jorgensen urged residents to
flee, saying the river was unpredictable and dangerous. </p>
<p>The first named storm of 2024 will be Alberto. The 2023 season saw 20
named storms, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, including seven hurricanes. Only Hurricane Idalia struck
the U.S., coming ashore in the lightly populated Big Bend region of
Florida’s Gulf Coast but also causing significant inland flooding.</p>

id="crypto-mining-consumes-a-mind-boggling-2-of-u.s.-electricity">Crypto
Mining Consumes a Mind-Boggling 2% of U.S. Electricity</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-01, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTI3NjEwNi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcxMjY3NzU5NX0._xwhVFI3IOnEpsqm3L7_xx9snU4u9dkkjBMn-LuAOHg/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
Just how much electricity does cryptocurrency mining use? It could be
over 2% of all electricity in the United States, according to a
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61364" target="_blank">preliminary
estimate</a> released by the Energy Information Administration. More
specifically, “annual electricity use from cryptocurrency mining
probably represents from 0.6% to 2.3% of U.S. electricity consumption.”
</p>
<p>
Using data from the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance on Bitcoin,
specifically, the EIA estimated that, at least as of January 2022,
almost 38% of all Bitcoin mining <strong></strong><em></em>was occurring
in the U.S., which let it produce a range of estimates for Bitcoin
mining’s electricity usage, ranging from 25 terawatt-hours to 91
terawatt-hours — about the same amount of electricity consumed by around
3 million to around 6 million homes — or roughly the electricity
consumption of Utah or West Virginia. That wide range is due to the
imprecise nature of the measurements, which are based on how active a
crypocurrency mining operation would be based on the price of Bitcoin
and other factors. Global electricity consumption based on these
estimates, the EIA said, was “about the same as total electricity
consumption in Greece or Australia.”
</p>
<p>
So why is Bitcoin so power hungry?
</p>
<p>
In some deep sense, Bitcoin <em>is</em> electricity. The cryptocurrency
is “mined” — i.e. new Bitcoins are generated — through what’s called a
proof of work system, essentially a way of proving that a computer (or,
in reality, lots of computers) have done a lot of computation. This
computational work maintains the system as a whole, and thus the new
Bitcoins are a reward for doing this decentralized maintenance. (Lots of
other cryptocurrencies also use a proof of work system the mint new
coins, the notable exception being Ethereum, which last year switched to
what’s called a “proof of stake” system that uses less energy. This,
Ethereum leadership said, makes the blockchain
“<a href="https://ethereum.org/energy-consumption" target="_blank">green</a>.”)
</p>
<p>
All that computation is incredibly energy intensive, which is why we see
crypto miners glom onto sources of cheap energy. Sometimes the cheapest
energy they can use is not using energy at all — Bitcoin mines in Texas
are part of a demand management program run by the state’s electricity
market, ERCOT, where they can collect
<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/06/texas-paid-bitcoin-miner-riot-31point7-million-to-shut-down-in-august.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hefty
payments</a> for not operating when electricity demand is high.
</p>
<p>
This energy consumption is a frequent point of criticism for advocates,
activists, and lawmakers who are skeptical of cryptocurrency and earlier
this week, the EIA said it would start
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/pressroom/releases/press550.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">collecting
its own data</a> on cryptocurrency mining.
</p>
<p>
So far, the EIA has found 137 cryptocurrency mining facilities, with
several of the largest ones located in Texas. But this was just done by
scanning publicly available data. The EIA said
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/pressroom/releases/press550.php" target="_blank">earlier
this week</a> that it will be conducting a “mandatory survey” to better
understand crypto’s energy demands.

<h2 id="whats-up-at-harvard">What’s up at Harvard?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-01, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I wrote this note to Chris Lydon re the
<a href="https://radioopensource.org/the-humbling-of-harvard/">latest
episode</a> of his podcast.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Chris,
</li>
<li>
I’m listening to your latest
<a href="https://radioopensource.org/the-humbling-of-harvard/">podcast
about Harvard</a>, and totally appreciate this.
</li>
<li>
In my two years at Harvard in the 00s, I never:
</li>
<ul>
<li>
<ol type="1">
<li>Experienced antisemitism.
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Saw antisemitism.
</li>
<li>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Even thought about the <i>possibility</i> of antisemitism.
</li>
</ul>
<li>
On the Harvard campus.
</li>
<li>
That said, antisemitism is everywhere, even inside me, a man whose
grandparents were Jews who fled for their lives with their children from
the Holocaust before and during WWII. I am a product of that, in ways I
didn’t even realize until my parents were gone. It’s everywhere, all
around, inside myself, inside everyone, and the best we can hope for
imho is that it will stay hidden.
</li>
<li>
Ask me about what happened in the NBA with
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+kyrie">Kyrie
Irving</a>, and how, by their silence, the players and coaches showed
how huge and deep the problem is.
</li>
<li>
To see the Repubs monetize this for political gain is par for the
course. To see Harvard buckle under that, is as weak and the people who
made that decision imho should resign in disgrace.
</li>
<li>
Thanks for your continued and unique excellence.
</li>
<li>
Dave

larger than Germany</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-01, from: OS News</p>
<p>A few times a year, a claim will make the rounds that the largest PDF
you can make is a square covering about the middle section of Germany –
381 km × 381 km. Turns out, this is only the maximum size Acrobat Reader
can display, and not the limit of the format itself at all. So, how big
can you go? Very big: If you’re curious, that width is approximately the
distance between the Earth and the Moon. I’d have to get my ruler to
check, but I’m pretty sure that’s larger than Germany. I could keep
going. And I did. Eventually I ended up with a PDF that Preview claimed
is larger than the entire universe – approximately 37 trillion light
years square. Admittedly it’s mostly empty space, but so is the
universe. If you’d like to play with that PDF, you can get it here.
Please don’t try to print it. ↫ Alex Chan Don’t worry, I’m out of

<p>
It’s awkward to be dragged kicking and screaming into a future that’s
already here. Especially because if you don’t do it, you will be
irrelevant.

In northeastern Minnesota, a fight over
<a href="https://www.newrangecoppernickel.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the
proposed NewRange Copper Nickel mine</a>, better known
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/teck-resources-ltd-business-ownership-climate-and-environment-ea4ebc6998a2e22b11d30e1cc5d2cdd4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">as
PolyMet</a>, has dragged on for nearly two decades. Permits have been
issued and revoked;

and
<a href="https://knsiradio.com/2022/01/25/wildlife-groups-sue-agencies-over-assessment-on-polymet-mine/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">federal
agencies</a> have been sued. The argument at the heart of the saga
<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/01/23/1086458/critical-minerals-nickel-inflation-reduction-act-environmental-dangers/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">is
familiar</a>: Whether the pollution and disruption the mine will create
are worth it for the jobs and minerals that it will produce.
</p>
<p>
The arguments are so familiar, in fact, that one wonders why we haven’t
come up with a permitting and approval process that accounts for them.
In total, the $1 billion NewRange project required more than 20 state
and federal permits to move forward, all of which were secured by 2019.
But since then, a number have been
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/new-range-mine-tribe-water-pollution-minnesota-075463042956fa4e89d576c5cae8f663" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">revoked</a>
or
<a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2023/08/02/mpca-was-arbitrary-and-capricious-in-granting-polymet-permit-supreme-court-rules/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">remanded</a>
back to the permit-issuing agencies. Just last year, for instance, the
Army Corps of Engineers rescinded NewRange’s wetlands permit on the
recommendation of the Environmental Protection Agency.
</p>
<p>
The messy history of this mine displays the difficult decisions the U.S.
faces when it comes to securing the critical minerals that are key to a
clean energy future — and the ways in which our current regulatory and
permitting infrastructure is ill-equipped to resolve these tensions.
</p>
<p>
All sides in this debate recognize that minerals like nickel and copper
are vital to the energy transition. Nickel is an integral component in
most lithium-ion EV battery chemistries, and copper is used across a
whole swath of technologies — electric vehicles, solar panels, and wind
turbines, to name a few.
</p>
<p>
“We recognize that you’re going to need copper, nickel, and other
minerals in order to have a functioning society and to make the clean
energy transition that we’re all interested in,” Aaron Klemz, Chief
Strategy Officer at the Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy,
told me. But along with a number of other environmental groups and the
Fond du Lac band of the Minnesota Chippewa tribe, which lives downstream
of the proposed mine, MCEA opposes the project. “You can’t not mine. We
understand that. But you have to take it on a case-by-case basis.”
</p>
<p>
On the one hand, the Duluth Complex, where the NewRange mine would be
sited, contains one of the world’s largest
<a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2022/07/07/northeast-minnesotas-fraught-choice-precious-metals-v-precious-water/#:~:text=The%20Duluth%20Complex%2C%20where%20its%20mine%20would%20be%20located%2C%20is%20considered%20one%20of%20the%20largest%20undeveloped%20copper%2Dnickel%20resources%20in%20the%20world%2C" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">untapped
deposits</a> of copper, nickel and other key metals. However, the
critical minerals in this water-rich environment are bound to sulfide
ores that can release toxic sulfuric acid when exposed to water and air.
The proposed mine sits in a watershed that would eventually flow into
Lake Superior, a critical source of drinking water for the Upper
Midwest.
</p>
<p>
Many advocacy groups believe water pollution from the mine is
inevitable, especially given NewRange’s plans for its waste basin. The
current proposal involves covering the waste products, known as
tailings, with water and containing the resulting slurry will with a
dam. That’s considered much riskier than draining water from the
tailings and “dry stacking” them in a pile. NewRange’s
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN2AX0YI/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">upstream
dam construction</a> method is also a concern, as the wet tailings can
erode the dam’s walls more easily than with other designs. An upstream
dam
<a href="https://www.minnpost.com/environment/2019/08/a-dam-collapse-in-brazil-has-some-worried-about-polymets-plans-why-the-dnr-says-it-wont-happen-here/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">collapsed
in Brazil in 2019</a>, leading the country to ban this type of
construction altogether.
</p>
<p>
And lastly, there’s the narrow question of the NewRange dam’s bentonite
clay liner. Late last year, an administrative law judge recommended that
state regulators
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/minnesota-mining-environment-copper-nickel-8807341897539ec884d03c515a2eadd6" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">refrain
from reissuing NewRange’s permit to mine</a> on the grounds that this
liner was not a “practical and workable” method of containing the
tailings.
</p>
<p>
Christie Kearney, director of sustainability, environmental and
regulatory affairs for NewRange Copper Nickel, called these criticisms
“tired and worn talking points” in a follow-up email to me, and said
that the concerns simply don’t hold water “after the most comprehensive
and lengthy environmental review and permitting process in Minnesota
history.” The bentonite issue in particular, she told me, represents one
of the main reasons permitting has been so challenging. “Instead of
allowing agencies (who have the expertise) to make these decisions as
established in Minnesota law, the regulatory decisions get challenged in
court by mining opponents, leaving it to judges (who don’t have the
technical expertise) to make these determinations,” she wrote.
</p>
<p>
The whole process could have gone more smoothly if all the stakeholders
were involved from the beginning, she told me when we spoke. “In
particular, we have a number of state permits that are overseen by the
EPA, yet the EPA isn’t involved until the very end, which has caused
frustration both in our environmental review process as well as our
permitting process.”
</p>
<p>
Klemz has another approach to ending the confusion. What is needed, he
said, is a pathway to shut down projects once and for all if they’re
deemed too environmentally hazardous. “There is no way to say no under
the system we have now,” he told me. While courts can deny or revoke a
permit, companies like NewRange can always go back to the drawing board
and resubmit. “What we have instead is a system where the company has
the incentive to keep on trying over and over and over again, despite
whatever setback they encounter.”
</p>
<p>
While there’s no systematic way to block a mine, myriad avenues can lead
to a “no.” Last year, the federal government placed a
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/26/climate/mining-ban-boundary-waters-copper.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">moratorium</a>
on mining on federal lands upstream of Minnesota’s Boundary Waters Canoe
Wilderness Area, effectively shutting down another proposed
copper-nickel mine. And the EPA
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/31/climate/pebble-mine-epa-decision.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">banned
the disposal of mine waste</a> near Alaska’s proposed Pebble mine,
blocking that project as well.
</p>
<p>
It’s a delicate balancing act, because ultimately the administration
does want to incentivize domestic critical minerals production. The
Inflation Reduction Act provides
<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/cleanenergy/clean-energy-updates/2023/03/31/treasury-releases-guidance-to-drive-investment-in-critical-minerals-battery-supply-chains-in-america/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">generous
tax credits</a> for companies involved in minerals processing, cathode
materials production, and battery manufacturing. Then there’s the $7,500
credit available to consumers that purchase a qualifying EV, which
depends on the automaker sourcing minerals from either the U.S. or a
country the U.S. has a free-trade agreement with.
</p>
<p>
Under the
<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/12/15/2023-27498/section-45x-advanced-manufacturing-production-credit#:~:text=Direct%20material%20costs,as%20production%20costs." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">current
interpretation of the IRA</a>, it’s possible that none of this money
would flow directly to NewRange, since mineral extraction isn’t eligible
for a tax credit, and it’s yet unclear whether the company will process
the metals to a high enough grade to be eligible for credits there,
either. Automakers that source from NewRange could benefit, but the
project doesn’t currently have offtake agreements with any electric
vehicle or clean energy company. That’s something that critics of the
mine point to when
<a href="https://www.newrangecoppernickel.com/news/newrange-copper-nickel-poised-to-supply-critical-minerals-for-clean-energy-transition" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NewRange
touts its clean energy credentials</a>.
</p>
<p>
“It’s much more likely that this will end up in a string of Christmas
lights than it will end up in a wind turbine in the United States,”
Klemz told me. Of course, more critical minerals in the market overall
will lower prices, thereby benefiting clean energy projects. But
NewRange is a less neat proposition than, say, the
<a href="https://talonmetals.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">proposed
Talon Metals nickel mine</a>, which is sited about two hours southwest
of NewRange.
<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/01/25/1087027/climate-subsidies-inflation-reduction-act-mining-critical-minerals/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">As
MIT Technology Review reports</a>, this mine could unlock billions in
federal subsidies through its offtake agreement with Tesla.
</p>
<p>
That hasn’t inoculated Talon from fierce local opposition, either. “As
disinterested as the public may be in a lot of things, they are really
engaged in a new mining project in their backyard,” said Adrian Gardner,
Principal Nickel Markets Analyst at the energy and research consultancy
Wood Mackenzie, which has been tracking both the Talon and NewRange mine
since they were first proposed.
</p>
<p>
The Biden administration is also engaged. Two years ago, the Department
of the Interior
<a href="https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-department-launches-interagency-working-group-mining-reform" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">convened
an interagency working group</a> to make domestic minerals production
more sustainable and efficient, starting with the Mining Law of 1872 —
still the law of the land when it comes to new mining projects. The
group
<a href="https://www.doi.gov/media/document/mriwg-report-final-508-pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">released
a report</a> last September recommending, among other things, that the
Bureau of Land Management and U.S. Forest Service provide standardized
guidance to prospective developers and require meetings between all
relevant agencies and potential developers before any applications are
submitted. That means Congress will need to provide more resources to
permitting agencies.
</p>
<p>
Those resources could come from a proposed royalty of between 4% and 8%
on the net proceeds of minerals extracted from public lands, a fee that
would also go to help communities most impacted by mining. The National
Mining Association, of which NewRange is a member, has
<a href="https://nma.org/2023/09/12/iwg-recommendations-on-mining-unworkable-and-unreasonable/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">come
out strongly against</a> the report’s recommendations, highlighting the
high royalties as a particular point of contention.
</p>
<p>
But many of the report’s proposals might have helped NewRange in its
early days. “There were a lot of early missteps by the company,” Kearney
admits. “The first draft [Environmental Impact Statement] that the
company went through received a very poor reading from the EPA, and the
company went back to its drawing board, changed out its leadership and
its environmental leads.”
</p>
<p>
More stern rebukes, of course, would be the ideal for many advocacy
groups. “I don’t know how they could redesign it quite honestly, given
what we know about the science, to comply with the law,” Klemz said.
</p>
<p>
Kearney is adamant, though, that even after five years of litigation,
NewRange has no plans to give up the fight. “Not many companies can
weather that,” Kearney said. Not many companies, however, are backed by
mining giant Glencore. PolyMet, the project’s original developer,
“really only survived because Glencore came in a few years back and
invested over time until the point where they got
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/glencore-polymet-newrange-teck-copper-nickel-mining-8221342118d7fefb29a7e204f5e3b9ef" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">100%
contro</a>l,” Kearney told me.
</p>
<p>
Glencore, a $65 billion Swiss company, is pursuing the NewRange project
in partnership with Teck Resources, which is worth $20 billion. The
companies can afford to fight for a very long time, meaning nobody knows
quite how or when this all ends.
</p>
<p>
“We do need this material. I get that,” Klemz told me. “So I don’t
really know if there’s going to be some kind of neat future resolution
to this.”
</p>
<p>
Kearney put it simply. “We don’t have a timeline right now.”

<p>Around late 1986, Sega released the “Sega AI Computer”. This is one
of Sega’s least well known and rarest systems. Not much is known about
this system apart from a small amount of information in Japanese and
American flyers and press articles. The information we have is still
piecemeal and may be partly inaccurate. Today we are making public, for
the first time: all system roms extracted from the Sega AI Computer,
data dumps from 26 my-cards and 14 tapes, many scans and photographs,
and in collaboration with MAME developers, an early working MAME driver
allowing this computer to be emulated. ↫ SMS Power! Incredible. Usually
stuff like this is relegated to a YouTube video, with potential archival

Hints at Stronger Response Against Iranian Proxies</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — U.S. forces are preparing to hit Iran-backed proxies
across the Middle East with increased intensity in response to a drone
attack on a base in Jordan that killed three U.S. soldiers and injured
more than 40 others.</p>
<p>U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, speaking to reporters for the
first time since he was hospitalized January 1 for complications from
prostate cancer surgery, called the attack against sleeping quarters at
Tower 22 in northeastern Jordan “egregious,” adding such actions will
not be tolerated.</p>
<p>“It’s time to take away even more capability than we’ve taken in the
past,” Austin said Thursday, when asked why the United States has waited
to respond more strongly to the more than 165 attacks on U.S. forces in
the Middle East dating to mid-October of last year.</p>
<p>The U.S. defense secretary also seemed to dismiss a statement issued
by Kataib Hezbollah, an Iran-backed militia in Iraq, that it was
suspending military operations against the U.S.</p>
<p>“We always listen to what people are saying, but we watch what they
do,” he said. “Actions are everything.”</p>
<p>Austin also suggested that following the deadly attack in Jordan,
such gestures are too little, too late.</p>
<p>“We look to hold the people that are responsible for this
accountable,” he said. “And we also look to make sure that we continue
to take away capability from them as we go forward.”</p>
<p>Like his counterparts at the White House and the State Department,
Austin said the U.S. is moving forward with a “multi-tiered response”
likely to include multiple military strikes.</p>
<p>CBS News reported Thursday that U.S. President Joe Biden has approved
plans for several days of strikes on targets that include “Iranian
personnel and facilities” in both Iraq and Syria.</p>
<p>With the exception of a strike on January 4 in Baghdad that killed
the leader of the Iran-backed Harakat-al-Nujaba militia, previous U.S.
responses have focused on hitting sites and storage facilities instead
of militia personnel.</p>
<p>Some critics, though, have raised concerns that Washington’s
willingness to talk about a military response has given the Iran-backed
militias, many of which have launched attacks on U.S. forces under the
banner of the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, time to prepare.</p>
<p>But Austin said he was not concerned with reports that some of the
militias have been evacuating bases and training facilities.</p>
<p>“In terms of telegraphing about strikes and whether or not people
leave or what is left, I won’t speculate,” the defense secretary
said.</p>
<p>“They have a lot of capability. I have a lot more,” he said. “We’re
going to do what’s necessary to protect our troops and our
interests.”</p>
<p>The defense chief also acknowledged there has been no end to attacks
on international shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden by Iran-backed
Houthi militants in Yemen despite several warnings and a series strikes
on Houthi facilities and missile launch locations.</p>
<p>“The Houthis continue to do some things that are very irresponsible
and illegal,” he told reporters. “So, our goal is to make sure that we
continue to take away capability from the Houthis to do what they’ve
been doing.</p>
<p>“We would call upon Iran to quit or to cease supplying the Houthis
with these advanced conventional weapons that they’ve used to attack
ships,” he said, calling it an issue of international concern.</p>
<p>The Houthis have launched nearly 40 attacks on international shipping
since mid-November, including a flurry of attacks and attempted attacks
on Thursday.</p>
<p>U.S. Central Command, which oversees U.S. forces in the Middle East,
said it started with the shootdown of a drone in the early morning
hours, Yemen time, over the Gulf of Aden.</p>
<p>Several hours later, U.S. forces in the Red Sea destroyed a Houthi
naval drone packed with explosives that was headed for international
shipping lanes.</p>
<p>“It presented an imminent threat to merchant vessels and the U.S.
Navy ships in the region,” U.S. Central Command, also known as CENTCOM,
said in a statement.</p>
<p>A couple of hours after the naval drone was eliminated, CENTCOM said
the Houthis fired two anti-ship ballistic missiles in the general
direction of the M/V Koi, a Bermuda-owned cargo ship.</p>
<p>A CENTCOM statement said the missiles missed the ship and splashed
into the water.</p>
<p>In January, the U.S. designated the Houthis as a Specially Designated
Global Terrorist group.</p>

<h2 id="biden-sanctions-violent-west-bank-settlers">Biden Sanctions
Violent West Bank Settlers</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Warren, Mich.; Washington — U.S. President Joe Biden on Thursday
visited Michigan to meet with union autoworkers (UAW) crucial to his
reelection bid in the important swing state that is also home to the
highest number of Arab Americans.</p>
<p>On the same day he issued an executive order to sanction individuals
who support settler violence against Palestinians in the West Bank.</p>
<p>His administration says the action reflects a “holistic approach” to
the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, that has bled into increasing
violence in the West Bank, a separate Palestinian enclave.</p>
<p>“President Biden has also spoken about his concern about the rise in
violence that we have seen in the West Bank from extremist actors — in
particular the rise in extremist settler violence, which reached record
levels in 2023,” national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in a
statement Thursday.</p>
<p>White House officials say the executive action had been long planned
and deny that it was issued to coincide with Biden’s visit amid anger
from Arab and Muslim Americans, as well as young and progressive
Democrats over his staunch support for Israel’s military campaign in
Gaza. Biden first expressed his concern over Palestinians in the West
Bank under attack by what he called “extremist” Israeli settlers in late
October, a few weeks after the Hamas attack.</p>
<p>The financial sanctions target four Israeli men accused of fomenting
and participating in settler violence.</p>
<p>“There’s no plans to target with sanctions Israeli government
officials at this time,” John Kirby, a spokesperson for the National
Security Council, told VOA aboard Air Force 1 on Thursday.</p>
<p>Kirby denied that Biden is using the executive order to signal
displeasure at hardline members of Netanyahu’s government who have
facilitated such violence, including National Security Minister Itamar
Ben Gvir.</p>
<p>“It’s a signal to the whole world how seriously President Biden takes
… the settler violence against Palestinians in the West Bank,” Kirby
said.</p>
<p>Immediately after the Hamas October 7 attack, Ben Gvir distributed
more than 10,000 rifles to arm Israeli civilians, including those in
towns near the West Bank.</p>
<p>White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre sidestepped questions
why the lone Palestinian American congresswoman, Democrat Rashida Tlaib,
did not join Biden on the trip. Her district is near the site of his
visit, and it is customary for the president to invite elected officials
to join him. Senators Debbie Stabenow and Gary Peters traveled with
Biden on Thursday, as did Rep. Debbie Dingell. All are Democrats.</p>
<p>Tlaib has been vocal in her criticism of Biden’s support for Israel,
and in her calls for a cease-fire. In November, Tlaib posted a video
online in which she accused Biden of “supporting the genocide of the
Palestinian people.”</p>
<p>The Arab American community is among a growing number of Americans
who have expressed concerns about Biden’s steadfast support of Israel’s
aggressive military operation in response to the Hamas militant group’s
October 7 terror attack on Israeli civilians. The U.S., U.K. and EU have
designated Hamas as a terrorist organization.</p>
<p>“We understand how difficult this is for many,” Jean-Pierre said to
VOA. “We get that.”</p>
<p>Close to 200 pro-Palestinian demonstrators were waiting for Biden
near the UAW Region 1 building in Warren, the outskirts of Detroit,
ahead of his event there. The president’s motorcade bypassed them using
side streets and he was largely spared from streetside protesters who in
previous trips have lined his route and interrupted his events. In his
last stop however, he was met with a small group waving Palestinian
flags and chanting “Genocide Joe.”</p>
<p>Prominent members of the community have complained that the White
House has ignored their concerns.</p>
<p>“Since October 7th, I have received ZERO correspondence from White
House, DNC [Democratic National Committee], or MDP [Michigan Democratic
Party] leadership about the concerns from our community on the ongoing
genocide unfolding in Gaza,” said Rep. Abraham Aiyash of the Michigan
state Legislature on social media ahead of Biden’s visit.</p>
<p>A New York Times/Siena College poll published in December, however,
found that almost as many Americans believe that Israel should push on
to total victory even in the face of mounting civilian casualties.</p>
<p>And there is a diversity of opinion within the Muslim American
community.</p>
<p>“He’s doing the best he can,” Mustafa Abdullah Rahman, a U.S. Army
veteran, told VOA as Biden stopped at a Black-owned restaurant near
Detroit. “And I feel bad for my Palestinian brothers and sisters,
because they are suffering. Both sides are suffering. And so he’s doing
the best he can in a very touchy, touchy situation.”</p>
<p>Biden has so far resisted pressure to call for a cease-fire, saying
it will only benefit Hamas at this point. His administration is pushing
for negotiations that would allow 6 weeks of cessation of hostilities
for the exchange of more than 100 Israeli hostages still held by Hamas
with Palestinians held in Israeli jails.</p>
<p>While Biden continues to provide significant military and diplomatic
support for Israel, analysts say there has been a shift in his
approach.</p>
<p>Since October 7, especially in the last few weeks, Biden has “visibly
put pressure on Israel to limit the damage in Gaza,” said Jeremi Suri, a
history professor at the University of Texas at Austin. And he has
expressed empathy and concern for the lives of citizens in Gaza and
elsewhere, Suri said.</p>
<p>“He has moderated and balanced his language, maybe not as much as
some people want,” Suri told VOA. “But as we know, there’s no one who’s
happy with it or found perfect balance on this issue.”</p>
<p>Robert Murrett, a professor in the Department of Public
Administration and International Affairs at Syracuse University, said it
makes sense that the administration has shifted.</p>
<p>“I’m a military person, so we tend to put it in phases,” he said.
“The situation has changed. Over the last couple of months, I don’t
think there’s any question that concerns over the level of Palestinian
casualties – more than 20,000 dead in Gaza – have modified positions by
a lot of people, including a White House and just about all of our
allied governments and many others.”</p>
<p>As Biden was touring a restaurant meeting voters, VOA asked Biden
what his message is to Arab American communities.</p>
<p>He did not respond.</p>
<p>White House correspondent Anita Powell reported from Washington.</p>

<h2 id="i-used-to-listen-to-your-podcast">“I used to listen to your
podcast”</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-01, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
Often when I talk with folks who know me from
<a href="https://shoptalkshow.com/">my podcast</a> they will say
something along the lines of, “I used to listen to your podcast!” Then
they blush because their statement implies they don’t listen anymore
(<a href="https://piccalil.li/blog/shoptalk-reaches-600th-episode/">Exhibit
A</a>). And I just wanted to say…
</p>
<p>
I get it.
</p>
<p>
It’s fine. I take no offense. In fact, that’s part of the magic of
podcasts! There’s an ebb and flow to them. Here’s ten reasons I give up
on
podcasts<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
You need certain podcasts at certain times in your life.
</li>
<li>
You and the podcast grow in different directions.
</li>
<li>
You finish a season or story arc and it feels like a good stopping
point.
</li>
<li>
You find yourself subscribed to <em>too many</em> of the <em>same
kind</em> of podcast (tech, murder mystery, actual play, two white dudes
talking, etc).
</li>
<li>
Nearly every podcast goes through an experimental phase and it’s okay
not to join them on that cringe journey, you can catch up afterwards.
</li>
<li>
Podcasts bring an immense amount of joy, but they can become another
item on the to do list.
</li>
<li>
There might be a global pandemic that cut your daily commute to zero and
now you don’t have time for podcasts.
</li>
<li>
You might get into audiobooks with a consistent narrative instead of
rambly diatribes.
</li>
<li>
People are only so original. When podcasts get a bit repetitive, it’s
okay to peel off.
</li>
<li>
A great reset where all podcasts must earn their position back in the
queue!
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Unsubscribe and if you miss it you can always go back. As long as they
paid their hosting bill, it should still be there.
</p>
<p>
With RSS you can unplug from the machine. Podcasts – built on RSS – are
the same. A never ending stream of content… but with latency. It’s
important we celebrate the Thrill of Missing Out.
</p>
<section class="footnotes">
<ol>
<li id="fn1">
<p>
You can also unsubscribe for petty reasons like audio quality or you
don’t like the person’s voice, but I’d encourage you to seek past that
best you can. <a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a>

<h2 id="on-digital-relationships">On digital relationships</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-01, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<p>
This is my entry for February’s
<a href="https://indieweb.org/indieweb-carnival">IndieWeb carnival</a>.
This month is hosted by yours truly and I’d love to have you as part of
this initiative.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
Digital relationships are a fascinating concept. The idea that a
relationship with someone else can be lived, consumed, and enjoyed
entirely inside the digital space is something we probably take for
granted but it’s such a unique and distinctive feature of this time we
live in.
</p>
<p>
If you’re like me, you probably met and interacted with more people in
the digital world than in real life. And I’m not saying this because I’m
an introvert, I don’t think I am. I’m saying this simply because it’s
the result of the life I live.
</p>
<p>
Daily I receive emails or messages from people I don’t know and will
never meet “in real life”. And daily I send back messages to these
people sharing thoughts, opinions, bits of my life. That’s just what my
life is these days and, to be honest with you, I find it incredibly
rewarding at a personal level.
</p>
<p>
But my life hasn’t always been like that. I’m technically a child of the
80s—juuuuust barely—but I grew up in the 90s. The internet wasn’t part
of my life and the same can be said for most of the technology we take
for granted nowadays. I had a cellphone—not a smartphone—and SMS was how
we communicated. But SMS was such a limited and costly way to interact
that using it to have digital relationships was not an option. And you
had to have someone’s number first.
</p>
<p>
My first experience with a digital relationship happened on a forum. Do
you remember those? I love forums. They’re such a neat way to organize
an online community. I’m even considering setting up one myself! Anyway,
I remember browsing and posting on
<a href="https://www.hwupgrade.it/forum/">hwupgrade.it/forum/</a> in the
early 2000s and becoming friends with an Italian girl. We talked PS1
games and it was awesome. I never met her, never seen a picture of her,
never even cared about asking for one. The only thing we exchanged were
names and that was it.
</p>
<p>
That was just the first in a long series of fun digital relationships. I
met people playing the original COD MW2, back in 2009, I connected with
strangers during the #followfriday days of early Twitter, and I
exchanged countless emails with designers and developers during my years
curating the—now defunct—thegallery.io.
</p>
<p>
With most of the people I consider friends I have digital relationships.
I met <a href="https://robhope.com">Rob</a> in person once in my life.
We’ve known each other since I think 2012 and I hear from him pretty
much daily. The same is true for
<a href="https://carlbarenbrug.com">Carl</a>. We met in person exactly
once and I hear from him daily.
<a href="https://mwarrenarts.com">Mike</a> connected with me via email
in 2015 and we’re still friends to this day. We never met in person and
that’s absolutely fine.
</p>
<p>
Digital relationships are powerful. Some people discard them because
they think they’re not at the same level as “real relationships” but I
disagree. Digital relationships are their own thing. They have their own
rules, and their own ways to be unique. And they can be as important as
any other relationship.
</p>
<p>
The current internet can be a miserable place, I know. Social media can
be a cesspool, people are mean, and there are weirdos everywhere. It
sucks. I’m not going to pretend everything is wonderful out there. But I
still have hope. I do because of the countless lovely exchanges I had
via email with people like you.
</p>
<p>
You, are a wonderful person. I don’t have any reason to think otherwise.
And I’m sure there are others like you out there. Curious people, kind
people, generous people. People who like to share, to engage honestly.
</p>
<p>
Digital relationships are powerful but don’t take my word for it. Try
for yourself. Next time you stumble on a personal site you find
interesting, try to connect with the person behind that site. Write an
email, say hi, send them some love. You won’t regret it.

id="austin-says-he-never-told-anyone-on-his-staff-to-keep-white-house-in-the-dark-on-hospitalization">Austin
Says He Never Told Anyone on His Staff to Keep White House in the Dark
on Hospitalization</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Thursday he never
directed anyone on his staff not to tell the White House he’d been
hospitalized and takes full responsibility for keeping President Joe
Biden in the dark for weeks that he’d been diagnosed with prostate
cancer.</p>
<p>“We did not handle this right and I did not handle this right. I
should have told the president about my cancer diagnosis. I take full
responsibility,” Austin said.</p>
<p>“The news shook me,” Austin, 70, said when he first got the
diagnosis. “Frankly, my first instinct was to keep it private.”</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters in the Pentagon briefing room, Austin provided
his most extensive comments to date on the secrecy surrounding his
cancer diagnosis and struggles with complications since his surgery on
Dec. 22. It was the first time he had answered questions from reporters
since being rushed back to the hospital on Jan. 1.</p>
<p>“I never directed anyone to keep my January hospitalization from the
White House,” Austin said.</p>
<p>Known as a very private person, Austin appeared calm as he fielded a
barrage of questions about his health and why he failed to inform the
president and other key leaders about his hospitalizations until days
after he was admitted to intensive care.</p>
<p>His lack of disclosure prompted changes in federal guidelines and
triggered an internal Pentagon review and an inspector general review
into his department’s notification procedures. Both reviews are ongoing,
and members of Congress have called for hearings on the matter.</p>
<p>Austin was diagnosed with prostate cancer early in December and had
surgery on Dec. 22. On Jan. 1, he was taken by ambulance to Walter Reed
National Military Medical Center after experiencing extreme pain due to
complications from the surgery and was admitted to the intensive care
unit.</p>
<p>He transferred decision-making authorities to Deputy Defense
Secretary Kathleen Hicks, but did not tell her why. And he did not tell
Biden and other top officials about his diagnosis, his surgery or
hospitalization until several days after he was in the ICU.</p>
<p>Asked about the matter earlier in January, Biden said it was a lapse
in judgment for Austin not to tell him about his hospitalization, but
Biden said he still has confidence in his Pentagon chief.</p>
<p>Austin, who worked from home for two weeks after his release from the
hospital Jan. 15, returned to work in the Pentagon on Monday. He had not
been in the building since Dec. 21.</p>
<p>Underscoring the secrecy surrounding Austin’s hospital visit, one of
his aides asked first responders to avoid using lights and sirens when
requesting an ambulance be sent to the secretary’s northern Virginia
home on Jan. 1.</p>

<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/205323.205338"><i>The Stanford Digital
Library Project</i></a> stated its goal thus:<br />
<blockquote>
The Stanford Integrated Digital Library Project will develop enabling
technologies for an integrated “virtual” library to provide an array of
new services and uniform access to networked information collections.
The Integrated Digital Library will create a shared environment linking
everything from personal information collections, to collections of
conventional libraries, to large data collections shared by scientists.

<p><br /> This rough transcript runs from

to
<a href="https://youtu.be/GjR7sRASjdo?feature=shared&amp;t=3215">[53:35]</a>.
Andy speaks:<br /> <br /> The true story is that I met the founders of
Google before the company existed because they were, like I was, a
student at Stanford. I’m not sure Larry was really ready to abandon the
PhD program and jump into this. So I was in this same position once
myself and I used the same line “you’ll always finish your PhD later”.
Now the concern I had is that if they didn’t get going this great idea
may be not happening. <br /><br /> Of course I was involved in the
company itself but it was really really a very good idea, one of the
best ideas I’ve ever seen. This notion of relevant search and relevant
ads and this business model that solved it Put it this way, I was very
familiar with scientific publishing where what matters is not how many
papers you write but how many people cite your papers. So if you apply
the same thing to the Web clearly what is relevant is what other people
link to and notice. You could automatically build a graph, a structure
that said what’s more important than others. <br /><br /> At the time
people didn’t think automatic search was actually possible because Alta
Vista which was popular at the time just looked at keywords. What people
would do is they would add the whole dictionary as a dark page behind
the document. Since every word you are looking for is in the dictionary
you couldn’t find anything any more because every document had every
word. That wasn’t a path to success; you couldn’t actually look at the
document because it could just be spam. <br /><br /> Yahoo believed
fairly strongly, they actually had at one point talked to Larry and
Sergey and maybe even Larry was offering them to sell them the idea but
Yahoo passed on the belief that you just couldn’t do it. They really
thought you could hire people, like newspaper editors, they would make
the sports section and the garden section like a newspaper; select
content from the Web that then they would present to the front page.
Clearly that was not going to scale if there were millions of Web pages
you just couldn’t keep it up. <br /><br /> So Larry and Sergey believed
very strongly that it had to be automatic and that if that wasn’t
possible — it was the only way to do it basically. That first demo which
they had on a laptop was actually quite compelling it looked the same as
before — here’s the lucky button. The only worry was they wanted to sort
of demo they could scale the search engine to like a couple of racks of
computers before they would raise the real venture and there was some
question whether it was scalable. For that they just wanted to raise a
small amount of money to build the first couple of racks with
motherboards. <br /><br /> The money that I put in there on day one was
actually before the company started helped to demonstrate that. So I
bought them this check. They had the name of the company but the check
was to the name of the company that didn’t exist. At the time some of
the law firms were so busy they didn’t want to take on new clients that
didn’t have some funding behind them. I figured if I write them a check
it would help them to get the right firm. But I can’t claim any credit
for what they’ve done its all due to the insight they had and the team
they built. <br /><br /> Let me back up here. I couldn’t find stuff on
Alta Vista so I was desperate for better search. A lot of my time was
looking for data sheets and information I was looking for and if I
couldn’t find anything on the Web the Web wouldn’t be very useful. Like,
how do you find stuff? Its the most important thing. So for me it was a
personal goal to have something that would actually work. <br /><br />
But in any new company the first question is “what’s your business
model?” Even at the time they had this model of sponsored links that
would take your search query and link it to this ad inventory. I asked
them “how much is it per click?” and they said 5 cents per click which
is still their bottom price today - this is before they got into the
competitive bidding - and I did this math in the back of my mind “a
million clicks a day and 5 cents a click is $50K a day” — they can’t go
broke. <br /><br /> I had no idea how this would scale, in effect I
don’t think anybody understood this but it was clear that there was
enough interest in finding the people who were looking for stuff. Lets
say you search for a tennis racket. That means you’re probably a tennis
player and most likely there will be an ad that shows you tennis rackets
or tennis balls or something that relates to your interest. And the key
was you have an unlimited ad inventory, instead of having these banner
ads that I have never clicked on in my life, maybe once. <br /><br />
Banner ads are a waste of bandwidth essentially. These ads were highly
more relevant and even today except for spam mail its the most
cost-effective way of advertising or finding customers. It took
advantage of the fact that the Internet is a full-duplex communication
path whereas banner ads were more like TV — here’s your ad break and
here’s what you have to consume before you get to the next page.
<br /><br /> Google was an absolutely brilliant idea but funnily enough
their business really took off after the dot-com implosion in 2001. If
you look at their historical revenue what happened at that point I
believe was that people realized that they spent on banner ads was
basically wasted and they got back to an ROI calculation of where do we
apply money more cost-effectively and, yeah, so Google. Once people
started bidding for the keywords of course the price per click went up
but it still provides very very good value for advertisers.</p>

The Federal Reserve is expected to lower interest rates sometime in 2024
— but that didn’t happen this week and Fed Chair Jerome Powell said not
to expect it in March either. We’ll discuss the move (or lack thereof),
as well as pressure on the central bank to confront housing costs. Plus,
we’re getting more productive, churn in labor market isn’t as frenzied,
and Medicare will start negotiating drug prices.

what’s going to happen. A bunch of new networks are forming, and they
will melt into one, following a pattern established by the internet
itself, when they formed a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol">net
of nets</a> based on a common protocol called TCP. On top of that HTTP
was built, with a number of years following with very productive
building and bootstrapping, and from there it was a lot of chaos, around
the advent of Twitter, Facebook and Google Reader. The last time we had
a common way of
<a href="http://scripting.com/2014/03/21/theWebIsMadeOfInterop.html">interop</a>
was 17 years ago. I think/hope we’re incentivized to make one edit box
suffice, in place of the 5-10
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/01/14.html#a145854">tiny little
textboxes</a> we now all have to copy-paste between, and btw one way of
addressing nodes, and then we can start building again as we did last in
the 90s and 00s. I see something brilliant in the
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/31/24057231/iconfactory-kickstarter-internet-reader-project-tapestry-twitterrific">new
path</a> that Twitteriffic wants to go down (I gave
<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/iconfactory/project-tapestry">them</a>
$128). It’s same path I’ve been going down, mostly without partners, for
the 17 years since we crawled on land and started tweeting. I don’t see
the negative shit that’s happening on Twitter, it’s easy to avoid the
mess – I don’t think that’s the reason we’re breaking out of that silo –
it’s that all at once all the devs who had been quietly suffering with
Twitter were set free. Boom. All at once. And it turns out perhaps we
don’t give up so easily. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span></p>

Doorbell: Halt and Catch Fire</h2>

<pre><code>        &lt;div class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/simplisafe-video-doorbell-burnt-wires.jpg&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;auto&quot; class=&quot;insert-image&quot; alt=&quot;SimpliSafe Video Doorbell Pro burnt wires&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
This SimpliSafe doorbell burned up less than a week after I installed
it. I never would’ve thought a doorbell would be the most dangerous
thing I set up at my studio!
</p>
<p>
I learned a LOT about powering ‘smart’ doorbells, and talked directly to
SimpliSafe about it. They did sent a replacement, but it has it’s own
problems.
</p>
<p>
I’m still happy with SimpliSafe overall, but I don’t like how I’ve spent
about 8 hours troubleshooting a ‘smart’ doorbell. The only thing that’s
been 100% reliable on this thing is the basic ding dong I could’ve
gotten with a <a href="https://amzn.to/4987S9w">five dollar dumb
doorbell</a>!
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
This blog post is based off my latest moving vlog, episode 12, where I
talk about my SimpliSafe doorbell problems, the new 10G and 25G
networking gear I’m testing, and a new ‘retro corner’ in my office.
Check it out below:

THE TOP FIVE

<ol type="1">
<li>Podesta to become new climate envoy</li>
</ol>
</h3>
<p>
Senior Biden advisor John Podesta will take over from former Secretary
of State John Kerry as the U.S. special envoy for climate change, the
White House
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=fed2c77d47&e=f1409a4534" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a>.
Kerry, who’s stepping down this spring, was the first person to hold the
position; while his role was based at the State Department, Podesta will
instead remain at the White House,
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=b9c6e030f2&e=f1409a4534" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reports</a>
Maxine Joselow in the <em>Washington Post</em>, with his title changing
to “senior adviser to the president for international climate policy.”
</p>
<p>
The appointment marked an expansion of Podesta’s current role
implementing Biden’s signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act.
He’s going to continue that work — which, Joselow writes, probably means
he’ll travel less often than Kerry — but will now also be tapped to help
Biden manage relationships with foreign powers.
</p>
<p>
If you’d like some insight into how Podesta thinks about climate change
and the IRA, our
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=64f9b5a855&e=f1409a4534" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview
</a>with him from the sidelines of COP 28 in Dubai might be a good place
to start.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Climate laws begin at home</li>
</ol>
</h3>
<p>
The IRA and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (better known as
the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, or BIL) are filled with subsidies to
help with the clean energy transition. But, as I
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/ira-bil-tax-incentives-guides" target="_blank">wrote</a>
on the site yesterday, a new study shows that while the share of funds
for household improvements in each act is relatively small — about 12%
in the IRA and 5.7% in the BIL — the impact those improvements could
have on emissions is proportionally huge. Household emissions, the study
authors write, could decrease by as much as 40% by 2030.

<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>GM’s bringing back hybrids</li>
</ol>
</h3>
<p>
In the face of
<a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/dealers-to-gm-we-want-hybrids-5387d2bf" target="_blank">dealer
protests</a>, GM CEO Marry Barra told investors this week that the
automaker would bring back plug-in hybrids. That’s a reversal from the
company’s stance of just a few years ago,
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/gms-all-in-electric-future-now-includes-gasoline/" target="_blank">reports</a>
David Ferris at <em>E&amp;E News</em>, when GM said it was “all in” on
electric vehicles, and is a sign of the difficulties automakers have
faced in trying to switch over to EVs.
</p>
<p>
The announcement comes the same week as
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61344" target="_blank">new
data</a> showing EVs and hybrids made up more than 16% of total
light-duty vehicle sales in the U.S. in 2023, up from 12.9% in 2022.
Italian luxury automaker Lamborghini also
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/01/lamborghini-will-make-hybrid-versions-of-all-its-cars-to-cut-its-co2/" target="_blank">announced</a>

lawmakers who have long warned of the climate impacts of crypto
projects, which are so energy-hungry that they’ve spurred the reopening
of some shuttered fossil fuel plants.

“We intend to continue to analyze and write about the energy
implications of cryptocurrency mining activities in the United States,”
said EIA Administrator Joe DeCarolis in a

cryptocurrency mining is evolving, identify geographic areas of high
growth, and quantify the sources of electricity used to meet
cryptocurrency mining demand.”

They’re also another nail in the coffin of the Combined Charging

<p>date: 2024-02-01, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
The results from FAFSA, the form students and their parents fill out to
see how much financial aid they can get for college, won’t be released
this year until March. That’s more than a month later than initially
expected, and the delay is stressing out those who work with college
applicants. Plus, a look back at the life of Black entrepreneur and
economic activist A.G. Gaston.

<p>I write this not to advocate for people immigrating to the United
States or to campaign against them. This is a story about a desperate
journey that tens of thousands are making, in spite of the cost or
consequences. Because they feel they must. It is not about one person or
group. I am using the stories of Venezuelans as an example because so
many have fled their country and are coming to ours. In 2023, more than
260,000 Venezuelan migrants crossed the U.S.-Mexico border. Venezuela’s
migrants represent the largest displacement crisis in the world.</p>

the web giant’s ambitious advertising technology gets its blessing.…

On January 10th the forge that we use to host our projects was taken
down by DDoS attacks and was struggling to come back online(it’s back
now, read the
<a href="https://sourcehut.org/blog/2024-01-19-outage-post-mortem/" target="_blank">post-mortem</a>),
the event reminded us that we ought to host mirrors and release versions
of these source files ourselves. We have begun to
<a href="http://wiki.xxiivv.com/etc/" target="_blank">host copies</a>
across our various websites. The builds are still accessible through
<a href="https://hundredrabbits.itch.io/" target="_blank">itch.io</a>.
These will be automatically updated as we work on them in their
individual repositories, but mirrored there for reliability. We are
thankful for Sourcehut’s tireless work on resolving the issue and for
taking the time to communicate important changes.
</p>
<p>
In keeping with the spirit of improving the resilience of the tools we
use we’ve taken a moment to write a kind of pocket version of the
console emulator and
<a href="http://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/drifblim.html" target="_blank">self-hosted
assembler</a> as to see how many lines are needed to start from the seed
assembler and replicate it. A copy of the pocket emulator, the source
for the assembler and its hexadecimal representation have been
<a href="http://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/uxn.html" target="_blank">documented</a>.
</p>
<p>
On January 17th
<a href="https://100r.co/site/victoria.html" target="_blank">Victoria</a>
got its first
<a href="https://100r.co/media/content/stream/2024_snow.jpg" target="_blank">snowfall</a>,
with it came temperatures below freezing. We got to test our recent
improvements, like a new
<a href="https://100r.co/media/content/boat_projects/vent.jpg" target="_blank">louvered
closet vent</a> to help ventilate the space(there are also two existing
vents at the top, one on each side). The closet has been dry for the
first time in 3 years. We’ve made an effort not to keep too many items
on the floor so the area can breathe. We got ice inside of the windows
for the first time ever though… not ideal.

<p>Stef W. Kight and Zachary Basu of Axios reported tonight that the
border measure, on which a bipartisan group of senators have worked for
four months, is “on life support” after former president Trump urged his
supporters in the House to block it so he can run on the issue. Senators
are still holding out hope they can get it through, blaming
“misinformation” about the bill, whose text has not yet been
released.</p>

<h2 id="us-strikes-multiple-drones-in-yemen-american-official-says">US
Strikes Multiple Drones in Yemen, American Official Says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The United States struck up to 10 unmanned drones in
Yemen that were preparing to launch, a U.S. official said late on
Wednesday, amid escalating tensions from the war in Gaza spreading
through the region.</p>
<p>A U.S. Navy ship also shot down three Iranian drones and a Houthi
anti-ship ballistic missile in the Gulf of Aden, the U.S. military’s
Central Command said in a statement. There were no injuries or damage
reported, it said.</p>
<p>The Iran-aligned Houthi militants, who control the most populous
parts of Yemen, have launched a wave of exploding drones and missiles at
commercial vessels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden in recent weeks,
calling it a response to Israel’s military operations in Gaza and a show
of solidarity to Palestinians.</p>
<p>The Houthi campaign has disrupted international shipping.</p>
<p>The United States and Britain have launched strikes on Houthi targets
in Yemen and returned the militia to a list of “terrorist groups.”</p>
<p>The Houthis, earlier on Wednesday, said their naval forces carried
out an operation targeting an “American merchant ship” in the Gulf of
Aden hours after firing missiles at U.S. Navy destroyer Gravely.</p>
<p>Houthi attacks on ships in and around the Red Sea have slowed trade
between Asia and Europe, raised fears of supply bottlenecks and alarmed
major powers concerned that the Gaza war may become a regional
conflict.</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden said earlier in January that strikes on
Houthi targets would continue even as he acknowledged they may not be
halting their attacks.</p>
<p>Israel’s assault on the Hamas-run Gaza Strip followed a surprise
attack by Hamas militants on southern Israel on October 7, killing
1,200. The Gaza health ministry says nearly 27,000 people have been
killed in the fighting since.</p>

id="kataib-hezbollah-should-take-us-warning-seriously-white-house-says">Kataib
Hezbollah Should Take US Warning ‘Seriously,’ White House Says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The White House — National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby
warned that Kataib Hezbollah, an Iran-backed group based in Iraq, should
take “seriously” the Biden administration’s determination to respond to
Sunday’s drone attack by Iran-backed militants that killed three
American soldiers on a U.S. base in Jordan.</p>
<p>VOA White House Bureau Chief Patsy Widakuswara spoke with Kirby
following Kataib Hezbollah’s Tuesday announcement that it is suspending
all military operations against American troops in the region. Kirby
also discussed the war in Gaza and other challenges the U.S. is facing
around the world.</p>
<p>The following interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.</p>
<p>VOA: Do you attribute Kataib Hezbollah’s announcement to stop
attacking U.S. troops in the region to the president firmly signaling
that he is ready for a response?</p>
<p>JOHN KIRBY, NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL: It’s hard to know exactly why
Kataib Hezbollah put that statement out. They should take seriously the
determination of the United States and President [Joe] Biden to do what
we have to do to protect our troops, our facilities, our interests in
the region. They should take that very seriously.</p>
<p>VOA: You’re not attributing the attack to them. You’re attributing it
to their umbrella group, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq?</p>
<p>KIRBY: The Intelligence community’s comfortable with an assessment
that it was the umbrella group, Islamic Resistance in Iraq, that was
responsible for this attack. And as you know, there’s several groups
that are participants under that moniker.</p>
<p>VOA: And combining that answer with your statement that the U.S.
response will be multitiered over a period of time, can we assume that
what the president intends to do is striking different Iran-backed
proxies in the region over time?</p>
<p>KIRBY: I won’t get into the specific actions we’re going to take and
what the response looks like. The first thing that you see will not be
the last thing that you see.</p>
<p>VOA: You also said that striking these Iran-backed proxies won’t
jeopardize any kind of hostage negotiations with Hamas, but don’t these
groups have the same ideology?</p>
<p>KIRBY: What I said was, there’s no reason for what we’re doing to
protect our troops and our facilities to impact the negotiations that
we’re having to try to get another hostage deal in place, and we believe
both are important to do. And we’re pressing forward with both.</p>
<p>VOA: Are you saying one goal wouldn’t complicate the other?</p>
<p>KIRBY: I’m saying there’s no reason for there to be an effect on the
hostage negotiations that we’re in, by a response to this terrible
attack which killed three American soldiers.</p>
<p>VOA: U.S. funding for UNRWA won’t start until there are fundamental
changes in the agency. Those fundamental changes could take a while to
implement. What is the U.S. prepared to do in the meantime? Stand by and
allow war orphans to starve?</p>
<p>KIRBY: Of course not, and we are the world’s leading nation when it
comes to getting humanitarian assistance [to] the people of Gaza. And
UNRWA does essential work on the ground in Gaza. Make no mistake about
it, they’re helping save thousands of lives. They are the prime
distributor of aid and assistance inside Gaza, and we recognize
that.</p>
<p>We want them to take this seriously. Unacceptable that any employee
of UNRWA could be involved in the attacks on October 7, but we’re going
to wait and see how the investigation goes. We’re going to wait and see
what kind of accountability measures the U.N. and UNRWA, specifically,
are willing to put in place. But we’re going to continue to do
everything we can to get the security assistance into Gaza. And we
certainly want the vast majority of UNRWA employees, who have no
connection to Hamas, to be able to continue to do their job.</p>
<p>VOA: But you are admitting that stopping U.S. funding is impacting
their work, no?</p>
<p>KIRBY: It’s only affecting the work that we were doing in Jordan. The
suspension has nothing to do with Gaza. The money that we have left to
spend — that we suspended — has been already pre-earmarked by UNRWA for
use in Jordan, not for use in Gaza.</p>
<p>VOA: I’m going to move on to Ukraine funding. It appears that House
Republicans are rejecting any kind of border compromise, because they
don’t really want to give the president a win in an election year.</p>
<p>KIRBY: I certainly can’t talk about election politics or what may be
behind the motivations here. It’s critical that we get this funding for
Ukraine, for Israel, for the Indo-Pacific, and certainly for border
security.</p>
<p>The president is negotiating in good faith on the Senate side. We
believe those discussions are going well, and we hope to get a
resolution here relatively soon. Now, what happens in the House is going
to be up to Speaker [Mike] Johnson, and Speaker Johnson has not been
consistent in what he says he wants to see at the border. So, I would
point people to him. He has to speak for the inconsistencies in his
messaging. But we are negotiating in good faith. We believe those
negotiations are making progress, and that’s what we’re focused on.</p>
<p>VOA: Are you still sticking to that approach? Would you consider
sending a new stand-alone bill just for Ukraine?</p>
<p>KIRBY: I don’t want to get ahead of where we are. I mean, we are in
the midst of negotiations right now that are not over. So, I wouldn’t
want to get into speculating about what hypotheticals might happen as a
result.</p>
<p>VOA: Can you confirm reporting that Chinese President Xi Jinping
promised President Biden that China will not meddle in U.S.
elections?</p>
<p>KIRBY: We gave a full summary of that meeting. The president talked
to you all after he met with President Xi. I don’t have any additional
context to share. All I can tell you is that we take the soundness of
our election system here in the United States very, very seriously. And
we’ve been clear publicly, and we’ve been clear privately with
interlocutors all around the world that we will do what we have to do to
make sure that our elections are free and fair. And they have been, and
they will continue to be.</p>
<p>VOA: But just today, Christopher Ray, the FBI director, gave
testimony in Congress that Chinese hackers might be targeting U.S.
infrastructure, targeting all sorts of things that may disrupt even the
election. How do you square that?</p>
<p>KIRBY: I won’t speak to specific threats. All I can tell you is we
take them seriously. We do everything we can to preserve critical
infrastructure, and in the president’s mind, our election system is
critical infrastructure.</p>
<p>VOA: A new report released by the U.N. sanctions monitoring team
today says that al-Qaida has established eight new training camps and a
new base to stockpile weaponry in Afghanistan. Are you aware, and are
you countering?</p>
<p>KIRBY: I think we’re just aware of this report. We haven’t worked our
way all the way through it. But I think it’s important to remember that
al-Qaida is a vastly diminished organization in Afghanistan and
elsewhere. In fact, the real threat from al-Qaida is the way it’s
metastasized into other groups elsewhere in the region, like al-Shabab
in Somalia.</p>
<p>VOA: Are you downplaying the threat?</p>
<p>KIRBY: Of course not. We’re not downplaying any terrorist threat
anywhere in the world. Those three American soldiers that were killed
were involved in helping our counter ISIS coalition, which is still
active in Iraq and Syria. I don’t think the record bears out that we’ve
been light on terrorist networks at all, killing [al-Qaida chief Ayman]
al-Zawahiri and other leaders in ISIS in just recent weeks and months.
What I’m saying is, this is a report we haven’t worked our way through
right now, and the intelligence community, their assessment is that
al-Qaida does not pose an immediate threat to U.S. soil.</p>
<p>VOA: Tomorrow, the president will participate in the dignified
transfer of the three American soldiers who died in Jordan. How do you
think that will impact Americans’ thinking about the conflict in the
Middle East?</p>
<p>KIRBY: I hope it underscores Americans’ gratitude for the service,
and in many cases, the sacrifice that American men and women in uniform
are demonstrating on their behalf, to keep them safe. And that’s
certainly the case with these three brave individuals who aren’t going
to make it back home alive to their families.</p>
<p>And I hope it’s also a reminder of how diligently President Biden is
working to keep the conflict between Israel and Hamas from escalating
and widening into a broader regional conflict. We don’t seek a war with
Iran. We don’t want to see a broader conflict, and almost everything the
president has done since the seventh of October has been designed to
prevent that from happening.</p>

A number of residents expressed concern in March, when The Signal first
reported a Starbucks expansion into a well-traversed east-side
intersection with a longstanding feature some referred to as a landmark
— a square turret of a digital clock tower that sits in front of the
coffee shop.  Then, the city provided those concerned residents with […]

id="john-podesta-to-be-top-us-international-adviser-on-climate-change">John
Podesta to be Top US International Adviser on Climate Change</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — White House senior adviser John Podesta will add
international climate policy to his job responsibilities, replacing
special climate envoy John Kerry as the top U.S. official on
international climate issues, the White House said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Kerry announced in mid-January that he would step down from the
climate job to work on President Joe Biden’s reelection campaign.
Podesta will take over Kerry’s responsibilities, though not his title,
when he departs, likely this spring, the White House said.</p>
<p>Podesta was a behind-the-scenes veteran on climate in past Democratic
administrations. He was brought back to the White House last year to put
into place an ambitious U.S. climate program revived with the $375
billion approved in the 2022 climate law. He also led the
administration’s climate task force.</p>
<p>Kerry’s job was created by the Biden administration specifically to
fight climate change on the global stage. Kerry has been in the position
since Biden took office in 2021.</p>
<p>Kerry’s appointment did not require confirmation by the Senate, but a
law passed in 2022 requires that special envoys reporting to the
secretary of state will have to win Senate approval.</p>
<p>In a step that avoids a potential partisan fight in the Senate,
Podesta was not named as climate envoy but rather a senior adviser to
the president for international climate policy.</p>
<p>As outlined Wednesday by the White House, Podesta will continue to be
involved in overseeing federal spending under the climate law, known as
the Inflation Reduction Act, along with domestic climate priorities,
adding the international portfolio that Kerry handled. The job will not
require Senate confirmation.</p>
<p>White House Chief of Staff Jeff Zients said Kerry “has tirelessly
trekked around the world’’ to help confront the climate crisis, most
recently at a U.N. climate conference in Dubai late last year.</p>
<p>“There is no one better than John Podesta to make sure” the U.S.
continues to “meet the gravity of this moment,” Zients said, calling
Podesta “a fierce champion for bold climate action” who has served three
Democratic presidents and has Biden’s trust.</p>
<p>The Washington Post first reported Podesta’s appointment.</p>

<h2 id="installing-pgloader-from-source">Installing pgloader from
source</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-01, from: Robert’s Ramblings</p>
<p>I’m working on macOS at the moment but I don’t use Home Brew so the
instructions to install pgloader are problematic for me. Except I know
pgloader is a Lisp program and once upon a time I had three different
Lisps running on a previous Mac. So what follows is my modified
instructions for bringing pgloader up on my current Mac Mini running
macOS Sonoma 14.3 with Xcode already installed.</p>
<p>pgloader is written in common list but the instructions at
https://pgloader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html specifically
mention compiling with <a href="https://sbcl.org">SBCL</a> which is one
of the Lisps I’ve used in the past. But SBCL isn’t (yet) installed on my
machine and SBCL is usually compiled using SBCL but can be compiled
using other common lists. Enter <a
href="https://ecl.common-lisp.dev/">ECL</a>, aka Embedded Common-Lisp.
ECL compiles via a C compiler including the funky setup that macOS has.
This means the prep for my machine should look something like</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Compile then install ECL</li>
<li>Use ECL to compile SBCL</li>
