## Lawsuit to Reveal Wikipedia Editors

date: 2024-11-15, from: Michael Tsai

Glyn Moody: As Techdirt stories attest, Wikipedia has been attacked in the past for publishing true information that somebody doesn&#8217;t like. As well as wanting articles to be censored, those behind such attacks often also demand the names of those who worked on the article. Something similar is now happening in India, where the Indian [&#8230;]

## Revived Class Action Against McGraw Hill: the Importance of Publishing Contracts

date: 2024-11-15, from: Authors Union blogs

At the heart of the Flynn v. McGraw Hill case is a breach of contract claim. The plaintiffs argue that McGraw Hill's royalty deductions for maintaining its online system violated the terms of the agreement. Central to the argument is the publisher’s promise to 'publish at its own expense.' This case serves as a prime example of how important it is to scrutinize the details of a publishing agreement, where the devil often lies.
