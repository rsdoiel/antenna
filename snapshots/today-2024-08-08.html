<h2 id="man-pages">2024-08-08 Man pages</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-08, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2024-08-08-man-pages">
2024-08-08 Man pages
</h1>
<p>
Here’s a great thing on the command line. You want to use the command
<strong>foo</strong> and don’t know how, so you run <strong>man
foo</strong> and read the manual page. Sometimes there will be more info
in different “sections”. Commands are in section 1, which is why
documentation would sometimes refer to the command “foo” as
<strong>foo(1)</strong> because <strong>foo(5)</strong> might document
the file format or the config file that goes along with the command.
</p>
<p>
If that’s news to you, run <strong>man man</strong>. And if you find the
structure bewildering, read the manual on how to write manual pages:
<strong>man man-pages</strong> (section 7).
</p>
<p>
I’ve embraced man pages because when I write Perl code, I can put
documentation into the script such that when the script is installed, it
automatically works as its own man page – this works for
<a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/App-jupiter">jupiter</a>,
<a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/App-BookmarkFeed">bookmark-feed</a> –
it also works for bigger projects, like
<a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/App-Phoebe">phoebe</a> where each
extension is also a Perl module and therefore also gets its own man
page.
</p>
<p>
For programming languages where the documentation is more focused on
documenting the code, things are different. Of course, there’s
<code>pydoc</code> for Python code and <code>go doc</code> for Go code,
but it’s not great. The list of variables and functions are maybe
suitable for libraries, but not for applications.
</p>
<p>
Since I don’t enjoy writing man pages directly (<code>man</code> is
actually a macro package for the <code>nroff</code> language, see
<strong>man nroff</strong>, obviously) I write my documentation in the
<a href="https://gitlab.com/ddevault/scdoc">scdoc</a> format.
<a class="account" href="https://fosstodon.org/@drewdevault" title="@drewdevault@fosstodon.org"><span
class="citation" data-cites="drewdevault">@drewdevault</span></a> wrote
it <a href="https://drewdevault.com/2018/05/13/scdoc.html">in 2018</a>.
It looks a bit like Markdown and friends and I like it. I even put a
little sequence of <code>sed</code> expressions into a Makefile to turn
scdoc into Markdown so that I could publish the man pages on this site,
see <a href="oddmu/index">Oddµ man pages</a>.
</p>
<p>
When documentation for a project is a website, I wonder how they serve
people offline or with bad connections. Perhaps they want to write the
documentation in texinfo? I haven’t done that in a long time but I
really enjoy reading a well-written manual like that. And you can get a
PDF for free but I’m not sure anybody really wants that. Even a README
is bad because in those rare cases where the program gets added to a
distro, how will end-users find the README? Man pages are the answer.
</p>
<p>
README files and offline copies of the HTML documentation have multiple
problems.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Which directory is it, exactly? <code>/usr/doc</code> does not exist on
my system. <code>/usr/share</code> lists lots of package names but these
are not the docs. <code>/usr/share/doc</code> is the one! But the
problems continue. Which is the file that you want to read when you’re
faced with <code>BUGS changelog.Debian.gz changelog.gz copyright README
README.Debian README.frames RELEASE-NOTES.txt WhatsNew.gz</code> – it’s
README, I guess, but I am always confused. Sometimes you’re looking at
binary and it’s also not obvious what the package name would be.
<code>find</code> is in <code>/usr/share/doc/findutils</code>, for
example.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Compared to this, man pages are so much better.
</p>
<p>
And some package managers like <code>go</code>, <code>pip</code>
(Python), <code>cabal</code> (Haskell) and <code>cargo</code> (Rust)
don’t install any of these files, I think.
</p>
<p>
I suspect that many developers consider using a website like
<a href="https://about.readthedocs.com/">Read the Docs</a> to be good
enough. Bad luck for people who are offline or who have bad reception,
in hotel rooms with bad wife, in planes? My sister lives in the Rhine
valley, on the German side, close to Switzerland, in a tiny village of a
bit more than 100 people. They have no glass fibre. They have bad
reception, both from Switzerland and from Germany. It’s terrible! But
even for me: I have wifi in the apartment and glass windows that act
that block the signal. I have no reception on the balcony unless I use
my phone as a hotspot.
</p>
<p>
Local documentation that is easy to find is so much better.
</p>
<p>
And man pages are powerful. <em>All</em> of Perl is documented in many
pages. All the modules. All the switches. All the language features. I
learned to program in Perl from man pages back when my browser was
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCSA_Mosaic">NCSA Mosaic</a>. (I
am a bit astonished to find that I still knew that acronym! But I didn’t
know that it stands for National Center for Supercomputing
Applications.) Anyway, what I wanted to say is that man pages can be
used to document large and complex things. From the command line, they
are readily accessible. With the right man reader, they can act as a
hypertext, linking to other pages. They don’t have to be terse and
cryptic, either. Man pages can be tutorials, introductions, FAQs, and
more. And if you write man pages using a suitable format, you can still
generate HTML pages with links.
</p>
<p>
If you’re not writing man pages, if your community doesn’t have the
habit of writing man pages, start small. Get <code>scdoc</code> and
write a little something. Skim <strong>man man-pages</strong> and learn
about the conventions, then write some text files. Then use <code>scdoc
&lt; text-file &gt; man-page</code> to create the file and install them
into <code>~/.local/share/man</code>, following the conventions. A page
from section 1 (commands) has the extension “.1” and goes into
<code>~/.local/share/man/man1</code> whereas a page from section 5 (file
formats and config files) has the extension “.5” and goes into
<code>~/.local/share/man/man5</code>.

<p>
The <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/">$5
Raspberry Pi Pico 2</a> was announced today, with a new chip, the
RP2350. This silicon improves on almost every aspect of the RP2040:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
3 PIOs instead of 2
</li>
<li>
150 MHz instead of 133 MHz base clock
</li>
<li>
Faster Arm Cortex M33 cores <em>and</em> RISC-V Hazard3 cores
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I’ve had access to pre-release hardware and good news: even though the
new chip is faster and has more features, it actually uses <em>less</em>
power than RP2040, meaning if you run one of these things off a battery,
it’ll last longer.
</p>
<p>
I’ll talk more about power later, but first, here’s the specs.

id="houthis-undeterred-despite-us-action-to-protect-red-sea-shipping">Houthis
undeterred despite US action to protect Red Sea shipping</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — U.S.-led efforts to thwart attacks on international
shipping by Iranian-backed Houthi militants in Yemen are nothing more
than a “shock absorber” and are unlikely to lead to stability or safer
seas, according to a senior U.S. commander.</p>
<p>Vice Admiral George Wikoff, who heads the U.S. naval efforts in the
Middle East, shared the blunt assessment Wednesday, saying that not only
have U.S. strikes and defensive efforts done little to change the
Houthis’ behavior, it now appears unlikely the group will be swayed by
military force.</p>
<p>“The solution is not going to come at the end of a weapon system,”
Wikoff told an audience in Washington, speaking via video from U.S. 5th
Fleet headquarters in Bahrain.</p>
<p>“We have certainly degraded their capability. There’s no doubt about
that. We’ve degraded their ability,” he said. “However, have we stopped
them? No.”</p>
<p>The comments build on other U.S. assessments that have questioned the
ability of the United States and its allies to stop the Houthis from
targeting commercial ships transiting the Red Sea, which account for up
to 15% of international maritime trade.</p>
<p>An unclassified report issued this past June by the U.S. Defense
Intelligence Agency, or DIA, found container shipping in the region
plunged by 90% from December 2023 through mid-February 2024.</p>
<p>It also warned that despite U.S. and European countermeasures, such
as the U.S.-led Operation Prosperity Guardian and the European Union’s
ASPIDES mission, the Houthis still carried out more than 43 attacks
between November 19 and March 23, driving up security costs and
insurance premiums.</p>
<p>Wikoff on Wednesday said U.S. forces have seen some signs of
stabilization since February but called it an “unacceptable
stabilization,” with the number of ships crossing the Bab el Mandeb
Strait, which connects the Red Sea with the Gulf of Aden, still down by
about half.</p>
<p>Yet the attacks and threats to commercial shipping and U.S. forces in
the region persist.</p>
<p>Houthi officials Wednesday claimed they launched attacks on a
container ship and on two U.S. military vessels, although a U.S. defense
official told VOA there was no “operational reporting to support those
claims.”</p>
<p>Separately, U.S. Central Command, which oversees American troops in
the Middle East, has said its forces have destroyed seven Houthi aerial
drones, seven Houthi missiles, one Houthi naval drone and one Houthi
missile launcher, all in the past five days.</p>
<p>“It’s a struggle we have every day to try to figure out where are we
on the meter with regards to stability in the region,” Wikoff said.</p>
<p>The Houthis have said their campaign in the Red Sea and the Gulf of
Aden is to show solidarity with the Palestinians in Gaza amid the war
between Israel and Hamas.</p>
<p>But Wikoff pushed back against that notion, noting Houthi attacks on
shipping predate the war while describing the U.S.-designated terror
group as “a weapon looking for a reason to use it.”</p>
<p>And if the Houthis have anything they value enough that they do not
want to risk using it, the U.S. and its partners have yet to find
it.</p>
<p>“It’s very difficult to find a centralized center of gravity that we
can hold at risk over time and use that as a potential point of
deterrence,” Wikoff said. “So, trying to apply a classic deterrence
policy in this particular scenario is a bit challenging.”</p>
<p>It is an argument some experts have been making for months.</p>
<p>“We have very little leverage over the Houthis, and air strikes are
unlikely to deter them,” according to Elisabeth Kendall, a Yemen
specialist at the University of Cambridge in Britain.</p>
<p>“They have a high tolerance for casualties, they are highly
adaptable, they do not need sophisticated weapons to wreak havoc, they
just need to keep going — not losing is winning, and they believe they
have God on their side,” she told VOA via email. “In reality, air
strikes by the U.S. and U.K. benefit the Houthis by providing evidence
to back up their propaganda narratives against the U.S. and its
allies.”</p>
<p>But other experts, such as former British Ambassador to Yemen Edmund
Fitton-Brown, are more critical of the approach taken by the U.S. and
its allies in trying to degrade and dissuade the Houthi attacks.</p>
<p>The U.S.-led responses have been “meticulously proportionate,” said
Fitton-Brown, now a senior adviser for the New York and Berlin-based
Counter Extremism Project.</p>
<p>“We need to be more determined and creative about what to do about
this,” he said. “We are looking at a de facto authority, and a de facto
authority has fixed points you can attack.”</p>
<p>“They have military bases that were previously in the hands of the
government. They have intelligence headquarters. They have security
deployments in [the port city of] Hodeidah,” Fitton-Brown told VOA.
“Significant escalation of targeting is possible without changing the
legal status of the conflict.”</p>
<p>The U.S. vice admiral in charge of U.S. naval forces in the region,
however, is wary that military force will ultimately move the
Houthis.</p>
<p>“Our mission remains to disrupt their ability and try to preserve
some semblance of maritime order while we give an opportunity for policy
to be developed against the Houthis,” Wikoff said. “The more players in
the field that can get involved in a diplomatic piece of this, the
better off I think we’ll be.”</p>

<p>
To keep me and my brain running during working hours costs me
~$359.26/month. Not much to say beyond that –no grand epiphanies– except
that I think it’s too expensive. Sitting in an office by myself costs me
$16.33/day (or $2/hour). This budget doesn’t include breakfast, dinner,
exercise, healthcare, transit, internet, electricity, or office
supplies… all necessities that enable the work. This is just the daily
cost of caloric fuel to keep my body going during the nine-to-five. My
family has three other humans in it too, so this seems collossaly
expensive.
</p>
<p>
If I wanted to save money (I sort of do), here’s what I’d could try to
optimize from top to bottom:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
I could make my own pre-made meals for about ~$2/meal. I’ve had success
with this but it requires a lot of weekend logistics to execute
properly. This would be the most significant cost reduction, costing
only $44/month and saving $176/month.
</li>
<li>
I could buy whey protein in bulk. A 5 lb bag of Muscle Milk (nearest
approximate flavor) is $72/bag and contains 68 servings for a reduced
costs of $1.05/serving. However, one serving only has 25g of protein, so
if I’d need to double the scoops. The total cost would then be
$2.11/serving or $46.42/month. Buying bulk powder makes fiscal sense,
but $30/month to not have to deal with drinking clumpy protein shakes
and washing crusted stinky shakers seems almost worth it.
</li>
<li>
I considered eggs as an alternate source of protein instead. A single
egg has ~6g of protein and costs about 50¢. The cost could potentially
come down but the bigger issue is to get the same 42g of protein I’d
need to eat 7 eggs. I don’t know if you’ve eaten eggs before but <u>7
eggs is a lot of eggs</u>. Imagine woofing down 7 sweaty hard-boiled
orbs a couple times a day, yikes.
</li>
<li>
I could brew my own agave-sweetened tea. I’ve done this once, but the
crisp flavor profile wasn’t the same so I wouldn’t call it a success.
Needs more experimentation.
</li>
<li>
Thanks to Costco selling our favorite local coffee roaster in bulk, we
have caffeine ritual costs dialed down about as low as they can go. Feel
comfortable there.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Lowering my lunch costs stands out as the best candidate for
improvement. But
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2023/10/snap-kitchen/">as I noted
before</a>, adding even a small pile of extra duties risks toppling the
wagon and I’m back to eating emergency $14 Spicy Chicken Sando Combos to
quench my hunger. I wonder where my daily costs fit on a graph of
national statistics. Is this average? Is this Bidenomic inflation? Am I
making myself poor with my avocado toast? Someone who understands
finances help me budget! Ack!

id="worlds-largest-3d-printed-neighborhood-nears-completion-in-texas">World’s
largest 3D-printed neighborhood nears completion in Texas</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>GEORGETOWN, Texas — As with any desktop 3D printer, the Vulcan
printer pipes layer by layer to build an object – except this printer is
more than 45 feet (13.7 m) wide, weighs 4.75 tons and prints residential
homes.</p>
<p>This summer, the robotic printer from ICON is finishing the last few
of 100 3D-printed houses in Wolf Ranch, a community in Georgetown,
Texas, about 30 miles from Austin.</p>
<p>ICON began printing the walls of what it says is the world’s largest
3D-printed community in November 2022. Compared to traditional
construction, the company says that 3D printing homes is faster, less
expensive, requires fewer workers, and minimizes construction material
waste.</p>
<p>“It brings a lot of efficiency to the trade market,” said ICON senior
project manager Conner Jenkins. “So, where there were maybe five
different crews coming in to build a wall system, we now have one crew
and one robot.”</p>
<p>After concrete powder, water, sand and other additives are mixed
together and pumped into the printer, a nozzle squeezes out the concrete
mixture like toothpaste onto a brush, building up layer by layer along a
pre-programmed path that creates corduroy-effect walls.</p>
<p>The single-story three- to four-bedroom homes take about three weeks
to finish printing, with the foundation and metal roofs installed
traditionally.</p>
<p>Jenkins said the concrete walls are designed to be resistant to
water, mold, termites and extreme weather.</p>
<p>Lawrence Nourzad, a 32-year-old business development director, and
his girlfriend Angela Hontas, a 29-year-old creative strategist,
purchased a Wolf Ranch home earlier this summer.</p>
<p>“It feels like a fortress,” Nourzad said, adding that he was
confident it would be resilient to most tornados.</p>
<p>The walls also provide strong insulation from the Texas heat, the
couple said, keeping the interior temperature cool even when the air
conditioner wasn’t on full blast.</p>
<p>There was one other thing the 3D-printed walls seemed to protect
against, however: a solid wireless internet connection.</p>
<p>“Obviously these are really strong, thick walls. And that’s what
provides a lot of value for us as homeowners and keeps this thing really
well-insulated in a Texas summer, but signal doesn’t transfer through
these walls very well,” Nourzad said.</p>
<p>To alleviate this issue, an ICON spokeswoman said most Wolf Ranch
homeowners use mesh internet routers, which broadcast a signal from
multiple units placed throughout a home, versus a traditional router
which sends a signal from one device.</p>
<p>The 3D-printed homes at Wolf Ranch, called the “Genesis Collection”
by developers, range in price from around $450,000 to close to $600,000.
Developers said a little more than one quarter of the 100 homes have
been sold.</p>
<p>ICON, which 3D-printed its first home in Austin in 2018, hopes to one
day take its technology to the Moon. NASA, as part of its Artemis Moon
exploration program, has contracted ICON to develop a construction
system capable of building landing pads, shelters, and other structures
on the lunar surface.</p>

<p>date: 2024-08-08, from: Ben Werdmuller’s blog</p>
<div class="e-content aside-content">
<p>
Every so often, a post goes around in tech circles about how news is bad
and we shouldn’t pay attention to it. I think that’s ludicrous.
</p>
<p>
Today’s was a post from 2022 called <a href="https://chuck.is/news/">The
News is Information Junk Food</a>. I think it’s a bad argument that
could have poor consequences.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41189946">It was featured
on Hacker News</a>, so, gods help me, I commented there.
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41191334">Here’s what I
said</a>:
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
<em>This is a pretty bad take.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>For example, multiple studies have shown that in communities that
aren’t addressed by a robust local news outlet, local corruption goes
up. Having a good newsroom does improve an understanding of what your
representatives are up to, and a lack of information does allow them to
get up to more behind our backs.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>I think the biggest failure of this piece is to make all news
equivalent. Yes, much cable news is junk; yes, many of the corporate
newsrooms that churn out hundreds of articles a day are junk. They use
engagement as a metric for success rather than finding ways to align
themselves with impact and creating an informed, empowered electorate.
That last thing - an informed, empowered electorate - is what it’s all
about.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>Real journalism that is diligently undertaken in the public interest
does make a real difference. (Should we know whether Clarence Thomas was
taking corrupt bribes? Yes. Should we know how climate change is
progressing? Yes. Should we know if the police are killing innocent
people? Yes. Should we know that the police at the Uvalde school
shooting hung around for over an hour doing nothing? Yes.) Telling
people not to pay attention to the world around them results in an
electorate who cannot meaningfully vote on real issues.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>For those of us who build software, we need to know the factors that
impact the lives of the people we’re serving. We need to know the trends
in the marketplaces and communities where we show up. The news is good
for that, too.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>Turn off cable news; pay more attention to non-profit news; go for
long-form written journalism. Stay informed.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>It’s absolutely true that we take a psychic hit for doing so. I’d
say that’s more to do with the world than it is the media overall.
Perhaps we should spend more time trying to make it better?</em>
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
One user responded:
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
<em>The key is to focus on local news: these are updates that a person
can take action upon.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>Seeing the latest tragedies on the other side of the world catches
headlines, but rarely actionable by regular people.</em>
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
To which I replied:
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
<em>We all have foreign policies. For example, in the US, our government
is heavily involved in Gaza and Ukraine. It’s far away, but it’s also
highly relevant to how our representatives work on our behalf.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>Should we give aid to other countries? How should we think about
global society? Those things are all relevant, too.</em>
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
The bottom line to my argument: Journalism is a key to understanding the
world around us. We shouldn’t give ourselves excuses to look away.

<h2 id="apple-memory-holed-its-broken-promise-for-an-ocsp-opt-out">Apple
memory holed its broken promise for an OCSP opt-out</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-08, from: OS News</p>
<p>When you launch an app, macOS connects to Apple’s OCSP service to
check whether the app’s Developer ID code signing certificate has been
revoked by Apple. In November 2020, Apple’s OCSP service experienced a
mass outage, preventing Mac users worldwide from launching apps. In
response and remedy to this outage, Apple made several explicit promises
to Mac users in a support document, which can still be seen in a Wayback
Machine archive from September 24, 2023. ↫ Jeff Johnson One of the
explicit promises Apple made was that it would allow macOS users to turn
off phoning home to Cupertino every time you launch an application on
macOS. It’s four years later now, and this promise has not been kept –
Apple still does not allow you to turn off phoning home. In fact, it
turns out that last year, Apple scrubbed this promise from all of its
documentation, hoping we’re all going to forget about it. In other
words, Apple is never going to allow its macOS users to stop the
operating system from phoning home to Cupertino every time you launch an
application. Even though the boiling frog story is nonsensical, it’s apt
here. More and more Apple is limiting its users’ control over macOS,
locking it down to a point where you’re not really the owner of your
computer anymore. Stuff like this gives me the creeps.</p>

id="tropical-storm-debby-makes-2nd-landfall-in-south-carolina-heavy-rain-expected-up-the-east-coast">Tropical
Storm Debby makes 2nd landfall in South Carolina, heavy rain expected up
the East Coast</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>HUGER, S.C. — Tropical Storm Debby has made a second landfall in
South Carolina on its way up the East Coast, where residents as far
north as Vermont could get several inches of rain this weekend.</p>
<p>The National Hurricane Center says Debby came ashore early Thursday
near Bulls Bay, South Carolina. The storm is expected to keep moving
inland, spreading heavy rain and possible flooding all the way up
through the mid-Atlantic and the Northeast by the weekend.</p>
<p>Debby first made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday on
the Gulf Coast of Florida. It is now a tropical storm with maximum
sustained winds at 50 mph (80 kph).</p>
<p>Considerable flooding is expected across parts of eastern South
Carolina and southeast North Carolina through Friday, with an additional
3 to 9 inches (8 to 23 centimeters) of rain forecast, as well as in
portions of Virginia, according to the hurricane center.</p>
<p>Days of rain have forced the deluge-hardened residents of a South
Carolina community to begin the near-ritualistic task of assessing
damage left behind by Debby, which continued spinning over the Atlantic
Ocean and influencing thunderstorms from the East Coast to the Great
Lakes on Wednesday. The National Weather Service’s office in Charleston
also said survey teams confirmed four-Debby related tornadoes.</p>
<p>In Huger, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) northeast of Charleston,
Gene Taylor was waiting in the afternoon for a few inches of water to
drain from his house along French Quarter Creek as high tide passed.</p>
<p>Taylor saw the potential for flooding last week and started moving
belongings out or up higher in his home. It’s a lesson learned the hard
way — Taylor estimated that this is the fourth time he has had
floodwater in his home in the past nine years.</p>
<p>“To save everything, we’ve learned from the past it’s better be
prepared for the worst. And unfortunately, I think we got it,” Taylor
said.</p>
<p>A few doors down, Charles Grainger was cleaning up after about 8
inches (20 centimeters) of water got into his home.</p>
<p>“Eight inches disrupts your whole life,” Grainger said. “You don’t
get used to it. You just grin and bear it. It’s part of living on the
creek.”</p>
<p>In Georgia, at least four dams were breached northwest of Savannah in
Bulloch County, but no deaths had been reported, authorities said at a
briefing.</p>
<p>More than 75 people were rescued from floodwaters in the county, said
Corey Kemp, director of emergency management, and about 100 roads were
closed.</p>
<p>“We’ve been faced with a lot of things we’ve never been faced with
before,” Bulloch County Commission Chairman Roy Thompson said. “I’m
78-plus years old and have never seen anything like this before in
Bulloch County. It’s amazing what has happened, and amazing what is
going to continue to happen until all these waters get out of here.”</p>
<p>For residents on Tappan Zee Drive in suburban Pooler, west of
Savannah, Georgia, the drenching that Debby delivered came with a
painful dose of déjà vu. In October 2016, Hurricane Matthew overflowed a
nearby canal and flooded several of the same homes.</p>
<p>Located roughly 30 miles (50 kilometers) inland from the Atlantic
Ocean, with no creeks or rivers nearby, the neighborhood doesn’t seem
like a high-risk location for tropical flooding. But residents say
drainage problems have plagued their street for well over a decade,
despite local government efforts to fix them.</p>
<p>Debby also dumped rain on communities all the way up to the Great
Lakes and New York and New Jersey. Moisture from the tropical storm
strengthened another system Tuesday evening, which caused strong
thunderstorms, according to weather service meteorologist Scott
Kleebauer.</p>
<p>“We had a multi-round period of showers and thunderstorms that kind
of scooted from Michigan eastward,” Kleebauer said.</p>
<p>As much as 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell in parts of New
Jersey in less than four hours.</p>
<p>Emergency officials in New York City warned of potential flash
flooding, flying drones with loudspeakers in some neighborhoods to tell
people in basement apartments to be ready to flee at a moment’s notice.
Multiple water rescues were reported in and near the city.</p>
<p>About 270,000 customers remained without power in Ohio as of Thursday
morning, according to PowerOutage.us, following severe storms including
two confirmed tornadoes. Utility officials with FirstEnergy’s
Illuminating Company said via social media that power restoration would
take days due to the damage.</p>
<p>In South Carolina, Gov. Henry McMaster said his state was just
entering Act 2 of a three-act play, after more than 60 homes were
damaged but roads and water systems were without significant
problems.</p>
<p>The final act may come next week if enough rain falls upstream in
North Carolina to cause major flooding along rivers as they flow to the
Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>A state of emergency was in effect for both North Carolina and
Virginia. Maryland issued a state of preparedness declaration that
coordinates preparations without declaring an emergency.</p>
<p>At least six people have died due to the storm, five of them in
traffic accidents or from fallen trees. The sixth death involved a
48-year-old man in Gulfport, Florida, whose body was recovered after his
anchored sailboat partially sank.</p>

Louisiana’s Cancer Alley, company cancels plans for grain export
facility in historic Black town</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WALLACE, La. — Residents of a historic Black community in Louisiana
who’ve spent years fighting against a massive grain export facility set
to be built on the grounds where their enslaved ancestors once lived
appear to have finally halted the project.</p>
<p>A representative from the company, Greenfield Louisiana LLC,
announced during a public hearing on Tuesday evening that the company is
“ceasing all plans” to construct a grain export facility in the middle
of the town of Wallace in St. John the Baptist Parish.</p>
<p>After a moment, opponents of the project broke out in cheers and
began clapping and hugging each other.</p>
<p>“I’m still obviously in disbelief — I can’t believe this is
happening, but I’m ecstatic and all praise to the ancestors,” said Joy
Banner, a Wallace resident and one of the most vocal opponents of the
project. She and her sister, Jo, founded The Descendants Project to
preserve the community’s heritage.</p>
<p>The company’s announcement signaled a rare win for a community in a
heavily industrialized stretch of the Mississippi River known as “Cancer
Alley” for its high levels of pollution. Wallace is about 80 kilometers
west of New Orleans.</p>
<p>“I think all of the fighting – it is coming from the love and the
passion for our communities we have here along the river, and to show
the world we can and you should fight,” Banner said. “We are recognizing
that we do have power – that power comes from the love we have for our
community.”</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the Banner sisters’ nonprofit purchased a
plantation which had been the site of one of the largest slave
rebellions in American History, the 1811 German Coast Uprising. They
plan to transform it into an educational space.</p>
<p>The Army Corps of Engineers had already determined the 90-hectare
facility could adversely impact cultural heritage sites in Wallace and
was tasked with reviewing Greenfield’s application.</p>
<p>Army Corps representative Brad LaBorde said his agency had not been
informed in advance of the company’s unexpected decision to cancel plans
for the facility.</p>
<p>“We don’t know exactly what that means,” LaBorde said. “We still have
an active permit application so, if it is Greenfield’s intention to no
longer pursue the project, then we would ask they formally submit a
withdrawal to us so that we can conclude the review.”</p>
<p>Lynda Van Davis, Greenfield’s counsel and head of external affairs,
said the long delay in government approval for the project has been “an
expensive ordeal,” adding that she did not have an answer for when the
company would submit a formal withdrawal to the Army Corps.</p>
<p>“This has been a difficult ride the whole time, we didn’t wake up
yesterday and say we’re done,” Van Davis said. “We said we’ll stay in
the fight a little bit longer, because we’ve become friends with this
community. Unfortunately, how long are we supposed to stay in this
fight?”</p>
<p>The Army Corps had found the project could affect historic properties
in Wallace, including the Evergreen, Oak Alley and Whitney plantations.
There also remained the possibility that the area contained burial sites
for the ancestral Black community.</p>
<p>Some community members had supported the project, believing it would
bring jobs to their town, even as opponents of the facility said tourism
surrounding cultural heritage was already a thriving industry that
deserved greater investment.</p>
<p>“I was looking forward to economic development in my community –
jobs, new businesses, just all around better living for my community,”
said Nicole Dumas, 48, a Wallace resident, who supported the
project.</p>
<p>But the evening became a celebration for others. Angelica Mitchell,
53, held back tears as she took in the company’s announcement. Mitchell
is still recovering from treatment for a rare form of cancer which had
attacked her pancreas, but she chose to attend the public hearing
despite her health struggles. The facility would have been built within
a few hundred feet of her home.</p>
<p>“To hear that they are backing out, I am so excited, my prayers have
been answered, because I’ve been praying for this for the last three
years,” Mitchell said. “I’ve been asking God, just don’t let this plant
come into our community. I don’t want this for our children.”</p>

from energy think tank Ember finds that the world is not on target to
meet 2030 added capacity goals for wind power. Global leaders agreed at
last year’s COP28 that, to be in line with the goal of limiting global
warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the world must triple renewables
capacity by the end of the decade. Ember’s report concludes that under
current plans, wind power is set to more than double in that timeframe,
“but fall short of tripling.” Ember also reiterates that China is
“overachieving,” and is on a path to triple its wind capacity from 2022
to 2030. Meanwhile, the rest of the world is underachieving.

The U.S. is the country with the biggest gap between its expected wind
installations and how much new capacity will be needed to meet its 2030
target, followed by India. And most countries don’t even have explicit
wind targets yet. “Amidst the hype of solar, wind is not getting enough
attention, even though it provides cheap electricity and complements
solar,” said Katye Altieri, Ember’s global electricity analyst. “The
path to a cleaner energy future could be shaped by prioritizing improved
policies, regulatory frameworks and financial support.”

a letter</a> to House Speaker Mike Johnson this week, urging him not to
repeal the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy tax credits. The
politicians say industry leaders and constituents have been reaching out
to express their fears that the GOP will upend the tax regime and
“undermine private investments and stop development that is already
ongoing.” The letter goes on: “A full repeal would create a worst-case
scenario where we would have spent billions of taxpayer dollars and
received next to nothing in return.” A majority of clean tech spending
made possible so far under the IRA has gone toward projects in
Republican districts. As <em><em>Bloomberg</em></em>

published in the journal <em>Nature</em>. Researchers figured this out
by drilling into some of the reef’s coral and analyzing the samples to
measure temperatures going back to 1618. They observed a marked
temperature rise starting in 1900 due to the burning of fossil fuels,
and warmth has really accelerated in the last decade, with this year’s
temperatures “head and shoulders” above any other year,

id="us-judge-again-dismisses-mexicos-lawsuit-against-most-gun-manufacturers">US
judge again dismisses Mexico’s lawsuit against most gun
manufacturers</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MEXICO CITY — A U.S. federal judge in Massachusetts again dismissed a
$10 billion Mexican government lawsuit against six U.S. gun
manufacturers on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Mexico had argued the companies knew weapons were being sold to
traffickers who smuggled them into Mexico and decided to cash in on that
market.</p>
<p>However, the judge ruled that Mexico had not provided concrete
evidence that any of the six companies’ activities in Massachusetts were
connected to any suffering caused in Mexico by guns.</p>
<p>Mexico’s Foreign Relations Department said Wednesday the ruling would
allow the lawsuit to proceed against a seventh manufacturer and a gun
wholesaler.</p>
<p>Regarding the dismissal against the others, the department said,
“Mexico is analyzing its options, among them presenting an appeal.”</p>
<p>The case has been a legal rollercoaster.</p>
<p>In early 2022, six companies — not including the seventh manufacturer
— filed to dismiss Mexico’s claims based on the broad protection
provided to gun manufacturers by a 2005 U.S. law, the Protection of
Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, or PLCAA.</p>
<p>The law shields gun manufacturers from damages “resulting from the
criminal or unlawful misuse” of a firearm. Later in 2022, the federal
judge ruled to dismiss the case on those grounds.</p>
<p>Mexico appealed that ruling, and in January the U.S. 1st Circuit
Court of Appeals in Massachusetts revived the lawsuit, saying the PLCAA
did not apply to the claims the guns caused deaths, damages and injuries
in Mexico.</p>
<p>The appeals court returned the case to the lower court, which again
ruled to dismiss the claims against six of the companies.</p>
<p>The Mexican government estimates 70% of the weapons trafficked into
Mexico come from the U.S., according to the Foreign Affairs
Ministry.</p>

‘not confident’ of peaceful power transition if Trump loses
election</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — President Joe Biden said on Wednesday he was not
confident about a peaceful transfer of power in the United States if
Republican Donald Trump loses the Nov. 5 presidential election.</p>
<p>“If Trump loses, I’m not confident at all,” Biden said in an
interview with CBS News when asked whether he thought there would be a
peaceful transfer of power after the vote.</p>
<p>“He means what he says. We don’t take him seriously. He means it. All
this stuff about if we lose there’d be a bloodbath,” Biden added.</p>
<p>During a March campaign appearance in Ohio, Trump warned of a
“bloodbath” if he fails win the election. At the time Trump was
discussing the need to protect the U.S. auto industry from overseas
competition, and Trump later said he was referring to the auto industry
when he used the term.</p>
<p>Trump has falsely claimed he won the 2020 election against Biden and
was criminally charged in Washington and Georgia with illegally trying
to overturn the results.</p>
<p>Biden dropped out of the campaign last month after fellow Democrats
called for him to step aside following a poor debate performance against
Trump that raised questions about the Democratic president’s age and
health.</p>
<p>Biden’s vice president, Kamala Harris, has since captured the
Democratic nomination and is running against Trump.</p>

Storm Debby doles out repeat deluges for weather-weary residents</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>huger, south carolina — Days of rain from Tropical Storm Debby forced
the residents of a South Carolina community to begin the task of
assessing damage left by a cyclone that was spinning over the Atlantic
Ocean and influencing thunderstorms from the East Coast to the Great
Lakes.</p>
<p>Gene Taylor waited Wednesday afternoon for a few inches of water to
drain out of his house as high tide passed at his home along French
Quarter Creek in Huger, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) northeast of
Charleston.</p>
<p>Taylor saw the potential for flooding last week and started moving
stuff out or up higher in his home. It’s a lesson learned the hard way.
Taylor estimates this is the fourth time he has had floodwater in his
home in the past nine years.</p>
<p>“To save everything, we’ve learned from the past it’s better be
prepared for the worst. And unfortunately, I think we got it,” Taylor
said.</p>
<p>A few doors down, Charles Granger was cleaning up after about 8
inches (20 centimeters) of water got into his home. He said it is an
annoyance, but one he is trying to get used to.</p>
<p>“Eight inches disrupts your whole life,” Grainger said. “You don’t
get used to it. You just grin and bear it. It’s part of living on the
creek.”</p>
<p>The National Hurricane Center warned that isolated areas could see up
to 25 inches (64 centimeters) of rain from Tropical Storm Debby.</p>
<p>For Georgia homeowners in suburban Pooler west of Savannah, the
drenching came with a dose of déjà vu. In October 2016, rain from
Hurricane Matthew overwhelmed a nearby canal and flooded several of the
same homes.</p>
<p>Located roughly 30 miles (48 kilometers) from the Atlantic Ocean,
with no creeks or rivers nearby, the inland neighborhood doesn’t seem
like a high-risk location for tropical flooding.</p>
<p>But residents say drainage problems have plagued their street for
well over a decade, despite efforts by the local government to fix
them.</p>
<p>Debby also rained on residents all the way up to the Great Lakes and
New York and New Jersey. Moisture from the tropical storm strengthened
another storm system Tuesday evening, which caused strong thunderstorms,
according to National Weather Service meteorologist Scott Kleebauer.</p>
<p>Up to 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell in parts of New Jersey
in less than four hours.</p>
<p>Emergency officials warned of potential flash flooding, flying drones
with loudspeakers in some New York City neighborhoods to tell people in
basement apartments to be ready to flee at a moment’s notice. Multiple
water rescues were reported in New York City and surrounding areas.</p>
<p>Nearly 330,000 customers remained without power in Ohio by Wednesday
afternoon following severe storms there, according to
PowerOutage.us.</p>
<p>‘Imminent failure’ of dam</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the “imminent failure” of a dam in southeast Georgia was
threatening to swamp a mobile home park and other areas downstream, the
National Weather Service said in a flash flood warning Wednesday
afternoon. The Cypress Lake Dam is in Bulloch County, about 50 miles (80
kilometers) northwest of Savannah.</p>
<p>“If the dam breaks, flash flooding will occur immediately downstream
of the dam,” the weather service said.</p>
<p>In South Carolina, Governor Henry McMaster said the state was just
entering Act 2 of a three-act play.</p>
<p>“We’ve been lucky so far. Things have not been as bad as they could
have been,” McMaster said of heavy rains that damaged over 60 homes but
did not cause significant problems to roads or water systems.</p>
<p>Act 2 is overnight into Thursday when Debby moves back onshore and
heavy rain returns, this time to the northern part of the coast and
inland. An additional 4 to 8 inches (10 to 20 centimeters) of rain could
fall, said John Quagliariello, a meteorologist with the National Weather
Service in Columbia.</p>
<p>“It may not be as catastrophic as what we were saying, but we still
think as these rain bands develop they could sit over the same area for
long periods of time, produce a lot of rainfall and a lot of flooding,”
Quagliariello said.</p>
<p>Flooding possible next week</p>
<p>The final act may come next week if enough rain falls upstream in
North Carolina to cause major flooding along rivers as it flows to the
Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>The center of Debby was over the Atlantic Ocean on Wednesday
afternoon, 55 miles (89 kilometers) east-southeast of Charleston, the
National Hurricane Center said. The tropical storm could make a second
landfall in either North Carolina or South Carolina, expected late
Wednesday or early Thursday. Debby first made landfall as a Category 1
hurricane early Monday along the Gulf Coast of Florida.</p>
<p>A state of emergency was in effect for both North Carolina and
Virginia. Maryland issued a state of preparedness declaration.</p>
<p>At least six people have died due to the storm, five of them in
traffic accidents or from fallen trees. The sixth death involved a man
in Gulfport, Florida, whose body was recovered after his anchored
sailboat partially sank.</p>

id="stranded-nasa-starliner-pilots-may-return-to-earth-on-spacex">Stranded
NASA Starliner pilots may return to Earth on SpaceX</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida — What should have been a quick trip to the
International Space Station may turn into an eight-month stay for two
NASA astronauts if they have to switch from Boeing to SpaceX for a ride
home.</p>
<p>There’s lingering uncertainty over the safety of Boeing’s new
Starliner capsule, NASA officials said Wednesday, and the space agency
is split over the risk. As a result, chances are increasing that test
pilots Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams may have to watch from the space
station as their Starliner is cut loose to return to Earth empty.</p>
<p>If that happens, NASA will leave behind two of four astronauts from
the next SpaceX taxi flight in late September, with the vacant seats set
aside for Wilmore and Williams on the return trip in February. The pair
expected to be gone just a week or two when they launched June 5 as
Starliner’s first crew.</p>
<p>NASA is bringing in additional experts to analyze the thruster
failures experienced by Starliner before it docked. At the same time,
NASA is looking more closely at SpaceX as a backup.</p>
<p>At this point, “we could take either path,” said Ken Bowersox, NASA’s
space operations mission chief.</p>
<p>During a recent meeting, “we heard from a lot of folks that had
concern, and the decision was not clear,” he said. A final decision is
expected by mid-August.</p>
<p>Boeing issued a brief statement following NASA’s news update,
repeating its position that the capsule could still safely bring the
astronauts home.</p>
<p>“We still believe in Starliner’s capability and its flight
rationale,” the company said.</p>
<p>Boeing will need to modify the capsule’s software in case Starliner
ends up returning without a crew.</p>
<p>No serious consideration was given to launching a separate SpaceX
flight just to retrieve Wilmore and Williams, according to commercial
crew program manager Steve Stich.</p>
<p>Tests on the ground have replicated the thrust problems, pointing to
seals as one culprit. But it’s still not understood how or why those
seals swell when overheated and then shrink back to the proper size,
Stich noted. All but one of the Starliner’s five failed thrusters have
since been reactivated in orbit.</p>
<p>These thrusters are essential for allowing Starliner to back away
from the space station following undocking, and for keeping the capsule
in the proper position for moving out of orbit.</p>
<p>At the same time, engineers are grappling over helium leaks in
Starliner’s propulsion system, crucial for maneuvering. The first leak
occurred before liftoff but was deemed isolated and stable. Then more
cropped up in flight.</p>
<p>NASA hired Boeing and SpaceX to ferry astronauts to and from the
space station after the shuttles retired in 2011. SpaceX flew its first
crew in 2020. Boeing stumbled on its first test flight without a crew
and then fell further behind after a repeat demo.</p>
<p>Officials repeated their desire for a backup taxi service on
Wednesday, A situation like this one could happen again, and “that’s why
we want multiple vehicles,” Bowersox said.</p>
<p>The next crew flight will be SpaceX’s 10th for NASA. On Tuesday, it
was delayed for a month until late September to allow for extra time to
figure out how best to handle Starliner’s return. Three NASA astronauts
and one Russian are assigned to the flight, and managers on Wednesday
declined to say who might be bumped.</p>

Park Fire in California</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SAN BERNARDINO, California — Firefighters battled on Wednesday the
reawakened Park Fire, a massive blaze that re-exploded in Northern
California on Monday after several days of slumber and grew by as much
as 53 square kilometers, mostly in about 12 hours.</p>
<p>The Park Fire, California’s largest so far this year and the state’s
fourth largest on record, had scorched nearly 1,676 square kilometers by
Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>Firefighters were told during their morning briefing to focus on
safety and to be mindful of extreme fire behavior, including intense and
rapidly moving flames.</p>
<p>The Park Fire was allegedly ignited by arson on July 24 outside the
Sacramento Valley city of Chico and has destroyed 640 structures and
damaged 52.</p>
<p>In Southern California, a fast-moving wildfire that swept into a
hillside community this week destroyed five homes and damaged three
others, authorities said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The flames erupted Monday afternoon and chased residents from the
neighborhood in San Bernardino, about 97 kilometers east of Los
Angeles,</p>
<p>One firefighter was treated for a minor injury but there were no
reports of injuries to residents, said Eric Sherwin, spokesperson for
the San Bernardino County Fire Department.</p>
<p>“How quickly this fire hit this community,” Sherwin said, “the fact
that we have no civilians injured is truly a miracle.”</p>
<p>The fire was reported at 2:40 p.m. Monday and stopped progressing
about three hours later after scorching 22 hectares. Containment was
holding at 75%, Sherwin said. All evacuations were lifted late Tuesday
morning.</p>
<p>Investigators were working to determine the cause of the fire, which
erupted amid very dry and hot conditions that have made swaths of
California quick to burn this summer.</p>

16.4, 15.8, 14.13, 13.16, 12.20, and 17 Beta 3 Released!</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-08, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
The PostgreSQL Global Development Group has released an update to all
supported versions of PostgreSQL, including 16.4, 15.8, 14.13, 13.16,
and 12.20, as well as the third beta release of PostgreSQL 17. This
release fixes 1 security vulnerability and over 55 bugs reported over
the last several months.

<h2>
PostgreSQL 12 EOL Notice
</h2>
<p>
PostgreSQL 12 will stop receiving fixes on November 14, 2024. If you are
running PostgreSQL 12 in a production environment, we suggest that you
make plans to upgrade to a newer, supported version of PostgreSQL.
Please see our
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/">versioning
policy</a> for more information.

<h2>
Security Issues
</h2>
<h3>
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/support/security/CVE-2024-7348/">CVE-2024-7348</a>:
PostgreSQL relation replacement during pg_dump executes arbitrary SQL
</h3>
<p>
CVSS v3.1 Base Score:
<a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H">8.8</a>
</p>
<p>
Supported, Vulnerable Versions: 12 - 16.
</p>
<p>
An attacker able to create and drop non-temporary objects could inject
SQL code that would be executed by a concurrent
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgdump.html"><code>pg_dump</code></a>
session with the privileges of the role running <code>pg_dump</code>
(which is often a superuser). The attack involves replacing a sequence
or similar object with a view or foreign table that will execute
malicious code. To prevent this, introduce a new server parameter
<code>restrict_nonsystem_relation_kind</code> that can disable expansion
of non-builtin views as well as access to foreign tables, and teach
<code>pg_dump</code> to set it when available. Note that the attack is
prevented only if both <code>pg_dump</code> and the server it is dumping
from are new enough to have this fix.
</p>
<p>
The PostgreSQL project thanks Noah Misch for reporting this problem.

may simply shutdown PostgreSQL and update its binaries.
</p>
<p>
Users who have skipped one or more update releases may need to run
additional post-update steps; please see the release notes from earlier
versions for details.
</p>
<p>
For more details, please see the
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/">release notes</a>.

</p>
<h2>
Upgrading to PostgreSQL 17 Beta 3
</h2>
<p>
To upgrade to PostgreSQL 17 Beta 3 from an earlier version of
PostgreSQL, you will need to use a strategy similar to upgrading between
major versions of PostgreSQL (e.g. <code>pg_upgrade</code> or
<code>pg_dump</code> / <code>pg_restore</code>). For more information,
please visit the documentation section on
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/static/upgrading.html">upgrading</a>.
</p>
<h2>

<h2>
Testing for Bugs &amp; Compatibility
</h2>
<p>
The stability of each PostgreSQL release greatly depends on you, the
community, to test the upcoming version with your workloads and testing
tools in order to find bugs and regressions before the general
availability of PostgreSQL 17. As this is a Beta, minor changes to
database behaviors, feature details, and APIs are still possible. Your
feedback and testing will help determine the final tweaks on the new
features, so please test in the near future. The quality of user testing
helps determine when we can make a final release.

id="macos-sequia-will-nag-you-every-week-if-you-have-screenshot-apps-and-screen-recorders-installed">macOS
Sequia will nag you every week if you have screenshot apps and screen
recorders installed</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>With macOS Sequoia this fall, using apps that need access to screen
recording permissions will become a little bit more tedious. Apple is
rolling out a change that will require you to give explicit permission
on a weekly basis to these types of apps, and every time you reboot your
Mac. If you’ve been using the macOS Sequoia beta this summer in
conjunction with a third-party screenshot or screen recording app,
you’ve likely been prompted multiple times to continue allowing that app
access to your screen. While many speculated this could be a bug, that’s
not the case. ↫ Chance Miller Everybody is making comparisons to Windows
Vista, but I don’t think that’s fair at all. Windows Vista suffered from
an avelanche of permission dialogs because the wider Windows
application, driver, and peripheral ecosystem was not at all used to the
security boundaries present in Windows NT being enforced. Vista was the
first consumer-focused version of Windows that started doing this, and
after a difficult transition period, the flood of dialogs settled down,
and for a long time now you can blame Windows for a lot of things, but
it’s definitely not throwing up more permission dialogs than, say, an
average desktop-focused Linux distribution. In other words, Vista’s UAC
dialogs were a desperately necessary evil, an adjustment period the
Windows ecosystem simply had to go through, and Windows as a whole is
better off for it today. This, however, is different. This is Apple
having such a low opinion of its users, and such a deep disregard for
basic usability and computer ownership, that it feels entirely okay with
bothering its users with weekly – or more, if you tend to reboot – nag
dialogs for applications the user has already properly given permission
to. I don’t have any real issues with a reminder or permission dialog
upon first launching a newly installed screen recording application – or
when an exisiting application gains this functionality in an update –
but nagging users weekly is just beyond insanity. More and more it feels
like macOS is becoming an operating system for toddlers – or at least,
that’s how Apple seems to view its users.</p>

<p>date: 2024-08-07, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2024-08-06-pocket-reform">
2024-08-06 Pocket Reform
</h1>
<p>
I got my <a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/mnt/pocket-reform">MNT
Pocket Reform</a> miniature laptop! I’m hoping that this will be my new
travel laptop as the Purism laptop I got
<a href="2017-12-23_New_Laptop">back in 2017</a> has a
<a href="2021-08-26_New_laptop%2C_again%E2%80%BD">broken hinge</a>. The
two halves are attached to each other using two super strong hinges. The
hinges are so strong, in fact, that one of them ripped its screws out of
the plastic. So now the screen is held up by just one super strong hinge
and don’t really want to open or close it all that often for fear of
breaking it.
</p>
<p>
Here are my initial impressions of the new MNT Pocket Reform.
</p>
<p>
It is small, but chunky. It’s definitely not flat. It also isn’t heavy,
so I’m happy. The small keyboard and the small trackball work.
</p>
<p>
I was unable to power it on for the longest time. I had two problems.
</p>
<p>
First, there’s a small standby power switch on the left hand side that
you need to turn on. The manual suggests “using a pointed object such as
a SIM card ejector.” Which I managed to find. And then what do you do?
You use the SIM card ejector like you always do: stab it into the small
hole. So I did that for a bit, wondering at the empty spaces I was a
able to reach. What was I supposed to press? It was only when I started
to really look into the small hole that I realized: there was actually
something to be moved left and right within it!
</p>
<p>
Second, the manual says that to turn it on, “hold <em>Hyper</em> +
<em>Enter</em> for more than 2 seconds.” I pressed those two keys and
the OLED display lit up. There was the menu! There it said “Power On”. I
picked it. Nothing happened. Then the OLED display showed a tiny “T” in
the upper left corner. I did this again and again, exploring the small
menu. The laptop wouldn’t power on no matter how often I selected the
menu. That’s because I didn’t press <em>Hyper</em> + <em>Enter</em> for
<em>more than 2 seconds</em>! Press those keys until the keyboard lights
up with the pink backlights.
</p>
<p>
I setup my root passwords, created my user account, ran <code>sudo apt
update</code> and <code>sudo apt upgrade</code> and looked around at
things. After a few minutes I noticed that there is no indication of the
batteries charging. That made me nervous for a while as I kept seeing
that “1%” charge in the top right corner. It’s probably charging, I
thought. Then the laptop turned off. Oh! I guess it wasn’t charging
after all. What did I miss? Now that it is powered off, I see that the
load percentage starts climbing again.
</p>
<p>
This is what it says right now:
</p>
<pre><code>🔋 3.6                8%
🔋 3.7               Off
                  -1.07A
                  7.57V
</code></pre>
<p>
Why is the second battery off? The manual doesn’t explain what On/Off on
the second line means. It’s an indication of whether the computer is on
or off! For the longest time I thought that the first battery had some
charge and the second battery was “off”. Once I rebooted, it changed to
“On”.
</p>
<p>
In any case, it seems that my problem is that when the laptop powers on
without being connected to a charger, it won’t charge if you do connect
it. Perhaps a new system image would fix it? I’m not sure. I downloaded
an image, unzipped it, wrote it to a microSD card, and maybe booted from
it, but nothing seemed to have changed. I had to provide a root password
and a first username and another password… and that’s it. Was I supposed
to run a command? I don’t know. Did the <code>apt update &amp;&amp; apt
upgrade</code> fix the problem? I don’t know.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, when the laptop suddenly lost power (see above) I waited for it
to recharge for a bit and rebooted. It looked like this had corrupted
the disk, somehow. There are plenty of recovery messages and percentages
ending with an error because something cannot be written to the
read-only file system.
</p>
<p>
The output ends with the following, in an extremely tiny font:
</p>
<pre><code>...
mount: mounting /dev/mmcblk2p2 on /root failed: Structure needs cleaning
Failed to mount /dev/mmcblk2p2 as root file system
</code></pre>
<p>
And now I am dropped in the <code>initramfs</code>. I try figure what
I’m supposed to do. I search for some keywords online but don’t
understand what I’m seeing. Finally, I try to leave with
<code>exit</code>, Ctrl+D and whatever else I can think off. I reboot.
This time there are fewer messages about the filesystem and then I’m
back at the login prompt. It fixed itself.
</p>
<p>
Phew!
</p>
<p>
I’m back.
</p>
<p>
My take-away is this: usability and user interface issues both large and
small remain a challenge in computers.

<p>
<strong>2024-08-07</strong>. Before the login prompt is shown, there is
a long and helpful introduction that flashes by. At the login prompt,
you can specify a different command to run instead of starting the
window manager. I did that, specifying <code>/usr/bin/fish</code> (I
have installed <code>fish</code> and prefer it over the default shell,
<code>bash</code>). This allows you to read the message. I guess it’s
the <code>/etc/reform-help</code> message.
</p>
<p>
Specifically, I learned about all the commands starting with
<code>reform-</code>. Nice! In the manual these tools are mentioned on
page 50.
</p>
<p>
When I run <code>sudo reform-check</code>, it tells me that “eMMC does
not contain the latest uboot” and that I can run
<code>reform-flash-uboot emmc</code> to fix it. Do I dare? The following
two messages are shown and they are not identical. That’s a bit strange.
</p>
<pre><code>W: /boot/flash.bin is not the latest uboot
W: You can update it to the latest version by running as root:
reform-flash-uboot
W: eMMC does not contain latest uboot
W: You can update it to the latest version by running as root:
reform-flash-uboot emmc
</code></pre>
<p>
I guess I’ll run the first command and then <code>reform-check</code>
again.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime I saw that I don’t have the
<code>pocket-reform-handbook</code> installed but that I do have the
<code>reform-handbook</code>. Heh. (The MNT Reform is the bigger
laptop.)
</p>
<p>
Anyway, when I run <code>reform-flash-uboot</code> without arguments, I
get an error.
</p>
<pre><code>/usr/sbin/reform-flash-uboot: 59: MMC_BOOT: parameter not set
</code></pre>
<p>
I cannot decide whether this is a typo or not. It looks like one?
</p>
<pre><code>alex@subterraneobombus ~&gt; sudo nl /usr/sbin/reform-flash-uboot|grep MMC_BOOT
    27  if [ &quot;$EMMC_BOOT&quot; = false ]; then
    49      if [ &quot;$EMMC_BOOT&quot; = true ] &amp;&amp; [ &quot;$SD_BOOT&quot; = true ]; then
    53      elif [ &quot;$MMC_BOOT&quot; = true ]; then
    60      if [ &quot;$EMMC_BOOT&quot; = true ] &amp;&amp; [ &quot;$SD_BOOT&quot; = true ]; then

<p>

Tuba requires a “login” keyring so I had to install

id="as-japan-marks-atomic-bombing-anniversaries-its-military-emerges-from-shadow-of-wwii">As
Japan marks atomic bombing anniversaries, its military emerges from
shadow of WWII</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Tokyo — Japan this week restated its aim to rid the world of atomic
weapons as it marks the 79th anniversary of the nuclear bombings of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki — even as the Japanese government seeks
assurances the United States would be willing to use its own nuclear
arsenal to protect Japan.</p>
<p>At 8:15 a.m. Tuesday — the time that the atomic bomb exploded 600
meters (1,969 feet) above Hiroshima on August 6, 1945 — people across
Japan marked a minute’s silence to remember the horrors visited on the
city.</p>
<p>“It is the mission of Japan, the only country to have suffered
nuclear war, to pass on the reality of the atomic bombings to future
generations,” Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told delegates
gathered in Hiroshima.</p>
<p>The manner of Japan’s defeat in World War II changed the country,
driving an aversion to war and military power that lasted for
generations. However, after decades of pacifism, the country is
undergoing profound changes in its attitude to military power amid
multiple regional threats, said Yee Kuang Heng, a professor of
international relations at the University of Tokyo.</p>
<p>“The DPRK’s [North Korea’s] nuclear missile programs; Chinese
military assertiveness and territorial claims in the East China Sea;
Russia’s closer military cooperation with China in the past couple of
years. These are underlying drivers that have been around for the past
couple of years,” Heng told VOA.</p>
<p>“There is Prime Minister Kishida’s oft-quoted fear that Ukraine today
could be East Asia tomorrow, especially with potential flashpoints close
to Japan, such as Taiwan.”</p>
<p>Those threats prompted Japan to last year announce a doubling of
defense spending, to 2% of gross domestic product by 2027.</p>
<p>Last week, the United States, Japan’s closest ally, announced a major
upgrade of its military command in the country. During the visit by U.S.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin,
Tokyo again sought assurances from the U.S. that it would be prepared to
use “extended deterrence” — that is, nuclear weapons — to defend
Japan.</p>
<p>“They have always had doubts about the American commitment to use all
their might to defend them. And that includes nuclear weapons, which
gives you some idea of just how somewhat paradoxical Japan’s supposed
nuclear allergy is,” said Grant Newsham, a senior fellow at the
Washington-based Center for Security Policy and a former U.S. Marines
colonel who served in Japan.</p>
<p>For decades, anger among Asian neighbors over Japan’s actions in
World War II prevented closer regional cooperation. That’s also
changing, said analyst Heng.</p>
<p>“Countries like the Philippines, they’ve recently signed very
important defense agreements with Japan, such as the Reciprocal Access
Agreement, actually the first Asian country to do so with Japan,” he
said. “South Korea, notably under President Yoon [Suk Yeol], has talked
up a more forward-looking relationship with Japan.”</p>
<p>But 79 years after the trauma of defeat — the destruction of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki — are the Japanese people ready to become a
military power once more?</p>
<p>“There’s a sea change also in the public opinion in my country as
well,” said Kunihiko Miyake of Japan’s Canon Institute for Global
Studies.</p>
<p>“We are not rabbits. We are tortoises. We are probably slow, but we
always go ahead, and one step forward at a time,” Miyake added. “Maybe
this time, two or three steps forward.”</p>
<p>China has reacted with anger to the rapid changes in Japan’s military
posture.</p>
<p>“During World War II, Japan invaded and colonized some Southeast
Asian countries, including the Philippines, and committed serious
historical crimes. Japan needs to seriously reflect on its history of
aggression and act prudently in the field of military security,” said
Lin Jian, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, during
a press conference last month.</p>
<p>At the same time, say analysts, Japan must secure itself against
multiple threats — not least from China itself.</p>

id="as-paris-olympics-wind-down-los-angeles-swings-into-planning-for-2028">As
Paris Olympics wind down, Los Angeles swings into planning for 2028</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PARIS — From the City of Love to the City of Angels, planning for the
2028 Los Angeles Olympics is well underway and organizers are paying
close attention to what’s worked, and what hasn’t, so far in Paris. </p>
<p>It will be LA’s third time hosting the Olympics — the last time was
40 years ago — and first time hosting the Paralympic Games. </p>
<p>Janet Evans remembers sitting in the stands at the Los Angeles
Memorial Coliseum during the opening ceremony for the 1984 Summer
Olympics as a 12-year-old. </p>
<p>“I remember watching those athletes march out behind their country’s
flags in their beautiful opening ceremony uniforms and thinking, ‘I want
to do that,’” Evans said. </p>
<p>That was before she went on to win four gold medals and set world
records as a U.S. Olympic swimmer. Now, as chief athlete officer for
LA2028, the organizing committee bringing the Games to LA, she is
focused on giving a voice to athletes and their concerns. </p>
<p>“Having lived in three Olympic Villages and having competed in three
Olympic Games … it’s really important to understand what the athletes
are experiencing,” Evans said. </p>
<p>Much of the focus will be on hearing from athletes about their
concerns after the Games are over. But Evans said some of the concerns
that have been floated in the last few weeks — reports of uncomfortable
beds, limited air conditioning and food shortages — won’t be an issue in
LA, which plans to house the athletes on the UCLA campus. </p>
<p>“We feed thousands of students a day. UCLA houses thousands of
students a day and so we’re tried and tested and true,” she said. “I eat
the food once a week, at least, at UCLA, which is delicious. So I can
vouch for that.” </p>
<p>As for concerns specific to Los Angeles, top of mind for many is the
gridlocked traffic on freeways and streets in the City of Dreams and
Hollywood. </p>
<p>Evans said the plan is to work around some challenges by making
deliveries for athletes late at night, work with companies to implement
a more robust work-from-home plan for employees in the Southern
California region for the duration of the Games and institute “Olympic
lanes” to ensure athletes can “get from point A to point B
quicker.” </p>
<p>The official handoff to Los Angeles will take place on Sunday evening
during the closing ceremony in Paris. Evans hopes the buildup in the
next four years and LA’s own opening ceremony will inspire a new
generation of spectators to follow their dreams. </p>
<p>“That’s what the Olympics do — they change people’s lives,” Evans
said. “I think that’s why everyone loves the Olympics. It brings people
together.”</p>

<h2 id="the-feds-are-coming-for-solar-scammers">The Feds Are Coming for
Solar Scammers</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-07, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzEzMzc5Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2NTcyMjA5N30.uVQLn5snq71P-g0rTEN_gVc15e3wiw7XfmxiyQfMPZE/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C1"/><br/><br/>
<p>
Federal regulators are joining forces on a fresh effort to go after
solar energy scams and help the public parse potentially deceptive
business practices in the industry.
</p>
<p>
Treasury Department officials said Wednesday they will soon release a
consumer advisory warning against deceptive sales practices, officials
said at a public event featuring leaders at Treasury as well as the
Federal Trade Commission and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. These
agencies are also releasing a slew of documents to help American
consumers gauge whether solar marketers are legitimate and encourage
people to report any potential fraudulent behavior in the sector to come
forward to the government for potential inquiry.
</p>
<p>
Solar energy fraud at the residential consumer level is a rare but
<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/suburban-chicago-man-scammed-solar-panel-contractor/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>profoundly
painful phenomenon</u></a> that can acutely harm low- and middle-income
households. At the public event announcing the move, officials said they
took this step after seeing a rising amount of consumer losses due to
frauds and predatory behavior in the household solar space. More than a
quarter of a billion dollars in solar-related fraud has been reported
between January 2022 and June of this year, FTC Chair Lina Khan said.
The Internal Revenue Service issued a warning in July against new
efforts by fraudsters to cite the Inflation Reduction Act
<a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-warns-of-new-scam-targeting-clean-energy-tax-credit" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>in
predatory pitches</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
As Treasury Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo said at the event, any time a
major law passes and unleashes federal dollars to support consumers, you
will “have people trying to take advantage” – but “like in most
industries, these bad actors represent a small number of solar
companies.”
</p>
<p>
CFPB Director Rohit Chopra, meanwhile, sounded a note of concern. “I’m
really worried about this,” he said, pointing to the 2007-2008 subprime
mortgage crisis and saying these behaviors pose the risk of
“undermin[ing] the growth and development of residential solar programs
in our country.”
</p>
<p>
Chopra pointed to a specific business practice regulators that can be
concerning: sales quotas and commissions. “Sometimes when those are set
in unreasonable ways, it can create the conditions where people who are
on the frontlines selling these products go too far.”

<p>When you’re shopping online, you’ll likely find yourself jumping
between multiple tabs to read reviews and research prices. It can be
cumbersome doing all that back and forth tab switching, and online
comparison is something we hear users want help with. In the next few
weeks, starting in the U.S., Chrome will introduce Tab compare, a new
feature that presents an AI-generated overview of products from across
multiple tabs, all in one place. Imagine you’re looking for a new
Bluetooth portable speaker for an upcoming trip, but the product details
and reviews are spread across different pages and websites. Soon, Chrome
will offer to generate a comparison table by showing a suggestion next
to your tabs. By bringing all the essential details — product specs,
features, price, ratings — into one tab, you’ll be able to easily
compare and make an informed decision without the endless tab switching.
↫ Parisa Tabriz Is this really what people want from their browser, or
am I just completely out of touch? I’m not at all convinced the latter
isn’t the case, but this just seems like a filler feature. Is this
really what all the AI hype is about? Is this kind of nonsense the end
game we’re killing the planet even harder for?</p>

<p>The fentanyl epidemic in the United States parallels China’s
historical opium crisis, which was exacerbated by foreign powers and led
to widespread societal damage. Understanding China’s past and its
current role in fentanyl production could offer valuable insights for

<p>date: 2024-08-07, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;I design and code things for the web. I build them for myself, for friends, and clients. In doing that I have to make assumptions about how people behave. Because websites aren’t—usually—art pieces. They’re tools, used by people. People like yourself. And let me tell you: you’re quite unpredictable. When I build things for myself, I’m guided by a series of very simple principles:&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>
Don’t waste their time
</li>
<li>
Don’t make things complicated for no reason
</li>
<li>
Don’t add pointless distractions
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The problem though, is that my way of experiencing the web is skewed by
the fact that I spend almost all my days working on this damn thing. And
so my assumptions on how people behave are sometimes incredibly wrong.
</p>
<p>
For example: the other day someone got in touch and asked if there’s a
way to support what I do
(<a href="https://ko-fi.com/manuelmoreale">there is</a>). This link is
present on literally every single page of my site, just below the end of
the content. It’s also present in every single post in my RSS feed. And
yet, some people don’t see it.
</p>
<p>
The same story is true for my
<a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/guestbook">guestbook</a>. The link to
it is right there, just below the end of this post. And yet, every time
I mention it directly in a post, a bunch of people sign it, as if it’s
the first time they see it mentioned even though there’s a link to it in
every single post on this site.
</p>
<p>
And every time something like this happens I’m left wondering if my
assumptions about what people notice on a site are just plain wrong.
Maybe there’s a reason why creators in other types of media keep
repeating the same damn thing—like and subscribe, leave a review—at
every occasion. Maybe the attention span online is so low that you need
to repeat something a thousand times before one goes through. Which is…
sad? I don’t know, part of me refuses to believe this because I have
high hopes for you all out there. I think we’re all collectively better
than this.
</p>

safety board plans to quiz officials about FAA oversight of Boeing
before a panel blew off a 737</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — A federal safety board planned on Wednesday to probe the
Federal Aviation Administration’s oversight of Boeing and how it has
changed since a door plug blew off a Boeing 737 Max in midflight. </p>
<p>The National Transportation Safety Board is holding a two-day hearing
on the blowout during an Alaska Airlines flight in January.</p>
<p>Door plugs are installed on some 737s to seal a cutout left for an
extra exit that was not required on the Alaska jet. The plug on the
Alaska plane was opened at a Boeing factory to let workers fix damaged
rivets, but bolts that help secure the panel were not replaced when the
plug was closed.</p>
<p>A Boeing official said Tuesday that the company is redesigning door
plugs so they cannot be closed until they are properly secured.
Elizabeth Lund, who was named Boeing’s senior vice president of quality
shortly after the blowout, said the company hopes to complete the fix
within about a year, and that 737s already in service will be
retrofitted.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, safety board members were scheduled to question
representatives from Boeing and key supplier Spirit AeroSystems on their
safety systems. They also plan to ask FAA officials about the agency’s
monitoring of Boeing. including “changes in oversight methods.”</p>
<p>FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker told Congress in June that the
agency’s oversight was “too hands-off” before the blowout but has since
put more inspectors inside Boeing and Spirit factories. Whitaker is not
scheduled to testify.</p>
<p>The accident on Alaska Airlines flight 1282 occurred minutes after
takeoff from Portland, Oregon, on Jan. 5. The blowout left a hole in the
plane, oxygen masks dropped and the cockpit door flew open. Miraculously
there were no major injuries, and pilots were able to return to Portland
and land the plane safely.</p>

Grueskin in Columbia Journalism Review</a>]

<blockquote>
<p>
“What’s most important is that a disruptive start-up not be placed at
the mercy of the old organization—which might see the upstart as a
competitive threat and attempt to have it shut down or cause it to
fail.”
</p>
<p>
“[…] Newsroom managers must figure out if their current staff is
equipped—intellectually, emotionally, technologically—to handle the pace
of change in the business.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Interesting reflections here on newsrooms that split in order to
incubate future-facing innovation alongside their legacy businesses. It
seems like a good idea to me, if you can afford it: a pro-innovation
culture is likely to shed the bureaucracy and processes that may be
present in an older business. (This isn’t just true for newspapers vs
“digital”, whatever digital is: it’s also true for businesses that are
set in an older version of the web.)
</p>
<p>
The trouble is, as this article notes, that these innovative newsrooms
are likely to be so successful that they end up re-merging with the main
newsroom and falling under its control. At that point the culture of
innovation tends to die, which is something anyone in the tech industry
who watched Yahoo acquire startups in the mid-2000s will recognize
clearly.
</p>
<p>
So what’s the solution? I think there isn’t one. It may be more
effective for the innovative newsrooms to be spun off completely, so
that they aren’t so much parallel sides of the same organization as new
organizations entirely, with a more complete ability to reinvent how
they work. My guess is that this would extend far beyond new modes of
content and audience engagement and extend to the experience of working
itself. After all, that’s exactly what happened in tech - an exploration
that, depending on the organization, was often positive for tech
workers. Some people in news describe tech workers as “coddled”; I’d
describe it more as “free to invent”.

“Following President Joe Biden’s exit from the 2024 election, Democratic
supporters have gained a massive influx of energy and support all over
the Web. Hours after the president made his announcement, Heidi Li
Feldman, a law professor emeritus at Georgetown University, launched an
ActBlue fundraiser comprising of Mastodon users.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It’s been pretty successful: almost half a million dollars at the time
this article was written. It’s another example of how Mastodon users are
politically engaged, more active per capita than any other social
network, and ready to contribute.
</p>
<p>
It’s also a facet of Mastodon’s wider userbase that there were some
criticisms this money was being raised for the Presidential election
than, say, local mutual aid. From my perspective, both are important:
perhaps there’s a way to learn from this in order to fund a wider mutual
aid campaign, but contributing to an election campaign to stop an
authoritarian, nationalistic second Trump administration feels
incredibly important.
</p>
<p>
Political purity tests and fractions unfortunately are a feature of
Mastodon’s communities, and will likely continue to be - but one
positive way of looking at it is that it means they care, a lot, and are
interested in ways to improve the lives of vulnerable people. That’s an
incredibly good thing that should give us all hope for the future.

<blockquote>
<p>
“Here’s a thing. It costs $1. If you buy one, the next one will cost $2.
If someone buys it, the next one will cost $4. Et cetera. The price of
the thing always goes up, leaving every buyer (except the most recent
one) with a large guaranteed profit. Of course they can’t sell the thing
to realize the profit, but that too is a benefit: If they can’t sell,
the price can’t go down.
</p>
<p>
“Man, 2019 was just amazing. That was an economic model that you could
<em>advertise</em>.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It genuinely is incredible. Matt Levine is incredulous that anyone could
think that they could avoid SEC regulation because something was
“decentralized” - but even then, BitCloud <em>wasn’t really
decentralized</em>.
</p>
<p>
In a way, I’m a little envious: it seems like one could have raised
millions and millions of dollars for some crypto venture and actually,
with complete impunity, openly spent it on something else that really
had nothing to do with a token scheme. Imagine what could have been
funded that way!
</p>
<p>
As Matt points out:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“And then you could just take the money! And be like “what, I told you I
wouldn’t spend it on developing the protocol, and I didn’t.”“
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
What a time. Anyway, I’m sure nothing like it is happening in the tech
industry right now.

<ol type="1">
<li>Tim Walz supercharges Kamala Harris’ climate cred
</h3>
<p>
Vice President Kamala Harris yesterday tapped Minnesota Governor Tim
Walz to be her running mate in the 2024 presidential election,

the climate left</a>. Of all the finalists reportedly in contention,
Walz had the most impressive clean energy and environmental
accomplishments:

Within
<a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/eenews/1060123097?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8h1s4R5Czk7JBMWZ4wowX4Nd9ceBUpNkhoJPmFvbvdVWBbj_ZW7e0UJooBWUKr298lnWjW" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">months</a>
of being sworn in as governor of Minnesota in 2019, Walz set a goal for
his state to get its electricity from 100% carbon-free sources by 2050.
By the time Walz signed actual emissions legislation into law last year,
he’d set an even more ambitious timeline — carbon-free electricity by
2040. The bill also streamlined permitting, set a minimum wage for
employees constructing large-scale utility projects, and included an
environmental justice provision to keep energy from waste incineration
plants in frontline communities from counting toward the 2040 goal.
</li>
<li>
Walz secured a $2 billion budget package that included grid
improvements, solar panels on state-owned buildings, an electric-vehicle
rebate program, heat pump grants and rebates, a green bank, and more.
</li>
<li>
He signed a transportation bill to overhaul transit hubs, expand
passenger rail service, improve infrastructure, and offer electric bike
credits.

Earlier this summer, Walz announced a

million grant</a> to reduce food-related pollution, including protecting
and restoring carbon-absorbing peatlands, improving food waste programs,
and replacing gas-powered agricultural machinery with trucks that run on
electricity or clean fuel.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
In a statement, Evergreen Action Executive Director Lena Moffitt
applauded Walz’s “masterclass in how to govern in a way that
meaningfully improves people’s lives and sets the state up for a
thriving future.” Cassidy DiPaola, the communications director at Fossil
Free Media and a spokesperson for the Make Polluters Pay campaign,
likewise acknowledged Walz’s progress on green issues, nodding to his
“evolution into a climate champion.” She added that Walz has more than
proven himself at the state level and that “his ability to connect
climate policy to the everyday concerns of Midwestern and rural voters
could prove invaluable in building broader support for climate action.”

<li>New data shows how Americans are using the IRA
</h3>
<p>
The Treasury Department today released new data that offers the most
significant insight yet into how Americans are actually using the
Inflation Reduction Act. The numbers show more than 3 million households
used the IRA’s subsidies for homeowners last year, collectively saving
more than $8 billion on things like solar panels, batteries, heat pumps,
insulation, and other clean energy technologies and efficiency upgrades.
A closer look at the data reveals the rooftop solar tax credit was
especially popular, and particularly in sun belt states (no big
surprises there perhaps). Northeastern states leapt at the energy
efficiency tax credit, which encourages Americans to make energy
efficient changes to their home, e.g. installing a heat pump or a more
efficient water heater. But “not all of the data flatters the Biden
administration’s goals,”

Emily Pontecorvo and Robinson Meyer for Heatmap</a>. “The tax credits —
especially those that reward energy-efficient home upgrades — are used
in large part by richer households who have the money and wherewithal to
pay for costly upgrades to their homes in the first place.” Read their

a new kind of car paint</a> that it claims can reflect the sun’s
near-infrared rays and redirect the energy back into the atmosphere,

on a Nissan NV100 service vehicle as it drives around on the scorching
tarmac at Tokyo International Air Terminal. Early results have been
“impressive,” the company said in
<a href="https://europe.nissannews.com/en-GB/releases/nissan-trialing-cool-paint-technology?&utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8h1s4R5Czk7JBMWZ4wowX4Nd9ceBUpNkhoJPmFvbvdVWBbj_ZW7e0UJooBWUKr298lnWjW" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a

temperatures by about 10 degrees Fahrenheit, and cutting exterior
surface temperatures by about 21 degrees. “A cooler cabin is not only
more pleasant to enter, but also requires less air-conditioning run-time
to cool the cabin to a comfortable temperature,” Nissan said. “This
helps reduce load to the engine, or in the case of an electric vehicle,
draw on the battery. In both powertrains, an improvement in efficiency
is expected, as well as occupant comfort.”

Storm Debby expected to make landfall in South Carolina again</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>white house — Tropical Storm Debby is expected to make landfall for a
second time in South Carolina late Wednesday or early Thursday, having
taken the lives of six people earlier in the week.  </p>
<p>The storm hit the southeast United States on Monday, initially making
landfall in Florida as a Category 1 Hurricane. It has since moved into
the western Atlantic but continues to cause concern as it is predicted
to regain some strength before hitting South Carolina again. </p>
<p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis issued an executive order on August 2,
prior to the storm making landfall, and declared a state of emergency in
61 counties. The order gave state officials the ability to distribute
resources to areas that were expected to be impacted by the storm. </p>
<p>White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre outlined the federal
government’s response to the story at a press briefing Tuesday. </p>
<p>“The Biden-Harris administration has been in close touch with
officials from affected states and FEMA has deployed staff to the region
to support as needed,” she said. </p>
<p>Federal support such as FEMA’s Urban Search and Rescue Teams, the
U.S. Coast Guard, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and more have been
deployed and will provide support to the impacted areas as needed. </p>
<p>Jean-Pierre continued, “The president has approved emergency
declaration requests from the governors of Florida, South Carolina and
Georgia, which will unlock additional federal resources.”   </p>
<p>The White House is also recommending that those who remain in
Tropical Storm Debby’s path to stay alert and visit ready.gov for safety
tips. </p>
<p>A series of disasters </p>
<p>Tropical Storm Debby comes less than a month after reports of power
outages that affected millions in Texas, resulting in seven reported
deaths due to heat exposure. The power issues were part of the aftermath
of Hurricane Beryl, which first hit the state on July 8. The storm also
comes just weeks after Illinois saw 25 tornadoes hit the Chicago area in
the span of two days. </p>
<p>As the summer’s climate disasters continue, affected areas will seek
the support of the federal government and Biden administration to help
offset damages and minimize the risk of casualties. The administration
has made climate change a key issue since President Joe Biden took
office in 2021. </p>
<p>“Climate-fueled disasters are impacting communities nationwide — and
it’s costing the U.S. billions every year,” White House spokesperson
Jeremy M. Edwards told VOA on Wednesday. </p>
<p>“That’s why President Biden is leading the most ambitious climate
agenda in history, including securing the Inflation Reduction Act, the
largest-ever climate investment, which provides billions to help
communities build resilience to these increasingly frequent and extreme
weather events.”   </p>
<p>The Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law in 2022 and aims to
combat air pollution and climate change. The Biden administration faced
climate-based criticism in 2023 after it approved the Willow Project,
which allows for massive oil drilling in Alaska.   </p>
<p>Some $92.9 billion in damages from natural disasters were recorded in
2023, reaching a record high of 28 such events that cost more than $1
billion. As of July, the National Centers for Environmental Information
confirmed 15 disasters that have cost the U.S. more than $1 billion so
far in 2024.</p>

<em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Novo Nordisk, the company behind
popular weight-loss and diabetes drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy, didn’t
sell as many of those medications as expected in the second quarter. A
lot has to do with supply issues and competition. Then, a Nobel Prize
winner has been chosen as Bangladesh’s interim leader. And Spain’s
tourism industry is hitting new records, but not everyone is thrilled
with the surge in visitors.

a cryptographically secure bootloader for RISC-V in Rust</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>It seems to be bootloader season, because we’ve got another one –
this time, a research project with very limited application for most
people. SentinelBoot is a cryptographically secure bootloader aimed at
enhancing boot flow safety of RISC-V through memory-safe principles,
predominantly leveraging the Rust programming language with its
ownership, borrowing, and lifetime constraints. Additionally,
SentinelBoot employs public-key cryptography to verify the integrity of
a booted kernel (digital signature), by the use of the RISC-V Vector
Cryptography extension, establishing secure boot functionality.
SentinelBoot achieves these objectives with a 20.1% hashing overhead
(approximately 0.27s additional runtime) when compared to an example
U-Boot binary (mainline at time of development), and produces a
resulting binary one-tenth the size of an example U-Boot binary with
half the memory footprint. ↫ Lawrence Hunter SentinelBoot is a project
undertaken at the University of Manchester, and its goal is probably
clear from the description: to develop a more secure bootloader for RISC
V devices. An additional element is that they looked specifically at
devices that receive updates over-the-air, like smartphones. In
addition, scenarios where an attacker has physical access to the device
in question were not considered, for obvious reasons – in such cases,
the attacker can just replace the bootloader altogether anyway, and no
amount of fancy Rust code is going to save you there. The details of the
implementation as described in the article are definitely a little bit
over my head, but the gist seems to be that the project’s been able to
achieve a much more secure boot process without giving up much in
performance. This being a research project with an intentionally limited
scope does mean it’s most just something that’ll immediately benefit all
of us, but it’s these kinds of projects that can really push the state
of the art and try out the viability of new ideas.</p>

<h2 id="explainer-tim-walzs-long-track-record-in-china">Explainer: Tim
Walz’s long track record in China</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Taipei, Taiwan  — From teaching at a high school in China to his
experience serving on a key congressional committee that focuses on
relations between Beijing and Washington, Democratic vice-presidential
nominee Tim Walz has a decades-long connection with China dating back to
the pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989.</p>
<p>As an educator, Walz taught American History, culture, and English to
Chinese students at the Foshan No.1 High School in the southern Chinese
province of Guangdong in 1989, the year that saw hundreds of thousands
of Chinese students protesting against the ruling Chinese Communist
Party in Tiananmen Square.</p>
<p>“China was coming, and that’s the reason that I went,” Walz said in a
2007 interview with The Hill, a Washington D.C.-based news website.
During his one-year teaching stint in China, Walz was nicknamed “Fields
of China” by his students due to his kindness.</p>
<p>His time in China had an impact on his perspectives of Chinese
people’s lives under the ruling Communist Party.</p>
<p>“If they had the proper leadership, there are no limits on what they
could accomplish,” he said in an interview with the Star Herald in 1990,
describing teaching in China as “one of the best things” he has ever
done.</p>
<p>His interest in China didn’t stop there. Upon returning to the United
States, Walz and his wife set up a company named “Educational Travel
Adventures” to coordinate summer trips to China for American high school
students.</p>
<p>Five years after the Tiananmen Square protests and the Chinese
government’s violent crackdown, Walz returned to China with his wife for
their honeymoon and they brought along two American high school tour
groups. Walz continued running the summer exchange program to China for
American students with his wife until 2003.</p>
<p>Advocating human rights in China</p>
<p>After becoming a member of Congress in 2007, Walz continued to focus
on issues related to China. During his time in Congress, Walz served on
the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, which focuses
exclusively on human rights issues in the country.</p>
<p>Walz quickly established himself as a vocal critic of the Chinese
government, holding regular meetings with high-profile activists from
China and Hong Kong, including prominent Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong
and Tibet’s spiritual leader Dalai Lama.</p>
<p>In an interview with VOA in 2014, Walz recounted his impression of
witnessing the student-led protest in Tiananmen Square unfold. “I
remembered waking up and seeing the news on June Fourth that the
unthinkable had happened,” he said.</p>
<p>While most Americans at the time decided to leave China due to
security concerns following the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989, Walz
said he felt it was “more important than ever to go” to China because he
wanted to ensure that “the story was told” and let the Chinese people
know that the outside world was with them.</p>
<p>In addition to engaging with activists from China and Hong Kong, Walz
also co-sponsored several resolutions on key human rights issues in
China, including demanding the release of Chinese Nobel laureate Liu
Xiaobo and Chinese activist Huang Qi, as well as co-signing the Hong
Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act in 2017.</p>
<p>In one of his congressional remarks in 2016, Walz highlighted the
importance of having “constructive dialogues” with Beijing to ensure
“the preservation of traditional Tibetan culture and Tibet’s fragile
ecology.”</p>
<p>“The U.S. was founded on the ideas of universal freedom, and I
believe that we must continue to urge the Chinese government to provide
less regulated religious freedom to the Tibetans,” he said at the
time.</p>
<p>Foreign policy boost</p>
<p>In addition to being a vocal critique of China’s human rights record,
Walz also expressed concerns about China’s attempt to expand its
presence in the South China Sea in 2016, citing Beijing’s efforts to
build artificial islands in the disputed water as the reason to oppose
Washington’s attempt to reduce military spending.</p>
<p>Despite his strong stance on China’s human rights record and military
posture, Walz continued to stress the importance of maintaining
cooperation with China. “I don’t fall into the category that China
necessarily needs to be an adversarial relationship,” he said in a video
interview with Agri-Pulse Communications.</p>
<p>“I think we need to stand firm on what they are doing in the South
China Sea, but there [are] many areas of cooperation that we can work
on,” Walz added.</p>
<p>Some analysts say Walz’s deep connections to China and track record
in U.S.-China diplomacy could potentially help the Democratic
presidential pair make more informed decisions on foreign policy,
especially on issues related to China.</p>
<p>“I think [his emergence as Democratic vice-presidential nominee] is
going to put a lot of people who care a lot about American foreign
policy in this part of the world at ease, knowing that there is someone
on the ticket who is informed, has spent time in the region, and is not
starting from square one when it comes to learning about American
foreign policy in East Asia,” said Lev Nachman, a political scientist at
National Taiwan University.</p>
<p>He said since Walz has expressed many humanistic views of the Chinese
people, Tibetan people, and Hong Kongers, the Minnesota governor could
add more nuance to the policy debate related to China in the United
States.</p>
<p>“He may be able to articulate the need to push back against China’s
authoritarianism and human rights violations in different parts of the
world in a way that doesn’t vilify Chinese citizens or doesn’t lean
antagonistically in this overtly scare tactic rhetoric that I think a
lot of U.S.-China discourse has turned into in the U.S.,” Nachman told
VOA by phone.</p>

<h2 id="the-first-ira-tax-credit-data-is-in">The First IRA Tax Credit
Data Is In</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-07, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzEyNzgwNi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0MzMyOTEyMn0.3v8nbVscS_4KIAg5wwW9axh9jsaQL49QbQ0Jx9cAVbg/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C1"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
More than 3 million American households used the Inflation Reduction
Act’s subsidies for homeowners last year, collectively saving more than
$8 billion on things like solar panels, batteries, heat pumps,
insulation, and other clean energy technologies and efficiency upgrades.
</p>
<p>
That’s according to new data released Wednesday by the Treasury
Department, which provided the most significant insight yet into how
Americans are actually using the IRA. Polling had so far suggested that
Americans were curious —
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/biden-climate-legacy" target="_self"><u>if
confused</u></a> — about the law’s benefits, but until today, there was
no official data available to back up those impressions.
</p>
<p>
The data sheds light on usage of two tax credits in particular, one of
which encourages Americans to make energy efficient changes to their
home, e.g. installing a heat pump or a more efficient water heater, the
other of which goes toward installing rooftop solar or another form of
zero-carbon energy generation.
</p>
<p>
Of the more than 137 million tax returns the government had processed by
late May, some 3.4 million of them — or approximately 2.5% — took
advantage of at least one of these two subsidies. That’s about 30% more
people than used similar, though less generous tax credits in 2021.
</p>
<p>
“The Biden Harris administration’s top economic priority is making life
more affordable for Americans,” Wally Adeyemo, the deputy secretary of
the Treasury, said during a briefing call this week. “The Inflation
Reduction Act is doing exactly that.”
</p>
<p>
Not all of the data flatters the Biden administration’s goals, however.
The tax credits — especially those that reward energy-efficient home
upgrades — are used in large part by richer households who have the
money and wherewithal to pay for costly upgrades to their homes in the
first place. Here are four takeaways from this first crucial look into
how the law is going.
</p>
<h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Americans are using the tax credits more than projected — but that’s
mostly because of the popularity of rooftop solar.
</h3>
<p>
More than 1.2 million Americans used the residential clean energy tax
credit, which covers some of the cost of installing clean
electricity-generating technology. A comfortable majority of those
claiming the credit — some 750,000 — purchased rooftop solar panels.
</p>
<p>
When the IRA was first proposed in 2022, the Joint Committee on Taxation
<a href="https://www.jct.gov/publications/2022/jcx-22-22/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>projected</u></a>
the government would spend $2 billion on the residential clean energy
credit in 2023. In fact, it has spent more than triple that — a total of
$6.3 billion and counting. The Biden administration expects more claims
to appear as tax returns keep rolling in through November.

</iframe>
</center>
<h3>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Uptake is more about geography and economics than politics.
</h3>
<p>
The top three states claiming the efficiency tax credit were Maine, New
Hampshire, and Vermont. These states have some of the strongest state
energy efficiency policies in the country, according to the American
Council for an Energy Efficient Economy’s
<a href="https://www.aceee.org/press-release/2022/12/scorecard-leading-states-cutting-costs-residents-energy-efficiency-more" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>state
scorecard</u></a>, giving homeowners the chance to stack multiple
subsidies to help them pay for upgrades. Northeast states also have some
of the
<a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/guides/utilities/electricity-rates-by-state/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>most
expensive electricity in the country</u></a>, and
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/heating-oil/use-of-heating-oil.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>many
homes there still use fuel oil heating systems</u></a>, the priciest
option for home heating.

</iframe>
</center>
<p>
But another set of states dominated the clean energy tax credits, which
cover solar panels. The top three states to use that subsidy were
Nevada, Florida, and Arizona — some of the sunniest places in the
country, which have
<a href="https://www.seia.org/sites/default/files/2023-03/SEIA_Top10_Solar_States_2022-YIR%20copy.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>long

</iframe>
</center>
<p>
Ironically, West Virginia — home of Senator Joe Manchin, one of the
IRA’s architects — was dead last of states that used at least one of the
credits.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>The federal government helped pay for nearly 600,000 new natural
gas-burning heating systems.
</h3>
<p>
The Inflation Reduction Act revived an earlier, expired tax credit that
helped Americans pay for energy efficient home upgrades and appliances.
But while the new program increased the amount households could get back
for installing electric heat pumps from $500 to $2,000, it also kept in
place subsidies for “qualified” natural gas heaters. The government
helped pay for taxpayers to install nearly 600,000 new natural
gas-burning space heating and water heating systems in 2023. Those
appliances have a useful life of at least 15 to 20 years.
</p>
<center>
<iframe aria-label="Column Chart" data-external="1" frameborder="0" height="525" id="datawrapper-chart-7EZ8w" scrolling="no" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/7EZ8w/2/" style="border: none;" title="Lots of Americans saved on heat pumps ... but more saved on new natural gas appliances" width="680">
</iframe>
</center>
<p>
The level of uptake is not necessarily surprising — the upfront cost of
a natural gas boiler or furnace is much lower than that of a heat pump
system. In many states, natural gas heating systems will
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/heat-pumps-national-renewable-energ-lab" target="_self"><u>also
result in lower energy bills</u></a> than a heat pump will.
</p>
<p>
Heat pump water heaters are more competitive on cost than space heaters,
so there the mismatch may be more of a marketing issue. With the federal
tax credit, the upfront cost can be nearly on par with natural gas water
heaters, and they actually
<a href="https://www.energystar.gov/products/ask-the-experts/heat-pump-water-heater-right-your-home" target="_blank"><u>beat
their natural gas-powered brethren</u></a> when it comes to energy bill
savings.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Wealthier Americans were more likely to take advantage of the IRA.
</h3>
<p>
On a call with reporters on Tuesday, Adeyemo pointed out that nearly
half the families who claimed one or both of the residential clean
energy credits had incomes lower than $100,000 in 2023.
</p>
<p>
That’s true. But roughly 75% of filers had incomes lower than $100,000
in 2023. When you look at how many people claimed each tax credit as a
percentage of the total number of filers <em><em>in that
bracket</em></em>, it’s clear that both tax credits are more frequently
adopted by higher income Americans.
</p>
<p>
There’s also an interesting split between the two credits. Wealthier
households were especially enthusiastic about efficiency upgrades —
roughly one in 25 of those bringing in more than $100,000 claimed the
energy efficiency tax credit.
</p>
<center>
<iframe aria-label="Grouped Bars" data-external="1" frameborder="0" height="299" id="datawrapper-chart-SVVoP" scrolling="no" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/SVVoP/1/" style="border: none;" title="Wealthier households were more likely to use the tax credits ... especially on efficiency upgrades" width="680">
</iframe>
</center>
<p>
Adeyemo also pointed out that, since people invest in their home’s
heating system rather rarely, the administration expects uptake to
increase over time.
</p>
<p>
“Our expectation is that as more American families become more familiar
with these tax credits, and they look for ways to save money, they’ll
continue to see this as a means to do so,” he said. “Given what we’ve
heard from some of the companies selling these products, our expectation
is that this will continue.”

<h2 id="drones-warn-new-yorkers-about-storm-dangers">Drones warn New
Yorkers about storm dangers</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Gone is the bullhorn. Instead, New York City emergency
management officials have turned high-tech, using drones to warn
residents about potential threatening weather.</p>
<p>With a buzzing sound in the background, a drone equipped with a
loudspeaker flies over homes warning people who live in basement or
ground-floor apartments about impending heavy rains.</p>
<p>“Be prepared to leave your location,” said the voice from the sky in
footage released Tuesday by the city’s emergency management agency. “If
flooding occurs, do not hesitate.”</p>
<p>About five teams with multiple drones each were deployed to specific
neighborhoods prone to flooding. Zach Iscol, the city’s emergency
management commissioner, said the messages were being relayed in
multiple languages. They were expected to continue until the weather
impacted the drone flights.</p>
<p>Flash floods have been deadly for New Yorkers living in basement
apartments, which can quickly fill up in a deluge. Eleven people drowned
in such homes in 2011 amid rain from the remnants of Hurricane Ida.</p>
<p>The drones are in addition to other forms of emergency messaging,
including social media, text alerts and a system that reaches more than
2,000 community-based organizations throughout the city that serve
senior citizens, people with disabilities and other groups.</p>
<p>“You know, we live in a bubble, and we have to meet people where they
are in notifications so they can be prepared,” New York City Mayor Eric
Adams said at a press briefing on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Adams is a self-described “tech geek” whose administration has tapped
drone technology to monitor large gatherings as well as to search for
sharks on beaches. Under his watch, the city’s police department also
briefly toyed with using a robot to patrol the Times Square subway
station, and it has sometimes deployed a robotic dog to dangerous
scenes, including the Manhattan parking garage that collapsed in
2023.</p>

id="families-of-americans-detained-in-china-seek-action-after-us-russia-swap">Families
of Americans detained in China seek action after US-Russia swap</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Harrison Li, the son of Kai Li, a Chinese American
wrongfully detained in China since 2016, felt a mix of emotions after
witnessing the recent return of Americans wrongfully imprisoned in
Russia.</p>
<p>Last Thursday, President Joe Biden and the families of those released
celebrated the return of three Americans and a permanent resident,
including two journalists and an activist, as part of the largest
prisoner exchange since the Soviet era.</p>
<p>Kai Li is one of at least three Americans wrongfully detained in
China. He was arrested in Shanghai in September 2016 and in 2018 was
sentenced to 10 years in prison for espionage, which he has consistently
denied. The other two wrongfully detained by China are Texas businessman
Mark Swidan and California pastor David Lin.</p>
<p>The U.S. State Department does not disclose the number of wrongful
detention cases due to privacy concerns and the sensitivity of efforts
to secure the release of wrongfully detained U.S. nationals.</p>
<p>“U.S. citizens are not required to register their travel to a foreign
country with us, and we do not maintain comprehensive lists of U.S.
citizens residing overseas,” a State Department spokesperson told VOA in
an email when asked about the total number of wrongfully detained
Americans in China.</p>
<p>For the past eight years, Harrison Li has urged two consecutive U.S.
administrations to secure his father’s release.</p>
<p>“Our family is extremely pleased to see the return of Paul Whelan,
Alsu Kurmasheva, and Evan Gershkovich back to the U.S. and wish them and
their families the best in the long road to recovery,” Li told VOA in a
written statement.</p>
<p>“Once again, President Biden has shown his willingness to make
difficult decisions that prioritize the safety of Americans unjustly
detained abroad … except in China.”</p>
<p>Li expressed frustration over the lack of attention given to his
father’s case by the U.S. administration.</p>
<p>“All we can do is once again remind the President that my dad has
suffered unjustly for almost 8 years now, and that he must act to
‘finish the job’ before it’s too late,” Li wrote.</p>
<p>Several members of Congress are also urging the Biden administration
to secure the release of Americans wrongfully detained in China.</p>
<p>Congressman Michael McCaul, chairman of the Committee on Foreign
Affairs, told VOA that Americans wrongfully detained in China and
elsewhere deserve to be home with their families.</p>
<p>“One American wrongfully detained abroad is too many,” he said. “As
wrongfully detained Americans returned home this week from Russia, we
cannot forget about those held around the world, including those in
China — particularly Mark Swidan, Kai Li, and David Lin.”</p>
<p>Families call for urgent action</p>
<p>Katherine Swidan, the mother of Mark Swidan, revealed that her son
has been on a hunger strike for many days. He has been detained in China
since 2012 on narcotics trafficking charges, which he denies.</p>
<p>“Mark’s been on a hunger strike for 115 days. He’s lost a lot of
weight, and he’s been sick. His leg was swollen, and they did a very
sparse medical exam,” Swidan told VOA.</p>
<p>According to Swidan, U.S. Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns visited
her son in the past.</p>
<p>“When he went to see Mark, he told Mark the next time I come to see
you, hopefully it will be to bring you home,” Swidan said.</p>
<p>That message left both her and Mark full of hope, but Mark continues
to experience disappointment and anger and has had suicidal
tendencies.</p>
<p>“When I talked to him, he said he was in a room with, like, nine
other people, seven to nine people. He is doing gardening, planting
stuff. But he is furious because he doesn’t understand why they are not
pushing for him to come home,” she said.</p>
<p>Renewed focus</p>
<p>Peter Humphrey, a former British reporter in China, was arrested in
2013 and sentenced to two and a half years in prison for illegally
obtaining citizen information. He was released early in June 2015 due to
health reasons and was deported after medical treatment in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Now a nonresident researcher at Harvard University’s Fairbank Center
for China Studies, Humphrey uses his experience to assist foreign
citizens detained in China and help them contact government officials.
He says he has supported some American detainees whose cases remained
unreported for fear that publicity would make their situations
worse.</p>
<p>Humphrey believes that after last week’s U.S.-Russia prisoner
exchange, the United States should refocus its attention on Americans
improperly detained in China and elsewhere.</p>
<p>“These people are arbitrarily detained, and the American government
should wake up and understand the fact that it is their duty of care to
protect American citizens in China who become victims of this false and
cruel process of Chinese justice,” he told VOA. “Some talks are
happening but not like significant progress.”</p>
<p>Travel advisory</p>
<p>A U.S. State Department spokesperson said the department has no
higher priority than the safety and security of U.S. citizens
overseas.</p>
<p>“Secretary Blinken, Ambassador Burns, and other senior U.S.
government officials continue to advocate for the immediate and
unconditional release of wrongfully detained U.S. citizens in meetings
with PRC officials,” the spokesperson told VOA. “The U.S. mission in
China will continue to offer consular services to every U.S. citizen
detained in the PRC.”</p>
<p>The Department of State travel advisory is at Level 3 for mainland
China, recommending that U.S. citizens reconsider travel due to
arbitrary enforcement of local laws, exit bans and the risk of wrongful
detentions.</p>
<p>“The sad facts are that the PRC has blocked U.S. citizens, including
college students, minors, businesspeople and tourists from leaving the
country. U.S. citizens have been wrongfully detained by the PRC, and the
PRC often arbitrarily enforces its own laws,” the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>Family appeals</p>
<p>Nelson and Cynthia Wells, whose son Nelson Wells Jr. was detained in
China in 2014 and sentenced to life imprisonment for “drug smuggling”
(later commuted to 22 years), have written letters to three consecutive
U.S. presidents about their son’s imprisonment but have never received a
response.</p>
<p>“We also don’t know if they received the letters,” they said. “I
really believe that if we’re high-profile people, well, if we’re famous,
or we’re a top athlete, or we have a lot of money, or we have any type
of political connections, then we might get some recognition,” Nelson
Wells told VOA.</p>
<p>The case has drawn the attention of U.S. Senators John Kennedy and
Bill Cassidy, who are advocating for Nelson Wells Jr. to be recognized
as “wrongfully detained.” Last October, Nelson and Cynthia Wells spoke
with House Speaker Mike Johnson, who assured them he continues to
address the issue.</p>

<h2>
PostgreSQL credcheck extension
</h2>
<p>
The credcheck PostgreSQL extension provides few general credential
checks, which will be evaluated during the user creation, during the
password change and user renaming. By using this extension, we can
define a set of rules:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
allow a specific set of credentials
</li>
<li>
reject a certain type of credentials
</li>
<li>
deny password that can be easily cracked
</li>
<li>
enforce use of an expiration date with a minimum of day for a password
</li>
<li>
define a password reuse policy
</li>
<li>
define the number of authentication failure allowed before a user is
banned
</li>
<li>
define a delay on authentication failures
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Release 2.8 has been published, it adds the compatibility with
PostgreSQL 17 and shows current credcheck settings in error messageis.
</p>
<p>
Upgrade require a PostgreSQL restart to reload the credcheck library.
