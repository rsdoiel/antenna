## The economics of a Harris-Walz ticket

date: 2024-08-07, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>We now know who the Veep wants as Veep: Vice President Kamala Harris announced on Tuesday that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will be her running mate in this year’s presidential election. But what does he bring to the table economically? We&#8217;ll dig in. Plus, total household debt in the U.S. is creeping up, and a new nonprofit aims to measure whether companies’ carbon removal plans actually work.</p>

## Californians say they were fired for leaving their jobs in sweltering heat. Is the state on their side?

date: 2024-08-07, from: San Jose Mercury News

While California has rules to protect farmworkers from excessive heat, inspections and citations are significantly down. A bill before the Legislature would make it easier to file workers’ compensation claims for heat illnesses.

## How Tim Walz became beloved by young voters with a message that the GOP is ‘weird’

date: 2024-08-07, from: San Jose Mercury News

Now the party is turning the page with a new generation of candidates trying to appeal not just to Americans' fears about what a second Trump presidency would mean, but to plainly label the policies and actions of the Republican party as abnormal.

## When split newsrooms work, and when they falter

date: 2024-08-07, from: Ben Werdmuller's blog

<p>[<a href="https://www.cjr.org/business_of_news/separate-unequal-glorious-grueskin-christensen-harvard-business-wall-street-wsj.php">Bill Grueskin in Columbia Journalism Review</a>]</p><blockquote><p>"What’s most important is that a disruptive start-up not be placed at the mercy of the old organization—which might see the upstart as a competitive threat and attempt to have it shut down or cause it to fail."</p><p>"[...] Newsroom managers must figure out if their current staff is equipped—intellectually, emotionally, technologically—to handle the pace of change in the business."</p></blockquote><p>Interesting reflections here on newsrooms that split in order to incubate future-facing innovation alongside their legacy businesses. It seems like a good idea to me, if you can afford it: a pro-innovation culture is likely to shed the bureaucracy and processes that may be present in an older business. (This isn't just true for newspapers vs "digital", whatever digital is: it's also true for businesses that are set in an older version of the web.)</p><p>The trouble is, as this article notes, that these innovative newsrooms are likely to be so successful that they end up re-merging with the main newsroom and falling under its control. At that point the culture of innovation tends to die, which is something anyone in the tech industry who watched Yahoo acquire startups in the mid-2000s will recognize clearly.</p><p>So what's the solution? I think there isn't one. It may be more effective for the innovative newsrooms to be spun off completely, so that they aren't so much parallel sides of the same organization as new organizations entirely, with a more complete ability to reinvent how they work. My guess is that this would extend far beyond new modes of content and audience engagement and extend to the experience of working itself. After all, that's exactly what happened in tech - an exploration that, depending on the organization, was often positive for tech workers. Some people in news describe tech workers as "coddled"; I'd describe it more as "free to invent".</p>

## "Mastodon for Harris" is a Success Story for Fediverse Activism

date: 2024-08-07, from: Ben Werdmuller's blog

<p>[<a href="https://wedistribute.org/2024/08/mastodon-for-harris/">Sean Tilley at We Distribute</a>]</p><blockquote><p>"Following President Joe Biden’s exit from the 2024 election, Democratic supporters have gained a massive influx of energy and support all over the Web. Hours after the president made his announcement, Heidi Li Feldman, a law professor emeritus at Georgetown University, launched an ActBlue fundraiser comprising of Mastodon users."</p></blockquote><p>It's been pretty successful: almost half a million dollars at the time this article was written. It's another example of how Mastodon users are politically engaged, more active per capita than any other social network, and ready to contribute.</p><p>It's also a facet of Mastodon's wider userbase that there were some criticisms this money was being raised for the Presidential election than, say, local mutual aid. From my perspective, both are important: perhaps there's a way to learn from this in order to fund a wider mutual aid campaign, but contributing to an election campaign to stop an authoritarian, nationalistic second Trump administration feels incredibly important.</p><p>Political purity tests and fractions unfortunately are a feature of Mastodon's communities, and will likely continue to be - but one positive way of looking at it is that it means they care, a lot, and are interested in ways to improve the lives of vulnerable people. That's an incredibly good thing that should give us all hope for the future.</p><p><a href="https://werd.io/tag/Fediverse" class="p-category" rel="tag">#Fediverse</a></p>            <p>[<a href="https://wedistribute.org/2024/08/mastodon-for-harris/">Link</a>]</p>

## BitClout Wasn’t So Decentralized

If you buy one, the next one will cost $2. If someone buys it, the next one will cost $4. Et cetera. The price of the thing always goes up, leaving every buyer (except the most recent one) with a large guaranteed profit. Of course they can’t sell the thing to realize the profit, but that too is a benefit: If they can’t sell, the price can’t go down.</p><p>"Man, 2019 was just amazing. That was an economic model that you could <em>advertise</em>."</p></blockquote><p>It genuinely is incredible. Matt Levine is incredulous that anyone could think that they could avoid SEC regulation because something was "decentralized" - but even then, BitCloud <em>wasn't really decentralized</em>. </p><p>In a way, I'm a little envious: it seems like one could have raised millions and millions of dollars for some crypto venture and actually, with complete impunity, openly spent it on something else that really had nothing to do with a token scheme. Imagine what could have been funded that way!</p><p>As Matt points out:</p><blockquote><p>"And then you could just take the money!

Of all the finalists reportedly in contention, Walz had the most impressive clean energy and environmental accomplishments:</p><ul><li>Within <a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/eenews/1060123097?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8h1s4R5Czk7JBMWZ4wowX4Nd9ceBUpNkhoJPmFvbvdVWBbj_ZW7e0UJooBWUKr298lnWjW" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">months</a> of being sworn in as governor of Minnesota in 2019, Walz set a goal for his state to get its electricity from 100% carbon-free sources by 2050. By the time Walz signed actual emissions legislation into law last year, he’d set an even more ambitious timeline — carbon-free electricity by 2040. The bill also streamlined permitting, set a minimum wage for employees constructing large-scale utility projects, and included an environmental justice provision to keep energy from waste incineration plants in frontline communities from counting toward the 2040 goal.</li><li>Walz secured a $2 billion budget package that included grid improvements, solar panels on state-owned buildings, an electric-vehicle rebate program, heat pump grants and rebates, a green bank, and more.</li><li>He signed a transportation bill to overhaul transit hubs, expand passenger rail service, improve infrastructure, and offer electric bike credits.</li><li>Earlier this summer, Walz announced a <a href="https://mn.gov/governor/newsroom/press-releases/?id=1055-638440&utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8h1s4R5Czk7JBMWZ4wowX4Nd9ceBUpNkhoJPmFvbvdVWBbj_ZW7e0UJooBWUKr298lnWjW" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$200 million grant</a> to reduce food-related pollution, including protecting and restoring carbon-absorbing peatlands, improving food waste programs, and replacing gas-powered agricultural machinery with trucks that run on electricity or clean fuel.</li></ul><p>In a statement, Evergreen Action Executive Director Lena Moffitt applauded Walz’s “masterclass in how to govern in a way that meaningfully improves people’s lives and sets the state up for a thriving future.” Cassidy DiPaola, the communications director at Fossil Free Media and a spokesperson for the Make Polluters Pay campaign, likewise acknowledged Walz’s progress on green issues, nodding to his “evolution into a climate champion.” She added that Walz has more than proven himself at the state level and that “his ability to connect climate policy to the everyday concerns of Midwestern and rural voters could prove invaluable in building broader support for climate action.”</p><h3>2. New data shows how Americans are using the IRA</h3><p>The Treasury Department today released new data that offers the most significant insight yet into how Americans are actually using the Inflation Reduction Act. The numbers show more than 3 million households used the IRA’s subsidies for homeowners last year, collectively saving more than $8 billion on things like solar panels, batteries, heat pumps, insulation, and other clean energy technologies and efficiency upgrades. A closer look at the data reveals the rooftop solar tax credit was especially popular, and particularly in sun belt states (no big surprises there perhaps).

It’s been trialing the paint on a Nissan NV100 service vehicle as it drives around on the scorching tarmac at Tokyo International Air Terminal. Early results have been “impressive,” the company said in <a href="https://europe.nissannews.com/en-GB/releases/nissan-trialing-cool-paint-technology?&utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8h1s4R5Czk7JBMWZ4wowX4Nd9ceBUpNkhoJPmFvbvdVWBbj_ZW7e0UJooBWUKr298lnWjW" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a news release</a>. The paint seems capable of reducing the car’s internal temperatures by about 10 degrees Fahrenheit, and cutting exterior surface temperatures by about 21 degrees. “A cooler cabin is not only more pleasant to enter, but also requires less air-conditioning run-time to cool the cabin to a comfortable temperature,” Nissan said. “This helps reduce load to the engine, or in the case of an electric vehicle, draw on the battery.

## Tropical Storm Debby swirls over Atlantic, expected to again douse the Carolinas before moving north

date: 2024-08-07, from: VOA News USA

CHARLESTON, S.C.  — Tropical Storm Debby is taking a breather Wednesday over the western Atlantic Ocean but it isn’t done dousing the coastal Carolinas before it slowly marches north.   


Debby was expected to restrengthen and turn north toward the South Carolina coastline for a second landfall late Wednesday or early Thursday, weather officials said. The storm carried the threat not only of additional rainfall but also of tornadoes in coastal sections of the Carolinas spreading north into southeast Virginia on Thursday.   


The slow-moving storm drenched coastal cities in Georgia and South Carolina late Monday into Tuesday, stirring up tornadoes and submerging streets with waist-high floodwaters. The storm has dropped more than a foot (30 centimeters) of rain in some places already and could dump staggering rain totals of up to 25 inches (64 centimeters) in places by the time it ends.   


Charleston and Savannah, Georgia, were deluged into Tuesday, with curfews set and roads blocked by police. Dozens of roads were closed in the city of Charleston because of flooding similar to what it sees several times a year because of rising sea levels.   


As Debby swirls just offshore, the heavy rain is expected to move into parts of South and North Carolina that have already seen two billion-dollar floods in eight years.   


In one Savannah neighborhood, firefighters used boats to evacuate some residents and waded through floodwaters to deliver bottled water and other supplies to those who refused to leave.   


Michael Jones said water gushed into his home Monday evening, overturning the refrigerator and causing furniture to float. Outside, the water seemed to be everywhere and was too deep to flee safely. So Jones spent a sleepless night on his kitchen table before firefighters going door to door came in a boat Tuesday morning.   


“It was hell all night,” Jones said.   


In Charleston, Mayor William Cogswell said the road closures have kept businesses and homes from unnecessary damage and avoided the need for any high-water rescues.   


“We especially don’t need any yahoos driving through the water and causing damage to properties,” Cogswell said.   


Up to 15 inches (38 centimeters) of rain was expected in some places in the Carolinas, totals that are close to what the region saw in a historic flood from Hurricane Matthew in 2016. Two years later, many of those records were broken during Hurricane Florence. Both storms killed dozens.   


North Carolina and Virginia have both declared a state of emergency.   


Several areas along North Carolina's coastline are prone to flooding, such as Wilmington and the Outer Banks. Virginia could see impacts including strong winds, heavy rains and flooding.   


Debby's center was about 90 miles (145) kilometers east of Savannah on Wednesday morning, according to a bulletin from the National Hurricane Center. It had maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (73 kph) and was heading east at 5 mph (8 kph).   


“Tropical cyclones always produce heavy rain, but normally as they’re moving, you know, it doesn’t accumulate that much in one place,” said Richard Pasch, of the hurricane center. “But when they move very slowly, that’s the worst situation.”   


There will be lulls in the rain as dry spells appear between bands around the center of the poorly organized storm, forecasters said. But some bands will be heavy and keep moving over the same places.   


Green Pond in rural Colleton County, South Carolina, reported the most rain so far, just over 14 inches (36 centimeters). A nearby dam had water run over its top but did not crumble, while trees and washouts blocked a number of roads, county Fire-Rescue Assistant Chief David Greene said.   


Close to a foot (30 centimeters) fell down-coast from Charleston to Savannah, where the National Weather Service reported 6.68 inches (17 centimeters) just on Monday. That’s already a month’s worth in a single day: In all of August 2023, the city got 5.56 inches (14.1 centimeters).   


Tornadoes knocked down trees and damaged a few homes on Kiawah Island and Edisto Island.   


Crooked Hammock Brewery in North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, decided to close early Tuesday.   


“Flash flooding is super unpredictable, and we’d rather our staff and guests be home and safe,” marketing coordinator Georgena Dimitriadis said.   


Far to the north in New York City, heavy storms that meteorologists said were being enhanced by Debby flooded some streets and expressways, stranding motorists. The weather service issued a flood watch until noon Wednesday for the entire city.   


Emergency officials warned of potential flash flooding, flying drones with loudspeakers in some New York City neighborhoods to tell people in basement apartments to be ready to flee at a moment’s notice.   


Debby made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday along the Gulf Coast of Florida.   


At least six people have died due to the storm, five of them in traffic accidents or from fallen trees. The sixth death involved a 48-year-old man in Gulfport, Florida, whose body was recovered after his anchored sailboat partially sank, WTSP-TV reported.   


About 500 people were rescued Monday from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, police said. Just north of Sarasota, Manatee County officials said more than 200 people were rescued.   


Officials said it may take two weeks to fully assess the damage in parts of north-central Florida as they wait for rivers to crest.   


“You’re going to see the tributaries rise. That’s just inevitable. How much? We’ll see,” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Tuesday. “It may be that it’s not flooded today and it could be flooded tomorrow.”   


Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp also warned of more rain and flooding to come, saying, “Do not let this storm lull you to sleep.”   


President Joe Biden approved emergency declarations making federal disaster assistance available to Florida, Georgia and South Carolina.   


Debby is finally forecast to pick up speed Thursday, and it could move up the middle of North Carolina, through Virginia and into the Washington area by Saturday.

## Developing a cryptographically secure bootloader for RISC-V in Rust

date: 2024-08-07, from: OS News

It seems to be bootloader season, because we&#8217;ve got another one &#8211; this time, a research project with very limited application for most people. SentinelBoot is a cryptographically secure bootloader aimed at enhancing boot flow safety of RISC-V through memory-safe principles, predominantly leveraging the Rust programming language with its ownership, borrowing, and lifetime constraints. Additionally, SentinelBoot employs public-key cryptography to verify the integrity of a booted kernel (digital signature), by the use of the RISC-V Vector Cryptography extension, establishing secure boot functionality. SentinelBoot achieves these objectives with a 20.1% hashing overhead (approximately 0.27s additional runtime) when compared to an example U-Boot binary (mainline at time of development), and produces a resulting binary one-tenth the size of an example U-Boot binary with half the memory footprint. ↫ Lawrence Hunter SentinelBoot is a project undertaken at the University of Manchester, and its goal is probably clear from the description: to develop a more secure bootloader for RISC V devices. An additional element is that they looked specifically at devices that receive updates over-the-air, like smartphones. In addition, scenarios where an attacker has physical access to the device in question were not considered, for obvious reasons &#8211; in such cases, the attacker can just replace the bootloader altogether anyway, and no amount of fancy Rust code is going to save you there. The details of the implementation as described in the article are definitely a little bit over my head, but the gist seems to be that the project&#8217;s been able to achieve a much more secure boot process without giving up much in performance. This being a research project with an intentionally limited scope does mean it&#8217;s most just something that&#8217;ll immediately benefit all of us, but it&#8217;s these kinds of projects that can really push the state of the art and try out the viability of new ideas.

## Explainer: Tim Walz’s long track record in China

date: 2024-08-07, from: VOA News USA

Taipei, Taiwan  — From teaching at a high school in China to his experience serving on a key congressional committee that focuses on relations between Beijing and Washington, Democratic vice-presidential nominee Tim Walz has a decades-long connection with China dating back to the pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989.


As an educator, Walz taught American History, culture, and English to Chinese students at the Foshan No.1 High School in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong in 1989, the year that saw hundreds of thousands of Chinese students protesting against the ruling Chinese Communist Party in Tiananmen Square.


“China was coming, and that’s the reason that I went,” Walz said in a 2007 interview with The Hill, a Washington D.C.-based news website. During his one-year teaching stint in China, Walz was nicknamed “Fields of China” by his students due to his kindness.


His time in China had an impact on his perspectives of Chinese people’s lives under the ruling Communist Party.


“If they had the proper leadership, there are no limits on what they could accomplish,” he said in an interview with the Star Herald in 1990, describing teaching in China as “one of the best things” he has ever done.


His interest in China didn’t stop there. Upon returning to the United States, Walz and his wife set up a company named “Educational Travel Adventures” to coordinate summer trips to China for American high school students.


Five years after the Tiananmen Square protests and the Chinese government’s violent crackdown, Walz returned to China with his wife for their honeymoon and they brought along two American high school tour groups. Walz continued running the summer exchange program to China for American students with his wife until 2003.


Advocating human rights in China


After becoming a member of Congress in 2007, Walz continued to focus on issues related to China. During his time in Congress, Walz served on the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, which focuses exclusively on human rights issues in the country.




Walz quickly established himself as a vocal critic of the Chinese government, holding regular meetings with high-profile activists from China and Hong Kong, including prominent Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong and Tibet’s spiritual leader Dalai Lama.


In an interview with VOA in 2014, Walz recounted his impression of witnessing the student-led protest in Tiananmen Square unfold. “I remembered waking up and seeing the news on June Fourth that the unthinkable had happened,” he said.


While most Americans at the time decided to leave China due to security concerns following the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989, Walz said he felt it was “more important than ever to go” to China because he wanted to ensure that “the story was told” and let the Chinese people know that the outside world was with them.


In addition to engaging with activists from China and Hong Kong, Walz also co-sponsored several resolutions on key human rights issues in China, including demanding the release of Chinese Nobel laureate Liu Xiaobo and Chinese activist Huang Qi, as well as co-signing the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act in 2017.


In one of his congressional remarks in 2016, Walz highlighted the importance of having “constructive dialogues” with Beijing to ensure “the preservation of traditional Tibetan culture and Tibet’s fragile ecology.”


“The U.S. was founded on the ideas of universal freedom, and I believe that we must continue to urge the Chinese government to provide less regulated religious freedom to the Tibetans,” he said at the time.


Foreign policy boost


In addition to being a vocal critique of China’s human rights record, Walz also expressed concerns about China’s attempt to expand its presence in the South China Sea in 2016, citing Beijing’s efforts to build artificial islands in the disputed water as the reason to oppose Washington’s attempt to reduce military spending.


Despite his strong stance on China’s human rights record and military posture, Walz continued to stress the importance of maintaining cooperation with China. “I don’t fall into the category that China necessarily needs to be an adversarial relationship,” he said in a video interview with Agri-Pulse Communications.


“I think we need to stand firm on what they are doing in the South China Sea, but there [are] many areas of cooperation that we can work on,” Walz added.


Some analysts say Walz’s deep connections to China and track record in U.S.-China diplomacy could potentially help the Democratic presidential pair make more informed decisions on foreign policy, especially on issues related to China.


“I think [his emergence as Democratic vice-presidential nominee] is going to put a lot of people who care a lot about American foreign policy in this part of the world at ease, knowing that there is someone on the ticket who is informed, has spent time in the region, and is not starting from square one when it comes to learning about American foreign policy in East Asia,” said Lev Nachman, a political scientist at National Taiwan University.


He said since Walz has expressed many humanistic views of the Chinese people, Tibetan people, and Hong Kongers, the Minnesota governor could add more nuance to the policy debate related to China in the United States.


“He may be able to articulate the need to push back against China’s authoritarianism and human rights violations in different parts of the world in a way that doesn’t vilify Chinese citizens or doesn’t lean antagonistically in this overtly scare tactic rhetoric that I think a lot of U.S.-China discourse has turned into in the U.S.,” Nachman told VOA by phone.

## The First IRA Tax Credit Data Is In

date: 2024-08-07, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzEyNzgwNi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0MzMyOTEyMn0.3v8nbVscS_4KIAg5wwW9axh9jsaQL49QbQ0Jx9cAVbg/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C1"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">
	More than 3 million American households used the Inflation Reduction Act’s subsidies for homeowners last year, collectively saving more than $8 billion on things like solar panels, batteries, heat pumps, insulation, and other clean energy technologies and efficiency upgrades.
</p><p>
	That’s according to new data released Wednesday by the Treasury Department, which provided the most significant insight yet into how Americans are actually using the IRA. Polling had so far suggested that Americans were curious — 
	<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/biden-climate-legacy" target="_self"><u>if confused</u></a> — about the law’s benefits, but until today, there was no official data available to back up those impressions.
</p><p>
	The data sheds light on usage of two tax credits in particular, one of which encourages Americans to make energy efficient changes to their home, e.g. installing a heat pump or a more efficient water heater, the other of which goes toward installing rooftop solar or another form of zero-carbon energy generation.
</p><p>
	Of the more than 137 million tax returns the government had processed by late May, some 3.4 million of them — or approximately 2.5% — took advantage of at least one of these two subsidies. That’s about 30% more people than used similar, though less generous tax credits in 2021.
</p><p>
	“The Biden Harris administration’s top economic priority is making life more affordable for Americans,” Wally Adeyemo, the deputy secretary of the Treasury, said during a briefing call this week. “The Inflation Reduction Act is doing exactly that.”
</p><p>
	Not all of the data flatters the Biden administration’s goals, however. The tax credits — especially those that reward energy-efficient home upgrades — are used in large part by richer households who have the money and wherewithal to pay for costly upgrades to their homes in the first place. Here are four takeaways from this first crucial look into how the law is going.
</p><h3>1. Americans are using the tax credits more than projected — but that’s mostly because of the popularity of rooftop solar.</h3><p>
	More than 1.2 million Americans used the residential clean energy tax credit, which covers some of the cost of installing clean electricity-generating technology. A comfortable majority of those claiming the credit — some 750,000 — purchased rooftop solar panels.
</p><p>
	When the IRA was first proposed in 2022, the Joint Committee on Taxation 
	<a href="https://www.jct.gov/publications/2022/jcx-22-22/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>projected</u></a> the government would spend $2 billion on the residential clean energy credit in 2023. In fact, it has spent more than triple that — a total of $6.3 billion and counting. The Biden administration expects more claims to appear as tax returns keep rolling in through November.

</iframe></center><h3>2. Uptake is more about geography and economics than politics.</h3><p>
	The top three states claiming the efficiency tax credit were Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont. These states have some of the strongest state energy efficiency policies in the country, according to the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy’s 
	<a href="https://www.aceee.org/press-release/2022/12/scorecard-leading-states-cutting-costs-residents-energy-efficiency-more" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>state scorecard</u></a>, giving homeowners the chance to stack multiple subsidies to help them pay for upgrades. Northeast states also have some of the <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/guides/utilities/electricity-rates-by-state/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>most expensive electricity in the country</u></a>, and <a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/heating-oil/use-of-heating-oil.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>many homes there still use fuel oil heating systems</u></a>, the priciest option for home heating.
</p><center><iframe aria-label="Map" data-external="1" frameborder="0" height="591" id="datawrapper-chart-0hYFr" scrolling="no" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/0hYFr/3/" style="border: none;" title="Sun belt states leapt at the clean energy tax credit ..." width="680">
</iframe></center><p>
	But another set of states dominated the clean energy tax credits, which cover solar panels. The top three states to use that subsidy were Nevada, Florida, and Arizona — some of the sunniest places in the country, which have 
	<a href="https://www.seia.org/sites/default/files/2023-03/SEIA_Top10_Solar_States_2022-YIR%20copy.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>long led on rooftop solar adoption</u></a>.

</iframe></center><p>
	Ironically, West Virginia — home of Senator Joe Manchin, one of the IRA’s architects — was dead last of states that used at least one of the credits.
</p><h3>3. The federal government helped pay for nearly 600,000 new natural gas-burning heating systems.</h3><p>
	The Inflation Reduction Act revived an earlier, expired tax credit that helped Americans pay for energy efficient home upgrades and appliances. But while the new program increased the amount households could get back for installing electric heat pumps from $500 to $2,000, it also kept in place subsidies for “qualified” natural gas heaters. The government helped pay for taxpayers to install nearly 600,000 new natural gas-burning space heating and water heating systems in 2023. Those appliances have a useful life of at least 15 to 20 years.
</p><center><iframe aria-label="Column Chart" data-external="1" frameborder="0" height="525" id="datawrapper-chart-7EZ8w" scrolling="no" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/7EZ8w/2/" style="border: none;" title="Lots of Americans saved on heat pumps ... but more saved on new natural gas appliances" width="680"></iframe></center><p>
	The level of uptake is not necessarily surprising — the upfront cost of a natural gas boiler or furnace is much lower than that of a heat pump system. In many states, natural gas heating systems will 
	<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/heat-pumps-national-renewable-energ-lab" target="_self"><u>also result in lower energy bills</u></a> than a heat pump will.
</p><p>
	Heat pump water heaters are more competitive on cost than space heaters, so there the mismatch may be more of a marketing issue. With the federal tax credit, the upfront cost can be nearly on par with natural gas water heaters, and they actually 
	<a href="https://www.energystar.gov/products/ask-the-experts/heat-pump-water-heater-right-your-home" target="_blank"><u>beat their natural gas-powered brethren</u></a> when it comes to energy bill savings.
</p><h3>4. Wealthier Americans were more likely to take advantage of the IRA.</h3><p>
	On a call with reporters on Tuesday, Adeyemo pointed out that nearly half the families who claimed one or both of the residential clean energy credits had incomes lower than $100,000 in 2023.
</p><p>
	That’s true. But roughly 75% of filers had incomes lower than $100,000 in 2023. When you look at how many people claimed each tax credit as a percentage of the total number of filers 
	<em><em>in that bracket</em></em>, it’s clear that both tax credits are more frequently adopted by higher income Americans.
</p><p>
	There’s also an interesting split between the two credits. Wealthier households were especially enthusiastic about efficiency upgrades — roughly one in 25 of those bringing in more than $100,000 claimed the energy efficiency tax credit.
</p><center><iframe aria-label="Grouped Bars" data-external="1" frameborder="0" height="299" id="datawrapper-chart-SVVoP" scrolling="no" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/SVVoP/1/" style="border: none;" title="Wealthier households were more likely to use the tax credits ... especially on efficiency upgrades" width="680">
</iframe></center><p>
	Adeyemo also pointed out that, since people invest in their home’s heating system rather rarely, the administration expects uptake to increase over time.
</p><p>
	“Our expectation is that as more American families become more familiar with these tax credits, and they look for ways to save money, they’ll continue to see this as a means to do so,” he said. “Given what we’ve heard from some of the companies selling these products, our expectation is that this will continue.”

## Drones warn New Yorkers about storm dangers

date: 2024-08-07, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — Gone is the bullhorn. Instead, New York City emergency management officials have turned high-tech, using drones to warn residents about potential threatening weather.


With a buzzing sound in the background, a drone equipped with a loudspeaker flies over homes warning people who live in basement or ground-floor apartments about impending heavy rains.


“Be prepared to leave your location,” said the voice from the sky in footage released Tuesday by the city's emergency management agency. “If flooding occurs, do not hesitate.”


About five teams with multiple drones each were deployed to specific neighborhoods prone to flooding. Zach Iscol, the city's emergency management commissioner, said the messages were being relayed in multiple languages. They were expected to continue until the weather impacted the drone flights.


Flash floods have been deadly for New Yorkers living in basement apartments, which can quickly fill up in a deluge. Eleven people drowned in such homes in 2011 amid rain from the remnants of Hurricane Ida.


The drones are in addition to other forms of emergency messaging, including social media, text alerts and a system that reaches more than 2,000 community-based organizations throughout the city that serve senior citizens, people with disabilities and other groups.


“You know, we live in a bubble, and we have to meet people where they are in notifications so they can be prepared,” New York City Mayor Eric Adams said at a press briefing on Tuesday.


Adams is a self-described “tech geek” whose administration has tapped drone technology to monitor large gatherings as well as to search for sharks on beaches. Under his watch, the city’s police department also briefly toyed with using a robot to patrol the Times Square subway station, and it has sometimes deployed a robotic dog to dangerous scenes, including the Manhattan parking garage that collapsed in 2023.

## Families of Americans detained in China seek action after US-Russia swap

date: 2024-08-07, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Harrison Li, the son of Kai Li, a Chinese American wrongfully detained in China since 2016, felt a mix of emotions after witnessing the recent return of Americans wrongfully imprisoned in Russia.


Last Thursday, President Joe Biden and the families of those released celebrated the return of three Americans and a permanent resident, including two journalists and an activist, as part of the largest prisoner exchange since the Soviet era.


Kai Li is one of at least three Americans wrongfully detained in China. He was arrested in Shanghai in September 2016 and in 2018 was sentenced to 10 years in prison for espionage, which he has consistently denied. The other two wrongfully detained by China are Texas businessman Mark Swidan and California pastor David Lin.


The U.S. State Department does not disclose the number of wrongful detention cases due to privacy concerns and the sensitivity of efforts to secure the release of wrongfully detained U.S. nationals.


“U.S. citizens are not required to register their travel to a foreign country with us, and we do not maintain comprehensive lists of U.S. citizens residing overseas,” a State Department spokesperson told VOA in an email when asked about the total number of wrongfully detained Americans in China.


For the past eight years, Harrison Li has urged two consecutive U.S. administrations to secure his father's release.


"Our family is extremely pleased to see the return of Paul Whelan, Alsu Kurmasheva, and Evan Gershkovich back to the U.S. and wish them and their families the best in the long road to recovery,” Li told VOA in a written statement.


“Once again, President Biden has shown his willingness to make difficult decisions that prioritize the safety of Americans unjustly detained abroad ... except in China.”


Li expressed frustration over the lack of attention given to his father's case by the U.S. administration.


“All we can do is once again remind the President that my dad has suffered unjustly for almost 8 years now, and that he must act to 'finish the job' before it's too late,” Li wrote.


Several members of Congress are also urging the Biden administration to secure the release of Americans wrongfully detained in China.


Congressman Michael McCaul, chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, told VOA that Americans wrongfully detained in China and elsewhere deserve to be home with their families.


“One American wrongfully detained abroad is too many,” he said. “As wrongfully detained Americans returned home this week from Russia, we cannot forget about those held around the world, including those in China — particularly Mark Swidan, Kai Li, and David Lin.”


Families call for urgent action


Katherine Swidan, the mother of Mark Swidan, revealed that her son has been on a hunger strike for many days. He has been detained in China since 2012 on narcotics trafficking charges, which he denies.


“Mark's been on a hunger strike for 115 days. He’s lost a lot of weight, and he’s been sick. His leg was swollen, and they did a very sparse medical exam,” Swidan told VOA.


According to Swidan, U.S. Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns visited her son in the past.


“When he went to see Mark, he told Mark the next time I come to see you, hopefully it will be to bring you home,” Swidan said.


That message left both her and Mark full of hope, but Mark continues to experience disappointment and anger and has had suicidal tendencies.


“When I talked to him, he said he was in a room with, like, nine other people, seven to nine people. He is doing gardening, planting stuff. But he is furious because he doesn’t understand why they are not pushing for him to come home,” she said.


Renewed focus


Peter Humphrey, a former British reporter in China, was arrested in 2013 and sentenced to two and a half years in prison for illegally obtaining citizen information. He was released early in June 2015 due to health reasons and was deported after medical treatment in Shanghai.


Now a nonresident researcher at Harvard University’s Fairbank Center for China Studies, Humphrey uses his experience to assist foreign citizens detained in China and help them contact government officials. He says he has supported some American detainees whose cases remained unreported for fear that publicity would make their situations worse.


Humphrey believes that after last week’s U.S.-Russia prisoner exchange, the United States should refocus its attention on Americans improperly detained in China and elsewhere.


“These people are arbitrarily detained, and the American government should wake up and understand the fact that it is their duty of care to protect American citizens in China who become victims of this false and cruel process of Chinese justice,” he told VOA. “Some talks are happening but not like significant progress.”


Travel advisory


A U.S. State Department spokesperson said the department has no higher priority than the safety and security of U.S. citizens overseas.


“Secretary Blinken, Ambassador Burns, and other senior U.S. government officials continue to advocate for the immediate and unconditional release of wrongfully detained U.S. citizens in meetings with PRC officials,” the spokesperson told VOA. “The U.S. mission in China will continue to offer consular services to every U.S. citizen detained in the PRC.”


The Department of State travel advisory is at Level 3 for mainland China, recommending that U.S. citizens reconsider travel due to arbitrary enforcement of local laws, exit bans and the risk of wrongful detentions.


“The sad facts are that the PRC has blocked U.S. citizens, including college students, minors, businesspeople and tourists from leaving the country. U.S. citizens have been wrongfully detained by the PRC, and the PRC often arbitrarily enforces its own laws,” the spokesperson said.


Family appeals


Nelson and Cynthia Wells, whose son Nelson Wells Jr. was detained in China in 2014 and sentenced to life imprisonment for "drug smuggling" (later commuted to 22 years), have written letters to three consecutive U.S. presidents about their son’s imprisonment but have never received a response.


“We also don't know if they received the letters,” they said. “I really believe that if we're high-profile people, well, if we're famous, or we're a top athlete, or we have a lot of money, or we have any type of political connections, then we might get some recognition,” Nelson Wells told VOA.


The case has drawn the attention of U.S. Senators John Kennedy and Bill Cassidy, who are advocating for Nelson Wells Jr. to be recognized as "wrongfully detained." Last October, Nelson and Cynthia Wells spoke with House Speaker Mike Johnson, who assured them he continues to address the issue.

## Musk's X sues advertisers over alleged 'massive advertiser boycott'

date: 2024-08-06, from: VOA News USA

wichita falls, texas  — Elon Musk's social media platform X has sued a group of advertisers, alleging that a "massive advertiser boycott" deprived the company of billions of dollars in revenue and violated antitrust laws.


The company formerly known as Twitter filed the lawsuit Tuesday in a federal court in Texas against the World Federation of Advertisers and member companies Unilever, Mars, CVS Health and Orsted.


It accused the advertising group's brand safety initiative, called the Global Alliance for Responsible Media, of helping to coordinate a pause in advertising after Musk bought Twitter for $44 billion in late 2022 and overhauled its staff and policies.


Musk posted about the lawsuit on X on Tuesday, saying "now it is war" after two years of being nice and "getting nothing but empty words."


X CEO Linda Yaccarino said in a video announcement that the lawsuit stemmed in part from evidence uncovered by the U.S. House Judiciary Committee, which she said showed a "group of companies organized a systematic illegal boycott" against X.


The Republican-led committee had a hearing last month looking at whether current laws are "sufficient to deter anticompetitive collusion in online advertising."


The lawsuit's allegations center on the early days of Musk's Twitter takeover and not a more recent dispute with advertisers that came a year later.


In November 2023, about a year after Musk bought the company, a number of advertisers began fleeing X over concerns about their ads showing up next to pro-Nazi content and hate speech on the site in general, with Musk inflaming tensions with his own posts endorsing an antisemitic conspiracy theory.


Musk later said those fleeing advertisers were engaging in blackmail and, using a profanity, essentially told them to go away.


The Belgium-based World Federation of Advertisers and representatives for CVS, Orsted, Mars and Unilever didn't immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday.


A top Unilever executive testified at last month's congressional hearing, defending the British consumer goods company's practice of choosing to put ads on platforms that won't harm its brand.


"Unilever, and Unilever alone, controls our advertising spending," said prepared written remarks by Herrish Patel, president of Unilever USA. "No platform has a right to our advertising dollar."

## Iranian plot to kill US officials, politicians tied to Pakistani man

date: 2024-08-06, from: VOA News USA

Washington — An Iranian plot to kill former U.S. President Donald Trump appears to have centered on a Pakistani man with ties to Tehran who hoped to also target other high-profile politicians and officials.


The U.S. Justice Department on Tuesday unsealed charges against 46-year-old Asif Merchant, saying he traveled to the U.S. this April in search of hitmen willing to take on multiple jobs.


But according to the criminal complaint, the plot fizzled after the person Merchant contacted in his effort to carry out the scheme reached out to law enforcement.


"This dangerous murder-for-hire plot exposed in [Tuesday's] complaint allegedly was orchestrated by a Pakistani national with close ties to Iran and is straight out of the Iranian playbook," FBI Director Christopher Wray said in a statement.


"A foreign-directed plot to kill a public official, or any U.S. citizen, is a threat to our national security and will be met with the full might and resources of the FBI," he said.


The criminal complaint unsealed in New York does not identify any specific target for Merchant's plot, but the release comes just weeks after U.S. officials said they had increased security for the former president due to a threat linked to Tehran.


And the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee said Tuesday that the threats were one and the same.


"I was previously briefed concerning the Iranian threat and the circumstances of Mr. Merchant's arrest and questioned then-Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle on whether she had reviewed the intelligence concerning the Iranian threat," Republican Representative Mike Turner said in a statement.


"She confirmed to me that she read the intelligence and was aware of this Iranian murder-for-hire plot," Turner added, referring to a July 22 hearing on the failures to prevent an unrelated assassination attempt against Trump on July 13 during a campaign rally in western Pennsylvania.




Tuesday's charges are the latest in a growing list of foiled plots designed to kill Americans and other enemies of Iran on U.S. soil.


This past January, the U.S. charged three men, one of whom was based in Iran, in a plot to murder two U.S. residents in the state of Maryland.




The U.S. has also brought charges in plots targeting Masih Alinejad, an Iranian American human rights activist and VOA Persian TV host and a murder-for-hire scheme targeting former U.S. national security adviser Ambassador John Bolton.


Many of the recent threats, including the ones targeting Bolton and Trump, stem from Tehran's desire to seek revenge for the Trump-ordered January 2020 drone strike in Baghdad that killed Qassem Soleimani, the leader of the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' Quds Force.


"We have said many times that we've been tracking Iranian threats against former politicians. We've been very clear about that," White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Tuesday.


"We consider this a national and homeland security matter of the highest priority," she said. "We have invested extraordinary resources in developing additional information about these threats, disrupting individuals involved in these threats, enhancing protective arrangements and potential targets of these threats, engaging with foreign partners and directly warning Iran."


The court-appointed lawyer for the defendant in this latest plot targeting Trump, and others, declined comment when contacted by VOA.


But the charging documents allege Merchant traveled from Pakistan to Turkey and then to Houston, Texas, in April, after spending about two weeks in Iran.


Once he landed in the U.S., the criminal complaint states, Merchant immediately began recruiting individuals to assist him with the plan, telling the informant that he could earn up to $100,000 and that the scheme would target multiple individuals.


"[The] people who will be targeted are the ones who are hurting Pakistan and the world, [the] Muslim world. These are not normal people," Merchant said, according to the charging documents.


Steal, plan, kill


During meetings in New York in June, Merchant allegedly sketched out a three-part plan that involved stealing documents or computer files from a target's home, planning protests and then killing the targets on U.S. soil.


Merchant is charged with giving two undercover agents posing as hitmen a $5,000 advanced payment in late June to carry out the plot, adding more money would be coming after he returned to Pakistan.


U.S. law enforcement officials arrested Merchant on July 12, before he was able to leave the U.S.


"For years, the Justice Department has been working aggressively to counter Iran's brazen and unrelenting efforts to retaliate against American public officials for the killing of Iranian General Soleimani," said Attorney General Merrick Garland in a statement Tuesday.


"The Justice Department will spare no resource to disrupt and hold accountable those who would seek to carry out Iran's lethal plotting."


U.S. officials expect there will be no let-up in Tehran's attempts to get revenge.


"We need to recognize the brazenness of the Iranian regime," the FBI's Wray told U.S. lawmakers during a hearing late last month. "I expect we're going to see more of it. I expect there will be more coming on that."


And some experts warn that even if some of the Iranian attempts appear amateurish, they need to be taken seriously.


"Much like Iranian projectiles, sometimes quantity has a quality of its own," said Behnam Ben Taleblu, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies.


"On the one hand, some of these things may sound cartoonish or too far-fetched, but on the other hand, there's a persistence behind it, which is worrisome," he told VOA. "My fear is that it's going to be throwing everything or what it can at the wall and seeing what sticks."

## US-Australia talks focus on China's 'coercive behavior,' climate change

date: 2024-08-06, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON/SYDNEY — The United States and Australia kicked off high-level talks Tuesday that will focus on China's "coercive behavior," as well as the AUKUS nuclear submarine project, mounting tensions in the Middle East and climate change, officials said.


The annual Australia-U.S. AUSMIN talks, taking place in Annapolis, Maryland, include the top defense and diplomatic officials from both nations.


"We're working together today to tackle shared security challenges, from coercive behavior by the PRC [People's Republic of China], to Russia's war of choice against Ukraine, to the turmoil in the Middle East," U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said.


"And I know that [this] year's AUSMIN will deliver results for both of our peoples."


The U.S. and China are at odds on a range of issues, including U.S. support for Taiwan. Another topic will be Chinese military activity in the South China Sea. China claims control over most of the sea, including the disputed Second Thomas Shoal, where U.S. ally the Philippines has maritime claims.


Austin spoke in the wake of a rocket strike on Monday in Iraq that wounded seven U.S. personnel, as the Middle East braced for a possible new wave of attacks by Iran and its allies following last week's killing of senior leaders of militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah.


Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong and Defense Minister Richard Marles held meetings in Washington on Monday, a day before the AUSMIN talks.


Marles highlighted the expanding role of a U.S. Marine rotational force in northern Australia and defense industry cooperation.


"We're seeing America's force posture in Australia grow really significantly. AUKUS is part of that, but it's not the only part of that," Marles said in talks with Austin, according to a statement.


Under the AUKUS program, Washington will sell three nuclear-powered submarines to Australia in the next decade. Wong said there was bipartisan U.S. political support for the program.


U.S. Ambassador to Australia Caroline Kennedy told ABC Television that China and climate change — priorities for the Pacific Islands, where the U.S. and Australia are competing with China for security ties — would be discussed.


"Obviously with China being such an important ... trading partner and competitor for both of us, that is obviously one of the main topics," she said.


"We are also talking about what we can do together to fight climate change [and] to help the Pacific Islands to build critical infrastructure to connect them," she said.


As part of cooperating on environmental and resource issues, Australia will spend $200 million ($130 million U.S.) to upgrade ground station facilities in its remote central desert to process data from NASA's Landsat Next satellite.


Landsat Next is an earth observation program the U.S. space agency says will provide early warnings on the onset of fires or ice melting. The program is scheduled to be launched in 2030.


U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the satellite data would also be used to target resource exploration in Australia, as the two nations develop a supply chain for critical minerals.


The U.S. and its allies are seeking to reduce China's market dominance in rare earths and critical minerals used in electric vehicles and defense technology.

## US blames Iran-backed militia for attack on air base in Iraq

date: 2024-08-06, from: VOA News USA

Washington — The United States accused an Iranian-backed militia of carrying out a rocket attack on a U.S. air base in Iraq that injured seven people, two of whom had to be evacuated for additional medical treatment.


"We're sure that it was an Iranian-backed Shia militia group," U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told reporters Tuesday during a news conference in Annapolis, Maryland, with Australian officials.


"Specifically which group, we're still investigating," he added.


U.S. officials had previously said two rockets slammed into the al-Asad air base in western Iraq during Monday's attack, wounding five service members and two contractors.


Despite the need to evacuate two of the injured, officials said all seven were in stable condition.


Earlier Tuesday, the Iraqi military said in a statement that it had found the truck and rocket launcher used in the attack in the nearby town of Haditha.



It also said it was getting closer to finding the perpetrators.



"They are currently being pursued to bring them to justice," the statement said.


The attack came as much of the region has been on edge, awaiting a possible attack by Iran and its proxies against Israel in retaliation for the killing of senior members of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah and Hamas terror groups.



Austin, though, declined to comment on media reports that Iran's reprisal might be imminent.


"I'm not going to speculate on any Iranian actions going forward," he said. "What I've been focused on is making sure that we're doing everything we can to put measures in place to protect our troops, and also make sure that we're in a good position to aid in the in the defense of Israel if called upon to do that."



Austin announced Friday that the Pentagon was sending additional warships, an aircraft carrier strike group, and additional fighter jets to the region to prepare for an Iranian attack, as well starting preparations to send land-based missile defense capabilities, if needed.




Speaking alongside Austin on Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged all parties in the region to seek calm.


"It is manifestly in the interests of everyone involved to avoid escalation, to avoid the conflict spreading," he told reporters.


"I believe that actually no one wants escalation, no one wants to see the conflict spread," Blinken added. "But it's very important that no one takes steps that could lead to that, even if it's unintended."


Some U.S. partners in the Middle East appear to be heeding that call.


In its statement Tuesday, the Iraqi military condemned the rocket attack on the al-Asad air base as irresponsible.


"We reject all reckless actions and practices targeting Iraqi bases, diplomatic missions, and the whereabouts of the international coalition's advisers, and everything that would raise tension in the region," the Iraqi statement said.


Iraq hosts about 2,500 U.S. troops tasked with advising and assisting Iraqi forces as they pursue the remnants of the Islamic State group, also known as ISIS, or Daesh.


But Iraq is also home to numerous Iranian-backed militias, some of which have been consulting with Tehran about the anticipated retaliation against Israel.


Additionally, there has been periodic tension between Washington and Baghdad.


The U.S. and Iraq have been engaged in recent, ongoing talks to eventually end the anti-IS mission and transition to what officials have described as a bilateral military partnership.



Some information from Reuters was used in this report.

## 'Pro-democracy activist' convicted in US of giving dissidents' intel to China

date: 2024-08-06, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — A Chinese American scholar was convicted Tuesday of U.S. charges of using his reputation as a pro-democracy activist to gather information on dissidents and feed it to his homeland's government.


A federal jury in New York delivered the verdict in the case of Shujun Wang, who helped found a pro-democracy group in the city.


Prosecutors said that at the behest of China's main intelligence agency, the Ministry of State Security, Wang lived a double life for over a decade.


"The defendant pretended to be opposed to the Chinese government so that he could get close to people who were actually opposed to the Chinese government," Assistant U.S. Attorney Ellen Sise said in an opening statement last month. "And then, the defendant betrayed those people, people who trusted him, by reporting information on them to China."


Wang was convicted of charges that include conspiring to act as a foreign agent without notifying the attorney general. He had pleaded not guilty.


A message seeking comment was sent to Wang's attorneys.


Wang came to New York in 1994 to teach after doing so at a Chinese university. He later became a U.S. citizen.


He helped found the Queens-based Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang Memorial Foundation, named for two leaders of the Chinese Communist Party in the 1980s.


According to prosecutors, Wang composed emails — styled as "diaries" — that recounted conversations, meetings and plans of various critics of the Chinese government.


One message was about events commemorating the 1989 protests and bloody crackdown in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, prosecutors said. Other emails talked about people planning demonstrations during various visits that Chinese President Xi Jinping made to the U.S.


Instead of sending the emails and creating a digital trail, Wang saved them as drafts that Chinese intelligence officers could read by logging in with a shared password, prosecutors said.


In other, encrypted messages, Wang relayed details of upcoming pro-democracy events and plans to meet with a prominent Hong Kong dissident while the latter was in the United States, according to an indictment.


During a series of FBI interviews between 2017 and 2021, Wang initially said he had no contacts with the Ministry of State Security, but he later acknowledged on videotape that the intelligence agency asked him to gather information on democracy advocates and that he sometimes did, FBI agents testified.


But, they said, he claimed he didn't provide anything valuable, just information already in the public domain.


Wang's lawyers portrayed him as a gregarious academic with nothing to hide.


"In general, fair to say he was very open and talkative with you, right?" defense attorney Zachary Margulis-Ohnuma asked an undercover agent who approached Wang in 2021 under the guise of being affiliated with the Chinese security ministry.


"He was," said the agent, who testified under a pseudonym. He recorded his conversation with Wang at the latter's house in Connecticut.


"Did he seem a little lonely?" Margulis-Ohnuma asked a bit later. The agent said he didn't recall.


Wang told agents his "diaries" were advertisements for the foundation's meetings or write-ups that he was publishing in newspapers, according to testimony. He also suggested to the undercover agent that publishing them would be a way to deflect any suspicion from U.S. authorities.


Another agent, Garrett Igo, told jurors that when Wang found out in 2019 that investigators would search his phone for any contacts in the Chinese government, he paused for a minute.


"And then he said, 'Do anything. I don't care,'" Igo recalled.

## China to beef up regulations on fentanyl chemicals, White House says

date: 2024-08-06, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — China said it would begin adding controls and regulation to the production of three chemicals used to make illicit fentanyl, the White House said on Tuesday, calling the move "a valuable step forward." 


It is the third significant such action since the United States and China resumed bilateral counter-narcotics cooperation in November 2023, acting National Security Council spokesperson Sean Savett said in a statement. 


Illicit fentanyl remains a potent issue for U.S. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, who has clinched the Democratic nomination for the November 5 U.S. presidential election. Fentanyl overdoses have surged to become the leading cause of death for Americans between the ages of 18 and 45 and over 107,000 Americans died from drug overdoses in 2023. 


As part of an effort launched last year to thaw icy relations with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Biden agreed to cooperate with Beijing on counter-narcotics. 


A delegation of senior Chinese officials met Biden administration officials last Wednesday to continue conversations on increasing controls on fentanyl chemicals and restricting financing for the drug trade in China. 


A U.S. congressional committee said in April that China was directly subsidizing production of illicit fentanyl precursors for sale abroad and fueling the U.S. opioid crisis, releasing findings from an investigation it said unveiled Beijing's incentives for the deadly chemicals.

## Wall Street bounces back from its biggest wipeout in almost 2 years

date: 2024-08-06, from: VOA News USA

New York — Stocks closed higher on Wall Street as calm returned to the market a day after its biggest pullback in almost two years.


The S&P 500 rose 1% Tuesday, breaking a brutal three-day losing streak. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.8%, and the Nasdaq composite added 1%. Strong profit reports from Uber and other companies helped support the market.


Most stocks climbed in a mirror opposite of the day before, when the unraveling of some popular trades and worries about the U.S. economy wracked markets. Treasury yields climbed, clawing back some of their sharp drops since April.


Stronger-than-expected profit reports from several big U.S. companies helped drive the market. Kenvue, the company behind Tylenol and Band-Aids, jumped 14.5% after reporting a stronger profit than expected thanks in part to higher prices for its products. Uber rolled 11.2% higher after easily topping profit forecasts for the latest quarter.


Caterpillar climbed 3.8% after the maker of heavy machinery reported stronger earnings than expected.


The whiplash moves for financial markets globally have been the result of several technical factors, not just worries ignited by several weaker-than-expected reports on the U.S. economy, in what strategists at Barclays called "a perfect storm" for causing extreme market moves.


One is centered in Tokyo, where a favorite trade for hedge funds and other investors began unraveling last week after the Bank of Japan made borrowing more expensive by raising interest rates above virtually zero. That scrambled trades where investors had borrowed Japanese yen at low cost and invested the cash elsewhere around the world. The resulting exits from those investments may have helped accelerate the declines for markets around the world.


Japan's Nikkei 225 jumped 10.2% Tuesday to claw back much of its 12.4% sell-off the day before, which was its worst since the Black Monday crash of 1987. Stocks in Tokyo rebounded as the value of the Japanese yen stabilized against the U.S. dollar following several days of sharp gains.


"The speed, the magnitude and the shock factor clearly demonstrate" how much of the moves were driven by how traders were positioned, according to the strategists at Barclays led by Stefano Pascale and Anshul Gupta. It wasn't just worries about the U.S. economy.


Too soon to relax?


Still, some voices along Wall Street are continuing to urge caution.


Barry Bannister, chief equity strategist at Stifel, is warning more drops could be ahead because of a slowing U.S. economy and sticky inflation. He's forecasting both will be worse in the second half of this year than what much of Wall Street expects.


The stock market's "dip is not a blip," he warned in a report, and called it "too soon to jump back in."


He had been predicting a coming correction in U.S. stock prices for a while, including an acknowledgement in July that his initial call was early. That was a couple days before the S&P 500 set its latest all-time high and then began sinking.


While fears are rising about a slowing U.S. economy, it is still growing, and a recession is far from a certainty or even, as some economists say, from a likelihood. The U.S. stock market is also still up a healthy amount for the year so far, and the Federal Reserve says it has ample room to cut interest rates to help the economy if the job market weakens significantly.


S&P 500


The S&P 500 has romped to dozens of all-time highs this year and is still up more than 10% this year so far, in part because of a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology. Critics have been saying that euphoria has sent stock prices too high in many cases.


They've pointed in particular to Nvidia, Apple and the other handful of Big Tech stocks in the "Magnificent Seven" that were the main reason the S&P 500 set so many records this year. They helped overshadow weakness across other areas of the stock market, which were struggling under the weight of high interest rates.


A set of underwhelming profit reports recently, kicked off by Tesla and Alphabet, added to the pessimism and dragged Big Tech stocks lower. Nvidia dropped nearly 19% from the start of July through Monday on such concerns, but it rose 5.8% Tuesday and was one of the strongest forces pushing upward on the market.


Apple, though, slipped another 0.7% and was a heavy weight on the market.


Bond market


In the bond market, Treasury yields climbed to claw back some of their sharp drops since April, which were driven by rising expectations for coming cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve.


The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 3.89% from 3.78% late Monday. It had briefly dropped below 3.70% during Monday when fear in the market was spiking and investors were speculating the Federal Reserve could even have to call an emergency meeting to cut interest rates quickly.

## Tim Walz Supercharges Kamala Harris’ Climate Cred

date: 2024-08-06, from: Heatmap News

	It’s official: Minnesota Governor Tim Walz <a href="https://x.com/rudyfunkmeyer/status/1819093209991000413" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>got the rose</u></a>.
</p><p>
	On Tuesday morning, after days of frenzied speculation that floated names including Governor Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, and Governor Andy Beshear of Kentucky, Kamala Harris <a href="https://x.com/KamalaHarris/status/1820828396298879294" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>announced</u></a> that Walz’s name will be the one to underline hers on the presumptive Democratic presidential ticket.
</p><p>
	Many on the climate left will likely be thrilled by the pick: Of all the finalists reportedly in contention for VP, Walz had the most impressive clean energy and environmental accomplishments. An Army veteran and former congressman of a rural, otherwise conservative Minnesota district, Walz has a record of <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/timothy_walz/412214/report-card/2016#:~:text=Joined%20bipartisan%20bills%20the%209th%20most%20often%20compared%20to%20All%20Representatives" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>working across party lines</u></a> to get things accomplished. In 2009, he memorably <a href="https://www.startribune.com/walz-defends-cap-and-trade-vote-says-bill-was-likely-to-change/99954784" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>voted</u></a> for the doomed cap-and-trade bill and defended his position to <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2009/08/04/farmfest" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>tough crowds</u></a> of Midwestern farmers and ranchers.
</p><p>
	Within <a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/eenews/1060123097" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>months</u></a> of being sworn in as Governor of Minnesota in 2019, Walz set a goal for his state to get its electricity from 100% carbon-free sources by 2050. At the time, only <a href="https://www.cesa.org/projects/100-clean-energy-collaborative/guide/table-of-100-clean-energy-states/#:~:text=There%20are%20currently%2024%20states,including%20Puerto%20Rico%2C%20click%20here." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a few other states</u></a> had similar goals. “Climate change is an existential threat. We must take immediate action,” Walz <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2019/03/04/walz-carbon-free-electricity-2050" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>argued at the time</u></a>. “If Washington is not going to lead, Minnesota will lead.”
</p><p>
	By the time Walz signed <a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/politics/minnesotas-new-climate-bill-is-ambitious-100-clean-energy-by-2040" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>actual emissions legislation</u></a> into law last year, he’d set an even more ambitious timeline — carbon-free electricity by <em><em>2040</em></em>. The bill also streamlined permitting, set a minimum wage for employees constructing large-scale utility projects, and included an environmental justice provision to keep energy from waste incineration plants in frontline communities from counting toward the 2040 goal. Minnesota continued “<a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/politics/3-ways-minnesota-is-crushing-it-on-climate-action" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>crushing it on climate action</u></a>” in the months that followed, with Walz securing a $2 billion budget package that included grid improvements, solar panels on state-owned buildings, an electric-vehicle rebate program, heat pump grants and rebates, a green bank, and more. He also signed a transportation bill to overhaul transit hubs, expand passenger rail service, improve infrastructure, and offer electric bike credits.
</p><p>
	And he hasn’t stopped. Earlier this summer, Walz <a href="https://mn.gov/governor/newsroom/press-releases/?id=1055-638440" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>announced a $200 million grant</u></a> to reduce food-related pollution, including protecting and restoring carbon-absorbing peatlands, improving food waste programs, and replacing gas-powered agricultural machinery with trucks that run on electricity or clean fuel. The state is also <a href="https://x.com/MarketUrbanism/status/1757427324734112164" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>considering bills</u></a> that would <a href="https://www.minnpost.com/cityscape/2024/03/the-minnesota-building-code-should-loosen-up-about-single-stair-buildings/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reform building </u></a><u>codes</u> to improve access to affordable housing — an issue Walz has taken a personal interest in. Walz is also, apparently, a <a href="https://x.com/cafedujord/status/1820825017745383800" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>YIMBY on energy permitting</u></a>.
</p><center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">YIMBYs to the white house!<br/><br/>"We have permitting that takes too long...and prohibits or makes more expensive doing renewable energy projects. I think that same thing applies to housing. We put up barriers to making it more affordable." - Democratic VP Candidate Tim Walz <a href="https://t.co/MAiy3Ct5B5">https://t.co/MAiy3Ct5B5</a> <a href="https://t.co/EnswfMw67g">pic.twitter.com/EnswfMw67g</a><br/>— Jordan Grimes 🚰 (@cafedujord) <a href="https://twitter.com/cafedujord/status/1820825017745383800?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 6, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script></center><p>
	Walz’s <a href="https://www.fox9.com/news/gov-walz-kicked-off-harris-campaigns-weird-attack-line" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>canny communication skills</u></a> have already been much remarked upon, and he’s openly recognized that many on the left struggle with <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/climate-inflation-poll" target="_self"><u>a messaging problem</u></a> regarding climate change. “The surest way to get people to buy in is to create a job that pays well in their community,” the governor <a href="https://time.com/7006717/tim-walz-kamala-harris-vp-climate-change/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>told</u><u><em><em> Time</em></em></u><u>’s Justin Worland</u></a>. “All of us are going to have to be better about our smart politics, about bringing people in.”
</p><p>
	Walz’s record isn’t spotless, though. During his congressional career, he earned a <a href="https://scorecard.lcv.org/moc/tim-walz" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>score of just 75%</u></a> from the League of Conservation Voters. Earlier this summer, a coalition of 16 environmental groups, including the local Sierra Club chapter, <a href="https://peoplenotpolluters.com/agency-failures" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>called out Walz and his administration</u></a> for being too soft on regulation, including state agencies’ reliance on farmers voluntarily complying with <a href="https://peoplenotpolluters.com/agency-failures/nitrate-pollution" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>nitrate pollution limits</u></a>, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency’s <a href="https://peoplenotpolluters.com/agency-failures/smith-foundry" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>failure</u></a> to adequately police air quality violations from a foundry in a low-income neighborhood, and what the group argued was <a href="https://peoplenotpolluters.com/agency-failures/enbridge-line-3" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a flawed permitting process</u></a> for a crude oil pipeline built through wetlands. North Dakota Republicans — including Governor Doug Burgum, who’s been <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-cabinet" target="_self"><u>floated for a potential Trump cabinet</u></a> — have <a href="https://www.secureenergyfuture.org/post/e-e-news-burgum-says-unconstitutional-minn-climate-law-must-allow-ccs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>pressured Walz</u></a> to include carbon capture as a carbon-free energy technology under the state’s emissions law (currently, decisions over CCS and hydrogen are under the purview of Minnesota’s Public Utilities Commission).
</p><p>
	There’s also the small matter that Harris and Walz <em><em>have to actually win</em></em> to be able to <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/kamala-harris-climate-record" target="_self"><u>enact any of their climate goals</u></a><em><em>. </em></em>At least on paper, the math had looked slightly better for Pennsylvania Governor Shapiro, who is an <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/josh-shapiro-approval-republicans-independents-20240513.html#:~:text=About%2057%25%20of%20Pennsylvanians%20strongly%20or%20somewhat%20approve%20of%20Shapiro%E2%80%99s%20leadership%2C" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>incredibly popular governor</u></a> in <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/08/02/josh-shapiro-harris-vp-running-mate" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a must-win state</u></a>. “Minnesota is very unlikely to be the tipping point state — less than a 1% chance,” Nate Silver <a href="https://www.natesilver.net/p/tim-walz-is-a-minnesota-nice-choice?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=1198116&post_id=147406197&utm_campaign=email-post-title&isFreemail=true&r=5fio&triedRedirect=true&utm_medium=email" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>wrote</u></a> Tuesday morning, arguing that Shapiro would have been a better pick despite <a href="https://jacobin.com/2024/08/josh-shapiro-harris-vice-president" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>mounting criticism</u></a> from progressives.
</p><p>
	Within hours of the news, though, the climate left had already enthusiastically circled around Walz. In a statement, Evergreen Action Executive Director Lena Moffitt applauded Walz’s “masterclass in how to govern in a way that meaningfully improves people’s lives and sets the state up for a thriving future.” Cassidy DiPaola, the communications director at Fossil Free Media and a spokesperson for the Make Polluters Pay campaign, likewise acknowledged Walz’s progress on green issues, nodding to his “evolution into a climate champion.” She added that Walz has more than proven himself at the state level and that “his ability to connect climate policy to the everyday concerns of Midwestern and rural voters could prove invaluable in building broader support for climate action.”
</p><p>
	That, after all, will be the big question. Early voting for the next president of the United States begins in 41 days.

## It's not partisanship when democracy is at stake

date: 2024-08-06, from: Ben Werdmuller's blog


<div class="e-content aside-content">
<p><img src="https://werd.io/file/66b23330c1a4638bb9020f12/thumb.jpg" alt="It's the stars and stripes, innit" width="1024" height="683"></p><p>This moment isn’t about partisanship, because the discussions we’re having aren’t about tax policy or the intricacies of how we interact overseas. In 2024, one candidate’s supporters are waving flags that read “mass deportations now”, while the candidate is telling them they’ll never need to vote in another election and calling for the termination of parts of the Constitution. The other candidate, while we might quibble about policy differences, is advocating for fairness and inclusivity, and, you know, <em>continuing to have a democracy</em>.</p><p>So I don’t have any qualms about throwing myself in for Harris and Walz. I would have voted for Biden and Harris, too, and probably also three ferrets in a trenchcoat, as long as we were sure the ferrets didn’t advocate for a white Christian nation. As it happens, I’m more aligned with Harris and Walz than I have been with any Presidential candidate maybe ever; certainly the last time I felt anything close to this excitement was when Obama was running in the wake of eight disastrous years under George W Bush. Even Obama was cautious on the campaign trail and knocked back support for marriage equality, for example.</p><p>I’m particularly excited to see us move beyond the level of discourse where we’re arguing about democracy vs not-democracy. Let’s get into the intricacies of how we can help people without homes get back on their feet, or to figure out how to help people buy their first houses; let’s talk about literacy levels and how to move ourselves away from fossil fuels without losing jobs and improving working conditions. A return to a marketplace of genuine ideas rather than ideas vs unbridled id would be an incredible step forward. I can’t <em>wait</em> to talk about tax policy again.</p><p>And yeah, I’m looking forward to not thinking about That Guy, the folks behind Project 2026, and their brand of nationalism for a good long time. We need to move forward. We’re not going back.</p><p>The future could be much, much brighter than it has been for almost a decade. Now we just have to win this thing.</p></div>

## WordStar for DOS 7.0 archive

date: 2024-08-06, from: OS News

As you all know, I continue to use WordStar for DOS 7.0 as my word-processing program. It was last updated in December 1992, and the company that made it has been defunct for decades; the program is abandonware. There was no proper archive of WordStar for DOS 7.0 available online, so I decided to create one. I’ve put weeks of work into this. Included are not only full installs of the program (as well as images of the installation disks), but also plug-and-play solutions for running WordStar for DOS 7.0 under Windows, and also complete full-text-searchable PDF versions of all seven manuals that came with WordStar — over a thousand pages of documentation. ↫ Robert J. Sawyer WordStar for DOS is definitely a bit of a known entity in our circles for still being used by a number of world-famous authors. WordStar 4.0 is still being used by George R. R. Martin &#8211; assuming he&#8217;s still even working on The Winds of Winter &#8211; and there must be some sort of reason as to why it&#8217;s still so oddly popular. Thanks to this work by author Robert J. Sawyer, accessing and using version 7 of WordStar for DOS is now easier than ever. One of the reasons Sawyer set out to do this was making sure that if he passes away, the people responsible for his estate and works will have an easy way to access his writings. It&#8217;s refreshing to see an author think ahead this far, and it will surely help a ton of other people too, since there&#8217;s quite a few documents lingering around using the WordStar format.

## Slow-moving Tropical Storm Debby bringing torrential rains, major flood threat to southeastern US

date: 2024-08-06, from: VOA News USA

HORSESHOE BEACH, Fla. — Tropical Storm Debby moved menacingly into some of America’s most historic Southern cities and was expected to bring prolonged downpours and flooding throughout the day Tuesday after slamming into Florida and prompting the rescue of hundreds from flooded homes.


Record-setting rain from the storm that killed at least five people was causing flash flooding, with up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) possible in some areas, the National Hurricane Center said.


The storm’s center was over southeast Georgia early Tuesday with maximum sustained winds near 45 mph (75 kph) and it was moving northeast near 7 mph (11 kph). The center is expected to move off Georgia’s coast later Tuesday. Some strengthening is forecast Wednesday and Thursday as Debby drifts offshore, before it moves inland Thursday over South Carolina.


“Hunker down,” Van Johnson, the mayor of Savannah, Georgia, told residents in a social media livestream Monday night. “Expect that it will be a rough day” on Tuesday, he said.


More than 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain had fallen through Monday at Savannah's airport, but more rain fell overnight and was continuing Tuesday, the National Weather Service reported.


Flash flood warnings were issued in Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, among other areas of coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Both Savannah and Charleston announced curfews Monday night into Tuesday.




In South Carolina, Charleston County Interim Emergency Director Ben Webster called Debby a “historic and potentially unprecedented event” three times in a 90-second briefing Monday.


In addition to the curfew, the city of Charleston's emergency plan includes sandbags for residents, opening parking garages so residents can park their cars above floodwaters and an online mapping system that shows which roads are closed due to flooding.


In Edisto Beach, South Carolina, a tornado touched down Monday night, damaging trees, homes and taking down power lines, the Colleton County Sheriff's Office said on social media. No injuries were immediately reported, officials said.


The weather service continued issuing tornado warnings well into Monday night for parts of the state including Hilton Head Island.


At the edge of Hilton Head Island, musician Nick Poulin wasn’t overly concerned about Debby since his equipment was inside and he made sure that his car wasn’t parked under trees so it won’t be hit by falling branches.


“I’m born and raised here, so we’ve had plenty of storms,” he said. “It’s usually not as bad as people hype it up to be.”


Debby made landfall along the Gulf Coast of Florida early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. It has weakened to a tropical storm and is moving slowly, drenching and bringing areas of catastrophic flooding across portions of eastern Georgia, the coastal plain of South Carolina and southeast North Carolina through Wednesday.




About 500 people were rescued Monday from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, the Sarasota Police Department said in a social media post. Just north of Sarasota, officials in Manatee County said in a news release that 186 people were rescued from flood waters.


“Essentially we’ve had twice the amount of the rain that was predicted for us to have,” Sarasota County Fire Chief David Rathbun said on social media.


Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that the state could continue to see threats as waterways north of the border fill up and flow south.


“It is a very saturating, wet storm,” he said. “When they crest and the water that’s going to come down from Georgia, it’s just something that we’re going to be on alert for not just throughout today, but for the next week.”


Five people had died due to the storm as of Monday night, including a truck driver on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over the edge before the cab dropped into the water below. Sheriff’s office divers located the driver, a 64-year-old man from Mississippi, in the cab 40 feet (12 meters) below the surface, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.


A 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home southwest of Gainesville, Florida, according to the Levy County Sheriff’s Office. In Dixie County, just east of where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy died in a car crash on wet roads Sunday night.


In south Georgia, a 19-year-old man died Monday afternoon when a large tree fell onto a porch at a home in Moultrie, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.


More than 140,000 customers remained without power in Florida and Georgia on Tuesday morning, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp. Nearly 12,000 more were without power in South Carolina early Tuesday. 


More than 1,600 flights were also canceled nationwide on Monday and more than 550 flights were canceled early Tuesday, many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com.


President Joe Biden approved a request from South Carolina’s governor for an emergency declaration, following his earlier approval of a similar request from Florida. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said he has asked Biden to issue a preemptive federal emergency declaration to speed the flow of federal aid to the state.


Vice President Kamala Harris postponed a campaign stop scheduled for Thursday in Savannah.


North Carolina is also under a state of emergency after Gov. Roy Cooper declared it in an executive order signed Monday. Several areas along the state’s coastline are prone to flooding, such as Wilmington and the Outer Banks, according to the North Carolina Floodplain Mapping Program.


North Carolina and South Carolina have dealt with three catastrophic floods from tropical systems in the past nine years, all causing more than $1 billion in damage.


In 2015, rainfall fed by moisture as Hurricane Joaquin passed well offshore caused massive flooding. In 2016, flooding from Hurricane Matthew caused 24 deaths in the two states and rivers set record crests. Those records were broken in 2018 with Hurricane Florence, which set rainfall records in both Carolinas, flooded many of the same places and was responsible for 42 deaths in North Carolina and nine in South Carolina.

## MAGA World Loves a Cybertruck

	By now, there’s a decent chance that you’ve seen a Cybertruck out in the wild — perhaps <a href="https://transalt.org/blog/daylighting" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>blocking the visibility at an intersection</u></a> or surrounded by gawkers in the <a href="https://x.com/PopCrave/status/1758492688746192964?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1758492688746192964%7Ctwgr%5E3795b9483f8c71cd14e09f3f32b9d902780e93f7%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ffuturism.com%2Fthe-byte%2Flady-gaga-grocery-store-tesla-cybertruck" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Whole Foods parking lot</u></a>. And upon seeing it, I’ll bet you had precisely one question:
</p><p>
<em><em>How does a Cybertruck function in rural Maine?</em></em>
</p><p>
	Tucker Carlson is on the case. On Monday, the <em><em>Tucker on X</em></em> host posted an hour-long video to determine whether a “man with a real job” could replace his F-350 with a Cybertruck. I’ll be honest: Out of respect for my time and sanity, I did not actually watch <a href="https://x.com/TuckerCarlson/status/1820505150244413449" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the entire thing</u></a>. But within the first three minutes, Carlson’s interview subject — a guy who’d been loaned a Cybertruck for all of five days — confirmed that he could swap out his Ford for a Tesla with a resounding “so far, yes.”
</p><p>
	It was not the only unexpected Cybertruck endorsement of Monday, however. On the other end of the Eastern Seaboard, at Mar-a-Lago, Donald Trump appeared in his own (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/05/us/harris-trump-election/28b2cf31-0b30-5a9d-8508-97fe1bc2c2d9?smid=url-share" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>also quite long</u></a>) video with a far-right personality, the <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-adin-ross-stream-jake-paul-gen-z.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>gamer Adin Ross</u></a>. Over an hour into the livestream, Ross presented the former president with a custom Cybertruck featuring a red, white, and blue “Make America Great Again” wrap and the picture of Trump lifting his fist in the air after the attempt on his life in Pennsylvania emblazoned on its side. (In addition to <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/adin-ross-trump-rolex-cybertruck-interview-1235074316/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>possibly committing a campaign finance violation</u></a>, the pair also inadvertently proved that the only thing more outré than owning a Cybertruck is owning a Cybertruck <em><em>with your own face on it</em></em>.)

	For anyone who has followed <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-electric-vehicles-fact-check" target="_self"><u>the Republican Party’s stance on EVs</u></a>, the fact that an all-electric truck is now apparently being used to own the libs might cause your head to explode. But on the other hand: <em><em>Of course it is</em></em>. While the far right has for years pushed the idea that EVs are <a href="https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/pete-buttigieg-marjorie-greene-electric-cars-b2196087.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>somehow emasculating</u></a>, Tesla designed the Cybertruck to be just the opposite. It’s such a <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/tech/article/drew-magary-cybertruck-review-sf-19561381.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>conspicuously masculine status symbol</u></a> that it provoked an anthropologist to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/22/style/elon-musk-tesla-cybertruck.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>wonder</u></a> to <em><em>The New York Times</em></em> whether “I’ll ever see a nice lady driving this kind of car.” The right’s change of heart on EVs (or at least one EV) has also coincided <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/trump-ev-pivot-elon-musk" target="_self"><u>neatly</u></a> with Elon Musk’s announcement of a <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/trump-ev-pivot-elon-musk" target="_self"><u>new conservative super PAC</u></a>. (Musk is credited as the supplier of the loaner vehicle in Carlson’s video.)
</p><p>
	But is it possible the right’s embrace of the Cybertruck could have benefits beyond giving us amusing, if extremely long videos? The upside, of course, is that the planet would be much better off if every person who’d ever bought a gas-guzzling truck to project an image of “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/11/01/pickup-trucks-men-masculinity-rural-symbols/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>rural culture and manhood</u></a>” had decided to get an EV instead. Removing political and cultural barriers to EVs <em><em>as a whole </em></em>is certainly something to celebrate, even while <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/trump-ev-pivot-elon-musk#:~:text=Tesla%20shares%20popped%204%25%20after%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20most%20recent%20comments%2C%20and%20the%20company%20is%20now%20big%20enough%20not%20to%20need%20the%20government%20subsidies%20that%20Trump%20would%20inevitably%20roll%20back.%20(Of%20course%2C%20it%E2%80%99s%20a%20different%20story%20for%20Tesla%E2%80%99s%20rivals.)" target="_self"><u>the exact motivations remain suspect</u></a>.
</p><p>
	And hey, I won’t turn my nose up at more fast chargers in rural Maine.

## Japanese stocks rebound

date: 2024-08-06, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> After a dramatic 12% drop yesterday, Japanese stocks have rebounded — with the Nikkei 225 finishing more than 10% higher at the close of trading. Then, following weeks of unrest in Bangladesh and the resignation of its prime minster, the IMF says it&#8217;s committed to the country&#8217;s economic stability. And we&#8217;ll hear about a scam targeting Chinese people around the world, in which criminals pretend to be Chinese police.</p>

The Carbon Removal Standards Initiative wants to help establish a different system for advancing carbon removal — one where the challenging but important goal of scrubbing CO2 from the atmosphere is treated as a public good and not just a business opportunity.

Rivian to report Q2 earnings</h3><p>EV startup Rivian reports Q2 earnings today, after months of cost-cutting measures in its quest for profitability. We already know the company delivered nearly 13,800 vehicles, which was a slight improvement on Q1 but down from Q4 of last year. Wall Street analysts <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/08/05/rivian-rivn-release-critical-q2-earnings/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8fa5_ruONXw2JDTqGhVbtzSq8oc37P6Gg3SxFy48XmhDkKiQEjO_roGymfRQqCLdH6BsYj" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">expect</a> revenue to have hit $1.15 billion, with losses of about $1.24 per share. CEO RJ Scaringe has cautioned investors that this quarter will be “messy” but hopes they’ll hang in there until efficiency upgrades to the manufacturing process start to pay off in the company balance sheets. Last month Rivian announced a $5 billion joint venture with Volkswagen that boosted its stock. The startup is working on its next-gen R2 and R3 vehicles, which are “expected to significantly expand its market,” <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/07/02/rivian-rivn-deliveries-flat-q2-ramp-up-h2-2024/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8fa5_ruONXw2JDTqGhVbtzSq8oc37P6Gg3SxFy48XmhDkKiQEjO_roGymfRQqCLdH6BsYj" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> Peter Johnson at <em><em>Electrek</em></em>.

Why? “Because Elon endorsed me very strongly.” He’s referring, of course, to Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who has backed Trump’s campaign. The two men have <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/donald-trump-elon-musk-alliance-d1fe43e3?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8fa5_ruONXw2JDTqGhVbtzSq8oc37P6Gg3SxFy48XmhDkKiQEjO_roGymfRQqCLdH6BsYj" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reportedly</a> been speaking on the phone lately and despite Trump’s long history of trashing EVs, he seems to have changed his mind. Trump told the rally crowd EVs would make up a “small slice” of the auto industry and that “every kind of car” would be available. Trump’s concession “already feels very much like quid-pro-quo for the support of the world’s richest man,” <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/729056/trump-evs-musk-endorsements-choice/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8fa5_ruONXw2JDTqGhVbtzSq8oc37P6Gg3SxFy48XmhDkKiQEjO_roGymfRQqCLdH6BsYj" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> Rob Stumpf at <em><em>Inside EVs</em></em>.</p><h3>5. Bezos Earth Fund puts $9.4 million toward cow methane vaccine research</h3><p>The Bezos Earth Fund is pouring <a href="https://www.bezosearthfund.org/news-and-insights/pioneering-cattle-methane-vaccine-project-launched-by-bezos-earth-fund?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8fa5_ruONXw2JDTqGhVbtzSq8oc37P6Gg3SxFy48XmhDkKiQEjO_roGymfRQqCLdH6BsYj" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$9.4 million</a> into researching whether a vaccine could be given to cows to cut their methane emissions. The funding will go to the Pirbright Institute and the Royal Veterinary College, which will “use state-of-the-art biotechnology to figure out the mechanism by which a vaccine could cut livestock methane emissions by more than 30%.” Microbes in the guts of cattle produce methane, which the cows burp out. Methane is a greenhouse gas more potent than carbon dioxide that many see as a good target for limiting global warming in the short term. There are a lot of ongoing efforts to curb agricultural methane emissions – from feed additives to better ranch management – but “a vaccine offers a universal solution which is both scalable and cost effective,” the fund said.</p><h2>THE KICKER</h2><p>Morgan Stanley yesterday released its <a href="https://uk.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/morgan-stanley-survey-teslas-popularity-is-waning-3632875?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8fa5_ruONXw2JDTqGhVbtzSq8oc37P6Gg3SxFy48XmhDkKiQEjO_roGymfRQqCLdH6BsYj" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">annual intern survey</a>, which examines the likes and dislikes of nearly 600 of the company’s summer interns to reveal the evolving preferences of future business leaders. It finds that Tesla is now less popular than Mercedes and BMW, and gas-powered cars are favored over EVs nearly 2-to-1.</p>

## Toward a More Perfect Carbon Removal Standard

date: 2024-08-06, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzA0OTA4MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcyNTE0NDkzMn0.6vCg7sjA1BEqqvbm6lWNgI6ee88bwP4JmOre9uRo07A/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">There’s a new player in carbon removal. It’s not another startup building machines to suck carbon from the air. And it’s not another trade association or consulting firm or marketplace peddling carbon removal credits. Instead, it wants to help establish a different system for advancing carbon removal — one where the challenging but important goal of scrubbing CO2 from the atmosphere is treated as a public good and not just a business opportunity.</p><p>It’s called the Carbon Removal Standards Initiative, and it’s run by Anu Khan, the former deputy director of science and innovation at Carbon180. CRSI (pronounced like the Lannister queen in <em>Game of Thrones</em>, “Cersei”) is a “financially unconflicted, independent nonprofit,” that will provide technical assistance to policymakers, regulators, and nongovernmental organizations in quantifying carbon removal outcomes. </p><p>A group providing technical assistance may not sound like a revolutionary development. But Khan hopes CRSI will be a fulcrum around which the entire industry can begin to pivot.</p><p>Today’s carbon removal industry is built on selling credits, each of which is supposed to represent one ton of CO2 pulled out of the atmosphere. But the market is almost entirely self-regulated. The standards for measuring and reporting how much carbon a given project is removing have either been developed by the carbon credit registries that take a cut of the sales or by the developers themselves — in both cases a conflict of interest, even if governed by the best of intentions. Plus, there’s a <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/10.1080/14693062.2022.2094308" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>multitude of standards</u></a> for every type of project, and they vary in quality. </p><p>Take carbon farming, for example. If a farmer alters their practices to increase the carbon stored in their soil, they can choose from more than a dozen standards to quantify the effects. In theory, the standards all produce an identical product — a fungible carbon credit equivalent to one ton of carbon removed from the atmosphere. In reality, they <a href="https://carbonplan.org/research/soil-protocols-explainer" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>vary widely in quality</u></a>, with some standards producing more accurate results than others. </p><p>In watching this environment develop over the past several years, I’ve often wondered if some independent, unbiased entity might eventually step forward to enact one set of standards to rule them all. Khan told me that about a year and a half ago, she had the same thought. “Oh, to be so young,” she said. </p><p>At the time, there was growing concern that the carbon removal industry would suffer from the same credibility issues that plagued the wider market for carbon credits. “You have a multiplicity of these verification entities driven by profit motives, some of which have very loose standards,” Wil Burns, the co-executive director of the Institute for Carbon Removal Law and Policy at American University, told me. “From the standpoint of those purchasing credits or those viewing whether companies are doing anything meaningful, nobody can really distinguish.”</p><p>In early 2023, dozens of carbon removal suppliers, buyers, verifiers, academics, and nonprofit staff — including Khan — signed an <a href="https://files.carbonplan.org/CDR-MRV-Standards-Letter-02-10-2023.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>open letter</u></a> that now reads like an early draft of CRSI’s missions statement. It called for the creation of “an independent, not-for-profit initiative that conscientiously avoids conflicts of interest and has funding that does not depend on issuing or selling carbon credits.” This new body would “provide a trusted, scientific stamp of approval for CDR protocols through an inclusive process to identify scientific consensus.”</p><p>The letter focused on the issues with measuring carbon removal in the context of the voluntary sale of carbon credits. But over the next year, it became clear to Khan that carbon removal won’t reach the scale necessary to make a dent in climate change without government policy. “Even the market enthusiasts recognize that we’re going to need policy as quickly as possible to shore this up,” she said, “and it’s going to be policy, long term, that gets us to gigaton scale.” </p><p>So instead of providing “a trusted, scientific stamp of approval” to private businesses, CRSI is laser focused on working with policymakers. It’s not entirely clear yet what that will look like, and it’s likely to evolve as CRSI finds its footing. But the group is launching with a few projects that are already underway. It has created a database of “quantification resources,” which is basically a list of all of the methodologies published by companies, academics, government agencies, and international standards organizations, for measuring different kinds of carbon removal. It also has a database of carbon removal policies, both those enacted and proposed. Eventually, Khan plans to have them link out to each other, so you can see which standards underpin which policies.</p><p>Khan wants CRSI to be a go-to resource for policymakers and agency staff to ensure that carbon removal programs actually result in climate benefits. “We are fundamentally a mission organization,” she told me. “We believe that carbon removal is a tool for climate justice. Justice requires accountability, and in carbon removal, that means knowing how to count the carbon. We want to make sure that if we're putting public dollars into these policies, that they are backed by the ability to actually measure the carbon.”</p><p>Khan isn’t the only one whose thinking on standards has shifted toward a government-led approach. Burns, who also signed the letter, told me he’s seeing more carbon removal companies pushing for a compliance market, where the government requires polluting businesses to buy carbon removal. “They would like to both have government standards that would provide more confidence, for example, to investors,” he said, “and they would like government mandates that generate more demand.”</p><p>Freya Chay is the program lead at the nonprofit Carbon Plan, which spearheaded the letter. She told me many in the industry are now thinking about carbon removal programs that don’t revolve around selling credits at all, and therefore may have very different measurement and verification needs.</p><p>One of CRSI’s first projects is an illustrative example. Imagine if the Department of Agriculture developed a program to help farmers restore the pH of soils that have gotten too acidic, by adding basalt — a mineral that also happens to capture CO2 from the atmosphere as it dissolves. Today, carbon removal companies that sell carbon credits based on this process are taking hundreds of soil samples to measure the outcomes. The USDA likely wouldn’t need that level of precision — the captured CO2 is a co-benefit, not the entire point of the program — but “at some point you probably do want to know if you removed carbon through this policy,” said Khan. CRSI is working on <a href="https://www.carbonremovalstandards.org/jurisdiction-level-monitoring-of-enhanced-weathering" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>figuring out how you would do that</u></a>.</p><p>Similarly, we might see the development of building codes that encourage the use of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/concrete-traps-co2-soaked-air-climate-friendly-test-2023-02-03/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>concrete cured with CO2</u></a> from the atmosphere, or waste management regulations that govern the <a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/vaulted-deep-carbon-removal" target="_self"><u>injection of carbon-rich organic waste</u></a> into underground storage wells. Bigger picture, the U.S. will eventually have to measure and report how much carbon removal it’s doing across all of these little programs as part of its obligation under the Paris Agreement. </p><p>In many of these cases, those setting the rules won’t be experts in carbon removal science. “They’re going to need technical expertise,” said Khan. “We want to make sure that when they are doing that work, they have access to all of the relevant information, and that it’s organized in a way that’s legible for the expertise that they already have.”</p><p>Shuchi Talati, the former chief of staff in the office of fossil energy and carbon management at the Department of Energy, told me that having this kind of centralized resource would definitely have been useful. “The private sector has a lot of power right now in setting standards because the public sector doesn’t have the capacity,” she said. And since the field is so diverse, efforts are spread across a bunch of different agencies that don’t always talk to each other. Talati sits on the board of CRSI, and for her, the focus on government is not just about helping carbon removal scale.</p><p>“If we’re allowing the private sector to set standards and norms — and maybe they’re fine right now — but if we continue to let that happen, I can see the actual climate benefit of CDR slipping away,” Talati said. “That’s really where I see Anu’s organization fit in, where we are trying to set standards and norms from this core, foundational principle of a public good.”</p>

## Kamala Harris is now Democratic presidential nominee

date: 2024-08-06, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Vice President Kamala Harris, a daughter of immigrants who rose through the California political and law enforcement ranks to become the first female vice president in U.S. history, formally secured the Democratic presidential nomination on Monday — becoming the first woman of color to lead a major party ticket.


More than four years after her first attempt at the presidency collapsed, Harris' coronation as her party's standard-bearer caps a tumultuous and frenetic period for Democrats prompted by President Joe Biden's disastrous June debate performance that shattered his own supporters' confidence in his reelection prospects and spurred extraordinary intraparty warfare about whether he should stay in the race.


Just as soon as Biden abruptly ended his candidacy, Harris and her team worked rapidly to secure backing from the 1,976 party delegates needed to clinch the nomination in a formal roll call vote. She reached that marker at warp speed, with an Associated Press survey of delegates nationwide showing she locked down the necessary commitments a mere 32 hours after Biden's announcement.


Harris' nomination became official after a five-day round of online balloting by Democratic National Convention delegates ended Monday night, with the party saying in a statement released just before midnight that 99% of delegates had cast their ballots for Harris. The party had long contemplated the early virtual roll call to ensure Biden would appear on the ballot in every state. It said it would next formally certify the vote before holding a celebratory roll call at the party's convention later this month in Chicago.


An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll conducted after Biden withdrew found 46% of Americans have a favorable view of Harris, while a nearly identical share has an unfavorable view of her. But more Democrats say they are satisfied with her candidacy compared with that of Biden, energizing a party that had long been resigned to the 81-year-old Biden being its nominee against former President Donald Trump, a Republican they view as an existential threat.


Already Harris has telegraphed that she doesn't plan to veer much from the themes and policies that framed Biden's candidacy, such as democracy, gun violence prevention and abortion rights. But her delivery can be far fierier, particularly when she invokes her prosecutorial background to lambast Trump and his 34 felony convictions for falsifying business records in connection with a hush money scheme.


"Given that unique voice of a new generation, of a prosecutor and a woman when fundamental rights, especially reproductive rights, are on the line, it's almost as if the stars have aligned for her at this moment in history," said Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla of California, who was tapped to succeed Harris in the Senate when she became vice president.


A splash in Washington before a collapse in the 2020 primaries


Kamala Devi Harris was born Oct. 20, 1964, in Oakland, California, to Shyamala Gopalan, a breast cancer scientist who emigrated to the United States from India when she was 19 years old, and Stanford University emeritus professor Donald Harris, a naturalized U.S. citizen originally from Jamaica. Her parents' advocacy for civil rights gave her what she described as a "stroller's-eye view" of the movement.


She spent years as a prosecutor in the Bay Area before her elevation as the state's attorney general in 2010 and then election as U.S. senator in 2016.


Harris arrived in Washington as a senator at the dawn of the volatile Trump era, quickly establishing herself as a reliable liberal opponent of the new president's personnel and policies and fanning speculation about a presidential bid of her own. Securing a spot on the coveted Judiciary Committee gave her a national spotlight to interrogate prominent Trump nominees, such as now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.


"I'm not able to be rushed this fast," then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions said during a 2017 hearing as Harris repeatedly pressed him on potential conversations with Russian nationals. "It makes me nervous."


Harris launched her 2020 presidential campaign with much promise, drawing parallels to former President Barack Obama and attracting more than 20,000 people to a kickoff rally in her hometown. But Harris withdrew from the primary race before the first nominating contest in Iowa, plagued by staff dissent that spilled out into the open and an inability to attract enough campaign cash.


Harris struggled to deliver a consistent pitch to Democratic voters and wobbled on key issues such as health care. She suggested she backed eliminating private insurance for a full government-run system — "Medicare for All" coverage — before releasing her own health care plan that preserved private insurance. Now, during her nascent general election campaign, Harris has already reversed some of her earlier, more liberal positions, such as a ban on fracking that she endorsed in 2019.


And while Harris tried to deploy her law enforcement background as an asset in her 2020 presidential campaign, it never attracted enough support in a party that couldn't reconcile some of her past tough-on-crime positions at a time of heightened focus on police brutality.


Joining Biden's team — and an evolution as vice president


Still, Harris was at the top of the vice presidential shortlist when Biden was pondering his running mate, after his pledge in early 2020 that he would choose a Black woman as his No. 2. He was fond of Harris, who had forged a close friendship with his now-deceased son Beau, who had been Delaware's attorney general when she was in that job for California.


Her first months as vice president were far from smooth. Biden asked her to lead the administration's diplomatic efforts with Central America on the root causes of migration to the United States, which triggered attacks from Republicans on border security and remains a political vulnerability. It didn't help matters that Harris stumbled in big interviews, such as in a 2021 sit-down with NBC News' Lester Holt when she responded dismissively that "I haven't been to Europe" when the anchor noted that she hadn't visited the U.S.-Mexico border.


For her first two years, Harris also was often tethered to Washington so she could break tie votes in the evenly divided Senate, which gave Democrats landmark wins on the climate and health care but also constrained opportunities for her to travel around the country and meet voters.


Her visibility became far more prominent after the 2022 Supreme Court ruling that dismantled Roe v. Wade, as she became the chief spokesperson for the administration on abortion rights and was a more natural messenger than Biden, a lifelong Catholic who had in the past favored restrictions on the procedure. She is the first vice president to tour an abortion clinic and speaks about reproductive rights in the broader context of maternal health, especially for Black women.


Throughout her vice presidency, Harris has been careful to remain loyal to Biden while emphasizing that she would be ready to step in if needed. That dramatic transition began in late June after the first debate between Biden and Trump, where the president's stumbles were so cataclysmic that he could never reverse the loss of confidence from other Democrats.


Headed to the top of the ticket


After Biden ended his candidacy July 21, he quickly endorsed Harris. And during the first two weeks of her 2024 presidential bid, enthusiasm among the Democratic base surged, with donations pouring in, scores of volunteers showing up at field offices and supporters swelling so much in numbers that event organizers have had to swap venues.


The Harris campaign now believes it has a renewed opportunity to compete in Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina and Georgia — states that Biden had started to abandon in favor of shoring up the so-called "blue wall" states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.


"The country is able to see the Kamala Harris that we all know," said Bakari Sellers, who was a national co-chair of her 2020 campaign. "We really didn't allow the country to see her" four years ago. Sellers said: "We had her in bubble wrap. What people are seeing now is that she's real, she's talented."


Yet Democrats are anticipating that Harris' political honeymoon will wear off, and she is inevitably going to come under tougher scrutiny for Biden administration positions, the state of the economy and volatile situations abroad, particularly in the Middle East. Harris has also yet to answer extended questions from journalists nor sit down for a formal interview since she began her run.


The Trump campaign has been eager to define Harris as she continues to introduce herself to voters nationwide, releasing an ad blaming her for the high number of illegal crossings at the southern border during the Biden administration and dubbing her "Failed. Weak. Dangerously liberal."


The Republican nominee's supporters have also derisively branded Harris as a diversity hire, while Trump himself has engaged in ugly racial attacks of his own, wrongly asserting that Harris had in the past only promoted her Indian heritage and only recently played up her Black identity.


His remarks are previewing a season of racist and sexist claims against the person who would be the first woman and the first person of South Asian heritage in the presidency.


"I didn't know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black and now she wants to be known as Black," Trump said while addressing the annual convention of the National Association of Black Journalists. "So, I don't know, is she Indian or is she Black?"


In her response, Harris called it "the same old show — the divisiveness and the disrespect" and said voters "deserve better."


"The American people deserve a leader who tells the truth, a leader who does not respond with hostility and anger when confronted with the facts," Harris said at a Sigma Gamma Rho sorority gathering in Houston. "We deserve a leader who understands that our differences do not divide us."

## Ex-Trump attorney to cooperate in Arizona fake electors case, charges to be dropped

date: 2024-08-06, from: VOA News USA

phoenix — Former President Donald Trump's campaign attorney Jenna Ellis, who worked closely with Rudy Giuliani, will cooperate with Arizona prosecutors in exchange for charges being dropped against her in a fake electors case, the state attorney general's office announced Monday.


Ellis has previously pleaded not guilty to fraud, forgery and conspiracy charges in the Arizona case. Seventeen other people charged in the case have pleaded not guilty to the felony charges — including Giuliani, Trump presidential chief of staff Mark Meadows and 11 Republicans who submitted a document to Congress falsely declaring Trump had won Arizona.


"Her insights are invaluable and will greatly aid the State in proving its case in court," Attorney General Kris Mayes said in a statement. "As I stated when the initial charges were announced, I will not allow American democracy to be undermined — it is far too important. Today's announcement is a win for the rule of law."


Last year, Ellis was charged in Georgia after she appeared with Giuliani at a December 2020 hearing hosted by state Republican lawmakers at the Georgia Capitol during which false allegations of election fraud were made. She had pleaded guilty in October to one felony count of aiding and abetting false statements and writings. The cooperation agreement signed by Ellis in the Arizona case requires her to provide truthful information to the Attorney General's Office and testify honestly in proceedings in any state or federal court. Prosecutors can withdraw from the deal and refile charges if Ellis violates the agreement.


Prosecutors have already asked a court to dismiss the Arizona charges against Ellis. It wasn't immediately clear if a judge had yet approved the request.


The Associated Press left messages with Ellis' attorney, Matthew Brown, after the agreement was announced Monday.


While not a fake elector in Arizona, prosecutors say Ellis made false claims of widespread election fraud in the state and six others, encouraged the Arizona Legislature to change the outcome of the election and encouraged then-Vice President Mike Pence to accept Arizona's fake elector votes.


The indictment said Ellis, Giuliani and other associates were at a meeting at the Arizona Legislature on Dec. 1, 2020, with then-House Speaker Rusty Bowers and other Republicans when Giuliani and his team asked the speaker to hold a committee hearing on the election.


When Bowers asked for proof of election fraud, Giuliani said he had proof but Ellis had advised that it was left back at a hotel room, the indictment said. No proof was provided to Bowers.


Ellis also is barred from practicing law in Colorado for three years after her guilty plea in Georgia.


Prosecutors in Michigan, Nevada, Georgia and Wisconsin have also filed criminal charges related to the fake electors scheme.


Arizona authorities unveiled the felony charges in late April. Overall, charges were brought against 11 Republicans who submitted a document to Congress falsely declaring Trump had won Arizona, five lawyers connected to the former president and two former Trump aides. President Joe Biden won Arizona by 10,457 votes.


Trump himself was not charged in the Arizona case but was referred to as an unindicted co-conspirator in the indictment.


The 11 people who claimed to be Arizona's Republican electors met in Phoenix on Dec. 14, 2020, to sign a certificate saying they were "duly elected and qualified" electors and asserting that Trump carried the state. A one-minute video of the signing ceremony was posted on social media by the Arizona Republican Party at the time. The document was later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored.

## Biden aims to defuse Mideast tensions

date: 2024-08-06, from: VOA News USA

THE WHITE HOUSE — U.S. President Joe Biden met with his national security team Monday and spoke with Jordan's king to defuse heightened tensions in the Middle East after a pair of high-profile assassinations last week.


Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, meanwhile, warned Israel would exact a "heavy price" if attacked by Iran or its proxies in the region.


The White House said over the weekend that it was committed to a hostage-release and cease-fire deal that had so far been elusive — but emphasized that Washington stood ready to respond and had surged military resources to the region.




"We still believe a cease-fire deal is the best way to bring this war to an end," John Kirby, White House national security spokesman, said. "It's also, we believe, very possible. We still believe the gaps are narrow enough to close. The other thing that we've been doing since the 7th of October is making sure that not only Israel has what it needs to defend itself, but that this war doesn't escalate to become something broader."


Analysts say this is a tense moment.


"I think one of the reasons that this is also scary, to be honest, for everybody, is that it isn't clear what the United States can do when we're on the brink like this," said Natasha Hall, a senior fellow with the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.


Advocates for the American Muslim community, which has criticized Biden's staunch support for Israel, say Washington should take a firm line on Israel's aggression in Gaza.


"The United States possesses a wide array of diplomatic and political tools to hold Israel accountable, whether that's withholding aid, ammunition, weapons, political support or sanctioning more of Israel's far-right settlers that have been engaged in violence," said Robert McCaw, Government Affairs Department director at the Council on American-Islamic Relations.


Netanyahu said Israel is ready to meet challenges.


"Iran and its proxies seek to surround us with a stranglehold of terror on seven fronts," he said. "Their visible aggression is insatiable, but Israel is not helpless. We are determined to stand against them on every front, in every arena, far and near. Anyone who murders our citizens, anyone who harms our country, will be held accountable. He will pay a very heavy price."


Jordan Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi recently paid a rare visit to Tehran, and Biden on Monday spoke to Jordan's King Abdullah II about de-escalating tensions in the region.


Hall says diplomacy may be the best way forward.


"What he [Safadi] wanted to do was play essentially a mediating role in much the same way that Qatar has been doing in recent months," she said. "Just speak to Iran, try to address their concerns, but also to be essentially a conduit for the United States to ensure that there's some kind of open channel during these particularly scary times.


“And I think that that is more necessary than ever before, since the United States does not directly speak to high-ranking Iranian officials. And so, they are depending on these kinds of regional mediators, probably more so than ever before,” Hall said.


So, with nearly 40,000 people dead, Gaza in ruins, and Lebanon and Iran on high alert, the world is waiting to see what happens next.


A reporter asked Biden about one of the key players in the conflict as he left church on Sunday.


"Do you think Iran will stand down, sir?" the reporter said.


"I hope so," Biden replied. "I don't know."

## Dow drops 1,000 points; Japanese stocks plunge as markets quake worldwide

date: 2024-08-06, from: VOA News USA

new york — A scary Monday that started with a plunge abroad reminiscent of 1987’s crash swept around the world and pummeled Wall Street with more steep losses, as fears worsened about a slowing U.S. economy.


The S&P 500 dropped 3% for its worst day in nearly two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average reeled by 1,033 points, or 2.6%, while the Nasdaq composite slid 3.4% as Apple, Nvidia and other Big Tech companies that used to be the stars of the stock market continued to wilt.


The drops were the latest in a global sell-off that began last week. Japan’s Nikkei 225 helped begin Monday by plunging 12.4% for its worst day since the Black Monday crash of 1987.


It was the first chance for traders in Tokyo to react to Friday’s report showing U.S. employers slowed their hiring last month by much more than economists expected. That was the latest piece of data on the U.S. economy to come in weaker than expected, and it’s all raised fear the Federal Reserve has pressed the brakes on the U.S. economy by too much for too long through high interest rates in hopes of stifling inflation.


Professional investors cautioned that some technical factors could be amplifying the action in markets, and that the drops may be overdone, but the losses were still neck-snapping. South Korea’s Kospi index careened 8.8% lower, and bitcoin dropped below $54,000 from more than $61,000 on Friday.


Even gold, which has a reputation for offering safety during tumultuous times, slipped about 1%.


That’s in part because traders began wondering if the damage has been so severe that the Federal Reserve will have to cut interest rates in an emergency meeting, before its next scheduled decision on Sept. 18. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which closely tracks expectations for the Fed, briefly sank below 3.70% during the morning from 3.88% late Friday and from 5% in April. It later recovered and pulled back to 3.89%.


“The Fed could ride in on a white horse to save the day with a big rate cut, but the case for an inter-meeting cut seems flimsy,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. “Those are usually reserved for emergencies, like COVID, and an unemployment rate of 4.3% doesn’t really seem like an emergency.”


Of course, the U.S. economy is still growing, the U.S. stock market is still up a healthy amount for the year and a recession is far from a certainty. The Fed has been clear about the tightrope it began walking when it started hiking rates sharply in March 2022: Being too aggressive would choke the economy, but going too soft would give inflation more oxygen and hurt everyone.


Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle sees a higher chance of a recession within the next 12 months following Friday’s jobs report. But he still sees only a 25% probability of that, up from 15%, in part “because the data look fine overall” and he does not “see major financial imbalances.”


Some of Wall Street’s recent declines may simply be air coming out of a stock market that romped to dozens of all-time highs this year, in part on a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology.


“Markets tend to move higher like they’re climbing stairs, and they go down like they’re falling out a window,” according to JJ Kinahan, CEO of IG North America. He chalks much of the recent worries to euphoria around AI subsiding, with pressure rising on companies to show how AI is turning into profits, and “a market that was ahead of itself.”


Treasury yields also pared their losses Monday after a report said growth for U.S. services businesses was a touch stronger than expected. Growth was led by arts, entertainment and recreation businesses, along with accommodations and food services, according to the Institute for Supply Management.


Still, stocks of companies whose profits are most closely tied to the economy’s strength took sharp losses on the fears about a slowdown. The small companies in the Russell 2000 index dropped 3.3%, washing out what had been a revival for it and other beaten-down areas of the market.


Making things worse for Wall Street, Big Tech stocks tumbled as the market’s most popular trade for much of this year continued to unravel. Apple, Nvidia and a handful of other Big Tech stocks known as the “Magnificent Seven” had propelled the S&P 500 to record after record this year, even as high interest rates weighed down much of the rest of the stock market.


But Big Tech’s momentum turned last month on worries investors had taken their prices too high and expectations for future growth are becoming too difficult to meet. A set of underwhelming profit reports that began with updates from Tesla and Alphabet added to the pessimism and accelerated the declines.


All told, the S&P 500 fell 160.23 points to 5,186.33. The Dow sank 1,033.99 to 38,703.27, and the Nasdaq composite tumbled 576.08 to 16,200.08.

## Chinese businesses hoping to expand in US face uncertainty, suspicion

date: 2024-08-06, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — It was billed as the “biggest ever economic development project” in north Michigan when Governor Gretchen Whitmer in 2022 welcomed a Chinese lithium-ion battery company’s plan to build a $2.36 billion factory and bring a couple thousand jobs to Big Rapids. 


Now the project by Gotion High-Tech is in the crosshairs of some U.S. lawmakers and residents. 


Leading the charge is Republican Representative John Moolenaar of Michigan, chairman of the House Select Committee on China, who accuses the Chinese company of having ties to forced labor and says he fears it could spy for Beijing and work to extend China's influence in the U.S. heartland. Gotion rejects the accusations. 




“I want to see this area have more jobs and investments, but we must not welcome companies that are controlled by people who see us as the enemy and we should not allow them to build here,” Moolenaar said at a recent roundtable discussion in Michigan. 


Lured by the large U.S. market, Chinese businesses are coming to the United States with money, jobs and technology, only to find rising suspicion at a time of an intensifying U.S.-China rivalry that has spread into the business world. 


U.S. wariness of China, coupled with Beijing's desire to protect its technological competitiveness, threatens to rupture ties between the world's two largest economies. That could hurt businesses, workers and consumers, which some warn could undermine the economic foundation that has helped stabilize relations. 


“This is a lose-lose scenario for the two countries,” Zhiqun Zhu, professor of political science and international relations at Bucknell University, said in an email. “The main reason is U.S.-China rivalry, and the U.S. government prioritizes ‘national security’ over economic interests in dealing with China.” 


Lizhi Liu, an assistant professor of business at Georgetown University, said the trend, along with the decline of U.S. investments in China, could hurt China-U.S. relations. 


“Strong investment ties between the two nations are crucial not only for economic reasons but also for security, as intertwined economic interests reduce the likelihood of major conflicts or even war,” she said. 


But U.S. lawmakers believe the stakes are high. Senator Marco Rubio said at a July hearing that China is not only a military and diplomatic adversary for the U.S. but also a “technological, industrial and commercial” opponent. 




“The technological and industrial high ground has always been a precursor of global power,” said Rubio, a Republican from Florida.  


The bipartisan House Select Committee on China has warned that widespread adoption in the U.S. of technologies developed by China could threaten long-term U.S. technological competitiveness. 


U.S. public sentiment against Chinese investments began to build during President Barack Obama's administration, in a pushback against globalization, and were amplified after President Donald Trump came into office, said Yilang Feng, an assistant professor of business at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, who studies economic nationalism and resistance to foreign direct investments in the U.S. 


“The scale has increased, so has the intensity,” Feng said. 


As President Joe Biden's administration seeks to revive American manufacturing and boost U.S. technological capabilities, many politicians believe Chinese companies should be kept out. 


“Can you imagine working for an American company working tirelessly to develop battery technology and then you find out that your tax dollars are being used to subsidize a competitor from China?” Moolenaar said as he campaigned against the Gotion project in his congressional district in a state that is critical in the presidential election. 


Whitmer's office has declined to comment on the project. The Michigan Economic Development Corporation told The Associated Press it has received “bipartisan support at all levels” to move forward with the project, which will create up to 2,350 jobs. 




Residents of Green Charter Township, however, revolted against the project over its Chinese connections last year when they removed five officials who supported it in a recall election. 


In Worcester, Massachusetts, the Chinese biotech company WuXi Biologics paused construction of a large facility a few weeks after lawmakers introduced a bill that would, over data security concerns, ban U.S. entities receiving federal funds from doing business with several China-linked companies, WuXi Biologics included. 


John Ling, who has helped South Carolina and Georgia attract Chinese businesses for nearly two decades, said geopolitics have been getting in the way in recent years. Chinese companies are less likely to consider South Carolina after the state senate last year approved a bill banning Chinese citizens from buying property, even though the bill has yet to clear the statehouse, Ling said. 


Data by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis show the total investments by China in the U.S. fell to just under $44 billion in 2023, from a high point of $63 billion in 2017, although first-year expenditures rose to $621 million in 2023, up from $531 million in 2022 but drastically down from the high of $27 billion in 2016. The figures include acquisitions, new business establishments and expansions. 


In 2022, Michigan beat out several other states in luring Gotion. Keen to revive its manufacturing base, the state offered a package of incentives, including $175 million in grants and the approval of a new zone that could save the company $540 million. Local townships approved tax abatements for Gotion to build a factory to make components for electrical vehicle batteries. 


In Green Charter Township, the new board dropped support for the project and rescinded an agreement to extend water to the factory site, only to be rebuked by a U.S. district judge. 


The future of the plant remains uncertain, as Moolenaar is rallying support for his bill that would prevent Gotion from receiving federal subsidies. He accuses the company of using forced labor, after congressional staff discovered links between the company and Xinjiang Production Construction Corps., a paramilitary group sanctioned by the U.S. Commerce Department for its involvement in China's forced labor practice. 


Chuck Thelen, vice president of manufacturing of Gotion North America, recently called the forced labor accusations “categorically false and clearly intended to deceive.”

## Using ROR for Funder Identification

date: 2024-08-06, from: ROR Research ID Blog

Several widely used scholarly systems are using ROR IDs to identify and disambiguate funding organizations. In this post, we’ll give you a glimpse of how and why these systems use ROR IDs as funder identifiers.
