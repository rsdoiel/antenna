id="robust-us-has-helped-improve-global-economic-outlook-imf-chief-says">‘Robust’
US has helped improve global economic outlook, IMF chief says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Strong growth in the United States has helped to lift
the outlook for the world economy, but more needs to be done to stem a
slide in productivity, the head of the IMF said Thursday. </p>
<p>“Global growth is marginally stronger on account of robust activity
in the United States and in many emerging markets economies,”
International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva told
reporters in prepared remarks. </p>
<p>The U.S. economy grew by 2.5 percent last year, according to the U.S.
Commerce Department, far outstripping most other advanced
economies. </p>
<p>“Robust household consumption and business investment, and an easing
of supply chain problems helped,” Georgieva added. “And inflation is
going down, somewhat faster than previously expected.” </p>
<p>She spoke just a few days before the IMF-World Bank spring meetings
of world financial leaders in Washington, one of two such gatherings
hosted each year by the international financial institutions. </p>
<p>Her remarks suggest the IMF now expects the world economy to grow
faster than it predicted in January, when it forecast global growth to
rise by 3.1 percent in 2024, and 3.2 percent in 2025. </p>
<p>“It is tempting to breathe a sigh of relief. We have avoided a global
recession and a period of stagflation — as some had predicted,”
Georgieva said. “But there are still plenty of things to worry
about.” </p>
<p>Among the challenges, Georgieva mentioned rising geopolitical
tension, which, she said, is increasing the risks of fragmentation of
the global economy. </p>
<p>She also highlighted the challenges of growing public debt and a
“broad-based slowdown in productivity.” </p>
<p>Because of this, the IMF expects growth to remain at just above 3
percent over the medium term — below its historical average. </p>
<p>To help the global economy to heal and fix the productivity
challenge, Georgieva laid out a series of steps to bring global
inflation and public debt back down to sustainable levels, and also
called for steps to eliminate “constraints to economic activity” and
boost productivity. </p>
<p>“In short, if there is a market failure that is being addressed —
such as accelerating innovation to address the existential threat of
climate change — there is a case for government intervention, including
through industrial policy,” she said. </p>
<p>“If there is no market failure, there is a need for caution,” she
added.</p>

<li>Canada expects another ‘catastrophic’ wildfire season

<p>
Canada is preparing for this year’s wildfire season to be
“catastrophic,” following a warm and dry winter. “The temperature trends
are very concerning,”

Harjit Sajjan, the country’s minister for emergency preparedness. “With
the heat and dryness across the country we can expect that the wildfire
season will start sooner and end later and potentially be more
explosive.” Last year’s wildfire season was the worst ever: More than 37
million acres burned, 230,000 people were evacuated, and wildfire smoke
drifted across large parts of the U.S.

power technologies like generative AI, are a main driver of customer
growth. Power use from data centers is expected to triple globally this
year, according to Morgan Stanley research. The question is whether
utility companies can keep up. Growing electricity demand will “stress
utility company balance sheets as capital spending escalates to upgrade
the infrastructure and integrate renewable energy resources,”

none of these crucial tasks … will be possible unless we get the climate

Convention on Climate Change, told a crowd in London. He called for a
“quantum leap” in climate finance commitments at this year’s COP29.
“Sidelining climate isn’t a solution to a crisis that will decimate
every G20 economy and has already started to hurt,” he said. Stiell

Meta’s latest answer to protecting kids on Instagram is automatically
blurring images that may contain nudity. The company says it will test
this on the platform’s direct messaging feature. We’ll parse the
details. Plus, the FCC is requiring large internet providers to post
“broadband nutrition labels” that provide a snapshot of charges and
performance data. Will they impact consumers’ internet diet? And a
recent survey finds that CEOs are feeling pretty optimistic.

sanctions 2 US defense companies and says they support arms sales to
Taiwan</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Beijing — China on Thursday announced rare sanctions against two U.S.
defense companies over what it said is their support for arms sales to
Taiwan, the self-governing island democracy Beijing claims as its own
territory to be recovered by force if necessary.</p>
<p>The announcement freezes the assets of General Atomics Aeronautical
Systems and General Dynamics Land Systems held within China. It also
bars the companies’ management from entering the country. </p>
<p>Filings show General Dynamics operates a half-dozen Gulfstream and
jet aviation services operations in China, which remains heavily reliant
on foreign aerospace technology even as it attempts to build its own
presence in the field. </p>
<p>The company helps make the Abrams tank being purchased by Taiwan to
replace outdated armor intended to deter or resist an invasion from
China. </p>
<p>General Atomics produces the Predator and Reaper drones used by the
U.S. military. Chinese authorities did not go into details on the
company’s alleged involvement with supplying arms to Taiwan. </p>
<p>Beijing has long threatened such sanctions, but has rarely issued
them as its economy reels from the COVID-19 pandemic, high unemployment
and a sharp decline in foreign investment. </p>
<p>“The continued U.S. arms sales to China’s Taiwan region seriously
violate the one-China principle and the provisions of the three
China-U.S. joint communiqués, interfere in China’s internal affairs, and
undermine China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,” China’s
Foreign Ministry said in a statement. It insists that the mainland and
the island to which Chiang Kai-shek’s Nationalist forces fled amid civil
war in 1949 remain part of a single Chinese nation. </p>
<p>Sanctions were leveled under Beijing’s recently enacted Law of the
People’s Republic of China on Countering Foreign Sanctions. </p>
<p>General Dynamics fully owned entities are registered in Hong Kong,
the southern Chinese semi-autonomous city over which Beijing has
steadily been increasing its political and economic control to the point
that it faces no vocal opposition and has seen its critics silenced,
imprisoned or forced into exile. </p>
<p>Despite their lack of formal diplomatic ties — a concession
Washington made to Beijing when they established relations in 1979 — the
U.S. remains Taiwan’s most important source of diplomatic support and
supplier of military hardware from fighter jets to air defense
systems. </p>
<p>Taiwan has also been investing heavily in its own defense industry,
producing sophisticated missiles and submarines. </p>
<p>China had 14 warplanes and six navy ships operating around Taiwan on
Wednesday and Thursday, with six of the aircraft crossing into Taiwan’s
air defense identification zone — a tactic to test Taiwan’s defenses,
wear down its capabilities and intimidate the population. </p>
<p>So far, that has had little effect, with the vast majority of the
island’s 23 million people opposing political unification with
China.</p>

Won’t Pay — at Least Not on Its Own</h2>

<p class="drop-caps">
When I was an analyst at the U.S. Treasury, my team’s work centered
around promising private investors that we would make it easier for them
to invest in renewable energy projects across the Global South. I kept
hearing that our job was ultimately to make these projects “bankable.”
As the logic went,
“<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1234" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>there
is a sizeable universe of good projects that fall just below many
private investors’ desired rate of return</u></a>,” and therefore
lowering the risks of investing in these “good projects” would put them
within reach of private investors’ return expectations. To make
decarbonization possible, we had to make decarbonization profitable.
</p>
<p>
This claim cuts straight through Brett Christophers’ latest book,
<a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-price-is-wrong-why-capitalism-won-t-save-the-planet-brett-christophers/20125262" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>The
Price is Wrong: Why Capitalism Won’t Save the Planet</em></em></u></a>,
which argues that the cost of developing and generating renewable energy
is <em><em>not</em></em> what will determine the speed or scale of its
uptake. It might finally be cheaper to build solar panels and wind farms
than a coal or gas plant, that’s for sure. But given the structure of
our energy markets today, it does not follow that assets that are cheap
to build are necessarily profitable enough to provide adequate returns
to investors.
</p>
<p>
My old colleagues might have already been aware of this fact, but as
Christophers highlights, it’s certainly not intuitive, even to many
analysts. Nor are its implications: Decarbonization won’t happen if it’s
not profitable enough ― and it’s not profitable enough.
</p>
<p>
Christophers is a professor at Sweden’s Uppsala University in its
“department of human geography,” whose research focuses on how
capitalism and the modern financial system shape our lives; in this
book, that also includes our energy systems. To make his case, he
highlights the vicious feedback loop affecting renewables endemic to
today’s energy markets. Government support to build renewable energy
drives down its marginal cost, but because there’s now more renewable
energy available at any given moment, the falling costs cut into
developers’ expected returns, requiring more government support to keep
investors and developers interested in the sector.
</p>
<p>
Combine this dynamic with technical features endemic to renewable energy
generation, including its intermittency, and the result is a wholesale
electricity market with perennially unstable prices. This volatility
throttles the expected returns on any investment in renewable energy. No
matter how cheap it is to build renewable energy, private investors and
developers won’t decarbonize our globe at the speed or scale we deserve
― not under these financial conditions, at least.
</p>
<p>
Christophers leans on two theoretical guideposts here. First, Andreas
Malm, whose assessment of how the profit motive, not relative costs,
drove Britain’s first energy transition from water-wheels to coal and
steam is an unmistakable conceptual parallel to today’s transition.
Second, Karl Polanyi, whose theory of “fictitious commodities” —
referring to land, labor, and money, each of which the state and society
must painstakingly regulate<em> </em>into fungible market-friendly
products ― Christophers aptly applies to electricity and the artificial
markets created around it.
</p>
<p>
But rather than hew to theory to justify why the energy system needs to
be socialized to achieve decarbonization ― which is definitely true, by
the way; the profit motive is supremely unhelpful here ― Christophers
embraces a holistic understanding of the economy as a set of financial
relationships, supply chains, planned markets, and legal institutions
connecting various public and private entities with different motives.
</p>
<p>
That means interviewing investors, who tell him things like: “Low
returns and volatility don’t go. No bank in the world will take power
price risk at low returns.” Christophers also produces a detailed and
data-rich breakdown of the interlocking global energy crises in 2021 and
2022, jumping between Texas, China, India, Australia, and across Europe,
to make a larger point about energy markets. These crises were “not
taken to be evidence of the failings of markets, or even a reason to
question their role as the pre-eminent mechanism of coordination to the
state’s electricity sector,” he writes; “the market was regarded as the
very means to <em><em>manage </em></em>the crisis.” But the markets
aren’t working. Something has to give.
</p>
<p>
He ends the book with a call for socialized power, inspired by the Green
New Deal and New York’s Build Public Renewables Act, championed by the
state’s democratic socialists on the explicit grounds that, because
delivering on the state’s emissions targets is not profitable enough for
the private sector to do alone, the public sector must get the job done.
With the force of the whole book’s arguments and evidence behind it,
this policy prescription hardly appears radical.
</p>
<h3>
How to Intervene in an Energy Market
</h3>
<p>
Public developers can accept lower profitability thresholds, and public
finance institutions can provide debt on more forgiving terms; under the
public aegis, rates of return and costs of capital become policy
choices. Christophers admits in his introduction that he is more focused
on unearthing the fragile relationships among actors across the
renewable energy industry than on describing the ways a New
York-inspired socialized power sector could function. Given <em><em>how
much</em></em> there is to unearth, it’s a reasonable choice, but it
leaves readers without a working heuristic for the different ways states
can intervene in the business of energy.
</p>
<p>
Here’s my attempt: Energy must be financed, generated, distributed, and
consumed. Government intervention in favor of decarbonization looks
distinct at each step.
</p>
<p>
Governments can provide <em><em>consumption support</em></em> by
shielding ratepayers from the higher electricity bills that come from
potential utility investments into renewable energy procurement and
decarbonization-related grid management, backstopping utility
investments through a demand guarantee. Consumption support is
equitable, but it’s also indirect and incomplete — it might provide a
utility with more financial breathing room to procure or develop
renewables, but if renewables are not available to procure on the grid
or are not easy to develop, this demand guarantee likely just pads the
utility’s bottom line.
</p>
<p>
Governments can provide <em><em>distribution support</em></em> by
encouraging utilities to purchase renewable energy. Distribution support
most often takes the form of regulatory nudges: In the United States,
mandates like Renewable Portfolio Standards force utilities to increase
their clean energy procurement, guaranteeing purchase demand for clean
electricity and Renewable Energy Certificates, which companies might buy
to clean up their own energy portfolios.
</p>
<p>
These demand-guarantee interventions <em><em>have</em></em> helped speed
up renewable energy development nationwide, but with limits. In
particular, utility power purchase agreements don’t provide developers
with adequate price stability because utilities fix the quantity of
energy they purchase rather than the price; corporate PPAs, meanwhile,
cannot be relied on at scale because there aren’t enough large
creditworthy corporations like Google and Amazon willing to commit to
buying energy from new projects at a fixed price. For these reasons and
more, supporting utilities’ efforts to decarbonize will not call forth
adequate renewable energy generation sources into existence.
</p>
<p>
<em><em>Generation support</em></em> is what most governments already
do. Whether through feed-in tariffs, production tax credits, or
contracts for difference, generation support entails propping up
generators’ profitability, ensuring that the sale price of their energy
is never too low. Christophers explains why this mechanism — that is, a
revenue guarantee rather than a demand guarantee — is deeply necessary:
Renewable energy sources and the energy markets they’re plugged into are
both structurally volatile, so, no matter how much energy they generate,
they never generate all that much profit. Withdrawing generation support
would be, in no uncertain terms, a death knell for renewables
development.
</p>
<p>
And, finally, <em><em>financing support</em></em> targets renewable
energy sources as capital-intensive assets requiring huge amounts of
upfront debt. Whether through the investment tax credit, viability gap
funding, concessional financing, or other forms of cost-share plans,
financing support is another form of <em><em>direct</em></em> price
support for generation companies; by lowering a project’s cost of
capital, it helps lower its developer’s threshold for project
profitability, meaning that generators pay less debt service and keep
more of their revenues. High interest rates have lately forced up the
cost of debt for renewable energy projects to unsustainable levels, far
above private developers’ prospective rates of return. Financing support
is a must-have these days ― and it’s all the more necessary across the
Global South, where the costs of capital are far higher.
</p>
<p>
None of this is to say that socializing generation and finance solves
every problem ― as far as the United States is concerned, non-financial
barriers abound, such as regulations and interconnection queues ― but
within the existing structure of energy markets, public ownership
<em><em>does</em></em> solve a lot.
</p>
<p>
What does direct government intervention into energy consumption and
distribution look like? Public ownership of local distribution utilities
is a start. Unlike private utility companies, they don’t need to promise
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-26/green-goals-clash-with-higher-power-bills-exelon-ceo-says" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ten
percent returns</u></a> to shareholders, and can use the financial
breathing room that comes from lower profitability thresholds to tamp
down rate hikes and, perhaps more importantly, rate volatility. Public
utilities will not drive decarbonization, but they could potentially
help advance transmission reform and better integrate distributed energy
resources into the grid.
</p>
<p>
Christophers all but argues that the best thing governments can do for
all four support categories is to redesign energy markets. Beyond simply
incentivizing the deployment of clean firm and battery technologies to
complement renewables, policymakers’ biggest task is to build an energy
system where volatile wholesale energy prices ― which even publicly
owned renewable energy developers will have to face for the foreseeable
future ― are not the reason that a project fails to get built. That
would be a policy failure, and we don’t have time for those.

id="scientists-struggle-to-protect-infant-corals-from-hungry-fish">Scientists
struggle to protect infant corals from hungry fish</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. — South Florida researchers trying to prevent
predatory fish from devouring laboratory-grown coral are grasping at
biodegradable straws in an effort to restore what some call the
rainforest of the sea.</p>
<p>Scientists around the world have been working for years to address
the decline of coral reef populations. Just last summer, reef rescue
groups in South Florida and the Florida Keys were trying to save coral
from rising ocean temperatures. Besides working to keep existing coral
alive, researchers have also been growing new coral in labs and then
placing them in the ocean.</p>
<p>But protecting the underwater ecosystem that maintains more than 25%
of all marine species is not easy. Even more challenging is making sure
that coral grown in a laboratory and placed into the ocean doesn’t
become expensive fish food.</p>
<p>Marine researcher Kyle Pisano said one problem is that predators like
parrot fish attempt to bite and destroy the newly transplanted coral in
areas like South Florida, leaving them with less than a 40% survival
rate. With projects calling for thousands of coral to be planted over
the next year and tens of thousands of coral to be planted over the next
decade, the losses add up when coral pieces can cost more than $100
each.</p>
<p>Pisano and his partner, Kirk Dotson, have developed the Coral Fort,
claiming the small biodegradable cage that’s made in part with drinking
straws boosts the survival rate of transplanted coral to over 90%.</p>
<p>“Parrot fish on the reef really, really enjoy biting a newly
transplanted coral,” Pisano said. “They treat it kind of like
popcorn.”</p>
<p>Fortunately the fish eventually lose interest in the coral as it
matures, but scientists need to protect the coral in the meantime.
Stainless steel and PVC pipe barriers have been set up around
transplanted coral in the past, but those barriers needed to be cleaned
of algae growth and eventually removed.</p>
<p>Pisano had the idea of creating a protective barrier that would
eventually dissolve, eliminating the need to maintain or remove it. He
began conducting offshore experiments with biodegradable coral cages as
part of a master’s degree program at Nova Southeastern University. He
used a substance called polyhydroxyalkanoate, a biopolymer derived from
the fermentation of canola oil. PHA biodegrades in ocean, leaving only
water and carbon dioxide. His findings were published last year.</p>
<p>The coral cage consists of a limestone disc surrounded by eight
vertical phade brand drinking straws, made by Atlanta-based WinCup
Inc. The device doesn’t have a top, Pisano said, because the juvenile
coral needs sunlight and the parrot fish don’t generally want to
position themselves facing downward to eat.</p>
<p>Dotson, a retired aerospace engineer, met Pisano through his
professor at Nova Southeastern, and the two formed Reef Fortify Inc. to
further develop and market the patent-pending Coral Fort. The first
batch of cages were priced at $12 each, but Pisano and Dotson believe
that could change as production scales up.</p>
<p>Early prototypes of the cage made from phade’s standard drinking
straws were able to protect the coral for about two months before
dissolving in the ocean, but that wasn’t quite long enough to outlast
the interest of parrot fish. When Pisano and Dotson reached out to phade
for help, the company assured them that it could make virtually any
custom shape from its biodegradable PHA material.</p>
<p>“But it’s turning out that the boba straws, straight out of the box,
work just fine,” Dotson said.</p>
<p>Boba straws are wider and thicker than normal drinking straws.
They’re used for a tea-based drink that includes tapioca balls at the
bottom of the cup. For Pisano and Dotson, that extra thickness means the
straws last just long enough to protect the growing coral before
harmlessly disappearing.</p>
<p>Reef Fortify is hoping to work with reef restoration projects all
over the world. The Coral Forts already already being used by
researchers at Nova Southeastern and the University of Miami, as well as
Hawaii’s Division of Aquatic Resources.</p>
<p>Rich Karp, a coral researcher at the University of Miami, said
they’ve been using the Coral Forts for about a month. He pointed out
that doing any work underwater takes a great deal of time and effort, so
having a protective cage that dissolves when it’s no longer needed
basically cuts their work in half.</p>
<p>“Simply caging corals and then removing the cages later, that’s two
times the amount of work, two times the amount of bottom time,” Karp
said. “And it’s not really scalable.”</p>
<p>Experts say coral reefs are a significant part of the oceanic
ecosystem. They occupy less than 1% of the ocean worldwide but provide
food and shelter to nearly 25 percent of sea life. Coral reefs also help
to protect humans and their homes along the coastline from storm surges
during hurricanes.</p>

<p>I’ve been a little less online lately, but not to worry, I have just
been living my life :) Several weeks ago, I gave notice at work and
left. Some people in my life were surprised, because it was a good job
at a good company, I generally enjoyed it, I got to work with wonderful
people, and I was paid money to do it. The younger version of me who
hadn’t yet figured out a career direction would be curious (and more
than a little skeptical) about why I would quit such an objectively good
job.</p>

id="new-york-appeals-court-rejects-donald-trumps-third-request-to-delay-mondays-hush-money-trial">New
York appeals court rejects Donald Trump’s third request to delay
Monday’s hush money trial</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Donald Trump is now 0 for 3 in last-minute attempts to get
a New York appeals court to delay his looming hush money criminal trial.
An appeals court judge Wednesday swiftly rejected the latest salvo from
the former president’s lawyers, who argued he should be on the campaign
trail rather than “in a courtroom defending himself” starting next
week.</p>
<p>Trump’s lawyers had asked the state’s mid-level appeals court to halt
the case indefinitely while they fight to remove the trial judge and
challenge several of his pretrial rulings, which they argue have
seriously hindered the presumptive Republican nominee’s defense.</p>
<p>Justice Ellen Gesmer’s ruling, after a third straight day of
emergency hearings on Trump’s delay requests, was yet another loss for
Trump, who has tried repeatedly to get the trial postponed. Barring
further court action, the ruling clears the way for jury selection to
begin next Monday.</p>
<p>“We’re here for this stay because there are restrictions in place
that cannot operate in a constitutional way in a trial environment,”
Trump lawyer Emil Bove argued at the hearing, which was held in a court
basement lobby because the regular courtroom was in use.</p>
<p>“It’s an incredibly important trial. It’s a historic, unprecedented
proceeding,” Bove said, adding: “This can only be done once, and it must
be done right.”</p>
<p>Trump’s hush-money case is the first of his four criminal indictments
slated to go to trial and would be the first criminal trial ever of a
former president.</p>
<p>Adding to a litany of complaints registered this week with the
appeals court, Bove argued that trial Judge Juan Merchan “exceeded his
authority” in refusing to postpone the case until the Supreme Court
rules on an immunity claim Trump raised in another of his criminal
cases. Trump’s lawyers argue some evidence in the hush-money case could
be excluded if the Supreme Court rules in his favor.</p>
<p>Merchan last week declared that request untimely, ruling that Trump’s
lawyers had “myriad opportunities” to raise the immunity issue before
they finally did so in March, well after a deadline for pretrial motions
had passed.</p>
<p>Steven Wu, the appellate chief for the Manhattan district attorney’s
office, echoed that sentiment at Wednesday’s emergency hearing. He
argued that Trump’s lawyers had months to raise immunity and other
issues and should not be rewarded with a delay at the eleventh hour.</p>
<p>“Staying the trial at this point would be incredibly disruptive,” Wu
said. “The court, the people, witnesses have made extraordinary efforts
to make sure this trial can take place on Monday.”</p>
<p>“There’s a powerful public interest to ensure this criminal trial
goes forward,” he added.</p>
<p>Gesmer presided over the emergency hearing from an armchair, facing a
hodgepodge of wooden seats, a collapsable table and a restroom.</p>
<p>Trump is accused of falsifying his company’s records to hide the
nature of payments to his former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen, who
helped Trump bury negative stories during his 2016 campaign. Cohen’s
activities included paying porn actor Stormy Daniels $130,000 to
suppress her claims of an extramarital sexual encounter with Trump years
earlier.</p>
<p>Trump pleaded not guilty last year to 34 felony counts of falsifying
business records. He has denied having a sexual encounter with Daniels.
His lawyers argue the payments to Cohen were legitimate legal
expenses.</p>
<p>Trump already struck out twice this week with the appeals court. One
appeals court judge Monday rejected his bid to delay the trial while he
seeks to move it out of Manhattan. A different judge on Tuesday denied a
request, framed as part of a lawsuit against Merchan, that the trial be
delayed while Trump fights a gag order imposed on him in recent
weeks.</p>
<p>Trump’s lawyers had asked Merchan last month to adjourn the New York
trial indefinitely until Trump’s immunity claim in his Washington, D.C.,
election interference case is resolved.</p>
<p>Trump contends he is immune from prosecution for conduct alleged to
involve official acts during his tenure in office. His lawyers have not
raised that as a defense in the hush-money case, but they argued that
some evidence — including Trump’s social media posts about former lawyer
Cohen — is from his time as president and should be excluded from the
trial because of his immunity protections.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court is to hear arguments in that matter on April
25.</p>
<p>“This is a situation where a judge has exceeded his authority under
circumstances with very, very serious federalism implications,” Bove
argued at Wednesday’s emergency hearing.</p>
<p>Trump’s lawyers also renewed their argument that Merchan should step
aside from the case. They’ve accused him of bias and a conflict of
interest, citing his daughter’s work as the head of a firm whose clients
have included President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and
other Democrats.</p>
<p>Trump’s lawyers filed a formal recusal request with Merchan last
week. The judge rejected a similar request in August and has not ruled
on Trump’s pending request. The judge has also yet to rule on another
defense delay request, which claims that Trump won’t get a fair trial
because of “prejudicial media coverage.”</p>
<p>“Their recusal arguments are completely meritless,” Wu argued.</p>
<p>Trump’s lawyers also took issue with a protocol Merchan put in place
last month to manage a flood of last-minute court filings. And they
revisited their complaints — aired at an emergency hearing Tuesday —
about the gag order Merchan imposed on Trump last month that bars him
from making public comments about witnesses, jurors and others regarding
their connections to the case.</p>
<p>Trump’s ability to campaign “is something that’s protected under the
First Amendment, for President Trump and the American people,” Bove
argued.</p>

<h2 id="me-and-fsd">Me and FSD</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-10, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Check out my
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/09/160339.html">political
preamble</a> on Tesla, X and Musk.
</p>
<p>
One more disclaimer: I love my Tesla Model Y. Best car ever. I’ve been
driving a Tesla since late 2021, and I still feel privileged to drive
the car every time I do. It’s the Macintosh of cars.
</p>
<p>
I don’t generally use
<a href="https://www.tesla.com/ownersmanual/modely/en_us/GUID-2CB60804-9CEA-4F4B-8B04-09B991368DC5.html">FSD</a>,
even though I paid for it and have had it available all the time I’ve
driven a Tesla.
</p>
<p>
They say you should always be fully attentive when using FSD. I am
always <i>soooo</i> ready to take over for it. I don’t trust it. And I
also don’t feel that when I’m in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-knuckle">white-knuckle</a>
mode when it’s driving, that my reflexes are anywhere near as good as
the reflexes I have when I’m driving, with fifty years of experience,
and maybe a few hours of experience supervising a FSD car. I don’t have
a sense of how to work with it. So I err on the side of turning it off
whenever I feel like even slightly scared.
</p>
<p>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/04/10/trumpBeingCarriedAway.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I
also don’t like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roller_coaster">roller
coasters</a>, but if I did, I’d recognize that this is different. A
roller coaster is designed to give the exact same experience to every
user every time. It’s designed to give the impression that your life is
about to end, using gravity and eyesight and all that evolution trained
you to be scared of. It fools you into being scared, when you’re
actually safe. Every so often you read about someone dying on a
rollercoaster. That probably improves the fun for thrill-seekers, and
gives people like me justification for staying away. People also
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bungee_jumping">bungee jump</a>
knowing there’s a chance the chord could break, but they know it’s not
going to.
</p>
<p>
None of that is true for the Tesla. It’s making it up as it goes along.
And it definitely encounters situations it can’t handle, or it
misinterprets a set of obvious facts, or even worse it hallucinates just
like ChatGPT.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, I was

from Lake Katrine to Woodstock with FSD, and it was doing really well,
up to a point. First I was on

onto
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_State_Route_375">375</a>
which is a curvy two-lane road. I was starting to feel slightly
comfortable. Then we come up to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_State_Route_212">212</a>,
where 375 ends. A busy
<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@42.0369198,-74.1109242,3a,75y,19.14h,83.49t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sJbEh3c4hgugNZsCx4uUtZw!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu">intersection</a>.
Traffic coming from the left and right, and many are turning onto the
road I’m on. I watched in awe as FSD tried to find a way to make a left
turn in this complicated situation, starting, stopping, it tried, found
itself out in traffic, and got stuck there. I had enough and took over.
Luckily the car waiting behind us had left a little room. I’ve dealt
with this intersection probably a few hundred times in the last few
years. I know the crazy things the other drivers do here, and I know to
watch out for them. The Tesla didn’t know.

and faster than most economists anticipated. This poses a conundrum for
central bankers who have made it clear that they want to see further
evidence that inflation is cooling before they cut interest rates.</p>

</p>
<p>
At the end of each MSNBC YouTube video right now they have a 30 second
post-roll of Ali Velshi explaining the 5-step process on how to install
the new MSNBC app.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Tap on the App Store on your phone
</li>
<li>
Hit “Search” on the bottom right corner
</li>
<li>
Type in “MSNBC”
</li>
<li>
Click on the MSNBC app
</li>
<li>
Click on “Get” or the cloud icon
</li>
</ol>
<p>
There’s an implied sixth step where you need to actually open the newly
installed app. Opening the app for the first time you swipe through a
little slideshow that has two more (optional) steps: give your email and
turn on notifications. Standard engagement economy tactics.
</p>
<p>
Hearing the 5-step native app install process a few times a day makes me
think we lost something along the way. Remember when the call to action
was to visit a URL? Not only is “Visit msnbc.com” more succinct,
catchier, private, less prone to user error, and immune to competitive
advertisements but it also doesn’t require a paid presenter to coach you
through it. Once upon a time users might have needed Ali Velshi’s help
getting to a website, but in my experience visiting a website is one of
the first computing skills my kids learned without my direct
involvement. The URL isn’t a foreign concept anymore.
</p>
<p>
I know I’m making a mountain out of a “We just want to promote our new
app, maaan” molehill here, but even saying “Visit msnbc.com/mobile” with
a redirect to their
<a href="https://www.msnbc.com/information/msnbc-info/download-msnbc-app-n1241692">actual
app download page</a> would be easier. It boggles my mind why you’d push
a clunky app store install flow over a five-letter domain name. I’d even
bet $5 that the “native app” is actually a bunch of web views in a
trench coat. In an even wilder twist, that app download page isn’t
linked anywhere on the website! Ughck. I’m 0% invested on what’s
happening over at MSNBC but I’m already getting whiffs of misaligned
goals, interdepartmental strife, and poorly designed content management
systems.
</p>
<p>
Anyways, websites. They’re old tech but still work great from time to
time.

new tech laws are working; small mobile browsers gain market share</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>Independent browser companies in the European Union are seeing a
spike in users in the first month after EU legislation forced Alphabet’s
Google, Microsoft and Apple to make it easier for users to switch to
rivals, according to data provided to Reuters by six companies. The
early results come after the EU’s sweeping Digital Markets Act, which
aims to remove unfair competition, took effect on March 7, forcing big
tech companies to offer mobile users the ability to select from a list
of available web browsers from a “choice screen.” ↫ Supantha Mukherjee
and Foo Yun Chee I can’t believe this is even remotely surprising. A lot
of especially Apple fans and people from outside of the European Union
complained left, right, and centre about the choice screen and how it
was ugly, unnecessary, and would just confuse users. These are
interesting claims, considering the fact that setting up a modern
smartphone such as the iPhone takes the user through 40-50 setup screens
chockful of confusing choices to make, so adding one more surely
wouldn’t make a difference. Of course giving users the option to choose
a different default browser would lead to an increase in browsers other
than Safari (iOS) or Chrome (Android) being set as the default. I’m
pretty sure quite a few users learned, through the choice screen, for
the first time, that there even are different browsers to choose from,
and that some of those might offer features and benefits they didn’t
even know they could enjoy. That’s the whole point of this endeavour:
informing users that they have a choice, something Apple, Google, and
others would rather you either do not have, or at least not know about.
It’s far too early to tell if these spikes are a one-off thing, or if
the rise in browsers other than Safari on iOS and Chrome on Android is
more structural. I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s the latter, and even if
the numbers remain in the single digits or low double digits, it will
still lead to an increase in competition, and a more vibrant mobile
browser market. Good news, regardless.</p>

id="house-lawmakers-reject-renewal-of-key-us-intelligence-program">House
lawmakers reject renewal of key US intelligence program</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — U.S. House lawmakers rejected an attempt to reform a
controversial foreign intelligence program Wednesday, the latest blow in
Speaker Mike Johnson’s effort to lead a narrow Republican majority.</p>
<p>A renewal of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA,
failed to advance, 228-193, following a warning from former President
Donald Trump on TruthSocial.</p>
<p>Trump said that FISA “was illegally used against me, and many others.
They spied on my campaign!!” he wrote, using all capital letters.</p>
<p>A Justice Department investigation found in 2019 that surveillance of
Trump campaign aide Carter Page continued for months after it should
have ended.</p>
<p>The law — also referred to as Section 702 — allows U.S. intelligence
agencies to collect data on foreigners overseas without obtaining a
warrant. But it has received the most criticism for so-called “backdoor
searches” that allow collection of U.S. citizens’ data. An attempted
reform would have required the FBI to secure a warrant before collecting
data.</p>
<p>“We’re enacting sweeping changes — 50 reforms, 56 to be exact — to
the program that are in the base text that will stop the abuse of
politicized FBI queries and prevent another Russia hoax debacle, among
many other important reforms,” Johnson told reporters Wednesday morning.
“No more of the intelligence community relying on fake news reports to
order a FISA order, no more collusion.”</p>
<p>But Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene — who has filed
a procedural motion to remove Johnson from the speakership — said those
reforms were not enough.</p>
<p>“It’s like asking the deep state to hold itself accountable,” Greene
told reporters Wednesday. “The FBI is abusing American people’s trust.
The [Justice Department] has abused the American people’s trust. So,
this doesn’t give me confidence that it will stop it.”</p>
<p>Nineteen House Republicans voted against the bill. Democrats said
Wednesday that the proposed FISA reforms had not secured their
votes.</p>
<p>“Whatever the vote count is, or whatever happens to that, it’s
because the speaker has chosen not to advance this issue in a single
standalone process. If he chooses to go a different route, then we’ll
reassess,” Representative Pete Aguilar, chair of the House Democratic
Caucus, said Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>An attempt to pass surveillance laws failed in December when House
leadership pulled a vote amid internal Republican divisions.</p>
<p>Johnson argued to colleagues in a letter on Friday that the law would
“establish new procedures to rein in the FBI, increase accountability at
the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, or FISC, impose penalties
for wrongdoing, and institute unprecedented transparency across the FISA
process so we no longer have to wait years to uncover potential
abuses.”</p>
<p>Christopher Wray, the director of the FBI, warned against some of the
proposed changes in a speech Tuesday to the American Bar
Association.</p>
<p>“Bottom line, a warrant requirement would be the equivalent of
rebuilding the pre-9/11 intelligence ‘wall,’” he said in his prepared
remarks. “As the threats to our homeland continue to evolve, the agility
and effectiveness of 702 will be essential to the FBI’s ability — and
really our mandate from the American people — to keep them safe for
years to come.”</p>
<p>Unless Congress acts, authorization for the program expires on April
19.</p>

details new features coming in Windows Server 2025</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>Microsoft recently held a streaming event in which it detailed a lot
of the new features and changes coming in Windows server 2025, and has
now followed that up with a blog post, as well. There’s a lot to go over
here, and I’m anything but a Windows Server specialist, so I’ll
highlight some of the thing I’m certain will be welcomed by Windows
Server administrators. First and foremost, the biggest improvement:
hot-patching. Security updates can be installed without having to
reboot, because Server 2025 will modify code in memory without
restarting the processes in question. Quarterly updates, however, will
still require reboots. Hot-patching will be free on all versions of
Server 2025. Microsoft also promises a massive performance boost for
NVMe drives – the company claims a 70% improvement going from Server
2022 to Server 2025. Microsoft’s other file system, ReFS, is also seeing
improvements, and Storage Replica’s compression will be available in all
editions of Windows Server 2025. A major improvement in Hyper-V is the
ability to partition GPUs, so you can use one GPU to power multiple
virtual machines. As far as licensing goes, the most important news here
is that you’ll still be able to buy a normal, regular, run-of-the-mill
perpetual license for Windows Server 2025, so even though there’s
various more ‘modern’ options, you can also just opt for the way it’s
always been.</p>

<h2 id="think-diplomacy-is-tough-try-a-white-house-state-dinner">Think
diplomacy is tough? Try a White House state dinner</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>the white house — Preparations take months. No detail is overlooked,
for this is perhaps the most evolved form of diplomacy: the state
dinner.</p>
<p>As first lady Jill Biden prepared Wednesday to host her fifth state
dinner, for Japan’s leader, she made sure that every aesthetic detail —
the crystal on the tables, the food on the White House china, the decor
in the State Dining Room, the music and the fashion — dripped with
diplomatic significance. This dinner, she said in her preview of the
event, would make frequent reference to Washington’s famous cherry
trees, a gift from Japan more than a century ago.</p>
<p>“As guests sit among the field of flowers, glass and silk butterflies
from both our countries will dance over the tables, their graceful
flight a reminder that as our nations navigate the winds of change, we
do so together as partners in peace and prosperity,” she said.</p>
<p>The White House Historical Association laid out the high stakes,
saying a state dinner “showcases global power and influence and sets the
tone for the continuation of dialogue between the president and the
visiting head of state.”  </p>
<p>Roxanne Roberts, a style writer for The Washington Post who has
covered state dinners for more than 30 years, likens them to “the
frosting on an already-baked cake.”</p>
<p>“The state dinner is the least important part of a state visit, but
it’s the thing that gets the most attention,” she told VOA. “And it
sends a signal to not only the government of that country but the people
of that country that you’re important to us. We care about you.”</p>
<p>That’s reflected in the numbers. Records that journalists requested
from the State Department, which foots the bill, show that Obama-era
dinners cost U.S. taxpayers more than half a million dollars each. More
recent dinner tabs have not been released.</p>
<p>The food!</p>
<p>Imagine, Roberts said, a lavish wedding.</p>
<p>“It’s as if there was a marriage between the two countries, and this
is the wedding reception,” she said.</p>
<p>The most obvious manifestation of that is on the plate.</p>
<p>White House executive chef Cristeta Comerford said this menu took her
“a couple of months” to design and field test. Over three courses,
guests took a tour through her Japan-influenced creations, starting with
a nod to the beloved American twist on sushi, the California roll. Her
version was rendered as a salad of house-cured salmon with avocado,
grapefruit, watermelon radish, cucumber and shiso leaf fritters.</p>
<p>Beef has been a fixture of past Biden dinners — the exception, of
course, being the menu for the 2023 state dinner for Indian leader
Narendra Modi, a strict vegetarian. Guests at this year’s dinner,
accordingly, moved on to a dry-aged rib-eye steak with blistered
shishito pepper butter; a fricassee of fava beans, morels and cipollini
mushrooms; and a sesame oil sabayon.</p>
<p>And for dessert: a salted caramel pistachio cake with matcha tea
ganache, cherry ice cream and a drizzle of raspberry coulis.</p>
<p>“We wanted to bring a little bit of the cherry blossoms that are here
on the Tidal Basin right here to our dessert, in order for everyone to
enjoy the cherry blossoms that we enjoy every year,” said White House
executive pastry chef Susie Morrison.</p>
<p>The wines, as is now custom, will be American.</p>
<p>“The days when only French wines were served at state dinners are
long gone,” Roberts said. “Primarily because there were a lot of
American vineyards who basically said, ‘Whoa, what about us? We’re
cool.’” </p>
<p>The fripperies!</p>
<p>A temporary installation in the White House’s Cross Hall featured
swimming koi – “symbols of friendship, peace, luck and perseverance,”
Biden said.</p>
<p>In the Bookseller’s Hall arrival area, a massive vinyl floor decal
with images of cherry blossoms, butterflies and koi was laid over the
marble flooring, as guests strolled in — including former President Bill
Clinton, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, gold-medal figure
skater Kristi Yamaguchi, Biden family members and actor Robert DeNiro.
Dresses bore floral motifs, lace and long hems. One guest wore a formal
montsuki, a version of a kimono.</p>
<p>Musical entertainment featured Paul Simon, a favorite of the first
lady. And the first couples exchanged gifts that included a three-legged
black walnut table made by a Japanese-American-owned company, a set of
records autographed by American singer Billy Joel, and, as a personal
touch, a framed painting of the Yoshino cherry tree that Jill Biden
planted with Japan’s first lady, Yuko Kishida, on the South Lawn last
spring.</p>
<p>The fashion!</p>
<p>Yuko Kishida had garnered rave reviews for her choice to don India’s
most culturally and technically fraught of garments, the sari, by
draping and meticulously pleating 5 meters of green Kanjeevaram silk
around her body for a summit of global leaders last year in New
Delhi.</p>
<p>As she landed in Washington for her first state visit on Tuesday —
but her second trip to meet the Bidens — she greeted the couple in a
flowing dress of autumn-toned watercolor florals. President Joe Biden
and Prime Minister Fumio Kishida wore suits, while the U.S. first lady
donned a black dress with a deep keyhole neckline and razor-sharp
tailoring.  </p>
<p>For the main event, the first ladies coordinated in shades of deep,
purple-toned blue, with Biden in a long-sleeved floor-length beaded gown
in what the White House described as “sapphire ombre” made by the house
of Dominican-born American designer Oscar de la Renta.</p>
<p>The Japanese first lady donned a silky blue gown with exaggerated
shoulders and black beaded floral embellishments along the neckline. The
dress was cinched with a black belt, evoking the sash traditionally used
to secure a kimono.</p>
<p>These decisions, Roberts said, are “more than just going off to the
store and going, ‘Oh, that’s pretty. I think I’ll wear that.’”</p>
<p>And the pressure, she said, falls disproportionately on the leaders’
spouses, who are traditionally women.</p>
<p>“They’re ambassadors for the clothing that they wear, the look that
they have,” she said. “And so, all of those, all of those elements play
into all of these choices. You know, the guys have it easy — just throw
on the tuxedo.”</p>
<p>… And finally, the faux pas!</p>
<p>What could possibly go wrong?  </p>
<p>Surprisingly, not a lot, Roberts said, adding, “The truth of the
matter is that these state dinners tend to go off without a hitch,
because the planning is done so well.”</p>
<p>But, she said, mistakes sometimes happen.</p>
<p>She described a long-ago dinner for Mexico’s leader that featured “an
elaborate dessert that had a guy with a sombrero sleeping as a
decorative piece.”</p>
<p>“It was meant to be charming and kind of fun, and it just hit wrong,”
she said.</p>
<p>Another memorable slip, she said, was at a 2009 state dinner for
India, where two uninvited reality stars crashed the event.</p>
<p>“The fact that two people were able to get in who were not supposed
to be there was, in fact, a scandal,” she said.</p>
<p>The East Wing, in its preview, chose to focus instead on the
positive, with White House social secretary Carlos Elizondo homing in on
the theme while raising the stakes of this impossibly complex event.</p>
<p>“That’s what we hope to capture,” he said. “The magic of spring in
our lasting friendship, each detail chosen to create a
once-in-a-lifetime experience.”</p>

US general warns Ukraine on brink of being overrun by Russia</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The tenacity of Ukrainian troops will soon be no match
for Russia’s manpower and missiles should U.S. lawmakers fail to approve
additional security assistance for Ukraine, the top American general in
Europe told lawmakers, part of a stark warning about the direction of
the more than two-year-old conflict.</p>
<p>U.S. military officials have warned repeatedly in recent weeks that
Russian forces have been able to make incremental gains in Ukraine and
that without renewed U.S. backing, Ukraine’s forces will eventually
falter.</p>
<p>Testifying before the House Armed Services Committee Wednesday, the
commander of U.S. European Command described the battlefield in blunt
terms.</p>
<p>“If we do not continue to support Ukraine, Ukraine will run out of
artillery shells and will run out of air defense interceptors in fairly
short order,” said General Christopher Cavoli, explaining that Kyiv is
dependent on the United States for those key munitions.</p>
<p>“I can’t predict the future, but I can do simple math,” he said.
“Based on my experience in 37-plus years in the U.S. military, if one
side can shoot and the other side can’t shoot back, the side that can’t
shoot back loses.”</p>
<p>Cavoli also said the failure of U.S. lawmakers to approve a $60
billion supplemental security package is already giving Russia a
significant advantage.</p>
<p>“They [Ukraine] are now being outshot by the Russian side 5-to-1,” he
told lawmakers. “That will immediately go to 10-to-1 in a matter of
weeks.</p>
<p>“We are not talking about months. We are not talking hypothetically,”
Cavoli said.</p>
<p>Multiple U.S. officials have warned that Ukraine’s military has been
forced to ration artillery and air defense capabilities as Kyiv waits
for U.S. lawmakers to approve the supplemental assistance.</p>
<p>“We are already seeing the effects of the failure to pass the
supplemental,” Assistant Secretary of Defense Celeste Wallander told the
panel, testifying alongside U.S. European Command’s Cavoli.</p>
<p>“We don’t need to imagine,” she said, blaming the lack of U.S.
provided artillery for why “the Russian attacks are getting
through.”</p>
<p>That supplemental defense package passed in the U.S. Senate back in
February, but leadership in the House of Representatives has so far
refused to bring the legislation to the floor for a vote.</p>
<p>During a press conference on Capitol Hill Wednesday, Republican House
of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson said lawmakers were continuing
to “actively discuss our options on a path forward.”</p>
<p>“It’s a very complicated matter at a very complicated time. The clock
is ticking on it, and everyone here feels the urgency of that,” Johnson
said. “But what’s required is that you reach consensus on it, and that’s
what we’re working on.”</p>
<p>House Democrats, however, have voiced frustration with Johnson’s
refusal to call a vote.</p>
<p>“The House has waited months now to approve the security package to
help protect Ukraine,” said Representative Adam Smith, the top Democrat
on the House Armed Services Committee. “Weeks ago, we were too late. And
now every day is at an extreme cost to our ability to deter Russia.”</p>
<p>Another Democrat on the committee, Representative Elissa Slotkin,
scolded Johnson, saying he needs to call a vote despite opposition from
a small group of House Republicans.</p>
<p>“We do need to get it over the finish line,” she said. “I accept that
he’s at risk of losing his job over that choice, but that’s what
leadership is — it’s the big boy pants and making tough choices.”</p>
<p>Some Republicans, though, chastised Democratic lawmakers for what
they described as misguided priorities.</p>
<p>“We’ve got hundreds of thousands of Americans who are dying, fentanyl
overdoses, child and human sex trafficking, not to mention 178-plus
countries that are crossing our border,” said Republican Representative
Cory Mills.</p>
<p>“But, oh wait, that’s not the priority. Let’s secure Ukraine’s
borders,” he said.</p>

<h2 id="a-weighted-vest">A weighted vest</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-10, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<picture style="margin-inline: auto">

<p>
I bought <a href="https://amzn.to/3xsz1Xj">a 40 pound weighted vest for
$40 dollars on Amazon</a>. The workout term for this is “rucking” and
has connotations with being outdoorsy and/or in the military. Load up a
backpack full of weights (or in my case, a vest full of sand bags) and
head outdoors. The
<a href="https://www.goruck.com/pages/what-is-rucking">marketing
benefits</a> of rucking sound great:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
It is simple and anyone can do it
</li>
<li>
Gets you outside
</li>
<li>
Active Resistance Training™️
</li>
<li>
Burns up to 3x more calories than walking
</li>
<li>
Good for your back and improves your posture
</li>
<li>
Good for your mental health
</li>
</ul>
<p>
A neighbor friend of mine (that’s also a physical therapist) has one and
she recommended it. My body is adept at carrying heavy
objects<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>,
so this seems like an easy way to squeeze out some gains from my regular
walks. Bonus points that it gets me outside and gets rid of my developer
hunch. After a handful of walks, I’m enjoying the vest and –as expected–
my body handles the weight fine but it’s sweatier and hills knock the
wind out of me a bit more.
</p>
<p>
There’s an army fetish around rucking. It’s hard to tell if that’s
fragile male ego in workout culture or if it’s because an armored plate
carrier is a well-tested and efficient way to carry weight. My vest
doesn’t look that masculine and looks more like I duct taped C4 to my
chest. With my uni-bomber glasses, long hair, beard, and resting scowl I
don’t need more help looking like a disgruntled domestic terrorist but I
suppose this completes the look. If I can sustain
<a href="/2021/06/two-options/">the $40 fix</a>, then I’ll upgrade to
the $200 plate vest solution.
</p>
<p>
The cynical side of me wonders if this is more skinny people shit. As I
dawn the weighted vest, the irony is not lost on me I used to be about
the same amount of weight heavier. Being heavy never helped me lose
weight. No one gives you an approving head nod for walking while fat,
but velcro a little vest to your torso and people give you the “good for
you” pity eyes.
</p>
<p>
Putting my optimist hat back on,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po4adxJxqZk">it might work this
time</a>. Maybe this is the one weird trick my body needs to activate
dormant caveman genetics that will unleash my inner Adonis. Walking in
hard mode seems sustainable for the time-being and I can already feel my
ass morphing into a perfect badonkadonk.

id="trump-says-arizonas-abortion-ban-goes-too-far-defends-overturning-of-roe-v.-wade">Trump
says Arizona’s abortion ban goes ‘too far,’ defends overturning of Roe
v. Wade</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ATLANTA — Donald Trump said Wednesday that an Arizona law that
criminalizes nearly all abortions goes too far and called on Arizona
lawmakers to change it, while also defending the overturning of Roe v.
Wade that cleared states to ban the procedure. </p>
<p>“It’ll be straightened out and as you know, it’s all about states’
rights,” the former president told supporters and journalists after
landing in Atlanta for a fundraiser. “It’ll be straightened out, and I’m
sure that the governor and everybody else are going to bring it back
into reason and that’ll be taken care of, I think, very quickly.” </p>
<p>Though Trump has waffled on whether he supports abortion rights, he
appointed three of the Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe v. Wade
and ended a federally guaranteed right to abortion. Now facing growing
political backlash as Democrats notch victories around the nation by
campaigning on abortion rights, Trump increasingly has been put on the
defensive and urged Republicans to avoid supporting bans that are
unpopular with many Americans. </p>
<p>Trump issued a video statement this week declining to endorse a
national abortion ban and saying he believes limits should be left to
the states. His statement angered some religious conservatives and
energized allies of President Joe Biden who see abortion rights as one
of Trump’s weaknesses. </p>
<p>The Arizona Supreme Court ruling on Tuesday cleared the way for the
enforcement of an 1864 law that bans abortion at all stages of pregnancy
with no exceptions for rape or incest and allows abortions only if the
mother’s life is in jeopardy. </p>
<p>Biden called the 1864 Arizona law cruel. </p>
<p>“Millions of Arizonans will soon live under an even more extreme and
dangerous abortion ban, which fails to protect women even when their
health is at risk or in tragic cases of rape or incest,” he said in a
statement. “Vice President Harris and I stand with the vast majority of
Americans who support a woman’s right to choose. We will continue to
fight to protect reproductive rights and call on Congress to pass a law
restoring the protections of Roe v. Wade.” </p>
<p>The decision drastically altered Arizona’s legal landscape for
terminating pregnancies. The court suggested doctors can be prosecuted
under the Civil War-era law, though the opinion written by the court’s
majority did not say that. </p>
<p>Trump maintains he is proud that the three Supreme Court justices he
nominated voted to overturn Roe v. Wade, saying states will have
different restrictions. He supports three exceptions in cases of rape,
incest and when the life of the mother is at risk. </p>
<p>He also spoke about a Florida law that bans abortions after six
weeks, saying that “is probably maybe going to change also.” Last week,
the state Supreme Court upheld the state’s ban on most abortions after
15 weeks of pregnancy and the ruling also clears the way for the state
to ban abortions after six weeks of pregnancy. </p>
<p>“For 52 years, people have wanted to end Roe v. Wade, to get it back
to the states. We did that. It was an incredible thing, an incredible
achievement,” he said. “Now the states have it, and the states are
putting out what they want. It’s the will of the people. So Florida is
probably going to change.” </p>
<p>Trump ignored questions about how he plans to vote himself on
Florida’s pending state constitutional amendment that would enshrine
abortion access as a right of his home state’s residents. He did not
elaborate on what he thinks the level of restrictions and access should
be in Arizona or any other state.</p>

sleeping for 20h when we finally got here. And all the
<a href="2024-04-05-travel">anxiety before leaving</a> was terrible,
too.
</p>
<p>
With that, I think we have all out must-see locations before the end. We
went to the <a href="2017-10-28_Australia">Great Barrier Reef</a> in
2017, to the <a href="Galapagos_2020">Galapagos</a> in 2020 and now to
the Maldives.

<strong>2024-04-06</strong>. The last leg of the journey – our
water-plane was delayed because of the bad weather.

<p>
Looking out from the porch the ocean is blue, the sky is blue and the
reef begins a few meters in.

<p>

</p>
<p>
We go snorkeling every day. Our last two trips showed me that we need an
underwater camera. Oh to have videos of Reef Number Nine in Australia or
the penguins and sea lions in the Galapagos! I bought a GoPro Hero 10
before we left.

<p>

<p>
This cowtail stingray (?) we keep seeing is about 2m long and likes to
hide in the sand.
</p>
<p>

<p>
There’s sea grass sprouting right now and sea turtles grazing.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-4.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Black tipped reef sharks… harmless! At a later point we did see it
attack something hidden in the rocks and it was scary to see!
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-6.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Most corals look dreary! It’s certainly not as colourful and busy as in
Australia or the Galapagos. This purple giant is cool, though.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-7.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
There are still plenty of colourful fish.

<p>

Whenever we’re away on a trip, we play games. The most popular tropical
island game is Race for the Galaxy.

<strong>2024-04-10</strong>. More pictures.
</p>
<p>
We saw our first hermit crabs in Costa Rica where we spent our honey
moon. We love these little ones. Maybe because they’re slow and easily
scared and therefore obviously harmless.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-10.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
The parrot fish have super sharp teeth and gnaw on the corals. And when
you’re snorkeling, you can hear them. Kchrrr! Kchhhrrk!
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-11.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
I also love those lone corals harbouring a small school of tiny fearful
fish that retreat and hide in the coral as somebody approaches.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-12.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
When you swim past the nearby reef the bottom drops out and the deep
blue begins. I am always afraid some huge fish will show up.

<p>
There is a strange tourism industry, here. The islands are either
uninhabited, inhabited by locals, or reserved for tourism. Tourists can
stay on the “local islands” since 2007. Natives are only allowed to work
on the tourist islands.
</p>
<p>
The capital city is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_proper_by_population_density">one
of the densest urban areas</a> on the planet. Just look at the image of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mal%C3%A9">Malé on Wikipedia</a>.
</p>
<p>
I would lament this urban sprawl, the land reclamation, the garbage
problem, the democracy deficit, the dependence on tourism – but I know
what my friend Peter would say, pointing at the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factfulness">Factfulness</a>
book. Check out these stats from the
<a href="https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malediven">German Wikipedia
page on the Maldives</a>: In 2020, the Maldives had 541000 inhabitants.
In 1950, they had about 74000 inhabitants. At the time, a woman had
about 7.5 children on average in 1980 but these days they are so much
better off that the growth rate has dropped to 1.8% in 2020 and a woman
has about 1.8 children on average. Life expectancy rose from 34.5 years
in 1950 to 81 for women and 77.8 for men in 2020. An amazing improvement
from the point of view of the locals.
</p>
<p>
From my green perspective, though… let’s not forget the garbage island
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thilafushi">Thilafushi</a>. The
picked an island and use it as a garbage dump because they don’t know
what to do with all the garbage. Sure, every island needs a garbage
incinerator now, but in the nineties, there was just garbage and it had
to go somewhere. And some of the stuff starts leaking. It accumulates in
the the fish. People eat the fish. It’s easy to feel grim about this. I
need to remind myself that life expectancy was less than 35 years just a
generation or two ago (I was born in the seventies). Poverty is much,
much worse than pollution and we tend to forget it.
</p>
<p>
If you’re wondering why I’m basically skimming, reading and finally
summarizing Wikipedia articles on my blog, I guess the answer is that
this is how I try to deal with it all. To not close my eyes. Not to look
away.

<p>
Electric bicycles continue to surge in popularity across the United
States, bringing with them a host of benefits but also, inevitably, a
few concerns. Despite e-bikes racking up points from new commuters
across the country for being lower-cost car alternatives that turn
commutes and errand running into joyrides, these powerful new
transportation tools aren’t without their detractors, too.
</p>
<p>
Concerns among some members of the public have ranged from safety issues
of sharing roads with cars to the risk of battery fires. However, there
exists a straightforward solution that could alleviate nearly any worry
anyone has about electric bikes: investing in better cycling
infrastructure.

Aerosila JSC SPE, Delta-Aero LLC, and JSC ODK-Star — were added for
being part of the network. </p>
<p>“These components are used to develop and produce Shahed-series UAVs
which have been used by Iran to attack oil tankers in the Middle East
and by Russia in Ukraine,” the Federal Register notice said, referring
to unmanned aerial vehicles. </p>
<p>Attacks on ships, including oil tankers, by Iranian-backed Houthis
have disrupted global shipping through the Red Sea. Yemen’s Houthi
militia say they are retaliating against Israel’s war against
Palestinian Hamas militants in Gaza. </p>
<p>Companies are added to the U.S. Entity List when Washington deems
them a threat to U.S. national security or foreign policy. Suppliers
must then be granted licenses, which are likely to be denied, before
shipping goods to entities on the list. </p>
<p>The two United Arab Emirates citations, Khalaj Trading LLC and Mahdi
Khalaj Amirhosseini, were added for apparently violating Iran sanctions
by exporting or trying to export items from the United States to Iran
through UAE, according to the posting. </p>
<p>Four Chinese entities were cited for acquiring U.S. items to support
China’s military modernization efforts, it said. They are LINKZOL
(Beijing) Technology Company, Xi’an Like Innovative Information
Technology Company, Beijing Anwise Technology Company and Sitonholy
(Tianjin) Company. </p>
<p>U.S.-Chinese military contacts resumed late last year, but tensions
continue due to fundamental differences over Taiwan and the South China
Sea that remain dangerous potential flashpoints.  </p>
<p>Chinese leader Xi Jinping has pumped billions into buying and
developing equipment as part of his modernizing efforts to build a
“world-class” military by 2050, with Beijing’s outsized defense budget
growing at a faster pace than the economy for some years.</p>

id="colorado-reporters-expulsion-from-republican-gathering-causes-uproar">Colorado
reporter’s expulsion from Republican gathering causes uproar</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>DENVER, COLORADO — Politicians and news outlets in Colorado expressed
anger over the expulsion from a Republican gathering this past weekend
of an experienced politics reporter who was told that the state party
chairman “believes current reporting to be very unfair.” </p>
<p>Journalists and prominent politicians, including the former chair of
the Colorado Republican Party, came to the defense of Colorado Sun
reporter Sandra Fish and against current state Republican Chairman Dave
Williams, who said he had “no apologies” for ejecting Fish. </p>
<p>The controversy follows the contours of attacks on the press
nationally, partly brought on by former President Donald Trump with the
popularization of the term “fake news.” The ejection also appears to
have influenced an endorsement Monday in the Republican primary
race. </p>
<p>The state Republican Party announced on the social media platform X
that it was endorsing U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert over one of her primary
opponent, Deborah Flora, in the state’s 4th Congressional District race,
partly because “Deb Flora lied about participating in the CD4 Assembly
process, &amp; now she’s boot licking fake journalists who only help
Democrats.” </p>
<p>The post was a direct reply to Flora’s post on X defending Fish, in
which Flora said the expulsion was “wrong and a violation of the First
Amendment.” </p>
<p>The chair, who introduces himself on the party’s website as “Dave
‘Let’s Go Brandon’ Williams,” is seeking the nomination to run for the
5th District seat held by Republican U.S. Rep. Doug Lamborn, who is
retiring from Congress. </p>
<p>In a text, Williams said he had no apologies for kicking Fish out of
the assembly in Pueblo on Saturday and accused her of being a “fake
journalist” and The Colorado Sun of being biased. When asked by text for
examples, Williams did not respond. The Colorado Sun is an independent,
nonprofit and nonpartisan news outlet that covers Colorado. </p>
<p>“I invite anyone to share any example of The Colorado Sun or Sandra
Fish being unfair or inaccurate. So far I have heard nothing,” said
Larry Ryckman, editor of the news outlet. “The Founding Fathers weren’t
any big fans of newspapers back in the day. But they understood that a
healthy democracy demands free, unfettered press.” </p>
<p>The assembly, held about two hours south of Denver, was partly to
select representatives to the Republican National Committee and to work
on a party platform for the election. </p>
<p>“There are 900,000 Republicans in the state of Colorado and a lot of
unaffiliated voters who are interested in what happens at this assembly.
And how they find out is via reporters like me being there to cover it,”
Fish told The Associated Press by phone Monday. </p>
<p>“I am, as one person on Twitter noted, a little old lady and I’ve
been in this business for a long time, and I just don’t think it’s right
to eject a reporter from a meeting like this,” said Fish, who has
covered politics since 1982. </p>
<p>Fish said she heard rumors prior to the event that she’d be barred
from attending, and she asked event organizer, Eric Grossman, who texted
her Thursday that he’d get back to her. </p>
<p>“Thanks. I’ve been covering these assemblies for at least seven
cycles and have never had issues before,” Fish texted back. Ryckman
attempted to reach Williams on Thursday night to discuss but said
Williams never responded. </p>
<p>Before dawn on Saturday, Grossman texted Fish saying she wouldn’t be
included on the press list and that “the state chairman believes current
reporting to be very unfair.” </p>
<p>“I went anyway because, come on, this should be an open event,” said
Fish, who was checked in and given press credentials that she wore
around her neck along with a Colorado Sun nametag. </p>
<p>About an hour later, security asked her to leave. Fish showed her
press credentials, then Grossman arrived and soon a sheriff’s deputy was
called. Fish left with the deputy. </p>
<p>“We make no apologies for kicking out a fake journalist, who actually
snuck into our event,” Williams said in a text. “Her publication is just
an extension of the Democrat Party’s PR efforts, and the only backlash
we see is from the fake news media, radical Democrats, and establishment
RINOs who hate our conservative base.” </p>
<p>Grossman, in a text, said Fish’s actions were “a selfish political
stunt.” </p>
<p>Republican state Senator Barbara Kirkmeyer defended the reporter,
writing in a post on X: “Sandra Fish is a fair; honest and respected
reporter, as a Republican I’m embarrassed by the GOP chair.” </p>
<p>Former Colorado Republican Party chair Kristi Burton Brown also
chimed in on X, describing Fish as “hard-hitting but fair. … This is a
dangerous take by the current (Colorado GOP). … Transparency is
necessary for our nation.” </p>
<p>Among other stories, Fish has reported on how the Colorado Republican
Party under Williams’ leadership paid for mailers that subtly attacked
one of Williams’ primary opponents, and that fundraising slowed under
his chairmanship.</p>

id="trump-ex-deputy-weisselberg-sentenced-to-five-months-for-perjury">Trump
ex-deputy Weisselberg sentenced to five months for perjury</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — Former Trump Organization Chief Financial Officer Allen
Weisselberg was sentenced on Wednesday to five months in jail after
pleading guilty last month to perjury charges for lying to investigators
and a judge about Donald Trump’s finances.</p>
<p>Judge Laurie Peterson handed down the sentence at a hearing in
Manhattan criminal court. The sentence was in line with the punishment
the judge said she would impose at Weisselberg’s March 4 plea hearing.
 </p>
<p>Court officers led Weisselberg out of the courtroom in handcuffs
following a brief hearing. </p>
<p>The sentence marks the second stint behind bars for the former U.S.
president’s longtime loyal deputy.  </p>
<p>Weisselberg, 76, spent around three months in New York’s Rikers
Island jail in 2023 after pleading guilty to participating in a 15-year
tax fraud scheme at the Trump Organization. </p>
<p>The perjury charges stem from Weisselberg’s testimony at a civil
fraud case New York state Attorney General Letitia James brought against
Trump, Weisselberg and other executives at Trump’s family real estate
company for manipulating property values to dupe lenders and
insurers. </p>
<p>Weisselberg testified at the trial on Oct. 10 that he was not
involved in an incorrect valuation of Trump’s Manhattan townhouse.
Trump’s 2015 and 2016 financial statements valued the unit at $327
million based on its stated size of more than 30,000 square feet, nearly
three times the actual size. </p>
<p>Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s office, which brought the
charges against Weisselberg, said the former CFO’s emails showed he was
in fact paying close attention to the apartment.  </p>
<p>Weisselberg also admitted to lying about his role in Trump’s
financial statements during two earlier depositions with James’ office.
James’ investigation culminated in a $454 million penalty imposed on
Trump for fraudulently valuing properties. Trump is appealing the order
by Justice Arthur Engoron.  </p>
<p>Engoron also ordered Weisselberg to pay $1.1 million including
interest. </p>
<p>Weisselberg worked for the former president’s family for half a
century. His written plea agreement did not indicate if he would be
cooperating with Bragg’s office. </p>
<p>Trump is set to go on trial starting on Monday on criminal charges of
covering up $130,000 in hush money his former lawyer Michael Cohen paid
porn star Stormy Daniels for her silence before the 2016 election about
a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump in 2006. </p>
<p>Trump has pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business
records and denies any such encounter with Daniels, whose real name is
Stephanie Clifford. </p>
<p>The case, also brought by Bragg, is poised to be the first-ever
criminal trial of a former U.S. president. Trump also faces three other
indictments, which stem from his efforts to overturn his 2020 election
loss and his handling of sensitive government documents. He has pleaded
not guilty to all charges.</p>

id="why-does-part-of-the-windows-98-setup-program-look-older-than-the-rest">“Why
does part of the Windows 98 Setup program look older than the
rest?”</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>Well, this is something I never knew. Over on the retrocomputing
section of StackExchange, someone asked why the second phase of the
Windows 98 installation looked decidedly different from the third phase,
even though they’re both graphical phases (the first phase is textual).
The answer turns out to be both surprising, and entirely predictable.
The first phase is a DOS program called DOSSETUP.BIN, which is the
infamous blue part of the installation. The second part, however, is
what we’re interested in here, and if the first phase is DOS, and the
third phase is Windows 98 itself… What do you think the second phase is
running? Yeah, exactly. Basically, because it is running under Windows
3.1 at that point. The second uses this minimal Windows 3.1 to run a
Windows 3 program, W98SETUP.BIN (specified as the “shell” in
SYSTEM.INI). This starts by copying more files to support all the
information-gathering during setup, and various other niceties including
the 3D look shown in your screenshot (the contents of the PRECOPY CABs);
it ends by copying most of Windows 98, setting the system up so that it
will boot Windows 98 from the target drive, and rebooting. ↫ Stephen
Kitt So, in order to install Windows 98, you first run DOS, followed by
Windows 3.1, ending in Windows 98. I have no idea why this is so funny
to me, especially since it fits entirely within expectations of how
Microsoft does things.</p>

<p>For me, using FSD in my Tesla is like riding a roller coaster. I
don’t trust the car not to kill me though. I spend most of my working
life dealing with bugs in software. It’s very easy for me to imagine
what could go wrong. I don’t understand how people can trust a computer
with their lives this way. It’s also disconcerting that the car coming
at me in the other direction could be computer-driven. And nowadays when
I see the other car is a Tesla, esp this month when everyone’s getting a
free demo of FSD, it’s somewhat likely the OP is a computer.</p>

If you are wondering what any of this has to do with climate change,

to <em><em>Vox</em></em>. “We talk about climate change and chemical
exposure as two separate issues, but we should start thinking about them
together. As we move away from fossil fuel combustion and towards
renewable energy, the industry is going to turn their products into
plastics and synthetic chemicals.”

to</a> <em><em>The Associated Press</em></em>. The change is “the
biggest shift in wildfire management in decades.” It involves creating
more leadership teams – the top-level crewmembers who take on the
biggest and most complex fires – and recruiting a lot of new wildland
firefighters. The Forest Service aims to hire around 11,300 firefighters
this year, <em><em>AP</em></em> reports. While in the past many
firefighting jobs were seasonal, a longer season calls for more
permanent positions. Fire season is already underway. More than 2,669
square miles burned in the first three months of 2024, more than half of
last year’s total.

sterilizer) and chloroprene (used to make rubber). Manufacturers will
now have to monitor their operations for emissions of these two

Indian migrants chart new path to US via Canada</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — In recent years, the United States has seen an
unprecedented surge in undocumented migrants from India, most slipping
in through Mexico. But as the U.S.-Mexico border faces growing pressure,
many are turning to a less conventional path: crossing the expansive and
lightly guarded border with Canada.  </p>
<p>In fiscal year 2023, U.S. border agents encountered nearly 97,000
undocumented Indian migrants nationwide, including more than 30,000 at
the northern border, according to data from the Customs and Border
Patrol or CBP.   </p>
<p>Encounters include apprehensions and expulsions. In fiscal year 2019,
more than 16,000 Indian migrants were encountered nationwide, CBP data
shows.   </p>
<p>In recent months, the numbers have continued largely unabated.
Between October 2023 and February 2024, nearly 14,000 Indians were
encountered at the U.S.-Canada border.  </p>
<p>The record influx is part of a migration rush through Canada that has
overwhelmed border security officials and unsettled communities in
northern U.S. states. CBP data show that there were nearly 190,000
encounters at the Canadian border in 2023, more than six times the
number in 2021.  </p>
<p>A spokesperson for the Indian embassy in Washington said the “extent
of illegal immigration from India to the United States is unclear.” </p>
<p>“We have been constantly engaged with the United States authorities
including through dialogues such as the India- U.S. Consular Dialogue
and the Homeland Security Dialogue to enhance cooperation and strengthen
people to people ties and to facilitate legal mobility and migration and
to check illegal immigration and human trafficking,” the spokesperson
said in a statement to VOA. </p>
<p>Indians drawn to US asylum process </p>
<p>The end of the COVID-19 pandemic has spawned a rise in global
migration. While people migrate for different reasons, experts say many
Indian migrants are drawn to the U.S. by the Biden administration’s
perceived openness to asylum-seekers.  </p>
<p>“Overall, people are looking to come to the U.S. because they’ve
heard about the asylum process here,” said Chirag Patel, a
Maryland-based immigration lawyer who handles Indian asylum cases.  </p>
<p>Patel and other experts say the flow of asylum-seekers to the border
will likely keep up as they anticipate potential policy changes with the
November U.S. presidential election.  </p>
<p>“People are trying to get a lot of things in before November, but
also obviously before January, if November ends up being in favor of
Trump,” Patel said.  </p>
<p>‘From all over the globe’</p>
<p>Once a trickle, the flood of Indian asylum-seekers entering the
country shows the changing face of unauthorized migration to the U.S.
 </p>
<p>“They’re coming from all over the globe, literally all over the
globe,” said Muzaffar Chishti, senior fellow at the Migration Policy
Institute.  </p>
<p>The rise in unauthorized Indian migration has made Indians the
third-largest group of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. There were
about 725,000 undocumented Indians in the U.S. in 2021, more than from
any other country outside the Western Hemisphere, according to a recent
Pew Research Center report.  </p>
<p>Though many have genuine claims of persecution, experts say Indian
asylum-seekers are predominantly economic migrants, drawn by the
prospect of a better life in the U.S.  </p>
<p>“Very few of these are the professionals,” said Devesh Kapur, Starr
Foundation professor of South Asian studies at Johns Hopkins University.
“Because these youths are not very well-educated, their economic
opportunities in India are pretty limited.” </p>
<p>Most are relatively well off by Indian standards and hail from Punjab
and Gujarat, two of India’s more prosperous states with a long history
of immigration to the United States.  </p>
<p>“One of the mistakes we make is to think it’s the poor that migrate,”
Kapur said. “The poor in South Asia simply cannot afford to take a
flight.”  </p>
<p>But those who can often lack a legal pathway into the United States.
U.S. student visas are hard to come by, and because of a massive backlog
of immigration cases, an immigrant visa can take up to 20 years to
secure.  </p>
<p>That leaves the “donkey route” as the only option for many Indians
anxious to reach America. The sometimes-dangerous journey across several
continents, widely publicized on social media, is facilitated for a
hefty fee by global human trafficking networks.  </p>
<p>The cost of getting to the U.S. can exceed $50,000, but even a
small-scale landlord in Punjab can afford it. An acre of agricultural
land in the fertile state can command the same price, Kapur noted.
   </p>
<p>While Indian migrants often take the donkey route to Mexico, many
find Canada a quicker and safer option, according to experts.    </p>
<p>Political scientist Shinder Purewal said the current Canadian
government’s push to attract international students has made it easier
for Indians to obtain visas.   </p>
<p>“It’s easier to get a visa to Canada than to Pakistan,” said Purewal,
who teaches at Kwantlen Polytechnic University in Surrey, British
Columbia.  </p>
<p>Until recently, Indians often moved from Canada to the U.S. when they
couldn’t get Canadian residency, Purewal said.  </p>
<p>“Now, more and more people are just entering Canada so they can just
go straight to the U.S. because the economy is better, job prospects are
better there,” Purewal said.  </p>
<p>In a statement, Canada’s immigration agency said all study permits
are reviewed “holistically” to ensure applicants “respect Canada’s
immigration laws and regulations.” </p>
<p>“Canada’s visa policy decisions are made in an effort to support
travel and people-to-people connections, while preserving the integrity
of our immigration system,” the agency said. “We continuously monitor
the impacts of our visa policy for both visa-exempt and visa-required
countries and consider objective criteria when deciding whether to lift
or impose a visa requirement. And new developments would be communicated
publicly.” </p>
<p>But economic prospects are not the only reason Indian migrants choose
the U.S. Support from established Indian communities in the U.S. also
influence their decision.  </p>
<p>A smuggling network recently uncovered by U.S. investigators ferried
Gujarati migrants from the Canadian border to Gujarati American-owned
business establishments in the Chicago area.  </p>
<p>“People who come have a way of coming,” said Pawan Dhingra, an
associate provost and associate dean of the faculty at Amherst College
who teaches immigration studies. “They have a connection to the country.
If it was just escaping India, they could just go anywhere in the
world.”  </p>
<p>Not all cross border safely</p>
<p>Despite its reputation for safety, crossing the Canadian border has
occasionally proven fatal for Indian migrants. </p>
<p>In January 2022, an Indian family of four was found frozen to death
in Manitoba just meters from the U.S. border. In March 2023, the bodies
of eight migrants, including four Indians, were recovered from the
St. Lawrence River.    </p>
<p>Maureen Silcoff, a Canadian refugee and immigration lawyer, said the
extreme risks migrants take show their dire need to flee hardship.  </p>
<p>“People don’t simply pick up and leave their homes, their
communities, their families, their jobs out of a sense of wanting a
thrilling adventure,” Silcoff said in an interview. “People become
desperate, and sometimes people are subject to very serious human rights
abuses, and they try to alleviate those kinds of problems and other
hardships by relocating to another country.”  </p>

<p class="drop-caps">
Can capitalism solve climate change? Wrong question, argues the author
and journalist Akshat Rathi: In fact, you can’t solve climate change
<em>without</em> capitalism. Look around the world, as Rathi does in his
new book <em>Climate Capitalism</em>, and he says you’ll find companies
and leaders who are proving that cutting carbon emissions is not just
possible, but also profitable.
</p>
<p>
The venture capitalist Sophie Purdom, the founder of Planeteer Capital,
spends her days looking for those profitable climate companies. She says
that a newer, smarter generation of climate startups is on the way.
</p>
<p>
In this week’s episode, recorded earlier this month live at Princeton
University, Rob and Jesse host a special in-person conversation with
Rathi and Purdom. They talk about the rise of Chinese EVs, what interest
rates mean for the energy transition, and the proper role of policy in
decarbonizing. Shift Key is hosted by Robinson Meyer, executive editor
of Heatmap, and Jesse Jenkins, a Princeton professor of energy systems
engineering.

Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Robinson Meyer: </strong>I guess a question I’d have, maybe, for
both of you is, how much of this is a China story? How much of the
amount of progress that we’ve been able to do is actually because of
Chinese industrial policies — the sheer scale of the Chinese market and
the different incentives that exist on the demand side there to bring
down the cost of solar, or batteries, or any of these technologies that
are now the main engines of decarbonization?<br/><br/><strong>Sophie
Purdom:</strong> I think so much about the supply side of the market,
right? Those solutions and the innovation, which then kind of ideally
ports over, if you succeed, into deployment, which has its own set of
challenges and concerns and capital levers and policy integrations. I’d
argue that the U. S. overall sits further on the supply versus demand
side, relative to a global positioning, and that China’s been playing
the demand side of the game much better. <br/><br/><strong>Akshat Rathi:
</strong>The beauty of wanting to do this book was, to me, watching
these lessons. So if you look at the solar story: invented in America;
really scaled up in Europe, when Germany and Spain were providing a ton
of subsidies for solar manufacturers to put rooftop solar in the early
2000s; and then really scaled up in China when they made a ton more
capital available and just flooded the market, so to
speak.<br/><br/>Take the electric vehicle story, a very different one
because the new energy vehicle policy that made China the biggest maker
and consumer — and now exporter — of electric cars actually takes
inspiration from California’s zero emissions policy. It’s a vehicle
mandate, right? So you have this policy that kind of worked in one
state, forced the rest of America to think about it, but China just
applied it nationwide and ran with it. So you can apply lessons from one
country to another and have policies — one of those beautiful things,
which, it can translate if you can tweak it to work in that political
economy where it needs to operate.<br/><br/><strong>Jesse Jenkins:
</strong>Let’s talk a little bit more about the particular form of
climate capitalism with Chinese characteristics, how this sort of worked
out. There’s a couple of case studies in the book of CATL and BYD and
how they have come about. One of the things I want to underscore is,
we’ve talked about how American-centric we often are. We sort of think,
well, we got to drive all of this. But China increasingly is the world’s
biggest market for all of these solutions, right? For EVs, for solar PV.
They’re also, in many cases, the world’s largest manufacturer. And the
scales are just staggering. <br/><br/>Now, I mean, we in the U.S.
deployed just shy of 40 gigawatts of solar last year, something like 36
to 38 gigawatts. China deployed 280 gigawatts. More than half of the
global market for solar was in China last year. So it’s not … They
started off selling to Spain and Germany, but now, their domestic market
is enormous. You can tell a very similar story about EVs, where more
than half of the market for EVs is in China — increasingly, more than
half of the manufacturing, and now, rapidly, exports too. So what is the
flavor of the capitalism story there?<br/><br/>Because many of these
companies are state-owned enterprises, at least partially, there’s a
strong hand of industrial policy guiding where investment occurs and
making it cheaper, and giving free land, and all kinds of different
things there. But of course, at the end of the day, there is a lot of …
it is in many ways capitalism. There’s a lot of financial motivation
that has led these companies to scale and grow.

<h2 id="carbon-removals-100-billion-conundrum">Carbon Removal’s $100
Billion Conundrum</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-10, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTk2MTQ0MC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2NDM4NDA4MX0.negH_EUPaUvtAvIIEJy3fqgcwkE561qCCndZPX_QLTU/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Money seems to be pouring into the field of carbon removal from every
direction. Every other week there’s an announcement about a
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/carbon-removal-orchard-one-spiritus" target="_self">new
project</a>. Multimillion dollar
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/heirloom-carbon-microsoft-removal" target="_self">carbon
removal procurement deals</a> are on the rise. The Department of Energy
is
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/project-cypress-climeworks-heirloom" target="_self">rolling
out grants</a> as part of its $3.5 billion “direct air capture” hubs
program and also funding research and development. Some carbon removal
companies can even start claiming a $130 tax credit for every ton of CO2
they suck up and store underground.
</p>
<p>
The federal government alone spends
<a href="https://carbon180.org/carbon-removal-funding-tracker/#total-funding" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">just
under $1 billion per year</a> on carbon removal research, development,
and deployment. According to a
<a href="https://rhg.com/research/carbon-dioxide-removal-us-policy/" target="_blank">new
report</a> from the Rhodium Group, however, the U.S. is going to have to
spend a lot more — roughly <em>$100 billion</em> per year by 2050 — if
carbon dioxide removal, or CDR, is ever going to become a viable climate
solution.
</p>
<p>
“The current level of policy support is nowhere near what’s needed for
CDR to play the role that people say it needs to play in solving climate
change,” Jonathan Larsen, one of the authors, told me. “We wanted to
reset the policy conversation with that in mind.”
</p>
<p>
Carbon removal is what’s implied by the “net” in net-zero — a way to
compensate for whatever polluting activities are going to take longer to
replace with clean solutions. It will be impossible to achieve net-zero
emissions by 2050, either at the national or global level, without
removing carbon from the atmosphere. But how much carbon removal will we
need, and how do we make sure we’re ready to deploy it?
</p>
<p>
These questions are, in a sense, unique to the field. When we talk about
cutting carbon emissions from buildings or transportation, experts are
relatively confident in the set of solutions and the scale of the task —
they know how many buildings and cars there are and can make reasonable
estimates of growth rates.
</p>
<p>
But carbon removal is a moving target. We know how much we’re removing
today — roughly 5 million metric tons, mostly from nature-based
solutions like planting trees. Based on current policies, Rhodium
estimates we could scale that up to about 50 million metric tons by
2035. But figuring out how much we <em>need</em> depends entirely on how
successful we are at decarbonizing everything else. Even if we know we
need to electrify all our cars, for example, no one can say whether that
will happen by 2050, or at least not with any meaningful degree of
certainty.
</p>
<p>
The Rhodium Group report attempts to narrow the range of this
uncertainty so that policymakers can better attack the problem. The
authors looked at a handful of different decarbonization roadmaps for
the U.S. and found that the minimum amount of carbon removal needed to
compensate for residual emissions in 2050 is 1 gigaton, which is the
same as one billion metric tons, or a 20x increase from where current
policies will get us. It’s also equal to about 20% of the carbon that
the U.S. emitted last year. “There’s a very likely scenario where we
need a lot more than that,” said Larsen. “There’s scenarios where we
need less. But most of the studies out there say at least a gigaton.”
</p>
<p>
Even if it’s only a rough estimate, landing on a number is useful, he
told me. Rhodium Group spends a lot of time answering questions about,
for example, what some new policy means for achieving Biden’s goal of
cutting emissions in half by 2030. “I don’t know if we’d get those
questions if there wasn’t a 50% target to shoot for,” he said. “So I
think this way, people can be like, what does this next wave of policy
support for CDR do for getting the U.S. on track for a gigaton?”
</p>
<p>
The level of investment it will take to get there is also highly
uncertain. The authors did a quick back-of-the-envelope calculation to
land on $100 billion by 2050: We need to be removing a minimum of one
billion tons by then, and the Department of Energy has
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/fecm/carbon-negative-shot" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a
goal to bring the cost of carbon removal down</a> to $100 per ton.
</p>
<p>
The meat of the new report focuses on how to bridge the gap between the
roughly $1 billion we spend today and $100 billion, which starts,
according to the authors, with treating carbon removal as a public
service. It’s not like other climate solutions such as wind turbines or
heat pumps, they write, which can rely on private markets to provide
predictable demand or to stimulate innovation. “There are very few
pathways one can envision where the private sector is going to both
scale and deliver those tons,” Larsen told me. Voluntary carbon removal
purchases by companies could play a role, he said, but it will not be
big enough to get to a gigaton.
</p>
<p>
Rhodium recommends expanding and extending many of the federal policy
programs that already exist — by, for example, providing more R&amp;D
funding, doing more
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/carbon-removal-us-government" target="_self">government
procurement</a>, handing out more loan guarantees, and creating more
“hubs” centered on other approaches besides direct air capture, like
<a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-episode-4-enhanced-rock-weathering" target="_self">enhanced
weathering</a> or biomass burial. Right now, the tax credit for
capturing carbon from the air and burying it underground can only be
claimed for 12 years, and projects have to start construction by 2032.
The authors call for extending the claim period and moving up the
construction start deadline. They also recommend expanding the program
to apply to a wider range of carbon removal methods.
</p>
<p>
A common criticism of government support for carbon removal is that
policy makers will over-rely on it. If we aim to do 1 gigaton of carbon
removal, does that mean we won’t cut emissions as much as we could have?
What happens if, for whatever reason, we can’t achieve the 1 gigaton?
</p>
<p>
Larsen disagreed with that framing. For one, it’s easy to turn it
around: If we don’t scale up the capacity to remove carbon, and we also
don’t eliminate emissions by mid-century, we’re not even going to have
the option to halt climate change at that point.
</p>
<p>
But also, decarbonization shouldn’t stop in 2050, he said. If we can
achieve that 1 gigaton of annual removal and then keep cutting emissions
from remaining sources, we could eventually get to net-<em>negative</em>
emissions — even without more CDR. In other words, if we reach a point
where we’re removing more than we’re emitting, we could start to reverse
global warming, not just stop it.
</p>
<p>
“I know that’s, like, sci-fi,” he told me. “But that’s ultimately where
we as a species have to go and that’s why setting a target here of at
least a gigaton, to me, does not take away the need to reduce
elsewhere.”

<p>date: 2024-04-10, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://robhope.com/&quot;&gt;Rob&lt;/a&gt; has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://yo.fm/&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt;. It started way back in 2019—damn time flies—and season 3 just started. If you’re into tech/design give it a listen. But Rob’s podcast is just the excuse I needed to complain about something I find quite annoying: video podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
Season 3 of Yo! is “video first”. Podcasts switching to video to be on
YouTube ranks quite high on the list of things that I find annoying. I
get why they’re doing it. I’m not an idiot. Yet I still find it
annoying. Especially because podcasts that were audio-only would start
referencing and talking about things that are “on the screen right now”
and now I’m missing out on parts of the conversation because I’m
listening to a podcast while I’m driving.
</p>
<p>
Video podcasts are the worst of both worlds. They’re not as good as
actual video content designed to be consumed exclusively as video and
they’re inferior to audio-only podcasts. And if you disagree

id="house-to-delay-sending-mayorkas-impeachment-articles-to-senate">House
to delay sending Mayorkas impeachment articles to Senate</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Speaker Mike Johnson will delay sending the House’s
articles of impeachment against Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro
Mayorkas to the Senate this week as planned after Republican senators
requested more time Tuesday to build support for holding a full
trial.</p>
<p>The sudden change of plans cast fresh doubts on the proceedings, the
historic first impeachment of a Cabinet secretary in roughly 150 years.
Seeking to rebuke the Biden administration’s handling of the southern
border, House Republicans impeached Mayorkas in February but delayed
sending the articles while they finished work on government funding
legislation.</p>
<p>Johnson had planned to send the impeachment charges to the Senate on
Wednesday evening. But as it became clear that Democrats, who hold the
majority of the chamber, had the votes to quickly dismiss them, Senate
Republicans requested that Johnson delay until next week. They hoped the
tactic would prolong the process.</p>
<p>While Republicans argued Tuesday that forgoing a full Senate trial
would break precedent, most Senate Republicans voted to do just that
when Donald Trump, the former president, was impeached a second time on
charges he incited an insurrection in the January 6, 2021, attack on the
Capitol. Their effort to halt the proceedings failed. Trump was
ultimately acquitted in the Senate trial.</p>
<p>“Our members want to have an opportunity not only to debate but also
to have some votes on issues they want to raise,” said South Dakota
Sen. John Thune, the second-ranking Republican Senate leader. Under
procedural rules, senators are required to convene as jurors the day
after the articles of impeachment are transmitted for a trial.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. D-N.Y., who has decried the
impeachment push as a sham, suggested Democrats still plan to deal with
the charges quickly.</p>
<p>“We’re ready to go whenever they are. We are sticking with our plan.
We’re going to move this as expeditiously as possible,” Schumer
said.</p>
<p>“Impeachment should never be used to settle policy disagreements,” he
told reporters earlier Tuesday.</p>
<p>House Republicans charged in two articles of impeachment that
Mayorkas has not only refused to enforce existing law but also breached
the public trust by lying to Congress and saying the border was
secure.</p>
<p>Democrats — and a few Republicans — say the charges amount to a
policy dispute, not the Constitution’s bar of high crimes and
misdemeanors.</p>
<p>“Ultimately, I think it’s virtually certain that there will not be
the conviction of someone when the constitutional test has not been
met,” said Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah.</p>
<p>Still, with elections approaching, Republicans want to force Congress
to grapple with the Biden administration’s handling of the southern
border as long as possible.</p>
<p>“I think there are a lot of Democrats who really want to avoid the
vote. I don’t blame them. I mean, this is the number one issue on the
minds of Americans,” Thune said.</p>
<p>Sen. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat who is facing a tough reelection bid
in Ohio, pointed to Republican senators rejecting a bipartisan deal
aimed at tamping down the number of illegal border crossings from
Mexico.</p>
<p>“Instead of doing this impeachment — the first one in 100 years — why
are we not doing a bipartisan border deal?” Brown said.</p>
<p>Before Mayorkas, only one U.S. Cabinet official had ever been
impeached. Secretary of War William Belknap in 1876. A House
investigation found evidence that he had received kickback payments
while administering government contracts.</p>

Navy leaders seek cooperation with US at annual exposition</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — Taiwan Navy Commander Admiral Tang Hua said during a
trip to Maryland that the self-governing island wants more cooperation
with the U.S. and other countries amid military pressure from China.</p>
<p>But as to whether or not he would hold direct talks with U.S. Chief
of Naval Operations Admiral Lisa Franchetti, as reported by Reuters,
Tang said he would not comment so as to avoid China’s protest causing
trouble to the U.S. side.</p>
<p>Speaking to VOA on Monday at this year’s Sea-Air-Space Conference
hosted by the Navy League of the U.S. at National Harbor, outside of
Washington, Tang said he would meet with navy personnel from the U.S.
and other countries.</p>
<p>“I think the People’s Liberation Army’s problem with Taiwan is not
just about Taiwan,” he said. “It may be in the East China Sea or the
South China Sea. It is a global issue, not an issue specifically
targeting Taiwan.”</p>
<p>Taiwan split from China in 1949 after the nationalists lost to the
communists and fled to the island, where they established a government
that eventually became a democracy.</p>
<p>China claims Taiwan is a breakaway province that must one day reunite
with the mainland, by force if necessary.</p>
<p>China also has territorial disputes with Japan in the East China Sea
and claims most of the South China Sea as its own, putting it in
conflict with Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and
Vietnam.</p>
<p>The U.S. supports a “One China” policy that Beijing is the only
recognized government of China while maintaining non-diplomatic
relations with Taiwan and vowing to defend its right to
self-governance.</p>
<p>In response to a Reuters question at a briefing March 29 about the
Taiwan Navy chief’s trip to the U.S., Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman
Lin Jian said China firmly opposes “military collusion between the U.S.
and Taiwan.”</p>
<p>He urged the U.S. to “immediately stop official interactions and
military contact with Taiwan, and refrain from sending any wrong message
to ‘Taiwan independence’ separatist forces.”</p>
<p>Tang said other countries’ navies at the conference were also looking
to partner up.</p>
<p>“Not only are the U.S. military, but also the navies of various
countries here. In fact, regarding much of our current cooperation, you
just heard them talk about many things, including manpower issues,
shipbuilding issues, and demand and cooperation, so I think on these
occasions, everyone is seeking opportunities for cooperation and
integration,” he said.</p>
<p>Tang, along with Rear Admiral Chung-Hsing Wei, defense attache with
the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the U.S., and
the visiting Taiwan delegation attended meetings and speeches of naval
leaders from the U.S. and other countries.</p>
<p>He also visited the booths of major U.S. military manufacturers at
the exhibition, including Lockheed Martin and Raytheon, and inquired
about weapons and equipment with companies that have procurement
projects with Taiwan.</p>
<p>This included General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, which produced
four MQ-9B “SkyGuardian” drones for Taipei.</p>
<p>A senior official from the company also told him that he will join a
U.S. Taiwan Business Council delegation to visit Taiwan in early
June.</p>

pushes back at Russia’s protest over South Korean sanctions</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The United States is welcoming South Korean sanctions
imposed on Russian vessels suspected of transporting weapons from North
Korea, despite Russian protests. </p>
<p>“We applaud the recent actions taken by the ROK to disrupt and expose
arms transfers between the DPRK and Russia – including the sanctions …
on two Russian vessels involved in arms transfers to Russia,” a State
Department spokesperson said.</p>
<p>“It is important for the international community to send a strong,
unified message that the DPRK must halt its irresponsible behavior,
abide by its obligations under U.N. Security Council resolutions, and
engage in serious and sustained diplomacy,” the spokesperson said Friday
via email to the VOA Korean Service.</p>
<p>South Korea on April 2 unilaterally sanctioned two Russian vessels
involved in delivering military supplies from North Korea to Russia.
 </p>
<p>The next day at a press briefing, Russian Foreign Ministry
spokesperson Maria Zakharova called Seoul’s move “an unfriendly step”
that “leads only to escalation of tensions” and “will affect South
Korea-Russia relations in a negative way.” </p>
<p>She said Moscow would respond to the sanctions but did not specify
how. </p>
<p>On Friday, Russia said it had summoned South Korea’s ambassador.
 </p>
<p>The South Korean sanctions followed Russia’s veto of a U.N. Security
Council resolution calling for the annual extension of the U.N. experts
panel that monitors sanctions on North Korea. The panel’s mandate ends
at the end of April.</p>
<p>The ties between Pyongyang and Moscow have been growing since a
summit in September. Since then, North Korea has been providing
munitions that Russia needs to fight its war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>“The ROK government getting involved in applying sanctions, seizures,
and other active counterproliferation authorities and capabilities
against the North is a huge step forward in joint cooperation to
counter, protect and contain the DPRK regime’s weapons exports,” said
David Asher, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute.   </p>
<p>Asher worked on disrupting North Korea’s illicit financial, trading
and weapons of mass destruction networks under the George W. Bush
administration.</p>
<p>In an email to VOA on Monday, Asher added, “I fully expect
ROK-U.S.-Japan cooperation to expand in counterproliferation, including
the identification and targeting of weapons supply networks using
intelligence operations, law enforcement, and sanctions.”</p>
<p>A day after announcing the sanctions, Seoul said it had seized a
vessel that was suspected of violating U.N. sanctions on North Korea.
South Korea said it was investigating the DEYI, a cargo ship that was en
route to Russia from North Korea via China, after seizing it in waters
off the South Korean port city of Yeosu.</p>
<p>“This reinforces that countries can implement U.N. sanctions, on
their own, as they have responsibility to do so,” especially after
Russia blocked the U.N. experts panel’s mandate, said Anthony Ruggiero,
senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. Ruggiero has
over 19 years working on financial sanctions and proliferation issues,
including ones involving North Korea.</p>
<p>There is a broad international and domestic set of legal authorities
that countries like South Korea could rely on to go after illicit
exports and maritime activities by North Korea, but it is a matter of
“whether countries are willing to stop” vessels making illegal actions,
Ruggiero said during a telephone interview on Monday. </p>
<p>A U.N. Security Council resolution passed in 2017 authorizes member
states to seize, inspect, freeze and impound vessels in their
territorial waters found to be conducting illicit activities with
Pyongyang and carrying banned goods from North Korea.  </p>
<p>A State Department spokesperson told VOA’s Korean Service on Thursday
that the U.S. is “coordinating closely with the ROK in its investigation
of this ship in connection with U.N. sanctions violations.”</p>
<p>“Despite Russia’s veto of the 1718 Committee Panel of Experts mandate
in order to bury reporting on its violation of U.S. Security Council
resolutions, U.N. sanctions on the DPRK remain in place, and all U.N.
member states are still required to implement them,” the spokesperson
said.</p>
<p>Nate Evans, the spokesperson for the U.S. Mission to the U.N., said
Monday that U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield will
travel to South Korea and Japan next week to discuss ways to monitor
international sanctions on North Korea.</p>
<p>South Korea estimated in March that North Korea has shipped about
7,000 containers full of munitions to Russia since last year. The U.S.
assessed the same month the number of containers to be 10,000.</p>
<p>Joshua Stanton, an attorney based in Washington who helped draft the
Sanctions and Policy Enforcement Act in 2016, told VOA on Monday via
email that Seoul could seize ships carrying weapons from North Korea to
Russia if certain criteria are met. </p>
<p>Seoul could do so “if South Korea has reasonable cause to believe
that the vessel is engaged in sanctions evasion, and if one of the
following conditions is also met: the [vessel’s] flag state consents,
the vessel is stateless, or the ship enters a South Korean port.”</p>

<h2 id="deep-bug">Deep Bug</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-10, from: Marginallia log</p>
<p>The project has been haunted by a mysterious bug since sometime
February. It relates to the code that constructs the index, particularly
the code that merges partial indices. In short the search engine
constucts the reverse index through successive merging of smaller
indices, which reduces the overall memory requirement. You can
conceptualize the revese index itself as two files, one with offset
pointers into another file, which has sorted numbers. This code runs
after each partition finishes crawling and processing its data, and has
a run time of about 4 hours.</p>
