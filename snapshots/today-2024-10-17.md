## Volla Phone Quintus is a smartphone that’s also part of a distributed cloud, supports Android or Ubuntu Touch

date: 2024-10-17, from: Liliputing

<p>German device maker Volla has been shipping smartphones and tablets that run a custom version of Android called Volla OS for a few years. And up until now one of the main reasons I&#8217;ve paid attention to his relatively small company is because they&#8217;ve also supported installing Ubuntu Touch as an alternate operating system sine [&#8230;]</p>

Bloggers, here&#39;s an idea. When you write a piece you&#39;re proud of, end it with a sentence like this: &quot;And that&#39;s why I have a blog.&quot; It plants a seed, which through repetition and appearing in many places, might help people appreciate the purpose of a blog. We&#39;ve had a lot of mud slung at us, let&#39;s start undoing it.

## Seattle Xcoders 20th Anniversary Meetup

date: 2024-10-17, from: Innessential (Brint Simmons' blog)

<p>This Thursday, Oct. 17, 2024, is the 20th anniversary of the Seattle Xcoders! We’d love to see you there, at 7 pm at <a href="https://www.bbycballard.com/">Bale Breaker and Yonder Cider taproom</a> in Ballard.</p>

<p>Everyone is welcome! It’s not just for people who write code — it’s for designers, testers, support folks, and everyone who helps make Apple-ecosystem apps. Even if you just <em>like</em> those kinds of apps and like talking about them, come join us!</p>

<p>We’re usually outside by these propane fire things, but I’m not sure this time — we might have a room or some area or something. We should be easy to find, at any rate.</p>

<p>It’s not actually a meeting with presentations — it’s just hanging out and talking. Which we do every first, third, and fifth Thursday (you can <a href="webcal://p25-caldav.icloud.com/published/2/Nzc2ODExNzg3NzY4MTE3OA8zb_qUej-fZsXG-_oJak3bJvjP8RcHmIEZ0WxGu2kWkvciKC5Sm6Xm5sHZRUHdZPM3KQg8-b2iwsMIEOTWlJo">subscribe to our calendar</a>). One of these days we’ll get back to presentations — but the social part is valuable, and so we keep it up.</p>

<p>PS Looks like the food truck is Impeckable Chicken, which I’ve heard good things about. :)</p>

<p>PPS I’m usually easy to spot: quite well into middle age, with nothing like the amount of hair I once had. Black jeans, usually a black sweatshirt. Glasses. Doc Martens. Not tall.</p>

## SSH Into Any Private Host With Inlets Cloud

When you’re away from home it’s not only convenient, but often necessary to connect back to your machines. This could be to connect to a remote VSCode instance, run a backup, check on a process, or to debug a problem. SSH can also be used to port-forward services, or to copy files with scp or rsync.

## AI PCs aren’t very good at AI

## Huawei’s Android-free ‘HarmonyOS NEXT’ will go live next week

date: 2024-10-16, from: OS News

Earlier this year we talked about Huawei&#8217;s HarmonyOS NEXT, which is most likely the only serious competitor to Android and iOS in the world. HarmonyOS started out as a mere Android skin, but over time Huawei invested heavily into the platform to expand it into a full-blown, custom operating system with a custom programming language, and it seems the company is finally ready to take the plunge and release HarmonyOS NEXT into the wild. It’s indicated that HarmonyOS made up 17% of China’s smartphone market in Q1 of 2024. That’s a significant amount of potential devices breaking off from Android in a market dominated by either it or iOS. HarmonyOS NEXT is set to begin rolling out to Huawei devices next week. The OS will first come to the Mate 60, Mate X5, and MatePad Pro on October 15. ↫ Andrew Romero at 9To5Google Huawei has been hard at work making sure there&#8217;s no &#8216;application gap&#8217; for people using HarmonyOS NEXT, claiming it has 10000 applications ready to go that cover &#8220;99.9%&#8221; of their users&#8217; use case. That&#8217;s quite impressive, but of course, we&#8217;ll have to wait and see if the numbers line up with the reality on the ground for Chinese consumers. Here in the est HarmonyOS NEXT is unlikely to gain any serious traction, but that doesn&#8217;t mean I would mind taking a look at the platform if at all possible. It&#8217;s honestly not surprising the most serious attempt at creating a third mobile ecosystem is coming from China, because here in the west the market is so grossly rusted shut we&#8217;re going to be stuck with Android and iOS until the day I die.

## Google is preparing to let you run Linux apps on Android, just like Chrome OS

date: 2024-10-16, from: OS News

Engineers at Google started work on a new Terminal app for Android a couple of weeks ago. This Terminal app is part of the Android Virtualization Framework (AVF) and contains a WebView that connects to a Linux virtual machine via a local IP address, allowing you to run Linux commands from the Android host. Initially, you had to manually enable this Terminal app using a shell command and then configure the Linux VM yourself. However, in recent days, Google began work on integrating the Terminal app into Android as well as turning it into an all-in-one app for running a Linux distro in a VM. ↫ Mishaal Rahman at Android Authority There already are a variety of ways to do this today, but having it as a supported feature implemented by Google is very welcome. This is also going to greatly increase the number of spammy articles and lazy YouTube videos telling you how to &#8220;run Ubuntu on your phone&#8221;, which I&#8217;m not particularly looking forward to.

Sara Silverman is the author of The Bedwetter, a comedy memoir.  Richard Kadrey wrote Sandman Slim, a fantasy novel series. Christopher Golden, a supernatural thriller titled Ararat.  These authors might not seem to have much in common with an academic author who writes in history, physics, or chemistry. Or a journalist. Or a poet. Or, [&#8230;]

Never before has a presidential nominee openly suggested turning the military on Americans simply because they oppose his candidacy. With voting underway, Donald Trump has turned to dark vows of retribution.

## GHC 9.12.1-alpha1 is now available

date: 2024-10-16, from: Glasgow Haskell Compiler

<h1>GHC 9.12.1-alpha1 is now available</h1>
<h4 class="text-muted">Zubin Duggal - 2024-10-16</h4>

<p>The GHC developers are very pleased to announce the availability
of the first alpha release of GHC 9.12.1. Binary distributions, source
distributions, and documentation are available at <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/9.12.1-alpha1">downloads.haskell.org</a>.</p>
<p>We hope to have this release available via ghcup shortly.</p>
<p>GHC 9.12 will bring a number of new features and improvements, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The new language extension <a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0522-or-patterns.rst">OrPatterns</a> allowing you to combine multiple
pattern clauses into one.</p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0569-multiline-strings.rst">MultilineStrings</a> language extension to allow you to more easily write
strings spanning multiple lines in your source code.</p></li>
<li><p>Improvements to the OverloadedRecordDot extension, allowing the built-in
<code>HasField</code> class to be used for records with fields of non lifted representations.</p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0409-exportable-named-default.rst">NamedDefaults</a> language extension has been introduced allowing you to
define defaults for typeclasses other than <code>Num</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>More deterministic object code output, controlled by the <code>-fobject-determinism</code>
flag, which improves determinism of builds a lot (though does not fully do so)
at the cost of some compiler performance (1-2%). See <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/12935">#12935</a> for the details</p></li>
<li><p>GHC now accepts type syntax in expressions as part of <a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0281-visible-forall.rst">GHC Proposal <span>#281</span></a>.</p></li>
<li><p>… and many more</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A full accounting of changes can be found in the <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/9.12.1-alpha1/docs/users_guide/9.12.1-notes.html">release notes</a>.
As always, GHC’s release status, including planned future releases, can
be found on the GHC Wiki <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/GHC-status">status</a>.</p>
<p>We would like to thank GitHub, IOG, the Zw3rk stake pool,
Well-Typed, Tweag I/O, Serokell, Equinix, SimSpace, the Haskell
Foundation, and other anonymous contributors whose on-going financial
and in-kind support has facilitated GHC maintenance and release
management over the years. Finally, this release would not have been
possible without the hundreds of open-source contributors whose work
comprise this release.</p>
<p>As always, do give this release a try and open a <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/new">ticket</a> if you see
anything amiss.</p>
