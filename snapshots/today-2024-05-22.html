judge hears Trump bid to dismiss documents charges</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Miami, Florida — A Florida judge was holding a hearing Wednesday on a
bid by former U.S. President Donald Trump to dismiss the charges he
faces for allegedly mishandling classified documents.</p>
<p>The hearing is being held in Fort Pierce, Florida, before District
Judge Aileen Cannon, who has already indefinitely postponed Trump’s
criminal trial in that case.</p>
<p>Trump, who is seeking to recapture the White House in November, and a
co-defendant, his valet Walt Nauta, have filed separate motions with
Cannon seeking to have the case thrown out.</p>
<p>Trump pleaded not guilty in Florida in June to the federal charges of
unlawfully retaining national defense information, conspiracy to
obstruct justice and making false statements.</p>
<p>He kept the classified files — which included records from the
Pentagon, CIA and National Security Agency — unsecured at his Mar-a-Lago
home in Florida and thwarted official efforts to retrieve them,
according to the indictment.</p>
<p>Trump — who is currently on trial in New York, accused in a separate
case of falsifying business records to pay hush money to a porn star —
is not expected to attend Wednesday’s proceedings.</p>
<p>The dismissal motion is the latest of several that Trump’s lawyers
have unsuccessfully filed with Cannon in a bid to have the charges
tossed out.</p>
<p>The hearing is the first in the case since Cannon, on May 7,
indefinitely postponed Trump’s trial, which had been scheduled to begin
this month.</p>
<p>Cannon, a Trump appointee, said the planned May 20 start date was not
possible because of the number of pretrial motions before the court.</p>
<p>The postponement was a major setback for special counsel Jack Smith,
who brought the charges against Trump, and makes it unlikely the case
will be heard before the presidential election — now less than six
months away.</p>
<p>Trump’s attorneys have sought to delay his various criminal cases
until after the election, when Trump could potentially have the federal
charges against him dropped if he wins.</p>
<p>In addition to the New York and Florida cases, Trump has also been
charged in Washington and Georgia with trying to overturn the results of
the 2020 election won by Democrat Joe Biden, his likely November
opponent.</p>

in Tennessee blocks effort to put Elvis Presley’s former home Graceland
up for sale</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MEMPHIS, Tenn. — A Tennessee judge on Wednesday blocked the auction
of Graceland, the former home of Elvis Presley, by a company that
claimed his estate failed to repay a loan that used the property as
collateral. </p>
<p>Shelby County Chancellor JoeDae Jenkins issued a temporary injunction
against the proposed auction that had been scheduled for Thursday this
week. Jenkins’ injunction essentially keeps in place a previous
restraining order that he had issued after Presley’s granddaughter Riley
Keough filed a lawsuit to fight off what she said was a fraudulent
scheme. </p>
<p>A public notice for a foreclosure sale of the 13-acre estate in
Memphis posted earlier in May said Promenade Trust, which controls the
Graceland museum, owes $3.8 million after failing to repay a 2018 loan.
Keough, an actor, inherited the trust and ownership of the home after
the death of her mother, Lisa Marie Presley, last year. </p>
<p>Naussany Investments and Private Lending said Lisa Marie Presley had
used Graceland as collateral for the loan, according to the foreclosure
sale notice. Keough, on behalf of the Promenade Trust, alleged in her
lawsuit that Naussany presented fraudulent documents regarding the loan
in September 2023. </p>
<p>Neither Keough nor lawyers for Nassauny Investments were in court
Wednesday. </p>
<p>“Lisa Maria Presley never borrowed money from Naussany Investments
and never gave a deed of trust to Naussany Investments,” Keough’s lawyer
wrote in a lawsuit. </p>
<p>Kimberly Philbrick, the notary whose name is listed on Nassauny’s
documents, indicated that she never met Lisa Marie Presley nor notarized
any documents for her, the court filing said. </p>
<p>Graceland opened as a museum and tourist attraction in 1982 as a
tribute to Elvis Presley, the singer and actor who died in August 1977
at age 42. It draws hundreds of thousands of visitors each year. A large
Presley-themed entertainment complex across the street from the museum
is owned by Elvis Presley Enterprises.</p>

The high tech industry has been grappling with a downturn in recent

Texas is a bit sunnier than in other parts of the country. Why is that?
Then, Lowe’s and Target feel the effects of a pinched consumer, and
sugar production — once Cuba’s most important and profitable trade — is
nearing collapse.

id="white-house-chef-duo-has-dished-up-culinary-diplomacy-at-state-dinners-for-nearly-a-decade">White
House chef duo has dished up culinary diplomacy at state dinners for
nearly a decade</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — A house-cured smoked salmon, red grapefruit, avocado and
cucumber starter. Dry-aged rib eye beef in a sesame sabayon sauce.
Salted caramel pistachio cake under a layer of matcha ganache.</p>
<p>While President Joe Biden and his guest of honor at a White House
state dinner chew over foreign policy, the female chef duo of Cris
Comerford and Susie Morrison take care of the culinary diplomacy. They
pulled off the above menu for Japan’s leader in April, and they’ll have
a new array of delicacies for Kenya’s president on Thursday night.</p>
<p>Comerford, the White House executive chef, and Morrison, the
executive pastry chef, are the first women to hold those posts, forming
a duo that has tantalized the taste buds of guests at 1600 Pennsylvania
Ave. with their culinary creations for nearly a decade. Comerford is
also the first person of color to be executive chef.</p>
<p>“Both are just exceptional examples of success in their field,” said
Bill Yosses, who was the executive pastry chef for seven years before
his departure in 2014 cleared the way for Morrison to be promoted. “They
excel at what they do.”</p>
<p>Comerford and Morrison get to do it again Thursday when Biden and his
wife, first lady Jill Biden, host the administration’s sixth state
dinner, for Kenyan President William Ruto and his wife, Rachel. It will
be the first such honor for an African head of state since 2008 and the
first for Kenya since 2003.</p>
<p>A lavish state dinner is a tool of U.S. diplomacy, a high honor
reserved for America’s longstanding and closest allies. In the case of
Kenya, Biden wants to elevate a relationship that he sees as critical to
security in Africa and far beyond.</p>
<p>Jill Biden planned to preview the dinner setup for the news media on
Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>State dinner planning is done by the first lady’s staff and the White
House social office, and starts months in advance. Ideas are kicked
around before the chefs propose a few different menus. The meals are
prepared, plated as they would be served and tasted by the social
secretary and the first lady, who makes the final call on what will be
served.</p>
<p>The menus change, but the overarching goal has stayed the same.</p>
<p>“We’re trying to showcase American food, American regions, American
farmers,” while incorporating small tributes to the guest of honor,
Yosses said. “It would be rare that we would really try to imitate
something from the guest’s country.”</p>
<p>Ingredients for April’s state dinner for Japanese Prime Minister
Fumio Kishida and his wife, Yuko, came from California, Maryland, Oregon
and Ohio. The wines were from Oregon and Washington state.</p>
<p>At the media preview for that glitzy event, Comerford explained that
the diets of the Bidens and the visiting dignitaries are factored into
the preparations, along with those of other guests.</p>
<p>“When we formulate and we create the state dinner menu, we take into
consideration all the principals and most of our guests,” she said. “We
also take into consideration the season because this is the perfect time
for some beautiful bounties right now, with the spring coming up, with
all the morels and the mushrooms, and Susie’s cherries and all the stuff
she has on her plate.”</p>
<p>The chefs contact their regular purveyors to find out what’s in
season, and go from there.</p>
<p>The salmon appetizer served in April was inspired by the California
roll, which Comerford said was invented by a Japanese chef.</p>
<p>Morrison’s dessert highlighted Japan’s gift of cherry trees to the
United States, many of which are planted in Washington, and its matcha
tea. She decorated the pistachio cake with sugary mini cherry
blossoms.</p>
<p>“We wanted to bring a little bit of the cherry blossoms that are here
on the Tidal Basin right here to our dessert in order for everyone to
enjoy the cherry blossoms that we enjoy every year,” she said.</p>
<p>Serving dinner to hundreds of guests at once comes down to timing.
Thursday’s event will be held in an expansive pavilion put up on the
South Grounds of the White House.</p>
<p>Sam Kass, who was an assistant chef during President Barack Obama’s
administration, said tradition holds that the president is the first one
served and that plates are cleared away when he is finished eating.</p>
<p>“You have to have a service that is so efficient and quick to get
those plates out so that the last table has a chance to eat,” he
said.</p>
<p>Comerford, 61, sharpened her culinary skills while working at hotels
in Chicago and restaurants in Washington before the White House brought
her on in 1995 as an assistant chef. A naturalized U.S. citizen and
Filipino native, she was named executive chef in 2005. Her
responsibilities include designing and executing menus for state
dinners, social events, holiday functions, receptions and official
luncheons.</p>
<p>Morrison, 57, started at the executive mansion as a contract pastry
employee in 1995 while she was working at a hotel in northern Virginia.
She was named an assistant pastry chef in 2002 and became the executive
pastry chef in November 2014 — just in time to sweat over the details of
that year’s gingerbread White House for the holiday season.</p>
<p>The pair has worked together at the White House for nearly 30
years.</p>
<p>Yosses recalled at least one instance where the honoree’s wishes
dictated the menu selections.</p>
<p>In 2015, China’s Xi Jinping wanted a very American menu, “which I
think was a polite way for him to say that he didn’t think we could do
Chinese food very well,” Yosses said.</p>
<p>The Chinese leader was served butter-poached Maine lobster and
grilled Colorado lamb.</p>

kills multiple people in Iowa as storms tear through Midwest</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>GREENFIELD, Iowa — Multiple people were killed when a tornado tore
through a small town in Iowa and left a wide swath of obliterated homes
and crumpled cars, while the howling winds also twisted and toppled wind
turbines. </p>
<p>After devastating Greenfield, a town of 2,000, on Tuesday the storms
moved eastward to pummel parts of Illinois and Wisconsin, knocking out
power to tens of thousands of customers in the two states. </p>
<p>Greenfield’s hospital was among the buildings that were damaged in
the town, which meant that at least a dozen people who were hurt had to
be taken to facilities elsewhere, according to Iowa State Patrol
Sgt. Alex Dinkla. </p>
<p>“Sadly we can confirm that there have been fatalities,” Dinkla said
at a news conference Tuesday night, without specifying how many. “We’re
still counting at this time.” </p>
<p>He said he thought they had accounted for all of the town’s residents
but that searches would continue if anyone was reported missing. The
Adair County Health System said in a Facebook post Tuesday night that it
had set up a triage center at the Greenfield high school and that people
who need medical attention should go there. </p>
<p>The tornado destroyed much of Greenfield, which is located about 55
miles (90 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines, during a day that saw
multiple tornadoes, giant hail and heavy rain in several states. The
National Weather Service said it received 23 tornado reports Tuesday,
with most in Iowa, and one each in Wisconsin and Minnesota. </p>
<p>In Wisconsin, the weather service’s Green Bay office dispatched a
staffer Wednesday morning to survey storm damage near the village of
Unity in western Marathon County after law enforcement received a report
from the public about a tornado on the ground about 7:45 p.m. Tuesday in
that community about 55 miles (89 kilometers) east of Eau Claire, said
meteorologist Roy Eckberg. He said staffers would also be visiting
Outagamie County near the city of Kaukauna, some 20 miles (32
kilometers) southwest of Green Bay, to investigate significant wind
damage there. </p>
<p>Eckberg said high winds were reported Tuesday night across parts of
central Wisconsin, with a wind gust of 70 mph (113 kilometers per hour)
in the city of Marshfield and with wind damage also reported to the
northwest in the city of Wausau. </p>
<p>Weather service staff would also be assessing storm damage Wednesday
in southeastern Minnesota after radar indicated that a tornado touched
down Tuesday night in Winona County, said Kate Abbott, a meteorologist
with the agency’s La Crosse, Wisconsin, office. </p>
<p>“With that one we did have a radar confirmed tornado, but we’re going
out and survey there to make sure the damage is consistent with a
tornado,” she said. </p>
<p>Authorities announced a mandatory curfew for Greenfield and said they
would only allow residents to enter the town until Wednesday morning.
They also ordered media representatives to leave the city Tuesday
night. </p>
<p>In the aftermath of the storm, mounds of broken wood from homes,
branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once
stood. Some trees still standing were stripped of their limbs and
leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other
belongings that were strewn in every direction. </p>
<p>Rogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the
storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but
said his family got lucky. </p>
<p>“But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house
just got wiped,” Paxton said. “Then you see all these people out here
helping each other. … Everything’s going to be fine because we have each
other, but it’s just going to be really, really rough. It is a
mess.” </p>
<p>A tornado also apparently took down several 250-foot (76-meter) wind
turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending
plumes of smoke into the air. Wind farms are built to withstand
tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds. </p>
<p>Mary Long, the owner of Long’s Market in downtown Greenfield, said
she rode out the storm at her business in the community’s historic town
square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be
widespread damage on the east and south sides of town. </p>
<p>“I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and
then it was just done,” she said. </p>
<p>Camille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where
she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm. </p>
<p>“I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the
road,” she said of the tornado. </p>
<p>Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said she planned to visit Greenfield on
Wednesday morning. </p>
<p>“It was just a few weeks ago that tornadoes hit several other Iowa
communities, and it’s hard to believe that it’s happened again,” she
said in a statement. “Iowans are strong and resilient, and we will get
through this together.” </p>
<p>Iowa had braced for severe weather after the weather service’s Storm
Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe
thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. The storms and
tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin on Tuesday evening and night. </p>
<p>Across the US</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke
to sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high
winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and
submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters rescuing
people from vehicles. </p>
<p>In Illinois, dust storms led authorities to shut down stretches of
two interstates due to low visibility. </p>
<p>The storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of
the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and
tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes
and injuring two in Oklahoma. </p>
<p>Another round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western
Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size
of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and
ice. </p>
<p>In Texas, deadly storms hit the Houston area last week, killing at
least eight people. Those storms last Thursday knocked out power to
hundreds of thousands for days, leaving many in the dark and without air
conditioning during hot and humid weather. Hurricane-force winds reduced
businesses and other structures to debris and shattered glass in
downtown skyscrapers. </p>
<p>Bob Oravec, lead forecaster with the weather service, said the system
is expected to turn south Wednesday, bringing more severe weather to
parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri.</p>

<h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Rich countries are enriching themselves with climate aid
</h3>
<p>
The world’s developed countries have pledged to spend $100 billion per
year helping developing nations grapple with the effects of climate
change, but many of them are channeling economic benefits back to
themselves, according to a
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/climate-change-loans/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz---SELnkEz_Wc3AO_je836IR4X_FXyRQEGT1uOLXVhfRDxHpBj1FIWLH2hF3oYaSuOoaisH" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new
repor</a>t from <em>Reuters</em>. France, Japan, and Germany — the three
countries that reported issuing the most climate financial aid between
2015 and 2020 — each gave more in the form of loans than they did
grants, saddling already debt-burdened nations with yet more interest
payments. Other aid agreements required recipients to purchase materials
or employ organizations from the donor country’s own suppliers.
</p>
<p>
“The benefits to donor countries disproportionately overshadow the
primary objective of supporting climate action in developing countries,”
Ritu Bharadwaj, principal researcher on climate governance and finance
at the International Institute for Environment and Development, told
<em>Reuters</em>.

<h3>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Solar-plus-storage projects gain ground in the West
</h3>
<p>
Solar projects that are co-located with storage are

Western interconnection queues</a>, according to an energy research
analyst at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. More than 98% of proposed
solar capacity within the territory of the California Independent System
Operator and about 87% of proposed solar capacity in the rest of the
West is paired with storage, or, in some instances, with wind, S&amp;P’s
Adam Wilson said. Only about one-fourth of the West’s existing solar
capacity is co-located with storage. Hybrid solar projects have “yet to
gain firm foothold,” Wilson told <em>Utility Dive</em>, but recent data
“suggest that tide may be turning.”
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>ICYMI: The world will be renewable-powered, even without more
government help
</h3>
<p>
We’re almost halfway through the decade that will make or break our
climate future. To get to net-zero by 2050, we’re going to have to spend
a lot more money a lot more quickly.
</p>
<p>
These are among the main conclusions of BloombergNEF’s 2024
<a href="https://about.bnef.com/new-energy-outlook/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz---SELnkEz_Wc3AO_je836IR4X_FXyRQEGT1uOLXVhfRDxHpBj1FIWLH2hF3oYaSuOoaisH" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">New
Energy Outlook</a>, which determined that emissions will have to peak
and renewable capacity will have to triple this decade for the world to
hit net-zero by midcentury. Decarbonizing the global energy system
within that time frame could cost $215 trillion, the report found — 19%
more than the cost of an economics-driven transition that would miss the
Paris Agreement goals and result in 2.6 degrees Celsius of warming. Even
in that economics-driven scenario, which assumes no new climate policies
other than the ones we’ve already got, renewable sources power 70% of
global energy needs by 2050. The conclusions illustrate both the
momentum behind the clean energy transition and the urgent need for
stronger government support.

<li>Coal fraud pollutes the air in India
</h3>
<p>
The Adani Group, a multinational commodities trading conglomerate with
close ties to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, allegedly bought cheap,
highly polluting coal and passed it off as expensive, low-polluting
coal, achieving a fat profit and worsening air quality in the process,
according to
<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7451f2de-91fa-49f3-acb3-e83ab5c00eff?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz---SELnkEz_Wc3AO_je836IR4X_FXyRQEGT1uOLXVhfRDxHpBj1FIWLH2hF3oYaSuOoaisH" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reporting</a>
from the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project published in
the <em>Financial Times</em>. Invoices from 2014 appear to show nearly
two-dozen instances of the group buying low-grade coal from one company
and selling it to another with which it had a contract to supply
high-efficiency coal — 1.5 million metric tons in total. Adani Group
denied the allegations, and other companies involved in the transactions
did not respond to <em>FT</em>’s request for comment.

The report comes in the midst of nationwide voting in India, which began
in April and will end next week. Modi is running for a third term, but

denies US charge that it put anti-satellite weapon in space</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Russia’s top arms control diplomat dismissed as “fake
news” on Wednesday an assertion by the United States that Russia had
launched a weapon into low-Earth orbit that was capable of inspecting
and attacking other satellites.</p>
<p>The Kremlin has flatly denied assertions by U.S. officials that
Moscow is developing a space-based anti-satellite nuclear weapon.</p>
<p>U.S. Space Command on Tuesday pointed to the launch earlier this
month of a Soyuz rocket from Russia’s Plesetsk launch site, saying it
likely involved “a counterspace weapon presumably capable of attacking
other satellites in low Earth orbit.”</p>
<p>Russia’s defense ministry said the May 17 launch had a spacecraft on
board but gave no details what it was for.</p>
<p>“I don’t think we should respond to any fake news from Washington,”
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov was quoted as saying by
the Interfax news agency.</p>
<p>“The Americans can say whatever they want but our policy does not
change from this,” said Ryabkov, adding that Moscow had “always
consistently opposed the deployment of strike weapons in low-Earth
orbit”.</p>
<p>President Vladimir Putin and then-defense minister Sergei Shoigu
denied U.S. assertions in February that Russia was developing a
space-based anti-satellite nuclear weapon designed to disrupt everything
from military communications to phone-based ride services.</p>
<p>U.S. Space Command said the May launch, which it dates as May 16,
included COSMOS 2576, a type of Russian military “inspector” spacecraft
that U.S. officials have long said exhibits reckless space behavior.</p>
<p>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov declined specific comment on the U.S.
assertion but said Russia acted in full accordance with international
law.</p>
<p>“We are not violating anything. We have repeatedly advocated a ban on
the deployment of any weapons into space. Unfortunately, our initiatives
were rejected, including by the United States,” Peskov told reporters.
 </p>
<p>U.S. intelligence agencies had been expecting the launch of COSMOS
2576 and informed allies of their assessment of the satellite before its
deployment in space, according to a U.S. official familiar with the
intelligence. The launch also included civilian satellites deployed to
different orbits.</p>
<p>COSMOS 2576, as of Tuesday, has not gone near a U.S. satellite, but
space analysts observed it to be in the same orbital ring as USA 314, a
bus-sized NRO satellite launched in April 2021.</p>
<p>Ryabkov said Russia’s space program was developing as planned,
including tasks aimed at strengthening defense capability but added that
“this is also not news.”</p>
<p>He said the United States was wrong to have dismissed Russian
proposals on strengthening the security of space activities, including a
proposal on developing a treaty on preventing an arms race in space.</p>

U.S. Has Gotten 3 Direct Air Capture Plants in 13 Months</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-22, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjI4NDUyNC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1MDM2MzYxM30.xbg22ZLIF1DzbvQElNYgZig3Fd04lXfhGV1-4wjFKcI/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
A new direct air capture facility built by the Alphabet-backed
<a href="http://280.earth" target="_blank">280 Earth</a> is officially
plucking carbon dioxide from the surrounding air along the Columbia
River in Oregon, the company announced on Monday. It’s the third-largest
“direct air capture” plant operating in the United States and the latest
entrant in the race to design the cheapest, most efficient machine to
strip the heat-trapping gas from the atmosphere.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The small-scale demonstration project, which neighbors a Google data
center in a city called The Dalles, is expected eventually to capture
carbon at a rate of 500 tons per year. The two other U.S. facilities —
Global Thermostat’s plant in Commerce City, Colorado, and Heirloom’s
plant in Tracy, California — are both designed to capture 1,000 tons per
year. All three came online in just the past 13 months. (There are also
<a href="https://daccoalition.org/global-dac-deployments/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
handful of smaller facilities</u></a> operating in the U.S. that capture
100 tons per year or less.)
</p>
<p>
The team that is now 280 Earth first began working on their direct air
capture system inside X, the tech incubator at Google also known as the
“Moonshot Factory.” They spun out into their own company in 2022, after
four-and-a-half years of research and development. The name comes from
280 parts per million, the amount of carbon in the atmosphere before
industrialization. Today we’ve reached nearly 420 parts per million. But
if the world manages to reduce emissions nearly to zero, it may be
possible to pull enough carbon out of the air to restore the atmosphere
to levels closer to pre-industrial times.
</p>
<p>
In general, direct air capture technologies suck in ambient air and pass
it through a special material called a sorbent that attracts CO2
molecules. They then use heat to remove the carbon from the sorbent so
that it can be transported and safely stored underground.
</p>
<p>
280 Earth’s approach is unique in a few ways. To begin with, the company
is using a “pelletized” sorbent — CEO John Pimental described it to me
as a “half a piece of uncooked rice,” or the innards of a bean bag
chair. The tiny pellets of sorbent flow through the system almost like
water, resulting in some operational efficiency gains.
</p>
<p>
For the second step, the company plans to use waste heat from other
industrial facilities like data centers to remove the captured carbon
from the sorbent. Many data centers circulate cold water through their
facilities for cooling, then send the hot water to a cooling tower where
the heat is released into the atmosphere. 280 Earth can instead take
that hot water and run it through a heat exchanger, sending the
now-cooled water back to the data center. “It means their cooling tower
needs to work less hard, it has less load on it,” said Pimental. “So
it’s an additional revenue source for our company to provide those
cooling services to a neighbor.” <strong><em></em></strong>
</p>
<p>
This waste heat can meet up to 80% of 280 Earth’s operational needs,
reducing the amount of electricity the company buys. It’s also a win-win
for the data center — 280 Earth’s process pulls water from the air in
addition to carbon, and can supply that water to the data center, which
in turn doesn’t have to rely as much on natural sources.
</p>
<p>
Direct air capture technology is often called “speculative” and
“unproven.” But with an increasing number of deployments in the real
world, it’s worth being more specific. These machines have proven to be
able to separate carbon out of the air. The question is whether they can
do so permanently, economically, and at a scale that will actually make
a difference for climate change.
</p>
<p>
Although more plants are coming online every year, those questions are
unlikely to be answered anytime soon. For example, it will be impossible
to judge the efficiency claims made by 280 Earth or any other company
until there is more public data — or <em><em>any </em></em>public data —
about the energy these plants consume or what they cost to operate. Even
the companies that are farthest along, like Climeworks, which has been
operating a 4,000 metric ton per year commercial plant in Iceland since
2021 and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/climeworks-mammoth-5-things-to-know" style="" target="_blank">just
opened a 36,000-ton plant</a> earlier this month, say that they are
still testing the technology and therefore are not ready to share any
stats that could be misinterpreted.
</p>
<p>
The potential to scale could also have less to do with the details of
any one company’s technology and more to do with the ability to procure
clean energy or to find somewhere to store the captured carbon.
</p>
<p>
Though 280 Earth is officially collecting CO2, the company doesn’t yet
have anywhere to put it. Pimental told me the company plans to transport
the gas by truck or rail to a carbon dioxide storage well, but it has
not yet signed any agreements with well operators, and it’s unclear how
long that could take. There are currently only a few operating carbon
storage wells in the country, located in
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/uic/table-epas-draft-and-final-class-vi-well-permits" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Illinois</u></a>
and
<a href="https://www.dmr.nd.gov/dmr/oilgas/ClassVI" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>North
Dakota</u></a>. But additional wells have been permitted in California,
Indiana, and Wyoming, and many more are
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/uic/current-class-vi-projects-under-review-epa" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>under
review by the Environmental Protection Agency</u></a>. Rather than
sequester the carbon underground, the company could also sell it for
industrial uses. Heirloom, for example, has an agreement with a company
called CarbonCure to
<a href="https://www.heirloomcarbon.com/news/heirloom-carboncure-sign-agreement-to-permanently-store-atmospheric-co2-in-concrete" style="" target="_blank">take
the CO2 it captures and store it in concrete</a>.
</p>
<p>
Regardless, 280 Earth company is aiming to scale up quickly and plans to
build a new unit that can capture 5,000 tons of CO2 per year by 2025.
Pimental told me that equipment procurement and permitting for that
project are already underway. 280 Earth has not been awarded any
government funding to date, but the company plans to compete to be one
of the Department of Energy’s next direct air capture “hubs.”
</p>
<p>
Pimental told me he likes his odds. “I think we’ll be in a very strong
position because not many people have a 500 ton commercial demonstration
facility up and running.”

<h2 id="how-to-unlock-super-cheap-rooftop-solar">How to Unlock Super
Cheap Rooftop Solar</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-22, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjI3OTY1MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2NzI2Nzk2MH0.kSglAbZDmLUESe5nBAuSBdR8RR_fuZTTCzREfMFTF1k/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Why isn’t rooftop solar cheaper in America? In Australia in 2024, a
standard rooftop system can cost as little as 90 cents per watt. In the
U.S., a similar system might go for $4 per watt. If America could come
even close to Australia’s rooftop solar prices, then we would be able to
decarbonize the power system much faster than we are now.
</p>
<p>
Mary Powell has the answers. She is the chief executive officer of
<a href="https://www.sunrun.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Sunrun</u></a>,
a $2.6 billion company that is the country’s largest rooftop solar and
battery installer. Sunrun has set up or managed more than 900,000
rooftop systems across the U.S. Powell previously led Green Mountain
Power, Vermont’s largest investor-owned power company.

<p>
Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Jesse Jenkins:</strong> And so, just some stats to start off the
conversation. The latest quarterly solar update from the Department of
Energy notes that the average cost of a 2 to 10 kilowatt residential
rooftop system in the U.S. is roughly $4 per watt, DC, installed. That’s
the full installed system costs, not just the modules.<br/> <br/> I just
looked up
<a href="https://www.solarchoice.net.au/" target="_blank">solarchoice.net.au</a>,
the Australian site that tracks bids and costs in Australia, which has
one of the most vibrant rooftop solar industries in the country. There,
you can now install a rooftop solar system in Sydney for just under $1
U.S. per watt, which is quite remarkable — you know, dramatically
cheaper than it was a few years ago, but also dramatically cheaper than
the U.S residential solar market, by a factor of four. <br/> <br/> And
so obviously, if we could knock the cost of rooftop solar in the U.S.
down by another 75%, it would be an incredible value proposition all
over the country. So, how do we get there, Mary? What explains why solar
in the U.S., rooftop solar, is much more expensive than it is in places
like Australia — I should say, it’s not just Australia. It’s also, you
know, the U.K. and Germany and Belgium and other places. Why is it so
much more expensive here now than it is in these other countries? And
how do we drive down the cost of residential solar installations in the
U.S. so that we can unlock that potential here, too? <br/> <br/>
<strong>Mary Powell: </strong>Yeah, for sure. I mean, that is so
exciting when you think about it, Jesse. What gets me so excited when
you say that is I think, ‘<em>Oh my gosh, we are selling all across
America now with savings against what people are paying for utility
power.’ </em> So customers — even at our current costs. So back to your
question on how I see the future, just think about how powerful that
will be as we continue to innovate and figure out ways to drive down the
cost.<br/> <br/> Now, that said, the biggest driver of the cost
difference is the way the American energy system is built. And not just
that, but we have 40,000 AHJs in the United States that each have their
own distinct solar process and rules. And in Australia they have fewer
than 600. <br/> <br/> <strong>Robinson Meyer:</strong> And those are
like cities?<br/> <br/> <strong>Powell:</strong> It’s housing
jurisdictions. It’s like — let me give you an example. In DuPage County,
Illinois, we have to have a full time employee pull permits all day.
Only one permit at a time. <br/> <br/> You know, the other big thing in
the U.S. is our whole energy system, as we know, it is very much driven
by state and regional rules. Like rules of the road, a lot of regulatory
differences from one jurisdiction to another, a lot of massive
differences from one utility to another. So, you know, interconnection
for residential is still costly, time consuming, and is even prohibited
in some areas. Interconnection fees for home solar systems from
utilities range from $100 to $10,000. So, one of the bright spots is the
work that Sunrun was involved in, a lot of players were involved in, and
that Secretary Jennifer Granholm is really focused on, which is
SolarAPP+. So, that is one way to drive down the cost, Jesse. <br/>
<br/> Back to the difference: So really, I would say, the biggest
difference is bureaucracy. When you talk about Australia and you talk
about the U.S., that’s the biggest difference.

<h2 id="habari-white-house-to-welcome-kenyan-president-1">Habari! White
House to welcome Kenyan president</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The White House — The White House gave three reasons for inviting
Kenyan President William Ruto on Thursday to break the 16-year drought
during which no African leader has been honored with a pomp-filled state
visit.</p>
<p>Those include the two governments’ shared democratic convictions and
their like-minded approach in leveraging the private sector to meet
government aims.</p>
<p>But the primary reason, the administration’s new top Africa
policymaker told VOA, is Kenya’s recent decision to assert itself
globally by offering 1,000 peacekeepers for Haiti. The first tranche of
boots on the ground are expected to hit Haitian soil this week.</p>
<p>“We chose Kenya for a few reasons,” Frances Brown, senior director
for African affairs at the National Security Council, told VOA during
her first media interview since taking the post. “No. 1 is the
Kenya-U.S. partnership has really grown from a regionally focused one to
a globally focused one. We’ve been really pleased by the way that
Kenyans have stepped up to play leadership [roles] beyond their
region.”</p>
<p>Analysts say a state visit is a big deal.</p>
<p>“It is the highest diplomatic honor that our president can bestow,”
said Cameron Hudson, a senior fellow in the Africa program at the Center
for Strategic and International Studies.</p>
<p>“It’s typically an indicator of a very close and important bilateral
relationship. And so, elevating Kenya to the level of, let’s say, a
Japan, which was the most recent country to have a state visit, I think
it is symbolic. And it’s important for all the reasons that I just
described as far as Kenya being on a level that we would give it the
same privileges as one of our oldest and longest security partners,”
Hudson said.</p>
<p>Brown said the administration aims to use the visit to reach
agreements in areas like technology, climate management, debt relief and
health.</p>
<p>And on the Haiti mission, Washington has signaled its approval: with
$300 million in support.</p>
<p>“We’ve been working really closely with them,” Brown said. “As you
may know, there’s been planning underway for a number of months. It has
included policing experts from around the world working to develop a
concept of operations. Kenya is not going it alone.”</p>
<p>Other priorities</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Kenyan leader says his focus is on debt restructuring,
and activists in the East African nation are sounding the alarm over
human rights concerns.</p>
<p>Ruto, in Atlanta for his first stop of his four-day U.S. visit, said
he’d use his time in Washington to “make a case for many countries in
Africa, including Kenya, seeking to adjust international financial
architecture.”</p>
<p>“Many countries are in economic and debt distress occasioned by
climate change and compounded by an unjust international financial
architecture and also an imperfect multilateralism,” he said.</p>
<p>“We now run the escalating risk of democracy and free markets being
associated with poverty, and lending credit to the widespread
lamentation that democracy is or has been on the retreat in many parts
of the world, including Africa,” Ruto added.</p>
<p>But human rights advocates in Nairobi told VOA they hope American
leadership will also raise what they see as serious concerns, like
reports of abuses by Kenyan police, who are taking the lead in the Haiti
mission.</p>
<p>“We see this as a really excellent opportunity to focus on
governance, human rights and rule of law, for many reasons,” Irungu
Houghton, executive director for Amnesty International Kenya, told VOA.
“Both the United States and Kenya are nations that projected themselves
as essentially, nations that believe in these values, and the state
dinner is an opportunity really to focus on that.”</p>
<p>Others highlight a tightening of public expression, especially over
the hot-button issue of the Gaza war. Many African nations have
criticized Israel’s behavior in the conflict, but Kenya’s government has
kept largely quiet.</p>
<p>“Especially within the Muslim community in Kenya, we’ve had persons
trying to protest them and to picket on this issue, but they had a very,
very hard time having access to the streets, because every time they go
out, the police arrest them,” said Demas Kiprono, who leads the Kenyan
section of the International Commission of Jurists.</p>
<p>Others say they hope American leadership will voice concerns over a
pending Kenyan law that they say targets sexual minorities.</p>
<p>“It’s criminalizing things even like pronouns. It’s criminalizing
things like using [gender] neutral toilets. It’s a horrible, horrible
law that is being financed by Family Watch International — that’s the
same organization that financed the Uganda bill and all the
(LGBTQ)-related bills basically in Africa and even in the U.S.,” said
activist and organizer Yvonne Muthoni.</p>
<p>Family Watch International is a conservative Christian American
lobbying group. The Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks extremist
groups, says it “works within the United Nations and with countries
around the world to further anti-LGBT and anti-choice stances.”</p>
<p>“We are looking at violence that is coming from this. Whether it’s
online or physical violence, we are seeing a rise in the number of cases
that are being reported, in the number of complaints, in the rallies
that are being called for. So, it is quite a scary time for Kenya right
now,” Muthoni said.</p>
<p>The view from here and there</p>
<p>At the White House this week, a large Kenyan flag was displayed
alongside an American flag, each covering the height of an entire story
of the hulking gray Eisenhower Executive Building. Workers erected
massive white sails around the White House’s North Portico, where the
Bidens plan to formally welcome the Rutos.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the day after Ruto departed Nairobi — likely traversing
the new Chinese-built superhighway that cuts the city in half and ends
at the airport — one had to scroll far down on news to find mention of
his American jaunt.</p>
<p>Instead, the nation’s prominent newspapers focused on issues that
Kenyans wrestle with daily. The Standard’s front page wrote of 850,000
new jobs last year — close to the 900,000 the World Bank says is needed
to sustain economic growth in the lower middle-income country.</p>
<p>That coverage mirrors Kenyans’ priorities, Houghton said.</p>
<p>“Most Kenyans are economically distressed,” he said. “They are very
concerned about the cost of living. Thousands of them went onto the
streets last year and almost rendered the country ungovernable in
certain counties because they felt that the crippling number of taxes
that had been introduced were essentially not making it possible for
them to survive. We’ve seen a deterioration in terms of the services,
education, health and otherwise. … So, there is a very clear
disproportionate, I guess, energy around this visit.”</p>
<p>Farhad Pouladi contributed to this report from the White House.</p>

id="blinken-gaza-cease-fire-still-possible-but-iccs-move-complicates-efforts">Blinken:
Gaza cease-fire still possible, but ICC’s move complicates efforts</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>state department — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said
Tuesday that a cease-fire deal between Israel and Hamas militants in
return for the release of hostages remains possible, but the
International Criminal Court’s arrest warrants for Israeli leaders
hindered ongoing efforts.  </p>
<p>“There’s been an extensive effort made in recent months to get that
agreement. I think we came very, very close on a couple of occasions.
Qatar, Egypt, others participating in the efforts to do this — we remain
at it every single day. I think that there’s still a possibility,”
Blinken told lawmakers during a hearing at the Senate Committee on
Foreign Relations.    </p>
<p>But Blinken said the “extremely wrongheaded decision” by the ICC
prosecutor to seek arrest warrants for Israel’s prime minister, defense
minister and three Hamas leaders in Gaza for war crimes and crimes
against humanity in connection with the Israel-Hamas war complicated the
prospects of reaching such a deal.    </p>
<p>On Monday, U.S. President Joe Biden denounced the ICC prosecutor’s
decision to equate Hamas terror attacks and civilian abductions in
southern Israel with Israel’s military practices in Gaza, calling the
ICC prosecutor’s application for arrest warrants “outrageous.”  </p>
<p>Blinken said he will be happy to work with the Congress “on an
appropriate response.”    </p>
<p>Some lawmakers are considering legislation to sanction ICC officials
for prosecuting U.S. citizens or allies, including Israel.  </p>
<p>The top U.S. diplomat began two days of congressional testimonies,
which were immediately interrupted by protesters holding signs that read
“war criminal.” They were escorted out of the hearing room by Capitol
Police.  </p>
<p>Military operation in Rafah   </p>
<p>In the nearly three-hour hearing, Blinken also said the Biden
administration remains “very concerned” about a major military operation
by Israel in Rafah.  </p>
<p>The U.S. has opposed a full-scale military assault by Israel in
Rafah, situated in the southern part of Gaza. Such an operation would
endanger the lives of 1.3 million civilians who evacuated from the
northern and central areas of the territory to seek safety from Israel’s
military response to Hamas’ October 7 attack on Israel.  </p>
<p>Israel’s military campaign has killed more than 35,000 Palestinians
and wounded nearly 80,000, most of them civilians, according to the Gaza
Health Ministry. The offensive was launched following a Hamas terror
attack into Israel that killed 1,200 people.  </p>
<p>US-Saudi defense pact     </p>
<p>U.S. officials said the United States and Saudi Arabia are nearing a
final agreement on a bilateral defense pact.   </p>
<p>Once complete, it will be part of a broader deal presented to Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who must decide whether to make
concessions to his opposition regarding the establishment of a
Palestinian state to secure normalization with Saudi Arabia.  </p>
<p>On Tuesday, Blinken admitted that Israel might be reluctant to accept
a normalization deal with Saudi Arabia if it requires them to agree to a
Palestinian state.    </p>
<p>In his testimony before the U.S. Congress, Blinken told Democratic
Senator Chris Murphy “the overall package could not go forward, absent
other things that have to happen for normalization to proceed.”</p>
<p>“And in particular,” he said, “the Saudis have been very clear that
would require calm in Gaza. And it would require a credible pathway to a
Palestinian state. And it may well be, as you said, that in this moment,
Israel is not able or willing to proceed down that pathway.”    </p>
<p>Blinken added that Israel must “decide whether it wants to proceed
and take advantage of the opportunity” to achieve something that it has
sought since its founding: normal relations with the countries in the
region.  </p>
<p>Netanyahu has rejected the two-state solution and the return of the
Palestinian Authority controlling Gaza, demands that are widely
supported by the international community.  </p>
<p>The Saudis have demanded, as a prerequisite to normalizing ties with
Israel, to see an Israeli commitment to the two-state solution.</p>

to make Google’s new “Web” search option the default in your
browser</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-21, from: OS News</p>
<p>Last week, Google unveiled a new little feature in Google Search,
called “Web”. Residing alongside the various other options like “All”,
“Images”, “Video”, and so on, its goal is to effectively strip Google
Search results from everything we generally don’t like, and just present
a list of actual links to actual websites. It turns out it’s quite
simple to set this as your default search “engine” in your browser, so
somebody made a website to make that process a little easier. On May
15th Google released a new “Web” filter that removes “AI Overview” and
other clutter, leaving only traditional web results. Here is how you can
set “Google Web” as your default search engine. ↫ TenBlueLinks.org It’s
important to note that this is not some separate search engine, and that
no data is flowing any differently than when using regular Google. All
this does is append the parameter UDM=14 to the URL, which loads the
option “Web”.</p>

Hey, that’s where I work!

“Spreading its journalistic wealth has long been core to its mission.
The latest iteration of that is the 50 State Initiative, announced last
month.”
</p>
<p>
The 50 State Initiative is a commitment to publishing accountability
journalism in every US state over the next five years. This is an
expansion of the Local Reporting Network, which was already doing great
work in partnership with local newsrooms. As this piece points out,
there are actually only two states where ProPublica hasn’t run some kind
of an investigative story - but, of course, the 50 States Initiative
goes much deeper than that. It’s an exciting time to be working here.

id="decentralized-systems-will-be-necessary-to-stop-google-from-putting-the-web-into-managed-decline">Decentralized
Systems Will Be Necessary To Stop Google From Putting The Web Into
Managed Decline</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-21, from: Ben Werdmuller’s blog</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div class=&quot;known-bookmark&quot;&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;e-content&quot;&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
“The various decentralized social media systems that have been growing
over the past few years offer a very different potential approach: one
in which you get to build the experience you want, rather than the one a
giant company wants.”
</p>
<p>
There’s a chicken and egg problem here: while decentralized systems are
absolutely going to be part of the solution, or at least hold most of
the properties that make for a good solution, they also need to have a
critical mass of people who use them.
</p>
<p>
A lot of people are looking towards Threads to provide this critical
mass, but just as I’d invite newsrooms to consider how to gain more
traffic without Apple News, I’d invite the federated social web
community to consider what a growth looks like without Meta. It’s not
that Threads won’t help - it’s that you don’t want to be dependent on a
megacorp to provide the assistance you need. You never know when they’ll
change their policies and look elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
Still, the point stands: decentralization is a key part of the answer.
There’s a lot to be gained from investing in projects that provide
strong user experiences, solve concrete real human problems alongside
the ideological ones and the existential threats, and onboard a new
generation of internet users to a better way to share and browse.
</p>
<p>
That’s a tall order, but, as always, I’m hopeful.

Already Lost the Climate Debate to Trump</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-21, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjI5NTI2MC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1MTg5NTE4MX0.it7kLwl34iWdA3npq2D7-LDULDf5eKHFcT1h-aTJnHE/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
At 9 p.m. ET on June 27, Americans who haven’t already set their
out-of-office responders or hit the road to beat summer weekend traffic
or otherwise made plans more exciting than watching two old men insult
each other might find themselves tuning into the first presidential
debate.
</p>
<p>
It does not promise to be a particularly productive evening of
television, however. Weekly <em><em>Economist</em></em>/YouGov polls
conducted online since last April
<a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/04/10/who-are-the-swing-voters-in-america" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>show</u></a>
that of the 49,000 voters who responded, just 3% of respondents voted
for one candidate in 2020 and plan to vote for the other in 2024. (Of
those swing voters, two-thirds have flipped to Trump.) The 2024 election
is already so politically calcified that a night of persuasive
television is unlikely to change additional minds, to say nothing of two
hours of petty sniping. Although, the only thing more difficult than
changing someone’s mind about Biden or Trump might be changing their
mind about climate change — a similarly key facet of political identity,
regardless of the facts.
</p>
<p>
Nothing has the potential to highlight both the spectacle and the farce
of this whole election quite like a back-and-forth on the debate stage
over Biden’s climate legacy. Trump has spent the past several months on
the campaign trail hammering his opponent on
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-fact-check-climate-change" target="_self"><u>everything</u></a>
from offshore wind to electric vehicles, dishwashers, and gas stoves.
The bashing has little to do with the actual <em><em>policies</em></em>,
but rather with the idea of climate policy itself.
</p>
<p>
The modern Republican Party has “managed to define almost all aspects of
environmentalism — even just future concern for other people’s welfare —
as not a virtue anymore but a sign of weakness,” Riley Dunlap, a
professor emeritus of environmental sociology at Oklahoma State
University, put it to me. Heatmap columnist Paul Waldman
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/republicans-lab-grown-meat" target="_self"><u>recently
dubbed</u></a> this kind of political positioning “anti-anti-climate
change” — not in favor environmental degradation <em>per se</em>, but
certainly against anyone trying to stop it. Trump is merely an exemplar
of a greater shift on the right — traceable also to Wyoming Senator
<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/senate-republican-biden-gas-stove-ban" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>John
Barrasso</u></a>, Wisconsin Senator
<a href="https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/ron-johnson-suggested-windmills-are-killing-whales-rcna104335" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Ron
Johnson</u></a>, and on down to dozens of state attorneys general suing
to roll back the Biden administration’s climate policies — moving “the
conversation from the real problem onto the supposedly oppressive
efforts to solve it.”
</p>
<p>
It’s a phenomenon I’ve observed, too,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/2024-election-climate-trump" target="_self"><u>in
my writing</u></a> about how Republicans have evolved from the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/the-surreal-success-of-professional-climate-denial" target="_self"><u>denial
and skepticism strategies</u></a> of the 1990s and early 2000s to
today’s more underhanded tactics. Why bother getting hung up on the
specifics of what is causing global warming or if it’s happening
(especially when popular belief in the scientific consensus
<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/climate-change-support" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>is
at an all-time high</u></a>) when you can focus on how the elites in
Washington want to control how you drive, eat,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/republicans-weave-a-climate-conspiracy-at-the-final-debate" target="_self"><u>invest</u></a>,
and cook, instead?
</p>
<p>
Jay Turner, a professor of environmental studies at Wellesley College
and the author of
<a href="https://bookshop.org/a/95482/9780674979970" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>The
Republican Reversal: Conservatives and the Environment from Nixon to
Trump</em></em></u></a>, told me the politicization of climate change
has been building for more than a decade. He traced the strategy back to
around the 2010 midterms, when the populist, anti-government Tea Party
movement — today mostly remembered for opposition to Obama-era federal
healthcare reforms —
<a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/documentary/climate-of-doubt/transcript/?" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>also
took aim at climate change</u></a>. With the
<a href="https://www.savannahnow.com/story/news/2008/06/19/balloon-tour-condemns-global-warming-solution/13354153007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>backing</u></a>
of the libertarian advocacy group Americans for Prosperity (funded by
petrochemical billionaires Charles and David Koch), the movement helped
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/26/science/earth/26climate.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>kill</u></a>
the bipartisan cap-and-trade Waxman-Markey Bill, which up to that point
had been the biggest climate bill ever to pass a chamber of Congress.
</p>
<p>
“A culture of freedom and abundance is something that is very American,”
Turner told me. “The idea that we’re going to curb fossil fuels or are
transitioning our economy because of an abstract environmental threat”
runs counter to what many feel the flag stands for.
</p>
<p>
Republicans, especially those angling for a national audience, have
found traction with voters exploiting this perceived threat. The general
public isn’t terribly energy literate, so politicians “can kind of make
up stuff like, ‘They’re going to make you use these terrible toilets,
they’re gonna force you to get an electric car, they’re going to force
you just start eating fake meat,’” Dunlap, the Oklahoma State professor,
said. “The message is, ‘These people are out to get you, and we’re
fighting for you.’”
</p>
<p>
This dialog presents a problem for Biden, who has not only enacted
<a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/the-biden-administration-has-taken-more-climate-action-than-any-other-in-history/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>numerous
climate policies</u></a>, but who also now faces the daunting task of
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/inflation-reduction-act-popularity-repeal" target="_self"><u>explaining
to voters</u></a> what all of them are. But by opening a second,
substantively unrelated front in the climate conversation, Trump and
other Republicans have wrenched the message away from liberal-coded
ideas that are, in fact,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/bidens-climate-agenda-is-actually-popular" target="_self"><u>popular</u></a>
across a broad spectrum of voters and toward more solid conservative
ground.
</p>
<p>
“Most Republican voters still want clean air and clean water and a
healthy climate,” is how David Pomerantz, the executive director of the
Energy and Policy Institute, a utilities watchdog, put it to me. “But if
they’re able to cast this messaging in ways that are anti-government,
anti-elitist, and anti-somebody-telling-you-what-you-have-to-do, then
they think that can be an effective strategy.”
</p>
<p>
It’s working. As Biden has paused approving construction permits for new
liquefied natural gas export terminals (which is also
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/lng-front-line-communities-louisiana" target="_self"><u>a
clean-air issue</u></a>) and argued for diversifying American energy
(<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/alaska-natural-gas-anchorage-mayor" target="_self"><u>an
economic one</u></a>), Republicans have doubled down on their
anti-anti-climate bona fides. “I don’t know if this is an actual term
anyone uses, but it might be more accurate to say they are ‘vice
signaling’ because it’s like, ‘Yeah, we’re for the bad thing because
it’s a way to own the libs,’” Pomerantz said. There is often a healthy
amount of irony in these sorts of controversies, such as Florida
Gov. Ron DeSantis’ crusade against gas stoves that are
<a href="https://www.wfla.com/news/politics/only-8-of-floridians-have-gas-stoves-but-desantis-promises-to-fight-potential-ban/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CTake%20away%20gas%20stoves%2C%20take,going%20to%20let%20that%20happen.%E2%80%9D" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>used
by less than 10% of Floridians</u></a>, or a ban on
<a href="https://heatmap.news/lifestyle/lab-grown-meat-florida-desantis" target="_self"><u>lab-grown
meat</u></a>, which isn’t even available in the U.S.
</p>
<p>
The “obvious and boring” thing for Biden, his team, and others to do in
the face of such bluster is “to just say the true thing over and over,”
Pomerantz went on. But he also noted that climate advocates like EPI
must make clear “not only when people are lying or purveying
disinformation, but <em><em>why</em></em>.” If Trump hits Biden over
energy or drilling, for example, the president could counter by raising
Trump’s recent
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/09/climate/trump-oil-gas-mar-a-lago.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>closed-door
dealings with oil executives</u></a>, in which he used fossil-fuel
regulations intended to keep Americans healthy as a bargaining chip for
soliciting campaign donations. But that kind of move is only possible
after your opponent has set the pieces on the board — and if your
opponent is disingenuous, as likely as not, you’ll have lost by the time
you get started.
</p>
<p>
If there is any good news, it’s that the presidential debate itself
won’t matter. Whatever Trump and Biden say about climate next month
won’t change the minds of any of the few dozen people (OK fine, actually
more like 63 million, based on the
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-donald-trump-virus-outbreak-health-ad254c08bc2dfbcbbaf258cace153fa9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>audience</u></a>
of their last matchup, in 2020) likely to tune in.
</p>
<p>
The bad news is that Biden has already lost the climate debate, even if
Trump renews his distinction of setting “the tone for the worst
presidential debate in living memory,”
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-and-biden-stage-the-worst-presidential-debate-in-living-memory/2020/09/29/9cdbeb56-027e-11eb-b7ed-141dd88560ea_story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>as
he did the last time around</u></a>. Because by arguing foolish
premises, Biden legitimizes them. And he may have no other choice.

<h2 id="my-blogging-workflow">My blogging workflow</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-21, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://birming.com/posts/our-blogging-workflow&quot;&gt;Robert&lt;/a&gt; told me about this blogging workflow trend that’s currently happening in a bunch of blogs around the web and since I thought it’s a neat idea I’m gonna share mine.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
I’m gonna split it into two because this blog serves as both my home on
the web as well as a home for the
<a href="https://peopleandblogs.com">People and Blogs series</a>.
</p>
<h2>
My posts
</h2>
<p>
I have two types of posts on this site: regular blog posts and
“moments”. Moments are my personal Instagram, posts with an image and a
short caption. As the name suggests, those are moments in time and so
there is no real planning behind them. This is how it works:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
I take a picture with my iPhone
</li>
<li>
I do some light editing using Snapseed
</li>
<li>
I log into my site’s dashboard
</li>
<li>
I create a new post
</li>
<li>
I write a title that always starts with “A moment…”
</li>
<li>
I upload the picture and I write the short post directly on the admin
interface
</li>
<li>
I hit save
</li>
</ol>
<p>
There’s no proofreading involved, no drafts, no nothing. I take a photo,
I upload it, write something and move on with my day.
</p>
<p>
As for the regular posts, those are handled a bit differently. My blog
has no structure behind its schedule. I post about whatever I find
interesting at any point in time. I have a to-do list with a bunch of
random ideas that usually appear in my head out of nowhere when I’m
outside for a walk. Those entries in my to-do are either a single
line—for example <em>Taxonomy of personal websites</em>—or a combination
of title + short description—<em>Good conversations: What’s the ideal
workflow for a good conversation online</em>.
</p>
<p>
When I feel in the mood to post something I either pick one of those
entries or, like I’m doing now, I write about something else, usually in
response to something I read somewhere else. The workflow is the
following:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
I open iA Writer
</li>
<li>
I write my post
</li>
<li>
When I feel I’m done I copy-paste into Grammarly to check for typos or
other silly issues
</li>
<li>
I open my site’s dashboard
</li>
<li>
I create a new post
</li>
<li>
I copy-paste from Grammarly and I hit publish
</li>
<li>
I then log into Buttondown.email, create a new email, paste the content
of the new post and hit send because there are some 100 or so people who
want to get my posts via email
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Again, I don’t do drafts, don’t do editing. I have an idea, I write it
down, check for silly issues with Grammarly and then I post it online.
That’s how my blog works.
</p>
<h2>
People and Blogs
</h2>
<p>
As I mentioned before, my site also hosts the People and Blogs
interviews. The workflow for those posts is a bit different and it goes
like this:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
I have a list of potential guests on Airtable
</li>
<li>
I cold email a bunch of people and ask if they want to be part of the
series
</li>
<li>
If they say yes I send them the questions
</li>
<li>
When I get back the answers I create a new post
</li>
<li>
I format their answers in markdown and add the intro and outro and store
it as a draft
</li>
<li>
On the week the interview is scheduled to go live I send a link to the
draft to the guest to give them time to do a final check and to also
give them a final chance to add or remove anything from the answers
</li>
<li>
Once the interview is good to go I log into the Buttondown account,
create the interview and schedule it to go live on Friday
</li>
<li>
5 minutes before it’s time to go live a reminder rings on my phone to
make sure I don’t forget to publish the post
</li>
<li>
I log into my dashboard and hit publish
</li>
</ol>
<p>
And that’s how it works for P&amp;B. Could I add an auto-publish feature
on my site? Sure. Would that save me time? Maybe 20 seconds a week. Is
it worth it? Absolutely not.
</p>
<p>
And those are my workflows. Nothing fancy, very few tools and very
little automation. As always if you have questions you can

a macOS application to prevent iTunes or Apple Music from launching</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-21, from: OS News</p>
<p>noTunes is a macOS application that will prevent iTunes or Apple
Music from launching. Simply launch the noTunes app and iTunes/Music
will no longer be able to launch. For example, when bluetooth headphones
reconnect. You can toggle the apps functionality via the menu bar icon
with a simple left click. ↫ noTunes GitHub page Apparently, this is such
a common complaint that an application had to be made just to gain some
semblance of control over what some people still refer to as “their”
computer. For both macOS and Windows, there’s a giant industry – you
can’t really call it a cottage industry anymore at this point – of
tools, applications, and fixes just to deal with or avoid all the
user-hostile, anti-choice garbage Apple and Microsoft shove into their
respective operating systems. As a Linux user – and recent OpenBSD
convert – I find this absolutely wild. Following any Apple podcast, or
reading any Windows website, makes it so clear just how many hoops these
people have to jump through and how many weirdly-shaped holes they have
to contort into just to be able to gain some vague semblance of
ownership of their own hardware. I’m not judging – we all have areas in
our lives where we do this, they just differ from person to person – but
it’s still confronting to see it so clearly, all the time.</p>

id="rudy-giuliani-pleads-not-guilty-to-felony-charges-in-arizona-election-interference-case">Rudy
Giuliani pleads not guilty to felony charges in Arizona election
interference case</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Phoenix, Arizona — Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani pleaded
not guilty Tuesday to nine felony charges stemming from his role in an
effort to overturn Donald Trump’s 2020 election loss in Arizona to Joe
Biden.</p>
<p>Giuliani appeared remotely for the arraignment that was held in a
Phoenix courtroom. His trial will take place in October.</p>
<p>Former Arizona Republican Party chair Kelli Ward and at least 11
other people were also arraigned Tuesday for conspiracy, forgery and
fraud charges in a Phoenix courtroom. She and nine others have so far
pleaded not guilty. Her trial date is set for Oct. 17, about 3 weeks
before the U.S. election.</p>
<p>During his remote appearance, Giuliani said he did not have an
attorney at this time but will. When asked by the court whether he
needed counsel appointed for the arraignment, Giuliani said: “No, no, I
think I am capable of handling it myself.”</p>
<p>Giuliani said he received a summons but did not have a copy of the
indictment. He said he is familiar with the charges, though, by reading
about them.</p>
<p>Arizona authorities tried unsuccessfully over several weeks to serve
Giuliani notice of the indictment against him. Giuliani was finally
served Friday night as he was walking to a car after his 80th birthday
celebration in Florida.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, in response to the prosecutors request for a $10,000 cash
bond after outlining the difficulty in serving Giuliani in the case,
Giuliani said: “I have a fair number of threats including death threats,
and I don’t have security anymore …so I have very strict rules about who
gets up and who doesn’t.”</p>
<p>The judge required Giuliani to post a secured appearance bond of
$10,000 as well as appear in Arizona within the next 30 days for booking
procedures.</p>
<p>Arizona authorities unveiled the felony charges last month against
Republicans who submitted a document to Congress falsely declaring
Trump, a Republican, had won Arizona. The defendants include five
lawyers connected to the former president and two former Trump aides.
Biden, a Democrat, won Arizona by more than 10,000 votes.</p>
<p>The indictment alleges Ward, a former state senator who led the GOP
in Arizona from 2019 until early 2023, organized the fake electors and
urged then-Vice President Mike Pence to declare them to be the state’s
true electors. It says Ward failed to withdraw her vote as a fake
elector even though no legal challenges changed the outcome of the
presidential race in Arizona.</p>
<p>Last week, attorney John Eastman, who devised a strategy to try to
persuade Congress not to certify the election, was the first defendant
in the case to be arraigned, pleading not guilty to the charges.</p>
<p>Trump himself was not charged in the Arizona case but was referred to
as an unindicted co-conspirator.</p>
<p>Arizona is the fourth state where allies of the former president have
been charged with using false or unproven claims about voter fraud
related to the election.</p>
<p>The 11 people who claimed to be Arizona’s Republican electors met in
Phoenix on Dec. 14, 2020, to sign a certificate saying they were “duly
elected and qualified” electors and asserting that Trump carried the
state. A one-minute video of the signing ceremony was posted on social
media by the Arizona Republican Party at the time. The document was
later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was
ignored.</p>
<p>Of eight lawsuits that unsuccessfully challenged Biden’s victory in
the state, one was filed by the 11 fake Arizona electors, who had asked
a federal judge to decertify the results and block the state from
sending its results to the Electoral College. In dismissing the case,
the judge concluded the Republicans had “failed to provide the court
with factual support for their extraordinary claims.” Days after that
lawsuit was dismissed, the 11 participated in the certificate
signing.</p>
<p>Those set to be arraigned Tuesday are Ward; Tyler Bowyer, an
executive of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA;
state Sen. Anthony Kern; Greg Safsten, a former executive director of
the Arizona Republican Party; Robert Montgomery, a former chairman of
the Cochise County Republican Committee; Samuel Moorhead, a Republican
precinct committee member in Gila County; Nancy Cottle, who in 2020 was
the first vice president of the Arizona Federation of Republican Women;
Loraine Pellegrino, past president of the Ahwatukee Republican Women;
Michael Ward, an osteopathic physician who is married to Ward; attorneys
Jenna Ellis and Christina Bobb; and Michael Roman, who was Trump’s 2020
director of Election Day operations.</p>
<p>Arraignments are scheduled for June 6 for state Sen. Jake Hoffman; on
June 7 for former Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows; and on June 18 for
Trump attorney Boris Epshteyn and for James Lamon, another Republican
who claimed Trump carried the state.</p>

id="biden-releasing-1-million-barrels-of-gasoline-from-northeast-reserve-in-bid-to-lower-prices-at-pump">Biden
releasing 1 million barrels of gasoline from Northeast reserve in bid to
lower prices at pump</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Biden administration said Tuesday that it is
releasing 1 million barrels of gasoline from a Northeast reserve
established after Superstorm Sandy in a bid to lower prices at the pump
this summer. </p>
<p>The sale, from storage sites in New Jersey and Maine, will be
allocated in increments of 100,000 barrels at a time. The approach will
create a competitive bidding process that ensures gasoline can flow into
local retailers ahead of the July 4 holiday and sold at competitive
prices, the Energy Department said. The move is intended to help “lower
costs for American families and consumers,” the department said in a
statement. </p>
<p>Gas prices average about $3.60 per gallon nationwide as of Tuesday,
up 6 cents from a year ago, according to AAA (American Automobile
Association). Tapping gasoline reserves is one of the few actions a
president can take by himself to try to control inflation, an election
year liability for the party in control of the White House. </p>
<p>“The Biden-Harris administration is laser-focused on lowering prices
at the pump for American families, especially as drivers hit the road
for summer driving season,” Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said in
the statement. “By strategically releasing this reserve in between
Memorial Day and July 4th, we are ensuring sufficient supply flows to
the tri-state (area) and Northeast at a time hardworking Americans need
it the most.” </p>
<p>White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said release of gas
from the Northeast reserve builds on actions by President Joe Biden, a
Democrat, “to lower gas and energy costs — including historic releases
from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and the largest-ever investment in
clean energy.” </p>
<p>Biden significantly drained the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in 2022
following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, dropping the stockpile to its
lowest level since the 1980s. The election-year move helped stabilize
gasoline prices that had been rising in the wake of the war in Europe
but drew complaints from Republicans that the Democratic president was
playing politics with a reserve meant for national emergencies.</p>

Johansson says she is ‘shocked, angered’ over new ChatGPT voice</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-21, from: OS News</p>
<p>Lawyers for Scarlett Johansson are demanding that OpenAI disclose how
it developed an AI personal assistant voice that the actress says sounds
uncannily similar to her own. Johansson’s legal team has sent OpenAI two
letters asking the company to detail the process by which it developed a
voice the tech company dubbed “Sky,” Johansson’s publicist told NPR in a
revelation that has not been previously reported. ↫ Bobby Allyn at NPR
This story highlights just how much disdain techbros have for the work
of creative people. Here’s the timeline: Techbros like Sam Altman deeply
despise and undervalue the work of creatives, believing human creativity
to be merely an equation to be solved, definable by an algorithm. To
people like him, creative work has no value, and as such, is up for
grabs to be taken and cut up for his algorithms to spit out as “new”
works. This story highlights this perfectly. The sleaze runs deep with
Altman and OpenAI.</p>

On Wednesday, we get glimpses of two very different ends of the economy:
Both retailer Target and AI chipmaker Nvidia report earnings. One lives
in the world of consumers facing high interest rates, while the other
occupies the sphere of cutting edge technology. What can we anticipate?
Then, caregiving is a major factor behind the rise of multigenerational
households in the U.S. We’ll hear from one family who came to live
together.

Houston residents are once again rebuilding after a severe windstorm

just beginning to assess the extent of the damage — at a time when
insurance is getting pricier and harder to find. Then, the FDIC’s chair
says he will step down once a successor is confirmed following
investigations into toxic culture at the agency. Plus, can legislation
save local news?

<p>
A group of Tesla shareholders including New York City Comptroller Brad
Lander, SOC Investment Group, Amalgamated Bank, and others, have written
to company investors urging them to vote against CEO Elon Musk’s $56
billion pay package next month, <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>

“Even as Tesla’s performance is floundering, the board has yet to ensure
that Tesla has a full-time CEO who is adequately focused on the
long-term sustainable success of our company,” the shareholder group
wrote. Shareholders will vote at the company’s annual meeting on June 13
on whether to re-ratify Musk’s 2018 pay package, which a judge voided in
January. The letter also says shareholders should not vote to re-elect
board members Kimbal Musk (Elon’s brother) and James Murdoch (Elon’s
friend), suggesting they are too closely tied to the CEO.

to</a> the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Annual railway
electricity usage has hovered around 7,000 Gigawatt hours (GWh) since
2003, making it the largest electricity end-use category in the
transportation sector. But that changed last year when EVs took the top
spot, using 7,596 GWh. The EIA notes this is nearly five times the
amount of electricity EVs consumed in 2018. The numbers underscore two
trends: the limited expansion of U.S. rail, and the explosive growth of
EV sales.

From the BBC World Service: Artificial intelligence has been argued to
be the tech of our time, and lawmakers have been grappling with how to
regulate it. Today, the European Union approved what it says is the
first AI law of its kind in the world. Plus, we hear how Japanese
authorities are clamping down on tiresome tourists. And why has the U.S.

expects South Korea and Japan to manage ties with China at summit amid
growing differences</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Ahead of a trilateral summit involving South Korea,
Japan, and China this weekend in Seoul, Washington said it expects the
event to be an opportunity for its two allies to manage their relations
with Beijing.</p>
<p>“The United States respects the ability of nations to make sovereign
decisions in the best interests of their people,” said a spokesperson
for the State Department.</p>
<p>“Just as the United States takes steps to responsibly manage our
relationship with the PRC, so do our partners and allies,” the
spokesperson continued in an email to VOA’s Korean Service on May 15.
The People’s Republic of China (PRC) is China’s official name.</p>
<p>The summit would come amid a heightened tension between Washington
and Beijing over trade  and after China agreed with Russia to establish
a “new era” partnership to create “a multipolar world order” during
their summit last week.</p>
<p>The three East Asian countries are expected to hold their summit from
May 26 to 27, but the official dates have not been announced. Chinese
Premier Li Qiang is expected to attend in place of Chinese President Xi
Jinping to meet with South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol and Japanese
Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.</p>
<p>The meeting would be their first trilateral summit since December
2019.</p>
<p>Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington,
told VOA on May 14 that Beijing, Tokyo and Seoul should be main drivers
responsible for regional stability and security.</p>
<p>Pointing out what Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said after a
trilateral foreign ministers meeting in November, Pengyu said the three
countries need to “address differences and disputes in peaceful ways”
and “act as front runner of East Asia cooperation.”</p>
<p>Seoul, Tokyo and Beijing are planning to discuss trade and
investment, peace and security, and science and technology, among other
items and include in a joint statement their cooperation on economic
issues and infectious diseases, according to the Japan Times, citing
Japanese government sources Sunday.</p>
<p>Former U.S. officials said while it will be important for the three
countries to meet and talk at the summit, differences that Seoul and
Tokyo have with Beijing on North Korea are unlikely to be resolved.</p>
<p>“With China determined to establish a new China-centric regional
order and because of Beijing’s open-ended support for the DPRK, we
should not expect progress on this issue,” said Evans Revere, a State
Department official with extensive experience negotiating with North
Korea.</p>
<p>North Korea’s official name is the Democratic People’s Republic of
Korea (DPRK).</p>
<p>“Nevertheless, it is important for South Korea and Japan to use this
summit to convey their strong concerns,” Revere continued.</p>
<p>At a bilateral summit last week, Beijing and Moscow criticized
Washington and its allies for their “intimidation in the military
sphere” against North Korea.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Zhao Leji, who ranks third in the Chinese Communist Party, visited
Pyongyang in April and agreed with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to
boost cooperation on mutual concerns. It was the highest-level talks the
two countries had held in years.</p>
<p>The upcoming summit comes after trilateral cooperation was agreed
among Washington, Seoul and Tokyo at their Camp David summit in August
2023 to strengthen their deterrence against North Korean threats and to
defend a free and open Indo-Pacific against Chinese aggressions.</p>
<p>Joseph DeTrani, who served as the U.S. special envoy for six-party
denuclearization talks with North Korea from 2003 to 2006, said, “China
will ask that the ROK and Japan not to align with the U.S. against
China, an issue that wasn’t on the table in 2019.”</p>
<p>South Korea’s official name is the Republic of Korea (ROK).</p>
<p>DeTrani said Seoul and Tokyo will “try to get China to convince North
Korea to cease providing arms to Russia for its war in Ukraine” and “to
use its leverage” with Pyongyang “to halt ballistic missile
launches.”</p>
<p>Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of Kim Jong Un, denied Pyongyang’s
arms dealings with Moscow, according to state-run KCNA on Friday. The
same day, North Korea launched a tactical ballistic missile, said
KCNA. </p>
<p>Gary Samore, who served as the White House coordinator for arms
control and weapons of mass destruction during the Obama administration,
said the summit will become “an opportunity for communication” among
Seoul, Tokyo and Beijing to avoid conflict, but the differences that
grew among them since 2019 will not be resolved as South Korea and Japan
“leaned in the direction of cooperating with the U.S.”</p>

extreme positions. Rather than trying to appeal to swing voters, he

id="why-the-biden-white-house-chose-kenya-for-its-first-state-visit-by-an-african-leader">Why
the Biden White House chose Kenya for its first state visit by an
African leader</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The White House — The White House says it chose Kenya for its first
state visit by an African leader for many reasons — not least because
the East African powerhouse has stepped up on the global stage, offering
to staff a United Nations peacekeeping mission to Haiti that could see
boots on the ground as early as this week.</p>
<p>VOA White House correspondent Anita Powell sat down with Frances
Brown, the newly appointed director for African affairs at the National
Security Council, ahead of a state visit by Kenyan President William
Ruto. They discussed a range of issues, including technology, climate
management, debt relief, democracy, health and more.</p>
<p>The interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.</p>
<p>VOA: In a few days, President Joe Biden hosts Kenyan President
William Ruto at the White House, his first African leader for a state
visit. Why was Kenya chosen and what deliverables can we expect?</p>
<p>Frances Brown, NSC director for African affairs: We chose Kenya for a
few reasons. No. 1 is the Kenya-U.S. partnership has really grown from a
regionally focused one to a globally focused one. … and we see a lot of
complementarities in terms of what we’re trying to do on climate. What
we’re trying to do on debt for the developing world, and on security
issues.</p>
<p>The second reason we wanted to have this state visit with Kenya is
that we are both democracies, and our bond is very deep as democracies,
and our bond is very deep on people-to-people ties.</p>
<p>The third reason is that Kenya and the U.S. really work similarly in
terms of bringing in the private sector to solve global challenges. So,
we’ll be talking a lot about those. The deliverables you’ll see are in
the realms of technology, clean energy and climate transition, of debt
relief, of democracy, of people-to-people ties and on health-related
issues.</p>
<p>VOA: Kenya hopes to soon have peacekeepers in Haiti. Why is this so
important to the administration?</p>
<p>Brown: We do really welcome the Kenyans raising their hand to help
lead this multinational security support mission in Haiti, because it’s
kind of an example of what I just mentioned of Kenya raising its hand to
solve problems even outside of its region. … As you may know, there’s
been planning under way for a number of months. It has included policing
experts from around the world working to develop a concept of
operations. Kenya is not going it alone. The U.S. has provided $300
million towards this, so it’s a big thing for us.</p>
<p>VOA: Are there any other security agreements these two countries
might come up with during the state visit?</p>
<p>Brown: I would say watch this space, because I think security
cooperation with Kenya is a really important plank.</p>
<p>VOA: Is it going to be focused on threats from Somalia or from other
parts of East Africa?</p>
<p>Brown: The U.S. and Kenya have long cooperated on Somalia. I think
you can look for security-related announcements that go beyond that.</p>
<p>VOA: U.S. troops are pulling out of the Sahel and the so-called “Coup
Belt.” What are the concerns the administration has about security in
the Sahel region, especially as Russia expands its footprint there?</p>
<p>Brown: As has been widely reported, we are making an orderly
withdrawal from Niger. I will say that is pretty consistent with our
administration’s [counterterrorism] posture in general that we have made
changes to our posture that are consistent with our CT policy. It is no
secret that democracy is on the backfoot in a lot of places
globally.</p>
<p>If you talk to democracy scholars, democracy is on something like its
20th year of global decline. So, Africa is not alone in this regard. The
Biden administration is focused on lifting up and partnering with
democracies to help them deliver.</p>
<p>You may have seen USAID’s initiative on democracy delivering. We’re
working with a few African countries on that. And I think this is,
again, something that we’ll be talking a lot to the Kenyans with,
because President Ruto has talked about the imperative of democracy
delivering.</p>
<p>VOA: Regarding issues of trade and the African Growth and Opportunity
Act — obviously, this is going to be a decision made by Congress, but
how does the administration feel about the benefits of trade and of
barrier-free trade with the United States?</p>
<p>Brown: President Biden has been really vocal that he sees AGOA
reauthorization and AGOA modernization as a huge priority. It has been
huge, I think from our perspective, but also from the perspective of the
region. It’s something we hear a lot about from our Kenyan partners. We
do look to Congress for that. But as you know, reauthorization is due
next year, and obviously we hope that things can get in motion before
then.</p>
<p>VOA: The President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief — which has been
a literal lifesaver for people around the African continent — is up for
renewal next year. How does the White House see this program as
contributing to national security?</p>
<p>Brown: We see PEPFAR as essential. And as you know, PEPFAR has been
supported with bipartisan congressional support and across
administrations since the George W. Bush initiative initially. We think
PEPFAR is delivering for people across the continent, and we’ve been
proud to support it, and we look for reauthorization.</p>
<p>VOA: When is President Biden going to visit Africa, and where will he
go?</p>
<p>Brown: So, I cannot make news at this moment by announcing
presidential travel. But what I will say is thus far, I think President
Biden’s commitment to the relationship with the continent is pretty
clear. If you think about Kenya, it’s the first state visit that we’re
giving to a non-G20 country this term. There’s only been five other
state visits. … But then you just look at the steady stream of Cabinet
official travels to the continent over the past two years — by our
count, there’s 24 principals or Cabinet-level officials who’ve made that
trip, all of them bringing their own agenda.</p>
<p>I’d also say just in terms of the other ways President Biden has
shown his commitment, advocating for AU [African Union] membership with
the G20 has been huge. Advocating for more African seats and

<p>VOA: You’ve just joined the NSC in this capacity. What priorities do
you bring to this post?</p>
<p>Brown: I think I see this post as moving forward on the affirmative
agenda that President Biden laid out first, and the Sub-Saharan Africa
Strategy, which was published at the end of 2021. Then the African
Leaders Summit, which came at the end of 2022. There were a lot of
initiatives launched by those two events. Now we are running forward on
implementation.</p>
<p>At the same time, of course, at the NSC, the urgent sometimes
competes with the important, so of course, we’re seized with managing
crises. And we’re really sobered by the crises that are happening in
many parts of the continent. So, I see my role as a balance between
those two, and I’m thrilled to be on board.</p>

<h2 id="head-of-us-deposit-insurance-agency-to-step-down">Head of US
deposit insurance agency to step down</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>new york — The White House said Monday that the chairman of the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation would step down, a departure that
will follow the release this month of a damning report about the
agency’s toxic workplace culture.</p>
<p>The White House said Martin Gruenberg would step down once a
successor was appointed and that President Joe Biden would name a
replacement “soon.” The announcement came after the top Democrat on the
Senate Banking Committee earlier Monday called for Gruenberg’s
removal.</p>
<p>Biden expects the FDIC “to reflect the values of decency and
integrity and to protect the rights and dignity of all employees,”
deputy press secretary Sam Michel said in a statement.</p>
<p>The FDIC is one of several U.S. banking system regulators. The Great
Depression-era agency is best known for running the nation’s deposit
insurance program, which insures Americans’ deposits up to $250,000 in
case their banks fail.</p>
<p>Before Monday, no Democrats had called for Gruenberg’s ouster,
although several came very close to doing so. But Senator Sherrod Brown,
the top Democrat on the Banking Committee, who is facing a tough
reelection campaign, issued a statement Monday calling for Gruenberg to
step down, saying his leadership at the FDIC could no longer be
trusted.</p>
<p>Gruenberg was grilled for two days last week on Capitol Hill in
hearings largely focused on the FDIC’s workplace culture and the
failures disclosed in the report prepared by an outside law firm.</p>
<p>“After chairing last week’s hearing, reviewing the independent report
and receiving further outreach from FDIC employees … , I am left with
one conclusion: There must be fundamental changes at the FDIC,” Brown
said in a statement.</p>
<p>Republicans have been calling for Gruenberg’s ouster for some time
and criticized the White House for not calling for his immediate
departure.</p>
<p>Gruenberg has held various leadership positions at the FDIC for
nearly 20 years, and this was his second full term as FDIC chair. His
long tenure at the agency made him largely responsible for the agency’s
toxic work environment, according to the report outlining the problems
at the agency.</p>
<p>The report released last Tuesday by law firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen
&amp; Hamilton cites incidents of stalking, harassment, homophobia and
other violations of employment regulations, based on more than 500
complaints from employees.</p>
<p>Among the complaints: a woman said she was stalked by a coworker and
continually harassed even after complaining about his behavior; a field
office supervisor referred to gay men as “little girls”; and a female
field examiner  described receiving a picture of an FDIC senior
examiner’s private parts.</p>

<h1>
GHC release plans
</h1>
<h4 class="text-muted">
Zubin Duggal - 2024-05-21
</h4>
<p>
This post sets out our plans for upcoming releases in the next few
months.
</p>
<p>
Given limited time and resources, we plan to prioritise work on the 9.6,
9.10 and master branches of GHC for the next few months.
</p>
<h2 id="section">
9.10
</h2>
<p>
With the release of 9.10.1, we look forward to the broader adoption of
this release.
</p>
<p>
New releases in this series will continue at the usual rate depending on
if and when any significant regressions or issues arise.
</p>
<h2 id="section-1">
9.6
</h2>
<p>
9.6.5 seems to be a relatively stable release so far and we plan to
prioritise fixes given the relatively higher adoption of this branch. We
know of one significant issue
(<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/22210">#22210</a>)
to do with object merging arising from the interactions between GHC and
cabal on certain platforms including Darwin with a
<code>brew</code>-provisioned clang toolchain.
</p>
<p>
The upcoming 9.6.6 release will include a fix for this issue along with
others that may arise. The 9.6.6 release is tentatively scheduled for
the end of June, to allow for sufficient time following the 9.6.5
release for bugs and issues to be reported and addressed.
</p>
<h2 id="section-2">
9.8
</h2>
<p>
We plan to continue supporting this release series for the near future,
but updates to this series might proceed at a slower rate than usual as
we prioritise the new release (9.10) and supporting earlier releases
with high uptake (9.6).
</p>
<p>
The next release in this series will likely be scheduled after the 9.6.6
release.
</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">
Conclusion
</h2>
<p>
We hope that this clarfies the current state of our release branches. If
you have any questions or comments then please be in touch via
