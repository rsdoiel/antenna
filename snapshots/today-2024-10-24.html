<h2 id="solving-the-mystery-of-arm7tdmi-multiply-carry-flag">Solving the
mystery of ARM7TDMI multiply carry flag</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-23, from: OS News</p>
<p>The processor in the Game Boy Advance, the ARM7TDMI, has a weird
characteristic where the carry flag is set to a “meaningless value”
after a multiplication operation. What this means is that software
cannot and should not rely on the value of the carry flag after
multiplication executes. It can be set to anything. Any value. 0, 1, a
horse, whatever. This has been a source of memes in the emulator
development community for a few years – people would frequently joke
about how the implementation of the carry flag may as well
be cpu.flags.c = rand() &amp;amp; 1;. And they had a point – the carry
flag seemed to defy all patterns; nobody understood why it behaves the
way it does. But the one thing we did know, was that the carry flag
seemed to be deterministic. That is, under the same set of inputs to a
multiply instruction, the flag would be set to the same value. This was
big news, because it meant that understanding the carry flag could give
us key insight into how this CPU performs multiplication. And just to
get this out of the way, the carry flag’s behavior after multiplication
isn’t an important detail to emulate at all. Software doesn’t rely on
it. And if software did rely on it, then screw the developers who wrote
that software. But the carry flag is a meme, and it’s a really tough
puzzle, and that was motivation enough for me to give it a go. Little
did I know it’d take 3 years of on and off work. ↫ bean machine Please
don’t make me understand any of this.</p>

<h2 id="bhyve-on-freebsd-and-vm-live-migration-quo-vadis">bhyve on
FreeBSD and VM live migration: quo vadis?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-23, from: OS News</p>
<p>When I think about bhyve Live Migration, it’s something I encounter
almost daily in my consulting calls. VMware’s struggles with Broadcom’s
licensing issues have been a frequent topic, even as we approach the end
of 2024. It’s surprising that many customers still feel uncertain about
how to navigate this mess. While VMware has been a mainstay in
enterprise environments for years, these ongoing issues make customers
nervous. And they should be – it’s hard to rely on something when even
the licensing situation feels volatile. Now, as much as I’m a die-hard
FreeBSD fan, I have to admit that FreeBSD still falls short when it
comes to virtualization – at least from an enterprise perspective. In
these environments, it’s not just about running a VM; it’s about having
the flexibility and capabilities to manage workloads without
interruption. Years ago, open-source solutions like KVM (e.g., Proxmox)
and Xen (e.g., XCP-ng) introduced features like live migration, where
you can move VMs between hosts with zero downtime. Even more recently,
solutions like SUSE Harvester (utilizing KubeVirt for running VMs) have
shown that this is now an essential part of any virtualization
ecosystem. ↫ gyptazy FreeBSD has bhyve, but the part where it falls
short, according to gyptazy, is the tool’s lack of live migration. While
competitors and alternatives allow for virtual machines to be migrated
without downtime, bhyve users still need to shut down their VMs,
interrupt all connections, and thus experience a period of downtime
before everything is back up and running again. This is simply not
acceptable in most enterprise environments, and as such, bhyve is not an
option for most users of that type. Luckily for enterprise FreeBSD
users, things are improving. Live migration of bhyve virtual machines is
being worked on, and basic live migration is now supported, but with
limitations. For instance, only virtual machines with a maximum of 3GB
could be migrated live, but that limit has been raised in recent years
to 13 to 14GB, which is a lot more palatable. There are also some issues
with memory corruption, as well as some other issues. Still, it’s a
massive feat to have live migration at all, and it seems to be improving
every year. The linked article goes into much greater detail about where
things stand, so if you’re interested in keeping up with the latest
progress regarding bhyve’s live migration capabilities, it’s a great
place to start.</p>

id="qualcomm-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-flagship-smartphone-soc">Qualcomm
announces Snapdragon 8 Elite flagship smartphone SoC</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-23, from: OS News</p>
<p>At the Snapdragon Summit today, Qualcomm is officially announcing the
Snapdragon 8 Elite, its flagship SoC for smartphones. The Snapdragon 8
Elite is a major upgrade from its predecessor, with improvements across
the board. Qualcomm is also changing its naming scheme for its flagship
SoCs from Snapdragon 8 Gen X to Snapdragon X Elite. ↫ Pradeep
Viswanathan at Neowin It’s wild – but not entirely unexpected – how we
always seem to end up in a situation in technology where crucial
components, such as the operating system or processor, are made by one,
or at most two, companies. While there are a few other smartphone
system-on-a-chip vendors, they’re mostly relegated to low-end devices,
and can’t compete on the high end, where the money is, at all. It’s
sadness. Speaking of our mobile SoC overlords, they seem to be in a bit
of a pickle when it comes to their core business of, well, selling SoCs.
In short, Qualcomm bought Nuvia to use its technology to build the
current crop of Snapdragon X Elite and Pro laptop chips. According to
ARM, Qualcomm does not have an ARM license to do so, and as such, a
flurry of lawsuits between the two companies followed. ARM is now
cancelling certain Qualcomm ARM licenses, arguing specifically its
laptop Snapdragon X chips should be destroyed. What we’re looking at
here is two industry giants engaged in very public, and very expensive,
contract negotiations, using the legal system as their arbiter. This
will eventually fizzle out into a new agreement between the two
companies with renewed terms and conditions – and flows of money – but
until that dust has settled, be prepared for an endless flurry of
doomerist news items about this story. As for us normal people? We don’t
have to worry one bit about this legal nonsense. It’s not like we have
any choice in smartphone chips anyway.</p>
