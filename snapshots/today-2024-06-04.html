id="temperatures-expected-to-surge-past-110-f43.3-c-during-us-heat-wave">Temperatures
expected to surge past 110 F/43.3 C during US heat wave</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>phoenix, arizona — The first heat wave of the season is bringing
triple-digit temperatures earlier than usual to much of the southwestern
United States, where forecasters warned residents Tuesday to brace for
“dangerously hot conditions” with highs expected to top 110 degrees
Fahrenheit (43.3 Celsius) in the days ahead in Las Vegas, Nevada, and
Phoenix, Arizona. </p>
<p>By Wednesday, most of an area stretching from southeastern California
to central Arizona will see “easily their hottest” weather since last
September and record daily highs will be in jeopardy throughout the
region, the National Weather Service said. </p>
<p>Excessive heat warnings have been issued from 10 a.m. Wednesday to 8
p.m. Friday for parts of southern Nevada and Arizona. The unseasonably
hot weather is expected to make its way into parts of the Pacific
Northwest by the end of the week. </p>
<p>“We’re looking at high temperatures well in the 90s and 100s,
temperatures well above average for the time of year — some spots as
much as 10 to 20 degrees above average,” National Weather Service
meteorologist Marc Chenard said on Tuesday. </p>
<p>Southeastern California, southern Nevada and much of Arizona will be
affected most, he said. </p>
<p>“As we go through the week, some of those higher temperatures are
also going to spread north, potentially getting into portions of the
Pacific Northwest as well,” Chenard said. </p>
<p>“We do have several days where these temperatures will persist, and
that usually adds to the impact. If there is just one day, it doesn’t
tend to have as much of an impact,” he said. “But when you start getting
two, three or four days, this heat and then even warm temperatures at
night, you start to see the impact increase.” </p>
<p>The unseasonably hot weather already has taken a toll in some areas.
The U.S. Border Patrol reported on Monday that four migrants died last
weekend from heat-related causes while attempting to cross the border in
southeastern New Mexico, near El Paso, Texas. </p>
<p>Border Patrol El Paso Sector Chief Anthony Good urged migrants not to
try to cross the border in the extreme heat. </p>
<p>“The desert environment is extremely unforgiving, especially during
the summer months,” Good said. “We urge anyone considering crossing
illegally to understand the severe risks involved.” </p>
<p>Fire crews will be on high alert, especially in Arizona, where fire
restrictions went into effect before Memorial Day in some areas and will
be ordered by Thursday across most of the western and south-central
parts of the state, authorities said. </p>
<p>Fire forecasters at the Southwest Coordination Center in Albuquerque,
New Mexico, said weather in the region doesn’t typically become so hot
until mid- or late June. </p>
<p>“It does seem like Mother Nature is turning up the heat on us a
little sooner than usual,” Tiffany Davila, spokesperson for the Arizona
Department of Forestry and Fire Management, said Monday evening. </p>
<p>“We can’t back down from a fire just because it’s pushing 113 degrees
outside. But we do keep a close eye on everybody in the field. Make sure
they are keeping hydrated and taking more breaks than they normally
would,” she told The Associated Press. </p>
<p>Highs on Monday reached 110 F (43.3 C) at Death Valley National Park
in California near the Nevada line. </p>
<p>In Las Vegas, Nevada, where the high topped out at 103 F (39.4 C) on
Monday, temperatures will soar to 10 to 15 degrees above normal during
the second half of the week — peaking at 111 (43.8 C) on Thursday. </p>
<p>A high of 120 F (48.8 C) is forecast for Thursday at Furnace Creek in
Death Valley. </p>
<p>The current forecast of 113 F (45 C) for Phoenix on Thursday would
break the daily record high of 111 F (43.8 C) set in 2016. </p>
<p>Last summer, Phoenix saw a record 31 straight days of at least 110
degrees F (43.3 C), stretching from the last day of June through the
entire month of July. At least 400 of the 645 heat-related deaths that
occurred last year were during that monthlong period.</p>

filed in Wisconsin against attorneys, aide who worked for Trump in
2020</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Madison, Wisconsin — Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul filed
felony forgery charges Tuesday against two attorneys and an aide who
helped submit paperwork falsely saying that former President Donald
Trump had won the battleground state in 2020.</p>
<p>The charges were filed against attorneys Kenneth Chesebro, 62, and
Jim Troupis, 70, and former Trump aide Mike Roman, 51, who allegedly
delivered Wisconsin’s fake elector paperwork to a Pennsylvania
congressman’s staffer in order to get them to then-Vice President Mike
Pence on Jan. 6, 2021.</p>
<p>All three are due in Dane County Circuit Court on Sept. 19, according
to court records. They each face one felony count punishable by up to
six years in prison and fines of up to $10,000.</p>
<p>Troupis and Chesebro did not return voicemail messages left Tuesday.
Roman did not have an attorney listed in court records.</p>
<p>Kaul, a Democrat, has faced pressure to bring action against the 10
fake electors, who have yet to be charged with any criminal wrongdoing.
He has previously suggested that he was relying on federal investigators
while also not ruling out a state probe.</p>
<p>Kaul didn’t rule out filing more charges, saying that the
investigation is ongoing.</p>
<p>“Our approach has been focusing on following the facts where they
lead,” he said at a news conference.</p>
<p>Democratic Gov. Tony Evers offered a one-word response to news of the
charges being filed: “Good.”</p>
<p>Electors are people appointed to represent voters in presidential
elections. The winner of the popular vote in each state determines which
party’s electors are sent to the Electoral College, which meets in
December after the election to certify the outcome.</p>
<p>The fake elector efforts are central to an August federal indictment
filed against Trump alleging he tried to overturn results of the 2020
election. Federal prosecutors, investigating his conduct related to the
Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot, have also said the scheme originated in
Wisconsin. Trump also faces charges in Georgia and has denied
wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Michigan and Nevada have also criminally charged fake electors.</p>
<p>Chesebro and Roman were among the 18 people indicted along with Trump
in August in a sprawling racketeering indictment in Georgia. They’re
accused of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally overturn
the 2020 election in that state.</p>
<p>Chesebro in October pleaded guilty to one felony charge of conspiracy
to commit filing false documents after reaching a deal with Georgia
prosecutors. Roman has pleaded not guilty to racketeering and conspiracy
charges related to a plan to have Republican electors meet and cast
Electoral College votes for Trump even though Biden had won Georgia.</p>
<p>The 10 Wisconsin electors, Chesebro and Troupis, who was Trump’s
attorney in Wisconsin, all settled a civil lawsuit that was brought
against them last year.</p>
<p>Documents released as part of those settlements showed that the
strategy in Wisconsin replicated moves in six other swing states.</p>
<p>The complaint goes into detail largely citing those documents,
interviews and testimony given to Congress about how the fake elector
scheme was hatched.</p>
<p>The complaint details how Chesebro emailed a memo on Nov. 18, 2020,
to Troupis and others arguing that electors representing Trump should
meet on Dec. 14, 2020, to preserve the Trump-Pence electoral slate in
case a court or Legislature would determine them to be the winners.</p>
<p>Chesebro argued in a subsequent memo that the Trump electors could be
counted by Congress if court challenges to his loss were still pending.
Troupis sent both memos to the Trump White House, according to the
complaint.</p>
<p>On Dec. 9, 2020, Chesebro emailed Troupis a memo with instructions
for the Dec. 14, 2020, elector meetings. Two days later, Chesebro
emailed Trump aide Roman details of the plan, the complaint said.</p>
<p>During or around the time of the Dec. 14, 2020, meeting, Chesebro
sent a message to Troupis and Roman that said, “WI meeting of the ‘real’
electors is a go!!!,” the complaint said. Troupis responded with a
“thumbs up” emoji, the complaint said.</p>
<p>The complaint also details how the fake elector slate was delivered
to Chesebro from Wisconsin to Washington, D.C., on Jan. 5, 2021, by
Alesha Guenther, a law student working part-time at the Republican Party
of Wisconsin. Roman told Guenther to deliver the paperwork only to
Chesebro.</p>
<p>“5 mins until I make the drop,” Guenther texted at one point,
according to the complaint. “I feel like a drug dealer.”</p>
<p>Once Chesebro was given the documents, he emailed Roman to let him
know he had them.</p>
<p>Roman then arranged for a congressional staff member to meet Chesebro
and take the document. Chesebro sent Roman a message confirming that it
had been done, the complaint said.</p>
<p>Trump lost Wisconsin to Biden, a Democrat, by fewer than 21,000
votes. Trump carried Wisconsin by a similar margin in 2016.</p>
<p>Government and outside investigations have uniformly found there was
no evidence of widespread voter fraud that could have swung the 2020
election. But Trump has continued to spread falsehoods about the
election, particularly in Wisconsin.</p>

<h2 id="whats-even-better-than-building-new-wind-farms">What’s Even
Better Than Building New Wind Farms?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-04, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjM3MjU1MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcyNTAwOTk1MH0.EQDEmw-QH6WiQi-X5XXdSTjmCUmJ2ZO28yIkzBhljkI/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
It’s not easy to build a wind project. Many of the best spots for
generating wind power are already occupied by turbines. Even if you do
find a good one, then comes everything else — inflation in the supply
chain, convincing a local community that they want a wind farm near
them, leasing the land, and so on and so forth. The whole process
<a href="https://climate.mit.edu/podcasts/e8-why-does-it-take-five-years-build-wind-farm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>can
take as long as five years</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
But what about just making an existing wind farm … better.
</p>
<p>
This option, known as repowering, is becoming more attractive to wind
developers and operators as existing wind assets age — operators get a
more efficient wind farm, and developers get to avoid the many headaches
of starting from scratch. The topic came up Tuesday, in fact, at the
American Council on Renewable Energy’s 2024 Finance Forum. There are
“some real opportunities for repower,” said David Giordano, BlackRock’s
global head of climate infrastructure, on a panel about scaling capital
to meet demand growth for renewables.
</p>
<p>
“When you repower a project, oftentimes you can utilize some of the
existing infrastructure. And that means that you can add new equipment
without the full cost of a greenfield development,” Eric Lantz, director
of the Wind Energy Technologies Office at the Department of Energy,
explained to me. When you install more modern equipment, he said, “you
have higher hub heights, you have larger rotors — you can capture more
energy from that site.”
</p>
<p>
Even if you tear down everything and rebuild from the ground up, Lantz
told me, repowering still means you can use the existing transmission
and interconnection, meaning developers can get more generation without
having to deal with infamously long interconnection queues, which can
impose yet more years on the energy development timeline.
</p>
<p>
Lantz
<a href="https://backend.orbit.dtu.dk/ws/portalfiles/portal/242009754/Kitzing_et_al_2020_multifaceted_drivers_repowering_AAM.pdf" target="_blank">collaborated
on a 2020 research paper</a> with a trio of Danish wind researchers
(Denmark has one of the largest and most advanced wind power industries
in the world) and found that from 2012 to 2019, 38% of all wind energy
development projects in the country involved replacing old equipment as
opposed to building on new sites. Repowering can be attractive to both
developers and local communities, the researchers explained, because
larger and more efficient turbines can actually reduce the net number of
turbines on a given site while generating the same or even more power,
with less visual disruption and less maintenance required.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>Last year, Wood Mackenzie estimated that repowering onshore
wind assets would lead to <em>more</em> installed capacity than new
offshore wind in 2025 and 2026. In 2022, the U.S. repowered 1.7
gigawatts of wind plants, mostly by upgrading rotors (blades) and
nacelle components like gearboxes and generators,
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2023-08/land-based-wind-market-report-2023-edition.pdf" target="_blank"><u>upping
their total capacity</u></a> to 1.8 gigawatts, according to the
Department of Energy. Average rotor diameter increased from 93 meters to
112 meters, adding on about the length of an 18-wheeler to the typical
rotor.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>Repowering has been a favored strategy of some of the
biggest renewable developers, who have large and aging fleets of wind
turbines that often already occupy prime spots. At the massive Shepherds
Flat site in Oregon, for instance, Brookfield Renewable Partners
replaced more than 300 turbines — i.e. over 900 blades — with new ones
that were about
<a href="https://www.fcltglobal.org/case-study/brookfield/" target="_blank"><u>90
feet longer</u></a>, upping the site’s total generation
<a href="https://energyinfo.oregon.gov/blog/2023/2/6/wind-renewable-re-powered-and-recycled" target="_blank"><u>by
some 20%</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
At a proposed repowering in Southern California, Brookfield wants to
replace around 450 turbines with
<a href="https://mesarepower.brookfieldusprojects.com/" target="_blank">just
eight</a>, while a New York repowering increased generation by almost
30% “while maintaining the same number of units to minimize ground
disturbance,”
<a href="https://brookfieldrenewableus.com/news-press/brookfield-renewable-u-s-announces-completion-of-wind-repowering-projects-in-new-york-first-in-states-history/" target="_blank"><u>the
company said</u></a>. <strong><em></em></strong>
</p>
<p>
The rationale for repowering, like everything in energy, is a mixture of
mechanical and financial. Over time, wind turbines tend to degrade, with
actual power generation falling off. Even just by restoring a wind
farm’s initial generating capacity, repowering can increase output, with
newer, more advanced equipment, capacity can notably increase<strong>.
</strong>And when renewable developers have to answer to investors, that
cheaper generation can look quite attractive.
</p>
<p>
The energy developer NextEra plans to repower 1.4 gigawatts of its wind
projects through 2026, the company’s chief financial officer said in an
April earning call, and in January said that it had repowered a quarter
of its existing 24 megawatts of wind. At that time, NextEra chief
executive John Ketchum told analysts that the cost had been “roughly 50%
to 80% of the cost of a new build and starting a new 10 years of
production tax credits, resulting in attractive returns for
shareholders.”
</p>
<p>
“With over a decade to potentially qualify for repowering,” he added,
“it represents a great opportunity set.”
</p>
<p>
Looking at wind projects from before and after 2012, Scott Wilmot, an
executive vice president at Enverus Intelligence Research, calculated
that average capacity factor increased from around 30% to around 40%.
“Swapping new equipment right off the bat, you can get a plus-10
percentage point gain on capacity factor,” he told me.
</p>
<p>
And then there’s the tax incentives. Repowering “resets” the production
tax credit that’s the lifeblood of the wind industry, allowing owners
and developers to claim it for another 10 years. When Enverus looked at
a hypothetical project that had been operational since 2011 and
repowered in 2023, it was possible that its production tax credit for an
additional 10 years could increase from $22 per megawatt to almost $28.
“It really does make the economics look quite attractive,” he told me.
</p>
<p>
“If you can get close to 10 percentage point capacity factor gain, you
blow pretty much any greenfield, new build project out of the water.”

<p>A new point release in the FreeBSD 14 series – the first one, in
fact, not counting 14.0. FreeBSD 14.1 adds SIMD implementations of
string and memory operations on amd64 in the C library to improve
performance, improvements to the sound system, such as device hotplug
support, and the latest versions of OpenZFS, clang/llvm, and OpenSSH.
FreeBSD 14.0 users can just upgrade to FreeBSD 14.1, or you can do a
fresh install, of course.</p>

Law Review Board Nukes Website Over Palestine Article</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-04, from: Ben Werdmuller’s blog</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div class=&quot;known-bookmark&quot;&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;e-content&quot;&gt;</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>
“Eghbariah’s paper for the Columbia Law Review, or CLR, was published on
its website in the early hours of Monday morning. The journal’s board of
directors responded by pulling the entire website offline. […] According
to Eghbariah, he worked with editors at the Columbia Law Review for over
five months on the 100-plus-page text.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Regardless of your perspective on the ongoing crisis in Israel and
Palestine, this seems like a remarkable action: removing a
heavily-reviewed, 100+ page legal analysis because it discusses the
Nakba, the mass-displacement of Palestinians during the 1948 Palestine
war.
</p>
<p>
The right thing to do would be to publish it - as the editors tried to
do - and allow legal discussion to ensue. Instead, the board of
directors chose to simply pull the plug on the website.
</p>
<p>
As one Columbia professor put it:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“When Columbia Law Professor Herbert Weschler published his important
article questioning the underlying justification for Brown v. Board of
Education in 1959 it was regarded by many as blasphemous, but is now
regarded as canonical. This is what legal scholarship should do at its
best, challenge us to think hard about hard things, even when it is
uncomfortable doing so.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
If nothing else, this is a reflection of how sensitive these issues are
in the current era, whose voices are allowed to be heard, and the
conflicts between different ideologies, even on university campuses.

Direct air capture is leveling up. In a surprise move on Tuesday,
Climeworks unveiled new “generation 3” technology that it said can suck
up twice as much carbon from the atmosphere using half the amount of
energy as its previous designs.
</p>
<p>
The Swiss carbon removal company will premiere the new design in the
U.S. at its Department of Energy-funded
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/project-cypress-climeworks-heirloom" target="_self"><u>direct
air capture “hub” in Louisiana</u></a>, with construction to start in
2026.
</p>
<p>
Climeworks already operates the two largest direct air capture plants in
the world, both in Iceland. Its
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/climeworks-orca-data-carbon-removal-direct-air-capture" target="_self"><u>first
commercial-scale plant</u></a>, Orca, was designed to capture 4,000 tons
of CO2 per year. Just last month, the company
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/climeworks-mammoth-5-things-to-know" target="_self"><u>turned
on its second plant, Mammoth</u></a>, which at full capacity is supposed
to capture 36,000 tons per year. Now, Climeworks’ third generation
breakthrough paves the way for it to build a plant capable of capturing
one million tons per year, the company said — a nearly 28x increase.
</p>
<p>
Over the past five years, while Climeworks was building Orca and
Mammoth, it had also been stealthily developing the next generation tech
at its labs in Zurich and Basel with a 50-person team. Like the earlier
designs, the new system uses a specially engineered material called a
solid sorbent that attracts carbon dioxide molecules when air passes
through it. But the company has overhauled both the chemistry of the
sorbent and its structure. The new design has more surface area,
enabling it to grab twice as much CO2 from the air. The company also
said it expects the new sorbents to last three times as long as the
previous material.
</p>
<p>
In addition to a new sorbent, the gen 3 tech will also feature an
updated architecture described as “sleek modular cubes” that “increase
capture efficiency, reduce costs, and boost robustness.” The new cubes
will make the plants more compact, taking up half the footprint of an
older plant with similar capacity. Renderings feature seemingly taller,
boxier facilities compared to the earlier, more horizontally-oriented
design.

</p>
<p>
Climeworks has already tested a full-scale model of its new cubes and
says it has “confirmed the anticipated breakthrough in efficiency and
performance.” It’s hard to know what that means, since the company has
never shared its previous tech’s efficiency or performance. But halving
its energy use would be a big deal, as that’s one of the most expensive
parts of the process. Carbon is extremely dilute in the air, and these
machines consume massive amounts of electricity and heat to extract it.
</p>
<p>
The company said the breakthrough puts it on track to achieve the cost
reductions it has previously promised, with a goal of removing CO2 for
$400 to $600 per ton by 2030. (The price range accounts for potential
variations in the cost of electricity and CO2 storage in different
locations.) That’s about half the amount Climeworks charges today, but
it’s still expensive. Some carbon removal companies, like Lithos Carbon,
which does enhanced rock weathering, and Vaulted Deep, which buries
carbon-rich waste, have already sold credits for less than $400, so
Climeworks already faces steep competition to bring its costs down.
</p>
<p>

from Climeworks on its 2030 price estimate per ton of carbon.</em>

id="lawyers-begin-opening-statements-in-hunter-bidens-federal-firearms-case">Lawyers
begin opening statements in Hunter Biden’s federal firearms case</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Wilmington, Delaware — Lawyers are making opening statements Tuesday
in the federal gun case against President Joe Biden’s son Hunter in a
trial that is expected to feature testimony from his exes and highly
personal details about his struggle with addiction.</p>
<p>Hunter Biden has been charged with three felonies stemming from a
2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the
throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally
licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application by saying
he was not a drug user and illegally having the gun for 11 days.</p>
<p>Hunter Biden arrived at the courthouse with this wife, Melissa, on
Tuesday morning, emerging from an SUV. First lady Jill Biden and his
sister Ashley Biden joined him again in the courtroom.</p>
<p>The proceedings come after the collapse of a deal with prosecutors
that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024
election. Hunter Biden has pleaded not guilty and has argued he’s being
unfairly targeted by the Justice Department after Republicans decried
the now-defunct plea deal as special treatment for the Democratic
president’s son.</p>
<p>The trial is unfolding just days after Donald Trump, the presumptive
Republican presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New
York City. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity
underscores how the courts have taken center stage during the 2024
campaign.</p>
<p>Jury selection moved at a clip Monday in the president’s home state,
where Hunter Biden grew up and where, the elder Biden often says, the
family is deeply established. Joe Biden spent 36 years as a senator in
Delaware, commuting daily back and forth from Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>People just know the story of how Biden’s two young sons, Hunter and
Beau, were injured in the car accident that killed his wife and baby
girl in the early 1970s. And Beau Biden was the former state attorney
general before he died at age 46 from cancer.</p>
<p>Some prospective jurors were dismissed because they knew the family
personally, others because they held both positive and negative
political views about the Bidens and couldn’t be impartial. Still, it
took only a day to find the jury of six men and six women plus four
women serving as alternates, who will decide the case.</p>
<p>One potential juror who was sent home said she didn’t know whether
she could be impartial because of the opinion she had formed about
Hunter Biden based on media reports.</p>
<p>“It’s not a good one,” she said.</p>
<p>Another was excused because he was aware of the case and said, “It
seems like politics is playing a big role in who gets charged with what
and when.”</p>
<p>But much of the questioning focused on drug use, addiction and gun
ownership, as attorneys sought to test prospective jurors’ knowledge of
the case, and dismiss those with strong thoughts on drug use, or who
might want to regulate firearms — some of the very people Biden counts
as constituents.</p>
<p>The panel of 12 was chosen out of roughly 65 people. Their names were
not made public.</p>
<p>Hunter Biden also faces a trial in California in September on charges
of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been
resolved through the deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of
a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.</p>
<p>But Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump,
questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed
guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a
diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed
out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed.</p>
<p>The lawyers could not come to a resolution on her questions, and the
deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top
investigator, a former U.S. attorney for Delaware, David Weiss, as a
special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was
indicted.</p>
<p>Opening statements come as Garland faces members of the
Republican-led House judiciary committee in Washington, which has been
investigating the president and his family and whose chairman has been
at the forefront of a stalled impeachment inquiry stemming from Hunter
Biden’s business dealings.</p>
<p>The Delaware trial isn’t about Hunter Biden’s foreign business
affairs, though the proceedings were likely to dredge up dark,
embarrassing and painful memories.</p>
<p>The president’s allies are worried about the toll the trial may take
on the elder Biden, who’s long been concerned about his only living son
and his sobriety and who must now watch as his son’s painful past
mistakes are publicly scrutinized. And the president must do so while
he’s campaigning under anemic poll numbers and preparing for an upcoming
presidential debate with Trump.</p>
<p>In a statement Monday, the president said he has “boundless love” for
his son, “confidence in him and respect for his strength.”</p>
<p>“I am the President, but I am also a Dad,” he said, adding that he
would have no further comment on the case. “Jill and I love our son, and
we are so proud of the man he is today.”</p>
<p>The first lady sat in court all day Monday, her 73rd birthday,
watching the proceedings quietly from the front row behind the defense
table, as did Hunter Biden’s wife, Melissa, and his sister Ashley. The
president was nearby most of the day, camped at their Wilmington home.
He departed after court adjourned for a campaign reception in Greenwich,
Connecticut.</p>
<p>Aboard Air Force One on Monday night, White House press secretary
Karine Jean-Pierre was asked if the case might affect the president’s
ability to do his job, and she replied, “Absolutely not.”</p>
<p>“He always puts the American people first and is capable of doing his
job,” said Jean-Pierre, who declined to say if Biden got updates on the
trial throughout the day or spoke to his son after the proceedings
concluded.</p>
<p>Biden was traveling to France on Tuesday evening and will be gone the
rest of the week. The first lady is scheduled to join him later this
week.</p>
<p>The case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own
public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent followed the
2015 death of his brother from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11
days in October 2018 and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was
not using drugs.</p>
<p>If convicted, Hunter Biden could face up to 25 years in prison,
though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and
it’s unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.</p>
<p>Trump is set to be sentenced on July 11 by Judge Juan M. Merchan, who
raised the specter of jail time during the trial after the former
president racked up thousands of dollars in fines for violating a gag
order.</p>

<h2 id="intel-unveils-lunar-lake-architecture-moves-ram-on-die">Intel
unveils Lunar Lake architecture, moves RAM on-die</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-04, from: OS News</p>
<p>Hot on the heels of AMD, here’s Intel’s next-generation processor,
this time for the laptop market. Overall, Lunar Lake represents their
second generation of disaggregated SoC architecture for the mobile
market, replacing the Meteor Lake architecture in the lower-end
space. At this time, Intel has disclosed that it uses a 4P+4E (8 core)
design, with hyper-threading/SMT disabled, so the total thread count
supported by the processor is simply the number of CPU cores, e.g.,
4P+4E/8T. ↫ Gavin Bonshor at AnandTech The most significant change in
Lunar Lake, however, has nothing to do with IPC improvements, core
counts, or power usage. No, the massive sea change here is that Lunar
Lake will do away with separate memory sticks, instead opting for on-die
memory at a maximum of 32GB LPDDR5X. This is very similar to how Apple
packages its memory on the M dies, and yes, this also means that as far
as thin Intel laptops go, you’ll no longer be able to upgrade your
memory after purchase. You choose your desired amount of memory at
purchase, and that’s what you’ll be stuck with. Buyer beware, I suppose.
We can only hope Intel isn’t going to default to 8GB.</p>

<h2 id="how-tony-stubblebine-turned-medium-around-in-the-ai-era">How
Tony Stubblebine turned Medium around in the AI era</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-04, from: Ben Werdmuller’s blog</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div class=&quot;known-bookmark&quot;&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;e-content&quot;&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
This is a lovely piece about Tony Stubblebine, who, as it rightly says,
is doing an excellent job as the new CEO of Medium.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“Under Stubblebine’s direction, Medium, a site known for its many
pivots, is finally being strategic about what it wants and where it’s
headed. Last year, it launched a Mastodon server for premium users, and
in March it demonetized AI-generated content on its platform. It is
solidly on the side of team human and is finally starting to see that
pay off.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I worked at Medium in 2016-2017, and I’ve known Tony since 2007. I
genuinely like Ev, too, but I think Tony was a fantastic choice of
leader, and that’s really bearing out in his choices over the last few
years. I was particularly happy when Medium launched its own Mastodon
instance to check out the network and help give it some cloud in certain
circles.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“It’s hard not to want to root for Medium. The assumption for more than
a decade has been that the way the internet has to work will be
determined by what makes the most money for a handful of companies. They
wanted us to post content, then they wanted us to share content, then
they wanted us to watch it endlessly, and now they want us to use their
AI, which will create a bubble we’ll live in forever.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I agree.

id="many-americans-still-shying-away-from-evs-despite-bidens-push-poll-finds">Many
Americans still shying away from EVs despite Biden’s push, poll
finds</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Many Americans still aren’t sold on going electric for
their next car purchase. High prices and a lack of easy-to-find charging
stations are major sticking points, a new poll shows.  </p>
<p>About 4 in 10 U.S. adults say they would be at least somewhat likely
to buy an EV the next time they buy a car, according to the poll by The
Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and the Energy
Policy Institute at the University of Chicago, while 46% say they are
not too likely or not at all likely to purchase one.  </p>
<p>The poll results, which echo an AP-NORC poll from last year, show
that President Joe Biden’s election-year plan to dramatically raise EV
sales is running into resistance from American drivers. Only 13% of U.S.
adults say they or someone in their household owns or leases a
gas-hybrid car, and just 9% own or lease an electric vehicle.  </p>
<p>Caleb Jud of Cincinnati said he’s considering an EV, but may end up
with a plug-in hybrid — if he goes electric. While Cincinnati winters
aren’t extremely cold, “the thought of getting stuck in the driveway
with an EV that won’t run is worrisome, and I know it wouldn’t be an
issue with a plug-in hybrid,″ he said. Freezing temperatures can slow
chemical reactions in EV batteries, depleting power and reducing driving
range.</p>
<p>A new rule from the Environmental Protection Agency requires that
about 56% of all new vehicle sales be electric by 2032, along with at
least 13% plug-in hybrids or other partially electric cars. Auto
companies are investing billions in factories and battery technology in
an effort to speed up the switch to EVs to cut pollution, fight climate
change — and meet the deadline.  </p>
<p>EVs are a key part of Biden’s climate agenda. Republicans led by
presumptive nominee Donald Trump are turning it into a campaign issue.
 </p>
<p>Younger people are more open to eventually purchasing an EV than
older adults. More than half of those under 45 say they are at least
“somewhat” likely to consider an EV purchase. About 32% of those over 45
are somewhat likely to buy an EV, the poll shows.  </p>
<p>But only 21% of U.S. adults say they are “very” or “extremely” likely
to buy an EV for their next car, according to the poll, and 21% call it
somewhat likely. Worries about cost are widespread, as are other
practical concerns.  </p>
<p>Range anxiety – the idea that EVs cannot go far enough on a single
charge and may leave a driver stranded — continues to be a major reason
why many Americans do not purchase electric vehicles.  </p>
<p>About half of U.S. adults cite worries about range as a major reason
not to buy an EV. About 4 in 10 say a major strike against EVs is that
they take too long to charge or they don’t know of any public charging
stations nearby.  </p>
<p>Concern about range is leading some to consider gas-engine hybrids,
which allow driving even when the battery runs out. Jud, a 33-year-old
operations specialist and political independent, said a hybrid “is more
than enough for my about-town shopping, dropping my son off at school’’
and other uses.  </p>
<p>With EV prices declining, cost would not be a factor, Jud said — a
minority view among those polled. Nearly 6 in 10 adults cite cost as a
major reason why they would not purchase an EV.  </p>
<p>Price is a bigger concern among older adults.  </p>
<p>The average price for a new EV was $52,314 in February, according to
Kelley Blue Book. That’s down by 12.8% from a year earlier, but still
higher than the average price for all new vehicles of $47,244, the
report said.</p>
<p>Jose Valdez of San Antonio owns three EVs, including a new Mustang
Mach-E. With a tax credit and other incentives, the sleek new car cost
about $49,000, Valdez said. He thinks it’s well worth the money.  </p>
<p>“People think they cost an arm and a leg, but once they experience
(driving) an EV, they’ll have a different mindset,’’ said Valdez, a
retired state maintenance worker. </p>
<p>The 45-year-old Republican said he does not believe in climate
change. “I care more about saving green” dollars, he said, adding that
he loves the EV’s quiet ride and the fact he doesn’t have to pay for gas
or maintenance. EVs have fewer parts than gas-powered cars and generally
cost less to maintain. Valdez installed his home charger himself for
less than $700 and uses it for all three family cars, the Mustang and
two older Ford hybrids.</p>
<p>With a recently purchased converter, he can also charge at a nearby
Tesla supercharger station, Valdez said.  </p>
<p>About half of those who say they live in rural areas cite lack of
charging infrastructure as a major factor in not buying an EV, compared
with 4 in 10 of those living in urban communities.  </p>
<p>Daphne Boyd, of Ocala, Florida, has no interest in owning an EV.
There are few public chargers near her rural home “and EVs don’t make
any environmental sense,″ she said, citing precious metals that must be
mined to make batteries, including in some countries that rely on child
labor or other unsafe conditions. She also worries that heavy EV
batteries increase wear-and-tear on tires and make the cars less
efficient. Experts say extra battery weight can wear on tires but say
proper maintenance and careful driving can extend tire life.  </p>
<p>Boyd, a 54-year-old Republican and self-described farm wife, said EVs
may eventually make economic and environmental sense, but “they’re not
where they need to be” to convince her to buy one now or in the
immediate future.</p>
<p>Ruth Mitchell, a novelist from Eureka Springs, Arkansas, loves her
EV. “It’s wonderful — quiet, great pickup, cheap to drive. I rave about
it on Facebook,″ she said.</p>
<p>Mitchell, a 70-year-old Democrat, charges her Chevy Volt hybrid at
home but says there are several public chargers near her house. She’s
not looking for a new car, Mitchell said, but when she does it will be
electric: “I won’t drive anything else.”</p>

broadcasters trade ad airtime for advertisers’ shares</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-04, from: Ben Werdmuller’s blog</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div class=&quot;known-bookmark&quot;&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;e-content&quot;&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
This is an interesting business model: UK broadcasters are trading
unused ad space for equity in digital media startups, turning them into
venture-scale investors.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“The move comes as broadcasters continue to face a tough economic
downturn where corporate clients have slashed spending on advertising –
which is traditionally seen as a bellwether of the economic climate.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The thing about venture investing is that it doesn’t have a short time
horizon: exits could easily be a decade away. So this is either a
deliberately long game or a really short-sighted move on behalf of the
broadcasters, who might not be prepared to hold a basket of liabilities
for that long. Of course, they could presumably sell the equity, but
that pressure on the secondary market would have the potential to drive
the startups’ share prices down. Really the broadcasters need to hold
onto their portfolios.
</p>
<p>
I’m very curious to see how this plays out. It’s definitely an
innovative way to use an otherwise illiquid asset (unsold ad space). I
want these broadcasters to survive, and I like the ecosystem-building
aspect of this, so I hope it all works out for everyone involved.

<h2 id="zoom-ceo-eric-yuan-wants-ai-clones-in-meetings">Zoom CEO Eric
Yuan wants AI clones in meetings</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-04, from: Ben Werdmuller’s blog</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div class=&quot;known-bookmark&quot;&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;e-content&quot;&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
Eric Yuan has a really bizarre vision of what the future should look
like:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“Today for this session, ideally, I do not need to join. I can send a
digital version of myself to join so I can go to the beach. Or I do not
need to check my emails; the digital version of myself can read most of
the emails. Maybe one or two emails will tell me, “Eric, it’s hard for
the digital version to reply. Can you do that?” Again, today we all
spend a lot of time either making phone calls, joining meetings, sending
emails, deleting some spam emails and replying to some text messages,
still very busy. How [do we] leverage AI, how do we leverage Zoom
Workplace, to fully automate that kind of work? That’s something that is
very important for us.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The solution to having too many meetings that you don’t really need to
attend, and too many emails that are informational only, is to <em>not
have the meetings and emails</em>. It’s not to let AI do it for you,
which in effect creates a world where our avatars are doing a bunch of
makework drudgery for no reason.
</p>
<p>
Instead of building better business cultures and reinventing our work
rhythms to adapt to information overload and an abundance of busywork,
the vision here is to let the busywork happen between AI. It’s an office
full of ghosts, speaking to each other on our behalf, going to standup
meetings with each other just because.
</p>
<p>
I mean, I get it. Meetings are Zoom’s business. But count me out.

from the International Energy Agency released this morning concluded
that the world isn’t yet on track to triple renewable energy capacity by
2030 compared to 2022 levels – an ambitious goal set last year at COP28
in line with limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. But we’re
not hugely far off: In examining countries’ unofficial energy policies,
the IEA found we’re likely to increase renewable capacity by about 8,000
gigawatts by 2030, which is about 70% of the 11,000 GW goal. But these
policies aren’t set in stone. In fact, very few countries (just 14) have
included clear 2030 renewable targets in their climate action plans,
known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs). The IEA wants
countries to make these ambitions official when they revise those NDCs
next year, but also urges them to move quickly on things like permitting
and grid infrastructure expansion, and in general, aim higher. “The
tripling target is ambitious but achievable – though only if governments
quickly turn promises into plans of action,” said IEA executive director
Fatih Birol.

<p>
The report finds that “due to the unprecedented rise in summer
temperatures and higher rates of extreme heat events,” summer energy
bills have risen from an average cost of $476 in 2014 to a projected
$719 this year. Low-income households will feel this financial strain
the most because they spend a larger amount of their income (about 8%)
on energy. Startlingly, the survey found that the percentage of
customers that couldn’t pay their energy bills for one month or longer
jumped from 21.3% to 23.5% last year, which saw the hottest summer on
record. The largest increase was among households with children. The
report calls for more efforts to ensure houses are weatherized, and
installing heat pumps.

farmers opt for soy to limit losses as all crop prices slump</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Chicago — Mark Tuttle planted more soy and less corn on his northern
Illinois farm this spring as prices for both crops hover near three-year
lows and soybeans’ lower production costs offered him the best chance of
turning a profit in the country’s top soy producing state.</p>
<p>He even planted soybeans in one of his fields for a second straight
year, breaking the traditional soy-corn-soy rotation for field
management. He and many other farmers are hoping to just minimize
losses.</p>
<p>Planting more soy at a time of sputtering demand from importers and
domestic processors will only serve to drive prices lower, further swell
historically large global supplies and erode U.S. farm incomes already
poised for the steepest annual drop ever in dollar terms.</p>
<p>But Midwest farmers’ other main options — seeding more corn or
leaving fields fallow — could have resulted in even wider losses.</p>
<p>“There’s a better chance of making money with soybeans than there is
for corn right now,” Tuttle said. “But if we have another bigger crop,
prices are going to go lower and that’s not going to bode well for the
farmer.”</p>
<p>In March, the U.S. Department of Agriculture forecast farmers would
plant 86.5 million acres of soybeans nationwide this spring, the fifth
most ever. Some analysts expect soybean acres to increase by another
million acres or more as heavy rains close the window on corn
planting.</p>
<p>In nearby Princeton, Illinois, Evan Hultine also increased soy
plantings and scaled back corn. High production costs due in part to a
jump in interest rates looked likely to erode most or all of his corn
returns, while soybeans remained marginally profitable, he said.</p>
<p>The farm’s profits will likely be the thinnest in at least five
years, Hultine said.</p>
<p>In an annual early season crop budget estimate, University of
Illinois agricultural economists projected negative average farmer
returns in the state for both crops, though losses would be smaller for
soybeans.</p>
<p>Unprofitable crops </p>
<p>In northern Illinois, farmers could lose $140 per acre on average for
corn and $30 an acre for soybeans with autumn delivery prices of $4.50
and $11.50 a bushel, respectively, the analysis showed. Actual returns
vary significantly from farm to farm, however, depending on factors like
crop yields, the timing of grain sales and whether farmers own or rent
their land.</p>
<p>Fertilizer costs are down from highs last year, but crop prices are
also down, while land costs remain elevated and borrowing rates for
operating loans and equipment have jumped, likely forcing farmers to cut
expenses, the economists said.</p>
<p>When looking to cut costs, farmers often favor planting soybeans
rather than corn because they require less fertilizer and pesticides and
seed costs tend to be lower.</p>
<p>High interest rates have been a particularly painful expense
recently.</p>
<p>“If you’re borrowing $700 an acre to put a corn crop in at 7% to 8%,
you’re talking about some real dollars there just on the price of money.
You can put a bean crop in a lot cheaper. Your interest cost per acre
might be half,” Tuttle said.</p>
<p>More soy, less corn</p>
<p>An early-spring forecast from the USDA projected soy plantings would
expand by 3.5% this year while corn plantings were expected to shrink
4.9%.</p>
<p>The expansion is expected to swell the U.S. soy stockpile next season
by more than 30% to the highest in five years and the sixth highest
level on record as demand from the domestic and export markets is not
keeping pace with rising production, according to the USDA.</p>
<p>Now, rain-saturated fields in some areas could clip corn acres and
even further expand seedings of soybeans, which, unlike corn, can be
planted well into June without significant risk to yields.</p>
<p>Cash prices offered for the next corn and soybean harvest have
improved from earlier this spring in Spencer, Iowa, where Brent Swart
has been struggling to plant the last of his corn acres due to overly
wet weather. But neither crop pencils a profit at current prices.</p>
<p>Nearly a foot of rain over the past month, seven inches more than
normal, has left his fields too soggy for field work. Swart estimates
his remaining corn fields may not be in shape to plant until after his
planting deadline date of June 1, when crop insurance benefits begin to
drop with each day.</p>
<p>Swart’s best option in some of his fields may be to file an insurance
claim saying he was prevented from planting due to waterlogged soils.
Soybean prices remain some 40 cents a bushel under his estimated cost of
production, he said.</p>
<p>“If you switch to soybeans, you’re potentially looking at a loss. If
you prevent plant, you’re looking at more of a breakeven scenario,”
Swart said.</p>
<p>Only farmers with severe weather issues will be able to file for
insurance, however.</p>
<p>Weather delays and a favorable price versus corn could boost soy
plantings by 500,000 to 1 million acres above the USDA’s latest forecast
for 86.5 million, said Tanner Ehmke, lead economist for grains and
oilseeds at CoBank.</p>
<p>“The signal from the marketplace to the farmer right now is that, if
you have a doubt about your acreage, send those acres to soybeans,” he
said.</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
China and the United States have fired their opening salvos in a
critical minerals trade war. Over the past year, China has imposed
export controls on
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-export-curbs-choke-off-shipments-gallium-germanium-second-month-2023-10-20/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>gallium</u></a>,
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-export-curbs-choke-off-shipments-gallium-germanium-second-month-2023-10-20/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>germanium</u></a>,
and
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-require-export-permits-some-graphite-products-dec-1-2023-10-20/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>graphite</u></a>
— all minerals necessary for energy transition technologies. Then in
May, the Biden Administration shot back with tariffs on critical mineral
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/what-are-bidens-new-tariffs-china-goods-2024-05-14/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>imports</u></a>,
part of a package of trade protection measures to help shield domestic
manufacturers in strategic sectors, including the mineral industry. The
downstream consequence for energy transition technologies such as
electric vehicle batteries, however, is almost certainly higher prices.
</p>
<p>
In all likelihood, this critical mineral trade war will intensify, with
corresponding implications for U.S. industries that use these raw
materials. China’s next shot
<a href="https://rhg.com/research/us-china-trade-war-volume-2/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>may</u></a>
be even tighter export controls on critical minerals, including minerals
for which the United States relies heavily on China. Such export
controls pose real — and serious — risks to downstream U.S. industries
for five key reasons.
</p>
<h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Critical minerals underpin billions of dollars of U.S. economic
activity.
</h3>
<p>
<strong></strong>For example, the White House
<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/100-day-supply-chain-review-report.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>assesses</u></a>
that U.S. consumption of rare earth elements worth $613 million affects
about $496 billion in downstream economic activity across core sectors,
from petroleum refining to automotive manufacturing. Critically, the
United States relies on China for
<a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2024/mcs2024-rare-earths.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>nearly
70% </u></a>of its rare earth consumption. The United States also
depends substantially on China for other minerals — more than on any
other country. Of the 50 non-fuel mineral commodities for which the
United States relied on imports to meet more than 50% of its consumption
from 2019 to 2022,
<a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2024/mcs2024.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>China</u></a>
was the leading import source for 15. Because critical minerals are
necessary in applications affecting strategic sectors such as automotive
manufacturing and renewable energy, Chinese export controls would be
particularly disruptive and costly.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>It would be tough — if not impossible — for the U.S. to find other
sources for the volume of Chinese-produced minerals it consumes.
</h3>
<p>
<strong></strong>To illustrate, the United States does not produce any
arsenic metal, which is used to produce
<a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2024/mcs2024-arsenic.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>gallium
arsenide semiconductors</u></a> for
<a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2024/mcs2024-gallium.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>high-performance
electronics</u></a>. China supplied
<a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-arsenic.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>97%</u></a>
of America’s arsenic metal imports in 2022. If China were to restrict
arsenic metal exports to the United States, American manufacturers —
including semiconductor fabricators, which the Biden administration very
much wants to support — would likely struggle to find non-Chinese
suppliers able to meet their full needs. Multiply this across all of the
<a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2024/mcs2024.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>many,
many minerals</u></a> China supplies to the U.S., and you get a major
problem.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Even if U.S. companies can source critical minerals outside China,
they’re probably still controlled by Chinese companies.
</h3>
<p>
For instance, Chinese companies have significant stakes in cobalt
reserves and production in the
<a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2024/mcs2024-cobalt.pdf" target="_blank"><u>Democratic
Republic of the Congo</u></a>, the world’s largest holder of cobalt
reserves and producer of cobalt ore. There, the Chinese company CMOC
owns the Kisanfu project, which calls itself one of the world’s
“<a href="https://en.cmoc.com/html/2022/News_0701/60.html" target="_blank"><u>largest
and highest-grade undeveloped copper-cobalt projects</u></a>,” and
Chinese companies owned or financed
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/20/world/china-congo-cobalt.html" target="_blank"><u>15</u></a>
of the 19 cobalt-producing mines there as of 2020. Depending on the
extent to which the Chinese government requires overseas Chinese
companies’
<a href="https://www.china-briefing.com/news/chinas-export-control-law-explainer-china-briefing-news/#:~:text=The%20ECL%20also%20extends%20Chinese,to%20its%20export%20control%20provisions" target="_blank"><u>help
enforcing</u></a> mineral export controls, downstream U.S. industries
could be prevented from sourcing minerals produced by Chinese companies
outside China.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Higher global mineral prices <em>could</em> spur non-Chinese
producers to enter the mineral market — but these new entrants may
struggle in the long term.
</h3>
<p>
<strong></strong>Plenty of new companies entered the rare earth industry
after China reduced export quotas and caused
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/23/business/global/23rare.html" target="_blank"><u>record-high
rare earth prices</u></a> in
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2010-07-09/china-reduces-rare-earth-export-quota-by-72-in-second-half-lynas-says?leadSource=uverify%20wall" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>2010</u></a>
and
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-rareearth/china-cuts-rare-earth-export-quotas-u-s-concerned-idUSTRE6BR0KX20101228" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>2011</u></a>.
But when prices fell in 2015 due to
<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2015/02/25/169038/what-happened-to-the-rare-earths-crisis/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>lower-than-expected
demand</u></a>, many of these rare earth companies went
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bankruptcy-molycorp/rare-earth-miner-molycorp-to-start-bankruptcy-sale-of-business-idUSKBN0UM2A820160108/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>bankrupt</u></a>.
Ultimately, the success rate for rare earth projects entering production
between 2011 and 2021 was just
<a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0169136823001439" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>1.5%</u></a>.
Non-Chinese mineral producers may find it attractive to enter the market
amid artificially inflated prices from export controls, but whether
their business model will hold if and when prices fall again is
decidedly less sure. Importantly, China’s commanding production share
for many critical minerals enables it to influence global prices in its
favor. If a new global industry begins to flourish, a glut of cheap
Chinese minerals may not be far behind.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Non-Chinese mineral producers could face capital and technical
challenges ramping up production.
</h3>
<p>
Mines and refineries already operating near their maximum capacity would
have to invest millions or
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/glencore-plans-15-bln-investment-expand-peru-copper-mine-2023-05-30/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>billions</u></a>
of dollars to expand production capacity, which can take up to
<a href="https://www.mining.com/barrick-to-invest-2-billion-in-zambia-copper-mine-expansion/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>five
years</u></a> from starting feasibility studies to commissioning new
production. For mines and refineries with the capacity to ramp up
production already available, that excess margin could be due to
long-standing
<a href="https://gigametals.com/site/assets/files/4861/2018-03-19-hpal.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>technical
issues</u></a> in processes like
<a href="https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/market-insights/blogs/metals/030321-nickel-hpal-technology-ev-batteries-emissions-environment-mining" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>adjusting
the temperature</u></a> during processing. Thus, non-Chinese mineral
supply may take some time — and a lot of money — to come online if China
imposes export controls.
</p>
<p>
The Chinese government has both the will and the capability to impose
mineral export controls — as evidenced by its prior and present use of
mineral trade restrictions, from banning exports of rare earth elements
to Japan in
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/23/business/global/23rare.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>2010</u></a>
to imposing a blanket export ban on rare earth processing technology in
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/china-bans-export-rare-earths-processing-technologies-2023-12-21/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>2023</u></a>.
As U.S.-China competition intensifies, more Chinese export controls on
minerals could well follow, which would cause severe supply chain
disruptions given challenges sourcing sufficient non-Chinese mineral
supplies.
</p>
<p>
So, while it remains to be seen how China will retaliate to this new
round of U.S. mineral tariffs, the U.S. government should accelerate its
mineral stockpiling — including urging certain downstream U.S.
industries to stockpile — and its collaboration with partner countries
to improve the resilience and robustness of their mineral supply chains.
The U.S. government should tread carefully in deploying trade tools in
this critical minerals competition, and prepare accordingly for possible
Chinese responses.

drift to Republican Party stalls amid Gaza conflict</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The war in Gaza is shaking Muslim Americans’ political
loyalties ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November.</p>
<p>Disenchanted by President Joe Biden’s embrace of Israel, many
Democratic-leaning Muslims who once backed him are now vowing to
withdraw their endorsement.</p>
<p>But it’s not just Muslim Democrats abandoning their once-preferred
candidate. Some Muslim Republicans are also wavering amidst their own
party’s support of Israel.</p>
<p>Mo Nehad, a Pakistani American Republican activist in Fort Bend
County, Texas, has seen up close the political effects of the Gaza
conflict on Muslim American voting.</p>
<p>In late 2020, Nehad, who is a small-business owner, police officer
and military warrant officer, helped found a grassroots group in a bid
to engage the local Muslim community with the Republican Party.</p>
<p>Initially focused on opposition to COVID-19 vaccine mandates and mask
mandates, the group, called Muslim Americans of Texas, soon found a new
cause: a conservative backlash to sex and gender education policies in
local schools.</p>
<p>“We were essentially trying to tell the Muslim community, regardless
of what has happened in the past overseas, let’s focus on national
topics and events,” Nehad said in an interview. “And when you compare
what traditionally a Democratic-elected president has done and a
Republican-elected president has done [on national issues], a
Republican-elected president is much better for the Muslims.”</p>
<p>The advocacy paid off, he said. While the Fort Bend County Muslim
community remained solidly Democratic, a small number started crossing
party lines, mirroring a pattern seen across the country.</p>
<p>“These are people who go to the same masjid as I do, people who are
in the same home-school groups,” he said.</p>
<p>Then the war in Gaza broke out after the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on
Israel, testing the political allegiance of Muslim Democrats and
Republicans alike, with both viewing their parties as equally
pro-Israel.</p>
<p>Many Muslim Americans who had overwhelmingly voted for Biden in 2020
fumed over the president’s support for an Israeli military campaign that
has killed more than 30,000 Palestinians.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, a group of progressive Muslim activists launched a
campaign they labeled #AbandonBiden, inducing hundreds of thousands of
voters to vote “uncommitted” in key Democratic primaries in Michigan and
elsewhere. Members were also threatening not to vote for Biden in
November.</p>
<p>Republican-leaning Muslims, fewer in number, have not been as vocal.
While many are backing their party, its equally staunch support of
Israel has alienated some, according to Muslim activists and
experts.</p>
<p>Nehad said that while he intends to vote for former President Donald
Trump in November, some Republican Muslims are reconsidering their
stance and even “going back” to the Democratic Party, drawn by that
party’s stronger criticism of Israeli actions.</p>
<p>“They don’t want to vote for Republican candidates because the
Republican candidates do not want to go ahead and openly denounce what
Israel is doing,” Nehad said.</p>
<p>Drift to GOP stalls</p>
<p>Youssef Chouhoud, a political science professor at Christopher
Newport University in Newport News, Virginia, said the war in Gaza
appears to have paused if not blunted the recent Muslim drift to the
GOP.</p>
<p>Had the war not occurred, he said that as many as 40% of Muslim
Americans would have voted for the Republican presidential nominee in
November.</p>
<p>“I was fully expecting that,” Chouhoud, who studies Muslim American
voting behavior, said.</p>
<p>Now, he said he is not so sure.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t be surprised if upwards of 40% are voting third party or
otherwise testing some vote that is not a two-party vote,” he said.</p>
<p>A recent poll by the Arab American Anti-Discrimination Committee and
The Truth Project showed that only 7% of Arab American voters plan to
vote for Biden and 2% for Trump, with Green Party candidate Jill Stein
receiving 25%.</p>
<p>How the Muslim vote will influence the outcome of the presidential
contest between Biden and Trump remains uncertain.</p>
<p>Numbering about 3.5 million, Muslims make up just 1% of the U.S.
population. In tight races in swing states with large Muslim
populations, though, their vote could potentially sway the outcome of
the election.</p>
<p>But American Muslims are a diverse lot, with interests and priorities
often as varied as the general electorate. While anger over the Gaza
conflict may have unified the community, it is not the only issue
driving their voting decision, said Saher Selod, director of research
for the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding, a Muslim American
research group in Dearborn, Michigan.</p>
<p>“We need to know if [some Muslim voters] are centering this issue as
a major driving force in terms of how they’re going to vote,” Selod said
in an interview. “Other groups, while they might support a cease-fire,
have other issues that that they’re going to vote on.”</p>
<p>VOA asked both the Biden and Trump campaigns about their outreach to
Muslim Americans and any steps to assuage their concerns over the Gaza
war.</p>
<p>In a statement, a Biden campaign spokesperson said, “The President
shares the goal of a just and lasting peace in the region. He’s working
tirelessly to that end.”</p>
<p>In a separate statement, the campaign’s Michigan director said the
Biden team is in contact with Arab American and Muslim groups in Detroit
and Dearborn. Both cities have large Muslim populations.</p>
<p>The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment. The
campaign has not publicly reached out to the Muslim community on the war
in Gaza, but Trump’s son-in-law, Michael Boulos, and a former Trump
administration official recently met with a group of Arab Americans and
Middle Eastern leaders in Michigan.</p>
<p>Historical patterns</p>
<p>Historically, Muslim American voters have oscillated between the two
major political parties. Socially conservative, most voted Republican in
the 1980s and 1990s, leading some party activists to hail them as
“natural” allies. In 2000, a majority backed Republican George W.
Bush.</p>
<p>That changed after the attacks of Sept. 11, as the Bush
administration’s increased scrutiny of the community amid its “war on
terror” sent Muslims flocking to the Democratic Party. In every
presidential election since 2004, Muslims have favored the Democratic
nominee.</p>
<p>But with memories of 9/11 fading in recent years, some Muslims began
to shift back to the Republican Party, driven by shared conservative
values such as opposition to abortion, gay marriage and LGBTQ-inclusive
policies in schools.</p>
<p>“This is the social conservatism within this community kind of
creeping up to the surface and guiding political decisions in light of a
lot of marquee policy debates,” Chouhoud said.</p>
<p>Some polls confirm this recent voting trend.</p>
<p>In October 2020, an Institute for Social Policy and Understanding
poll found 30% of Muslims approved of Trump’s job performance, up from
13% in 2018. </p>
<p>In November 2020, an Associated Press exit poll found that 64%
supported Biden and 35% backed Trump.</p>
<p>Other polls showed a more modest increase in Muslim support for
Trump.</p>
<p>Muslim support for Republican candidates continued into 2022. During
that year’s midterm elections, 28% of Muslims voted Republican, up from
17% during the 2018 midterms, while 70% voted Democratic, down from
81%.</p>
<p>Today, the Muslim voter base is firmly rooted in the Democratic
Party, though a significant slice leans Republican.</p>
<p>A recent Pew Research poll found that 66% of Muslim voters are
Democrats or lean Democratic, while 32% are Republicans or lean
Republican.</p>
<p>Three previous polls conducted by Pew had all shown lower-level
numbers of Republican or Republican-leaning Muslim voters, according to
Besheer Mohamed, a senior Pew researcher.</p>
<p>“There are certain issues where Muslims tend to align more with the
Republican Party, Mohamed said, noting positive views of religion and
skepticisms toward LGBTQ issues.  “Then there are other issues where
that’s not the case.”</p>
<p>Nehad, once an independent voter, is now a Republican. His political
pivot came after he ran unsuccessfully as a Democratic candidate for
constable where he said he felt pressured to champion policies that
clashed with his religious convictions.</p>
<p>This year, he stood as a Republican candidate for Fort Bend County
sheriff.</p>
<p>“Everything the Republican Party stands for, 70% of it aligns with my
beliefs and values,” Nehad said, in a drawl honed over more than 25
years of living in the Lone Star state. “But when I compare the same
with the Democratic Party, it’s only maybe 20 or 40%, if that.”</p>
<p>Zahoor Gire, another co-founder of the Muslim Americans of Texas,
said Muslim Americans “share conservative Republican values” such as
strong families, traditional marriage, traditional gender roles and
opposition to abortion.</p>
<p>“I had family members of my own that had voted Democratic before and
are now voting Republican,” Gire said.</p>
<p>Underscoring the renewed Muslim embrace of the Republican Party, he
said a record eight Republican Muslim candidates have run for office in
Texas this year.</p>
<p>“So that shows you the willingness of people to embrace this party
and then run for office through this party’s platform,” Gire said.</p>
<p>To many Muslim Republicans, Trump is not the anti-Muslim politician
as he is seen by others. They’ve defended his so-called “Muslim ban” as
a necessary national security measure rather than a religiously
motivated injunction.</p>
<p>But the Gaza war has become “the main issue” for Muslims in America,
Gire said. And with Trump urging Israel earlier this year to “finish
what they started,” his perceived support of Israel at the expense of
Palestinians is giving some Muslim Republicans pause.</p>
<p>Asked if he will support Trump in November, Gire said, “We need to
see very specifically what his foreign policies will be, what his stance
towards Muslim Americans will be.”</p>

<h2 id="rebalancing-our-rest-api-traffic">Rebalancing our REST API
traffic</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-04, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<p>
Since we first launched our REST API around 2013 as a Labs project, it
has evolved well beyond a prototype into arguably Crossref’s most
visible and valuable service. It is the result of 20,000 organisations
around the world that have worked for many years to curate and share
metadata about their various resources, from research grants to research
articles and other component inputs and outputs of research.
</p>
<p>
The REST API is relied on by a large part of the research information
community and beyond, seeing around 1.8 billion requests each month.
Just five years ago, that average monthly number was 600 million. Our
members are the heaviest users, using it for all kinds of information
about their own records or picking up connections like citations and
other relationships. Databases, discovery tools, libraries, and
governments all use the API. Research groups use it for all sorts of
things such as analysing trends in science or recording retractions and
corrections.
</p>
<p>
So the chances are high that almost any tool you rely on in scientific
research has somewhere incorporated metadata through us.
</p>
<h2 id="optimising-performance">
Optimising performance
</h2>
<p>
For some time, we’ve been noticing reduced performance in a number of
ways, and periodically we have a flurry of manually blocking/unblocking
IP addresses from requesters that are hammering and degrading the
service for everyone else, and this is of course only minimally
effective and very short term. You can always watch out status page for
alerts. This is the current one about REST API performance:
<a href="https://status.crossref.org/incidents/d7k4ml9vvswv" target="_blank">https://status.crossref.org/incidents/d7k4ml9vvswv</a>.
</p>
<p>
As the number of users and requests has grown, our strategies for
serving those requests must evolve. This post discusses how we’re
approaching balancing the growth in usage for the immediate term and
provides some thoughts about things we could try in the future on which
we’ll update gladly take feedback and advice.
</p>
<h3 id="load-balancing">
Load balancing
</h3>
<p>
In 2018, we started routing users through three different pools
(<em>public</em>, <em>polite</em>, and <em>plus</em>). This coincided
with the launch of
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/services/metadata-retrieval/metadata-plus">Metadata
Plus</a>, a paid-for service with monthly data dumps and very high rate
limits. Note that all metadata is exactly the same and real-time across
all pools. We also, more recently, introduced an <em>internal</em> pool.
Here’s more about them:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<em>Plus</em>: This is the aforementioned premium option; it’s really
for ‘enterprise-wide’ use in production services and is not really
relevant here.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<em>Public</em>: This is the default and is the one that is struggling
at the moment. You don’t have to identify yourself and, in theory, we
don’t have to work through the night to support it if it’s struggling
(although we often do). <em>Public</em> currently receives around
<strong>30,000</strong> requests per minute.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<em>Polite</em>: Traffic is routed to <em>polite</em> simply by
detecting a mailto in the header. Any system or person including an
email is being routed to a currently-quieter pool, this means we can
always get in touch for troubleshooting (and only troubleshooting).
<em>Polite</em> currently receives around <strong>5,000</strong>
requests per minute.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<em>Internal</em>: In 2021, we introduced a new pool just for our own
tools where we can control and predict the traffic. <em>Internal</em>
currently receives around <strong>1,000</strong> requests per minute.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The volumes of traffic across <em>public</em>, <em>polite</em> and
<em>internal</em> pools are very different and yet each pool has always
had similar resources. The purpose of each of these pools has been
long-established but our efforts to ask the community to use
<em>polite</em> by default have not been particularly successful and it
is clear that we don’t have the right balance.
</p>
<p>
The <em>internal</em> pool has been dedicated to our internal services
that have predictable usage and that have requests that are not
initiated by external users. The <em>internal</em> pool has arbitrarily
included reference matching but not Crossmark, Event Data, or
search.crossref.org, which all use the <em>polite</em> pool instead,
along with the community. We have the capacity on the <em>internal</em>
pool to shift all of this “internal” traffic across, and in doing so we
will create more capacity for genuine <em>polite</em> users and redefine
what we consider to be “internal”.
</p>
<p>
Creating more capacity on <em>polite</em> will also give us the
opportunity to load-balance requests to both <em>polite</em> and
<em>public</em> across the two pools. We are at a point where we cannot
eke more performance out of the API without architectural changes. In
order to buy ourselves time to address this properly, we will modify the
routing of <em>polite</em> and <em>public</em> and evenly distribute
requests to the two pools 50/50.
</p>
<p>
The <em>public</em> and <em>polite</em> pools have equal resources at
the moment yet handle very different volumes of traffic (30,000 req/min
vs 5,000 req/min), and with the proposed changes to internal traffic the
<em>polite</em> pool would handle a fraction of this. The result would
look something like 31,000 req/min evenly distributed across
<em>public</em> and <em>polite</em>.
</p>
<h3 id="rate-limiting">
Rate limiting
</h3>
<p>
Our rate-limiting also needs review. We track a number of metrics in our
web proxy but only deny requests on one of them - the number of requests
per second. On <em>public</em> and <em>polite</em> we limit each IP
address to sending 50 req/sec and if this rate is exceeded users are
denied access for 10 seconds. These limits are generous and we cannot
realistically support this volume of request for all users of the
<em>public</em> or <em>polite</em> API.
</p>
<p>
However, when requests are taking a long time to return, we potentially
have a separate problem of high concurrency as hundreds of requests
could be sent before the first one has returned. We intend to identify
and impose an appropriate rate limit on concurrent requests from each IP
to prevent a small number of users from disproportionately affecting all
users with long-running queries.
</p>
<h3 id="longer-term">
Longer-term
</h3>
<p>
So, in the short-term we will revise our pool traffic as described
above. We’ll do that this week. Then we will review the current rate
limits and reduce them to something more reasonable for the majority of
users. And we’ll identify and introduce a rate limit for concurrent
requests from each user.
</p>
<p>
Longer-term, we need to rearchitect our Elasticsearch pools so that we
can:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Reduce shard sizes to improve performance of queries
</li>
<li>
Balance data shards and replicas more evenly
</li>
<li>
Optimise our instance types for our workload
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="want-to-help">
Want to help?
</h2>
<p>
Thanks for asking!
</p>
<p>
Firstly, please, everyone, do always put an email in your API request
headers - while the short term plan will help stabilise performance,
this habit will always help us troubleshoot e.g. we can always contact
you instead of blocking you!
</p>
<p>
Secondly, we know many of you incorporate Crossref metadata, add lots of
value to it in order to deliver important services, and also develop
APIs of your own. We’d love any comments or recommendations from those
of you handling similar situations on scaling and optimising API
performance. You can comment on this post which is managed via our
Discourse forum. We’ll aslo be adding updates to this thread as well as
on status.crossref.org. If you’d like to be in touch with any of us
directly, all our emails are

id="fauci-deflects-partisan-attacks-in-fiery-house-hearing-over-covid">Fauci
deflects partisan attacks in fiery House hearing over COVID</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious disease
expert until leaving the government in 2022, was back before Congress on
Monday, calling Republican allegations that he’d tried to cover up
origins of the COVID-19 pandemic “simply preposterous.” </p>
<p>A GOP-led subcommittee has spent over a year probing the nation’s
response to the pandemic and whether U.S.-funded research in China may
have played any role in how it started — yet found no evidence linking
Fauci to wrongdoing. </p>
<p>He’d already been grilled behind closed doors, for 14 hours over two
days in January. But Monday, Fauci testified voluntarily in public and
on camera at a hearing that quickly deteriorated into partisan
attacks. </p>
<p>Republicans repeated unproven accusations against the longtime
National Institutes of Health scientist while Democrats apologized for
Congress besmirching his name and bemoaned a missed opportunity to
prepare for the next scary outbreak. </p>
<p>“He is not a comic book super villain,” said Rep. Jamie Raskin, a
Maryland Democrat, adding that the Select Subcommittee on the
Coronavirus Pandemic had failed to prove a list of damaging
allegations. </p>
<p>Fauci was the public face of the government’s early COVID-19 response
under then-President Donald Trump and later as an adviser to President
Joe Biden. A trusted voice to millions, he also was the target of
partisan anger and choked up Monday as he recalled death threats and
other harassment of himself and his family, the threats he said
continue. Police later escorted hecklers out of the hearing room. </p>
<p>The main issue: Many scientists believe the virus most likely emerged
in nature and jumped from animals to people, probably at a wildlife
market in Wuhan, the city in China where the outbreak began. There’s no
new scientific information supporting that the virus might instead have
leaked from a laboratory. A U.S. intelligence analysis says there’s
insufficient evidence to prove either way — and a recent Associated
Press investigation found the Chinese government froze critical efforts
to trace the source of the virus in the first weeks of the
outbreak. </p>
<p>Fauci has long said publicly that he was open to both theories but
that there’s more evidence supporting COVID-19’s natural origins, the
way other deadly viruses including coronavirus cousins SARS and MERS
jumped into people. It was a position he repeated Monday as Republican
lawmakers questioned if he worked behind-the-scenes to squelch the
lab-leak theory or even tried to influence intelligence agencies. </p>
<p>“I have repeatedly stated that I have a completely open mind to
either possibility and that if definitive evidence becomes available to
validate or refute either theory, I will readily accept it,” Fauci said.
He later invoked a fictional secret agent, decrying a conspiracy theory
that “I was parachuting into the CIA like Jason Bourne and told the CIA
that they should really not be talking about a lab leak.” </p>
<p>Republicans also have accused Fauci of lying to Congress in denying
that his agency funded “gain of function” research — the practice of
enhancing a virus in a lab to study its potential real-world impact — at
a lab in Wuhan. </p>
<p>NIH for years gave grants to a New York nonprofit called EcoHealth
Alliance that used some of the funds to work with a Chinese lab studying
coronaviruses commonly carried by bats. Last month, the government
suspended EcoHealth’s federal funding, citing its failure to properly
monitor some of those experiments. </p>
<p>The definition of “gain of function” covers both general research and
especially risky experiments to “enhance” the ability of potentially
pandemic pathogens to spread or cause severe disease in humans. Fauci
stressed he was using the risky experiment definition, saying “it would
be molecularly impossible” for the bat viruses studied with EcoHealth’s
funds to be turned into the virus that caused the pandemic. </p>
<p>In an exchange with Rep. H. Morgan Griffith, a Republican from
Virginia, Fauci acknowledged that the lab leak is still an open question
since it’s impossible to know if some other lab, not funded by NIH
money, was doing risky research with coronaviruses. </p>
<p>Fauci did face a new set of questions about the credibility of NIH’s
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which he led for
38 years. Last month, the House panel revealed emails from an NIAID
colleague about ways to evade public records laws, including by not
discussing controversial pandemic issues in government email. </p>
<p>Fauci denounced the actions of that colleague and insisted that “to
the best of my knowledge I have never conducted official business via my
personal email.” </p>
<p>The pandemic’s origins weren’t the only hot topic. The House panel
also blasted some public health measures taken to slow spread of the
virus before COVID-19 vaccines, spurred by NIAID research, helped allow
a return to normalcy. Ordering people to stay 6 feet apart meant many
businesses, schools and churches couldn’t stay open, and subcommittee
chairman Rep. Brad Wenstrup, a Republican from Ohio, called it a
“burdensome” and arbitrary rule, noting that in his prior closed-door
testimony Fauci had acknowledged it wasn’t scientifically backed. </p>

<h2 id="un-security-council-to-discuss-north-korea-human-rights">UN
Security Council to discuss North Korea human rights</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>united nations — The U.N. Security Council will hold a public meeting
in mid-June on human rights in North Korea while South Korea holds the
council’s rotating presidency.</p>
<p>“Some countries have some reservations about human rights issues
being discussed in the Security Council,” South Korean Ambassador Hwang
Joon-kook said in announcing the session on Monday. “We know their
logic.”</p>
<p>Countries including Russia and China oppose human rights issues being
discussed in the 15-nation council, which is tasked with maintaining
international peace and security. They, and other like-minded countries,
argue that human rights issues should be handled in designated U.N.
fora, such as the Geneva-based Human Rights Council or the General
Assembly committee that deals with rights issues.</p>
<p>They could call for a procedural vote to try to block the meeting, in
which case at least nine of the council’s 15 members would need to
support the session.</p>
<p>Hwang told reporters at a news conference launching Seoul’s June
presidency that unlike other countries, North Korea’s human rights
situation is part of the council’s official agenda.</p>
<p>“This is unique to North Korea, and there are some good reasons for
it,” he said. The “DPRK human rights and humanitarian situation is
closely interlinked with North Korea’s aggressive weapons — their
aggressive WMD [weapons of mass destruction] and nuclear
development.”</p>
<p>DPRK is the abbreviation for North Korea’s official name, the
Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.</p>
<p>The council was last publicly briefed on the issue on August 17,
2023, by U.N. Human Rights chief Volker Türk, who said that many of the
severe and widespread rights violations in North Korea are directly
linked to the regime’s pursuit of nuclear and ballistic missile
technology.</p>
<p>In 2014, a U.N. Commission of Inquiry found that North Korea’s rights
violations had risen to the level of crimes against humanity and
included murder, enslavement, torture, imprisonment, rape and enforced
disappearance, among other crimes.</p>
<p>Relations between Seoul and Pyongyang have deteriorated in recent
months. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has said he has given up on
reunification with the South and designated it a foreign enemy state. He
has also enshrined the country’s illicit nuclear program into its
constitution.</p>
<p>Washington says North Korea is advancing its prohibited weapons
program “at an alarming rate” and has launched more than 100 ballistic
missiles since the beginning of 2022.</p>
<p>And in one of its more bizarre actions, last week Pyongyang sent
balloons filled with trash and feces into the skies over South Korea,
dropping them on busy streets.</p>
<p>Fed up, South Korea said Monday it will fully suspend a 2018 military
agreement with the North that is aimed at lowering tensions. Seoul
partially suspended the agreement last November to protest the launch of
a North Korean spy satellite.</p>

id="andreas-kling-steps-down-from-serenityos-to-focus-entirely-on-the-ladybird-browser">Andreas
Kling steps down from SerenityOS to focus entirely on the Ladybird
browser</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>We’ve got some possibly sad, possibly great news. Today, Andreas
Kling, the amazing developer who started SerenityOS as a way to regain a
sense or normalcy after completing his drug rehab program, has announced
he’s stepping down as the ‘big dictator for life’ of the SerenityOS
project, handing leadership over the maintainer group. The other half of
the coin, however, is that Kling will officially fork Ladybird, the
cross-platform web browser that originated as part of SerenityOS,
turning it into a proper, separate project. Personally, for the past two
years, I’ve been almost entirely focused on Ladybird, a new web browser
that started as a simple HTML viewer for SerenityOS. When Ladybird
became a cross-platform project in 2022, I switched all my attention to
the Linux version, as testing on Linux was much easier and didn’t
require booting into SerenityOS. Time flew by, and now I can’t remember
the last time I worked on something in SerenityOS that wasn’t related to
Ladybird. ↫ Andreas Kling If you know a little bit about Kling’s career,
it’s not entirely surprising that his heart lies with working on a
browser engine. He originally worked at Nokia, and then at Apple in San
Francisco on WebKit, and there’s most likely some code that he’s written
in the browser you’re using right now (except, perhaps, for us Firefox
users). As such, it makes sense that once Ladybird grew into something
more than just a simple HTML viewer, he’d be focusing on it a lot. As
part of the fork, Ladybird will focus entirely on Linux and macOS, and
drop SerenityOS as a target. This may seem weird at first, but this is
an entirely amicable and planned step, as this allows Ladybird to adopt,
use, and integrate third party code, something SerenityOS does not
allow. In addition, many of these open source projects Ladybird couldn’t
really use anyway because they simply didn’t exist for SerenityOS in the
first place. This decision creates a lot of breathing room and
flexibility for both projects. Ladybird was getting a lot of attention
from outside of SerenityOS circles, from large donations to code
contributions. I’m not entirely surprised by this step, and I really
hope it’s going to be the beginning of something great. We really need
new and competitive browser engines to push the web forward, and
alongside Servo, it now seems Ladybird has also picked up the baton.
What this will mean for SerenityOS remains to be seen. As Kling said, he
hasn’t really been involved with SerenityOS outside of Ladybird work for
two years now, so it seems the rest of the contributors were already
doing a lot of the heavy lifting. I hope this doesn’t mean the project
will peter out, since it has a certain flair few other operating systems
have.</p>

<h2 id="irans-top-diplomat-confirms-talks-with-us">Iran’s top diplomat
confirms talks with US</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Beirut, Lebanon — Iran’s acting foreign minister Ali Bagheri said
Monday his government was engaged in negotiations with arch-foe the
United States hosted by the Gulf sultanate of Oman. </p>
<p>Asked about the issue at a news conference during a visit to Beirut,
Bagheri said, “we have always continued our negotiations … and they have
never stopped.” </p>
<p>Washington and Tehran have not had diplomatic relations since the
1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran. </p>
<p>The British daily Financial Times reported in March that Bagheri was
involved in indirect talks with the United States in Oman in early 2024,
against the backdrop of heightened regional tensions over the
Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. </p>
<p>The United States is Israel’s close ally and top provider of military
assistance, while Iran backs the Palestinian militant group Hamas. </p>
<p>Bagheri arrived Monday in Lebanon, on his first foreign trip since
assuming the interim role following the death of Hossein Amirabdollahian
in a helicopter crash last month that also killed Iran’s president,
Ebrahim Raisi. </p>
<p>Bagheri said the choice of destination for his visit was “because
Lebanon is the cradle of resistance” against Israel. </p>
<p>Iran supports the powerful Lebanese group Hezbollah financially and
militarily. </p>
<p>The Shiite Muslim movement, a Hamas ally, has traded regular
cross-border fire with Israel since the start of the Gaza war in early
October. </p>
<p>Bagheri, Iran’s former top nuclear negotiator, said discussions with
Western powers about Tehran’s atomic activities were ongoing. </p>
<p>Western governments fear Iran is seeking to develop a nuclear weapon
— a claim the Islamic republic denies. </p>
<p>“We advise them not to miss the opportunity any further and
compensate for the actions that they must have carried out but didn’t,”
Bagheri said, as a meeting of the U.N. nuclear watchdog opened in
Vienna. </p>
<p>Diplomats told AFP that Britain, France and Germany will seek to
censure Tehran over its lack of cooperation with the International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) at the organization’s board meeting. </p>
<p>At the last board meeting in March, European powers shelved their
plans to confront Iran because of a lack of support from
Washington. </p>
<p>Bagheri is due to travel from Lebanon to Syria on Tuesday.</p>

id="on-alaskas-remote-southeast-coastline-radio-keeps-communities-connected">On
Alaska’s remote southeast coastline, radio keeps communities
connected</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — In the remote and rural communities of southeastern
Alaska, news is never in short supply thanks to a small but dedicated
crew of journalists.</p>
<p>“We are what we call community radio,” said Angela Denning. The radio
journalist is the regional news director of the media nonprofit
CoastAlaska and oversees six newsrooms.</p>
<p>All of them, she said, are “pretty darn remote.”</p>
<p>Just one person runs the newsroom in Wrangell — an island borough of
little more than 2,000 people on the Alaska panhandle — while two people
run the newsroom that Denning oversees in Petersburg, another panhandle
town.</p>
<p>“It has 3,300 people. It’s on an island, so no roads in or out. We
take planes, we take boats,” she told VOA.</p>
<p>Denning says their audiences rely on stations like hers for news and
natural disaster warnings. But radio also provides a human connection
that is harder to achieve through websites.</p>
<p>“It’s very personal,” said Denning, adding that listeners often tune
in for updates on middle school basketball games, or just to hear the
voices of their neighbors, friends or colleagues.</p>
<p>That personal connection serves them well as CoastAlaska teams up
with media nonprofits working to prevent the spread of
disinformation.</p>
<p>Communities where agriculture, logging or mining are the main
industries are seeing a growth in misinformation and disinformation,
media groups say. To stem that, organizations like the Rural News
Network and the News Literacy Project work with affiliates, including
CoastAlaska, to offer audiences the tools to spot and debunk false
information.</p>
<p>Local media are often on the front line of fighting disinformation,
said Mike Webb, the News Literacy Project’s senior vice president of
communications.</p>
<p>As the U.S. prepares for elections, his nonpartisan group is helping
newsrooms like Denning’s to equip audiences with the tools they need to
spot misinformation.</p>
<p>Ten years ago in Alaska, Denning said, misinformation and distrust in
media were less of a worry.</p>
<p>“Trust. It was something we took for granted,” she said. But now, “we
don’t assume there’s trust anymore. Quite the opposite.”</p>
<p>To build and preserve trust, CoastAlaska works with its community to
help audiences feel more involved. They have changed the formats of
public forums to allow more engagement and to receive feedback from
their audiences.</p>
<p>For instance, when residents felt as if they didn’t have a voice in a
local election, the journalists set up a way for audiences to ask
questions at a borough assembly candidates forum.</p>
<p>For the first half, the media asked questions. Then they let
residents quiz the candidates.</p>
<p>“We pulled their names out of the hat during the program so that
those people would be able to ask the questions,” Denning said. And
people had to ask their question to all the candidates, not just
one.</p>
<p>It was one way for some people who are suspicious of or don’t have
much trust in media outlets to feel like they were empowered and part of
the process.</p>
<p>“I think it kind of worked,” she said. “We got good feedback about
it. But of course, we approached it very carefully.”</p>
<p>Part of CoastAlaska’s success is its existing connections with the
audience.</p>
<p>“I think it works because we are covering community-based local
events such as who’s going to tell the community how the high school did
at their basketball game over the weekend. That’s us,” Denning said.</p>
<p>In her region, the most engagement their reporting receives is often
on the successes of students or community member profiles, Denning said.
Though, she added, the reporters also cover issues like landslides,
conflicts with the logging industry, and economic problems.</p>
<p>“Our listeners and readers may not agree with everything we say but
they also really appreciate the coverage that we give to the community,
all those little things,” she said.</p>
<p>Despite being largely isolated on islands in the state’s southeast,
Denning’s reporters are always talking with each other.</p>
<p>“If you’re in constant contact with your colleagues, even if they’re
a few hundred miles away on a different island, you can still feel
supported,” Denning said. “During this time of misinformation and
distrust, that’s more important than ever.”</p>

<p>date: 2024-06-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>Another month, another Redox progress report. The Rust-based
operating system, headed by system76 engineer Jeremy Soller, has made a
big move by replacing Redox’ Orbital file manager, text editor and
terminal by their COSMIC counterparts, COSMIC Files, COSMIC Editor and
COSMIC Terminal, in the default Redox installation. COSMIC is the
Rust-based desktop environment system76 is currently developing for
their Linux distribution, Pop!_OS. You really have to start wondering
what the long-term goals for Redox really are here. I’m not saying
they’re intending to replace Linux with it – that’d be suicide – but the
steady progress towards a general purpose operating system is
undeniable.</p>

<h2 id="libadwaita-splitting-gtk-and-design-language">Libadwaita:
splitting GTK and design language</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>There’s no denying that not everyone is happy with the state of the
GTK world, and I, too, have argued that GNOME’s massive presence and
seeming unwillingness to cooperate with or even consider the existence
of other GTK-based desktop environments is doing real, measurable harm
to the likes of Xfce, Cinnamon, and others. A major root cause is a
feeling that GTK is nothing but a vessel for GNOME, and that the project
doesn’t really seem to care much about anyone else. GNOME Foundation
member and all-round very kind person Hari Rana, also known as
TheEvilSkeleton, penned a blog post highlighting the other side of the
story. In essence, what it comes down to, according to Rana, is that
it’s better for everyone if GNOME-specific widgets are moved out of GTK,
and into something else – first libhandy, and now its succesor
libadwaita, splitting the toolkit (GTK) from the design language
(libadwaita). This allows GNOME developers to focus on, well, GNOME, and
frees up time for GTK developers to focus on generic widgets that aren’t
specific to GNOME. Thanks to the removal of GNOME widgets from GTK 4,
GTK developers can continue to work on general-purpose widgets, without
being influenced or restricted in any way by the GNOME HIG. Developers
of cross-platform GTK 3 apps that rely exclusively on general-purpose
widgets can be more confident that GTK 4 won’t remove these widgets, and
hopefully enjoy the benefits that GTK 4 offers. ↫ Hari Rana From a GNOME
standpoint, this makes perfect sense, and I can obviously see the
benefits for them. However, what this entire post seems to ignore is
that the main effect of the split between GTK 4 and libadwaita is that
various GTK applications, now targeting libadwaita because of GNOME’s
immense popularity, simply no longer integrate very well with other
desktops, like Xfce or Cinnamon. GNOME is, of course, under no
obligation to remedy this situation, but at the very least they could
acknowledge this is a very real problem that their fellow developers
working on Xfce, Cinnamon, MATE, and others, have to deal with. It works
the other way around too. Developers targeting the Linux desktop, where
GNOME is more or less the default, have to choose between making a GTK
application that integrates well with GNOME by opting for libadwaita and
leaving non-GNOME users with a crappy experience, or opting for ‘pure’
GTK 4 and leaving GNOME users with a worse experience. Neither option is
good for the Linux desktop as a whole. The very real ripple effects of
GNOME’s choices regarding GTK and libadwaita are seemingly being
stubbornly ignored, neglected, and often not even acknowledged at all,
and it’s no surprise this creates an immense amount of friction in the
wider desktop Linux community. It just feels smug and careless, and of
course that’s going to rub people the wrong way- regardless of the
purity of your intentions.</p>

<h2 id="one-way-forest-carbon-credits-might-come-in-handy">One Way
Forest Carbon Credits Might Come in Handy</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-03, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjM2NTYzMS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2NDYxMDk2M30.bGPE87G9BbyMAL76LWyqY2tQEk0M7a3IA5Ax6rKX3Hw/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Wildfires are razing U.S. forests faster than either natural regrowth or
active replanting can restore them. There’s a nearly 4 million-acre
backlog in the western U.S. of forests that have burned and not been
re-seeded. That’s slightly larger than the size of Connecticut. And
unless we pick up the pace, the shortfall could increase two to three
times over by 2050 as wildfires get worse under a warming climate.
</p>
<p>
These are the findings of a
<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/ffgc.2024.1402124/full" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>study</u></a>
published last week on the yawning gap between reforestation needs and
reforestation capacity in the western U.S. Trees are still the country’s
most important resource to counteract climate change,
<a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/sites/default/files/fs_media/fs_document/GHG-Emissions-Removals.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>offsetting
more than 12% of annual greenhouse gas emissions</u></a> as of 2021. But
in some areas like in the fire-ravaged Rocky Mountain region, forests
have
<a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/sites/default/files/fs_media/fs_document/2020-RPA-Assessment.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>become
a net source of carbon</u></a> to the atmosphere, releasing more than
they draw down. To prevent the reforestation gap from widening, the new
study warns, we have to fix the “reforestation pipeline” — our capacity
to collect seeds, grow seedlings, and plant them.
</p>
<p>
It also highlights solutions. The research was primarily funded by a
company that finances tree-planting efforts by selling credits to
carbon-emitting businesses based on the amount of carbon the trees suck
up, allowing those businesses to offset their own emissions. To rebuild
the country’s reforestation capacity, the study recommends — surprise,
surprise — expanding the role of forest carbon offsets, among other
ideas.
</p>
<p>
Some might look at this paper and dismiss it as biased science, but it
got me thinking about the long-running debate in the climate community
over trees. Should companies be allowed to offset their emissions from
burning fossil fuel by planting carbon-sucking forests? It’s easy to say
no. Too many forest-related carbon offset projects have come under fire
for using faulty accounting methods or for “protecting” forests that
were at no risk of being felled. Plus, there’s the larger risk that
offsets provide a license to emit.
</p>
<p>
But when you contemplate the chasm between the funding and
infrastructure required to restore forests and current capacity and
incentives — not just in the U.S., but also globally — it’s easy to see
why so many people ignore these realities and say we
<em><em>must</em></em> finance reforestation through carbon markets. The
new study spells out the predicament quite clearly.
</p>
<p>
Solomon Dobrowski, the lead author and a professor of landscape ecology
at the University of Montana, was quick to tell me that these numbers
were a rough estimate. “I’m not so hung up on the absolute number,” he
said. “We can increase the precision of that number. But the take-home
message here is that the needs are rapidly outstripping our capacity to
fill them.”
</p>
<p>
Dobrowski studies how forests grow back after a disturbance like a
wildfire, and he’s been documenting a concerning trend. Larger, more
severe fires are “punching these big holes into landscapes,” he told me.
A severe burn might leave a mile-long stretch between nearest living
trees, making it impossible for the forest to regenerate through natural
seed dispersal.
</p>
<p>
At the same time, the government is struggling to pick up the slack. Due
to funding shortfalls, the U.S. Forest Service has
<a href="https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/documents/reforestation-strategy.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>managed
to address</u></a> “just 6% of post-wildfire replanting needs” per year
over the last decade.
</p>
<p>
The average area burned in the U.S.
<a href="https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/IF10244.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more
than doubled from 2000 to 2017</u></a> compared to the preceding 17-year
period. But the uptick in severe fires is not the only reason we’ve
fallen so far behind on reforestation. At the same time fires have
increased, both public and private forestry shops have collapsed.
Ironically, the decline of an ecologically destructive industry —
logging — also gutted the potential for an ecologically regenerative
forestry industry to thrive.
</p>
<p>
Previously, most of the Forest Service’s reforestation work was
<a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/rm/pubs_series/rmrs/proc/rmrs_p080/rmrs_p080_02_balloffet.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>funded
by the agency’s timber sales</u></a>. But beginning in the 1990s,
logging on public lands sharply declined due to
<a href="https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R45688.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
confluence of factors</u></a>, including over-harvesting in previous
decades and the listing of the northern spotted owl as protected under
the Endangered Species Act. The agency’s non-fire workforce has
decreased by 40% over the past two decades. It also shut down more than
half its nurseries, leaving
<a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/managing-land/forest-management/vegetation-management/nurseries" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>just
six remaining</u></a>. Many
<a href="https://www.stateforesters.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NASF-Report-National-Survey-of-State-Operated-Tree-Seedling-and-Tree-Improvement-Programs.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>state-owned
nurseries have also closed</u></a> due to budget cuts and reduced demand
for seedlings.
</p>
<p>
Today, the reforestation supply chain is mostly sustained by private
companies serving what’s left of the wood product and fiber industry.
State and local regulations require companies to replant in the areas
they harvest. But since the industry is concentrated on the west coast,
so is the supply chain — 95% of seedling production in the western U.S.
occurs in Washington, Oregon, and California. That means interior states
like Montana, Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico, which are seeing
increasingly large fires, have no mature supply chain to support
reforestation.
</p>
<p>
The New Mexico Natural Resources Department, for example,
<a href="https://www.emnrd.nm.gov/sfd/reforestation/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>estimates
it needs 150 million to 390 million seedlings</u></a> to replant the
acres burned in the past 20 years. But the only big nursery in the
state, a research center at New Mexico State University, can supply just
300,000 seedlings per year. The nearest U.S. Forest Service nursery
serving the region is in Boise, Idaho, more than 700 miles away. Matthew
Hurteau, a forest ecologist at the University of New Mexico who is a
co-author on the reforestation study, told me he has been working with
the state to develop a new nursery capable of producing 5 million
seedlings a year. The project has received some funding from the U.S.
Department of Agriculture and the state government, but still needs to
raise roughly $60 million more, Hurteau said.
</p>
<p>
Nurseries aren’t the only bottleneck. Hurteau has also been working to
build the state’s seedbank, a time-consuming process that requires going
out into the field and collecting seeds one by one. Another piece of the
puzzle is workforce development. Dowbrowski pointed out that the
majority of tree planting today is not done by government workers but
rather by private contractors that hire H2B guest workers. Due to
federal limits on immigration, reforestation contractors
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/reforestation-hits-a-snag-in-shortage-of-foreign-workers/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>haven’t
even been able to hire enough</u></a> to meet current planting demand.
</p>
<p>
The new paper is far from the first to highlight these issues, and
policymakers are beginning to address the problem. In 2021, the Forest
Service got a major infusion of cash from the Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law, which lifted the cap on its annual budget for reforestation from
$30 million to at least $140 million with the directive to clear its
backlog.
</p>
<p>
But Dobrowski said this is a far cry from all that’s needed. In the
study, he and his co-authors estimated that clearing the existing
backlog in the West alone could cost at least $3.6 billion. And that’s a
conservative estimate — it doesn’t include the cost of building more
greenhouses or expanding the workforce. “The reality is that the feds
don’t have the infrastructure and workforce to address this at scale,”
he told me. The Forest Service budget also won’t address reforestation
needs on private lands, which account for about 30% of forested land in
the western U.S.
</p>
<p>
After establishing the scale of the problem, the paper raises a followup
question: How can we scale the reforestation supply chain? There, it
pivots to argue that “new economic drivers” — like carbon markets — “can
modernize the reforestation pipeline and align tree planting efforts
with broader ecosystem resilience and climate mitigation goals.”
</p>
<p>
This is precisely what Mast Reforestation, the company that funded the
research, is trying to do. Mast is vertically integrated — it collects
seeds, grows seedlings, and plants them. The company has developed
software to improve the efficiency of each of these steps and increase
the chances of success, i.e. to minimize tree deaths. To fund its
tree-planting efforts, Mast sells carbon credits based on the amount of
CO2 the trees will remove from the atmosphere over their lifetimes. It
only plants on privately owned, previously burned land that wouldn’t
have otherwise been replanted (because the owner couldn’t afford it) or
regenerated (because the burn was so severe). The idea is to create a
more stable source of financing for reforestation not subject to the
whims of congressional appropriations.
</p>
<p>
Matthew Aghai, an ecologist who works as the chief science officer at
Mast and another of the study’s co-authors, told me there’s a
misunderstanding among policymakers and the general public that when
forests burn, the government is ready to step in, and all that’s needed
is more funding for seedling production. Aghai hopes the new paper
illuminates the truth, and how risky it is to wait for state backing
that may never arrive. He told me that he sought out Dobrowski to work
with him because he knew, as a former academic himself, that if he had
written the paper on his own, there would have been a stigma attached to
it. “I think the best way for me to get those ideas out was actually
something that needs to happen in our broader market, which is a lot
more collaboration,” he said.
</p>
<p>
There are many climate advocates who believe the problems with carbon
offsets can be fixed, that the markets can be reformed, and that “high
quality” nature-based credits are possible. Indeed, many consider
restoring trust in nature-based carbon credits an imperative if we are
to fund reforestation at the level that tackling climate change
requires. A few weeks ago, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Salesforce
<a href="https://www.symbiosiscoalition.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>announced
a new coalition called Symbiosis</u></a> that will purchase up to 20
million tons of carbon removal credits from nature-based projects that
“meet the highest quality bar” and “reflect the latest and greatest
science.” Then, last Tuesday, the Biden administration followed up with
a show of
<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/05/28/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-principles-for-high-integrity-voluntary-carbon-markets/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>support
for fixing the voluntary carbon market</u></a>, because it can “deliver
steady, reliable revenue streams to a range of decarbonization projects,
programs, and practices, including nature-based solutions.”
</p>
<p>
But there is one fundamental problem with selling carbon credits based
on trees, which no amount of reform or commitment to high integrity can
solve. Fossil fuel CO2 emissions are essentially permanent — they stay
in the atmosphere for upward of a thousand years. The CO2 sequestered by
forests is not. Trees die. In a warming world, with worsening pest
outbreaks, drought, and wildfires, the chances of a tree making it to a
thousand years without releasing at least some of its stored carbon are
slimmer than ever.
</p>
<p>
Hurteau, despite contributing to the paper, is deeply skeptical of
financing reforestation through the sale of carbon credits. “We need to
be making monster investments in maintaining forest cover globally, and
I understand why people look at carbon finance to do this,” he said.
“But you can’t fly in an airplane and pay somebody to plant trees and
have it zero out. From an energy balance perspective, for the Earth’s
system, that’s not real.”
</p>
<p>
When I raised this with Dobrowski, who endorsed the paper’s conclusions
about the potential for carbon markets, he said it’s something he
struggles with. He agreed that a ton of fossil fuel emissions is not the
same as a ton of carbon sequestered in trees, but comes back to the fact
that we need new incentive structures for people to do reforestation and
be better stewards of our forests. It’s something I’ve heard echoed many
times over in my reporting — the unspoken subtext essentially being, do
you have any better ideas to raise the billions of dollars needed to do
this?
</p>
<p>
Aghai had a slightly different take. To him, the one-to-one math isn’t
so important “as long as the trajectory is moving forward, we’re
accumulating carbon, we’re protecting watersheds, we’re increasing the
biodiversity index.” That may sound a bit hand-wavy — and it still gives
a pass to polluters. But then he raised an interesting point, one that I
don’t think I’ve heard before. The environmental damage caused by fossil
fuels is not just the carbon they spew into the atmosphere. And the
value forests provide is not just the carbon they sequester.
</p>
<p>
“Carbon’s our currency right now. It’s the thing that everyone is
measuring around,” he said. “But what about all the other destruction
that comes with the energy sector? There’s cascading effects that impact
water, soils, methane. Forests tend to stabilize everything by moving us
toward homeostasis at a landscape level. For me, these markets will work
when we catalyze them at a regional, dare I say global scale.”
</p>
<p>
Are these benefits enough to dismiss the incongruity inherent to forest
carbon offsets? To say, for example, that trees might not actually
offset the full amount of carbon that Google is putting in the
atmosphere, but the funding Google is providing to get these trees in
the ground makes some greater, unquantifiable progress toward our
climate goals?
</p>
<p>
Some scientists have proposed alternative solutions. Myles Allen, a
professor of geosystem science at the University of Oxford, has
<a href="https://www.iema.net/articles/interview-professor-myles-allen-director-of-the-oxford-net-zero-initiative" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>advocated
for “like for like” offsetting</u></a>, in which companies only buy
nature-based carbon credits to offset their emissions from nature-based
sources, such as land cleared to grow food. To offset fossil fuel
emissions, the logic goes, they could buy other kinds of credits, like
those based on carbon captured from the air and sequestered deep
underground for millenia. The European Union is
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-02-27/climate-crisis-european-union-steers-carbon-markets-to-a-brighter-future" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>currently
considering a rule</u></a> that would require companies adhere to this
principle. Others have
<a href="https://ssir.org/articles/entry/forest-contributions-carbon-offsets#" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>suggested</u></a>
companies could make “contributions” to climate mitigation through
investments in forests, rather than buying offsets.
</p>
<p>
Both would be significant departures from the way corporate
sustainability managers have used carbon markets in the past. But the
current system is in crisis. The volume of carbon credits traded
<a href="https://3298623.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/3298623/SOVCM%202024/State_of_the_Voluntary_Carbon_Markets_20240529%201.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>declined
precipitously in the last two years</u></a> as buyers were spooked off
buying offsets. Forestry-related credits, in particular, contracted from
$1.1 billion in sales in 2022 to just $351 million in sales in 2023, a
69% drop. Within that, the vast majority of the credits traded during
both years came from forestry projects that reduced emissions, not
reforestation projects like Mast’s that remove carbon from the
atmosphere.
</p>
<p>
Even if you agree with Aghai that carbon markets are our best hope at
addressing the reforestation gap, gaining the trust of buyers is a
prerequisite. That means that scientists, companies, and governance
groups like the
<a href="https://icvcm.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Integrity
Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market</u></a> first have to converge
on what these credits actually mean and how they can be used.

<h2 id="they-might-not-make-it">They might not make it</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-03, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Months ago I ranted about &lt;a href=&quot;https://manuelmoreale.com/a-rant-on-arc-search&quot;&gt;Arc Search&lt;/a&gt;. My thoughts on the subject have not changed. Not long after that post, the fun people at The Browser Company released a teaser video for an upcoming 5 video series called “WE MIGHT NOT MAKE IT”. And guess what? My blog post made a brief cameo in the trailer, right after Casey Newton, something I found amusing. Anyway, the series was supposed to make fun of all the people who criticise what TBC is doing with their Arc browser and highlight all the reasons why they’re not going to make it. I guess that’s because they’re so confident in their product and are probably sure that they will, in fact, make it, whatever that means.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
Well, it’s June. The teaser video came out on March 21st, the second
episode on March 22nd, and the third on April 4th. I’m still waiting for
a new one to come out but I guess they might not make it to the end of
their planned 5 videos series. Oh well.
</p>
<p>
Unrelated but can I just say that I find the name of the company itself
quite baffling? It’s called The Browser Company but what they make is a
wrapper around the Chromium web browser. So the browser company is
making everything but the actual browser. Can you imagine starting a
company called “the pizza company” and then outsourcing the pizza part
to a 3rd party? So bizarre.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, TBC people, if you’re reading this, I look forward to your next
video about how you “ruined the internet” and also very much look
forward to the one about how you “listen to your members” considering
you never replied to the two emails I sent to your support.

<h2 id="protecting-artists-on-the-fediverse">Protecting artists on the
fediverse</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-03, from: Ben Werdmuller’s blog</p>
<div class="e-content entry-content">
<p>
<img src="https://werd.io/file/665dd437da6a67804007c6f2/thumb.jpg" alt="OpenAI" width="1024" height="683">
</p>
<p>
Over the weekend, I started to notice a bunch of artists moving
to <a href="https://cara.app/explore">Cara</a>, a social network for
artists founded by <a href="https://www.zhangjingna.com/">Jingna
Zhang</a>, herself
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhang_Jingna">an accomplished
photographer</a>.
</p>
<p>
The fediverse is a decentralized cooperative of social networks that can
interact with each other: a user on one network can follow, reply, like,
and re-share content from a user on another network. The whole thing
depends on an open standard called ActivityPub, shared community norms,
and a cooperative culture.
</p>
<p>
Of course, my first reaction was that Cara should be compatible with the
fediverse so that its content could be more easily discoverable by users
on social networks like Threads, Flipboard, and Mastodon. Cara is
explicitly set up to be a network for <em>human</em> artists, with no
AI-generated content, which will be increasingly valuable as the web
becomes flooded with machine-made art. The fediverse would allow them to
publish on sites like Cara that are set up to support their needs, while
finding a broad audience across the entire web.
</p>
<p>
From <a href="https://cara.app/about">its About page</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
With the widespread use of generative AI, we decided to build a place
that filters out generative AI images so that people who want to find
authentic creatives and artwork can do so easily.
</p>
<p>
[…] We do not agree with generative AI tools in their current unethical
form, and we won’t host AI-generated portfolios unless the rampant
ethical and data privacy issues around datasets are resolved via
regulation.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I’d love to follow artists on Cara from my Mastodon or Threads accounts.
But how does Cara’s AI stance square with the fediverse? How might
artists on Cara find a broad audience for their work across the web
without risking that art being used as training data without permission?
</p>
<p>
The first thing a site can do to prevent its content from being used as
training data is to
<a href="https://www.cyberciti.biz/web-developer/block-openai-bard-bing-ai-crawler-bots-using-robots-txt-file/">add
exclusion rules to its robots.txt file</a>. These theoretically prevent
crawlers owned by model vendors like OpenAI from directly accessing art
from the site. There is
<a href="https://www.robotstxt.org/faq/legal.html">nothing that legally
binds crawlers from obeying robots.txt</a>; it’s less enforceable than a
handshake agreement. Still, most claim that they voluntarily do.
</p>
<p>
But even if robots.txt was an ironclad agreement, content published to
the fediverse doesn’t solely live on its originating server. If Cara was
connected to the fediverse, images posted there could still be found on
its servers, but they would also be syndicated to the home servers of
anyone who followed its users. If a user on Threads followed a Cara
user, the Cara user’s images would be copied to Threads; if a user on a
Mastodon instance followed that user, the images would be copied to that
Mastodon instance. The images are copied across the web as soon as they
are published; even if Cara protects <em>its</em> servers from being
accessed by AI crawlers, these other downstream fediverse servers are
not guaranteed to be protected.
</p>
<p>
By connecting to the fediverse, one might argue that servers implicitly
license their content to be reused across different services. This is
markedly different from RSS,
<a href="https://advertisinglaw.fkks.com/post/102gstp/implied-copyright-licenses-in-the-digital-world-blogs-rss-feeds-and-aggregator">where
this is explicitly not the case</a>: there is legal precedent that says
my RSS feed <em>cannot</em> be used to republish my content elsewhere
without my permission (although you can, of course, access its content
in a private feed reader; that’s the point). But on the fediverse, the
ability to reshare across platforms is core functionality.
</p>
<p>
The following things are all true:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Content published to the fediverse may be both re-copied to and served
from other peoples’ servers
</li>
<li>
Those servers may have different policies regarding content use
</li>
<li>
In the absence of a robots.txt directive, AI crawlers will scrape a
website’s data, even if they don’t have the legal right to
</li>
<li>
Some servers may themselves be owned by AI vendors and may use federated
content to train generative models even without the use of a scraper
</li>
</ul>
<p>
As a result, there is no way an author can protect it from being used in
an AI training set. The owners of a fediverse site wouldn’t have the
right to make a <em>deal</em> with an AI vendor to sell the content it
hosted because they wouldn’t have the copyright to all of that content
in the first place. But because AI crawlers greedily scrape content
without asking for permission, unless the site explicitly opts out with
robots.txt, it doesn’t matter.
</p>
<p>
This leads me to a few conclusions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
It is a moral obligation for every fediverse site to prevent crawling of
federated content by robustly setting robots.txt directives at a minimum
</li>
<li>
Discussions about adding
<a href="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/fep-c118-content-licensing-support/2903/1">content
licensing support to the fediverse</a> are even more important than they
appear
</li>
<li>
Someone needs to legally prevent AI vendors from using all available
data as training fodder
</li>
</ul>
<p>
A fediverse (and a web!) where Cara can safely join while adhering to
its principles is a more functional, safer network. To build it we’ll
need to support explicit licensing on the fediverse, create a stronger
standard for user protections across fediverse sites, and seek more
robust legal protections against AI crawler activity. While these are
ambitious goals, I believe they’re achievable — and necessary to support
the artists and content creators who make the web their home.

unveils Ryzen 9000 CPUs for desktop, Zen 5 takes center stage at
Computex 2024</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>In regards to performance, AMD is touting an average (geomean) IPC
increase in desktop workloads for Zen 5 of 16%. And with the new desktop
Ryzen chips’ turbo clockspeeds remaining largely identical to their
Ryzen 7000 predecessors, this should translate into similar performance
expectations for the new chips. The AMD Ryzen 9000 series will also
launch on the AM5 socket, which debuted with AMD’s Ryzen 7000 series and
marks AMD’s commitment to socket/platform longevity. Along with the
Ryzen 9000 series will come a pair of new high-performance chipsets: the
X870E (Extreme) and the regular X870 chipsets. The fundamental features
that vendors will integrate into their specific motherboards remain
tight-lipped. Still, we do know that USB 4.0 ports are standard on the
X870E/X870 boards, along with PCIe 5.0 for both PCIe graphics and NVMe
storage, with higher AMD EXPO memory profile support expected than
previous generations. ↫ Gavin Bonshor at AnandTech I absolutely love
that AMD maintains compatibility with its chipset and socket generations
as well as it does. I’m currently running a Ryzen 9 7900X, and I see no
reason to upgrade any time soon, but it’s good to know I’ll at least
have otions once the time comes. Compare this to Intel, which broke
compatibility pretty much intentionally almost every generation for
years now, and this is a huge win for consumers. Of course, as AMD
regains more and more of its foothold across the market, it will
eventually also resort to the kind of tactics Intel has been using while
it pretty much had the market to itself. It’s only a matter of time
before we’ll see the first new Ryzen generation that mysteriously
requires a new socket or chipset out of the blue.</p>

a secure embedded operating system for microcontrollers</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>Tock is an embedded operating system designed for running multiple
concurrent, mutually distrustful applications on Cortex-M and RISC-V
based embedded platforms. Tock’s design centers around protection, both
from potentially malicious applications and from device drivers. Tock
uses two mechanisms to protect different components of the operating
system. First, the kernel and device drivers are written in Rust, a
systems programming language that provides compile-time memory safety
and type safety. Tock uses Rust to protect the kernel (e.g. the
scheduler and hardware abstraction layer) from platform specific device
drivers as well as isolate device drivers from each other. Second, Tock
uses memory protection units to isolate applications from each other and
the kernel. ↫ Tock GitHub page We’ve never featured Tock on OSNews
before, as far as I can tell, which seems odd considering it’s been
around for a while. The most recent release stems from January 2023, so
a short while ago, but that’s not too surprising considering the target
audience of this embedded operating system. It’s licensed under either
Apache or MIT.</p>

veterans get heroes’ welcome in France ahead of D-Day anniversary</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>DEAUVILLE/PARIS — Crowds cheered and applauded as U.S. veterans
arrived at French airports ahead of ceremonies marking the 80th
anniversary of D-Day, when more than 150,000 Allied soldiers landed in
Normandy to drive out Nazi Germany forces.  </p>
<p>Many of those flying in over the weekend into Monday were older than
100, pushed on wheelchairs by relatives and aides.  </p>
<p>“It’s unreal. It’s unreal. Wow,” 107-year-old Reynolds Tomter said at
Paris Charles-de-Gaulle airport as students waved U.S. and French flags
and held up photos of the veterans.  </p>
<p>“It feels great … and I’m so thankful that I got the opportunity to
be back out here, my son with me,” said 101-year-old Bill Wall, as his
son, Ray, pushed him through arrivals.</p>
<p>“I lost some great friends. All of these people who are out there on
their crosses and unmarked graves are the true heroes. It gives me a
chance to pay tribute to them which they so need. It will bring back
some memories of some great people,” he added.</p>
<p>After shaking hands with students, 95-year-old Dave Yoho said: “My
heart is full. My heart is full.”  </p>
<p>In Deauville, Normandy, a specially chartered flight landed on
Monday.  </p>
<p>Across Normandy, where beaches and fields still bear the scars of the
fighting that erupted on June 6, 1944 and the weeks that followed,
preparations were in full gear for official ceremonies. World leaders
from U.S. President Joe Biden to German Chancellor Olaf Scholz will
attend.  </p>
<p>Already, at the weekend, in Vierville-sur-Mer, a town just above
Omaha Beach - one of the sectors where U.S. soldiers landed - a
re-enactment camp was set up, giving visitors a chance to see what
equipment the soldiers were using.  </p>
<p>People took rides in World War Two jeeps and armored vehicles.  </p>
<p>“It’s always very intense when we meet veterans, because they always
have many stories to tell, and you still feel the emotion,” said Julie
Boisard, who lives in Normandy and took part in the re-enactment.  </p>
<p>A handful of serving members of the Virginia National Guard 29th
Infantry Division gazed out over the beach their elders stormed 80 years
earlier.  </p>
<p>“It’s historic, it’s memorable … and it’s very emotional as well,”
said U.S. serviceman Esaw Lee. “Those guys were so courageous and so
mythical. They were legendary.”  </p>
<p>With war raging on Europe’s borders in 2024, this anniversary’s D-Day
ceremony will carry special resonance.  </p>
<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy will be among the guests.
Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022,
touching off Europe’s biggest armed conflict since World War Two, was
not invited to the D-Day events.  </p>
<p>The commemorations “remind us that we were occupied for four years
and were liberated by the Americans,” said Marie-Therese Legallois, who
was seven at the time of D-Day, and remembers it vividly.  </p>
<p>“But I always have a bit of sadness to see that the war continues, in
Ukraine or elsewhere.”</p>

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its

There are several reasons: Demand growth remains slow, interest rates
remain high, and the U.S. is ramping up production. All of this means
OPEC+ isn’t keen to boost supply for fear of depressing oil prices,
which have hovered around $80 per barrel recently, down from $90 in
April, and much lower than OPEC’s desired $100 per barrel.

its new EV minivan “the electric reincarnation of the iconic Microbus.”
But while the ID.Buzz may be a touchscreens-and-LEDs update on the

</p>
<p>
On an August morning in 1968, a Volkswagen bus jammed full of Caltech
students who had hacked it to run on battery power departed their home
base in Pasadena, California. Their destination: Cambridge,
Massachusetts, home of rival MIT. At the same moment, MIT students in an
electrified Chevy

left the East Coast bound for the West.

“I came up with the crazy idea of a cross-country electric car race
between Caltech and MIT,” said Wally Rippel, the student who owned that

<p>
The great electric car race of 1968 carried the energy of a world’s
fair, offering gawkers along its transcontinental route the chance to
see the vehicles of the future. It would be another half-century before
the EV finally went mainstream, of course. But the Caltech-MIT
competition presaged what electric car builders and drivers would need
to overcome, and their race is a reminder that the electric car wasn’t
just an idea forsaken soon after the dawn of the automotive industry and
then suddenly resurrected by Tesla. All along, engineers and scientists
imagined another way.
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p class="drop-caps">
Climate change is the reason for the whole electric vehicle revolution
this century, but it wasn’t the animating force for the EV tinkerers of
the ’60s. Wally Rippel, who owned the Caltech VW bus, and his
compatriots were focused on solving
<a href="https://www.caltech.edu/about/news/fifty-years-clearing-skies-39248" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>smog</u></a>
and air pollution, the car-related environmental calamities of that era.
In his Caltech talk, Rippel compared the air quality of that smoggy era
to the fire-and-brimstone atmosphere of hell itself. “I don’t think any
of you could understand it if you didn’t live in Pasadena in the ’60s,”
he said.
</p>
<p>
Since 80% of L.A.’s smog came from automotive exhaust, Rippel came to
the
<a href="https://www.eas.caltech.edu/documents/6044/Electric-Vehicles-VWBus.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>conclusion</u></a>
that the internal combustion engine should be replaced. The question
was, replaced with what? Fuel cells were used during the space race of
the 1960s, but they were maddeningly expensive and could provide only
1/20th of the energy he needed to move a car. After seeing
electric-powered golf carts around campus, he thought of the electric
car.
</p>
<p>
Just like the climate activists to come, they faced their doubters when
the EV race got under way. Team member Dick Rubenstein reminisced in an
<a href="https://calteches.library.caltech.edu/276/1/bust.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>article</u></a>
about the race: “I remember the service station attendant at Amboy. He
thought it was all a joke and asked: ‘What do you need an electric car
for, anyway? What air pollution?’”
</p>
<p>
The challenges of long-distance EV driving were all present in 1968.
Rippel wondered, like many people do today, how much more electricity
the nation would need to power a country full of EVs. After whipping out
his slide rule and performing a few calculations, he determined the U.S.
would need 20 to 25 percent more electricity, a reasonable goal.
</p>
<p>
Rippel and company needed charging stations, of course. The Electric
Fuel Propulsion Corporation of Michigan worked with utilities to set up
55 charging stations on the route across the country. Now, those stops
didn’t look quite like the Tesla Superchargers of today, located in
outlet mall parking lots. Rippel explained that some of their stops
amounted to nothing more than a connection to a power line tower or a
wire coming up from a manhole.
</p>
<p>
It typically took 45 to 60 minutes to recharge using the onboard 30kW
charger that Rippel put in the bus. That’s not <em><em>that</em></em>
far off from today’s times, even though the students ran lead-acid and
nickel-cadmium batteries rather than the lithium-ion that is today’s
state of the art. (Caltech’s VW carried a literal <em><em>ton</em></em>
of batteries to store 16 kWh of energy.) Still: After blowing fuses and
causing a power outage in Seligman, Arizona, the Caltech team had to
start charging at a lower speed in order to avoid overloading the
technology of the time.
</p>
<p>
Range anxiety was naturally worse, given the experimental technology and
the need to make it to the next station on the list. Both teams had
chase cars accompanying their EV and occasionally resorted to towing the
electric car when mechanical gremlins struck. Caltech towed a generator
along just in case.
</p>
<p>
The biggest enemy? Heat. Today’s EV batteries suffer under extreme
temperatures, with heat degrading battery life and cold diminishing
range. But modern EVs have sophisticated cooling mechanisms to help
protect the cells. The student EVs did not have this. They resorted to a
simpler fix: dumping ice on the batteries during charging stops.
</p>
<p>
Wrote Rubenstein: “We finally solved our battery overheating problem in
McLean, Texas. While the car was charging, I went into town to buy some
rubber tubing and a rubber syringe bulb. We got some small ice cubes and
put them on the batteries, then used the tubing to siphon the water out
of the battery enclosure. We used the syringe bulb to start the siphon.
That was our handy-dandy cooling system, for which I blushingly accept
credit.”
</p>
<p>
In other ways, their simple EV technology is startlingly familiar. The
VW bus nearly didn’t make it to the charging stop in the desert of
Needles, California, but used the downhill grade into town to put some
charge back on the battery, just as regenerative braking in today’s EVs
saves energy when the car is decelerating or rolling downhill. (Today,
Needles is home to several EV fast-charging stations, befitting its
nature as one of the rare pit stops on this lonely stretch of desert
highway.)
</p>
<p>
The article in Caltech’s <em><em>Engineering &amp; Science</em></em>
magazine concludes by saying future lead-cobalt rechargeable batteries
might reach 250 miles of range — just about what lithium-ion batteries
were <em><em>actually</em></em> doing a half-century later, when cars
like the Tesla Model 3 arrived.
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p class="drop-caps">
The race ended nine days later, on September 4. MIT reached the end of
the line first, by about a day and a half. But, per the agreed-upon
rules, its team was dinged with many hours’ worth of time penalties
because of how often the electric Chevy Corvair had to be towed —
including across the finish line. The EV van from Pasadena, for all its
own troubles, reached MIT under its own power and was, eventually,
declared the winner.
</p>
<p>
In retrospect, the race looks like a one-off — a moment when young
scientists with a dream tried to show the world a better way but decades
before the world was ready to see it. In fact, though, this calamitous,
makeshift Cannonball Run left threads that led to the electrification of
vehicles that’s finally happening around the world.
</p>
<p>
The next generation of idealistic auto engineers created the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunraycer" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Sunraycer</u></a>,
a 1980s solar-powered race car that crossed the Australian Outback. Its
success led to the
<a href="https://www.gm.com/heritage/collection/gm-concept/1990-impact-experimental" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>GM
Impact</u></a>, a 1990 concept EV meant to show the world what was
possible. And the Impact led to the fabled, doomed GM EV1.
</p>
<p>
EV1 is remembered as the electric car that wasn’t, the victim in the
case of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Killed_the_Electric_Car%3F" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>Who
Killed the Electric Car</em></em></u></a>? But attempts like it and the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC_Propulsion_tzero" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>AC
Propulsion tZero</u></a> in the 1990s showed that EVs were not only
possible, but could be downright cool if you did them right. The rest is
history.

<p>
This week, we’re examining the ways cities are adapting to the future of
how we live and work. Some of these changes were sped up by the
pandemic, but some are a long-time coming — like evolving tech in the
auto industry. In Detroit, an abandoned train station has been brought
back to life by the Ford Motor Company as a center for tech innovation.
Will the investment pay off? But first: automakers and deep sea mining.

got hefty pay raises in 2023, widening the gap with the workers they
oversee</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — The typical compensation package for chief executives who
run companies in the S&amp;P 500 jumped nearly 13% last year, easily
surpassing the gains for workers at a time when inflation was putting
considerable pressure on Americans’ budgets.</p>
<p>The median pay package for CEOs rose to $16.3 million, up 12.6%,
according to data analyzed for The Associated Press by Equilar.
Meanwhile, wages and benefits netted by private-sector workers rose 4.1%
through 2023. At half the companies in this year’s pay survey, it would
take the worker at the middle of the company’s pay scale almost 200
years to make what their CEO did.</p>
<p>CEOs got rewarded as the economy showed remarkable resilience,
underpinning strong profits and boosting stock prices. After navigating
the pandemic, companies faced challenges from persistent inflation and
higher interest rates. About two dozen CEOs in the AP’s annual survey
received a pay bump of 50% or more.</p>
<p>“In this post-pandemic market, the desire is for boards to reward and
retain CEOs when they feel like they have a good leader in place,” said
Kelly Malafis, founding partner of Compensation Advisory Partners in New
York. “That all combined kind of leads to increased compensation.”</p>
<p>But Sarah Anderson, who directs the Global Economy Project at the
progressive Institute for Policy Studies, believes the gap in earnings
between top executives and workers plays into the overall
dissatisfaction among Americans about the economy.</p>
<p>“Most of the focus here is on inflation, which people are really
feeling, but they’re feeling the pain of inflation more because they’re
not seeing their wages go up enough,” she said.</p>
<p>Many companies have heeded calls from shareholders to tie CEO
compensation more closely to performance. As a result, a large
proportion of pay packages consist of stock awards, which the CEO often
can’t cash in for years, if at all, unless the company meets certain
targets, typically a higher stock price or market value or improved
operating profits. The median stock award rose almost 11% last year
compared to a 2.7% increase in bonuses.</p>
<p>The AP’s CEO compensation study included pay data for 341 executives
at S&amp;P 500 companies who have served at least two full consecutive
fiscal years at their companies, which filed proxy statements between
Jan. 1 and April 30.</p>
<p>Top earners</p>
<p>Hock Tan, the CEO of Broadcom Inc., topped the AP survey with a pay
package valued at about $162 million.</p>
<p>Broadcom granted Tan stock awards valued at $160.5 million on
Oct. 31, 2022, for the company’s 2023 fiscal year. Tan was given the
opportunity to earn up to 1 million shares starting in fiscal 2025,
according to a securities filing, provided that Broadcom’s stock meets
certain targets – and he remains CEO for five years.</p>
<p>At the time of the award, Broadcom’s stock was trading at $470. Tan
would receive portions of the stock awards if the stock hit $825 and
$950 and the the full award if the average closing price is at or above
$1,125 for 20 consecutive days between October 2025 and October 2027.
The targets seemed ambitious when set, but the stock has skyrocketed
since, and reached an all-time closing high of $1,436.17 on May 28.</p>
<p>Like rival Nvidia Inc., Broadcom is riding the current artificial
intelligence frenzy among tech companies. Its chips are used by
businesses and public entities ranging from major banks, retailers,
telecom operators and government bodies.</p>
<p>In granting the stock award, Broadcom noted that under Tan its market
value has increased from $3.8 billion in 2009 to $645 billion (as of May
23) and that its total shareholder return during that time easily
surpassed that of the S&amp;P 500. It also said Tan will not receive
additional stock awards during the remainder of the five-year
period.</p>
<p>Other CEOs at the top of AP’s survey are William Lansing of Fair
Isaac Corp, ($66.3 million); Tim Cook of Apple Inc. ($63.2 million);
Hamid Moghadam of Prologis Inc. ($50.9 million); and Ted Sarandos,
co-CEO of Netflix ($49.8 million).</p>
<p>At Apple, Cook’s compensation represented a 36% decline from the year
prior. Cook requested a pay cut for 2023, in response to the vote at
Apple’s 2022 annual meeting, where just 64% of shareholders approved of
his pay package.</p>
<p>The survey’s methodology excluded CEOs such as Nikesh Arora at Palo
Alto Networks ($151.4 million) and Christopher Winfrey at Charter
Communications ($89 million).</p>
<p>Although securities filings show Elon Musk received no compensation
as CEO of Tesla Inc., his pay is currently front and center at the
electric car company. Musk is asking shareholders to restore a pay
package that was struck down by a judge in Delaware, who said the
approval process for the package was “deeply flawed.” The compensation,
mostly stock awards valued at $2.3 billion when granted in 2018, is now
estimated to be worth around $45 billion.</p>
<p>CEO pay vs workers</p>
<p>Workers across the country have been winning higher pay since the
pandemic, with wages and benefits for private-sector employees rising
4.1% in 2023 after a 5.1% increase in 2022, according to the Labor
Department.</p>
<p>Even with those gains, the gap between the person in the corner
office and everyone else keeps getting wider. Half the CEOs in this
year’s pay survey made at least 196 times what their median employee
earned. That’s up from 185 times in last year’s survey.</p>
<p>The gap is particularly wide at companies where employees typically
earn lower wages, such as retailers. At Ross Stores, for example, the
company says its employee at the very middle of the pay scale was a
part-time retail store associate who made $8,618. It would take 2,100
years earning that much to equal CEO Barbara Rentler’s compensation from
2023, valued at $18.1 million. A year earlier, it would have taken the
median worker 1,137 years to match the CEO’s pay.</p>
<p>Corporate boards often feel pressure to keep upping the pay for
well-performing CEOs out of fear that they’ll walk out the door and make
more at a rival. They focus on paying compensation that is competitive
within their industry or marketplace and not on the pay ratio, Malafis
said. The better an executive performs, the more the board is willing to
pay.</p>
<p>The disparity between what the chief executive makes and the workers
earn wasn’t always so wide.</p>
<p>After World War II and up until the 1980s, CEOs of large publicly
traded companies made about 40 to 50 times the average worker’s pay,
said Brandon Rees, deputy director of corporations and capital markets
for the AFL-CIO, which runs an Executive Paywatch website that tracks
CEO pay.</p>
<p>“The [current] pay ratio signals a sort of a winner take all culture,
that companies are treating their CEOs as, you know, as superstars as
opposed to, team players,” Rees said.</p>
<p>Say on pay</p>
<p>Despite the criticism, shareholders tend to give overwhelming support
to pay packages for company leaders. From 2019 to 2023, companies
typically received just under 90% of the vote for their executive
compensation plans, according to data from Equilar.</p>
<p>Shareholders do, however, occasionally reject a compensation plan,
although the votes are non-binding. In 2023, shareholders at 13
companies in the S&amp;P 500 gave the executive pay packages less than
50% support.</p>
<p>After its investors gave another resounding thumbs down to the pay
packages for its top executives, Netflix met with many of its biggest
shareholders last year to discuss their concerns. It also talked with
major proxy-advisory firms, which are influential because they recommend
how investors should vote at companies’ annual meetings.</p>
<p>Following the talks, Netflix announced several changes to redesign
its pay policies. For one, it eliminated executives’ option to allocate
their compensation between cash and options. It will no longer give out
stock options, which can give executives a payday as long as the stock
price stays above a certain level. Instead, the company will give
restricted stock that executives can profit from only after a certain
amount of time or after certain performance measures are met.</p>
<p>The changes will take effect in 2024. For last year, co-CEO Ted
Sarandos received options valued at $28.3 million and a cash bonus of
$16.5 million. Co-CEO Greg Peters received options valued at $22.7
million and a cash bonus of $13.9 million.</p>
<p>Anderson, of the Institute for Policy Studies, said Say on Pay votes
are important because they “shine a spotlight on some of the most
egregious cases of executive access, and it can lead to negotiations
over pay and other issues that shareholders might want to raise with
corporate leadership.”</p>
<p>“But I think the impact, certainly on the overall size of CEO
packages has not had much effect in some cases,” she said.</p>
<p>Female CEOs</p>
<p>More women made the AP survey than in previous years, but their
numbers in the corner office are still minuscule compared to their male
counterparts. Of the 342 CEOs included in Equilar’s data, 25 were
women.</p>
<p>Lisa Su, CEO and chair of the board of chip maker Advanced Micro
Devices, was the highest paid female CEO in the AP survey for the fifth
year in a row in fiscal 2023, bringing in compensation valued at $30.3
million — flat with her compensation package in 2022. Her overall rank
rose to 21 from 25.</p>
<p>The other top paid female CEOs include Mary Barra of automaker
General Motors ($27.8 million); Jane Fraser of banking giant Citigroup
($25.5 million); Kathy Warden of aerospace and defense company Northrop
Grumman Corp. ($23.5 million); and Carol Tome of package deliverer UPS
Inc. ($23.4 million).</p>
<p>The median pay package for female CEOs rose 21% to $17.6 million.
That’s better than the men fared: Their median pay package rose 12.2% to
$16.3 million.</p>

Hunter Biden’s gun case starts jury selection, president says he has
‘boundless love’ for him</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WILMINGTON, Del. — President Joe Biden’s son Hunter arrived at court
on Monday for jury selection in a federal gun case against him after the
collapse of a deal with prosecutors that would have avoided the
spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election. First lady Jill
Biden arrived shortly after, entering the courthouse in support of her
son.</p>
<p>Joe Biden said that as president he wouldn’t comment on the criminal
trial but as a dad he has “boundless love for my son, confidence in him,
and respect for his strength.”</p>
<p>“I am the President, but I am also a Dad,” he said in a statement.
“Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is
today.”</p>
<p>Hunter Biden, who spent the weekend with his parents, has been
charged in Delaware with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm
purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack
addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun
dealer, making a false claim on the application used to screen firearms
applicants when he said he was not a drug user, and illegally having the
gun for 11 days.</p>
<p>He has pleaded not guilty and has argued he’s being unfairly targeted
by the Justice Department, after Republicans decried the now-defunct
deal as special treatment for the Democratic president’s son.</p>
<p>The trial comes just days after Donald Trump, Republicans’
presumptive 2024 presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in
New York City. A jury found the former president guilty of a scheme to
cover up a hush money payment to a porn actor to fend off damage to his
2016 presidential campaign. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but
their proximity underscores how the criminal courtroom has taken center
stage during the 2024 campaign.</p>
<p>Hunter Biden is also facing a separate trial in California in
September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases
were to have been resolved through a deal with prosecutors last July,
the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business
dealings.</p>
<p>But Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump,
questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed
guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a
diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed
out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed. The lawyers
squabbled over the agreement, could not come to a resolution, and the
deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top
investigator as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter
Biden was indicted.</p>
<p>This trial isn’t about Hunter Biden’s foreign business affairs —
which Republicans have seized on without evidence to try to paint the
Biden family as corrupt. But it will excavate some of Hunter Biden’s
darkest moments and put them on display.</p>
<p>The president’s allies are worried about the toll the trial may take
on the elder Biden, who’s long been concerned about the well-being and
sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as those painful
past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. He’s also protective: Hunter
Biden was with his father all weekend before the case began, biking with
his dad and attending church together.</p>
<p>President Biden, in a last-minute switch in plans, shifted from his
Rehoboth Beach home back to his Wilmington compound on Sunday evening.
Boarding a helicopter on Sunday was the only time the president was seen
publicly without his son all weekend.</p>
<p>Hunter Biden arrived first at the Delaware courthouse on Monday. The
first lady, who turned 73 on Monday, followed about 15 minutes later and
walked briskly into court, flanked by U.S. Secret Service agents. Hunter
Biden’s sister Ashley Biden was also in court to support him.</p>
<p>Allies are also worried the trial could become a distraction as the
president tries to campaign under anemic poll numbers and as he is
preparing for an upcoming presidential debate while the proceedings play
out.</p>
<p>Prosecutors are hoping to show Hunter Biden was in the throes of
addiction when he bought the gun and therefore lied on the forms. They
have said they’re planning to use as evidence his published memoir, and
they may also introduce contents from a laptop that he left at a
Delaware repair shop and never retrieved. The contents made their way to
Republicans in 2020 and were publicly leaked, revealing embarrassing and
personal photos in which he’s often nude and doing drugs and messages in
which he asks dealers about scores.</p>
<p>The judge will ask a group of prospective jurors a series of
questions to determine whether they can serve impartially on the jury,
including whether they have donated to political campaigns or run for
political office. She will ask whether their views about the 2024
presidential campaign prevent them from being impartial.</p>
<p>She’s also going to ask whether prospective jurors believe Hunter
Biden is being prosecuted because his father is the president. Also,
she’ll ask about firearms purchasing and addiction issues, including:
“Do you believe someone who is addicted to drugs should not be charged
with a crime?”</p>
<p>The case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own
public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent into drugs and
alcohol followed the 2015 death of his brother, Beau Biden, from cancer.
He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018 and indicated on
the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.</p>
<p>Hunter Biden has pleaded not guilty in both cases, and his attorneys
have suggested they may argue he didn’t see himself as an addict when
prosecutors say he checked “no” to the question on the form. They’ll
also attack the credibility of the gun store owner.</p>
<p>Prosecutors, meanwhile, are also planning to call as witnesses Hunter
Biden’s ex-wife and his brother’s widow, Hallie, with whom he became
romantically involved.</p>
<p>If he were to be convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison,
though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum and
it’s unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.</p>

will historic election results mean for economies?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-03, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
<em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Mexico is set to elect its first
female president, and South Africa’s African National Congress party has

firefighters continue battling wind-driven wildfire east of San
Francisco</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SACRAMENTO, California — California firefighters made significant
progress Sunday to tame a wind-driven wildfire that scorched thousands
of acres 97 kilometers east of San Francisco, burned down a home and
forced residents to flee the area near the central California city of
Tracy.</p>
<p>The fire erupted Saturday afternoon in the grassy hills managed by
the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, one of the country’s key
centers for nuclear weapons science and technology. The cause was under
investigation.</p>
<p>The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said the
research center was not under immediate threat from the blaze, dubbed
the Corral Fire, which had devoured some 52 square kilometers by Sunday
afternoon. The fire was 50% contained as of Sunday evening.</p>
<p>Thousands of people in the area, including parts of the city of Tracy
with a population of 100,000, were ordered to leave for evacuation
centers Saturday. The evacuation order was lifted to allow residents to
return home starting Sunday evening. Tracy is about 112 kilometers south
of California’s capital in Sacramento.</p>
<p>CalFire Battalion Chief Josh Silveira said Sunday afternoon the fire
“burned right up to the homes” in the area and destroyed one house. With
calmer winds and milder weather Sunday, Silveira said he didn’t expect
the fire to grow.</p>
<p>Two firefighters suffered minor to moderate burns on Saturday and
were expected to make a full recovery, Silveira said.</p>
<p>The wildfire presented no threat to any laboratory facilities or
operations and had moved away from the site, Lawrence Livermore
spokesperson Paul Rhien said in a statement to The Associated Press
early Sunday.</p>
<p>“As a precaution, we have activated our emergency operations center
to monitor the situation through the weekend,” Rhien said.</p>
<p>Photos showed a wall of flames moving over the parched landscape as
dark smoke billowed into the sky.</p>
<p>The wildfire also forced the closure of two major highways, including
an interstate that connects the San Francisco Bay Area to San Joaquin
County in central California. But they had reopened by Sunday
afternoon.</p>
<p>The San Joaquin County Office of Emergency Services on Saturday
issued an evacuation order for areas west of the California Aqueduct,
south of Corral Hollow Creek, west to Alameda County and south to
Stanislaus County. A temporary evacuation point was established at Larch
Clover Community Center in Tracy. The county also asked residents to
temporarily use boiled tap water or bottled water for drinking and
cooking purposes.</p>
<p>Sunday’s high temperature for Tracy was expected to reach 29 degrees
Celsius, with no rain in the forecast. But hotter conditions are on
their way.</p>
<p>The National Weather Service said “dangerously hot conditions” with
highs of 39.4 C to 42.2 C were expected later in the week for the San
Joaquin Valley, an area that encompasses Tracy. Wind gusts of up to 72
kph lashed the region Saturday night, according to meteorologist Idamis
Shoemaker of the weather service in Sacramento.</p>

We spent this month moving northward through both southern and northern
British Columbia. We’ve been moving almost every day, stopping every
night to anchor, sleep and recuperate. Sailing near land is not as
relaxing as sailing offshore, this reef-strewn coast requires careful
navigation. We’ve had many long days of endless tacking from one side of
the channel to the other, almost all the way to Port McNeill, then after
that we started to get more weather from the south for some mostly
pleasant, but cold and rainy, downwind sailing. We’ve been using our
woodstove a lot, in evenings it helps warm the boat after a long sail.
</p>
<p>
On May 29th, 623 nautical miles miles after leaving Victoria, we arrived
in Prince Rupert, our last major port in British Columbia before we head
north to Southeast Alaska. Then, on June 2nd, we arrived in Ketchikan,
Southeast Alaska. Most of our updates this month detail some of the
places we’ve been(see the above list). To see our path, look at

id="sally-buzbee-steps-down-as-executive-editor-of-the-washington-post">Sally
Buzbee steps down as executive editor of The Washington Post</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — The Washington Post said Sunday that its executive editor,
Sally Buzbee, has stepped down after three years at the top of one of
journalism’s most storied brands.</p>
<p>She will be replaced by Matt Murray, former editor in chief of The
Wall Street Journal, through this fall’s presidential election.
Following that, Robert Winnett, deputy editor of the Telegraph Media
Group, will take over as editor as the newsroom restructures its
operations.</p>
<p>No reason was given for Buzbee’s departure. She wasn’t quoted in the
news release announcing that she was leaving and did not immediately
return a message seeking comment.</p>
<p>The Post also announced that it was launching a new division in its
newsroom dedicated to reaching audiences who want to pay for and consume
news in a different way.</p>
<p>Buzbee, former top editor at The Associated Press, was selected as
the Post’s top editor in May 2021. She replaced a renowned predecessor,
Martin Baron, after the Post exploded in popularity during the Trump
administration.</p>
<p>Buzbee was the first woman to serve as executive editor of The
Washington Post. And like Jill Abramson, the first woman to be top
editor at The New York Times, her tenure was short: Abramson had her job
from 2011 to 2014.</p>
<p>It has been a miserable few years financially for the news industry,
including for the Post. It has bled subscribers to the point where new
publisher, Will Lewis, told employees last month that the newspaper lost
$77 million last year.</p>
<p>“To speak candidly, we are in a hole, and have been for some time,”
Lewis said, according to the Post.</p>
<p>Lewis was named late last year to replace Fred Ryan as Post
publisher. He has worked at both The Wall Street Journal and The
Telegraph in England, the places he turned to to find the new
executives.</p>
<p>He’s talked about creating a multi-tier subscription plan for The
Post, similar to that in place at Politico. In an email to employees
late Sunday, Lewis said the new department will focus on more video
storytelling, embrace artificial intelligence and flexible payment
methods. It will begin this fall, he said.</p>
<p>In an earlier meeting, “we highlighted the need to move away from the
traditional one-size-fits-all approach in the news media industry and
focus on creating news for a broader range of readers and
customers.”</p>
<p>It augurs a change to the traditional structure of the Post. In his
memo, Lewis mentioned “three newsrooms.” Winnett will not take on the
title of executive editor, but he will be responsible for the “core
coverage areas” of politics, investigations, business, technology,
sports and features. He has run The Telegraph’s news operations since
2013, the Post said.</p>
<p>Murray will take over as leader of the newly created department
starting Nov. 6, the Post said. No one will have the title of executive
editor: Murray, Winnett and David Shipley, the editorial page editor who
will lead the “opinions newsroom,” will each report directly to Lewis,
the Post said.</p>
<p>“By creating three strong journalism functions — core, service/social
and opinions — we are taking a definitive step away from the ‘one size
fits all’ approach and moving towards meeting our audiences where they
are,” Lewis said.</p>
<p>The Post won three Pulitzer Prizes last month, including one in
national reporting for a vivid series on the impact of the AR-15
rifle.</p>

id="puerto-rico-rep.-jesús-manuel-ortiz-wins-gubernatorial-primary">Puerto
Rico Rep. Jesús Manuel Ortiz wins gubernatorial primary</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — Puerto Rico Rep. Jesús Manuel Ortiz defeated
Sen. Juan Zaragoza in a gubernatorial primary held Sunday by their
Popular Democratic Party, which seeks a return to power in the upcoming
general elections.</p>
<p>Zaragoza conceded defeat after obtaining 38% of the votes to his
rival’s 62%, even though only a little more than 60% of the votes had
been counted.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Gov. Pedro Pierluisi was still locked in a battle against
Puerto Rico congresswoman Jenniffer González in a primary held by the
pro-statehood New Progressive Party. The two ran on the same ticket four
years ago, but González announced her plan to challenge Pierluisi in
early December.</p>
<p>All candidates face disgruntled voters on an island still struggling
with chronic power outages and awaiting completion of reconstruction
projects following Hurricane Maria, which hit as a Category 4 storm in
September 2017.</p>
<p>Other ongoing complaints include the difficulty of obtaining business
permits, a fractured education system and the lack of access to capital
markets after the local government emerged two years ago from the
biggest U.S. municipal bankruptcy in history after announcing in 2015
that it was unable to pay its more than $70 billion public debt
load.</p>
<p>The debt was accumulated by governments that overspent, overestimated
revenue and borrowed millions despite a ballooning debt.</p>
<p>Running alongside Pierluisi for the position of congressional
representative was Puerto Rico Sen. William Villafañe, while senior U.S.
naval military officer Elmer Román, a former secretary of state for
Puerto Rico, sought the position under González.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Puerto Rico Sen. Juan Zaragoza, who was highly lauded for
his work as the island’s former treasury secretary, ran against
Rep. Jesús Manuel Ortiz to be the main candidate for the Popular
Democratic Party, which supports the island’s status quo as a U.S.
territory.</p>
<p>Attorney Pablo José Hernández was running unopposed to be the party’s
candidate for resident commissioner, the first person in 20 years to
seek that nomination.</p>
<p>Voting centers closed Sunday evening, with political pundits warning
that voter turnout appeared low and that electronic voting machines did
not properly work in some towns, although it was too early to determine
the magnitude of the problem.</p>
<p>All candidates faced disgruntled voters on an island still struggling
with chronic power outages and high electric bills as it awaits
completion of reconstruction projects following Hurricane Maria, which
hit as a Category 4 storm in September 2017.</p>
<p>Power outages were reported at more than a dozen voting centers,
including one where Ortiz arrived to cast his vote, forcing officials to
revert to a manual process. Heavy rains also pelted parts of the island,
with flood warnings issued for nearly a dozen towns and cities.</p>
<p>Power outages remain such a big concern that the State Commission of
Elections rented more than a dozen generators and a private power
company identified 81 alternate voting sites with guaranteed
electricity.</p>
<p>“It’s been years since I last voted,” said Benito López, a
66-year-old retiree wearing a T-shirt that read, “The Island of
Enchantment.” He planned to cast a vote for a candidate he would not
reveal “to see if there’s any improvement and change.”</p>
<p>Other voter complaints include the difficulty of obtaining business
permits, a fractured education system, and the island’s lack of access
to capital markets after the local government emerged two years ago from
the largest debt restructuring in U.S. history.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, more than $9 billion of debt owed by Puerto Rico’s power
company, the largest of any government agency, remains unresolved. A
federal judge overseeing a bankruptcy-like process has yet to rule on a
restructuring plan following bitter negotiations between the government
and bondholders.</p>
<p>“They have broken Puerto Rico,” said 79-year-old Cecilio Rodríguez of
the current and previous administrations as he waited to cast his vote.
“Economic development must be a priority.”</p>
<p>For other voters, stopping the exodus of doctors from Puerto Rico and
improving the U.S. territory’s crumbling health system is a
priority.</p>
<p>“The patients are the ones who have to stay here and endure this.
It’s not fair,” said Dr. Alfredo Rivera Freytes, an anesthesiologist who
left Puerto Rico for the U.S. Virgin Island of St. Thomas because of the
ongoing problems with the local health system.</p>
<p>He returned two years ago with plans to retire but found himself
working again because of the need for anesthesiologists in Puerto
Rico.</p>
<p>Ahead of the primaries, Pierluisi has touted record tourist numbers,
ongoing hurricane reconstruction and growing economic development among
his successes as he seeks re-election. He has pledged to prioritize
projects targeting children and the island’s growing elderly population,
among other things.</p>
<p>An event marking the end of his campaign held a week before the
primaries was headlined by former Gov. Ricardo Rosselló, who resigned in
August 2019 following nearly two weeks of massive protests touched off
by a leak of crude and insulting chat messages between him and his top
advisers.</p>
<p>His opponent, González, did not hold a campaign closer. She has
pledged to crack down on corruption, award more funds to agencies to
help victims of violence amid a surge in killings of women, and stem an
exodus of doctors and other medical workers to the U.S. mainland.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Zaragoza has promised to prioritize climate change and
renewable energy, decentralize the island’s education department and
improve access to health. His opponent, Ortiz, has pledged to improve
the licensing process to retain doctors, simplify the island’s tax
system and revamp health care.</p>
<p>Puerto Rico’s next governor will have to work alongside a federal
control board that oversees the island’s finances and was created after
the government declared bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Ahead of Sunday’s primaries, more than 4,900 inmates voted in prisons
across the U.S. territory. The State Commission of Elections also has
received and counted more than 122,000 early ballots.</p>

<h2 id="known-fizzled">Known fizzled</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-03, from: Ben Werdmuller’s blog</p>
<div class="e-content aside-content">
<p>
One of my biggest regrets is how the Known hosted service declined. The
paid subscriptions came to an end, and eventually the hosting whimpered
out. Behind the scenes, the database cluster was in need of more
maintenance than I was able to provide.
</p>
<p>
Known itself has required more maintenance than I’ve been able to
provide for quite some time. I wish I could spend more bandwidth on it,
but the state of my life right now is that it’s just not possible for me
to dedicate the coding time for something that isn’t paying my bills and
isn’t having the impact I wanted it to.
</p>
<p>
I wish we’d sent out a strong email at the end and allowed everyone to
export their data automatically. I also wish Known had import/export
that was reliable so that people could explore other platforms.
</p>
<p>
After attempting to claw the time to do it myself, I’d like to hire
someone to build the latter, and then apply it to everyone who had a
hosted account. The export function could be built into the Known UI or
as a CLI tool. If this seems like something you might be able to do, let
me know.
</p>
<p>
Overall, I have a ton of regrets about Known — something for a future
post (or series of posts), maybe. This site is still powered by it,
though, and I know other people still use it, too. So it’s not dead —
just small.

id="border-mayors-heading-to-dc-for-tuesdays-immigration-announcement">Border
mayors heading to DC for Tuesday’s immigration announcement</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>McALLEN, TEXAS — At least two Texas border mayors are headed to
Washington on Tuesday when President Joe Biden is expected to announce
an executive order that will mark his latest and most aggressive plan to
curtail the number of migrants allowed to seek asylum in the U.S.</p>
<p>Brownsville Mayor John Cowen and Edinburg Mayor Ramiro Garza both
confirmed they were invited by the White House for an immigration
announcement on Tuesday. Cowen told the Associated Press that he plans
to attend, while Garza said he would have more details on Monday about
his plans.</p>
<p>Notably, the Democratic mayor of Eagle Pass, the Texas-Mexico border
town where the number of migrants led to a state-federal clash over
border security, had not received an invitation as of Sunday. The mayor
from McAllen said he was invited but could not attend because of a prior
commitment.</p>
<p>A White House spokesman did not immediately return a request for
comment on other mayors who were invited to the announcement.</p>
<p>The AP reported last week that the White House was finalizing an
executive order that could shut off asylum requests and automatically
deny entrance to migrants once the number of people encountered by U.S.
border officials exceeded a new daily threshold.</p>
<p>The unilateral action is expected even as the number of border
crossings at the southern U.S. border has declined since December, due
in large part to Mexico’s escalated enforcement efforts. But Biden wants
to head off any potential spike in crossings that could occur later in
the year, as the fall election draws closer, when the weather cools and
numbers tend to rise.</p>
<p>Immigration remains a concern for voters ahead of the November
elections, with Republicans eager to punish Biden electorally over the
issue. Democrats have responded that Republicans, at the behest of
Donald Trump, killed a bipartisan border deal in Congress that would
have led to the toughest legislative restrictions on asylum in
years.</p>
