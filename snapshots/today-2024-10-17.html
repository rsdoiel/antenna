<p>Bloggers, here's an idea. When you write a piece you're proud of, end
it with a sentence like this: "And that's why I have a blog." It plants
a seed, which through repetition and appearing in many places, might
help people appreciate the purpose of a blog. We've had a lot of mud
slung at us, let's start undoing it.</p>

Anniversary Meetup</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-17, from: Innessential (Brint Simmons’ blog)</p>
<p>
This Thursday, Oct. 17, 2024, is the 20th anniversary of the Seattle
Xcoders! We’d love to see you there, at 7 pm at
<a href="https://www.bbycballard.com/">Bale Breaker and Yonder Cider
taproom</a> in Ballard.
</p>
<p>
Everyone is welcome! It’s not just for people who write code — it’s for
designers, testers, support folks, and everyone who helps make
Apple-ecosystem apps. Even if you just <em>like</em> those kinds of apps
and like talking about them, come join us!
</p>
<p>
We’re usually outside by these propane fire things, but I’m not sure
this time — we might have a room or some area or something. We should be
easy to find, at any rate.
</p>
<p>
It’s not actually a meeting with presentations — it’s just hanging out
and talking. Which we do every first, third, and fifth Thursday (you can
<a href="webcal://p25-caldav.icloud.com/published/2/Nzc2ODExNzg3NzY4MTE3OA8zb_qUej-fZsXG-_oJak3bJvjP8RcHmIEZ0WxGu2kWkvciKC5Sm6Xm5sHZRUHdZPM3KQg8-b2iwsMIEOTWlJo">subscribe
to our calendar</a>). One of these days we’ll get back to presentations
— but the social part is valuable, and so we keep it up.
</p>
<p>
PS Looks like the food truck is Impeckable Chicken, which I’ve heard
good things about. :)
</p>
<p>
PPS I’m usually easy to spot: quite well into middle age, with nothing
like the amount of hair I once had. Black jeans, usually a black
sweatshirt. Glasses. Doc Martens. Not tall.

<p>
Amazon’s 12th-gen Kindle Paperwhite is an eBook reader with a 7 inch
touchscreen display featuring a front light with support for brightness
and color temperature adjustments. As expected, it’s basically a modest
updated to the model that Amazon’s been selling since 2011. The key
differences are a slightly larger display, slightly longer battery life,
and […]

Android-free ‘HarmonyOS NEXT’ will go live next week</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-16, from: OS News</p>
<p>Earlier this year we talked about Huawei’s HarmonyOS NEXT, which is
most likely the only serious competitor to Android and iOS in the world.
HarmonyOS started out as a mere Android skin, but over time Huawei
invested heavily into the platform to expand it into a full-blown,
custom operating system with a custom programming language, and it seems
the company is finally ready to take the plunge and release HarmonyOS
NEXT into the wild. It’s indicated that HarmonyOS made up 17% of China’s
smartphone market in Q1 of 2024. That’s a significant amount of
potential devices breaking off from Android in a market dominated by
either it or iOS. HarmonyOS NEXT is set to begin rolling out to Huawei
devices next week. The OS will first come to the Mate 60, Mate X5, and
MatePad Pro on October 15. ↫ Andrew Romero at 9To5Google Huawei has been
hard at work making sure there’s no ‘application gap’ for people using
HarmonyOS NEXT, claiming it has 10000 applications ready to go that
cover “99.9%” of their users’ use case. That’s quite impressive, but of
course, we’ll have to wait and see if the numbers line up with the
reality on the ground for Chinese consumers. Here in the est HarmonyOS
NEXT is unlikely to gain any serious traction, but that doesn’t mean I
would mind taking a look at the platform if at all possible. It’s
honestly not surprising the most serious attempt at creating a third
mobile ecosystem is coming from China, because here in the west the
market is so grossly rusted shut we’re going to be stuck with Android
and iOS until the day I die.</p>

is preparing to let you run Linux apps on Android, just like Chrome
OS</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-16, from: OS News</p>
<p>Engineers at Google started work on a new Terminal app for Android a
couple of weeks ago. This Terminal app is part of the Android
Virtualization Framework (AVF) and contains a WebView that connects to a
Linux virtual machine via a local IP address, allowing you to run Linux
commands from the Android host. Initially, you had to manually enable
this Terminal app using a shell command and then configure the Linux VM
yourself. However, in recent days, Google began work on integrating the
Terminal app into Android as well as turning it into an all-in-one app
for running a Linux distro in a VM. ↫ Mishaal Rahman at Android
Authority There already are a variety of ways to do this today, but
having it as a supported feature implemented by Google is very welcome.
This is also going to greatly increase the number of spammy articles and
lazy YouTube videos telling you how to “run Ubuntu on your phone”, which
I’m not particularly looking forward to.</p>

<p>date: 2024-10-16, from: Glasgow Haskell Compiler</p>
<h1>
GHC 9.12.1-alpha1 is now available
</h1>
<h4 class="text-muted">
Zubin Duggal - 2024-10-16
</h4>
<p>
The GHC developers are very pleased to announce the availability of the
first alpha release of GHC 9.12.1. Binary distributions, source
distributions, and documentation are available at
<a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/9.12.1-alpha1">downloads.haskell.org</a>.
</p>
<p>
We hope to have this release available via ghcup shortly.
</p>
<p>
GHC 9.12 will bring a number of new features and improvements,
including:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
The new language extension
<a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0522-or-patterns.rst">OrPatterns</a>
allowing you to combine multiple pattern clauses into one.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The
<a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0569-multiline-strings.rst">MultilineStrings</a>
language extension to allow you to more easily write strings spanning
multiple lines in your source code.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Improvements to the OverloadedRecordDot extension, allowing the built-in
<code>HasField</code> class to be used for records with fields of non
lifted representations.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The
<a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0409-exportable-named-default.rst">NamedDefaults</a>
language extension has been introduced allowing you to define defaults
for typeclasses other than <code>Num</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
More deterministic object code output, controlled by the
<code>-fobject-determinism</code> flag, which improves determinism of
builds a lot (though does not fully do so) at the cost of some compiler
performance (1-2%). See
<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/12935">#12935</a> for
the details
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
GHC now accepts type syntax in expressions as part of
<a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0281-visible-forall.rst">GHC
Proposal <span>#281</span></a>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
… and many more
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
A full accounting of changes can be found in the
<a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/9.12.1-alpha1/docs/users_guide/9.12.1-notes.html">release
notes</a>. As always, GHC’s release status, including planned future
releases, can be found on the GHC Wiki
<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/GHC-status">status</a>.
</p>
<p>
We would like to thank GitHub, IOG, the Zw3rk stake pool, Well-Typed,
Tweag I/O, Serokell, Equinix, SimSpace, the Haskell Foundation, and
other anonymous contributors whose on-going financial and in-kind
support has facilitated GHC maintenance and release management over the
years. Finally, this release would not have been possible without the
hundreds of open-source contributors whose work comprise this release.
</p>
<p>
As always, do give this release a try and open a
<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/new">ticket</a> if
you see anything amiss.
