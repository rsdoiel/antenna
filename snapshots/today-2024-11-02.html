There are a few ways to keep costs down when building a mini PC. One is
to opt for an inexpensive, low-power processor like an Intel Alder
Lake-N chip. Another is to just use older processors that are no longer
state-of-the-art. Chuwi’s new UBox mini PC takes the latter approach.

<p>I’m a fan of Kong the CLI argument parser, I use it to automatically
create manual pages, (bash) completion and do a lot of validation inside
it. (This guy also has other really interesting packages, and he’s a
huge fan of Go’s struct tags). I wanted to do validation inside Kong as
well, for this Kong has validation, which is just a method (Validate()
error) on a type. Now most types I have are just string or any other
builtin type.</p>
