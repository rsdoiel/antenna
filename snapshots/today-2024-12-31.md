## The Enlightened Economist Prize for 2024

date: 2024-12-31, from: Enlightenment Economics

This decision &#8211; again, entirely arbitrary and my own &#8211; was harder than ever this year because I left the long/shortlisting so late I had little time to mull it over.

As the year wraps up I spent some time thinking about how it went, and what I’m hoping for in 2025.

I wanted to prioritize being a better friend, [&#8230;]

The ware for December 2024 is shown below.

## Quoting Alexis Gallagher

<blockquote cite="https://www.answer.ai/posts/2024-12-19-modernbert.html#encoder-only-models"><p>Basically, a frontier model like OpenAI’s O1 is like a Ferrari SF-23. It’s an obvious triumph of engineering, designed to win races, and that’s why we talk about it. But it takes a special pit crew just to change the tires and you can’t buy one for yourself. In contrast, a BERT model is like a Honda Civic. It’s also an engineering triumph, but more subtly, since it is engineered to be affordable, fuel-efficient, reliable, and extremely useful. And that’s why they’re absolutely everywhere.</p></blockquote>

## Watching Google Search in 2025

date: 2024-12-30, from: Chris Coyier blog

It will be fascinating to watch what happens with Google Search this coming year. It&#8217;s the behemoth. It alone is the life blood of countless small businesses. And yet &#8220;Google Zero&#8221; threatens — radical changes to Google search results where good, previously-reliable traffic absolutely plummets to essentially nothing. Review site HouseFresh&#8217;s story is an example. [&#8230;]

## Severance on FanFare

date: 2024-12-30, updated: 2024-12-30, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://fanfare.metafilter.com/show/severance">Severance on FanFare</a></strong></p>
I'm coordinating a rewatch of season one of Severance on MetaFilter Fanfare in preparation for season two (due to start on January 17th). I'm posting an episode every three days - we are up to episode 5 so far (excellently titled "The Grim Barbarics of Optics and Design").</p>
<p>Severance is a show that rewatches <em>really well</em>. There are so many delightful details that stand out once you know more about where the series is going.

## Intel’s “Twin Lake” processors are *slightly* faster Alder Lake-N chips

## Quoting John Gruber

date: 2024-12-30, updated: 2024-12-30, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<blockquote cite="https://daringfireball.net/2024/12/openai_unimaginable"><p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/07/26/zuck-open-source-ai">There is no technical moat</a> in this field, and so OpenAI is the epicenter of an investment bubble.</p>
<p>Thus, effectively, OpenAI is to this decade’s generative-AI revolution what Netscape was to the 1990s’ internet revolution. The revolution is real, but it’s ultimately going to be a commodity technology layer, not the foundation of a defensible proprietary moat. In 1995 investors mistakenly thought investing in Netscape was a good way to bet on the future of the open internet and the World Wide Web in particular. Investing in OpenAI today is a bit like that — generative AI technology has a bright future and is transforming the world, but it’s wishful thinking that the breakthrough client implementation is going to form the basis of a lasting industry titan.</p></blockquote>
