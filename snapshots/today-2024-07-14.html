quietly updates official lightweight Windows 11 Validation OS ISOs for
24H2</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-14, from: OS News</p>
<p>Microsoft has again quietly updated its Validation OS ISOs. In case
you are not familiar with it, Validation OS is an official lightweight
variant of Windows and it is designed for hardware vendors to test,
validate and repair hardware defects. ↫ Sayan Sen at Neowin I had no
idea this variant of Windows existed, but it kind of makes sense when
you think about it. OEMs or other companies making devices that run or
work with Windows may need to test, reboot, test, reboot, and so on,
endlessly, and having a lightweight and fast version of Windows that
doesn’t load any junk you don’t need – or just loads straight into your
company’s hardware testing application – is incredibly valuable.
According to Microsoft, the Windows Validation OS boots to a command
line that allows you to run Win32 applications. This has made me wonder
if I can use it for the one thing I am forced to use Windows for:
playing League of Legends (I cobbled together a spare parts machine
solely for this purpose). My guess is that either the Validation OS will
lack certain components or frameworks League of Legends requires, or is
so different from regular Windows that it will trip Riot Games’ rootkit,
or both. Still, I’m curious. I might load this up on a spare hard drive
and what’s possible.</p>

<h2 id="github-is-starting-to-feel-like-legacy-software">GitHub is
starting to feel like legacy software</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-14, from: OS News</p>
<p>The corporate branding, the new “AI-powered developer platform”
slogan, makes it clear that what I think of as “GitHub”—the traditional
website, what are to me the core features—simply isn’t Microsoft’s
priority at this point in time. I know many talented people at GitHub
who care, but the company’s priorities just don’t seem to value what I
value about the service. This isn’t an anti-AI statement so much as a
recognition that the tool I still need to use every day is past its
prime. Copilot isn’t navigating the website for me, replacing my need to
the website as it exists today. I’ve had tools hit this phase of decline
and turn it around, but I’m not optimistic. It’s still plenty usable
now, and probably will be for some years to come, but I’ll want to know
what other options I have now rather than when things get worse than
this. ↫ Misty De Meo Apparently, GitHub is in the middle of a long,
drawn-out process where it’s rewriting its frontend using React. De Meo
was trying to use a particular feature of GitHub – the blame view, which
also works through the command line but is apparently much harder to
parse there – and realised the browser search feature just couldn’t find
the line of code they absolutely knew for sure was there. After
scrolling for a while, the browser search feature suddenly found the
line of code. I’d heard rumblings that GitHub’s in the middle of
shipping a frontend rewrite in React, and I realized this must be it.
The problem wasn’t that the line I wanted wasn’t on the page—it’s that
the whole document wasn’t being rendered at once, so my browser’s
builtin search bar just couldn’t find it. On a hunch, I tried disabling
JavaScript entirely in the browser, and suddenly it started working
again. GitHub is able to send a fully server-side rendered version of
the page, which actually works like it should, but doesn’t do so unless
JavaScript is completely unavailable. ↫ Misty De Meo Seem like a classic
case of people being told to develop something in too little time, with
the wrong tools, while management is breathing down their necks and
pulling engineers away to work on buzzwords like “AI”.</p>

<h2 id="new-information-emerges-on-trump-shooting-suspect">New
information emerges on Trump shooting suspect</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — As federal investigators try to piece together a motive
for 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, the man identified as the
would-be assassin of former President Donald Trump, at least one former
classmate is speaking out. </p>
<p>Jason Kohler told reporters he attended high school with Crooks in
Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, describing him as a loner and an
outcast. </p>
<p>“He was, like a kid that was always alone. He was always bullied,”
Kohler told reporters Sunday. “He was bullied so much.” </p>
<p>Crooks graduated from Bethel Park High School in 2022, according to a
statement from the school district to a local media outlet. Local media
reports show he was given a $500 award for math and science.</p>
<p>Kohler said he never had much interaction with Crooks, who would sit
alone during lunch and often be targeted by other kids for the way he
often wore hunting outfits or how he continued to wear a mask after
COVID mask mandates ended. </p>
<p>“You could look at him and you would be like, ‘Something’s a little
off,’” Kohler added.  The description is just part of the picture that
is starting to emerge of Crooks, who was shot and killed by U.S. Secret
Service agents after climbing to the roof of a building and firing five
to six shots at Trump during a campaign rally Saturday in nearby Butler,
Pennsylvania. </p>
<p>Law enforcement officials said Sunday they found bomb-making
materials in Crooks’s car and home, and that the AR-style rifle he used
in the shooting had been purchased by his father. </p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal first reported on the discovery of the
explosives. </p>
<p>Crooks’s father, Matthew Crooks, told CNN late Sunday he was trying
to find out “what the hell is going on” but would “wait until I talk to
law enforcement” before saying anything more. </p>
<p>Public records show Crooks had no prior convictions and was a
registered Republican, like Trump. But other records indicate he made a
$15 political donation in 2021 to a left-leaning group that supports
Democratic candidates, on the day President Joe Biden was sworn into
office.  </p>
<p>Discord, a social media platform popular with gamers, said Sunday it
had discovered an account “that appears to be linked to” Crooks. </p>
<p>“It was rarely utilized, has not been used in months,” a Discord
spokesperson confirmed in a statement to VOA. “We have found no evidence
that it was used to plan this incident, promote violence, or discuss his
political views.” </p>
<p>“Discord strongly condemns violence of any kind, including political
violence, and we will continue to coordinate closely with law
enforcement,” the spokesperson added.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Pentagon Sunday said it determined Crooks had no
connection to the U.S. military.</p>
<p>“We’ve confirmed with each of the military service branches that
there is no military service affiliation for the suspect with that name
or date of birth in any branch, active or reserve component in their
respective databases,” according to a statement from the Pentagon press
secretary, Major General Pat Ryder.</p>

<p>The FBI has named a suspect in what it called an attempted

<h2 id="us-searches-for-motive-in-trump-assassination-attempt">US
searches for motive in Trump assassination attempt</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Multiple U.S. law enforcement agencies ramped up their
search for answers Sunday, less than a day after a would-be assassin got
close enough to shoot and injure former President Donald Trump at a
campaign rally in rural Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The FBI early Sunday named the alleged shooter as 20-year-old Thomas
Matthew Crooks, a resident of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, located about
80 kilometers north of the rally site in Butler.</p>
<p>Crooks was shot and killed by U.S. Secret Service agents shortly
after firing multiple rounds at Trump.</p>
<p>But already new evidence suggests the incident could have been
worse.</p>
<p>Law enforcement officials said Sunday that bomb-making materials were
discovered during searches of Crooks’ car and home.</p>
<p>The discovery was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p>Officials also said the gun Crooks used in the attempted
assassination, an AR-style rifle, had been bought by his father,
although they had yet to determine how Crooks obtained the weapon.</p>
<p>The reason Crooks sought to kill Trump also remained a mystery.</p>
<p>“We do not currently have an identified motive, although our
investigators are working tirelessly to attempt to identify what that
motive was,” said FBI Special Agent-in-Charge Kevin Rojek, calling it
“the single greatest priority.”</p>
<p>Rojek, speaking at a news conference late Saturday, also said the FBI
was working to determine whether the shooter had been acting alone.</p>
<p>Public records show Crooks was a registered Republican, but he also
made a $15 political donation to a liberal group in 2021, on the day
President Joe Biden was sworn into office.</p>
<p>The White House said Biden, along with Vice President Kamala Harris,
were given an updated briefing into the investigation, Sunday.</p>
<p>The briefers included FBI Director Christopher Wray, U.S. Attorney
General Merrick Garland, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas,
U.S. Secret Service Director Kim Cheatle and national security adviser
Jake Sullivan.</p>
<p>Key lawmakers Sunday labeled the attempted assassination as a
security failure and said they are seeking answers.</p>
<p>“How is it that someone could get on a roof with a superior position,
with a weapon, and attempt to assassinate former President Donald Trump?
It’s just unthinkable, unfathomable” said Representative Mike Turner,
the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee,</p>
<p>“We need to know, is this a protocol failure? Is this a resources
issue? Or is this just a failure of those who were on site that day?”
Turner told CNN, adding his committee had yet to be briefed on the
developments.</p>
<p>Turner also raised concerns about the threat landscape going
forward.</p>
<p>“I am with Director Wray of the FBI, where he said we’re at the
highest level, threat level, that we have had since 9/11,” said Turner.
“I believe that the threat is continuing. It’s not just this one
individual’s assassin’s attempt.”</p>
<p>Other lawmakers expected to receive updates as the day went on,</p>
<p>The House Homeland Security Committee chairman, Republican
Representative Mark Green, was scheduled to speak to the director of the
Secret Service later Sunday, a committee spokesperson told VOA.</p>
<p>Green “continues to seek answers to the many questions the American
people deserve to know,” the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>Green also sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security,
asking for documents related to the security plan and screening
procedures for the rally and what sort of additional protective measures
had been asked for, or given to, the Trump campaign.</p>
<p>According to witness accounts and videos posted online, the shooter
was seen holding a rifle and crawling up the roof of a nearby building
moments before the shots rang out. Several bystanders could be heard
yelling in an attempt to get the attention of nearby police.</p>
<p>In addition to the injury to Trump, who left the scene of the
assassination attempt with a bloody ear, officials said one spectator
was killed, and two others were critically injured.</p>
<p>The FBI’s Rojek said it was “surprising” that the gunman had been
able to fire four or five shots before he himself was killed.</p>
<p>Information from the Associated Press and Reuters was used in this
report. Patsy Widakuswara also contributed.</p>

<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;It’s the number of people who have taken a few minutes out of their busy lives to write something on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://manuelmoreale.com/guestbook&quot;&gt;guestbook&lt;/a&gt;. One hundred doesn’t seem a lot in the grand scheme of things, especially on the web. If you have one hundred followers you might as well have zero. One hundred views on a YouTube video? That’s nothing. You need at least one hundred thousand to be part of the conversation. And yet, I find one hundred signatures in a guestbook to be a lot. Can you imagine having one hundred people in front of you, all saying something to you, one after the other? It would feel overwhelming. The internet has messed up many things, including the sense of scale. But this more humane scale is why I love the personal web. You can still recognise the names of the people who interact with you, you can still remember details about them. I’m grateful for every single one of those one hundred signatures. If yours is one of them, thank you.&lt;/p&gt;                &lt;hr&gt;

id="race-is-on-to-keep-150-year-old-lighthouse-from-crumbling-into-hudson-river">Race
is on to keep 150-year-old lighthouse from crumbling into Hudson
River</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>HUDSON, N.Y. — Wooden pilings beneath Hudson-Athens Lighthouse are
deteriorating, and the structure, built in the middle of the river when
steamboats still plied the water, is beginning to shift. Cracks are
apparent on the brick building and its granite foundation.</p>
<p>While there are other endangered lighthouses around the nation, the
peril to this one 100 miles 161 (kilometers) north of New York City is
so dire the National Trust for Historic Preservation placed
Hudson-Athens on its 2024 list of the country’s 11 most endangered
historic places. Advocates say that if action isn’t taken soon, yet
another historic lighthouse could be lost in the coming years.</p>
<p>“All four corners will begin to come down, and then you’ll have a
pile of rock in the middle. And ultimately it will topple into the
river,” Van Calhoun of the Hudson-Athens Lighthouse Preservation Society
said during a recent visit.</p>
<p>The society is trying to quickly raise money to place a submerged
steel curtain around the lighthouse, an ambitious preservation project
that could cost as much as $10 million. Their goal is to save a
prominent symbol of the river’s centuries-long history as a busy
waterway. While the Hudson River was once home to more than a dozen
lighthouses, only seven still stand.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, there’s a similar story of lost history.</p>
<p>Across the United States, there were around 1,500 lighthouses at the
beginning of the 20th century. Only about 800 of them remain, said U.S.
Lighthouse Society executive director Jeff Gales. He said many of the
structures deteriorated after they were automated, a process that became
more common by the 1940s.</p>
<p>“Lighthouses were built to have human beings taking care of them,”
Gales said. “And when you seal them up and take the human factor out,
that’s when they really start falling into disrepair.”</p>
<p>The Hudson-Athens Lighthouse began operating in 1874 offshore from
the city of Hudson and was eventually co-named for the village of Athens
on the other side of the river. It was built to help keep boats from
running aground on nearby mud flats, which were submerged at high
tide.</p>
<p>“There were shipwrecks because they couldn’t see the sandbar. And so
that’s why this lighthouse was put in the middle of the river, unlike
most that are on the shoreline,” said preservation society president
Kristin Gamble.</p>
<p>The lighthouse is still in use, though now with an automated LED
beacon. The preservation society owns the building and maintains it as a
museum.</p>
<p>The last full-time keeper, Emil Brunner, retired in 1949 when the
lighthouse became automated. He lived there with his family for much of
his tenure. One of his daughters recalled rowing to school and, in the
winter, walking across the ice on a safe path marked by her father’s
tobacco juice stains on the frozen surface. Brunner also is portrayed on
a 1946 Saturday Evening Post cover painting rowing with a child,
Christmas presents and a tree in tow, as his wife and other children
await their arrival on the lighthouse landing.</p>
<p>Visitors who are ferried to the lighthouse today can explore the
keeper’s quarters, which are modest but feature river views from every
window. And they can climb up the tight spiral staircase to the tower to
take in a unique panorama view of the river and the Catskill Mountains
to the west.</p>
<p>Roof work on the lighthouse is underway this summer, but repairs to
the building will ultimately mean little unless workers address damage
to some of the 200 wood pilings packed in mud that hold the lighthouse
above water. The support structure has weathered 150 years of currents
and ice. But large commercial ships of the modern era — with their big
propellors — introduce new problems.</p>
<p>“They create a turbulence that’s like being inside a washing machine.
And that turbulence actually comes underneath and pulls — churns up —
the soil underneath us and sucks it away,” Calhoun said. “In fact, there
are boulders as big as your car that are 100 feet out in that river that
used to be right next to us.”</p>
<p>The underwater agitation washes away mud around the pilings, leaving
them exposed to water. And that accelerates decay of the wood. Engineers
estimate the structure could begin to tilt in three to five years, which
Gamble said would be “the beginning of the end.”</p>
<p>The proposed ring of corrugated steel would shield the structure from
that turbulence. The 100-foot (31-meter) diameter circle, which would
project above the water line, would be filled in and covered by a deck,
enlarging the area around the lighthouse.</p>
<p>The preservation group is optimistic about getting federal money to
help pay for the project. Both of New York’s U.S. senators, Democrats
Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, support the effort, as does local
Republican U.S. Rep. Marc Molinaro.</p>
<p>Though the project is pricey, Gamble said, it would not only save the
lighthouse from being lost to time, but it would also protect the
19th-century beacon for generations to come.</p>
<p>“We need, basically, the 100-year fix,” she said.</p>

<p>The U.S. Republican Party is expected to formally nominate Donald
Trump for president this week, days after he survived an assassination
attempt at a political rally. Already tight security is expected to be
heightened in Milwaukee, which is hosting the Republican National
Convention. VOA’s Jorge Agobian and William Gallo spoke with convention
delegates and Milwaukee residents, who are concerned about the
possibility of more unrest.</p>

nicknamed Apex will be auctioned in New York</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — The nearly complete fossilized remains of a
161-million-year-old stegosaurus discovered in Colorado in 2022 will be
auctioned by Sotheby’s in New York next week, auction house officials
said.</p>
<p>The dinosaur that Sotheby’s calls Apex stands 3.3 meters tall and
measures 8.2 meters nose to tail, according to Cassandra Hatton,
Sotheby’s global head of science and popular culture.</p>
<p>The stegosaurus, with its distinctive pointy dorsal plates, is one of
the world’s most recognizable dinosaurs.</p>
<p>Apex, which Hatton called “a coloring book dinosaur,” was discovered
in May 2022 on private land near the town of Dinosaur, Colorado. The
excavation was completed in October 2023, Sotheby’s said.</p>
<p>Though experts believe stegosauruses used their fearsome tail spikes
to fight, this specimen shows no signs of combat, Sotheby’s said. The
fossil does show evidence of arthritis, suggesting that Apex lived to an
advanced age.</p>
<p>Hatton said Apex was found “with the tail curled up underneath the
body, which is a common death pose for animals.”</p>
<p>The dinosaur will be auctioned on July 17 as part of Sotheby’s “Geek
Week” series.</p>
<p>Sotheby’s is estimating that it will sell for $4 million to $6
million, but that’s just an educated guess.</p>
<p>“This is an incredibly rare animal,” Hatton said. “A stegosaurus of
this caliber has never sold at auction before, so we will find out what
it is actually worth.”</p>

As you’ll recall <a href="/2024/05/refurb-weekend-canon-cat.html">from
our historical discussion of the Canon Cat</a>, the Cat was designed by
Jef Raskin as a sophisticated user-centric computer but demoted to
office machine within Canon’s typewriter division, which was tasked with
selling it. Because Canon only ever billed the Cat as a “work processor”
for documents and communications, and then abruptly tanked it after just
six months, it never had any software packages that were commercially
produced. In fact, I can’t find <em>any</em> software written for it
other than the original Tutor and Demo diskettes included with the
system and a couple of
<a href="https://randoc.wordpress.com/2020/02/23/a-few-remarks-on-the-canon-cat/">Canon-specific
utilities</a>, which I don’t have and don’t seem to be imaged anywhere.
<p>
So this entry will cover a lot of ground: first, we have to be able to
reliably read, image and write Canon disks on another system, then
decipher the format, and <em>then</em> patch those images to display
pictures and automatically run arbitrary code. At the end we’ll have
three examples we can image on any PC 3.5” floppy drive and insert into
a Cat, turn it on or hit DISK, and have the Cat automatically run: a Jef
Raskin “picture disk,” a simple but useful dummy terminal, and the
world’s first (I believe) Canon Cat, two-disk, slightly animated and
finely dithered, slideshow graphics demo!
<p>
But before we get to pumping out floppy disks, we first need to talk
about how one uses a Cat. And that means we need to talk a bit about
Forth, the Canon Cat’s native tongue. And that means we should probably
talk more about the operating system too. Oh, and we should go down to
CompUSA and buy a brand new floppy drive while we’re at it.
<p>
<p><a name='more'></a></p>
For those of you without a Cat, which sadly will be most of you, at
least a little of this entry can be done in MAME, which is at present
the sole extant Cat emulator. (A Wasm version with ROMs ready to go is
<a href="https://archive.org/details/canoncat">at the Internet
Archive</a>, though here I’ll be running it on my Raptor Talos II in
Fedora.) Unfortunately MAME emulates neither the internal disk drive nor
the serial port, so you won’t be able to run these demos on it yet, and
there’s a couple glitches we need to work around, but this will still
give you a flavour of the machine and let you poke around a bit.
<p>
Everything in this entry assumes the production v1.74 ROMs, which were
to the best of my knowledge the only version mass-produced Cats were
ever officially shipped with. Source code and binaries for v2.40 ROMs
exist but my Cat doesn’t run them. If you want to run the v2.40 ROMs
anyway, don’t be surprised if some of this doesn’t work right, and I’m
very sure the demos won’t.
<p>
<p>The major glitches to rectify are the emulator freezing when the
beeper is triggered (probably incomplete emulation of one of the custom
Canon gate array chips) and switching the keyboard layout so we can type
angle brackets (unpossible with the default US layout, also true of a
real Cat). Let’s fix those issues first.</p>

document, which we’ll get to in a second. These MAME grabs (captured at
the system’s raw 672x344 screen resolution) have been corrected for
aspect ratio so that they’ll look approximately the same as they would
on the Cat’s CRT display.</p>

<p>The Cat’s interface is entirely keyboard-driven with no mouse,
joystick or even cursor keys. To perform special functions, the USE
FRONT key acts like a Command or Control key when combined with others.
Here, we’ll enter the setup menu by holding down USE FRONT (in the
default MAME key layout, this is probably Control) and pressing SETUP,
which is usually the left brace key. <em>Keep USE FRONT/Control
depressed after you release the SETUP key.</em></p>

The two settings we’ll want to change are the keyboard and problem
signal. The keyboard is most likely set to United States (or as
appropriate to your own locale), but we’ll need it set to true ASCII for
hacking purposes. With USE FRONT/Control still down, repeatedly tap
either of the LEAP keys (usually mapped to Alt/Option) to cycle through
the choices until “ASCII” is shown. If you started at United States, tap
the left LEAP/Alt/Option key for Dvorak and again for ASCII, and that
should do it, but <em>do not let go of USE FRONT/Control yet.</em>
<p>
Then, to change the problem signal, <em>with USE FRONT/Control still
down</em>, tap SPACE twice to move to that, and tap LEAP until “Flash”
is shown (and only flash, none of the beep options). Your screen should
look like the grab above. Assuming it does, <em>now</em> you can let go
of USE FRONT. After a brief pause the settings will be written to the
battery-backed settings RAM and the Cat will go back to the main
document.
<p>
So that you understand what we’ll be trying to accomplish (and,
eventually, subvert), let’s have a quick look at what makes the Cat’s
interface unique.

The Cat’s operating system is entirely in ROM, so there’s no waiting to
start — though if you have a disk in the drive, and the machine
generally expects you will so that your workspace can be autosaved, it
will load when you power it on. Either way, you can start entering text
almost immediately. What looks like two cursors will track your typing,
but what they really are is the selection (inverse video) and the
insertion point (grey block). The selection is what is deleted
immediately by pressing ERASE (backspace).
<p>
<p>At the bottom of the screen is the <i>ruler</i>. This shows your
document margins and your tab stops, though in characters, not inches —
the Cat uses fixed-width, non-proportional characters. Paragraph style,
line spacing and the keyset in use (I or II, for those keys with
multiple character pairs assigned to them) are at the bottom, along with
a memory usage gauge and the current line number within the current
document.</p>

<p>The Cat doesn’t have a filesystem, nor even a concept of one.
Instead, all documents are subsumed into one big overarching workspace,
each workspace being identified by a unique key stored to its matching
disk (so that you can’t overwrite a disk with the wrong workspace, and
you won’t lose unsaved text with a new disk — that is, unless you force
it to do those things). Disk and memory permitting, you can create as
many documents as you like with the DOCUMENT/PAGE (typically Page Down)
key. They can be individually titled so you can scan the list to see
what’s present, and carry their own independent margin and document
settings. The Cat was never shipped with a memory capacity greater than
what its floppy drive could store, so one disk always equals one
workspace.</p>

How do you navigate without cursor keys or a mouse? The LEAP keys, when
held down, search either backwards (left) or forwards (right) in the
workspace based on what you type. You can LEAP by characters, or
paragraphs (LEAP to RETURN or RETURN-RETURN), or even documents
(LEAP-DOCUMENT). SHIFT-LEAP can be used to scroll the screen line by
line.
<p>
<p>LEAPing also is how you mark text. If you LEAP first to the beginning
of a block of text and then LEAP to the end of it, then press both LEAP
keys, that text is selected. Besides applying styles like boldface or
all-caps to it, you can move it by LEAPing elsewhere, or copy it and
move the copy, or delete it. A single level of undo is available with
the UNDO key.</p>

Selecting text has other functions too. When I say everything goes in
the workspace, I do mean <em>everything</em>. The Cat is designed to be
collabourative: you can hook up your Cat to a phone line, or at least
you could when landlines were more ubiquitous, and someone could call in
and literally type into your document remotely. If you dialed up a
service, you would type into the document and mark and send text to the
remote system, and the remote system’s response would also become part
of your document. (That goes for the RS-232 port as well, by the way. In
fact, we’ll deliberately exploit this capability for the projects in
this article.)
<p>
<p>Raskin’s intention was that the document should handle dynamic text
as fluidly as static text (if Canon had let him and the firmware
permitted, this would undoubtedly have been how graphics were handled
also), and that such text should be computable on the fly. Let’s compute
my favourite easy-to-remember approximation of π. Type <tt>355/113</tt>
and highlight it with the LEAP keys: hold down LEAP LEFT and type 3
(jumps to the first three), then hold down LEAP RIGHT and type 3 again
(jumps to the last three), then press both LEAP keys.</p>

<p>We can now tap USE FRONT-CALC (the G key), a little CALC icon will

this is configurable.) The dotted line underneath it indicates it is a

<p>That’s handy as a desk calculator, and the syntax supports operator
precedence and parentheses as well as functions like <tt>sqrt</tt>, but
the really fun part is when we use this to store values in memory. Let’s
define a variable <tt>pi</tt> with the same calculation
<tt>355/113</tt>. We enter <tt>pi:355/113</tt> and then highlight it
with the LEAP keys (leap left to the <tt>p</tt>, leap right to the
<tt>3</tt>, then with LEAP RIGHT still held down press USE FRONT-LEAP
RIGHT to leap again to the second three, then with LEAP RIGHT still held

<p>As you may have already guessed, those values we entered aren’t
fixed: they can be changed and recalculated. Let’s change
<tt>radius</tt> to 10 by tapping LEAP LEFT until we’re back in that
field (or LEAP LEFT to the 6). If we press USE FRONT-CALC while within
the result of a calculation, the expression you entered to generate it
is preserved and now can be edited.</p>

And thus our <tt>pi<em>radius</em>radius</tt> duly changes as well. If
we changed the name of the variable or entered other nonsense or did
something like divide by zero, the Cat will calmly display question
marks to indicate any dependent result is invalid, and you can edit the
expression with CALC again to fix it.
<p>
<p>This process can be slow if there are lots of things to compute, and
the 5MHz 68K isn’t exactly a speed demon. Pressing any key while the
CALC icon is displayed will cancel the operation, true for any such task
including printing except DISK (for obvious reasons) and one more to be
discussed.</p>

Does this sound a little like a spreadsheet? I’m so glad you asked!
Because Cat text is fixed-width, setting up consistent rows and columns
is simply a matter of tab stops and character width, adjusting the
document margins if necessary. Tabs separate cells and the editor treats
them as such with the function <tt>use()</tt>.
<p>
<p>Let’s enter a simple spreadsheet where we will compute the tax on a
sale of widgets and then total the transaction. We’ll specify unit price
and number sold, and compute a fixed tax of 10% (though this could just
as easily be a variable). There are two tab stops between the Unit Price
and the Sales, so the expression becomes
<tt>use(-3)<em>use(-1)</em>0.10</tt> to compute unit price times sales
times 10%.</p>

It would be a gross distortion to say every nuance of the Cat is
discoverable and/or self-explanatory. In fact, some procedural aspects
of it, while sensible once you learn them, are not at all obvious.
<p>
<p>But there is ample online help if you hold down USE FRONT/Control and
press HELP (by default the N key). This is the default screen if there
is no pending error state. If there were an error, such as a problem
reading the disk, the Cat will beep politely and pressing USE FRONT-HELP
will instead explain the error in prose. (Raskin hated modals.)</p>

<h3>
Sallying tForth into the ROM
</h3>
<p>
<p>Anyway, except for that easter egg, everything you saw was what Canon
wanted you to see — a sophisticated word processor. But what Jef Raskin
wanted you to see, and Canon didn’t, was a general-purpose computer that
just happened to use a word processor-like primary interface, complete
with a built-in programming language. That language is Forth, as
descended from <a href="/2024/05/refurb-weekend-canon-cat.html">the
original Swyft</a>, or more accurately tForth, an implementation using
tokens (the “t”) instead of direct addresses for each <i>word</i> in a
word definition. This requires a level of indirection to look up the
execution address when a word is executed, a semantic difference between
this concept and a bytecode approach, but it also means that words can
be redefined or even deleted without leaving stale pointers in unrelated
words that reference them. More importantly, code can be considerably
more compact because tokens don’t necessarily need to be the size of an
entire address (Cat tokens are byte-sized, though often taken as
word-sized groups) and the code they reference can be moved and
compacted. This was important given the 256K of memory the Cat shipped
with, which wasn’t a huge amount even in the mid-1980s and had to be
shared with the video circuitry.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, although officially undocumented, a gateway to Forth
remains in the Cat. It is triggered by a straightforward — albeit
unlikely — series of keystrokes, which works in both MAME and the real
hardware. Start out by typing <tt>Enable Forth Language</tt> (easiest in
a blank document or workspace).</p>

Lock this change in by typing the magic incantation <tt>-1 wheel!
savesetup re</tt> and press ENTER. This enables “expert mode” and saves
it to battery-backed settings RAM, then returns to the editor. Now the
Forth mode is unlocked, and the hacking can begin. In future you won’t
need to do the “Enable Forth Language” dance again as long as your
settings RAM or battery doesn’t get whacked.
<p>
<p>Forth is accessed in two ways, one of which you just saw for entering
commands at a traditional REPL-like prompt. This is the mode we will
primarily be using, and is fully supported by the operating system, but
the other fashion is clearly more Raskinesque. Remember how you could
highlight expressions and have the Cat compute them?</p>

Well, <em>now</em> that works for Forth, but instead of USE FRONT-CALC,
you’ll use USE FRONT-ANSWER. This article will not seek to teach you
Forth (the
<a href="https://www.forth.com/starting-forth/0-starting-forth/">online
version of <i>Starting Forth</i></a> is a far better instructional tool
than I could ever write), and I certainly do not profess to have
superior fluency in it myself. However, for illustrative purposes I’ll
be using relatively simple code that most people should be able to grok
at a conceptual level. Just remember that since Forth is the canonical
stack language, everything gets pushed and popped to stacks, and as such
control structures and arithmetic appear “backwards” compared to other
programming languages. (Forth’s famous use of reverse Polish notation is
thus simply a logical consequence of the language.)

<p>In any event, upon pressing USE FRONT-ANSWER …</p>

Interestingly, if you try to ask the online help for information on the
ANSWER key, you just get the ERASE key help page no matter what you do.
ANSWER isn’t even referenced in the user manual. While ANSWER does
appear on the front of the key just like any other key you can USE FRONT
with, it does nothing until you enable Forth, and many or even most of
its contemporary users likely never pondered what it was there for.

This is tForth for “I don’t know that word.” Forth has a reputation as a
language so close to the metal that one wrong move will bring the system
down. I’ve personally experienced that writing for the 68K Mac in Pocket
Forth, where unbalancing the stack can lead to a system error faster
than you can say guru meditation. Yes, Forth programmers are Real Men,
Manly Men, Speakers of the One True Manly Language, Men on the Bleeding
Edge, who point and laugh uproariously at you toddling along with your
IDE and your wussy little C compiler. (Or womenly women, or neither.
This blog is totes egalitarian.)
<p>
<p>So here’s a little warning: tForth is not nearly that hostile, but
while it may have more guardrails than the typical Forth implementation,
that’s not saying very much. Although the ROM is relatively resistant to
rookie mistakes and I’m not aware of anything that can permanently brick
the logic board, you <em>can</em> damage things (like getting the track
and address transposed when you command the disk drive to seek!), you
<em>can’t</em> interrupt a Forth operation if you inadvertently cause an
infinite loop, you <em>can</em> freely trash the system and anything in
memory, and you <em>can</em> lock up the system so severely that nothing
will fix it but a powercycle. To borrow
<a href="http://www.codersnotes.com/notes/a-constructive-look-at-templeos/">a
quote from Terry A. Davis</a>, tForth “is a motorbike. If you lean over
too far, you’ll fall off. Don’t do that.” This particular minefield
won’t blow off your arms, but it might throw you on the ground pretty
hard.</p>

Anyway, we’ll return to our previous example and do some more messing

handy for reducing wear on the power switch, but doesn’t seem to work in
MAME.
<p>
<p>A fair bit of the fundamentals on which this article is based come
from the copious technical documentation on the platform, collected and
preserved at <a href="http://www.canoncat.net/">canoncat.net</a>. Some
of it actually hails from the Swyft’s development, but the Cat is so
similar to its ancestor that most of their content is still relevant.
We’ll then build on this basis for the tricks we’ll pull.</p>

Here’s the memory map from the Cat tForth manual, which I have marked up
and corrected according to production models. The stock Cat officially
comes with 256K of main memory plus 8K of battery-backed RAM for storing
settings and the user dictionary. This was apparently 16K in earlier
iterations, and is 16K in MAME, but my system just has an 8K SRAM and
only an 8K SRAM is described in the official service manual. 512K is the
greatest amount of RAM supported by the hardware.
<p>
<p>The 256K system ROM is located at the bottom of the address space
with the lowest 1K being the 68K exception vector table, and above that
the battery-backed settings RAM from $040000 to $041fff. The main RAM
starts at $400000, which is also where the 28896-byte (~28K) 672x344
monochrome display bitmap is stored. From $600000 and up is the
memory-mapped I/O range, but we will rarely manipulate those devices
directly.</p>

<p>From the Forth prompt you can do any Forth operation, including
defining new words, though long lines don’t wrap and complex words are
better defined within the editor. Here we’re storing a simple vertical
strip of bytes to video memory as a “hello world” (<tt>20 0 do i i 54 *
400000 + c! loop</tt>). The framebuffer is linear and byte-addressed
with 84 bytes for each 672 pixel line, and is white on black (i.e., set
pixels are white, unset pixels are black). Note that all values
displayed and entered are in hexadecimal by default.</p>

<p>Usually, the next thing you do in a new Forth environment after your
“hello world” or moral equivalent is ask what other words are around.
But here, by default, nothing shows.</p>

<p>tForth has the concept of <i>vocabularies</i>, which are organized
into a tree and a search order, and the user can define additional ones.
The word <tt>existing</tt> tells us the present vocabularies, which are
<tt>function</tt>, <tt>arithmetic</tt>, <tt>user</tt>, <tt>hidden</tt>
and <tt>forth</tt>, all of which descend from <tt>forth</tt>, which is
the root. As shipped, however, this scheme is not greatly exploited: the
<tt>arithmetic</tt> vocab is completely empty, there are only a handful
of math and stat operations in <tt>function</tt>, and you obviously have
to add your own to <tt>user</tt>. Most of the ROM word action occurs in
<tt>hidden</tt>, which contains the words for the editor (and is hidden
from listings, but are all executable), and in <tt>forth</tt>, from
which all blessings flow. Although sixteen vocabularies may be in play
at any time, it doesn’t look like this capability was ever taken to its
fullest extent.</p>

We’ll mostly deal with the <tt>forth</tt> vocabulary, and the
<tt>new</tt> vocabulary, of course, because we’ll be adding words of our
own. However, the <tt>hidden</tt> vocabulary is absolutely present and
available and you needn’t explicitly open a vocabulary simply to use the
words in it.
<p>
<p>Also, you don’t need to try to read every word on this screen and
extract them from ROM either because I’ve already done it for you. Go
ahead and open up <a href="https://github.com/classilla/catbox">the
Github Catbox project</a> and refer to
<a href="https://github.com/classilla/catbox/blob/main/words">the handy
list of words</a>, including everything in the <tt>hidden</tt> vocab.
We’ll be using tools from the Catbox to do more spelunking in the ROM
very shortly.</p>

</div>
<p>A couple more things about tForth before we get to talking about the
disk format. The <tt>‘</tt> word (a literal apostrophe, say “tick”)
tells you the token for any word, including words in ROM. As usual for
Forth, all words are (at least initially) executable machine code,
though some words are entirely so. You can use the token to do a lookup
and find where that code begins, or you can use the word <tt>c’</tt>
(“c-tick”) which will do that for you. The lookup is done in the
<i>token table</i>, which exists in RAM and whose location can
potentially vary, though on a 1.74 system the first address reliably
seems to remain at $410400 (not $40ec00 as in the memory map). The token
table gets initialized and copied into RAM as part of startup, making it
possible to patch ROM words if necessary to point to new in-RAM
definitions. <i>Spoiler alert: this will be necessary.</i> Here, we’ve
dumped some of the memory at <tt>cold</tt>’s execution address to
demonstrate it’s written in 68K assembly, as you would expect for
something that cold-starts the machine.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both;">
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgaliQfedYKoUekjkxg9ieJnb6-mlr3M_iRxSFSQFkzrMphc_gWNBAdGRYJ-4lM-uGTJzLYOpDxoEzIh9un4IOC72RCrvdoH_zBiIWo2vzkN5ugyzhd_yqg1JuKwxW74UIa89nVxHUJ2xX2fBqriwwL8_VFE-QQPyxLvaS4TmGdytOipWlCbSOPro_W6T8/s672/0001.png" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; "><img alt="" border="0" width="320" data-original-height="504" data-original-width="672" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgaliQfedYKoUekjkxg9ieJnb6-mlr3M_iRxSFSQFkzrMphc_gWNBAdGRYJ-4lM-uGTJzLYOpDxoEzIh9un4IOC72RCrvdoH_zBiIWo2vzkN5ugyzhd_yqg1JuKwxW74UIa89nVxHUJ2xX2fBqriwwL8_VFE-QQPyxLvaS4TmGdytOipWlCbSOPro_W6T8/s320/0001.png"/></a>
</div>
<p>But not every word in ROM is in assembler, just ones where
performance was important or direct code merely more expedient. The
<tt>save</tt> word, which we’ll be exploring a lot more later on, is
written in tForth. We know this because the first 68K opcode to get
executed is $4ed3 or <tt>jmp (a3)</tt>, calling the address in 68K
register A3, which during tForth execution contains the address for the
<i>nesting</i> routine. This block of native code saves the tForth
equivalent of the return address, computing it as a delta from the
calling word to the new word. It then does some other housekeeping, sets
the new tForth instruction pointer in A5 to the byte after the <tt>jmp
(a3)</tt> and falls through to the very critical <i>next</i> routine
(kept in A4), which grabs the execution address for the next word at the
A5 instruction pointer and jumps into it.</p>

</div>
<p>For housekeeping, words in a vocabulary have <i>headers</i>, which
contain an encoded offset into the starting address table and the word’s
ASCII string with a length and flags byte. Only the first 32 bytes of a
word’s ASCII string are considered significant. The header for a word
can ordinarily be obtained with <tt>n’</tt> (“n-tick”) but words in ROM
don’t appear to have one. (In fact, they do, but the routines
intentionally? don’t look at that portion of ROM.)</p>

</div>
However, new words we define certainly have headers, like this more
canonical “hello world” example (<tt>: hello .” hello world” cr ;</tt>).
Here we can see it was given a token, see its execution address
(starting with <tt>jmp (a3)</tt>), and see its header containing the
encoded offset, then the length-and-flags byte, and then the string
<tt>hello</tt>, plus some trailing garbage (the entry ends right after
the string). The encoded offset and flags are mutable and can be changed
later.
<p>
That’s a sufficient understanding of tForth under the hood for what’s
coming up.

<h3>
Reading and writing Cat disks
</h3>
<p>
In <a href="/2024/05/refurb-weekend-canon-cat.html">our previous entry
on the Canon Cat hardware</a>, we shored up the Cat’s internal floppy
drive, which is a Canon-manufactured device specific to it. However, the
disks it uses are ordinary 3.5” floppy disks, and modern low-level
imaging tools can read them in a standard PC drive.
<p>
The basic rudiments of the format have been known for awhile thanks to
Dwight Elvey — if Raskin was the father of the Cat, then Elvey would
surely be its godfather — and
<a href="http://www.canoncat.net/cat/Cat%20Forth%20Inside.txt">his
notes</a> indicate the drive is writing regular 512-byte sectors, 10 per
track and 80 tracks per disk, single-sided. (Atari ST enthusiasts will
find this format familiar. While the ST by default stores only nine
sectors per track, it can store ten, such as on titles such as
<a href="https://www.filfre.net/2016/01/a-pirates-life-for-me-part-3-case-studies-in-copy-protection/">Dungeon
Master</a>.) That’s 400K a disk, and since the Cat only shipped with
256K and had additional RAM sockets only for 384K total, the entirety of
the supported RAM will fit. Both double-density and high-density 3.5”
floppies apparently work, though I have plenty of new-in-box DD floppies
here and we’ll use those.
<p>
<p>Since I wanted nice clean disks written on a good quality drive for
my Cat, I decided to go down to CompUSA and buy a new floppy drive
too.</p>

<p>Yeah, okay, eBay. But while I was looking for a new shrink-wrapped
drive I ran across this NOS CompUSA-boxed floppy drive package with

went, and I wanted a new one anyhow.</p>

<p>The drive is one of the very common Teac FD-235 series. They are very
easy to find used, and, it turns out, new as well. The disk cleaner kit
went immediately to doing a few cycles on the Cat drive itself even
though the head looked pretty good when I inspected it.</p>

For our disk imaging we’ll use an off-the-hobbyist-shelf and inexpensive
<a href="https://github.com/keirf/greaseweazle">Greaseweazle</a>. These
USB-based devices have open source software for Linux, Windows and macOS
and are available from multiple sellers.
<p>
<p>Sadly, here’s where we leave MAME behind, since it doesn’t support
the floppy drive or disk images yet. Remember us typing <tt>Enable Forth
Language</tt>? Let’s make a disk out of that on the real Cat. The DISK
help screen looks like this:</p>

In short terms, if you have a blank disk in the drive and have unsaved
text in memory, then pressing USE FRONT-DISK will cause the Cat to
format the disk and save your document. However, the tForth
documentation also explains that all Forth words in RAM get written as
well, which is critical for our hackery. Ordinarily there wouldn’t be
any, of course, but it would if there were. Correspondingly, DISK will
also load a document and any associated words from a new disk as well,
though any disk access regardless of direction is still centered on the
editor — the Cat doesn’t run applications in the traditional sense.
(Spoiler alert: hang tight.)
<p>
But that’s not all it’s saving, though. If you read the DISK help
carefully, you’ll note it says something about showing “a sample of
what’s on the disk” if you have a different disk present. Ignoring the
question right now of how it determines which disk goes with what
workspace, how can it show the document on the floppy disk if the
entirety of RAM could be on it? Wouldn’t it overwrite the document in
memory?
<p>
Let’s dump this disk and investigate. It’s possible that the Canon drive
uses some weir-dass GCR format, but it turns out to our delight that
it’s regular MFM. Since we know it’s single-sided, there’s no need to
check both sides, and we can stop scanning at track 80. Thus, we can get
a read of the disk as a straight in-order sector dump with <tt>gw read
–format=ibm-scan –tracks=c=0-79:h=0 test.img</tt>.

An immediately interesting thing about this image dump is that each
track (cylinder)’s ten sectors are numbered 0-9, not 1-10 which is more
typical.
<p>
If we dump strings, we can find our text <tt>Enable Forth Language</tt>
near the end of the image. This makes sense since the text is stored in
the upper part of RAM, above the Forth dictionary. We can see some other
strings like <tt>-1 wheel! savesetup re</tt> presumably from when we
entered that command, though it appears earlier in the file.

We know that each track is 5120 bytes ($1400, 512 bytes times 10

This repeated sector is called the <i>idblock</i> and appears in the
technical documentation for the Cat’s editor. Because this is a 68K,
everything is big-endian as G-d Himself intended, though a fair bit of
it is unused. It contains copies of the 68000 data and address registers
in the first 64 bytes, the 68000 status register, a two-bit disk format
ID ($3326 here, but an earlier $3325 format is also accepted) required
to identify the disk as written by a Cat, a number of tracks ($0011 ==
17, though we found nineteen), various editor state variables, a
128-byte disk identifier called the <i>idtable</i> (that’s how it knows
which workspace is what, though only about 24 bytes of it are actually
populated here), and then pointers for any keyboard macros that were
defined.
<p>
The documentation notes that backup idblocks appear elsewhere on the
disk as well. One of these is in the first sector of the second track.
After that we see a lot of binary data with some scattered snippets of
text (later comparison shows this is the contents of the SV-RAM), and
then starting with the first sector of the third track this peculiarly
familiar-looking pattern:

<p>If you look at our screenshot for <tt>Enable Forth Language</tt>, you
see two 50% dithered grey blocks above and below it. Those are the
document separators. Anyone who’s messed around with the video memory in
a monochrome framebuffer will recognize the pattern of <tt>aa 55</tt> as
<tt>10101010 01010101</tt> — a 50% grey. Since we know our framebuffer
is linear and contiguous, let’s pull out the 28896 bytes (84 bytes per
line times 344 lines) from this offset and stick a Portable Bit Map
header on it. Guess what:</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both;">

</div>
That’s our text as a screenshot, just inverted, because PBM is black on
white. As the Cat also dumps video memory when it saves to disk, the
preview feature is nothing more than just loading it back. A clever
idea, too: it’s quick, it’s reversible with a repaint and it doesn’t
disturb anything else in memory. In fact, we can also see when fully
loading a document disk into the Cat that the preview image is loaded
into video memory as part of that process too (which gives the illusion
of it loading faster than it truly does). Moreover, the Cat doesn’t seem
to care what image data is there as long as it can read it.
<p>
So, as a test to make sure we can write our own arbitrary data to a Cat
floppy, let’s write something that can patch in a custom image. For the
picture data, I found a photo of Jef Raskin sitting at a desk in front
of a Cat, cropped and resized it to the right proportions, then crushed
and dithered it out to a ready PBM with <tt>magick raskin.png -resize
672x344! -dither FloydSteinberg -remap pattern:gray50 -negate
raskin.pbm</tt>.
<p>
Now we need a disk format we can master a new floppy from. This sector
dump, as easy as it was to parse, will not suffice for this purpose;
there’s not enough metadata about the sectors and tracks for the
Greaseweazle software to create the right geometry. We’d also like a
format that’s well-documented and higher-level than raw flux or raw MFM
because we know the Canon drive is writing renumbered but otherwise
normal sectors, and it will make the disk image easier to alter. And, of
course, the Greaseweazle software needs to support it. After reading
through the Greaseweazle wiki’s
<a href="https://github.com/keirf/greaseweazle/wiki/Supported-Image-Types">list
of supported formats</a>, I settled on the CPC
<a href="https://www.cpcwiki.eu/index.php/Format:DSK_disk_image_file_format">extended
DSK format</a> since it has a fully documented specification and was
likely to capture any unforeseen necessary nuances of the Cat’s format,
but still provides the actual sector data as decoded bytes. It can be
captured with a command line like <tt>gw read –format=ibm-scan
–tracks=c=0-79:h=0 test.edsk</tt>.
<p>
To verify viability, I captured the same floppy as eDSK and then wrote
it to another blank disk (<tt>gw write test.edsk</tt>), and checked if
the Cat would read that. It did!
<p>
However, moving to a higher fidelity format sometimes introduces
complications. One complication while reading test disks written by the
Cat was that some (not all) of them didn’t actually start on physical
track zero: they started on physical track two, leaving physical tracks
zero and one unformatted, even though the track as written
<em>claimed</em> to be track zero. I wasn’t sure of the significance of
this at the time — we’ll revisit this later. Interestingly, the eDSK
format also revealed that <em>every</em> sector on track zero is tagged
as sector one, all ten of them, probably to speed up checking if the
idtable on disk matches the current workspace or not since any sector
will do.
<p>
The second complication is that we no longer get sectors in logical
order but rather in the physical order they appear on disk, which may or
may not match. The Cat doesn’t seem to write tracks with any particular
interleave, so to read and write the eDSK sectors we’ll need to consult
the Track Information Block (TIB) for each track to determine which
sector is at which offset.
<p>
<p>In the Catbox are two Perl tools,
<a href="https://github.com/classilla/catbox/blob/main/catrpic"><tt>catrpic</tt></a>
that will extract a PBM-format image from a Cat eDSK image (emitting the
picture to standard output), and
<a href="https://github.com/classilla/catbox/blob/main/catwpic"><tt>catwpic</tt></a>
that will take a PBM-format image of the right dimensions and insert it
into a Cat eDSK (emitting the hybrid eDSK to standard output). You’ve
seen this picture before, but here it is again, the Cat loading from
this modified disk image:</p>

Unfortunately there’s not much else on this disk to load, so the picture
doesn’t stay on screen for very long. To rectify that we’ll have to
figure out how to make the Cat automatically run code from a disk.
Spoiler alert: <i>there’s a way to make the Cat automatically run code

<p>
<h3>
Hack No. 1: The Jef Raskin Picture Disk
</h3>
<p>
In fact, some of you may have already realized how. Let’s look at the
idblock again, in which I mentioned the first 64 bytes are an image of
the 68K data and address registers, eight each. In the 68000
architecture register A7 is the stack pointer. Because we have control
of the stack pointer, we have control of the CPU’s return address: if we
change A7 in the idblock to another location, we can store a different
return address there, and on the next <tt>RTS</tt> we’ll take over the
CPU. This isn’t a flaw in the Cat’s operating system, by the way — think
of it more like <a href="https://github.com/4g3v/steelhax">save-file
hacking</a>, except that there’s no ASLR or execute protection, so once
you’re in, you’re in.

Reprising our disk’s idblock, A7 is marked in bold:
<p>
<div class="tx">

That location $407cfc is past the end of display memory at $4070e0 but
before the variable area declared to start at $40a280, so we can
hypothesize the processor stack normally lives somewhere in this range
(the tForth memory map calls this block part of the display memory, but
it doesn’t appear onscreen).
<p>
The Cat editor documentation provides two words that control saving and
loading from a disk: <tt>save</tt> and <tt>restore</tt>. In the Catbox I
wrote up <a href="https://github.com/classilla/catbox/blob/main/fdis">a
tForth ROM disassembler in Perl called <tt>fdis</tt></a> that works with
the 1.74 ROMs (recovered tForth source code also exists for this, but
you can be confident you’re seeing exactly what’s being run by pulling
from the ROM). If you’ve got the MAME ROMs, unzip <tt>cat.zip</tt> and
convert the 1.74 ROMs from interleaved to continuous using
<a href="https://github.com/classilla/catbox/blob/main/interleave_rom">the
Catbox’s <tt>interleave_rom</tt> tool</a>, like so:
<p>
<div class="tx">
<pre>
% ./interleave_rom r74*.ic[24] &gt; rom
% ./interleave_rom r74*.ic[35] &gt;&gt; rom
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Now we can use <tt>fdis</tt> to walk the ROM and print out the tForth
opcodes for a given token (if it’s a variable or 68K code, it will say
so instead). We’ll start with the <tt>restore</tt> routine, since we’re
trying to intercept loading. It appears deceptively short:
<p>
<div class="tx">
<pre>
% ./fdis rom restore
token = 0x016b
0002cb88 1128 cstate
0002cb8a 65   off
0002cb8b 0305 &lt;restore&gt;
0002cb8d ff   don
0002cb8e 4e   raddr
0002cb8f d3   emit
0002cb90 120c lastop
0002cb92 14e8 %disk
0002cb94 7c   =
0002cb95 26   &lt;;&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p>
<p>Yes, words can have angle brackets in them or indeed any symbol other
than whitespace. The meat appears to be in the word
<tt>&lt;restore&gt;</tt>, but the editor technical documentation says
it’s tricky:</p>
<blockquote>
The word <tt>&lt;restore&gt;</tt> reads useful information from the
idblock (already read from the disk by the Disk command … After this, it
reads the display memory, immediately displaying it on the screen. Then
it reads the remaining off-screen contents of the disk into memory.
<p>
It then executes the second half of <tt>&lt;save&gt;</tt> by use of a
non-standard programming method. The entire machine state, including
return stack, program counter and instruction pointer, is recorded. When
it is restored (copied back into memory), execution resumes where it
left off when <tt>&lt;save&gt;</tt> began writing the image into memory.
This creates an unusual situation.
<p>
The same code (in the second half of <tt>&lt;save&gt;</tt> is used by
both <tt>save</tt> and <tt>&lt;restore&gt;</tt>.
</blockquote>
The text isn’t quite accurate because the PC is not, in fact, part of
the idblock, but it does tell us most of the action is actually in
<tt>&lt;save&gt;</tt>. The reason both operations exit through common
code is because the save operation compacts the dictionary and working
text in memory before writing them out, so both the restore and save
operations must unpack them before returning to the editor — in the
restore case, after loading it from disk, and in the save case, after
writing it. This particular word has a somewhat lengthy definition and
we’re going to tear it apart later, but we can see right in the
beginning of <tt>&lt;save&gt;</tt> that the magic is done by a 68K
assembly routine:
<p>
<div class="tx">
<pre>
% ./fdis rom "&lt;save&gt;"
token = 0x0304
0002c8d2 0433 notepointers
0002c8d4 0151 packforth
0002c8d6 0435 packtext

0002c8e2 5b   w!
0002c8e3 0106 recal
0002c8e5 e5   ?diskerror
0002c8e6 21   wlit 0x812c
0002c8e9 dd   call
[...]
</pre>
</div>
<p>
This is calling a ROM routine at $812c. This routine, in part, starts by
capturing the CPU registers:
<p>
<div class="tx">
<pre>
 00812C  move    SR, $407664.l                               40F9 0040 7664
 008132  movem.l A0-A7, $407600.l                            48F9 FF00 0040 7600
 00813A  movem.l D0-D7, $407620.l                            48F9 00FF 0040 7620
</pre>
</div>
<p>
which is used for the memory image of the outgoing idblock starting at
$407600. When the restore runs, another 68K ROM routine is called at the
end of <tt>&lt;restore&gt;</tt> after loading everything:
<p>
<div class="tx">
<pre>
% ./fdis rom "&lt;restore&gt;"
token = 0x0305
0002ca6c d4   cls
0002ca6d 0106 recal
0002ca6f e5   ?diskerror
0002ca70 0109 idblock

0002cb5b 21   wlit 0x8368
0002cb5e dd   call

0002cb83 38   &lt;abort"&gt;
0002cb84 26   &lt;;&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p>
The ROM routine it calls at $8368 finishes by restoring those registers
from the in-memory idblock.
<p>
<div class="tx">

<p>
Assuming no error condition is detected, this routine has the effect of
restoring the stack pointer and all registers, including the state of
the tForth VM which is entirely stored in registers, to point to the
tForth word after the call to $812c in <tt>&lt;save&gt;</tt>. I note for
completeness that this call actually occurs in two places, but both are
in the first part of the word, so the second part of
<tt>&lt;save&gt;</tt> is executed regardless. (The <tt>LEA</tt> and
<tt>JMP</tt> idiom at $83ac is a fast way of doing a subroutine call by
not pushing to the stack and appears frequently in the Cat ROM.)
<p>
Now that we know where it comes out, and since we know restoring the
previous stack pointer will eventually return to the editor, we can
insert a diversion: during the loading process we’ll have the user press
a key to continue, so that they can appreciate our splendidly rendered
image, and then return to the editor via the rest of
<tt>&lt;save&gt;</tt>. Let’s make this a picture disk, complete with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jef_Raskin">Jef Raskin’s
Wikipedia entry</a>, so that you can read his biography using the Cat he
designed. It should show his picture, wait for the user’s admiration,
and then load the article which can be then scrolled and searched with
the LEAP keys.
<p>
<p>For the text, we’re going to take advantage of the serial port to
load the document for us. I used Lynx to download and render the
Wikipedia text to 80-column plain text, cleaned it up in a text editor,
and added some instructions.</p>

<p>The next step is to transmit it. Oddly enough, the serial connection
does <em>not</em> use a null modem: use a straight-thru DB-25 male on
the Cat end to DE-9 (“DB-9”) female on your workstation’s end, with your
favourite USB to RS-232 dongle if you need it. The serial port on the
Cat is between the printer port and the phone jacks.</p>

in the Setup screen we’ll switch it to the “SEND Command” (used for

You may have noticed the absence of flow control options in the Setup
screen, and that’s because the Cat only supports software flow control
with XON/XOFF. (This will be relevant in the third hack.) Sending the
text full blast will drop characters because the CPU has to wrap and
format it as text arrives.
<p>
<p>To avoid this problem, you could obviously use a terminal program
that supports XON/XOFF, or you could simply send data with a slight
delay after each character. I provide
<a href="https://github.com/classilla/catbox/blob/main/sendfile.c">just
such a program (written in C)</a> in the Catbox; compile it with
something like <tt>gcc -O2 -o sendfile sendfile.c</tt>. To send the file
with a 10ms intercharacter delay, use a command line like <tt>sendfile
/dev/ttyUSB0 9600 raskin.txt 1,10</tt> which says to use
<tt>/dev/ttyUSB0</tt> at 9600 baud, sending <tt>raskin.txt</tt> with
10ms after every one character. Here the POWER9 Linux workstation is
pushing the document to the Cat which streams as characters are received
to the screen. Make sure text you transmit this way has CR-LF line
endings (e.g., <tt>set ff=dos</tt> in <tt>vim</tt>).</p>

With the document loaded, we’ll lock it against editing by pressing
DOCUMENT LOCK and save it to disk with USE FRONT-DISK. The disk is
blank, so it saves it immediately, after which we image it to an eDSK.
<p>
Now for the executable portion. Obviously we could write this code in
68K assembly, but we have a limited amount of space before potentially
running into the <em>real</em> stack and we’d like to keep the code as
small as possible. That means writing it in tForth, so we need a means
to jump back into tForth and have the VM run anonymous code that is not
actually stored as a “real” word.
<p>
As it happens, tForth supports this as part of the <tt>goto</tt> word,
which directly executes “naked” tForth code from memory given an
execution address. It does this using a special reserved word called
<tt>temp</tt>. <tt>temp</tt>’s definition ordinarily is simply to return
an error message:
<p>
<div class="tx">
<pre>
% ./fdis rom temp
token = 0x00f8
0000dc52 55   1
0000dc53 37   &lt;"&gt; "unassigned token "
0000dc66 38   &lt;abort"&gt;
0000dc67 26   &lt;;&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p>
The <tt>&lt;abort”&gt;</tt> word takes a condition and a string, and if
the condition is true, displays the string as an error and aborts. As
the default definition pushes a literal 1 to the stack as the first
value, running this word under normal circumstances will immediately
raise an error and halt. But remember that the token table is in RAM and
therefore mutable. The <tt>goto</tt> word exploits this fact:
<p>
<div class="tx">
<pre>
./fdis rom goto
token = 0x00fe
0000dbbe 21   wlit 0x00f8
0000dbc1 92   +table
0000dbc2 5c   !
0000dbc3 f8   temp
0000dbc4 26   &lt;;&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p>
The word <tt>+table</tt> is 68K code that takes the given token value
(it’s $f8 here, which we know is <tt>temp</tt>) and returns the location
of its execution address in the token table, basically multiplying it by
4 and adding the base address. This gets called a lot, so it needs to be
fast. In practice the address it yields appears to be constant and
predictable, so the execution address for <tt>temp</tt> will always be
located in the token table at $4107e0 on a 1.74 ROM system. It then
stores the new address — presto, the word is redefined — and calls it.
The tForth technical docs warn that the code must end with a
<tt>next</tt> token instead of the usual <tt>&lt;;&gt;</tt> for proper
continuation, which we can accommodate. To run the new chimaeric
<tt>temp</tt>, we’ll call the Forth word <tt>execute</tt>, which is a
68K ROM routine residing at $d5ea that takes the token value and token
table address of a word and runs it.
<p>
The 68K assembly equivalent of this is straightforward, which we’ll call
our <i>trampoline</i>. We’ll change A7 in every copy of the idblock in
the eDSK to point to a new 32-bit address which points to the word after
that, where our machine code payload will reside, followed by our tForth
tokens. Since we know where the display is on disk and we know the
framebuffer ends in the middle of a sector (28896 is not an even
multiple of 512), we have 288 extra bytes in that sector to insert the
code right there and still remain reasonably clear of the <em>real</em>
stack. This address could be $4070e0, immediately after the display
ends, but since things can get pushed temporarily it’s better to move it
down a bit so garbage doesn’t spill onto the bottom of the screen (I use
$407120 which gives a 64-byte red zone). The code looks like this, which
we compute at the time we patch the eDSK:
<p>
<div class="tx">
<pre>
00407120 address pointing to entry 0040 7124
entry:
00407124 movea.l #OLD_A7,a7        2E7C OLD_ A7__
0040712a movea.l #$4107e0,a1       227C 0041 07E0
00407130 move.l #target,(a1)       22BC 0040 7142
00407136 move.l #$000000f8,d0      203C 0000 00F8
0040713c jmp $0000d5ea             4EF9 0000 D5EA
target:
00407142 jmp (a3)                  4ED3
; tforth tokens follow
</pre>
</div>
<p>
We restore the old A7 value, store the address of our payload
(<tt>target</tt>) to <tt>temp</tt>’s entry in the token table and
leaving the entry’s address in A1, load the token for <tt>temp</tt> to
D0 and jump into <tt>execute</tt>. I chose to use full 32-bit long
encodings for the parameters to make it easier to adjust for other ROM
versions with different addresses and token values. Notice that our
payload looks just like a regular tForth word, starting with the call
into the nesting routine. The D0 and A1 registers belong to a volatile
set used for arguments to ROM routines and are not part of the tForth
register state, so we can clobber them with impunity. We changed no
other relevant register other than A7 and we immediately set it back, so
we have not changed anything else other than to divert into our own
code. When our tForth block finishes, our cuckoo word will be unnested
and we’ll fall right back into <tt>&lt;save&gt;</tt> to complete the
restore process as if we never left it.
<p>
Finally, the tForth itself, which immediately follows the machine code
trampoline. The <tt>&lt;demit&gt;</tt> word will draw text to the
display at the given address; if the text has the high bit set, it will
render it in reverse video. Bold or normal text is determined by what
was used the last time a character was displayed, though for this
purpose either weight works. The code we want to execute is <tt>” press
any key” over + swap do i c@ i 407106 - 17 &lt;demit&gt; loop beep key
drop next ;</tt> which will put a string on the stack with its length,
loop over it and display each character, beep once, wait for a key,
throw it away and then exit as <tt>goto</tt> requires through
<tt>next</tt>. We could look the tokens up by hand, but we also can just
define it to a throwaway word and dump from its execution address using
<tt>c’</tt>.
<p>
<p>Our patcher will insert all of this into the 288 bytes at the end of
display memory on disk. Since most of you don’t have a Cat, here’s a
video of the picture disk in action.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

</div>
We turn on the Cat, insert the Raskin picture disk and press USE
FRONT-DISK. The disk loads, displaying our picture, and pauses with
“press any key” and a beep. (The disk light remains on as a side effect
since we haven’t yet run the word that turns the disk drive off.) We
press a key, loading completes, and the document appears. Next, we use
SHIFT and the LEAP keys to scroll line by line, then LEAP to the word
“Apple” forwards and back a few times (using USE FRONT-LEAP to leap
again with the same search), LEAP to the word “Aza,” and finally LEAP to
the DOCUMENT/PAGE marker, which will eventually bring us at the bottom
of the text. Sorry about the darkness and changing light levels, but
it’s hard to video a CRT with a Pixel 7 Pro.
<p>
The picture disk image is
<a href="https://github.com/classilla/catbox/tree/main/examples/raskin">in
the Catbox</a>. The patching program we’ll unveil at the end, since
we’re going to add more to it for the next couple hacks. Speaking of!
<p>
<h3>
Hack No. 2: CatTerm
</h3>
<p>
There are a couple downsides to what we just pulled for Hack No. 1, all
due to the fact we temporarily deviate from the restore process before
it completes. One minor drawback is that the floppy disk drive is still
active during code execution as the drive motor hasn’t been turned off
yet. But the big one is our limited execution area: the Forth dictionary
and document workspace are not unpacked until the end of loading, so the
technique we just used can only run within the small space provided and
can’t call longer words we create, only ones already in ROM.
<p>
That means we have to let the loading process finish to run larger
words, but if we do that naïvely then the Cat will still wind up in the
editor and never run our code. Altering the execution address for
<tt>&lt;save&gt;</tt> in the token table won’t help us because it’s
already in motion, and we can’t change the code that’s executing …
unless we copy <tt>&lt;save&gt;</tt> to RAM and run <em>that</em> as the
payload to our trampoline.
<p>
Here’s the rest of <tt>&lt;save&gt;</tt>, including the second call to
$812c. Either way we’ll end up in common code at $2c900 assuming no
errors.

</div>
<p>
The goal is to add code after the <tt>?diskerror</tt> word at $2c972
(which aborts on errors) and before the end of the definition at $2c973.
At that point the Cat’s state is fully restored and expanded from disk
but the editor has not yet been entered. Our tForth payload therefore
becomes a copy of everything from $2c900 to $2c972 inclusive, followed
by pushing our word’s token value with a <tt>wlit</tt> literal word and
<tt>execute re &lt;;&gt;</tt> with the explicit terminal call to
<tt>re</tt> cleaning up any residual leftovers. Mercifully, the branches
are relative and need not be relocated, and with the stack padding and
trampoline it still fits in the 288 bytes available, so we just spew out
the same tokens otherwise.
<p>
This idea has a lot of possibilities. For example, you could write up a
word to automatically execute from the disk to patch up editor words in
the token table for additional features, or install a utility, or even
take over the system entirely. (Spoiler alert: stay tuned.) So for this
second hack, we’re going to do something useful for a change: a simple
terminal program for the Cat. But wait, you say, doesn’t the Cat already
have the capability to send and receive serial data from the editor? It
does, but it’s not very asynchronous: you have to highlight and manually
send text (using SEND) and you can’t just type to the remote system, and
individual keystrokes are particularly inconvenient. Plus, maybe you
just don’t want your entire transcript in your document, especially if
you’re running low on space.
<p>
<p>As in the first hack, we’ll load the tForth source over the serial
port. Here it is:</p>

(Now here’s a great advancement in open source: it comes with its own
source code as the document, preparsed into the dictionary and set to
autostart. You can even preview the code with USE FRONT-DISK and see
what code you’re about to run. Wanna change it? Change the code in the
editor and USE FRONT-ANSWER, and the words will be redefined and ready
to execute. Save it to disk, repatch the disk image, and make it your
own.)
<p>
The main loop in <tt>cattermloop</tt> bounces between checking if a
character is waiting at the serial port and if a keypress is pending. If
one is at the port, it reads it and prints it to the terminal at the
cursor position. If one is at the keyboard, it grabs it, stuffs it into
the LEARN buffer if appropriate, and then checks to see if it’s the UNDO
key (code $e1). If it is, it exits the loop.
<p>
<p>The word we’ll execute, however, is <tt>catterm</tt>. I decided to be
a little silly here to prove a point. The Cat can operate in various
modes, with the variable <tt>edde</tt> set to true if it’s in the editor
and <tt>crt</tt> set to true if it’s at the prompt. But these are just
memory locations, so you can either do <tt>edde on</tt> or <tt>-1 40f884
!</tt>, which references its address explicitly (yes, values are
signed). By forcing these modes, you can make text go different places.
We don’t want anything emitted to the document, so if we started
execution from the editor we turn the <tt>edde</tt> variable off and the
<tt>crt</tt> variable on, start the loop, and then set them back and
repaint the screen (otherwise we “just do it”). Properly written,
however, you can also just say <tt>edde on</tt> and <tt>crt off</tt>,
and vice versa.</p>

We highlight the entire text and do USE FRONT-ANSWER to define the
words, and then take a test drive with <tt>catterm</tt> from the
<tt>ok</tt> prompt. It works! Now we’ll grab the token value for
<tt>catterm</tt> and use that as a parameter to the patch utility. The
exact value will vary depending on what words were defined already, but
in this case, it’s $07e2.
<p>
<p>As a last convenience we enter and highlight the word
<tt>catterm</tt> in the document so that you can just run it again from
the editor by pressing USE FRONT-ANSWER. We save it to disk and create a
disk image, and patch it. Here it is booting. I couldn’t run to the
workstation and type at the same time as I was filming, but you can see
that it autostarts and cleanly returns to the editor. The CatTerm disk
image is

I also demonstrate running it from the <tt>ok</tt> prompt by pressing
SHIFT-USE FRONT-SPACE, entering <tt>page</tt>, entering
<tt>catterm</tt>, and after pressing UNDO entering <tt>re</tt> to return
to the editor. Everything works just as it should. Port speed and
settings are configured with SETUP, just like everywhere else.

But what if you don’t <em>want</em> to return to the editor?

<h3>
Hack No. 3: The First Canon Cat Demo?
</h3>
<p>
This might be where I become branded a heretic by the School of Raskin
for escaping the primary interface. But it’s a general purpose computer,
and we should be able to use it for general purpose computer things.
Plenty of stuff took over the Mac entirely, so I don’t see why the Cat
should be any different.
<p>
For this last hack, we’ll go all the way live and make a full-fledged
slideshow demo. I’ll select and convert some pictures as a love letter
to the 1980s office and we’ll have the Cat load them in sequence
directly from disk. When you exit the demo, it will cold-start the
machine back to the editor (so we’ll dub this a “cold booter”).
<p>
Our payload can now be shorter, because the words for setting up the
editor no longer need to be run. However, we still need to unpack the
document text, such as it is (we can overwrite it later if we want),
because it must be shifted up in RAM first to ensure the Forth
dictionary ends up in the right place. In addition, we need to set a
system flag to prevent screen repaints during that process or any title
screen we put on the disk will get obliterated.
<p>
After the <tt>doff</tt> at $2c91d, which turns off the disk drive, in
our cold booter payload I insert a <tt>showmove? off</tt> to ensure
<tt>unpacktext</tt> doesn’t try to repaint the screen. We’ll then do
everything up to, but stop short of, the <tt>setupcat</tt> at $2c947.
Instead, at that point we’ll push our token and end with <tt>execute
cold ;</tt> since we won’t be returning to the editor and we won’t try
to keep any of the system variables intact.
<p>
Now for the pictures. It will be simplest to segregate the slides to a
second disk which we can occupy the whole of. We’ll have the Cat format
it, then promptly overwrite it with our own data. The <tt>rtrk</tt> and
<tt>wtrk</tt> words will load or save an entire track of data (5120
bytes) to or from a given memory address, so we will have each picture
occupy 28896 bytes divided by 5120 bytes per track to equal 5.64375
tracks, i.e., six tracks apiece rounded up. This is a little inefficient
for the last portion of the display but we’re optimizing for speed here.
<p>
<p>If we’re going to ask for a new disk, we should do so with style, so
this will be our screenshot image. C’mon, he’s the original father of
the Mac too!</p>

<p>We will blink the question mark until the disk is switched, as a
classic Mac would do, then draw the original
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_startup#Happy_Mac">Happy
Mac</a> over it and proceed with the slides. Here they are, largely
extracted from contemporary marketing material, then edited in Krita and
Floyd-Steinberg dithered with ImageMagick. Any blurriness in these grabs
is due to the upscaling I did to match the CRT aspect ratio; they are

I then used <tt>catrpic</tt> from the first hack to extract it and added
it to the pile as the final image.
<p>
To create the slides, after having the Cat format a blank disk, we’ll
transmit the bitmap data via the serial port. This is binary safe
<em>if</em> we disable XON/XOFF first, or otherwise the Cat will
intercept and act on those characters. For example, this snippet at the
<tt>ok</tt> prompt will wait for data from the serial port and read
28896 bytes from it, spewing them to the screen directly. We assume your
serial port is still configured for “SEND Command/Full Duplex” at
9600bps, 8-N-1.
<p>
<div class="tx">
<pre>
ser.xon.tx.off page 4070e0 400000 do ser.rx i c! loop key drop
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Then send the 28896-byte raw bitmap data (in our case, the scaled and
dithered PBM with the PBM header removed) with something like
<tt>sendfile /dev/ttyUSB0 9600 image.cat</tt> — no intercharacter delay
is necessary as this loop will have no problem keeping up. Note that we
use <tt>ser.xon.tx.off</tt> to disable acting on <em>received</em>
XON/XOFF characters, but actually fetch characters with <tt>ser.rx</tt>
(which will wait for a byte to be ready). Once all bytes are loaded, it
will wait for a key, and then stop.
<p>
<p>We’ll test it <s>on Captain Solo</s> by writing out a track and
trying to read it back.</p>

We turn off XON/XOFF for receive, load the image, then write out six
tracks at the given addresses (5 overlaps slightly with 4). The six dots
at the end report out the status of each track write with <tt>wtrk</tt>.
<p>
<p>Don’t get those arguments transposed to these track read/write
routines, by the way. The operating system <em>will</em> try to seek to
track 4194304, causing the head to repeatedly hit the outside rail and
possibly damage itself! There is no bounds checking on these

Unlike every other graphic image in the demo, however, we’ll draw the
Happy Mac from an internal set of bitmap values instead of trying to
fetch it from disk as well. Here I’m messing with the positioning to
determine the best addresses to blink the question mark and where
onscreen the Happy Mac should be loaded. Eventually I settled on the
following, which is the entirety of the demo source code in Forth:

<p>
This is all pushed over the serial link and parsed into words on the Cat
using the same process as before.
<p>
The main code starts with <tt>slideshow</tt> where we first make sure
all updates go direct to the screen. After that, the <tt>diskwait</tt>
word is what waits for the state changes of the floppy. It has its own
routines for erasing and redrawing the blinking question mark. This word
takes the token of another word as an argument which it calls to
determine whether the desired condition is satisfied, so we call it
first with <tt>diskwaitout</tt> to wait for the first disk to be
removed, then <tt>diskwaitin</tt> to wait for the second disk to be
inserted. These words directly manipulate the floppy drive through Gate
Array #3 by briefly turning it on to check for the disk, then waiting
for a settling period after the motor starts to get the disk status
back. The question mark is encoded as a series of literal words pushed
onto the stack in reverse order so they get pulled off in the right
order for the loop.
<p>
With the next disk in, the <tt>recal</tt> word seeks for track zero and
returns 0 for success or an error code for failure. Assuming it can find
it, it draws the Happy Mac (with whole 32-bit words this time but using
the same principle), primes the keyboard, and starts with the first
picture, the Shocked Mac. The <tt>trackpic</tt> word loads the six-track
image and waits for a keypress in a given timeframe, cold-starting the
Cat if the UNDO key is pressed. The cold start process will of course
try to read the disk, but it won’t be recognized as a Cat floppy and
will be ignored, thus putting the user back into the editor.
<p>
This does give the floppy drive quite a workout. You’ll notice that the
Shocked Mac appears only the very first time it boots and never in the
loop after that, and it’s because I think my floppy drive has a marginal
track zero switch (at the age these drives are, I suspect other
otherwise-working Cat drives have a similar problem). This switch
appears to be mechanical on the Canon drive rather than the more typical
LED/sensor combination. More times than not this particular disk drive
could get back to track zero, but sometimes it wouldn’t, which explains
why some of my reads from disks the Cat wrote started on physical track
two even though the Cat’s firmware obviously believed it was writing
track zero. It doesn’t seem like an alignment problem with the switch or
the drive because when it <em>does</em> find track zero, it reads disks
written by the Teac (our “perfectly aligned” brand spanking new floppy
drive) just fine, and obviously it’s also able to write track zero more
often than not or this demo might not have been possible.
<p>
Accordingly, the problem I ran into with this hack was the drive
couldn’t reliably get back to track zero after the last picture either
(it’s over 60 tracks away by then). If this happens to you in the
editor, you can just try reading the disk again until it “gets it.” But
here <tt>rtrk</tt> will pause waiting patiently for the correct track to
come by, which probably won’t happen for the good minute or so it waits
until it times out. Trying to manually step the head back in track by
track didn’t really help. The best solution was just to start back over
on track 6 instead of track 0, and that seemed to work generally okay,
though this is probably not a demo you want to leave running repeatedly
on the Cat regardless.
<p>
<p>Here’s the finished product. Both disk images are
<a href="https://github.com/classilla/catbox/tree/main/examples/slideshow">in
the Catbox</a>.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" webkitallowfullscreen="webkitallowfullscreen" mozallowfullscreen="mozallowfullscreen" width="320" height="266" src="https://www.blogger.com/video.g?token=AD6v5dx6LLdx0jxPuhDZR4Yf-wsPKT6MwGm98A-3AiqyAd2sAphNvJZNuDZvmKGzJD835dOdR2uFMk0EsyphkMyflw" class="b-hbp-video b-uploaded" frameborder="0">
</iframe>
</div>
This hack brings you the final iteration of
<a href="https://github.com/classilla/catbox/blob/main/catcpic"><tt>catcpic</tt></a>,
which now is a three-headed application. It requires your original eDSK
and a properly formatted and inverted PBM, generates a nice randomized
idtable so that your Cat can’t confuse it with anything else (though you
can pass it one in hex with <tt>-idtable=…</tt> if you want) and emits
the resulting disk image to standard output. If you don’t pass it a
token in hex, it will install the “press any key” patch; if you do, and
you specify <tt>-cold</tt>, you’ll get a cold booter; otherwise you’ll
get a autostarter that will enable you to cleanly return to the editor.
<p>
To compensate for the situation where your Cat’s drive might also be
acting up and not truly writing to track zero either, I’ve also included
<a href="https://github.com/classilla/catbox/blob/main/optedsk">an eDSK
optimizer tool</a>. It will remove and properly relocate unformatted
tracks, or even formatted tracks before the detected idtrack if you use
<tt>-force</tt>, adjusting the eDSK DIB and TIBs and emitting the
corrected disk image to standard output. You can also just say
<tt>-test</tt> to see what it thinks about a particular image (<tt>-test
-force</tt> will make it continue even if it doesn’t think the disk is a
Cat disk).
<p>
<h3>
Things to do
</h3>
<p>
Some considerations for <a href="/search/label/canon">a future
entry</a>:
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Figure out how to lash something like a Gotek floppy emulator to the Cat
because I’m not sure how much more life this disk drive’s got in it. The
idea should be along the lines of building one of the adapters that let
you use a PC floppy drive, but then plug an emulator into it instead.
<li>
Fix for v2.4x ROMs, which some Cat enthusiasts run now, but that would
require me to modify my Cat to do so, which I’m not entirely willing to
do without a good reason. I’ll take patches, though.
<li>
A proper set of games for the Cat. How about a text adventure played in
the editor?
<li>
Audio demo? The <tt>tone</tt> and related words for playing audio tones
documented in the tForth manual are not in the 1.74 ROM. There is a
<tt>beep</tt> word which twiddles with the DUART, but it’s not clear if
it only beeps or can be made to play other tones.
<li>
uCLinux? If a Palm Pilot can run it …
<li>
Write shorter blog posts? (Nah.)

id="americas-pioneering-sex-therapist-dr.-ruth-westheimer-dies-at-96">America’s
pioneering sex therapist Dr. Ruth Westheimer dies at 96</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Dr. Ruth Westheimer, the diminutive sex therapist who
became a pop icon, media star and best-selling author through her frank
talk about once-taboo bedroom topics, has died. She was 96.</p>
<p>Westheimer died on Friday at her home in New York City, surrounded by
her family, according to publicist and friend Pierre Lehu.</p>
<p>Westheimer never advocated risky sexual behavior. Instead, she
encouraged an open dialogue on previously closeted issues that affected
her audience of millions. Her one recurring theme was that there was
nothing to be ashamed of.</p>
<p>“I still hold old-fashioned values, and I’m a bit of a square,” she
told students at Michigan City High School in 2002. “Sex is a private
art and a private matter. But still, it is a subject we must talk
about.”</p>
<p>Westheimer’s giggly, German-accented voice, coupled with her 4-foot-7
frame, made her an unlikely looking — and sounding — outlet for “sexual
literacy.” The contradiction was one of the keys to her success.</p>
<p>But it was her extensive knowledge and training, coupled with her
humorous, nonjudgmental manner, that catapulted her local radio program,
“Sexually Speaking,” into the national spotlight in the early 1980s. She
had a nonjudgmental approach to what two consenting adults did in the
privacy of their home.</p>
<p>Her radio success opened new doors, and in 1983 she wrote the first
of more than 40 books: “Dr. Ruth’s Guide to Good Sex,” demystifying sex
with rationality and humor. There was even a board game, Dr. Ruth’s Game
of Good Sex.</p>
<p>She soon became a regular on the late-night television talk-show
circuit, bringing her personality to the national stage. Her rise
coincided with the early days of the AIDS epidemic, when frank sexual
talk became a necessity.</p>
<p>“If we could bring about talking about sexual activity the way we
talk about diet — the way we talk about food — without it having this
kind of connotation that there’s something not right about it, then we
would be a step further. But we have to do it with good taste,” she told
Johnny Carson in 1982.</p>
<p>She normalized the use of words such as “penis” and “vagina” on radio
and TV, aided by her Jewish grandmotherly accent, which The Wall Street
Journal once said was “a cross between Henry Kissinger and Minnie
Mouse.” People magazine included her in their list of “The Most
Intriguing People of the Century.”</p>
<p>Westheimer defended abortion rights, suggested older people have sex
after a good night’s sleep and was an outspoken advocate of condom use.
She believed in monogamy.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, she stood up for gay men at the height of the AIDS
epidemic and spoke out loudly for the LGBTQ community. She said she
defended people deemed by some far-right Christians to be “subhuman”
because of her own past.</p>
<p>Born Karola Ruth Siegel in Frankfurt, Germany, in 1928, she was an
only child. At 10, she was sent by her parents to Switzerland to escape
Kristallnacht — the Nazis’ 1938 pogrom that served as a precursor to the
Holocaust. She never saw her parents again; Westheimer believed they
were killed in the gas chambers at Auschwitz.</p>
<p>At the age of 16, she moved to Palestine and joined the Haganah, the
underground movement for Israeli independence. She was trained as a
sniper, although she said she never shot at anyone.</p>
<p>Her legs were severely wounded when a bomb exploded in her dormitory,
killing many of her friends. She said it was only through the work of a
“superb” surgeon that she could walk and ski again.</p>
<p>She married her first husband, an Israeli soldier, in 1950, and they
moved to Paris as she pursued an education. Although not a high school
graduate, Westheimer was accepted into the Sorbonne to study psychology
after passing an entrance exam.</p>
<p>The marriage ended in 1955; the next year, Westheimer went to New
York with her new boyfriend, a Frenchman who became her second husband
and father to her daughter, Miriam.</p>
<p>In 1961, after a second divorce, she finally met her life partner:
Manfred Westheimer, a fellow refugee from Nazi Germany. The couple was
married and had a son, Joel. They remained wed for 36 years until “Fred”
— as she called him — died of heart failure in 1997.</p>
<p>After receiving her doctorate in education from Columbia University,
she went on to teach at Lehman College in the Bronx. While there she
developed a specialty — instructing professors how to teach sex
education. It would eventually become the core of her curriculum.</p>
<p>“I soon realized that while I knew enough about education, I did not
really know enough about sex,” she wrote in her 1987 autobiography.
Westheimer then decided take classes with the renowned sex therapist,
Dr. Helen Singer Kaplan.</p>
<p>It was there that she had discovered her calling. Soon, as she once
said in a typically folksy comment, she was dispensing sexual advice
“like good chicken soup.”</p>
<p>In 1984, her radio program was nationally syndicated. A year later,
she debuted in her own television program, “The Dr. Ruth Show,” which
went on to win an Ace Award for excellence in cable television.</p>
<p>She also wrote a nationally syndicated advice column and later
appeared in a line of videos produced by Playboy, preaching the virtues
of open sexual discourse and good sex. She even had her own board game,
“Dr. Ruth’s Game of Good Sex,” and a series of calendars.</p>
<p>Her rise was noteworthy for the culture of the time, in which
then-President Ronald Reagan’s administration was hostile to Planned
Parenthood and aligned with conservative voices.</p>

id="irans-pezeshkian-vows-balance-with-all-countries-warns-us-against-pressure">Iran’s
Pezeshkian vows balance with all countries, warns US against
pressure</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>TEHRAN, Iran — Iran’s newly elected president said his government
will create “balance in relations with all countries” in line with
national interests and the prerequisites for peace but stressed to the
United States that his country “will not respond to pressure.”</p>
<p>Masoud Pezeshkian penned “My Message To The New World” in the
country’s state-owned Tehran Times late Friday, praising the latest
presidential election that “demonstrated remarkable stability” and
vowing to uphold “promises I made during my campaign.”</p>
<p>Pezeshkian, a 69-year-old heart surgeon and longtime lawmaker, bested
hard-liner former nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili to clinch the July 5
runoff election to replace President Ebrahim Raisi, who was killed in a
helicopter crash in May.</p>
<p>He said in his message his administration would “prioritize
strengthening relations with our neighbors” and urged Arab countries to
use “all diplomatic leverages” to push for a lasting cease-fire in the
ongoing Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip that started October 7.</p>
<p>Iran has long supported the militant group Hamas, and Pezeshkian on
Wednesday expressed his all-out support of “the Palestinian resistance”
in a message to the group’s chief, Ismail Haniyeh.</p>
<p>Pezeshkian, in the letter Friday, hailed his country’s relations with
Russia and China, which “consistently stood by us during challenging
times.” He said Moscow was “a valued strategic ally” and his government
would expand bilateral cooperation. He also expressed willingness to
“support initiatives aimed at” achieving peace between Russia and
Ukraine in the ongoing war.</p>
<p>The president also said he looked forward to furthering cooperation
with Beijing and applauded it for brokering a deal to normalize
relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia after seven years of diplomatic
tensions.</p>
<p>Pezeshkian said he looks forward to engaging in constructive dialogue
with European countries “based on principles of mutual respect” despite
a relationship that has known “its ups and downs.”</p>
<p>In May 2018, the U.S. unilaterally withdrew from the Joint
Comprehensive Plan of Action — a nuclear agreement that also included
Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany. Since then, Western powers
have accused the Islamic Republic of expanding its nuclear program and
enriching uranium to an unprecedented 60% level, near-weapons-grade
levels. The U.S. has issued severe, mainly economic, sanctions against
Iran.</p>
<p>Pezeshkian accused the European countries of reneging on commitments
made, following the U.S. withdrawal, to ensure “effective banking
transactions, effective protection of companies from U.S. sanctions, and
the promotion of investments in Iran.” However, he added there were
still many opportunities for collaboration between Iran and Europe.</p>
<p>He then addressed the U.S., underscoring his country’s refusal to
“respond to pressure,” adding that Iran “entered the JCPOA in 2015 in
good faith and fully met our obligations.” Pezeshkian said the U.S.
backing out has inflicted “hundreds of billions of dollars in damage to
our economy” and caused “untold suffering, death and destruction on the
Iranian people — particularly during the COVID pandemic” due to
sanctions.</p>
<p>Pezeshkian said Western countries “not only missed a historic
opportunity to reduce and manage tensions in the region and the world,
but also seriously undermined the Non-Proliferation Treaty.” He
emphasized that “Iran’s defense doctrine does not include nuclear
weapons.”</p>
<p>Iran has held indirect talks with U.S. President Joe Biden’s
administration, although there’s been no clear movement toward
constraining Tehran’s nuclear program for the lifting of economic
sanctions.</p>
<p>Pezeshkian also accused the U.S. administration in his open letter of
escalating “hostilities” by assassinating General Qassem Soleimani, the
architect of Iran’s regional military activities, who was killed in a
U.S. drone strike in neighboring Iraq in 2020.</p>
<p>Besides regional turmoil and tense relations over Iran’s nuclear
program, Iran’s president faces many challenges locally. He must now
convince an angry public — many under financial duress due to sanctions,
stubbornly high inflation and unemployment — that he can make the
changes promised while dealing with an administration still largely
governed by hard-liners.</p>
<p>Pezeshkian has aligned himself with other moderate and reformist
figures since his presidential campaign. His main advocate has been
former Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, who reached the 2015
JCPOA. Pezeshkian appointed Zarif as the head of the Strategic Council
for the administration’s transition period. The council, comprised of
experts and advisers, will focus on assessing potential candidates for
key cabinet positions and ensuring a seamless handover of
leadership.</p>

voters could be a sweet spot for Biden in November</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden’s halting performance at last month’s
presidential debate triggered questions about the president’s age and
ability to serve another four years. One group of voters that might
empathize with the president’s plight are older people. Historically,
people over 65 are the most reliable bloc of voters in presidential
elections. VOA’s Dora Mekouar reports. VOA footage by Adam

bolsters Arctic defense in face of Russian, Chinese aggression</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Toronto, Canada — Canada says it is going shopping for 12
conventionally powered submarines capable of operating under the Arctic
ice to enhance maritime security in a region that is fast gaining
strategic significance in the face of climate change.</p>
<p>The purchase is expected to help ease mounting pressure on Ottawa —
one of the lowest-spending NATO members — to meet the alliance’s
commitment to spend 2% of GDP on defense.</p>
<p>“As the country with the longest coastline in the world, Canada needs
a new fleet of submarines,” Canadian Defense Minister Bill Blair said in
a statement Wednesday as NATO leaders were meeting in Washington.</p>
<p>The ministry said it has begun meeting with manufacturers and will
formally invite bids for the sale in the fall.</p>
<p>“Canada’s key submarine capability requirements will be stealth,
lethality, persistence and Arctic deployability — meaning that the
submarine must have extended range and endurance,” the statement
said.</p>
<p>“Canada’s new fleet will need to provide a unique combination of
these requirements to ensure that Canada can detect, track, deter and,
if necessary, defeat adversaries in all three of Canada’s oceans while
contributing meaningfully alongside allies and enabling the government
of Canada to deploy this fleet abroad in support of our partners and
allies.”</p>
<p>A day later in Washington, Canada, the United States and Finland
issued a joint statement announcing an agreement to build icebreakers
for the Arctic region.</p>
<p>The pact calls for enhanced information sharing on polar icebreaker
production, allowing for workers and experts from each country to train
in shipyards across all three, and promoting to allies the purchase of
polar icebreakers from American, Finnish or Canadian shipyards for their
own needs, The Associated Press reported.</p>
<p>The AP quoted Daleep Singh, the White House deputy national security
adviser for international economics, saying the agreement would
demonstrate to Russia and China that the U.S. and allies will “doggedly
pursue collaboration on industrial policy to increase our competitive
edge.”</p>
<p>Singh noted that the U.S. has two icebreakers, and both are nearing
the end of their usable life. Finland has 12 icebreakers and Canada has
nine, while Russia has 36, according to U.S. Coast Guard data.</p>
<p>The same day in Washington, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau
announced that his government had signed “a trilateral letter of intent
with Germany and Norway to establish a strategic partnership aimed at
strengthening maritime security cooperation in the North Atlantic in
support of NATO’s deterrence and defense.”</p>
<p>Trudeau also said for the first time that Canada expects to reach
NATO’s 2% of GDP spending target by 2032. Canada also pledged $367
million in new military aid to Ukraine ahead of a meeting Wednesday
between Trudeau and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.</p>
<p>The commitments come in the face of mounting pressure for Canada to
spend more on defense. A founding member of NATO, it is the alliance’s
fifth-lowest spending member relative to GDP and until this week had
pledged only to spend 1.76% of GDP by the 2029-30 budget year.</p>
<p>In a speech Monday, U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Mike
Johnson called Canada’s level of defense spending “shameful.” Senate
Republican leader Mitch McConnell posted, “It’s time for our northern
ally to invest seriously.”</p>
<p>NATO allies first agreed to the 2% defense spending threshold in 2006
and reaffirmed it in 2014 and 2023. This year, 23 of the 32 member
states will meet or exceed that target.</p>
<p>Several nations have been stepping up their military and commercial
capabilities in the Arctic as the receding ice pack makes navigation and
petrochemical exploration in the Arctic Ocean more practicable. A sea
route across Russia’s Arctic coastline promises to provide a shorter sea
route between China and Europe.</p>
<p>Despite China’s distance from the Arctic Ocean, Beijing has dubbed
itself a “near-Arctic country” to try to stake a bigger claim in the
region.</p>

id="us-sanctions-venezuela-gang-for-spreading-criminal-activity-across-latin-america">US
sanctions Venezuela gang for spreading criminal activity across Latin
America</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MIAMI — The Biden administration on Thursday sanctioned a Venezuelan
gang allegedly behind a spree of kidnappings, extortion and other
violent crimes tied to migrants that have spread across Latin America
and the United States.</p>
<p>The U.S. also offered a $12 million reward for the arrest of three
leaders of Tren de Aragua, which now joins the MS-13 gang from El
Salvador and the Mafia-styled Camorra from Italy on a list of
transnational criminal organizations banned from doing business in the
U.S.</p>
<p>“Tren de Aragua poses a deadly criminal threat across the region,”
the U.S. Treasury Department said in a statement, adding that it often
preys on vulnerable populations such as migrant women and girls for sex
trafficking.</p>
<p>“When victims seek to escape this exploitation, Tren de Aragua
members often kill them and publicize their deaths as a threat to
others,” the statement added.</p>
<p>The Tren de Aragua traces its origins to more than a decade ago, to
an infamously lawless prison in the central state of Aragua where a
number of hardened criminals were held. But it has expanded in recent
years as millions of desperate Venezuelans fled President Nicolás
Maduro’s rule and migrated to other parts of Latin America or the
U.S.</p>
<p>Authorities in countries such as Colombia, Peru and Ecuador — with
large populations of Venezuelan migrants — have accused the group of
being behind a spree of violent crimes in a region that has long had
some of the highest murder rates in the world.</p>
<p>Initially its focus was exploiting Venezuelan migrants through loan
sharking, human trafficking and the smuggling of contraband goods to and
from Venezuela.</p>
<p>But as the Venezuelan diaspora has settled more permanently abroad,
it has joined — and sometimes clashed — with homegrown criminal
syndicates engaged in drug trafficking, extortion of local businesses
and murders for hire.</p>
<p>Among the groups the Treasury Department said the gang has teamed up
with is Primeiro Comando da Capital, a notorious organized crime group
out of Brazil that has also been sanctioned by the U.S.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, prosecutors in Chile blamed the gang, whose name
means “train” in Spanish, for the killing of a Venezuelan army official
who had sought refuge in that country after partaking in a failed plot
to overthrow Maduro.</p>
<p>“The Tren de Aragua is not a vertically integrated criminal
structure, but rather a federation of different gangs,” said Jeremy
McDermott, the Colombia-based co-director of InSight Crime, which this
month published a report on the gang’s expansion.</p>
<p>“It has now become a franchise name for Venezuelan criminal
structures operating in the region, with weakening coherence now that
its home prison base is no more,” McDermott said.</p>
<p>The group is led by Hector Guerrero, who was jailed years ago for
killing a police officer, according to InSight Crime. Guerrero, better
known by his alias El Nino, or Spanish for “the boy,” later escaped and
then was recaptured in 2013, returning to the prison in Aragua where the
criminal enterprise was then headquartered.</p>
<p>He fled prison again more recently, as Venezuelan authorities tried
to reassert control over its prison population.</p>
<p>His current whereabouts are unknown but the U.S. State Department,
which has offered up to $12 million for his arrest and that of two other
gang leaders, said it believes Guerrero and Giovanny San Vicente,
another target of the U.S. bounty, are believed to be living in
Colombia.</p>
<p>Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican who co-chairs the Senate
Select Committee on Intelligence, has warned that if left unchecked, the
Tren de Aragua could also start terrorizing American cities.</p>
<p>Among the nearly 1 million Venezuelan migrants that have crossed into
the U.S. in recent years are suspected gang members tied to police
shootings, human trafficking and other crimes although there’s no
evidence that the gang has set up an organizational structure in the
U.S., McDermott said.</p>
<p>“Now we are seeing evidence that they have made it into the United
States. Every single day, we’re seeing reports from Chicago, South
Florida, and New York that these gang members are here,” Rubio said at a
Senate hearing in April.</p>
<p>The White House, in a statement on Thursday, said the Department of
Homeland Security has implemented enhanced screening to vet and better
identify known or suspected gang members, including Tren de Aragua
members.</p>
<p>Maduro’s government has accused opponents of exaggerating the reach
of Tren de Aragua to tarnish its reputation and said that authorities
dismantled the group last year when security forces retook control of
the prison that had served as its hub of illicit activity.</p>
<p>Hours after the U.S. sanctioned the gang, the government announced
that a brother of the gang’s leader, who was arrested in Barcelona
earlier this year, arrived home pursuant to a Venezuelan extradition
request to Spain.</p>
<p>Attorney General Tarek William Saab said that Gerso Guerrero, who was
arrested earlier this year in Barcelona, faces up to 30 years in prison
— the maximum in Venezuela — on multiple criminal charges including
extortion, money laundering, weapons trafficking and terrorism.</p>

I veteran is first Tulsa Race Massacre victim identified from mass
graves</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>OKLAHOMA CITY — A World War I veteran is the first person identified
from graves filled with more than a hundred victims of the 1921 Tulsa
Race Massacre that devastated the city’s Black community, the mayor said
Friday.</p>
<p>Using DNA from descendants of his brothers, the remains of C.L.
Daniel from Georgia were identified by Intermountain Forensics, said
Mayor G.T. Bynum and officials from the lab. He was in his 20s when he
was killed.</p>
<p>“This is one family who gets to give a member of their family that
they lost a proper burial, after not knowing where they were for over a
century,” Bynum said.</p>
<p>A white mob massacred as many as many as 300 Black people over the
span of two days in 1921, a long-suppressed episode of racial violence
that destroyed a thriving community known as Black Wall Street and ended
with thousands of Black residents forced into internment camps overseen
by the National Guard.</p>
<p>Brenda Nails-Alford, a descendant of massacre survivors and a member
of the committee overseeing the search for victims, said the
identification brought her to tears.</p>
<p>“This is an awesome day, a day that has taken forever to come to
fruition,” Nails-Alford said.</p>
<p>More than 120 graves were found during searches that began in 2020,
with forensic analysis and DNA collected from about 30 sets of remains.
Daniel’s remains are the first from those graves to be linked directly
to the massacre.</p>
<p>The breakthrough for identifying Daniel came when investigators found
a 1936 letter from his mother’s attorney seeking veteran’s benefits.
Alison Wilde, a forensic scientist with Salt Lake City-based
Intermountain Forensics, said the letter provided by the National
Archives convinced investigators that Daniel was killed in the
massacre.</p>
<p>No members of Daniel’s family, many of whom don’t know each other,
attended the news conference announcing the identification, which was
made earlier this week, Wilde said.</p>
<p>“I think it’s shocking news, to say the least” for the family, Wilde
said. “We know we’ve brought a lot into their lives.”</p>
<p>The massacre began when a white mob, including some deputized by
authorities, looted and burned Tulsa’s Greenwood District. More than
1,200 homes, businesses, schools and churches were destroyed from May
31-June 1.</p>
<p>Forensic anthropologist Phoebe Stubblefield said Daniel’s remains
were fragmented and a cause of death could not be determined.</p>
<p>“We didn’t see any sign of gunshot wounds, but if the bullet doesn’t
hit bone or isn’t retained within the body, how would we detect it?”</p>
<p>Oklahoma state archaeologist Kary Stackelbeck said the remains that
were exhumed, including Daniel, were found in simple wooden boxes — and
Daniel’s was too small for him.</p>
<p>“They had to bend his legs somewhat at the knee in order to get him
to fit,” Stackelbeck said. “His head and his feet both touched either
end of the casket.”</p>
<p>Stackelbeck said investigators were searching for simple caskets
because they were described in newspaper articles at the time, death
certificates, and funeral home records as the type used for burials of
massacre victims.</p>
<p>Bynum said the next search for victims will begin July 22.</p>
<p>“We’ll continue the search until we find everybody that we can,”
Bynum said.</p>
<p>A lawsuit by the two known living survivors of the massacre was
dismissed by the Oklahoma Supreme Court in June.</p>
<p>Attorneys for the two, Viola Fletcher, 110, and Lessie Benningfield
Randle, 109, are asking the court to reconsider the decision. Attorneys
are also asking the U.S. Department of Justice to open an investigation
into the massacre under the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act
of 2007, which allows for the reopening of cold cases of violent crimes
against Black people committed before 1970.</p>

<h2 id="us-grocery-stores-add-ammo-to-vending-machines">US grocery
stores add ammo to vending machines</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MONTGOMERY, Ala. — A company has installed computerized vending
machines to sell ammunition in grocery stores in Alabama, Oklahoma and
Texas, allowing patrons to pick up bullets along with a gallon of
milk.</p>
<p>American Rounds said their machines use an identification scanner and
facial recognition software to verify the purchaser’s age and are as
“quick and easy” to use as a computer tablet. But advocates worry that
selling bullets out of vending machines will lead to more shootings in
the U.S., where gun violence killed at least 33 people on Independence
Day alone.</p>
<p>The company maintains the age-verification technology means that the
transactions are as secure, or more secure, than online sales, which may
not require the purchaser to submit proof of age, or at retail stores,
where there is a risk of shoplifting.</p>
<p>“I’m very thankful for those who are taking the time to get to know
us and not just making assumptions about what we’re about,” CEO Grant
Magers said. “We are very pro-Second Amendment, but we are for
responsible gun ownership, and we hope we’re improving the environment
for the community.”</p>
<p>There have been 15 mass killings involving a firearm so far in 2024,
compared to 39 in 2023, according to a database maintained in a
partnership of The Associated Press, USA Today and Northeastern
University.</p>
<p>“Innovations that make ammunition sales more secure via facial
recognition, age verification, and the tracking of serial sales are
promising safety measures that belong in gun stores, not in the place
where you buy your kids milk,” said Nick Suplina, senior vice president
for law and policy at Everytown for Gun Safety. “In a country awash in
guns and ammo, where guns are the leading cause of deaths for kids, we
don’t need to further normalize the sale and promotion of these
products.”</p>
<p>Magers said grocery stores and others approached the Texas-based
company, which began in 2023, about the idea of selling ammunition
through automated technology. The company has one machine in Alabama,
four in Oklahoma and one in Texas, with plans for another in Texas and
one in Colorado in the coming weeks, he said.</p>
<p>“People I think got shocked when they thought about the idea of
selling ammo at a grocery store,” Magers said. “But as we explained, how
is that any different than Walmart?”</p>
<p>Federal law requires a person to be 18 to buy shotgun and rifle
ammunition and 21 to buy handgun ammunition. Magers said their machines
require a purchaser to be at least 21.</p>
<p>The machine works by requiring a customer to scan their driver’s
license to validate that they are age 21 or older. The scan also checks
that it is a valid license, he said. That is followed by a facial
recognition scan to verify “you are who you are saying you are as a
consumer,” he said.</p>
<p>“At that point you can complete your transaction of your product and
you’re off and going,” he said. “The whole experience takes a minute and
a half once you are familiar with the machine.”</p>
<p>The vending machine is another method of sale, joining retail stores
and online retailers. A March report by Everytown for Gun Safety found
that several major online ammunition retailers did not appear to verify
their customers’ ages, despite requirements.</p>
<p>Last year, an online retailer settled a lawsuit brought by families
of those killed and injured in a 2018 Texas high school shooting. The
families said the 17-year-old shooter was able to buy ammunition from
the retailer who failed to verify his age.</p>
<p>Vending machines for bullets or other age-restricted materials is not
an entirely new idea. Companies have developed similar technology to
sell alcoholic beverages. A company has marketed automated kiosks to
sell cannabis products in dispensaries in states where marijuana is
legal.</p>
<p>A Pennsylvania police officer created a company about 12 years ago
that places bullet-vending machines in private gun clubs and ranges as a
convenience for patrons. Those machines do not have the age verification
mechanism but are only placed in locations with an age requirement to
enter, Master Ammo owner Sam Piccinini said.</p>
<p>Piccinini spoke with a company years ago about incorporating the
artificial intelligence technology to verify a purchaser’s age and
identity, but at the time it was cost-prohibitive, he said. For American
Rounds, one machine had to be removed from a site in Tuscaloosa,
Alabama, because of disappointing sales, Magers said.</p>
<p>Magers said much of the early interest for the machines has been in
rural communities where there may be few retailers that sell ammunition.
The American Rounds machines are in Super C Mart and Fresh Value grocery
stores in small cities, including Pell City, Alabama, which has a
population over 13,600, and Noble, Oklahoma, where nearly 7,600 people
live.</p>
<p>“Someone in that community might have to drive an hour or an hour and
a half to get supplied if they want to go hunting, for instance,”
Margers said. “Our grocery stores, they wanted to be able to offer their
customer another category that they felt like would be popular.”</p>

id="in-swing-state-pennsylvania-latino-majority-city-embraces-chance-to-sway-2024-election">In
swing-state Pennsylvania, Latino-majority city embraces chance to sway
2024 election</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>READING, PA — Religion and politics frequently overlap in Reading, an
old industrial city in one of the most pivotal swing states of this
year’s presidential election.</p>
<p>In Pennsylvania, there is early precedent for this kind of thing. The
state began as a haven for Quakers and other European religious
minorities fleeing persecution. That includes the parents of Daniel
Boone, the national folk hero born just miles from Reading, a town where
the Latino population is now the majority.</p>
<p>Today, the Catholic mayor is also a migrant — and the first Latino to
hold the office in Reading’s 276-year history. Mayor Eddie Moran is
keenly aware of the pivotal role Pennsylvania could play in the
high-stakes race, when a few thousand votes in communities like his
could decide the future of the United States.</p>
<p>“Right now, with the growing Latino population and the influx of
Latinos moving into cities such as Reading, it’s definitely an
opportunity for the Latino vote to change the outcome of an election,”
Moran says. “It’s not a secret anymore.”</p>
<p>A community of spirituality — and Latinos</p>
<p>In Reading, the sky is dotted with crosses atop church steeples, one
after the other. Catholic church pews fill up on Sundays and many stand
for the services. Elsewhere, often in nondescript buildings, evangelical
and Pentecostal congregations gather to sing, pray and sometimes speak
in tongues.</p>
<p>Outside, salsa, merengue and reggaeton music (often sung in
Spanglish) blast from cars and houses along city streets first mapped
out by William Penn’s sons — and that now serve a thriving downtown
packed with restaurants proudly owned by Latinos.</p>
<p>This is a place where, when the mayor is told that his town is 65%
Latino, he takes pride in saying: “It’s more like 70%.”</p>
<p>They believe in their political sway. A Pew Research Center survey
conducted in 2022 found that eight in 10 Latino registered voters say
their vote can affect the country’s direction at least “some.”</p>
<p>On a recent Sunday, Luis Hernandez, 65, born in Puerto Rico, knelt to
pray near the altar at St. Peter the Apostle Catholic Church. Later,
walking out after Mass, Hernandez said he’ll vote for Trump — even on
the very day of the former president’s criminal convictions related to
hush money for a porn star.</p>
<p>“Biden is old,” Hernandez says, and then reflects on how Trump is
only a few years younger. “Yes, but you look at Trump and you see the
difference. … Biden’s a good man. He’s decent. But he’s too old.”</p>
<p>In the weeks after he spoke, many more Americans would join in calls
for Biden to withdraw from the race after his debate debacle, which
crystallized growing concerns that, at 81, he’s too old.</p>
<p>Immigration is a key topic</p>
<p>It’s not just about Biden’s age or debate performance. It’s also,
Hernandez says, about the border crisis. He says too many immigrants are
arriving in the United States, including some he considers criminals.
And, he adds, so much has changed since his Dominican-born father
arrived in the 1960s — when, he says, it was easier to enter and stay in
America.</p>
<p>For some, there are other issues as well.</p>
<p>“It’s the economy, immigration and abortion,” says German Vega, 41, a
Dominican American who became a U.S. citizen in 2015. Vega, who
describes himself as “pro-life,” voted for Trump in 2020 and plans to do
so again in November.</p>
<p>“Biden doesn’t know what he’s saying. He doesn’t know what he’s
doing, and we have a country divided,” Vega says. Trump is “a person of
character. … He looks confident. He never gives up; he’s always fighting
for what he believes.”</p>
<p>Of course, there are some here who just don’t favor taking sides —
except if it’s for Jesus. Listen to Pastor Alex Lopez, a Puerto Rican
who cuts hair in a barber shop on the first floor of his home on
Saturdays, and preaches on the second floor on Sundays.</p>
<p>“We’re neutral,” he says. “We just believe in God.”</p>
<p>A city with deep industrial roots resurges</p>
<p>Reading was once synonymous with iron and steel. Those industries
cemented the creation of the Reading Railroad (an early stop on the
Monopoly gameboard) that helped fuel the Industrial Revolution and
became, in the late 19th century, one of the country’s major
corporations.</p>
<p>Today, the city of about 95,000 people, 65 miles northwest of
Philadelphia, has a fast-increasing population. However, it is one of
the state’s poorest cities, with a median household income of about
$44,000, compared to about $72,000 in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Reading is 67% Latino, according to U.S. Census figures, and home to
high concentrations of people of Dominican and Puerto Rican heritage —
as well as Colombians and Mexicans, who own restaurants and other
businesses around town.</p>
<p>Political candidates are taking notice of Reading’s political and
economic power. The 2020 presidential election in Pennsylvania was
decided by about 82,000 votes, and — according to the Pew Research
Center — there are more than 600,000 eligible Latino voters in the
state.</p>
<p>It’s true that Reading still leans mostly Democratic — Biden crushed
Trump in the city by a margin of about 46 percentage points in 2020.
However in that election, voting-age turnout in the city (about 35%) was
significantly lower than the rest of the state (about 67%).</p>
<p>But the Trump campaign doesn’t want to miss out on the opportunity to
turn it around. It recently teamed up with the Republican National
Committee and Pennsylvania GOP to open a “Latino Americans for Trump”
office in a red-brick building near the Democratic mayor’s downtown
office.</p>
<p>Moran has made a plea to Biden and other Democrats to take notice and
visit Reading before the election. It’s crucial, he says.</p>
<p>“I think that it’s still predominantly Democratic,” he says. “But the
candidates need to come out and really explain that to the
community.”</p>
<p>One development, Moran says, is that religious leaders are now less
hesitant to get involved in politics.</p>
<p>“Things change, even for churches,” he says. Clergy “realize the
importance that they hold as faith-based leaders and religious leaders
and they’re making a call of action through their congregations.”</p>
<p>The message: Get out and vote</p>
<p>A few blocks from St. Peter’s, a crowd gathers inside First Baptist
Church, which dates to the late 19th century.</p>
<p>In a sign of Reading’s changing demographics, the aging and shrinking
congregation of white Protestants donated the building to Iglesia
Jesucristo es el Rey (Church Jesus Christ is the King), a thriving
Latino congregation of some 100 worshippers who have shared the building
with First Baptist for nearly a decade.</p>
<p>Pastors Carol Pagan and her husband Jose, both from Puerto Rico,
recently led prayer. At the end of the service, microphone in hand, the
pastors encourage parishioners to vote in the election — irrespective of
who they choose as the president.</p>
<p>“The right to vote is,” Carol Pagan says before her husband chimes
in: “a civic responsibility.”</p>
<p>After the service, the congregation descends to the basement, where
they share a traditional meal of chicken with rice and beans.</p>
<p>“I believe the principle of human rights have to do with both parties
— or any party running,” Carol Pagan says. “I always think of the
elderly, of the health system, of health insurance, and how it shouldn’t
be so much about capitalism but more rights for all of us to be
well.”</p>
<p>Both of the Pagans make clear that they won’t vote for Trump. They’re
waiting, like others, for circumstances that might lead Biden to
withdraw, so they can support another Democratic candidate.</p>
<p>“It’s our duty to shield that person with prayer — it doesn’t matter
if that person is a Democrat or a Republican,” Carol Pagan says. “We owe
them that.”</p>

<h2 id="holocaust-orphan-finds-family-thanks-to-dna-tests">Holocaust
orphan finds family, thanks to DNA tests</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NORTH CHARLESTON, South Carolina — Shalom Korai never knew his real
name or his birthday. He was saved from the streets of a burning Warsaw
neighborhood while he was a toddler during World War II, when the rest
of his family was killed by Nazis in Poland.   </p>
<p>He grew up and lived in Israel with no idea of his past. He never
knew a hug from someone who shared his blood or his DNA — until
Wednesday, when Korai walked off an airplane in the U.S. state of South
Carolina and into the arms of Ann Meddin Hellman. Her grandfather was
the brother of Korai’s grandfather, making them second cousins. </p>
<p>It’s a story that would have been impossible without modern DNA
science and without a genetic test that Korai was given by a
psychologist who studies children orphaned in the Holocaust. </p>
<p>Hellman’s ancestors came to the United States while Korai’s family
stayed behind in Poland to run a family business. Decades later, they
would be among the 6 million Jewish men, women and children
systematically killed by the Germans in World War II.   </p>
<p>“I feel like I’ve given somebody a new life. He’s become my child. I
have to protect him and take care of him,” Hellman said, although she is
a few years younger than Korai, who is about 83. </p>
<p>She beamed and gave Korai another hug as they waited for his luggage
so they could start several days of parties with dozens of other
relatives at Hellman’s Charleston home. </p>
<p>Korai, who speaks mostly Hebrew, couldn’t stop smiling even if he
didn’t quite understand the hubbub of camera crews and Southern
hospitality swirling around him. He and Hellman spoke often since the
DNA breakthrough, first in letters and later on video calls several
times a week.   </p>
<p>As Hellman waited at the end of the jetway, she nervously spoke to
her brother and sister. “I can’t wait to get my arms around him,” she
said. </p>
<p>What is known of Korai’s story started with him alone. He was on a
street in a burning Jewish ghetto in Warsaw in 1943 when a policeman
scooped him up and took him to a convent. Nuns baptized him and started
to raise him as a gentile with several other orphaned children. </p>
<p>Lena Kuchler-Silberman, a Jewish woman who was part of the resistance
against the Nazis, heard of the children. She saved around 100 Jewish
children, sometimes taking them in as she found them abandoned or alone
or sometimes negotiating or paying to take them out of non-Jewish
orphanages. </p>
<p>Korai was taken to a Jewish boarding school in Poland, then to France
and eventually to Israel in 1949. He spent 35 years working on
semi-trucks. Korai had three children and eight grandchildren. And he
put out of his mind that he would never know his actual birthday, the
name given to him at birth, how his father and mother met or what his
grandfathers did for a living. </p>
<p>“You can’t start searching for something you know nothing about,”
Korai said in Hebrew to the website for MyHeritage, the company whose
DNA testing helped find his relatives. </p>
<p>MyHeritage offered Korai and other Holocaust orphans DNA testing in
the summer of 2023. A few months later Hellman got a ping from a DNA
sample she had given during her extensive research of her family tree.
It was an unknown second cousin. </p>
<p>The name and other information was unfamiliar. On a hunch, she asked
another cousin to test her DNA. It matched too. Hellman reached out to
MyHeritage and requested a photo and other information. She remembers
gasping when she saw Korai. He looked just like her brother.   </p>
<p>“The picture gave it away,” Hellman said.  </p>
<p>The connection instantly fell into place. Hellman knew a branch of
her family connected to her great uncle was killed during the Holocaust.
Now she knew there was a survivor. </p>
<p>Hellman wasn’t looking for anyone in particular when she took her DNA
test, but sometimes wonderful surprises happen, said Daniel Horowitz, an
expert genealogist at MyHeritage. </p>
<p>“All this family that he was always praying for came to him just like
that,” Horowitz said.   </p>
<p>Some mysteries remain, thanks to the Nazi annihilation of people and
many records of their existence. Hellman knows the name of Korai’s aunt.
“But I haven’t been able to find his parents’ names. That upsets me the
most,” she said. </p>
<p>Hellman has learned much about her cousin. He’s shy and quiet. As
Korai got off the plane Wednesday along with his travel companion and
translator, Arie Bauer, he jokingly asked if he could stand behind
Bauer. His friend told him to hug his family. </p>
<p>“It’s slowly dawning on him,” said Bauer. “He’s getting used to,
little by little, a brand new family he didn’t know about.” </p>
<p>It wasn’t just Hellman at the airport. More than a dozen other
relatives — Hellman’s brother and sister, her husband and sons, a niece,
sister-in-law and cousins were there to celebrate. Dozens more were
gathered at Hellman’s house for more parties and gatherings. </p>
<p>Korai smiled as each of his relatives hugged him. In quieter moments
when they talked among themselves, he looked them over. </p>
<p>“He’ll get to see himself in them in a way he has never gotten to see
himself before,” Hellman said. “And we get to give a family to someone
who never thought one existed.”</p>

id="demand-for-rare-elements-used-in-clean-energy-could-help-clean-up-abandoned-coal-mines-in-us">Demand
for rare elements used in clean energy could help clean up abandoned
coal mines in US</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MOUNT STORM, West Virginia — Down a long gravel road, tucked into the
hills in West Virginia, is a low-slung building where researchers are
extracting essential elements from an old coal mine that they hope will
strengthen the nation’s energy future.</p>
<p>They aren’t mining the coal that powered the steel mills and
locomotives that helped industrialize America — and that is blamed for
contributing to global warming.</p>
<p>Rather, researchers are finding that groundwater pouring out of this
and other abandoned coal mines contains the rare earth elements and
other valuable metals that are vital to making everything from electric
vehicle motors to rechargeable batteries to fighter jets smaller,
lighter or more powerful.</p>
<p>The pilot project run by West Virginia University is now part of an
intensifying worldwide race to develop a secure supply of the valuable
metals and, with more federal funding, it could grow to a commercial
scale enterprise.</p>
<p>“The ultimate irony is that the stuff that has created climate change
is now a solution, if we’re smart about it,” said John Quigley, a senior
fellow at the Kleinman Center for Energy Policy at the University of
Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The technology that has been piloted at this facility in West
Virginia could also pioneer a way to clean up vast amounts of coal mine
drainage that poisons waterways across Appalachia.</p>
<p>The project is one of the leading efforts by the federal government
as it injects more money than ever into recovering rare earth elements
to expand renewable energies and fight climate change by reducing
planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>For the U.S., which like the rest of the West is beholden to a
Chinese-controlled supply of these valuable metals, the pursuit of rare
earth elements is also a national security priority.</p>
<p>Those involved, meanwhile, hope their efforts can bring jobs in clean
energy to dying coal towns and clean up entrenched coal pollution that
has hung around for decades.</p>
<p>In Pennsylvania alone, drainage from coal piles and abandoned mines
has turned waterways red from iron ore and turquoise from aluminum,
killing life in more than 8,000 kilometers of streams. Federal
statistics also show about 1,200 square kilometers of abandoned and
unreclaimed coal mine lands host more than 200 million tons of coal
waste.</p>
<p>The metals that chemists are working to extract from mine drainage
here are lightweight, powerfully magnetized and have superior
fluorescent and conductive properties.</p>
<p>One aim of the Department of Energy is to fund research that proves
to private companies that the concepts are commercially viable and
profitable enough for them to invest their own money.</p>
<p>Hundreds of millions of dollars from President Joe Biden’s 2021
infrastructure law is accelerating the effort.</p>
<p>Department officials hope that by the middle of the 2030s this
infusion will have spawned full-fledged commercial enterprises.</p>
<p>The two most advanced projects funded by the department are the one
in West Virginia treating mine drainage and another processing coal dug
up by lignite mining in North Dakota.</p>
<p>The first could be an important source of a number of critical
metals, such as yttrium, neodymium and gadolinium, used in catalysts and
magnets. The latter could be a major source of germanium and gallium,
used in semiconductors, LEDs, electrical transmission components, solar
panels and electric vehicle motors.</p>
<p>Researchers at each site are designing a commercial-scale operation,
based on their pilot projects, in hopes of landing a massive federal
grant to build it out.</p>
<p>The alternative would be to develop new mines, disturb more land, get
permits, hire workers, build roads and connect power supplies, tasks
that take years.</p>
<p>“With acid mind drainage, that’s already done for you,” said Paul
Ziemkiewicz, director of the Water Research Institute at West Virginia
University.</p>
<p>Ziemkiewicz began the mine drainage project almost a decade ago,
helped by federal subsidies. He had envisioned it as a way to treat
runoff, recover critical minerals and raise money for more mine cleanups
in West Virginia.</p>
<p>But the Biden administration’s ambitious funding for clean energy and
a domestic supply of critical minerals broadened that goal.</p>
<p>At the facility, drainage from a one-time coal mine — now closed and
covered by a grassy slope — emerges from two pipes, and dumps about
3,028 liters per minute into a retention pond.</p>
<p>From there the water is routed through massive indoor pools and a
series of large tanks that, with the help of lime to lower the acidity,
separate out most of the silicate, iron and aluminum. That produces a
pale powdery concentrate that is about 95% rare earth oxides, plus water
clean enough to return to a nearby creek.</p>
<p>The Department of Energy is funding research on coal wastes in
various states.</p>
<p>“There are literally billions of tons of coal ash and coal waste
lying around, across the country. And so if we can go back in and remine
those, there’s decades worth of materials there,” said Grant Bromhal,
the acting director of the Department of Energy’s Division of Minerals
Sustainability.</p>
<p>Not only coal, but old copper and phosphate mines also hold
potential, Bromhal said.</p>
<p>The country won’t be able to recover metals from all of them right
away, but technologies the department is helping develop can satisfy a
substantial part of demand in the next 20 to 30 years, Bromhal said.</p>
<p>“So if we get into the tens of percents or 50%, I think that’s in the
realm of possibility,” he said.</p>
<p>Other solutions to obtain more of these metals are retrieving them
from discarded devices and shifting sourcing to friendly nations and
away from geopolitical rivals or unstable countries, analysts say. For
now, there is only a handful of critical or rare earth mineral mines in
the United States, although many more are being proposed.</p>
<p>One final subsidy will be required from the federal government: buy
the reclaimed metals at a price that guarantees a commercially viable
operation, Ziemkiewicz said.</p>
<p>That way China can’t simply buy up the product or use its market
dominance to drive down prices and scare away private investors, he
said.</p>
<p>Quigley, a former environmental protection secretary of Pennsylvania
and a one-time small-city mayor in coal country, hopes to see a facility
like Ziemkiewicz’s come to the Jeddo mine tunnel system in northeastern
Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The Jeddo has defied decades of efforts to treat its flow, which
drains a vast network of abandoned underground mines.</p>
<p>It is a massive source of pollution in the Chesapeake Bay watershed,
producing an estimated 114,000 to 151,000 liters per minute.</p>
<p>Bringing the Little Nescopeck Creek back to life could put people to
work cleaning up the stream and creating recreational opportunities from
a newly revived waterway, Quigley said.</p>
<p>“This could mean a lot to coal communities, to a lot of people in the
coal region,” Quigley said. “And to the country.”</p>

Pezeshkian rejects US pressure, praises Russia, China</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — The United States should realize that
Iran will not respond to pressure, President-elect Masoud Pezeshkian
said in a statement published Saturday, in which he also highlighted his
country’s friendship with China and Russia.</p>
<p>Pezeshkian, a relative moderate who beat a hardline rival in
elections, also reiterated that Iran does not seek nuclear weapons,
adding that Tehran would expand ties with neighbors and engage with
Europe.</p>
<p>“The United States … needs to recognize the reality and understand,
once and for all, that Iran does not — and will not — respond to
pressure (and) that Iran’s defense doctrine does not include nuclear
weapons,” Pezeshkian said in the statement, titled “My message to the
new world” and published in the daily Tehran Times.</p>
<p>Pezeshkian, a 69-year-old heart surgeon, has pledged to promote a
pragmatic foreign policy, ease tensions over now-stalled negotiations
with major powers to revive a 2015 nuclear pact and improve prospects
for social liberalization and political pluralism.</p>
<p>However, many Iranians are skeptical about his ability to fulfill his
campaign promises as Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, not the
president, is the ultimate authority in the Islamic Republic.</p>
<p>“China and Russia have consistently stood by us during challenging
times. We deeply value this friendship,” Pezeshkian said.</p>
<p>“Russia is a valued strategic ally and neighbor to Iran and my
administration will remain committed to expanding and enhancing our
cooperation,” he said, adding that Tehran would actively support
initiatives aimed at ending the conflict in Ukraine.</p>
<p>“The Iranian people have entrusted me with a strong mandate to
vigorously pursue constructive engagement on the international stage
while insisting on our rights, our dignity and our deserved role in the
region and the world.</p>
<p>“I extend an open invitation to those willing to join us in this
historic endeavor,” Pezeshkian said.</p>

id="judge-dismisses-involuntary-manslaughter-case-against-actor-baldwin">Judge
dismisses involuntary manslaughter case against actor Baldwin</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SANTA FE, New Mexico — A New Mexico judge brought a sudden, stunning
end Friday to the involuntary manslaughter case against Alec Baldwin,
dismissing it in the middle of the actor’s trial. </p>
<p>Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer dismissed the case with prejudice - meaning
it cannot be filed again - based on the misconduct of police and
prosecutors. She said evidence in the shooting in 2021 of
cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the set of the film “Rust” had been
withheld from the defense</p>
<p>Baldwin cried, hugged his two attorneys, gestured to the front of the
court, then turned to hug his crying wife, Hilaria. He climbed into an
SUV outside the Santa Fe courthouse without speaking to reporters.</p>
<p>Baldwin, 66, could have been sentenced to 18 months in prison if
convicted.</p>
<p>“The late discovery of this evidence during trial has impeded the
effective use of evidence in such a way that it has impacted the
fundamental fairness of the proceedings,” Marlowe Sommer said. “If this
conduct does not rise to the level of bad faith, it certainly comes so
near to bad faith to show signs of scorching.”</p>
<p>Marlowe Sommer had paused the trial earlier Friday while she
considered the defense motion to dismiss the case over the withheld
evidence.</p>
<p>The defense argued that prosecutors had hidden evidence about
ammunition that might have been related to the shooting. Defense
attorneys said they should have had the ability to determine the
importance of the evidence. </p>
<p>The prosecution said that the ammunition was not connected to the
case and had not been hidden.</p>
<p>The issue emerged Thursday on the second day of the actor’s trial
during defense questioning of sheriff’s crime scene technician Marissa
Poppell. Baldwin attorney Alex Spiro asked whether a “good Samaritan”
had come into the sheriff’s office with the ammunition earlier this year
after the trial of Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, the film’s armorer, for her
role in Hutchins’ death. She was sentenced to 18 months in prison on an
involuntary manslaughter conviction, which she is now appealing.</p>
<p>Baldwin’s legal team said the Santa Fe sheriff’s office took
possession of the live rounds as evidence in the case but failed to list
them in the “Rust” investigation file or disclose their existence to
defense attorneys.</p>
<p>They also alleged the rounds were evidence that the bullet that
killed Hutchins came from Seth Kenney, the movie’s prop supplier. Kenney
has denied supplying live ammunition to the production and has not been
charged in the case.</p>
<p>“The state’s withholding of the evidence was willful and deliberate,”
Marlowe Sommer said in delivering her decision. “Dismissal with
prejudice is warranted to ensure the integrity of the judicial system
and the efficient administration of justice.”</p>
<p>Erlinda Johnson, one of the state prosecutors, had resigned from the
case earlier Friday.</p>
