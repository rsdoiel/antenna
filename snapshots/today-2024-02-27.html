<h2 id="apple-killed-music-on-the-move-for-me">2024-02-07 Apple killed
music on the move, for me</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-27, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
2024-02-07 Apple killed music on the move, for me
</h1>
<p>
I was thinking about joining the
<a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/cool-tech-zone/tangara">Tangara</a>
crowdfunding. It’s a kind of iPod, but better in that it is all open.
Yay!
</p>
<p>
But then I realized something: Having an iPhone made listening to music
such a shit show that I basically stopped and switched my entire
phone-based audio entertainment to podcasts. Because podcast clients are
great (at least <a href="https://icatcher.app/about/">iCatcher</a> is)
where as Apple Music is a pain. Having used iTunes when it was cool
until it was unusable, and then realizing what a pain the weird AAC
formats on the files were, and the DRM on some of them, preventing me
from playing them on other machines I owned. I was so angry.
</p>
<p>
In a fit of hate I decided I was going to
<a href="2019-07-08_Apple_Photos">move all my pictures out of
iPhotos</a> and all my music out of iTunes and never go back. And I did.
And so the Apple Music app died, and I guess no alternatives were
allowed on the App Store because Apple is great like that, and so when
the iPod classic I had with
<a href="2017-12-21_Rockbox_on_the_iPod">Rockbox</a> installed
<a href="2022-11-18_iPod%2C_iPad%2C_iPhone%2C_iPiss">finally died</a>,
all I was left with was podcasts on the iPhone.
</p>
<p>
And so now I don’t even know whether I want to listen to music any more
while I’m on the move.
</p>
<p>
Apple killed music on the move, for me.
</p>
<p>
At home it’s a different story, of course, but Tangara is a portable
music player.
</p>
<p>
I wish Tangara the best of luck.

<p>
<strong>2024-02-27</strong>. I joined the Kickstarter. Not because I
have a terribly good feeling about it but because I remember wanting a
portable audio player and I recently found, once again, that I really
hate the Apple Music app.

This week has already been a wild one for U.S. weather, as what is

to be the warmest February on record comes to a close. Many states in
the Midwest and South experienced a heatwave yesterday that brought
record high winter temperatures. It was 65 degrees Fahrenheit in

for example, where the normal high is 33. Parts of Texas saw
temperatures soar into the 90s. In Chicago, where February temperatures
usually sit in the low 30s at best, it was a balmy 60 degrees yesterday.
The warm weather brought with it wind gusts and

risks</a>, and red flag warnings were in place from Texas to Missouri.
</p>
<p>
But prepare for some weather whiplash: A cold front is advancing east,
and will plunge some of those warmer states into frigid temperatures.
Grand Forks, North Dakota, for example, won’t see temperatures rise

Maine’s Can-Am Crown International Sled Dog Race, the longest such race
in the eastern United States, due to lack of snow. Since 1992, the
250-mile trek has taken place in snowy northern Maine, but this year the
region has seen just over half the typical amount of snowfall. “The
unique challenges presented by the lack of snow have led us to conclude
that moving forward with this year’s race could compromise the
well-being of all involved,” wrote Can-Am President Dennis Cyr. “It is a
decision made with heavy hearts but necessary caution.” National Weather
Service meteorologist Joe Wegman
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=57905d8c6a&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>
the lack of snow across parts of the country is creating a feedback
loop: “Most of the eastern two-thirds of the country has had a
relatively snow-less winter, so the ground is bare and dry. So we’re
getting much warmer temperatures just due to solar radiation.”

<li>Report: First Solar helped create 16,000 U.S. jobs in 2023
</h3>
<p>
<strong></strong>First Solar, the largest solar panel manufacturer in
America, has been a boon for the nation’s economy, according to
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=84cdc68dec&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">analysis</a>
from the University of Louisiana at Lafayette’s Kathleen Babineaux
Blanco Public Policy Center and commissioned by the company. The report
found that First Solar had 2,700 people on payroll in 2023, but because
“each First Solar job ends up supporting six more jobs throughout the
U.S. economy,” the company had a trickle-down effect of supporting some
16,000 jobs, <em>Electrek</em>’s Michelle Lewis
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=a1beb23297&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">explained</a>.
The company added $2.75 billion in value and $5.32 billion in output to
the U.S. economy last year. By 2026, those numbers are expected to climb
to $4.99 billion and $10.18 billion, respectively, as the company
expands its solar capacity. First Solar is “a fully vertically
integrated manufacturer of thin-film PV solar panels,” Lewis said. “This
means they can turn a sheet of glass into a functional solar panel in
about four hours, relying heavily on U.S.-sourced materials like glass
and steel.”

<li>Oil and gas profits triple during Biden presidency

<p>
<strong></strong>Major U.S. oil and gas producers have seen profits
nearly triple during President Biden’s presidency as production has
soared,
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=11360807fa&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>
the <em>Financial Times</em>. The 10 most valuable operators – including
ExxonMobil, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, and others – amassed a combined net
income of $313 billion between 2020 and 2023, up from $112 billion
during the same period of Donald Trump’s presidency. “The outperformance
under Biden underlines the limited role of the White House in dictating
the sector’s fortunes.” But it still won’t look great on his resume as
he seeks to bolster support from climate-conscious progressives heading
into the 2024 election. Biden ran “the most ambitious climate platform
of any U.S. president in history,” and has indeed taken aim at the oil
and gas industry during his tenure, the <em>FT</em> wrote. But he has
also pushed to keep production high in the face of inflation and energy
shocks.

<li>Carbon removal startup Equatic to build demonstration plant in
Singapore
</h3>
<p>
<strong></strong>Carbon removal startup Equatic confirmed today that it
is building a $20 million plant in Singapore to demonstrate the
company’s technology, <em>Bloomberg</em>
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=0d3719cf30&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.
Equatic uses electrolysis to permanently remove carbon dioxide from
seawater, enabling it to absorb more of the greenhouse gas from the air.
The process also creates hydrogen as a byproduct. The company already
has two smaller pilot plants in operation, but the new one will be
different for a few reasons: First, it’s much bigger – when complete, it
could rival the annual carbon capturing capabilities of Climeworks,
currently the world’s biggest carbon removal plant. Second, it will use
a new proprietary process that doesn’t produce harmful chlorine gas. And
third, it will mark a step toward commercialization as the company looks
to scale and find more buyers. Boeing is among its most prominent
customers, committing to pay the company to remove 62,000 tons of CO2
and produce 2,100 tons of hydrogen. Equatic plans to eventually build a
commercial-scale plant that it claims will remove 100,000 tons of CO2
per year.

Hypothetical AI election disinformation risks vs real AI harms (27 Feb
2024)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-27, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links Hypothetical AI election disinformation risks vs real
AI harms: And those real AI harms are priming people to believe
disinformation. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in
history: 2009, 2014, 2019, 2023 Colophon: Recent publications,

Hypothetical AI election disinformation risks vs real AI harms
(permalink) You can barely turn around these days without encountering a
think-piece warning of the impending risk of AI disinformation in the
coming elections. But a recent episode of This Machine Kills podcast
reminds us that these are hypothetical risks, and there is no shortage
of real AI harms:
https://soundcloud.com/thismachinekillspod/311-selling-pickaxes-for-the-ai-gold-rush
The algorithmic decision-making systems that increasingly run the
back-ends to our lives are really, truly very bad at doing their jobs,
and worse, these systems constitute a form of “empiricism-washing”: if
the computer says it’s true, it must be true. There’s no such thing as
racist math, you SJW snowflake!
https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/02/aoc-algorithms-racist-bias.html
Nearly 1,000 British postmasters were wrongly convicted of fraud by
Horizon, the faulty AI fraud-hunting system that Fujitsu provided to the
Royal Mail. They had their lives ruined by this faulty AI, many went to
prison, and at least four of the AI’s victims killed themselves:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Post_Office_scandal Tenants across
America have seen their rents skyrocket thanks to Realpage’s landlord
price-fixing algorithm, which deployed the time-honored defense: “It’s
not a crime if we commit it with an app”:
https://www.propublica.org/article/doj-backs-tenants-price-fixing-case-big-landlords-real-estate-tech
Housing, you’ll recall, is pretty foundational in the human hierarchy of
needs. Losing your home – or being forced to choose between paying rent
or buying groceries or gas for your car or clothes for your kid – is a
non-hypothetical, widespread, urgent problem that can be traced straight
to AI. Then there’s predictive policing: cities across America and the
world have bought systems that purport to tell the cops where to look
for crime. Of course, these systems are trained on policing data from
forces that are seeking to correct racial bias in their practices by
using an algorithm to create “fairness.” You feed this algorithm a
data-set of where the police had detected crime in previous years, and
it predicts where you’ll find crime in the years to come. But you only
find crime where you look for it. If the cops only ever stop-and-frisk
Black and brown kids, or pull over Black and brown drivers, then every
knife, baggie or gun they find in someone’s trunk or pockets will be
found in a Black or brown person’s trunk or pocket. A predictive
policing algorithm will naively ingest this data and confidently assert
that future crimes can be foiled by looking for more Black and brown
people and searching them and pulling them over. Obviously, this is bad
for Black and brown people in low-income neighborhoods, whose baseline
risk of an encounter with a cop turning violent or even lethal. But it’s
also bad for affluent people in affluent neighborhoods – because they
are underpoliced as a result of these algorithmic biases. For example,
domestic abuse that occurs in full detached single-family homes is
systematically underrepresented in crime data, because the majority of
domestic abuse calls originate with neighbors who can hear the abuse
take place through a shared wall. But the majority of algorithmic harms
are inflicted on poor, racialized and/or working class people. Even if
you escape a predictive policing algorithm, a facial recognition
algorithm may wrongly accuse you of a crime, and even if you were far
away from the site of the crime, the cops will still arrest you, because
computers don’t lie:
https://www.cbsnews.com/sacramento/news/texas-macys-sunglass-hut-facial-recognition-software-wrongful-arrest-sacramento-alibi/
Trying to get a low-waged service job? Be prepared for endless,
nonsensical AI “personality tests” that make Scientology look like NASA:
https://futurism.com/mandatory-ai-hiring-tests Service workers’
schedules are at the mercy of shift-allocation algorithms that assign
them hours that ensure that they fall just short of qualifying for
health and other benefits. These algorithms push workers into
“clopening” – where you close the store after midnight and then open it
again the next morning before 5AM. And if you try to unionize, another
algorithm – that spies on you and your fellow workers’ social media
activity – targets you for reprisals and your store for closure. If
you’re driving an Amazon delivery van, algorithm watches your eyeballs
and tells your boss that you’re a bad driver if it doesn’t like what it
sees. If you’re working in an Amazon warehouse, an algorithm decides if
you’ve taken too many pee-breaks and automatically dings you:
https://pluralistic.net/2022/04/17/revenge-of-the-chickenized-reverse-centaurs/
If this disgusts you and you’re hoping to use your ballot to elect
lawmakers who will take up your cause, an algorithm stands in your way
again. “AI” tools for purging voter rolls are especially harmful to
racialized people – for example, they assume that two “Juan Gomez”es
with a shared birthday in two different states must be the same person
and remove one or both from the voter rolls:
https://www.cbsnews.com/news/eligible-voters-swept-up-conservative-activists-purge-voter-rolls/
Hoping to get a solid education, the sort that will keep you out of
AI-supervised, precarious, low-waged work? Sorry, kiddo: the ed-tech
system is riddled with algorithms. There’s the grifty “remote
invigilation” industry that watches you take tests via webcam and
accuses you of cheating if your facial expressions fail its high-tech
phrenology standards:
https://pluralistic.net/2022/02/16/unauthorized-paper/#cheating-anticheat
All of these are non-hypothetical, real risks from AI. The AI industry
has proven itself incredibly adept at deflecting interest from real
harms to hypothetical ones, like the “risk” that the spicy autocomplete
will become conscious and take over the world in order to convert us all
to paperclips:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/11/27/10-types-of-people/#taking-up-a-lot-of-space
Whenever you hear AI bosses talking about how seriously they’re taking a
hypothetical risk, that’s the moment when you should check in on whether
they’re doing anything about all these longstanding, real risks. And
even as AI bosses promise to fight hypothetical election disinformation,
they continue to downplay or ignore the non-hypothetical, here-and-now
harms of AI. There’s something unseemly – and even perverse – about
worrying so much about AI and election disinformation. It plays into the
narrative that kicked off in earnest in 2016, that the reason the
electorate votes for manifestly unqualified candidates who run on a
platform of bald-faced lies is that they are gullible and easily led
astray. But there’s another explanation: the reason people accept
conspiratorial accounts of how our institutions are run is because the
institutions that are supposed to be defending us are corrupt and
captured by actual conspiracies:
https://memex.craphound.com/2019/09/21/republic-of-lies-the-rise-of-conspiratorial-thinking-and-the-actual-conspiracies-that-fuel-it/
The party line on conspiratorial accounts is that these institutions are
good, actually. Think of the rebuttal offered to anti-vaxxers who
claimed that pharma giants were run by murderous sociopath billionaires
who were in league with their regulators to kill us for a buck: “no, I
think you’ll find pharma companies are great and superbly regulated”:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/05/not-that-naomi/#if-the-naomi-be-klein-youre-doing-just-fine
Institutions are profoundly important to a high-tech society. No one is
capable of assessing all the life-or-death choices we make every day,
from whether to trust the firmware in your car’s anti-lock brakes, the
alloys used in the structural members of your home, or the food-safety
standards for the meal you’re about to eat. We must rely on
well-regulated experts to make these calls for us, and when the
institutions fail us, we are thrown into a state of epistemological
chaos. We must make decisions about whether to trust these technological
systems, but we can’t make informed choices because the one thing we’re
sure of is that our institutions aren’t trustworthy. Ironically, the
long list of AI harms that we live with every day are the most important
contributor to disinformation campaigns. It’s these harms that provide
the evidence for belief in conspiratorial accounts of the world, because
each one is proof that the system can’t be trusted. The election
disinformation discourse focuses on the lies told – and not why those
lies are credible. That’s because the subtext of election disinformation
concerns is usually that the electorate is credulous, fools waiting to
be suckered in. By refusing to contemplate the institutional failures
that sit upstream of conspiracism, we can smugly locate the blame with
the peddlers of lies and assume the mantle of paternalistic protectors
of the easily gulled electorate. But the group of people who are
demonstrably being tricked by AI is the people who buy the horrifically
flawed AI-based algorithmic systems and put them into use despite their
manifest failures. As I’ve written many times, “we’re nowhere near a
place where bots can steal your job, but we’re certainly at the point
where your boss can be suckered into firing you and replacing you with a
bot that fails at doing your job”
https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/15/passive-income-brainworms/#four-hour-work-week
The most visible victims of AI disinformation are the people who are
putting AI in charge of the life-chances of millions of the rest of us.
Tackle that AI disinformation and its harms, and we’ll make
conspiratorial claims about our institutions being corrupt far less
credible. (Image: Cryteria, CC BY 3.0, modified) Hey look at this

appears to be that it’s the personalities that matter, not what the

history and english majors, is considered irrelevant or optional, or
maybe kind of cute, by the typical reporter. So she expresses tech in
terms the journalists understand, therefore they like her.</p>

Last week, someone posted something like 570 files, images and chat logs
from a Chinese company called I-Soon. I-Soon sells hacking and espionage
services to Chinese national and local government.

<p>
These aren’t details about the tools or techniques, more the inner
workings of the company. And they seem to primarily be hacking
regionally.

wants to update your Windows 11 PC without forcing you to reboot</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-27, from: OS News</p>
<p>If there’s one thing Windows users hate about Windows, it’s Windows
updates interrupting your workflow or gaming session with a popup asking
you to restart your PC finish installing the latest security update. It
happens at least once a month, because that’s how often Microsoft rolls
out security updates to Windows PCs. This may soon be a thing of the
past, as the company is now testing an update method called “hot
patching” for Windows 11 PCs. Hot patching is already in use on some
Windows Server editions, as well as Xbox, and now it appears the company
is preparing to bring it to devices running Windows 11. ↫ Zac Bowden at
Windows Central A welcome, good improvement every Windows user is going
to benefit from. This is the kind of improvements Microsoft should
really be focusing on, instead of adding more ads or useless “AI”
features.</p>

<h2 id="a-history-of-the-tty">A history of the tty</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-27, from: OS News</p>
<p>It’s one of those anachronisms that is deeply embedded in modern
technology. From cloud operator servers to embedded controllers in
appliances, there must be uncountable devices that think they are
connected to a TTY. I will omit the many interesting details of the
Linux terminal infrastructure here, as it could easily fill its own
article. But most Linux users are at least peripherally aware that the
kernel tends to identify both serial devices and terminals as TTYs,
assigning them filesystem names in the form of /dev/tty*. Probably a lot
of those people remember that this stands for teletype or perhaps
teletypewriter, although in practice the term teleprinter is more
common. ↫ J. B. Crawford I remember first using Linux in like 2000 or
2001, and running into the abbreviation tty, and not having a single
clue what that meant since I came from a DOS and Windows background.
Over time I gained a lot more understanding of the structure of modern
UNIX-like systems, but it’s still great to read such a detailed history
of the concept.</p>

<h2 id="renewal-of-us-china-science-and-tech-pact-faces-hurdles">Renewal
of US-China Science and Tech Pact Faces Hurdles</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>STATE DEPARTMENT — With a science and technology agreement between
the United States and People’s Republic of China due to expire Tuesday,
the State Department said it is negotiating to “amend, extend, and
strengthen protections within” the agreement but declined to specify if
the U.S. would extend the deal.</p>
<p>“We are not able to provide information at this time on specific U.S.
negotiating positions or on whether the agreement will be extended past
its current expiration date,” a State Department spokesperson told
VOA.</p>
<p>The Science and Technology Cooperation Agreement is a framework for
U.S. governmental collaborations with China in science and technology.
 </p>
<p>U.S. officials have said the STA provides consistent standards for
government-to-government scientific cooperation between the U.S. and
China.  </p>
<p>While the agreement supports scientific collaboration in areas that
benefit the United States, U.S. officials acknowledge the challenges
posed by China’s national science and technology strategies and its
domestic legal framework.</p>
<p>Critics, including U.S. lawmakers, point out China’s restrictions on
data and a lack of transparency in sharing scientific findings.
Washington is also concerned about personal safety of American
scientists who travel to China, as well as Beijing’s potential military
application of shared research.</p>
<p>A report by Congressional Research Service said China’s cooperation
under the agreement has not been consistent. For example, “China
reportedly withheld avian influenza strains required for U.S. vaccines
and in 2019, cut off U.S. access to coronavirus research, including
U.S.-funded work at the Wuhan Institute of Virology,” said the CRS.</p>
<p>Advocates for renewing the agreement want to maintain some level of
official and unofficial contacts amid strained relationship between the
two countries.  </p>
<p>During a recent discussion hosted by the Washington-based Institute
for China-America Studies (ICAS), panelists said the STA is “important
symbolically” and gives confidence to researchers on both sides to
deepen their engagement with counterparts.</p>
<p>“In the event of the agreement’s non-renewal, the mutual confidence
that sustains and underpins collaboration is bound to suffer,” said ICAS
in its post-event summary.</p>
<p>Dean Cheng, a senior advisor to the China program at the U.S.
Institute of Peace, said the American system is far more open, so China
will typically be able to gather information regardless of whether there
is an agreement.</p>
<p>“The STA is no guarantee that American scientists will, in fact, be
able to access Chinese research, information, or scholars, whereas the
Chinese side will use the STA as a means of establishing an even greater
presence in the U.S.,” Cheng told VOA, adding the “strategic advantage”
under the deal will likely be with the PRC.</p>
<p>The STA was originally signed in 1979 by then-U.S. President Jimmy
Carter and then-PRC leader Deng Xiaoping. Under the agreement, the two
countries cooperate in fields including agriculture, energy, space,
health, environment, earth sciences and engineering, as well as
educational and scholarly exchanges.</p>
<p>U.S.-China science and technology activity increased in November 2009
with new agreements on joint projects in electric vehicles, or EVs,
renewable energy, and the creation of the U.S.-China Clean Energy
Research Center, or CERC, a 10-year research effort between the U.S.
Department of Energy and China’s Ministry of Science and Technology.</p>
<p>The agreement has been renewed approximately every five years since

id="chinese-airlines-can-boost-us-flights-to-50-per-week-us-says">Chinese
Airlines Can Boost US Flights to 50 Per Week, US Says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Chinese passenger airlines will be allowed to boost
their weekly round-trip U.S. flights to 50 starting on March 31, up from
the current 35, the U.S. Transportation Department said on Monday,
returning the market to nearly one-third of pre-pandemic levels.</p>
<p>The approval “is a significant step forward in further normalization
of the U.S.-China market in anticipation of the Summer 2024 traffic
season,” the USDOT said.</p>
<p>More than 150 weekly round-trip passenger flights were allowed by
each side before restrictions were imposed in early 2020 due to the
COVID-19 pandemic, but until August 2023, Chinese and U.S. carriers
could each fly only 12 a week between</p>
<p>the two countries.</p>
<p>The number rose on Sept. 1 to 18 weekly roundtrips and then to 24 per
week starting Oct. 29. The USDOT approved 35 for Chinese carriers in
November.</p>
<p>Airlines for America, a group representing American Airlines , Delta
Air Lines and United Airlines, which fly a combined 31 weekly flights to
China, said it “supports the U.S. government’s approach to slowly,
gradually and reciprocally reopen the market with China. It’s imperative
the U.S. government maintains this approach.”</p>
<p>The Chinese embassy in Washington said it was “glad to see the
positive progress made on increasing direct passenger flights between
China and the U.S.” The embassy added it is working to “further
facilitate cross-border travel and promote people-to-people exchange
between the two countries.”</p>
<p>Reuters reported last June that newly approved Chinese flights to the
United States were not overflying Russia, which would have given them a
shorter flight time and fuel advantage over U.S. rivals blocked from
Russian airspace.</p>
<p>Other international air markets involving China have reopened far
more quickly, with seat capacity between China and the United Kingdom
this month exceeding pre-pandemic levels by 30%, and China-Singapore by
6%, according to aviation data</p>
<p>provider OAG.</p>
<p>The USDOT said it was engaged in a productive dialogue with China’s
aviation regulator towards the “implementation of a roadmap to provide
for a gradual, broader reopening of the U.S.-China air services market
and a phased and predictable return to the capacity entitlements”
specified under a U.S.-China agreement.</p>
<p>On a trip to China last year, U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo
said she wanted to boost travel and tourism between the two
countries.</p>
<p>If China returned to 2019 U.S. tourism levels, it would add $30
billion to the U.S. economy and 50,000 U.S. jobs, Raimondo said in

<p>date: 2024-02-27, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog</p>
<p>Lots of moving pieces on this Monday, with the biggest stories coming
in international affairs. The U.S. has appointed a special envoy for
Sudan, which is ten months into a civil war that has turned 8 million
people into refugees, sending 1.5 million into other countries; closed
80% of the hospitals in the area of the fighting; and prompted torture,
rape, and deliberate starvation of civilians, at least 14,600 of whom
have been killed. Tom Perriello will, the State Department said,
“coordinate the U.S. policy on Sudan and advance our efforts to end the
hostilities, secure unhindered humanitarian access, and support the
Sudanese people as they seek to fulfill their aspirations for freedom,
peace, and justice.”</p>

id="pentagon-absolves-itself-after-secrecy-surrounding-austins-hospitalization">Pentagon
Absolves Itself After Secrecy Surrounding Austin’s Hospitalization</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — An internal review blames privacy restrictions and staff
hesitancy for the Pentagon’s failure last month to quickly notify the
president and other senior leaders about Defense Secretary Lloyd
Austin’s hospitalization for complications from prostate cancer
surgery.</p>
<p>The review, which was done by Austin’s subordinates, largely absolves
anyone of wrongdoing for the secrecy surrounding his hospitalization,
which included several days in the intensive care unit. And it says
flatly there was “no indication of ill intent or an attempt to
obfuscate.”</p>
<p>Instead, the 30-day examination of the lapse — which angered the
White House and members of Congress — says procedures must be improved
and information shared better about when the defense secretary must
transfer decision-making authorities to the deputy.</p>
<p>Austin has been called to Capitol Hill on Thursday for a House
hearing and is expected to face sharp criticism. The Defense
Department’s inspector general is also conducting a review, which has
not yet been completed.</p>
<p>Austin was diagnosed with prostate cancer in early December and went
to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for surgery on December
22. On January 1, he was taken back to Walter Reed by ambulance after
experiencing significant pain and was moved to the intensive care unit
the next day.</p>
<p>Although he transferred decision-making authorities to Deputy
Secretary Kathleen Hicks during his initial surgery and then again when
he was in intensive care, he did not tell her why and he did not inform
the White House.</p>
<p>Pentagon officials have acknowledged that public affairs and defense
aides were told on January 2 that Austin had been hospitalized but did
not make it public and did not tell the military service leaders or the
National Security Council until January 4. Only then did President Joe
Biden find out. It took four more days before the reason for his
hospitalization was disclosed.</p>
<p>Defense officials released an unclassified summary of the review on
Monday and a set of recommended changes. The review suggests there was
no established method for handling such an incident, and the fact that
his hospitalization was “unplanned” contributed to the failure to let
others know.</p>
<p>It also says Austin’s staff was limited by medical privacy laws that
prohibited doctors from providing information and they “were hesitant to
pry or share any information they did learn.” It adds that since
Austin’s condition was “in flux” they could not ensure “timely secured
communications.”</p>
<p>Major General Pat Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary, told reporters
Monday that Austin’s aides found themselves in an “unprecedented
situation.” He said that as Austin was being moved into intensive care,
his aides recognized that he would not have access to critical
communications, and they made the decision to transfer authorities to
the deputy.</p>
<p>The fact that staff and not Austin made the decision raised questions
about who was in control of the department at that moment, including
America’s nuclear arsenal. Ryder said there were “no gaps” in command
and control of the department.</p>
<p>Pressed on the lack of blame and whether anyone is being disciplined,
Ryder said, “as the secretary has said, the buck stops with him and he’s
taking responsibility for not notifying the president and the White
House sooner.”</p>
<p>He added that “dedicated public servants were doing what they thought
was the right thing.”</p>
<p>The 30-day review was finished and submitted to Austin on February 8,
but only parts of it were publicly released. The Pentagon has argued
that portions of the report are classified.</p>
<p>Austin, in a press briefing after he returned to work, told reporters
that he never told his staff to keep his surgery and hospitalization
secret from the White House, but acknowledged he should have handled it
differently and he apologized for keeping Biden and others in the dark.
He denied there was a culture of secrecy in his office, and also said
that staff members may have perceived that “they’re doing things in my
best interest.”</p>
<p>The recommended changes include better guidelines for the transfer of
authorities and better reporting requirements during those
incidents.</p>
<p>His secrecy about the hospitalizations prompted the White House to
issue new guidelines to ensure it will be informed any time a Cabinet
head transfers decision-making authorities when they are unreachable due
to medical, travel or other reasons.</p>

<p>This is a short post to share a GitHub Actions pattern I use to setup
Poetry and pre-commit. These two tools cover most of my Python
development needs. I use Poetry to manage dependencies and pre-commit to
run code checks and formatting. The setup is fast because it caches the
virtual environment and the .local directory. I like to use custom
actions for this type of stuff. These are base actions that can be
re-used in multiple workflows.</p>

routing</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-27, from: Lean Rada’s blog</p>
<p>
You’re probably a busy person, so here’s the CSS:
</p>
<pre><code><span>section:not(:target)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>display</span><span>:</span> none<span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>

<a target="_blank" href="https://leanrada.com/notes/pure-css-spa-router/example1?ref=rss">Open

<h2 id="explanation">
Explanation
</h2>
<p>
The
<a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:target"><code>:target</code></a>
CSS selector selects the element that is targeted by the URL fragment.
</p>
<p>
Combined with <code>:not</code>, we can hide sections that are
<em>not</em> referenced by the URL fragment.
</p>
<p>
Just as JS routers use the fragment to hide/show sections in the DOM,
this “CSS router” uses the same fragment to hide/show sections in the
DOM.
</p>
<h2 id="experiment-default-section">
Experiment: Default section
</h2>
<p>
Notice that the example above doesn’t start with the Home section. The
content is blank initially. This is because on initial page load we
don’t have a URL fragment to begin with.
</p>
<p>
We need to make an exception for the Home section.
</p>
<p>
Let’s start by not hiding the <code>#home</code> section by default.
Only hide <code>#home</code> if there’s a specific <code>:target</code>
section.
</p>
<pre><code><span><span>-</span><span> section:not(:target) {
</span></span><span><span>+</span><span> section:not(#home, :target),
</span><span>+</span><span> :root:has(:target) #home {
</span></span><span><span> </span><span>   display: none;
</span><span> </span><span> }</span></span></code></pre>

<h2 id="experiment-nested-routes">
Experiment: Nested routes
</h2>
<p>
One thing that makes most client-side routers modular is the ability to
nest routes. We can do the same with CSS.
</p>
<pre><code><span><span>-</span><span> section:not(:target) {
</span></span><span><span>+</span><span> section:not(:target, :has(:target)) {
</span></span><span><span> </span><span>   display: none;
</span><span> </span><span> }</span></span></code></pre>
<p>
<strong>Demo v3: This demo is best when you

</p>
<iframe src="example3/">
</iframe>
<a target="_blank" href="https://leanrada.com/notes/pure-css-spa-router/example3?ref=rss">Open
in a new tab</a>
<h2 id="parameterised-routes">
Parameterised routes?
</h2>
<p>
The ultimate feature for client-side routers is to dynamically catch
routes with parameters like for example <code>/post/:id</code>.
</p>
<p>
Since HTML is static, there’s no real way to do this with CSS. ☹
</p>
<p>
Unless… you could render all possible <code>:id</code> values in the
markup and use it like you would nested routes.
</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;!-- ... --&gt;</span>
<span><span><span>&lt;</span>section</span> <span>id</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>post/128<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>&lt;!-- ... --&gt;</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>section</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&lt;</span>section</span> <span>id</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>post/129<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>&lt;!-- ... --&gt;</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>section</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&lt;</span>section</span> <span>id</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>post/130<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>&lt;!-- ... --&gt;</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>section</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span>&lt;!-- ... --&gt;</span></code></pre>
<p>
But that’d be like putting the entire database in HTML. What if you have
two parameters in the route? It could be a combinatorial explosion. So
no, the experiments end here. 👋

<h2 id="why-the-secs-new-climate-rules-matter">Why the SEC’s New Climate
Rules Matter</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-26, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTU2ODg5MC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczNzMzMDc0OH0.ycBMSz0KOmVPTmGtD7k7usj0RAVg8k9cIz88iQH8qDI/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
A new era of transparency for corporate sustainability is coming —
finally. After two years of deliberation, the Securities and Exchange
Commission is expected to issue a final rule requiring public companies
to make climate-related disclosures to investors. The decision could
come as soon as next week.
</p>
<p>
The rule considers two categories of climate-related information
relevant to investors: greenhouse gas emissions and exposure to
climate-related risks like extreme weather or future regulations. While
many companies voluntarily disclose this kind of information in other
ways, the rules will both require and standardize climate-based
reporting as a core part of a company’s fiduciary duty.
</p>
<p>
From almost the
<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-46" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">moment
it appeared</a>, the proposal has been the center of a lobbying
firestorm. Some of the rule’s opponents write it off as part of an
activist agenda — an indirect route to economy-wide carbon regulations.
“The host of new requirements in this Proposed Rule are motivated by a
small number of environmental activists who seek to steer the economy
away from fossil fuels,” wrote twelve Republican attorneys general in
<a href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/sites/default/files/global/Texas%20Comment%20Letter%20re%20SEC%20Proposed%20Rules%20(Final%206.17.2022).pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a
letter to the SEC</a> responding to the proposal. The U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, meanwhile,
<a href="https://www.uschamber.com/finance/corporate-governance/effective-material-corporate-disclosure-is-the-cornerstone-of-u-s-capital-markets#:~:text=The%20Chamber%20is%20committed%20to,investor%20decision%2Dmaking%20as%20investors" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">vowed</a>
to fight back against “unlawful and excessive government overreach.” (At
a Chamber-sponsored event last October, SEC Chair Gary Gensler
<a href="https://tax.thomsonreuters.com/news/gensler-to-u-s-chamber-on-sec-climate-disclosure-rulemaking-wait-are-you-already-suing-us/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">joked</a>,
“Wait, are you already suing us? I just walked in.”)
</p>
<p>
Certainly there are environmentalists who do see the rule as a tool to
undermine the oil and gas industry. But proponents primarily make the
case that the stakes are less about the atmosphere and more about
protecting investors and the entirety of the financial system.
</p>
<p>
While we’re still waiting on the final rule — which was
<a href="https://tax.thomsonreuters.com/news/sec-delays-climate-change-disclosure-rulemaking/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">originally
expected</a> in the fall of 2022 and has been
<a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/esg/sec-climate-rules-october-release-date-nonsensical-aide-says" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">repeatedly</a>
<a href="https://tax.thomsonreuters.com/news/sec-once-again-delays-action-on-final-climate-disclosure-rule/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">delayed</a>
— here’s a catch-up on what we know so far.
</p>
<h2>
Why is the SEC doing this?
</h2>
<p>
At a basic level, the SEC makes rules saying what companies have to
disclose and how so that investors can make well-informed decisions. The
two types of information this particular rule covers — climate-related
risks and greenhouse gas emissions — are distinct, but related.
</p>
<p>
The former is pretty straightforward. From the
<a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">growing
number of billion-dollar weather- and climate-related disasters</a> in
the United States to the ongoing exodus of insurance companies from fire
and flood-prone areas to trade delays in the drought-stricken Panama
Canal, it’s clear that climate change poses a substantial financial risk
to businesses. It makes sense that investors would want to know how
exposed a company’s warehouses or data centers or trucking routes are to
wildfires and floods.
</p>
<p>
But why should investors care about a company’s emissions? Because they
are an indicator of another type of risk.
</p>
<p>
“A shareholder is not necessarily concerned with whether a company is
‘on target’ with any climate commitment,” Boston University law
professor Madison Condon
<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4396819" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">writes</a>,
“but rather in assessing how exposed an asset may be to changes in
global or local climate policy, energy prices, or shifts in consumer and
investor sentiments.”
</p>
<p>
These changes are already in motion around the world, and are generally
accelerating. Companies that aren’t preparing could be disadvantaged, or
alternatively, could miss lucrative opportunities. Steven Rothstein, a
managing director at the nonprofit Ceres, gave the example of the steel
industry. If you think that, in the next several years, customers are
going to ask for low-emission steel — which some
<a href="https://www.sustainability.gov/buyclean/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">already
are doing</a> — or that there might be a regulatory cost put on
steel-related emissions, then a company with lower emissions will be
better positioned to grow, while a company with higher emissions might
have to spend a bunch of money to retrofit its factories.
</p>
<h2>
Are investors actually asking for this?
</h2>
<p>
Part of the SEC’s rationale for the rule is the proliferation of
investor-led initiatives calling for government-mandated climate risk
disclosure. “These initiatives demonstrate that investors are using
information about climate risks now as part of their investment
selection process and are seeking more informative disclosures about
those risks,” the Commission wrote in its proposal. (Oil giant Exxon
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/business/exxon-climate-change-lawsuit.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">filed
suit</a> against the sponsors of one such proposal in January, having
lost patience with proposals it said were “calculated to diminish the
company’s existing business.”)
</p>
<p>
After the draft rule was released in March 2022, the SEC was bombarded
by thousands of comments from investors, academics, NGOs, politicians,
trade associations, and companies. One
<a href="https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2022/11/23/review-of-comments-on-sec-climate-rulemaking/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">analysis
of those comments</a> by legal researchers found that investors were the
most supportive group, with more than 80% in favor of the rule.
</p>
<h2>
What are the major points of debate?
</h2>
<p>
The most contentious aspect of the proposal invited criticism even from
parties that were generally supportive of the rule. The SEC had taken a
strong stance on emissions reporting, asking companies to disclose
emissions indirectly related to their business, known as“scope 3”
emissions. That means a company like Amazon wouldn’t just have to report
the emissions from its warehouses and delivery trucks, but also an
estimate of the emissions associated with producing and using all the
products it sells. A company like Ford wouldn’t just have to report the
emissions from its factories, but also from the production of the raw
materials it uses, as well as from all the gasoline burned in the cars
it sells.
</p>
<p>
Those in support of scope 3 reporting point to the fact that for many
companies, including the two I just named, the number would vastly
exceed their direct emissions.
</p>
<p>
In a legal review of why scope 3 emissions reporting matters, Condon
warned that without it, companies could begin outsourcing their most
emissions-intensive processes to third parties in order to appear
greener than they actually are. She also argued that leaving out scope 3
obscures climate risks. She gave the example of electric vehicles, which
can involve higher emissions during production than conventional cars
but result in much lower emissions over their lifecycle. “When excluding
Scope 3, an EV manufacturer is penalized, even though from the
perspective of considering transition risk and climate impact, this
makes little sense,” she wrote.
</p>
<p>
But companies and their trade associations threw every excuse at the
idea of a scope 3 requirement: <em>It would cost too much to gather the
data; the data on supply chain emissions is unreliable and impossible to
verify; since companies don’t directly produce these emissions, they
aren’t relevant; etc. </em>
</p>
<p>
And by all accounts, they won. The SEC is expected to
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/us-regulator-drops-some-emissions-disclosure-requirements-draft-climate-rules-2024-02-22/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosgenerate&stream=top" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">drop
requirements to report scope 3 emissions</a> in the final rule.
</p>
<p>
However, that’s unlikely to satisfy opponents, many of whom, like the
Republican attorneys generals who wrote letters to the Commission, say
the SEC doesn’t have the legal authority to require climate-related
disclosures at all. If there’s one thing that critics and supporters
agree on, it’s that the rule, whatever it says, is going to be
challenged in court.
</p>
<h2>
What about the rules in Europe and California?
</h2>
<p>
A lot of companies are going to have to report their scope 3 emissions
anyway. The European Union’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting
Directive includes scope 3 and is expected to cover more than 50,000
companies, with some starting to report as soon as this year; U.S.-based
businesses on EU-regulated exchanges, or with subsidiaries or parent
companies in Europe, will be expected to comply. A similar rule
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/california-climate-corporate-data-accountability-act-financial-risk" target="_self">voted
into law in California last year</a> also requires scope 3 emissions
disclosures and covers any company doing business in the state — whether
private or public — giving it broader reach than the SEC. However,
Governor Gavin Newsom did not include any funding for the law in his
budget proposal this year, creating concern that it will be delayed.
</p>
<p>
Danny Cullenward, a climate economist and legal expert, said the fate of
the California regulations are important in light of the likely Supreme
Court challenge to the SEC rule. “It’s a lot harder to mount comparably
broad challenges to state laws on this front,” he told me.
</p>
<h2>
How will this change the climate economy?
</h2>
<p>
Despite the SEC’s narrow focus on protecting investors, the mandatory
disclosure of corporate emissions and climate risks would have
widespread effects — even some that regular people might feel. Suddenly,
consumers would have better tools to compare the relative sustainability
of different companies and products. Activists would have more
documentation to hold companies accountable for greenwashing or failing
to live up to their public climate commitments.
</p>
<p>
The rule is also set to spark an explosion in the businesses of
corporate emissions accounting and climate risk analysis. Most companies
don’t have the staff or expertise to track their emissions, and thus
will have to turn either to
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/corporate-carbon-footprint" target="_self">specialized
climate-specific firms like Watershed</a> or
<a href="https://dart.deloitte.com/USDART/home/publications/deloitte/heads-up/2022/sec-analysis-climate-disclosures" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">all-purpose
corporate accountants like Deloitte</a> to manage the disclosure process
for them. Similarly, analytics giants like
<a href="https://www.moodys.com/web/en/us/capabilities/esg-risk.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Moodys</a>
and
<a href="https://www.spglobal.com/esg/solutions/climanomics" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">S&amp;P
Global</a> will also be called upon to feed company data into climate
models and spit out risk reports.
</p>
<p>
Both exercises come with inherent challenges and uncertainties. Climate
risk researchers have warned that rating services keep their
methodologies in a black box, making it hard to know whether they are
using climate models appropriately. “The misuse of climate models risks
a range of issues, including maladaptation and heightened vulnerability
of business to climate change, an overconfidence in assessments of risk,
material misstatement of risk in financial reports, and the creation of
greenwash,” wrote the authors of a
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-020-00984-6" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2021
article</a> in the journal <em>Nature Climate Change</em>.
</p>
<p>
“When you ask, ‘What is my exposure to future climate risks?,’ you’re
asking for a projection of future climate states and probabilities of
different future climate outcomes and extreme weather events. There’s an
enormous amount of scientific uncertainty and complexity in getting to
that,” Cullenward told me.
</p>
<p>
But while neither emissions accounting nor climate risk assessment may
be perfectly up to the task yet, Cullenward argued that’s all the more
reason for the SEC to get these rules in place.
</p>
<p>
“If you don’t ask people to disclose what’s going on, it’s just sticking
your head in the sand,” he said. “No one will ever know how to do it
perfectly, getting out of the gate. To me that is not a reason to stop
or to slow down, that is a reason to get started.”

<p>date: 2024-02-26, from: RiscOS Story</p>
<p>While the number of people using RISC OS is very small by the
standards of other other operating systems, and by extension the number
of programmers comparatively minuscule, within the community the number
of people programming is – probably, at least – quite high as a
proportion of users. One of the reasons for this is almost certainly the
ease with which it is possible to start programming a RISC OS computer,
with one very popular language supplied out of the box – BBC BASIC is

<p>Chinese strategists continue to be quite fixated on Russian attack
helicopter operations in Ukraine. Helicopters appear to be at the very
heart of any Chinese strategy to conquer Taiwan, since they can provide
both extensive air cover and firepower for amphibious forces coming
ashore and provide transport capabilities to deliver forces further
inland in a hypothetical Taiwan scenario.</p>

id="ex-fbi-informant-charged-with-lying-about-bidens-to-remain-jailed-while-awaiting-trial">Ex-FBI
Informant Charged With Lying About Bidens to Remain Jailed While
Awaiting Trial</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Los Angeles — A former FBI informant charged with fabricating a
multimillion-dollar bribery scheme involving President Joe Biden’s
family must remain behind bars while he awaits trial, a judge ruled
Monday, reversing an earlier order releasing the man.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Otis Wright II in Los Angeles ordered Alexander
Smirnov’s detention after prosecutors raised concerns that the man who
claims to have ties to Russian intelligence could flee the country.</p>
<p>A different judge had released Smirnov from jail on electronic GPS
monitoring after his Feb. 14 arrest, but Wright ordered him to be taken
back into custody last week after prosecutors asked to reconsider
Smirnov’s detention. Wright said in a written order unsealed Friday that
Smirnov’s lawyers’ efforts to free him were “likely to facilitate his
absconding from the United States.”</p>
<p>Smirnov is charged with falsely telling his FBI handler that
executives from the Ukrainian energy company Burisma had paid President
Biden and Hunter Biden $5 million each around 2015. The claim became
central to the Republican impeachment inquiry of President Biden in
Congress.</p>
<p>In urging the judge to keep him in jail, prosecutors revealed Smirnov
has reported to the FBI having extensive contact with officials
associated with Russian intelligence, and claimed that such officials
were involved in passing a story to him about Hunter Biden. Prosecutors
said Smirnov had been planning to travel overseas to multiple countries
days after his Feb. 14 arrest where he said he was meeting with foreign
intelligence contacts.</p>
<p>Smirnov, who holds dual Israeli-U.S. citizenship, is charged by the
same Justice Department special counsel who has separately filed gun and
tax charges against Hunter Biden.</p>
<p>Smirnov has not entered a plea to the charges, but his lawyers have
said they look forward to defending him at trial. Defense attorneys have
said in pushing for his release that he has no criminal history and has
strong ties to the United States, including a longtime significant other
who lives in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>In his ruling last week releasing Smirnov on GPS monitoring, U.S.
Magistrate Judge Daniel Albregts in Las Vegas said he was concerned
about his access to what prosecutors estimate is $6 million in funds,
but noted that federal guidelines required him to fashion “the least
restrictive conditions” ahead of his trial.</p>
<p>Smirnov was re-arrested on Thursday morning while meeting with his
lawyers at their offices in downtown Las Vegas.</p>
<p>In an emergency petition with the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals,
Smirnov’s lawyers said Wright did not have the authority to order
Smirnov to be taken back into custody. The defense also criticized what
it described as “biased and prejudicial statements” from Wright
insinuating that Smirnov’s lawyers were acting improperly by advocating
for his release.</p>
<p>The appeals court on Sunday evening denied Smirnov’s emergency
petition, refusing to block Monday’s hearing or assign the case to a
different judge.</p>
<p>Smirnov had been an informant for more than a decade when he made the
explosive allegations about the Bidens in June 2020, after “expressing
bias” about Joe Biden as a presidential candidate, prosecutors said.
Smirnov had only routine business dealings with Burisma starting in
2017, according to court documents. No evidence has emerged that Joe
Biden acted corruptly or accepted bribes in his current role or previous
office as vice president.</p>
<p>While his identity wasn’t publicly known before the indictment,
Smirnov’s claims have played a major part in the Republican effort in
Congress to investigate the president and his family, and helped spark
what is now a House impeachment inquiry into Biden. Republicans pursuing
investigations of the Bidens demanded the FBI release the unredacted
form documenting the unverified allegations, though they acknowledged
they couldn’t confirm if they were true.</p>

<p>Strikes against state-backed militias like the Houthis degrade these
groups’ military capabilities. But such strikes will almost certainly
not deter the group from launching additional attacks. They could,
however, take key capabilities and leaders off the battlefield,
challenging Iran and the militias it backs to field the same quantity
and quality of attacks in the future.</p>

Lunar Lander Will Stop Working Tuesday</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — A private U.S. lunar lander is expected to
stop working Tuesday, its mission cut short after landing sideways near
the south pole of the moon.</p>
<p>Intuitive Machines, the Houston company that built and flew the
spacecraft, said Monday it will continue to collect data until sunlight
no longer shines on the solar panels. Based on the position of Earth and
the moon, officials expect that to happen Tuesday morning. That’s two to
three days short of the week or so that NASA and other customers had
been counting on.</p>
<p>The lander, named Odysseus, is the first U.S. spacecraft to land on
the moon in more than 50 years, carrying experiments for NASA, the main
sponsor. But it came in too fast last Thursday and the foot of one of
its six legs caught on the surface, causing it to tumble over, according
to company officials.</p>
<p>Based on photos from NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter flying
overhead, Odysseus landed within 1.5 kilometers of its intended target
near the Malapert A crater, just 300 kilometers from the moon’s south
pole.</p>
<p>The LRO photos from 90 kilometers up are the only ones showing the
lander on the surface, but as little more than a spot in the grainy
images. A camera-ejecting experiment by Embry-Riddle Aeronautical
University, to capture images of the lander as they both descended, was
called off shortly before touchdown because of a last-minute navigation
issue.</p>
<p>According to NASA, the lander ended up in a small, degraded crater
with a 12-degree slope. That’s the closest a spacecraft has ever come to
the south pole, an area of interest because of suspected frozen water in
the permanently shadowed craters there.</p>
<p>NASA, which plans to land astronauts in this region in the next few
years, paid Intuitive Machines $118 million to deliver six experiments
to the surface. Other customers also had items on board.</p>
<p>Instead of landing upright, the 4.3-meter Odysseus came down on its
side, hampering communication with Earth. Some antennas were covered up
by the toppled lander, and the ones still exposed ended up near the
ground, resulting in spotty communications. The solar panels also ended
up much closer to the surface than anticipated, less than ideal in the
hilly terrain. Even under the best of circumstances, Odysseus only had a
week to operate on the surface before the long lunar night set in.</p>
<p>Since the 1960s, only the U.S., Russia, China, India and Japan have
successfully pulled off moon landings, and only the U.S. with crews.
Japan’s lander ended up on the wrong side, too, just last month.</p>
<p>Despite its slanted landing, Intuitive Machines became the first
private business to join the elite group. Another U.S. company,
Astrobotic Technology, gave it a try last month, but didn’t make it to
the moon because of a fuel leak.</p>
<p>Intuitive Machines almost failed, too. Ground teams did not turn on
the switch for the lander’s navigating lasers before the Feb. 15 liftoff
from Florida. The oversight was not discovered until Odysseus was
circling the moon, forcing flight controllers to rely on a NASA
laser-navigating device that was on board merely as an experiment.</p>
<p>As it turned out, NASA’s test lasers guided Odysseus to a close to
bull’s-eye landing, resulting in the first moon landing by a U.S.
spacecraft since the Apollo program.</p>
<p>Twelve Apollo astronauts walked on the moon from 1969 through 1972.
While NASA went on to put an occasional satellite around the moon, the
U.S. did not launch another moon-landing mission until last month.
Astrobotic’s failed flight was the first under NASA’s program to promote
commercial deliveries to the moon.</p>
<p>Both Intuitive Machines and Astrobotic hold NASA contracts for more
moon landings.</p>

Couple from Hijacked Catamaran Likely Died After Being Thrown
Overboard</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — An older U.S. couple whose catamaran was
hijacked last week in the Caribbean by three escaped prisoners were
likely thrown into the ocean and died, police in Grenada said
Monday.</p>
<p>The announcement is a blow to those who were independently helping
search for Ralph Hendry and Kathy Brandel and had hoped they were still
alive.</p>
<p>Don McKenzie, police commissioner of the Royal Grenada Police Force,
said at a news conference that the three prisoners escaped on Feb. 18
from the South Saint George Police Station. They hijacked the catamaran
“Simplicity” on Feb. 19 and headed to St. Vincent and the Grenadines,
where they were arrested last Wednesday, he said.</p>
<p>“Information suggests that while traveling between Grenada and
St. Vincent, they disposed of the occupants,” McKenzie said.</p>
<p>When pressed for details, he said, “We have nothing conclusive to say
that the individuals are dead. We still hold out hope that in spite (of)
what might be a low probability, that they would turn up alive
somewhere.”</p>
<p>He noted that he was “quite limited” with what he could share with
the public regarding the case because the investigation is ongoing, and
because Grenadian authorities still don’t have much information.</p>
<p>“The information I possess is limited and can be considered
second-hand as I have had very limited discussions regarding the details
of the investigation with my Vincentian counterpart,” McKenzie said.</p>
<p>St. Vincent police could not be immediately reached for comment.</p>
<p>The nonprofit Salty Dawg Sailing Association said Hendry and Brandel
were “veteran cruisers” and longtime members of the association, calling
them “warm-hearted and capable.”</p>
<p>It said the couple had sailed the yacht in last year’s Caribbean
Rally from Hampton, Virginia, to Antigua, and were spending the winter
cruising in the eastern Caribbean.</p>
<p>A son of Hendry and a son of Brandel did not immediately return
messages for comment.</p>
<p>A GoFundMe page created to raise money for the couple’s family noted
that Brandel had recently become a first-time grandmother, and that the
sailing community was “shattered” by what happened.</p>
<p>“Kathy and Ralph, experienced adventurers, spent their retirement
sailing aboard Simplicity, spending summers in New England and embracing
the warmth of Caribbean winters,” the page stated.</p>
<p>McKenzie, Grenada’s police commissioner, said a five-person team was
sent to St. Vincent to help with the investigation.</p>
<p>After his brief announcement Monday, McKenzie and other police
officials took questions from local media, including one reporter who
asked, “Who is really to be blamed for this massive failure to keep
these prisoners under the control of the (Royal Grenada Police Force)
which has now resulted in this tragedy?”</p>
<p>McKenzie said police have launched an investigation into the escape
and are looking into whether it was “a system failure” or a case of a
“slip up.”</p>
<p>“All aspects of that investigation are on the table,” he said, adding
that the police holding station where the three men were being held has
“sufficient safety to prevent an incident like that (from)
occurring.” </p>
<p>When the reporter asked why the three men who were arrested remained
in a holding cell instead of prison, Vannie Curwen, assistant police
commissioner, said the men first had to see a magistrate who would
decide whether to grant bail or order them remanded.</p>
<p>The escaped prisoners, ages 19, 25 and 30, were charged a couple of
months ago with one count of robbery with violence. The eldest inmate
also was charged with one count of rape, three counts of attempted rape
and two counts of indecent assault and causing harm, police in Grenada
said.</p>

<h2 id="pluralistic-incomplete-vs.-overshoot-26-feb-2024">Pluralistic:
Incomplete vs. overshoot (26 Feb 2024)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-26, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links Incomplete vs. overshoot: The horseshoe theory is
really, really wrong. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day
in history: 2004, 2009, 2014, 2019, 2023 Colophon: Recent publications,
upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading
Incomplete vs. overshoot (permalink) You know the “horseshoe theory,”
right? “The far-left and the far-right, rather than being at opposite
and opposing ends of a linear continuum of the political spectrum,
closely resemble each other, analogous to the way that the opposite ends
of a horseshoe are close together”:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseshoe_theory It’s a theory that only
makes sense if you don’t know much about the right and the left and what
each side wants out of politics. Take women’s suffrage. The early
suffragists (“suffragettes” in the UK) were mostly interested in votes
for affluent, white women – not women as a body. Today’s left criticizes
the suffrage movement on the basis that they didn’t go far enough:
https://www.npr.org/2011/03/25/134849480/the-root-how-racism-tainted-womens-suffrage
Contrast that with Christian Dominionists – the cranks who think that
embryos are people (though presumably not for the purpose of calculating
a state’s electoral college vote? Though it would be cool if
presidential elections turned on which side of a state line a fertility
clinic’s chest-freezer rested on):
https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/otm/segments/how-alabama-ivf-ruling-was-influenced-christian-nationalism-on-the-media?tab=summary
These people are part of a far-right coalition that wants to abolish
votes for women. As billionaire far-right bagman Peter Thiel wrote that
he thought it was a mistake to let women vote at all:
https://www.cato-unbound.org/2009/04/13/peter-thiel/education-libertarian/
Superficially, there’s some horseshoe theory action going on here. The
left thinks the suffragists were wrong. The right thinks they were
wrong, too. Therefore, the left and the right agree! Well, they agree
that the suffragists were wrong, but for opposite reasons – and far, far
more importantly, they totally disagree about what they want. The right
wants a world where no women can vote. The left wants a world where all
women can vote. The idea that the right and the left agree on women’s
suffrage is, as the physicists say, “not even wrong.” It’s the kind of
wrong that can only be captured by citing scripture, specifically, A
Fish Called Wanda, 6E, 79: “The central message of Buddhism is not
‘Every man for himself.’ And the London Underground is not a political
movement. Those are all mistakes, Otto. I looked them up.” Or take the
New Deal. While the New Deal set its sites on liberating workers from
precarity, abuse and corruption, the Dealers – like the suffragists –
had huge gaps in their program, omitting people of color, indigenous
people, women, queer people, etc. There are lots of leftists who
criticize the New Deal on this basis: it didn’t go far enough:
https://livingnewdeal.org/new-deal-and-race/ But for the past 40 years,
America has seen a sustained, vicious assault on New Deal programs, from
Social Security to Medicare to food stamps to labor rights to national
parks, funded by billionaires who want to bring back the Gilded Age and
turn us all into forelock-tugging plebs:
https://pluralistic.net/2022/11/06/the-end-of-the-road-to-serfdom/ If
you only view politics as a game of elementary school cliques, you might
say that the left and the right are meeting again. The left says
Roosevelt got it wrong with the New Deal (because he left out so many
people). The right says FDR was wrong for doing the New Deal in the
first place. Therefore, the left and the right agree, right? Obviously
wrong. Obviously. Again, the important thing is why the left and the
right think the New Deal deserves criticism. The important thing is what
the left and the right want. The left wants universal liberation. The
right wants us all in economic chains. They do not agree. It’s not
always just politics, either. Take the old, good internet. That was an
internet defined by technological self-determination, a wild and wooly
internet where there were few gatekeepers, where disfavored groups could
find each other and make common cause, where users who were threatened
by the greed of the shareholders behind big services could install
blockers, mods, alternative clients and other “adversarial
interoperability” tools that seized the means of computation. Today’s
enshitternet – “five giant websites, filled with screenshots of the
other four” (h/t Tom Eastman) – is orders of magnitude more populous
than that old, good internet. The enshitternet has billions of users,
and they are legally – and technologically – prevented from taking any
self-help measures when the owners of services change them to shift
value from users to themselves:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/19/twiddler/ The anti-enshittification
movement rightly criticizes the old, good internet because it wasn’t
inclusive enough. It was a system almost exclusively hospitable to
affluent, privileged people – the people who least needed the liberatory
power of technology. Likewise pro-enshittification monopolists –
billionaires and their useful idiots – deplore the old, good internet
because it gave its users too much power. For them, ad-blocking,
alternative clients, mods, reverse-engineering and so on were all bugs,
not features. For them, the enshitternet is great because businesses can
literally criminalize taking action to protect yourself from their
predatory impulses:
https://pluralistic.net/2022/10/20/benevolent-dictators/#felony-contempt-of-business-model
Superficially, it seems like the pro- and anti-enshittification forces
agree – they both agree that the old, good internet was a mistake. But
the difference that matters here is that the pro-enshittification side
wants everyone mired in the enshitternet forever, living with what Jay
Freeman calls “Felony contempt of business-model.” By contrast, the
disenshittification side wants a new, good internet that gives every
user – not just a handful of techies – the power to decide how the
digital systems they work use, and to be able to alter or reconfigure
them to suit their own needs. The horsehoe theory only makes sense if
you don’t take into account the beliefs and goals of each side. Politics
aren’t just a matter of who you agree with on a given issue – the real
issue is what you’re trying to accomplish. Hey look at this (permalink)

Supreme Court Weighs Florida, Texas Laws Regulating Social Media
Companies</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday explored free speech
rights in the digital age in a pair of cases testing the legality of
Republican-backed laws in Florida and Texas that restrict the ability of
social media platforms to curb content that these companies deem
objectionable. </p>
<p>Arguments before the justices were ongoing. </p>
<p>At issue is whether these 2021 state laws regulating
content-moderation practices by large social media platforms violate the
free speech protections for the companies under the U.S. Constitution’s
First Amendment. Lower courts split on the issue, blocking key
provisions of Florida’s law while upholding the Texas measure. </p>
<p>Conservative Chief Justice John Roberts asked a lawyer for Florida
about First Amendment concerns about “the state regulating what we have
called the modern public square.” </p>
<p>The laws were challenged by tech industry trade groups NetChoice and
the Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association (CCIA), whose
members include Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Alphabet’s Google, which
owns YouTube, as well as TikTok and Snapchat owner Snap. </p>
<p>Neither law has gone into effect due to the litigation. </p>
<p>The justices must decide whether the First Amendment protects the
editorial discretion of the social media platforms and prohibits
governments from forcing companies to publish content against their
will. The companies have said that without such discretion - including
the ability to block or remove content or users, prioritize certain
posts over others, or include additional context - their websites would
be overrun with spam, bullying, extremism and hate speech. </p>
<p>Another issue for the justices is whether the state laws unlawfully
burden the free speech rights of social media companies by requiring
them to provide users with individualized explanations for certain
content-moderation decisions, including the removal of posts from their
platforms. </p>
<p>President Joe Biden’s administration, which opposes the Florida and
Texas laws, has argued that the content-moderation restrictions violate
the First Amendment by forcing platforms to present and promote content
they view as objectionable. </p>
<p>Officials from Florida and Texas have countered that the
content-moderation actions by these companies fall outside the
protection of the First Amendment because such conduct - which they deem
“censorship” - is not itself speech. </p>
<p>Conservative critics of “Big Tech” companies have cited as an example
of what they called censorship the decision by the platform previously
called Twitter to suspend then-President Donald Trump shortly after the
Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by his supporters, with the
company citing “the risk of further incitement of violence.” Trump’s
account has since been reinstated under Elon Musk, who now owns the
company that was renamed X. </p>
<p>In signing the law in 2021, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said, “Many
in our state have experienced censorship and other tyrannical behavior
firsthand in Cuba and Venezuela. If Big Tech censors enforce rules
inconsistently, to discriminate in favor of the dominant Silicon Valley
ideology, they will now be held accountable.” </p>
<p>Florida’s law requires large platforms to “host some speech that they
might otherwise prefer not to host” by prohibiting the censorship or
banning of a political candidate or “journalistic enterprise.” </p>
<p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott, in signing the law in 2021, said, “There
is a dangerous movement by some social media companies to silence
conservative ideas and values. This is wrong and we will not allow it in
Texas.” </p>
<p>The Texas law forbids social media companies with at least 50 million
monthly active users from acting to “censor” users based on “viewpoint,”
and allows either users or the Texas attorney general to sue to enforce
it. </p>
<p>Florida is seeking to revive its law after the Atlanta-based 11th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled largely against it. The industry
groups are appealing a decision by the New Orleans-based 5th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals upholding the Texas law, which the Supreme
Court blocked at an earlier stage of the case, with liberal Justice
Elena Kagan and three of the court’s more conservative justices in
dissent.</p>

Appeals $454 Million Judgment in New York Civil Fraud Case</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — Donald Trump has appealed his $454 million New York civil
fraud judgment, challenging a judge’s finding that Trump lied about his
wealth as he grew the real estate empire that launched him to stardom
and the presidency.</p>
<p>The former president’s lawyers filed a notice of appeal Monday asking
the state’s mid-level appeals court to overturn Judge Arthur Engoron’s
Feb. 16 verdict in Attorney General Letitia James’ lawsuit.</p>
<p>Trump’s lawyers wrote in court papers that they’re asking the appeals
court to decide whether Engoron “committed errors of law and/or fact”
and whether he abused his discretion and/or his jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Engoron found that Trump, his company and top executives, including
his sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr., schemed for years to deceive banks
and insurers by inflating his wealth on financial statements used to
secure loans and make deals. Among other penalties, the judge put strict
limitations on the ability of Trump’s company, the Trump Organization,
to do business.</p>
<p>The appeal ensures that the legal fight over Trump’s business
practices will persist into the thick of the presidential primary
season, and likely beyond, as he tries to clinch the Republican
presidential nomination in his quest to retake the White House.</p>
<p>If upheld, Engoron’s ruling will force Trump to give up a sizable
chunk of his fortune. Engoron ordered Trump to pay $355 million in
penalties, but with interest the total has grown to nearly $454 million.
That total will increase by nearly $112,000 per day until he pays.</p>

from Fannie May examined a Texas law, enacted in 2019 after Hurricane

<li>First U.S. Jeep EV coming soon
</h3>
<p>
<strong></strong>Eco-conscious Jeep lovers have been waiting patiently
for a fully-electric version of their favorite vehicle, and their wait
will soon be over. Jeep’s first EV – the Wagoneer S SUV – is entering
production in the second quarter of 2024 and could be delivered to

by the end of the year. Stellantis-owned Jeep saw a 6% drop in U.S.
sales last year, and is slashing prices on some of its best selling
vehicles to combat the dip. It is no doubt hoping the EV push will help
turn things around. “They’ve suddenly got a lot more competition than
they traditionally have had,” Sam Abuelsamid, an e-mobility analyst at
market research firm Guidehouse Inc., told <em>The Detroit News</em>.
“There’s certainly opportunity for them to grow their share, but it’s
not going to be easy.”

Piles of tires were set on fire and manure was dumped onto the streets.
Some tractors plowed through barricades. Police fired water cannons.
Farmers across Europe have been protesting for weeks, demanding that

a 2030 goal</a> of reducing its Scope 3 emissions – six years early.
Through the company’s “Project Gigaton” initiative, Walmart suppliers
have removed 1 billion metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions from
their value chains by reducing emissions, sequestering them, or avoiding
them altogether. Project Gigaton launched in 2017. It’s a voluntary
program that asks suppliers to set science-based emissions reduction
targets in areas like waste, packaging, energy use, and transportation.
Nearly 6,000 suppliers have signed up, and nearly 75% of net U.S. sales
now come from Project Gigaton suppliers,

Chinese phone maker TECNO is the latest company making a play for the
handheld gaming PC. But the company’s new TECNO Pocket GO is a little
different from… anything else on the market. That’s because instead of a
small screen surrounded by a set of controllers, the handheld itself
looks like a somewhat chunky game controller […]

Announces Post-Quantum Encryption Algorithms for iMessage</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-26, updated: 2024-02-23, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Apple announced
<a href="https://security.apple.com/blog/imessage-pq3/">PQ3</a>, its
post-quantum encryption standard based on the
<a href="https://pq-crystals.org/kyber/">Kyber</a> secure
key-encapsulation protocol, one of the post-quantum algorithms
<a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/post-quantum-cryptography/selected-algorithms-2022">selected</a>
by NIST in 2022.
</p>
<p>
There’s a lot of detail in the Apple
<a href="https://security.apple.com/blog/imessage-pq3/">blog post</a>,
and more in Douglas Stabila’s
<a href="https://security.apple.com/assets/files/Security_analysis_of_the_iMessage_PQ3_protocol_Stebila.pdf">security
analysis</a>.
</p>
<p>
I am of two minds about this. On the one hand, it’s probably premature
to switch to any particular post-quantum algorithms. The mathematics of
cryptanalysis for these lattice and other systems is still rapidly
evolving, and we’re likely to break more of them—and learn a lot in the
process—over the coming few years. But if you’re going to make the
switch, this is an excellent choice. And Apple’s ability to do this so
efficiently speaks well about its algorithmic agility, which is probably
more important than its particular cryptographic design. And it is
probably about the right time to worry about, and defend against,
attackers who are storing encrypted messages in hopes of breaking them
later on future quantum computers…

Ukraine and free Russia: Countering Putin requires concerted action</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-26, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Saturday marks the two-year anniversary of Russian despot Vladimir Putin&amp;#8217;s invasion of Ukraine, after Moscow&amp;#8217;s military forces took control of Eastern Ukraine and Crimea in 2014. When he launched his &amp;#8220;special military operation&amp;#8221; in 2022, Putin expected his tanks to roll into Kyiv within days, a proof of concept for his vision of a reconstituted Soviet Union.&lt;/p&gt;

and Dancers Parade Through Manhattan’s Chinatown for Lunar New Year</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — Dragons took a starring role at the Lunar New Year parade
in Manhattan’s historic Chinatown on Sunday — it’s the Year of the
Dragon, after all — as hundreds of revelers filled the cold clear air
with the sound of drums, cymbals and puffs of confetti.</p>
<p>Lions and red lanterns were interspersed with around a dozen groups
displaying traditional dragon puppets, which stretched up to 20 meters
(65 feet) long, in interconnected segments held by up to 11 people
walking beneath.</p>
<p>Two people also held up a giant golden picture frame with the Chinese
character for “Dragon” on a red background.</p>
<p>Other staples of the parade included waves of red lanterns, a file of
classic cars, as well as formations by local civic organizations,
businesses, New York City agencies, and politicians. Many marchers
yelled “Happy New Year” in English, mixing in traditional greetings in
Mandarin and Cantonese wishing financial prosperity.</p>
<p>Asian communities across the world started ringing in the Lunar New
Year on Feb 10, celebrating the Year of the Dragon in the Chinese
zodiac. Fireworks, parades and other Lunar New Year rituals are centered
around removing bad luck and welcoming prosperity.</p>
<p>In New York, there have already been major celebrations in larger
Chinese immigrant enclaves in Queens and Brooklyn. While the symbolic
new lunar cycle ended earlier this week with the full moon, Manhattan’s
parade was scheduled for the weekend.</p>

id="kayakers-paddle-in-death-valley-after-rains-replenish-lake">Kayakers
Paddle in Death Valley After Rains Replenish Lake</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>DEATH VALLEY NATIONAL PARK, Calif — Kayakers have been paddling in
one of the driest places on Earth after a series of record rainstorms
battered California’s Death Valley and replenished Lake Manly.</p>
<p>Park Ranger Nichole Andler said Badwater Basin at Death Valley
National Park, which runs along part of central California’s border with
Nevada, “is normally a very beautiful, bright white salt flat.”</p>
<p>This year it is a lake.</p>
<p>In the past six months, Death Valley has received more than double
its annual rainfall amount, recording more than 12.45 centimeters (4.9
inches) compared to a typical year that gets about 5.08 centimeters (2
inches). Temperatures at or above 54.44 C (130 F) have only been
recorded on Earth a handful of times, mostly in Death Valley.</p>
<p>Badwater Basin is the lowest point in North America at 85.95 meters
(282 feet) below sea level and has been a favored spot for tourists to
take selfies and briefly walk along the white salt flats ringed by
sandy-colored mountains.</p>
<p>“It’s the lowest point, in North America. So it’s going to collect
water, but to have as much water as we have now — and for it to be as
deep and lasting as long as it has — this is extremely uncommon,” Andler
said. “If it’s not once-in-a-lifetime, it’s nearly.”</p>
<p>Andler said kayakers should come soon since water levels are expected
to drop in a matter of weeks, though the lake “will probably be here
into April. If we’re lucky, May. And then it’ll be a muddy, wet mess,
and then it’ll dry out into those gorgeous white salt flats.”</p>
<p>On Thursday, Heather Gang of Pahrump, Nevada, and her husband, Bob,
were among hundreds of visitors playing in the water. Most waded into
the lake, though the couple and others paddled where the water reached
up to about a foot (0.3 meters) deep in parts.</p>
<p>“It’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to kayak Lake Manley,” Heather
Gang said.</p>
<p>It was a sharp contrast to the Death Valley of the past where they
figured they had once stood around the same spot and looked at the
chalky salt flats for as far as the eye could see.</p>
<p>The couple has been eyeing the lake’s evolution ever since last
year’s storms started filling the lake. In the fall, they drove out to
see it re-emerge as a lake but they said it wasn’t deep enough for
kayaks like now. This time the water reached up to the boardwalk.</p>
<p>The lake, which is currently about 9.66 kilometers long and 4.83
kilometers wide, is still nowhere near its original state thousands of
years ago after it formed during the Ice Age and covered a significant
part of the park and was several hundred feet deep.</p>
<p>Bob Gang said he had heard the lake had filled up to the point that
boaters could go on it about 20 years ago, so he didn’t want to miss out
on the experience this time.</p>
<p>“It’s a lot of fun,” said Bob Gang, who gave a girl a ride on his
kayak. “It’s good to see the little kids out here enjoying this and
seeing something totally unique.”</p>
<p>It could be another 20 years before boaters return, he added, but
“with climate change, who knows, maybe this will be the normal.”</p>
<p>Guo Yu, an assistant research professor of hydrometeorology at the
Nevada-based Desert Research Institute, said the lake’s size is a
“simple natural phenomenon.”</p>
<p>It’s linked to a wet winter from a strong El Nino — a natural and
occasional warming of part of the Pacific Ocean that can lead to more
precipitation than usual in California — plus climate change, which
brings more intense atmospheric rivers to the area more frequently, Yu
said.</p>
<p>Scientists need to study Lake Manly now, he said, to see if they can
harness the water for other uses in the future, such as drinking water
throughout the dry Southwest.</p>
<p>Tiffany Pereira, an associate research scientist at the institute,
said the lake’s size now can be beneficial to local flora and fauna.</p>
<p>Certain seed species endemic to the area, meaning they only naturally
exist in Death Valley, have lain dormant for a decade or more and are
now beginning their short-lived life cycle because there is enough water
to sustain them.</p>
<p>“They hang out, they do their thing, and as soon as it dries up,
that’s it. They’re done,” she said.</p>
<p>For now, friends Trudell Artiglere and Sheri Dee Hopper of Las Vegas
will enjoy paddling through the lake. At the end of the day on Thursday,
Artiglere said, their salt-encrusted kayaks looked like “glazed

Airman Dies After Setting Himself Afire Outside Israeli Embassy in
Washington</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — A U.S. military service member who had set himself on
fire outside the Israeli Embassy in Washington over the weekend, in an
apparent act of protest against the war in Gaza, has died, local police
said Monday. </p>
<p>Officer Lee Lepe, a spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police
Department, confirmed the U.S. airman’s death.  </p>
<p>The Pentagon said that the death was a “tragic event” and that U.S.
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was following the situation.</p>
<p>Pentagon spokesperson Major General Patrick Ryder told reporters that
he was not aware of any other acts of protest by service members against
the war.  </p>
<p>The U.S. airman was hospitalized in critical condition on Sunday
after U.S. Secret Service officers put out the flames, D.C. Fire and EMS
had said earlier. </p>
<p>The man, wearing military fatigues, broadcast the incident live over
the internet. </p>
<p>“I will no longer be complicit in genocide,” the man said before
dousing himself in a clear liquid and setting himself on fire,
screaming, “Free Palestine,” according to a video seen by Reuters. </p>
<p>The latest incident came amid pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli
protests in the United States following Hamas’ October 7 attack on
Israel that killed 1,200 Israelis in a cross-border attack. About 240
people were taken hostage. </p>
<p>Israeli forces then waged a military campaign against the Palestinian
Islamist group that rules Gaza, destroying much of the coastal enclave,
with nearly 30,000 people confirmed killed, according to Palestinian
health officials. </p>
<p>Israel’s embassies have drawn continued protests against the war. In
December, a woman protesting the war set herself on fire outside the
Israeli Consulate in Atlanta.</p>

id="biden-to-summon-congressional-leaders-to-discuss-ukraine-government-funding">Biden
to Summon Congressional Leaders to Discuss Ukraine, Government
Funding</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — President Joe Biden will convene the top four
congressional leaders at the White House on Tuesday to press lawmakers
on passing an emergency aid package for Ukraine and Israel, as well as
averting a looming government shutdown next month, according to a White
House official.</p>
<p>The top four leaders include Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson,
Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, Democratic House
Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, and Republican Senate Minority Leader
Mitch McConnell.</p>
<p>During the meeting, the president will discuss the “urgency” of
passing the aid package, which has bipartisan support, as well as
legislation to keep the federal government operating through the end of
September, said the White House official, who was granted anonymity to
discuss a meeting not yet publicly confirmed.</p>
<p>The Republican-led House is under pressure to pass the $95 billion
national security package that bolsters aid for Ukraine, Israel as well
as the Indo-Pacific. That legislation cleared the Senate on a 70-29 vote
earlier this month, but Johnson has been resistant to put the aid bill
up for a vote in the House.</p>
<p>“This is one of those instances where one person can bend the course
of history. Speaker Johnson, if he put this bill on the floor, would
produce a strong, bipartisan majority vote in favor of the aid to
Ukraine,” Jake Sullivan, the White House national security adviser, said
Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.”</p>
<p>Sullivan stressed that Ukrainians need weapons and ammunition to fend
off Russian forces, and that in his personal conversations with the
speaker, he “has indicated that he would like to get the funding for
Ukraine.”</p>
<p>Separate from the national security package, the first tranche of
government funding is due to expire Friday. The rest of the federal
government, including agencies such as the Pentagon, Department of
Homeland Security and the State Department, expires on March 8.</p>
<p>In a letter to his colleagues sent Sunday, Schumer said there was not
yet an agreement to avoid a partial shutdown of the agencies whose
funding expires this week. That includes the departments of
Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, Agriculture and Veterans
Affairs.</p>
<p>“While we had hoped to have legislation ready this weekend that would
give ample time for members to review the text, it is clear now that
House Republicans need more time to sort themselves out,” Schumer wrote
in the letter. The Senate majority leader called on Johnson to “step up
to once again, buck the extremists in his caucus, and do the right
thing” by greenlighting funding to keep the government open.</p>
