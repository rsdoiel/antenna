<h2 id="head-of-us-deposit-insurance-agency-to-step-down">Head of US
deposit insurance agency to step down</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>new york — The White House said Monday that the chairman of the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation would step down, a departure that
will follow the release this month of a damning report about the
agency’s toxic workplace culture.</p>
<p>The White House said Martin Gruenberg would step down once a
successor was appointed and that President Joe Biden would name a
replacement “soon.” The announcement came after the top Democrat on the
Senate Banking Committee earlier Monday called for Gruenberg’s
removal.</p>
<p>Biden expects the FDIC “to reflect the values of decency and
integrity and to protect the rights and dignity of all employees,”
deputy press secretary Sam Michel said in a statement.</p>
<p>The FDIC is one of several U.S. banking system regulators. The Great
Depression-era agency is best known for running the nation’s deposit
insurance program, which insures Americans’ deposits up to $250,000 in
case their banks fail.</p>
<p>Before Monday, no Democrats had called for Gruenberg’s ouster,
although several came very close to doing so. But Senator Sherrod Brown,
the top Democrat on the Banking Committee, who is facing a tough
reelection campaign, issued a statement Monday calling for Gruenberg to
step down, saying his leadership at the FDIC could no longer be
trusted.</p>
<p>Gruenberg was grilled for two days last week on Capitol Hill in
hearings largely focused on the FDIC’s workplace culture and the
failures disclosed in the report prepared by an outside law firm.</p>
<p>“After chairing last week’s hearing, reviewing the independent report
and receiving further outreach from FDIC employees … , I am left with
one conclusion: There must be fundamental changes at the FDIC,” Brown
said in a statement.</p>
<p>Republicans have been calling for Gruenberg’s ouster for some time
and criticized the White House for not calling for his immediate
departure.</p>
<p>Gruenberg has held various leadership positions at the FDIC for
nearly 20 years, and this was his second full term as FDIC chair. His
long tenure at the agency made him largely responsible for the agency’s
toxic work environment, according to the report outlining the problems
at the agency.</p>
<p>The report released last Tuesday by law firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen
&amp; Hamilton cites incidents of stalking, harassment, homophobia and
other violations of employment regulations, based on more than 500
complaints from employees.</p>
<p>Among the complaints: a woman said she was stalked by a coworker and
continually harassed even after complaining about his behavior; a field
office supervisor referred to gay men as “little girls”; and a female
field examiner  described receiving a picture of an FDIC senior
examiner’s private parts.</p>

<h2 id="xeon-phi-support-removed-in-gcc-15-compiler">Xeon Phi support
removed in GCC 15 compiler</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-20, from: OS News</p>
<p>Last week I wrote about Intel aiming to remove Xeon Phi support in
GCC 15 with the products being end-of-life and deprecated in GCC 14.
While some openly wondered whether the open-source community would allow
it given the Xeon Phi accelerators were available to buy just a few
years ago and at some very low prices going back years so some
potentially finding use still out of them especially during this AI boom
(and still readily available to buy used for around ~$50 USD), today the
Intel Xeon Phi support was indeed removed. ↫ Michael Larabel Xeon Phi
PCIe cards are incredibly cheap on eBay, and every now and then my mouse
hovers over the buy button – but I always realise just in time that the
cards have become quite difficult to use, since support for them,
already sparse to begin with, is only getting worse by the day. Support
for them was already removed in Linux 5.10, and now GCC is pulling he
plug too, so the only option is to keep using old kernels, or pass the
card on to a VM running an older Linux kernel version, which is a lot of
headache for what is essentially a weird toy for nerds at this point.
GCC 15 will also, sadly, remove support for Itanium, which, as I’ve said
before, is a huge disgrace and a grave mistake. Itanium is the future,
and will stomp all over crappy architectures like x86 and ARM. With this
deprecation, GCC relegates itself to the dustbin of history.</p>

<h2 id="modernizing-the-antennapod-code-structure">Modernizing the
AntennaPod code structure</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-20, from: OS News</p>
<p>AntennaPod has been around for a long time – the first bit of code
was published in 2011. Since then, the app has grown massively and had
several main developers. The beauty of open-source is that so many
people can contribute and make a great app together. But sometimes
having many people work on a project can lead to different ways of
thinking about how to structure the project. Because of this, AntennaPod
gradually grew to have a number of weird code constructs. Our latest
release, version 3.4, fixes this. ↫ ByteHamster The AntennaPod team had
an incredible task ahead of itself, and while it took them a few years,
they pulled it off. The code structure graphs from before and after the
code restructuring illustrate better than words ever could what they
achieved. Thy changed 10000 lines of source code in 62 pull requests for
this restructuring alone, while still adding new major features in the
meantime. Pretty incredible.</p>

id="microsoft-gives-windows-new-compiler-kernel-scheduler-and-x86-translation-layer-on-arm">Microsoft
gives Windows new compiler, kernel, scheduler, and x86 translation layer
on ARM</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-20, from: OS News</p>
<p>Microsoft’s developer conference Build is taking place this week, so
there’s been some major Windows news and announcements, and for once –
we’re not talking about more ads in your operating system, or even “AI”
shoehorned into, I don’t know, Phone Dialer or Windows Fax and Scan.
First and foremost, Windows is going to get a new compiler, kernel, and
scheduler, but despite such massive low-level changes, the marketing
version number won’t jump from 11 to 12. Of course, we all know the
marketing version number has nothing to do with the actual Windows NT
version number, which currently sits at 10. The Windows NT version
number, meanwhile, is actually also meaningless, since it magically
jumps around left and right too, going from 6.2 to 10 between Windows
8.1 and Windows 10, where it has stayed ever since. “We really focused
on modernizing this update of Windows 11,” said Microsoft Corporate Vice
President of Windows and Devices Pavan Davuluri at a technical briefing
on Microsoft’s campus in mid-April. “We engineered this update of
Windows 11 with a real focus on AI inference and taking advantage of the
Arm64 instruction set at every layer of the operating system stack. For
us, what this meant really was building a new compiler in Windows. We
built a new kernel in Windows on top of that compiler. We now have new
schedulers in the operating system that take advantage of these new SoC
architecture.” ↫ Andrew Cunningham at Ars Technica The focus is clearly
on ARM here, which coincides with the launch of Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X
Elite, a new SoC that finally seems to truly make ARM laptops that
aren’t from Apple a real, competitive thing – so much so that Qualcomm
is even breaking with tradition and taking Linux support very seriously
for this new chip. Microsoft also unveiled the name for its new x86
translation layer for Windows on ARM: Prism. Microsoft told Ars Technica
that Prism is as fast as Apple’s Rosetta 2, which is interesting because
Apple’s M series chips contain special silicon to speed up the
translation process, making me wonder if Qualcomm has done the same, or
is just brute-forcing it. Performance like this means the apps customers
love work great. Microsoft has partnered closely with developers across
the globe to optimize their applications for this processor. In
addition, the powerful new Prism emulation engine delivers a 2x
performance boost compared to Surface Pro 9 with 5G. On the new Surface
Pro and Surface Laptop, powered by Snapdragon X Elite and Snapdragon X
Plus processors, experiences like Adobe Creative Cloud, Microsoft 365
and Chrome will feel snappy, quick and responsive. ↫ Pete Kyriacou on
the Windows blog The new Windows on ARM machines using the Snapdragon X
Elite will be marketed under the new Copilot+ brand name, which brings
with it some requirements, the biggest of which is the neural processing
unit: it must be capable of at least 40 trillion operations per second.
At the time of writing, the only Windows-capable processor that can
boast such numbers is, of course, the new Snapdragon X Elite. AMD and
Intel need not apply. They simply cannot match this. Microsoft tied a
bow on all this stuff by unveiling the new Surface Pro and new Surface
Laptop, both powered by the new Snapdragon SoCs. You can preorder them
today, but they won’t be available until 18 June.</p>

<h2 id="us-agency-warns-of-increasing-cyberattacks-on-water-systems">US
agency warns of increasing cyberattacks on water systems</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — Cyberattacks against U.S. water utilities are becoming
more frequent and more severe, the Environmental Protection Agency
warned Monday as it issued an enforcement alert urging water systems to
take immediate protective action. </p>
<p>About 70% of utilities inspected by federal officials over the last
year violated standards meant to prevent breaches or other intrusions,
the agency said. Officials urged even small water systems to improve
protections against hacks. Recent cyberattacks by groups affiliated with
Russia and Iran have targeted smaller communities. </p>
<p>Some water systems are falling short in basic ways, the alert said,
including failure to change default passwords or cut off system access
to former employees. Because water utilities often rely on computer
software to operate treatment plants and distribution systems,
protecting information technology and process controls is crucial, the
EPA said.</p>
<p>Possible impacts of cyberattacks include interruptions to water
treatment and storage; damage to pumps and valves; and alteration of
chemical levels to hazardous amounts, the agency said. </p>
<p>“In many cases, systems are not doing what they are supposed to be
doing, which is to have completed a risk assessment of their
vulnerabilities that includes cybersecurity and to make sure that plan
is available and informing the way they do business,” said EPA Deputy
Administrator Janet McCabe. </p>
<p>Attempts by private groups or individuals to get into a water
provider’s network and take down or deface websites aren’t new. More
recently, however, attackers have targeted utilities’ operations. </p>
<p>Geopolitical rivals</p>
<p>Recent attacks are not just by private entities. Some recent hacks of
water utilities are linked to geopolitical rivals and could lead to the
disruption of the supply of safe water to homes and businesses. </p>
<p>McCabe named China, Russia and Iran as the countries that are
“actively seeking the capability to disable U.S. critical
infrastructure, including water and wastewater.” </p>
<p>Late last year, an Iranian-linked group called “Cyber Av3ngers”
targeted multiple organizations including a small Pennsylvania town’s
water provider, forcing it to switch from a remote pump to manual
operations. They were going after an Israeli-made device used by the
utility in the wake of Israel’s war against Hamas. </p>
<p>Earlier this year, a Russian-linked “hacktivist” tried to disrupt
operations at several Texas utilities. </p>
<p>A cyber group linked to China and known as Volt Typhoon has
compromised information technology of multiple critical infrastructure
systems, including drinking water, in the United States and its
territories, U.S. officials said. Cybersecurity experts believe the
China-aligned group is positioning itself for potential cyberattacks in
the event of armed conflict or rising geopolitical tensions. </p>
<p>“By working behind the scenes with these hacktivist groups, now these
[nation states] have plausible deniability and they can let these groups
carry out destructive attacks. And that to me is a game changer,” said
Dawn Cappelli, a cybersecurity expert with the risk management firm
Dragos Inc. </p>
<p>The world’s cyberpowers are believed to have been infiltrating
rivals’ critical infrastructure for years, planting malware that could
be triggered to disrupt basic services. </p>
<p>The enforcement alert is meant to emphasize the seriousness of
cyberthreats and inform utilities the EPA will continue its inspections
and pursue civil or criminal penalties if they find serious
problems. </p>
<p>“We want to make sure that we get the word out to people that, ‘Hey,
we are finding a lot of problems here,’” McCabe said. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Broader federal effort</p>
<p>Preventing attacks against water providers is part of the Biden
administration’s broader effort to combat threats against critical
infrastructure. In February, President Joe Biden signed an executive
order to protect U.S. ports. Health care systems have been attacked. The
White House has pushed electric utilities to increase their defenses,
too. EPA Administrator Michael Regan and White House national security
adviser Jake Sullivan have asked states to come up with a plan to combat
cyberattacks on drinking water systems. </p>
<p>“Drinking water and wastewater systems are an attractive target for
cyberattacks because they are a lifeline critical infrastructure sector
but often lack the resources and technical capacity to adopt rigorous
cybersecurity practices,’’ Regan and Sullivan wrote in a March 18 letter
to all 50 U.S. governors. </p>
<p>Some of the fixes are straightforward, McCabe said. Water providers,
for example, shouldn’t use default passwords. They need to develop a
risk assessment plan that addresses cybersecurity and set up backup
systems. The EPA says it will train water utilities that need help for
free. Larger utilities usually have more resources and the expertise to
defend against attacks. </p>
<p>“In an ideal world … we would like everybody to have a baseline level
of cybersecurity and be able to confirm that they have that,” said Alan
Roberson, executive director of the Association of State Drinking Water
Administrators. “But that’s a long ways away.” </p>
<p>Some barriers are foundational. The water sector is highly
fragmented. There are roughly 50,000 community water providers, most of
which serve small towns. Modest staffing and anemic budgets in many
places make it hard enough to maintain the basics — providing clean
water and keeping up with the latest regulations. </p>
<p>“Certainly, cybersecurity is part of that, but that’s never been
their primary expertise. So, now you’re asking a water utility to
develop this whole new sort of department” to handle cyberthreats, said
Amy Hardberger, a water expert at Texas Tech University. </p>
<p>States, industry groups object</p>
<p>The EPA has faced setbacks. States periodically review the
performance of water providers. In March 2023, the EPA instructed states
to add cybersecurity evaluations to those reviews. If they found
problems, the state was supposed to force improvements. </p>
<p>But Missouri, Arkansas and Iowa, joined by the American Water Works
Association and another water industry group, challenged the
instructions in court on the ground that EPA didn’t have the authority
under the Safe Drinking Water Act. After a court setback, the EPA
withdrew its requirements but urged states to take voluntary actions
anyway. </p>
<p>The Safe Drinking Water Act requires certain water providers to
develop plans for some threats and certify they’ve done so. But its
power is limited. </p>
<p>“There’s just no authority for [cybersecurity] in the law,” said
Roberson. </p>
<p>Kevin Morley, manager of federal relations with the American Water
Works Association, said some water utilities have components that are
connected to the internet — a common but significant vulnerability.
Overhauling those systems can be a significant and costly job. And
without substantial federal funding, water systems struggle to find
resources. </p>
<p>The industry group has published guidance for utilities and advocates
for establishing a new organization of cybersecurity and water experts
that would develop new policies and enforce them, in partnership with
the EPA. </p>
<p>“Let’s bring everybody along in a reasonable manner,” Morley said,
adding that small and large utilities have different needs and
resources.</p>

<h2 id="us-2024-election-what-to-expect-in-kentuckys-primaries">US 2024
election: What to expect in Kentucky’s primaries</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — All of Donald Trump’s top opponents for the Republican
nomination for president dropped out of the race weeks ago, but the
whole gang will be back together on Kentucky’s primary ballot
Tuesday.</p>
<p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley,
entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and former New Jersey Governor Chris
Christie all suspended their campaigns after Kentucky finalized its
ballot in January, as did pastor Ryan Binkley.</p>
<p>Trump has easily won nearly every Republican contest so far, but
Haley has won a significant number of votes in several recent primaries,
including Maryland (20%) and Nebraska (18%) this week.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden’s opponents in Kentucky are author Marianne
Williamson and U.S. Representative Dean Phillips. Democrats can also
vote for “uncommitted,” which has attracted protest votes in other
states.</p>
<p>Kentucky voters will also decide six primaries for the U.S. House.
One race to watch is the 4th Congressional District Republican primary.
Representative Thomas Massie, who backed DeSantis’ presidential bid and
co-sponsored a motion to remove House Speaker Mike Johnson, is facing a
challenge from Eric Deters, a staunch Trump supporter. However, Deters
hadn’t reported raising any money as of the latest filing deadline and
placed fourth in the 2023 gubernatorial primary.</p>
<p>Here’s a look at what to expect on Tuesday. </p>
<p>Primary day</p>
<p>Kentucky will hold presidential primaries and will also choose
nominees for the U.S. House, the state legislature and the state Senate.
Polls will close locally at 6 p.m. across the state. However, Kentucky
is nearly cut in half by time zones; most of it falls in the Eastern
time zone, while 41 counties in the western part of the state are on
Central time.  </p>
<p>Who gets to vote </p>
<p>Kentucky has a closed primary system, which means that only voters
registered with a political party may participate in that party’s
primary. Democrats may not vote in the Republican primary or vice versa.
Independent or unaffiliated voters may not participate in either
primary.</p>
<p>Delegate allocation rules</p>
<p>Kentucky Republicans allocate their 46 delegates proportionally to
any candidate who receives more than 15% of the vote, meaning any of
Trump’s opponents could qualify for delegates. They could also splinter
the anti-Trump vote, increasing Trump’s chances of being the only
candidate to receive 15% of the vote and therefore the only candidate to
receive any delegates. </p>
<p>Kentucky’s 53 pledged Democratic delegates are allocated according to
the national party’s standard rules. Twelve at-large delegates are
allocated in proportion to the statewide vote, as are six PLEO
delegates, or “party leaders and elected officials.” The state’s six
congressional districts have a combined 35 delegates at stake, which are
allocated in proportion to the vote results in each district. Candidates
must receive at least 15% of the statewide vote to qualify for any
statewide delegates, and 15% of the vote in a congressional district to
qualify for delegates in that district. </p>
<p>Decision notes </p>
<p>While Republican state parties that hold primaries this late in the
cycle tend to embrace a winner-takes-all system for delegate allocation,
Kentucky Republicans are dividing their delegates proportionally among
candidates who receive at least 15% of the vote. </p>
<p>For signs that a candidate not named Trump could reach that 15%
threshold, look to suburban areas like Louisville and Lexington. Those
areas — Jefferson and Fayette counties — are also the biggest sources of
GOP votes in the state. </p>
<p>In the 2020 presidential primary, “uncommitted” and Trump were the
only two options on the Republican ballot. Statewide, “uncommitted”
received 13% of the vote in the GOP primary. In Jefferson County,
however, “uncommitted” received 23%. </p>
<p>In the 4th Congressional District — which runs along the Ohio River,
sharing its northern boundary with Indiana and Ohio — the United
Democracy Project, a group that has criticized Massie for his record on
Israel, had spent $328,672 on the race as of last Tuesday. However,
those ads have not supported an alternative candidate. </p>
<p>The AP does not make projections and will declare a winner only when
it’s determined there is no scenario that would allow the trailing
candidates to close the gap. If a race has not been called, the AP will
continue to cover any newsworthy developments, such as candidate
concessions or declarations of victory. In doing so, the AP will make
clear that it has not yet declared a winner and explain why. </p>
<p>Kentucky mandates a recount if the top candidate wins by less than
0.5 percentage point. However, that recount rule does not apply to the
presidential race. Candidates can ask for a recanvass of the vote, which
entails retabulating the vote totals, if the margin is less than 1
percentage point. However, to request a recount, in which each ballot is
hand-counted, a court must approve and prescribe the procedure. </p>
<p>What do turnout and the advance vote look like? </p>
<p>As of March 31, there were 3,487,292 registered voters in Kentucky.
Of those voters, 43% were Democrats and 46% were Republicans.  </p>
<p>In 2022, 17% of voters cast their ballots before Election Day.  </p>
<p>How long does vote-counting usually take?</p>
<p>In the 2023 primary election, the AP first reported results at 6:03
p.m. Eastern time, or three minutes after the first polls closed. The
election night tabulation ended at 9:56 p.m. with about 98% of total
votes counted. </p>
<p>Are we there yet?</p>
<p>As of Tuesday, there will be 168 days until the November general
election.</p>

Prices Could Be Pretty Low This Summer — Except for One Thing</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-20, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjI4NDMzMS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0OTI3ODcxOH0.xEX5_EfLRpQJKgaWYpIYPnhUeoTL1YmJIyS-Zgj2TIw/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
The American oil refining business is a
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/pet_pnp_cap1_dcu_nus_a.htm" target="_blank">national
colossus</a>, with almost 130 facilities taking in some
<a href="https://ir.eia.gov/wpsr/wpsrsummary.pdf" target="_blank">16
million barrels of crude oil</a> per day and turning it into nearly
<a href="https://ir.eia.gov/wpsr/wpsrsummary.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">10
million barrels of gasoline and 5 million barrels of diesel</a>. And
unlike some past years, inventories are looking pretty good heading into
this summer. While they’re lower than the five-year average, gasoline
supplies are still higher than where they were a year ago, and
refineries are a ways away from running at their peak capacity.
According to the forecasters at GasBuddy, we’re looking at relatively
mild summertime prices of around $3.50 to $3.60 per gallon.
</p>
<p>
The one wild card: weather. About half of America’s refining capacity
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/special/gulf_of_mexico/" target="_blank">sits
on the Gulf Coast</a>, putting America’s fuel production squarely in the
target zone of what could be an
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/hurricane-season-2024" target="_blank">especially
active hurricane season</a>.
</p>
<p>
“If you recall 2022, inventories were tight and [refinery] utilization
was tight,” explained Patrick De Haan, GasBuddy’s head of petroleum
analysis. Gas prices peaked in June of 2022 at slightly over $5 per
gallon, according to data the Energy Information Administration’s data,
after the Russian invasion of Ukraine sent crude oil prices soaring to
more $120 a barrel. “Our head is holding above water now,” he said,
because demand is low. “We’re in a much better position going into the
start of the summer compared to two years ago.”
</p>
<p>
Oil prices have largely stayed steady so far this year other than a
brief
<a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DCOILWTICO" target="_blank">spike</a>
in early April, despite continued attacks on
<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/5/9/yemens-houthis-say-they-attacked-ships-in-gulf-of-aden-indian-ocean" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shipping
by Houthi rebels in Yemen</a> and the ongoing threat of a spiraling
regional conflict in the Middle East. The top gas price last month was
around $3.67 a gallon, whereas GasBuddy’s range of possible prices for
the summer months average closer to $3.60. All things considered, De
Haan told me, “we got a little bit of breathing room.”
</p>
<p>
Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note to clients last week that
gasoline stockpiles “remain close to the 5-year average level and are
not drawing as strongly as usual for this time of year,” which puts
downward pressure on prices. U.S. demand is hovering below 9 million
barrels these days,
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=23&t=10" target="_blank">which
is right about the average demand in 2023</a>, indicating that some
consumer weakness may be responsible for relatively mild gas prices.
</p>
<p>
Weaker-than-expected demand for gasoline would be consistent with other
signs of the American consumer being slightly less spendy in recent
months.
<a href="https://www.census.gov/retail/sales.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Overall
retail sales in April</a> were basically flat from the month before,
according to Census Bureau data, and came in
<a href="https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/us-retail-sales-stall-in-april-missing-expectations-6-new-bankruptcies-81691705" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lower
than economists’ expectations</a>. Sales at gasoline stations were down
0.8% in the first four months of this year compared to the first four
months of 2023, despite overall spending going up 3.5% from the same
period a year ago.
</p>
<p>
What can be good for drivers may not be so great for investors and the
gasoline complex at large. “It’s undeniable to say that there’s some
trouble in gasoline land,” Rory Johnston, a commodities analyst and
author of Commodity Context, told me. “In terms of whether it’s supply
or demand more broadly, as always, it’s a bit of both.”
</p>
<p>
Whatever the cause, it will mean
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/us-refiners-profits-fall-last-year-margins-remain-strong-2024-04-24/" target="_blank">less
profit for refiners</a>, especially compared to the record
outperformance they’ve seen in recent years.
</p>
<p>
“Gasoline prices and refining margins have come under pressure,” Reuters
reported last week, meaning that refineries are making a bit less than
before on the difference between crude oil and gasoline prices.
Inventories are also being run down more slowly than is normal for the
pre-summer season, the report said, “indicating supplies are plentiful,
and undermining the bullish case for the fuel.”
</p>
<p>
And yet if it’s destructive enough, just one hurricane could upend that
entire narrative. When Hurricane Harvey parked its torrential rains over
Houston in 2017, it took a
<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/30/harvey-shuts-down-largest-us-oil-refinery-bears-down-on-louisiana-plants.html#:~:text=Tropical%20Storm%20Harvey%20has%20shuttered,area%20refiners%20were%20also%20closed." target="_blank">big
chunk of the U.S. refinery complex offline</a>, pushing gas prices up
$0.36 in just two weeks.<br/>
</p>
<p>
While the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has yet to
release its official hurricane forecast for the year, The Weather
Company has
<a href="https://weather.com/storms/hurricane/news/2024-04-17-weather-company-hurricane-season-outlook-april" target="_blank">predicted</a>
that the 2024 season “could be one of the most active on record.” If
those hurricanes hit the wrong parts of the Gulf Coast, the expected
mild summer for America’s internal combustion-dependent drivers may be
blown away.

More Than 4 Days to Put Out This Battery Fire</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-20, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjI3OTc5OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0MzcyODY1MX0.9ENyMXROYIWfmcEnsgvUZ8Z6SGhS2UiCsVwqdabf47I/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
A fire at a battery storage site in San Diego County appears to have
been extinguished after burning on and off for multiple days and nights.
</p>
<p>
“There is no visible smoke or active fire at the scene,” Cal Fire, the
state fire protection agency, said in an
<a href="https://x.com/CALFIRESANDIEGO/status/1792574698426896529" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>update
Monday morning</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
The fire started sometime Wednesday at the Gateway Energy Storage
facility, a 250 megawatt battery electric storage system in Otay Mesa,
which is immediately adjacent both to the eastern border of San Diego
and to the northern border of Mexico and near the Richard J. Donovan
state prison facility.
</p>
<p>
Firefighters first succeeded in putting out the blaze on Thursday, “but
a flare-up later that night brought firefighters back to the scene,” the
<a href="https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/public-safety/story/2024-05-19/smoke-continues-to-rise-firefighters-assess-damaged-roof-at-otay-mesa-battery-storage-facility" target="_blank"><u><em>San
Diego Union-Tribune</em> reported</u></a>. Firefighters continued
working on the flames all weekend. As late as Sunday, there were 40
firefighters at the scene,
<a href="https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/public-safety/story/2024-05-19/smoke-continues-to-rise-firefighters-assess-damaged-roof-at-otay-mesa-battery-storage-facility" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>according
to <em>Union-Tribune</em> reporters</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Gateway’s owner and operator is LS Power, which has not responded to a
request for comment as of publication time. LS Power operates several
battery electric storage facilities in both California and New York.
<a href="https://www.lspower.com/ls-power-energizes-largest-battery-storage-project-in-the-world-the-250-mw-gateway-project-in-california-2/" target="_blank"><u>Gateway

battery storage projects in California</u></a>. Its purpose is to charge
when energy is cheap or when there’s plentiful solar power so that it
can deliver that excess energy back to the grid at times of high demand.
</p>
<p>
Fires have been a recurring problem for the battery electric storage
industry, which may be one reason why, according to
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/battery-support-survey" target="_self"><u>Heatmap
polling</u></a>, it is the form of carbon-free power least popular with
the general public. Firefighters need
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/lithium-ion-battery-fires-storage" target="_self"><u>specific
training</u></a><span style="background-color: initial;"> to deal with
battery fires,</span> and
“<a href="https://nfsa.org/2023/01/12/lithium-ion-battery-fires/#:~:text=When%20they%20reach%20thermal%20runaway,a%20lithium%2Dion%20battery%20fire." target="_blank"><u>thermal
runaway</u></a>” — i.e. one cell overheating and igniting leading to
another cell doing so and so on — can mean that fires last for several
days at very high temperatures.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>On Saturday,
<a href="https://x.com/CALFIRESANDIEGO/status/1791896579630387572/photo/1" target="_blank"><u>Cal
Fire reported</u></a> that “lithium batteries continue to experience
thermal runaway,” and that the fire had “burned through part of the
roof.” As of now, fire personnel are “on standby in case additional
batteries undergo thermal runaway.”

id="the-apprentice-about-a-young-donald-trump-premieres-in-cannes">‘The
Apprentice,’ about a young Donald Trump, premieres in Cannes</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CANNES, France — While Donald Trump’s hush money trial entered its
sixth week in New York, an origin story for the Republican presidential
candidate premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on Monday, unveiling a
scathing portrait of the former president in the 1980s. </p>
<p>“The Apprentice,” directed by the Iranian Danish filmmaker Ali
Abbasi, stars Sebastian Stan as Trump. The central relationship of the
movie is between Trump and Roy Cohn (Jeremy Strong), the defense
attorney who was chief counsel to Joseph McCarthy’s 1950s Senate
investigations. </p>
<p>Cohn is depicted as a longtime mentor to Trump, coaching him in the
ruthlessness of New York City politics and business. Early on, Cohn
aided the Trump Organization when it was being sued by the federal
government for racial discrimination in housing. </p>
<p>“The Apprentice,” which is labeled as inspired by true events,
portrays Trump’s dealings with Cohn as a Faustian bargain that guided
his rise as a businessman and, later, as a politician. Stan’s Trump is
initially a more naive real-estate striver, soon transformed by Cohn’s
education. </p>
<p>The film notably contains a scene depicting Trump raping his wife,
Ivana Trump (played by Maria Bakalova). In Ivana Trump’s 1990 divorce
deposition, she stated that Trump raped her. Trump denied the allegation
and Ivana Trump later said she didn’t mean it literally, but rather that
she had felt violated. </p>
<p>That scene and others make “The Apprentice” a potentially explosive
big-screen drama in the midst of the U.S. presidential election. The
film is for sale in Cannes, so it doesn’t yet have a release date. </p>
<p>Variety on Monday reported alleged behind-the-scenes drama
surrounding “The Apprentice.” Citing anonymous sources, the trade
publication reported that billionaire Dan Snyder, the former owner of
the Washington Commanders and an investor in “The Apprentice,” has
pressured the filmmakers to edit the film over its portrayal of Trump.
Snyder previously donated to Trump’s presidential campaign. </p>
<p>Neither representatives for the film nor Snyder could immediately be
reached for comment. </p>
<p>In the press notes for the film, Abbasi, whose previous film “Holy
Spider” depicts a female journalist investigating a serial killer in
Iran, said he didn’t set out to make “a History Channel episode.” </p>
<p>“This is not a biopic of Donald Trump,” said Abbasi. “We’re not
interested in every detail of his life going from A to Z. We’re
interested in telling a very specific story through his relationship
with Roy and Roy’s relationship with him.” </p>
<p>Regardless of its political impact, “The Apprentice” is likely to be
much discussed as a potential awards contender. The film, shot in a
gritty 1980’s aesthetic, returns Strong to a New York landscape of money
and power a year following the conclusion of HBO’s “Succession.” Strong,
who’s currently performing on Broadway in “An Enemy of the People,”
didn’t attend the Cannes premiere Monday. </p>
<p>“The Apprentice” is playing in competition in Cannes, making it
eligible for the festival’s top award, the Palme d’Or. At Cannes,
filmmakers and casts hold press conferences the day after a movie’s
premiere. “The Apprentice” press conference will be Tuesday.</p>

XPeng Motors is rolling out cutting-edge AI technology that it hopes
will transform the automotive industry from “electrification to
smartification.” The <a href="https://electrek.co/guides/xpeng/">Chinese

impressive capabilities of XOS 5.1.0, “AI Tianji,” which it hailed as
“the industry’s first AI-powered in-car OS.”

<h2 id="the-indiewebs-next-stage">The IndieWeb’s next stage?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-20, from: Ben Werdmuller’s blog</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div class=&quot;known-bookmark&quot;&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;e-content&quot;&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
“I want the IndieWeb to be a viable alternative to social media,
gradually widening the audience beyond tech-savvy folks by making the
tools easier to use and more reliable.”
</p>
<p>
This is what we were trying for with Known: something that felt social
but was fully under the user’s control. We had installers at third-party
hosts; we had our own managed service; we had the open source code for
people who wanted to use that directly.
</p>
<p>
The fediverse adds a missing piece here: Known suffered immensely from a
blank page and no reader view when you logged in for the first time. Now
we can build platforms that immediately connect people to a much wider
social network that is outside of monolithic corporate control but also
makes it (relatively) easy to find the people you care about.
</p>
<p>
A combination between the fediverse and indieweb is almost inevitable.
This is what Ghost appears to be building today, for example, with its
new integrated fediverse reader tool. WordPress may also be headed in
that direction. And there will be many others.
</p>
<p>
A huge +1, also, to the idea that we can “manifest momentum by speaking
aloud your dreams and letting others share them with you”. This is how
community-building works.
</p>
<p>
And, for the record, I’m all-in.

Court rejects appeal from Canadian man once held at Guantanamo</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday rejected an appeal by a
Canadian-born former Guantanamo detainee who was seeking to wipe away
his war crimes convictions, including for killing a U.S. soldier in
Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Omar Khadr had waived his right to appeal when he pleaded guilty in
2010 to charges that included murder. But his lawyers argued that a
subsequent ruling by the federal appeals court in Washington called into
question whether Khadr could have been charged with the crimes in the
first place.</p>
<p>A divided three-judge panel ruled that, despite the appellate ruling,
Khadr gave up his right to appeal.</p>
<p>Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Ketanji Brown Jackson did not take part
in the Supreme Court’s consideration of Khadr’s appeal because both had
dealt with the case while they served as appeals court judges. Jackson
explained her recusal from Monday’s order; Kavanaugh did not.</p>
<p>Khadr had been sentenced to eight years in prison plus the time he
already had spent in custody, including several years at the U.S. naval
base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. But he was released in May 2015 pending
his appeal of the guilty plea.</p>
<p>A Canadian judge ruled in 2019 that his war crimes sentence had
expired.</p>
<p>Khadr was 15 when he was captured by U.S. troops following a
firefight at a suspected al-Qaida compound in Afghanistan that resulted
in the death of an American special forces medic, U.S. Army Sgt. First
Class Christopher Speer. Khadr, who was suspected of throwing the
grenade that killed Speer, was taken to Guantanamo and ultimately
charged with war crimes by a military commission.</p>

id="ship-that-caused-deadly-baltimore-bridge-collapse-has-been-refloated-moving-back-to-port">Ship
that caused deadly Baltimore bridge collapse has been refloated, moving
back to port</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Baltimore — The container ship that caused the deadly collapse of
Baltimore’s Francis Scott Key Bridge was refloated at high tide Monday
and began slowly moving back to port, guided by several tugboats.</p>
<p>Removing the Dali from the wreckage marked a significant step in
ongoing cleanup and recovery efforts. Nearly two months have passed
since the ship lost power and crashed into one of the bridge’s
supporting columns, killing six construction workers and halting most
maritime traffic through Baltimore’s busy port.</p>
<p>The vessel appeared to start moving shortly after 6 a.m. It started
and stopped a few times before slowly and steadily backing away from the
collapse site, where it had been grounded since the March 26
disaster.</p>
<p>Pieces of the bridge’s steel trusses still protruded from its damaged
bow, which remained covered in mangled concrete from the collapsed
roadway.</p>
<p>With the hulking cargo ship finally removed from the mouth of
Baltimore’s harbor, a newly opened void appeared in the city’s skyline.
The altered waterscape also highlighted the progress made on the cleanup
effort; crews have already removed hundreds of tons of mangled steel
that once were visible jutting up from the water’s surface.</p>
<p>The bodies of all six construction workers have been recovered from
the underwater wreckage in recent weeks. All the victims were Latino
immigrants who came to the U.S. for job opportunities. They were filling
potholes on an overnight shift when the bridge was destroyed.</p>
<p>Officials said the Dali would move at about 1 mph on the roughly
2.5-mile (4-kilometer) trip back to port, a fraction of the speed it was
traveling when it lost power and brought down the bridge.</p>
<p>The ship is expected to remain in the port for a several weeks and
undergo temporary repairs before being moved to a shipyard for more
substantial repairs. It will return to the same marine terminal it
occupied before beginning its ill-fated voyage.</p>
<p>Crews began preparing the ship to be refloated about 18 hours before
it started moving Monday morning. That process included releasing
anchors and pumping out over 1 million gallons of water that were
keeping the ship grounded and stable during complex cleanup operations.
Crews conducted a controlled demolition on May 13 to break down the
largest remaining span of the collapsed bridge, which was draped across
the Dali’s bow.</p>
<p>Dive teams also completed inspections of the site to confirm there
were no obstructions that would hinder the voyage.</p>
<p>The Dali experienced two electrical blackouts about 10 hours before
leaving the Port of Baltimore on its way to Sri Lanka, according to a
preliminary report released last week by the National Transportation
Safety Board. In response to those issues, the crew made changes to the
ship’s electrical configuration, switching to a transformer and breaker
system that had previously been out of use for several months, the
report says.</p>
<p>The Dali experienced two more blackouts as it was approaching the Key
Bridge, causing it to lose propulsion and drift off course at the exact
wrong moment.</p>
<p>The two tugboats that helped guide the Dali out of the port had
peeled off after it entered the main shipping channel. That was normal
protocol, according to the report, but when the power went out, the tugs
were too far away to help avert disaster.</p>
<p>The FBI has also launched a criminal investigation into the
circumstances leading up to the crash.</p>
<p>The ship’s crew members haven’t been allowed to leave the vessel
since the disaster. Officials said they’ve been busy maintaining the
ship and assisting investigators. Of the crew members, 20 are from India
and one is Sri Lankan. Officials have said they will be able to
disembark once the Dali is docked in Baltimore.</p>
<p>Officials plan to reopen the port’s 50-foot (15-meter) deep draft
channel by the end of May. Until then, crews have established a
temporary channel that’s slightly shallower.</p>

on first state visit by Kenyan leader to US in two decades</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Nairobi — Kenyan President William Ruto meets his US counterpart Joe
Biden in Washington this week, with the crisis in Haiti and efforts to
build trade ties likely to top the agenda.</p>
<p>Billed as “historic” by Ruto’s office, it is the first state visit by
a Kenyan president to the United States in two decades and the first by
an African leader since 2008.</p>
<p>Thursday’s Biden-Ruto talks will focus on trade and security
partnerships including Kenya’s pledge to lead a UN-backed multinational
mission seeking to restore order in Haiti, which has been wracked by
gang-fueled anarchy.</p>
<p>Kenya has offered to send 1,000 personnel, along with forces pledged
by several other countries, although the United States and other major
nations have ruled out putting their own forces on the ground.</p>
<p>A first batch of Kenyan police is expected to make the
12,000-kilometre (7,500-mile) journey to the Haitian capital
Port-au-Prince this week, security sources told AFP, despite a fresh
court challenge in Nairobi against the deployment.</p>
<p>Ruto has defended the undertaking as a “mission for humanity” in the
Western hemisphere’s poorest nation, which has suffered from poverty,
political instability and natural disasters for decades.</p>
<p>But a new lawsuit filed last week is seeking to hold Ruto’s
government in contempt for “blatantly” ignoring a January court order
prohibiting the deployment as unconstitutional and illegal.</p>
<p>Funding could also prove a stumbling block for the mission, analysts
say.</p>
<p>The United States is the largest backer of the force, pledging more
than $300 million since the Haiti crisis intensified several years ago
but other countries have been slow to offer support.</p>
<p>Ruto will demand “the US do more to rally financial support for the
UN basket fund,” said Meron Elias, East and Southern Africa analyst at
the International Crisis Group.</p>
<p>“Kenya also wants the US to commit greater backing to stemming the
flow of arms into Haiti, including from US ports in Florida,” she
said.</p>
<p>Trade deal</p>
<p>Ruto begins his visit on Monday in Atlanta, Georgia where he will
visit the Carter Presidential Library and Museum, among other
engagements.</p>
<p>“His remarks here will underline the importance of democracies
working collaboratively to tackle global challenges,” State House
spokesman Hussein Mohamed said.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, he is due to visit studios owned by entertainment mogul
Tyler Perry, who has championed greater diversity in Hollywood to
“explore opportunities within the creative economy.”</p>
<p>Ruto will meet a Congressional delegation on Wednesday and call for
the extension of a free trade agreement — the African Growth and
Opportunity Act (AGOA) — which eliminates import tariffs on goods from
eligible African nations.</p>
<p>The pact expires in 2025, prompting African leaders to seek clarity
on future arrangements.</p>
<p>Most of Kenya’s imports are from China — also one of its biggest
bilateral creditors — and Washington has been keen to eat into Beijing’s
clout in the region.</p>
<p>The East African nation began talks with the United States on a free
trade agreement in 2020 but nothing has been signed.</p>
<p>In 2022, the United States exported goods worth $604 million to Kenya
while imports totaled $875 million, according to the Office of the US
Trade Representative.</p>
<p>Kenyan Trade Minister Rebecca Miano said there were “very big
opportunities” for investment in the country.</p>
<p>“We have prepared more than 30 bankable projects worth over $20.5
billion to interest American investors and the Kenyan diaspora,” she
told local media last week.</p>
<p>‘Extremely disappointed’</p>
<p>A request for Ruto to address a joint session of Congress fell
through after House Speaker Mike Johnson of the Republican Party
declined to extend an invitation.</p>
<p>Lawmakers from Biden’s Democratic Party last week accused Johnson of
disrespecting Africa, saying they were “extremely disappointed” by the
decision.</p>
<p>The last African leader to address Congress was Liberia’s Ellen
Johnson Sirleaf, the continent’s first female elected head of state, in
2006.</p>
<p>The visit “feels a bit like a fig leaf” for Africa, the Center for
Strategic and International Studies said, as it comes after Biden broke

<li>Hail damage is making insurers nervous
</h3>
<p>
Hail damage accounted for between 50% and 80% of the $64 billion in
insured storm costs worldwide last year, according to international
reinsurance firm Swiss Re. As storms become more frequent and more
severe due to climate change, insurers are beginning to factor hail into
their risk assessments on policies, <em>Bloomberg</em>
<a href="https://d2qwfv04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/X+113/d2QWfV04/VVz3zQ11PVjVW8KWKv84LK1FjW5_BCzp5fjyktN7zrx1C3qn9gW8wLKSR6lZ3p8W3v3HmR5dCm7fW14fCx37LQgFRW5lVyXV1yxcJLW11ZV0K5ZbzX_W48t0dp3v0GRjW1QK0MG1NPdw1Vc5H8p1W5NjnW65VdyK2W8nzwW2bQGRW8QMW_ZW11-fKl51LLNkW5CJ2-r14KxzLW1S--v558nFl8W7gXDzG5FH7MjN71q0BQWXyT9W7TSvVy9bDyMqW7pHl9r6d7Yd0W47H6Wr3t30T-W8sfBYS3ZNw9gVb0C9f7H-KlwW3Dwjsn6F_j8bW7RtMzd5Dsf0lW8wGYq1957FRFV_vnXf6W6JpJW8_s_-L2PWLPmW2dpyw379jbBCW3VLVnv7yzQ68W32dX7M6S0Ct3W51x_WH89ynlyf8Gnllx04" target="_blank">reported</a>.
Such a move could result in higher rates for policyholders. Other
customers could lose insurance altogether. Some insurers are “nervous to
touch big solar farms” because of the incredible damage hail can do to
solar panels. One insurer has started testing the durability of various
panels by pummeling them with “industrially produced hail” and seeing
how well they hold up.

what many drivers of electric vehicles probably already know: Public
charging infrastructure in the U.S. isn’t growing fast enough. For every
public charging point in the country, there are more than 20 EVs.
Compare that to 2016, when there were seven EVs for each charging point,
and it becomes clear charger installations aren’t matching growing
demand. “As Americans purchase more and more EVs, public chargers will
be essential to support long road trips, help apartment-dwellers go
electric and alleviate overnight pressure on electricity grids,” the

<h2 id="kde-plasma-6-comes-to-openbsd">KDE Plasma 6 comes to
OpenBSD</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-20, from: OS News</p>
<p>Last year marked a significant milestone for both myself and the
OpenBSD desktop community, as we successfully ported KDE Plasma 5 and
all dependencies to OpenBSD. With the release of OpenBSD 7.5 on April 5,
2024, KDE Plasma in version 5.27.10 has become a part of our lovely
operating system. This success is the result of years of development
work and commitment to achieving this goal. KDE launched version 6 of
its Plasma desktop environment on February 28, 2024, bringing numerous
updates and features as well as the major switch to Qt6. I am immensely
proud that the OpenBSD team has managed to prepare for this major update
so swiftly. All necessary components have been committed to our CVS
tree, and the packages will soon be available. ↫ Rafael Sadowski
Excellent news for OpenBSD users who don’t wish to be using GNOME, Xfce,
or one of the smaller build-it-yourself desktop environments. My
dual-Xeon workstation, which I switched over from Fedora KDE to OpenBSD,

natural fit for OpenBSD, but I’m very happy to know that I have KDE to
fall back on in case Xfce turns out not to be a good fit for me in the
long term. I’ll give the OpenBSD developers an other experts in that

probably give it a go to see just how well KDE will be integrated with

Server 2025 to ship with DTrace by default</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-20, from: OS News</p>
<p>Windows Server 2025 comes equipped with dtrace as a native tool.
DTrace is a command-line utility that enables users to monitor and
troubleshoot their system’s performance in real-time. DTrace allows
users to dynamically instrument both the kernel and user-space code
without any need to modify the code itself. This versatile tool supports
a range of data collection and analysis techniques, such as
aggregations, histograms, and tracing of user-level events. To learn
more, see DTrace for command line help and DTrace on Windows for
additional capabilities. ↫ What’s new in Windows Server 2025 DTrace was
originally developed by Sun as part of Solaris, but eventually made its
way to other operating systems as Sun collapsed in on itself and Oracle
gave it the final push. DTrace is available for the various surviving
Solars-based operating systems, Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, macOS, and QNX,
and Microsoft ported DTrace from FreeBSD to Windows back in 2018. With
Windows Server 2025, DTrace will be shipped out of the box.</p>

id="wikileaks-assange-can-appeal-us-extradition-on-freedom-of-speech-grounds-1">Wikileaks’
Assange can appeal US extradition on freedom of speech grounds</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>London — The United States government’s attempts to extradite
Wikileaks founder Julian Assange from Britain on charges of espionage
took another legal twist Monday, as a British court ruled he must be
given the right to a full appeal against the order on freedom of speech
grounds. </p>
<p>The hearing at London’s High Court on Monday was the last legal hope
for Wikileaks founder Julian Assange to halt his imminent extradition to
the United States.  </p>
<p>Two of the three judges ruled that a full appeal hearing must be held
into whether the 52-year-old Australian citizen would be able to rely on
the U.S. First Amendment right to free speech, in an American
court. </p>
<p>“This is good news because it means that the Julian Assange case can
now proceed to a hearing that will substantively consider the freedom of
expression arguments,” said Simon Crowther, a legal adviser at Amnesty
International.</p>
<p>Assange’s lawyers successfully argued that U.S. government assurances
that he could “seek to rely” on those First Amendment rights were
inadequate. A new appeal process could take months or years. </p>
<p>Barry Pollack, a member of Assange’s legal team, described the ruling
as a significant milestone. “The High Court is going to hear the vitally
important issues of whether someone should be extradited to the United
States for having published truthful, newsworthy information.” </p>
<p>“The United States should never have brought this case. It is utterly
inconsistent with First Amendment values and all that the United States
says that it believes. And I hope the United States will take a hard
look at this decision and maybe reconsider whether they want [to] pursue
this fundamentally flawed case,” Pollack said at a news conference
following the ruling Monday. </p>
<p>Assange was not in court Monday due to ill health. His wife, Stella
Assange, said it was the correct ruling.</p>
<p>“As a family, we are relieved. But how long can this go on? The
United States should read the situation and drop this case now. Now is
the moment to do it. Just abandon this shameful attack on journalists,
on the press and the public that has been going on for 14 years. This
case is shameful, and it is taking an enormous toll on Julian. He is
under enormous pressure. He has been in Belmarsh Prison for over five
years,” she told hundreds of supporters outside the court. </p>
<p>U.S. prosecutors have filed 18 charges against Assange, relating to
allegations of hacking and theft of classified material. They did not
immediately comment on Monday’s court ruling. </p>
<p>In 2010, WikiLeaks published thousands of stolen diplomatic cables
relating to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, which Assange said exposed
abuses by the United States military. The U.S. government argues his
actions went beyond journalism by soliciting, stealing and
indiscriminately publishing classified government documents that
endangered innocent lives. </p>
<p>The case sets a vital precedent, said Amnesty’s Simon Crowther. “What
Julian Assange is being prosecuted for is something journalists do all
the time: they receive classified material that exposes war crimes or
alleged war crimes, or crimes against humanity, serious human rights
violations. And when it’s in the public interest, they publish those
documents,” Crowther told VOA. </p>
<p>Assange has spent the past five years in London’s Belmarsh high
security jail.  </p>
<p>Prior to that, he sought refuge in the Ecuadorean embassy in London
for seven years after Swedish prosecutors charged him with two counts of
rape, which he denied. The charges were later dropped. Assange was
jailed for breaching his bail conditions. The U.S. Justice Department
first formally requested his extradition in 2019. </p>
<p>In the coming months, Assange will have the right to bring a new
appeal before the British courts, where he will argue that the U.S.
judicial system would deny him his right to free speech.</p>

two other Baptist ministers, the Reverend Richard C. Coulter and the
Reverend Edmund Turney, to educate formerly enslaved men. They believed
“education would be the great equalizer from slavery to freedom,” Biden

<h2 id="hurt-in-mass-shooting-in-savannah-georgia">11 hurt in mass
shooting in Savannah, Georgia</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SAVANNAH, Ga. — An argument between two women led to a gunfight that
left 11 people hurt in a busy tourist area of Savannah, Georgia, late
Saturday, one of five weekend shootings in the city, two of which were
fatal, authorities said.</p>
<p>Two people were injured in separate shootings Friday. Two more
shootings Saturday resulted in two deaths. Then came the gunfire just
before midnight Saturday near Savannah’s Ellis Square.</p>
<p>The shooting broke out as two women argued in an area business,
according to Police Chief Lenny Gunther, who didn’t name the
establishment.</p>
<p>“One shot rang out. That triggered other individuals to shoot,” he
said. “We had multiple individuals discharge their weapons to shoot at
each other, which resulted in multiple people getting shot.”</p>
<p>Ten of the 11 injured were hit by gunfire. Authorities did not say
what caused the 11th injury. Victims were treated at the scene and
“several” were taken to a hospital, police said. None of the injuries
appeared life threatening.</p>
<p>Mayor Van Johnson said a proliferation of guns was a factor in the
shootings and that reasonable gun control laws are needed. He also
stressed the need for gun owners to keep their weapons from being stolen
and for people carrying guns to know how and when to use them.</p>
<p>“We have to insist on smart gun laws,” Johnson said at a Sunday news
conference. “And then, on the other end, we have to insist that people
act responsibly with those weapons.”</p>
<p>The mass shooting happened a week ahead of the tourist-heavy Memorial
Day weekend. Gunther sought to assure people that police staffing will
be sufficient to keep the public safe.</p>
<p>Ellis Square is in Savannah’s historic district, an area popular
among tourists and locals. It was developed in 2010 and is known for a
large fountain and a life-sized statue of songwriter Johnny Mercer.</p>
<p>The first two of Savannah’s weekend shootings happened Friday. Each
of those resulted in a non-life-threatening injury and an arrest. On
Saturday, police answering a call about a home invasion found a dead
juvenile at the home. Initial reports are that shots were fired after a
resident confronted an armed intruder.</p>
<p>Still another shooting was reported at a Savannah intersection
Saturday night that left one man dead and a juvenile injured.</p>

<h2 id="pg_dumpbinary-v2.17-released">pg_dumpbinary v2.17 released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-20, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
<strong>Grenoble, France - Mai 20, 2024</strong>
</p>
<h2>
pg_dumpbinary
</h2>
<p>
<code>pg_dumpbinary</code> dumps a PostgreSQL database to a binary
format. The resulting dump must be restored using
<code>pg_restorebinary</code>, which is provided.
</p>
<p>
This release adds two new options to command pg_restorebinary:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Add option <code>-C, –create</code> to pg_restorebinary to create the
database before restoring into it. Like with pg_restore you must provide
a database to connect using the <code>-d</code> option.
</li>
<li>
Add <code>–dump-create</code> to print to stdout the create and alter
database statements.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<code>pg_dumpbinary</code> is useful when:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
You have bytea that can not be exported by <code>pg_dump</code> because
the total size of the escape/hex output exceeds 1Gb.
</li>
<li>
You have custom type that stores <code>\0</code> internally in bytea but
data are exported by pg_dump as char/varchar/text. In this case pg_dump
truncates all data after the first <code>\0</code>, resulting in data
loss.
</li>
<li>
Other cases where a binary output format is useful.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
In these kinds of cases <code>pg_dumpbinary</code> helps by dumping the
PostgreSQL database in a binary format. In all other cases the
pg_dump/pg_restore commands distributed with PostgreSQL are preferred.
</p>
<p>
See the documentation for a more complete description of available
features.

id="california-disneyland-character-parade-performers-vote-to-join-labor-union">California
Disneyland character, parade performers vote to join labor union</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Anaheim, California — Disneyland performers who help bring Mickey
Mouse, Cinderella and other beloved characters to life at the Southern
California resort chose to unionize following a three-day vote
culminating Saturday.</p>
<p>The Actors’ Equity Association labor union said in a statement
Saturday that cast members for the parades and characters departments at
Disney’s theme parks near Los Angeles voted by a wide margin for the
union to become the bargaining agent for the group of roughly 1,700
workers.</p>
<p>An association website tracking the balloting among cast members
indicated passage by 78.7% (953 votes) in favor and 21.3% (258 votes)
opposed.</p>
<p>“They say that Disneyland is ‘the place where dreams come true,’ and
for the Disney Cast Members who have worked to organize a union, their
dream came true today,” Actors’ Equity Association President Kate
Shindle said in a statement Saturday night.</p>
<p>Shindle called the workers the “front lines” of the Disneyland guest
experience. The association and cast members will discuss improvements
to health and safety, wages, benefits, working conditions and job
security before meeting with Walt Disney Company representatives about
negotiating the staff priorities into a contract, she said.</p>
<p>The union already represents theatrical performers at Disney’s
Florida parks.</p>
<p>Barring any election challenges, the regional director of the
National Labor Relations Board will certify the results within a week,
the association said.</p>
<p>The NLRB did not immediately respond to an email from The Associated
Press seeking confirmation or additional information about the vote.</p>
<p>The election took place on Wednesday, Thursday and Saturday in
Anaheim, California, after workers earlier this year filed cards to form
the unit called “Magic United.”</p>
<p>Parade and character workers who promoted unionizing said they love
helping to create a magical experience at Disneyland but grew concerned
when they were asked to resume hugging visitors after returning to work
during the coronavirus pandemic. They said they also suffer injuries
from complex costumes and erratic schedules.</p>
<p>Most of the more than 35,000 workers at the Disneyland Resort,
including cleaning crews, pyrotechnic specialists and security staff,
are already in labor unions. The resort includes Disneyland, the Walt
Disney Co.’s oldest theme park, Disney California Adventure and the
shopping and entertainment district Downtown Disney in Anaheim.</p>
<p>In recent years, Disney has faced allegations of not paying its
Southern California workers, who face exorbitant housing costs and often
commute long distances or cram into small homes, a livable wage. Parade
performers and character actors earn a base pay of $24.15 an hour, up
from $20 before January, with premiums for different roles.</p>
<p>Union membership has been on a decadeslong decline in the United
States, but organizations have seen growing public support in recent
years during high-profile contract negotiations involving Hollywood
studios and Las Vegas hotels. The NLRB, which protects workers’ right to
organize, reported more than 2,500 filings for union representation
during the 2023 fiscal year, which was the highest number in eight
years.</p>
<p>The effort to organize character and parade performers in California
came more than 40 years after those who play Mickey, Goofy and Donald
Duck in Florida were organized by the International Brotherhood of
Teamsters, a union traditionally known to represent transportation
workers.</p>
<p>At that time, the Florida performers complained about filthy costumes
and abuse from guests, including children who would kick the shins of
Disney villains such as Captain Hook.</p>

id="power-expected-to-be-restored-for-most-affected-by-deadly-houston-storm">Power
expected to be restored for most affected by deadly Houston storm</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Houston, Texas — Houston area residents affected by deadly storms
last week received some good news as officials said power had been
restored Sunday to a majority of the hundreds of thousands who had been
left in the dark and without air conditioning amid hot and humid
weather.</p>
<p>The widespread destruction of Thursday’s storms left at least seven
dead and brought much of Houston to a standstill. Thunderstorms and
hurricane-force winds tore through the city, reducing businesses and
other structures to piles of debris, uprooting trees and shattering
glass from downtown skyscrapers. A tornado also touched down near the
northwest Houston suburb of Cypress.</p>
<p>By Sunday evening, 88% of customers in the Houston area had their
power restored, said Paul Lock, a spokesperson for CenterPoint
Energy.</p>
<p>“We expect everyone to be back on by end of business Wednesday,” Lock
said.</p>
<p>More than 289,000 homes and businesses in Texas remained without
electricity Sunday evening, mostly in the Houston area. More than 3,900
customers remained without power in Louisiana, which had also been hit
by strong winds and a suspected tornado.</p>
<p>CenterPoint Energy said 2,000 employees and more than 5,000
contractors were working in the Houston area to restore power.</p>
<p>“We understand the higher temperatures we are experiencing across
Houston and surrounding communities make getting the lights and air
conditioning back on even more important,” Lynnae Wilson, CenterPoint’s
senior vice president of electric business, said in a statement.</p>
<p>At one of five cooling centers for people still without power in
their homes, residents took shelter from the heat at a community center
in the Cloverleaf neighborhood and wondered when their power would come
back.</p>
<p>Carolina Sierra and her 6-year-old son, Derek, enjoyed the air
conditioning for a couple of hours Sunday. She said they have been
without electricity since the storm hit Thursday, and their home has
been stifling.</p>
<p>Derek passed the time coloring a picture of a dragon while his mother
charged her cellphone and a portable lamp they planned to use Sunday
night if the power was still not restored. Sierra said she gives her son
multiple baths to try to keep him cool but he tosses and turns at night
and struggles to sleep.</p>
<p>“We are desperate,” Sierra said. “We hardly sleep at night because of
the heat.”</p>
<p>Harris County Commissioner Adrian Garcia stood outside the center
Sunday, helping load water and ice onto vehicles while offering words of
encouragement to residents still waiting for power to be restored.</p>
<p>“We are seeing a bit of the recovery come through,” Garcia said. “But
we can’t see enough of it fast enough.”</p>
<p>Disaster assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and
loans from the Small Business Administration were on the way, said
Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo, the top elected official in the county
where Houston is located. The federal assistance, which can help pay for
temporary housing and repairs, will help residents affected by last
week’s storms as well as by flooding from heavy rainfall in late April
and early May in parts of Houston, Harris County and several counties
north of Houston.</p>
<p>Mayor John Whitmire said a six-block area in downtown Houston would
be closed Monday to allow crews to continue repairs after various
high-rise buildings had their windows blown out.</p>
<p>Residents broke into cheers as lights and air conditioning kicked on
at the eight-story Houston Heights Tower, a senior housing facility,
Sunday morning. The nearly 200 residents had been living on emergency
power since Thursday evening, with generators providing enough
electricity to run just one of the building’s elevators and a handful of
fans in the community room, leaving apartments in darkness.</p>
<p>Volunteers and city workers had been ensuring residents received a
steady supply of water, food and essentials like toilet paper.</p>
<p>“It just goes to show you how people come together,” resident Joseph
Torregrossa said, choking back tears.</p>
<p>The National Weather Service said in a post on the social platform X
that residents should expect “sunny, hot and increasingly humid days” in
the Houston area. Highs of about 32 Celsius (90 degrees Fahrenheit) were
expected this week, with heat indexes likely approaching 39 Celsius (102
F) by midweek.</p>
<p>With the temperature at 33 Celsius Sunday afternoon, Lisa Reed sat in
a folding chair outside her home in the Cloverleaf neighborhood because
she was still without electricity. A volunteer crew had just cut up a
large tree in her front yard that had come crashing down on two vehicles
in her driveway and stacked the wood neatly in two large piles.</p>
<p>Reed said no home on her street — where branches and other debris
were piled along the sidewalk — escaped damage from last week’s
storms.</p>
<p>“It’s nothing I can do,” said Reed, a fifth-grade teacher. “Take it
all in stride. I’m a firm believer that God will work it all out.”</p>
<p>Houston area school districts canceled classes for more than 400,000
students Friday. The Houston Independent School District, the state’s
largest, said 215 of its 274 campuses would be open Monday. Two other
large school districts in the Houston area — Cypress-Fairbanks and
Spring Branch — planned to be closed.</p>

launches anti-dumping probe into EU, US, Japan, Taiwan plastics</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Beijing — China’s commerce ministry on Sunday launched an
anti-dumping probe into POM copolymers, a type of engineering plastic,
imported from the European Union, United States, Japan and Taiwan.</p>
<p>The plastics can partially replace metals such as copper and zinc and
have various applications including in auto parts, electronics, and
medical equipment, the ministry said in a statement.</p>
<p>The investigation should be completed in a year but could be extended
for six months, it said.</p>
<p>The European Commission, which oversees EU trade policy, said it
would carefully study the contents of the investigation before deciding
on any next steps.</p>
<p>“We expect China to ensure that this investigation is fully in line
with all relevant WTO (World Trade Organization) rules and obligations,”
a spokesperson said.</p>
<p>China’s plastics probe comes amid a broader trade row with the United
States and Europe.</p>
<p>The United States on Tuesday unveiled steep tariff increases on
Chinese electric vehicles, or EVs, computer chips, medical products and
other imports.</p>
<p>On Friday, the European Union launched a trade investigation into
Chinese tinplate steel, the latest in a string of EU trade and subsidy
probes into Chinese exports.</p>
<p>Most notably, the European Commission launched a probe last September
to decide whether to impose punitive tariffs on cheaper Chinese EVs that
it suspects of benefiting from state subsidies.</p>
<p>Beijing argues the recent focus by the United States and Europe on
the risks to other economies from China’s excess capacity is
misguided.</p>
<p>Chinese officials say the criticism understates innovation by Chinese
companies in key industries and overstates the importance of state
support in driving their growth.</p>

id="pro-palestinian-protesters-set-up-a-new-encampment-at-philadelphias-drexel-university">Pro-Palestinian
protesters set up a new encampment at Philadelphia’s Drexel
University</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania — Pro-Palestinian protesters set up a new
encampment at Drexel University in Philadelphia over the weekend,
prompting a lockdown of school buildings, a day after authorities
thwarted an attempted occupation of a school building at the neighboring
University of Pennsylvania campus.</p>
<p>After several hundred demonstrators marched from Philadelphia’s City
Hall to west Philadelphia on Saturday afternoon, Drexel said in a
statement that about 75 protesters began to set up an encampment on the
Korman Quad on the campus. About a dozen tents remained Sunday, blocked
off by barricades and monitored by police officers. No arrests were
reported.</p>
<p>Drexel President John Fry said in a message Saturday night that the
encampment “raises understandable concerns about ensuring everyone’s
safety,” citing what he called “many well-documented instances of
hateful speech and intimidating behavior at other campus
demonstrations.” University buildings were “open only to those with
clearance from Drexel’s Public Safety,” he said.</p>
<p>Authorities at Drexel, which has about 22,000 students, were
monitoring the demonstration to ensure it was peaceful and didn’t
disrupt normal operations, and that “participants and passersby will
behave respectfully toward one another,” Fry said.</p>
<p>“We will be prepared to respond quickly to any disruptive or
threatening behavior by anyone,” Fry said, vowing not to tolerate
property destruction, “harassment or intimidation” of students or staff
or threatening behavior of any kind, including “explicitly racist,
antisemitic, or Islamophobic” speech. Anyone not part of the Drexel
community would not be allowed “to trespass into our buildings and
student residences,” he said.</p>
<p>On Friday night, members of Penn Students Against the Occupation of
Palestine had announced an action at the University of Pennsylvania’s
Fisher-Bennett Hall, urging supporters to bring “flags, pots, pans,
noise-makers, megaphones” and other items.</p>
<p>The university said campus police, supported by city police, removed
the demonstrators Friday night, arresting 19 people, including six
University of Pennsylvania students. The university’s division of public
safety said officials found “lock-picking tools and homemade metal
shields,” and exit doors secured with zip ties and barbed wire, windows
covered with newspaper and cardboard and entrances blocked.</p>
<p>Authorities said seven people arrested would face felony charges,
including one accused of having assaulted an officer, while a dozen were
issued citations for failing to disperse and follow police commands.</p>
<p>The attempted occupation of the building came a week after city and
campus police broke up a two-week encampment on the campus, arresting 33
people, nine of whom were students and two dozen of whom had “no Penn
affiliation,” according to university officials.</p>
<p>On Sunday, dozens of George Washington University graduates walked
out of commencement ceremonies, disrupting university President Ellen
Granberg’s speech, in protest over the ongoing siege of Gaza and last
week’s clearing of an on-campus protest encampment that involved police
use of pepper spray and dozens of arrests.</p>
<p>The ceremony, at the base of the Washington Monument, started
peacefully with fewer than 100 protesters demonstrating across the
street in front of the Museum of African American History and Culture.
But as Granberg began speaking, at least 70 students among the graduates
started chanting and raising signs and Palestinian flags. The students
then noisily walked out as Granberg spoke, crossing the street to a
rapturous response from the protesters.</p>
<p>Students and others have set up tent encampments on campuses around
the country to protest the Israel-Hamas war, pressing colleges to cut
financial ties with Israel. Tensions over the war have been high on
campuses since the fall but demonstrations spread quickly following an
April 18 police crackdown on an encampment at Columbia University.</p>
<p>Nearly 3,000 people have been arrested on U.S. campuses over the past
month. As summer break approaches, there have been fewer new arrests and
campuses have been calmer. Still, colleges have been vigilant for
disruptions to commencement ceremonies.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden told the graduating class at Morehouse College on
Sunday, which included some students wearing keffiyeh scarves around
their shoulders on top of their black graduation robes, that he heard
their voices of protest and that scenes from the conflict in Gaza have
been heartbreaking. Biden said given what he called a “humanitarian
crisis” there, he had called for “an immediate cease-fire” and return of
hostages taken by Hamas.</p>
<p>The latest Israel-Hamas war began when Hamas and other militants
stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and
taking an additional 250 hostage. Palestinian militants still hold about
100 captives, while Israel’s military offensive has left more than
35,000 people in Gaza dead, according to the territory’s health
ministry, which doesn’t distinguish between civilians and
combatants.</p>

</p>
<p><a name="introduction"></a></p>
<p>
<p>A little over 51 years ago, a rocket lifted off from Cape Canaveral
carrying three astronauts and a space car. After a three day journey to
the moon, two of the astronauts climbed into a spindly lander and made
the short trip down to the surface, where for another three days they
collected rocks and did donuts in the space car. Then they climbed back
into the lander, rejoined their colleague in orbit, and departed for
Earth. Their capsule splashed down in the South Pacific on December 19,
1972. This mission, Apollo 17, would be the last time human beings
ventured beyond low Earth orbit.</p>
<p>
<p>If you believe NASA, late in 2026 Americans will walk on the moon
again. That proposed mission is called Artemis 3, and its lunar segment
looks a lot like Apollo 17 without the space car. Two astronauts will
land on the moon, collect rocks, take selfies, and about a week after
landing rejoin their orbiting colleagues to go back to Earth.</p>
<p>
<p>But where Apollo 17 launched on a single rocket and cost $3.3 billion
(in 2023 dollars), the first Artemis landing involves a dozen or two
heavy rocket launches and costs so much that NASA refuses to give a
figure (one veteran of NASA budgeting estimates it at $7-10
billion).<a id="fn_cost"></a><a class="fnote" href="#cost"><span
class="s9"><sup>[1]</sup></span></a> The single-use lander for the
mission will be the heaviest spacecraft ever flown, and yet the
mission’s scientific return—a small box of rocks—is less than what came
home on Apollo 17. And the whole plan hinges on technologies that
haven’t been invented yet becoming reliable and practical within the
next eighteen months.</p>
<p>
<p>You don’t have to be a rocket scientist to wonder what’s going on
here. If we can put a man on the moon, then why can’t we just go do it
again? The moon hasn’t changed since the 1960’s, while every technology
we used to get there has seen staggering advances. It took NASA eight
years to go from nothing to a moon landing at the dawn of the Space Age.
But today, twenty years and $93 billion after the space agency announced
our return to the moon, the goal seems as far out of reach as
ever.<a id="fn_nasatime"></a><a class="fnote" href="#nasatime"><span
class="s9"><sup>[2]</sup></span></a></p>
<p>
<p>Articles about Artemis often give the program’s tangled backstory.
But I want to talk about Artemis as a technical design, because there’s
just so much to drink in. While NASA is no stranger to complex mission
architectures, Artemis goes beyond complex to the just plain incoherent.
None of the puzzle pieces seem to come from the same box. Half the
program requires breakthrough technologies that make the other half
unnecessary. The rocket and spacecraft NASA spent two decades building
can’t even reach the moon. And for reasons no one understands, there’s a
new space station in the mix.</p>
<p>
<p>In the past, whatever oddball project NASA came up with, we at least
knew they could build the hardware. But Artemis calls the agency’s
competence as an engineering organization into question. For the first
time since the early 1960’s, it’s unclear whether the US space agency is
even <i>capable</i> of putting astronauts on the Moon.</p>
<p><br/></p>

</p>
<p>
<b><a name="apollo">A Note on Apollo</a></b>
</p>
<p>
<p>In this essay I make a lot of comparisons to Project Apollo. This is
not because I think other mission architectures are inferior, but
because the early success of that program sets such a useful baseline.
At the dawn of the Space Age, using rudimentary technology, American
astronauts landed on the moon six times in seven attempts. The moon
landings were NASA’s greatest achievement and should set a floor for
what a modern mission, flying modern hardware, might achieve.</p>
<p>
<p>Advocates for Artemis insist that the program is more than Apollo
2.0. But as we’ll see, Artemis can’t even measure up to Apollo 1.0. It
costs more, does less, flies less frequently, and exposes crews to risks
that the steely-eyed missile men of the Apollo era found unacceptable.
It’s as if Ford in 2024 released a new model car that was slower, more
accident-prone, and ten times more expensive than the Model T.</p>
<p>
<p>When a next-generation lunar program can’t meet the cost,
performance, or safety standards set three generations earlier,
something has gone seriously awry.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
<img src="https://idlewords.com/images/sls_image.jpg" width="100%" alt="Photograph of SLS rocket"></span>
</p>
<p>
<a name="sls"><b>I. The Rocket</b></a>
</p>
<p>
<p>The jewel of Artemis is a big orange rocket with a flavorless name,
the Space Launch System (SLS). SLS looks like someone started building a
Space Shuttle and ran out of legos for the orbiter. There is the
familiar orange tank, a big white pair of solid rocket boosters, but
then the rocket just peters out in a 1960’s style stack of cones and
cylinders.</p>
<p>
<p>The best way to think of SLS is as a balding guy with a mullet: there
are fireworks down below that are meant to distract you from a sad
situation up top. In the case of the rocket, those fireworks are a first
stage with more thrust than the Saturn V, enough thrust that the boosted
core stage can nearly put itself into orbit. But on top of this monster
sits a second stage so anemic that even its name (the Interim Cryogenic
Propulsion Stage) is a kind of apology. For eight minutes SLS roars into
the sky on a pillar of fire. And then, like a cork popping out of a
bottle, the tiny ICPS emerges and drifts vaguely moonwards on a wisp of
flame.</p>
<p>
<p>With this design, the minds behind SLS achieved a first in space
flight, creating a rocket that is at the same time more powerful and
less capable than the Saturn V. While the 1960’s giant could send 49
metric tons to the Moon, SLS only manages 27 tons—not enough to fly an
Apollo-style landing, not enough to even put a crew in orbit around the
Moon without a lander. The best SLS can do is slingshot the Orion
spacecraft once around the moon and back, a mission that will fly under
the name Artemis 2.</p>
<p>
<p>NASA wants to replace ICPS with an ‘Exploration Upper Stage’ (the
project has been held up, among other things, by a
<a href="https://oig.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/IG-22-012.pdf">near-billion
dollar cost overrun on a launch pad</a>). But even that upgrade won’t
give SLS the power of the Saturn V. For whatever reason, NASA designed
its first heavy launcher in forty years to be unable to fly the simple,
proven architecture of the Apollo missions.</p>
<p>
<p>Of course, plenty of rockets go on to enjoy rewarding, productive
careers without being as powerful as the Saturn V. And if SLS rockets
were piling up at the Michoud Assembly Facility like cordwood, or if
NASA were willing to let its astronauts fly commercial, it would be a
simple matter to split Artemis missions across multiple launches.</p>
<p>
<p>But NASA insists that astronauts fly SLS. And SLS is a “one and done”
rocket, artisanally hand-crafted by a workforce that likes to get home
before traffic gets bad. The rocket can only launch once every two years
at a cost of about four billion
dollars<a id="fn_slscost"></a><a class="fnote" href="#slscost"><span
class="s9"><sup>[3]</sup></span></a>—about twice what it would cost to
light the rocket’s weight in dollar bills on
fire<a id="fn_dollarbills"></a><a class="fnote" href="#dollarbills"><span
class="s9"><sup>[4]</sup></span></a>.</p>
<p>
<p>Early on, SLS designers made the catastrophic decision to reuse
Shuttle hardware, which is like using Fabergé eggs to save money on an
omelette. The SLS core stage recycles Space Shuttle main engines, actual
veterans of old Shuttle flights called out of retirement for one last
job. Refurbishing a single such engine to work on SLS costs NASA $40
million, or a bit more than SpaceX spends on all 33 engines on its
Superheavy
booster.<a id="fn_refurb"></a><a class="fnote" href="#refurb"><span
class="s9"><sup>[5]</sup></span></a> And though the Shuttle engines are
designed to be fully reusable (the main reason they’re so expensive),
every SLS launch throws four of them away. Once all the junkyards are
picked clean, NASA will pay Aerojet Rocketdyne to restart production of
the classic engine at a cool unit cost of $145
million<a id="fn_rs25restart"></a><a class="fnote" href="#rs25restart"><span
class="s9"><sup>[6]</sup></span></a>.</p>
<p>
<p>The story is no better with the solid rocket boosters, the other
piece of Shuttle hardware SLS reuses. Originally a stopgap measure
introduced to save the Shuttle budget, these heavy rockets now attach
themselves like barnacles to every new NASA launcher design. To no one’s
surprise, retrofitting a bunch of heavy steel casings left over from
Shuttle days has saved the program nothing. Each SLS booster is now
projected to cost $266 million, or about twice the launch cost of a
Falcon Heavy.<a id="fn_fheavy"></a><a class="fnote" href="#fheavy"><span
class="s9"><sup>[7]</sup></span></a> Just replacing the asbestos lining
in the boosters with a greener material, a project budgeted at $4.4M,
has now cost NASA a quarter of a billion dollars. And once the leftover
segments run out seven rockets from now, SLS will need a brand new
booster design, opening up fertile new vistas of overspending.</p>
<p>
<p>Costs on SLS have reached the point where private industry is now
able to develop, test, and launch an entire rocket <i>program</i> for
less than NASA spends on a single
engine<a id="fn_electron"></a><a class="fnote" href="#electron"><span
class="s9"><sup>[8]</sup></span></a>. Flying SLS is like owning a
classic car—everything is hand built, the components cost a fortune, and
when you finally get the thing out of the shop, you find yourself
constantly overtaken by younger rivals.</p>
<p>
<p>But the cost of SLS to NASA goes beyond money. The agency has
committed to an antiquated frankenrocket just as the space industry is
entering a period of unprecedented innovation. While other space
programs get to romp and play with technologies like reusable stages and
exotic alloys, NASA is stuck for years wasting a massive, skilled
workforce on a dead-end design.</p>
<p>
<p>The SLS program’s slow pace also affects safety. Back in the Shuttle
era, NASA managers argued that it took three to four launches a year to
keep workers proficient enough to build and launch the vehicles safely.
A boutique approach where workers hand-craft one rocket every two years
means having to re-learn processes and procedures with every launch.</p>
<p>
<p>It also leaves no room in Artemis for test flights. The program
simply assumes success, flying all its important ‘firsts’ with
astronauts on board. When there are unanticipated failures, like the
extensive heat shield spalling and near burn-through observed in Artemis
1,<a id="fn_heatshield"></a><a class="fnote" href="#heatshield"><span
class="s9"><sup>[9]</sup></span></a> the agency has no way to test a
proposed fix without a multi-year delay to the program. So they end up
using indirect means to convince themselves that a new design is safe to
fly, a process ripe for error and self-delusion.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://idlewords.com/images/orion_oversize.jpg" width="100%" alt="Orion space capsule with OVERSIZE LOAD banner"></span>
</p>
<p>
<b><a name="Orion">II. The Spacecraft</a></b>
</p>
<p>
<p>Orion, the capsule that launches on top of SLS, is a relaxed-fit
reimagining of the Apollo command module suitable for today’s larger
astronaut. It boasts modern computers, half again as much volume as the
1960’s design, and a few creature comforts (like not having to poop in a
baggie) that would have pleased the Apollo pioneers.</p>
<p>
<p>The capsule’s official name is the Orion Multipurpose Crew Vehicle,
but finding even a single purpose for Orion has greatly challenged NASA.
For twenty years the spacecraft has mostly sat on the ground, chewing
through a $1.2 billion annual budget. In 2014, the first Orion flew a
brief test flight. Eight short years later, Orion launched again,
carrying a crew of instrumented mannequins around the Moon on Artemis 1.
In 2025 the capsule (by then old enough to drink) is supposed to fly
human passengers on Artemis 2.</p>
<p>
<p>Orion goes to space attached to a basket of amenities called the
European Service Module. The ESM provides Orion with solar panels,
breathing gas, batteries, and a small rocket that is the capsule’s
principal means of propulsion. But because the ESM was never designed to
go to the moon, it carries very little propellant—far too little to get
the hefty capsule in and out of lunar
orbit.<a id="fn_oriondeltav"></a><a class="fnote" href="#oriondeltav"><span
class="s9"><sup>[10]</sup></span></a></p>
<p>
<p>And Orion is hefty. Originally designed to hold six astronauts, the
capsule was never resized when the crew requirement shrank to four. Like
an empty nester’s minivan, Orion now hauls around a bunch of mass and
volume that it doesn’t need. Even with all the savings that come from
replacing Apollo-era avionics, the capsule weighs almost twice as much
as the Apollo Command Module.</p>
<p>
<p>This extra mass has knock-on effects across the entire Artemis
design. Since a large capsule needs a large abort rocket, SLS has to
haul Orion’s massive Launch Abort System—seven tons of dead
weight—nearly all the way into orbit. And reinforcing the capsule so
that abort system won’t shake the astronauts into jelly means making it
heavier, which puts more demand on the parachutes and heat
shield,<a id="fn_heatshield"></a><a class="fnote" href="#heatshield"><span
class="s9"><sup>[11]</sup></span></a> and around and around we go.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p class="caption">
Size comparison of the Apollo command and service module (left) and
Orion + European Service Module (right)
</p>
<p>
<p>What’s particularly frustrating is that Orion and ESM together have
nearly the same mass as the Apollo command and service modules, which
had no trouble reaching the Moon. The difference is all in the
proportions. Where Apollo was built like a roadster, with a small crew
compartment bolted onto an oversized engine, Orion is the Dodge Journey
of spacecraft—a chunky, underpowered six-seater that advertises to the
world that you’re terrible at managing money.</p>
<p><br/><br/></p>
<p>
<img src="https://idlewords.com/images/nrho.jpg" width="100%" alt="diagram of near-rectilinear halo orbit"></span>
</p>
<p>
<b><a name="orbit">III. The Orbit</a></b>
</p>
<p>
<p>The fact that neither its rocket or spaceship can get to the Moon
creates difficulties for NASA’s lunar program. So, like an aging crooner
transposing old hits into an easier key, the agency has worked to find a
‘lunar-adjacent’ destination that its hardware can get to.</p>
<p>
<p>Their solution is a bit of celestial arcana called Near Rectilinear
Halo Orbit, or NRHO. A spacecraft in this orbit circles the moon every
6.5 days, passing 1,000 kilometers above the lunar north pole at closest
approach, then drifting out about 70,000 kilometers (a fifth of the
Earth/Moon distance) at its furthest point. Getting to NRHO from Earth
requires significantly less energy than entering a useful lunar orbit,
putting it just within reach for SLS and
Orion.<a id="fn_nrho"></a><a class="fnote" href="#nrho"><span
class="s9"><sup>[12]</sup></span></a></p>
<p>
<p>To hear NASA tell it, NRHO is so full of advantages that it’s a
wonder we stay on Earth. Spacecraft in the orbit always have a sightline
to Earth and never pass through its shadow. The orbit is relatively
stable, so a spacecraft can loiter there for months using only ion
thrusters. And the deep space environment is the perfect place to
practice going to Mars.</p>
<p>
<p>But NRHO is terrible for getting to the moon. The orbit is like one
of those European budget airports that leaves you out in a field
somewhere, requiring an expensive taxi. In Artemis, this taxi takes the
form of a whole other spaceship—the lunar lander—which launches without
a crew a month or two before Orion and is supposed to be waiting in NRHO
when the capsule arrives.</p>
<p>
<p>Once these two spacecraft dock together, two astronauts climb into
the lander from Orion and begin a day-long descent to the lunar surface.
The other two astronauts wait for them in NRHO, playing hearts and
quietly absorbing radiation.</p>
<p>
<p>Apollo landings also divided the crew between lander and orbiter. But
those missions kept the command module in a low lunar orbit that brought
it over the landing site every two hours. This proximity between orbiter
and lander had enormous implications for safety. At any point in the
surface mission, the astronauts on the moon could climb into the ascent
rocket, hit the big red button, and be back sipping Tang with the
command module pilot by bedtime. The short orbital period also gave the
combined crew a dozen opportunities a day to return directly to Earth.
<a id="fn_abort"></a><a class="fnote" href="#abort"><span
class="s9"><sup>[13]</sup></span></a></p>
<p>
<p>Sitting in NRHO makes abort scenarios much harder. Depending on when
in the mission it happens, a stricken lander might need three or more
days to catch up with the orbiting Orion. In the worst case, the crew
might find themselves stuck on the lunar surface for hours after an
abort is called, forced to wait for Orion to reach a more favorable
point in its orbit. And once everyone is back on Orion, more days might
pass before the crew can depart for Earth. These long and variable abort
times significantly increase risk to the crew, making many scenarios
that were survivable on Apollo (like Apollo 13!) lethal on Artemis.
<a id="fn_abortnrho"></a><a class="fnote" href="#abortnrho"><span
class="s9"><sup>[14]</sup></span></a></p>
<p>
<p>The abort issue is just one example of NRHO making missions slower.
NASA likes to boast that Orion can stay in space far longer than Apollo,
but this is like bragging that you’re in the best shape of your life
after the bank repossessed your car. It’s an oddly positive spin to put
on bad life choices. The reason Orion needs all that endurance is
because transit times from Earth to NRHO are long, and the crew has to
waste additional time in NRHO waiting for orbits to line up. The Artemis
3 mission, for example, will spend 24 days in transit, compared to just
6 days on Apollo 11.</p>
<p>
<p>NRHO even dictates how long astronauts stay on the Moon—surface time
has to be a multiple of the 6.5 day orbital period. This lack of
flexibility means that even early flag-and-footprints missions like
Artemis 3 have to spend at least a week on the moon, a constraint that
adds considerable risk to the initial landing.
<a id="fn_landingrisk"></a><a class="fnote" href="#landingrisk"><span
class="s9"><sup>[15]</sup></span></a></p>
<p>
<p>In spaceflight, brevity is safety. There’s no better way to protect
astronauts from the risks of solar storms, mechanical failure, and other
mishaps than by minimizing slack time in space. Moreover, a safe
architecture should allow for a rapid return to Earth at any point in
the mission. There’s no question astronauts on the first Artemis
missions would be better off with Orion in low lunar orbit. The decision
to stage from NRHO is an excellent example of NASA designing its lunar
program in the wrong direction—letting deficiencies in the hardware
dictate the level of mission risk.</p>

Early diagram of Gateway. Note that the segment marked ‘human lander

</p>
<p>
<b><a name="gateway">IV. Gateway</a></b>
</p>
<p>
<p>I suppose at some point we have to talk about Gateway. Gateway is a
small modular space station that NASA wants to build in NRHO. It has
been showing up across various missions like a bad smell since before
2012.</p>
<p>
<p>Early in the Artemis program, NASA described Gateway as a kind of
celestial truck stop, a safe place for the lander to park and for the
crew to grab a cup of coffee on their way to the moon. But when it
became clear that Gateway would not be ready in time for Artemis 3, NASA
re-evaluated. Reasoning that two spacecraft could meet up in NRHO just
as easily as three, the agency gave permission for the first moon
landing to proceed without a space station.</p>
<p>
<p>Despite this open admission that Gateway is unnecessary, building the
space station remains the core activity of the Artemis program. The
three missions that follow that first landing are devoted chiefly to
Gateway assembly. In fact, initial plans for Artemis 4 left out a lunar
landing entirely, as if it were an inconvenience to the real work being
done up in orbit.</p>
<p>
<p>This is a remarkable situation. It’s like if you hired someone to
redo your kitchen and they started building a boat in your driveway.
Sure, the boat gives the builders a place to relax, lets them practice
tricky plumbing and finishing work, and is a safe place to store their
tools. But all those arguments will fail to satisfy. You still want to
know what building a boat has to do with kitchen repair, and why you’re
the one footing the bill.</p>
<p>
<p>NASA has struggled to lay out a technical rationale for Gateway. The
space station adds both cost and complexity to Artemis, a program not
particularly lacking in either. Requiring moon-bound astronauts to stop
at Gateway also makes missions riskier (by adding docking operations)
while imposing a big propellant tax. Aerospace engineer and pundit
Robert Zubrin has aptly called the station a tollbooth in space.</p>
<p>
<p>Even Gateway defenders struggle to hype up the station. A common
argument is that Gateway may not ideal for any one thing, but is good
for a whole lot of things. But that is the same line of thinking that
got us SLS and Orion, both vehicles designed before anyone knew what to
do with them. The truth is that all-purpose designs don’t exist in human
space flight. The best you can do is build a spacecraft that is equally
bad at everything.</p>
<p>
<p>But to search for technical grounds is to misunderstand the purpose
of Gateway. The station is not being built to shelter astronauts in the
harsh environment of space, but to protect Artemis in the harsh
environment of Congress. NASA needs Gateway to navigate an uncertain
political landscape in the 2030’s. Without a station, Artemis will just
be a series of infrequent multibillion dollar moon landings, a red cape
waved in the face of the Office of Management and Budget. Gateway armors
Artemis by bringing in international partners, each of whom contributes
expensive hardware. As NASA learned building the International Space
Station, this combination of sunk costs and international entanglement
is a powerful talisman against program death.</p>
<p>
<p>Gateway also solves some other problems for NASA. It gives SLS a
destination to fly to, stimulates private industry (by handing out
public money to supply Gateway), creates a job for the astronaut corps,
and guarantees the continuity of human space flight once the ISS becomes
uninhabitable sometime in the 2030’s.
<a id="fn_iss"></a><a class="fnote" href="#iss"><span
class="s9"><sup>[16]</sup></span></a></p>
<p>
<p>That last goal may sound odd if you don’t see human space flight as
an end in itself. But NASA is a faith-based organization, dedicated to
the principle that taxpayers should always keep an American or two in
orbit. it’s a little bit as if the National Oceanic Atmospheric
Administration insisted on keeping bathyscapes full of sailors at the
bottom of the sea, irrespective of cost or merit, and kneecapped
programs that might threaten the continuous human benthic presence. You
can’t argue with faith.</p>
<p>
<p>From a bureaucrat’s perspective, Gateway is NASA’s ticket back to a
golden era in the early 2000’s when the Space Station and Space Shuttle
formed an uncancellable whole, each program justifying the existence of
the other. Recreating this dynamic with Gateway and SLS/Orion would mean
predictable budgets and program stability for NASA well into the
2050’s.</p>
<p>
<p>But Artemis was supposed to take us back to a different golden age,
the golden age of Apollo. And so there’s an unresolved tension in the
program between building Gateway and doing interesting things on the
moon. With Artemis missions two or more years apart, it’s inevitable
that Gateway assembly will push aspirational projects like a surface
habitat or pressurized rover out into the 2040’s. But those same
projects are on the critical path to Mars, where NASA still insists
we’re going in the late 2030’s. The situation is awkward.</p>
<p>
<p>So that is the story of Gateway—unloved, ineradicable, and as we’ll
see, likely to become the sole legacy of the Artemis program.</p>

<b><a name="lander">V. The Lander</a></b>
</p>
<p>
<p>The lunar lander is the most technically ambitious part of Artemis.
Where SLS, Orion, and Gateway are mostly a compilation of NASA’s
greatest hits, the lander requires breakthrough technologies with the
potential to revolutionize space travel.</p>
<p>
<p>Of course, you can’t just call it a lander. In Artemis speak, this
spacecraft is the Human Landing System, or HLS. NASA has delegated its
design to two private companies, Blue Origin and SpaceX. SpaceX is
responsible for landing astronauts on Artemis 3 and 4, while Blue Origin
is on the hook for Artemis 5 (notionally scheduled for 2030). After
that, the agency will take competitive bids for subsequent missions.</p>
<p>
<p>The SpaceX HLS design is based on their experimental Starship
spacecraft, an enormous rocket that takes off on and lands on its tail,
like 1950’s sci-fi. There is a strong “emperor’s new clothes” vibe to
this design. On the one hand, it is the brainchild of brilliant SpaceX
engineers and passed NASA technical review. On the other hand, the
lander seems to go out of its way to create problems for itself to solve
with technology.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://idlewords.com/images/hls_lem.jpg" width="100%" alt="artist's rendering of human landing system'"></span>
</p>
<p class="caption">
An early SpaceX rendering of the Human Landing System, with the Apollo
Lunar Module added for scale.
</p>
<p>
<p>To start with the obvious, HLS looks more likely to tip over than the
last two spacecraft to land on the moon, which
<a href="https://www.space.com/intuitive-machines-odysseus-moon-lander-tipped-over">tipped</a>
<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/japanese-moon-lander-reaches-surface-but-fate-uncertain/">over</a>.
It is a fifteen story tower that must land on its ass in terrible
lighting conditions, on rubble of unknown composition, over a
light-second from Earth. The crew are left suspended so high above the
surface that they need a folding space elevator (not the cool kind) to
get down. And yet in the end this single-use lander carries less payload
(both up and down) than the tiny Lunar Module on Apollo 17. Using
Starship to land two astronauts on the moon is like delivering a pizza
with an aircraft carrier.</p>
<p>
<p>Amusingly, the sheer size of the SpaceX design leaves it with little
room for cargo. The spacecraft arrives on the Moon laden with something
like 200 tons of cryogenic
propellant,<a id="fn_hlsprop"></a><a class="fnote" href="#hlsprop"><span
class="s9"><sup>[14]</sup></span></a> and like a fat man leaving an
armchair, it needs every drop of that energy to get its bulk back off
the surface. Nor does it help matters that all this cryogenic propellant
has to cook for a week in direct sunlight.</p>
<p>
<p>Other, less daring lander designs reduce their appetite for
propellant by using a detachable landing stage. This arrangement also
shields the ascent rocket from hypervelocity debris that gets kicked up
during landing. But HLS is a one-piece rocket; the same engines that get
sandblasted on their way down to the moon must relight without fail a
week later.</p>
<p>
<p>Given this fact, it’s remarkable that NASA’s contract with SpaceX
doesn’t require them to demonstrate a lunar takeoff. All SpaceX has to
do to satisfy NASA requirements is land an HLS prototype on the Moon.
Questions about ascent can then presumably wait until the actual
mission, when we all find out together with the crew whether HLS can
take off
again.<a id="fn_ascent"></a><a class="fnote" href="#ascent"><span
class="s9"><sup>[15]</sup></span></a></p>
<p>
<p>This fearlessness in design is part of a pattern with Starship HLS.
Problems that other landers avoid in the design phase are solved with
engineering. And it’s kind of understandable why SpaceX does it this
way. Starship is meant to fly to Mars, a much bigger challenge than
landing two people on the Moon. If the basic Starship design can’t
handle a lunar landing, it would throw the company’s whole Mars plan
into question. SpaceX is committed to making Starship work, which is
different from making the best possible lunar lander.</p>
<p>
<p>Less obvious is why NASA tolerates all this complexity in the most
hazardous phase of its first moon mission. Why land a rocket the size of
a building packed with moving parts? It’s hard to look at the HLS design
and not think back to other times when a room full of smart NASA people
talked themselves into taking major risks because the alternative was
not getting to fly at all.</p>
<p>
<p>It’s instructive to compare the HLS approach to the design philosophy
on Apollo. Engineers on that progam were motivated by terror; no one
wanted to make the mistake that would leave astronauts stranded on the
moon. The weapon they used to knock down risk was simplicity. The Lunar
Module was a small metal box with a wide stance, built low enough so
that the astronauts only needed to climb down a short ladder. The bottom
half of the LM was a descent stage that completely covered the ascent
rocket (a design that showed its value on Apollo 15, when one of the
descent engines got
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descent_propulsion_system#/media/File:Apollo_15_Engine_Bell.jpg">smushed
by a rock</a>). And that ascent rocket, the most important piece of
hardware in the lander, was a caveman design intentionally made so
primitive that it would struggle to find ways to fail.</p>
<p>
<p>On Artemis, it’s the other way around: the more hazardous the mission
phase, the more complex the hardware. It’s hard to look at all this
lunar machinery and feel reassured, especially when NASA’s own Aerospace
Safety Advisory Panel estimates that the Orion/SLS portion of a moon
mission alone (not including anything to do with HLS) already
<a href="https://oiir.hq.nasa.gov/asap/documents/2014_ASAP_Annual_Report.pdf">has
a 1:75 chance</a> of killing the crew.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://idlewords.com/images/fuel_fight.jpg" width="100%" alt="artist's rendering of human landing system'"></span>
</p>
<p>
<b><a name="refueling">VI. Refueling</a></b>
</p>
<p>
<p>Since NASA’s biggest rocket struggles to get Orion into distant lunar
orbit, and HLS weighs fifty times as much as Orion, the curious reader
might wonder how the unmanned lander is supposed to get up there.</p>
<p>
<p>NASA’s answer is, very sensibly, “not our problem”. They are paying
Blue Origin and SpaceX the big bucks to figure this out on their own.
And as a practical matter, the only way to put such a massive spacecraft
into NRHO is to first refuel it in low Earth orbit.</p>
<p>
<p>Like a lot of space technology, orbital refueling sounds simple, has
never been attempted, and can’t be adequately simulated on
Earth.<a id="fn_refuel"></a><a class="fnote" href="#refuel"><span
class="s9"><sup>[18]</sup></span></a> The crux of the problem is that
liquid and gas phases in microgravity jumble up into a three-dimensional
mess, so that even measuring the quantity of propellant in a tank
becomes difficult. To make matters harder, Starship uses cryogenic
propellants that boil at temperatures about a hundred degrees colder
than the plumbing they need to move through. Imagine trying to pour
water from a thermos into a red-hot skillet while falling off a cliff
and you get some idea of the difficulties.</p>
<p>
<p>To get refueling working, SpaceX will first have to demonstrate
propellant transfer between rockets as a proof of concept, and then get
the process working reliably and efficiently at a scale of hundreds of
tons. (These are two distinct challenges). Once they can routinely move
liquid oxygen and methane from Starship A to Starship B, they’ll be
ready to set up the infrastructure they need to launch HLS.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://idlewords.com/images/fueling_conops.jpg" width="100%" alt="artist's rendering of human landing system'"></span>
</p>
<p>
<p>The plan for getting HLS to the moon looks like this: a few months
before the landing date, SpaceX will launch a special variant of their
Starship rocket configured to serve as a propellant depot. Then they’ll
start launching Starships one by one to fill it up. Each Starship
arrives in low Earth orbit with some residual propellant; it will need
to dock with the depot rocket and transfer over this remnant fuel. Once
the depot is full, SpaceX will launch HLS, have it fill its tanks at the
depot rocket, and send it up to NRHO in advance of Orion. When Orion
arrives, HLS will hopefully have enough propellant left on board to take
on astronauts and make a single round trip from NRHO to the lunar
surface.</p>
<p>
<p>Getting this plan to work requires solving a second engineering
problem, how to keep cryogenic propellants cold in space. Low earth
orbit is a toasty place, and without special measures, the cryogenic
propellants Starship uses will quickly vent off into space. The problem
is easy to solve in deep space (use a sunshade), but becomes tricky in
low Earth orbit, where a warm rock covers a third of the sky. (Boil-off
is also a big issue for HLS on the moon.)</p>
<p>
<p>It’s not clear how many Starship launches it will take to refuel HLS.
Elon Musk has said four launches might be enough; NASA Assistant Deputy
Associate Administrator Lakiesha Hawkins says the number is in the “high
teens”. Last week, SpaceX’s Kathy Lueders
<a href="https://youtu.be/vOg49BVhU40?si=6q8R2qvkmEDPGy0V&t=2381">gave a
figure of fifteen launches</a>.</p>
<p>
<p>The real number is unknown and will come down to four factors:</p>
<ol>
<li>
How much propellant a Starship can carry to low Earth orbit.
</li>
<li>
What fraction of that can be usably pumped out of the rocket.
</li>
<li>
How quickly cryogenic propellant boils away from the orbiting depot.
</li>
<li>
How rapidly SpaceX can launch Starships.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
<p>SpaceX probably knows the answer to (1), but isn’t talking. Data for
(2) and (3) will have to wait for flight tests that are planned for
2025. And obviously a lot is riding on (4), also called launch
cadence.</p>
<p>
<p>The record for heavy rocket launch cadence belongs to Saturn V, which
launched three times during a four month period in 1968. Second place
belongs to the Space Shuttle, which flew nine times in the calendar year
before the Challenger disaster. In third place is Falcon Heavy, which
flew six times in a 13 month period beginning in November 2022.</p>
<p>
<p>For the refueling plan to work, Starship will have to break this
record by a factor of ten, launching every six days or so across
multiple launch facilities.
<a id="fn_cadence"></a><a class="fnote" href="#cadence"><span
class="s9"><sup>[1]</sup></span></a> The refueling program can tolerate
a few launch failures, as long as none of them damages a launch pad.</p>
<p>
<p>There’s no company better prepared to meet this challenge than
SpaceX. Their Falcon 9 rocket has shattered records for both reliability
and cadence, and now launches about once every three days. But it took
SpaceX ten years to get from the first orbital Falcon 9 flight to a
weekly cadence, and Starship is vastly bigger and more complicated than
the Falcon 9.
<a id="fn_falcon9"></a><a class="fnote" href="#falcon9"><span
class="s9"><sup>[20]</sup></span></a></p>
<p>
<p>Working backwards from the official schedule allows us to appreciate
the time pressure facing SpaceX. To make the official Artemis landing
date, SpaceX has to land an unmanned HLS prototype on the moon in early
2026. That means tanker flights to fill an orbiting depot would start in
late 2025. This doesn’t leave a lot of time for the company to invent
orbital refueling, get it working at scale, make it efficient, deal with
boil-off, get Starship launching reliably, begin recovering booster
stages,<a id="fn_recovery"></a><a class="fnote" href="#recovery"><span
class="s9"><sup>[21]</sup></span></a> set up additional launch
facilities, achieve a weekly cadence, and at the same time design and
test all the other systems that need to go into HLS.</p>
<p>
<p>Lest anyone think I’m picking on SpaceX, the development schedule for
Blue Origin’s 2029 lander is even more fantastical. That design requires
pumping tons of liquid hydrogen between spacecraft in lunar orbit, a
challenge perhaps an order of magnitude harder than what SpaceX is
attempting. Liquid hydrogen is bulky, boils near absolute zero, and is
infamous for its ability to leak through anything (the Shuttle program
couldn’t get a handle on hydrogen leaks on Earth even after a hundred
some launches). And the rocket Blue Origin needs to test all this
technology has never left the ground.</p>
<p>
<p>The upshot is that NASA has put a pair of last-minute long-shot
technology development programs between itself and the moon.
Particularly striking is the contrast between the ambition of the HLS
designs and the extreme conservatism and glacial pace of SLS/Orion. The
same organization that spent 23 years and 20 billion dollars building
the world’s most vanilla spacecraft demands that SpaceX darken the sky
with Starships within four years of signing the initial HLS contract.
While thrilling for SpaceX fans, this is pretty unserious behavior from
the nation’s space agency, which had several decades’ warning that going
to the moon would require a lander.</p>
<p>
<p>All this to say, it’s universally understood that there won’t be a
moon landing in 2026. At some point NASA will have to officially slip
the schedule, as it did in 2021, 2023, and at the start of this year. If
this accelerating pattern of delays continues, by year’s end we might
reach a state of continuous postponement, a kind of scheduling
singularity where the landing date for Artemis 3 recedes smoothly and
continuously into the future.</p>
<p>
<p>Otherwise, it’s hard to imagine a manned lunar landing before 2030,
if the Artemis program survives that long.</p>

<p>
<b><a name="conclusion">VII. Conclusion</a></b>
</p>
<p>
<p>I want to stress that there’s nothing wrong with NASA making big bets
on technology. Quite the contrary, the audacious HLS contracts may be
the healthiest thing about Artemis. Visionaries at NASA identified a
futuristic new energy source (space billionaire egos) and found a way to
tap it on a fixed-cost basis. If SpaceX or Blue Origin figure out how to
make cryogenic refueling practical, it will mean a big step forward for
space exploration, exactly the thing NASA should be encouraging. And if
the technology doesn’t pan out, we’ll have found that out mostly by
spending Musk’s and Bezos’s money.</p>
<p>
<p>The real problem with Artemis is that it doesn’t think through the
consequences of its own success. A working infrastructure for orbital
refueling would make SLS and Orion superfluous. Instead of waiting two
years to go up on a $4 billion rocket, crews and cargo could launch
every weekend on cheap commercial rockets, refueling in low Earth orbit
on their way to the Moon. A similar logic holds for Gateway. Why
assemble a space station out of habitrail pieces out in lunar orbit,
like an animal, when you can build one on Earth and launch it in one
piece? Better yet, just spraypaint “<b>GATEWAY</b>” on the side of the
nearest Starship, send it out to NRHO, and save NASA and its
international partners billions. Having a working gas station in low
Earth orbit fundamentally changes what is possible, in a way the
SLS/Orion arm of Artemis doesn’t seem to recognize.</p>
<p>
<p>Conversely, if SpaceX and Blue Origin can’t make cryogenic refueling
work, then NASA has no plan B for landing on the moon. All the Artemis
program will be able to do is assemble Gateway. Promising taxpayers the
moon only to deliver ISS Jr. does not broadcast a message of national
greatness, and is unlikely to get Congress excited about going to Mars.
The hurtful comparisons between American dynamism in the 1960’s and
whatever it is we have now will practically write themselves.</p>
<p>
<p>What NASA is doing is like an office worker blowing half their salary
on lottery tickets while putting the other half in a pension fund. If
the lottery money comes through, then there was really no need for the
pension fund. But without the lottery win, there’s not enough money in
the pension account to retire on. The two strategies don’t make sense
together.</p>
<p>
<p>There’s a ‘realist’ school of space flight that concedes all this but
asks us to look at the bigger picture. We’re never going to have the
perfect space program, the argument goes, but the important thing is
forward progress. And Artemis is the first program in years to survive a
presidential transition and have a shot at getting us beyond low Earth
orbit. With Artemis still funded, and Starship making rapid progress, at
some point we’ll finally see American astronauts back on the moon.</p>
<p>
<p>But this argument has two flaws. The first is that it feeds a cycle
of dysfunction at NASA that is rapidly making it impossible for us to go
anywhere. Holding human space flight to a different standard than NASA’s
science missions has been a disaster for space exploration. Right now
the Exploration Systems Development Mission Directorate (the entity
responsible for manned space flight) couldn’t build a toaster for less
than a billion dollars. Incompetence, self-dealing, and mismanagement
that end careers on the science side of NASA are not just tolerated but
rewarded on the human space flight side. Before we let the agency build
out its third white elephant project in forty years, it’s worth
reflecting on what we’re getting in return for half our exploration
budget.</p>
<p>
<p>The second, more serious flaw in the “realist” approach is that it
enables a culture of institutional mendacity that must ultimately be
fatal at an engineering organization. We’ve reached a point where NASA
lies constantly, to both itself and to the public. It lies about
schedules and capabilities. It lies about the costs and the benefits of
its human spaceflight program. And above all, it lies about risk. All
the institutional pathologies identified in the Rogers Report and the
Columbia Accident Investigation Board are alive and well in
Artemis—groupthink, management bloat, intense pressure to meet
impossible deadlines, and a willingness to manufacture engineering
rationales to justify flying unsafe hardware.</p>
<p>
<p>Do we really have to wait for another tragedy, and another
beautifully produced Presidential Commission report, to see that Artemis
is broken?</p>

<p>
<p><a id="cost"></a><a class="fnote" href="#fn_cost">[1]</a> Without
NASA’s help, it’s hard to put a dollar figure on a mission without
making somewhat arbitrary decisions about what to include and exclude.
The $7-10 billion estimate comes from a Bush-era official in the Office
of Management and Budget commenting
<a href="https://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?topic=60228.msg2559545#msg2559545">on

<blockquote>
And that $7.2B assumes Artemis III stays on schedule. Based on the FY24
budget request, each additional year between Artemis II and Artemis III
adds another $3.5B to $4.0B in Common Exploration to Artemis III. If
Artemis III goes off in 2027, then it will be $10.8B total. If 2028,
then $14.3B.
</blockquote>
<p>
<p>In other words, it’s hard to break out an actual cost while the
launch dates for both Artemis II and III keep slipping.</p>
<p>
<p>NASA’s own Inspector General estimates the cost of
<a href="https://oig.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/IG-22-003.pdf">just

<p>
<p><a id="slscost"></a><a class="fnote" href="#fn_slscost">[3]</a> NASA
refuses to track the per-launch cost of SLS, so it’s easy to get into
nerdfights. Since the main cost driver on SLS is the gigantic workforce
employed on the project, something like two or three times the headcount
of SpaceX, the cost per launch depends a lot on cadence. If you assume a
yearly launch rate (the official line), then the rocket costs $2.1
billion a launch. If like me you think one launch every two years is
optimistic, the cost climbs up into the $4-5 billion range.</p>
<p>

In particular, the separation bolts embedded in the Orion heat shield
were built based on a flawed thermal model, and need to be redesigned to
safely fly a crew. From

OIG report</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
Separation bolt melt beyond the thermal barrier during reentry can
expose the vehicle to hot gas ingestion behind the heat shield,
exceeding Orion’s structural limits and resulting in the breakup of the
vehicle and loss of crew. Post-flight inspections determined there was a
discrepancy in the thermal model used to predict the bolts’ performance
pre-flight. Current predictions using the correct information suggest
the bolt melt exceeds the design capability of Orion.
</blockquote>
<p>
<p>The current plan is to work around these problems on Artemis 2, and
then redesign the components for Artemis 3. That means astronauts have
to fly at least twice with an untested heat shield design.</p>

about 900 m/s of total delta V to get in and out of NHRO, comfortably
within Orion/ESM’s 1340 m/s budget. (See
<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/nrho-artemis-orbit.pdf">source</a>.)</p>
<p>
<p><a id="abort"></a><a class="fnote" href="#fn_abort">[12]</a> In
<i>Carrying the Fire</i>, Apollo 11 astronaut Michael Collins recalls
carrying a small notebook covering 18 lunar rendezvous scenarios he
might be called on to fly in various contingencies. If the Lunar Module
could get itself off the surface, there was probably a way to dock with
it.</p>

<p>For those too young to remember, Tang is a powdered orange drink
<a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/lifestyle/how-nasa-made-tang-cool">closely
associated</a> with the American space program.</p>
<p>
<p><a id="abortnrho"></a><a class="fnote" href="#fn_abortnrho">[13]</a>
For a detailed (if somewhat cryptic) discussion of possible Artemis
abort modes to NRHO, see
<a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20230002566/downloads/HLS%20NRHO%20to%20Lunar%20Surface%20and%20Back%20Mission%20Design_STRIVES.pptx.pdf">HLS
NRHO to Lunar Surface and Back Mission Design</a>, NASA 2022.</p>
<p>
<p><a id="hlsprop"></a><a class="fnote" href="#fn_hlsprop">[14]</a> This
is my own speculative guess; the answer is very sensitive to the dry
weight of HLS and the boil-off rate of its cryogenic propellants. Delta
V from the lunar surface to NRHO is 2,610 m/sec. Assuming HLS weighs 120
tons unfueled, it would need about 150 metric tons of propellant to get
into NRHO from the lunar surface. Adding safety margin, fuel for docking
operations, and allowing for a week of boiloff gets me to about 200
tons.</p>
<p>
<p><a id="landingrisk"></a><a class="fnote" href="#fn_landingrisk">[15]</a>
The main safety issue is the difficult thermal environment at the
landing site, where the Sun sits just above the horizon, heating half
the lander. If it weren’t for the NRHO constraint, it’s very unlikely
Artemis 3 would spend more than a day or two on the lunar surface.</p>
<p>
<p><a id="iss"></a><a class="fnote" href="#fn_iss">[16]</a> The ISS
program has been repeatedly extended, but the station is coming up
against physical limiting factors (like metal fatigue) that will soon
make it too dangerous to use.</p>
<p>
<p><a id="ascent"></a><a class="fnote" href="#fn_ascent">[17]</a> Recent
comments by NASA suggest SpaceX has
<a href="https://twitter.com/jeff_foust/status/1783877352432263175">voluntarily
added an ascent phase</a> to its landing demo, ending a pretty untenable
situation. However, there’s still no requirement that the unmanned
landing/ascent demo be performed using the same lander design that will
fly on the actual mission, another oddity in the HLS contract.</p>
<p>
<p><a id="refuel"></a><a class="fnote" href="#fn_refuel">[18]</a> To be
precise, I’m talking about moving bulk propellant between rockets in
orbit. There are resupply flights to the International Space Station
that deliver about 850 kilograms of non-cryogenic propellant to boost
the station in its orbit, and there have been small-scale experiments in
refueling satellites. But no one has attempted refueling a flown rocket
stage in space, cryogenic or otherwise.</p>
<p>
<p><a id="cadence"></a><a class="fnote" href="#fn_cadence">[19]</a></p>
<p>Both SpaceX’s &lt;a
href=“https://youtu.be/vOg49BVhU40?si=6q8R2qvkmEDPGy0V&amp;t=2381”“&gt;Kathy
Lueders</a> and NASA confirm Starship needs to launch from multiple
sites. Here’s an excerpt from
<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/heoc-november-2023-final-v2.pdf">the
minutes</a> of the NASA Advisory Council Human Exploration and
Operations Committee meeting on November 17 and 20, 2023:</p>
<blockquote>
Mr. [Wayne] Hale asked where Artemis III will launch from. [Assistant
Deputy AA for Moon to Mars Lakiesha] Hawkins said that launch pads will
be used in Florida and potentially Texas. The missions will need quite a
number of tankers; in order to meet the schedule, there will need to be
a rapid succession of launches of fuel, requiring more than one site for
launches on a 6-day rotation schedule, and multiples of launches.
</blockquote>
<p>
<p><a id="falcon9"></a><a class="fnote" href="#fn_falcon9">[20]</a>
Falcon 9 first flew in June of 2010 and achieved a weekly launch cadence
over a span of six launches starting in November 2020.</p>
<p>
<p><a id="recovery"></a><a class="fnote" href="#fn_recovery">[21]</a>
Recovering Superheavy stages is not a NASA requirement for HLS, but it’s
a huge cost driver for SpaceX given the number of launches involved.</p>

backup app written in Python. It’s blazing fast and features great
de-duplication. To get started with Borg, follow the installation
instructions here. Then, initialize a backup with this command: borg
