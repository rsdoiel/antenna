## The Best Idea From Today’s Big Oil Hearing

date: 2024-05-01, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjE1MTA0My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczNDk5ODcwOH0.5m-lA5ES3xIUkPBzQ10tfOjOITQ3-2QXxVd-KNT213M/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p>It was always a fantasy to think that the Senate Committee on the Budget’s <a href="https://www.budget.senate.gov/hearings/denial-disinformation-and-doublespeak_big-oils-evolving-efforts-to-avoid-accountability-for-climate-change" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>hearing</u></a> on oil disinformation would actually be about oil disinformation. It was still shocking, though, how far off the rails things ran.</p><p>The hearing concerned a <a href="https://www.budget.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/fossil_fuel_report1.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>report</u></a> released Tuesday by the committee along with Democrats in the House documenting “the extensive efforts undertaken by fossil fuel companies to deceive the public and investors about their knowledge of the effects of their products on climate change and to undermine efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions.” This builds on the already extensive literature documenting the fossil fuel industry’s deliberate dissemination of lies about climate change and its role in causing it, including the 2010 book <em><em>Merchants of Doubt </em></em>and a 2015 Pulitzer Prize-nominated series from <em><em>Inside Climate News </em></em>on Exxon’s climate denial PR machine. But more, of course, is more.</p><p>The new stuff in the joint congressional report includes evidence that fossil fuel companies accepted the validity of climate research internally while publicly attacking it, and that they hailed technologies like carbon capture and algae-based fuels while privately doubting they would ever achieve meaningful scale. The report also details how all six entities it investigated — fossil fuel companies Exxon, Chevron, Shell, and BP, plus the American Petroleum Institute and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce — slow-walked the investigation, providing redacted documents in response to subpoenas and withholding others altogether.</p><p>“If the companies had fully complied in good faith,” said Rep. Jamie Raskin, the House committee’s ranking Democrat, in his prepared remarks, “who knows what else we might have uncovered?”</p><p>The thing about these kinds of political exercises is that, well, they’re political. While there is indisputable value in investigating and recording the industry’s misdeeds, a congressional hearing is no venue for the earnest pursuit of truth.</p><p>The various members of the Senate Budget Committee took turns yanking Raskin off-message — and that included the Democrats. Sen. Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, went into full denial mode, speaking of “climate change alarmism” and concluding that “there’s literally nothing we can do about this other than adapt.” When Sen. Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, had his turn, however, he subjected Raskin to volleys of questions about forest fires and plastics, neither of which were a subject of the (to be clear, extensive) committee report.</p><p>My personal favorite moment in the hearing came after the break, when Raskin gave way to a panel of energy policy and disinformation experts including Sharon Eubanks, who led the Department of Justice case against Big Tobacco. In her opening statement, Eubanks stated plainly and clearly an idea <a href="https://theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/05/us-lawsuit-big-tobacco-big-oil-fossil-fuel-companies" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>she</u></a> and others (both <a href="https://www.ucsusa.org/about/news/science-group-encouraged-congressional-call-doj-investigate-big-oil" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>outside and inside</u></a> the federal government) have been propounding for years.</p><p>“The similarities between the conduct of the tobacco industry and the petroleum industry form a solid and appropriate basis for investigating the petroleum industry,” she read into the congressional record. “Furthermore, we should not waste any more time wringing our hands about what can be done. There exists solid evidentiary basis to move forward with a request to the Department of Justice to investigate the actions of the fossil fuel industry.”</p><p>But that’s not even the good part.</p><p>Sen. Bernie Sanders was midway through a line of questioning about how such a prosecution might go down when he stumbled a bit asking about the damages paid in the tobacco case. “I don’t remember exactly what the settlement for tobacco was — it was huge,” he said, when Eubanks cut in. </p><p>"It wasn’t a settlement. I won,” she told Sanders. “The companies were forced to change the way they do business." And that, she went on to say, is the point of all this — not extracting money, although that’s nice too, but rather to force companies to operate in a more open and honest fashion.</p><p>The companies, for their part, are unsurprisingly unruffled by this latest demonstration of their deceitful behavior. “These are tired allegations that have already been publicly addressed through previous Congressional hearings on the same topic and litigation in the courts,” an Exxon spokesperson told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-30/us-lawmakers-call-out-exxon-chevron-shell-bp-for-greenwashing" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>Bloomberg</em></em></u></a> yesterday. “As we have said time and time again, climate change is real.”</p><p>In one thing, at least, Exxon isn’t wrong: These allegations <em><em>are</em></em> tired. I myself am not a lawyer, of course, but it might be time to listen to Eubanks. She seems to know what she’s talking about.</p>

## Does Carbon Removal Need to Be Dumb To Work?

date: 2024-05-01, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjE1MDg4NS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcyMDg4NjEyOX0.AQDqJA37sUUkPzRWD-J4cXGXsFJwiu-eWWw16QlROB0/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">Most climate solutions are getting smarter. Solar panels can track the sun. Electric vehicles are equipped with the equivalent of an iPad and may soon be able to drive themselves (<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/tesla-supercharger-layoffs" target="_self"><u>according to some people</u></a>). Startups are inventing <a href="https://heatmap.news/impulse-labs-cooktop-sam-damico-induction-stove" target="_self"><u>stoves with batteries</u></a> that charge when energy is cheap and <a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/heat-pump-gradient-quilt-electric-air" target="_self"><u>heat pumps</u></a> that learn how you use your home and adjust accordingly. </p><p>But when it comes to permanently removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, the market is pushing in a different direction. There, it seems, there’s growing excitement for the dumbest, most primitive solutions companies can come up with.</p><p>The case in point this week is a $58 million agreement between Frontier, a fund started by tech companies to help grow the carbon removal market, and Vaulted Deep, a startup that collects food waste, poop, and other wet, sludgy, organic material and stashes it away underground. It’s the biggest deal Frontier has made to date, followed closely by a <a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-episode-4-enhanced-rock-weathering" target="_self"><u>$57 million contract it signed in December with Lithos Carbon</u></a>, which crushes up rocks and sprinkles the dust on agricultural fields. The rock naturally reacts with carbon dioxide in the air to form bicarbonate, which can essentially lock it away permanently. </p><p>There are <a href="https://alliedoffsets.com/cdr-data/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>at least 850 startups</u></a> around the world trying to figure out the most effective, scalable, low-cost approach to cleaning up the legacy carbon pollution that’s warming the planet. Some of the most promising solutions have involved building big, energy-intensive systems that extract tiny amounts of carbon dioxide from the ambient air. One company I <a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/carbon-removal-orchard-one-spiritus" target="_self"><u>recently wrote about</u></a> is manufacturing millions of tennis ball-sized sponges that will be stacked in trays, absorb carbon from the air, and then transferred into an oven to bake off the carbon. </p><p>Is it possible the answer could be as easy as pulverizing rocks and burying waste?</p><p>I ran my observation about the growing enthusiasm for dumb ideas past Hannah Bebbington, a strategy lead at Frontier, and she agreed — “totally,” she said, though she preferred the phrase “low-tech.” Compared to some of the earlier stars of carbon removal, Vaulted Deep and Lithos don’t require as much upfront capital investment or years and years of research and development. “At the end of the day, we are really excited about getting to gigaton scale carbon removal, and it doesn’t have to be the sexiest technology.”</p><p>So far, it seems, these lower-tech companies have been able to scale quickly. Vaulted Deep, for instance, launched at the end of August last year and has already delivered more than 2,400 tons of carbon removal. By comparison, the <a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/eenews/2023/11/10/first-u-s-direct-air-capture-plant-opens-in-calif-00126521" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>only operating direct air capture facility</u></a> in the United States is capable of removing 1,000 tons of CO2 per year. </p><p>Vaulted Deep’s first project is in Kansas, where it is intercepting “woody waste” like grass clippings and tree trimmings that was destined to be incinerated. Once upon a time, when that food was a crop growing in a field, it sucked up carbon from the atmosphere. If the food waste had been burned, the carbon would have been released back into the air. By slurrifying the waste and injecting it into a deep well, hundreds of feet underground, Vaulted Deep disrupts the cycle, potentially for millennia. </p><p>One advantage of this approach is that the carbon capture work is done for free, courtesy of photosynthesis. (Trees, of course, do this too, but not permanently.) Another is that Vaulted Deep uses mature technology to turn the waste into a slurry that can be injected underground. The company was spun out of Advantek, a waste management business that pioneered slurry injection in the 1980s. Most of the substances we inject into the layers of rock underneath our feet are pure liquid or gas, Julia Reichelstein, the CEO of Vaulted Deep told me. Advantek’s technology enables the company to take solid waste and, with minimal processing and energy, get it injection-ready.</p><p>The company’s third advantage is being able to pump its waste into “class five” wells, a designation made by the Environmental Protection Agency. Class five is sort of a catch-all category, encompassing shallow wells used for stormwater drainage and septic systems, to deep wells used for geothermal power. Regulations vary by type and by state, but in general, these are much more common and easier to permit than the “class six” wells used for carbon dioxide sequestration. “There’s, you know, 20, 30 years of permit history now on best practices on how you permit a slurry injection well,” Omar Abou-Sayed, the company’s co-founder, told me. “We comply with or exceed all those regulations. So this isn’t a case of, like, move fast and break things.”</p><p>All of this allows Vaulted Deep to charge less for carbon removal than many of its peers — closer to $400 per ton, as opposed to upwards of $600. Bebbington, of Frontier, thinks there’s a promising path to bring costs down a lot further if the company can achieve economies of scale by buying the sludgy organic waste in bulk, or move its injection wells closer to where the material originates.</p><p>But any climate solution involving biomass raises a host of questions about where the material came from, and what might have been done with it otherwise. Reichelstein said the company’s internal research found that there was almost a billion tons of bio-sludge produced in the U.S. annually. If it could capture all of it, the company estimated, it could sequester more than 300 million tons of carbon away from the atmosphere each year, after taking into account the emissions involved in collecting, processing, and injecting all that waste.</p><p>And yet, “The definition of a ‘waste’ is highly contested,” Freya Chay, program lead at the nonprofit CarbonPlan, which analyzes the integrity of different carbon removal approaches, told me.</p><p>For example, some companies are eyeing the use of agricultural waste like corn stalks, which are often left to decompose in fields, but also add nutrients to the soil. If the corn waste is removed and processed and buried underground, will that increase the use of carbon-intensive fertilizer? What if the waste was going into a landfill? There, it would have broken down eventually, but much more slowly than if it had been burned. </p><p>These questions get more complicated as projects that utilize waste biomass scale up. Once there’s more of a market for the material, will those counterfactuals that support what Vaulted Deep is doing — like that the waste would have been incinerated — still hold? “It's really hard to govern system-level risks with project-level rules, but that is the situation we are in,” said Chay.</p><p>At a second project location, in Los Angeles, Vaulted Deep is collecting sewage from the city’s wastewater treatment facilities that otherwise would have been trucked hundreds of miles out of the city and <a href="https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-kern-county-waste-settlement-20170824-story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>spread on farmland to decompose</u></a>, releasing CO2 both during the transport and as it decays. The city has actually been paying Advantek to dispose of some of its sewage since 2008. But now, because of the Frontier deal, the company will drop its fee, allowing the city to divert even more of the waste for slurry injection.</p><p>Chay didn’t have any immediate concerns about Vaulted Deep’s biomass sourcing. In fact, she highlighted the co-benefits the company would provide. Oftentimes biomass waste is contaminated with toxic chemicals, and Vaulted Deep is preventing it from getting dumped in communities. “We should celebrate that,” she said.</p><p><em>Editor’s note: This story has been updated to correct the type of waste diverted for the Kansas project.</em><br/></p>

## Arizona lawmakers vote to repeal 19th century abortion ban

date: 2024-05-01, from: VOA News USA

phoenix — Democrats secured enough votes in the Arizona Senate on Wednesday to repeal a Civil War-era ban on abortions that the state's highest court recently allowed to take effect.


Voting wasn't complete but the Senate had the 16 votes it needed to advance the bill.


Fourteen Democrats in the Senate were joined by two Republican votes in favor of repealing the bill, which narrowly cleared the Arizona House last week and is expected to be signed by Democratic Governor Katie Hobbs.


The near-total ban, which predates Arizona's statehood, permits abortions only to save the mother's life — and provides no exceptions for survivors of rape or incest. In a ruling last month, the Arizona Supreme Court suggested doctors could be prosecuted under the 1864 law, which says that anyone who assists in an abortion can be sentenced to two to five years in prison.


If the repeal bill is signed, a 2022 statute banning the procedure after 15 weeks of pregnancy would become Arizona's prevailing abortion law. Still, there would likely be a period when nearly all abortions would be outlawed because the repeal won't take effect until 90 days after the end of the legislative session, likely in June or July.


Several senators spoke about their motivations for voting as numbers were tallied on the repeal bill.


"This is a clear statement that the Legislature does not want the territorial ban to be enforceable," said Democratic state Senator Priya Sundareshan, who voted yes to repeal.


There were numerous disruptions from people in Senate gallery, as Republican state Senator Shawnna Bolick explained her vote in favor of repeal, joining with Democrats.


Republican state Senator Jake Hoffman denounced Republican colleagues for joining with Democratic colleagues, calling it an affront to his party's principles.


"It is disgusting that this is the state of the Republican Party today," Hoffman said.


Advocates on both sides of the abortion issue arrived outside the Arizona Senate on Wednesday to emphasize their views. They included people affiliated with Planned Parenthood and faith-based groups opposed to abortion.


"I am expecting it will be repealed, but I am praying it won't be," said Karen Frigon, who was handing out brochures from the Arizona Right to Life.


Arizona is one of a handful of battleground states that will decide the next president. Former President Donald Trump, who has warned that the issue could lead to Republican losses, has avoided endorsing a national abortion ban but said he's proud to have appointed the Supreme Court justices who allowed states to outlaw it.


When Roe v. Wade was overturned in June 2022 though, then-Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, a Republican, persuaded a state judge that the 1864 ban could again be enforced. Still, the law hasn't been enforced while the case was making its way through the courts.


Advocates are collecting signatures for a ballot measure allowing abortions until a fetus could survive outside the womb, typically around 24 weeks, with exceptions — to save the parent's life, or to protect her physical or mental health.


Republican lawmakers, in turn, are considering putting one or more competing abortion proposals on the November ballot.

## Russia breached global chemical weapons ban in Ukraine war, US says

date: 2024-05-01, from: VOA News USA

washington — The United States on Wednesday accused Russia of violating the international chemical weapons ban by deploying the choking agent chloropicrin against Ukrainian troops and using riot control agents "as a method of warfare" in Ukraine.


"The use of such chemicals is not an isolated incident and is probably driven by Russian forces' desire to dislodge Ukrainian forces from fortified positions and achieve tactical gains on the battlefield," the State Department said in a statement.


The Russian Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.


Chloropicrin is listed as a banned choking agent by the Hague-based Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), which was created to implement and monitor compliance with the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).


German forces fired the gas against Allied troops during World War I in one of the first uses of a chemical weapon.


Earlier this month, Reuters reported the Ukrainian military as saying Russia has stepped up its illegal of use riot control agents as it presses its biggest advances in eastern Ukraine in more than two years.


In addition to chloropicrin, Russian forces have used grenades loaded with CS and CN gases, the Ukrainian military says. It says at least 500 Ukrainian soldiers have been treated for exposure to toxic substances and one was killed by suffocating on tear gas.


While civilians usually can escape riot control gases during protests, soldiers stuck in trenches without gas masks must either flee under enemy fire or risk suffocating.


The State Department said it was delivering to Congress its determination that Russia's use of chloropicrin against Ukrainian troops violated the CWC.


Moscow's use of the gas "comes from the same playbook as its operations to poison" the late opposition leader Alexey Navalny in 2020 and Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in 2018 with the Novichok nerve agent, the statement said.


Russia denied involvement in both cases.


The department also determined that Russia has breached the CWC's prohibition on the use of riot control agents as a method of warfare, the statement said.


It said it was sanctioning three Russian state entities linked to Moscow's chemical and biological weapons programs, including a specialized military unit that facilitated the use of chloropicrin against Ukrainian troops.


Four Russian companies that support the three entities were also sanctioned, it said.


The sanctions freeze any U.S. assets belonging to the targeted entities and generally prohibit Americans from doing business with them.


Separately, the U.S. Treasury imposed sanctions on three entities and two individuals involved in purchasing items for Russian military institutes involved in the country's chemical and biological weapons programs.


The sanctions were among new measures announced by the United States on Wednesday targeting Russia over its 2022 invasion of Ukraine.


The CWC bans the production and use of chemical weapons. It also requires the 193 countries that have ratified the convention, which include Russia and the U.S., to destroy any stocks of banned chemicals.


The State Department was expected to convey its determination that Russia has violated the CWC to the OPCW.


Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of breaching the treaty in OPCW meetings. But the organization says it has not been formally asked to open an investigation into the use of prohibited substances in Ukraine.


Reuters has not been able to independently verify the use of banned chemical substances by either side.

## Botched US student aid application form rollout leaves many in limbo

date: 2024-05-01, from: VOA News USA

Washington — The last thing standing between Ashnaelle Bijoux and her college dream is the FAFSA form — a financial aid application that's supposed to help students go to college but is blocking her instead. She has tried to submit it over and over. Every time, it fails to go through.


"I feel overwhelmed and stressed out," said Bijoux, 19. She came close to tears the last time she tried the form. "I feel like I'm being held back."


Normally a time of celebration for high school seniors, this spring has been marred by the federal government's botched rollout of the new FAFSA application. By May 1, students usually know where they're headed to college in the fall. This year, most still haven't received financial aid offers. Three months before the start of fall classes, many don't know where they're going to college, or how they're going to pay for it.


"We're asking them to make probably one of the biggest financial decisions — and decisions that will have the biggest implications on their lives going forward — without all of the information," said Justin Draeger, president and CEO of the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators.


FAFSA, or Free Application for Federal Student Aid, went through a massive overhaul that was supposed to make it simpler and shorter. But a series of blunders by the Education Department made it harder than ever, delaying college decisions by months and raising fears that hundreds of thousands of students will forgo college entirely.


Across the United States, the number of students who have successfully submitted the FAFSA is down 29% from this time last year, and it's even worse at schools with more low-income students, according to the National College Attainment Network.


The group's CEO, Kim Cook, warned members of Congress this month about a potentially "catastrophic" drop in college enrollments that would make the decreases of the pandemic seem mild.


For Bijoux of Norwich, Connecticut, the FAFSA problems threaten to undermine the promise of higher education.


To her, college is a chance to seize the opportunities that weren't available to her mother, who immigrated from Haiti to the U.S. as an adult. Bijoux hopes to become a therapist and set a positive example for her three younger brothers.




If her FAFSA goes through, she should be eligible for enough financial aid to help with the $13,000-a-year tuition at Southern Connecticut State University. If not, she might go to a local community college, but even that would require loans if she can't complete the FAFSA.


"That's why it hurts, because it's like you work so hard to go somewhere and do something and make something of yourself," Bijoux said. "I thought I would start at a four-year (college) and then work hard continuously, like I've been doing basically my whole life. But that's not the case."


The updated FAFSA form has one section filled out by students and another by their parents. But when Bijoux finishes her part, nothing shows up on her mom's online account. She keeps trying, but nothing seems to change.


Similar problems have been reported across the country, along with numerous other bugs that the Education Department has scrambled to fix. Families who call for customer service have faced long wait times or say the call center hung up on them.


It "drains all the momentum" from families working to send their children to college, especially those navigating the process for the first time, said Anne Zinn, a counselor at Norwich Free Academy, where Bijoux goes to school.


"I can only say so many times, 'Just be patient, just be patient,' before they throw their hands up and they're like, 'Why am I doing this? I'm just going to go get a job,'" she said.


The rollout has attracted bipartisan criticism in Congress, and it's being investigated at the request of Republicans. Last week, Richard Cordray, the federal student loan chief who oversaw the FAFSA update, announced he's stepping down at the end of June.


For colleges, too, the delays pose a major threat.


Enrollment decreases like those being projected now could put many small colleges out of business or necessitate deep cuts in staff. Some colleges are pushing for emergency relief just to stay afloat, said Angel Pérez, CEO of the National Association for College Admission Counseling.


"If they don't get checks from the federal government to basically get them through next year, they will not survive," Pérez said.


FAFSA has been the linchpin of student financial aid for decades. It's used to determine eligibility for the federal Pell grant, a scholarship for low-income students, and it's required to receive federal student loans. Colleges and states also use FAFSA to distribute their own scholarships.


FAFSA had long been maligned for being tedious, difficult and intimidating to families without college experience. Congress passed legislation in 2020 meant to simplify the form. The Education Department was ordered to reduce the number of questions from more than 100 to about 40 and change the formula to expand aid to more students.


Problems started piling up as soon as the new form went online in December, already months overdue.


The first applications were incorrectly processed using an outdated calculation for inflation. Later, a federal contractor miscalculated a different formula on more than 200,000 applications. Each mistake added to delays, leaving students waiting longer to hear anything about financial aid.


Even more worrisome is a misstep that blocked students from finishing the form if they have a parent without a Social Security number. Advocates say the system locked out hundreds of thousands of students who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents but whose parents are not.


The Education Department on Tuesday said it's giving those parents a new way to enter their tax information manually. But as recently as this week, some students said they were still blocked from submitting the form.


Federal education officials say they're addressing lingering bugs but making progress. More than 8 million student applications have now been processed and sent to colleges, the agency said, and new applications are being processed within three days.


Still, the wait is far from over. It usually takes weeks for schools to prepare financial aid offers. Some colleges have extended decision deadlines to give students more time to weigh their options. But some stuck to May 1, forcing students to choose a college — and make a nonrefundable payment to hold their spot — without knowing all their scholarship options.


In Baltimore, Camryn Carter is waiting to find out if he'll get a full ride to the University of Maryland or face tens of thousands of dollars in student loans.


A top student and captain of his baseball and wrestling teams, Carter sees college as a step up in life. He thinks back to the times in the grocery store line when he had to put items back on the shelf because his mom couldn't afford the bill. A college degree would give him the stability he didn't always have, the 18-year-old said.


But when he looks at tuition, it's intimidating. Along with Maryland, he's also considering McDaniel College, a private school in Maryland. If he enrolls there, he expects to borrow almost $30,000 a year.


"I try to make the best decisions now so I can have a good future," he said. "I'm a little nervous that things won't work out. But I'm faithful."

## US Federal Reserve keeps interest rates at 23-year high

date: 2024-05-01, from: VOA News USA

Washington — The U.S. Federal Reserve held interest rates steady for a sixth straight meeting on Wednesday, keeping the level at a 23-year high to fight stubborn price increases. 


At the end of a two-day meeting, central bank policymakers decided unanimously that the Fed would keep the benchmark lending rate unchanged at 5.25-5.50 percent, citing a "lack of further progress" toward its 2 percent inflation target. 


"The economic outlook is uncertain, and the Committee remains highly attentive to inflation risks," said the Fed in a statement. 


For months, the U.S. central bank has maintained interest rates at an elevated level to cool demand and rein in price increases — with a slowdown in inflation last year fueling optimism that the first cuts were on the horizon. 


But price increases have accelerated, throwing cold water on hopes of a summer rate cut. 


The Fed also announced on Wednesday that, starting in June, it would slow the pace of decline of its securities holdings, by "reducing the monthly redemption cap on Treasury securities from $60 billion to $25 billion." 


As hope dwindles for rate reductions in the first half of the year, the Fed faces a growing possibility that eventual cuts will coincide with the run-up to November's presidential election. 


The timeline may prove uncomfortable given that the Fed, as the independent U.S. central bank, seeks to avoid any appearance of politicization.

## US issues sanctions targeting Russia, takes aim at Chinese companies

date: 2024-05-01, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The United States on Wednesday issued hundreds of fresh sanctions targeting Russia over the war in Ukraine in action that took aim at Moscow's circumvention of Western measures, including through China. 


The U.S. Treasury Department imposed sanctions on nearly 200 targets, while the State Department designated more than 80. 


The U.S. imposed sanctions on 20 companies based in China and Hong Kong, following repeated warnings from Washington about China's support for Russia's military, including during recent trips by U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Secretary of State Antony Blinken to the country. 


China's support for Russia is one of the many issues threatening to sour the recent improvement in relations between the world's biggest economies. 


"Treasury has consistently warned that companies will face significant consequences for providing material support for Russia’s war, and the U.S. is imposing them today on almost 300 targets," Yellen said in a statement. 


The United States and its allies have imposed sanctions on thousands of targets since Russia invaded neighboring Ukraine. The war has seen tens of thousands killed and cities destroyed. 


Washington has since sought to crack down on evasion of the Western measures, including by issuing sanctions on firms in China, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates. 


Technology and equipment


The Treasury's action on Wednesday sanctioned nearly 60 targets located in Azerbaijan, Belgium, China, Russia, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Slovakia it accused of enabling Russia to "acquire desperately needed technology and equipment from abroad." 


The move included measures against a China-based company the Treasury said exported items to produce drones — such as propellers, engines and sensors — to a company in Russia. Other China and Hong Kong-based technology suppliers were also targeted. 


The State Department also imposed sanctions on four China-based companies it accused of supporting Russia's defense industrial base, including by shipping critical items to entities under U.S. sanctions in Russia, as well as companies in Turkey, Kyrgyzstan and Malaysia that it accused of shipping high priority items to Russia. 


The Treasury also targeted Russia's acquisition of explosive precursors needed by Russia to keep producing gunpowder, rocket propellants and other explosives, including through sanctions on two China-based suppliers sending the substances to Russia. 


The U.S. on Wednesday also accused Russia of violating a global ban on chemical weapons by repeatedly deploying the choking agent chloropicrin against Ukrainian troops and using riot control agents "as a method of warfare" in Ukraine. 


The State Department also expanded its targeting of Russia's future ability to ship liquefied natural gas, or LNG, one of the country's top exports.  


It designated two vessel operators involved in transporting technology, including gravity-based structure equipment, or concrete legs that support offshore platforms, for Russia's Arctic LNG 2 project. 


Previous U.S. sanctions on Arctic LNG 2 last month forced Novatek, Russia's largest LNG producer, to suspend production at the project, which suffered a shortage of tankers to ship the fuel.  


Also targeted were subsidiaries of Russia's state nuclear power company, Rosatom, as well as 12 entities within the Sibanthracite group of companies, one of Russia’s largest producers of metallurgical coal, the State Department said. 


Washington also imposed sanctions on Russian air carrier Pobeda, a subsidiary of Russian airline Aeroflot.  


The U.S. Commerce Department has previously added more than 200 Boeing and Airbus airplanes operated by Russian airlines to an export control list as part of the Biden administration's sanctions over the Russian invasion of Ukraine. 


Sanctions over Navanly


The State Department also targeted three people in connection with the death of late Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny, the best-known domestic critic of President Vladimir Putin. He died in February in a Russian Arctic prison.  


Russian authorities say he died of natural causes. His followers believe he was killed by the authorities, which the Kremlin denies. 


Wednesday's action targeted the director of the correctional colony in Russia where Navalny was held for most of his imprisonment, as well as the head of the solitary confinement detachment and the head of the medical unit at the colony where he was imprisoned before his death. 


The officials oversaw the cells where Navalny was kept in solitary confinement, the walking yard where he allegedly collapsed and died and Navalny's health, including in the immediate aftermath of his collapse, the State Department said.

## Negative views of China persist in US, report finds

date: 2024-05-01, from: VOA News USA

Washington — For the fifth year in a row, about eight out of 10 Americans have unfavorable views of China, with many saying limiting Beijing’s power is a top priority, according to a public opinion survey released Wednesday.


According to the Washington-based Pew Research Center, 81% of Americans have an unfavorable view of China, including 43% who hold a very unfavorable view of the country. 


“Views of China across all Americans remain critical — pretty negative,” Pew research associate Christine Huang told VOA.  


“China is becoming an increasingly powerful player on the international stage, and so it’s important for us to track how Americans and people around the world view China and its actions, and to see how public opinion will shape or not affect foreign policy of countries,” Huang added.  


Political ideology and age were found to have a distinct impact on people’s perception of China. 


“Not all Americans see China equally negatively. Some groups stand out for having especially negative views of China,” Huang said.  


Republicans are far more likely to hold negative views of China than Democrats are, according to Pew. Republicans and Republican-leaning independents are about twice as likely as Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents to hold a very unfavorable view of China and to consider China an enemy of the U.S., the report said. 


Conservative Republicans are more likely than moderate or liberal Republicans to hold negative views of China and view Beijing as an enemy. Meanwhile, older people are also more likely to be wary of China, with Americans over the age of 65 tending to hold more unfavorable views of Beijing. 


Pew doesn’t look into why most Americans have negative views of China, but the study does examine perceptions of Chinese influence, according to Huang.


“Most people in America, for example, think that China’s power and influence has gotten stronger in recent years,” Huang said. “So there is a connection between the sense that it’s becoming more powerful and being more negative towards the country.” 


Those views are particularly clear when it comes to considering China’s economic influence on the United States. More than 80% of Americans think China has at least a fair amount of influence on U.S. economic conditions, the report said.


Of the people who think Beijing has at least some influence on the U.S. economy, 79% think that influence is negative, compared to just 18% who think it’s positive, according to Pew. 


Something that stood out in this year’s study, according to Huang, is American concern over China’s territorial disputes. Beijing has laid claim to large swathes of the South China Sea, for instance, despite strong pushback from countries like Vietnam and the Philippines. 


About six out of 10 Americans, or 61%, say they are at least somewhat concerned about territorial disputes between China and its neighbors, including 20% who say they are very concerned, the report found.  


“Americans are looking beyond just the immediate impact to themselves,” Huang said.

## United Methodist Church repeals ban on gay clergy, same-sex marriage

date: 2024-05-01, from: VOA News USA

washington  — The United Methodist Church, which has some 10 million members around the world, repealed on Wednesday a ban on ordaining gay clergy and same-sex marriage.


Church leadership, at a conference held in North Carolina, approved the moves in a 692-51 vote.


The church removed its 1984 ban on the ordination of clergy who are "self-avowing practicing homosexuals."


It also decided that clergy who perform same-sex marriages will not be subject to any penalties. Neither will clergy or churches which refuse to hold same-sex weddings.


"Delegates and observers applauded after the vote," the church news agency said.


"Many hugged and more than a few cried, in a mass release of joy for those who had pushed, some for decades, to make The United Methodist Church fully inclusive," it added.


The LGBTQ moves have not been without controversy. Thousands of more conservative United Methodist congregations have left the denomination in the past few years over the issue.


About half of the church's global membership is in the United States.

Thanks to increased investment, it seems India’s live music industry is primed to take off. Also on the program: betting on skee ball and a look at fresh payroll data.</p>

## Blinken meets with Netanyahu in renewed push for Gaza cease-fire

date: 2024-05-01, from: VOA News USA

Jerusalem — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem on Wednesday as talks continue in Cairo to resolve details of an elusive bid for a cease-fire in Israel’s war with Hamas militants in Gaza.


State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Blinken “emphasized that it is Hamas that is standing in the way of a cease-fire.” The militants so far have refused to accept a plan calling for a several-week halt in nearly seven months of warfare, along with Hamas failing to free hostages it is holding in exchange for the release of Palestinians jailed by Israel.


But even as Blinken blamed Hamas for the lack of a truce, Miller said the top U.S. diplomat told Netanyahu that the U.S. remains opposed to the Israeli leader’s call for a ground attack on the southern Gaza town of Rafah, where Israel says it plans to root out four remaining battalions of Hamas fighters.


“We cannot, will not support a major military operation in Rafah, absent an effective plan to make sure that civilians are not harmed and no, we've not seen such a plan,” Blinken said at a news conference in Ashdod, Israel. “And at the same time, there are other ways, and in our judgment, better ways of dealing with the real ongoing challenge of Hamas that does not involve or require a major military operation in Rafah.” 


The U.S., the United Nations and numerous world officials have voiced opposition to an attack on Rafah because more than a million Palestinian refugees are sheltering there, many of them ordered by the Israeli military to flee there from their homes in northern Gaza during the earliest weeks of the war.




Netanyahu says the Rafah offensive is necessary to meet Israel’s goal of erasing Hamas control of Gaza, and that it will happen regardless of whether there is a cease-fire and hostage-release deal with Hamas.


Blinken said, “Hamas has to decide whether it will take the deal and actually advance the situation for the people that it purports to care about in Gaza. There is no time for delay. There's no time for further haggling. The deal is there. They should take it.”


He said that if Hamas does not agree to the cease-fire, “I think that's further proof that it doesn't care a bit about the Palestinian people.”


Cairo has been hosting talks involving U.S., Egyptian and Qatari mediators that have produced the latest cease-fire proposal.


Blinken also placed a continued emphasis on getting more humanitarian aid into Gaza to feed famished Palestinians.


“At the same time, even as we’re working with relentless determination to get the cease-fire that brings the hostages home, we also have to be focused on people in Gaza who are suffering in this crossfire of Hamas’ making,” Blinken said. He said that on Wednesday, for the first time, trucks with humanitarian aid traveled through Erez, a new Israeli entry point into northern Gaza.


The top U.S. diplomat has repeatedly called on Hamas to accept the cease-fire proposal during a trip to the region that included earlier stops in Saudi Arabia and Jordan.


Blinken also met with Israeli President Isaac Herzog, who said the return of hostages held by Hamas “is and should be the top priority of the international community.”  




 


Following the meeting with Herzog, Blinken spoke with demonstrators outside who held signs and chanted slogans calling for the hostages in Gaza to be brought home.


Blinken told the demonstrators he had met with families of the hostages and told them, “Bringing your loved ones home is at the heart of everything we’re trying to do.”


Hamas is believed to still be holding about 100 hostages, along with the remains of about 30 others, after taking about 250 people hostage in the October 7 attack on Israel in which the militants killed 1,200 people.


Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 34,500 people, about two-thirds of them women and children, according to the health ministry in Gaza. Israel says the death toll includes several thousand Hamas militants it has killed.


Blinken met Tuesday with Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi and King Abdullah II, before meeting with Sigrid Kaag, U.N. senior humanitarian and reconstruction coordinator for Gaza.


Blinken thanked Abdullah for Jordan’s leadership in facilitating the delivery of humanitarian aid, including joint U.S.-Jordan airdrops that to date have delivered more than 1,000 tons of humanitarian assistance to Palestinians in Gaza.




The two leaders discussed joint efforts to expedite the flow of additional urgently needed aid to Gaza from Jordan through land routes. Blinken also commended the king’s commitment to economic modernization and vital public sector reforms.


Later Tuesday, Blinken met with Palestinians from Gaza at the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs before meeting with Kaag. Blinken told Kaag he was anxious to hear directly from her, adding, “The entire team is doing extraordinary work to ensure that people in Gaza get the help and support and the assistance they need.”

Burning SAFs for fuel still produces carbon dioxide, but their lifecycle emissions are lower than those of fossil fuels, and they can be used in existing planes, so they are seen as a quick way to cut aviation emissions <a href="https://d2qwfv04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/X+113/d2QWfV04/VVD-VW3XN4dSW96LXS06J8w1fW3X6sTS5dyVfcN3fD2CT5nXHsW6N1X8z6lZ3mJW5yyLfN2WjhFLW3nby8P2X6MzJW5m2G-C5hJ--CW5qKv7y7yt80cW5YR4C93wgkh2W7qLm8V81rlsnW5xm7xD8fnXjRN5gmPRRqnTh6W8qNX-62fmlQ1W6THt2K6tF6TYW5KYWBQ4lzVDwW4lJ_NB58vsQLW36PSmp9dYLYlW4xbSsB2k0dSYW1cRHqd30sGn5W9fn9jH98VFgXW29kQJ11bf34mV8Kskc7G7Jv3W1gXlr42lCyjCVp9CvD4NYtxgW2SM0F62MJPD1W4cNNKh4T9rFxN6-fX2s_HrVqN851WQpDlj09W3WQjys3v_TPXW1vGXx03DSBzqW3G5Yrb89PB04W5hvC_j3gt1D4W4vndvN7BVQDBW3kYMpp2dJKp1W33kwq-4MnvNZW6kBG1L1k9zJxW1V-vVt1s5yBKW7cVV303_7RF2W5GP0z-2cw8SrW98dPXX7rBpqlW1g8nyV4X8Yb8W4ftYhn3LXPCff1tLxGq04" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in the short term</a>. </p><p>Under the new guidance, refiners will be eligible for a credit of $1.25 per gallon if their fuel reduces greenhouse gas emissions by 50% compared to traditional jet fuel, and up to $1.75 per gallon if emissions cuts go beyond 50%. The announcement clarified that SAF made out of ethanol is eligible if corn farmers use “climate smart agriculture” such as cover cropping, no-till, and efficient fertilizer application to keep carbon in the soil. Reaction to the announcement has been mixed. Ethanol trade groups were pleased to be included but annoyed at the stringent farming requirements. Environmental groups worry crop-based biofuels will take up too much farmland and could lead to deforestation. “Powering planes with crop-based biofuels is anything but sustainable,” <a href="https://d2qwfv04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/X+113/d2QWfV04/VVD-VW3XN4dSW96LXS06J8w1fW3X6sTS5dyVfcN3fD2F25nXHsW95jVnq6lZ3ktW90cSF_2KMJpCVhjzDz9j26dWW2h1DY13zkqjRW4NJqSM2Wnd1bW8Yjgb68K97-QW3Nj7pd6g7thsW1t0jvy7r-FH3W99wn457xcTJ1W3lVkFV8pznXzW8JzJMv8yQKKbW6J_jWr2GbDCXW5wMnf171-9NSW2HNvlB3krd9mW2t8jhF6YtBkmW41CyZb1QycpfW4r1mKH8Z3qPlW9frPD37wqy40N8Dv6M-ZlJGtW369F_f54k1PVW8yxhzF4jCjNsW3P_bry5FbJF2N6BKw98YdRRhW7bsT968K2BnjW5YfPSP2PfrypMhPf5v693gRW6hcK861jN0MHW2cR3DY7ZdRjbW5jJJ_x16QHbgW996kbB54k1k1W3nhq4J4R1LThW4_tssb61kcrqW9hK4PY5Y3lcxW79rPQR6MLpt5V1XL0r3HcHSCW3NG7jP7P_CWYW3xPGsD4pK2wDVnNfmt1_Qb7qW4GL5Y27_Vd1MW6h9_8P53b023VVnl3h6h9b1jW1W7nx34sQkFjW5K9L4b1tc8f8W4DtxzN3NRbrtW8LctVJ6sjPHFW2jCShR1B9M9JN8G3Z9m3gGjhf8bL6LK04" target="_blank">said</a> Dan Lashof, director of the World Resources Institute.

Water heaters are some of the biggest energy hogs in the average American home. Making them more efficient could reduce consumers’ utility bills by approximately $100 per year, the DOE said. And the energy savings of the new standards are quite astonishing: 17.6 quadrillion British thermal units over 30 years of shipments, “the largest savings ever from a single DOE efficiency standard, representing more than the energy use of the entire U.S. residential building sector in a single year.” As for the climate, the DOE said the efficiency standards will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2.5 billion metric tons over 30 years, which is roughly equivalent to taking 18 million gas-powered cars off the road.</p><h3>3.

## How Americans Stopped Caring About Coal

date: 2024-05-01, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjE0NjU0MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcyODQ4OTE2NX0.2YZISYMzpYeVNLny89_agHIqf2jJ8qJZ5j9ouCiZLzE/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">The future of coal played a starring role in the 2016 presidential election. As an industry, an energy supply, and a source of jobs and identity in many communities, coal was both a practical and symbolic issue, one that helped solidify Donald Trump’s support among white working class voters not just in coal country itself but around the nation. It stood in for a deep divide between the parties, one that cast Trump as the champion of what he <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2016/11/09/politics/donald-trump-victory-speech/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>called</u></a> “the forgotten men and women of our country,” while Hillary Clinton and her party were supposedly cruel elitists ready to condemn those Americans to a future of deprivation in pursuit of a radical and ruinous environmental agenda. </p><p>Eight years later, the future of coal — or more specifically, the shape and speed of its demise — is being decided through administration policy and the workings of the market. But on the campaign trail, no one is talking about it. Coal has almost disappeared as a political issue.</p><p>To understand why, we have to begin in that 2016 campaign. In May of that year, Hillary Clinton came to Williamson, West Virginia to make amends. Less than two months before, she <a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2016/may/10/context-hillary-clintons-comments-about-coal-jobs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>had said</u></a> in a CNN town hall that “we're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business,” generating enormous backlash despite the fact that she was touting her plan to “bring economic opportunity using clean renewable energy as the key into coal country.” Now, at a forum held just a couple of blocks from the famous Williamson <a href="https://www.wowktv.com/news/west-virginia/mingo-county-wv/the-coal-house-one-of-west-virginias-most-unique-buildings/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Coal House</u></a> (a building made entirely from coal), a former coal company employee <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2016/05/02/politics/hillary-clinton-west-virginia-coal-comments/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>asked her</u></a>, “How you can say you are going to put a lot of coal miners out of jobs and then come in here and tell us how you are going to be our friends?” </p><p>Clinton insisted her remarks had been taken out of context. “I’m here because I want you to know whether people vote for me or not whether they yell at me or not, it’s not going to affect what I can do to help because I feel like that’s a moral obligation,” she said.</p><p>Trump was far less nuanced in his approach to what he called “beautiful clean coal.” His message was simple: Elect me, and all the lost coal jobs will return. “For those miners, get ready, because you’re going to be working your asses off,” <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/trump-receives-warm-welcome-in-coal-country/2016/05/06/9259c5ea-1327-11e6-a9b5-bf703a5a7191_video.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>he said</u></a> at a rally in West Virginia. “I love the miners, and we're going to put the miners back to work,” <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coal-miners-western-pennsylvania-trump-first-100-days/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>he said</u></a> at another. </p><p>It worked: Trump’s biggest margins of victory came in the two states with the highest coal production, Wyoming and West Virginia.</p><p>And he certainly tried to save the coal industry. He withdrew from the Paris climate accords, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2017/2/2/14488448/stream-protection-rule" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>rolled back</u></a> environmental regulations on coal, <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/apxpruitt-is-out-handing-epa-reins-to-former-coal-lobbyist/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>installed</u></a> coal industry executives and lobbyists in key administration positions, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/06/us/politics/under-trump-coal-mining-gets-new-life-on-us-lands.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>encouraged</u></a> coal mining on federal lands, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/6/19/18684054/climate-change-clean-power-plan-repeal-affordable-emissions" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>undid</u></a> the Obama-era Clean Power Plan, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/01/climate/trump-coal-nuclear-power.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>tried</u></a> to bail out failing coal plants.</p><p>But none of that brought back the coal jobs. Total <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CES1021210001" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>coal mining employment</u></a> in the U.S. stayed at the same level for the first four years of his presidency — around 53,000 — then fell by 20%in his final year, during the Covid pandemic. Today that figure is around 43,000, a miniscule number given the size of our economy; more Americans work at <a href="https://s29.q4cdn.com/187116270/files/doc_financials/2023/ar/2023-Annual-Report-FINAL-4-18-24-includes-High-Resolution.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the Cheesecake Factory</u></a> than in the entire coal mining industry. That may be the first reason Trump isn’t talking about coal on the campaign trail: He didn’t keep his most high-profile promise.</p><p>Yet in coal country, Trump was not punished for his failure to bring back the coal jobs. Williamson, where Hillary Clinton made her 2016 mea culpa, provides a perfect example. With a population of 3,000, it’s the largest city in Mingo County, whose population has shrunk in every Census since the one in 1990. It’s a place with deep economic and health-care challenges, where coal is woven throughout the local identity and sense of place (the high school’s sports teams are called the Miners and Lady Miners). </p><p>According to the most recent <a href="https://minesafety.wv.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CY-2022-Annual-Report.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>report</u></a> from the state of West Virginia, in 2022 there were only 409 people working in coal in Mingo County, or about 3% of the working-age population. In 2016, Trump got 83%of the vote there. In 2020, despite not bringing back the jobs, he got 85%. Voters there didn’t seem to care that Trump didn’t revive the industry. Or maybe it was never really about anything so concrete and practical. </p><p>Which brings us to the second reason coal may be fading as a campaign issue: What it represents to the country as a whole has changed. </p><p>More and more, coal seems like yesterday’s news; total <a href="https://www.eia.gov/coal/annual/pdf/tableES1.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>production</u></a> has declined by nearly 50%since 2008. While environmental regulations have had an impact, the biggest reason is competition, first from natural gas and then from renewables, which are now <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/renewables-cheaper-energy-than-99-percent-of-us-coal-plants-just-energy-transition/642393/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>cheaper</u></a> than coal for electricity generation. While every last voter may not be aware of that fact, years of headlines to that effect — and the steadily increasing number of jobs in the renewables industry — may be penetrating into public consciousness. </p><p>Consider Trump’s promise to be “a dictator on day one” so he can do two things: round up immigrants, and “drill, drill, drill.” The latter idea is absurdly unnecessary even for the most fervent fossil fuel advocate, given that the U.S. <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61545" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>produced</u></a> more oil in 2023 than any country in history ever did. Nevertheless, Trump clearly believes it represents something compelling to voters, or at least <em><em>his</em></em> voters. But he’s not promising to be a dictator so he can “mine, mine, mine.” </p><p>For his part, President Biden touts his administration’s efforts to invest in struggling areas that used to rely on coal, but often in remarks and <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/04/25/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-key-actions-to-strengthen-americas-electric-grid-boost-clean-energy-deployment-and-manufacturing-jobs-and-cut-dangerous-pollution-from-the/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>fact sheets</u></a> that few voters see. His administration is <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/04/16/1245011608/silica-dust-mine-safety-coal-black-lung-final-rule" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>addressing</u></a> new concerns over black lung disease (which Trump’s <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/06/20/734538252/regulators-resist-call-for-action-in-response-to-black-lung-epidemic" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>refused</u></a> to do). Biden spends a great deal of time talking about the government’s green investments, but doesn’t seem to be defensive about the effects the energy transition is having on coal, as so many Democrats have been in the past. Neither he nor others in his party are all that worried about repeating Hillary Clinton’s experience. </p><p>That’s despite the fact that the administration’s policies are going a long way toward bringing about the end of coal, or at least its transition to a minor supporting player in the nation’s energy mix. In the latest move toward his goal of a zero-carbon energy system, the EPA <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/new-epa-rules-force-coal-fired-power-plants-capture-emissions-shut-rcna149312" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>announced</u></a> a new set of regulations affecting coal plants, including the most significant: Plants that plan to stay open past 2039 will have to cut or capture 90 percent of their emissions by 2032. The almost inevitable result will be an acceleration in the closing of coal plants. </p><p>When that plan was announced, there were predictable objections from industry and coal-friendly officials — outgoing Sen. Joe Manchin <a href="https://www.manchin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/manchin-the-administrations-goal-is-simple_death-by-1000-cuts-for-americas-reliable-fossil-fuel-industry" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>called the new EPA rule</u></a> “death by a thousand cuts to America’s fossil fuel industry, especially coal” — but on the whole, the reaction was remarkably restrained. Trump did not send a dozen all-caps Truth Social posts denouncing the regulations. Republicans didn’t hold press conferences and suspend all other congressional business to make angry speeches about them. It almost had an air of resignation.</p><p>Yes, there will be lawsuits, and there’s a fair chance the conservative supermajority on the Supreme Court will strike down the regulations. But as a political issue, it didn’t generate much heat.</p><p>That tells us that something important has changed. Coal is no longer a totem of identity and a cause for Republicans to get their own supporters to the polls and win over converts in the middle. National Democrats are overcoming the fear that a pro-coal backlash will turn their climate policies and advocacy into campaign headaches. Just as coal’s importance to the nation’s energy supply is inexorably diminishing, its political power is fading as well. Which makes further climate progress all the more likely. </p>

## Chinese Tencent-owned Riot Games installs rootkit on every League of Legends players’ computer

date: 2024-05-01, from: OS News

With 14.9, Vanguard, Riot’s proprietary Anti-Cheat system will be deployed and active in League of Legends. This means that active enforcement of Vanguard will be in effect and working hard to make sure your queues are free from scripters, botters, and cheaters! We recently released a blog detailing the “why” behind bringing Vanguard to League that you can check out here. It’s a bit of a long read, but it does have some pictures. ↫ Lilu Cabreros in the League of Legends patch notes The basic gist is that Vanguard is a closed-source, kernel-level rootkit for Windows that runs at all times, with the supposed goal of detecting and banning cheaters from playing League of Legends. This being a rootkit designed specifically to inject itself into the Windows kernel, it won&#8217;t work on Linux, and as such, the entire League on Linux community, which has been playing League for years now and even at times communicated with Riot employees to keep the game running, is now gone. Interestingly enough, Riot is not implementing Vanguard on macOS, which League of Legends also supports &#8211; because Apple simply doesn&#8217;t allow it. This is probably the most invasive, disturbing form of anticheat we&#8217;ve seen so far, especially since it involves such a hugely popular game. It&#8217;s doubly spicy because Riot Games is owned by Tencent, a Chinese company, which means a company owned and controlled by the Chinese government now has rootkits installed on the roughly 150 million players&#8217; computers all over the world. While we&#8217;re all (rightly, in my opinion) worried about TikTok, China just slipped 150 million rootkits onto computers all over the world. One really has to wonder where these increasingly invasive, anti-privacy and anti-user anticheat measures are going from here. Now that this rootkit can keep tabs on literally every single thing you do on your Windows computer, what&#8217;s going to be the next step? Anticheat might have to move towards using webcams to watch you play to prevent you from cheating, because guess what? The next level of cheating is already here, and it doesn&#8217;t even involve your computer. Earlier this year, hardware maker MSI showed off a gaming monitor that uses &#8220;AI&#8221; to see what&#8217;s going on on your monitor, and then injects overlays onto your monitor to help you cheat. MSI showed off how the monitor will use the League of Legends minimap to follow enemy champions and other relevant content, and then show warnings on your screen when enemies approach from off-screen. All of this happens entirely on the monitor&#8217;s hardware, and never sends any data whatsoever to the computer it&#8217;s attached to. It&#8217;s cheating that literally cannot be detected by anything running on your computer, rootkit or not. So, the only logical next step as such forms of cheating become more advanced and widespread is to force users to turn on their webcams, and point them at their displays. I fired up League of Legends today on my gaming computer &#8211; which runs Linux, of course &#8211; and after the League client &#8220;installed&#8221; the rootkit, it just got stuck in an endless loop of asking me to restart the client. I&#8217;ve been playing League of Legends for close to 14 years, and while I know the game &#8211; and especially its community &#8211; has a deservedly so bad reputation, I&#8217;ve always enjoyed the game with friends, and especially with my wife, who&#8217;s been playing for years and years as well. Speaking of my wife &#8211; even though she runs Windows and could easily install the rootkit if she wanted to, she has some serious doubts about this. When I explained what the Vanguard rootkit can do, her mouse pointer slowly moved away from the &#8220;Update&#8221; button, saying, &#8220;I&#8217;m not so sure about this&#8230;&#8221;

## Linux Mint: non-GNOME GTK desktop environments need to work together in the face of libadwaita

date: 2024-05-01, from: OS News

Anyone who has spent any time recently using non-GNOME GTK desktop environments, like Cinnamon, MATE, or Xfce, has had to deal with the unfortunate reality of a lot of GTK applications becoming GNOME applications instead, using GNOME&#8217;s own libadwaita. These applications are hard to theme, and do not integrate at all with the proper GTK applications non-GNOME desktop environments ship with. With how popular GNOME is, this has meant that the number of non-GNOME GTK applications has been dwindling. Linux Mint, the popular Linux distribution that also develops the Cinnamon desktop environment, has long made a bundle of GTK applications called XApps &#8211; basically forks of various core GNOME 3.x applications to ensure they would have access to non-GNOME GTK applications. With GNOME effectively forking GTK into its own, unique, GNOME-specific style (like libaidwaita), other GTK environments have suffered, and XApps were intended to close that gap. That hasn&#8217;t really happened though, as XApps remained mostly a Mint-only thing, managed by Mint, as part of the Mint/Cinnamon GitHub projects. Other distributions and GTK desktop environments, such as Xfce, MATE, Budgie, and so on, didn&#8217;t really pick them up. The Linux Mint project intends to change that, and will &#8216;spin off&#8217; the XApps into its own, dedicated, independent project to facilitate cross-distribution and cross-DE collaboration, decision-making and development, all in an effort to ensure the long-term viability of non-GNOME GTK desktop environments. They also intend to fork a lot more of the GNOME 3 applications, for the same reason I mentioned earlier: GNOME applications are no longer GTK applications, but GNOME applications &#8211; they look and feel horribly out of place in environments that don&#8217;t use the GNOME-specific libadwaita. As such, Celluloid, GNOME Calculator, Simple Scan, Baobab, System Monitor, GNOME Calendar, File Roller, and Zenity were recently downgraded in Linux Mint to their last GTK 3 versions, and will most likely be forked in the near future. In addition, the Adwaita theme, the default GNOME/GTK theme, will be removed from the list of available themes in Cinnamon 6.2. Adwaita, too, has become increasingly GNOME-only, and thus, increasingly broken on non-GNOME desktop environments. Flat-our removing Adwaita altogether is not possible, since it&#8217;s a GTK dependency, but hiding it from the theme selector is not an issue, of course. As project lead Clément Lefèbvre writes: libAdwaita is for GNOME and GNOME only. We can’t blame GNOME for this, they’ve been very clear about it from the start. It was made specifically for GNOME to have more freedom and build its own ecosystem without impacting GTK. We want to send a strong signal upstream and towards other projects. We cannot and will not support applications which do not support our users and environments. We can’t promote applications to our users which don’t support our users. The software manager will be vigilant towards that going forward and list compatible software by default. ↫ Clément Lefèbvre All of this is great news to hear. I&#8217;ve been making extensive use of Xfce on OpenBSD lately, and on the Fedora Xfce spin in the weeks before that, and the situation has become almost comical. If you install any GNOME application on Xfce, theming just breaks down completely, as most themes are either not made to support the massive headerbars GNOME uses, or they do support it but still look horribly out of place compared to the more sane titlebar plus menubar plus toolbar layout of traditional desktop environments like Xfce. I&#8217;ve long been saying that the non-GNOME GTK desktop environments need to work together to formulate an answer to the onslaught of libadwaita and the GNOME-ification of GTK, because each of them risks becoming entirely tied to whatever GNOME and libadwaita decides to do, for better or worse. It seems the Linux Mint team has finally realised this as well, and I really hope &#8211; and strongly suggest &#8211; Xfce, MATE, and others join them as well. If they don&#8217;t, there won&#8217;t be an Xfce in a few years. What&#8217;s the point in developing Xfce if you&#8217;re at the mercy of whatever choices GNOME makes?

## Redox gets USB HID support

date: 2024-05-01, from: OS News

Another month, another detailed report about the progress made in Redox, the Rust-based operating system. A major improvements this month is support for USB HID, allowing USB keyboards and mice to work on Redox, but the project does note USB hubs are still problematic and might not work properly. Thanks to these USB improvements, Redox&#8217; desktop environment Orbital now also ran on ARM64 in Qemu for the first time, which is a great step towards running it on real ARM64 hardware. A massive documentation pass has also taken place, fixing various errors and improving and simplifying the writing. More programs have been ported, of course, and various lower-level improvements and fixes, along with a number of other fixes and changes across the operating system.

## Massive Powerball win draws attention to a little-known immigrant culture in US

date: 2024-05-01, from: VOA News USA

PORTLAND, Ore. — Cheng "Charlie" Saephan wore a broad smile and a bright blue sash emblazoned with the words "Iu-Mien USA" as he hoisted an oversized check for $1.3 billion above his head.


The 46-year-old immigrant's luck in winning an enormous Powerball jackpot in Oregon earlier this month — a lump sum payment of $422 million after taxes, which he and his wife will split with a friend — has changed his life. It also raised awareness about Iu Mien people, a southeast Asian ethnic group with origins in China, many of whose members fled from Laos to Thailand and then settled in the U.S. following the Vietnam War.


"I am born in Laos, but I am not Laotian," Saephan told a news conference Monday at Oregon Lottery headquarters, where his identity as one of the jackpot's winners was revealed. "I am Iu Mien."


During the Vietnam War, the CIA and U.S. military recruited Iu Mien in neighboring Laos, many of them subsistence farmers, to engage in guerrilla warfare and to provide intelligence and surveillance to disrupt the Ho Chi Minh Trail that the North Vietnamese used to send troops and weapons through Laos and Cambodia into South Vietnam.




After the conflict as well as the Laotian civil war, when the U.S.-backed government of Laos fell in 1975, they fled by the thousands to avoid reprisals from the new Communist government, escaping by foot through the jungle and then across the Mekong River into Thailand, according to a history posted on the website of Iu Mien Community Services in Sacramento, California. More than 70% of the Iu Mien population in Laos left and many wound up in refugee camps in Thailand.


Thousands of the refugees were allowed to come to the U.S., with the first waves arriving in the late 1970s and most settling along the West Coast. The culture had rich traditions of storytelling, basketry, embroidery and jewelry-making, but many initially had difficulty adjusting to Western life due to cultural and language differences as well as a lack of formal education.


There are now tens of thousands of Iu Mien — pronounced "yoo MEE'-en" — in the U.S., with many attending universities or starting businesses. Many have converted to Christianity from traditional animist religions. There is a sizeable Iu Mien community in Portland and its suburbs, with a Buddhist temple and Baptist church, active social organization, and businesses and restaurants.




Cayle Tern, president of the Iu Mien Association of Oregon, arrived in Portland with his family in 1980, when he was 3 years old. He is now running for City Council. His father and uncle assisted American forces in Laos and he was born as his mother fled to a refugee camp in Thailand.


Many Iu Mien in the U.S. have similar stories, and Saephan's Powerball win sheds light on the new lives they have made in Oregon and elsewhere after such trauma, he said. Tern knows all three of the Powerball winners, he said.


"You know, I think for me it's more than just about the money. ... We've been here since the late '70s, but very little is known of us," he said while sitting in his uncle's restaurant in Troutdale, a Portland suburb.


"This attention that we're getting — people are interested in what the community is, who we are, where we came from. That is to me is equally special."


Saephan, 46, said he was born in Laos and moved to Thailand in 1987, before immigrating to the U.S. in 1994. He graduated from high school in 1996 and has lived in Portland for 30 years. He worked as a machinist for an aerospace company.


He said Monday that he has had cancer for eight years and had his latest chemotherapy treatment last week.


"I will be able to provide for my family and my health," he said, adding that he'd "find a good doctor for myself."


The winning Powerball ticket was sold in early April at a Plaid Pantry convenience store in Portland, ending a winless streak that had stretched more than three months. The Oregon Lottery said it had to go through a security and vetting process before announcing the identity of the person who came forward to claim the prize.


Under Oregon law, with few exceptions, lottery players cannot remain anonymous. Winners have a year to claim the top prize.


The jackpot had a cash value of $621 million before taxes if the winner chose to take a lump sum rather than an annuity paid over 30 years, with an immediate payout followed by 29 annual installments. The prize is subject to federal taxes and state taxes in Oregon.


The $1.3 billion prize is the fourth-largest Powerball jackpot in history, and the eighth-largest among U.S. jackpot games, according to the Oregon Lottery.


The biggest U.S. lottery jackpot won was $2.04 billion in California in 2022.

## US and EU eye North Korea-Iran military cooperation

date: 2024-05-01, from: VOA News USA

Washington — The United States and the European Union say they are keeping their eyes on Pyongyang and Tehran for any possible military cooperation between the two as Iran confirms a North Korean delegation's visit to the country.


The U.S. "will use all available tools, including interdiction and sanctions, to address such activities," a State Department spokesperson said in an email to VOA's Korean Service on Friday.


An EU spokesperson on the same day told VOA Korean that it is also "following closely Iran-DPRK relations and their potential cooperation that could indeed be concerning on certain issues if it violates existing U.N. sanctions."


North Korea's official name is the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.


Pyongyang announced through its state-run KCNA that it sent a delegation led by its External Economic Relations Minister Yun Jong Ho to Iran on April 23.


Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani said on Monday that a North Korean delegation visited Tehran last week to discuss bilateral trade, according to Reuters.


But Kanaani dismissed any suspected cooperation on their missile programs, saying it is a "biased speculation" based on "untrue" reports.


The U.S. has accused Pyongyang, Tehran and Beijing of supporting Russia's war against Ukraine.


Tehran has also been involved in conflict with Israel.




Iran attacked Israel on April 13 with more than 300 missiles and drones and said the assault was in retaliation against an Israeli strike on an Iranian consular building in Damascus, Syria. Israel responded by launching a counterstrike into Iran on April 18.


"It certainly is possible and even probable" that Pyongyang and Tehran are cooperating militarily in the current Middle East conflict, just as they have done since the 1980s, said Robert Peters, a research fellow for nuclear deterrence and missile defense at the Heritage Foundation's Allison Center for National Security.


Iran is motivated to acquire missiles from North Korea "given Iran's current approach of laying a siege [around] Israel using missiles supplied to its proxies – Hezbollah, Hamas, and Houthis," Peters said.


Hezbollah, Hamas and the Houthis are Iran-backed militant groups that base their operations in Lebanon, the Gaza Strip and Yemen, respectively.


Pyongyang's arms sales to Tehran began in the 1980s during Iran's war with Iraq. Their cooperation on missile programs continued since then and expanded.


In January 2016, the U.S. Treasury sanctioned Iranians for traveling to Pyongyang and collaborating on the development of North Korea's 80-ton rocket booster. A few months later, North Korea said it had tested a new rocket engine that had a thrust of 80 tons and would be used in a new space launch vehicle.


North Korea has been accusing Israel of committing "terrorism" against Iran since the Oct. 7 attack on Israel by the Palestinian militant group Hamas.


In December, the Israel Defense Forces said North Korean weapons have been turning up in Gaza.




Bruce Bechtol, a former intelligence officer at the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency and now a professor at Angelo University in Texas, said arms transfers between Pyongyang and Tehran are "inevitable" regardless of any meeting between the two last week.


"Some of the weapons that North Korea has sent to Russia have gone to Iran first and then up to the Caspian Sea, and Russia has used those weapons in the Ukraine," said Bechtol, the author of the book “North Korean Military Proliferation in the Middle East and Africa.”


He told VOA that Iran's Emad medium-range ballistic missiles used in the attack against Israel earlier in the month were made based on the Shahab-3, which Iran first put into use in 2003. That, in turn, was developed from North Korean NoDong missiles that were sent to Tehran in the 1990s.


Bechtol said Iran's Shahab-3 missiles were developed in a facility that North Korea built for Tehran in the early 2000s. He said Tehran is likely seeking to acquire Pyongyang's Hwasong-15 intercontinental ballistic missiles.


Joeun Lee contributed to this report.

## AI and Copyright (for libraries)

date: 2024-05-01, from: Ed Summers blog, Inkdroid

<p>
A colleague in Slack (thanks <a
href="https://snowdenbecker.com/">Snowden</a>) shared that the Coalition
for Networked Information recently had <a
href="https://www.cni.org/topics/intellectual-property/handling-academic-copyright-and-artificial-intelligence-research-questions-as-the-law-develops">a
good session</a> on Copyright and AI for librarians. It was run by
Jonathan Band, who is an attorney for the Library Copyright Alliance,
and Timothy Vollmer who does scholarly communications at Berkeley. The
presentation is an hour long and worth watching, or listening to as you
do something else, like walking your dog…as you do.
</p>
<p>
Below are the brief notes I jotted down afterwards.
</p>
<iframe width="700" height="415" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GMttBH1oAD4?si=RfhVpGBaJID2tzLU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
<p>
Band helpfully pointed out that discussions about AI and copyright often
center on the question of whether fair use applies, and that these
discussions often tangle up three separate issues that are useful to
think about on their own.
</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>
Can ingestion for training AI constitute infringement?
</li>
<li>
Can AI output infringe?
</li>
<li>
Is AI output copyrightable?
</li>
</ol>
<p>
For ingestion (1) it seems like the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directive_on_Copyright_in_the_Digital_Single_Market">EU
Copyright law</a> and the new <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_Intelligence_Act">AI
Act</a> will (like the GDPR) have a lot of sway elsewhere around the
world since businesses will want to operate their AI services in Europe.
</p>
<p>
AI companies will be required to disclose what content they used to
build their models, and also to provide a way for publishers to opt out
(e.g. robots.txt or <a
href="https://www.mnot.net/blog/2024/04/21/ai-control">newly developing
standards</a>) from having their content used to train generative AI
models. There are also provisions in EU Copyright that protect
non-commercial ingestion of copyrighted material.
</p>
<p>
However even if these legal instruments help shape how generative AI
services get deployed, a law on the books in the EU can’t be used in a
court case outside of the EU?
</p>
<p>
For 2 it seems like things are largely up in the air, and that the
[NYTimes v Microsoft] case is something to watch, since they are arguing
that OpenAI’s ChatGPT can generate <a
href="https://nytco-assets.nytimes.com/2023/12/Lawsuit-Document-dkt-1-68-Ex-J.pdf">near
verbatim</a> text from their copyrighted materials. Unlike other quasi
AI tools (e.g. Google Search) ChatGPT doesn’t link to cited material
(because it doesn’t know how to), which negatively impacts web
publishers like the NYTimes since it deprives them of clicks (and
revenue).
</p>
<p>
There are multiple other court cases testing the waters around 2, and
apparently the same law firm seems to be representing many of them?
</p>
<p>
As for 3, the US Copyright Office has a report coming out later this
year, but it’s likely that it will present the factors to consider,
without providing explicit guidance. So questions about whether AI
generated content <em>can</em> be copyrighted, and by <em>who</em> (the
creators of the tool, the creator of the prompt, etc) will likely be
decided in court cases. Band didn’t mention if there are any of these
pending.
</p>
<p>
There was also some interesting points shared by Timothy Vollmer nearer
the end about vendors who are making libraries sign contracts that
prevent library patrons from ingesting content for research purposes,
which is something that the EU Copyright explicitly allows. He had some
good suggestions for how to push back on these by demanding alternate
language in these contracts that doesn’t infringe on fair use.
</p>
<p>
<img src="/images/ai-copyright.png" class="img-fluid">
</p>
<p>
I think some coordination amongst libraries for pushing for consistent
legal language here would be helpful in making sure library patrons
aren’t negatively impacted, and libraries aren’t held liable for breach
of contract in cases where fair use should apply. I’m not sure where
that work is happening, but presumably Vollmer would be a good person to
reach out to, to find out.
</p>
<p>
All this prompted me to add a <a
href="https://inkdroid.org/robots.txt">robots.txt</a> file to this
website, based on directives I saw in <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/robots.txt">the NYTimes robots.txt</a>.
Band said that legal questions about ingestion may hinge on whether a
publisher has indicated that they did not want their content used in
generative AI tools. I don’t realistically expect to be suing any of
these companies, but I decided to do it in solidarity because I’m pretty
<a href="https://inkdroid.org/2024/03/12/ai/">skeptical</a> of this
generative AI technology.
</p>
<p>
I’m really interested to hear if we get more declarative ways of
controlling whether content is used for generative AI instead of bluntly
blocking particular bots by User-Agent. Some companies may want to crawl
a page once and repurpose content for different things (search index,
llm, etc) without requiring multiple fetches from the multiple bots. I
wonder what will happen <a
href="https://www.mnot.net/blog/2024/04/21/ai-control">over at the
IETF</a> in this area? The use of robots.txt has proven problematic for
use cases around web archiving (crawl and replay) in the past, so a
fresh approach would be helpful I think.
</p>

## Large numbers of NYPD begin entering Columbia University campus

date: 2024-05-01, from: San Jose Mercury News

The Columbia University Chapter of the American Association of University Professors said faculty's efforts to help defuse the situation have been repeatedly ignored by the university's administration despite school statutes that require consultation. The group warned of potential conflict between police officers nearby and protesters on campus.

## China's state media support protests on US campuses but not at home

date: 2024-05-01, from: VOA News USA

washington — State media in China, where social protest is strongly discouraged or punished, have been vocally supporting the pro-Palestinian protests on U.S. campuses while decrying what they describe as a heavy-handed crackdown on free speech by authorities.


"Can blindly using violence to suppress students be able to quell domestic dissatisfaction with the government?" wrote Jun Zhengping Studio, a social media account operated by the News Broadcasting Center of the People's Liberation Army, in an April 26 commentary.


"If American politicians really have a sense of democracy and human rights, they should stop supporting Israel, stop endorsing Israel's actions, and do more things that are conducive to world peace. Otherwise, the only one who will suffer backlash is the United States itself."


The People's Daily, China's state-owned newspaper, said in a video that American students are protesting because they "can no longer stand the double standards of the United States."


On social media platform X, formerly Twitter, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying echoed that comment and implied the U.S. government was cracking down on protests at home while supporting protests abroad.


She posted a clip of U.S. police arresting protesters with the question, "Remember how U.S. officials reacted when these protests happened elsewhere?"




The protests this month at scores of universities, including New York's Columbia University and George Washington University in the U.S. capital, have opposed Israel's war against Hamas militants in Gaza over the large number of civilian casualties. The student protesters are demanding that their schools divest from companies with ties to Israel and are calling for a cease-fire in Gaza.


U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the protests are a symbol of American democracy, but he criticized the protesters for remaining silent on the attack by Hamas militants in October that killed more 1,200 Israelis and sparked the conflict.




Critics say antisemitic rhetoric emerged at some of the protests, and there have been clashes with police.


As of Monday, more than 900 students had been arrested, mainly for trespassing because of protest camps they erected on university property.


In an email to all faculty members and students, American University stated that the school's policy of supporting free speech has not changed, but it explicitly prohibits "disruptive" behavior such as setting up camps.


"Any demonstration that continues to interfere with university operations or violate policies after engagement and de-escalation will not be permitted, and those responsible will face conduct actions, disciplinary sanctions, or arrest as appropriate," the email said.


Reactions differ


The handling of the protests has been in stark contrast with the Chinese authorities' crackdown on domestic dissent and any form of street protest.


China's strict zero-COVID measures and censorship of critical voices during the pandemic spurred street protests in many Chinese cities in November 2022 that became known as the White Paper movement. Protesters would hold up blank sheets of white paper to symbolize support for the protests while not actually saying or doing anything, in hopes of not getting into trouble.


Nonetheless, Chinese police arrested and surveilled those caught holding up white paper. Chinese Ambassador to France Lu Shaye accused "external anti-China forces" of being behind the protests and called them a "color revolution."


Critics were quick to point out Beijing's double standard when Chinese state media backed U.S. college protesters.


Sean Haines, a British man who worked for Chinese state media from 2016 to 2019, told VOA that Chinese state media's extensive coverage of Western demonstrations is a consistent policy.


"At Xinhua, when we chose the running order for news, foreign protests were always promoted," he said, "especially if it was around election times. 'Look how scary foreign democracies are, aren't you glad China doesn't have this?'"


He said footage of protests is easy to find in places with a free press, such as the United States and the West, while there are almost no images of protests in China, a one-party authoritarian state where public demonstrations are quickly stopped.


"It's ironic." he said. "China is using [the] West's free speech, openness, right to protest — against itself."


Although Chinese authorities have not declared support for any side in the Israel-Hamas war, they were reluctant to condemn the militants' October attack and repeatedly blamed Israel and the U.S. for the conflict in Gaza.


At the same time, antisemitic and anti-Israel sentiments, including conspiracy theories, have been allowed on China's highly censored social media.


A popular claim is that U.S. support for Israel is not because of history and democratic values but because a Jewish cabal secretly controls U.S. politics and business.


Hu Xijin, a special commentator and former editor-in-chief of China's state-run Global Times, posted on social media site Weibo on April 19 that all walks of life in the U.S. "cannot suppress the protests of college students everywhere, which shows that the Jewish political and business alliance's control over American public opinion has declined."

## Seeking consultancy: understanding joining obstacles for non-member journals

date: 2024-05-01, from: Crossref Blog

<p>Crossref is undertaking a large program, dubbed <a href="https://www.crossref.org/community/special-programs/resourcing-crossref/">'RCFS' (Resourcing Crossref for Future Sustainability)</a> that will initially tackle five specific issues with our fees. We haven’t increased any of our fees in nearly two decades, and while we’re still okay financially and do not have a revenue growth goal, we do have inclusion and simplification goals. <a href="https://www.crossref.org/pdfs/research-consulting-rcfs-report-public.pdf">This report from Research Consulting</a> helped to narrow down the five priority projects for 2024-2025 around these three core goals:</p>

</span>
</div>
<h2 id="work-to-date">Work to date</h2>
<p>As part of the RCFS program, we are working closely with our Membership &amp; Fees Committee to discuss insights, gather feedback, and make recommendations to the Board. As a first step, we have surveyed and received responses from around 1000 of the current 8,000 Crossref members in our lowest membership fee tier ($275 USD). We are now starting to distill that data and will discuss it on our <a href="https://www.crossref.org/events/the-shape-of-things-to-come">community call on May 8th</a> and subsequently with the M&amp;F Committee to inform recommendations for fee changes that may going into effect in 2025 or 2026.</p>
<h2 id="request-for-information-rfi-about-community-consultation-project">Request For Information (RFI) about community consultation project</h2>
<p>While we have useful data from existing Crossref members, we know that there are many thousands of journals that are not (yet) members, and we need to understand this group better, in particular, to document and address the financial obstacles as well as the technical or social challenges.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are looking for community facilitation expertise, with multiple language skills, to conduct a series of focus groups with non-member journals, with a summary and insights report (in English) provided by the end of June 2024.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All the data and documentation will be available publicly on the dedicated <a href="https://www.crossref.org/community/special-programs/resourcing-crossref/">RCFS Program website</a></p>
<p>As well as designing, conducting, and summarising the results of some focus groups (participants for which will be gathered via our own contacts and those of partners such as DOAJ, EIFL, and the Free Journal Network) we would like the consultant to review work such as the <a href="https://diamasproject.eu/diamas-results-institutional-landscape-survey/" target="_blank">DIAMAS institutional publishing report</a>, and identify data relevant to Crossref’s fee model.</p>
<p>If you would like to respond, please provide the following information and send it to Kora Korzec at <a href="mailto:feedback@crossref.org">feedback@crossref.org</a> by <strong>15th May</strong>:</p>
<ul>

<li>Confirmation that the timeline is workable</li>

That&#8217;s not to say players don&#8217;t do interesting things with it, but unless a song is intentionally crooked, the structure of the song remains the same throughout. A typical structure is [&#8230;]

## Tesla’s Identity Crisis Gets Hardcore

date: 2024-04-30, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjE0MzA4My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczOTQ2NzU5OX0.N6cuBg9h0O4vv_-dWjrVMmKjIIletZHKZvvE98vILyI/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">Chaos at Tesla is nothing new. But the company now appears to be going through something of an identity crisis, with its future at war with its past.</p><p>Let’s just recap the past few weeks: First, Tesla released first-quarter delivery numbers that came up <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/tesla-rivian-q1-deliveries" target="_blank">well short</a> of even analysts’ most cynical predictions, followed by first-quarter earnings that were, in a word, <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/tesla-q1-2024-earnings" target="_self"><u>poor</u></a>. In between those two events, <em>Reuters</em> reported that Tesla had canceled a long-promised sub-$30,000 electric vehicle (a report CEO Elon Musk denied ... <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1776272471324606778" target="_blank">sorta</a>), and the company <a href="https://heatmap.news/tesla-layoffs-appliance-week" target="_blank">laid off</a> more than 10% of its workforce.</p><p>All of which brings us to today and reports of <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/musk-plans-more-layoffs-as-two-senior-tesla-executives-depart" target="_blank">further layoffs</a> at Tesla, this time in the company’s Supercharging division. To just about everyone who follows the company, this was shocking news. Tesla’s Supercharging network isn’t just a <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/tesla-ford-supercharger-network" target="_blank">competitive advantage</a>, it’s the de facto national standard for EVs in the United States. Major automakers — <a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2023/05/25/ford-ev-customers-to-gain-access-to-12-000-tesla-superchargers--.html" target="_blank"><u>Ford</u></a>,<a href="https://pressroom.toyota.com/toyota-adopts-the-north-american-charging-standard-to-expand-customer-charging-options/" target="_blank"><u> Toyota</u></a>,<a href="https://news.gm.com/newsroom.detail.html/Pages/news/us/en/2023/jun/0608-gm.html" target="_blank"><u> General Motors</u></a> — and EV startups like Rivian have signed deals with Tesla to use its charger design, known as the North American Charging Standard and designed their new vehicles (<a href="https://twitter.com/Rivian/status/1769758297438159021" target="_blank"><u>or sent adapters</u></a>) so their drivers can access the network.</p><p>The Supercharging network was<strong>, </strong>however, consistent with what might now be called the “old” model of Tesla — a company that tried to “accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy,” as the company’s mission statement put it, by getting as many electric cars (ideally, but not solely, its own) on the road as possible. But that model seems to be on its way out. As Musk told investors on the earnings call, Tesla should be thought of “thought of as an AI or robotics company” — not, anymore, as merely a car company.<br/></p><p>Those Supercharging partnerships weren’t an act of charity. BloombergNEF, Bloomberg’s in-house energy research group, estimated that Tesla’s charging business <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-04-09/tesla-tsla-charging-network-has-become-a-serious-business" target="_blank"><u>could generate three-quarters of a billion dollars of profits by 2030</u></a>. While it doesn’t seem like Tesla is going to rip the Superchargers from the ground, a now-former Tesla employee <a href="https://twitter.com/willjameson/status/1785321812383113251" target="_blank">said on X that</a> “further improvements to standards and engagements across the industry will suffer.” Already the company has <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/04/30/tesla-pulling-back-supercharger-plans-firing-team/" target="_blank">pulled out</a> of four planned new Supercharger locations in New York, according to <em>Electrek</em>.</p><p>“Tesla still plans to grow the Supercharger network, just at a slower pace for new locations and more focus on 100% uptime and expansion of existing locations,” Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1785406795814510785" target="_blank">tweeted</a> (after the market close) Tuesday afternoon.</p><p>If the future of the growth of the Supercharging network is in doubt, Tesla’s expansion of its self-driving efforts (which are still well short of rivals like Waymo’s) is full steam ahead. Close Tesla-watchers have speculated that the future of Tesla’s charging infrastructure will change as the company advances further towards truly autonomous driving and its much-heralded “robotaxi,” which Musk has promised to reveal by August 8. All of this seems to have pleased investors, who responded to the announcement by sending Tesla shares up 10% in aftermarket trading. That share price jumped again Monday, after news that Musk had <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-29/tesla-clears-key-china-fsd-hurdle-with-baidu-mapping-deal" target="_blank">paved the way</a> for Full Self-Driving to be deployed in China.</p><p>One would think that reports of Tesla further tightening its focus on artificial intelligence and automation would have delighted these investors. The company's burned some $2.5 billion of cash in the first quarter thanks to both its extravagant spending on developing its AI capabilities and the fact that it made too many cars for what turned out to be a soft electric vehicle market. “Hopefully these actions are making it clear that we need to be absolutely hard core about headcount and cost reduction,” Musk wrote in an email to staff about the Supercharging layoffs, according to <em>The Information</em>. “While some on exec staff are taking this seriously, most are not yet doing so.” And yet shares were down 5.5% by the time the market closed on Tuesday.</p><p>The investment community can’t seem to decide whether it wants Tesla to be the type of company that will devote its resources to a mass market car or throw them at a much more exciting — though by no means assured — autonomous driving play. </p><p>In its earnings presentation, Tesla said that new models were coming, but not on a whole new platform, which meant that there would less capital expenditure for a new production line. For some analysts, it was all they needed to hear, Morningstar's Seth Goldstein wrote a note titled “Our Long-Term Growth Thesis Is Confirmed as Affordable Vehicle Still in Development.”</p><p>And some in the the analyst community were  also jazzed by Musk's China jaunt. Morgan Stanley’s Adam Jonas, a longtime Tesla bull, hailed the  trip, writing “whether Tesla’s CEO is sleeping on a floor or on a plane ... the message is clear: he’s back.” Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities, another Tesla optimist, said approval for FSD in China was “a watershed moment for the Tesla story.” As recently as Tuesday morning, <em>Axios</em> cautiously <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-generate-1b872610-0635-11ef-9e18-652cbf4c7d1e.html?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosgenerate&stream=top" target="_blank">declared</a> that the company “may be steadily regaining investor confidence after a rough patch.”</p><p>Tesla is also working on wireless charging, as was confirmed last year in a video hosted by, of all people, Jay Leno. Tesla’s design chief, Franz von Holzhausen, <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/701458/tesla-confirms-its-working-on-wireless-inductive-ev-charger/" target="_blank">told Leno</a> that “we are working on inductive charging. You don’t even need to plug anything in at that point. You just drive over the pad in your garage and you start charging.” It’s obvious why this type of charging would be more conducive to autonomous driving than the company’s exist Superchargers, as all they would require is driving over them.<strong><em></em></strong></p><p>Even the multiple rounds of deep layoffs are a sign to some Tesla optimists that Musk’s attention is now fully devoted to the company. When asked by an analyst on the earnings call to “talk about where your heart is at in terms of your interests,” Musk said that Tesla “constitutes a majority of my work time,” adding: I'm going to make sure Tesla is quite prosperous.” <strong></strong></p><p>If investors are sending mixed messages, Musk, certainly, has made his preference clear. Tesla will become a autonomous driving company or die trying — at least until he changes his mind again.</p>

## You can’t just assume UTF-8

date: 2024-04-30, from: OS News

Humans speak countless different languages. Not only are these languages incompatible, but runtime transpilation is a real pain. Sadly, every standardisation initiative has failed. At least there is someone to blame for this state-of-affairs: God. It was him, after-all, who cursed humanity to speak different languages, in an early dispute over a controversial property development. However, mankind can only blame itself for the fact that computers struggle to talk to each other. And one of the biggest problems is the most simple: computers do not agree on how to write letters in binary. ↫ Cal Paterson For most users, character encoding issues are not something they have to deal with. Programmers and other people who deal with the lower levels of computing, however, deal with this way more often than they should.

## Blinken says ‘time to act is now’ for Hamas to accept cease-fire deal

date: 2024-04-30, from: VOA News USA

Amman, Jordan — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken expressed determination Wednesday to achieve a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas that includes the release of hostages Hamas is holding in Gaza, and said the only reason that goal would not be achieved “is because of Hamas.”


“There is a proposal on the table, and as we’ve said, no delays, no excuses, the time is now,” Blinken said as he met with Israeli President Isaac Herzog in Tel Aviv.


Blinken said the meeting would also include discussion of humanitarian aid for Gaza.


“At the same time, even as we’re working with relentless determination to get the cease-fire that brings the hostages home, we also have to be focused on people in Gaza who are suffering in this crossfire of Hamas’ making.”


The top U.S. diplomat has repeatedly called on Hamas to accept the cease-fire proposal during a trip to the region that included earlier stops in Saudi Arabia and Jordan.


Herzog said the return of hostages held by Hamas “is and should be the top priority of the international community.”


Following the meeting, Blinken spoke with demonstrators outside who held signs and chanted slogans calling for the hostages in Gaza to be brought home.


Blinken told the demonstrators he had met with families of the hostages and told them, “Bringing your loved ones home is at the heart of everything we’re trying to do.”


Hamas is believed to still be holding about 100 hostages, along with the remains of about 30 others, after taking around 250 people hostage in the October 7 attack on Israel in which the militants killed 1,200 people.


Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 34,500 people, about two-thirds of them women and children, according to the health ministry in Gaza.




Blinken met Tuesday with Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi and King Abdullah II, before meeting with Sigrid Kaag, U.N. senior humanitarian and reconstruction coordinator for Gaza.


Blinken thanked Abdullah for Jordan’s leadership in facilitating the delivery of humanitarian aid, including joint U.S.-Jordan airdrops that to date have delivered more than 1,000 tons of humanitarian assistance to Palestinians in Gaza.


The two leaders discussed joint efforts to expedite the flow of additional urgently needed aid to Gaza from Jordan through land routes. Blinken also commended the king’s commitment to economic modernization and vital public sector reforms.


Later Tuesday, Blinken met with Palestinians from Gaza at the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs before meeting with Kaag. Blinken told Kaag he was anxious to hear directly from her, adding, “The entire team is doing extraordinary work to ensure that people in Gaza get the help and support and the assistance they need.”


US, Saudi talks


In Riyadh earlier this week Blinken said the United States is close to finishing a security agreement with Saudi Arabia that would be offered if the country makes peace with Israel.




“The work that Saudi Arabia, the United States have been doing together in terms of our own agreements, I think, is potentially very close to completion,” Blinken told an audience at the World Economic Forum on Monday.


He added the two nations have done intensive work together over the last month on Israeli-Saudi normalization.


Blinken disclosed that he was scheduled to be in Saudi Arabia and Israel on October 10 last year to focus specifically on the Palestinian part of the normalization deal because that is an essential component. But it did not happen because of the Hamas terror attack on Israel.


“In order to move forward with normalization, two things will be required: Calm in Gaza and a credible pathway to a Palestinian state,” Blinken said.


U.S. officials have said creating a pathway to a Palestinian state with security guarantees for Israel is key to lasting peace and security in the Middle East and to Israel's integration in the region.


The Saudis have demanded, as a prerequisite, to see an Israeli commitment to the two-state solution.


Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected the two-state solution and the return of the Palestinian Authority to control Gaza, demands that are widely supported by the international community.


Nimrod Goren, a senior fellow for Israeli affairs at the Middle East Institute, told VOA in an email, “Saudi Arabia has been gradually opening towards Israel for a decade. Significant progress was made in the months prior to the Hamas attack of October 7, with the hope of linking an Israeli-Saudi normalization agreement to a pre-presidential election, U.S.-Saudi defense pact. The war stalled the process, but talks are continuing and are at a decisive phase.”


If Netanyahu's opposition to the two-state solution remains unchanged, Goren added, he might struggle to secure normalization with Saudi Arabia.


VOA’s Cindy Saine contributed to this report.

## A few facts about POSIX

date: 2024-04-30, from: OS News

Over 35 years ago, these problems with software portability led to the emergence of the first POSIX standard in 1988. The acronym was coined by Richard Stallman, who added &#8220;X&#8221; to the end of Portable Operating System Interface. It&#8217;s meant to provide a specification of the interface that different Unix operating systems should have in common, including programming languages and tools. It&#8217;s important to note that the interface is portable, and not the implementation. ↫ vorakl While POSIX certainly isn&#8217;t perfect, and support for it in various operating systems claiming to support POSIX even less so, there&#8217;s no denying its success. Even if the dream of 100% source code portability isn&#8217;t possible under POSIX for applications that are a little more complex than basic CLI tools, there&#8217;s enough portability that platforms like Linux, the various BSDs, macOS, and others, can share quite a bit of code. One of my favourite things about POSIX is that it shows up in the most unexpected of places. Windows, for instance, has had various options for POSIX compatibility, some of which straight from Microsoft itself, like the currently well-known Windows Subsystem for Linux, but also mostly forgotten options like the Microsoft POSIX subsystem that shipped with Windows NT until Windows 2000, or the very rudimentary POSIX compatibility in the Windows C Runtime Library and Windows Sockets API. OS/2 had POSIX compatibility as well, through EMX (Eberhard Mattes eXtender). It gave OS/2 &#8211; and MS-DOS &#8211; a POSIX API, and even provided access to native OS/2 APIs as well, and could run 32bit applications. You&#8217;d be surprised by how many more operating systems offered forms of POSIX compatibility, either out of the box or through first or third party add-ons.

## RISC-V support in Android just got a big setback

date: 2024-04-30, from: OS News

Although Google has shown significant progress in recent weeks in improving RISC-V support in Android, it seems that we’re still quite a bit away from seeing RISC-V hardware running certified builds of Android. Earlier today, a Senior Staff Software Engineer at Google who, according to their LinkedIn, leads the Android Systems Team and works on Android’s Linux kernel fork, submitted a series of patches to AOSP that “remove ACK’s support for riscv64.” The description of these patches states that “support for risc64 GKI kernels is discontinued.” ↫ Mishaal Rahman Google provided Android Authority with a statement, claiming that Android will continue to support RISC-V. What these patches do, however, is remove support for the architecture from the Generic Kernel Image, which is the only type of kernel Google certifies for Android, which means that it is now no longer possible to ship a certified Android device that uses RISC-V. Any OEM shipping a RISC-V Android device will have to create and maintain its own kernel fork with the required patches. This doesn&#8217;t seem to align with Google&#8217;s statement. So, unless Google intends to add RISC-V support back into GKI, there won&#8217;t be any officially certified Android devices running on RISC-V. Definitely an odd chain of events here.

## Democrats say they will save Speaker Mike Johnson's job if Republicans try to oust him

date: 2024-04-30, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — House Democrats will vote to save Republican Speaker Mike Johnson's job should some of his fellow GOP lawmakers seek to remove him from the position, Democratic leaders said Tuesday, avoiding a repeat of when eight Republicans joined with Democrats to oust his predecessor, former Rep. Kevin McCarthy.


Johnson, R-La., has come under heavy criticism from some Republicans for moving forward with aid for Ukraine as part of a $95 billion emergency spending package that passed this month. It would take only a handful of Republicans to remove Johnson from the speakership if the Democratic caucus went along with the effort.


But Democratic leaders took that possibility off the table.


"At this moment, upon completion of our national security work, the time has come to turn the page on this chapter of Pro-Putin Republican obstruction," said a statement from the top three House Democrats, Reps. Hakeem Jeffries, Katherine Clark and Pete Aguilar. "We will vote to table Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's Motion to Vacate the Chair. If she invokes the motion, it will not succeed."


Greene, R-Ga., earlier this month filed a resolution with the House clerk — called a motion to vacate — that would remove Johnson from office if approved by the House. And while Greene did not force the resolution to be taken up immediately, she told reporters she was laying the groundwork for future consideration. She had two co-sponsors, Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Paul Gosar, R-Ariz.


Johnson was quick to distance himself from Democrats on the issue, saying he had no conversations with Jeffries or anyone else about saving his job.


"I was laser-focused on getting the supplemental done," Johnson said, referring to the aid package. "I've had colleagues from both parties come up to me on the floor, of course, and say we won't stand for this. ... I've not requested assistance from anyone. I'm not focused on that at all."


Many House Republicans are eager to move past the divisions that have tormented their ranks ever since taking the majority last January. At a closed-door session Tuesday morning, much of the discussion focused on how to create unity in the party heading into the November elections.


Rep. Andy Barr, R-Ky., said Republicans heard from Michael Whatley, the new chairman of the Republican National Committee, who emphasized that Donald Trump, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee, wants to unify the majority in the House. He said that's a message that certainly helps Johnson.


"What he wants is a unified Republican majority, so my message is singing from the same song sheet as President Trump," Barr said.


Still, Greene indicated she may still move forward with the effort to remove Johnson, tweeting on X that she believes in recorded votes to put "Congress on record." She also called Johnson "officially the Democratic Speaker of the House" and questioned "what slimy deal" he made for Democratic support.


"Americans deserve to see the Uniparty on full display. I'm about to give them their coming out party!" Greene tweeted. "Uniparty" is a derisive term some Republicans use to describe cooperation between some fellow Republicans and Democrats.

## FBI: Scammers stole more than $3.4 billion from older Americans last year

date: 2024-04-30, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Scammers stole more than $3.4 billion from older Americans last year, according to an FBI report released Tuesday that shows a rise in losses through increasingly sophisticated criminal tactics to trick the vulnerable into giving up their life savings.


Losses from scams reported by Americans over the age of 60 last year were up 11% over the year before, according to the FBI's report. Investigators are warning of a rise in brazen schemes to drain bank accounts that involve sending couriers in person to collect cash or gold from victims.


"It can be a devastating impact to older Americans who lack the ability to go out and make money," said Deputy Assistant Director James Barnacle of the FBI's Criminal Investigative Division. "People lose all their money. Some people become destitute."


The FBI received more than 100,000 complaints by victims of scams over the age of 60 last year, with nearly 6,000 people losing more than $100,000. It follows a sharp rise in reported losses by older Americans in the two years after the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, when people were stuck at home and easier for scammers to reach over the phone.


Barnacle said investigators are seeing organized, transnational criminal enterprises targeting older Americans through a variety of schemes, like romance scams and investment frauds.


The most commonly reported fraud among older adults last year was tech support scams, in which criminals pose over the phone as technical or customer service representatives. In one such scam authorities say is rising in popularity, criminals impersonate technology, banking and government officials to convince victims that foreign hackers have infiltrated their bank accounts and instruct them that to protect their money they should move it to a new account — one secretly controlled by the scammers.


Federal investigators saw an uptick between May and December of scammers using live couriers to take money from victims duped into believing their accounts had been compromised, according to the FBI. In those cases, scammers tell victims that their bank accounts have been hacked and that they need to liquidate their assets into cash or buy gold or other precious metals to protect their funds. Then the fraudsters arrange for a courier to pick it up in person.


"A lot of the the fraud schemes are asking victims to send money via a wire transfer, or a cryptocurrency transfer. When the victim is reluctant to do that, they're given an alternative," Barnacle said. "And so the bad guy will use courier services."


Earlier this month, an 81-year-old Ohio man fatally shot an Uber driver he thought was trying to rob him after receiving scam phone calls, according to authorities.


The man had been receiving calls from someone pretending to be an officer from the local court who demanded money. The Uber driver had been told to retrieve a package from the man's home, a request authorities say was possibly made by the same scam caller or an accomplice.


The staggering losses to older Americans are likely an undercount. Only about half of the more than 880,000 complaints reported to the FBI's Internet Crime Compliance Center last year included information on the age of the victim.

## Survey: US consumer confidence at lowest level since 2022

date: 2024-04-30, from: VOA News USA

Washington — U.S. consumers appear less optimistic about the jobs market and more worried about future financial conditions, bringing a closely watched confidence metric to its lowest level since July 2022, a survey showed Tuesday.


The consumer confidence index fell to 97.0 in April, said The Conference Board, significantly below the 104.0 reading that analysts anticipated.


This marks the third straight month consumer confidence has worsened, the report said, and comes as President Joe Biden struggles to boost perceptions about the economy as his reelection campaign ramps up.


"Consumers became less positive about the current labor market situation, and more concerned about future business conditions, job availability, and income," said Dana Peterson, chief economist at The Conference Board.


But she added that despite the slip, "optimism about the present situation continues to more than offset concerns about the future."


The biggest worries surrounded "elevated price levels, especially for food and gas," said Peterson.


Meanwhile, politics and global conflicts were "distant runners-up," she added.


While consumers rated current business conditions "positively," their views of the labor market weakened with more reporting that jobs are hard to get, said The Conference Board.


Consumers also became less upbeat about their families' financial situations, both currently and in the future.


"Perceptions about the labor market deteriorated even as job growth remains robust, and the unemployment rate is historically low," noted Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics.


"A deteriorating trend in sentiment could persist," she cautioned.


This risks bogging down spending and growth, given that inflation remains persistent and interest rate cuts are "not imminent," she said.

## Florida Democrats hope abortion, marijuana issues draw young voters

date: 2024-04-30, from: VOA News USA

WEST PALM BEACH, FLORIDA — Jordan Vassallo is lukewarm about casting her first presidential ballot for President Joe Biden in November. But when the 18-year-old senior at Jupiter High School in Florida thinks about the things she cares about, she says her vote for the Democratic incumbent is an “obvious choice.”


Vassallo will be voting for a constitutional ballot amendment that would prevent the state of Florida from prohibiting abortion before a fetus can survive on its own — essentially the standard that existed nationally before the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the constitutional protections to abortion and left the matter for states to decide.


Passage of the amendment would wipe away Florida's six-week abortion law, which Vassallo says makes no sense.


“Most people don't know they are pregnant at six weeks,” she said.


Biden, despite her reticence, will get her vote as well.


In Florida and across the United States, voters in Vassallo's age group could prove pivotal in the 2024 election, from the presidency to ballot amendments and down-ballot races that will determine who controls Congress. She is likely to be among more than 8 million new voters eligible to vote this November since the 2022 elections, according to Tufts University Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement.


While some of those voters share Vassallo's priorities of gun violence prevention and abortion rights, recent protests on college campuses about the war between Israel and Hamas, including at some Florida campuses, have thrown a new element of uncertainty into the mix. In Florida and elsewhere, observers across the political spectrum are looking on with intense interest.




Florida Democrats hope young voters will be driven to the polls by ballot amendments legalizing marijuana and enshrining abortion rights. They hope the more tolerant views of young voters on those issues will reverse an active voter registration edge of nearly 900,000 for Republicans in Florida, which has turned from the ultimate swing state in 2000 to reliably Republican in recent years.


According to AP VoteCast, an expansive survey of the electorate, about 8 in 10 Florida voters under age 45 in the 2022 midterm elections said the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade had an impact on their decision to vote and who to support. The youngest voters, under age 30, appeared more likely than others to say the decision was the single most important factor in their votes, with about 3 in 10 saying that, compared with about 2 in 10 older voters.


Nathan Mitchell, president of Florida Atlantic University’s College Republicans, questions how impactful abortion will be in the election.


According to AP VoteCast, relatively few Florida voters in the 2022 midterms believed abortion should be either completely banned or fully permitted in all cases. Even among Republicans, just 12% said abortion should be illegal in all cases. About half of Republicans said it should be banned in most cases.


Voters under 45 were slightly more likely than others to say abortion should always be legal, with 30% taking that position.


Mitchell said while abortion is a strong issue, especially for women, he doesn't think it will drive many younger voters to the polls.


“I think other amendments will probably do that, especially the recreational marijuana amendment,” Mitchell said. “I think that’s going to bring out a lot more voters than abortion will.”


The AP VoteCast survey lends some credence to his thinking. About 6 in 10 Florida voters in the 2022 elections favored legalizing the recreational use of marijuana nationwide, the survey found. Among voters under 45, that was 76%. Still, it’s unclear how important that issue is for younger voters compared with other issues.




The big question is whether other issues can override Biden's enthusiasm problem among young Florida voters and elsewhere.


Six in 10 adults under 30 nationally said in a December AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll that they would be dissatisfied with Biden as the Democratic Party nominee in 2024. About 2 in 10 said in a March poll that “excited” would describe their emotions if Biden were reelected.


Young voters were crucial to the broad and racially diverse coalition that helped elect Biden in 2020. About 6 in 10 voters under 30 backed Biden nationally, according to AP VoteCas. A Pew Research Center survey showed that those under age 30 made up 38% of new or irregular voters in that election.


In Florida, Biden won 64% of young voters — similar to his national numbers.


New issues that concern young voters have emerged this year. Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas war has sparked protests at college campuses across the country, and Biden's inability to deliver broad-based student loan forgiveness affects many young voters directly. Concern about climate change also continues to grow. AP-NORC data from February shows that majorities of Americans under 30 disapprove of how Biden is handling a range of issues, including the conflict between the Israelis and Palestinians, immigration, the economy, climate change and abortion policy.


But in Florida, it will be abortion rights and marijuana that give voters actual control over issues beyond a presidential rematch most did not want but got anyway, said Trevian Briskey, a 21-year-old FAU student.


Tony Figueroa, president of Miami Young Republicans, said the abortion issue is important to many young voters, regardless of where they stand. He noted, however, that Florida “is a very conservative state.” That means some of the young voters motivated by the issue favor stricter abortion laws.


“Given how Florida has become so much more red over the past couple of years, really it’s more of a way to galvanize or mobilize young voters where this is an important issue for them,” Figueroa said. “It’s really a way to get them to come out in droves.”


Matheus Xavier, 21, who studies biology at Florida Atlantic University, said he considered voting for Trump at some point, but changed his mind since Biden fell more in line with the things he cares about, including the preservation of abortion rights.


“At the end of the day, you got to go with what you support," he said. "I guess Biden kind of shows more of that. If there was another option that was actually good, I’d probably go for that.”

<li>introducing page limits for the reviews</li>
<li>creating a unified federal review process</li>
<li>establishing one lead agency for handling reviews</li>
</ul><p>
	The new rule says federal agencies must consider a project’s impacts on climate change, as well as environmental justice. It also reverses a 2020 overhaul carried out by former President Trump that the Biden administration called “legally questionable.” Brenda Mallory, chair of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, said the changes “will help speed infrastructure and permitting, but without losing sight of the environmental and health benefits we need to protect.”

</p><h3>4. Plastic treaty talks end with no production cap in sight</h3><p>
<span></span>The latest meeting on a global plastics treaty has come to an end in Canada. While there was some meaningful progress on the draft text of an agreement (which must be finalized by the end of the year), deep divisions remain over whether the final text should include a cap on how much plastic can be manufactured. Environmental groups point out that plastic production has doubled in just 20 years and is set to triple in coming decades. Fossil fuel companies and oil-producing nations, naturally, prefer to promote plastic recycling instead of plastic reduction.

In December 2020, when the pandemic illustrated the extraordinary disadvantage created by the inability of those in low-income households to communicate online with schools and medical professionals, then-president Trump signed into law an emergency program to provide funding to make internet access affordable. In 2021, Congress turned that idea into the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) and made it part of the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (also known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law).

date: 2024-04-30, from: VOA News USA

While Washington has so far failed to get Israel and Hamas to agree to a cease-fire in the Gaza conflict, Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited the Middle East on Monday to try to improve the humanitarian situation and lay the groundwork for what happens in Gaza — and the region — after the war ends. VOA’s Anita Powell reports from the White House.

## Rolling Stones show no signs of slowing down as they begin their latest tour

date: 2024-04-30, from: VOA News USA

houston — Time marches on and all good things must come to an end. But don't tell that to The Rolling Stones.


What many believe to be the greatest rock 'n' roll band in the world showed no signs of slowing down anytime soon as they kicked off their latest tour Sunday night at NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas.


The Stones have been touring for more than 60 years. Frontman Mick Jagger and lead guitarist Keith Richards are both 80, with guitarist Ronnie Wood not far behind at 76. Their tour is being sponsored in part by AARP.


But during a vibrant two-hour show, the Stones played with the energy of a band that was on tour for the first time.


"It's great to be back in the Lone Star State," Jagger told the packed stadium, filled with longtime fans, many wearing faded concert shirts from previous tours.


Jagger often strutted up and down the stage with seemingly boundless energy while Richards and Wood played many familiar guitar riffs beloved by fans. Jagger often led the audience in sing-alongs.


"The energy level is up and it's always up with them. The age doesn't show," Dale Skjerseth, the Stones' production director, said Friday before the concert.


The Stones have hit the road to support the release of their latest album, "Hackney Diamonds," the band's first record of original music since 2005.


Houston was the first stop on the band's 16-city tour across the U.S. and Canada. Other cities on the tour include New Orleans, Philadelphia and Vancouver, British Columbia. The tour ends on July 17 in Santa Clara, California.


During Sunday's 18-song concert set list, the Stones played several tracks off the new record, including the lead single, "Angry." They also played classics including "Sympathy for the Devil," "Gimme Shelter," “Honky Tonk Women" and "Start Me Up."


After playing "Beast of Burden," Jagger said that concertgoers in Houston had voted to include it on the set list.


"You can't go wrong with that," one man in the audience could be heard screaming.


The Stones also played some unexpected choices, including "Rocks Off," from their 1972 double album "Exile on Main St." and "Out of Time," a 1966 song that Jagger said during the concert had not ever been played by the band in the U.S.


With the 2021 death of drummer Charlie Watts, the Stones are now comprised of the core trio of Jagger, Richards and Wood. On Sunday, they were backed by various musicians including two keyboardists, a new drummer, backup singers and a brass section.


While the stage was surrounded by a large collection of video screens projecting images throughout the show, the main focus of the concert was the band and their songs.


Before Sunday's concert, Jagger spent time on Friday touring NASA's Johnson Space Center in suburban Houston, posting photos on his Instagram account of him with astronauts inside Mission Control.


"I had an amazing trip to the space center," Jagger said.


When asked if the band might be thinking about retiring, Skjerseth said he doubts that will happen.


"This is not the end. They're very enthused," he said.

## Campus Gaza protests are new political flashpoint in US

## Columbia suspends pro-Palestinian protesters after encampment talks stall

date: 2024-04-30, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — Columbia University on Monday began suspending pro-Palestinian activists who refused to dismantle a tent encampment on its New York City campus after the Ivy League school declared a stalemate in talks seeking to end the polarizing protest.


University President Nemat Minouche Shafik said in a statement that days of negotiations between student organizers and academic leaders had failed to persuade demonstrators to remove the dozens of tents set up to express opposition to Israel's war in Gaza.


The crackdown at Columbia, at the center of Gaza-related protests roiling university campuses across the U.S. in recent weeks, came as police at the University of Texas at Austin arrested dozens of students whom they doused with pepper spray at a pro-Palestinian rally.


Columbia sent a letter on Monday morning warning that students who did not vacate the encampment by 2 p.m. ET and sign a form promising to abide by university policies would face suspension and become ineligible to complete the semester in good standing.




"We have begun suspending students as part of this next phase of our efforts to ensure safety on our campus," said Ben Chang, a university spokesperson, at a briefing on Monday evening.


"The encampment has created an unwelcoming environment for many of our Jewish students and faculty and a noisy distraction that interferes with the teaching, learning and preparing for final exams," Chang said.


Earlier, Shafik said Columbia would not divest from finances in Israel, a key demand of the protesters. Instead, she offered to invest in health and education in Gaza and make Columbia's direct investment holdings more transparent.


Protesters have vowed to keep their encampment on the Manhattan campus until Columbia meets three demands: divestment, transparency in university finances, and amnesty for students and faculty disciplined for their part in the protests.


"These repulsive scare tactics mean nothing compared to the deaths of over 34,000 Palestinians. We will not move until Columbia meets our demands or we are moved by force," leaders of the Columbia Student Apartheid Divest coalition said in a statement read at a news conference following the deadline.


Hundreds of demonstrators, many wearing traditional Palestinian keffiyeh scarves, marched in circles around the exterior of the encampment chanting, "Disclose! Divest! We will not stop, we will not rest."


Shafik faced an outcry from many students, faculty and outside observers for summoning New York City police two weeks ago to dismantle the encampment.


After more than 100 arrests were made, students restored the encampment on a hedge-lined lawn of the university grounds within days of the April 18 police action.


Since then, students at dozens of campuses from California to New England have set up similar encampments to demonstrate their anger over the Israeli operation in Gaza and the perceived complicity of their schools in it.


The pro-Palestinian rallies have sparked intense campus debate over where school officials should draw the line between freedom of expression and hate speech


Students protesting Israel's military offensive in Gaza, including some Jewish peace activists, have said they are being censured as antisemitic merely for criticizing the Israeli government or for expressing support for Palestinian rights.


"The movement itself is not antisemitic," said Nicholas Fink, a freshman history major at Columbia who has not participated in the protests.


He is among a few dozen Jewish students who met privately with U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson during a campus visit by Republican members of Congress last week. Johnson and other congressional Republicans have claimed that Columbia and other universities have turned a blind eye to antisemitic hostility and harassment on campus.


Some Jewish groups argue that anti-Israel rhetoric frequently delves into or feeds overt forms of anti-Jewish hatred and calls for violence, and thus should not be tolerated


Student protests abound


At the University of California, Los Angeles, where opposing sides clashed over the weekend, pro-Israeli activists set up a large screen and loudspeakers to play a tape loop of the Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Hamas militants. The video appears aimed at countering pro-Hamas chants that seeped into campus protests in support of Palestinian civilians besieged in Gaza.


UCLA also stepped-up security around a pro-Palestinian encampment, consisting of more than 50 tents surrounded by metal fencing near the main administration building on campus.


Civil rights groups have criticized law enforcement tactics on some campuses, such as Atlanta's Emory University and the University of Texas at Austin, where police in riot gear and on horseback moved against protesters last week, taking dozens into custody before charges were dropped for lack of probable cause.


Protests, and arrests, flared anew on the Austin campus on Monday.


Campus police backed by Texas state troopers attempted to break up a large student protest using pepper spray and flash-bang charges, arresting at least 43 people, according to defense attorney George Lobb, who said he confirmed the number with court and jail staff processing the detentions.


Video posted on social media showed police pulling individual students from a gathering on a grassy area where demonstrators sat and locked arms, some of them shouting, "Let them go!" State troopers in riot gear stood guard behind the uniformed police.


Virginia Tech said on Monday that 91 protesters arrested on Sunday night at a student-led encampment had been charged with trespassing. Video posted on social media showed demonstrators chanting, "Shame on you" as some were taken into custody.

## Winner of $1.3 billion Powerball jackpot is an immigrant from Laos who has cancer

date: 2024-04-30, from: VOA News USA

SALEM, Oregon — One of the winners of a $1.3 billion Powerball jackpot this month is an immigrant from Laos who has had cancer for eight years and had his latest chemotherapy treatment last week.


Cheng "Charlie" Saephan, 46, of Portland told a news conference held by the Oregon Lottery on Monday that he and his 37-year-old wife, Duanpen, are taking half the money, and the rest is going to a friend, Laiza Chao, 55, of the Portland suburb of Milwaukie. Chao had chipped in $100 to buy a batch of tickets with them. They are taking a lump sum payment, $422 million after taxes.


"I will be able to provide for my family and my health," he said, adding that he'd "find a good doctor for myself."


Saephan, who has two young children, said that as a cancer patient, he wondered, "How am I going to have time to spend all of this money? How long will I live?"


After they bought the shared tickets, Chao sent a photo of the tickets to Saephan and said, "We're billionaires." It was a joke before the actual drawing, he said, but the next day they won.


Chao, 55, was on her way to work when Saephan called her with the news: "You don't have to go anymore," he said.


Saephan said he was born in Laos and moved to Thailand in 1987, before immigrating to the U.S. in 1994. He wore a sash at the news conference identifying himself as Iu Mien, a southeast Asian ethnic group with roots in southern China. Many Iu Mein were subsistence farmers and assisted American forces during the Vietnam war; after the conflict, thousands of Iu Mien families fled to Thailand to avoid retribution and eventually settled in the U.S.


Tens of thousands of Iu Mien people live along the West Coast, with a sizeable and active community in Portland.


Saephan graduated from high school in 1996 and has lived in Portland for 30 years. He worked as a machinist for an aerospace company.


In the weeks leading up to the drawing, he wrote out numbers for the game on a piece of paper and slept with it under his pillow, he said. He prayed that he would win, saying, "I need some help — I don't want to die yet unless I have done something for my family first."


The winning Powerball ticket was sold in early April at a Plaid Pantry convenience store in Portland, ending a winless streak that had stretched more than three months. The Oregon Lottery said it had to go through a security and vetting process before announcing the identity of the person who came forward to claim the prize.


Under Oregon law, with few exceptions, lottery players cannot remain anonymous. Winners have a year to claim the top prize.


The jackpot had a cash value of $621 million before taxes if the winner chose to take a lump sum rather than an annuity paid over 30 years, with an immediate payout followed by 29 annual installments. The prize is subject to federal taxes and state taxes in Oregon.


The $1.3 billion prize is the fourth-largest Powerball jackpot in history, and the eighth largest among U.S. jackpot games, according to the Oregon Lottery.


The biggest U.S. lottery jackpot won was $2.04 billion in California in 2022.
