<h2 id="the-family-sized-hole-in-the-electric-car-market">The
Family-Sized Hole in the Electric Car Market</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-20, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTUxMDMyOC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcxNDAwODQ0Nn0.c7OKUocMGuBuJSNubgoXfAB2Jfgi8xeRdTW9uCp1IvI/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
The exemplar of the American ‚Äúfamily car‚Äù is an ever-changing thing.
Mid-century land yachts gave way to wood-paneled
<a href="https://fraserengineco.com/fraser-fast-facts/wagon-queen-family-truckster/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Griswold
family station wagons</a>. The SUV craze of the 1990s established
vehicles like the forest green Eddie Bauer Ford Explorer I grew up in as
the de facto kid-haulers, especially for parents who wouldn‚Äôt be caught
dead in a minivan. Today‚Äôs suburb-dominating soccer-practice crossovers
are their spiritual descendants.
</p>
<p>
Now, though, the question of which car is right for a family has a new
wrinkle: <em>Should we get an electric vehicle? </em>Unfortunately, the
answer for most people who survey the auto landscape appears to be, ‚Äúnot
yet,‚Äù a fact that has contributed to the current feeling of EV limbo.
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p class="drop-caps">
The right family car depends upon your family. My Tesla Model 3 happily
accommodates a newborn, a dog, and a stroller that lives in the trunk.
For most Americans, though, the family car has come to mean something
much larger than my ride: a tall, spacious, affordable, safe, and
reliable crossover with lots of room for endless kid gear and clutter.
Three rows are a must for those with a flock of kids.
</p>
<p>
Therein lies the trouble with today‚Äôs EV fleet. Check
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/te7y2s/ev_for_family/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">online</a>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/whatcarshouldIbuy/comments/17piiil/family_car_ice_or_ev/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">conversations</a>
between parents about the available options and it becomes clear that
perhaps no available electric fits the bill perfectly. The top-selling
Tesla Model Y is a crossover, but not a huge one, and the available
choices like it, the Volkswagen ID.4, and the Ford Mustang Mach-E are
going to cost you more than $40,000, not counting EV tax breaks. Truly
spacious EVs like the Rivian R1S and Tesla Model X have prices that soar
to $70,000 or more. Well-regarded electrics such as the Hyundai Ioniq5
and 6 can‚Äôt match the cargo space of your neighbors‚Äô combustion
crossover. (Ioniq5 has 27 cubic ft. in the back and the Model Y about
30, versus 37.5 for the typical Toyota RAV4 and nearly 40 for the Honda
CR-V.) The parental consensus in many of those Reddit threads? The best
electric family ride is the Chrysler Pacifica plug-in hybrid minivan,
which delivers 32 electric miles before it reverts to gas.
</p>
<p>
A new slate of EVs is just starting to fill in this obvious hole. The
forthcoming
<a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/chevrolet/equinox-ev" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Chevy
Equinox EV</a>, in addition to carrying the name of a top-selling
familiar, safe family car, is supposed to start at a more reasonable
$35,000. Kia used a Super Bowl ad to show off the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/super-bowl-lviii-kia-volkswagen-bmw" target="_self">EV9</a>,
one of the first giant three-row family crossovers to go full EV, and
<a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/hyundai/ioniq-7" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hyundai‚Äôs
Ioniq7</a> will soon follow. The ID.Buzz, an update to the classic VW
bus, brings an all-electric minivan to the market. When it comes down to
a car-buying decision, though, the dealer lots of America are still
wanting for a simple mom-and-dad-mobile to compete with the $30,000
starting price of the Honda CR-V.
</p>
<p>
This gap helps to explain some of the gloom around electric vehicle
sales in 2024. Nearly all the car companies have some kind of true EV on
the market by now, but most of those entrants require buyers to navigate
the confusing, fluid EV tax breaks in order for them to be competitive
with gasoline counterparts. For EVs to make the leap from the early
adoption to the mass adoption state, we need a truly cheap car like what
Tesla and Ford are
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/redwood-is-exactly-what-tesla-needs" target="_self">reportedly
developing</a> for entry-level carbuyers, yes (though, to Detroit‚Äôs
chagrin, it just might come from
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/ford-gm-stellantis-byd" target="_self">China</a>.)
But we also need family-sized EVs that compete on price with the
well-known suburban warriors.
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p class="drop-caps">
Here‚Äôs the bright side. The EV space may be in a ‚Äúgap year,‚Äù but
electric vehicles will soon become big and cheap enough to take their
place as the family car. They will be great at it, and families will get
to experience the ways that
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/why-are-electric-cars-better" target="_self">electric
driving is better</a>.
</p>
<p>
Now that EVs come with battery ranges around 300 miles, a person can
drive down the highway for several hours without stopping to charge. In
other words, the kid‚Äôs need for a bathroom, not the need to charge, will
be the primary motivator behind pit stops.
</p>
<p>
An EV‚Äôs
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/ev-battery-ac-dc-bidirectional" target="_self">ability</a>
to use its battery power for applications other than driving is
tailor-made for the family. While picking up a kid ‚Äî and waiting for
them to come get in the car already ‚Äî one can run the air conditioner
indefinitely and watch Netflix on the big center screen without running
a gasoline engine and polluting the neighborhood. Child can‚Äôt sleep in
the tent on their first camping trip? Sleep in the car all night with
Camp Mode on.
</p>
<p>
Any errand avoided is a gift from the gods, which is why so many parents
now rely on online shopping for durable goods and apps like Instacart to
deliver the groceries. For those who can charge at home or at work, EV
ownership negates the extra stop at the gas station on the way home, the
one where the little ones ask, over and over, whether they can get some
junk food from the convenience store. The absence of oil changes is
pretty great, too. And the first time you use the car‚Äôs battery to keep
the house lights on during a blackout, you‚Äôll feel like you really
earned that World‚Äôs Greatest Dad (or Mom) coffee mug.
</p>
<p>
Don‚Äôt believe the doom, then. Unless you‚Äôre buying a vehicle right now,
your next family car probably <em>is</em> going to be an EV.

Court Rejects Appeal From Trump-Allied Lawyers Over 2020 Election
Lawsuit</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington ‚Äî¬†The Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected an appeal from
Sidney Powell and other lawyers allied with former President Donald
Trump over $150,000 in sanctions they were ordered to pay for abusing
the court system with a sham lawsuit challenging the 2020 election
results in Michigan.¬†</p>
<p>The justices did not comment in leaving in place the sanctions
against seven lawyers who were part of the lawsuit filed on behalf of
six Republican voters after Joe Biden‚Äôs 154,000-vote victory over Trump
in the state.¬†</p>
<p>Among the lawyers is L. Lin Wood, whose name was on the lawsuit. Wood
has insisted he had no role other than to tell Powell he would be
available if she needed a seasoned litigator.¬†</p>
<p>The money is owed to the state and Detroit, for their costs in
defending the lawsuit. The sanctions initially totaled $175,000, but a
federal appeals court reduced them by about $25,000.¬†</p>
<p>In October, Powell pleaded guilty to state criminal charges in
Georgia over her efforts to overturn Trump‚Äôs loss in the state. She
pleaded guilty to six misdemeanors accusing her of conspiring to
intentionally interfere with the performance of election duties.¬†</p>
<p>Powell gained notoriety for saying in November 2020 that she would
‚Äúrelease the Kraken,‚Äù invoking a mythical sea monster when talking about
a lawsuit she planned to file to challenge the results of the
presidential election.</p>

Once upon a time, Sears department stores were everywhere. A subsidiary

department stores to offer their own credits cards, but the Discover

on the history that predated the recently announced Capital One-Discover

<p>date: 2024-02-20, from: Cory Doctorow‚Äôs blog</p>

Method, Phase II. The Bezzle excerpt (Part III): In which Steve Soul

Pluralistic is four (permalink) Four years ago, I started
pluralistic.net, my post-Boing Boing, solo blog project: an ad-free,
tracker-free site that anyone can republish, commercially or
noncommercially. It‚Äôs been a wild four years, featuring over 1,150
editions, many consisting of multiple articles:
https://pluralistic.net/2020/02/19/pluralist-19-feb-2020/ As a project,
Pluralistic has been a roaring success. I‚Äôve published multiple,
significant ‚Äúbreakout‚Äù articles that popularized obscure, important,
highly technical ideas, most notably ‚Äúadversarial interoperability‚Äù:
http://pluralistic.net/tag/adversarial-interoperability ‚ÄúEnd-to-end‚Äù as
a remedy for multiple internet ripoffs, including as a superior
alternative to link-taxes as a means of saving the news industry from
Big Tech predation: https://pluralistic.net/tag/e2e/ and, of course,
‚Äúenshittification‚Äù: https://pluralistic.net/tag/enshittification/ These
are emblematic of the sorts of ideas that I‚Äôve spent the past 20+ years
trying to popularize in tech-policy debates dominated by technologically
illiterate policy ideas (‚Äúabolish Section 230!‚Äù) and politically
illiterate technical ideas (so many to choose from, but let‚Äôs just say
‚Äúcryptocurrency‚Äù). They require that the reader come along for a lot of
cross-disciplinary analysis that often gets deep into the weeds. These
are some of the hardest ideas to convey, but nuanced proposals and
critiques that work on both political and technical axes are the best
hope we have of successfully weathering the polycrisis. Blogging has
always been a part of this project. For nearly 20 years, I posted nearly
every day on Boing Boing ‚Äì 53,906 posts in all! ‚Äì taking note of
everything that seemed important. Keeping a ‚Äúwriter‚Äôs notebook‚Äù in
public imposes an unbeatable rigor, since you can‚Äôt slack off and leave
notes so brief and cryptic that they neither lodge in your subconscious
nor form a record clear enough to refer to in future. By contrast,
keeping public notes produces both a subconscious, supersaturated
solution of fragmentary ideas that rattle around, periodically cohering
into nucleii that crystallize into full-blown ideas for stories, novels,
essays, speeches and nonfiction books. What‚Äôs more, those ripened ideas
are supported by a searchable database of everything I‚Äôve thought about
the subject, often annotated by readers and other writers who‚Äôve
commented on the posts. I call this ‚ÄúThe Memex Method‚Äù:
https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/09/the-memex-method/ Pluralistic marks a
new phase in my deployment of the Memex Method. With 50K+ notes in a
database, I‚Äôve gradually turned Pluralistic into a forum for far more
synthetic, longer-form work that pulls on threads from decades of
research into nothing in particular and everything that seemed
important. Pluralistic is also an experiment in retaining control over
my destiny ‚Äì but not my work. Rather than hitching my ability to reach
an audience through a platform that can be enshittified at the whim of a
mercurial, infantile billionaire or their venal, callous shareholders,
Pluralistic is published web-first, on a site I control, and then
syndicated to every platform that matters to me. It‚Äôs a process called
POSSE (Post Own Site, Syndicate Everywhere):
https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/13/two-decades/#hfbd I want to spread
the ideas I fight for, so I post them everywhere, and license them
Creative Commons Attribution-Only, encouraging others to repost them.
Lots of small sites do this, but so do large ones. Notably, Wired picked
up my first breakout piece on enshittification and republished it under
the CC terms:
https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-platforms-cory-doctorow/ This was a
really interesting process. On the one hand, I didn‚Äôt get paid for this
feature, which did really well for Wired. On the other hand, nearly 30
years of writing for Wired makes me doubtful that I could have gotten
this piece out in the form it emerged, without substantially toning down
(or, if you prefer, neutering) the rhetoric that made that piece more
persuasive. A commissioning editor from one of the largest newspapers in
the world got in touch with me after it came out and said they wished
they‚Äôd published it ‚Äì but also that they knew they couldn‚Äôt possibly
have done so. By publishing the story first on my blog, proving its
audience, and establishing its canonical form, I was able to get it
amplified by a service with a much bigger platform than me, without
having to compromise on the form. That republication gave me the
much-maligned ‚Äúexposure‚Äù ‚Äì but it also carried the message to places it
wouldn‚Äôt have reached on its own. I don‚Äôt write ‚Äì have never written ‚Äì
solely as an income source. As both an artist and an activist,
connecting with audiences has always been co-equal in my mind with
earning my living. That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt do a lot of film-writing: it pays
well, but most of it never sees the light of day. It‚Äôs also why I
stopped writing for ad agencies: it paid well, but it didn‚Äôt matter to
me or my audience. To mangle Dr Johnson: ‚ÄúNo man but a blockhead ever
wrote solely for money.‚Äù The open nature of this blog, with its many
open syndication channels, creates multidirectional pathways for
evaluating and refining my attempts at making my ideas understood and my
art land. My posts often circle back to points I made earlier,
incorporating useful feedback from readers and colleagues, sure, but
also anticipating and rebutting those areas where critics have convinced
others in various forums. Vanity searching is unjustly maligned: I learn
a ton about how to make by work better by lurking in Reddit comments,
Hacker News, Twitter, Slashdot, Metafilter and other forums. I also take
a sneaky pleasure in knowing that the persistent trolls who reliably pop
up to grind their weird axes about me (sometimes referencing blog posts
I made decades ago) have taught me how to neutralize them in advance,
and it‚Äôs delightful to see them try their same old lines, only to have
other commentators point out that my latest piece makes it absolutely
undeniable how wrong they are. Living well is the best revenge, indeed.
Four years. I‚Äôve been writing Pluralistic for four years. During that
time, I‚Äôve published eight books ‚Äì and beyond any doubt, Pluralistic
helped me get those books into readers‚Äô hands. But far more importantly,
during that time, I‚Äôve written nine books ‚Äì and contracted for a tenth ‚Äì
as the Memex Method paid off again and again. I don‚Äôt know how long I‚Äôll
do Pluralistic for, but I don‚Äôt foresee stopping any time soon. What‚Äôs
more, no matter what happens to Pluralistic, I can‚Äôt ever see giving up
on the Memex Method, keeping notes in public and making them work for
me. The Bezzle excerpt (Part III) (permalink) This week, I‚Äôm serializing
part of chapter 14 from my new novel The Bezzle, which is out in stores
TODAY (!!!): https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250865878/thebezzle The
Bezzle is a Martin Hench novel, the followup to last year‚Äôs Red Team
Blues ‚Äì though each book in the series is designed to be read in any
order, and to stand alone (RTB just came out in paperback):
https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250865854/redteamblues Hench is a
two-fisted, high-tech forensic accountant whose career spans 40 years of
busting high-tech scams, from the earliest days of the PC to the
white-hot center of the cryptocurrency bubble. Each book revolves around
a single, central scam (in The Bezzle, it‚Äôs the unbelievably slimy
prison-tech industry):
https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/14/minnesota-nice/#shitty-technology-adoption-curve
But each book also features lots of subplots that unpick different kinds
of fraud. In this serialized excerpt, we get to watch Marty unwind a
music royalty theft scheme, the kind of thing that Rebecca Giblin and I
pulled apart in our 2022 book, Chokepoint Capitalism (also now in
paperback!): https://chokepointcapitalism.com/ Today‚Äôs installment gets
into one of the major tactics of any semi-respectable scam ‚Äì simply
ignoring the victim in the hope that they‚Äôll get tired and go away. Any
of us who‚Äôve been ripped off by a big company can surely relate. I‚Äôm
leaving on my tour for this one tomorrow, starting with a gig in Salt
Lake City at Weller Bookworks (Feb 21) at 630PM:

From there, it‚Äôs on to LA (with Adam Conover), Seattle (with Neal
Stephenson) and many, many more cities ‚Äì maybe one near you!

And part two:
https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/19/crad-kilodney-was-an-outlier/#copyright-termination
And now, onto part three! * * * Stefon cooked Jamal another dinner and
Jamal wrote another letter, this one more forceful, and addressed to
Gounder by name. Two weeks later, Jamal wrote another letter without
needing dinner because ‚Äúthat motherfucker went to Harvard fucking
law‚Äù‚Äî¬≠Jamal had looked him up in the ALA directory‚Äî¬≠‚Äúand he knows you
can‚Äôt make legal problems go away just by ignoring them. Time for that
piece of shit to put on his big-¬≠boy pants and be a goddamned lawyer.‚Äù
The one thing Jamal wouldn‚Äôt do was file a lawsuit. ‚ÄúYou need a lawyer
for that,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI mean, I can help you with the paperwork, but a
paralegal can‚Äôt file the suit. And you shouldn‚Äôt file your own suit,
either. Those guys‚Äôll just hire some blow-dried asshole from a big law
firm and they‚Äôll crush you like a cockroach.‚Äù ‚ÄúWell, shit,‚Äù Stefon said.
But it all made sense. Anyone doing business with Chuy Flores would do
business like Chuy Flores‚Äî¬≠that is, crooked as hell. ‚ÄúWhat you need is a
contingency lawyer,‚Äù Jamal said. ‚ÄúSomeone who‚Äôll take the job for a
piece of the action.‚Äù Which is how Stefon ended up being represented by
Benny Caetani II, son of Benedetto Caetani, who graduated at the top of
his Yale class, won a string of spectacular class-¬≠action suits, then got
disbarred after someone leaked calls where he admitted moving money from
one client trust account into another to cover a shortfall. No one
seriously thought that Benedetto was stealing anyone‚Äôs money‚Äî¬≠he‚Äôd had
receivables due within a week that let him make the trust account
whole‚Äî¬≠but he was also clearly guilty. Equally, no one seriously believed
that the high-¬≠powered surveillance that led to Benedetto‚Äôs downfall was
random. Benedetto had transferred more than a hundred million dollars
from the balance sheets of America‚Äôs largest, dirtiest corporations‚Äî¬≠
poison-¬≠peddling pharma giants, toxic-¬≠waste-¬≠dumping chemical companies, a
global chain of botox parlors with some very loose syringes indeed‚Äî¬≠and
they were gunning for him. Officially, Benedetto was out of the lawyer
game. Unofficially, he was the brains behind Benny, and the two of them
ran a squeaky-¬≠clean shop, making sure that everything that an actual
lawyer had to do, Benny did‚Äî¬≠while Benedetto did ¬≠everything else. Father
and son got along well and they were a hell of a team. When Benedetto
called me in to audit Inglewood Jams‚Äô books, I jumped at the
opportunity. They were a delight to work for. ‚ÄúThey played tough,‚Äù
Benedetto said, as his minions arranged the bankers‚Äô boxes on the steel
kitchen shelves he‚Äôd had installed on the long walls of the storefront
he‚Äôd rented for me to work out of for the month. ‚ÄúAt first. Told me they
didn‚Äôt owe Stefon a dime, and that they‚Äôd rather bankrupt themselves in
court than pay some broken-¬≠down, washed-¬≠up disco king anything. Told me
his problem was with Chuy, not Inglewood Jams.‚Äù ‚ÄúWell, to be fair, that
Chuy guy sounds like a class-¬≠A piece of shit.‚Äù ‚ÄúA broke piece of shit.
Guy‚Äôs got a million-¬≠dollar nose and an empty bank account.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo you had
to go after Inglewood Jams.‚Äù Benedetto twirled around in his Aeron
chair. He‚Äôd sent over a pair of them, asking if I needed more, because
he had a storage locker full of them that he‚Äôd gotten as part of a
settlement with a broke Santa Monica crowdsourcing company that stiffed
its workers when it folded. ‚ÄúI did. I went after them. That Gounder
lawyer tried to bluff, then when that didn‚Äôt work, he tried to dodge
service. Which was such a kindergarten move. Plus he was no good at it.
Caught him outside the rub-¬≠and-¬≠tug parlor he went to every Friday after
work. Handed him the papers. Wore a bodycam. Didn‚Äôt mention his wife.
Didn‚Äôt have to.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou think he settled because he didn‚Äôt want his wife
to find out he was getting hand jobs at a massage parlor?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, he held
out awhile after that. But I could see it preying on him, every time I
was face-¬≠to-¬≠face with him. Eventually, he musta told his bosses that
they were gonna lose, and so they offered a settlement. It was trash. I
laughed in his face. He tossed out some better offers, but none of them
even in the ballpark of what we would get in court. Finally, I told him
to get serious or send his court suit out to the dry cleaner‚Äôs. That‚Äôs
when he offered to make Stefon whole and pay me a little for my trouble
on top of things.‚Äù I suppressed a snort. I was sure that a little on top
amounted to some real folding money. ‚ÄúEven then he tried to pull a fast
one, told me he‚Äôd calculate Stefon‚Äôs royalties and send a check the next
week. I was like, ‚ÄôHold up, there is no way you‚Äôre going to be able to
make an honest accounting for Stefon‚Äôs royalties in a week. The dude‚Äôs
samples are in hundreds of songs. The mere fact that you claimed that
you could come up with a fair amount in a week tells me you were
planning to pull a lowball number out of your ass and pass it off as the
audited total, so tell you what, I‚Äôm gonna get the best forensic
accountant in the state of California to come down here to LA and crawl
all over your papers, and you are going to send him everything he needs
to do it, or we‚Äôre going to court, motherfucker.‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd he agreed?‚Äù ‚ÄúHell
no. He refused. We went to a preliminary hearing. Judge turned out to be
a classic soul fan. It didn‚Äôt go well for Gounder or Inglewood. The next
day, he was back in my office, and now, well, here we are.‚Äù Hey look at

The Wall Street Journal </em>the fee would bring in close to $70 million
annually, and that the money would pay for things like fire breaks,
disaster prevention and insurance, and establishing a state fire
marshal. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a very small price to pay to preserve paradise,‚Äù Green
said. Hawaii is still recovering from the deadly Lahaina wildfires that
struck Maui last year. The tourist fee would follow a larger trend of
visitors being asked to help contribute to climate resilience efforts in
high-risk destinations across the world.

Tokyo</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-20, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;We took several trains to get to the Tsukishima District in Tokyo to meet our friend Keiko to eat monjayaki, or Tokyo-style pancakes. Monjayaki means &amp;#8220;grilled letters&amp;#8221; because school children would come to the snack shop and practice writing letters in the gooey monjayaki sauce. This dish dates back to the Meiji era, at a snack shop called Dagashiya in Tsukishima.&lt;/p&gt;

<h2 id="the-surprising-truth-about-pixels-and-accessibility">The
surprising truth about pixels and accessibility</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-20, from: OS News</p>
<p>Should web developers use pixels or ems/rems for accessible fonts?
It‚Äôs an emotionally-charged question because there are a lot of
conflicting opinions out there, and it can be overwhelming. Maybe you‚Äôve
heard that rems are better for accessibility. Or maybe you‚Äôve heard that
the problem is fixed and pixels are fine? The truth is, if you want to
build the most-accessible product possible, you need to use both pixels
and ems/rems. It‚Äôs not an either/or situation. There are circumstances
where rems are more accessible, and other circumstances where pixels are
more accessible. ‚Ü´ Joshua Comeau The linked article isn‚Äôt just an
explanation of why, but also a tutorial.</p>

sells training data to unnamed AI company ahead of IPO</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-20, from: OS News</p>
<p>On Friday, Bloomberg reported that Reddit has signed a contract
allowing an unnamed AI company to train its models on the site‚Äôs
content, according to people familiar with the matter. The move comes as
the social media platform nears the introduction of its initial public
offering (IPO), which could happen as soon as next month. Reddit
initially revealed the deal, which is reported to be worth $60 million a
year, earlier in 2024 to potential investors of an anticipated IPO,
Bloomberg said. The Bloomberg source speculates that the contract could
serve as a model for future agreements with other AI companies. ‚Ü´ Benj
Edwards at Ars Technica Properly paying for the content you‚Äôre feeding
into your ‚ÄúAI‚Äù model is a huge improvement over just taking it without
users‚Äô consent, but it does add yet another area of concern for users of
all kinds of platforms. Whatever you write, create, or post might be fed
into ‚ÄúAI‚Äù models without you ever realising it, and while the platform
you use gets paid for that, you aren‚Äôt. In any event, OSNews is not
selling your comments to an ‚ÄúAI‚Äù company, but with how old we are,
there‚Äôs no doubt both your comments and our stories have already found
their way into countless ‚ÄúAI‚Äù black holes.</p>

<h2 id="ghostbsd-24.01.1-released">GhostBSD 24.01.1 released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-20, from: OS News</p>
<p>This new release is based on FreeBSD 14.0-STABLE. Update Station got
a significant change to upgrade to a major FreeBSD version, allowing
upgrading GhostBSD from 13.2-STABLE to 14.0-STABLE. Also, a major change
to the installer is the user created is an admin, and the root user gets
the same password as the admin. If the admin password is changed after
the installation, the root password will not change. ‚Ü´ GhostBSD‚Äôs
website GhostBSD is a user-friendly, desktop-first ‚Äòdistribution‚Äô of
FreeBSD ‚Äì a project which, in my humble view, should be part of the
FreeBSD project-proper. With some old-time Linux feeling a sense of
disenfranchisement towards Linux due to things like Wayland and systemd,
FreeBSD could serve as an excellent alternative, and an official
desktop-first ISO could play a role in that. Of course, that‚Äôs not
exactly core to FreeBSD‚Äôs mission, and they really shouldn‚Äôt be
listening to idiots like me, but I think it‚Äôs an idea worth
pondering.</p>

<h2 id="global-operation-smashes-most-harmful-cyber-crime-group">Global
Operation Smashes ‚ÄòMost Harmful Cyber Crime Group‚Äô</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LONDON ‚Äî¬†An international operation led by UK and U.S. law
enforcement has severely disrupted ‚Äúthe world‚Äôs most harmful cybercrime
group‚Äù, the Russian-linked ransomware specialist LockBit, officials
announced Tuesday.¬†</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p>LockBit and its affiliates have targeted governments, major
companies, schools and hospitals, causing billions of dollars of damage
and extracting tens of millions in ransoms from victims.¬†</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p>Britain‚Äôs National Crime Agency (NCA), working with the Federal
Bureau of Investigation, Europol and agencies from nine other countries
in Operation Cronos, said it had infiltrated LockBit‚Äôs network and taken
control of its services.¬†</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe have hacked the hackers, we have taken control of their
infrastructure, seized their source code, and obtained keys that will
help victims decrypt their systems,‚Äù NCA director general Graeme Biggar
told reporters in London.¬†</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p>LockBit‚Äôs website ‚Äì selling services that allow people to organize
cyber attacks and hold data until a ransom is paid appears ‚Äì was taken
over on Monday evening.¬†</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p>A message appeared on the site stating that it was ‚Äúnow under control
of law enforcement‚Äù.¬†</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs of today LockBit is effectively redundant, LockBit has been
locked out,‚Äù Biggar said.¬†</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p>The U.S. Justice Department (DOJ) said the agencies had seized
control of ‚Äúnumerous public-facing websites used by LockBit to connect
to the organization‚Äôs infrastructure‚Äù and taken control of servers used
by LockBit administrators.¬†</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p>The NCA added that it had obtained more than 1,000 decryption keys
and will be contacting UK-based victims in the coming days and weeks to
offer support and help them recover encrypted data.¬†</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p>Biggar said the network had been behind 25 percent of all cyber
attacks in the past year.¬†</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p>LockBit has targeted over 2,000 victims and received more than $120
million in ransom payments since it formed four years ago, according to
the DOJ.¬†</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p>Those targeted have included Britain‚Äôs Royal Mail, US aircraft
manufacturer Boeing, and a Canadian children‚Äôs hospital.¬†</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p>In January 2023, US law enforcers shut down the Hive ransomware
operation which extorted some $100 million from more than 1,500 victims
worldwide.¬†</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p>Since then, LockBit has been seen as the biggest current threat.¬†</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p>Hive and LockBit are part of what cybersecurity experts call a
‚Äúransomware as a service‚Äù style, or RaaS ‚Äì a business that leases its
software and methods to others to use in extorting money.¬†</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p>Ariel Ropek, director of cyber threat intelligence at cybersecurity
firm Avertium, told AFP last year that this structure makes it possible
for criminals with minimal computer fluency to get into ransomware by
paying others for their expertise.¬†</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p>On the so-called dark web, providers of ransomware services pitch
their products openly.¬†</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p>At one end are the initial access brokers, who specialise in breaking
into corporate or institutional computer systems.¬†</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p>They then sell that access to the hacker, or ransomware
operator.¬†</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p>But the operator depends on RaaS developers like Hive or LockBit,
which have the programming skills to create the malware needed to carry
out the operation.¬†</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p>Typically, their programs ‚Äì once inserted by the ransomware operator
into a target‚Äôs IT systems ‚Äì are manipulated to freeze, via encryption,
the target‚Äôs files and data.¬†</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p>RaaS developers offer a full service to the operators, for a large
share of the ransom paid out, said Ropek.¬†</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p>When the ransomware is planted and activated, the target receives a
message telling them how much to pay to get their data unencrypted.¬†</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p>That ransom can run from thousands to millions of dollars.¬†</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the U.S. unsealed an indictment against two Russian
nationals, bringing to five the number of Russians it has charged in
connection with LockBit.¬†</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p>In a separate notice, the U.S. Treasury Department said it is
imposing sanctions on the pair, affiliates of LockBit, who ‚Äúactively
engaged‚Äù in ransomware attacks.¬†</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p>Biggar said a ‚Äúlarge concentration‚Äù of the cyber criminals are in
Russia and are Russian-speaking, but law enforcement agencies have not
seen any direct support for LockBit from the Russian state.¬†</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere is clearly some tolerance of cyber criminality within Russia,‚Äù
he added.</p>

<pre><code>        &lt;div class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;About six months ago, I finally reached a breaking point: my email-based TODO system stopped working.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
It was beyond its breaking point for a few years, actually‚Ä¶ ever since I
my average daily email volume increase from maybe 5-10 ‚Äòimportant‚Äô
emails to deal with to 50+.
</p>
<p>
My email-based TODO system used to go like this:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Email myself things I deemed important enough to do the next day
</li>
<li>
Next morning, when I checked my email, knock off the top item in that
list, and try to work down the list a bit
</li>
<li>
Anything else, forward that email again for the next day
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Once an item got maybe 5-10 <code>Fwd:</code>s in the Subject line, I
would decide whether to nix the TODO item entirely, or move it off into
a Trello board‚Äîin either case, likely to be forgotten forever.
</p>
<p>
I didn‚Äôt say the system was <em>good</em>.
</p>
<p>
But it did work, before my inbox became full of <em>actually important
stuff</em> relating to running my business.

id="wet-winter-storm-closes-airport-prompts-rescues-in-california">Wet
Winter Storm Closes Airport, Prompts Rescues in California</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SAN FRANCISCO ‚Äî¬†Another wet winter storm swamped California with
heavy rainfall on Monday, flooding the runways at a regional airport and
leading to several rescues on swollen rivers and creeks.</p>
<p>The Santa Barbara airport, on the state‚Äôs central coast, closed
Monday after as much as 25 centimeters of rain had fallen in the area by
noon, covering the runways with water and closing the airport.</p>
<p>The National Weather Service had warned that California‚Äôs central
coast was at risk of ‚Äúsignificant flooding,‚Äù with up to 12 cm of rain
predicted for many areas and isolated rain totals of 25 cm possible in
the Santa Lucia and Santa Ynez mountain ranges as the storm headed
toward greater Los Angeles.</p>
<p>The storm is expected to move through quicker than the devastating
atmospheric river that parked itself over Southern California earlier
this month, turning roads into rivers, causing hundreds of landslides
and killing at least nine people.</p>
<p>Moderate showers were reported Monday afternoon, but more rain was
expected to impact the state through the night and into Tuesday,
forecasters said.</p>
<p>The storm has led to a number of rescues, including in San Luis
Obispo County, where crews helped three people out of the rising Salinas
River in the city of Paso Robles. Firefighters were getting ready to
train on swift-water rescues when they received word that someone was
stranded on an island in the river, Paso Robles Fire and Emergency
Services Battalion Chief Scott Hallett told KSBY-TV.</p>
<p>Farther to the north, firefighters rescued two people from the top of
their vehicle, which had stalled in flood waters in Sloughhouse, a
community about 32 kilometers southeast of Sacramento, the Sacramento
Metropolitan Fire District said.</p>
<p>Hours earlier, a man was rescued along a creek in El Dorado Hills,
northeast of Sacramento. The man, who had been camping in the area, was
trapped in a tree as floodwaters rose, El Dorado Hills Deputy Fire Chief
Dave Brady told KCRA-TV.</p>
<p>Thunderstorms in valleys around the state capital on Monday could
bring ‚Äúbrief tornadoes, large amounts of small hail, heavy rain,
lightning, and gusty winds,‚Äù the weather service in Sacramento warned on
X.</p>
<p>Residents in the region, including Sacramento, Chico, Yuba City,
Stockton and Modesto, ‚Äúare advised to pay close attention to the
weather,‚Äù the office said later in a separate statement.</p>
<p>Kelly Curtis, a personal trainer in Long Beach, prepared by getting
sandbags to protect her home.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it will be as bad as the last storm, but last time I
got flooded and I kept the sandbags just in case,‚Äù she said.</p>
<p>Forecasters said the storm would be strong enough to cause problems
including flash flooding and power outages. Flood watches and warnings
were issued in coastal and mountain areas up and down the state.</p>
<p>Several feet of snow is possible at elevations above about 2,070
meters across the Sierra Nevada, the weather service said. Motorists
were urged to avoid mountain routes.</p>
<p>‚ÄúConsider completing Sierra travel during the day Sunday, or
rescheduling to later next week,‚Äù said the weather service office in
Reno, Nevada. The office issued a backcountry avalanche watch for the
greater Lake Tahoe area and the eastern Sierra in Inyo and Mono
counties.</p>
<p>The California Governor‚Äôs Office of Emergency Services activated its
operations center Saturday and positioned personnel and equipment in
areas most at risk.</p>

id="wikileaks-assange-set-to-begin-last-ditch-effort-to-stop-extradition-to-us">WikiLeaks‚Äô
Assange Set to Begin Last-ditch Effort to Stop Extradition¬†to US</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>london ‚Äî¬†WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange begins what could be his
last chance to stop his extradition from Britain to the United States on
Tuesday after more than 13 years battling the authorities in the English
courts.¬†</p>
<p>U.S. prosecutors are seeking to put Assange, 52, on trial on 18
counts relating to WikiLeaks‚Äô high-profile release of vast troves of
confidential U.S. military records and diplomatic cables.¬†</p>
<p>They argue that the leaks imperiled the lives of their agents and
that there is no excuse for his criminality. Assange‚Äôs many supporters
hail him as an anti-establishment hero and a journalist who is being
persecuted for exposing U.S. wrongdoing.¬†</p>
<p>Assange‚Äôs legal battles began in 2010, and he subsequently spent
seven years holed up in Ecuador‚Äôs embassy in London before he was
dragged out and jailed in 2019 for breaching bail conditions. He has
been held in a maximum-security jail in southeast London ever since,
even getting married there.¬†</p>
<p>Britain finally approved his extradition to the U.S. in 2022 after a
judge initially blocked it because concerns about his mental health
meant he would be at risk of suicide if deported.¬†</p>
<p>His lawyers will try to overturn that approval at a two-day hearing
in front of two judges at London‚Äôs High Court in what could be his last
chance to stop his extradition in the English courts. His wife, Stella,
last week described it as a matter of life and death.¬†</p>
<p>They will argue that Assange‚Äôs prosecution is politically motivated
and marks an impermissible attack on free speech, as the first time a
publisher has been charged under the U.S. Espionage Act.¬†</p>
<p>His supporters include Amnesty International, Reporters Without
Borders, media organizations that worked with WikiLeaks, and Australian
politicians, including Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who last week
voted in favor of a motion calling for his return to Australia.¬†</p>
<p>Pope Francis even granted his wife an audience last year.¬†</p>
<p>‚ÄòHis life is at risk‚Äô</p>
<p>If Assange wins permission in the latest case, a full appeal hearing
will be held to again consider his challenge. If he loses, his only
remaining option would be at the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR),
where he has an appeal already lodged pending the London ruling.¬†</p>
<p>Speaking last week, Stella Assange said they would apply to the ECHR
for an emergency injunction if necessary. She said her husband would not
survive if he was extradited.¬†</p>
<p>‚ÄúHis health is in decline, physically and mentally,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúHis
life is at risk every single day he stays in prison ‚Äì and if he is
extradited, he will die.‚Äù¬†</p>
<p>Assange‚Äôs brother Gabriel Shipton compared the WikiLeaks founder with
Alexey Navalny, the Russian opposition activist who died in prison
Friday while serving a 19-year sentence.¬†</p>
<p>‚ÄúI know exactly what it feels like to have a loved one unjustly
incarcerated with no hope,‚Äù he told the BBC. ‚ÄúTo have them pass away,
that‚Äôs what we live in fear of: that Julian will be lost to us, lost to
the U.S. prison system or even die in jail in the U.K.‚Äù¬†</p>
<p>WikiLeaks first came to prominence in 2010 when it published a U.S.
military video showing a 2007 attack by Apache helicopters in Baghdad
that killed a dozen people, including two Reuters news staff.¬†</p>
<p>It then released thousands of secret classified files and diplomatic
cables that laid bare often highly critical U.S. appraisals of world
leaders from Russian President Vladimir Putin to members of the Saudi
royal family.</p>

Heads to Brazil, Argentina as Lula Presides Over G20</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>state department ‚Äî¬†U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken heads to
Brazil and Argentina on Tuesday morning to hold talks and foster rapport
with the independent-minded leaders from the two countries while also
attending the Group of 20 foreign ministers‚Äô meetings in Rio de
Janeiro.</p>
<p>With Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov also expected at the G20
meetings, there‚Äôs potential for a rare face-to-face interaction between
the two.</p>
<p>Blinken‚Äôs visits to Brazil and Argentina will be his first as the top
U.S. diplomat.</p>
<p>Blinken will meet with Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva
in Brasilia and the newly inaugurated Argentine President Javier Milei
in Buenos Aires to discuss bilateral and global issues.</p>
<p>The State Department said Blinken will emphasize U.S. support for
Brazil‚Äôs G20 presidency, the U.S.-Brazil Partnership for Workers Rights,
cooperation on the clean energy transition and commemorations for the
bicentennial of diplomatic relations between the two countries.</p>
<p>Blinken also plans to discuss the Multinational Security Support
Mission in Haiti with G20 partners on the sidelines of the meetings,
addressing the Haitian people‚Äôs call for help to restore security and
stability.</p>
<p>Argentina boasts one of the largest Jewish populations in South
America. Following Milei‚Äôs recent visit to Israel, a senior U.S.
official said Blinken will engage in discussions with Milei regarding
‚Äúthe way forward between Israel and Gaza.‚Äù Other topics high on the
agenda include critical minerals and sustainable economic growth.</p>
<p>No G20 joint statement expected on Gaza, Ukraine</p>
<p>The G20, comprising 19 countries including the G7, the European Union
and the African Union, represents about 85% of global GDP, 75% of global
trade and two-thirds of the global population.</p>
<p>The G7 comprises the world‚Äôs richest and most powerful countries.</p>
<p>Last week, G7 foreign ministers expressed outrage over the detention
death of Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny and pledged unwavering
support to Ukraine as the two-year mark of Russia‚Äôs invasion
approaches.</p>
<p>The G7 foreign ministers‚Äô joint statement also advocated for
‚Äúprolonged and durable pauses in the hostilities leading to a
sustainable cease-fire‚Äù in Gaza while expressing ‚Äúdeep concern‚Äù over the
‚Äúdevastating‚Äù impact of Israel‚Äôs planned military operations in Rafah,
where more than a million civilians are taking refuge.</p>
<p>Ramin Toloui, assistant secretary of state for economic and business
affairs, said the U.S. will underscore the damage caused by the
‚ÄúKremlin‚Äôs war of aggression‚Äù and ‚Äúencourage all G20 partners to
redouble their calls for a just, peaceful and lasting end‚Äù to the war on
Ukraine.</p>
<p>But Toloui said Brazil would not ‚Äúattempt to mobilize a joint
statement‚Äù during the upcoming G20 foreign ministers‚Äô meetings.</p>
<p>Distinct foreign relations</p>
<p>Blinken‚Äôs diplomatic missions to Argentina and Brazil will navigate
the countries‚Äô distinct foreign relations concerning various countries
and issues, such as Russia, Gaza and China.</p>
<p>Lula initially assured that Russian President Vladimir Putin, who
faces an International Criminal Court arrest warrant, would not be
arrested if he attended the G20 summit in November in Brazil. However,
he later amended his stance, indicating that the decision would
ultimately be in the hands of Brazil‚Äôs judiciary.</p>
<p>During his visit to Cairo, February 14 and 15, Lula strongly
criticized Israel‚Äôs military actions in Gaza, advocating for a
‚Äúdefinitive cease-fire.‚Äù He announced Brazil‚Äôs new contribution to the
United Nations‚Äô Palestinian refugee agency, or UNRWA, and supported
Palestine‚Äôs recognition as a sovereign state with full U.N.
membership.</p>
<p>Lula wrote on the social media platform X, ‚ÄúWhile Hamas militants‚Äô
attack on October 7 against Israeli civilians is indefensible and
deserved strong condemnation from Brazil, Israel‚Äôs disproportionate and
indiscriminate response is unacceptable.‚Äù</p>
<p>In contrast, during his visit to Israel in early February, Milei, a
pro-Israel far-right leader, announced his intention to relocate
Argentina‚Äôs embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a move previously made
by only the United States and a few other countries.</p>
<p>Milei also announced his government‚Äôs intention to classify Hamas as
a terrorist organization.</p>
<p>This visit marked his first bilateral trip since his inauguration in
December.</p>
<p>Following his meeting with Blinken on Friday, Milei plans to visit
Washington and speak at the Conservative Political Action Conference, or
CPAC, on February 24, a gathering expected to be filled with supporters
of former U.S. President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>BRICS and China</p>
<p>In 2025, Brazil will lead the BRICS group (Brazil, Russia, India,
China, South Africa) of emerging nations, in which China is a key
player. During a state visit to Beijing last year, Lula called for BRICS
countries to trade in their own currencies and end the U.S. dollar‚Äôs
trade dominance. Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab
Emirates officially joined the bloc on January 1.</p>
<p>Last month, Lula held talks with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in
which the two pledged to strengthen a comprehensive strategic
partnership between the two countries.</p>
<p>In comparison, Milei has turned down an offer to join BRICS. During
his presidential campaign, he said he would freeze relations with
China.</p>
<p>Milei also chose to acquire secondhand American F-16 fighters from
Denmark, favoring them over new Chinese JF-17 fighter aircraft.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe United States is the largest source of foreign direct investment
in Brazil, and we have a robust presence of U.S. companies in Brazil, as
well as in Argentina, and we‚Äôre looking forward to deepening our
economic ties between both of them,‚Äù Brian Nichols, the assistant
secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs, told VOA in a recent
phone briefing.</p>
<p>Nichols emphasized the importance of countries trading freely while
understanding the trade-offs involved.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe United States is offering up a comprehensive and powerful
alternative to those who may not necessarily have others‚Äô best interests

Rivalry Expands to Biotech; Lawmakers Raise Alarm</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON ‚Äî¬†U.S. lawmakers are raising alarms about what they see as
America‚Äôs failure to compete with China in biotechnology, warning of the
risks to U.S. national security and commercial interests. But as the two
countries‚Äô rivalry expands into the biotech industry, some say that
shutting out Chinese companies would only hurt the U.S.</p>
<p>Biotechnology promises to revolutionize everyday life, with
scientists and researchers using it to make rapid advances in medical
treatment, genetic engineering in agriculture and novel biomaterials.
Because of its potential, it has caught the attention of both the
Chinese and U.S. governments.</p>
<p>Bills have been introduced in the House and Senate to bar ‚Äúforeign
adversary biotech companies of concern‚Äù from doing business with
federally funded medical providers. The bills name four Chinese-owned
companies.</p>
<p>The Chinese Embassy said those behind the bills have an ‚Äúideological
bias‚Äù and seek to suppress Chinese companies ‚Äúunder false pretexts.‚Äù It
demanded that Chinese companies be given ‚Äúopen, just, and
non-discriminatory treatment.‚Äù</p>
<p>The debate over biotechnology is taking place as the Biden
administration tries to stabilize the volatile U.S.-China relationship,
which has been battered by a range of issues, including a trade war, the
COVID-19 pandemic, cybersecurity and militarization in the South China
Sea.</p>
<p>Critics of the legislation warn that restrictions on Chinese
companies would impede advances that could bring a greater good.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn biotech, one cannot maintain competitiveness by walling off
others,‚Äù said Abigail Coplin, an assistant professor at Vassar College
who specializes in China‚Äôs biotech industry. She said she was worried
that U.S. policymakers would get too obsessed with the technology‚Äôs
military applications at the cost of hindering efforts to cure disease
and feed the world‚Äôs population.</p>
<p>In a letter to senators sponsoring the bill, Rachel King, chief
executive officer of the trade association Biotechnology Innovation
Organization, said the legislation would ‚Äúdo untold damage to the drug
development supply chain both for treatments currently approved and on
market as well as for development pipelines decades in the making.‚Äù</p>
<p>But supporters say the legislation is crucial to protecting U.S.
interests.</p>
<p>The National Security Commission on Emerging Biotechnology, a group
created by the U.S. Senate to review the industry, said the bill would
help secure the data of the federal government and of American citizens
and it would discourage unfair competition from Chinese companies.</p>
<p>The commission warned that advancement in biotechnology can result
not only in economic benefits but also rapid changes in military
capabilities.</p>
<p>Much is at stake, said Rep.¬†Mike Gallagher, chair of the House Select
Committee on the Chinese Communist Party. Gallagher introduced the House
version of the bill and last week led a congressional delegation to
Boston to meet with biotech executives.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just a supply chain battle or a national security battle or
an economic security battle; I would submit it‚Äôs a moral and ethical
battle,‚Äù Gallagher said. ‚ÄúJust as the sector advances at a really
astronomic pace, the country who wins the race will set the ethical
standards around how these technologies are used.‚Äù</p>
<p>He argues that the U.S. must ‚Äúset the rules of the road‚Äù and if not,
‚Äúwe‚Äôre going to live in a less free, less moral world as a result.‚Äù</p>
<p>Both the United States and China, the world‚Äôs two largest economies,
have identified biotech as a critical national interest.</p>
<p>The Biden administration has put forward a ‚Äúwhole-of-government
approach‚Äù to advance biotechnology and biomanufacturing that is
important for health, climate change, energy, food security, agriculture
and supply chain resilience.</p>
<p>The Chinese government has plans to develop a ‚Äúnational strategic
technology force‚Äù in biotech, which would be tasked with making
breakthroughs and helping China achieve ‚Äútechnological independence,‚Äù
primarily from the U.S.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBoth the Chinese government and the Americans have identified
biotech as an area important for investment, a sector that presents an
opportunity to grow their economy,‚Äù said Tom Bollyky, the Bloomberg
chair in global health at the Council on Foreign Relations. He said any
restrictive U.S. measures should be tailored to address military
concerns and concerns about genomic data security.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNaturally there‚Äôs going to be competition, but what‚Äôs challenging in
biotech is that we are talking about human health,‚Äù Bollyky said.</p>
<p>Ray Yip, who founded the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention office in China, also worries that the rivalry will slow
medical advancements.</p>
<p>The benefit of coming up with better diagnostics and therapy is
beyond any individual country, Yip said, ‚Äúand will not overshadow the
capacity or prestige of the other country.‚Äù</p>
<p>What concerns Anna Puglisi, a senior fellow at Georgetown
University‚Äôs Center for Security and Emerging Technology, is Beijing‚Äôs
lack of transparency and its unfair market practices. ‚ÄúCompetition is
one thing. Unfair competition is another thing,‚Äù she said.</p>
<p>Puglisi described BGI, a major Chinese biotech company identified in
both the House and Senate bills, as ‚Äúa national champion‚Äù that is
subsidized and given favored treatment by the state in a system that
‚Äúblurs private and public as well as civilian and military.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis system creates market distortions and undermines the global
norms of science by using researchers and academic and commercial
entities to further the goals of the state,‚Äù Puglisi said.</p>
<p>BGI, which has stressed its private ownership, offers genetic testing
kits and a popular prenatal screening test to detect Down syndrome and
other conditions. U.S. lawmakers say they are concerned such data could
end up in the hands of the Chinese government.</p>
<p>The Defense Department has listed BGI as a Chinese military company,
and the Commerce Department has blacklisted it on human rights grounds,
citing a risk that BGI technology might have contributed to
surveillance. BGI has rejected the allegations.</p>
<p>In raising its concerns about BGI, the National Security Commission
on Emerging Biotechnology says the company is required to share data
with the Chinese government, has partnered with the Chinese military,
and has received considerable Chinese state funding and support.</p>
<p>State subsidies have allowed BGI to offer genomic sequencing services
at a highly competitive price that is attractive to U.S. researchers,
according to the commission. The genomic data, once in the hands of the
Chinese government, ‚Äúrepresents a strategic asset that has privacy,
security, economic, and ethical implications,‚Äù it said.</p>
<p>BGI could not immediately be reached for comment.</p>

id="abortion-rights-could-complicate-republican-larry-hogans-us-senate-bid">Abortion
Rights Could Complicate Republican Larry Hogan‚Äôs US Senate Bid</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Annapolis, Maryland ‚Äî¬†Republicans hoping to pick up an open U.S.
Senate seat in deep blue Maryland have the most competitive candidate
they‚Äôve fielded for decades. But former Gov.¬†Larry Hogan will need more
than GOP support to overcome sustained outrage about the U.S. Supreme
Court‚Äôs decision to strike down constitutional protections for
abortion.</p>
<p>With Maryland voters set to decide whether to enshrine the right to
abortion in the state constitution in November, it may be harder for
Hogan to reassemble the bipartisan coalition that elected him to the
governor‚Äôs office in 2014 and kept him there four years later.</p>
<p>His task was laid out vividly by Lynn Johnson Langer, a Democrat
walking to lunch in downtown Annapolis several days after Hogan
announced his Senate bid. Hogan is likable enough to have won her vote
in his second campaign for governor, but the stakes are too high for her
to support handing Republicans another win in a closely divided
Senate.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe need more Democrats, so, sorry Hogan,‚Äù Langer said. ‚ÄùI don‚Äôt
think he‚Äôs a bad guy. Like I said, I don‚Äôt always agree with him. In
fact, a lot I don‚Äôt agree with him.‚Äù</p>
<p>Hogan‚Äôs decision to veto legislation to expand abortion access in
Maryland in 2022 lingers with voters like Langer. She supports abortion
rights unequivocally and said she probably will back a candidate who
doesn‚Äôt hedge.</p>
<p>Hogan has said he does not support taking abortion rights away, even
though he personally opposes abortion. However, as governor, he vetoed
legislation to end a restriction that only physicians provide abortions.
When his veto was overridden by Democrats who control the Legislature,
he used the power of his office to block funding set aside to support
training non-physicians to perform them.</p>
<p>Abortion already is protected in Maryland law, but Democrats who
control the Legislature voted last year to put a state constitutional
amendment before voters. In doing so they were following a proven
political formula used successfully by several states in the aftermath
of the Supreme Court decision.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis is an issue the Democrats care about, and this is a big thing
about Maryland: It doesn‚Äôt matter how popular you are with your base,
and it doesn‚Äôt matter how popular you are among independents, the path
to the Senate in Maryland goes through the Democratic Party,‚Äù said
Mileah Kromer, an associate professor of political science at Goucher
College, who has written a book about Hogan. ‚ÄúYou need Democratic votes
to win, and that‚Äôs just the math of the state.‚Äù</p>
<p>Hogan attracted national attention during his tenure as governor as
one of the rare Republicans willing to criticize Donald Trump, who
appointed three conservative justices that created the Supreme Court‚Äôs
conservative majority that voted to overturn Roe v. Wade in 2022. Now,
Hogan could be on the same ballot as the former president, who is
favored to win the Republican nomination but is deeply unpopular in
Maryland.</p>
<p>Mary Kfoury, a Democrat who lives in Edgewater, Maryland, praised
Hogan for speaking out against Trump, though that‚Äôs not enough to get
her vote.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI really don‚Äôt think we can afford to have a Republican,‚Äù Kfoury
said. ‚ÄúI want to keep Maryland as blue as possible, especially with
things as close as they are, but I think if we had to have a Republican
in the Senate he would be a terrific person to have, because he truly
states what he thinks and he‚Äôs for more traditional Republican values
and has bravely spoken against Trump.‚Äù</p>
<p>Hogan focused his governorship on pocketbook concerns, largely
avoiding social issues and maintaining civility with the Legislature. In
a video announcing his candidacy, he highlighted that aspect of his
tenure.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFor eight years, we proved that the toxic politics that divide our
nation need not divide our state,‚Äù Hogan said. ‚ÄúWe overcame
unprecedented challenges, cut taxes eight years in a row, balanced the
budget, and created a record surplus. And we did it all by finding
common ground for the common good.‚Äù</p>
<p>While Kromer describes Hogan‚Äôs Senate candidacy as ‚Äúan uphill
battle,‚Äù she said it would be wrong to dismiss a candidate who
consistently maintained high approval ratings during his eight years as
governor, despite the 2-1 advantage Democrats hold over Republicans in
the state.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFor me, it‚Äôs not just that Hogan was popular, it was that Hogan was
persistently popular for eight years,‚Äù said Kromer, who wrote ‚ÄúBlue
State Republican: How Larry Hogan Won Where Republicans Lose and Lessons
for a Future GOP.‚Äù</p>
<p>Democrats running to succeed retiring Sen.¬†Ben Cardin pounced on
concerns about abortion rights, after Hogan announced his surprise
Senate bid just hours before the state‚Äôs filing deadline.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe know what‚Äôs at stake in this election ‚Äî our fundamental freedoms
over our bodies,‚Äù said Angela Alsobrooks, the chief executive in Prince
George‚Äôs County, the state‚Äôs second-largest jurisdiction in the suburbs
of the nation‚Äôs capital.</p>
<p>Alsobrooks, who could make history as Maryland‚Äôs first Black U.S.
senator, is running in the Democratic primary against U.S. Rep David
Trone, the wealthy founder of Total Wine and More who has invested more
than $23 million in his own campaign.</p>
<p>Hogan, speaking publicly for the first time since announcing his
candidacy last week, told CNN on Wednesday that ‚ÄúI would not vote to
support a national abortion ban.‚Äù</p>
<p>He also said that while he understands ‚Äúwhy this is such an important
and emotional issue for women across Maryland and across the country,‚Äù
he doesn‚Äôt believe the constitutional amendment in Maryland is
necessary, because abortion rights already are protected in state
law.</p>
<p>The state approved legislation in 1991 to protect abortion rights if
the Supreme Court were to allow abortion to be restricted. Voters showed
their support for the law the following year, when 62% backed it in a
referendum.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI think Democrats put this on the ballot to try to make it a
political issue, and voters can make their decision on whether they
think it‚Äôs important or not, but it‚Äôs not going to change anything in
our state,‚Äù Hogan told CNN.</p>
<p>Alsobrooks said Hogan‚Äôs comments echoed years of Republican rhetoric
asserting that public policy on abortion had been ‚Äúsettled law.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what they told us right up until the day they overturned Roe
v. Wade and took away a 50-year precedent that had protected our
rights,‚Äù Alsobrooks said in a statement.</p>
<p>The Maryland legislation approved in 2022 to expand abortion access
was passed after supporters contended the measure was needed because the
state didn‚Äôt have enough providers. They also said the state needed to
be prepared to respond to a growing number of women coming to Maryland
for abortions after bans in other states.</p>
<p>After his veto was overridden, Hogan, who is Catholic, refused to
release $3.5 million in the state budget to help fund training. One of
Democratic Gov.¬†Wes Moore‚Äôs first actions as governor last year was to
release the money that Hogan had withheld.</p>
<p>Hogan entered a GOP primary with seven other candidates, none as well
known politically as the former governor. One of the candidates, Robin
Ficker, garnered national attention years ago as an acid-tongued sports
heckler at basketball games for Washington‚Äôs NBA team when it played in
Landover, Maryland.</p>
<p>A Republican has not won a U.S. Senate election in Maryland since
1980.</p>

Community Mourns 2 Officers, 1 Firefighter Killed at the Scene of
Domestic Call</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BURNSVILLE, Minn. ‚Äî¬†A suburban Minneapolis community was in mourning
on Monday after authorities said two police officers and a firefighter
were killed by a heavily armed man who shot at them from inside a home
that was filled with children.</p>
<p>The shooting on Sunday in a tree-lined neighborhood of Burnsville,
Minnesota, left a third officer wounded. The suspect, who officials said
had multiple guns and large amounts of ammunition, also died.</p>
<p>Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension Superintendent Drew Evans
said there was an exchange of gunfire, and authorities were still
piecing together details of what he described as a ‚Äúterrible day.‚Äù</p>
<p>The firefighter, who also works as a paramedic, was shot while
providing aid to an injured officer, Evans said. He told reporters the
paramedic was a part of a SWAT team that had been called to a domestic
situation at the home.¬†</p>
<p>Inside, an armed man had barricaded himself with his family,
including seven children ranging in age from 2 to 15, Evans said.</p>
<p>He said negotiations lasted for hours before the suspect opened fire.
He wasn‚Äôt specific on the exact amount of time, but the Minnesota Police
and Peace Officers Association said the standoff lasted four hours
before a SWAT team entered the home.</p>
<p>Evans said the suspect had several guns and large amounts of
ammunition and shot at the police officers from multiple positions
within the home, including the upper and lower floors. Evans said at
least one officer was shot inside the home.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe still don‚Äôt know the exact exchange of gunfire that occurred,‚Äù
Evans said. ‚ÄúCertainly several officers did return fire.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said that around 8 a.m. the suspect was found dead and the family
and children were released from the home. None of them were hurt.</p>
<p>City officials identified the slain officers as Paul Elmstrand and
Matthew Ruge, both 27. Adam Finseth, 40, a firefighter and paramedic for
the city since 2019, also was killed.</p>
<p>Elmstrand, a member of the department‚Äôs mobile command staff, joined
the department in 2017. Ruge was hired in 2020 and was part of the
department‚Äôs crisis negotiations team and was a physical evidence
officer.</p>
<p>Another police officer, Sgt.¬†Adam Medlicott, was injured and being
treated at a hospital with what are believed to be non-life-threatening
injuries, the city said.</p>
<p>As the bodies of the dead left a hospital, officers saluted, before
they were taken in a convoy to the medical examiner‚Äôs office. Medical
staff watched in scrubs.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôre hurting,‚Äù said Police Chief Tanya Schwartz. ‚ÄúToday, three
members of our team made the ultimate sacrifice for this community. They
are heroes.‚Äù¬†</p>
<p>Neighbors were startled awake by loud pops about an hour before
sunrise.</p>
<p>Alicia McCullum said she and her family dropped to the floor,
uncertain whether the noise was gunshots. She and her husband peered out
of their sunroom and saw squad cars and a phalanx of police
officers.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think it was a gunshot at first, but then we opened the
windows and we saw police everywhere and police hiding in our neighbors‚Äô
yards,‚Äù said McCullum, who lives two houses down from the source of the
commotion.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThen there were three more gunshots,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt was like a bunch
of fireworks.‚Äù That‚Äôs when she and her husband and two children sought
safety in a bathroom and dropped to the floor. They prayed.</p>
<p>McCullum said she was relieved to see a woman and children escorted
out of their home. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre so thankful for those police officers that
risked their lives to save those kids,‚Äù McCullum said. ‚ÄúAnd my heart
goes out to that mother.‚Äù</p>
<p>Fire Chief BJ Jungmann said the community was grieving and asked for
privacy for the families. None of the relatives of the officers or the
firefighter immediately returned phone messages from The Associated
Press seeking comment.</p>
<p>Evans said the medical examiner would identify the suspect and said
autopsies were planned for Monday. There was no indication the home had
been a source of troubles in the past.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere have not been many calls for service at all,‚Äù Evans said.</p>
<p>As the investigation unfolded, the neighborhood was ringed with
police cars to keep reporters and the public away. A police armored
vehicle had bullet damage to its windshield, and Evans confirmed it
sustained the damage in the gunfight.</p>
<p>Police scanner recordings on Broadcastify.com capture a rattled man
saying, ‚ÄúI need any ambulance,‚Äù as he struggled to catch his breath.
Someone later could be heard talking about three being loaded into
ambulances, uttering the word ‚Äúcritical.‚Äù</p>
<p>As news spread, other law enforcement agencies immediately began
posting messages of condolence on social media, including images of
badges with blue bars through them. It is a mark of solidarity in
mourning.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn times like these, it is essential to come together as a community
and support one another through the uncertainty and grief,‚Äù said Marty
Kelly, the sheriff in neighboring Goodhue County.</p>
<p>Flags also were lowered to half-staff, with Minnesota Gov.¬†Tim Walz
urging those who walked past them to take a moment and think about the
first responders who lost their lives.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMinnesota mourns with you,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe state stands ready to
assist in any way possible.‚Äù</p>
<p>Hundreds of people gathered in front of Burnsville City Hall on
Sunday night for a candlelit vigil to remember the victims. Several
uniformed officers from other departments also attended.</p>
<p>A fire truck and police car were in front of the building. The police
vehicle had bouquets of flowers on the hood and handwritten signs tucked
under the windshield wipers, one of which read: ‚ÄúWe are praying for
you.‚Äù Those gathered joined together in prayer and sang ‚ÄúAmazing
Grace.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúRight now is a time to grieve, to come together and grieve our
community‚Äôs loss, and to support the families,‚Äù said U.S. Rep.¬†Angie
Craig.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI can‚Äôt imagine the pain that you‚Äôre all going through,‚Äù Craig
continued, ‚Äúbut what I can say is that to all our officers out there,
the paramedics, our firefighters, thank you for what you do.‚Äù The crowd
applauded.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an important community,‚Äù said area resident Kris Martin, ‚Äúand
we feel very saddened by what happened.‚Äù</p>
<p>Burnsville, a city of around 64,000, is located about 15 miles (24
kilometers) south of downtown Minneapolis.</p>

Expects Trophies From Messi‚Äôs First Full Season in Major League
Soccer</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Miami, Florida ‚Äî¬†Lionel Messi and Inter Miami get the new Major
League Soccer season under way on Wednesday with pressure on the
Argentine star to deliver trophies for his club and more eyeballs on the
league.</p>
<p>The World Cup winner joined Inter from Paris Saint Germain in
mid-July, the biggest name ever to move to MLS and his signing caused a
massive spurt in interest in American soccer.</p>
<p>The eight-times and current Ballon d‚ÄôOr winner, made an instant
impact, leading Miami to the Leagues Cup title, packing stadiums and
massively increasing subscriptions to Apple TV‚Äôs MLS Season Pass
broadcast package.</p>
<p>But the excitement waned as the 36-year-old struggled to maintain his
fitness in the face of a hectic schedule and Miami were unable to
overcome their poor early season results and make the playoffs.</p>
<p>Then Inter‚Äôs decision to undertake a grueling overseas pre-season
tour backfired with Messi and the team booed in Hong Kong after the star
sat out a high-profile friendly due to injury.</p>
<p>Poor performances added to the sense that money-spinning trips to El
Salvador, Saudi Arabia and Japan had been a mis-step for a team looking
to hit the ground running this season.</p>
<p>A long and busy season awaits for Messi and his team-mates who as
well as competing in MLS, have qualified for the regional CONCACAF
Champions Cup.</p>
<p>Miami will also aim to defend their Leagues Cup title¬†‚Äî against
Mexican as well as MLS opposition¬†‚Äî and all those challenges come in a
summer which will include Argentina‚Äôs bid for the Copa America in the
USA.</p>
<p>Messi has been joined in Miami by another veteran striker in
Uruguayan Luis Suarez, making up a quartet of former Barcelona players
with midfielder Sergio Busquets and left-back Jordi Alba.</p>
<p>Coping with expectation</p>
<p>No MLS team has ever been able to draw on players of such pedigree
and experience and with that comes the expectation that they will land
the club‚Äôs first MLS title.</p>
<p>Messi is well used to such pressure but it is a new sensation for
some of the younger players in Gerardo Martino‚Äôs squad.</p>
<p>Shanyder Borgelin, the 22-year-old striker who scored in last week‚Äôs
home friendly against Argentine club Newells Old Boys, says the team can
cope with the high expectations.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs expected when you have the greatest player in the world, four
of the greatest players in the world, but I think we‚Äôre ready,‚Äù he told
the Miami Herald.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are all called up to a big task. I definitely think the
[preseason] losses and everything that comes with that made us a lot
stronger,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>Miami kick-off their campaign on Wednesday at home to Real Salt Lake
with the rest of the league getting under way on Saturday.</p>
<p>Defending champions Columbus Crew start their title defense at home
to Atlanta United with their French coach Wilfried Nancy looking to
maintain the momentum of a playoff campaign which ended in victory over
Los Angles FC.</p>
<p>LAFC, the 2022 MLS Cup winners, host Western Conference rivals the
Seattle Sounders in the biggest clash of the opening weekend.</p>
<p>LAFC have lost four regular starters from last season‚Äôs team
including Italian Giorgio Chiellini, who has retired.</p>
<p>But Steve Cherundolo‚Äôs side have added a World Cup winner of their
own with France goalkeeper Hugo Lloris joining from Tottenham
Hotspur.</p>
<p>Top-scorer Denis Bouanga remains with the club despite reports he
could head back to France but the future of the team‚Äôs talismanic
Mexican forward Carlos Vela remains unclear.</p>
<p>The 34-year-old Vela is a free agent after his contract with the club
was not yet renewed.</p>
<p>There are some new faces on the bench with former Aston Villa manager
Dean Smith taking charge at Charlotte and Phil Neville, the former
Manchester United player and ex-Inter Miami boss now at the Portland
Timbers.</p>
<p>The opening games are set to be officiated by replacement referees
after talks over a new collective deal between the refs union and the
league‚Äôs Professional Referees.</p>

mostly kept Trump off the <a href="http://scripting.com/">home page</a>

this is shaping up as a Trump year. I read today in the NYT that the
resistance

to once again, pretending Trump doesn‚Äôt exist, next year or the year
after, Murphy-willing.
</p>
<p>
The other day when I was skiing at
<a href="https://www.belleayre.com/">Belleayre</a>, I got to ride up on
a chairlift with a Trump supporter. He told me he got Covid but it
wasn‚Äôt a big deal, just like a cold. I said a lot of people died from
Covid. He said most were already sick or overweight. I said yeah but
they deserve to live too. He said he didn‚Äôt get vaccinated, he doesn‚Äôt
like to put drugs in his body. What bullshit I muttered under my breath.
I looked at him, maybe ten years younger than me. From New Jersey, a
house painter. I said that my life has been saved by drugs at least
twice, once when I was perfectly healthy other than having a ruptured
appendix at 9 years old. I also said you‚Äôre really lucky not to have
needed medical care, but before you die I bet you will. And I thought to
myself but didn‚Äôt say out loud that what about your parents and
grandparents, siblings even children? Have they all been perfectly
healthy until they died? Anyway a chairlift is not a safe place for real
anger, but ‚Äì you also can‚Äôt walk away from the other person. There‚Äôs a
lot of soul-sharing on rides like that.

Middlemen without enshittification; The Bezzle excerpt (Part II) (19 Feb
2024)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-19, from: Cory Doctorow‚Äôs blog</p>
<p>Today‚Äôs links Middlemen without enshittification: Not every author
can be a DIY author. The Bezzle excerpt (Part II): Let‚Äôs learn about
copyright termination! Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day
in history: 2004, 2009, 2014, 2019 Colophon: Recent publications,

Middlemen without enshittification (permalink) Enshittification
describes how platforms go bad, which is also how the internet goes bad,
because the internet is made of platforms, which is weird, because
platforms are intermediaries and we were promised that the internet
would disintermediate the world:
https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/30/go-nuts-meine-kerle/#ich-bin-ein-bratapfel
The internet did disintermediate a hell of a lot of intermediaries ‚Äì
that is, ‚Äúmiddlemen‚Äù ‚Äì but then it created a bunch more of these
middlemen, who coalesced into a handful of gatekeepers, or as the EU
calls them ‚ÄúVLOPs‚Äù (Very Large Online Platforms, the most EU acronym
ever). Which raises two questions: first, why did so many of us end up
flocking to these intermediaries‚Äô sites, and how did those sites end up
with so much power? To answer the first question, I want you to consider
one of my favorite authors: Crad Kilodney (RIP):
https://archive.org/details/thecradkilodneypapers When I was growing up,
Crad was a fixture on the streets of Toronto. All through the day and
late into the evening, winter or summer, Crad would stand on the street
with a sign around his neck (‚ÄúVery famous Canadian author, buy my books,
$2‚Äù or sometimes just ‚ÄúMargaret Atwood, buy my books, $2‚Äù). He wrote
these deeply weird, often very funny short stories, which he edited,
typeset, printed, bound and sold himself, one at a time, to people who
approached him on the street. I had a lot of conversations with Crad ‚Äì
as an aspiring writer, I was endlessly fascinated by him and his books.
He was funny, acerbic ‚Äì and sneaky. Crad wore a wire: he kept a hidden
tape recorder rolling in his coat and he secretly recorded conversations
with people like me, and then released a series of home-duplicated tapes
of the weirdest and funniest ones:
https://archive.org/details/on-the-street-crad-kilodney-vol-1 I love
Crad. He deserves more recognition. There‚Äôs an on-again/off-again
documentary about his life and work that I hope gets made some day:
https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/09/free-sample/#putrid-scum But ‚Äì and
this is the crucial part ‚Äì there are writers out there I want to hear
from who couldn‚Äôt do what Crad did. Maybe they can write books, but not
edit them. Or edit them, but not typeset them. Or typeset, but not
print. Or print, but not spend the rest of their lives standing on a
street-corner with a ‚ÄúPUTRID SCUM‚Äù sign around their neck. Which is
fine. That‚Äôs why we have intermediaries. I like booksellers (I was
one!). I like publishers. I like distributors. I like their salesforce,
who go forth and convince the booksellers of the world to stock books
like mine. I have ten million things I want to do before I die, and I‚Äôm
already 52, and being a sales-rep for a publisher isn‚Äôt on my bucket
list. I am so thankful that someone else wants to do this for me. That‚Äôs
why we have intermediaries, and why disintermediation always leads to
some degree of re-intermediation. There‚Äôs a lot of explicit and implicit
knowledge and specialized skill required to connect buyers and sellers,
creators and audiences, and other sides of two-sided markets. Some
producers can do some of this stuff for themselves, and a very few ‚Äì
like Crad ‚Äì can do it all, but most of us need some help, somewhere
along the way. In the excellent 2022 book Direct, Kathryn Judge lays out
a clear case for all the good that middlemen can do:
https://pluralistic.net/2022/06/12/direct-the-problem-of-middlemen/ So
why were we all so anxious for disintermediation back in the late 1990s?
Here‚Äôs a hint: it wasn‚Äôt because we hated intermediaries ‚Äì it was
because we hated powerful intermediaries. The point of an intermediary
is to serve as a conduit between producers and consumers, buyers and
sellers, audiences and creators. When an intermediary gains power over
the audience ‚Äì say, by locking them inside a walled garden ‚Äì and then
uses that lock-in to screw producers and appropriate an ever larger
share of the value going between them, that‚Äôs when intermediaries become
a problem. The problem isn‚Äôt that someone will handle ticketing for your
gig. The problem is that Ticketmaster has locked down all the ticketing,
and the venues, and the promotions, and it uses that power to gouge fans
and rip off artists:
https://pluralistic.net/2022/11/20/anything-that-cant-go-on-forever-will-eventually-stop/
The problem isn‚Äôt that there‚Äôs a well-made website that lets you shop
for goods sold by many small merchants and producers. It‚Äôs that Amazon
has cornered this market, takes $0.51 out of every dollar you spend
there, and clones and destroys any small merchant who succeeds on the
platform:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/25/greedflation/#commissar-bezos The
problem isn‚Äôt that there‚Äôs a website where you can stream most of the
music ever recorded. It‚Äôs that Spotify colludes with the Big Three
labels to rip off artists and sneaks crap you don‚Äôt want to hear into
your stream in order to collect payola:
https://pluralistic.net/2022/09/12/streaming-doesnt-pay/#stunt-publishing
The problem isn‚Äôt that there‚Äôs a website where you can buy any audiobook
you want. It‚Äôs that Amazon‚Äôs Audible locks every book to its platform
forever and steals hundreds of millions of dollars from creators:
https://pluralistic.net/2022/07/25/can-you-hear-me-now/#acx-ripoff The
problem, in other words, isn‚Äôt intermediation ‚Äì it‚Äôs power. The thing
that distinguishes a useful intermediary from an enshittified bully is
power. Intermediaries gain power when our governments stop enforcing
competition law. This lets intermediaries buy each other up and corner
markets. Once they‚Äôve formed cozy cartels, they can capture their
regulators and commit rampant labor, privacy and consumer violations
with impunity. That capture also lets them harness governments to punish
smaller players that want to free workers, creators, audiences and
customers from walled gardens. It also hands them a whip-hand over their
workers, so that any worker who refuses to aid in these nefarious plans
can be easily fired:
https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/30/go-nuts-meine-kerle/#ich-bin-ein-bratapfel
A world with intermediaries is a better world. As much as I love Crad
Kilodney‚Äôs books, I wouldn‚Äôt want to live in a world where the only
books on my shelves came from people prepared to stand on a
street-corner wearing a ‚ÄúFOUL PUS FROM DEAD DOGS‚Äù sign. The problem
isn‚Äôt intermediaries ‚Äì it‚Äôs powerful intermediaries. That‚Äôs why the
world‚Äôs surging antitrust movement is so exciting: by reinstating
competition law, we can keep intermediaries small and comparatively
weak, so that creators and audiences, drivers and riders, sellers and
buyers, and other groups seeking to connect will not find themselves
made subservient to middlemen. The Bezzle excerpt (Part II) (permalink)
Today, I‚Äôm bringing you part two of this week‚Äôs serialized excerpt from
The Bezzle, my new Martin Hench high-tech crime revenge thriller:
https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250865878/thebezzle Though most of
the scams that Hench ‚Äì a two-fisted forensic accountant specializing in
Silicon Valley skullduggery ‚Äì goes after in The Bezzle have a strong
tech component, this excerpt concerns a pre-digital scam: music royalty
theft. This is a subject that I got really deep into when researching
and writing 2022‚Äôs Chokepoint Capitalism ‚Äì a manifesto for fixing
creative labor markets: https://chokepointcapitalism.com/ My co-author
on that book is Rebecca Giblin, who also happens to be one of the
world‚Äôs leading experts in ‚Äúcopyright termination‚Äù ‚Äì the legal right of
creative workers to claw back any rights they signed over after 35
years: https://pluralistic.net/2021/09/26/take-it-back/ This was
enshrined in the 1976 Copyright Act, and has largely languished in
obscurity since then, though recent years have seen creators of all
kinds getting their rights back through termination ‚Äì the authors of The
Babysitters Club and Sweet Valley High Books, Stephen King, and George
Clinton, to name a few. The estates of the core team at Marvel Comics,
including Stan Lee, just settled a case that might have let them take
the rights to all those characters back from Disney:
https://www.thewrap.com/marvel-settles-spiderman-lawsuit-steve-ditko/
Copyright termination is a powerful tonic to the bargaining disparities
between creative workers. A creative worker who signs a bad contract at
the start of their career can ‚Äì if they choose ‚Äì tear that contract up
35 years later and demand a better one. Turning this into a plot-point
in The Bezzle is the kind of thing that I love about this series ‚Äì the
ability to take important, obscure, technical aspects of how the world
works and turn them into high-stakes technothriller storylines that
bring them to the audience they deserve. If you signed something away 35
years ago and you want to get it back, try Rights Back, an automated
termination of tranfer tool co-developed by Creative Commons and Authors
Alliance (whose advisory board I volunteer on): https://rightsback.org/
All right, onto today‚Äôs installment. Here‚Äôs part one, published on
Saturday:
https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/17/the-steve-soul-caper/#lead-singer-disease
* * * It was on one of those drives where Stefon learned about copyright
termination. It was 2011, and NPR was doing a story on the 1976
Copyright Act, passed the same year that was on the bottom of the
document Chuy forged. Under the ‚Äô76 act, artists acquired a ‚Äútermination
right‚Äù‚Äî¬≠ that is, the power to cancel any copyright assignment after
thirty-¬≠five years, even if they signed a contract promising to sign away
their rights forever and a day (or until the copyright ran out, which
was nearly the same thing). Listening to a smart, assured lady law
professor from UC Berkeley explaining how this termination thing worked,
Stefon got a wild idea. He pulled over and found a stub of a pencil and
the back of a parking-¬≠ticket envelope and wrote down the professor‚Äôs
name when it was repeated at the end of the program. The next day he
went to the Inglewood Public Library and got a reference librarian to
teach him how to look up a UC Berkeley email address and he sent an
email to the professor asking how he could terminate his copyright
assignment. He was pretty sure she wasn‚Äôt going to answer him, but she
did, in less than a day. He got the email on his son‚Äôs smartphone and
the boy helped him send a reply asking if he could call her. One thing
led to another and two weeks later, he‚Äôd filed the paperwork with the
U.S. Copyright Office, along with a check for one hundred dollars. Time
passed, and Stefon mostly forgot about his paperwork adventure with the
Copyright Office, though every now and again he‚Äôd remember, think about
that hundred dollars, and shake his head. Then, nearly a year later,
there it was, in his mailbox: a letter saying that his copyright
assignment had been canceled and his copyrights were his again. There
was also a copy of a letter that had been sent to Chuy, explaining the
same thing. Stefon knew a lawyer‚Äî¬≠well, almost a lawyer, an ex‚Äì¬≠trumpet
player who became a paralegal after one time subbing for Sly Stone‚Äôs
usual guy, and then never getting another gig that good. He invited
Jamal over for dinner and cooked his best pot roast and served it with
good whiskey and then Jamal agreed to send a letter to Inglewood Jams,
informing them that Chuy no longer controlled his copyrights and they
had to deal with him direct from now on. Stefon hand-¬≠delivered the
letter the next day, wearing his good suit for reasons he couldn‚Äôt
explain. The receptionist took it without a blink. He waited. ‚ÄúThank
you,‚Äù she said, pointedly, glancing at the door. ‚ÄúI can wait,‚Äù he said.
‚ÄúFor what?‚Äù She reminded him of his boy‚Äôs girlfriend, a sophomore a year
younger than him. Both women projected a fierce message that they were
done with everyone‚Äôs shit, especially shit from men, especially old men.
He chose his words carefully. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, honestly.‚Äù He smiled shyly.
He was a good-¬≠looking man, still. That smile had once beamed out of
televisions all over America, from the Soul Train stage. ‚ÄúBut ma‚Äôam,
begging your pardon, that letter is about my music, which you all sell
here. You sell a lot of it, and I want to talk that over with whoever is
in charge of that business.‚Äù She let down her guard by one minute
increment. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll want Mr.¬†Gounder,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not in today. Give
me your phone number, I‚Äôll have him call.‚Äù He did, but Mr.¬†Gounder
didn‚Äôt call. He called back two days later, and the day after that, and
the following Monday, and then he went back to the office. The
receptionist who reminded him of his son‚Äôs girlfriend gave him a shocked
look. ‚ÄúHello,‚Äù he said, and tried out that shy smile. ‚ÄúI wonder if I
might see that Mr.¬†Gounder.‚Äù She grew visibly uncomfortable.
‚ÄúMr.¬†Gounder isn‚Äôt in today,‚Äù she lied. ‚ÄúI see,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWill he be in
tomorrow?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe day after?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù Softer. ‚ÄúIs that
Mr.¬†Gounder of yours ever coming in?‚Äù She sighed. ‚ÄúMr.¬†Gounder doesn‚Äôt
want to speak with you, I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù The smile hadn‚Äôt worked, so he
switched to the look he used to give his bandmates when they wouldn‚Äôt
cooperate. ‚ÄúMaybe someone can tell me why?‚Äù A door behind her had been
open a crack; now it swung wide and a young man came out. He looked
Hispanic, with a sharp fade and flashy sneakers, but he didn‚Äôt talk like
a club kid or a hood rat‚Äî¬≠he sounded like a USC law student. ‚ÄúSir, if you
have a claim you‚Äôd like Mr.¬†Gounder to engage with, please have your
attorney contact him directly.‚Äù Stefon looked this kid up and down and
up, tried and failed to catch the receptionist‚Äôs eye, and said, ‚ÄúMaybe I
can talk this over with you. Are you someone in charge around here?‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôm Xavier Perez. I‚Äôm vice president for catalog development here. I
don‚Äôt deal with legal claims, though. That‚Äôs strictly Mr.¬†Gounder‚Äôs job.
Please have your attorney put your query in writing and Mr.¬†Gounder will
be in touch as soon as is ¬≠feasible.‚Äù ‚ÄúI did have a lawyer write him a
letter,‚Äù Stefon said. ‚ÄúI gave it to this young woman. Mr.¬†Gounder hasn‚Äôt
been in touch.‚Äù Perez looked at the receptionist. ‚ÄúDid you receive a
letter from this gentleman?‚Äù She nodded, still not meeting Stefon‚Äôs eye.
‚ÄúI gave it to Mr.¬†Gounder last week.‚Äù Perez grinned, showing a gold
tooth, and then, in his white, white voice, said, ‚ÄúThere you have it.
I‚Äôm sure Mr.¬†Gounder will get back in touch with your counsel soon.
Thank you for coming in today, Mr.‚Äî¬≠‚Äù ‚ÄúStefon Magner.‚Äù Stefon waited a
moment, then said, for the first time in many years, ‚ÄúI used to perform
under Steve Soul, though.‚Äù Perez nodded briskly. He‚Äôd known that. ‚ÄúNice
to meet you, Mr.¬†Magner.‚Äù Without waiting for a reply, he disappeared
back into his office. Hey look at this (permalink) The Sushi Chronicles

THE TOP FIVE

<h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Biden administration expected to ease tailpipe emissions rules
</h3>
<p>
<strong></strong>The Biden administration will scale back a proposal to
set aggressive limits on vehicle tailpipe emissions, a move seen as a
‚Äúconcession to automakers and labor unions,‚Äù <em>The New York Times
</em><a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=6198bb657c&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">reported</a>
over the weekend. Two sources confirmed the news to
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=377c73244f&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Reuters</em></a>,
as well. The Environmental Protection Agency‚Äôs original proposal, aimed
at speeding the nation‚Äôs shift to zero-emissions electric vehicles,
would have resulted in EVs making up 60% of new vehicle sales by 2030,
rising to 67% by 2032. For context, EVs accounted for just 7.6% of new
car sales last year. Carmakers and the United Auto Workers union called
the proposal unreasonable, citing high EV prices and a lack of charging
infrastructure. The new rules are expected to give manufacturers more
time to ramp up EV sales. The move ‚Äúcould be worth it‚Äù if it boosts
Biden‚Äôs re-election bid against Donald Trump, analysts told the
<em>Times</em>. But some researchers warn it will lead to faster
warming.

<h3>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Natural gas prices plummet
</h3>
<p>
<strong></strong>Natural gas prices in the U.S. are nearing their lowest
levels in 30 years thanks to a lack of demand combined with soaring
production, the <em>Financial Times</em>
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=130e96ad77&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.
The country is experiencing its warmest winter on record due to a
combination of global warming and El Ni√±o, so demand for the fuel to
help heat homes is low. Meanwhile, gas production hit a record high in
December. But some producers have signaled they plan to cut back on
drilling programs.

<em>Bloomberg</em>. Weather disasters and big climate conferences tend
to be followed by an uptick in patients, and scientists studying the
crisis are especially vulnerable. Most therapists aren‚Äôt making any
diagnoses, because ‚Äúanxiety about climate change isn‚Äôt a disorder.‚Äù
Instead they‚Äôre looking for a new playbook for treating a rising
existential threat. One interesting observation? It seems climate
anxiety and climate denial can sometimes overlap: ‚ÄúThe conspiracy
theorists are reassuring,‚Äù psychotherapist Caroline Hickman said. ‚ÄúIf
you can‚Äôt tolerate anxiety, you will then spin off into believing
somebody who gives you false promises.‚Äù

They estimate the annual cooling effect of forests to be between 1.8
degrees and 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit. On sweltering summer days, the trees
lower temperatures by up to 9 degrees Fahrenheit. ‚ÄúMoving forward, we

help cities be resilient against these very hot temperatures,‚Äù Mallory

id="presidents-day-from-george-washingtons-modest-birthdays-to-big-sales-3-day-weekends">Presidents
Day: From George Washington‚Äôs Modest Birthdays to Big Sales, 3-Day
Weekends</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NORFOLK, Va. ‚Äî¬†Like the other Founding Fathers, George Washington was
uneasy about the idea of publicly celebrating his life. He was the first
leader of a new republic ‚Äî not a tyrant.</p>
<p>And yet the nation will once again commemorate the first U.S.
president on Monday, 292 years after he was born.</p>
<p>The meaning of Presidents Day has changed dramatically, from being
mostly unremarkable and filled with work for Washington in the 1700s to
the consumerism bonanza it has become today. For some historians the
holiday has lost all discernible meaning.</p>
<p>Historian Alexis Coe, author of ‚ÄúYou Never Forget Your First: A
Biography of George of Washington,‚Äù said she thinks about Presidents Day
in much the same way as the towering monument in D.C. that bears his
name.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs supposed to be about Washington, but can you really point to
anything that looks or sounds like him?‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúJefferson and
Lincoln are presented as people with limbs and noses and words
associated with their memorials. And he‚Äôs just a giant, granite point.
He has been sanded down to have absolutely no identifiable
features.‚Äù</p>
<p>Here is a look at how things have evolved:</p>
<p>Washington‚Äôs birthdays</p>
<p>Washington was born Feb.¬†22, 1732, on Popes Creek Plantation near the
Potomac River in Virginia.</p>
<p>Technically, though, he was born Feb.¬†11 under the ancient Julian
calendar, which was still in use for the first 20 years of his life. The
Gregorian calendar, intended to more accurately mark the solar year, was
adopted in 1752, adding 11 days.</p>
<p>Either way, Washington paid little attention to his birthday
according to Mountvernon.org, the website of the organization that
manages his estate. Surviving records make no mention of observances at
Mount Vernon, while his diary shows he was often hard at work.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf he had it his way, he would be at home with his family,‚Äù Coe
said. ‚ÄúMaybe some beloved nieces and nephews [and friend] Marquis de
Lafayette would be ideal. And Martha‚Äôs recipe for an indulgent cake. But
that‚Äôs about it.‚Äù</p>
<p>Washington‚Äôs birthday was celebrated by his peers in government when
he was president ‚Äî mostly.</p>
<p>Congress voted during his first two terms to take a short
commemorative break each year, with one exception, his last birthday in
office, Coe said. By then Washington was less popular, partisanship was
rampant and many members of his original Cabinet were gone, including
Thomas Jefferson.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOne way to show their disdain for his Federalist policies was to
keep working through his birthday,‚Äù Coe said.</p>
<p>The Library of Congress does note that a French military officer, the
comte de Rochambeau, threw a ball celebrating Washington‚Äôs 50th birthday
in 1782.</p>
<p>After his death</p>
<p>Washington was very aware of his inaugural role as president and its
distinction from the British crown. He didn‚Äôt want to be honored like a
king, said Seth Bruggeman, a history professor at Temple University in
Philadelphia.</p>
<p>Still, he said, a market for Washington memorabilia sprang up almost
immediately after his death in 1799 at age 67, with people snapping up
pottery and reproductions of etchings portraying him as a divine figure
going off into heaven.</p>
<p>‚ÄúEven in that early moment, Americans kind of conflated consumerism
with patriotic memory,‚Äù said Bruggeman, whose books include ‚ÄúHere,
George Washington Was Born: Memory, Material Culture, and the Public
History of a National Monument.‚Äù</p>
<p>Making it official</p>
<p>It wasn‚Äôt until 1832, the centennial of his birth, that Congress
established a committee to arrange national ‚Äúparades, orations and
festivals,‚Äù according to the Congressional Research Service.</p>
<p>And only in 1879 was his birthday formally made into a legal holiday
for federal employees in the District of Columbia.</p>
<p>The official designation is as Washington‚Äôs Birthday, although it has
come to be known informally as Presidents Day. Arguments have been made
to honor President Lincoln as well because his birthdate falls nearby,
on Feb.¬†12.</p>
<p>A small number of states, including Illinois, observe Lincoln‚Äôs
birthday as a public holiday, according to the Library of Congress. And
some commemorate both Lincoln and Washington on Presidents Day.</p>
<p>But on the federal level, the day is still officially Washington‚Äôs
Birthday.</p>
<p>Shift to consumerism</p>
<p>By the late 1960s, Washington‚Äôs Birthday was one of nine federal
holidays that fell on specific dates on different days of the week,
according to a 2004 article in the National Archives‚Äô Prologue
magazine.</p>
<p>Congress voted to move some of those to Mondays, following concerns
that were in part about absenteeism among government workers when a
holiday fell midweek. But lawmakers also noted clear benefits to the
economy, including boosts in retail sales and travel on three-day
weekends.</p>
<p>The Uniform Monday Holiday Act took effect in 1971, moving Presidents
Day to the third Monday in February. Sales campaigns soared, historian
C.L. Arbelbide wrote in Prologue.</p>
<p>Bruggeman said Washington and the other Founding Fathers ‚Äúwould have
been deeply worried‚Äù by how the holiday became taken over by commercial
and private interests.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThey were very nervous about corporations,‚Äù Bruggeman said. ‚ÄúIt
wasn‚Äôt that they forbade them. But they saw corporations as like little
republics that potentially threatened the power of The Republic.‚Äù</p>
<p>Coe, who is also a fellow at the Washington think tank New America,
said by now the day is devoid of recognizable traditions.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no moment of reflection,‚Äù Coe said. Given today‚Äôs widespread
cynicism toward the office, she added, that sort of reflection ‚Äúwould
probably be a good idea.‚Äù</p>

possible flooding, hail, strong winds and even brief tornadoes as the
system moves south over the next few days.</p>
<p>Gusts topped 30 mph (48 kph) in Oakland and San Jose as a mild cold
front late Saturday gave way to a more powerful storm on Sunday, said
meteorologist Brayden Murdock with the National Weather Service office
in San Francisco.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe winds are here and getting stronger, and the rains will follow
quickly,‚Äù he said Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p>California‚Äôs central coast is at risk of ‚Äúsignificant flooding,‚Äù with
up to 5 inches (12 cm) of rain predicted for many areas, according to
the weather service. Isolated rain totals of 10 inches (25 cm) are
possible in the Santa Lucia and Santa Ynez mountain ranges as the storm
heads toward greater Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Thunderstorms in valleys around the state capital on Monday could
bring ‚Äúbrief tornadoes, large amounts of small hail, heavy rain,
lightning, and gusty winds,‚Äù the weather service office in Sacramento
warned on X, formerly Twitter.</p>
<p>The latest storm is expected to move through quicker than the
devastating atmospheric river that parked itself over Southern
California earlier this month, turning roads into rivers, causing
hundreds of landslides and killing at least nine people.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not the ideal setup for an atmospheric river, but it does have
some of the characteristics,‚Äù including a band of subtropical moisture
bringing up the rear of the storm, Murdock said. ‚ÄúOtherwise it‚Äôs just a
cold front.‚Äù</p>
<p>But it‚Äôs a cold front strong enough to cause problems including flash
flooding and power outages, forecasters said. Flood watches and warnings
were issued in coastal and mountain areas up and down the state.</p>
<p>Rainfall will be widespread even in the mountains, but several feet
of snow is possible at elevations above about 6,800 feet (2,070 meters)
across the Sierra Nevada, the weather service said. Motorists are urged
to avoid mountain routes.</p>
<p>‚ÄúConsider completing Sierra travel during the day Sunday, or
rescheduling to later next week,‚Äù said the weather service office in
Reno, Nevada. The office issued a backcountry avalanche watch for the
greater Lake Tahoe area and the eastern Sierra in Inyo and Mono
counties.</p>
<p>The California Governor‚Äôs Office of Emergency Services activated its
operations center Saturday and positioned personnel and equipment in
areas most at risk.</p>

to Welcome Kenyan President to the White House in May</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON ‚Äî¬†President Joe Biden plans to welcome Kenyan President
William Ruto to the White House in May, hosting a state visit after
reneging on his promise to visit Africa last year.</p>
<p>White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Friday that the
visit set for May 23 will mark the 60th anniversary of U.S.-Kenya
diplomatic relations and ‚Äúcelebrate a partnership that is delivering for
the people‚Äù of both countries while affirming ‚Äúour strategic
partnership‚Äù with Ruto‚Äôs country.</p>
<p>It ‚Äúwill strengthen our shared commitment to advance peace and
security, expand our economic ties, and stand together in defense of
democratic values,‚Äù Jean-Pierre said in a statement. ‚ÄúThe leaders will
discuss ways to bolster our cooperation in areas including
people-to-people ties, trade and investment, technological innovation,
climate and clean energy, health, and security.‚Äù</p>
<p>Word of Ruto‚Äôs visit comes after Haiti announced this week that it is
working on an official agreement with Kenyan officials to secure the
long-awaited deployment of Kenyan police forces there. High-ranking
officials from both countries recently met in the U.S. for three days to
draft a memorandum of understanding and set a deadline for the arrival
of forces in Haiti from the east African country.</p>
<p>Jean-Pierre added Friday that, beyond Kenya, Ruto‚Äôs visit to
Washington will ‚Äúfurther the vision‚Äù that ‚ÄúAfrican leadership is
essential to addressing global priorities.‚Äù</p>
<p>First lady Jill Biden traveled to Kenya last February during a
five-day, two-country tour of the continent. The White House also
confirmed that both Ruto and Kenyan first lady Rachel Ruto will be
honored with a dinner with the Bidens.</p>
<p>The White House hosted a state dinner celebrating close ally
Australia in October, which followed the president‚Äôs skipping a stop in
that country earlier in 2023 to focus on debt limit talks in Washington.
But those festivities last fall were toned down some given Israel‚Äôs
ongoing war with Hamas.</p>
<p>Biden said in December 2022 that he would visit sub-Saharan Africa
the following year, which would have made him the first U.S. president
to travel there in a decade. The president pledged at the end of a
U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit in Washington with 49 leaders, in which he
suggested the continent would be a strategic focus as the U.S. made
political and financial commitments.</p>
<p>But other priorities interceded in 2023. Biden pulled off last-minute
trips to Israel and Vietnam, as well as a secretive journey to Ukraine.
He ended last year by skipping a December U.N. climate change conference
in Dubai, while sending Vice President Kamala Harris in his place, and
never scheduled an Africa trip.</p>
<p>Biden is now seeking reelection in November‚Äôs election while juggling
a host of pressing foreign security matters, including the Israel-Hamas
war and continuing discussion in Congress over proposed foreign aid for
Ukraine amid its war with Russia.</p>
<p>On Friday he traveled to East Palestine, Ohio, making good on months
of saying he‚Äôd visit the site of a Norfolk Southern train derailment
that spilled a cocktail of hazardous chemicals and caught fire in
February 2023.</p>
<p>Vice President Kamala also spoke Friday at the Munich Security
Conference and was asked about Washington‚Äôs ‚Äúgrowing transitional
mindset‚Äù toward Africa ‚Äî a characterization she disputed, countering
that ‚Äúthe future has to be about partnership and investment.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI believe that we must think differently about the relationship
between the United States and the continent of Africa,‚Äù the vice
president said, adding, ‚ÄúWe look at the future of the continent and how
it will affect the world: It is indisputable. There will be a direct
impact.‚Äù</p>
<p>Harris noted that the median age on the African continent is 19 and
that population growth means that, in the coming decades, as many as 1
in 4 people in the world will live there.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn terms of the future, we must see the innovation that is currently
happening there and partner with African leaders and nations,‚Äù she said.
‚ÄúAnd change the way we are thinking, in a way that is not about aid, but
about partnership. Not what we do for the continent, but what we do with
the continent and its leaders.‚Äù</p>

makes so much sense. A few weeks ago, my local supermarket converted to
a ‚ÄúWoolworths Metro‚Äù store, and I had no idea what the implications of
that were, except that they stopped stocking some stuff I actually want
and need (cooking ingredients, mainly) in favour of expanding their
range of potato chips. <em>Now</em> I see why they‚Äôve done this:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
[W]hile Woolworths supermarkets are subject to a flat pricing system ‚Äî
which means all products except fresh produce are sold at the same price
wherever you are in the country ‚Äî the same does not apply to Metros.
