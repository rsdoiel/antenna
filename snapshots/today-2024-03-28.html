<h2 id="us-argentina-to-cooperate-combat-illegal-chinese-fishing">US,
Argentina to Cooperate, Combat Illegal Chinese Fishing</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Panama City — Starting next month, the U.S. Coast Guard and Argentine
Navy will begin conducting joint exercises aimed at combating illegal
Chinese fishing in the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>Argentina, Chile and Peru have criticized Chinese-operated craft for
large-scale invasive fishing in their territorial waters without
regulation, which the South American countries say is depleting fish
stock and damaging the natural biodiversity of the southwest Atlantic.
It is a key nesting area for seabirds and feeding area for marine
mammals.</p>
<p>The Coast Guard will send its destroyer, the USS James, to work with
Argentine vessels to curb these fishing practices.</p>
<p>According to data from the NGO Global Fishing Watch, nearly 3,000
deepwater fishing boats operate under the Chinese flag globally,
including about 400 in the southwest Atlantic, often targeting Argentine
squid and Patagonian toothfish. The NGO says Chinese vessel activity in
the southwest Atlantic increased from 61,727 hours per 500 square
kilometers in 2013 to 384,046 hours in 2023.</p>
<p>Since 1986, Argentine authorities have seized 80 foreign-flagged
boats fishing in their waters, including sinking Chinese and Taiwanese
ships.  </p>
<p>The upcoming joint U.S.-Argentina cruise to combat illegal,
unreported and unregulated or IUU fishing, mainly by Chinese fishing
vessels, is part of a global and ongoing effort to strengthen maritime
security partnerships. In 2020, the United States launched a new
strategy to combat IUU fishing, and the Coast Guard is spearheading that
effort. In South America, it has already stepped-up cooperation with
Ecuador, Peru, and Chile.</p>
<p>Analysts say the Coast Guard’s cooperation with Argentina — together
with recent visits from Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Central
Intelligence Agency Director William Burns — reflect a shift by
Argentine President Javier Milei’s new government, elected in November,
away from China and toward the United States.</p>
<p>“The producing provinces of Patagonia have warned about the serious
situation of illegal fishing and President Milei has a very clear
position in relation to China,” Gabriela Ippolito O’Donnell, a political
science professor at the National University of San Martín in Argentina,
told VOA Mandarin.</p>
<p>“President Milei is undoubtedly in tune with the USA, even more so if
Donald Trump wins the elections. He has already shown signs of a
180-degree turn in foreign policy in all its aspects, including the
military.”</p>
<p>O’Donnell said the decision to push back on Chinese illegal fishing
practices was more than a symbolic move.</p>
<p>“There is an epochal change in Argentina’s foreign relations,”
O’Donnell said. “Of course, the Argentine military and the political
opposition will have a voice in this process of military rapprochement
with the U.S. But the initiative today belongs to President Milei.” </p>
<p>In January, Milei authorized the U.S. military to enter Argentine
territory — a stark contrast from three years ago, when U.S. patrols in
the South Atlantic led to conflict with Argentina’s then-President
Alberto Fernandez.</p>
<p>According to Michael Paarlberg, an assistant professor of political
science at Virginia Commonwealth University, the decision is a
deliberate way for Milei to break from his rivals, his direct
predecessor Fernandez and former President Cristina Fernandez de
Kirchner, who reached several military cooperation agreements with
China.</p>
<p>“We are seeing a growing closer relationship between the U.S. and
Argentina under the new Milei government, closer than it was under the
more U.S.-skeptical Fernandez government,” Paarlberg told VOA Mandarin.
“Military cooperation with the U.S. is a way for Milei to fulfill his
promise to undo all of the policies of his predecessors.”</p>
<p>Analysts, however, say Milei’s actions do not represent a complete
break between China and Argentina, but rather an interest in
diversifying Argentina’s international relationships, with fishing in
Argentina’s territorial waters providing the country with a bargaining
chip. China remains Argentina’s largest trading partner.</p>
<p>“It is too soon to talk about a major overhaul of Argentina’s foreign
policy under Javier Milei, particularly regarding its ties with the
United States and China,” Fabricio Fonseca, an assistant professor of
diplomacy at Taiwan’s National Chengchi University, told VOA Mandarin.
“There are other geoeconomic trends and events that we need to take into
consideration before forecasting a permanent change in Buenos Aires’s
relations with Beijing.”</p>

<li>New England to shutter last remaining coal plant

<p>
<strong></strong>New England will soon follow the Pacific Northwest in
becoming a coal-free region. Granite Shore Power, which owns the
region’s last-remaining coal plant,
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=e42ca8247b&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>
it will close Merrimack Station in Bow, New Hampshire, by 2028 at the
latest. The move is voluntary, but is part of a settlement with the
Environmental Protection Agency over the facility’s excessive
particulate matter emissions. Granite Shore Power says it will transform
the plant, as well as Schiller Station in Portsmouth, New Hampshire,
into a “renewable energy park.” “The end of coal in New Hampshire, and
for the New England region as a whole, is now certain and in sight,”
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=11c11c375f&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>
a statement issued by Tom Irwin, the vice president of the Conservation
Law Foundation in New Hampshire. “Now we must vigorously push for the
phaseout of other polluting fuels like oil and gas.” New Hampshire will
be the 16th state to go coal free.

underground. The agency will award the project $50 million for the next
phase of its development, which will be matched by $51 million in
private investment. But there is a long road ahead: The project’s four
implementation phases will take several years, and members of the
surrounding community near Lake Charles (home to some of the most
contested energy projects in the country) are skeptical the project will
benefit them. Once it’s fully operational, Project Cypress is designed
to capture 1 million tons of carbon from the air per year. Louisiana
alone releases more than 200 million tons annually. “Even if we scale
this up, we’d have to scale it up orders of magnitude higher than will
ever be possible,” one Louisiana activist

When politicians tell the CEO of Radiant Nuclear that they love small
modular reactors, he groans inwardly and just keeps smiling.
</p>
<p>
Doug Bernauer’s Radiant is not trying to make SMRs. His company — a
<a href="https://a16z.com/announcement/investing-in-radiant/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">VC-backed
</a>startup currently in the
<a href="https://www.nrc.gov/reactors/new-reactors/advanced/who-were-working-with/licensing-activities/pre-application-activities/kaleidos.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pre-application
phase</a> with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission — is designing a
portable nuclear microreactor, which is intended to replace diesel
generators. The politicians don’t always know the difference, Bernauer
told me.
</p>
<p>
The SMR-microreactor confusion is common outside the world of nuclear.
While they are both versions of advanced nuclear technologies not yet
built in the United States (all of
<a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/nuclear-energy-power" target="_self">our
nuclear power comes from big, old-fashioned plants</a>), SMRs and
microreactors have different designs, power outputs, costs, financing
models, and potential use cases.
</p>
<p>
Unlike SMRs, microreactors are too small to ever become key energy
players within a full-sized grid. But they could replace fossil fuels in
some of the
<a href="https://www.psmarketresearch.com/market-analysis/us-diesel-genset-market" target="_blank">hardest
to decarbonize sectors </a>and locations in the world: mines, factories,
towns in remote locations (especially Alaska and northern Canada),
military bases, and (ironically) oil fields. For those customers, they
could also make power supply and prices more consistent, secure, and
dependable than fossil fuels, whose fluctuating prices batter

sectors</a> and
<a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2022/07/13/residents-of-rural-alaska-brace-for-heat-up-in-fuel-prices/" target="_blank">the
residents of remote towns</a> without discrimination.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps even more importantly, microreactors’ small size and
comparatively low price could make them a gateway drug for new nuclear
technologies in the U.S., helping companies and regulators build the
know-how they need to lower the risk and cost for larger projects.

</p>
<p>
The big problem with this idea? No functional commercial nuclear
microreactor actually exists. Industry experts cannot say with
confidence that they know what the technological hurdles are going to
be, how to solve them, or what it’s going to cost to address them.<br/>
</p>
<p>
“My crystal ball is broken,” John Parsons, an economist researching risk
in energy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said when I
asked him whether he believed microreactors would make it through the
technical gauntlet. “I’m hopeful. But I’m also very open-minded. I don’t
know what’s going to happen. And I really believe we need a lot of shots
on goal, and not all shots are going to go through,” he said.
</p>
<p>
Recent advances in both technology and regulation indicate that in the
next few years, we should have some answers.
</p>
<p>
Private companies are expecting to conduct their first tests in about
two years, and they are in conversations with potential customers.
Radiant is hoping to test at the Idaho National Laboratory in 2026;
Westinghouse and Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation have contracts to test
microreactors there as well. BWX Technologies is currently procuring the
parts for a demonstration reactor through the Department of Defense’s
prototype program — called Project Pele — and plans to test in about two
years; X-energy
<a href="https://x-energy.com/media/news-releases/department-of-defense-expands-x-energy-contract-for-mobile-microreactor-prototype" target="_blank">signed
an expanded contract in 2023</a> to build a prototype for Project Pele
as well. Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska is
<a href="https://www.eielson.af.mil/microreactor/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">commissioning
a pilot microreactor</a>. Schools including Pennsylvania State
University and the University of Illinois

announced their interest </a>as potential customers. Mining companies
and other industry players in Alaska regularly express interest in
embracing this technology.
</p>
<p>
The government is also quietly smoothing the way, removing barriers to
make those tests possible. On March 4, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
released a new draft of licensing rules
<a href="https://thebreakthrough.org/issues/energy/nuclear-regulatory-commission-charts-a-path-forward-on-part-53" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">that
will shape the future for these microreactors, </a>and early

emergency spending bill included more than $2.5 billion </a>repurposed
for investment in a domestic supply chain of the type of nuclear fuel
most advanced reactors will require.
</p>
<p>
“If we are truly committed as a nation to sticking to our climate goals,
then we will absolutely get to a place where there are a bunch of
microreactors replacing otherwise difficult to decarbonize sectors and
applications,” said Kathryn Huff, the head of the office of nuclear
energy at the Department of Energy.
</p>
<p>
Eric Gimon, a senior fellow at the nonprofit Energy Innovation, was a
microreactor skeptic until about a month ago. His own recent research
has made him far more optimistic that these microreactors might actually
be technologically feasible, he told me when I reached out for an honest
critique. “If they can make (the microreactors) work, it’s attractive,”
he said. “There are a lot of industrial players that are going to want
to buy them.”
</p>
<p>
“If your goal is to produce power at 4 cents per kilowatt hour, why
would you buy any power that’s way more expensive than what you need?
You do it because if that adds diversity to the portfolio and less
variance, then you can get an overall portfolio that is lower cost or a
lower risk for the same cost,” he told me.
</p>
<h3>
Understanding the differences
</h3>
<p>
Everyone I spoke to in the industry began our conversation with the same
analogy: In the world of nuclear, full-size power plants are to airports
what microreactors are to airplanes. Just as it’s easier to build and
regulate an airplane than an entire airport, in theory the microreactors
should be built in a factory, regulated and licensed in the factory, and
then rented out to or sold to the end user. An airport requires
approvals specific to the construction site, a huge team of people
employed for a long time to construct it and then another team to
maintain it, and complicated financing based on the idea that the
airport could be used for 50 or more years; a full-scale nuclear plant
is the same. An airplane can basically be ordered online; a microreactor
should be the same.
</p>
<p>
“They are sized to be similar to that kind of scope, where you could
really consolidate a lot of the chemical and manufacturing oversight to
a single location rather than moving thousands of people to a
construction site,” Huff told me.
</p>
<p>
Microreactors should produce relatively small amounts of power (a
maximum of 10-20 megawatts) and lots of heat with a tiny amount of
nuclear fuel. They are usually portable, and if they aren’t portable
they require a limited amount of construction or installation. Because
it should not be possible to handle the fuel once it leaves the factory
(most of the proposed reactor designs set the fuel deep into a dense,
inaccessible matrix), these reactors wouldn’t require the same safety
and security measures on site as a nuclear power plant. They’re easily
operated or managed by people without nuclear expertise, and their
safety design — called passive safety — should make it technically
impossible for a reactor to meltdown.
</p>
<p>
“The excess reactivity is so small that you actually can’t get the
reactor hot enough that you could start damaging the fuel. That’s
something unique about the microreactor that would not necessarily be
true for other types of nuclear,” Jeff Waksman, the program manager for
the Department of Defense’s Strategic Capabilities Office, told me.
</p>
<p>
Microreactors should also cost on the order of tens of millions of
dollars, not hundreds. That’s low enough that a company, university,
town, or other similarly-sized entity could buy one or more of them.
Because they’re cheaper than traditional nuclear, they don’t require
lenders to take big risks on money committed over a very long period of
time. If a mining company wanted to replace a diesel generator with one
of these, they should be able to finance it in exactly the same way (a
loan from the bank, for example). This makes their financial logic quite
different from SMRs, which can suffer from some of the same problems as
full-size nuclear power plants (see:
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/nuscale-small-modular-reactor-nuclear-costs-inflation" target="_self">NuScale’s
recent setbacks</a>).
</p>
<p>
“All of the things that contribute to a faster innovation cycle are true
for microreactors compared to larger reactors. So you can just — build
one,” said Rachel Slaybaugh, a partner at DCVC and a board member at
Radiant, Fervo Energy, and Fourth Power.
</p>
<h3>
The cost problem
</h3>
<p>
Because microreactors max out at around 20 megawatts of energy, the
economies of scale that eventually bring down energy prices for
full-scale nuclear power can’t be replicated. While Jigar Shah, the
director of the loan programs office at the DOE,
<a href="https://www.volts.wtf/p/nuclear-perhaps" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">speculated
in a recent interview that costs might eventually go j</a>ust below 10
cents per kilowatt hour, Parsons is skeptical that anyone could provide
a practical cost estimate. It’s absolutely going to cost more than
either large reactors or SMRs, Parsons said.
</p>
<p>
But cost comparisons to other types of nuclear technology aren’t
practical, according to Slaybaugh. “You are going to be able to command
a cost parity with diesel generators. It’s easy to get to a point where
they make financial sense,” she said. “You can see why someone would
pick one: This is not making noise, it’s not making local air pollution,
you don’t have to deal with the diesel logistics complexity. You sell it
at price parity, and maybe the first few customers pay a premium because
they are excited about it.”
</p>
<p>
That premium price for the initial technology is the largest hurdle
raised by every single person I spoke with, from the DOE to analysts and
researchers to the different microreactor companies.
</p>
<p>
But there is one customer already inclined to pay a substantial premium:
the Department of Defense. The U.S. military has greater resiliency and
security needs than other consumers when it comes to its power supply,
making the cost of microreactors more palatable. (And it doesn’t hurt
that the taxpayer already foots the bill for enormous defense contracts,
including for aircraft carriers and submarines powered by nuclear
reactors). It’s common for technological innovations (think the
internet, GPS, advanced prosthetics) to begin with the military and then
expand outward to the consumer. Project Pele and the requests for
proposals at Eielson Air Force Base both indicate that the pathway might
be one for microreactors, according to Parsons.
</p>
<p>
For the president of BWXT Advanced Technologies, the Department of
Defense’s decision to commission his company’s microreactor for Project
Pele removed his last doubts that these microreactors would eventually
be built. “The DOD being the first mover has extreme advantage for the
country, and for eventually the commercial industry,” Joseph Miller told
me. “The first mover was the barrier, and now it’s just 1,000 things

“I’ve been talking with the federal government about the fact that
there’s broader value in terms of getting wins on the board for the
nuclear sector and getting the industry more experienced with building
new things in a way that isn’t quite so complicated,” Slaybaugh said.
“Let’s have them build a thing that’s small and kind of cheap, and then
they can go build a bigger thing that’s a little more expensive and a
little more complicated. Let’s get some real reps in with
microreactors.”

latest version can be downloaded from this site. lEEt/OS is tested with
FreeDOS 1.2 and ST-DOS, but it may also work with other DOS
implementations. It can be compiled with Open Watcom compiler. 8086
binaries are also available from this site. ↫ lEEt/OS website I had
never heard of lEEt/OS before, but it looks quite interesting – and the

explained</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>Probably the most confused looks I get from other developers when I
discuss Windows and ARM64 is when I used the term “ARM64EC”.  They ask
is the same thing as ARM64?  Is it a different instruction set than
ARM64?  How can you tell if an application is or ARM64 ARM64EC? This
tutorial will answer those questions by de-mystifying and explaining the
difference between what can be called “classic ARM64” as it existed
since Windows 10, and this new “ARM64EC” which was introduced in Windows
11 in 2021. ↫ Darek Mihocka I’m not going to steal the article’s
thunder, but the short of it is that the ‘EC’ stands for ‘Emulation
Compatible’, meaning it can call unmodified x86-64 code. ARM64X,
meanwhile, is an extended version of Windows PE that allows both ARM64
and emulated x86-64 code to coexist in the same binary (which is not the
same as a fat binary, which is an either/or situation). There is a whole
lot more to this subject – and I truly mean a lot, this a monster of an
in-depth article – so be sure to head on over and read it in full.

The threat resides in the chips’ data memory-dependent prefetcher, a
hardware optimization that predicts the memory addresses of data that
running code is likely to access in the near future. By loading the
contents into the CPU cache before it’s actually needed, the DMP, as the
feature is abbreviated, reduces latency between the main memory and the
CPU, a common bottleneck in modern computing. DMPs are a relatively new
phenomenon found only in M-series chips and Intel’s 13th-generation
Raptor Lake microarchitecture, although older forms of prefetchers have
been common for years…

<h2 id="the-new-epa-car-standards-could-mean-even-more-hybrids">The New
EPA Car Standards Could Mean Even More Hybrids</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-28, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTc4NzcxOC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczOTA3ODgyNH0.wFbelT0LXIbd6Q8MNYUQ82QB9A-lu1xKSvIGti2LIq4/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Last week, the Biden administration announced its
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/epa-auto-emissions-rule" target="_self">final
car emission standards</a>, aimed at pushing the auto industry to create
more zero-emission vehicles. While there’s plenty in the
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/regulations-emissions-vehicles-and-engines/final-rule-multi-pollutant-emissions-standards-model" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">1,200-page
document</a> for policy wonks, politicians, environmental advocates, and
automakers to hem and haw over, there’s at least one thing no one seems
too bothered about: The new emissions rules stand to boost plug-in and
conventional hybrid sales, thanks in part to some small changes to how
their emissions are considered within the mix of an automaker’s fleet.
</p>
<p>
To recap: The biggest headline change from the proposed rule to the
final one is that automakers now have a
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/epa-auto-emissions-rule" target="_self">slower
ramp</a> toward reducing their fleet-wide emissions by roughly 50% come
2032. A handful of
<a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a60255477/new-federal-emissions-rules-aiming-for-more-evs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sensational</a>
<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-finalizes-crackdown-gas-cars-forcing-more-than-50-of-car-sales-to-be-electric" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">headlines</a>
notwithstanding, the new rules do <em>not</em> mandate that automakers
build and sell only EVs. The point is to reduce tailpipe emissions. How
automakers go about it is their business.
</p>
<p>
“Automakers may see it fit to introduce more hybrids and plug-in
hybrids, along with some electrics,” Thomas Boylan, regulatory director
at the
<a href="https://www.zeta2030.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Zero
Emissions Transportation Association</a>, told me. “Or if they can find
the engineering capacity to create an internal combustion engine that
doesn’t produce tailpipe emissions, that’s a viable pathway to these
standards,” he added. That said, how automakers account for the
emissions from their fleets — and specifically from hybrids and plug-in
hybrids — is not open to interpretation.
</p>
<p>
When plug-in hybrids are running on battery power, the Environmental
Protection Agency counts those as zero-emission miles. Historically, the
EPA has assumed that everyone with a PHEV plugs it in every day and is
therefore maximizing its battery-powered mileage, however more recent
studies have shown that is
<a href="https://cars.usnews.com/cars-trucks/features/phev-owners-not-plugging-in" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">probably
not actually the case</a>.
</p>
<p>
“There’s some mixed data out there in terms of how frequently people who
own these [PHEV] vehicles plug them in, and that’s a big factor in how
much compliance they should get,” Chris Harto, the senior policy analyst
for transportation and energy at
<a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Consumer
Reports</em>,</a> told me.
</p>
<p>
“How much compliance they should get” became a key question in how the
new car emissions standards would account for PHEVs. The draft rule
issued last year had proposed reducing the amount of compliance credit
automakers would get for plug-ins starting in model year 2027 to account
for the discrepancy in battery miles traveled. But the final rule
delayed that phase-in until model year 2031, in order “to provide
additional stability for the program, and to give manufacturers ample
time to transition to the new compliance calculation.”
</p>
<p>
Hybrid and PHEV vehicle sales have been surprisingly robust over the
past few years, as Jesse Jenkins pointed out on Heatmap’s
<a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-episode-3-inflation-reduction-act" target="_self">Shift
Key podcast</a>. Hybrid electric sales were about on par with battery
electric sales in 2023, at around 1.1 million vehicles each, Jenkins
said, which is “way higher than what we expected.”
</p>
<p>
As of February, plug-in and traditional hybrid sales were growing five
times faster than EV sales, Morgan Stanley
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/us-automakers-race-build-more-hybrids-ev-sales-slow-2024-03-15/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.
The
<a href="https://www.anl.gov/esia/light-duty-electric-drive-vehicles-monthly-sales-updates" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Argonne
National Laboratory</a> also found that during the same month, PHEV and
hybrid sales rose to more than 130,000 all together. To put that in
perspective, last year’s record EV sales alone averaged just about
100,000 per month across all brands. These robust sales numbers,
combined with the new EPA tailpipe emission rules, could continue to
drive growth in hybrid and PHEV sales, even as EV sales growth cools.
</p>
<p>
“I think a lot of automakers underappreciated the big bump in hybrid
sales that many people have rightly celebrated in 2023. That huge jump
in hybrid sales coincides directly with a huge jump in EPA emission
standards from 2022 to 2023,” Harto told me. In 2021, the Biden
administration
<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2021-12-30/pdf/2021-27854.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">revised</a>
a Trump-era rule that sought to weaken vehicle emission standards. Those
revised rules, which took effect for the 2023 model year, were 10%
tighter than the year prior.
</p>
<p>
“These standards have a history of pushing automakers to deliver
vehicles that save consumers money on fuel,” Harto said. “I don’t think
we would have seen the jump in hybrid sales that we saw last year
without the jump in emission standards in 2023.”
</p>
<p>
Still, he noted, “The more hybrids (or other gasoline efficiency
improvements) and PHEVs automakers build, the fewer BEVs they will have
to build to comply.”
</p>
<p>
This will likely slow the EV adoption curve, but if it leads to more and
cheaper plug-in hybrids than we would have had otherwise, it could help
U.S. consumers get more comfortable with the idea of plugging in rather
than filling up their cars.
</p>
<p>
“I think the final rule reflects more of an understanding that there
will be more hybrid electric vehicle penetration rates over the next few
years,” Boylan told me. While the true cost and emissions savings are in
fully battery electric vehicles, it might take consumers a minute to get
there. “I think, ultimately, a PHEV offers an opportunity to educate a
consumer on what an electric vehicle might be able to do to meet their
personal needs, and that creates a pathway to a true BEV purchase, on
the next vehicle.”

What you see above is the remains of a hot dog after it has been applied
to an AM radio tower operating in its daytime pattern, at around 6 kW.
</p>
<p>
A couple months ago, soon after we posted our
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aax-ehkRTnQ">If I touch this
tower, I die</a> video, a few commenters mentioned you likely wouldn’t
<em>die</em> after touching a high-power AM tower—rather, you’d have
serious RF burns.
</p>
<p>
I was trying to figure out a way to <em>somewhat</em> safely test the
scenario: what would happen if someone walked up and touched the tower,
while standing on the ground?

<p>date: 2024-03-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Wednesday that
Chinese subsidies for clean energy industries create unfair competition
that “hurts American firms and workers, as well as firms and workers
around the world.”</p>
<p>Yellen said that during a visit she has scheduled to China, she
intends to warn China its national underwriting for energy and other
companies is creating oversupply and market distortion, among other
problems.</p>
<p>“I intend to talk to the Chinese when I visit about overcapacity in
some of these industries, and make sure that they understand the
undesirable impact that this is having — flooding the market with cheap
goods — on the United States, but also in many of our closest allies,”
Yellen said in a speech in Norcross, Georgia.</p>
<p>Yellen said she believes those subsidies will enable China to flood
the markets for solar panels, electric vehicle parts and lithium-ion
batteries, thus distorting production in other economies and global
prices.</p>
<p>“I will convey my belief that excess capacity poses risks not only to
American workers and firms and to the global economy, but also
productivity and growth in the Chinese economy, as China itself
acknowledged in its National People’s Congress this month,” Yellen said.
“And I will press my Chinese counterparts to take necessary steps to
address this issue.”</p>
<p>Yellen is set for meetings in China in April, according to Politico.
The Treasury has not yet confirmed her itinerary.</p>
<p>The secretary visited Georgia to see a newly reopened solar cell
manufacturing plant, which according to the Treasury closed in 2017
because of competition from factories in China. It is reopening now,
though, after tax credits in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act fueled
increased anticipated demand for solar panels.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, China filed a complaint against the U.S. at the World
Trade Organization, arguing the U.S.’s requirements for electric vehicle
subsidies are discriminatory. Chinese officials did not comment on what
prompted the decision.</p>
<p>Yellen said she hopes to have a “constructive” dialogue with Chinese
officials about subsidies and oversupply issues. She said outreach to
businesspeople and governments around the world had prompted her to
issue this warning.</p>
<p>“These are concerns that I increasingly hear from government
counterparts in industrialized countries and emerging markets, as well
as from the business community globally,” Yellen said.</p>

Press.</p>

Spencer wants Epic Games Store and others on Xbox consoles</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-27, from: OS News</p>
<p>In an interview with Microsoft’s CEO of Gaming during the annual Game
Developers Conference, Spencer told Polygon about the ways he’d like to
break down the walled gardens that have historically limited players to
making purchases through the first-party stores tied to each console.
Or, in layperson terms, why you should be able to buy games from other
stores on Xbox — not just the official storefront. Spencer mentioned his
frustrations with closed ecosystems, so we asked for clarity. Could he
really see a future where stores like Itch.io and Epic Games Store
existed on Xbox? Was it just a matter of figuring out mountains of
paperwork to get there? ↫ Chris Plante at Polygon The answer is yes,
Spencer claims. I don’t know how realistic any of this is, but to me it
makes perfect sense, and the gaming world has been moving towards it for
a while now. At the moment, I’m doing something thought unthinkable
until very recently: I’m playing a major Sony PlayStation exclusive,
Horizon: Forbidden West, on PC, through Steam on Linux. Sony has been
making its major exclusives available on Steam in recent years, and
while seeing these games on Xbox might be a bit too much to ask, I
wouldn’t be surprised to see storefronts from companies who don’t make
game consoles pop up on the Xbox and PlayStation. Games have become so
expensive to make that limiting them to a single console just doesn’t
make any commercial sense. Why limit your audience?</p>

Seeks Engagement With North Korea Amid Heightened Tensions</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The Biden administration has been making a diplomatic
push for talks with North Korea with more explicit public proposals for
engagement than at any other time since taking office.</p>
<p>“We want dialogue, and there are lots of valuable discussions” that
could be had with the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, or DPRK,
said Jung Pak, the U.S. senior official for North Korea.</p>
<p>Those items for discussion could include sanctions, humanitarian
cooperation and confidence-building measures, Pak said at a March 18
event hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies
(CSIS) in Washington.</p>
<p>She added that the U.S. wants North Korea to take risk-reduction
steps to avoid miscalculation and inadvertent escalation. The U.S. also
wants to see Pyongyang take interim steps toward denuclearization, Pak
said at another event held by the Carnegie Endowment for International
Peace on March 5.</p>
<p>Joseph DeTrani, who served as the special envoy for six-party
denuclearization talks with North Korea from 2003 to 2006 during the
George W. Bush administration, told VOA via email on Friday that the
Biden administration is making this approach now as opposed to earlier
in its term because “tension on the Korean Peninsula has increased
exponentially, and all efforts must be made to stop this escalation and
defuse this tension.”</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the year, Pyongyang has repeatedly called
Seoul its “primary foe” and denounced unification while rallying North
Korea to prepare to occupy South Korea if a war breaks out.</p>
<p>North Korea has launched multiple rockets and cruise missiles and
conducted several artillery firing drills this year.  In its latest test
on March 18, North Korea conducted a drill involving “newly equipped
super-large multiple rocket launchers” that could cause “disastrous
consequences” if a war breaks out, its state-run KCNA news agency
said. </p>
<p>Since its term began in 2021, the Biden administration has said it is
open to denuclearization talks with North Korea without preconditions.
But it has been silent on what it would offer Pyongyang or how it thinks
denuclearization should proceed, although it has hinted at incremental
steps toward that goal.</p>
<p>After completing a monthslong policy review on North Korea in April
2021, then-White House spokesperson Jen Psaki said the Biden
administration sought a middle ground between “a grand bargain” and
“strategic patience.”</p>
<p>Former President Donald Trump sought to strike “a grand bargain” with
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.</p>
<p>Trump’s predecessor, former President Barack Obama, pursued a policy
approach dubbed “strategic patience,” which involved waiting to engage
Pyongyang until it reduced tensions.</p>
<p>In an interview with VOA on March 18, Pak said, “Our policy is the
same since we rolled out our policy review back in the spring of 2021,
which is that we are absolutely looking for the complete
denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.”</p>
<p>She continued, “When we talk about ‘interim steps,’ we’re making
explicit what has always been implicit, which is a complete
denuclearization will not occur overnight.”</p>
<p>Bruce Klingner, senior research fellow for Northeast Asia at the
Heritage Foundation, told VOA in a telephone interview on Monday that
“perhaps it was almost frustration” that prompted the Biden
administration to make its approach to North Korea more explicit and
public now.</p>
<p>U.S. officials “have tried many channels, including through third
countries, trying to get messages to the North Koreans and indicating
they’re willing to talk not only about denuclearization but about other
nonnuclear issues, including risk reduction or confidence-building
measures [and] humanitarian assistance,” Klingner said.</p>
<p>Mira Rapp-Hooper, special assistant to the president and senior
director for East Asia and Oceania at the White House National Security
Council, said at a CSIS-hosted virtual event on March 3 that North Korea
“has not answered” multiple U.S. calls for dialogue made through “many
channels.”</p>
<p>She continued, “This is increasingly problematic, of course, because
we now see the DPRK taking increasingly escalatory behavior.”</p>
<p>Robert Rapson, who served as charge d’affaires and deputy chief of
mission at the U.S. Embassy in Seoul from 2018 to 2021, said, “I was
struck by the continued priority given ‘risk reduction’ as an initial
discussion topic, which reflects, in my view, growing U.S. concerns
about the escalatory situation on the Korean Peninsula.”</p>
<p>While North Korea increased missile launches and verbal hostilities
toward South Korea, it has been making weapons shipments to Russia in
defiance of international sanctions.</p>
<p>South Korean Defense Minister Shin Won-sik said at a press briefing
on March 18 that Pyongyang has shipped about 7,000 containers of weapons
to Russia since last year.</p>
<p>DeTrani said that is “all the more reason why we should be open and
creative in getting North Korea back to negotiations.”</p>
<p>VOA State Department Bureau Chief Nike Ching contributed to this
report.</p>

<h2 id="jill-biden-to-publish-childrens-book-about-white-house-cat">Jill
Biden to Publish Children’s Book About White House Cat</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — First lady Jill Biden will publish a children’s book in
June called Willow the White House Cat — about her cat, Willow.</p>
<p>The publisher, Simon &amp; Schuster, announced Wednesday that the
book tells the story of Willow’s journey to the White House.</p>
<p>The short-haired tabby cat entered the Bidens’ life after she jumped
on stage as the first lady was speaking at a Pennsylvania farm during
President Joe Biden’s 2020 presidential campaign. Soon after, Jill Biden
adopted the cat and named it after her hometown, Willow Grove,
Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>“As Willow bounds from room to room, exploring history in her new
home, she learns quickly about all of the incredible people who make the
‘People’s House’ run,” the first lady said in the publisher’s
announcement.</p>
<p>“They welcomed Willow with love and care, just as they did Joe and
me, the First Families who came before us, and all of the people who
step foot into this home.”</p>
<p>The Bidens began their White House tenancy with Willow and several
German shepherd dogs. However, one dog, Champ, died in 2021, and two
others, Major and Commander, were sent away for aggressive behavior
after biting security personnel and White House staff.</p>
<p>This makes 4-year-old Willow the only presidential pet currently
residing at the White House.</p>
<p>Presidential pets have long been a source of public fascination.
Willow now meows among the ranks of fellow famous felines such as
President Bill Clinton’s black and white cat named Socks, who became
iconic for her photo ops on the White House lawn.</p>
<p>Socks had her own book, written by then-first lady Hillary Clinton,
called Dear Socks, Dear Buddy, which included fan mail address to Socks
and her canine companion Buddy the chocolate labrador retriever.</p>
<p>First lady Barbara Bush also wrote a book about the family pet.
Millie’s Book: As Dictated to Barbara Bush is a dog’s-eye view of the
White House during the George H.W. Bush administration.</p>
<p>First lady Biden has previously written several children’s books,
including Don’t Forget, God Bless Our Troops and Joey: The Story of Joe
Biden. She published her memoir, “Where the Light Enters,” in 2019.</p>
<p>Proceeds from book sales will be given to charities that support
military dogs.</p>

Is Officially Getting a Direct Air Capture Hub</h2>

<p class="drop-caps">
The Department of Energy is giving the green light to Project Cypress, a
cluster of facilities in southwest Louisiana that will filter carbon
dioxide directly from the air and store it underground. The agency
announced Wednesday that it will award the project $50 million for the
next phase of its development, which will be matched by $51 million in
private investment.
</p>
<p>
Before receiving any money, the Project Cypress team had to reach an
agreement with the DOE regarding how they would engage with community
and labor stakeholders. The result, also released Wednesday, was a
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2024-03/Project%20Cypress%20Community%20Benefits%20V2.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">series
of commitments</a> — for example, to assemble a community advisory
board, to partner with local workforce development organizations, and to
create a public website with project information.
</p>
<p>
The developers have yet to provide a list of more concrete, measurable
benefits the project will bring to the community. This was more like a
plan to make a plan that will have robust community input. That the
project sits near Lake Charles, home to some of the most contested
energy projects in the country, will not make the next steps easy,
however.
</p>
<p>
The funding is part of a $3.5 billion program authorized by Congress in
the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to create four such “direct air
capture hubs” around the country in an effort
to<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/carbon-dioxide-removal-industry-biden" target="_self">
help commercialize the nascent technology</a>. This is the first award
the DOE has handed out after selecting Project Cypress last August as
one of two hubs it would consider supporting. A second hub under
development by Occidental Petroleum in South Texas is still in
negotiations with the agency and has yet to receive funding.
</p>
<p>
Once it’s fully operational, Project Cypress is designed to capture 1
million tons of carbon from the air per year, employing two different
technological approaches to do so.
</p>
<p>
The first, developed by the Swiss startup Climeworks, uses fans to draw
air into metal boxes containing a material called a sorbent that
attracts carbon dioxide molecules. Then it heats the sorbent, which
releases the CO2 so that it can be stored.
</p>
<p>
The second approach, pioneered by a California-based company called
Heirloom, involves crushing and cooking limestone so that it becomes
calcium oxide, a white powder that’s thirsty for CO2. Heirloom lays the
powder out on trays, where it binds with carbon dioxide in the air. Then
it bakes the powder in an electric kiln to remove the CO2.
</p>
<p>
Both companies say they will use renewable energy to power their
respective processes. To lock the carbon away underground, they are
partnering with a company called Gulf Coast Sequestration which has
applied for permits to drill two CO2 storage wells on a vast,
privately-owned cattle and horse ranch in West Calcasieu Parish. After
the carbon is captured, it will be liquified and delivered by pipeline
to a well, where it will be injected into porous sandstone about 10,000
feet below the Earth’s surface.
</p>
<p>
With this award, the project will enter the second of
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2023-12/Engagement%20Roadmaps_DACHubs.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">four
implementation phases</a>, during which the companies will finalize the
project’s design, engage with area residents and stakeholders to
complete a community benefits plan, and start on the permitting process.
</p>
<p>
Phase two will not be quick — it’s expected to last two to three years.
Then the companies will begin negotiating with the DOE for funding for
phases three — construction — and four — the ramp-up to full-scale
operation. The DOE has structured the DAC Hubs program with off-ramps at
the start of each phase, allowing the agency to deny additional funding
to a project if it finds that it is not meeting previously agreed-upon
objectives. But if all goes well, Project Cypress is eligible for up to
$600 million.
</p>
<p>
The Carbon Removal Alliance, a group that lobbies for policies to
support what it calls
“<a href="https://grist.org/technology/a-new-alliance-for-high-quality-carbon-removal-highlights-tensions-within-the-industry/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">high
quality carbon removal</a>,” sees this award as a “fresh start” for the
Department of Energy in that it shows the agency moving beyond its
traditional role of funding research and development to commercializing
technologies.
</p>
<p>
“With official funding beginning to flow into states like Louisiana and
backed by robust community benefits plans to ensure the highest
standards, we’re about to see how technologies like direct air capture
can provide positive benefits to our economies and environment,” said
Giana Amador, the executive director of the Carbon Removal Alliance.
</p>
<p>
Members of the community, however, are skeptical that the project will
benefit them.
</p>
<p>
The industrial history of Calcasieu Parish is both an asset and a curse
for Project Cypress. The area is home to a high concentration of
refineries, petrochemical plants, and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/lng-front-line-communities-louisiana" target="_self">liquified
natural gas terminals</a>. The developers chose the location because it
had a local workforce with relevant skills and the right geology to trap
carbon underground, but the residents’ trust will be hard-won after
decades of living in one of the most polluted corridors in the country,
where news of toxic
<a href="https://www.klfy.com/louisiana/shelter-in-place-ordered-after-chemical-spill-near-i-10-bridge-in-calcasieu-parish/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">spills</a>
and
<a href="https://lailluminator.com/2023/03/29/chlorine-leak-reveals-gaps-in-lake-charles-areas-alert-system/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">leaks</a>
is common. Many residents have spent the last few years furiously
fighting the buildout of several new LNG plants that are expected to
increase pollution even more.
</p>
<p>
One of those activists is James Hiatt, a former refinery worker based in
Sulphur, Louisiana. About a year ago, Hiatt founded a group called For A
Better Bayou because he wanted to build a grassroots movement to
reimagine the future of Louisiana — to be <em>for</em> something, not
just against heavy industry.
</p>
<p>
“I want people to really imagine and embrace an alternative future for
ourselves,” he told me. But to him, direct air capture is not it. “I
wish I was so sold on it, like this is the way forward and I could get
behind it and we could be like oh yeah, let’s do this,” he told me. “But
it just does not add up for me.”
</p>
<p>
When the project developers and the DOE held a meeting for stakeholders
last November, Hiatt said, even attendees who worked in the oil and gas
and petrochemical industries expressed doubts about the plan.
</p>
<p>
Hiatt shared a few videos from the meeting with me. One speaker
questioned whether the jobs created would truly go to people from the
area. This is not the first time a company has come in promising jobs
and economic growth, only to hire workers from Alabama or Texas. Another
speaker called the idea of a community benefits plan a way to “distract
the community” from the risks of the project, which the companies have
yet to define. (A preliminary list published Wednesday included things
like increased traffic and noise during construction, risk of leakage
during the transport or storage of the CO2, and energy and water use.)
Others implored the companies not to seek property tax breaks, which
divert revenue away from schools and social services.
</p>
<p>
When Project Cypress was first announced, the developers said it would
create “approximately 2,300 quality jobs and generate a billion-dollar
economic stimulus in the region, with increased opportunities for local
contractors, suppliers, and small businesses.” The project also has a
stated goal of hiring at least 10% of its workforce from the local
fossil fuel and plastics industries.
</p>
<p>
But beyond that, its intentions are vague. The list of commitments
published on Wednesday included lots of plans — i.e., a plan to create a
“Site Labor and Workforce Development plan” which will “describe plans
to provide equal access to jobs for local residents for construction and
operations” — but few concrete actions or outcomes, yet.
</p>
<p>
Hiatt is especially skeptical that the carbon will stay underground and
is worried about leaks. But perhaps more than that, the math of it all
doesn’t make sense to him. Project Cypress might capture a million tons
of CO2 from the air per year, but Louisiana alone releases more than 200
million tons annually, and is still approving new emissions-intensive
facilities like those LNG plants. “Even if we scale this up, we’d have
to scale it up orders of magnitude higher than will ever be possible,”
he told me. “It doesn’t seem like it’s worth the time or the money to be
doing this when we should be reducing the emissions to start with.”
</p>
<p>
There are many hurdles to scaling up direct air capture, but this
cognitive dissonance is one of the trickiest. Ultimately, the goal of
the project is not to offset Louisiana’s emissions. It’s to demonstrate
a technology that could eventually, if we develop the right incentives
to support it, clean up carbon that’s already in the atmosphere. But
believing in that vision demands that people also see a world where
emissions will start to decline — one that’s perhaps not yet apparent in
Lake Charles.

<h1 id="2024-03-27-convert-text-file-to-pdf">
2024-03-27 Convert text file to PDF
</h1>
<p>
I just couldn’t find a good way to turn a text file into a PDF. Within
Emacs, <code>ps-print-buffer</code> is hard to configure and my two
specific problems were the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
everything is turned into Latin-1 so I cannot use the EN dash;
</li>
<li>
the line length was set too short so that I couldn’t print lines longer
than 80 characters even though there was plenty of space left.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I wasted some time trying to write something in Bash, turned to Perl and
wasted some more time trying to figure out why the encodings were all
wrong except when the encodings were OK but Perl gave me a warning for
every multi-byte character. So frustrating.
</p>
<p>
The solution ended up not being decoding and encoding the bytes in the
Perl script but to use the <code>–encoding</code> option for
<code>weasyprint</code>. In this case, it wasn’t Perl’s fault, it was my
fear of Perl’s encoding issues that led my down endless variations of
<code>binmode</code>, <code>:utf8</code>, <code>decode_utf8</code> and
<code>encode_utf8</code>. But I think I have it, now.
</p>
<p>
But this is what I ended up with:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
use <code>weasyprint</code>;
</li>
<li>
wrap it all in a <code>pre</code> tag.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I created a script called <code>to-pdf</code> with the following:
</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env perl
use Modern::Perl;
use File::Basename;

if (@ARGV == 0) {
  die &quot;Usage: to-pdf file.txt ...\n&quot;;
}

for (@ARGV) {
  open(my $text, &quot;&lt;&quot;, $_) or die &quot;Cannot read $_\n&quot;;
  my ($name, $path, $suffix) = fileparse($_, &quot;.txt&quot;);
  open(my $html, &quot;|-&quot;) || exec &quot;weasyprint&quot;, &quot;--encoding&quot;, &quot;utf-8&quot;, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;$path$name.pdf&quot;;

  print $html &lt;&lt;'BEG';
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;pre style=&quot;font-family: Iosevka; font-size: 10pt&quot;&gt;
BEG

  for (&lt;$text&gt;) { print $html $_ }; # copy text

  print $html &lt;&lt;'END';
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
END
}

id="former-senator-joe-lieberman-democrats-vp-pick-in-2000-dead-at-82">Former
Senator Joe Lieberman, Democrats’ VP Pick in 2000, Dead at 82</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>new york — Former U.S. Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, who nearly
won the vice presidency on the Democratic ticket with Al Gore in the
disputed 2000 election and who almost became Republican John McCain’s
running mate eight years later, has died, according to a statement
issued by his family.</p>
<p>Lieberman died in New York City on Wednesday because of complications
from a fall, the statement said. He was 82.</p>
<p>The Democrat-turned-independent was never shy about veering from the
party line.</p>
<p>Lieberman’s independent streak and especially his needling of
Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama during the 2008
presidential contest rankled many Democrats, the party he aligned with
in the Senate. Yet his support for gay rights, civil rights, abortion
rights and environmental causes at times won him the praise of many
liberals over the years.</p>
<p>Lieberman came tantalizingly close to winning the vice presidency in
the contentious 2000 presidential contest that was decided by a 537-vote
margin victory for George W. Bush in Florida after a drawn-out recount,
legal challenges and a Supreme Court decision. He was the first Jewish
candidate on a major party’s presidential ticket and would have been the
first Jewish vice president.</p>
<p>He was also the first national Democrat to publicly criticize
President Bill Clinton for his extramarital affair with a White House
intern.</p>
<p>Lieberman sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 2004 but
dropped out after a weak showing in the early primaries. Four years
later, he was an independent who was nearly chosen to be McCain’s
running mate. He and McCain were close friends who shared hawkish views
on military and national security matters.</p>
<p>McCain was leaning strongly toward choosing Lieberman for the ticket
as the 2008 GOP convention neared, but he chose Sarah Palin at the last
minute after “ferocious” blowback from conservatives over Lieberman’s
liberal record, according to Steve Schmidt, who managed McCain’s
campaign.</p>
<p>Lieberman generated controversy in 1998 when he scolded Clinton, his
friend of many years, for “disgraceful behavior” in an explosive speech
on the Senate floor during the height of the scandal over his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky. Yet Lieberman later voted against the
impeachment of Clinton.</p>
<p>He defended his partisan switches as a matter of conscience, saying
he always had the best interests of Connecticut voters at heart. Critics
accused him of pursuing narrow self-interest and political
expediency.</p>
<p>In announcing his retirement from the Senate in 2013, Lieberman
acknowledged that he did “not always fit comfortably into conventional
political boxes” and felt his first responsibility was to serve his
constituents, state and country, not his political party.</p>
<p>During his final Senate speech, Lieberman urged Congress to look
beyond party lines and partisan rancor to break Washington gridlock.</p>
<p>“It requires reaching across the aisle and finding partners from the
opposite party,” said Lieberman. “That is what is desperately needed in
Washington now.”</p>
<p>Harry Reid, who served as Senate Democratic leader, once said that
while he didn’t always agree with the independent-minded Lieberman, he
respected him.</p>
<p>“Regardless of our differences, I have never doubted Joe Lieberman’s
principles or his patriotism,” Reid said. “And I respect his independent
streak, as it stems from strong convictions.”</p>
<p>Privately, some Democrats were often less charitable about
Lieberman’s forays across party lines, which they saw as disloyal. He
left his party and turned independent after a 2006 Senate primary loss
in Connecticut.</p>
<p>Lieberman’s strong support of the Iraq War hurt his statewide
popularity. Democrats rejected Lieberman and handed the 2006 primary to
a political newcomer and an anti-war candidate, Ned Lamont.</p>
<p>Defying Democratic leaders and friends, Lieberman ran successfully
for reelection as an independent and drew support from some Republican
allies.</p>
<p>After his rebound reelection in 2006, Lieberman decided to caucus
with Democrats in the Senate, who let him head a committee in return
because they needed his vote to help keep control of the closely divided
chamber.</p>
<p>Despite the decision of Democrats to let him join their caucus as an
independent, Lieberman was an enthusiastic backer of McCain in the 2008
presidential contest.</p>
<p>Lieberman’s speech at the 2008 GOP presidential nominating convention
criticizing Obama, the Democratic presidential nominee, struck a deep
nerve with many Democrats.</p>
<p>Lieberman was known in the Senate for his hawkish foreign policy
views, his pro-defense bent and his strong support for environmental
causes. He played a key role in the legislation that created the
Homeland Security Department.</p>
<p>Lieberman grew up in Stamford, Connecticut, where his father ran a
liquor store. Lieberman graduated from Yale University and Yale Law
School in New Haven. As Connecticut’s attorney general from 1983 to
1988, he was a strong consumer and environmental advocate. Lieberman
vaulted into the Senate by defeating moderate Republican incumbent
Lowell Weicker in 1988.</p>
<p>After leaving the Senate in 2013, Lieberman joined a New York City
law firm.</p>
<p>He is survived by his wife, Hadassah, and their four children.</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
I’ve been
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/03/americas-lost-year-electric-cars/677686/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">saying</a>
lately that a tipping point for EVs will be the electric family
crossover that can compete on price with the emperors of suburbia, the
ubiquitous Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4, which both start around $30,000.
Suddenly, there is one. Although I cannot in good faith recommend it.
</p>
<p>
The troubled electric vehicle startup Fisker has slashed the price of
its basic
<a href="https://www.fiskerinc.com/ocean" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ocean
EV</a> to just $24,999 in a desperate bid to sell enough vehicles to
stave off bankruptcy. The Ocean is now the
<a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/714051/fisker-ocean-price-cut/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cheapest
EV</a> on the American market. The high-end Ocean Extreme, with a dual
motor setup and zero-to-60 time under four seconds, has been discounted
from $61,499 to just $37,499.
</p>
<p>
Fisker might sell a few of these EVs to buyers looking for an offer they
can’t refuse, and those sales might keep the lights on a little longer
for a company that was recently shamed by historically bad reviews and
delisted from the New York Stock Exchange. But all the signs say the
flashy electric vehicle startup will run out of juice at any moment.
</p>
<p>
This wasn’t Henrik Fisker’s first try. Back in 2007, the Danish car
designer who made his name at legacy carmakers founded
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisker_Automotive" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fisker
Automotive</a>, a company that would produce the fish-mouthed Fisker
Karma. That car was a luxury take on the range-extended EV, or a vehicle
that uses an on-board gas-powered generator to refill the batteries,
thus extending its range.
</p>
<p>
Karma had the looks. Many auto enthusiasts at the time heralded its
design. (The car chaps at <em>Top Gear</em>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7AevkRcaxk" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">loved
it</a>.) Fisker teased future models that would position it as a rival
to Tesla, which was still selling small numbers in the days before the
Models 3 and Y. But the company didn’t have the follow-through. A series
of setbacks, including the bankruptcy of its battery supplier, sent
Fisker Automotive on the road to bankruptcy.
</p>
<p>
Lapses in quality control didn’t help. In 2012, the Karma delivered to
<em>Consumer Reports</em> for its car testing program
<a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/video/view/cars/auto-test-track/1496201987001/107850-fisker-karma-breaks-down/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">broke
down</a> upon arrival, requiring a battery replacement before the car
could be driven. It earned a failing grade because of “numerous
shortcomings, not just a single or even few flaws.” While Fisker the
company bit the dust in 2013, Fisker the man would carry on — though
saddled with a reputation as a dreamer who, to put it generously, did
not have the attention to detail for a startup company to succeed.
</p>
<p>
Things looked rosier for Fisker, Inc., the second-chance company he
launched in 2016. Instead of an over-engineered range-extended plug-in
hybrid electric vehicle, he announced a plain old EV. The Ocean promised
whiz-bang features such as a roof lined with solar panels, two-way
charging, and “California Mode” — a single button that opened all the
glass panels, allowing the sea breeze to waft through the car as it
cruised down the Pacific Coast Highway. Underneath the tech hype,
though, was a simple proposition: a mid-size crossover EV listed at a
price competitive with others in that popular category.
</p>
<p>
Once again, trouble found Fisker when the car got closer to reality. The
new company went public in 2020, but
<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/where-fisker-went-wrong-once-081658007.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according
to <em>Fortune</em></a>, “a slew of software, supply chain and
regulatory problems” prevented Fisker from moving the first Oceans until
2023. It
<a href="https://investors.fiskerinc.com/news/news-details/2024/Fisker-Inc.-Announces-Preliminary-Q4-and-Full-Year-2023-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=Fisker%20Ocean%20production%20was%204%2C789,and%204%2C929%20vehicles%20were%20delivered." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">delivered</a>
fewer than 5,000 of the EVs last year, despite building more than 10,000
of them.
</p>
<p>
Then came the testing. YouTube super-reviewer Marques Brownlee titled
his
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xWXRk3yaSw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video</a>
about the Ocean, “This Is the Worst Car I’ve Ever Reviewed” and spent 20
solid minutes outlining the weirdness of his driving experience,
including the company asking him to hold off reviewing the car until it
could rush out a software update. More than a decade after its
disastrous experience with the Karma, <em>Consumer Reports</em>
<a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/hybrids-evs/fisker-ocean-electric-suv-review-a2735159415/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>
that the Fisker Ocean was “unfinished,” with a “bizarre delivery
experience” and “disappearing safety features.”
</p>
<p>
This disastrous narrative arrived alongside reports of Fisker’s
financial ruin. Fisker suspended production of the Ocean and tried to
raise $150 million to keep the startup afloat, however a rumored
last-second
<a href="https://fortune.com/2024/03/02/tesla-rival-fisker-in-talks-with-nissan-partnership/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">deal</a>
with Nissan fell apart and now, despite Henrik Fisker’s promise to press
on, it appears the company has
<a href="https://www.autonews.com/automakers-suppliers/financial-lifeline-talks-end-ev-maker-fisker" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">no
clear lifeline</a> to stave off oblivion.
</p>
<p>
Given the relatively high cost of current EVs, some buyers might be
tempted by the fire-sale Fiskers. As <em>The Autopian</em>
<a href="https://www.theautopian.com/dont-blame-marques-brownlee-or-any-journo-if-fisker-goes-bankrupt/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">says</a>,
“the Fisker Ocean is a good car when it’s functional,” and if the
company can manage to push out a software update, then perhaps it will
be functional more often than not. The 231-mile range of the base model
isn’t impressive by 2024 standards, but the Ocean Extreme’s reported
360-mile range is a steal at its steeply discounted price.
</p>
<p>
Still: This is a capital case of <em>caveat emptor</em>. Given Fisker’s
long history of poor build quality and software bugs, it’d be a big risk
to pony up even the clearance sale price of an Ocean. Not to mention the
huge uncertainty of living with one. It can be hard enough to schedule
service for a Tesla; now imagine trying to deal with hardware for
software problems for an orphan EV whose company bit the dust.

American, Mexican Families Mourn Missing Bridge Workers</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>AZACUALPA, Honduras — The construction workers who went missing in
the Baltimore bridge collapse all hailed from Mexico or Central America
before they settled in the Maryland area. </p>
<p>Police managed to close bridge traffic seconds before a cargo ship
slammed into one of the Francis Scott Key Bridge’s supports early
Tuesday, causing the span to fall into the frigid Patapsco River. There
wasn’t time for a maintenance crew filling potholes on the span to get
to safety. </p>
<p>At least eight people fell into the water and two were rescued. The
other six are missing and presumed dead, but the search continued
Wednesday. </p>
<p>The governments of Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras
confirmed that their citizens were among the missing. </p>
<p>Maynor Yassir Suazo Sandoval, 38, was the youngest of eight siblings
from Azacualpa, a rural mountainous area in northwestern Honduras along
the border with Guatemala. </p>
<p>Eighteen years ago, he set out on his own for the United States
looking for opportunities. He had worked as an industrial technician in
Honduras, repairing equipment in the large assembly plants, but the pay
was too low to get ahead, one of his brothers, Martín Suazo Sandoval,
said Wednesday while standing in the dirt street in front of the
family’s small hotel in Honduras. </p>
<p>“He always dreamed of having his own business,” he said. </p>
<p>Maynor entered the United States illegally and settled in Maryland.
At first, he did any work he could find, including construction and
clearing brush. Eventually, he started a package delivery business in
the Baltimore-Washington area, his brother said. </p>
<p>Other siblings and relatives followed him north. </p>
<p>“He was the fundamental pillar, the bastion so that other members of
the family could also travel there and later get visas and everything,”
Martín Suazo Sandoval said. “He was really the driving force so that
most of the family could travel.” </p>
<p>Maynor has a wife and two children, ages 17 and 5, his brother
said. </p>
<p>The pandemic forced Maynor to find other work, and he joined Brawner
Builders, the company that was performing maintenance on the bridge when
it collapsed. </p>
<p>His brother said Maynor never talked about being scared of the work,
despite the heights he worked at on the bridges. “He always told us that
you had to triple your effort to get ahead,” Martín Suazo Sandoval said.
“He said it didn’t matter what time or where the job was, you had to be
where the work was.” </p>
<p>Things had been going well for him until the collapse. He was moving
through the steps to get legal residency and planned to return to
Honduras this year to complete the process, his brother said. </p>
<p>Even though Maynor had not been able to return to Honduras, he had
financially supported various nongovernmental social organizations in
town, as well as the youth soccer league, his brother said. The area
depends largely upon agriculture — coffee, cattle, sugarcane — he
said. </p>
<p>Maynor’s employer broke the news of his disappearance to his family,
leaving them devastated, especially his mother, who still lives in
Azacualpa, Martín Suazo Sandoval said. </p>
<p>“These are difficult moments, and the only thing we can do is keep
the faith,” he said, noting that his younger brother knew how to swim
and could have ended up anywhere. If the worst outcome is confirmed, he
said the family would work to return his body to Honduras. </p>
<p>In Mexico, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said three Mexicans
were on the bridge when it fell — one who was injured but rescued and
two who were still missing. He said he wouldn’t share their names for
the families’ privacy. </p>
<p>The tragedy illustrated the contributions that migrants make to the
U.S. economy, Lopez Obrador said. </p>
<p>“This demonstrates that migrants go out and do risky jobs at
midnight. And for this reason, they do not deserve to be treated as they
are by certain insensitive, irresponsible politicians in the United
States,” he said. </p>
<p>Guatemala’s Foreign Affairs Ministry confirmed that two of its
citizens were among the missing. </p>
<p>El Salvador’s foreign minister, Alexandra Hill Tinoco, posted
Wednesday on X that one Salvadoran citizen, Miguel Luna, was among the
missing workers. </p>
<p>Federal and state investigators have said the crash appears to have
been an accident.</p>

<p>If you read my scoop last week, I bet you’ve been wondering — how
well could a Snapdragon chip actually run Windows games? At the 2024
Game Developers Conference, the company claimed Arm could run those

medium-weight games like Control and Baldur’s Gate 3, it looks like the
target might be: 30 frames per second at 1080p screen resolution, medium
settings, possibly with AMD’s FSR 1.0 spatial upscaling enabled. ↫ Sean
Hollister at The Verge Those are some rough numbers for machines
Qualcomm claims can run x86 games at “close to full speed“.</p>

<h2 id="why-x86-doesnt-need-to-die">Why x86 doesn’t need to die</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-27, from: OS News</p>
<p>Hackaday recently published an article titled “Why x86 Needs to Die”
– the latest addition in a long-running RISC vs CISC debate. Rather than
x86 needing to die, I believe the RISC vs CISC debate needs to die. It
should’ve died a long time ago. And by long, I mean really long. About a
decade ago, a college professor asked if I knew about the RISC vs CISC
debate. I did not. When I asked further, he said RISC aimed for simpler
instructions in the hope that simpler hardware implementations would run
faster. While my memory of this short, ancient conversation is not
perfect, I do recall that he also mentioned the whole debate had already
become irrelevant by then: ISA differences were swept aside by the
resources a company could put behind designing a chip. This is the
fundamental reason why the RISC vs CISC debate remains irrelevant today.
Architecture design and implementation matter so much more than the
instruction set in play. ↫ Chips and Cheese The number of instruction
sets killed by x86 is high, and the number of times people have wrongly
predicted the death of x86 – most recently, after Apple announced its
first ARM processors – is even higher. It seems people are still holding
on to what x86 was like in the ’80s and early ’90s, completely
forgetting that the x86 we have today is a very, very different beast.
As Chips and Cheese details in this article, the differences between x86
and, say, ARM, aren’t nearly as big and fundamental as people think they
are. I’m a huge fan of computers running anything other than x86, not
because I hate or dislike the architecture, but because I like things
that are different, and the competition they bring. That’s why I love
POWER9 machines, and can’t wait for competitive non-Apple ARM machines
to come along. If you try to promote non-x86 ISAs out of hatred or
dislike of x86, history shows you’ll eventually lose.</p>

<h2 id="trump-blasts-judge-and-his-daughter-after-gag-order">Trump
Blasts Judge and His Daughter After Gag Order</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Donald Trump lashed out Wednesday at the New York judge
who put him under a gag order ahead of his April 15 hush-money criminal
trial, making a fallacious claim about his daughter and urging him to
step aside from the case.</p>
<p>In a social media post, the former president suggested without
evidence that Judge Juan M. Merchan was kowtowing to his daughter’s
interests as a Democratic political consultant. He also made a claim —
later repudiated by court officials — that she had posted a social media
photo showing Trump behind bars.</p>
<p>Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, complained on his Truth
Social platform that the gag order issued Tuesday was “illegal,
un-American, unConstitutional.” He said that Merchan, a veteran
Manhattan jurist, was “wrongfully attempting to deprive me of my First
Amendment Right to speak out against the Weaponization of Law
Enforcement” by Democratic rivals.</p>
<p>Trump claimed that Merchan’s daughter, Loren Merchan, whose firm has
worked on campaigns for President Joe Biden and other Democrats, had
recently posted a photo on social media depicting her “obvious goal” of
seeing him jailed.</p>
<p>In a statement, a spokesperson for New York’s state court system said
that claim was false and that the social media account Trump was
referencing no longer belongs to Loren Merchan. It appears to have been
taken over by someone else after she deleted it about a year ago, court
spokesperson Al Baker said.</p>
<p>The account on X, formerly known as Twitter, “is not linked to her
email address, nor has she posted under that screenname since she
deleted the account. Rather, it represents the reconstitution, last
April, and manipulation of an account she long ago abandoned,” Baker
said.</p>
<p>Messages seeking comment were left for Loren Merchan and Trump’s
campaign.</p>
<p>Trump did not link to the purported photo, but an X account under the
name “LM” showed a photo illustration of an imprisoned Trump as its
profile picture Wednesday morning. It was later changed to an image of
Vice President Kamala Harris as a child.</p>
<p>Loren Merchan’s consulting firm had linked to that account in its
social media posts in past years, but it is now private with no posts
displayed and states that it joined the platform in April 2023, after
Baker said she deleted it. Usernames on X can be taken over by other
users after they’re deleted.</p>
<p>The gag order, which prosecutors had requested, bars Trump from
either making or directing other people to make public statements on his
behalf about jurors and potential witnesses in the hush-money trial,
such as his lawyer turned nemesis Michael Cohen and porn star Stormy
Daniels. It also prohibits any statements meant to interfere with or
harass the court’s staff, prosecution team or their families.</p>
<p>It does not bar comments about Merchan or his family, nor does it
prohibit criticism of Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, the
elected Democrat whose office is prosecuting Trump.</p>
<p>Trump’s post insinuating that Loren Merchan had posted the photo came
after conservative commentator Laura Loomer posted a story online
Tuesday claiming to have unearthed her X account.</p>
<p>“So, let me get this straight,” Trump wrote on Truth Social, “the
Judge’s daughter is allowed to post pictures of her ‘dream’ of putting
me in jail … but I am not allowed to talk about the attacks against me,
and the Lunatics trying to destroy my life and prevent me from winning
the 2024 Presidential Election, which I am dominating?”</p>
<p>Bragg’s office declined to comment.</p>
<p>Trump’s three-part Truth Social post was his first reaction to the
gag order. His focus on Merchan’s daughter echoed his lawyers’ arguments
last year when they urged the judge to exit the case. The judge had also
made several small donations totaling $35 to Democratic causes during
the 2020 campaign, including $15 to Biden.</p>
<p>Merchan said then that a state court ethics panel found that Loren
Merchan’s work had no bearing on his impartiality. The judge said in a
ruling last September that he was certain of his “ability to be fair and
impartial” and that Trump’s lawyers had “failed to demonstrate that
there exists concrete, or even realistic reasons for recusal to be
appropriate, much less required on these grounds.”</p>
<p>In a recent interview, Merchan told The Associated Press that he and
his staff were working diligently to prepare for the historic first
trial of a former president.</p>
<p>“There’s no agenda here,” Merchan said. “We want to follow the law.
We want justice to be done.”</p>
<p>Trump’s hush-money case, set to be the first of his four criminal
cases to go to trial, centers on allegations that he falsely logged
payments to Cohen as legal fees in his company’s books when they were
for Cohen’s work during the 2016 campaign covering up negative stories
about Trump. That included $130,000 Cohen paid Daniels on Trump’s behalf
so she wouldn’t publicize her claim of a sexual encounter with him years
earlier.</p>
<p>Trump pleaded not guilty last April to 34 counts of falsifying
business records, a felony punishable by up to four years in prison,
though there is no guarantee that a conviction would result in jail
time. He denies having sex with Daniels and his lawyers have said that
the payments to Cohen were legitimate legal expenses, not part of any
coverup.</p>
<p>In issuing the gag order, Merchan cited Trump’s history of
“threatening, inflammatory, denigrating” remarks about people involved
in his legal cases. A violation could result in Trump being held in
contempt of court, fined or even jailed.</p>
<p>Though not covered by the restrictions, Merchan referenced Trump’s
various comments about him as an example of his rhetoric. The gag order
mirrors one imposed and largely upheld by a federal appeals court panel
in Trump’s Washington, D.C., election interference criminal case.</p>
<p>Trump’s lawyers fought a gag order, warning it would amount to
unconstitutional and unlawful prior restraint on his free speech
rights.</p>
<p>Merchan had long resisted imposing one, recognizing Trump’s “special”
status as a former president and current candidate and not wanting to
trample his ability to defend himself publicly.</p>
<p>But, he said, as the trial nears, he found that his obligation to
ensuring the integrity of the case outweighs First Amendment concerns.
He said Trump’s statements have induced fear and necessitated added
security measures to protect his targets and investigate threats.</p>
<p>Editor’s Note: This story updates a previous version from the
Associated Press to note that Loren Merchan said she no longer owns the
social media account Trump referenced and that it was taken over by
someone else over a year ago.</p>

Discuss Ukraine, Gaza With Macron in Paris</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will discuss
support for Ukraine during talks in Paris next week with French
President Emmanuel Macron, the State Department announced Wednesday.</p>
<p>France is among the major military suppliers to Ukraine, which is
facing an onslaught of Russian attacks.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden’s request for billions of dollars in new U.S.
military aid to Kyiv is held up in the House of Representatives, led by
the rival Republican Party.</p>
<p>“Secretary Blinken will meet with French President Macron to discuss
support for Ukraine, efforts to prevent escalation of the conflict in
Gaza and a number of other important issues,” State Department spokesman
Matthew Miller told reporters.</p>
<p>France has advocated for a permanent cease-fire between Israel and
Hamas, whereas the United States, Israel’s main ally, recently let pass
a U.N. Security Council resolution that calls for a cease-fire during
the month of Ramadan.</p>
<p>It will be the first visit in nearly two years to France by Blinken,
a fluent French speaker who grew up partly in Paris. Macron paid a state
visit to Washington in December 2022.</p>
<p>After Paris, Blinken will head to Brussels for talks among NATO
foreign ministers ahead of the alliance’s 75th anniversary summit in
Washington in July.</p>
<p>Blinken will also hold a three-way meeting in Brussels with EU
leaders and Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, who has been
seeking to branch out from his country’s historic alliance with
Russia.</p>
<p>Blinken and the European Union will address “support for Armenia’s
economic resilience as it works to diversify its trade partnerships and
to address humanitarian needs,” Miller said.</p>
<p>Armenia was angered last year by Russia’s failure to prevent
Azerbaijan from retaking the Nagorno-Karabakh region from ethnic
Armenian rebels.</p>

id="racism-morbid-curiosity-drove-us-museums-to-collect-indigenous-remains">Racism,
‘Morbid Curiosity’ Drove US Museums to Collect Indigenous Remains</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — In December 1900, John Wesley Powell received “the most
unusual Christmas present of any person in the United States, if not in
the world,” reported the Chicago Tribune.</p>
<p>The gift for this first director of the Smithsonian Institution’s
Bureau of Ethnology was a sealskin sack containing the mummified remains
of an Alaska Native.</p>
<p>The sender was a government employee hired to hunt Indian “relics,”
who said the remains had been difficult to acquire because “to come into
the possession of a dead Indian is a great crime among the Indians.”</p>
<p>The report concluded that it was the only “Indian relic” of this kind
at the Smithsonian and it was “beyond money value.”</p>
<p>As it turned out, it was not the museum’s only Alaskan mummy. In
1865, even before the U.S. purchased Alaska from Russia, Smithsonian
naturalist William H. Dall was hired to accompany an expedition to study
the potential for a telegraph route through Siberia to Europe. In his
spare time, he looted graves in the Yukon and caves on several Aleutian
Islands.</p>
<p>After the U.S. sealed the deal with Russia, the San Francisco-based
Alaska Commercial Company won exclusive trading rights and established
more than 90 trading posts in Alaska to meet the U.S. demand for ivory
and furs.</p>
<p>It also instructed agents “to collect and preserve objects of
interest in ethnology and natural history” and forward them to the
Smithsonian. Ernest Henig looted 12 preserved bodies and a skull from a
cave in the Aleutians in 1874. He donated two to California’s Academy of
Science and sent the remainder to the Smithsonian.</p>
<p>More than 30 years after the passage of the Native American Graves
Protection and Repatriation Act meant to return those remains, a
ProPublica investigation last year estimated that more than 110,000
Native American, Native Hawaiian and Alaska Native ancestors remain in
public collections across the U.S.</p>
<p>It is not known how many Indigenous remains are closeted in private
or overseas collections.</p>
<p>“Museums collected massive numbers, perhaps even millions,” said
anthropologist John Stephen “Chip” Colwell, who previously served as
curator of anthropology at the Denver Museum of Nature &amp; Science.
“Out of the 100 remains we [at the Denver museum] returned, I think only
about five or seven individuals were actually even studied.”</p>
<p>So, what sparked this 19th-century frenzy for collecting human
remains?</p>
<p>Reconciling science, religion</p>
<p>From the moment they first encountered Indigenous Americans, European
thinkers struggled to understand who they were, where they came from,
and whether they could be “civilized.”</p>
<p>The Christian bible taught them that all humans descended from Adam
and that God created Adam in his own image. So why, Europeans wondered,
did Native Americans, Africans and Asians look different?</p>
<p>Some Europeans theorized that all humans were created white, but
dietary or environmental differences caused some of them to turn “brown,
yellow, red or black.”</p>
<p>Other Europeans refused to accept that they shared a common ancestor
with people of color and theorized that God created the races separately
before he created Adam.</p>
<p>The birth of scientific racism</p>
<p>Presumptions that compulsory education and Christianization would
force Native Americans to abandon their traditional cultures and become
“civilized” into mainstream European-American culture proved untrue. So
19th-century scientists turned to advancements in medicine to “prove”
the inferiority of Indigenous peoples.</p>
<p>“That’s when you see scientists like Samuel Morton, who invented a
pseudoscience trying to place peoples within these social hierarchies
based on their biology, and they needed bones to solidify those racial
hierarchies,” said Colwell, who is editor-in-chief of the online
magazine SAPIENS and author of “Plundered Skulls and Stolen Spirits:
Inside the Fight to Reclaim Native America’s Culture.”</p>
<p>Morton was a Philadelphia physician who collected hundreds of human
skulls of all races, mostly Native American, that were forwarded to him
by physicians on the frontier. In his 1839 book “Crania Americana,”
Morton classified human races based on skull measurements. Morton’s
conclusions were used to support racist ideologies about the inferiority
of non-white humans.</p>
<p>“They are not only averse to the restraints of education, but for the
most part incapable of a continued process of reasoning on abstract
subjects,” he wrote of Native Americans. “The structure of [the Native]
mind appears to be different from that of the white man, nor can the two
harmonise in their social relations except on the most limited
scale.”</p>
<p>Despite Morton’s legacy as an early figure in scientific racism —
ideologies that generate pseudo-scientific racist beliefs — his work
earned him a reputation at the time as “a jewel of American science” and
influenced the field of anthropology and public policy for decades.</p>
<p>In 1868, for example, the U.S. Surgeon General turned his attention
away from the Civil War to the so-called “Indian wars” and instructed
field surgeons to collect Native American skulls and weapons and send
them to the Army Medical Museum in Washington “to aid in the progress of
anthropological science.”</p>
<p>“For museums, especially the early years of collecting, it was a form
of trophy keeping, a competition between museums,” Colwell told VOA.
“And some of it was a competition between national governments to
accumulate big collections to demonstrate their global and imperial
aspirations.”</p>
<p>All the rest, he said, were fragments of morbid curiosity.</p>

President Xi Meets With US Executives as Investment Wanes</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BEIJING — China’s President Xi Jinping met American business leaders
at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on Wednesday, as the
government tries to woo back foreign investors and international firms
seeking reassurance about the impact of new regulations. </p>
<p>Beijing wants to boost growth of the world’s second-largest economy
after foreign direct investment shrank 8% in 2023 amid heightened
investor concern over an anti-espionage law, exit bans, and raids on
consultancies and due diligence firms. </p>
<p>Xi’s increasing focus on national security has left many companies
uncertain where they might step over the line, even as Chinese leaders
make public overtures toward foreign investors. </p>
<p>“China’s development has gone through all sorts of difficulties and
challenges to get to where it is today,” Xi said, according to state
media. </p>
<p>“In the past, [China] did not collapse because of a ‘China collapse
theory,’ and it will also not peak now because of a ‘China peak
theory,’” he said. </p>
<p>Stephen Schwarzman, co-founder and CEO of private equity firm
Blackstone, Raj Subramaniam, head of American delivery giant FedEx, and
Cristiano Amon, the boss of chips manufacturer Qualcomm, were part of
the around 20-strong all-male U.S. contingent.  </p>
<p>The audience with Xi — organized by the National Committee on
U.S.-China Relations, the U.S.-China Business Council and the Asia
Society think tank — lasted around 90 minutes, according to a person
with direct knowledge of the matter. </p>
<p>The source, who declined to be named as they were not authorized to
speak to the media, had no immediate comment on what was discussed. The
National Committee on U.S.-China Relations and Asia Society did not
immediately respond to requests for comment on the meeting. </p>
<p>A statement from U.S.-China Business Council said the participants
“stressed the importance of rebalancing China’s economy by increasing
consumption there and encouraging the government to further address
longstanding concerns with cross border data flows, government
procurement, intellectual property rights, and improved regulatory
transparency and predictability.” </p>
<p>The U.S. and China are gradually resuming engagements after relations
between the two economic superpowers sank to their lowest in years due
to clashes over trade policies, the future of democratically ruled
Taiwan and territorial claims in the South China Sea.</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
Thinking too hard about time is a little like thinking too hard about
blinking; it seems natural and intuitive until suddenly you’re sweating
and it makes no sense at all. At least, that’s how I felt when I came
across an incredible new study
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07170-0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">published
in <em>Nature</em></a> this afternoon by Duncan Agnew, a geophysicist at
the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, suggesting that climate change
might be affecting global timekeeping.
</p>
<p>
Our internationally agreed-upon clock, Coordinated Universal Time (UTC),
consists of two components: the one you’re familiar with, which is the
complete rotation of the Earth around its axis, as well as the average
taken from
<a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/time/how-do-atomic-clocks-work.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">400
atomic clocks</a> around the world. Since the 1970s, UTC has added 27
leap seconds at irregular intervals to keep pace with atomic clocks as
the Earth’s rotation has gradually slowed. Then that rotation
<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/earth-spinning-faster-than-usual-shortest-day-ever/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">started
to speed up</a> in 2016; June 29, 2022, set a record for the planet’s
shortest day, with the Earth completing a full rotation 1.59
milliseconds short of 24 hours. Timekeepers anticipated at that point
that we’d need our first-ever <em>negative</em> leap second around 2026
to account for the acceleration.
</p>
<p>
But such a model doesn’t properly account for the transformative changes
the planet is undergoing due to climate change — specifically,
<a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/ice-sheets/?intent=121#:~:text=Antarctica%20is%20losing%20ice%20mass,adding%20to%20sea%20level%20rise." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the
billions of tons of ice</a> melting from Greenland and Antarctica every
year.
</p>
<p>
Using mathematical modeling, Agnew found that the melt-off, as measured
by
<a href="https://gracefo.jpl.nasa.gov/science/ice-sheets-and-glaciers/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">gravity-tracking
satellites</a>, has again <em>decreased</em> the Earth’s angular
velocity to the extent that a negative leap second will actually be
required <em>three years later </em>than estimates, in 2029.
</p>
<p>
While a second here or there might not seem like much on a cosmic scale,
as Agnew explained to me, these kinds of discrepancies throw into
question the entire idea of basing our time system on the physical
position of the Earth. Even more mind-bogglingly, Agnew’s modeling makes
the astonishing case that so long as it is, climate change will be
“inextricably linked” to global timekeeping.
</p>
<p>
Confused? So was I, until Agnew talked me through his research. Our
conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.
</p>
<p>
<strong>How did you get involved in researching this? I’d never have
expected there to be a relationship between climate change and
timekeeping.</strong>
</p>
<p>
Pure accident. I’m a geophysicist and I have an avocational interest in
timekeeping, so I know all about leap seconds and the history of atomic
clocks. I thought about writing a paper figuring out statistically what
the next century would bring in terms of leap seconds.
</p>
<p>
When I started working on the paper, I realized there was a signal that
I needed to allow for, which was the change induced by melting ice —
which has been studied, there are plenty of papers on this satellite
gravity signal. But nobody has, as far as I can tell, related it to
rotation. Mostly because, from a geophysical standpoint, that’s not very
interesting.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Interesting. Or, well, I guess <em>not
</em>interesting.</strong>
</p>
<p>
I mean, there is geophysical literature on this, but it’s largely,
<em>Okay, we see this signal, and gravity doesn’t mesh with what we
think we know about ice melt. Does it measure what we think we know
about sea level change? How does the geophysics all fit together?</em>
And the fact that it changes Earth’s rotation is kind of a side issue.
</p>
<p>
I did not know about this when I got started on this project; it
appeared as I was working on it. I thought, “Wait, I need to allow for
this.” And when I did, it produced the — I don’t want to use the words
“more important” because of the climate change part, but it produced a
secondary result, which was that this potential for a negative leap
second became clear.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Walk me through how the ice melting at the poles changes the
Earth’s rotation.</strong>
</p>
<p>
This is the part that’s easy to explain. Ice melts. A lot of water that
used to be at the poles is now distributed all over the ocean. Some of
it is close to the equator. The standard picture for what’s called
change of angular velocity because of moment of inertia — ignore all the
verbiage — but the standard picture is of an ice skater who is spinning.
She has her arms over her head. When she puts her arms out, she will
slow down — like the water going from the poles to the equator. And
that’s it. This is the simple part of the problem.
</p>
<p>
<strong>So what’s the hard part?</strong>
</p>
<p>
The hard part is explaining the part about the Earth’s core. If you have
two things that are connected to each other and rotating and one of them
slows down, the other one has to speed up. I have not been able to think
of an ice skater-like-metaphor to go with that, but the simple one is if
you were to put a bowl of water on a lazy Susan and you spin the bowl,
then the water will start to spin. It won’t spin initially, but then it
will start.
</p>
<p>
If you started stirring the water in the other direction, that would
slow the Lazy Susan down. And that’s the interaction between the core
and the solid part of the Earth.
</p>
<p>
<strong>And is that causing the negative leap second to move back three
years?</strong>
</p>
<p>
That’s why the leap second might happen at all. On a very long
timescale, what’s happening is that the tides are slowing the Earth
down. The Earth being slower than an atomic clock means that you need a
positive leap second every so often. That was the case in 1972, when
they started using leap seconds. The assumption was that the Earth would
just keep slowing down and so there would be more positive leap seconds
over time.
</p>
<p>
Instead, the Earth has sped up, entirely because of the core, and that’s
not something that people necessarily anticipated. When you take the
effect of melting ice out, it becomes clear there’s this steady
deceleration of the core; the core is rotating more and more slowly. If
you extrapolate that — which is a somewhat risky thing to do, you can’t
really predict what the core is going to do — then you discover that
there is a leap second, in 2029. The ice melting is going in the other
direction; if the ice melting hadn’t occurred, then the leap second
would come even earlier. Is this all making sense?
</p>
<p>
<strong>I think I’m grasping it.</strong>
</p>
<p>
Just so you know, one of the two reviewers of this paper was someone in
geophysics who said, “I know all this stuff. I wasn’t familiar with the
rotation part. This paper has an awful lot of moving parts.”
</p>
<p>
<strong>So, it’s just a difference of a second. Why does this even
matter?</strong>
</p>
<p>
We are all familiar with the problem of not being synchronized — we just
went through it. If you forget that we did Daylight Savings Time, then
you’re an hour off from everybody else and it’s bewildering and a
nuisance.
</p>
<p>
Same problem with leap seconds, except for us, a second is not a big
deal. For a computer network, though, a second <em>is</em> a big deal.
And why is that? Well, for example, in the United States, the rules for
stock markets say that everything that is done has to be accurately
timed to a 20th of a second. In Europe, it’s actually to the nearest
1,000th of a second. If we were all just farmers or something, it
wouldn’t be a problem, but there’s this whole infrastructure that’s
invisible to us that tells our phones what time it is, and allows GPS to
work, and everything else.
</p>
<p>
The easiest thing to do would be to not have a negative leap second.
Indeed, there are plans not to have leap seconds anymore because for
computer networks, they’re an enormous problem. They arrive at irregular
intervals; some human being has to put the information into the
computer; the computer has to have a program that tells it when the leap
seconds are; and most computer programs can’t tell whether it’s a plus
or minus second because there’s never been a minus before. From the
computer network standpoint, it would be simplest to just not do this.
</p>
<p>
So, you ask, why are we doing this? In 1972, when leap seconds were
instituted, there were two communities that cared about precise time.
One was the people who cared about the frequency of your radio station
and other kinds of telecommunications. They wanted to use atomic clocks
with frequencies that didn’t change, but that didn’t mesh with what the
Earth was doing.
</p>
<p>
Who cares about time telling you how the Earth is rotating? Well, the
answer then was that there were people who used the stars for celestial
navigation. Back then, celestial navigation was used not just for ships,
but for airplanes — if you flew across the ocean, there was a guy in the
cockpit, an actual navigator, who would use a periscope to look at the
stars and locate the plane, if only as sort of a backup system. That
community is now gone. Almost nobody uses celestial navigation as a
primary, or even a secondary, way of finding out where they are anymore
because of GPS.
</p>
<p>
My own personal view — and I can warn you, there’s a huge amount of
dispute about this — is that we’d be fine if we just stopped having leap
seconds at all.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Is there a … governing body of time? That forces us to do leap
seconds?</strong>
</p>
<p>
There’s a giant tangle of international organizations that deal with
this, but the rules were set by the people in charge of keeping radio
stations aligned because radio broadcasts were how time signals were
distributed back in 1972. So the rule was created. Who makes that
decision is something called the International Earth Rotation and
Reference Systems Service, which uses astronomy to monitor what the
Earth is doing. They can predict a little bit in advance where things
are going to be, and if within six months things are going to be more
than half a second out, they will announce there will be a leap second.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Back to climate change: It seems pretty amazing that something
like melting ice can throw things off so much.</strong>
</p>
<p>
All the stuff about negative seconds is important, but it’s only
important because of this infrastructure, because we have all these
rules. Strip all of that away and the most important result becomes the
fact that climate change has caused an amount of ice melt that is enough
to change the rotation rate of the entire Earth in a way that’s visible.
</p>
<p>
How do you talk to people about the gigatons of ice that Greenland loses
every year? Do you talk about “water that could cover the entire United
States to the depth of X” to get it into people’s minds? Yes, these are
small changes in the rotation rate, but just the fact that we can say,
“Look, this is slowing down the<em> entire Earth</em>” seems like
another way of saying that climate change is unprecedented and
important.
</p>
<p>
<strong>How do we proceed, then, if climate change is messing with our
system?</strong>
</p>
<p>
There was a lot of resistance to even introducing atomic time. Time was
thought of as being about Earth’s rotation and the astronomers didn’t
want to give it up. In fact, in the 19th century, observatories would
make money by selling time signals to the rest of the community. Then,
in the 1950s, the physicists showed up, ran atomic clocks, never looked
at the stars, and said, “We can do time better.” The physicists were
right. But it took the astronomical community a while to come around to
accepting that was how time was going to be defined.
</p>
<p>
If we get rid of leap seconds then we’d really have cut the connection
between the way in which human beings have always thought of time as
being, say, from noon to noon, or from sunrise to sunset, and we’d be
replacing it with some bunch of guys in a laboratory somewhere running a
machine. For some people, it’s very troubling to think of severing the
keeping of time from the Earth’s rotation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>You lose a bit of the romance, I think. But clearly, tying our
way of describing the linear passage of sequential events to the Earth’s
rotation is going to be messy.</strong>
</p>
<p>
Exactly right. There’s a quote from, of all people, St. Augustine,
saying, “I know what time is, but if somebody asked me, I can’t tell
them.”

id="texas-migrant-arrest-law-on-hold-for-now-under-latest-court-ruling">Texas’
Migrant Arrest Law on Hold for Now Under Latest Court Ruling</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW ORLEANS — A Texas law that allows the state to arrest and deport
migrants suspected of illegally entering the U.S. will remain on hold
for now, a federal appeals court ruled.</p>
<p>The 2-1 ruling late Tuesday from a three-judge panel of the 5th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals followed a March 20 hearing by a three-judge
panel of the court. It’s just the latest move in a seesaw legal case
over Republican Gov. Greg Abbott’s strict new immigration law that is
not yet ended.</p>
<p>The Justice Department has argued that Texas’ law is a clear
violation of federal authority and would create chaos at the border.
Texas has argued that President Joe Biden’s administration isn’t doing
enough to control the border and that the state has a right to take
action.</p>
<p>Judge Andrew Oldham, an appointee of former President Donald Trump
and a former aide to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, dissented with the majority
decision.</p>
<p>Oldham wrote that the Biden administration faced a high bar to take
sovereign power that Texas has to enforce a law its people and leaders
want. The judge predicted the same 2-1 split when the merits of the case
are considered while the legal challenge plays out.</p>
<p>“There is real peril in this approach. In our federal system, the
State of Texas is supposed to retain at least some of its sovereignty,”
Oldham wrote. “Its people are supposed to be able to use that
sovereignty to elect representatives and send them to Austin to debate
and enact laws that respond to the exigencies that Texans experience and
that Texans want addressed.”</p>
<p>The law was in effect for several hours on March 19 after the U.S.
Supreme Court cleared the way. But the high court didn’t rule on the
merits of the case. It instead sent the case back to the 5th Circuit,
which then suspended enforcement while it considered the latest
appeal.</p>
<p>The latest ruling keeps the block in place.</p>
<p>Spokespersons for Abbott and state Attorney General Ken Paxton did
not immediately return phone calls for comment Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>The law signed by Abbott allows any Texas law enforcement officer to
arrest people suspected of entering the country illegally, but that
brief window while the law was in effect revealed that many sheriffs
were unprepared, unable or uninterested in enforcing SB4 in the first
place.</p>
<p>Sheriff Thaddeus Cleveland of Terrell County, which touches more than
50 miles (80 kilometers) of border, said during a gathering of about 100
sheriffs at the state Capitol last week said there’s no practical way
for him to enforce the law.</p>
<p>Cleveland said he has no way to transport people, the county jail has
space for just seven people and the closest port of entry is a drive of
more than 2 1/2 hours away.</p>
<p>Smith County Sheriff Larry Smith, president of the Texas Sheriff’s
Association, said the law will have little effect in his jurisdiction in
East Texas, which is closer to Louisiana and Oklahoma than Mexico which
is nearly 400 miles (644 kilometers) away.</p>
<p>Once in custody, migrants could either agree to a Texas judge’s order
to leave the U.S. or be prosecuted on misdemeanor charges of illegal
entry. Migrants who don’t leave could face arrest again under more
serious felony charges.</p>
<p>Texas did not announce any arrests during the brief time the law was
previously in effect. Authorities have offered various explanations for
how they might enforce the law. Mexico has said it would refuse to take
back anyone who is ordered by Texas to cross the border.</p>
<p>The law is considered by opponents to be the most dramatic attempt by
a state to police immigration since an Arizona law more than a decade
ago that was partially struck down by the Supreme Court. Critics have
also said the Texas law could lead to civil rights violations and racial
profiling.</p>
<p>Supporters have rejected those concerns, saying arresting officers
must have probable cause, which could include witnessing the illegal
entry or seeing it on video. They also say that they expect the law
would be used mostly in border counties, though it would apply
statewide.</p>

Trial Date Set for Ex-Official Accused of Killing Vegas Journalist</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LAS VEGAS, NEVADA — A Nevada judge tentatively set an August 5 trial
date for a former Las Vegas-area elected official accused of killing an
investigative journalist.</p>
<p>But she acknowledged that more time might be needed to finish
searching the slain reporter’s computers for possible evidence.</p>
<p>Robert Telles, a former Democratic county administrator of estates,
has pleaded not guilty to stabbing Las Vegas Review-Journal reporter
Jeff German to death in September 2022.</p>
<p>Telles, 47, has remained jailed since his arrest days after German’s
body was found. Telles and his lawyer, Robert Draskovich, say he wants
his murder trial to start as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Clark County District Court Judge Michelle Leavitt decided two weeks
ago that a March 18 date was unrealistic. She agreed with prosecutors on
Tuesday that August might also be too soon, but she said it was
important to have a date to work toward.</p>
<p>Progress in the case stalled while arguments went to the state
Supreme Court about opening German’s cellphone and computers, possibly
exposing confidential information that is protected from disclosure
under state and federal law.</p>
<p>Review-Journal employees are now reviewing those files, and attorneys
say it might take months to finish.</p>
<p>German, 69, was found stabbed outside his home months after he wrote
articles in 2022 that were critical of Telles and his managerial conduct
while he was in elected office.</p>

will be located about 16 nautical miles south of Marth’s Vineyard and
have a capacity of 924-megawatts (MW) of renewable energy to power more
than 320,000 homes per year. It will

be completed</a> in 2026. “The approval is the latest positive
development for an industry that had been bogged down by inflation,
higher borrowing costs and supply-chain woes,”
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=99d0232575&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>
<em>Bloomberg</em>. The seven projects in total have the potential to
provide more than 8 gigawatts of clean energy to power roughly 3 million
homes, according to the Department of the Interior.

<h3>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Deadly Baltimore bridge collapse halts coal shipments
</h3>
<p>
<strong></strong>Six people are presumed dead after Baltimore’s Francis
Scott Key Bridge collapsed yesterday. The search continues for their
remains. The disaster has halted the flow of ships in and out of the
Port of Baltimore indefinitely, and this could have knock-on economic
effects. It’s already throwing the U.S. coal market for a loop,
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=0c8c2eca2c&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported
Heatmap’s Matthew Zeitlin</a>. The port plays a pivotal role in the
energy trade, as it is the second largest coal export facility in the
country. One coal shipping executive told <em>Bloomberg</em> the
disruption could last more than a month. Shares of Consol Energy, which
ships more than 10 million tons of coal annually through a terminal at
the Port of Baltimore, were down 7% yesterday. In terms of its effects
on the overall energy market, the port’s indefinite closure could be
mild and may actually result in lower energy prices in the Northeast, as
coal that would have been exported becomes, essentially, stranded
stateside, Greg Brew, an analyst at the Eurasia Group, told Zeitlin. But
even this effect may be muted, Brew explained, because the weather is
warming up with the end of winter, meaning there’s less demand on
natural gas for heating.

<h3>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Cocoa prices reach historic highs
</h3>
<p>
<strong></strong>Cocoa futures were trading above $10,000 a tonne
yesterday for the first time, more than double their price from two
months ago, the <em>Financial Times</em>
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=74eeebfaa5&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">reported</a>.
Prices dropped slightly later in the day, but the overall trend is not
good: Cocoa has more than tripled in cost over the past year,
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=31a4ff8030&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according
to</a> CNBC. Two countries in West Africa – Ivory Coast and Ghana –
produce around two-thirds of the world’s cocoa beans. Heavy rainfall
followed by dry heat in the region has hurt crop yields, and many
farmers are abandoning the trade for other crops. “It rains outside of
the rainy seasons now,” one cocoa plantation owner in Ghana
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=719ee3426c&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told
the <em>FT</em></a>. “Dry seasons are hotter than they used to be.”
Consumers could start to feel the pinch soon in the form of smaller
chocolate bars for higher prices. Dark chocolate, which has a high cocoa
content, will likely see the biggest price hike.

<li>Western U.S. hydropower dips due to drought
</h3>
<p>
The amount of hydropower generated in the western U.S. plummeted last
year because of drought,
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=8e95933ec9&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according
to</a> the Energy Information Administration (EIA). Eleven states –
Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, Wyoming,
California, Oregon, and Washington – produce nearly 60% of the nation’s
hydroelectricity. Between October 1, 2022, and September 30, 2023, they
produced 141.6 million megawatthours (MWh) of hydropower, 11% below the
year prior, and the smallest amount since 2001. Drought and heat waves
meant less rainfall and rapidly melting snowpack in the Pacific
Northwest. Hydropower in Washington fell by 23% compared to the year
before. California, on the other hand, saw hydropower grow thanks to
repeated atmospheric rivers, but not enough to make up for the overall
regional deficit. The EIA forecasts that western hydropower production
will fall by another 12% this year. <em>The Verge </em>succinctly
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=973bde353f&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">explained</a>
why a drop in hydropower is bad for the planet: “Drought reduces the
amount of clean energy available from hydroelectric dams. To avoid
energy shortfalls, utilities wind up relying on fossil fuels to make up
the difference. That leads to more of the greenhouse gas emissions
causing climate change, which makes droughts worse.”

<li>Wisconsin utilities pledge to use union labor to build clean energy
infrastructure
</h3>
<p>
<strong></strong>Wisconsin’s major utilities this week announced a
commitment to employing local union workers to build clean energy
projects. The state is embarking on a major renewables expansion,
including new solar installations, onshore wind, and battery storage.
The projects will require about 19,000 construction jobs, and the
biggest power providers in the state – Alliant Energy, Madison Gas &amp;
Electric, WEC Energy Group, and Xcel Energy – say they’ll rely on
workers from five labor unions to fill those roles. The pledge “reflects
the power of the federal Inflation Reduction Act’s tax incentives for
large-scale renewable energy
projects,”<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=5022d5a9c9&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">

IRA provides additional incentives for projects that are built with
union labor or pay the local prevailing wage.”

<h2 id="infinite-mac-turning-to-the-dark-side">Infinite Mac: turning to
the dark side</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-27, from: OS News</p>
<p>About a year ago I came across the Previous emulator – it appeared to
be a faithful simulation of the NeXT hardware and thus capable of
running NeXTStep. While including it in Infinite Mac would be
scope-creep, NeXT’s legacy is in many ways more relevant to today’s
macOS than classic Mac OS. It also helped that it’s under active
development by its original creator (see the epic thread in the NeXT
Computers forums), and thus a modern, living codebase. Previous is the
fifth emulator that I’ve ported to WebAssembly/Emscripten and the
Infinite Mac runtime, and it’s gotten easier. As I’m doing this work,
I’m developing more and more empathy for those doing Mac game ports –
some things are really easy and others become yak shaves due to the
unintended consequences of choices made by the original developers.
Previous is available on multiple platforms and has good abstractions,
so overall it was a pretty pleasant experience. ↫ Mihai Parparita By
porting previous to WebAssembly/Emscripten, Infinite Mac now offers
access to a whole slew of NeXTSTEP releases, from the earliest known
release to the last one from 1997. There’s also a ton of applications
added to make the experience feel more realistic. This makes Infinite
Mac even more useful than it already was, ensuring it’s one of the best
and easiest ways to experience old macOS and now NeXTSTEP releases
through virtual machines (real ones, this time), available in your
browser. I’ll be spending some time with these new additions for sure,
since I’ve very little experience with NeXTSTEP other than whatever I
vicariously gleamed through Steven Troughton-Smith‘s toots on the
subject over the years. Mihai Parparita is doing incredibly important
work through Infinite Mac, and he deserves credit and praise for all
he’s doing here.</p>

<p>date: 2024-03-27, from: OS News</p>
<p>Seven years ago, on 27 March 2017, Apple introduced one of the most
fundamental changes in its operating systems since Mac OS X 10.0 Cheetah
was released 16 years earlier. On that day, those who updated iOS to
version 10.3 had their iPhone’s storage silently converted to the first
release of Apple File System, APFS. Six months later, with the release
of macOS 10.13 High Sierra on 25 September, Mac users followed suit. ↫
Howard Oakley The migration from HFS+ to APFS is still an amazing feat
for Apple to have pulled off. Hundreds of millions devices converted
from one filesystem to another, and barely anyone noticed – no matter
how you look at it, that’s an impressive achievement, and the engineers
who made it possible deserve all the praise they’re getting.</p>

Vulnerability in Saflok’s RFID-Based Keycard Locks</h2>

<p>
It’s
<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/saflok-hotel-lock-unsaflok-hack-technique/">pretty
devastating</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Today, Ian Carroll, Lennert Wouters, and a team of other security
researchers are revealing a hotel keycard hacking technique they call
<a href="https://unsaflok.com/">Unsaflok</a>. The technique is a
collection of security vulnerabilities that would allow a hacker to
almost instantly open several models of Saflok-brand RFID-based keycard
locks sold by the Swiss lock maker Dormakaba. The Saflok systems are
installed on 3 million doors worldwide, inside 13,000 properties in 131
countries. By exploiting weaknesses in both Dormakaba’s encryption and
the underlying RFID system Dormakaba uses, known as MIFARE Classic,
Carroll and Wouters have demonstrated just how easily they can open a
Saflok keycard lock. Their technique starts with obtaining any keycard
from a target hotel—say, by booking a room there or grabbing a keycard
out of a box of used ones—then reading a certain code from that card
with a $300 RFID read-write device, and finally writing two keycards of
their own. When they merely tap those two cards on a lock, the first
rewrites a certain piece of the lock’s data, and the second opens it…

time apart they settled down, though. Patches took a nap, and Gidget
decided beating him up could be deferred in favour of just watching him
like a hawk, and now they’re <em>both</em> snoozing peacefully on the
couch. What a relief 😅

Climate Startup Is Building the World’s Biggest Airplane</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-27, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTgzMTkyMS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczMTMxMTU5N30.YC3cx13aYW1C2A-DZ3TdcyGLUXkrmniOik_8gN7HpWU/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Radia is a $1 billion climate tech startup with an unusual pitch: It is
trying to build the world’s largest airplane. Its proposed aircraft, the
Radia Wind Runner, would be as long as a football field, nearly as wide
as a New York city block, and capable of carrying 12 times the volume of
a Boeing 747. Such a plane could ferry massive wind-turbine blades,
unlocking what the company calls “gigawind” — the ability to build
offshore-sized wind turbines on land.
</p>
<p>
Why is that important? Because the larger the wind turbine, the more
electricity that it generates — and the less wind it needs to work with.
Radia says that its “gigawind” farms could profitably go into places
with slower wind speeds, such as the Northeast or Mississippi Delta.
They could also be built in the existing Wind Belt, potentially doubling
current output.
</p>
<p>
In this week’s episode, Rob and Jesse talk to Radia’s chief executive
officer, Mark Lundstrom. (Jesse’s consulting firm did some research for
Radia while it was in stealth mode, in 2020 and 2023.) We discuss why
the world needs a bigger plane, how such a new aircraft gets licensed,
and why massive wind turbines could be such a big deal for renewable
electricity. Shift Key is hosted by Robinson Meyer, executive editor of
Heatmap, and Jesse Jenkins, a Princeton professor of energy systems
engineering.

Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Jesse Jenkins: </strong>I’m here in the mechanical and aerospace
engineering department at Princeton, so we’ve got a lot of students
excited about new aerospace applications. I have a six-year-old kid, as
well, and he’s also excited about anything that goes fast and is big, so
I’m sure he’ll get excited about the eventual Lego kit for the
WindRunner that we’ll have to get out in the world. But talk through the
size of this aircraft compared to, say, something we’re used to, like a
737 or more conventional aircraft. <br/> <br/> <strong>Mark Lundstrom:
</strong>Sure. So before understanding the size, one has to understand
the fundamental mission requirements. And so the goal, Radia’s goal is
to be able to move up to a 105 meter long object that could weigh up to
75 tons. Now we can also move multiple smaller blades, so two 95s, or
three 85s, or four 75s. So the vehicle is quite versatile. <br/> <br/>
In terms of sheer size, it’s about 12 times the volume of a 747. So it’s
very, very large compared to the 747. It’s about nine times the volume
of the Antonovs. And yet what’s very different about it — <br/> <br/>
<strong>Jenkins:</strong> And the Antonov, that’s the largest plane
built to date, right? <br/> <br/> <strong>Lundstrom:</strong> Yes, the
largest volumetric plane right now. There’s about 14 or 15 of them left
in the world, usually Russian or Ukrainian operated. <br/> <br/>
<strong>Robinson Meyer:</strong> I was going to say, I remember the
biggest plane in the world being destroyed right at the beginning of the
Ukraine War and was wondering how that compared to the to the WindRunner
vehicle. <br/> <br/> <strong>Lundstrom:</strong> So the Antonov 225,
there was one of them. WindRunner is six times bigger in volume than
that airplane was, and it’s nine times bigger in volume than the
remaining Antonov 124s that are still out there. And so, and what’s
additionally unusual about it, in addition to the size, is its ability
to land on dirt. <br/> <br/> <strong>Meyer: </strong>Wow. <br/> <br/>
<strong>Lundstrom:</strong> Things like Antonovs, 747s, etc., they need
to land on about 9,000 feet of steel reinforced concrete, typically. And
we designed the WindRunners so we could land on relatively short dirt
strips, so just over a mile of a semi-prepared field. And that allows us
to bring the payload into a wind farm, and be able to get a very large
aircraft out of the wind farm. It’s probably the first time that an
aircraft has been designed to optimize around volume, as opposed to
mass. <br/> <br/> Usually when an aircraft design team starts off,
they’ll start off thinking about how much mass has to be moved. We
really started off thinking about how much volume has to be moved. So
there are aircraft that move larger mass than the WindRunner. There’s
absolutely no aircraft that comes close to moving larger volumes and
being able to land that volume on a relatively short dirt strip.

Lottery Streak Ends: Someone Wins $1.12B Mega Millions</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>DES MOINES, Iowa — Someone in New Jersey overcame the odds Tuesday
night and won the $1.12 billion Mega Millions jackpot, breaking a
winless streak that dated to last December.</p>
<p>The numbers drawn were: 7, 11, 22, 29, 38 and 4. The winning ticket
was sold in New Jersey, according the the Mega Millions website.</p>
<p>Until the latest drawing, no one had matched all six numbers and won
the Mega Millions jackpot since Dec. 8. That amounted to 30 straight
drawings without a big winner.</p>
<p>It’s tough to win the Mega Millions jackpot because the odds are so
long, at 1 in 302.6 million.</p>
<p>The prize is the eighth largest in U.S. lottery history.</p>
<p>The $1.12 billion jackpot is for a winner who is paid through an
annuity, with an initial payment and then 29 annual payments. Most
winners choose a cash payout, which would be $537.5 million.</p>
<p>The next big U.S. lottery drawing will be Wednesday night for an
estimated $865 million Powerball jackpot. No one has won that prize
since New Year’s Day, making for 36 drawings without a winner.</p>
<p>Mega Millions is played in 45 states plus Washington, D.C., and the
U.S. Virgin Islands. Powerball also is played in those states as well as
Washington, D.C., the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.</p>

Officials Warn Israel’s Gallant Against Invading Rafah</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Top Biden administration officials urged Israeli Defense
Minister Yoav Gallant to abandon plans to invade the southern Gaza city
of Rafah, where more than 1.4 million Palestinian civilians seek safety,
as U.S.-Israel tensions brew over Israel’s conduct in its six-month-old
war against Hamas.</p>
<p>In meetings Monday and Tuesday, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and
Secretary of State Antony Blinken reaffirmed U.S. support for Israel’s
right to defend itself while reiterating opposition to Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu’s planned ground offensive to target Hamas in Gaza’s
southernmost city on the border with Egypt.</p>
<p>“Our goal [is] to help Israel find an alternative to a full-scale and
perhaps premature military operation that could endanger the over 1
million civilians that are sheltering in Rafah,” a senior U.S. defense
official told reporters Tuesday, briefing on the condition of anonymity
under ground rules set by the Pentagon.</p>
<p>A major ground operation in Rafah would further jeopardize the
welfare of Palestinian civilians, State Department spokesperson Matthew
Miller said on Monday. He added that Blinken underscored to Gallant that
“alternatives exist” that would both better ensure Israel’s security and
protect Palestinian civilians.</p>
<p>Amid a looming famine in Gaza, Austin warned of the “humanitarian
catastrophe” in the Palestinian enclave, describing civilian casualties
as “far too high” and aid deliveries as “far too low.” His remarks
echoed Blinken’s calls for Israel “to immediately surge and sustain”
more aid.</p>
<p>The Netanyahu government has denied accusations by international aid
agencies and the United Nations that Israel is blocking aid and
provoking famine in Gaza as part of its strategy to root out Hamas.</p>
<p>Similar admonitions were likely being conveyed by White House
national security adviser Jake Sullivan. In a sign of potentially
complicated talks, Sullivan’s meeting with Gallant, originally scheduled
for Monday, was extended an extra day.</p>
<p>“They believed it was important to continue the conversation,” said
White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.</p>
<p>Sullivan told reporters last week that President Joe Biden himself
had warned Netanyahu an invasion in Rafah would be a mistake and urged
him to have a “coherent and sustainable strategy” to defeat Hamas.</p>
<p>‘Don’t do it’</p>
<p>Netanyahu insists that the goal of “total victory” against Hamas
cannot be achieved without going into Rafah, where Israel says there are
four Hamas battalions composed of thousands of fighters.</p>
<p>Initially, the Biden administration said they would not support a
Rafah offensive without sufficient protection of civilians.</p>
<p>Now, they’re telling Israel, “Don’t do it,” said Aaron David Miller,
senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and
former U.S. negotiator in Middle East peace talks.</p>
<p>“It’s not now a question of making sure that the population is
somehow safeguarded,” he told VOA. “They just don’t want the Israelis to
do it.”</p>
<p>Despite the pressure piled on Gallant this week, the decision on
Rafah would have to be taken by the Israeli War Cabinet, whose members
in addition to Gallant include Netanyahu and Benny Gantz, former
minister of defense and deputy prime minister, as well as two observers
— opposition politician Gadi Eisenkot and Ron Dermer, Netanyahu’s close
adviser.</p>
<p>Gallant’s meetings have been the main high-level consultation
mechanism between the U.S. and its ally, as Netanyahu abruptly canceled
plans for a visit by a separate Israeli delegation.</p>
<p>That was done in protest of Washington’s abstention at the U.N. that
allowed the adoption of a Security Council resolution demanding an
immediate cease-fire in Gaza and the release of hostages held by
Hamas.</p>
<p>Netanyahu accused the U.S. of shifting from its prior position of
conditioning the cease-fire call on the release of hostages, which the
administration denies.</p>
<p>More weapons</p>
<p>Gallant, a security hawk who supports a ground operation in Rafah,
had aimed to use his Washington visit to ramp up the transfer of
American weapons. In remarks ahead of his meeting with Austin, he said
he wants to “ensure Israel’s military edge and capabilities.”</p>
<p>Israel needs U.S. arms not only for the campaign in Gaza but also to
prepare for further escalation in the north of the country with
Hezbollah in Lebanon, said Brian Finucane, senior adviser for the U.S.
Program at the International Crisis Group. Since the Oct. 7 Hamas
attacks, the two sides have exchanged fire through thousands of rocket
and missile launches.</p>
<p>“The U.S. has real leverage here,” Finucane told VOA. “The best-case
scenario would be if the U.S. actually did use its abundant leverage,
both unilaterally and multilaterally, to try to bring about a
cease-fire.”</p>
<p>While Biden has begun using his diplomatic leverage by abstaining at
the U.N., he is unlikely to condition or restrict military aid to Israel
as he aims to keep the conflict from spreading.</p>
<p>“The last thing he should want to do is to send an unmistakable
signal to Hezbollah and Iran that we’re not prepared to back the
Israelis, if, in fact, there is an escalation in the Israeli northern
border,” said Miller.</p>
<p>The most fundamental goal for Biden right now, he said, is reaching a
deal in the cease-fire negotiations in Qatar. Hamas says it will release
hostages only as part of a deal that would end the war, while Israel
says it will discuss only a temporary pause.</p>
<p>US arms for Israel</p>
<p>The U.S. has committed to provide Israel with nearly $4 billion a
year in aid through 2028, most of it in the form of military assistance.
Approximately $3.3 billion per year is given under the Foreign Military
Financing program, funds that Israel must use to purchase U.S. military
equipment and services.</p>
<p>Since the Gaza war began, the administration has quietly delivered
more than 100 separate foreign military sales to Israel. The arms
transfers were processed without public debate because the
administration broke up the sales packages in amounts below the
threshold that requires them to notify Congress, according to a defense
official who spoke to VOA on the condition of anonymity to discuss a
sensitive military matter.</p>
<p>Under pressure from Democratic lawmakers, last month the White House
released a National Security Memorandum requiring the U.S. secretary of
state to “obtain credible and reliable written assurances” from foreign
governments that U.S. weapons are used in accordance with international
and humanitarian law.</p>
<p>Gallant delivered Israel’s required written assurances ahead of the
deadline on Sunday. Under the memorandum, the State Department has until
early May to formally assess and report to Congress whether those
assurances are “credible and reliable.” Without it, Biden has the option
of suspending further U.S. arms transfers.</p>
<p>So far, Biden has not indicated any willingness to do so. In his call
with Netanyahu last week, the president “didn’t make threats,” Sullivan
said. “Each of them recognizes that we are at a critical moment in this
conflict.”</p>

hosting HAZMAT drill Wednesday </h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-27, from: The Signal</p>
<p>
L.A. County Fire Department officials don’t want residents to be alarmed
if they see any activity or hear any alarms on Wednesday coming from
HASA Inc., the longtime pool chemical manufacturer in Saugus.   It’s
just a drill.  The agency’s Hazardous Materials Response Team is
conducting a drill from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. to simulate […]

<p>date: 2024-03-27, from: The Signal</p>
<p>
A wet winter is carrying into the spring, with the Santa Clarita Valley
expected to stay dry during the week and then get another round of rain
throughout the weekend.  Even considering the rain the SCV has had this
year, it’s a little unusual to get rain this late, said National Weather
Service meteorologist Robbie […]

<h2 id="remembering-simon-riggs">Remembering Simon Riggs</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-27, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
The PostgreSQL Core Team is deeply saddened by the loss of our long-time
friend and colleague Simon Riggs on the 26th of March, 2024.
</p>
<p>
Simon was responsible for many of the enterprise features we find in
PostgreSQL today, including point in time recovery, hot standby, and
synchronous replication. He was the founder of 2ndQuadrant which
employed many of the PostgreSQL developers, later becoming part of EDB
where he worked as a Postgres Fellow until his retirement. He was
responsible for the UK PostgreSQL conferences for many years until he
passed that responsibility to PostgreSQL Europe last year.
</p>
<p>
Simon’s last community contribution was the presentation of the keynote
at PostgreSQL Conference Europe 2023 in Prague, which you can watch
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8W-J36IxYv4">on YouTube</a>.
</p>
<p>
Simon will be sorely missed by everyone that knew him, and the
PostgreSQL Project offers its deepest sympathies to his family and
friends at this time.
