## 2024-08-09 NNCP setup automation

date: 2024-08-09, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-08-09-nncp-setup-automation">2024-08-09 NNCP setup automation</h1>

<p>This is a continuation of <a href="2024-07-16-minimal-nncp-setup">the minimal NNCP setup to get started</a>.
Once we verified that everything works as expected with manual invocations, the next step is automation. There are two options:</p>

<ul>
<li>Enable all the services. This makes sense if you expect a lot of traffic.</li>
<li>Only call the executables every now and then. This makes sense if you expect very little traffic.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to enable all the services, the <code>examples</code> directory has service definitions for you.
Running <code>nncp-caller</code> only makes sense if there is at least one entry in your <code>/etc/nncp.hjson</code> that has a <code>cron</code> key.</p>

<pre><code>sudo systemctl enable /usr/share/doc/nncp/examples/nncp-daemon.service
sudo systemctl enable /usr/share/doc/nncp/examples/nncp-caller.service
sudo systemctl enable /usr/share/doc/nncp/examples/nncp-toss.service
sudo systemctl start nncp-daemon.service 
sudo systemctl start nncp-caller.service
sudo systemctl start nncp-toss.service 
sudo systemctl status nncp-daemon.service 
sudo systemctl status nncp-caller.service
sudo systemctl status nncp-toss.service 
</code></pre>

<p>I don&rsquo;t expect a lot of NNCP traffic. This is why my setup on the laptop and server uses the alternative.</p>

<p>In order to conserve resources, you could decide not to have these services running all the time.
I&rsquo;m doing this for two reasons: I don&rsquo;t want to upgrade the virtual machine I&rsquo;m renting. It&rsquo;s a point of pride to do much with very little. From the perspective of impeding collapse, I also think that we should all get on board with <a href="https://wimvanderbauwhede.codeberg.page/articles/frugal-computing-developer/">frugal computing</a> (<a class="account" href="https://scholar.social/@wim_v12e" title="@wim_v12e@scholar.social">@wim_v12e</a>).</p>

<p>Ready for some frugal computing? Here we go.</p>

<p>Run the daemon on the server. That is, if other sites know your internet address and call you, then you need this. My laptop does not but my server does. When somebody calls the server on port 5400, start the <code>nncp-daemon</code> using <code>inetd</code> (from the <code>openbsd-inet</code> or the <code>inetutils-inetd</code> packages on Debian).</p>

<p>In your <code>/etc/inetd.conf</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>5400	stream	tcp	nowait	nncp	/usr/bin/nncp-daemon	nncp-daemon -quiet -ucspi
</code></pre>

<p>Run <code>nncp-call</code> every hour or every day from cron for the systems you want to call.
Those systems don&rsquo;t need a <code>cron</code> key in the <code>/etc/nncp.hjson</code> file.</p>

<p>This is my laptop calling my server every hour, via <code>/etc/cron.hourly/nncp</code>:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
if [ -x /usr/bin/nncp-call ]; then
        su nncp -s /bin/sh -c &quot;/usr/bin/nncp-call sibirocobombus -noprogress&quot;
fi
</code></pre>

<p>This is on the laptop, for my neighbours <code>erebor</code> and <code>quux</code> in <code>/etc/cron.daily/nncp</code>:</p>

<pre><code>if [ -x /usr/bin/nncp-call ]; then
    for neighbour in erebor quux; do
        su nncp -s /bin/sh -c &quot;/usr/bin/nncp-call erebor -noprogress&quot;
    done
fi
</code></pre>

<p>This is for the server, tossing stuff once per hour, via <code>/etc/cron.hourly/nncp</code>:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
if [ -x /usr/bin/nncp-toss ]; then
	su nncp -s /bin/sh -c &quot;/usr/bin/nncp-toss&quot;
fi
</code></pre>

<p>Adding <code>autotoss: true</code> only helps for the system calling others. On the server, tossing needs to happen on a regular basis.</p>

<p>Finally, you can do some clean-up by copying <code>/usr/share/doc/nncp/examples/cron-daily-nncp</code> to <code>/etc/cron.daily/nncp-cleanup</code>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m using the following, both on the laptop and the server:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

if [ -x /usr/bin/nncp-rm ]; then
    for TYPE in part seen hdr area; do
            su nncp -s /bin/bash -c &quot;nncp-rm -quiet -all -older 7d -$TYPE&quot;
    done
    su nncp -s /bin/bash -c &quot;nncp-rm -quiet -tmp -older 7d&quot;
fi
</code></pre>

**@Dave Winer's linkblog** (date: 2024-08-09, from: Dave Winer's linkblog)

This startup&#39;s plan makes me nauseous. As if the big problem in AI is compensating rentiers for their supposed losses due to AI apps. The information that news reports on does not belong to anyone. Bill Gross already has enough money. Instead, maybe he should find innovative ways to give it away.

## COSMIC alpha released

date: 2024-08-09, from: OS News

After two year of development, System76 has released the very first alpha of COSMIC, their new Rust-based desktop environment for Linux. This is an alpha release, so they make it clear there&#8217;s going to be bugs and that there&#8217;s a ton of missing features at this point. As a whole, COSMIC is a comprehensive operating system GUI (graphical user interface) environment that features advanced functionality and a responsive design. Its modular architecture is specifically designed to facilitate the creation of unique, branded user experiences with ease. ↫ System76 website Don&#8217;t read too much into &#8220;branded experience&#8221; here &#8211; it just means other Linux distributions can easily use their colours, branding, and panel configurations. The settings application is also entirely modular, so distributors can easily add additional panels, and replace things like the update panel with one that fits their package management system of choice. COSMIC also supports extensive theming, and if you&#8217;re wondering &#8211; yes, all of these are answers to the very reason COSMIC was made in the first place: GNOME&#8217;s restrictiveness. There&#8217;s not much else to say here yet, since it&#8217;s an alpha release, but if you want to give it a go, the announcement post contains links to instructions for a variety of Linux distributions. COSMIC is also slowly making its way into Redox, the Rust-based operating system led by Jeremy Soller, a System76 employee.

## Biden set to share a legacy with LBJ

date: 2024-08-09, from: VOA News USA

U.S. President Joe Biden’s decision to pass the Democratic Party’s torch to Vice President Kamala Harris makes him a lame-duck president – one who remains in office without any hope of an additional term. VOA’s chief national correspondent Steve Herman at the White House looks at how Biden’s legacy may eventually compare to the previous one-term president who did not run for reelection.

After past volcanic eruptions, some plant species evolved to survive, some migrated to cooler climates, but others were wiped out entirely. The authors found that damages to vegetation made global warming worse in the past. “This study, in my perspective, serves as a ‘wake-up call’ for the global community,” <a href="https://phys.org/news/2024-08-volcanic-eruptions-planet-millions-years.html?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8XMO5OBlewRVON1_jzQD4-k3ueNnLhoOQnadjWAEVSXT1spzpHqRymy6EJoSyrVvgek2Ie" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> co-author Loïc Pellissier, a professor of ecosystems and landscape evolution at ETH Zurich and the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest Snow and Landscape Research. “We are currently releasing greenhouse gases at a faster rate than any previous volcanic event.

## How much sway should the president have over interest rates?

date: 2024-08-09, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>As president, Donald Trump was highly critical of the Federal Reserve and Chairman Jerome Powell. Now, Trump is signaling that he would want to have more say on interest rate decisions should he win the election in November — even though the Fed’s relative independence is seen as a key pillar of U.S. economic strength. Also on the program: how a summer camp is marrying mariachi music with exposure to careers in STEM.</p>

<p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> There’s been a lot of talk about the Olympics&#8217; boost to Paris’ economy, but what about the athletes themselves? The all-encompassing influence of social media looks set to create some surprising winners. And breaking — better known as breakdancing — makes its Olympics debut, yet it’s not in the line-up for the LA games in 2028. Now could be the chance to grab the spotlight and secure some funding.</p>

<hr />
<h2>Let's start from the basics: can you introduce yourself?</h2>
<p>I’m Georgie and I was born and reside in Sydney, Australia. I grew up in the ’burbs, which was something I despised until I moved to a spot closer to the city, and there’s a certain nostalgia that Arcade Fire’s The Suburbs evokes about my childhood that no other album or song has done to date. </p>
<p>My first experience using a computer was when I was probably about four years old, watching my dad type commands into MS-DOS to launch games. When I couldn’t figure out how to load King’s Quest, I would just type <code>dir</code> and press spacebar dozens of times for amusement until my dad came to my aid. These days, I work as a software engineer and I fell into this line of work after teaching myself how to code and build websites, then trying to find data entry jobs, but realising there were actually jobs for building websites.</p>
<p>I’ve competed in two powerlifting competitions (placing third and second), I used to be a concert photographer and a ballerina, I like hiking, and I am passionate about expressing myself through my style and what I wear. One might describe my style as containing deliberate elements of juxtaposition, and a blend of 80s, 90s, punk, and grunge. I am a 90s kid, pretty much, but my interests and knowledge of pop culture give people the impression that I’m an older millennial than I actually am. I also still get ID’d, and it now amuses me since I’m old enough to appreciate it. I’ll take what I can get.</p>
<h2>What's the story behind your blog?</h2>
<p>After playing Neopets in the early 2000s and then getting my account banned because I was transferring items and neopoints to myself from a secondary account, I started blogging on LiveJournal. My website was on a free hosting site, and was my playground for practicing coding and graphic design. I was writing about pretty inane stuff on LiveJournal, and my website was reserved for updates about graphics, trivia and other miscellanea I was adding to my website.</p>
<p>Since I had been writing in a physical diary for most of my childhood and early adolescence, writing stuff online seemed like a fair transition. It was also easier for me to let my friends read my diary if it was on a website they could visit.</p>
<p>After LiveJournal, I blogged on MSN Spaces for a while. My blog was called “Consolation in a Jar”, because I thought the visual of a jar was cute (think those jars full of hand-made paper stars) and also because I was going through a difficult time with severe depression.</p>
<p>I forget what my website’s name was when I first created it, but I settled on the name “Out The Window”. I am pretty sure it came from the Linkin Park song “In The End”. I started blogging about my school life and hobbies, and more emotional posts found their home on Consolation in a Jar.</p>
<p>In 2008 I registered my first domain name, Heartdrops.org. This is the URL at which I gained a lot of notoriety, fame, what have you. MSN Spaces had shut down, and I chose not to save all of the painful posts I’d published. Heartdrops became my main blog, and would be that way for four years. Facebook took off around this time, and I continued to strongly hold the opinion that friends could contact me via phone number or—quite literally—my website that I’d had years before social media.</p>
<p>I started a few other blogs for different creative projects, like photoblogging, letters to friends, and scans of doodling and drawing on paper. I went through a couple of cycles of starting new blogs for specific topics, then pulling them all back into my main blog. Now I like to have everything in the one place and feel free to use my space to write about any topic I want.</p>
<p>I’d been using georgie.nu as a “domain collective”—a website to showcase all of my domains and projects—for three years before I decided to name rename Heartdrops to “Hey Georgie” and use the URL. I was working on an exciting, bold WordPress theme that was a departure from my usual design style, and didn’t suit the name Heartdrops. I started to feel like the name was juvenile and reminded me too much of a difficult time in my life.</p>
<p>My blog has been called Hey Georgie for the past 12 years now. I feel like it suits my personality more accurately. The name just comes from the greeting of “hey” or “hello”, but one of my favourite local bands is called Hey Geronimo as well. I know I must have sounded like a hypocrite when I renamed my blog because I used to diss people who had their name in their website name. I said so much shit online in my youth. But damn, have I learned. I have learned a lot.</p>
<h2>What does your creative process look like when it comes to blogging?</h2>
<p>In my early years of blogging (from the mid to late 2000s), I would just sit at my computer or laptop and write any time I wanted a blog post to happen, or if I had an idea, I would try to write the blog post as soon as possible. My ideas mostly revolved around funny stories from my childhood, or experiences in my day to day as a suburban kid being in the heart of the city for university and social events. I would usually write a 500-word post in 30 minutes or so. I didn’t proofread. It was a combination of being a little bit cocky and confident in my writing skills and speed, and an obsession with posting something every two days. I just wanted to write the blog post and be done, and took pride in having something new to share.</p>
<p>My process is very different these days. I’ve not only matured, but the blog posts I write are less stream-of-consciousness and centre around a specific topic. They take a bit more time because I care about them reading well and being well structured. My writing has matured the same way I’ve matured as a person.</p>
<p>I stopped having the freedom to just drop everything and write as soon as an idea came to mind, so I keep a list of ideas instead. I don’t have as many ideas as I used to. When I think about why, I think it’s that I don’t enjoy writing about the mundanities of life the way that I did as an adolescent. (I promise my life is not boring... haha.) My interest in writing about certain topics also waned. Any time I’m in the mood, I’ll take one of those ideas and just start writing something until I get stuck, then I leave the draft there and come back to it later. Some of those drafts never see the light of day because I give up on the idea, while others are eventually worked on and published. In the past, I had the mentality of a completist and anything I worked on was published, even if I thought it sucked. I still don’t proofread too meticulously, and sometimes I even do it after I’ve published a post, because I am so comfortable with my writing that there will usually only be some small typos. If the topic is a really delicate one, I might ask a couple of close friends to proofread it.</p>
<p>I used to use an app called Bear to help me focus while I was writing. Now I just write most of my posts directly in my WordPress installation or in the Notes app on my iPhone or MacBook. I can’t remember why I abandoned Bear, but I wouldn’t be surprised if it had something to do with paying for features that I refused to pay for.</p>
<h2>Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe the physical space influences your creativity?</h2>
<p>My physical space really influences my ability to write and put a blog post together. I value my noise-cancelling headphones and a bit of stoner rock or hard rock or metal. It’s music that’s energetic enough because of the beat, and I like having the lyrics present, but they don’t feel distracting because the vocals are rough. I also need to be physically comfortable, but this doesn’t necessarily mean I need to be in an armchair in a library. I like cafes, and often work from them, but I can’t write while sitting in a cafe unless it’s during a quieter time of the day and the cafe doesn’t play pop music loudly for ambiance. I can write whilst sitting on a park bench, even if the bench isn’t like a sofa, but maybe there aren’t many people around and the weather is pleasant. I can write from my phone on public transport, as long as I have a long enough journey and am seated by the window.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, I’ve found that I can write better and am more forced to focus during periods of being “in transit”, like sitting in an airport lounge, being on a long-distance ferry, or waiting at a cafe for a friend to arrive because I’m early for our date. It might be because there is a definite end to the time I’m in that place—compared to sitting at home with an entire afternoon ahead of me and falling into procrastination. It is entirely possible that the “forced deadline” created by being in those temporary situations is beneficial for me because of my neurodivergent brain. If I’m at home, I just won’t make a deadline to write a post by, but in some of the scenarios I described, I have no choice.</p>
<h2>A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your tech stack?</h2>
<p>I register most of my domains with NameCheap (I have one on <a href="https://name.com/">Name.com</a>). Before I could afford to pay for my own hosting, I had a friend who set me up on her shared hosting. I bought my own plan at NameCheap after about a decade of her generously letting me use some of her space for free.</p>
<p>I use self-hosted WordPress. I take pride in the fact that I’ve coded my theme myself—it’s not compatible with new features of WordPress and I don’t try to make it that way, as it’s mostly just an outlet for my coding creativity. I remember the days when I had the time, inspiration, and energy to code and update a new theme every two weeks. If I remember correctly, my current theme has been there since 2018, which is a personal record for me. I’m not sure what changed (apart from the obvious, like having more responsibilities in life and already doing coding as part of my day job, etc.). I think I just focused more on the idea of “branding” and simplicity, and that led me to build something that I was happy with long-term.</p>
<p>I know WordPress has an interesting (if not slightly poor) reputation, but I’ve just used it ever since I had my own domain name in the late 00’s, and I decided to stick with it. I’ve had many conversations with friends about why I never converted to a static site generator, or why I don’t do it now. I put too much emphasis on comments and having a comments section, and didn’t want them to be owned by a third-party service. A friend even joked that he’d build something custom for me, but my needs made him give up. Hahah. I have well over 1,500 blog posts and 26,000 comments. The thought of migrating them was not only a tricky problem to solve, but at some point converting them made the possibility of a sunk cost fallacy inevitable. I debated just removing the comment functionality entirely, given that most readers either don’t leave comments, or reach out to me through email or social media to share their thoughts. With the rise of social media-type trolling comments and inauthentic AI-generated ones, perhaps this could be a reason to no longer care about blog post comments...</p>
<h2>Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would you do anything differently?</h2>
<p>I’m not sure that I would do anything too differently, because I’ve owned a blog for so long and the things I would do differently have already been applied, or weren’t too hard to change on an existing blog. For example, the renaming of my blog from Heartdrops to Hey Georgie was pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>If you asked me to start fresh today, perhaps I really would abandon the whole comment thing—hahaha—and then use it as an opportunity to use something that will let me write blog posts more “simply” with Markdown. That’s probably all I’d really change. These days it’s not uncommon for a blog to have no comments section, but it was just such a huge part of me making friends and connections on the internet pre-social media.</p>
<h2>Financial question since the Web is obsessed with money: how much does it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost, or does it generate some revenue? And what's your position on people monetising personal blogs?</h2>
<p>In a year, for domain and hosting, I pay about $80–100 AUD, give or take. The .nu domain is notoriously expensive and costs some $40 a year, but I committed to that when I first got it. Haha. (It’s kind of like the custom licence plate I have for my car; I committed to that several hundred dollar annual payment when I got it, so I keep paying for it because it has sentimental value.) I don’t pay much attention to the actual cost. I just pay for it when it’s due. Even though my frequency of posts don’t suggest this, my blog is my passion project and something I really care about.</p>
<p>I feel very strongly about monetising content in relation to being my authentic self online. The topic first came up for me a while ago, long before social media and living in a world of subscriptions and content creation and ads and things. I first dabbled in sponsored posts and accepting money for links when I only had a job for six hours a week, because I just wanted extra cash. I felt uncomfortable about it though, and I realised that my personal morals were important to me. All my friends were telling me that I should make money from my online space, but it didn’t sound like something I wanted to do. I put a PayPal donate button on my blog and I felt gross, especially after I managed to get more part time jobs. My blog was an outlet for my writing and a place where I put my honest and personal thoughts. It was not a business.</p>
<p>I decided that my blog would always be a space that genuinely represents myself and the things I care about and stand for. I previously accepted payment for certain types of advertisements that I might not agree with today. These days, I accept payment for in-post advertising, and free products in return for honest reviews, but they must be from businesses or companies whose principles I support, or whose products I might actually use.</p>
<p>If other people choose to monetise their blog, I think they have every right to do so. But I will admit that it’s sometimes funny to see advertisements completely unrelated to the blog’s general content. It only bothers me if someone’s blog is littered with ads and content that they obviously paid for. But then I think we are getting into “content creation” territory, which I consider different from people’s personal blogs.</p>
<p>I don’t usually financially support other bloggers. If they have some kind of “buy me a coffee” link, I might buy them a few coffees but it’ll be a once-off. If I get to meet any other bloggers in real life, I am more than happy to buy them a coffee in person. 😊 </p>
<h2>Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth checking out? And also, who do you think I should be interviewing next?</h2>
<p>My good friend Pauline at <a href="https://pawlean.com/">pawlean.com</a>, my friend Jane from <a href="https://lemonandlively.com/">lemonandlively.com</a>, Ruben at <a href="https://rubenerd.com/">rubenerd.com</a>, Jem at <a href="https://jemjabella.co.uk/">jemjabella.co.uk</a>. 💙 I’m sure least one of them might be up for an interview, but I’d gladly read an interview with any of them.</p>
<h2>Final question: is there anything you want to share with us?</h2>
<p>If you’ve read this far, just, thank you. I think there might be some people reading this who know me from when I was literally fifteen years old, too, which is not only astonishing, but really touching to me that there was something about my writing or about me as a person that made you read my blog in the first place. I’ve always liked writing, and unlike other interests and hobbies, it’s a thing that innately stays with you over time.</p>
<p>I have a podcast called <a href="https://toast-and-roast.simplecast.com/">Toast &amp; Roast</a>, a super low budget pod that my friend and I record for fun. It was a mid-pandemic project that has been going for several years, and I think the success of its tenure is to do with the fact that our recording sessions are also the time we chat and catch up. We release episodes weekly. It’s got the same unfiltered vibe that my blog posts have, and we don’t really plan topics. Hopefully we’re the kind of pod you might have playing in the background or just listen to when you don’t feel like paying too much attention. I like to think it’s like eavesdropping on two friends who are just talking shit. But if you’ve ever wanted to put a voice to my face or writing, or whatever… hehe.</p>
<p>You can find me on Instagram at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hey.georgie/">@hey.georgie</a>, where I mostly post outfits and travel pictures. It’s ended up being the platform I use most to interact with internet folk. I joined back when filters were part of the aesthetic, and I think you couldn’t even write a caption? Instagram has continued to be a good way to see what my friends are up to and to message them casually. I was also an early adopter of Twitter and got a lot of value out of it, but it’s no longer the platform it once was. However, you can find me on <a href="https://aus.social/@heygeorgie">Mastodon</a> where I don’t mind posting silly thoughts and banter.</p>
<p>Back in 2020, in the early months of the pandemic, I published a poetry collection called “<a href="https://hey.georgie.nu/tosib/">the off switch is broken</a>”, inspired by my experience as a software engineer, growing up on the internet, and what identity means online. It has themes of discomfort and failure, as well as nostalgia and triumph. Although there are pieces of poetry in the depths of my blog, this was something I created with a lot more intent. I hope you consider taking a look, as I think it documents feelings that we all share.</p>

## more curl help

date: 2024-08-09, from: Daniel Stenberg Blog

With the ever-growing number of command line options for curl, the problem of how to provide documentation and help users understand how options work and should be used is a challenge that is worth revisiting regularly. To keep iterating on. I personally often use the curl manpage to lookup descriptions for options. Often not only &#8230; <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2024/08/09/more-curl-help/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">more curl help</span> <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>

## 2024-08-08 Man pages

date: 2024-08-09, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-08-08-man-pages">2024-08-08 Man pages</h1>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a great thing on the command line. You want to use the command <strong>foo</strong> and don&rsquo;t know how, so you run <strong>man foo</strong> and read the manual page. Sometimes there will be more info in different &ldquo;sections&rdquo;. Commands are in section 1, which is why documentation would sometimes refer to the command &ldquo;foo&rdquo; as <strong>foo(1)</strong> because <strong>foo(5)</strong> might document the file format or the config file that goes along with the command.</p>

<p>If that&rsquo;s news to you, run <strong>man man</strong>. And if you find the structure bewildering, read the manual on how to write manual pages: <strong>man man-pages</strong> (section 7).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve embraced man pages because when I write Perl code, I can put documentation into the script such that when the script is installed, it automatically works as its own man page – this works for <a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/App-jupiter">jupiter</a>, <a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/App-BookmarkFeed">bookmark-feed</a> – it also works for bigger projects, like <a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/App-Phoebe">phoebe</a> where each extension is also a Perl module and therefore also gets its own man page.</p>

<p>For programming languages where the documentation is more focused on documenting the code, things are different. Of course, there&rsquo;s <code>pydoc</code> for Python code and <code>go doc</code> for Go code, but it&rsquo;s not great. The list of variables and functions are maybe suitable for libraries, but not for applications.</p>

<p>Since I don&rsquo;t enjoy writing man pages directly (<code>man</code> is actually a macro package for the <code>nroff</code> language, see <strong>man nroff</strong>, obviously) I write my documentation in the <a href="https://gitlab.com/ddevault/scdoc">scdoc</a> format. <a class="account" href="https://fosstodon.org/@drewdevault" title="@drewdevault@fosstodon.org">@drewdevault</a> wrote it <a href="https://drewdevault.com/2018/05/13/scdoc.html">in 2018</a>. It looks a bit like Markdown and friends and I like it. I even put a little sequence of <code>sed</code> expressions into a Makefile to turn scdoc into Markdown so that I could publish the man pages on this site, see <a href="oddmu/index">Oddµ man pages</a>.</p>

<p>When documentation for a project is a website, I wonder how they serve people offline or with bad connections. Perhaps they want to write the documentation in texinfo? I haven’t done that in a long time but I really enjoy reading a well-written manual like that. And you can get a PDF for free but I’m not sure anybody really wants that. Even a README is bad because in those rare cases where the program gets added to a distro, how will end-users find the README? Man pages are the answer.</p>

<p>README files and offline copies of the HTML documentation have multiple problems.</p>

<ul>
<li>Which directory is it, exactly? <code>/usr/doc</code> does not exist on my system. <code>/usr/share</code> lists lots of package names but these are not the docs. <code>/usr/share/doc</code> is the one! But the problems continue. Which is the file that you want to read when you&rsquo;re faced with <code>BUGS  changelog.Debian.gz  changelog.gz  copyright  README  README.Debian  README.frames  RELEASE-NOTES.txt  WhatsNew.gz</code> – it&rsquo;s README, I guess, but I am always confused. Sometimes you&rsquo;re looking at binary and it&rsquo;s also not obvious what the package name would be. <code>find</code> is in <code>/usr/share/doc/findutils</code>, for example.</li>
</ul>

<p>Compared to this, man pages are so much better.</p>

<p>And some package managers like <code>go</code>, <code>pip</code> (Python), <code>cabal</code> (Haskell) and <code>cargo</code> (Rust) don’t install any of these files, I think.</p>

<p>I suspect that many developers consider using a website like <a href="https://about.readthedocs.com/">Read the Docs</a> to be good enough. Bad luck for people who are offline or who have bad reception, in hotel rooms with bad wifi, in planes? My sister lives in the Rhine valley, on the German side, close to Switzerland, in a tiny village of a bit more than 100 people. They have no glass fibre. They have bad reception, both from Switzerland and from Germany. It&rsquo;s terrible! But even for me: I have wifi in the apartment and glass windows that act that block the signal. I have no reception on the balcony unless I use my phone as a hotspot.</p>

<p>Local documentation that is easy to find is so much better.</p>

<p>And man pages are powerful. <em>All</em> of Perl is documented in many pages. All the modules. All the switches. All the language features. I learned to program in Perl from man pages back when my browser was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCSA_Mosaic">NCSA Mosaic</a>. (I am a bit astonished to find that I still knew that acronym! But I didn’t know that it stands for National Center for Supercomputing Applications.) Anyway, what I wanted to say is that man pages can be used to document large and complex things. From the command line, they are readily accessible. With the right man reader, they can act as a hypertext, linking to other pages. They don’t have to be terse and cryptic, either. Man pages can be tutorials, introductions, FAQs, and more. And if you write man pages using a suitable format, you can still generate HTML pages with links.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re not writing man pages, if your community doesn&rsquo;t have the habit of writing man pages, start small. Get <code>scdoc</code> and write a little something. Skim <strong>man man-pages</strong> and learn about the conventions, then write some text files. Then use <code>scdoc &lt; text-file &gt; man-page</code> to create the file and install them into <code>~/.local/share/man</code>, following the conventions. A page from section 1 (commands) has the extension &ldquo;.1&rdquo; and goes into <code>~/.local/share/man/man1</code> whereas a page from section 5 (file formats and config files) has the extension &ldquo;.5&rdquo; and goes into <code>~/.local/share/man/man5</code>.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Programming">#Programming</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Software">#Software</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Documentation">#Documentation</a></p>

<p><strong>2024-08-09</strong>. At one point I was interested in <a href="2018-03-05_Troff">using troff as an alternative to LaTeX</a>, so not to write documentation but to create PDFs, and I kept eyeing the <a href="http://www.schaffter.ca/mom/mom-01.html">mom macros</a>. But before I could give them a try I discovered how to <a href="2020-07-24_Writing_Markdown,_generating_PDF">create PDFs using Markdown to HTML to PDF</a> via weasyprint and that has been my workflow ever since. For a zine I’m contributing to, however, I’m using <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/groff/">groff</a> and the <a href="https://www.troff.org/using-ms.pdf">ms macros</a> because that’s what’s in the Makefile…</p>

<p>The reason I write this all up is that flexibeast wrote in, saying that man pages can be written using the semantics-oriented <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mdoc.7">mdoc macros</a> instead of the presentation-oriented <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/man.7">man macros</a> – and they had written an <a href="https://github.com/flexibeast/guides/blob/master/mdoc-quickstart.md">mdoc quickstart guide</a>. Nice!</p>

<p>I really have to take a look at <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mandoc.1">mandoc</a> as a groff alternative.</p>

## Huge California wildfire chews through timber in very hot and dry weather

date: 2024-08-09, from: VOA News USA

CHICO, California — California's largest wildfire so far this year continued to grow Thursday as it chewed through timber in very hot and dry weather.


The Park Fire has scorched more than 1,709 square kilometers since erupting July 24 near the Sacramento Valley city of Chico and burning northward up the western flank of the Sierra Nevada. Containment remained at 34%, Cal Fire said.


The conflagration's early explosive growth quickly made it California's fourth-largest wildfire on record before favorable weather reduced its intensity late last week. It reawakened this week due to the heat and very low relative humidity levels.


A large portion of the burned area was in mop-up stage but spot fires were a continuing problem, officials said during Thursday morning's operational briefing.


The fire's northeast corner was the top firefighting priority, operations deputy Jed Gaines said.


"It's not time to celebrate," he said. "We got several more days of hard work to hold what we got in there."


The latest Park Fire assessments found 636 structures destroyed and 49 damaged. A local man was arrested after authorities alleged he started the fire by pushing a burning car into a gully in a wilderness park outside Chico.


About 160 kilometers to the south, a new forest fire in El Dorado County was exhibiting extreme behavior, and some Park Fire aircraft were being diverted there.


The Crozier Fire, about 16 kilometers north of Placerville, had burned more than 5.17 square kilometers of timber and chaparral as of Thursday evening and was just 5% contained. The fire threatens 1,625 structures, according to Cal Fire.

## Giant panda habitat opens at California zoo to much fanfare

date: 2024-08-09, from: VOA News USA

san diego, california — Two Chinese giant pandas are now California residents as their enclosure at the San Diego Zoo opened to the public on Thursday in an international ceremony. 


The pandas, Yun Chuan and Xin Bao, are the first to enter the United States in 21 years and were welcomed by California Governor Gavin Newsom and the Chinese ambassador to the United States, Xie Feng.  


Yun Chuan, a 5-year-old male, is easily recognized by his long, slightly pointed nose, while Xin Bao is a 4-year-old female with big fluffy ears whose name means a "precious treasure of prosperity and abundance." 


Yun Chuan's name means "big river of cloud." His mother, Zhen Zhen, was born at the San Diego Zoo in 2007. 


The zoo is working closely with Chinese experts to help with the adaptation period and understanding of the needs of the two pandas. The pair are enjoying a variety of fresh bamboo and a local adaptation of "wotou," a traditional Chinese steamed cornbread that's also called "panda bread." 


"The arrival of Yun Chuan and Xin Bao, as we celebrate the 45th anniversary of our diplomatic ties, has sent a clear and important message," said Xie.  


"China-U.S. cooperation on panda conservation will not cease. Our people-to- people exchanges and subnational cooperation will not stop, and once opened, the door of China-U.S. friendship will not be shut again," he added. 


Newsom said the new pandas were about "celebrating our common humanity. It's about celebrating the things that bind us together." 


"And so, for me, this spirit of pride that is associated with this opening today with the experience that so many will have, that we just had at Panda Ridge, is about a deeper meaning," Newsom added. 


Visitors of all ages to Panda Ridge on Thursday were exuberant about the pandas' cuteness. 


"I have never seen a panda before. I've only seen them on TV and nature documentaries," said Kobi Davis from Michigan. "They are super cute. They just kind of laze around, you know. There's charm in that."  


Keena Butcher from Canada called them "quiet, thoughtful creatures, and just realize we can have hope for our future if we can conserve them."  


China's Communist government has long used "panda diplomacy" to enhance the country's soft power, lending the large but cuddly looking black-and-white bears to zoos in various countries over the decades as goodwill animal ambassadors. 


In late 2023, Washington's National Zoo said goodbye to its beloved giant pandas, which were returned to China amid heightened tensions between the two global superpowers. 


In May this year, the National Zoo said China would send two young pandas to Washington by the end of the year.

Renting a GPU in the cloud, especially with a bare-metal host can be expensive, and even if the hourly rate looks reasonable, over the course of a year, it can really add up. Many of us have a server or workstation at home with a GPU that can be used for serving models with an open source project like Ollama.

## What the YIMBY Movement Can Teach the Climate Movement

date: 2024-08-08, from: Heatmap News

While Schleicher typically writes about housing, his latest work — an essay literally called “<a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f6103f36b5eee6bf0ab2c1d/t/66b2940a3d75643360f4494a/1722979338415/17.3_Schleicher_Why+Can%27t+We+Build.pdf" target="_blank"><u>Why Can’t We Build?</u></a>” for the <em><em>New York University Journal of Law and Liberty</em></em> — is useful for thinking about why we don't have as much green energy infrastructure as we need<strong>. </strong>“Despite a generation of low interest rates and innovation in many non-physical realms,” he writes, “there are few physical monuments that we will pass to future generations — where are today’s Brooklyn Bridges or Hoover Dams?”</p><p>There are certainly <em>explanations</em> for this lack of infrastructural boldness. But more importantly, what are the <em>reasons<strong></strong></em> for it?<br/></p><p><strong></strong>The explanations are often local restrictions on growth. When it comes to housing, that might mean zoning regulations that limit what kind of structures can be built where or fees that are sometimes charged to multifamily units. For renewable energy, developers of wind and solar might find themselves coming up against noise restrictions, rules that essentially require <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/news/press/2023/news-release-nrel-analysis-quantifies-impacts-of-setback-ordinances-on-land-available-for-renewable-energy-deployment.html" target="_blank">minimum amounts of land for installations</a>, or even <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/graphics/2024/02/27/renewable-energy-sources-ban-map/72630315007/#:~:text=Statewide%20blocks%20and%20limits%20put,energy%20by%202035%20at%20risk&text=A%20nationwide%20analysis%20by%20USA,than%20they're%20building%20it." target="_blank"><u>outright bans on certain types of generation</u></a>.</p><p>But that doesn’t explain why these rules exist — the reasons why infrastructure doesn’t get built. As for these, he told me, most of them come down to the structural factors of local politics. “Statewide majorities have policy preferences” that often support development, Schleicher said. But local a body of government institutions that have been built up since the 1970s “have limited the capacity of those stated statewide preferences to be reflected in policy in many places.”</p><p>When it comes to zoning, Schleicher told me, proponents of reform “make arguments at the local level, but they’re very simply turning to the state level because the issue is larger than any individual jurisdiction.” The same goes for renewable energy. </p><p>If you ask people across an entire state if they want more housing or renewable energy, they will likely say yes. But local elections — which typically have comparatively low participation and are more likely to be decided on national party lines than on local policy issues — rarely reflect this political reality. With a lack of direct checks from the electorate, interest and advocacy groups have outsize weight on local policymaking. </p><p>Local governments have a variety of structures meant to discourage growth and systematically prioritize the views of those with the time and inclination to show up to local meetings — not just those who show up to vote every two or four years. Decisionmaking on individual projects may be dominated by homeowners or local environmental groups that don’t want to see any building or change in the built environment.</p><p>Statewide policymaking, on the other hand, “can bring different interest groups to the fore,” Schleicher told me, including labor and large employers. When Michigan, for instance, passed a suite of clean energy bills in 2023 with support from labor, it allowed the state to take over permitting for large clean energy projects <a href="https://blogs.law.columbia.edu/climatechange/2024/08/07/michigans-new-siting-process-gives-some-authority-to-state-regulators-but-under-what-circumstances/" target="_blank">if the applicable local rules are too restrictive</a>.</p><p>California, too, has passed a series of <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/make-or-break-clean-energy" target="_self"><u>laws</u></a> centralizing <a href="https://www.energy.ca.gov/programs-and-topics/topics/power-plants/opt-certification-program" target="_blank">renewable energy permitting</a> and limiting the appeals that advocacy groups can make to block projects, which Governor Gavin Newsom has already <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2024/02/09/governor-newsom-streamlines-riverside-energy-project-set-to-provide-clean-power-for-650000-homes/#:~:text=This%20key%20tool%20to%20cut,legal%20challenges%20to%20be%20heard." target="_blank">put to work</a>. Earlier this year, he essentially fast-tracked a <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/make-or-break-clean-energy" target="_self"><u>400 megawatt solar project in Riverside County</u></a> by giving opponents <a href="https://www.desertsun.com/story/news/environment/2024/02/09/newsom-limits-appeals-of-controversial-desert-solar-project/72540440007/" target="_blank">just nine months</a> to petition against its approval. </p><p><span></span>In all likelihood, however, Michigan will have to pass more new laws and regulations to speed up renewable development in any meaningful way. “Realistically, one of the other things that the zoning story has taught us that may be relevant for clean energy is that it's almost never does one law do the trick,” Schleicher told me. When states <em>have</em> tried to boost housing production, he pointed out, it has often required several rounds of legislation to get a meaningful boost in production as local opponents of new housing adapt to new laws.</p><p>California<strong>,</strong> again, provides a helpful example. The state is in the midst of a massive building boom in so-called accessory dwelling units, a.k.a. “granny flats” or ADUs. Housing advocates in the state credit this not just to <a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/accessory-dwelling-units-adus-in-california/" target="_blank"><u>a set of bills passed in 2016</u></a> preempting certain local regulations including setbacks, some parking requirements, and fees for utility connections that discouraged their construction, but also to <a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/accessory-dwelling-units-adus-in-california/" target="_blank">11 more bills</a> passed by 2022, methodically clearing out local restrictions on building, renting, and selling ADUs. </p><p>And this was just the latest chapter in the effort to encourage the building of ADUs — the first bill trying to get around local bans in California <a href="https://furmancenter.org/files/Evaluating_California%E2%80%99s_Accessory_Dwelling_Unit_Reforms_508.pdf" target="_blank"><u>passed in 1982</u></a>. Forty years later, however, there were still only 1,000 permitted ADUs in the whole state. As of 2022, the state had registered 82,000 ADUs, a fifth of all housing produced in the state that year, <a href="https://cayimby.org/reports/california-adu-reform-a-retrospective/" target="_blank"><u>according to CA YIMBY, a housing advocacy group</u></a>.</p><p>"The first couple times statewide ADU bills were passed, local governments would come up with other ways to stop things," Schleicher said.  </p><p>Something similar has and likely will continue to happen as states try to wrest siting for renewables projects from local governments. In New York, a 1972 law the governing the siting of power plants has gone through many different iterations. This law, known as Article 10, was changed in 2010 to apply to smaller generators and therefore include renewables projects. Article 10 created a “siting board” that could permit renewables projects under a fast-track process that exempted them from environmental impact statements required by the State Environmental Quality Review Act. The Board would even be allowed to waive “unreasonably burdensome” local laws restricting renewables development. </p><p>But the new process did little to speed permitting. What was intended to be a one- to two-year process instead turned “more lengthy and challenging than originally anticipated,” <a href="https://renewable-energy.mit.edu/blog/research-report-state-preemption" target="_blank"><u>according to</u></a> Massachusetts Institute of Technology researchers Lawrence Susskind and Anushree Chaudari. By 2018, Columbia University professor Michael Gerrard and then Arnold & Porter partner Edward McTiernan <a href="https://climate.law.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/content/docs/Michael%20Gerrard/070051815-Arnold.pdf" target="_blank"><u>wrote</u></a>, a single project had been approved under the new system. </p><p>New York passed a new law in 2020, which included fixed timelines for review. The new process, while relatively new, has managed to get some local rules on renewable siting <a href="https://pragmaticenvironmentalistofnewyork.blog/2021/06/17/ny-office-of-renewable-energy-siting-heritage-wind-decision/" target="_blank"><u>thrown out as</u></a> “unreasonably burdensome,” and <a href="https://www.lohud.com/story/news/2022/10/12/upstate-ny-towns-push-back-against-wind-and-solar-projects/65411544007/" target="_blank"><u>opponents to wind and solar</u></a> projects <a href="https://www.rochesterfirst.com/news/local-news/rush-residents-share-thoughts-on-horseshoe-solar-project/" target="_blank"><u>have lost out</u></a> in front of the new siting board.</p><p>As <a href="https://cbs6albany.com/news/local/ny-not-on-track-to-meet-extraordinarily-ambitious-climate-goals-report-shows-new-york-governor-kathy-hochul-emissions-clcpa-bloomberg-new-york-state-electricity-renewable-resources" target="_blank">New York state struggles</a> to meet its ambitious goals for decarbonization, it will likely need to reform land use and permitting regulations again, and again, and again, along with every other state. </p><p>“Remember that you’re in a long fight instead of a short one,” Schleicher told me. “One of the most important things is to be able to pass successive bills because local opponents to statewide efforts are going to adapt and change and respond.”</p>

## US stock markets rally; S&P 500 sees best day since 2022

date: 2024-08-08, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — U.S. stocks rallied Thursday in Wall Street's latest sharp swerve after a better-than-expected report on unemployment eased worries about a slowing economy. 


The S&P 500 jumped 2.3% for its best day since 2022 and shaved off all but 0.5% of its loss from what was a brutal start to the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 683 points, or 1.8%, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 2.9% as Nvidia and other Big Tech stocks helped lead the way. 


Treasury yields also climbed in the bond market in a signal that investors are feeling less worried about the economy after a report showed fewer U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week. The number was better than economists expected. 


It was exactly a week ago that worse-than-expected data on unemployment claims helped enflame worries that the Federal Reserve has kept interest rates too high for too long in order to beat inflation. That helped send markets reeling worldwide, along with a rate hike by the Bank of Japan that sent shockwaves worldwide by scrambling a favorite trade among some hedge funds. 


At the worst of it, at least so far, the S&P 500 was down nearly 10% from its all-time high set last month. Such drops are regular occurrences on Wall Street, and corrections of 10% happen roughly every year or two. After Thursday's jump, the index is back within about 6% of its record. 


What made this decline particularly scary was how quickly it happened. A measure of how much investors are paying to protect themselves from future drops for the S&P 500 briefly surged toward its highest level since the COVID crash of 2020. 


Still, the market's swings look more like a "positioning-driven crash" caused by too many investors piling into similar trades and then exiting them together, rather than the start of a long-term downward market caused by a recession, according to strategists at BNP Paribas.

## Five arrested over attack that wounded US troops in Iraq air base, statement says

date: 2024-08-08, from: VOA News USA

CAIRO — Security forces have arrested five people in connection with an attack this week at a military base in Iraq in which five U.S. troops and two U.S. contractors were wounded, Iraqi officials said on Thursday. 


The arrests were announced by the Iraqi Security Media Cell, an official body responsible for disseminating security information. 


"After in-depth legal investigations and listening to witnesses' statements ... five of those involved in this illegal act were arrested," the Security Media Cell added in a statement. 


In Monday's attack, two Katyusha rockets were fired at Ain al-Asad air base in the west of the country. On Tuesday, Iraq's military condemned what it called "reckless" actions against bases on its soil and said it had captured a truck with a rocket launcher. 


The attack came as the Middle East braced for a possible new wave of attacks by Iran and its allies following last week's killing of senior members of militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah. 


It was unclear whether the incident in Iraq was linked to threats by Iran to retaliate over the killing in Tehran of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh. 


Iraq is a rare ally of both the U.S. and Iran. It hosts 2,500 U.S. troops and has Iran-backed militias linked to its security forces. It has witnessed escalating tit-for-tat attacks since the Israel-Hamas war erupted in Gaza in October. 


Iraq wants troops from the U.S.-led military coalition to begin withdrawing in September and to formally end the coalition's work by September 2025, Iraqi sources have said, with some U.S. forces likely to remain in a newly negotiated advisory capacity.

## After recent challenges, US looks to rethink AFRICOM, aid initiatives

date: 2024-08-08, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The United States on Wednesday completed one of the last major troop departures from Niger ahead of the military junta-imposed September 15 deadline. About 1,000 troops were stationed in Niger before the ruling leadership’s order to leave.


A joint statement from the Nigerien Defense Ministry and the U.S. military said personnel and equipment from the base had been withdrawn and coordination would continue over the coming weeks to make sure the pullout is complete.


“The effective cooperation and communication between the U.S. and Nigerien armed forces ensured that this turnover was completed ahead of schedule and without complications.”


In an interview with VOA’s Anthony LaBruto, U.S. Representative Michael McCaul, the Republican chairman of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, details how the United States is reevaluating its military presence in light of the troop departures as well as recent challenges to its broader security initiatives on the continent.


The conversation has been edited for brevity and clarity.


VOA: What role does the United States Africa Command, or AFRICOM, play in the continent? In what capacity do AFRICOM's teams serve in different countries in Africa and how is it helping to stabilize democracy?


U.S. Representative Michael McCaul: I just met with AFRICOM. I had a briefing from them. So, this is a very timely interview. They're primarily military. That's why in 2019, I introduced the Global Fragility Act. ... And to your point, it forces [AFRICOM] to go beyond just being a military organization. It forces them to coordinate with states and with the United States Agency for International Development together on the African continent, and that’s very helpful if they’re working together rather than independently with their own missions. When I was at AFRICOM, they talked about it a lot, how that bill has really changed the way they operate.


VOA: I noticed that when the head of Africa Command testified before your committee, he mentioned that military presence in Africa should go alongside diplomatic and aid efforts on the continent. Can you elaborate on how these different elements are coordinated and their overall impact on the region?


McCaul: Look, the military is important. But that’s not going to win this alone, right? I mean, when you have economic ties, they strengthen our alliances and that's where I think the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation can be helpful.


And then of course USAID, you know, we provide our humanitarian assistance. I passed the branding bill, which requires the American flag to be on this, so that they know where the aid is coming from, because prior to that, they didn’t know where it’s coming from. Now, if China brings in the [diplomatic] systems, their flags are everywhere and so now USAID has the American flag. They know where it’s coming from. That really helps in diplomacy.


I would also throw trade in there. If we could get back to having some trade agreements, which we haven’t done, quite frankly, under this administration. Of course, the military we need. They provide the security umbrella to provide the soft power — that being diplomatic and economic assistance.


VOA: What are the U.S. military's strategies for countering threats in countries like Somalia and Kenya, and how do these efforts support and integrate with aid projects in the region?


McCaul: We have counterterrorism operations — that’s where AFRICOM comes in — but they’re overstretched and overburdened. Their role in coordinating with the State Department and USAID is to provide that security piece. ... But when you have Niger kicking us out, there's nothing we can do. We can’t operate within countries.


You look at Somalia, I mean our presence there is ... quite frankly, that embassy is so dangerous you can’t even drive to it, you have to fly in. That’s probably the most dangerous embassy in the world right now. And now, with the events of the Houthi rebels joining forces with al-Shabab, it’s even worse. I really worry about that embassy. ... They have a lot of security there, and it's probably the most secure embassy in the world, but still. I mean, what good is that presence if you can’t really operate out of the country?


VOA: With the military or AFRICOM being challenged so much, is the U.S. rethinking any of its military or aid policies on the continent?


McCaul: They are [being challenged], and it's a resource issue; it’s a big continent. There's not much we can do if the country doesn't want us there. They kicked the French out of Mali, in the Sahel regions, they’re gone.


They have this anti-colonialism attitude that goes back to the French, and I understand that, and they probably look at us [similarly] in some respects. We want them to look at us as a liberator, not an occupier, but they do have a sense of, ‘Oh, the colonials are coming back in,’ certainly with the French, probably less so with the Americans, but we still have that issue.


The AFRICOM General [Michael] Langley warned that the loss of U.S. bases in the Sahel will “degrade our ability to do active watching and warning, including for the homeland defense.” Right now, the terrorist organizations in Africa are more focused on Africa and not external operations, but we always have to be mindful of that, that any of these terror operations can go operational, external operations, if that’s the direction they want to go. Right now, I’m not sure they have that capacity to conduct external operations necessarily over here, but it’s something we have to continue to watch.


This Q&A originated in VOA’s English to Africa Service.

<p>The <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico-2/">$5 Raspberry Pi Pico 2</a> was announced today, with a new chip, the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/rp2350/">RP2350</a>. This silicon improves on almost every aspect of the RP2040:</p>

<ul>
<li>3 PIOs instead of 2</li>
<li>150 MHz instead of 133 MHz base clock</li>
<li>Faster Arm Cortex M33 cores <em>and</em> RISC-V Hazard3 cores</li>
</ul>

<p>I've had access to pre-release hardware and good news: even though the new chip is faster and has more features, it actually uses <em>less</em> power than RP2040, meaning if you run one of these things off a battery, it'll last longer.</p>

<p>I'll talk more about power later, but first, here's the specs.</p>

## Houthis undeterred despite US action to protect Red Sea shipping

date: 2024-08-08, from: VOA News USA

Washington — U.S.-led efforts to thwart attacks on international shipping by Iranian-backed Houthi militants in Yemen are nothing more than a “shock absorber” and are unlikely to lead to stability or safer seas, according to a senior U.S. commander.


Vice Admiral George Wikoff, who heads the U.S. naval efforts in the Middle East, shared the blunt assessment Wednesday, saying that not only have U.S. strikes and defensive efforts done little to change the Houthis’ behavior, it now appears unlikely the group will be swayed by military force.


“The solution is not going to come at the end of a weapon system,” Wikoff told an audience in Washington, speaking via video from U.S. 5th Fleet headquarters in Bahrain.


“We have certainly degraded their capability. There's no doubt about that. We've degraded their ability,” he said. “However, have we stopped them? No.”


The comments build on other U.S. assessments that have questioned the ability of the United States and its allies to stop the Houthis from targeting commercial ships transiting the Red Sea, which account for up to 15% of international maritime trade.


An unclassified report issued this past June by the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, or DIA, found container shipping in the region plunged by 90% from December 2023 through mid-February 2024.


It also warned that despite U.S. and European countermeasures, such as the U.S.-led Operation Prosperity Guardian and the European Union’s ASPIDES mission, the Houthis still carried out more than 43 attacks between November 19 and March 23, driving up security costs and insurance premiums.




Wikoff on Wednesday said U.S. forces have seen some signs of stabilization since February but called it an “unacceptable stabilization,” with the number of ships crossing the Bab el Mandeb Strait, which connects the Red Sea with the Gulf of Aden, still down by about half.


Yet the attacks and threats to commercial shipping and U.S. forces in the region persist.


Houthi officials Wednesday claimed they launched attacks on a container ship and on two U.S. military vessels, although a U.S. defense official told VOA there was no “operational reporting to support those claims."


Separately, U.S. Central Command, which oversees American troops in the Middle East, has said its forces have destroyed seven Houthi aerial drones, seven Houthi missiles, one Houthi naval drone and one Houthi missile launcher, all in the past five days.


“It's a struggle we have every day to try to figure out where are we on the meter with regards to stability in the region,” Wikoff said.


The Houthis have said their campaign in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden is to show solidarity with the Palestinians in Gaza amid the war between Israel and Hamas.


But Wikoff pushed back against that notion, noting Houthi attacks on shipping predate the war while describing the U.S.-designated terror group as “a weapon looking for a reason to use it.”


And if the Houthis have anything they value enough that they do not want to risk using it, the U.S. and its partners have yet to find it.


“It's very difficult to find a centralized center of gravity that we can hold at risk over time and use that as a potential point of deterrence,” Wikoff said. “So, trying to apply a classic deterrence policy in this particular scenario is a bit challenging.”


It is an argument some experts have been making for months.


“We have very little leverage over the Houthis, and air strikes are unlikely to deter them,” according to Elisabeth Kendall, a Yemen specialist at the University of Cambridge in Britain.


“They have a high tolerance for casualties, they are highly adaptable, they do not need sophisticated weapons to wreak havoc, they just need to keep going — not losing is winning, and they believe they have God on their side,” she told VOA via email. “In reality, air strikes by the U.S. and U.K. benefit the Houthis by providing evidence to back up their propaganda narratives against the U.S. and its allies.”


But other experts, such as former British Ambassador to Yemen Edmund Fitton-Brown, are more critical of the approach taken by the U.S. and its allies in trying to degrade and dissuade the Houthi attacks.


The U.S.-led responses have been “meticulously proportionate,” said Fitton-Brown, now a senior adviser for the New York and Berlin-based Counter Extremism Project.


“We need to be more determined and creative about what to do about this,” he said. “We are looking at a de facto authority, and a de facto authority has fixed points you can attack.”


“They have military bases that were previously in the hands of the government. They have intelligence headquarters. They have security deployments in [the port city of] Hodeidah,” Fitton-Brown told VOA. “Significant escalation of targeting is possible without changing the legal status of the conflict.”


The U.S. vice admiral in charge of U.S. naval forces in the region, however, is wary that military force will ultimately move the Houthis.


“Our mission remains to disrupt their ability and try to preserve some semblance of maritime order while we give an opportunity for policy to be developed against the Houthis,” Wikoff said. “The more players in the field that can get involved in a diplomatic piece of this, the better off I think we'll be.”

<p>To keep me and my brain running during working hours costs me ~$359.26/month. Not much to say beyond that –no grand epiphanies– except that I think it’s too expensive. Sitting in an office by myself costs me $16.33/day (or $2/hour). This budget doesn’t include breakfast, dinner, exercise, healthcare, transit, internet, electricity, or office supplies… all necessities that enable the work. This is just the daily cost of caloric fuel to keep my body going during the nine-to-five. My family has three other humans in it too, so this seems collossaly expensive.</p>
<p>If I wanted to save money (I sort of do), here’s what I’d could try to optimize from top to bottom:</p>
<ul>
<li>I could make my own pre-made meals for about ~$2/meal. I’ve had success with this but it requires a lot of weekend logistics to execute properly. This would be the most significant cost reduction, costing only $44/month and saving $176/month.</li>
<li>I could buy whey protein in bulk. A 5 lb bag of Muscle Milk (nearest approximate flavor) is $72/bag and contains 68 servings for a reduced costs of $1.05/serving. However, one serving only has 25g of protein, so if I’d need to double the scoops. The total cost would then be $2.11/serving or $46.42/month. Buying bulk powder makes fiscal sense, but $30/month to not have to deal with drinking clumpy protein shakes and washing crusted stinky shakers seems almost worth it.</li>
<li>I considered eggs as an alternate source of protein instead. A single egg has ~6g of protein and costs about 50¢. The cost could potentially come down but the bigger issue is to get the same 42g of protein I’d need to eat 7 eggs. I don’t know if you’ve eaten eggs before but <u>7 eggs is a lot of eggs</u>. Imagine woofing down 7 sweaty hard-boiled orbs a couple times a day, yikes.</li>
<li>I could brew my own agave-sweetened tea. I’ve done this once, but the crisp flavor profile wasn’t the same so I wouldn’t call it a success. Needs more experimentation.</li>
<li>Thanks to Costco selling our favorite local coffee roaster in bulk, we have caffeine ritual costs dialed down about as low as they can go. Feel comfortable there.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lowering my lunch costs stands out as the best candidate for improvement. But <a href="https://daverupert.com/2023/10/snap-kitchen/">as I noted before</a>, adding even a small pile of extra duties risks toppling the wagon and I’m back to eating emergency $14 Spicy Chicken Sando Combos to quench my hunger. I wonder where my daily costs fit on a graph of national statistics. Is this average? Is this Bidenomic inflation? Am I making myself poor with my avocado toast? Someone who understands finances help me budget! Ack!</p>

## World's largest 3D-printed neighborhood nears completion in Texas

date: 2024-08-08, from: VOA News USA

GEORGETOWN, Texas — As with any desktop 3D printer, the Vulcan printer pipes layer by layer to build an object – except this printer is more than 45 feet (13.7 m) wide, weighs 4.75 tons and prints residential homes.


This summer, the robotic printer from ICON is finishing the last few of 100 3D-printed houses in Wolf Ranch, a community in Georgetown, Texas, about 30 miles from Austin.


ICON began printing the walls of what it says is the world's largest 3D-printed community in November 2022. Compared to traditional construction, the company says that 3D printing homes is faster, less expensive, requires fewer workers, and minimizes construction material waste.




"It brings a lot of efficiency to the trade market," said ICON senior project manager Conner Jenkins. "So, where there were maybe five different crews coming in to build a wall system, we now have one crew and one robot."


After concrete powder, water, sand and other additives are mixed together and pumped into the printer, a nozzle squeezes out the concrete mixture like toothpaste onto a brush, building up layer by layer along a pre-programmed path that creates corduroy-effect walls.


The single-story three- to four-bedroom homes take about three weeks to finish printing, with the foundation and metal roofs installed traditionally.




Jenkins said the concrete walls are designed to be resistant to water, mold, termites and extreme weather.


Lawrence Nourzad, a 32-year-old business development director, and his girlfriend Angela Hontas, a 29-year-old creative strategist, purchased a Wolf Ranch home earlier this summer.


"It feels like a fortress," Nourzad said, adding that he was confident it would be resilient to most tornados.


The walls also provide strong insulation from the Texas heat, the couple said, keeping the interior temperature cool even when the air conditioner wasn't on full blast.




There was one other thing the 3D-printed walls seemed to protect against, however: a solid wireless internet connection.


"Obviously these are really strong, thick walls. And that's what provides a lot of value for us as homeowners and keeps this thing really well-insulated in a Texas summer, but signal doesn't transfer through these walls very well," Nourzad said.




To alleviate this issue, an ICON spokeswoman said most Wolf Ranch homeowners use mesh internet routers, which broadcast a signal from multiple units placed throughout a home, versus a traditional router which sends a signal from one device.


The 3D-printed homes at Wolf Ranch, called the "Genesis Collection" by developers, range in price from around $450,000 to close to $600,000. Developers said a little more than one quarter of the 100 homes have been sold.


ICON, which 3D-printed its first home in Austin in 2018, hopes to one day take its technology to the Moon. NASA, as part of its Artemis Moon exploration program, has contracted ICON to develop a construction system capable of building landing pads, shelters, and other structures on the lunar surface.

## No, the news is not information junk food

<div class="e-content aside-content">
<p>Every so often, a post goes around in tech circles about how news is bad and we shouldn’t pay attention to it. I think that’s ludicrous.</p><p>Today’s was a post from 2022 called <a href="https://chuck.is/news/">The News is Information Junk Food</a>. I think it’s a bad argument that could have poor consequences.</p><p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41189946">It was featured on Hacker News</a>, so, gods help me, I commented there. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41191334">Here’s what I said</a>:</p><p> </p><p><em>This is a pretty bad take.</em></p><p><em>For example, multiple studies have shown that in communities that aren't addressed by a robust local news outlet, local corruption goes up. Having a good newsroom does improve an understanding of what your representatives are up to, and a lack of information does allow them to get up to more behind our backs.</em></p><p><em>I think the biggest failure of this piece is to make all news equivalent. Yes, much cable news is junk; yes, many of the corporate newsrooms that churn out hundreds of articles a day are junk. They use engagement as a metric for success rather than finding ways to align themselves with impact and creating an informed, empowered electorate. That last thing - an informed, empowered electorate - is what it's all about.</em></p><p><em>Real journalism that is diligently undertaken in the public interest does make a real difference. (Should we know whether Clarence Thomas was taking corrupt bribes? Yes. Should we know how climate change is progressing? Yes. Should we know if the police are killing innocent people? Yes. Should we know that the police at the Uvalde school shooting hung around for over an hour doing nothing? Yes.) Telling people not to pay attention to the world around them results in an electorate who cannot meaningfully vote on real issues.</em></p><p><em>For those of us who build software, we need to know the factors that impact the lives of the people we're serving. We need to know the trends in the marketplaces and communities where we show up.

## Apple memory holed its broken promise for an OCSP opt-out

date: 2024-08-08, from: OS News

When you launch an app, macOS connects to Apple&#8217;s OCSP service to check whether the app&#8217;s Developer ID code signing certificate has been revoked by Apple. In November 2020, Apple&#8217;s OCSP service experienced a mass outage, preventing Mac users worldwide from launching apps. In response and remedy to this outage, Apple made several explicit promises to Mac users in a support document, which can still be seen in a Wayback Machine archive from September 24, 2023. ↫ Jeff Johnson One of the explicit promises Apple made was that it would allow macOS users to turn off phoning home to Cupertino every time you launch an application on macOS. It&#8217;s four years later now, and this promise has not been kept &#8211; Apple still does not allow you to turn off phoning home. In fact, it turns out that last year, Apple scrubbed this promise from all of its documentation, hoping we&#8217;re all going to forget about it. In other words, Apple is never going to allow its macOS users to stop the operating system from phoning home to Cupertino every time you launch an application. Even though the boiling frog story is nonsensical, it&#8217;s apt here. More and more Apple is limiting its users&#8217; control over macOS, locking it down to a point where you&#8217;re not really the owner of your computer anymore. Stuff like this gives me the creeps.

## Tropical Storm Debby makes 2nd landfall in South Carolina, heavy rain expected up the East Coast

date: 2024-08-08, from: VOA News USA

HUGER, S.C. — Tropical Storm Debby has made a second landfall in South Carolina on its way up the East Coast, where residents as far north as Vermont could get several inches of rain this weekend.


The National Hurricane Center says Debby came ashore early Thursday near Bulls Bay, South Carolina. The storm is expected to keep moving inland, spreading heavy rain and possible flooding all the way up through the mid-Atlantic and the Northeast by the weekend.


Debby first made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday on the Gulf Coast of Florida. It is now a tropical storm with maximum sustained winds at 50 mph (80 kph).


Considerable flooding is expected across parts of eastern South Carolina and southeast North Carolina through Friday, with an additional 3 to 9 inches (8 to 23 centimeters) of rain forecast, as well as in portions of Virginia, according to the hurricane center.




Days of rain have forced the deluge-hardened residents of a South Carolina community to begin the near-ritualistic task of assessing damage left behind by Debby, which continued spinning over the Atlantic Ocean and influencing thunderstorms from the East Coast to the Great Lakes on Wednesday. The National Weather Service's office in Charleston also said survey teams confirmed four-Debby related tornadoes.


In Huger, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) northeast of Charleston, Gene Taylor was waiting in the afternoon for a few inches of water to drain from his house along French Quarter Creek as high tide passed.


Taylor saw the potential for flooding last week and started moving belongings out or up higher in his home. It's a lesson learned the hard way — Taylor estimated that this is the fourth time he has had floodwater in his home in the past nine years.


"To save everything, we've learned from the past it's better be prepared for the worst. And unfortunately, I think we got it," Taylor said.


A few doors down, Charles Grainger was cleaning up after about 8 inches (20 centimeters) of water got into his home.


"Eight inches disrupts your whole life," Grainger said. "You don't get used to it. You just grin and bear it. It's part of living on the creek."


In Georgia, at least four dams were breached northwest of Savannah in Bulloch County, but no deaths had been reported, authorities said at a briefing.


More than 75 people were rescued from floodwaters in the county, said Corey Kemp, director of emergency management, and about 100 roads were closed.


"We've been faced with a lot of things we've never been faced with before," Bulloch County Commission Chairman Roy Thompson said. "I'm 78-plus years old and have never seen anything like this before in Bulloch County. It's amazing what has happened, and amazing what is going to continue to happen until all these waters get out of here."




For residents on Tappan Zee Drive in suburban Pooler, west of Savannah, Georgia, the drenching that Debby delivered came with a painful dose of déjà vu. In October 2016, Hurricane Matthew overflowed a nearby canal and flooded several of the same homes.


Located roughly 30 miles (50 kilometers) inland from the Atlantic Ocean, with no creeks or rivers nearby, the neighborhood doesn't seem like a high-risk location for tropical flooding. But residents say drainage problems have plagued their street for well over a decade, despite local government efforts to fix them.


Debby also dumped rain on communities all the way up to the Great Lakes and New York and New Jersey. Moisture from the tropical storm strengthened another system Tuesday evening, which caused strong thunderstorms, according to weather service meteorologist Scott Kleebauer.


"We had a multi-round period of showers and thunderstorms that kind of scooted from Michigan eastward," Kleebauer said.


As much as 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell in parts of New Jersey in less than four hours.


Emergency officials in New York City warned of potential flash flooding, flying drones with loudspeakers in some neighborhoods to tell people in basement apartments to be ready to flee at a moment's notice. Multiple water rescues were reported in and near the city.


About 270,000 customers remained without power in Ohio as of Thursday morning, according to PowerOutage.us, following severe storms including two confirmed tornadoes. Utility officials with FirstEnergy's Illuminating Company said via social media that power restoration would take days due to the damage.


In South Carolina, Gov. Henry McMaster said his state was just entering Act 2 of a three-act play, after more than 60 homes were damaged but roads and water systems were without significant problems.


The final act may come next week if enough rain falls upstream in North Carolina to cause major flooding along rivers as they flow to the Atlantic Ocean.


A state of emergency was in effect for both North Carolina and Virginia. Maryland issued a state of preparedness declaration that coordinates preparations without declaring an emergency.


At least six people have died due to the storm, five of them in traffic accidents or from fallen trees. The sixth death involved a 48-year-old man in Gulfport, Florida, whose body was recovered after his anchored sailboat partially sank.

## In Louisiana's Cancer Alley, company cancels plans for grain export facility in historic Black town

date: 2024-08-08, from: VOA News USA

WALLACE, La.  — Residents of a historic Black community in Louisiana who've spent years fighting against a massive grain export facility set to be built on the grounds where their enslaved ancestors once lived appear to have finally halted the project.


A representative from the company, Greenfield Louisiana LLC, announced during a public hearing on Tuesday evening that the company is “ceasing all plans” to construct a grain export facility in the middle of the town of Wallace in St. John the Baptist Parish.


After a moment, opponents of the project broke out in cheers and began clapping and hugging each other.


“I’m still obviously in disbelief — I can’t believe this is happening, but I’m ecstatic and all praise to the ancestors,” said Joy Banner, a Wallace resident and one of the most vocal opponents of the project. She and her sister, Jo, founded The Descendants Project to preserve the community’s heritage.




The company’s announcement signaled a rare win for a community in a heavily industrialized stretch of the Mississippi River known as “Cancer Alley” for its high levels of pollution. Wallace is about 80 kilometers west of New Orleans.


“I think all of the fighting – it is coming from the love and the passion for our communities we have here along the river, and to show the world we can and you should fight,” Banner said. “We are recognizing that we do have power – that power comes from the love we have for our community.”


Earlier this year, the Banner sisters’ nonprofit purchased a plantation which had been the site of one of the largest slave rebellions in American History, the 1811 German Coast Uprising. They plan to transform it into an educational space.


The Army Corps of Engineers had already determined the 90-hectare facility could adversely impact cultural heritage sites in Wallace and was tasked with reviewing Greenfield’s application.


Army Corps representative Brad LaBorde said his agency had not been informed in advance of the company’s unexpected decision to cancel plans for the facility.


“We don’t know exactly what that means,” LaBorde said. “We still have an active permit application so, if it is Greenfield’s intention to no longer pursue the project, then we would ask they formally submit a withdrawal to us so that we can conclude the review.”


Lynda Van Davis, Greenfield’s counsel and head of external affairs, said the long delay in government approval for the project has been “an expensive ordeal,” adding that she did not have an answer for when the company would submit a formal withdrawal to the Army Corps.


“This has been a difficult ride the whole time, we didn’t wake up yesterday and say we’re done,” Van Davis said. “We said we’ll stay in the fight a little bit longer, because we’ve become friends with this community. Unfortunately, how long are we supposed to stay in this fight?”


The Army Corps had found the project could affect historic properties in Wallace, including the Evergreen, Oak Alley and Whitney plantations. There also remained the possibility that the area contained burial sites for the ancestral Black community.


Some community members had supported the project, believing it would bring jobs to their town, even as opponents of the facility said tourism surrounding cultural heritage was already a thriving industry that deserved greater investment.


“I was looking forward to economic development in my community – jobs, new businesses, just all around better living for my community,” said Nicole Dumas, 48, a Wallace resident, who supported the project.


But the evening became a celebration for others. Angelica Mitchell, 53, held back tears as she took in the company’s announcement. Mitchell is still recovering from treatment for a rare form of cancer which had attacked her pancreas, but she chose to attend the public hearing despite her health struggles. The facility would have been built within a few hundred feet of her home.


“To hear that they are backing out, I am so excited, my prayers have been answered, because I’ve been praying for this for the last three years,” Mitchell said. “I’ve been asking God, just don’t let this plant come into our community. I don’t want this for our children.”

## Wind Power Capacity Is Growing, But Not Fast Enough

Global leaders agreed at last year’s COP28 that, to be in line with the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the world must triple renewables capacity by the end of the decade. Ember’s report concludes that under current plans, wind power is set to more than double in that timeframe, “but fall short of tripling.” Ember also reiterates that China is “overachieving,” and is on a path to triple its wind capacity from 2022 to 2030. Meanwhile, the rest of the world is underachieving. </p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

And most countries don’t even have explicit wind targets yet. “Amidst the hype of solar, wind is not getting enough attention, even though it provides cheap electricity and complements solar,” said Katye Altieri, Ember’s global electricity analyst. “The path to a cleaner energy future could be shaped by prioritizing improved policies, regulatory frameworks and financial support.”</p><h3>2.

The politicians say industry leaders and constituents have been reaching out to express their fears that the GOP will upend the tax regime and “undermine private investments and stop development that is already ongoing.” The letter goes on: “A full repeal would create a worst-case scenario where we would have spent billions of taxpayer dollars and received next to nothing in return.” A majority of clean tech spending made possible so far under the IRA has gone toward projects in Republican districts.

Solar energy fraud at the residential consumer level is a rare but profoundly painful phenomenon that can acutely harm low- and middle-income households.

## The biggest loans of our lives are getting a bit cheaper

date: 2024-08-08, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>The average 30-year fixed rate mortgage peaked at just under 8% in October 2023. Rates have hovered around 7% for a good part of this year but have dipped further thanks to the prospect of a rate cut by the Federal Reserve come September. We&#8217;ll also travel once again to Kent County, Michigan — a swing county in a swing state — to hear how the economy is influencing voters there. Plus: quarterly results from two big media companies.</p>

## Bangladesh is restarting its economy

date: 2024-08-08, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Following weeks of protests in Bangladesh, a new interim prime minister is being sworn in and the economy is reopening, including the crucial garments industry. Then, three Taylor Swift concerts have been canceled in Vienna, because of security concerns. It&#8217;s a big disappointment for local businesses expecting to benefit from Swiftanomics. And would you volunteer to pick up trash while on vacation? Copenhagen is incentivizing visitors to do so.</p>

## US judge again dismisses Mexico's lawsuit against most gun manufacturers

date: 2024-08-08, from: VOA News USA

MEXICO CITY — A U.S. federal judge in Massachusetts again dismissed a $10 billion Mexican government lawsuit against six U.S. gun manufacturers on Wednesday.


Mexico had argued the companies knew weapons were being sold to traffickers who smuggled them into Mexico and decided to cash in on that market.


However, the judge ruled that Mexico had not provided concrete evidence that any of the six companies' activities in Massachusetts were connected to any suffering caused in Mexico by guns.


Mexico's Foreign Relations Department said Wednesday the ruling would allow the lawsuit to proceed against a seventh manufacturer and a gun wholesaler.


Regarding the dismissal against the others, the department said, "Mexico is analyzing its options, among them presenting an appeal."


The case has been a legal rollercoaster.


In early 2022, six companies — not including the seventh manufacturer — filed to dismiss Mexico's claims based on the broad protection provided to gun manufacturers by a 2005 U.S. law, the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, or PLCAA.


The law shields gun manufacturers from damages "resulting from the criminal or unlawful misuse" of a firearm. Later in 2022, the federal judge ruled to dismiss the case on those grounds.


Mexico appealed that ruling, and in January the U.S. 1st Circuit Court of Appeals in Massachusetts revived the lawsuit, saying the PLCAA did not apply to the claims the guns caused deaths, damages and injuries in Mexico.


The appeals court returned the case to the lower court, which again ruled to dismiss the claims against six of the companies.


The Mexican government estimates 70% of the weapons trafficked into Mexico come from the U.S., according to the Foreign Affairs Ministry.

## Biden 'not confident' of peaceful power transition if Trump loses election

date: 2024-08-08, from: VOA News USA

washington — President Joe Biden said on Wednesday he was not confident about a peaceful transfer of power in the United States if Republican Donald Trump loses the Nov. 5 presidential election.


"If Trump loses, I'm not confident at all," Biden said in an interview with CBS News when asked whether he thought there would be a peaceful transfer of power after the vote.


"He means what he says. We don't take him seriously. He means it. All this stuff about if we lose there'd be a bloodbath," Biden added.


During a March campaign appearance in Ohio, Trump warned of a "bloodbath" if he fails win the election. At the time Trump was discussing the need to protect the U.S. auto industry from overseas competition, and Trump later said he was referring to the auto industry when he used the term.


Trump has falsely claimed he won the 2020 election against Biden and was criminally charged in Washington and Georgia with illegally trying to overturn the results.


Biden dropped out of the campaign last month after fellow Democrats called for him to step aside following a poor debate performance against Trump that raised questions about the Democratic president's age and health.


Biden's vice president, Kamala Harris, has since captured the Democratic nomination and is running against Trump.

## Tropical Storm Debby doles out repeat deluges for weather-weary residents

date: 2024-08-08, from: VOA News USA

huger, south carolina — Days of rain from Tropical Storm Debby forced the residents of a South Carolina community to begin the task of assessing damage left by a cyclone that was spinning over the Atlantic Ocean and influencing thunderstorms from the East Coast to the Great Lakes.


Gene Taylor waited Wednesday afternoon for a few inches of water to drain out of his house as high tide passed at his home along French Quarter Creek in Huger, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) northeast of Charleston.


Taylor saw the potential for flooding last week and started moving stuff out or up higher in his home. It's a lesson learned the hard way. Taylor estimates this is the fourth time he has had floodwater in his home in the past nine years.


"To save everything, we've learned from the past it's better be prepared for the worst. And unfortunately, I think we got it," Taylor said.


A few doors down, Charles Granger was cleaning up after about 8 inches (20 centimeters) of water got into his home. He said it is an annoyance, but one he is trying to get used to.


"Eight inches disrupts your whole life," Grainger said. "You don't get used to it. You just grin and bear it. It's part of living on the creek."




The National Hurricane Center warned that isolated areas could see up to 25 inches (64 centimeters) of rain from Tropical Storm Debby.


For Georgia homeowners in suburban Pooler west of Savannah, the drenching came with a dose of déjà vu. In October 2016, rain from Hurricane Matthew overwhelmed a nearby canal and flooded several of the same homes.


Located roughly 30 miles (48 kilometers) from the Atlantic Ocean, with no creeks or rivers nearby, the inland neighborhood doesn't seem like a high-risk location for tropical flooding.


But residents say drainage problems have plagued their street for well over a decade, despite efforts by the local government to fix them.


Debby also rained on residents all the way up to the Great Lakes and New York and New Jersey. Moisture from the tropical storm strengthened another storm system Tuesday evening, which caused strong thunderstorms, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Scott Kleebauer.


Up to 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell in parts of New Jersey in less than four hours.


Emergency officials warned of potential flash flooding, flying drones with loudspeakers in some New York City neighborhoods to tell people in basement apartments to be ready to flee at a moment's notice. Multiple water rescues were reported in New York City and surrounding areas.




Nearly 330,000 customers remained without power in Ohio by Wednesday afternoon following severe storms there, according to PowerOutage.us.


'Imminent failure' of dam


Meanwhile, the "imminent failure" of a dam in southeast Georgia was threatening to swamp a mobile home park and other areas downstream, the National Weather Service said in a flash flood warning Wednesday afternoon. The Cypress Lake Dam is in Bulloch County, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) northwest of Savannah.


"If the dam breaks, flash flooding will occur immediately downstream of the dam," the weather service said.


In South Carolina, Governor Henry McMaster said the state was just entering Act 2 of a three-act play.


"We've been lucky so far. Things have not been as bad as they could have been," McMaster said of heavy rains that damaged over 60 homes but did not cause significant problems to roads or water systems.




Act 2 is overnight into Thursday when Debby moves back onshore and heavy rain returns, this time to the northern part of the coast and inland. An additional 4 to 8 inches (10 to 20 centimeters) of rain could fall, said John Quagliariello, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Columbia.


"It may not be as catastrophic as what we were saying, but we still think as these rain bands develop they could sit over the same area for long periods of time, produce a lot of rainfall and a lot of flooding," Quagliariello said.


Flooding possible next week


The final act may come next week if enough rain falls upstream in North Carolina to cause major flooding along rivers as it flows to the Atlantic Ocean.


The center of Debby was over the Atlantic Ocean on Wednesday afternoon, 55 miles (89 kilometers) east-southeast of Charleston, the National Hurricane Center said. The tropical storm could make a second landfall in either North Carolina or South Carolina, expected late Wednesday or early Thursday. Debby first made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday along the Gulf Coast of Florida.


A state of emergency was in effect for both North Carolina and Virginia. Maryland issued a state of preparedness declaration.


At least six people have died due to the storm, five of them in traffic accidents or from fallen trees. The sixth death involved a man in Gulfport, Florida, whose body was recovered after his anchored sailboat partially sank.

## Stranded NASA Starliner pilots may return to Earth on SpaceX

date: 2024-08-08, from: VOA News USA

CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida — What should have been a quick trip to the International Space Station may turn into an eight-month stay for two NASA astronauts if they have to switch from Boeing to SpaceX for a ride home.


There's lingering uncertainty over the safety of Boeing's new Starliner capsule, NASA officials said Wednesday, and the space agency is split over the risk. As a result, chances are increasing that test pilots Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams may have to watch from the space station as their Starliner is cut loose to return to Earth empty.


If that happens, NASA will leave behind two of four astronauts from the next SpaceX taxi flight in late September, with the vacant seats set aside for Wilmore and Williams on the return trip in February. The pair expected to be gone just a week or two when they launched June 5 as Starliner's first crew.


NASA is bringing in additional experts to analyze the thruster failures experienced by Starliner before it docked. At the same time, NASA is looking more closely at SpaceX as a backup.


At this point, "we could take either path," said Ken Bowersox, NASA's space operations mission chief.


During a recent meeting, "we heard from a lot of folks that had concern, and the decision was not clear," he said. A final decision is expected by mid-August.


Boeing issued a brief statement following NASA's news update, repeating its position that the capsule could still safely bring the astronauts home.


"We still believe in Starliner's capability and its flight rationale," the company said.


Boeing will need to modify the capsule's software in case Starliner ends up returning without a crew.


No serious consideration was given to launching a separate SpaceX flight just to retrieve Wilmore and Williams, according to commercial crew program manager Steve Stich.


Tests on the ground have replicated the thrust problems, pointing to seals as one culprit. But it's still not understood how or why those seals swell when overheated and then shrink back to the proper size, Stich noted. All but one of the Starliner's five failed thrusters have since been reactivated in orbit.


These thrusters are essential for allowing Starliner to back away from the space station following undocking, and for keeping the capsule in the proper position for moving out of orbit.


At the same time, engineers are grappling over helium leaks in Starliner's propulsion system, crucial for maneuvering. The first leak occurred before liftoff but was deemed isolated and stable. Then more cropped up in flight.


NASA hired Boeing and SpaceX to ferry astronauts to and from the space station after the shuttles retired in 2011. SpaceX flew its first crew in 2020. Boeing stumbled on its first test flight without a crew and then fell further behind after a repeat demo.


Officials repeated their desire for a backup taxi service on Wednesday, A situation like this one could happen again, and "that's why we want multiple vehicles," Bowersox said.


The next crew flight will be SpaceX's 10th for NASA. On Tuesday, it was delayed for a month until late September to allow for extra time to figure out how best to handle Starliner's return. Three NASA astronauts and one Russian are assigned to the flight, and managers on Wednesday declined to say who might be bumped.

## Crews fight revived Park Fire in California

date: 2024-08-08, from: VOA News USA

SAN BERNARDINO, California — Firefighters battled on Wednesday the reawakened Park Fire, a massive blaze that re-exploded in Northern California on Monday after several days of slumber and grew by as much as 53 square kilometers, mostly in about 12 hours.


The Park Fire, California's largest so far this year and the state's fourth largest on record, had scorched nearly 1,676 square kilometers by Tuesday morning.


Firefighters were told during their morning briefing to focus on safety and to be mindful of extreme fire behavior, including intense and rapidly moving flames.




The Park Fire was allegedly ignited by arson on July 24 outside the Sacramento Valley city of Chico and has destroyed 640 structures and damaged 52.


In Southern California, a fast-moving wildfire that swept into a hillside community this week destroyed five homes and damaged three others, authorities said Tuesday.


The flames erupted Monday afternoon and chased residents from the neighborhood in San Bernardino, about 97 kilometers east of Los Angeles,


One firefighter was treated for a minor injury but there were no reports of injuries to residents, said Eric Sherwin, spokesperson for the San Bernardino County Fire Department.


"How quickly this fire hit this community," Sherwin said, "the fact that we have no civilians injured is truly a miracle."




The fire was reported at 2:40 p.m. Monday and stopped progressing about three hours later after scorching 22 hectares. Containment was holding at 75%, Sherwin said. All evacuations were lifted late Tuesday morning.


Investigators were working to determine the cause of the fire, which erupted amid very dry and hot conditions that have made swaths of California quick to burn this summer.

## PostgreSQL 16.4, 15.8, 14.13, 13.16, 12.20, and 17 Beta 3 Released!

date: 2024-08-08, from: PostgreSQL News

<p>The PostgreSQL Global Development Group has released an update to all supported
versions of PostgreSQL, including 16.4, 15.8, 14.13, 13.16, and 12.20, as well
as the third beta release of PostgreSQL 17. This release fixes 1 security
vulnerability and over 55 bugs reported over the last several months.</p>
<p>For the full list of changes, please review the
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/">release notes</a>.</p>
<h2>PostgreSQL 12 EOL Notice</h2>
<p>PostgreSQL 12 will stop receiving fixes on November 14, 2024. If you are
running PostgreSQL 12 in a production environment, we suggest that you make
plans to upgrade to a newer, supported version of PostgreSQL. Please see our
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/">versioning policy</a> for more
information.</p>
<h2>Security Issues</h2>
<h3><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/support/security/CVE-2024-7348/">CVE-2024-7348</a>: PostgreSQL relation replacement during pg_dump executes arbitrary SQL</h3>
<p>CVSS v3.1 Base Score: <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H">8.8</a></p>
<p>Supported, Vulnerable Versions: 12 - 16.</p>
<p>An attacker able to create and drop non-temporary objects could inject SQL code
that would be executed by a concurrent <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgdump.html"><code>pg_dump</code></a>
session with the privileges of the role running <code>pg_dump</code> (which is often a
superuser). The attack involves replacing a sequence or similar object with a
view or foreign table that will execute malicious code. To prevent this,
introduce a new server parameter <code>restrict_nonsystem_relation_kind</code> that can
disable expansion of non-builtin views as well as access to foreign tables, and
teach <code>pg_dump</code> to set it when available. Note that the attack is prevented only
if both <code>pg_dump</code> and the server it is dumping from are new enough to have this
fix.</p>
<p>The PostgreSQL project thanks Noah Misch for reporting this problem.</p>
<h2>Bug Fixes and Improvements</h2>
<p>This update fixes over 55 bugs that were reported in the last several months.
The issues listed below affect PostgreSQL 16. Some of these issues may also
affect other supported versions of PostgreSQL.</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid incorrect results from "Merge Right Anti Join" plans, where if the inner relation is known to have unique join keys, the merge could misbehave when there are duplicated join keys in the outer relation.</li>
<li>Prevent infinite loop in <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-vacuum.html"><code>VACUUM</code></a>.</li>
<li>Fix partition pruning setup during <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-altertable.html"><code>ALTER TABLE DETACH ... PARTITION CONCURRENTLY</code></a>.</li>
<li>Fix behavior of stable functions that are used as an argument to a <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-call.html"><code>CALL</code></a> statement.</li>
<li><code>pg_sequence_last_value()</code> now returns <code>NULL</code> instead of throwing an error when called on unlogged sequences on standby servers and on temporary sequences of other sessions.</li>
<li>Fix parsing of ignored operators in <code>websearch_to_tsquery()</code>.</li>
<li>Correctly check updatability of view columns targeted by <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-insert.html"><code>INSERT ... DEFAULT</code></a>.</li>
<li>Lock owned sequences during <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-altertable.html"><code>ALTER TABLE ... SET LOGGED|UNLOGGED</code></a>.</li>
<li>Don't throw an error if a queued <code>AFTER</code> trigger no longer exists.</li>
<li>Fix selection of an arbiter index for <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-insert.html"><code>INSERT ... ON CONFLICT</code></a> when the desired index has expressions or predicates, for example, through an updatable view.</li>
<li>Refuse to modify a temporary table of another session with <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-altertable.html"><code>ALTER TABLE</code></a>.</li>
<li>Fix handling of extended statistics on expressions in <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createtable.html"><code>CREATE TABLE ... LIKE STATISTICS</code></a>.</li>
<li>Fix failure to recalculate sub-queries generated from <code>MIN()</code> or <code>MAX()</code> aggregates.</li>
<li>Disallow underscores in positional parameters.</li>
<li>Avoid crashing when a JIT-inlined backend function throws an error.</li>
<li>Fix handling of subtransactions of prepared transactions when starting a hot standby server.</li>
<li>Prevent incorrect initialization of logical replication slots.</li>
<li>Fix memory leak in the logical replication WAL sender when publishing changes to a partitioned table whose partitions have row types that are physically different from the table.</li>
<li>Disable creation of stateful TLS session tickets by OpenSSL.</li>
<li>Fix how <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/plpgsql.html">PL/pgSQL</a> handles integer ranges containing underscores (e.g., <code>FOR i IN 1_001..1_002</code>).</li>
<li>Fix incompatibility between <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/plperl.html">PL/Perl</a> and Perl 5.40.</li>
<li>Several fixes related to recursive <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/plpython.html">PL/Python</a> functions and triggers.</li>
<li>Ensure that <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgrestore.html"><code>pg_restore -l</code></a> reports dependent table of contents entries correctly.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgstatstatements.html"><code>pg_stat_statements</code></a> now passes a query ID for utility (non-<code>SELECT</code>/<code>INSERT</code>/<code>UPDATE</code>) statements that appears in SQL-language functions.</li>
<li>Fix for <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/postgres-fdw.html"><code>postgres_fdw</code></a> when mapping a foreign table to a nontrivial remote view.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/postgres-fdw.html"><code>postgres_fdw</code></a> no longer sends a <code>FETCH FIRST WITH TIES</code> clause to a remote server.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Updating</h2>
<p>All PostgreSQL update releases are cumulative. As with other minor releases,
users are not required to dump and reload their database or use <code>pg_upgrade</code> in
order to apply this update release; you may simply shutdown PostgreSQL and
update its binaries.</p>
<p>Users who have skipped one or more update releases may need to run additional
post-update steps; please see the release notes from earlier versions for
details.</p>
<p>For more details, please see the
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/">release notes</a>.</p>
<h2>A Note on the PostgreSQL 17 Beta</h2>
<p>This release marks the third beta release of PostgreSQL 17 and puts the
community one step closer to general availability tentatively around the end of
the third quarter.</p>
<p>In the spirit of the open source PostgreSQL community, we strongly encourage you
to test the new features of PostgreSQL 17 on your systems to help us eliminate
bugs or other issues that may exist. While we do not advise you to run
PostgreSQL 17 Beta 3 in production environments, we encourage you to find ways
to run your typical application workloads against this beta release.</p>
<p>Your testing and feedback will help the community ensure that the PostgreSQL 17
release upholds our standards of delivering a stable, reliable release of the
world's most advanced open source relational database. Please read more about
our <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/developer/beta/">beta testing process</a> and how
you can contribute:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/developer/beta/">https://www.postgresql.org/developer/beta/</a></p>
<h2>Upgrading to PostgreSQL 17 Beta 3</h2>
<p>To upgrade to PostgreSQL 17 Beta 3 from an earlier version of PostgreSQL,
you will need to use a strategy similar to upgrading between major versions of
PostgreSQL (e.g. <code>pg_upgrade</code> or <code>pg_dump</code> / <code>pg_restore</code>). For more
information, please visit the documentation section on
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/static/upgrading.html">upgrading</a>.</p>
<h2>Changes Since Beta 2</h2>
<p>Fixes and changes in PostgreSQL 17 Beta 3 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rename the <code>standby_slot_names</code> parameter to to <code>synchronized_standby_slots</code>.</li>
<li>Several SQL/JSON fixes.</li>
<li>Fix <code>pg_combinebackup --clone</code>.</li>
<li>Fix <code>pg_createsubscriber</code> to work for database names that contain a space.</li>
<li><code>pg_createsubscriber</code> now drops pre-existing subscriptions when run on a
target database.</li>
<li>Improve efficiency in retrieving subscription information during <code>pg_upgrade</code>.</li>
<li>Fix TLS fallback behavior during <code>sslmode=prefer</code> to error when a server sends
an error during the startup process.</li>
<li>Document an error case with <code>pg_basebackup</code> incremental backup on a standby
server when it's executed immediately after the previous backup.</li>
<li>Fix issue where <code>pg_upgrade --transaction-size</code> can cause the backend to use
an order of magnitude more RAM.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please see the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/release-17.html">release notes</a>
for a complete list of new and changed features, and

for more details on fixes and changes.</p>
<h2>Testing for Bugs &amp; Compatibility</h2>
<p>The stability of each PostgreSQL release greatly depends on you, the community,
to test the upcoming version with your workloads and testing tools in order to
find bugs and regressions before the general availability of PostgreSQL 17. As
this is a Beta, minor changes to database behaviors, feature details, and APIs
are still possible. Your feedback and testing will help determine the final
tweaks on the new features, so please test in the near future. The quality of
user testing helps determine when we can make a final release.</p>
