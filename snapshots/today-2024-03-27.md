## Texas' Migrant Arrest Law on Hold for Now Under Latest Court Ruling

date: 2024-03-27, from: VOA News USA

NEW ORLEANS  — A Texas law that allows the state to arrest and deport migrants suspected of illegally entering the U.S. will remain on hold for now, a federal appeals court ruled.


The 2-1 ruling late Tuesday from a three-judge panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals followed a March 20 hearing by a three-judge panel of the court. It's just the latest move in a seesaw legal case over Republican Gov. Greg Abbott's strict new immigration law that is not yet ended.


The Justice Department has argued that Texas' law is a clear violation of federal authority and would create chaos at the border. Texas has argued that President Joe Biden's administration isn't doing enough to control the border and that the state has a right to take action.


Judge Andrew Oldham, an appointee of former President Donald Trump and a former aide to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, dissented with the majority decision.


Oldham wrote that the Biden administration faced a high bar to take sovereign power that Texas has to enforce a law its people and leaders want. The judge predicted the same 2-1 split when the merits of the case are considered while the legal challenge plays out.


"There is real peril in this approach. In our federal system, the State of Texas is supposed to retain at least some of its sovereignty," Oldham wrote. "Its people are supposed to be able to use that sovereignty to elect representatives and send them to Austin to debate and enact laws that respond to the exigencies that Texans experience and that Texans want addressed."




The law was in effect for several hours on March 19 after the U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way. But the high court didn't rule on the merits of the case. It instead sent the case back to the 5th Circuit, which then suspended enforcement while it considered the latest appeal.


The latest ruling keeps the block in place.


Spokespersons for Abbott and state Attorney General Ken Paxton did not immediately return phone calls for comment Wednesday morning.


The law signed by Abbott allows any Texas law enforcement officer to arrest people suspected of entering the country illegally, but that brief window while the law was in effect revealed that many sheriffs were unprepared, unable or uninterested in enforcing SB4 in the first place.




Sheriff Thaddeus Cleveland of Terrell County, which touches more than 50 miles (80 kilometers) of border, said during a gathering of about 100 sheriffs at the state Capitol last week said there's no practical way for him to enforce the law.


Cleveland said he has no way to transport people, the county jail has space for just seven people and the closest port of entry is a drive of more than 2 1/2 hours away.


Smith County Sheriff Larry Smith, president of the Texas Sheriff's Association, said the law will have little effect in his jurisdiction in East Texas, which is closer to Louisiana and Oklahoma than Mexico which is nearly 400 miles (644 kilometers) away.


Once in custody, migrants could either agree to a Texas judge's order to leave the U.S. or be prosecuted on misdemeanor charges of illegal entry. Migrants who don't leave could face arrest again under more serious felony charges.


Texas did not announce any arrests during the brief time the law was previously in effect. Authorities have offered various explanations for how they might enforce the law. Mexico has said it would refuse to take back anyone who is ordered by Texas to cross the border.




The law is considered by opponents to be the most dramatic attempt by a state to police immigration since an Arizona law more than a decade ago that was partially struck down by the Supreme Court. Critics have also said the Texas law could lead to civil rights violations and racial profiling.


Supporters have rejected those concerns, saying arresting officers must have probable cause, which could include witnessing the illegal entry or seeing it on video. They also say that they expect the law would be used mostly in border counties, though it would apply statewide.

## August Trial Date Set for Ex-Official Accused of Killing Vegas Journalist

date: 2024-03-27, from: VOA News USA

LAS VEGAS, NEVADA — A Nevada judge tentatively set an August 5 trial date for a former Las Vegas-area elected official accused of killing an investigative journalist.


But she acknowledged that more time might be needed to finish searching the slain reporter's computers for possible evidence.


Robert Telles, a former Democratic county administrator of estates, has pleaded not guilty to stabbing Las Vegas Review-Journal reporter Jeff German to death in September 2022.


Telles, 47, has remained jailed since his arrest days after German's body was found. Telles and his lawyer, Robert Draskovich, say he wants his murder trial to start as soon as possible.


Clark County District Court Judge Michelle Leavitt decided two weeks ago that a March 18 date was unrealistic. She agreed with prosecutors on Tuesday that August might also be too soon, but she said it was important to have a date to work toward.


Progress in the case stalled while arguments went to the state Supreme Court about opening German's cellphone and computers, possibly exposing confidential information that is protected from disclosure under state and federal law.


Review-Journal employees are now reviewing those files, and attorneys say it might take months to finish.


German, 69, was found stabbed outside his home months after he wrote articles in 2022 that were critical of Telles and his managerial conduct while he was in elected office.

## You might spot a mountain lion in California, but attacks like the one that killed a man are rare

Since 1890, there have been fewer than 50 confirmed attacks on people in California, and only six ended in deaths. While the prospect of attacks on people is frightening, humans kill far more cougars than the other way around.

## Biden Just Approved Another Big Offshore Wind Project

date: 2024-03-27, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDM0MDAwMC9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2ODQzODE2Nn0.7qLtGHwtvJDuHPOt-W4Ue-pqu3d_1ggV3S7sxzg1utg/image.png?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C1%2C0%2C1"/><br/><br/><p>
<em><strong>Current conditions:</strong> Freeze warnings are in place across Missouri • Tourists heading to Spain’s Canary Islands over the Easter holiday have been told to brace for extreme weather • It is 82 degrees Fahrenheit in Gaza today, marking the region’s first heat wave of the season.</em>
</p><h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2><h3>1. Biden approves another big offshore wind project</h3><p>
<strong></strong>The Biden administration <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=1a466b89e8&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">approved</a> its seventh commercial-scale offshore wind project yesterday. Orsted’s Sunrise Wind <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=616ea638b9&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">project</a> will be located about 16 nautical miles south of Marth’s Vineyard and have a capacity of 924-megawatts (MW) of renewable energy to power more than 320,000 homes per year. It will <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=665325d3e8&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">likely be completed</a> in 2026. “The approval is the latest positive development for an industry that had been bogged down by inflation, higher borrowing costs and supply-chain woes,” <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=99d0232575&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> <em>Bloomberg</em>. The seven projects in total have the potential to provide more than 8 gigawatts of clean energy to power roughly 3 million homes, according to the Department of the Interior.
</p><h3>2. Deadly Baltimore bridge collapse halts coal shipments</h3><p>
<strong></strong>Six people are presumed dead after Baltimore’s Francis Scott Key Bridge collapsed yesterday. The search continues for their remains. The disaster has halted the flow of ships in and out of the Port of Baltimore indefinitely, and this could have knock-on economic effects. It’s already throwing the U.S. coal market for a loop, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=0c8c2eca2c&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported Heatmap’s Matthew Zeitlin</a>. The port plays a pivotal role in the energy trade, as it is the second largest coal export facility in the country. One coal shipping executive told <em>Bloomberg</em> the disruption could last more than a month. Shares of Consol Energy, which ships more than 10 million tons of coal annually through a terminal at the Port of Baltimore, were down 7% yesterday. In terms of its effects on the overall energy market, the port’s indefinite closure could be mild and may actually result in lower energy prices in the Northeast, as coal that would have been exported becomes, essentially, stranded stateside, Greg Brew, an analyst at the Eurasia Group, told Zeitlin. But even this effect may be muted, Brew explained, because the weather is warming up with the end of winter, meaning there’s less demand on natural gas for heating.
</p><h3>3. Cocoa prices reach historic highs</h3><p>
<strong></strong>Cocoa futures were trading above $10,000 a tonne yesterday for the first time, more than double their price from two months ago, the <em>Financial Times</em> <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=74eeebfaa5&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">reported</a>. Prices dropped slightly later in the day, but the overall trend is not good: Cocoa has more than tripled in cost over the past year, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=31a4ff8030&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to</a> CNBC. Two countries in West Africa – Ivory Coast and Ghana – produce around two-thirds of the world’s cocoa beans. Heavy rainfall followed by dry heat in the region has hurt crop yields, and many farmers are abandoning the trade for other crops. “It rains outside of the rainy seasons now,” one cocoa plantation owner in Ghana <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=719ee3426c&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told the <em>FT</em></a>. “Dry seasons are hotter than they used to be.” Consumers could start to feel the pinch soon in the form of smaller chocolate bars for higher prices. Dark chocolate, which has a high cocoa content, will likely see the biggest price hike.

</p><h3>4. Western U.S. hydropower dips due to drought</h3><p>
	The amount of hydropower generated in the western U.S. plummeted last year because of drought, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=8e95933ec9&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to</a> the Energy Information Administration (EIA). Eleven states – Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, Wyoming, California, Oregon, and Washington – produce nearly 60% of the nation’s hydroelectricity. Between October 1, 2022, and September 30, 2023, they produced 141.6 million megawatthours (MWh) of hydropower, 11% below the year prior, and the smallest amount since 2001. Drought and heat waves meant less rainfall and rapidly melting snowpack in the Pacific Northwest. Hydropower in Washington fell by 23% compared to the year before. California, on the other hand, saw hydropower grow thanks to repeated atmospheric rivers, but not enough to make up for the overall regional deficit. The EIA forecasts that western hydropower production will fall by another 12% this year. <em>The Verge </em>succinctly <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=973bde353f&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">explained</a> why a drop in hydropower is bad for the planet: “Drought reduces the amount of clean energy available from hydroelectric dams. To avoid energy shortfalls, utilities wind up relying on fossil fuels to make up the difference. That leads to more of the greenhouse gas emissions causing climate change, which makes droughts worse.”

</p><h3>5. Wisconsin utilities pledge to use union labor to build clean energy infrastructure</h3><p>
<strong></strong>Wisconsin’s major utilities this week announced a commitment to employing local union workers to build clean energy projects. The state is embarking on a major renewables expansion, including new solar installations, onshore wind, and battery storage. The projects will require about 19,000 construction jobs, and the biggest power providers in the state – Alliant Energy, Madison Gas & Electric, WEC Energy Group, and Xcel Energy – say they’ll rely on workers from five labor unions to fill those roles. The pledge “reflects the power of the federal Inflation Reduction Act's tax incentives for large-scale renewable energy projects,”<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=5022d5a9c9&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> wrote Karl Ebert at the <em>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</em></a>. “The IRA provides additional incentives for projects that are built with union labor or pay the local prevailing wage.”

<p>Back from the trip to Locarno and I’m feeling sick. The nose, the frontal sinus cavity, ouch.</p>

<p>Ash and birch are in bloom earlier than usual.</p>

<p>I’ll take one of these Cetirizine-based hayfever pills, drink another cup of herbal infusion and go back to bed.
Hopefully at least one of these things will help.</p>

## Infinite Mac: turning to the dark side

date: 2024-03-27, from: OS News

About a year ago I came across the Previous emulator – it appeared to be a faithful simulation of the NeXT hardware and thus capable of running NeXTStep. While including it in Infinite Mac would be scope-creep, NeXT’s legacy is in many ways more relevant to today’s macOS than classic Mac OS. It also helped that it’s under active development by its original creator (see the epic thread in the NeXT Computers forums), and thus a modern, living codebase. Previous is the fifth emulator that I’ve ported to WebAssembly/Emscripten and the Infinite Mac runtime, and it’s gotten easier. As I&#8217;m doing this work, I’m developing more and more empathy for those doing Mac game ports – some things are really easy and others become yak shaves due to the unintended consequences of choices made by the original developers. Previous is available on multiple platforms and has good abstractions, so overall it was a pretty pleasant experience. ↫ Mihai Parparita By porting previous to WebAssembly/Emscripten, Infinite Mac now offers access to a whole slew of NeXTSTEP releases, from the earliest known release to the last one from 1997. There&#8217;s also a ton of applications added to make the experience feel more realistic. This makes Infinite Mac even more useful than it already was, ensuring it&#8217;s one of the best and easiest ways to experience old macOS and now NeXTSTEP releases through virtual machines (real ones, this time), available in your browser. I&#8217;ll be spending some time with these new additions for sure, since I&#8217;ve very little experience with NeXTSTEP other than whatever I vicariously gleamed through Steven Troughton-Smith&#8216;s toots on the subject over the years. Mihai Parparita is doing incredibly important work through Infinite Mac, and he deserves credit and praise for all he&#8217;s doing here.

## Happy birthday APFS, 7 years old today

date: 2024-03-27, from: OS News

Seven years ago, on 27 March 2017, Apple introduced one of the most fundamental changes in its operating systems since Mac OS X 10.0 Cheetah was released 16 years earlier. On that day, those who updated iOS to version 10.3 had their iPhone’s storage silently converted to the first release of Apple File System, APFS. Six months later, with the release of macOS 10.13 High Sierra on 25 September, Mac users followed suit. ↫ Howard Oakley The migration from HFS+ to APFS is still an amazing feat for Apple to have pulled off. Hundreds of millions devices converted from one filesystem to another, and barely anyone noticed &#8211; no matter how you look at it, that&#8217;s an impressive achievement, and the engineers who made it possible deserve all the praise they&#8217;re getting.

## Security Vulnerability in Saflok’s RFID-Based Keycard Locks

date: 2024-03-27, updated: 2024-03-26, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>It&#8217;s <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/saflok-hotel-lock-unsaflok-hack-technique/">pretty devastating</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today, Ian Carroll, Lennert Wouters, and a team of other security researchers are revealing a hotel keycard hacking technique they call <a href="https://unsaflok.com/">Unsaflok</a>. The technique is a collection of security vulnerabilities that would allow a hacker to almost instantly open several models of Saflok-brand RFID-based keycard locks sold by the Swiss lock maker Dormakaba. The Saflok systems are installed on 3 million doors worldwide, inside 13,000 properties in 131 countries. By exploiting weaknesses in both Dormakaba&#8217;s encryption and the underlying RFID system Dormakaba uses, known as MIFARE Classic, Carroll and Wouters have demonstrated just how easily they can open a Saflok keycard lock. Their technique starts with obtaining any keycard from a target hotel&#8212;say, by booking a room there or grabbing a keycard out of a box of used ones&#8212;then reading a certain code from that card with a $300 RFID read-write device, and finally writing two keycards of their own. When they merely tap those two cards on a lock, the first rewrites a certain piece of the lock&#8217;s data, and the second opens it...</p></blockquote>

<p>We&rsquo;re looking after Patches, my brother-in-law&rsquo;s dog, &ldquo;for the long weekend&rdquo; (until next Tuesday). He hasn&rsquo;t met Gidget before, and got himself bapbapbapped when he tried to give her a customary canine friendly greeting (sniffing her bum). Gidget was FURIOUS! After some time apart they settled down, though. Patches took a nap, and Gidget decided beating him up could be deferred in favour of just watching him like a hawk, and now they&rsquo;re <em>both</em> snoozing peacefully on the couch. What a relief 😅</p>

## Why a Climate Startup Is Building the World’s Biggest Airplane

date: 2024-03-27, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTgzMTkyMS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczMTMxMTU5N30.YC3cx13aYW1C2A-DZ3TdcyGLUXkrmniOik_8gN7HpWU/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">
	Radia is a $1 billion climate tech startup with an unusual pitch: It is trying to build the world’s largest airplane. Its proposed aircraft, the Radia Wind Runner, would be as long as a football field, nearly as wide as a New York city block, and capable of carrying 12 times the volume of a Boeing 747. Such a plane could ferry massive wind-turbine blades, unlocking what the company calls “gigawind” — the ability to build offshore-sized wind turbines on land.
</p><p>
	Why is that important? Because the larger the wind turbine, the more electricity that it generates — and the less wind it needs to work with. Radia says that its “gigawind” farms could profitably go into places with slower wind speeds, such as the Northeast or Mississippi Delta. They could also be built in the existing Wind Belt, potentially doubling current output.
</p><p>
	In this week’s episode, Rob and Jesse talk to Radia’s chief executive officer, Mark Lundstrom. (Jesse’s consulting firm did some research for Radia while it was in stealth mode, in 2020 and 2023.) We discuss why the world needs a bigger plane, how such a new aircraft gets licensed, and why massive wind turbines could be such a big deal for renewable electricity. Shift Key is hosted by Robinson Meyer, executive editor of Heatmap, and Jesse Jenkins, a Princeton professor of energy systems engineering.

	Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p><blockquote>
<strong>Jesse Jenkins: </strong>I’m here in the mechanical and aerospace engineering department at Princeton, so we’ve got a lot of students excited about new aerospace applications. I have a six-year-old kid, as well, and he’s also excited about anything that goes fast and is big, so I’m sure he’ll get excited about the eventual Lego kit for the WindRunner that we’ll have to get out in the world. But talk through the size of this aircraft compared to, say, something we’re used to, like a 737 or more conventional aircraft.
	<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Mark Lundstrom: </strong>Sure. So before understanding the size, one has to understand the fundamental mission requirements. And so the goal, Radia’s goal is to be able to move up to a 105 meter long object that could weigh up to 75 tons. Now we can also move multiple smaller blades, so two 95s, or three 85s, or four 75s. So the vehicle is quite versatile. <br/>
<br/>
	In terms of sheer size, it’s about 12 times the volume of a 747. So it’s very, very large compared to the 747. It’s about nine times the volume of the Antonovs. And yet what's very different about it — <br/>
<br/>
<strong>Jenkins:</strong>
	And the Antonov, that’s the largest plane built to date, right?
	<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Lundstrom:</strong> Yes, the largest volumetric plane right now. There’s about 14 or 15 of them left in the world, usually Russian or Ukrainian operated. <br/>
<br/>
<strong>Robinson Meyer:</strong> I was going to say, I remember the biggest plane in the world being destroyed right at the beginning of the Ukraine War and was wondering how that compared to the to the WindRunner vehicle.
	<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Lundstrom:</strong> So the Antonov 225, there was one of them. WindRunner is six times bigger in volume than that airplane was, and it’s nine times bigger in volume than the remaining Antonov 124s that are still out there. And so, and what’s additionally unusual about it, in addition to the size, is its ability to land on dirt. <br/>
<br/>
<strong>Meyer:
	</strong>Wow.
	<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Lundstrom:</strong>
	Things like Antonovs, 747s, etc., they need to land on about 9,000 feet of steel reinforced concrete, typically. And we designed the WindRunners so we could land on relatively short dirt strips, so just over a mile of a semi-prepared field. And that allows us to bring the payload into a wind farm, and be able to get a very large aircraft out of the wind farm. It’s probably the first time that an aircraft has been designed to optimize around volume, as opposed to mass. <br/>
<br/>
	Usually when an aircraft design team starts off, they’ll start off thinking about how much mass has to be moved. We really started off thinking about how much volume has to be moved. So there are aircraft that move larger mass than the WindRunner. There’s absolutely no aircraft that comes close to moving larger volumes and being able to land that volume on a relatively short dirt strip.

## March 26, 2024

## Winless Lottery Streak Ends: Someone Wins $1.12B Mega Millions

date: 2024-03-27, from: VOA News USA

DES MOINES, Iowa  — Someone in New Jersey overcame the odds Tuesday night and won the $1.12 billion Mega Millions jackpot, breaking a winless streak that dated to last December.


The numbers drawn were: 7, 11, 22, 29, 38 and 4. The winning ticket was sold in New Jersey, according the the Mega Millions website.


Until the latest drawing, no one had matched all six numbers and won the Mega Millions jackpot since Dec. 8. That amounted to 30 straight drawings without a big winner.


It’s tough to win the Mega Millions jackpot because the odds are so long, at 1 in 302.6 million.


The prize is the eighth largest in U.S. lottery history.


The $1.12 billion jackpot is for a winner who is paid through an annuity, with an initial payment and then 29 annual payments. Most winners choose a cash payout, which would be $537.5 million.


The next big U.S. lottery drawing will be Wednesday night for an estimated $865 million Powerball jackpot. No one has won that prize since New Year’s Day, making for 36 drawings without a winner.


Mega Millions is played in 45 states plus Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Powerball also is played in those states as well as Washington, D.C., the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.

## Top US Officials Warn Israel's Gallant Against Invading Rafah

date: 2024-03-27, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Top Biden administration officials urged Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant to abandon plans to invade the southern Gaza city of Rafah, where more than 1.4 million Palestinian civilians seek safety, as U.S.-Israel tensions brew over Israel's conduct in its six-month-old war against Hamas.


In meetings Monday and Tuesday, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken reaffirmed U.S. support for Israel's right to defend itself while reiterating opposition to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's planned ground offensive to target Hamas in Gaza's southernmost city on the border with Egypt.


"Our goal [is] to help Israel find an alternative to a full-scale and perhaps premature military operation that could endanger the over 1 million civilians that are sheltering in Rafah," a senior U.S. defense official told reporters Tuesday, briefing on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the Pentagon.


A major ground operation in Rafah would further jeopardize the welfare of Palestinian civilians, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said on Monday. He added that Blinken underscored to Gallant that "alternatives exist" that would both better ensure Israel's security and protect Palestinian civilians.




Amid a looming famine in Gaza, Austin warned of the "humanitarian catastrophe" in the Palestinian enclave, describing civilian casualties as "far too high" and aid deliveries as "far too low." His remarks echoed Blinken's calls for Israel "to immediately surge and sustain" more aid.


The Netanyahu government has denied accusations by international aid agencies and the United Nations that Israel is blocking aid and provoking famine in Gaza as part of its strategy to root out Hamas.


Similar admonitions were likely being conveyed by White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan. In a sign of potentially complicated talks, Sullivan's meeting with Gallant, originally scheduled for Monday, was extended an extra day.


"They believed it was important to continue the conversation," said White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.


Sullivan told reporters last week that President Joe Biden himself had warned Netanyahu an invasion in Rafah would be a mistake and urged him to have a "coherent and sustainable strategy" to defeat Hamas.


'Don't do it'


Netanyahu insists that the goal of "total victory" against Hamas cannot be achieved without going into Rafah, where Israel says there are four Hamas battalions composed of thousands of fighters.


Initially, the Biden administration said they would not support a Rafah offensive without sufficient protection of civilians.


Now, they're telling Israel, "Don't do it," said Aaron David Miller, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and former U.S. negotiator in Middle East peace talks.


"It's not now a question of making sure that the population is somehow safeguarded," he told VOA. "They just don't want the Israelis to do it."


Despite the pressure piled on Gallant this week, the decision on Rafah would have to be taken by the Israeli War Cabinet, whose members in addition to Gallant include Netanyahu and Benny Gantz, former minister of defense and deputy prime minister, as well as two observers — opposition politician Gadi Eisenkot and Ron Dermer, Netanyahu's close adviser.


Gallant's meetings have been the main high-level consultation mechanism between the U.S. and its ally, as Netanyahu abruptly canceled plans for a visit by a separate Israeli delegation.


That was done in protest of Washington's abstention at the U.N. that allowed the adoption of a Security Council resolution demanding an immediate cease-fire in Gaza and the release of hostages held by Hamas.


Netanyahu accused the U.S. of shifting from its prior position of conditioning the cease-fire call on the release of hostages, which the administration denies.


More weapons


Gallant, a security hawk who supports a ground operation in Rafah, had aimed to use his Washington visit to ramp up the transfer of American weapons. In remarks ahead of his meeting with Austin, he said he wants to "ensure Israel's military edge and capabilities."


Israel needs U.S. arms not only for the campaign in Gaza but also to prepare for further escalation in the north of the country with Hezbollah in Lebanon, said Brian Finucane, senior adviser for the U.S. Program at the International Crisis Group. Since the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks, the two sides have exchanged fire through thousands of rocket and missile launches.


"The U.S. has real leverage here," Finucane told VOA. "The best-case scenario would be if the U.S. actually did use its abundant leverage, both unilaterally and multilaterally, to try to bring about a cease-fire."


While Biden has begun using his diplomatic leverage by abstaining at the U.N., he is unlikely to condition or restrict military aid to Israel as he aims to keep the conflict from spreading.


"The last thing he should want to do is to send an unmistakable signal to Hezbollah and Iran that we're not prepared to back the Israelis, if, in fact, there is an escalation in the Israeli northern border," said Miller.


The most fundamental goal for Biden right now, he said, is reaching a deal in the cease-fire negotiations in Qatar. Hamas says it will release hostages only as part of a deal that would end the war, while Israel says it will discuss only a temporary pause.




US arms for Israel


The U.S. has committed to provide Israel with nearly $4 billion a year in aid through 2028, most of it in the form of military assistance. Approximately $3.3 billion per year is given under the Foreign Military Financing program, funds that Israel must use to purchase U.S. military equipment and services.


Since the Gaza war began, the administration has quietly delivered more than 100 separate foreign military sales to Israel. The arms transfers were processed without public debate because the administration broke up the sales packages in amounts below the threshold that requires them to notify Congress, according to a defense official who spoke to VOA on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive military matter.


Under pressure from Democratic lawmakers, last month the White House released a National Security Memorandum requiring the U.S. secretary of state to "obtain credible and reliable written assurances" from foreign governments that U.S. weapons are used in accordance with international and humanitarian law.


Gallant delivered Israel's required written assurances ahead of the deadline on Sunday. Under the memorandum, the State Department has until early May to formally assess and report to Congress whether those assurances are "credible and reliable." Without it, Biden has the option of suspending further U.S. arms transfers.


So far, Biden has not indicated any willingness to do so. In his call with Netanyahu last week, the president "didn't make threats," Sullivan said. "Each of them recognizes that we are at a critical moment in this conflict."

## Plasma 5: the early years

date: 2024-03-26, from: OS News

With KDE’s 6th Mega Release finally out the door, let’s reflect on the outgoing Plasma 5 that has served us well over the years. Can you believe it has been almost ten years since Plasma 5.0 was released? Join me on a trip down memory lane and let me tell you how it all began. This coincidentally continues pretty much where my previous retrospective blog post concluded. ↫ Kai Uwe It took them a few years after the release of Plasma 5.0, but eventually they won me over, and I&#8217;m now solid in the KDE camp, after well over a decade of either GNOME or Cinnamon. GNOME has strayed far too much away from just being a traditional desktop user interface, and Cinnamon is dragging its heels with Wayland support, but luckily KDE has spent a long time now clearing up so many of the paper cuts that used to plague them every time I tried KDE. That&#8217;s all in the past now. They&#8217;ve done a solid job cleaning up a lot of the oddities and inconsistencies during Plasma 5&#8217;s lifecycle, and I can&#8217;t wait until Fedora 40 hits the streets with Plasma 6 in tow. In the desktop Linux world, I feel KDE and Qt will always play a little bit of second fiddle to the (seemingly) much more popular GNOME and GTK+, but that&#8217;s okay &#8211; this kind of diversity and friendly competition is what makes each of these desktops better for their respective users. And this is the Linux world, after all &#8211; you&#8217;re not tied down to anything your current desktop environment does, and you&#8217;re free to switch to whatever else at a moment&#8217;s notice if some new update doesn&#8217;t sit well with you. I can&#8217;t imagine using something like macOS or Windows where you have to just accept whatever garbage they throw at you with nowhere to go.

## Canonical expands Long Term Support to 12 years starting with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

date: 2024-03-26, from: OS News

Today, Canonical announced the general availability of Legacy Support, an Ubuntu Pro add-on that expands security and support coverage for Ubuntu LTS releases to 12 years. The add-on will be available for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS onwards.&#160; Long term supported Ubuntu releases get five years of standard security maintenance on the main Ubuntu repository. Ubuntu Pro expands that commitment to 10 years on both the main and universe repositories, providing enterprises and end users alike access to a vast secure open source software library. The subscription also comes with a phone and ticket support tier. Ubuntu Pro paying customers can purchase an extra two years of security maintenance and support with the new Legacy Support add-on. ↫ Canonical blog Assuming all of this respects the open source licenses of the countless software packages that make up Ubuntu, this seems like a reasonable way to offer quite a long support lifecycle for those that really need it. Such support doesn&#8217;t come free, and it I think it&#8217;s entirely reasonable to try and get compensated for the work required in maintaining that level of support for 10 or 12 years. If you want this kind of longevity from your Linux installation without paying for it, you&#8217;ll have to maintain it yourself. Seems reasonable to me.

## US Aims to Tap Domestic Lithium Supply Without Chinese Products

date: 2024-03-26, from: VOA News USA

washington  — Earlier this month, the U.S. Department of Energy announced a record conditional loan of $2.26 billion to tap the largest known lithium reserves in North America. The loan is an important step in an effort by the U.S. government to reduce reliance on China for the metal used to make batteries.


Analysts, however, say that it may be too late to move away from reliance on China completely when it comes to metal processing and the production of batteries.


The DOE’s Loan Programs Office (LPO) says the funds, if approved after review, will help the Lithium Americas Corp. construct a lithium carbonate processing plant at the Thacker Pass mine project in Humboldt County, Nevada.


The LPO says the project would help “secure reliable, sustainable domestic supply chains for critical materials, which are key to reaching our ambitious clean energy and climate goals and reducing our reliance on economic competitors like China.”


Lithium Americas Corp. on its official website says battery materials could be “completely sourced and manufactured in the U.S., bringing down the overall carbon footprint, transport costs and supply chain risks.”


The LPO says lithium carbonate from Thacker Pass could eventually support the production of batteries “for up to 800,000 electric vehicles (EVs) per year, saving 317 million gallons of gasoline per year.”


Although the U.S. has made pioneering and groundbreaking contributions to the development of the lithium ion battery, industry experts say lithium processing and EV battery production is dominated today by China.


“Parts of our key supply chains, including for clean energy, are currently over concentrated in China,” said U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in prepared remarks March 2 when she visited a U.S. lithium processing facility in Chile, which holds the world’s largest reserves of the metal.


“This makes America more vulnerable to shocks in China, or whatever country dominates production, from natural disasters to macroeconomic forces, to deliberate actions such as economic coercion.”


A report last year by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development said China increased restrictions on its exports of critical minerals ninefold between 2009 and 2020.


Data from the U.S. Geological Survey shows the output and scale of lithium mines in Australia and Argentina far exceed China’s. In 2022, Australia's lithium mine output was more than three times China's.


Refining, processing still issues


But industry experts say while Western countries have poured a lot of investment into developing raw minerals, they have paid little attention to refining and processing, areas in which China dominates.


Ellen R. Wald, a nonresident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council Global Energy Center, tells VOA, "Lithium is not useful just as it is. You have to refine it to make what's used in the batteries. And that's really where China controls the supply chain because almost all of the refining for lithium that creates it into the substance that can be used to make batteries is done in China."


According to the Chatham House, Chinese companies accounted for about 72% of global lithium refining capacity in 2022.


China also dominates much of the global market for battery-related equipment, leaving limited options for U.S. companies that want to showcase their domestic production credentials.


American Battery Factory Inc., or ABF, is an emerging battery manufacturer that says it is “the first network of entirely U.S.-owned vertical manufacturing, supply chain and R&D for Lithium Iron Phosphate battery cells in the United States.”


But to secure custom automation equipment and machinery for use in its first large-scale rechargeable battery factory in Tucson, Arizona, it has formed a partnership with Lead Intelligent Equipment, a Chinese company.


Dependent on China


In an article in January, Wald said China is in a good position to restrict access to lithium-ion batteries to certain countries or companies as it wishes, and if the U.S. military suddenly finds itself in need of more specialized batteries, the Pentagon may not be able to obtain them.


In February 2022, China announced sanctions against Lockheed Martin, the manufacturer of the F-35 fighter jet, and Raytheon Technologies, the world's largest missile manufacturer. Although China did not specify the details of the sanctions, it is generally considered to be a possible threat to cut off the Western countries' supply of critical minerals.


Wald told VOA, "The U.S. defense industry is basically dependent on China for these specialized batteries that they need in all of their drones and their surveillance systems and all sorts of things."


David Whittle, adjunct professor in resource engineering at the Department of Civil Engineering at Monash University in Australia, told VOA even if "the world develops a robust, independent supply chain for lithium, up to the point of battery chemical production, at present, China would still be the largest customer for those chemicals, since it is the largest cell manufacturer, the largest battery pack manufacturer, the largest E.V. manufacturer and the largest market for E.V.s."


The Thacker Pass lithium mine is located at the southern end of the McDermitt Caldera, and is considered to be one of the largest in the world.


The record loan to Lithium Americas Corp. is the largest such loan the U.S. has offered for the development of a lithium mine project since the country stepped up its efforts to build a domestic supply chain for critical minerals in recent years.


The Thacker Pass lithium project is not expected to start production until 2028, and even then, Wald said, that goal may be too ambitious. The mine plans to extract lithium from clay, but Wald says it has never been mined in this way on a commercial scale. In addition, the mine is in a remote and sparsely populated location, requiring the company to build housing for workers and their families and to reassess its environmental impact.


Despite the challenges, Wald said creating a secure supply chain is not impossible for the U.S.


"I don't think it's too late," Wald said. "Will they be able to compete with China globally? Probably not. But can we create non-Chinese sustainable and secure supply chains? Yeah, we can do it."


Whittle said Western countries being "resilient to challenges from China" can't mean "isolated from China" anymore, but resilience is still possible.


The DOE’s LPO said while their announcement shows intent to give the loan, the company must first satisfy certain technical, legal, environmental and financial conditions before the funds will be released.

## Critics Slam Apple CEO Tim Cook for Laudatory Remarks in China

date: 2024-03-26, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Tim Cook, CEO of the American technology giant Apple, is facing criticism at home over laudatory remarks he made about China during a recent visit to try to boost sagging iPhone sales in the lucrative market. 


Cook was in Shanghai for the opening of China's largest Apple retail store on Friday and met with Chinese political and business people. He praised China for being "so vibrant and so dynamic," in remarks widely quoted by state media and Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying. 


 




The new Apple store took seven years and cost over 80 million yuan (roughly $11.1 million) to build. It is said to be the second largest in the world and the largest in Asia, and it is staffed by about 150 people. 


Thursday evening, at least 12 hours before the scheduled opening, a long line had formed in front of the store. Some media said the crowds were "as bustling as New Year's Eve." 


In addition to showing their loyalty to the brand by purchasing Apple products, the opening day crowds rushed to take photos with Cook, who was in the store at the event.


Dan Ives, a technology analyst on Wall Street, said on X, formerly Twitter, that Cook's trip to China shows that Apple will continue to attach importance to the Chinese market.


"Apple is actually increasing its investments and retail footprint in China the past year," he said, "and to this point Cook has been in China since last week on an important visit to lay the groundwork on Apple's future in China. Cook reaffirming China strategy." 


 




Chinese media reported on Monday that Apple will cooperate with Chinese technology company Baidu to provide artificial intelligence capabilities to the iPhones sold in China this year. Baidu has not verified the report. 


However, not all Chinese love Apple. A viral video clip on Chinese social media shows a middle-aged Chinese woman in yellow clothes, a baseball cap and a mask yelling at the people who queued up at the new Apple store the night before its opening, "You worship and favor foreign things."  


 




She also said Apple's business expansion in China is "because of scum like you who are willing to pay for it." 


A person in the line said, "Do you know how many jobs Apple brings to China every year?"  


The woman replied, "No need, we have our own Huawei!" 


The drama reflects the challenges Apple is facing in China. IPhone shipments in China fell about 33% in February from a year earlier, according to official data, marking a second consecutive month of lower shipments. 


In January, the company shipped a total of roughly 5.5 million units, or about 39% fewer handsets than in the prior year, according to China Academy of Information and Communications Technology figures. 


Frank Lee, a senior partner of Blue Ocean Capital in Beijing, said that most Chinese iPhone users have a good experience with Apple products, so they remain loyal to the brand. However, there is a clear trend of declining sales of Apple products due to competition with Chinese domestic brands. 


Lee told VOA, "I think Apple's opening of a store in Shanghai will play a certain role in [boosting] its sales in China, but it cannot fundamentally reverse the overall slow decline trend of iPhones in China." 


However, Cook expressed his confidence in the Chinese market. He told the Chinese media, "I love the people and the culture [of China]. Every time I come here, I'm reminded that anything is possible here." 


Cook's remarks have been criticized as glorifying the Chinese government's arrogant treatment of private enterprises. 


Jonathan Eyal, associate director of the Royal United Services Institute for Defense and Security Studies in the U.K., wrote on X, "'Everything is possible' in China, says Apple's Tim Cook. Including being arrested and expropriated. And losing the market at a stroke of a bureaucratic pen." 


 




Theresa Fallon, director at the Centre for Russia Europe Asia Studies, wrote, "Apple chief Tim Cook's obsequious praise for China ... unlikely to reverse the tide and CCP mandates that government officials can't use Apple phones."  


 




Bloomberg reported last year that a growing number of Chinese government agencies and state-owned enterprises were ordering employees not to bring iPhones and other foreign-brand phones to the workplace. China's Foreign Ministry did not confirm the report. 


Some observers believe Cook's remarks were not sincere. In recent years, Apple has expanded its production in India. Last year, iPhones made in India appeared for the first time in the first batch of iPhone 15 models released globally. 


However, others say China is irreplaceable to the global supply chain. They noted that Apple has faced challenges in efficiency since its supplier Foxconn moved production lines to India in the past couple of years. 


Noah Smith, an American current affairs columnist, wrote, "LOLLLLLLL meanwhile he's shifting production out of China as fast as he can." 


 




Some critics of Cook are more serious. Sophie Richardson, former China director at Human Rights Watch, said, ".@tim_cook, about those "vibrant" and "dynamic" #crimesagainsthumanity committed by your #China govt hosts…?"  


 




Eli Friedman, associate professor of global labor and work at Cornell University, said the past mutually beneficial relationship between Beijing and American companies is no longer playing a diplomatic role. 


He wrote, "Throwing Apple some treats will not help stabilize the U.S.-China relationship, I promise."

## $1.12 Billion Mega Millions Drawing Nears, Followed by $865 Million Powerball Prize

date: 2024-03-26, from: VOA News USA

DES MOINES, Iowa — Another day, another giant lottery jackpot. 


Next up is an estimated $1.12 billion Mega Millions prize on Tuesday night, enticing players who hope to win the eighth-largest prize in U.S. lottery history even though no one has won the jackpot since December 8, 2023. That is 30 consecutive drawings without a jackpot winner.


Miss out on that drawing? No problem. There will be a drawing Wednesday night for an estimated $865 million Powerball jackpot. No one has won that prize either since New Year's Day, making for 36 drawings without a winner. 


For both games, the long drought of jackpots is no accident. The games have long odds specifically to create large jackpots that will generate lots of interest and sales. 


For Mega Millions, the odds are 1 in 302.6 million, and for Powerball they are 1 in 292.2 million. 


The $1.12 billion Mega Millions prize is for a sole winner who chooses to be paid through an annuity over 30 years. A winner who opts for a cash payout would get $537.5 million. 


Those winnings would be subject to federal taxes, and some states also tax lottery winnings. 


Mega Millions is played in 45 states plus Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Powerball also is played in those states as well as Washington, D.C., the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.

## US President Biden Wins Missouri Democratic Primary

date: 2024-03-26, from: VOA News USA

COLUMBIA, MISSOURI — U.S. President Joe Biden has won Missouri's primary, the state Democratic Party announced. 


Biden's win was not in doubt; he has already beaten his major competitors. But the primary races are still closely watched by insiders for turnout and signs of protest voters. 


Saturday's primary was the Missouri Democratic Party's first party-run presidential contest since a new law took effect in August 2022. 


The party says about 20,000 voters participated. 


Missouri Republicans opted to hold a caucus this year, which former President Donald Trump won. 


Lawmakers have failed to reinstate the state-run primary despite calls to do so by both state Republican and Democratic party leaders.

## The Real Point of Republicans’ Energy Week

date: 2024-03-26, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTg0NjQ0My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0NDE0NjA3NX0.iHmXsBUL4yzwGsJw8HGIYLuQGE8ugftARm6vaTZF-YY/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">Republicans in Washington do not have a great track record executing themed policy weeks. Consider the Trump administration’s original 2017 Infrastructure Week, which had the misfortune of <a href="https://www.politico.com/interactives/2017/trump-health-care-policy-energy-week/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">coinciding</a> with former FBI Director James Comey’s live testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee. Or take the Infrastructure Week scheduled a few months after that, which Trump famously <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/15/us/politics/trump-press-conference-transcript.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article®ion=Footer" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">derailed</a> by blaming “both sides” for the white supremacist-initiated violence in Charlottesville. Or take the Infrastructure Week <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/01/us/politics/coronavirus-infrastructure-week-timeline.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">after <em>that</em> one</a>, when — well, you get it.</p>
<p>Past attempts at holding an Energy Week haven’t fared much better, and unless you’re an incredibly close reader of procedural political news, it’s possible you missed that last week was an Energy Week, too. (<a href="https://rollcall.com/2024/03/22/house-passes-sweeping-fiscal-2024-spending-package/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">What else</a> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-bring-resolution-calling-ceasefire-gaza-vote-un-friday-2024-03-21/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">could you possibly</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/03/20/smoke-fire-virginia-maryland-montgomery-prince-william-howard/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">have been</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/KensingtonRoyal/status/1771235267837321694" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">thinking about</a>?) </p>
<p>On the surface, Energy Week 2024 didn’t offer much worth paying attention to, which could also explain the absence of headlines. The House used the occasion to vote on four energy-related bills that have no chance of surviving in the Democrat-controlled Senate: H.R. 1023 (passed 209-204), which would repeal the Inflation Reduction Act’s $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund; H.R. 1121 (passed 229-188, with 15 Democratic “<a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/202493" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">yeas</a>”), which prevents the president from imposing a moratorium on fracking without the authorization of Congress; H.R. 6009 (passed 216-200), a Lauren Boebert-sponsored bill that would block the Interior’s update of oil and gas leasing regulations; and H.R.7023 (passed 213-205), which chips away at Clean Water Act rules. The House also passed two non-binding resolutions, one that “denounces the harmful, anti-American energy policies of the Biden administration” and another that condemns the <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/carbon-tax-2025" target="_self">carbon tax</a>, which saw 10 <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/epa-rules-biden" target="_self">vulnerable Democrats</a> join Republicans voting in favor of it.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called these efforts “<a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?ref=watch_permalink&v=931401285439407" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bogus and nasty</a>,” so it seems pretty clear these bills are destined to die somewhere between the House and Senate chambers, and the left mostly laughed them off. California Democratic Representative Scott Peters <a href="https://scottpeters.house.gov/2024/3/rep-peters-calls-out-house-gop-energy-week-as-political-theatre" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">slammed</a> Energy Week as an “unserious messaging exercise.” The Environmental Defense Fund called the week a <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/green-groups-plot-counterattack-for-gop-energy-week/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">waste</a>. Longtime Hill commentator Jamie Dupree treated the affair to an eye roll <a href="https://jamiedupree.substack.com/p/energy-week-features-bills-already" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in his Substack</a>, noting that three of the bills voted on last week — H.R. 1121, H.R. 1023, and H.R. 1141 — were <em>already approved </em>by the House as part of the Lower Energy Costs Act (H.R. 1) last spring. </p>
<p>House Republican Leader Steve Scalise seemed to acknowledge this overlap in a recent <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/qa-scalise-talks-ira-repeal-evs-and-hopes-for-trump/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview with <em>E&E News</em></a>, complaining that H.R. 1 has languished in the Senate “for about a year now” — though, as Dupree points out, the bill <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/1/all-actions?s=1&r=1&q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22HR1%22%7D" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">never actually got sent</a> by the House to the upper chamber, a delay for which “I can’t get any Republicans on Capitol Hill to give me a straight answer,” Dupree wrote.</p>
<p>In other words, Energy Week appears to be a classic case of <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/esg-hearing-congress-oversight-weird" target="_self">political theater</a>. But that doesn’t mean it was all meaningless. It’s always worth asking who, exactly, is all the song and dance for? </p>
<p>It may not have been another unfortunate policy-week coincidence that Energy Week lined up perfectly with CERAWeek, the energy summit held in Houston, where the head of Saudi Aramco called the phase-out of oil and gas a “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/19/climate/ceraweek-saudi-fantasy-energy-transition.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fantasy</a>.” <a href="https://www.axios.com/pro/energy-policy/2024/03/18/what-to-watch-during-energy-week" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">What was not included</a> on the Energy Week slate is also revealing — for instance, Washington Republican Cathy McMorris Rodgers’ hydropower permitting bill. Perhaps it was excluded because it would have represented an <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/permitting-reform-transmission-nepa-geothermal" target="_self">actual attempt at policy-making</a>, which is not what Energy Week was all about?</p>
<p>Danielle Butcher Franz, the CEO of the American Conservation Coalition’s Action Fund, told me in an emailed statement that she thinks “Congressional Republicans were right to celebrate American energy and push for domestic energy production” last week. But she also expressed disappointment over the party missing a “critical opportunity to demonstrate that American energy is clean energy,” and called the dismissal of climate change by some of the Republican members “frustrating and unproductive.” Butcher Franz added, for example, that expanding nuclear energy, building more energy projects, and <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/chinese-ev-cars-biden" target="_self">beating China</a> could have been “conservative approaches” to lowering emissions that nevertheless were absent from the slate of energy bills.</p>
<p>Energy Week wasn’t entirely pointless as a policymaking exercise, though. Sure, it was largely a wink to <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/power-switch/2023/10/12/speaker-scalise-oil-industry-says-yes-please-00121197" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">donors</a>, but it also marked a show of alignment on priorities at a time when <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/mike-johnson-gop-house-implosion" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Republicans’ ability to get things done</a> could reasonably make fossil fuel interests nervous. That Energy Week’s bills also align with the goals of the Heritage Foundation-authored <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-climate-change-project-2025" target="_self">playbook for a Republican presidency</a> is further reassurance that the party is pursuing policies aimed at reducing barriers to new leasing and drilling rather than repeating <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/03/23/oil-gas-execs-unhappy-biden-trump-00148597" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the chaos</a> of the previous administration. It’s organized. It’s intentional. It’s setting the stage.</p><p>Of course, none of this will matter if Democrats and <a href="https://www.brianfitzpatrick.com/issues/protecting-our-environment/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">climate-moderate Republicans</a> win elections this year. But if that <em>doesn’t</em> happen, well — we might end up looking back at Energy Week and wondering how we ever missed it.</p>

## Pushing People into Poverty and Public Health Crisis: Maryland's Recent Energy Cost Increases Could Add Up to an Equity Disaster

date: 2024-03-26, updated: 2024-03-26, from: RAND blog

This month, utility prices began increasing throughout Baltimore City and in nearby counties, and will continue to increase over the next two years. The U.S. Department of Energy is taking key steps to work directly with communities affected by undue energy burdens to better understand how to improve the equity of the energy system. Maryland could follow that example.

## Trump Faces Gag Order in New York Hush Money Criminal Case

date: 2024-03-26, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — Donald Trump on Tuesday was hit with a judge's gag order sought by prosecutors in his upcoming criminal trial involving hush money paid to a porn star, restricting him from publicly commenting about witnesses and court staff. 


Ahead of the former U.S. president's trial, which is scheduled to begin April 15 in the New York state court, Justice Juan Merchan granted a request for the order made last month by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office. 


The prosecution sought an order blocking Trump from "making or directing others to make" statements about witnesses concerning their role in the case and from commenting on court staff and prosecutors other than Bragg himself. 


Silencing Trump was necessary because of his "longstanding history of attacking witnesses, investigators, prosecutors, judges and others involved in legal proceedings against him," prosecutors said.  


Trump's lawyers argued that a gag order would violate his right to free speech under the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment, leaving him defenseless against attacks by political opponents over the case. 


Merchan separately ruled on March 7 that jurors were to remain anonymous except to Trump, his lawyers, prosecutors and a handful of others, after prosecutors highlighted Trump's history of publicly deriding trial jurors and grand jurors. 


Bragg's case is one of four criminal indictments the Republican presidential candidate faces, with Trump pleading not guilty in all the cases and portraying them as politically motivated. 


It could be the only case to reach trial before his expected Nov. 5 rematch with President Joe Biden. 


Trump pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to hide reimbursements to his former lawyer Michael Cohen for a $130,000 payment to porn star Stormy Daniels to buy her silence before the 2016 election about a sexual encounter she claimed to have had with Trump a decade earlier. 


Trump has denied having the encounter with Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford.  


The requested gag order was similar to restrictions a federal judge imposed last year in a criminal case over Trump's efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss to Biden. 


Trump also faces state criminal charges in Georgia over his push to reverse the 2020 results, and federal criminal charges in Florida over his handling of sensitive government documents after leaving the White House in 2021.  


In a separate civil fraud case brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James, another New York state judge fined Trump $15,000 last year for twice violating a gag order against publicly talking about court staff.  


Trump is appealing a $454.2 million judgment in that case for misstating the values of his family real estate company's properties to dupe lenders. On March 25, a midlevel state appeals court paused that judgment as long as Trump posts a smaller $175 million bond within 10 days.

## The Baltimore Bridge Collapse Is Throwing the U.S. Coal Market for a Loop

date: 2024-03-26, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTgzNzk4My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczMTA3ODU2Nn0.YxniJARkyqyJqQAqZRIxPnnTh6fxaMTqN48d9A6Cqj4/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p>The Port of Baltimore — currently closed to container traffic thanks to the <a href="https://www.wbaltv.com/article/baltimore-bridge-collapse-key-bridge/60303975" target="_blank">collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge</a> early Tuesday morning — plays a pivotal role in the energy trade, but not for anything that the Biden administration would like to talk about. It’s not some major nexus for clean energy components (although many cars go in and out of it), or even the liquefied natural gas that the U.S. proudly ships to Europe (that’s about 80 miles south at the Cove Point in Lusby, Maryland). </p><p>Instead, what’s flowing through Baltimore is coal.</p><p>The Port of Baltimore is the second largest coal export facility in the U.S. About 20% of U.S. the country’s coal exports ran through the port in 2022, <a href="https://www.eia.gov/state/?sid=MD" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the Energy Information Administration</a>. In the first nine months of 2023, the most recent period for which data is available, about 20 million short tons of coal traveled through the port, a <a href="https://www.eia.gov/coal/production/quarterly/pdf/t13p01p1.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">20% jump</a> from the same period in 2022. (At the Port of Virginia, about 150 nautical miles to the south, that figure was 26 million short tons, up just 6% from the beginning of 2022.)</p><p>U.S. coal <a href="https://www.eia.gov/coal/production/quarterly/pdf/qcr-all.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">largely went to Europe and Asia</a>, with big jumps in exports to Indonesia and Vietnam. The biggest recipients of U.S. coal are India, South Korea, China, and the Netherlands, where coal is shipped for transport across Europe.</p><p>The projected block up of coal exports could last more than a month, one coal shipping executive <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-26/baltimore-bridge-collapse-will-likely-block-coal-exports-for-weeks?utm_content=asia&utm_source=twitter&cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-asia&utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&utm_medium=social" target="_blank">told </a><em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-26/baltimore-bridge-collapse-will-likely-block-coal-exports-for-weeks?utm_content=asia&utm_source=twitter&cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-asia&utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&utm_medium=social">Bloomberg</a></em>. While it’s still unknown exactly how long the port will be closed to container traffic, the effect of the collapse is already visible in the stock prices of coal companies that use the port. </p><p>Shares of Consol Energy, for instance, which ships more than 10 million tons of coal annually through a terminal at the Port of Baltimore, are down 7% for the day. Consol’s coal comes from mines in southeastern Pennsylvania and southern West Virginia, where it’s then shipped by rail to Baltimore. Shares of one rail company that services the terminal, Norfolk Southern, dipped in early trading Tuesday but were flat Tuesday afternoon, while shares in CSX, the other rail company that serves Consol’s terminal, were down 2%.<br/><br/>“We do not have a definitive timeline of when vessel access or normal operations will resume,” Consol <a href="https://investors.consolenergy.com/2024-03-26-CONSOL-Energy-Issues-Notice-on-Francis-Scott-Key-Bridge-Collapse-in-Baltimore,-MD" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a statement Tuesday</a>. “We are looking at all available options to us to minimize or address direct and indirect impacts to the Company and its operations.”</p><p>In terms of its effects on the overall energy market, the port’s indefinite closure could be mild and may actually result in lower energy prices in the Northeast, as coal that would have been exported becomes, essentially, stranded stateside, Greg Brew, an analyst at the Eurasia Group, told me. But even this effect may be muted, Brew explained, because the weather is warming up with the end of winter, meaning there’s less demand on natural gas for heating.</p><p><span></span>“That can’t be too affected by more cheap coal sitting around,” Brew said.</p><p><span></span>The port is also a major throughway for imports and exports of cars, with around 750,000 cars <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/gm-ford-will-reroute-baltimore-shipments-after-bridge-collapse-2024-03-26/" target="_blank">going through it</a>. GM and Ford said that they were diverting shipments around the port.</p>

## US Sanctions Assad Supporters Over Drug Trafficking

date: 2024-03-26, from: VOA News USA

Washington — The U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned 11 people and companies on Tuesday it said were involved in illicit financial transfers and drug smuggling in support of the government of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. 


Many of those sanctioned were involved in the trade of the highly addictive amphetamine captagon, which is illegally trafficked throughout the Middle East and Europe, the Treasury Department said in a statement.  


Syria has become the world's leading producer of the powerful drug, and its trade has helped bolster the Assad's government's coffers during the country's long-running civil war. 


"The revenue from the illicit Captagon trade has become a major source of income for the Assad regime, the Syrian armed forces, and Syrian paramilitary forces," the Treasury Department said in a statement.  


Those sanctioned include a Syrian national called Taher al-Kayali, who allegedly operates a company that purchased vessels to smuggle captagon and hashish.  


Maya Exchange Company, another Syria-based firm, is alleged to have facilitated "millions" of dollars of illicit transactions to benefit the Syrian government.  


"The Assad regime continues to employ a variety of schemes to evade sanctions and sustain its longstanding campaign of repression against its own citizens," Treasury under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence Brian Nelson said in a statement.  


This includes "trafficking in illegal drugs, exploiting currency exchanges, and leveraging seemingly legitimate businesses," he continued. 


"The United States remains committed to holding accountable those who seek to support this illicit financial activity at the expense of the Syrian people," he added.

As an organization grows in scale, the idiosyncrasy and distinctiveness that was originally informed by the taste of the founders moves toward the mean. Over time, things get more average. That’s because each new customer, each new supplier and each new employee wants or needs something a little more normal, at least sometimes. The drift &#8230;

## Friends don’t let friends export to CSV

date: 2024-03-26, from: OS News

I worked for a few years in the intersection between data science and software engineering. On the whole, it was a really enjoyable time and I&#8217;d like to have the chance to do so again at some point. One of the least enjoyable experiences from that time was to deal with big CSV exports. Unfortunately, this file format is still very common in the data science space. It is easy to understand why &#8212; it seems to be ubiquitous, present everywhere, it&#8217;s human-readable, it&#8217;s less verbose than options like JSON and XML, it&#8217;s super easy to produce from almost any tool. What&#8217;s not to like? ↫ Robin Kåveland I&#8217;m not going to pretend to be some sort of expert on this matter, but even as a casual it seems CSV isn&#8217;t exactly scalable to large data sets. It seems to work great for smaller exports and imports for personal use, but any more complicated matters it seems wholly unsuited for.

## How I turned a shipping container into a solar off-grid charging station with A/C

date: 2024-03-26, from: Electrek Feed

<div class="feat-image"><img src="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/solar-shed-header.jpg?quality=82&#038;strip=all&#038;w=1600" /></div><p>After one of my most recent <a href="https://electrek.co/2023/11/30/i-bought-container-full-of-electric-tractors-and-construction-equipment/">Alibaba import adventures</a>, I was left with a shipping container in my yard. These engineering wonders are great for many uses outside of merely transferring goods around the world, with one of the most common secondary uses being watertight storage units. That seemed like a great idea to put to use for all of my electric “toys”. Between my electric bikes, e-motorcycles, e-ATVs, electric tractors, and a few other things I’m probably forgetting, having a weather-sealed, solar-powered off-grid charging shed would be a big benefit. And if I could add an air-conditioning unit to keep the machines from baking in the sun (and function as a dehumidifier at the same time), then all the better. As it turned out, the project was a lot easier than I expected. Here’s how I did it.</p>

## The Rising Costs of Natural Catastrophes

date: 2024-03-26, from: Heatmap News

<em><strong>Current conditions:</strong> A cloud of Saharan dust is sweeping toward southern Europe • Malaysia’s oppressive heat wave could last through mid-April • The water temperature is about 48 degrees Fahrenheit in Baltimore Harbor, where rescuers are searching for survivors after the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge.</em>
</p><h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2><h3>1. Soaring losses from natural disasters ‘a new norm,’ says insurance giant</h3><p>
<strong></strong>Extremely costly natural disasters have become “a new norm,” and insured losses will double in 10 years due to climate change, according to one of the world’s largest reinsurers. In a <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=4e47c65722&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a> published today, Swiss Re, a firm that provides insurance for insurers, calculated that natural disasters resulted in insured losses of $108 billion in 2023, marking the fourth consecutive year of losses exceeding $100 billion. As <em>Bloomberg</em> <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=c5b94455cb&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">noted</a>, “only about 40% of economic losses globally are insured, meaning the total economic losses are much higher.”<br/>
<br/>
	The main reason losses were so high was the sheer frequency with which “medium severity” disasters occurred. These are events that cost between $1 billion and $5 billion, and they’re on the rise. Severe thunderstorms (also called severe convective storms, or SCS) have become “the second largest loss-making peril” behind tropical cyclones. The Midwest accounted for the highest percentage of insured losses from severe thunderstorms in the U.S. last year:

<small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Swiss Re</small>
</p><p>
	The report calls for adaptation measures, but concludes that “in the face of climate change, adaptation and insurance can only go so far. Mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions is also essential to counter the build-up of physical risks.”
</p><h3>2. Nissan outlines plan to slash EV manufacturing costs </h3><p>
<strong></strong>Nissan yesterday <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=2b46251e25&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a> a new business plan it hopes will “ensure sustainable growth and profitability” as it faces competition from Chinese rivals. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the strategy leans heavily on electric vehicles. The Japanese carmaker will launch 16 new EV models over the next three years and slash EV manufacturing costs by 30% in an effort to reach <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=2f1a1a05bd&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cost parity</a> with internal combustion engine vehicles by 2030. It’ll bring down costs by incorporating battery innovations and new manufacturing processes. And the company will make EVs in “families,” starting with a “main vehicle” and then building on that design with new variations that can be significantly cheaper and faster to produce.
</p><h3>3. EV startup Fisker faces bankruptcy</h3><p>
<strong></strong>The New York Stock Exchange yesterday <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=964699d068&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">halted</a> trading of electric vehicle startup Fisker Inc.’s shares and said it planned to delist the stock due to “abnormally low” share prices. The company had been in talks with a major automaker about a potential investment, but the deal fell through, which means its financials are in bad shape and bankruptcy may be looming. If the cash-strapped company fails, it would <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=9cde931862&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">join</a> the ranks of other embattled EV startups including Aptera and Detroit Automotive. Last week Fisker paused its EV production.

<strong></strong>Trader Joe’s is hiking the price of bananas for the first time in two decades. The grocery chain has long sold individual bananas for just 19 cents, but has raised the price to 23 cents. A spokesperson <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=972823563a&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told CNN</a> the change was due to cost increases. Earlier this month, industry experts gathering at the World Banana Forum <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=4a52aff37f&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">warned</a> that climate change was hurting banana production and supply chains and that this would soon result in higher banana prices for consumers.
</p><h3>5. Study shows how ‘cooling’ paints can reduce urban temperatures</h3><p>
<strong></strong>Special “cooling” paint can significantly reduce the temperatures of surfaces in cities and help pedestrians feel cooler, according to a new <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=3ae18102fe&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study</a> published in the journal <em>Sustainable Cities and Society</em>. The research is the first demonstration of how paints made to reflect the sun’s heat actually perform in the real world. For the study, researchers at Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University covered surfaces such as walls, rooftops, and pavements in an industrial neighborhood in Singapore. They found those surfaces were up to 2 degrees Celsius cooler than uncoated areas during the hottest time of the day, and that this helped pedestrians feel 1.5 degrees cooler. “This is a minimally intrusive solution for urban cooling that has an immediate effect,” <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=c45b052170&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> the study’s lead author, Dr. E V S Kiran Kumar Donthu. “By reducing the amount of heat absorbed in urban structures, we also reduce heat load in buildings, consequently reducing indoor air-conditioning energy consumption.” Below you can see some of the coated test surfaces:

## Maddow didn't go far enough

date: 2024-03-26, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/26/maddow.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I don't usually watch Maddow on Monday nights. I lost my faith in her when she went after Facebook a few years ago, not that Facebook didn't deserve her attention, but her arguments while condemning them were exaggerated. I knew the facts, she left out important details. </p>
<p>She steered viewers into believing things that weren't true. Didn't exactly lie, but pretty close. I figured if she does that for stories I know, then she's probably doing it other times when I wasn't so well informed. </p>
<p>But the <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2024/03/25/knicks-donte-divincenzo-franchise-record-pistons-nba/">Knicks</a> were blowing out the Pistons on the next channel over, and I had tuned in Jen Psaki, who as luck would have it, at the exact moment I switched, was explaining how the fact that she served in the Biden Administration before joining MSNBC was very different from the controversy over Ronna McDaniel, who Maddow went on to explain was basically a terrorist and traitor and Trump co-conspirator (not just an enabler), and not in a war that was over, but one that was still being fought, and not insignificant because this fascist movement has control of one of the two major parties in the US and McDaniel was instrumental in that. There are good arguments that she should be in a prisoner of war camp, not employed by one of America's major news networks.</p>
<p>That NBC hired McDaniel as a contributor says something awful about Maddow's employer. And Maddow, if she has any details on that, isn't saying what they are. </p>
<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/01/26/cartoonChicken.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I've had this problem with other reporters in the past whose owners were caught up in some controversy that made them newsworthy. The reporters refused to cover it, or even be a source for others who were. This is where journalism goes wrong imho. Maddow <i>should</i> know the details, and if she does, she is obligated to share them, because they are significant, and go to how much trust any of us should give to any news coming to us from NBC. Maybe she has to quit to do that, and if so, go ahead and quit. Because the shadow it casts over everything touched by NBC, which includes MSNBC and Maddow is just too freaking long. It's similar to the "news" she reported on Facebook, except now instead of steering us to believe lies, she's holding it back, and instead of it being about one very powerful social media company, it's about the future of the government of the US. And maybe she doesn't know, as <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/21810-it-is-difficult-to-get-a-man-to-understand-something">Upton Sinclair</a> once said: “It is difficult to get a [person] to understand something, when [their] salary depends on [them] not understanding it.” </p>
<p>I don't blame Maddow for liking her job. But as a reporter, there are more and more reasons not to trust her and esp to not trust the company that employs her. When it was obvious she wasn't going to tell us the story behind McDaniel's hiring, or even name the people responsible for it, I switched back to the Knicks, where at least I think I understand who they are and what they're trying to do.
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.memeorandum.com/240326/p49#a240326p49">Update</a>: MSNBC <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/03/26/nbc-news-ronna-mcdaniel-commentator">backed down</a> on hiring McDaniel. </p>

## On Secure Voting Systems

date: 2024-03-26, updated: 2024-03-21, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Andrew Appel shepherded a <a href="https://freedom-to-tinker.com/2024/03/18/suggested-principles-for-state-statutes-regarding-ballot-marking-and-vote-tabulation/">public comment</a>&#8212;signed by twenty election cybersecurity experts, including myself&#8212;on best practices for ballot marking devices and vote tabulation. It was written for the Pennsylvania legislature, but it&#8217;s general in nature.</p>
<p>From the executive summary:</p>
<blockquote><p>We believe that no system is perfect, with each having trade-offs. Hand-marked and hand-counted ballots remove the uncertainty introduced by use of electronic machinery and the ability of bad actors to exploit electronic vulnerabilities to remotely alter the results. However, some portion of voters mistakenly mark paper ballots in a manner that will not be counted in the way the voter intended, or which even voids the ballot. Hand-counts delay timely reporting of results, and introduce the possibility for human error, bias, or misinterpretation...</p></blockquote>

## Run Windows 95 to XP, Mac OS 8.6 to 10.4 in your browser, sort of

date: 2024-03-26, from: OS News

Complete desktops contain all operating system components as well as Internet Explorer and Outlook Express. Where possible, I have tried to include built in file transfer programs (Web Publishing Wizard, Web Folders), useful system tools (System File Checker, System Restore) and certain wizards (Network Setup Wizard, Internet Connection Wizard). As a result, some of the desktops are quite large and can take some time to load. ↫ VirtualDesktop.org These are easily loaded virtual machines  inside your browser, for various versions of Windows and macOS. There&#8217;s more and more of these websites now, and while I don&#8217;t use them for anything, they&#8217;re still quite handy in a pinch. And let&#8217;s face it &#8211; it&#8217;s still kind of magical to see entire operating systems running inside a browser. The website also has several virtual machines without applications, and application-specific virtual machines, too, focused on browsers and mail clients.
