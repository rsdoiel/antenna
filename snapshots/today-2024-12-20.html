<h2 id="december-in-llms-has-been-a-lot">December in LLMs has been a
lot</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-20, updated: 2024-12-20, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs
Weblog</p>
<p>
I had big plans for December: for one thing, I was hoping to get to an
actual RC of Datasette 1.0, in preparation for a full release in
January. Instead, I‚Äôve found myself distracted by a
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/search/?tag=llms&amp;year=2024&amp;month=12">constant
barrage</a> of new LLM releases.
</p>
<p>
On December 4th Amazon introduced the
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/4/amazon-nova/"><strong>Amazon
Nova family</strong></a> of multi-modal models - clearly priced to
compete with the excellent and inexpensive Gemini 1.5 series from
Google. I got those working with
<a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a> via a new
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-bedrock">llm-bedrock</a> plugin.
</p>
<p>
The next big release was
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/6/llama-33/"><strong>Llama
3.3 70B-Instruct</strong></a>, on December 6th. Meta claimed that this
70B model was comparable in quality to their much larger 405B model, and
those claims seem to hold weight.
</p>
<p>
I wrote about how
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/9/llama-33-70b/">I can now
run a GPT-4 class model on my laptop</a> - the same laptop that was
running a GPT-3 class model just 20 months ago.
</p>
<p>
Llama 3.3 70B has started showing up from API providers now, including
super-fast hosted versions from both
<a href="https://groq.com/new-ai-inference-speed-benchmark-for-llama-3-3-70b-powered-by-groq/">Groq</a>
(276 tokens/second) and
<a href="https://cerebras.ai/inference">Cerebras</a> (a quite frankly
absurd 2,200 tokens/second). If you haven‚Äôt tried Val Town‚Äôs
<a href="https://cerebrascoder.com/">Cerebras Coder</a> demo you really
should.
</p>
<p>
I think the huge gains in model efficiency are one of the defining
stories of LLMs in 2024. It‚Äôs not just the local models that have
benefited: the price of proprietary hosted LLMs has dropped through the
floor, a result of both competition between vendors and the increasing
efficiency of the models themselves.
</p>
<p>
Last year the running joke was that every time Google put out a new
Gemini release OpenAI would ship something more impressive that same day
to undermine them.
</p>
<p>
The tides have turned! This month Google shipped four updates that took
the wind out of OpenAI‚Äôs sails.
</p>
<p>
The first was
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/6/gemini-exp-1206/"><strong>gemini-exp-1206</strong></a>
on December 6th, an experimental model that jumped straight to the top
of some of the leaderboards. Was this our first glimpse of Gemini 2.0?
</p>
<p>
That was followed by
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/11/gemini-2/"><strong>Gemini
2.0 Flash</strong></a> on December 11th, the first official release in
Google‚Äôs Gemini 2.0 series. The streaming support was particularly
impressive, with
<a href="https://aistudio.google.com/live">https://aistudio.google.com/live</a>
demonstrating streaming audio and webcam communication with the
multi-modal LLM a full day before OpenAI released their own streaming
camera/audio features in an update to ChatGPT.
</p>
<p>
Then this morning Google shipped
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/19/gemini-thinking-mode/"><strong>Gemini
2.0 Flash ‚ÄúThinking mode‚Äù</strong></a>, their version of the inference
scaling technique pioneered by OpenAI‚Äôs o1. I did <em>not</em> expect
Gemini to ship a version of that before 2024 had even ended.
</p>
<p>
OpenAI have one day left in their
<a href="https://openai.com/12-days/">12 Days of OpenAI</a> event.
Previous highlights have included the full <strong>o1</strong> model (an
upgrade from o1-preview) and <strong>o1-pro</strong>,
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/9/sora/">Sora</a> (later
upstaged a week later by Google‚Äôs
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/16/veo-2/">Veo 2</a>),
Canvas (with a confusing
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/10/chatgpt-canvas/">second
way to run Python</a>),
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/13/openai-voice-mode-faq/">Advanced
Voice with video streaming</a> and Santa and a <em>very</em> cool new
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/17/openai-webrtc/">WebRTC
streaming API</a>, ChatGPT Projects (pretty much a direct lift of the
similar Claude feature) and the 1-800-CHATGPT phone line.
</p>
<p>
Tomorrow is the last day. I‚Äôm not going to try to predict what they‚Äôll
launch, but I imagine it will be something notable to close out the
year.

<h2 id="building-effective-agents">Building effective agents</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-20, updated: 2024-12-20, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents">Building
effective agents</a></strong>
</p>
My principal complaint about the term ‚Äúagents‚Äù is that while it has many
different potential definitions most of the people who use it seem to
assume that everyone else shares and understands the definition that
they have chosen to use.
</p>
<p>
This outstanding piece by Erik Schluntz and Barry Zhang at Anthropic
bucks that trend from the start, providing a clear definition that they
then use throughout.
</p>
<p>
They discuss ‚Äúagentic systems‚Äù as a parent term, then define a
distinction between ‚Äúworkflows‚Äù - systems where multiple LLMs are
orchestrated together using pre-defined patterns - and ‚Äúagents‚Äù, where
the LLMs ‚Äúdynamically direct their own processes and tool usage‚Äù. This
second definition is later expanded with this delightfully clear
description:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Agents begin their work with either a command from, or interactive
discussion with, the human user. Once the task is clear, agents plan and
operate independently, potentially returning to the human for further
information or judgement. During execution, it‚Äôs crucial for the agents
to gain ‚Äúground truth‚Äù from the environment at each step (such as tool
call results or code execution) to assess its progress. Agents can then
pause for human feedback at checkpoints or when encountering blockers.
The task often terminates upon completion, but it‚Äôs also common to
include stopping conditions (such as a maximum number of iterations) to
maintain control.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
That‚Äôs a definition I can live with!
</p>
<p>
They also introduce a term that I <em>really</em> like: <strong>the
augmented LLM</strong>. This is an LLM with augmentations such as tools
- I‚Äôve seen people use the term ‚Äúagents‚Äù just for this, which never felt
right to me.
</p>
<p>
The rest of the article is the clearest practical guide to building
systems that combine multiple LLM calls that I‚Äôve seen anywhere.
</p>
<p>
Most of the focus is actually on workflows. They describe five different
patterns for workflows in detail:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Prompt chaining, e.g.¬†generating a document and then translating it to a
separate language as a second LLM call
</li>
<li>
Routing, where an initial LLM call decides which model or call should be
used next (sending easy tasks to Haiku and harder tasks to Sonnet, for
example)
</li>
<li>
Parallelization, where a task is broken up and run in parallel
(e.g.¬†image-to-text on multiple document pages at once) or processed by
some kind of voting mechanism
</li>
<li>
Orchestrator-workers, where a orchestrator triggers multiple LLM calls
that are then synthesized together, for example running searches against
multiple sources and combining the results
</li>
<li>
Evaluator-optimizer, where one model checks the work of another in a
loop
</li>
</ul>
<p>
These patterns all make sense to me, and giving them clear names makes
them easier to reason about.
</p>
<p>
When should you upgrade from basic prompting to workflows and then to
full agents? The authors provide this sensible warning:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
When building applications with LLMs, we recommend finding the simplest
solution possible, and only increasing complexity when needed. This
might mean not building agentic systems at all.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
But assuming you do need to go beyond what can be achieved even with the
aforementioned workflow patterns, their model for agents may be a useful
fit:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Agents can be used for open-ended problems where it‚Äôs difficult or
impossible to predict the required number of steps, and where you can‚Äôt
hardcode a fixed path. The LLM will potentially operate for many turns,
and you must have some level of trust in its decision-making. Agents‚Äô
autonomy makes them ideal for scaling tasks in trusted environments.
</p>
<p>
The autonomous nature of agents means higher costs, and the potential
for compounding errors. We recommend extensive testing in sandboxed
environments, along with the appropriate guardrails
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
They also warn against investing in complex agent frameworks before
you‚Äôve exhausted your options using direct API access and simple code.
</p>
<p>
<p>The article is accompanied by a brand new set of
<a href="https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook/tree/main/patterns/agents">cookbook
recipes</a> illustrating all five of the workflow patterns. The
<a href="https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook/blob/main/patterns/agents/evaluator_optimizer.ipynb">Evaluator-Optimizer
Workflow</a> example is particularly fun, setting up a code generating
prompt and an code reviewing evaluator prompt and having them loop until
the evaluator is happy with the result.</p>

Computer Networks by Analogy</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-20, from: Memo Garcia blog</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm writing this for the version of me back in university who struggled
to grasp networking concepts. This isn‚Äôt a full map of the networking
world, but it‚Äôs a starting point. If you‚Äôre also finding it tricky to
understand some of the ideas that make the internet works, I hope this
helps.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm sticking with analogies here instead of going deep into technical
terms‚Äîyou can find those easily anywhere. I just enjoy looking at the
world from different perspectives. It‚Äôs fascinating how many connections
you can spot when you approach things from a new angle.

<h2 id="gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-mode">Gemini 2.0 Flash ‚ÄúThinking
mode‚Äù</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-19, updated: 2024-12-19, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs
Weblog</p>
<p>
Those new model releases just keep on flowing. Today it‚Äôs Google‚Äôs
snappily named <code>gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp</code>, their first
entrant into the o1-style inference scaling class of models. I posted
about
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/19/is-ai-progress-slowing-down/">a
great essay about the significance of these</a> just this morning.
</p>
<p>
From <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/thinking-mode">the
Gemini model documentation</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Mode is an experimental model that‚Äôs trained
to generate the ‚Äúthinking process‚Äù the model goes through as part of its
response. As a result, Thinking Mode is capable of stronger reasoning
capabilities in its responses than the base Gemini 2.0 Flash model.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I just shipped
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-gemini/releases/tag/0.8">llm-gemini
0.8</a> with support for the model. You can try it out using
<a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a> like this:
</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell">
<pre>llm install -U llm-gemini
<span class="pl-c"><span class="pl-c">#</span> If you haven't yet set a gemini key:</span>
llm keys <span class="pl-c1">set</span> gemini
<span class="pl-c"><span class="pl-c">#</span> Paste key here</span>

llm -m gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp-1219 <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>solve a harder variant of that goat lettuce wolf river puzzle<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span></pre>
</div>
<p>
It‚Äôs <a href="">a very talkative model</a> - 2,277 output tokens
answering that prompt.
</p>
<h4 id="some-more-interesting-examples">
A more interesting example
</h4>
<p>
The best source of example prompts I‚Äôve found so far is the
<a href="https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/gemini-2/thinking.ipynb">Gemini
2.0 Flash Thinking cookbook</a> - a Jupyter notebook full of
demonstrations of what the model can do.
</p>
<p>
My favorite so far is this one:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<code>What‚Äôs the area of the overlapping region?</code>
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/geometry.png" alt="Geometric diagram showing a blue circle with radius 3 intersected by a green right triangle. The triangle has side lengths of 6 and the right angled corner of the triangle is positioned on the central point of the circle." style="max-width: 100%;" />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This model is multi-modal!
</p>
<p>
Here‚Äôs how to run that example using <code>llm-gemini</code>:
</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell">
<pre>llm -m gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp-1219 \
  -a https://storage.googleapis.com/generativeai-downloads/images/geometry.png \
  <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>What's the area of the overlapping region?<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span></pre>
</div>
<p>
Here‚Äôs
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/68a0552d882aaa5f51e462c93c614385">the
full response</a>, complete with MathML working. The eventual
conclusion:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The final answer is 9œÄ/4
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
That‚Äôs the same answer as Google provided in their example notebook, so
I‚Äôm presuming it‚Äôs correct. Impressive!
</p>
<p>
How about an SVG of
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/pelican-riding-a-bicycle/">a
pelican riding a bicycle</a>?
</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell">
<pre>llm -m gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp-1219 \
  <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span></pre>
</div>
<p>
Here‚Äôs
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/5e9046165dd11a551ccd30907d571985">the
full response</a>. Interestingly it slightly corrupted the start of its
answer:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<code>This thought process involves a combination of visual thinking,
knowledge of SVG syntax, and iterative refinement. The key is to break
down the problem into manageable parts and build up the image piece by
piece. Even experienced SVG creators often go through several
adjustments before arriving at the final version.00‚Äù height=‚Äú250‚Äù
viewBox=‚Äú0 0 300 250‚Äù fill=‚Äúnone‚Äù
xmlns=‚Äúhttp://www.w3.org/2000/svg‚Äù&gt;</code><br /> <code>
&lt;g&gt;</code><br /> <code> &lt;!‚Äì Bicycle Frame ‚Äì&gt;</code>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
After I manually repaired that to add the <code>&lt;svg</code> opening
tag I got this:
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/thinking-pelican.jpg" alt="The bicycle has two wheels but looks more like a pram. The pelican has a good orange beak but its wings are triangles that are oddly positioned." style="max-width: 100%;" />
</p>
<p>
So maybe not an artistic genius, but it‚Äôs interesting to read through
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/5e9046165dd11a551ccd30907d571985#response">its
chain of thought</a> for that task.
</p>
<h4 id="whos-next">
Who‚Äôs next?
</h4>
<p>
It‚Äôs very clear now that inference scaling is the next big area of
research for the large labs. We‚Äôve seen models from OpenAI
(<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Sep/12/openai-o1/">o1</a>),
Qwen (<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Nov/27/qwq/">QwQ</a>),
DeepSeek
(<a href="https://api-docs.deepseek.com/news/news1120">DeepSeek-R1-Lite-Preview</a>)
and now Google Gemini. I‚Äôm interested to hear if Anthropic or Meta or
Mistral or Amazon have anything cooking in this category.

clogged with dust, and like most moving parts, an sometimes break down.
Fanless PCs have been around for years, but they usually come with

This piece by Arvind Narayanan, Sayash Kapoor and Benedikt Str√∂bl is the

It‚Äôs long and worth reading every inch of it - it defies summarization,

The key question they address is the widely discussed issue of whether
model scaling has stopped working. Last year it seemed like the secret
to ever increasing model capabilities was to keep dumping in more data
and parameters and training time, but the lack of a convincing leap
forward in the two years since GPT-4 - from any of the big labs -
suggests that‚Äôs no longer the case.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The new dominant narrative seems to be that model scaling is dead, and
‚Äúinference scaling‚Äù, also known as ‚Äútest-time compute scaling‚Äù is the
way forward for improving AI capabilities. The idea is to spend more and
more computation when using models to perform a task, such as by having
them ‚Äúthink‚Äù before responding.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Inference scaling is the trick introduced by OpenAI‚Äôs o1 and now
explored by other models such as Qwen‚Äôs
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Nov/27/qwq/">QwQ</a>. It‚Äôs an
increasingly practical approach as inference gets more efficient and
cost per token continues to
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/llm-pricing/">drop through the
floor</a>.
</p>
<p>
But how far can inference scaling take us, especially if it‚Äôs only
effective for certain types of problem?
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The straightforward, intuitive answer to the first question is that
inference scaling is useful for problems that have clear correct
answers, such as coding or mathematical problem solving. [‚Ä¶] In
contrast, for tasks such as writing or language translation, it is hard
to see how inference scaling can make a big difference, especially if
the limitations are due to the training data. For example, if a model
works poorly in translating to a low-resource language because it isn‚Äôt
aware of idiomatic phrases in that language, the model can‚Äôt reason its
way out of this.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
There‚Äôs a delightfully spicy section about why it‚Äôs a bad idea to defer
to the expertise of industry insiders:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
In short, the reasons why one might give more weight to insiders‚Äô views
aren‚Äôt very important. On the other hand, there‚Äôs a huge and obvious
reason why we should probably give less weight to their views, which is
that they have an incentive to say things that are in their commercial
interests, and have a track record of doing so.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I also enjoyed this note about how we are still potentially years behind
in figuring out how to build usable applications that take full
advantage of the capabilities we have today:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The furious debate about whether there is a capability slowdown is
ironic, because the link between capability increases and the real-world
usefulness of AI is extremely weak. The development of AI-based
<a href="https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2024/4/19/looking-for-ai-use-cases">applications</a>
lags far behind the increase of AI capabilities, so even existing AI
capabilities remain greatly underutilized. One reason is the
<a href="https://www.aisnakeoil.com/i/147899150/reliability">capability-reliability
gap</a> ‚Äî even when a certain capability exists, it may not work
reliably enough that you can take the human out of the loop and actually
automate the task (imagine a food delivery app that only works 80% of
the time). And the methods for improving reliability are often
application-dependent and distinct from methods for improving
capability. That said, reasoning models also seem to exhibit
<a href="https://youtu.be/iBfQTnA2n2s?si=a-760cPz5ZghJc7w&amp;t=161">reliability
improvements</a>, which is exciting.

<p>date: 2024-12-19, updated: 2024-12-19, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs
Weblog</p>

<strong><a href="https://github.com/davidgasquez/dotfiles/blob/bb9df4a369dbaef95ca0c35642de491c7dd41269/shell/zshrc#L50-L99">q
and qv zsh functions for asking questions of websites and YouTube videos

</p>
Spotted these in David Gasquez‚Äôs <code>zshrc</code> dotfiles: two shell
functions that use my <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a> tool
to answer questions about a website or YouTube video.
</p>
<p>
Here‚Äôs how to ask a question of a website:
</p>
<pre><code>q https://simonwillison.net/ 'What has Simon written about recently?'
</code></pre>
<p>
I got back:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Recently, Simon Willison has written about various topics including:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Building Python Tools</strong> - Exploring one-shot applications
using Claude and dependency management with <code>uv</code>.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Modern Java Usage</strong> - Discussing recent developments in
Java that simplify coding.
</li>
<li>
<strong>GitHub Copilot Updates</strong> - New free tier and features in
GitHub Copilot for Vue and VS Code.
</li>
<li>
<strong>AI Engagement on Bluesky</strong> - Investigating the use of
bots to create artificially polite disagreements.
</li>
<li>
<strong>OpenAI WebRTC Audio</strong> - Demonstrating a new API for
real-time audio conversation with models.
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>
It works by constructing a
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/16/jina-ai-reader/">Jina
Reader URL</a> to convert that URL to Markdown, then piping that content
into LLM along with the question.
</p>
<p>
The YouTube one is even more fun:
</p>
<pre><code>qv 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRuLgar5XZw' 'what does Simon say about open source?'
</code></pre>
<p>
It said (about
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRuLgar5XZw">this 72 minute
video</a>):
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Simon emphasizes that open source has significantly increased
productivity in software development. He points out that before open
source, developers often had to recreate existing solutions or purchase
proprietary software, which often limited customization. The
availability of open source projects has made it easier to find and
utilize existing code, which he believes is one of the primary reasons
for more efficient software development today.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The secret sauce behind that one is the way it uses <code>yt-dlp</code>
to extract just the subtitles for the video:
</p>
<pre><code>local subtitle_url=$(yt-dlp -q --skip-download --convert-subs srt --write-sub --sub-langs "en" --write-auto-sub --print "requested_subtitles.en.url" "$url")
local content=$(curl -s "$subtitle_url" | sed '/^$/d' | grep -v '^[0-9]*$' | grep -v '\--&gt;' | sed 's/&lt;[^&gt;]*&gt;//g' | tr '\n' ' ')
</code></pre>
<p>
<p>That first line retrieves a URL to the subtitles in WEBVTT format - I
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/7f07837cf8adcee23fd5cd5394170f27">saved
a copy of that here</a>. The second line then uses <code>curl</code> to
fetch them, then <code>sed</code> and <code>grep</code> to remove the
timestamp information, producing

Python tools with a one-shot prompt using uv run and Claude
Projects</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-19, updated: 2024-12-19, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs
Weblog</p>
<p>
I‚Äôve written a lot about how I‚Äôve been using Claude to build one-shot
HTML+JavaScript applications
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/claude-artifacts/">via Claude
Artifacts</a>. I recently started using a similar pattern to create
one-shot Python utilities, using a custom Claude Project combined with
the dependency management capabilities of
<a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv">uv</a>.
</p>
<p>
(In LLM jargon a ‚Äúone-shot‚Äù prompt is a prompt that produces the
complete desired result on the first attempt.)
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôll start with an example of a tool I built that way.
</p>
<p>
I had another round of battle with Amazon S3 today trying to figure out
why a file in one of my buckets couldn‚Äôt be accessed via a public URL.
</p>
<p>
Out of frustration I prompted Claude with a variant of the following
(<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/9f69cf35889b0445b80eeed691d44504">full
transcript here</a>):
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<code>I can‚Äôt access the file at EXAMPLE_S3_URL. Write me a Python CLI
tool using Click and boto3 which takes a URL of that form and then uses
EVERY single boto3 trick in the book to try and debug why the file is
returning a 404</code>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It wrote me
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/main/python/debug_s3_access.py">this
script</a>, which gave me exactly what I needed. I ran it like this:
</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell">
<pre>uv run debug_s3_access.py \
  https://test-public-bucket-simonw.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/0f550b7b28264d7ea2b3d360e3381a95.jpg</pre>
</div>
<p>
<img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/debug-s3.jpg" alt="Terminal screenshot showing S3 access analysis results. Command: '$ uv run http://tools.simonwillison.net/python/debug_s3_access.py url-to-image' followed by detailed output showing bucket exists (Yes), region (default), key exists (Yes), bucket policy (AllowAllGetObject), bucket owner (swillison), versioning (Not enabled), content type (image/jpeg), size (71683 bytes), last modified (2024-12-19 03:43:30+00:00) and public access settings (all False)" style="max-width: 100%;" />
</p>
<p>
You can
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/tree/main/python#debug_s3_accesspy">see
the text output here</a>.
</p>
<h4 id="inline-dependencies-and-uv-run">
Inline dependencies and uv run
</h4>
<p>
Crucially, I didn‚Äôt have to take any extra steps to install any of the
dependencies that the script needed. That‚Äôs because the script starts
with this magic comment:
</p>
<pre><span class="pl-c"># /// script</span>
<span class="pl-c"># requires-python = "&gt;=3.12"</span>
<span class="pl-c"># dependencies = [</span>
<span class="pl-c">#     "click",</span>
<span class="pl-c">#     "boto3",</span>
<span class="pl-c">#     "urllib3",</span>
<span class="pl-c">#     "rich",</span>
<span class="pl-c"># ]</span>
<span class="pl-c"># ///</span></pre>
<p>
This is an example of
<a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/#declaring-script-dependencies">inline
script dependencies</a>, a feature described in
<a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0723/">PEP 723</a> and implemented
by <code>uv run</code>. Running the script causes <code>uv</code> to
create a temporary virtual environment with those dependencies
installed, a process that takes just a few milliseconds once the
<code>uv</code> cache has been populated.
</p>
<p>
This even works if the script is specified by a URL! Anyone with
<code>uv</code> installed can run the following command (provided you
trust me not to have replaced the script with something malicious) to
debug one of their own S3 buckets:
</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell">
<pre>uv run http://tools.simonwillison.net/python/debug_s3_access.py \
  https://test-public-bucket-simonw.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/0f550b7b28264d7ea2b3d360e3381a95.jpg</pre>

Writing these with the help of a Claude Project
</h4>
<p>
The reason I can one-shot scripts like this now is that I‚Äôve set up a
<a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/projects">Claude Project</a>
called ‚ÄúPython app‚Äù. Projects can have custom instructions, and I used
those to ‚Äúteach‚Äù Claude how to take advantage of inline script
dependencies:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
You write Python tools as single files. They always start with this
comment:
</p>
<pre><span># /// script</span>
<span># requires-python = "&gt;=3.12"</span>
<span># ///</span></pre>
<p>
These files can include dependencies on libraries such as Click. If they
do, those dependencies are included in a list like this one in that same
comment (here showing two dependencies):
</p>
<pre><span># /// script</span>
<span># requires-python = "&gt;=3.12"</span>
<span># dependencies = [</span>
<span>#     "click",</span>
<span>#     "sqlite-utils",</span>
<span># ]</span>
<span># ///</span></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
That‚Äôs everything Claude needs to reliably knock out full-featured
Python tools as single scripts which can be run directly using whatever
dependencies Claude chose to include.
</p>
<p>
I didn‚Äôt suggest that Claude use
<a href="https://github.com/Textualize/rich">rich</a> for the
<code>debug_s3_access.py</code> script earlier but it decided to use it
anyway!
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôve only recently started experimenting with this pattern but it seems
to work <em>really</em> well. Here‚Äôs another example - my prompt was:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<code>Starlette web app that provides an API where you pass in ?url= and
it strips all HTML tags and returns just the text, using
beautifulsoup</code>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Here‚Äôs
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/08957a1490ebde1ea38b4a8374989cf8">the
chat transcript</a> and
<a href="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/simonw/08957a1490ebde1ea38b4a8374989cf8/raw/143ee24dc65ca109b094b72e8b8c494369e763d6/strip_html.py">the
raw code it produced</a>. You can run that server directly on your
machine (it uses port 8000) like this:
</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell">
<pre>uv run https://gist.githubusercontent.com/simonw/08957a1490ebde1ea38b4a8374989cf8/raw/143ee24dc65ca109b094b72e8b8c494369e763d6/strip_html.py</pre>
</div>
<p>
Then visit
<code>http://127.0.0.1:8000/?url=https://simonwillison.net/</code> to
see it in action.
</p>
<h4 id="custom-instructions">
Custom instructions
</h4>
<p>
The pattern here that‚Äôs most interesting to me is using custom
instructions or system prompts to show LLMs how to implement new
patterns that may not exist in their training data. <code>uv run</code>
is less than a year old, but providing just a short example is enough to
get the models to write code that takes advantage of its capabilities.
</p>
<p>
I have a similar set of custom instructions I use for creating single
page HTML and JavaScript tools, again running in a Claude Project:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Never use React in artifacts - always plain HTML and vanilla JavaScript
and CSS with minimal dependencies.
</p>
<p>
CSS should be indented with two spaces and should start like this:
</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-text-html-basic">
<pre><span class="pl-kos">&lt;</span><span class="pl-ent">style</span><span class="pl-kos">&gt;</span>
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}</pre>
</div>
<p>
Inputs and textareas should be font size 16px. Font should always prefer
Helvetica.
</p>
<p>
JavaScript should be two space indents and start like this:
</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-text-html-basic">
<pre><span class="pl-kos">&lt;</span><span class="pl-ent">script</span> <span class="pl-c1">type</span>="<span class="pl-s">module</span>"<span class="pl-kos">&gt;</span>
// code in here should not be indented at the first level</pre>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>
Most of the tools on my
<a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/">tools.simonwillison.net</a>
site were created using versions of this custom instructions prompt.
</p>
<pre><code>    &lt;p&gt;Tags: &lt;a href=&quot;https://simonwillison.net/tags/aws&quot;&gt;aws&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://simonwillison.net/tags/python&quot;&gt;python&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://simonwillison.net/tags/s3&quot;&gt;s3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai&quot;&gt;ai&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://simonwillison.net/tags/prompt-engineering&quot;&gt;prompt-engineering&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://simonwillison.net/tags/generative-ai&quot;&gt;generative-ai&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://simonwillison.net/tags/llms&quot;&gt;llms&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-assisted-programming&quot;&gt;ai-assisted-programming&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://simonwillison.net/tags/claude&quot;&gt;claude&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://simonwillison.net/tags/claude-artifacts&quot;&gt;claude-artifacts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://simonwillison.net/tags/uv&quot;&gt;uv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; </code></pre>

<p>date: 2024-12-19, from: Peter Warden</p>
<p>I‚Äôve been using the ONNX Runtime a lot recently, and while it has
been a lot of fun, there are a few things I‚Äôve missed from the
TensorFlow Lite world. The biggest (no pun intended) is the lack of
tools to shrink the model file size, something that‚Äôs always been
essential in the mobile app [‚Ä¶]</p>

<p>How do you get up to speed with AI engineering? Unfortunately, I
don‚Äôt know of any good consolidated resources, so I‚Äôm going to attempt
to make one here. My first attempt at this focused more on what an AI
engineer is and made only a feeble attempt at providing resources to get
started. Let‚Äôs go!</p>
