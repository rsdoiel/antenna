The use of buy now, pay later services hit an all-time high this past
Cyber Monday. Consumers spent $940 million online using BNPL, which
they’ve continued coming back to as high inflation and credit card

carry. Plus, we hear about the latest rounds of layoffs at Spotify and
some of the hurdles to HIV-prevention medication uptake.

back in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/">Wordle</a>
groove, having done the last 42 puzzles without missing one. I think I
understand the game much better now. I do sometimes make mistakes, and
always pay for them. The thing that keeps me coming back is the feeling
when you press Return to see the result of your first guess. It’s like
opening a present, only better. If you get two green tiles, you can bask
in the glow of being extremely lucky. If you guess well you usually can
solve the puzzle in three or at most four moves. I’ve never gotten it in
two, and I don’t usually try, and when I do it’s usually a mistake, I
would have done better to stick with the plan of eliminating a bunch of
letters and confirming others, and then go for solution in the third
round. But the thing that keeps me coming back is the feeling of getting
a really good present, and that feeling of fortune and a bit of love,
self-love, when you see the answer, decide to go for it, and see five
green tiles open up
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbK1SM_Qomg">one at a time</a>.
That’s the feeling that keeps me coming back day after day.</p>

<h2 id="running-a-macbook-pro-with-debian">Running a MacBook Pro with
Debian</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-04, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
Running a MacBook Pro with Debian
</h1>
<p>
Two days ago my
<a href="2018-06-08_Librem_13_by_Purism_Mini_Review">Purism laptop</a>
stopped working: As soon as the boot process tried to access the SDD, it
would shut down.
</p>
<p>
I started wondering about bringing the old MacBook Pro back to life. We
had stopped using it after my wife bought a new Mac. This seemed like
the best solution at the time. She only wanted a system where there was
at least a chance of getting decent support from friends or shops,
i.e. Windows or macOS. And we didn’t want to continue using the MacBook
Pro because Apple had decided to no longer support those machines with
macOS updates.
</p>
<p>
I always felt bad about having a perfectly usable laptop sitting around
that I had used myself for so long before buying the Purism laptop. But
now that the Purism laptop was out of order and my wife had moved to a
new laptop, I started wondering about installing Debian on the MacBook
Pro.
</p>
<p>
<a class="account" href="https://weirder.earth/@j12i" title="@j12i@weirder.earth"><span
class="citation" data-cites="j12i">@j12i</span></a> suggested that I
might just try to plug the USB stick with the Debian installer into the
Mac since the chip architecture was compatible. I tried that, and it
worked!
</p>
<p>
Then
<a class="account" href="https://weirder.earth/@j12i" title="@j12i@weirder.earth"><span
class="citation" data-cites="j12i">@j12i</span></a> had an even strange
idea:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
If it physically fits, you could even try the drive from the librem in
the macbook. Should only need fixing up the bootloader, if at all.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
And so it was!
</p>
<p>
The SDD plugged into the MacBook Pro was mounted correctly by the rescue
system on the stick. I reinstalled GRUB on /dev/sda and after a reboot I
was running Debian on the MacBook Pro!
</p>
<p>
Everything seems a bit slow, but this is definitely workable. What a
great idea!
</p>
<p>
I installed <code>firmware-b43-installer</code> in order to get the
wireless card to run. The wireless card is a BCM4322 802.11a/b/g/n
Wireless LAN Controller (rev 01). Broadcom is such a sadface.
</p>
<p>
I decided that perhaps Gnome was slow and I should go and try sway
again. I installed <code>gpomme</code> for the Apple hotkeys (change
display brightness, change volume) but then I couldn’t get the trackpad
to invert the y-axis and I’m back to Gnome…
</p>
<p>
A bit later, I figured that perhaps the input source detection wasn’t
working so I mashed it all together, and now it works!
</p>
<pre><code>input * {
    dwt enabled
    tap enabled
    natural_scroll enabled
    middle_emulation disabled
    xkb_layout us
    xkb_variant altgr-intl
    xkb_options compose:caps
}
</code></pre>
<p>
It’s still looking good. The camera seems to be working, too.
</p>

</p>
<p>
<strong>2023-12-03</strong> Fixed the Purism laptop issue, switched the
drives back, and things still work. So for the moment the MacBook Pro is
back on the shelf. It’s just nice to know that I have a working backup
laptop should the need arise.
</p>
<p>
And I noticed a few things, too:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
I like how the keyboard just works
</li>
<li>
I have a problem with the bottom left corner arrangement of fn ctrl alt
gui aka. Function Control Option and Command
</li>
<li>
I like that the laptop has an ethernet plug
</li>
<li>
I like that the laptop has a CD/DVD reader
</li>
</ul>

Francis Spufford’s “Cahokia Jazz” (04 Dec 2023)</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-04, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links Francis Spufford’s “Cahokia Jazz”: A stunning alternate
history that fires on every cylinder. Hey look at this: Delights to
delectate. This day in history: 2003, 2008, 2013, 2018, 2022 Colophon:
Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing
projects, current reading Francis Spufford’s “Cahokia Jazz” (permalink)
Francis Spufford’s Cahokia Jazz is a fucking banger: it’s a taut,
unguessable whuddunit, painted in ultrablack noir, set in an alternate
Jazz Age in a world where indigenous people never ceded most the west to
the USA. It’s got gorgeously described jazz music, a richly realized
modern indigenous society, and a spectacular romance. It’s amazing:
https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Cahokia-Jazz/Francis-Spufford/9781668025451
Cahokia is the capital city of Deseret, a majority Catholic, majority
indigenous state at the western frontier of the USA. It swirls with
industry, wealth, and racial politics, serving as both a refuge from Jim
Crow and a hive of Klan activity. Joe Barrow is new in town, a veteran
who survived the trenches of WWI and moved to Cahokia with his army
buddy, Phineas Drummond, where they both quickly rose through the police
ranks to become detectives. We meet Joe and Phin on a frigid government
building rooftop in the predawn night, attending a grisly murder.
Someone has laid out a man across a skylight, cut his throat, split his
chest open, and excised his heart. This Aztec-inspired killing points at
Cahokian indigenous independence gangs, some of whom embrace an
apocryphal tale of being descended from Mesoamerican conquerors in the
distant past. That makes this more than a mere ugly killing – it’s a
political flashpoint. The Klan insists that Cahokia’s system of communal
land ownership is a form of communism (Russia never ceded Alaska in this
world, so the USSR is now extending tendrils across the Bering Strait).
They also insist that Cahokians’ reverence for the Sun and the Moon –
indigenous royals who have formally ceded power to elected leaders –
makes them a threat to democracy. Finally, the Cahokians’ fusion of
Catholocism with traditional faith makes the spritually suspect. A
rooftop blood-sacrifice could cause simmering political tension to boil
over, and for ever white oligarch drooling at the thought of enclosing
the shared land of Deseret, there are a thousand useful idiots in white
hoods. Joe and Phin now have to solve the murder – before the city
explodes. But Phin seems more interested in pinning the case on an
Indian – any Indian – than he is on solving the murder. And Joe – an
indigenous orphan who has neither the language nor the culture that the
Cahokians expect him to have – is reappraising his long habit of
deferring to Phin. This is the setup for a delicious whodunnit with a
large helping of what if…? but Spufford doesn’t stop there. Joe, you
see, is a jazz pianist, and his old bandmates are back in town, and one
thing leads to another and before you know it he’s sitting in with them
at a speakeasy. This gives Spufford a chance to roll out some of the
most evocative, delicious descriptions of jazz since Doctorow’s Ragtime
(no relation):
https://www.penguinrandomhouse.ca/books/41529/ragtime-by-e-l-doctorow/9780812978186
It’s not just the jazz. This is a book that fires on every cylinder:
there’s brilliant melee (and a major battle set-piece that’s stunning),
a love storyline, gunplay, and a murder mystery that kept me guessing
right to the end. There’s fakeouts and comeuppances, bravery and
treachery, and above all, a sense of possibility. Most of what I know
about Cahokia – and the giant mounds it left behind near St Louis – I
learned from David Graeber and David Wengrow’s brilliant work of
heterodox history, The Dawn of Everything:
https://pluralistic.net/2022/03/08/three-freedoms/#anti-fatalism Graeber
and Wengrow’s project is to make us reassess the blank spaces in our
historical record, the ways of living that we have merely guessed at,
based on fragments and suppositions. They point out that these
inferences are vastly overdetermined, and that there are many other
guesses that fit the facts equally well, or even better. This is a
powerful message, one that insists that history – and thus the future –
is contingent and up for grabs. We don’t have to live the way we do, and
we haven’t always lived this way. We might live differently in the
future. In evoking a teeming, indigenous metropolis, conjured out of
minor historical divergences, Spufford follows Graeber and Wengrow in
cracking apart inevitability and letting all the captive possibility
flow out. The fact that he does this in a first rate novel makes the
accomplishment doubly impressive – and enjoyable. Hey look at this

<li>Biden Administration Finalizes Strongest Federal Methane Regulations
Yet
</h3>
<p>
Speaking of methane, on Saturday
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/biden-epa-methane-rules" target="_self">the
Biden administration announced the finalization</a> of
long-in-the-making regulations that will rein in methane leaks from
existing and future oil and gas wells. The EPA says the rules will
prevent the equivalent of 1.5 billion tons of carbon dioxide from being
emitted between 2024 and 2038, almost as much as was emitted by all
power plants in the country in 2021. The total benefits created by the
new limits, the administration estimates, will reach $98 billion by
2038.
</p>
<p>
“The U.S. now has the most protective methane pollution limits on the
books,” said Fred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund,
which has played a major role in exposing the dangers of methane.

<li>COP28 President: Fossil Fuel Phase-Out Would ‘Take the World Back
into Caves’
</h3>
<p>
During an online event in late November, COP28 president Sultan Al Jaber
claimed there is “no science out there” to support phasing out fossil
fuels to mitigate global warming, <em>The Guardian</em> and the Center
for Climate Reporting
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/dec/03/back-into-caves-cop28-president-dismisses-phase-out-of-fossil-fuels?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other" target="_blank">jointly
reported</a> on Sunday. Al Jabar, who is also the chief executive of the
UAE’s state oil company Adnoc, further claimed in the conversation that
such a phase-out was “alarmist” and would “take the world back into
caves.”
</p>
<p>
The
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtZkouiLWVE&ab_channel=GuardianNews" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">leaked

was already under fire following
<a href="https://climate-reporting.org/cop28-president-oil-climate/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a
BBC report</a> that he planned to use the climate summit to promote oil
interests. (A spokesperson denied this). U.N. Secretary-General Antonio

the president’s newly revealed comments were “verging on climate

<li>Police Claim to Have Thwarted a ‘Mass Casualty Event’ at the

A 28-year-old Florida man was arrested last week after he allegedly
threatened to carry out a “mass casualty event” at Thursday’s Cybertruck
promotional event in Austin, the <em>Austin-American Statesman
</em><a href="https://www.statesman.com/story/news/crime/2023/11/30/police-florida-man-threatened-mass-casualty-event-at-tesla-in-austin/71759521007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>
this weekend.

Tesla was notified of the threat after a man, identified as Paul Ryan
Overeem of Orlando, said in an Instagram group chat that he was
“planning” an attack at the event “so up to you guys to stop me.” In
another message, Overeem allegedly said “I plan on killing people” and
“I would like you to do something about it so I don’t have to.” He was
arrested in Austin’s Travis County after driving there from Florida, and
has been charged with terroristic threat.

<li><strong>New Report Puts Airplane Contrail Mitigation Efforts in
Doubt </strong>
</h3>
<p style=""></li>
</ol>
Airplane contrails — those white, vaporous ribbons that follow jets
across the sky — have long drawn scrutiny from environmental activists,
who’ve pointed to them as a major source of warming, saying the creation
of high clouds could trap heat in the atmosphere à la the greenhouse gas
effect. Boeing and NASA have been conducting test flights to explore if
sustainable aviation fuel could help limit contrails, while Google and
Bill Gates-funded Breakthrough Energy climate action group have
experimented with rerouting planes through regions of the atmosphere
that are less likely to induce contrails.
</p>
<p style>
But a new report by David Lee, an influential researcher of aviation and
climate who previously looked at the issue in a 2021 paper, has found
that “the fundamental premise” that contrails are concerning enough to
warrant mitigation investment “is not yet established,”
<a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/nasa-and-boeing-chase-jet-contrails-with-science-of-climate-impact-in-doubt/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>The
Seattle Times</em> reports</a>. The science around contrails and the
climate is extremely complicated — that much is clear — but Lee writes
that it is so uncertain that efforts to limit contrails could actually
be “of limited effect” or even “have unintended consequences,” like
burning longer-lasting CO2 to reroute planes.
</p>
<p style>
Marc Shapiro of Breakthrough Energy, who is working to reduce contrails,
told the <em>Times</em>, “to be totally frank, our numbers are coming up
on the low end of David Lee’s [2021] estimates as well.”

Clinton says it’s time for insurance reform</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-04, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
As the global climate change summit COP28 continues, former Secretary of
State Hillary Clinton is calling for changes to how properties are
insured in the face of climate change. Insurers are already pulling out
in parts of California and Florida, but what exactly would reforms to
the industry look like? Then, Venezuela votes to claim part of oil-rich
Guyana, and self-driving cars face quite a number of roadblocks.

Flying Tourists over US National Parks Face New Rules</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Fewer planes and helicopters will be flying tourists over Mount
Rushmore and other national monuments and parks as new regulations take
effect that are intended to protect the serenity of some of the most
beloved natural areas in the United States.</p>
<p>The air tours have pitted tour operators against visitors frustrated
with the noise for decades, but it has come to a head as new management
plans are rolled out at nearly two dozen national parks and
monuments.</p>
<p>One of the strictest yet was recently announced at Mount Rushmore and
Badlands National Park, where tour flights will essentially be banned
from getting within a half mile of the South Dakota sites starting in
April.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what we’re going to be able to salvage,” complained
Mark Schlaefli, a co-owner of Black Hills Aerial Adventures who is
looking for alternative routes.</p>
<p>The regulations are the result of a federal appeals court finding
three years ago that the National Park Service and the Federal Aviation
Administration failed to enforce a 2000 law governing commercial air
tours over the parks and some tribal lands. A schedule was crafted for
setting rules, and many are wrapping up now.</p>
<p>But now an industry group is eying litigation, and an environmental
coalition already has sued over one plan. The issue has grown so
contentious that a congressional oversight hearing is planned for
Tuesday.</p>
<p>Critics argue that the whirr of chopper blades is drowning out the
sound of birds, bubbling lava and babbling brooks. That in turn disrupts
the experiences of visitors and the tribes who call the land around the
parks home.</p>
<p>“Is that fair?” asked Kristen Brengel of the National Parks
Conservation Association, noting that visitors on the ground far
outnumber those overhead. “I don’t think so.”</p>
<p>The air operators argue they provide unrivaled access, particularly
to the elderly and disabled.</p>
<p>“Absolutely exhilarating, a thrilling experience” is how Bailey Wood,
a spokesman for the Helicopter Association International, described
them.</p>
<p>Sightseeing flights got their start in the 1930s as crews building
the massive Hoover Dam asked the helicopter pilots working on the
project to give their families flyovers, Wood said.</p>
<p>“It took off from there,” he said, jokingly adding, “Sorry, aviation
pun.”</p>
<p>The issue hit a tipping point at the Grand Canyon in 1986 when two
tour aircraft collided over the national park in Arizona, killing 25
people. Congress acted the next year and a plan was enacted to designate
routes and minimum altitude for canyon flights.</p>
<p>Congress passed another round of legislation in 2000 with a goal of
setting rules in other national parks. But bureaucratic difficulties and
delays stalled compliance.</p>
<p>The Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility and the Hawaii
Island Coalition Malama Pono sued, demanding something be done.
Historically, some of the nation’s busiest spots for tour operators are
Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, which is home to one of the world’s most
active volcanoes, and Haleakala National Park.</p>
<p>In 2020, a federal court ordered compliance at 23 national parks,
including popular sites such as Glacier in Montana, Arches in Utah and
Great Smokey Mountains in Tennessee and North Carolina. That same year,
the latest in which data is available, there were 15,624 air tours
reported, which was down about 30% because of the pandemic, the park
service said.</p>
<p>As of this month, plans or voluntary agreements have been adopted for
most of the parks, although not all of them have taken effect. Work is
still underway on five, the park service said.</p>
<p>Parks exempted from developing plans include those with few flights
and those in Alaska, where small planes are often the only way to get
around.</p>
<p>“Mostly, the plans have been pretty generous to the industry,
allowing them to continue as they have done in the past with some
limited air tours around these parks,” said Peter Jenkins, senior
council for Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility.</p>
<p>His group went to court over a plan to allow a combined total of
about 2,500 flights over the Golden Gate National Recreation Area and
other nearby parks, alleging an inadequate environmental study.</p>
<p>Then came last month’s announcement about restrictions over Mount
Rushmore and the Badlands.</p>
<p>“This isn’t a management plan,” complained Ray Jilek, owner of Eagle
Aviation Inc. and its chief pilot. “This is a cease and desist plan, as
far as I’m concerned.”</p>
<p>Andrew Busse of Black Hills Helicopter Inc. said his tours already
don’t fly directly over Mount Rushmore. The park is relatively small, so
the monument to the nation’s presidents is still visible from outside
its boundaries, he said. </p>
<p>The plans are aimed at taking tribal desires into account. But Shawn
Bordeaux, a Democratic state lawmaker in South Dakota and a member of
the Rosebud Sioux tribe, said he hasn’t heard complaints.</p>
<p>“We don’t want them flying around trying to watch our sun dances or
ceremonies or something,” he said. “But as for tourism, I don’t see why
it’s an issue.” </p>
<p>A similarly strict plan has been proposed for Bandelier National
Monument in New Mexico. Bruce Adams, owner of Southwest Safaris, flies a
fixed-wing plane with tourists a couple times a week over the area known
for the dwellings carved into the soft rock cliffs.</p>
<p>“Changing the route is going to force me to fly over Pueblo tribal
lands that I have assiduously avoided doing for 49 years because I know
it’s going to cause noise problems,” he said.</p>
<p>Glacier National Park, meanwhile, is phasing out the flights by the
end of 2029. </p>
<p>Wood said the process has been “broken and rushed” and threatens to
put some operators out of business.</p>
<p>“Litigation is one tool that is definitely under consideration,” he
said.</p>
<p>But Brengel of the National Parks Conservation Association said the
resistance doesn’t have much traction. An amendment to the FAA
reauthorization bill that would have required the agency to factor in
the economics of commercial air tours over national parks failed in
July, she said.</p>
<p>“People go to Arches, people go to Hawaii to hear the sights and
sounds of these places,” Brengel said. “It’s so utterly clear that the
vast majority of people who are going to these parks aren’t going to
hear the sounds of helicopters over their heads.”</p>

I trusted a lot today. I trusted my phone to wake me on time. I trusted
Uber to arrange a taxi for me, and the driver to get me to the airport
safely. I trusted thousands of other drivers on the road not to ram my
car on the way. At the airport, I trusted ticket agents and maintenance
engineers and everyone else who keeps airlines operating. And the pilot
of the plane I flew in. And thousands of other people at the airport and
on the plane, any of which could have attacked me. And all the people
that prepared and served my breakfast, and the entire food supply
chain—any of them could have poisoned me. When I landed here, I trusted
thousands more people: at the airport, on the road, in this building, in
this room. And that was all before 10:30 this morning…

Air Force: Divers Find Wreckage, Remains from Osprey Aircraft That
Crashed off Japan</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. and Japanese divers have discovered wreckage and remains of crew
members from a U.S. Air Force Osprey aircraft that crashed last week off
southwestern Japan, the Air Force announced Monday.</p>
<p>The CV-22 Osprey carrying eight American personnel crashed last
Wednesday off Yakushima Island during a training mission. The body of
one victim was recovered and identified earlier, while seven others
remained missing.</p>
<p>The Air Force Special Operations Command said the remains were being
recovered and their identities have yet to be determined.</p>
<p>“The main priority is bringing the Airmen home and taking care of
their family members. Support to, and the privacy of, the families and
loved ones impacted by this incident remains AFSOC’s top priority,” it
said in a statement.</p>
<p>The U.S. military identified the one confirmed victim as Air Force
Staff Sgt. Jacob Galliher of Pittsfield, Massachusetts, on Saturday.</p>
<p>On Monday, divers from the Japanese navy and U.S. military spotted
what appeared to be the front section of the Osprey, along with possibly
five of the missing crew members, Japan’s NHK public television and
other media reported. Japanese navy officials declined to confirm the
reports, saying they could not release details without consent from the
U.S.</p>
<p>The U.S.-made Osprey is a hybrid aircraft that takes off and lands
like a helicopter but can rotate its propellers forward and cruise much
faster, like an airplane, during flight.</p>
<p>Ospreys have had several crashes, including in Japan, where they are
used at U.S. and Japanese military bases, and the latest accident
rekindled safety concerns.</p>
<p>Japan has suspended all flights of its own fleet of 14 Ospreys.
Japanese officials say they have asked the U.S. military to resume
Osprey flights only after ensuring their safety. The Pentagon said no
such formal request has been made and that the U.S. military is
continuing to fly 24 MV-22s, the Marine version of Ospreys, deployed on
the southern Japanese island of Okinawa.</p>
<p>On Sunday, pieces of wreckage that Japan’s coast guard and local
fishing boats have collected were handed over to the U.S. military for
examination, coast guard officials said. Japan’s military said debris it
has collected would also be handed over to the U.S.</p>
<p>Coast guard officials said the recovered pieces of wreckage include
parts of the aircraft and an inflatable life raft but nothing related to
the cause of the crash, such as an engine. Local witnesses reported
seeing fire coming from one of the engines.</p>
<p>Under the Japan-U.S. Status of Forces Agreement, Japanese authorities
are not given the right to seize or investigate U.S. military property
unless the U.S. decides otherwise. That means it will be practically
impossible for Japan to independently investigate the cause of the
accident.</p>
<p>The agreement has often made Japanese investigations difficult in
criminal cases involving American service members on Okinawa and
elsewhere, and has been criticized as unequal by rights activists and
others, including Okinawa Gov. Denny Tamaki, who has called for a
revision.</p>

From the BBC World Service: In its third round of job layoffs this year,
Swedish music-streaming giant Spotify says it’s cutting 1,500 jobs, or
17% of its workforce. Plus, we look at why the president of COP28 is in
hot water over his comments on the science of reducing global heating.
And in the United Kingdom, there’s a black market for so-called “skinny

id="lacking-counselors-us-schools-turn-to-booming-business-of-online-therapy">Lacking
Counselors, US Schools Turn to Booming Business of Online Therapy</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Trouble with playground bullies started for Maria Ishoo’s daughter in
elementary school. Girls ganged up, calling her “fat” and “ugly.” Boys
tripped and pushed her. The California mother watched her typically
bubbly second-grader retreat into her bedroom and spend afternoons
curled up in bed.</p>
<p>For Valerie Aguirre’s daughter in Hawaii, a spate of middle school
“friend drama” escalated into violence and online bullying that left the
12-year-old feeling disconnected and lonely.</p>
<p>Both children received help through telehealth therapy, a service
that schools around the country are offering in response to soaring
mental health struggles among American youth.</p>
<p>Now at least 16 of the 20 largest U.S. public school districts are
offering online therapy sessions to reach millions of students,
according to an analysis by The Associated Press. In those districts
alone, schools have signed provider contracts worth more than $70
million.</p>
<p>The growth reflects a booming new business born from America’s youth
mental health crisis, which has proven so lucrative that venture
capitalists are funding a new crop of school teletherapy companies. Some
experts raise concerns about the quality of care offered by fast-growing
tech companies.</p>
<p>As schools cope with shortages of in-person practitioners, however,
educators say teletherapy works for many kids, and it’s meeting a
massive need. For rural schools and lower-income students in particular,
it has made therapy easier to access. Schools let students connect with
online counselors during the school day or after hours from home.</p>
<p>“This is how we can prevent people from falling through the cracks,”
said Ishoo, a mother of two in Lancaster, California.</p>
<p>Ishoo recalls standing at her second-grader’s bedroom door last year
and wishing she could get through to her. “What’s wrong?” the mother
would ask. The response made her heart heavy: “It’s NOTHING, Mom.”</p>
<p>Last spring, her school district launched a teletherapy program and
she signed up her daughter. During a month of weekly sessions, the girl
logged in from her bedroom and opened up to a therapist who gave her
coping tools and breathing techniques to reduce anxiety. The therapist
told her daughter: You are in charge of your own emotions. Don’t give
anyone else that control.</p>
<p>“She learned that it’s OK to ask for help, and sometimes everyone
needs some extra help,” Ishoo said.</p>
<p>The 13,000-student school system, like so many others, has counselors
and psychologists on staff, but not enough to meet the need, said Trish
Wilson, the Lancaster district’s coordinator of counselors.</p>
<p>Therapists in the area have full caseloads, making it impossible to
refer students for immediate care, she said. But students can schedule a
virtual session within days.</p>
<p>“Our preference is to provide our students in-person therapy.
Obviously, that’s not always possible,” said Wilson, whose district has
referred more than 325 students to over 800 sessions since launching the
online therapy program.</p>
<p>Students and their parents said in interviews they turned to
teletherapy after struggling with feelings of sadness, loneliness,
academic stress and anxiety. For many, the transition back to in-person
school after distance learning was traumatic. Friendships had fractured,
social skills deteriorated and tempers flared more easily.</p>
<p>Schools are footing the bill, many of them using federal pandemic
relief money as experts have warned of alarming rates of youth
depression, anxiety and suicide. Many school districts are signing
contracts with private companies. Others are working with local health
care providers, nonprofits or state programs.</p>
<p>Mental health experts welcome the extra support but caution about
potential pitfalls. For one, it’s getting harder to hire school
counselors and psychologists, and competition with telehealth providers
isn’t helping.</p>
<p>“We have 44 counselor vacancies, and telehealth definitely impacts
our ability to fill them,” said Doreen Hogans, supervisor of school
counseling in Prince George’s County, Maryland. Hogans estimates 20% of
school counselors who left have taken teletherapy jobs, which offer more
flexible hours.</p>
<p>The rapid growth of the companies raises questions about the
qualifications of the therapists, their experience with children and
privacy protocols, said Kevin Dahill-Fuchel, executive director of
Counseling in Schools, a nonprofit that helps schools bolster
traditional, in-person mental health services.</p>
<p>“As we give these young people access to telehealth, I want to hear
how all these other bases are covered,” he said.</p>
<p>One of the biggest providers, San Francisco-based Hazel Health,
started with telemedicine health services in schools in 2016 and
expanded to mental health in May 2021, CEO Josh Golomb said. It now
employs more than 300 clinicians providing teletherapy in over 150
school districts in 15 states.</p>
<p>The rapid expansions mean millions of dollars in revenue for Hazel.
This year, the company signed a $24 million contract with Los Angeles
County to offer teletherapy services to 1.3 million students for two
years.</p>
<p>Other clients include Hawaii, which is paying Hazel nearly $4 million
over three years to work with its public schools, and Clark County
schools in the Las Vegas area, which have allocated $3.25 million for
Hazel-provided teletherapy. The districts of Miami-Dade, Prince George’s
and Houston schools also have partnered with Hazel.</p>
<p>Despite the giant contracts, Golomb said Hazel is focused on ensuring
child welfare outweighs the bottom line.</p>
<p>“We have the ethos of a nonprofit company but we’re using a
private-sector mechanism to reach as many kids as we can,” Golomb said.
Hazel raised $51.5 million in venture capital funding in 2022 that
fueled its expansion. “Do we have any concerns about any compromise in
quality? The resounding answer is no.”</p>
<p>Other providers are getting into the space. In November, New York
City launched a free telehealth therapy service for teens to help
eliminate barriers to access, said Ashwin Vasan, the city’s health
commissioner. New York is paying the startup TalkSpace $26 million over
three years for a service allowing teens aged 13 to 17 to download an
app and connect with licensed therapists by phone, video or text.</p>
<p>Unlike other cities, New York is offering the service to all teens,
whether enrolled in private, public or home schools, or not in school at
all.</p>
<p>“I truly hope this normalizes and democratizes access to mental
health care for our young people,” Vasan said.</p>
<p>Many of Hawaii’s referrals come from schools in rural or remote
areas. Student clients have increased sharply in Maui since the deadly
August wildfires, said Fern Yoshida, who oversees teletherapy for the
state education department. So far this fall, students have logged 2,047
teletherapy visits, a three-fold increase from the same period last
year.</p>
<p>One of them was Valerie Aguirre’s daughter, whose fallout with two
friends turned physical last year in sixth grade, when one of the girls
slapped her daughter in the face. Aguirre suggested her daughter try
teletherapy. After two months of online therapy, “she felt better,”
Aguirre said, with a realization that everyone makes mistakes and
friendships can be mended.</p>
<p>In California, Ishoo says her daughter, now in third grade, is
relaying wisdom to her sister, who started kindergarten this year.</p>
<p>“She walks her little sister to class and tells her everything will
be OK. She’s a different person. She’s older and wiser. She reassures
her sister,” Ishoo said. “I heard her say, ‘If kids are being mean to
you, just ignore them.’”</p>

<h2
id="despite-ukraine-war-needs-arms-sales-troubled-by-production-woes">Despite
Ukraine War Needs, Arms Sales Troubled by Production Woes</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Many Western arms companies failed to ramp up production in 2022
despite a strong increase in demand for weapons and military equipment,
a watchdog group said Monday, adding that labor shortages, soaring costs
and supply chain disruptions had been exacerbated by Russia’s invasion
of Ukraine.</p>
<p>In its Top 100 of such firms, the Stockholm International Peace
Research Institute, or SIPRI, said the arms revenue of the world’s
largest arms-producing and military services companies last year stood
at $597 billion — a 3.5% drop from 2021.</p>
<p>“Many arms companies faced obstacles in adjusting to production for
high-intensity warfare,” said Lucie Beraud-Sudreau, director of the
independent institute’s Military Expenditure and Arms Production
Program.</p>
<p>SIPRI said the revenues of the 42 U.S. companies on the list —
accounting for 51% of total arms sales — fell by 7.9% to $302 billion in
2022. Of those, 32 recorded a fall in year-on-year arms revenue, most of
them citing ongoing supply chain issues and labor shortages stemming
from the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Nan Tian, a senior researcher with SIPRI, said that “we are beginning
to see an influx of new orders linked to the war in Ukraine.”</p>
<p>He cited some major U.S. companies, including Lockheed Martin and
Raytheon Technologies, and said that because of “existing order backlogs
and difficulties in ramping up production capacity, the revenue from
these orders will probably only be reflected in company accounts in two
to three years’ time.”</p>
<p>Companies in Asia and the Middle East saw their arms revenues grow
significantly in 2022, the institute said in its assessment, saying it
demonstrated “their ability to respond to increased demand within a
shorter time frame.” SIPRI singled out Israel and South Korea.</p>
<p>“However, despite the year-on-year drop, the total Top 100 arms
revenue was still 14% higher in 2022 than in 2015 — the first year for
which SIPRI included Chinese companies in its ranking.</p>
<p>SIPRI also said that countries placed new orders late in the year and
the time lag between orders and production meant that the surge in
demand was not reflected in these companies’ 2022 revenues.</p>
<p>“However, new contracts were signed, notably for ammunition, which
could be expected to translate into higher revenue in 2023 and beyond,”
Beraud-Sudreau said.</p>

id="queen-latifah-billy-crystal-dionne-warwick-among-2023-kennedy-center-honorees">Queen
Latifah, Billy Crystal, Dionne Warwick Among 2023 Kennedy Center
Honorees</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The newest group of Kennedy Center honorees, including comedian Billy
Crystal and actor Queen Latifah, are being feted Sunday night at a
star-studded event marking their lifetime achievement in arts and
entertainment.</p>
<p>Opera singer Renee Fleming, music star Barry Gibb and prolific
hitmaker Dionne Warwick also are being honored at the black-tie gala.
Each will receive personalized tributes that typically include
appearances and performances that are kept secret from the honorees
themselves.</p>
<p>In announcing the recipients earlier this year, the Kennedy Center’s
president, Deborah F. Rutter, called this year’s group of inductees “an
extraordinary mix of individuals who have redefined their art
forms.”</p>
<p>Crystal, 75, came to national prominence in the 1970s playing Jodie
Dallas, one of the first openly gay characters on American network
television, on the sitcom “Soap.” He went on to a brief but memorable
one-year stint on “Saturday Night Live” before starring in a string of
movies, including hits such as “When Harry Met Sally…” “The Princess
Bride” and “City Slickers.”</p>
<p>Crystal, who also received the Kennedy Center’s Mark Twain Prize for
lifetime achievement in comedy in 2007, joins an elite group of
comedians cited for both: David Letterman, Steve Martin, Lorne Michaels,
Lily Tomlin, Carol Burnett and Neil Simon. Bill Cosby received both
honors, but they were rescinded in 2018 following his sexual assault
conviction, which later was overturned.</p>
<p>Warwick, 82, shot to stardom in the 1960s as the muse for the
superstar songwriting team of Burt Bacharach and Hal David. Her
discography includes a multidecade string of hits, both with and without
Bacharach, that includes “I Say a Little Prayer,” “I’ll Never Love This
Way Again” and “That’s What Friends Are For.”</p>
<p>Fleming, 64, is one of the leading sopranos of her era, with a string
of accolades that includes a National Medal of Arts bestowed by
President Barack Obama, a Cross of the Order of Merit from the German
government and honorary membership in England’s Royal Academy of
Music.</p>
<p>Gibb, 76, achieved global fame as part of one of the most successful
bands in the history of modern music, the Bee Gees. Along with his late
brothers Robin and Maurice, the trio launched a nearly unmatched string
of hits that defined a generation of music.</p>
<p>Latifah, 53, has been a star since age 19 when her debut album and
hit single “Ladies First” made her the first female crossover rap star.
She has gone on to a diverse career that has included seven studio
albums, starring roles in multiple television shows and movies and an
Oscar nomination for best supporting actress for her role in the movie
musical “Chicago.”</p>
<p>Fleming and Latifah, real name Dana Owens, also share an obscure bit
of Kennedy Center Honors historical trivia. They both performed at the
2014 Super Bowl. Fleming sang the national anthem while Latifah
performed “America the Beautiful.”</p>

brand new BeOS, Mac OS X, and MS-DOS T-shirts in the OSNews Merch
Store!</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>The holidays are coming, there’s a chill in the air (literally for
me, I live in the Arctic), so it’s time for a few new additions to the
official OSNews Merch Store. Do you live in the terminal, breathe the
terminal? We’ve got new shirts just for you. The opening message of the
terminals of Mac OS X, BeOS, and MS-DOS (let’s be generous and call
MS-DOS a terminal), with a command to call an osnews directory on the
file system, printed on the front of the shirt. They sport the correct
fonts, background colours, and exact verbiage used in the operating
systems themselves. For the Mac OS X one, I had to choose a last login
date and a username, so I opted for the exact time and date of birth of
my oldest son, and a username that’s a bit of an Easter egg. These
shirts of the organic cotton variety, and all proceeds go to supporting
OSNews’ continued existence so we don’t have to resort to SEO crap,
“AI”-generated garbage, and malvertising. Every item sold on the store
generates around $10 for us, with the rest going to our partner Bonfire
for producing the items and running the store. You can also support
OSNews through individual donations on Ko-Fi, by becoming a Patreon, and

<h2 id="finally-proper-attribution">Finally: proper attribution</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>You may have noticed that starting today, I’ve been adding a
dedicated link to the main story in every post on OSNews. Our
old-fashioned 2001 method of “biggest link is main story” simply doesn’t
hold up today as proper attribution, so from here on out every post will
have a link marked by ↫ crediting the name and/or publication of the
main linked article (or multiple where it makes sense). I’ve been
unhappy with our attribution for years, and finally got my act together
and settled on this solution. While I’ve had, in total, maybe no more
than 2-3 complaints about this since I started in 2006 – it’s taken too
long, and I apologise for that. Credit and attribution matter. For the
curious: ↫ is part of the arrows Unicode block as U+21AB, titled
“Leftwards arrow with loop”. I settled on it because the path of the
loop and the arrow evoked a feeling of being yoinked back somewhere
else, and that’s what a link does. Sure, I could’ve opted for a chain
link or whatever, but that’s boring.</p>

<p>I was always very interested in OpenBSD and a few months ago, I
decided to give it a try. I’ve quickly fallen in love with it! There is,
however, a big problem: Hare does not fully support OpenBSD! So, I
decided to port it and I am happy to announce that my work was merged
yesterday and OpenBSD is now fully supported by Hare. Let me show you
some of the tricky stuff that was involved in the port. ↫ Lorenz (xha)

id="beyoncés-renaissance-tops-box-office-with-21-million-debut">Beyoncé’s
‘Renaissance’ Tops Box Office With $21 Million Debut</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Beyoncé ruled the box office this weekend. Her concert picture,
“Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé,” opened in first place with $21 million
in North American ticket sales, according to estimates from AMC Theatres
Sunday.</p>
<p>The post-Thanksgiving, early December box office is notoriously slow,
but “Renaissance” defied the odds. Not accounting for inflation, it’s
the first time a film has opened over $20 million on this weekend in 20
years (since “The Last Samurai”).</p>
<p>Beyoncé wrote, directed and produced “Renaissance,” which is focused
on the tour for her Grammy-winning album. It debuted in 2,539 theaters
in the U.S. and Canada, as well as 94 international territories, where
it earned $6.4 million from 2,621 theaters.</p>
<p>“On behalf of AMC Theaters Distribution and the entire theatrical
industry, we thank Beyoncé for bringing this incredible film directly to
her fans,” said Elizabeth Frank, AMC Theaters executive vice president
of worldwide programming, in a statement. “To see it resonate with fans
and with film critics on a weekend that many in the industry typically
neglect is a testament to her immense talent, not just as a performer,
but as a producer and director.”</p>
<p>Despite several other new releases including “Godzilla Minus One,”
the Hindi-language “Animal,” Angel Studios’ sci-fi thriller “The Shift,”
and Lionsgate’s John Woo-directed revenge pic “Silent Night,” it was a
slow weekend overall. Films in the top 10 are expected to gross only $85
million in total. But it was in this traditional “lull” that AMC
Theaters found a good opportunity for “Renaissance” to shine.</p>
<p>“They chose a great weekend,” said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior
media analyst for Comscore. “There was competition, but it was from very
different kinds of movies.”</p>
<p>Though “Renaissance” did not come close to matching the $92.8 million
debut of “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour” in October, it’s still a very
good start for a concert film. No one expected “Renaissance” to match
“The Eras Tour,” which is wrapping up its theatrical run soon with over
$250 million globally. Prior to Swift, the biggest concert film debuts
(titles held by Miley Cyrus and Justin Bieber for their 2008 and 2011
films) had not surpassed the unadjusted sum of $32 million.</p>
<p>The 39-city, 56-show “Renaissance” tour, which kicked off in
Stockholm, Sweden in May and ended in Kansas City, Missouri in the fall,
made over $500 million and attracted over 2.7 million concertgoers.
Swift’s ongoing “Eras Tour,” with 151 dates, is expected to gross some
$1.4 billion.</p>
<p>Both Beyoncé and Swift chose to partner with AMC Theaters to
distribute their films, as opposed to a traditional studio. Both
superstars have been supportive of one another, making splashy
appearances at the other’s premieres. Both had previously released films
on Netflix (“Miss Americana” and “Homecoming”). And both are reported to
be receiving at least 50% of ticket sales.</p>
<p>Movie tickets to the show were more expensive than average, around
$23.32 versus Swift’s $20.78, according to data firm EntTelligence.</p>
<p>Critics and audiences gave “Renaissance” glowing reviews – it’s
sitting at 100% on Rotten Tomatoes and got a coveted A+ CinemaScore from
opening weekend audiences who were polled. EntTelligence also estimates
that the audience, around 900,000 strong, skewed a little older than
Swift’s.</p>
<p>“To have two concert films topping the chart in a single year is
pretty unprecedented,” Dergarabedian said. But to compare them too
closely would be a mistake.</p>
<p>“Taylor Swift was a total outlier and the result of a very specific
set of circumstances,” he said. “These two films are similar in genre
only.”</p>
<p>Lionsgate’s “The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds &amp; Snakes”
fell to second place in its third weekend with an estimated $14.5
million. The prequel has now earned over $121 million domestically.</p>
<p>“Godzilla Minus One” took third place on the North American charts
with $11 million from 2,308 locations — the biggest opening for a
foreign film in the U.S. this year. The well-reviewed Japanese
blockbuster distributed by Toho International cost only $15 million to
produce and has already earned $23 million in Japan.</p>
<p>“This year, we made a concentrated effort to answer the demand of the
marketplace and make Godzilla globally accessible across many different
platforms,” said Koji Ueda, President of Toho Global, in a
statement.</p>
<p>“Trolls Band Together” landed in fourth place in its third weekend
with $7.6 million, bringing its domestic total to $74.8 million.</p>
<p>Fifth place went to Disney’s “Wish,” which fell 62% from its
underwhelming first weekend, with $7.4 million from 3,900 locations.
Globally, it’s now made $81.6 million.</p>
<p>The studio’s other major film in theaters, “The Marvels” is winding
down in its fourth weekend with a disastrous global tally of $197
million against the reported $300 million it cost to make and market the
superhero film.</p>
<p>In its second weekend, Ridley Scott’s “Napoleon” earned an estimated
$7.1 million from 3,500 locations. Produced by Apple Original Films and
distributed by Sony Pictures, the film starring Joaquin Phoenix has now
made $45.7 million domestically against a $200 million budget.</p>
<p>Things should pick up in the final weeks of 2023, with films like
“Wonka” and “The Color Purple” yet to come. The industry is looking at a
$9 billion year — still trailing the $11 billion pre-pandemic norm, but
a marked improvement from the last few years. And there are still many
solid options for moviegoers, as the industry’s awards season gets into
full swing.</p>
<p>“We had a slow Thanksgiving and we’re having a pretty slow weekend
this weekend, but it’s a great weekend to be a moviegoer in terms of the
breadth and depth of the movies out there,” Dergarabedian said.</p>
<p>Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian
theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released
Monday.</p>

I wrote this as a
<a href="https://social.masto.land/@dave/111517322418415422">Mastodon
post</a> to a bunch of people who somehow I got cc’d to. I figured I
should share it here too.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Let’s start with feeds and build as much of a Mastodon as we can,
without inventing anything new and see what we come up with.
</li>
<li>
That way we know at every step we’re standing on a solid foundation of
interop.
</li>
<li>
At the same time invest in the feed support of every contender, no
matter what “verse” its part of.
</li>
<li>
John Spurlock has done an exemplary implementation of RSS 2.0 feeds for
Bluesky. That
<a href="https://rss.firesky.tv/?filter=from:scripting.com">format</a>
should be copied everywhere. He did it in about a week in July and it’s
great. We’re building all kinds of stuff on it. Wish it were in
Mastodon, and wish Bluesky would bake it in.
</li>
<li>
Forget about clubs, what we want is interop, maximally as widely as
possible to force the silos to get on board. They won’t unless they have
to.

<h2 id="doc-feedland-artcasting">Doc &amp; FeedLand &amp;
artcasting</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-03, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I pinged Doc the other day saying he should do an artcasting feed.
</p>
<p>
Doc is in addition to being a prodigious blogger, also is a photo taker
and story teller, so he is perfect for artcasting.
</p>
<p>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2017/07/29/doc.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I
was then going to think about what would be the easiest way to get him
going, and quickly realized the fastest way is Bluesky because
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+spurlock">John
Spurlock</a> did it right and his feeds coming out of Bluesky are
totally artcasting-compatible. Just like that. (Artcasting is one of
those cases where almost everyone was doing it the right way. Absolutely
no one invented it, it was just obvious how it should work, obvious to
enough people.)
</p>
<p>
But I wanted to talk about it with A8C people first, because it’s also
an opportunity to support it in WordPress, or to create a small app that
interfaces to WordPress, so it can lead here too. But Doc beat me to it,
he posted a
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dsearls.bsky.social/post/3kfnwb6dbf72b">beautiful
picture</a> of a building site his new hometown to Bluesky, and it
appeared in
<a href="https://rss.firesky.tv/?filter=from:dsearls.bsky.social">his
RSS 2.0 feed</a>, and of course it
<a href="https://feedland.com/?river=https%3A%2F%2Frss.firesky.tv%2F%3Ffilter%3Dfrom%3Adsearls.bsky.social">showed</a>
<a href="https://feedland.com/?item=594431">up</a>
<a href="https://feedland.com/?feedurl=https%3A%2F%2Frss.firesky.tv%2F%3Ffilter%3Dfrom%3Adsearls.bsky.social">in
FeedLand</a> when I subscribed to his feed.
</p>
<p>
So I added it to my collection of artcasting feeds, and the

<h2 id="the-world-depends-on-60-year-old-code-no-one-knows-anymore">The
world depends on 60-year-old code no one knows anymore</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>The problem is that very few people are interested in learning COBOL
these days. Coding it is cumbersome, it reads like an English lesson
(too much typing), the coding format is meticulous and inflexible, and
it takes far longer to compile than its competitors. And since nobody’s
learning it anymore, programmers who can work with and maintain all that
code are a increasingly hard to find. Many of these “COBOL cowboys” are
aging out of the workforce, and replacements are in short supply. This
puts us in a tricky predicament. We need to maintain and modernize the
code that underpins so much of the business and finance worlds, but we
don’t have enough skilled workers we need to carry out those updates.
This is precisely the kind of problem that IBM thinks it can fix with
AI. ↫ JD Sartain for PCMag It seems like learning and getting good at
COBOL is a surefire way to ensure job security. I wonder if there’s a
way to make modern applications or software in COBOL? I mean, there are
COBOL compilers for modern platforms, of course, but are there any
bindings (I think that’s the correct term?) for modern GUI toolkits like
GTK, Qt, and so on? The headline’s probably a bit hyperbolic, but the
core of the issue stands.</p>

<p>date: 2023-12-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>Hewlett-Packard’s 9000 Series 300 (HP300) was a range of technical
workstations based on Motorola 680×0 microprocessors. Superbly
engineered in modular form, and ahead of the curve in terms of
functionality, these workstations were used mainly as instrument
controllers and for desktop technical computing. The HP300 series
launched in 1985 with the models 310 (pictured below) and 320. It
evolved through numerous variants of increasing power, concluding with
the 38x models released in 1991. The series was officially obsolete as
of 1997. The definitive website dedicated to vintage Hewlett-Packard
computers is the wonderful HP Computer Museum, which has excellent and
wide-ranging archival resources. The present site is focused
specifically on the HP 9000 series 300 and is for anyone interested in
the history, conservation and restoration of these personal
workstations. ↫ hp-series300.net Everything you could possibly ever want
to know about the series 300, in one place. It’s incredibly detailed,
and if you have your eyes on buying one of these machines, I urge you to
keep this resource in a permanently open tab so you know what you’re
doing.</p>

shell and how control flow worked in it</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>On Unix, ‘test‘ and ‘[‘ are two names for (almost) the same program
and shell builtin. Although today people mostly use it under its ‘[‘
name, when it was introduced in V7 along side the Bourne shell, it only
was called ‘test‘; the ‘[‘ name was only nascent until years later. I
don’t know for sure why it was called ‘test‘, but there are interesting
hints about its potential genesis in the shell used in V6 Research Unix,
the predecessor to V7, and the control flow constructs that shell used.

I’ll start to maybe understand some of it.</p>

Insurgents Attack US Warship, Commercial Vessels in Red Sea</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Iranian-backed Houthi insurgents in Yemen launched armed drones and
missiles in a five-hour-long attack targeting a U.S. warship and several
commercial ships in the Red Sea, the Pentagon said Sunday, with at least
one of the missiles hitting a Bahamas-flagged cargo vessel. </p>
<p>“Houthi forces attacked multiple commercial vessels in the Red Sea
early this morning,” the Defense Department said. “The USS Carney lended
aid in some circumstances and shot down Houthi drones that were headed
in its general direction.” </p>
<p>It said the Carney, a guided missile destroyer, shot down two of the
drones, in what could be a further escalation in a string of maritime
attacks in the Middle East linked to the nearly two-month-old
Israel-Hamas war. The U.S. ship was not damaged in the incident. </p>
<p>The U.S. has in recent weeks shot down several drones headed toward
Israel that were launched from Yemen, and in Sunday’s attack, the
Pentagon said it responded to a distress call from the Unity Explorer,
which said it was under attack from missile fire. </p>
<p>A Houthi military spokesperson, Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree, claimed the
attacks, saying the rebels hit one vessel with a missile and another
with a drone while in the Bab el-Mandeb Strait that links the Red Sea to
the Gulf of Aden. </p>
<p>“The Yemeni armed forces continue to prevent Israeli ships from
navigating the Red Sea [and Gulf of Aden] until the Israeli aggression
against our steadfast brothers in the Gaza Strip stops,” Saree said.
“The Yemeni armed forces renew their warning to all Israeli ships or
those associated with Israelis that they will become a legitimate target
if they violate what is stated in this statement.” </p>
<p>Saree also identified the first vessel hit as the Unity Explorer,
which is owned by a British firm that includes Dan David Ungar, who
lives in Israel, as one of its officers. The Houthi spokesperson said
the second hit was a Panamanian-flagged container ship called Number 9,
which is linked to Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement. </p>
<p>Israeli media have identified Ungar as being the son of Israeli
shipping billionaire Abraham (Rami) Ungar. </p>
<p>For more than a month, Iranian-backed militias have conducted drone
and rocket attacks against the 2,500 American troops based in Iraq and
the 900 troops in Syria.</p>

id="kiss-say-farewell-to-live-touring-become-first-us-band-to-go-virtual-and-become-digital-avatars">Kiss
Say Farewell to Live Touring, Become First US Band to Go Virtual and
Become Digital Avatars</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>On Saturday night, Kiss closed out the final performance of their
“The End of the Road” farewell tour at New York City’s famed Madison
Square Garden.  </p>
<p>But as dedicated fans surely know — they were never going to call it
quits. Not really.  </p>
<p>During their encore, the band’s current lineup — founders Paul
Stanley and Gene Simmons as well as guitarist Tommy Thayer and drummer
Eric Singer — left the stage to reveal digital avatars of themselves.
After the transformation, the virtual Kiss launched into a performance
of “God Gave Rock and Roll to You.”  </p>
<p>The cutting-edge technology was used to tease a new chapter of the
rock band: after 50 years of Kiss, the band is now interested in a kind
of digital immortality.  </p>
<p>The avatars were created by George Lucas’ special-effects company,
Industrial Light &amp; Magic, in partnership with Pophouse Entertainment
Group, the latter of which was co-founded by ABBA’s Björn Ulvaeus. The
two companies recently teamed up for the “ABBA Voyage” show in London,
in which fans could attend a full concert by the Swedish band — as
performed by their digital avatars.  </p>
<p>Per Sundin, CEO of Pophouse Entertainment, says this new technology
allows Kiss to continue their legacy for “eternity.” He says the band
wasn’t on stage during virtual performance because “that’s the key
thing,” of the future-seeking technology. “Kiss could have a concert in
three cities in the same night across three different continents. That’s
what you could do with this.”  </p>
<p>In order to create their digital avatars, who are depicted as a kind
of superhero version of the band, Kiss performed in motion capture
suits.  </p>
<p>Experimentation with this kind of technology has become increasingly
common in certain sections of the music industry. In October K-pop star
Mark Tuan partnered with Soul Machines to create an autonomously
automated “digital twin” called “Digital Mark.” In doing so, Tuan became
the first celebrity to attach their likeness to OpenAI’s GPT
integration, artificial intelligence technology that allows fans to
engage in one-on-one conversations with Tuan’s avatar.  </p>
<p>Aespa, the K-pop girl group, frequently perform alongside their
digital avatars — the quartet is meant to be viewed as an octet with
digital twins. Another girl group, Eternity, is made up entirely of
virtual characters — no humans necessary.  </p>
<p>“What we’ve accomplished has been amazing, but it’s not enough. The
band deserves to live on because the band is bigger than we are,” Kiss
frontman Paul Stanley said in a roundtable interview. “It’s exciting for
us to go the next step and see Kiss immortalized.”  </p>
<p>“We can be forever young and forever iconic by taking us to places
we’ve never dreamed of before,” Kiss bassist Gene Simmons added. “The
technology is going to make Paul jump higher than he’s ever done
before.”  </p>
<p>And for those who couldn’t make the Madison Square Garden show — stay

<h2
id="kissingers-unwavering-support-for-brutal-regimes-still-haunts-latin-america">Kissinger’s
Unwavering Support for Brutal Regimes Still Haunts Latin America</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>In Chile, leftists were tortured, tossed from helicopters and forced
to watch relatives be raped. In Argentina, many were “disappeared” by
members of the brutal military dictatorship that held detainees in
concentration camps.</p>
<p>It all happened with the endorsement of Henry Kissinger, the former
U.S. secretary of state who died Wednesday at age 100.</p>
<p>As tributes poured in for the towering figure who was the top U.S.
diplomat under Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, the mood was
decidedly different in South America, where many countries were scarred
deeply during the Cold War by human rights abuses inflicted in the name
of anti-communism and where many continue to harbor a deep distrust of
their powerful neighbor to the north.</p>
<p>“I don’t know of any U.S. citizen who is more deplored, more disliked
in Latin America than Henry Kissinger,” said Stephen Rabe, a retired
University of Texas at Dallas history professor who wrote a book about
Kissinger’s relationship with Latin America. “You know, the reality is,
if he had traveled once democracy returned to Argentina, to Brazil, to
Uruguay — if he had traveled to any of those countries he would have
been immediately arrested.”</p>
<p>There is likely no starker example of Kissinger’s meddling with
democracy in the region and then supporting brutality in the name of
anti-communism than Chile.</p>
<p>In Chile, Kissinger played a key role in the efforts to do everything
in the United States’ power to undermine and weaken the socialist
government of Salvador Allende, who was elected president in 1970.
Kissinger then used his sway to prop up the military dictatorship of
Gen. Augusto Pinochet, who rose to power in a 1973 coup, repeatedly
refusing to call attention to the numerous human rights violations of
Pinochet’s regime, which murdered opponents, canceled elections,
restricted the media, suppressed labor unions and disbanded political
parties.</p>
<p>Kissinger long alleged that he wasn’t aware of the human rights
abuses that were committed in the region, but records show that this
wasn’t the case, said Peter Kornbluh, a senior analyst at the National
Security Archive that is in charge of its Chile project.</p>
<p>“The declassified historical record, the documents that Kissinger
wrote, read and said, leave no doubt that he was the chief architect of
the U.S. policy to destabilize the Allende government and that he was
also the chief enabler of helping the Pinochet regime consolidate what
became a bloody, 17-year infamous dictatorship,” Kornbluh said.</p>
<p>Kissinger was “somewhat obsessed” with Allende’s government, fearing
that the rise of a socialist government through democratic means could
have a contagion effect in the region, said Chilean Sen. José Miguel
Insulza, a former secretary general of the Organization of American
States who served as a foreign policy adviser in Allende’s
government.</p>
<p>“For him, any action that meant defending the national interest of
the United States seemed justifiable,” Insulza said.</p>
<p>Kissinger feared what Allende’s government could mean for the
world.</p>
<p>“In geopolitical terms, Kissinger considered the rise of a left-wing
coalition to power through democratic means even more dangerous than the
example set by Cuba. Indeed, this could be replicated in Western
countries with powerful communist parties in terms of electoral
influence, such as in Italy,” said Rolando Álvarez, a history professor
at the University of Santiago, Chile.</p>
<p>Kissinger was seemingly unaffected by tales of suffering at the hands
of military officers, even though his own family arrived in the U.S. as
refugees who had to flee Nazi Germany in his teens.</p>
<p>“By the end of 1976, State Department aides were telling Henry
Kissinger, a Jew, that Jews were being targeted in Argentina,” Rabe
said. “And Kissinger just didn’t do anything.”</p>
<p>In Chile’s neighbor, Argentina, a military junta rose to power in
1976 vowing to combat leftist “subversives.” Kissinger made clear he had
no objections to their brutal tactics and repeatedly ignored calls from
other State Department officials to raise more concerns about human
rights violations.</p>
<p>In a June 1976 meeting, Kissinger had a message for Argentina’s
foreign minister, Admiral César Augusto Guzzetti: “If there are things
that have to be done, you should do them quickly.” He later reiterated
that support during a meeting in October 1976 — a time when Argentine
officials were worried the U.S. would raise human rights concerns amid
increasing reports of torture and disappearances.</p>
<p>Guzzetti was “overjoyed” at the meetings, and “had felt that
Kissinger had given him the signal that the United States had no
objection to wholesale slaughter,” Rabe said.</p>
<p>Kissinger had a similar attitude toward other military dictatorships
in the region, including in Uruguay and Brazil, and never raised
objections to what was known as Operation Condor, a clandestine program
that allowed military regimes in that part of the world to illegally
pursue, detain, torture and assassinate political dissidents who fled
their countries.</p>
<p>That attitude made a lasting imprint on Latin Americans’ psyche.</p>
<p>“At least here in Latin America, what I perceived in Henry
Kissinger’s vision is very negative because it’s a kind of anything goes
mentality. No matter how brutal the dictatorship is that must be
supported, it doesn’t matter,” said Francisco Bustos, a human rights
lawyer and professor at the University of Chile.</p>
<p>Decades later, the effects of that policy are still being felt in a
region that feels the U.S. would go to any lengths to support its
interests.</p>
<p>“There is a segment of political parties and movements in Latin
America, including Chile, where the relationship with the United States
is essentially marked by anti-imperialism. This perspective essentially
sees any U.S. administration, whether Democratic or Republican, liberal,
progressive, or ultraconservative, as more or less the same,” said
Gilberto Aranda, an international relations professor at the University
of Chile.</p>
<p>Although U.S. intervention in a region that was often referred to as
“America’s backyard” has a long history, Kissinger seemed to take that
into overdrive.</p>
<p>It’s no surprise then that one of the harshest reactions to
Kissinger’s death came from a Chilean official.</p>
<p>“A man has died whose historical brilliance never managed to conceal
his profound moral misery,” Chile’s ambassador to the United States,
Juan Gabriel Valdes, posted on the social media platform X. Chile’s
leftist President Gabriel Boric then retweeted the message.</p>

<p>date: 2023-12-03, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;America&amp;#8217;s high schools face a growing crisis: Millions of students who entered ninth grade in the fall of 2020, at the height of the pandemic, are set to graduate this spring, with little hope of recovering from the learning loss incurred while schools were shut. Simply put, they&amp;#8217;re running out of time. Since the start of the pandemic, the academic performance of high school students has been abysmal. In 2022, average scores on the ACT exam were the lowest in 30 years; this year&amp;#8217;s results were even worse. Barely 20% of students met college-readiness benchmarks in all four areas tested &amp;#8212; English, math, reading and science &amp;#8212; and 43% met none, up from 35% in 2018. Other data show broad declines in reading and math proficiency, while the number of students receiving failing grades has soared. In Houston, the country&amp;#8217;s eighth-largest public school district, as many as half of high school students have flunked at least one course since the start of the pandemic, compared to one-third in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

Change Shuts Decades-Old New England Shrimp Fishery</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New England’s long-shuttered shrimp business, which fell victim to
warming waters, will remain in a fishing moratorium indefinitely,
fishery regulators ruled Friday. </p>
<p>The shrimping business was based mostly in Maine and produced small,
pink shrimp that were a winter delicacy in New England and across the
country. The industry has been in a moratorium since 2013 in large part
because environmental conditions off New England are unfavorable for the
cold water-loving shrimp. </p>
<p>That moratorium will remain in effect with no firm end date, a board
of the regulatory Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission voted
Friday. The board stopped short of calling the move a permanent
moratorium because it included a provision to continue monitoring the
shrimp population and consider reopening the fishery if the crustaceans
approach a healthy level. </p>
<p>‘I think we’re all done’</p>
<p>But it was clear board members saw little chance of a future for a
fishery that once provided a beloved seafood item that appeared on
restaurant menus and in seafood markets every year around
Christmas. </p>
<p>“I think we’re all done here with this stock. I see the water
temperatures. I don’t think we’re coming back,” said Mike Armstrong, an
environmental analyst and member of the panel. </p>
<p>The warming of the Gulf of Maine, a body of water where the shrimp
live that is critical to U.S. commercial fishing for species such as
scallops and lobsters, is an ongoing subject of scientific study. In
addition to the shrimp, other New England species, such as Atlantic cod,
have also declined in the face of warming waters and overfishing. </p>
<p>Previous extensions of the shrimp fishing moratorium have been for
one year or three years at a time. However, the shrimp stock isn’t
showing signs of improvement, said Chelsea Tuohy, a fishery management
plan coordinator for the commission. </p>
<p>“Recently, under no fishing mortality, the population continues to
decline,” Tuohy said. “The Gulf of Maine is warming quicker than other
areas of the ocean, and the shrimp tend not to do well in warming
waters.” </p>
<p>The commercial fishery for the New England shrimp, which are also
called Maine shrimp or pink shrimp, was established in the 1950s and
peaked at nearly 30 million pounds (13.6 million kilograms) per year in
the late 1960s, Atlantic States commission documents state. Maine
fishermen caught more than 10 million pounds of the shrimp per year as
recently as 2011. Fishermen in Massachusetts and New Hampshire also once
sought them. </p>
<p>New approaches?</p>
<p>Shrimp are among the most popular seafood items in the world, and New
England shrimp were once a small part of the worldwide shrimp industry,
which includes wild-caught and farmed shrimp species from many parts of
the globe. Canadian fishermen have long harvested the same species of
shrimp as New England fishermen, and their exports of the shrimp are
still sometimes found in U.S. seafood markets. </p>
<p>Some U.S. fishermen have advocated trying to save New England’s
shrimp fishery with new management approaches. Glen Libby, a former
shrimp trawler, said regulators need to gather more data before taking
drastic measures to close a historic fishery. </p>
<p>The shrimp panel also voted to investigate the possibility of an
industry-based research program about the fishery. </p>
<p>“A lot of people, mostly in the industry, don’t think that we have a
complete picture of what’s going on,” Libby said. “Let’s not open it up,
let’s just have a limited season. There’s a hunger for more data, that’s
for sure.”</p>

id="egg-producers-ordered-to-pay-17.7m-for-conspiring-to-limit-supplies">Egg
Producers Ordered to Pay $17.7M for Conspiring to Limit Supplies</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A federal jury in Illinois ordered $17.7 million in damages — an
amount tripled to more than $53 million under federal law — to be paid
to several food manufacturing companies who had sued major egg producers
over a conspiracy to limit the egg supply in the U.S. </p>
<p>The jury ruled last week that the egg producers used various means to
limit the domestic supply of eggs to increase the price of products
during the 2000s. The time frame of the conspiracy was an issue
throughout the case; jurors ultimately determined the actions at issue
occurred between 2004 and 2008. </p>
<p>The damages verdict was reached Friday in the Northern District of
Illinois. According to federal antitrust law, the damages are
automatically tripled, bringing the total to more than $53 million.
Court documents on the verdict were not readily available Friday
evening, but statements from the manufacturers’ attorney and one of the
egg producers confirmed a total of about $17.7 million. </p>
<p>“We are extremely grateful for the jury’s service and findings,”
Brandon Fox, an attorney representing the food manufacturers, said in a
statement. “This was an important case for many reasons, and the jury’s
award recognizes its significance.” </p>
<p>Attorneys for the four egg suppliers named in the lawsuit did not
immediately return phone messages on Friday. Court documents show the
defendants have denied the claims. </p>
<p>The egg suppliers include the family company of its former chairman, 
John Rust, who’s running for the U.S. Senate in Indiana. In a written
statement on the verdict, Rust said the jury’s decision “will be
appealed.” </p>
<p>Strategies detailed</p>
<p>The jury found that the egg suppliers exported eggs abroad to reduce
the overall supply in the domestic market, as well as limited the number
of chickens through means including cage space, early slaughter and
flock reduction, court documents say. </p>
<p>Jurors were specifically told not to consider more recent changes in
egg pricing during their deliberations. </p>
<p>Food manufacturers joining as plaintiffs in the lawsuit against the
egg producers are Kraft Foods Global Inc., Kellogg Co., General Mills
Inc. and Nestle USA Inc. </p>
<p>The jury found the egg suppliers who participated in the conspiracy
were Cal-Maine Foods Inc., United Egg Producers Inc., United States Egg
Marketers Inc. and Rose Acre Farms Inc., a southern Indiana company
previously chaired by Rust. </p>
<p>Rose Acre Farms, which identifies itself as the second-largest egg
producer in the U.S., disagreed with the jury’s verdict in a written
statement. </p>
<p>“Rose Acre has and continues to steadfastly deny being part of any
anti-competitive egg price-fixing conspiracy, and we will continue to
explore and consider all legal options, including post-trial relief and
appeal,” the statement said. </p>
<p>Cal-Maine Foods said in a written statement it has petitioned the
court to rule in its favor and will continue to evaluate its options,
“including, if necessary, an appeal.” </p>
<p>“Cal-Maine Foods respects the jury’s decision and appreciates that
the damages awarded by the jury are relatively modest compared to the
damages sought but remains disappointed with the verdict as Cal-Maine
Foods continues to believe that the company did nothing wrong,” the
statement said. </p>
<p>Emails sent to the United Egg Producers and United States Egg
Marketers representatives were not immediately returned Friday.</p>

Worry Philadelphia Ski Mask Ban Will Unfairly Target Some</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Philadelphia City Council passed legislation to ban ski masks in some
public spaces, a measure supporters say will increase public safety amid
high violent crime, but opponents argue it will unfairly target people
without proof of any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>The legislation passed on Thursday with a 13-2 vote, and now goes to
Democratic Mayor Jim Kenney. A spokesperson said he would review the
legislation and “looks forward to our ongoing work with City Council on
the urgent matter of ensuring public safety.”</p>
<p>The measure would ban ski masks, or balaclavas, in public spaces like
schools, recreation centers, parks, city-owned buildings and on public
transportation. It defines the garment as a close-fitting covering over
the whole head, with holes only for the eyes, nose, or mouth.</p>
<p>A $250 fine would be imposed against anyone who violates the law. It
has exceptions for religious garb and protests.</p>
<p>The legislation comes as the nation’s sixth-largest city has been
beleaguered by violent crime, tallying a record number of homicides in
2021, most of them gun-related. That number fell from 562 to 516 in 2022
but was still higher than pre-pandemic levels, and advocates have said
they are on track to decrease further this year.</p>
<p>Big cities across the nation experienced spikes in crime as social
supports were upended during the pandemic, though crime has started to
decrease to pre-pandemic levels.</p>
<p>Philadelphia’s move goes in the opposite direction to New York City,
which relaxed a law that prohibited masks, during the COVID-19
pandemic.</p>
<p>In 2020, New York City repealed a more than century-old law that
prohibited face coverings in public. It was meant to permit mask-wearing
during the coronavirus outbreak. Supporters of the repeal said the
former law also exposed men of color to police harassment and was used
against protesters during demonstrations.</p>
<p>Concerns about theft, even as crime decreases in the city, pushed
Mayor Eric Adams, a former police officer, to suggest storeowners should
refuse to admit anyone wearing a mask unless it was lowered to be picked
up by store cameras.</p>
<p>Philadelphia’s ban cites an increase in those casually wearing ski
masks in 2020 — during the beginning of the pandemic — alongside a rise
in individuals sought by Philadelphia police. The ski masks conceal
people’s identities, making it harder for the police to identify them,
supporters say. Messages were left for the bill’s sponsor, Councilman
Anthony Phillips.</p>
<p>But it drew sharp opposition from some progressive members of Council
and the ACLU of Pennsylvania, which said there was no evidence to
support that ski masks cause or encourage crime.</p>
<p>“Giving police the authority to stop civilians without suspicion of
unlawful activity is unconstitutional,” Solomon Furious Worlds, an
attorney for the ACLU, said in a statement.</p>
<p>The ban is part of a larger puzzle the Democrats are grappling with:
balancing accountability after protests against police brutality, while
trying to address community concerns about safety.</p>
<p>Mayor-elect Cherelle Parker won election with a tough-on-crime
approach, vowing to put hundreds of officers on the street, embedded
within communities.</p>
<p>She’s drawn criticism for her stance that officers should use
“reasonable suspicion” to stop people — which opponents feel comes
uncomfortably close to the controversial stop-and-frisk tactic. She
recently tapped longtime police official Kevin Bethel as her police
commissioner, saying he had the experience to restore order while
holding police accountable.</p>

Ill-Prepared to House Growing Number of Older People, Study Says</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Michael Genaldi’s road to homelessness began early this year when a
car slammed into the rear of his motorcycle, crushed three of his ribs,
and left him in a coma for over a month.</p>
<p>The 58-year-old lost his job as a machine operator, then his home,
and he was living in his truck when he was diagnosed with stage 2 lung
cancer. Too young to get Social Security, Genaldi now lives temporarily
in a shelter for people 55 and older in Phoenix while he navigates the
process of qualifying for disability payments.</p>
<p>As its population ages, the United States is ill-prepared to
adequately house and care for the growing number of older people,
concludes a new report being released Thursday by Harvard University’s
Joint Center for Housing Studies.</p>
<p>Without enough government help, “many older adults will have to forgo
needed care or rely on family and friends for assistance,” warned
Jennifer Molinsky, project director of the center’s Housing an Aging
Society Program. Many, like Genaldi, will become homeless.</p>
<p>Molinsky said more governmental assistance could better help the
upsurge of older Americans who are baby boomers born after World War
II.</p>
<p>The report says that in 2021, federal housing assistance like Section
8 or Section 202 — which provides housing with supportive services such
as cleaning, cooking and transportation for older people — was only
sufficient for a little more than a third of the 5.9 million renters
ages 62 and over who were eligible.</p>
<p>Creative ideas are especially needed now to house people with fixed
or dwindling incomes and with insufficient savings, the report says.
Think house or apartment sharing to cut back on costs rather than living
alone, in accessory dwelling units or ADUs known as casitas, granny
flats and in-law units. There are also cohousing communities where
individual homes — sometimes even tiny homes — are arranged around a
building with a communal space such as a dining room.</p>
<p>Over the next decade, the U.S. population over the age of 75 will
increase by 45%, growing from 17 million to nearly 25 million. And many
of those people are expected to struggle financially. The report notes
that in 2021, nearly 11.2 million older adults were “cost burdened,”
which means they spend more than 30% of their income on housing.</p>
<p>Some of the highest cost-burden rates for renters 65 and older were
in Sunbelt areas traditionally popular for retirement: Las Vegas; San
Diego; Raleigh, North Carolina; Miami and Daytona Beach, Florida.</p>
<p>Like renters, many older homeowners also struggle to keep a roof over
their head.</p>
<p>The report says that mortgage debt among older adults is rising, with
the median mortgage debt for homeowners 65 to 79 shooting up over 400%
from $21,000 in 1989 to $110,000 in 2022 as people increasingly need to
access cash for basic needs and care.</p>
<p>Many older adults also find it challenging to obtain the additional
services they need as they age, with the costs of long-term care
averaging over $100 a day.</p>
<p>The report says the households of older people of color are far more
likely to be cost burdened than older white households, especially Black
and Latino households. Older people who live alone are also more likely
to be cost burdened than married or partnered couples: 47% versus 21% of
couples.</p>
<p>In Phoenix, Angelita Saldaña, 56, became homeless after her marriage
fell apart. The granddaughter of Mexican immigrants, Saldaña initially
lived in her truck with her pet dog Gaspar, but they now live at the
60-bed shelter where Genaldi stays with his pet dog Chico.</p>
<p>Saldaña said her $941 monthly disability check isn’t enough to pay
for even a studio apartment in the area, where average rents start at
around $1,200. A caseworker is trying to help her find something she can
afford.</p>
<p>In the meantime, she has a motel room to herself with a private
bathroom.</p>
<p>“Here, I can sleep good,” she said, unlike the months she spent at
the state’s largest shelter in downtown Phoenix, which has 10 times as
many beds.</p>
<p>Lisa Glow, the CEO for Central Arizona Shelter Services, which
operates both facilities, said older people do much better in a shelter
designed with their needs in mind — including more space, limited stairs
and wider doorways for wheelchairs.</p>
<p>Glow spoke of an 82-year-old man with dementia who struggled to sleep
on a bunk bed at the downtown shelter before he was transferred. Staff
members tracked down his family and got him transferred to a skilled
nursing facility for more personalized care.</p>
<p>“The downtown shelter is not a good place for an aging adult with
chronic conditions,” said Glow. “We see a lot of people there in their
70s and 80s.”</p>
<p>“I’ve been shocked to see so many seniors on the street,” she added.
“People with wheelchairs. People with walkers.”</p>

<h2 id="flu-on-rise-rsv-infections-may-be-peaking-us-says">Flu on Rise,
RSV Infections May Be Peaking, US Says</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Flu is picking up steam while RSV lung infections that can hit kids
and older people hard may be peaking, U.S. health officials said
Friday.</p>
<p>COVID-19, though, continues to cause the most hospitalizations and
deaths among respiratory illnesses — about 15,000 hospitalizations and
about 1,000 deaths every week, said Dr. Mandy Cohen, head of the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>The agency is also looking into reports of pneumonia outbreaks in
children in two states, but Cohen said “there is no evidence” that they
are due to anything unusual.</p>
<p>As for the flu season, seven states were reporting high levels of
flu-like illnesses in early November. In a new CDC report Friday, the
agency said the tally was up to 11 states — mostly in the South and
Southwest.</p>
<p>In the last month, RSV infections rose sharply in some parts of the
country, nearly filling hospital emergency departments in Georgia, Texas
and some other states. But “we think we’re near the peak of RSV season
or will be in the next week or so,” Cohen said.</p>
<p>RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus is a common cause of mild
coldlike symptoms but it can be dangerous for infants and older
people.</p>
<p>Cohen was asked about pneumonia cases in children reported in
Massachusetts and in Warren County, Ohio, near Cincinnati. There are a
number of possible causes of the lung infection, and it can be a
complication of COVID-19, flu, or RSV.</p>
<p>In Ohio, health officials have reported 145 cases since August and
most of the children recovered at home. The illnesses were caused by a
variety of common viruses and bacteria, officials said.</p>
<p>Massachusetts health officials said there’s been a modest increase in
pneumonia in kids but that it is appropriate for the season.</p>
<p>China recently had a surge in respiratory illnesses which health
officials there attributed to the flu and other customary causes.</p>

Doll Honoring Cherokee Nation Leader Met With Mixed Emotions</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>An iconic chief of the Cherokee Nation, Wilma Mankiller, inspired
countless Native American children as a powerful but humble leader who
expanded early education and rural health care.</p>
<p>Her reach is now broadening with a quintessential American honor: a
Barbie doll in the late Mankiller’s likeness as part of toymaker
Mattel’s “Inspiring Women” series.</p>
<p>A public ceremony honoring Mankiller’s legacy is set for Tuesday in
Tahlequah in northeast Oklahoma, where the Cherokee Nation is
headquartered.</p>
<p>Mankiller was the nation’s first female principal chief, leading the
tribe for a decade until 1995. She focused on improving social
conditions through consensus and on restoring pride in Native heritage.
She met with three U.S. presidents and received the Presidential Medal
of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian award.</p>
<p>She also met snide remarks about her surname — a military title —
with humor, often delivering a straight-faced response: “Mankiller is
actually a well-earned nickname.” She died in 2010.</p>
<p>The tribe’s current leader, Principal Chief Chuck Hoskin Jr.,
applauded Mattel for commemorating Mankiller.</p>
<p>“When Native girls see it, they can achieve it, and Wilma Mankiller
has shown countless young women to be fearless and speak up for
Indigenous and human rights,” Hoskin said in a statement. “Wilma
Mankiller is a champion for the Cherokee Nation, for Indian Country, and
even my own daughter.”</p>
<p>Mankiller, whose likeness is on a U.S. quarter issued in 2021, is the
second Native American woman honored with a Barbie doll. Famed aviator
Bessie Coleman, who was of Black and Cherokee ancestry, was depicted
earlier this year.</p>
<p>Other dolls in the series include Maya Angelou, Ida B. Wells, Jane
Goodall and Madam C.J. Walker.</p>
<p>The rollout of the Mankiller Barbie doll, wearing a ribbon skirt,
black shoes and carrying a woven basket, has been met with conflicting
reactions.</p>
<p>Many say the doll is a fitting tribute for a remarkable leader who
faced conflict head-on and helped the tribe triple its enrollment,
double its employment and build new health centers and children’s
programs.</p>
<p>Still, some Cherokee women are critical, saying Mattel overlooked
problematic details on the doll and the packaging.</p>
<p>“Mixed emotions shared by me and many other Cherokee women who have
now purchased the product revolve around whether a Wilma Barbie captures
her legacy, her physical features and the importance of centering
Cherokee women in decision making,” Stacy Leeds, the law school dean at
Arizona State University and a former Cherokee Nation Supreme Court
justice, told The Associated Press in an email.</p>
<p>Regina Thompson, a Cherokee basket weaver who grew up near Tahlequah,
doesn’t think the doll looks like Mankiller. Mattel should have
considered traditional pucker toe moccasins, instead of black shoes, and
included symbols on the basket that Cherokees use to tell a story, she
said.</p>
<p>“Wilma’s name is the only thing Cherokee on that box,” Thompson said.
“Nothing about that doll is Wilma, nothing.”</p>
<p>The Cherokee language symbols on the packaging also are wrong, she
noted. Two symbols look similar, and the one used translates to
“chicken,” rather than “Cherokee.”</p>
<p>Mattel spokesperson Devin Tucker said the company is aware of the
problem with the syllabary and is “discussing options.” The company
worked with Mankiller’s estate, which is led by her husband, Charlie
Soap, and her friend Kristina Kiehl, on the creation of the doll. Soap
and Kiehl did not respond to messages left by the AP.</p>
<p>Mattel did not consult with the Cherokee Nation on the doll.</p>
<p>“Regrettably, the Mattel company did not work directly with the
tribal government’s design and communications team to secure the
official seal or verify it,” the tribe said in a statement. “The
printing mistake itself does not diminish what it means for the Cherokee
people to see this tribute to Wilma and who she was and what she stood
for.”</p>
<p>Several Cherokees also criticized Mattel for not consulting with
Mankiller’s only surviving child, Felicia Olaya, who said she was
unaware of the doll until about a week before its public launch.</p>
<p>“I have no issues with the doll. I have no issues with honoring my
mom in different ways,” said Olaya, who acknowledged she and Soap, her
stepfather, are estranged. “The issue is that no one informed me, no one
told me. I didn’t know it was coming.”</p>
<p>Olaya also wonders how her mother would feel about being honored with
a Barbie doll.</p>
<p>“I heard her once on the phone saying, ‘I’m not Princess Diana, nor
am I Barbie,’” Olaya recalled. “I think she probably would have been a
little conflicted on that, because my mom was very humble. She wasn’t
the type of person who had her honorary degrees or awards plastered all
over the wall. They were in tubs in her pole barn.”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure how she would feel about this,” Olaya said.</p>
<p>Still, Olaya said she hopes to buy some of the dolls for her
grandchildren and is always grateful for people to learn about her
mother’s legacy.</p>
<p>“I have a warm feeling about the thought of my granddaughters playing
with a Wilma Mankiller Barbie,” she said.</p>

Decries Isolationists Who Want US to ‘Retreat From Responsibility’</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Saturday denounced those who
advocate “an American retreat from responsibility” and said sustained
U.S. leadership is needed to help keep the world as safe, free and
prosperous as possible. He also urged Congress to end the partisan
gridlock that has stalled the federal budget and war spending. </p>
<p>The United States must reject calls to turn away from global
interests and become more isolationist, he told an audience of
lawmakers, corporate and defense leaders and government officials
attending a security conference. Those who “try to pull up the
drawbridge,” he said, undermine the security that has led to decades of
prosperity. </p>
<p>In his remarks at the Reagan National Defense Forum in California’s
Simi Valley, Austin delivered a lengthy defense of U.S. support to
Israel in its war against Hamas and to Ukraine in its struggle to battle
Russia’s invasion.</p>
<p>“The world will only become more dangerous if tyrants and terrorists
believe that they can get away with wholesale aggression and mass
slaughter,” he said.</p>
<p>‘It is not bold’</p>
<p>Austin met privately with top lawmakers on the House and Senate Armed
Services Committees. </p>
<p>His message of rejecting isolationism appeared directed at
conservative lawmakers who are increasingly opposed to spending on
overseas wars and back former President Donald Trump’s “America First”
ideology. </p>
<p>“You’ll hear some people try to brand an American retreat from
responsibility as bold new leadership,” Austin said. “Make no mistake:
It is not bold. It is not new. And it is not leadership.” </p>
<p>Congress has failed to approve any new money for the wars in Ukraine
and Israel and has managed to pass only a short-term budget bill, known
as a continuing resolution, that runs out early next year. The Senate
has been deadlocked for months over one lawmaker’s move to block
hundreds of military nominations, including critical senior commanders
for key regions around the world. </p>
<p>“Our competitors don’t have to operate under continuing resolutions.
And doing so erodes both our security and our ability to compete,”
Austin said. He opened his speech with a plea to the lawmakers in the
crowd to pass both the budget and the supplemental funding for the
wars. </p>
<p>War spending would create jobs</p>
<p>Administration officials have warned that money for Ukraine is
running out and may only last through the end of this year. The Pentagon
has about $5 billion worth of equipment it can send from its own
stockpiles and has been eating away at almost weekly. Money to replace
military weapons and equipment taken from Pentagon stocks to send to
Ukraine is rapidly dwindling, and totals about $1 billion. </p>
<p>Austin, who was in Ukraine’s capital less than two weeks ago, has
repeatedly pressed the importance of helping Ukraine battle Russia’s
invasion, as part of a broader campaign to prevent Russian President
Vladimir Putin from threatening other countries in Europe. </p>
<p>Austin also noted that as much as $50 billion of that supplemental
budget request for the wars would flow through American defense
companies, helping to create or support tens of thousands of jobs in
more than 30 states. </p>
<p>While he did not mention it in his address, Austin has often
criticized Congress for its failure to confirm more than 400 military
officers nominated for promotions or other jobs. </p>
<p>Senator Tommy Tuberville, a Republican from the state of Alabama, has
blocked the nominations and objected when other senators have tried to
get some through. On just two occasions, the Senate has managed to vote
to confirm a total of six high-ranking leaders. </p>
<p>Almost 400 military nominations are in limbo, and the number is
growing. Frustrated Republicans have tried unsuccessfully for almost
nine months to persuade Tuberville to drop the holds, and negotiations
are continuing. Senior military officials have warned repeatedly that
the situation threatens readiness and national security.</p>

Weekly Recap, Nov. 26–Dec. 2</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Editor’s note: Here is a look at immigration-related news around the
U.S. this week. Questions? Tips? Comments? Email the VOA immigration
team: ImmigrationUnit@voanews.com.</p>
<p>For Some DACA Recipients, Leaving US Only Way to Escape Legal
Limbo</p>
<p>In 2020, Tawheeda Wahabzada had had enough. It was time to leave the
country she’d grown up in. “The idea of leaving has always been at the
back of my mind. … It was a constant reminder that this is temporary,
and I felt I wasn’t able to live a meaningful life because of my
status,” she said. Wahabzada is one of a growing number of young
immigrants brought to the United States as children who do not want to
live in legal limbo anymore. She, like millions of other immigrants who
entered the country without permission or overstayed their visas, has no
path to citizenship. VOA’s Immigration reporter Aline Barros has the
story.  </p>
<p>Mexican Journalist Granted US Asylum After 15-Year Journey</p>
<p>Emilio Gutierrez Soto came to the National Press Club on Wednesday
with a message of gratitude. Press freedom advocates came with a call to
action. The 60-year-old journalist fled with his son to the U.S.-Mexico
border in 2008 seeking asylum after receiving death threats because of
his reporting on Mexican military corruption. After 15 years, the Board
of Immigration Appeals ruled in favor of Gutierrez Soto. He still needs
to go in front of an immigration judge in March 2024 to receive his
asylum papers, but his immigration lawyer said his case has been
resolved. VOA’s Immigration reporter Aline Barros has the story.</p>
<p>US Closing Remote Arizona Border Crossing, Citing Overwhelming
Migrant Arrivals</p>
<p>So many migrants are crossing from Mexico into the United States
around remote Lukeville, Arizona, that U.S. officials say they will
close the port of entry there so that the operations officials who watch
over vehicle and pedestrian traffic going both ways can help Border
Patrol agents arrest and process the new arrivals. Customs and Border
Protection announced Friday that the temporary closure of the crossing
will start Monday as officials grapple with changing migration routes
that have overwhelmed Border Patrol agents stationed there. Arizona’s
U.S. senators and governor called planned closure “unacceptable.”
Reported by The Associated Press.</p>
<p>Northern US Cities Scramble to House Migrants for Winter</p>
<p>Chicago is scrambling to house hundreds of asylum-seekers who are
still sheltering on sidewalks, at police stations and at the city’s
busiest airport as the cold weather sets in and with winter just around
the corner. The country’s third-largest city announced a partnership
with religious leaders this week to house 400 of the migrants in
churches. But with nighttime temperatures dropping below freezing and
chillier conditions still ahead, more than 1,000 were still living at
police stations or at O’Hare International Airport as of Friday,
according to the city dashboard. The Associated Press reports.</p>
<p>Immigration around the world</p>
<p>Former Somali Refugee Wins Prestigious UN Award</p>
<p>A former child refugee from Somalia has won the prestigious UNHCR
Nansen Refugee Award. Abdullahi Mire, 36, was recognized for bringing
100,000 books to his compatriots languishing in sprawling camps in
Kenya. Reported by VOA’s Mohamed Olad Hassan.</p>
<p>Finland Closes Russian Border Over Migrant Influx, Estonia Could
Follow</p>
<p>Finland closed its entire 1,340-kilometer border with Russia this
week, accusing Moscow of sending asylum-seekers across the frontier in a
hybrid attack in retaliation for its decision to join NATO. Russia
denies the accusation. VOA’s Henry Ridgwell has more.</p>
<p>Greek Police Arrest 6 Alleged Migrant Traffickers, Hunting 7 More</p>
<p>Greek police have arrested six people who they say are members of a
large human trafficking gang that violently extorted money from migrants
to assist them in crossing into neighboring Albania and travel to
European Union countries to the north. Reported by The Associated
Press.</p>
<p>Afghans Face Abuses in Pakistan, US Announces Hotline</p>
<p>Pakistani police are facing accusations of unlawfully detaining,
beating, extorting and sexually harassing Afghan refugees as part of a
coercive campaign aimed at compelling them to return to their home
country. By VOA’s Akmal Dawi.</p>
<p>About Half of Nicaragua’s Population Wants to Emigrate, Study
Says</p>
<p>Lawyer Isabel Lazo’s jobs are being systematically canceled by
Nicaragua’s increasingly repressive government. Lazo worked at a
university before the government of President Daniel Ortega closed it.
She now is employed at a nongovernmental organization that she fears
will soon be shuttered too. The Associated Press reports.</p>
<p>Pakistani Top Court Seeks Government Response on Afghan Expulsion
Policy</p>
<p>Pakistan’s Supreme Court asked the government Friday to respond to
questions raised over its policy of expelling Afghans residing illegally
in the country, observing that Islamabad must abide by United Nations’
resolutions protecting refugees. Reported by Sarah Zaman.</p>
<p>Rohingya Refugees Fleeing Bangladesh by Boat This Year Top 2022
Number</p>
<p>The number of Rohingya taking risky boat trips across the Andaman Sea
to flee mounting hunger and hopelessness in the refugee camps of
Bangladesh this year has topped last year’s numbers and could keep
rising, rights groups and aid agencies told VOA. By Zsombor Peter.</p>
<p>News Brief</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, through U.S. Immigration
and Customs Enforcement and U.S. Customs and Border Protection,

<h2 id="kissingers-legacy-still-ripples-through-asia">Kissinger’s Legacy
Still Ripples Through Asia</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Henry Kissinger will be remembered in much of the world as a foreign
policy genius who ushered China into the world community, driving a
wedge between Beijing and its Cold War ally Moscow, and eventually
transforming the world economy.</p>
<p>In Southeast Asia, the Nixon-era national security adviser and
secretary of state who died this week at age 100 is being remembered
differently.</p>
<p>The opening to China that Kissinger engineered sent a rippling effect
to Thailand, which, former Thai Prime Minister Anand Panyarachun said,
had trepidation for Communism.</p>
<p>“A lot of Thai people didn’t understand China, believing that the
communist China couldn’t be trusted,” Anand, who served as the prime
minister of Thailand from 1991 to 1992, told VOA’s Thai Service in May
when Kissinger celebrated his 100th birthday.</p>
<p>“I don’t think it was [only because of] Kissinger’s policy” toward
China but “also because of the ties between the Thai and U.S. military”
that focused on defense rather than diplomatic relations, said
Anand.</p>
<p>Architect of war strategy</p>
<p>In Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos, meanwhile, Kissinger is remembered as
the architect of a war strategy that devastated vast regions and killed
uncounted numbers of people.</p>
<p>“If we just focus on the region … Kissinger’s decisions in these
areas, no matter how brilliant he may have been, no matter how skillful
a negotiator he may have been, were disastrous for hundreds of thousands
of innocent people,” said Larry Berman, a professor emeritus at the
University of California, Davis who has written extensively on the
Vietnam War.</p>
<p>“It is where the judgment of history will be,” Berman told VOA’s
Vietnamese Service on Thursday.</p>
<p>Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos</p>
<p>The United States and its allies dropped more than 7.5 million tons
of bombs on Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia between 1965 and 1975 — twice the
amount dropped on Europe and Asia during World War II, according to the
website Storymaps.</p>
<p>At the time, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in the north, which
was supported by the Soviet Union, China and other communist countries,
was fighting the U.S.-backed Republic of Vietnam in the south.</p>
<p>Analysts say Kissinger’s policies aimed at quashing the communist
forces were responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths.</p>
<p>North Vietnam moved troops and supplies to the South via Laos on what
was known as the Ho Chi Minh trail. Kissinger and other American
officials wanted that to end.</p>
<p>From 1964-1973, the U.S. dropped 2.5 million tons of bombs on Laos,
making it the most bombed country in the world, according to Legacies of
War. Tens of thousands of people were killed.</p>
<p>The U.S. dropped an estimated 500,000 tons of bombs in Cambodia as
what began with a CIA operation in Laos expanded to Cambodia, said Erin
Lin, assistant professor of Political Science at the Ohio State
University, in her book, “When the Bombs Stopped.”</p>
<p>The bombing killed as many as 150,000 Cambodian civilians, said Yale
University historian Ben Kiernan, cited by The Washington Post.</p>
<p>In Cambodia, the bombing “enraged populace into the arms of an
insurgency that had enjoyed relatively little support until the bombing
began, setting in motion the expansion of the Vietnam War deeper into
Cambodia, a coup d’état in 1970, the rapid rise of the Khmer Rouge, and
ultimately the Cambodian genocide,” according to a Walrus magazine
article in Yale University’s genocide studies program.</p>
<p>In Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos, trained personnel, children and
farmers are still finding unexploded ordnance more than 50 years after
the last U.S. service member left Vietnam on March 29, 1973.</p>
<p>Some of it is removed by those who know how. Some of it injures or
kills the finder.</p>
<p>Ros Chantrabot, a Khmer historian and personal adviser to Hun Sen,
prime minister of Cambodia from 1985 until this year, told VOA’s Khmer
Service on Thursday that “Henry Kissinger had a huge responsibility …
for involving Cambodia in the war, which killed many people and left
many landmines in Cambodia today.”</p>
<p>“The sad reality is, he leaves this legacy which many, many
Cambodians still pay the price for,” said Sophal Ear, a Cambodian
American political scientist, to The Washington Post. “To this day,
there are people who … lose limb and life in the process of trying to
make a living in a land that has been filled with bombs.”</p>
<p>East Timor</p>
<p>Brad Simpson, professor at the University of Connecticut Department
of History, said Kissinger is also responsible for backing Indonesia’s
invasion of East Timor in 1975.</p>
<p>Indonesia said at the time that annexation of East Timor was crucial
to prevent the spread of communism.</p>
<p>Simpson told VOA’s Indonesian Service on Thursday that Kissinger
“helped to expedite the flow of weapons and military equipment to
Indonesia over the next year as it faced a determined guerrilla
resistance from armed East Timorese resistance fighters.”</p>
<p>He continued, saying, “By the time Kissinger left office in the
beginning of 1977, Indonesia had killed perhaps a tenth of the
population of East Timor.” At the time, the population was 619,308,
according to the World Bank.</p>
<p>The Indonesian invasion led to a long and bloody occupation of the
territory that ended only after an international peacekeeping force was
introduced in 1999 and as many as 200,000 people had died, according to
National Security Archive Electronic Briefing Book No. 62.</p>
<p>The Korean Service, Khmer Service, Vietnamese Service, Indonesian
Service and Thai Service contributed to this report.</p>
