## Chinese Pastor Released After 7 Years in Prison, Unable to Get ID

date: 2024-03-23, from: VOA News USA

beijing — Unable to buy a train ticket, or even see a doctor at a hospital, a Chinese pastor found that his even after release from prison, he is not quite free. 


The Rev. John Sanqiang Cao was arrested and sentenced to seven years in prison while coming back from a missionary trip in Myanmar. Now back in his hometown of Changsha in southern Hunan province, he is without any legal documentation in his country, unable to access even the most basic services without Chinese identification. 


"I told them I'm a second-(class) Chinese citizen, I cannot do this, I cannot do that," Cao in an interview with The Associated Press. "I'm released, I'm a free citizen, why should there be so many restrictions upon me?" 


Cao, who was born and raised in Changsha, had dedicated his life to spreading Christianity in China, where the religion is strictly regulated. He had studied in the U.S., married an American woman and started a family, but said he felt a calling to go back to his home country and spread the faith. 


It's a risky mission. Christianity in China is allowed only in state-sponsored churches, where the ruling Communist Party decides how Scripture should be interpreted. Anything else, including clandestine "house" churches and unofficial Bible schools, is considered illegal, though it was once tolerated by local officials. 


Cao was undeterred, citing the courage of Chinese Christians he had met who spent time in prison for their faith. During his years in China, he said he had set up some 50 Bible study schools across the country. 


In the years leading up to his arrest, he had started bringing Chinese missionaries to parts of northern Myanmar that had been impacted by the country's civil war. They focused on relief work, campaigning against drug use, and setting up schools in areas bordering China. 


It was in coming back from one of these crossings that he was detained in 2017. He was sentenced to seven years on a charge of "organizing others to illegally cross the border," which is usually reserved for human traffickers. 


His family and supporters advocated for Cao's sentence to be reduced, but to no avail. Cao was a prisoner of conscience, according to the federal U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, which also called for his freedom. 


After completing his sentence, Cao is no longer behind bars. But he is facing another major obstacle. 


He said that police who came to his mother's house in 2006 took away her "hukou" registration book, which had also included Cao. 


Every child born in China is registered in the hukou, which is an identification system through which social benefits are allocated by geography. Later in life, the hukou is needed to apply for a national ID card, which is used in everything from getting a phone number to public health insurance. 


According to Cao, police said they would help his mother update the hukou. It was only later that he found out in updating her registration that they removed his name. 


Cao never took American citizenship because of his calling, spending his time between the two countries. He had kept his U.S. permanent residency throughout this time, though he says that's not accepted as an ID in China. 


He was traveling on his Chinese passport. Though he noted that he no longer had the hukou registration, he did not realize how serious the problem was until much later. 


In prison, his Chinese passport had expired, he said, and he could not renew it. 


Cao said he has been to the police station many times since his release and had even hired a lawyer. So far, he said police had not given him a satisfactory answer as to why his records no longer exist. 


A police officer at the Dingwangtai police station in Changsha, where Cao's hukou registration is supposed to be, said he did not know how to address Cao's claims. "Even if he went to prison, he should still have a hukou," he told the AP. The officer refused to give his name because he wasn't authorized to talk to the media. 


Cao's two adult sons were able to visit him this month, spending two weeks with their father. Cao said he wants to join them and his wife in the U.S., though it's unclear how he can do that. 


"I moved from a smaller prison ... to come to a bigger prison," he said.

## 2 Crew Members Die During Holland America Cruise Ship 'Incident'

date: 2024-03-23, from: VOA News USA

FORT LAUDERDALE, Florida — Two crew members on a Holland America cruise ship died during an "incident" in the ship's engineering space, the cruise line said. 


The unidentified crew members died Friday while the Florida-based Nieuw Amsterdam was at Half Moon Cay in the Bahamas, Holland America said in a statement. 


Authorities were notified and the cause of the accident is being investigated, the cruise line said. Crew members were being offered counseling. 


"All of us at Holland America Line are deeply saddened by this incident and our thoughts and prayers are with our team members' families at this difficult time," the statement said. "The safety, security and welfare of all guests and crew are the company's absolute priority." 


The cruise line did not offer any further details about the crew members. It later said the Bahamas Maritime Authority was leading the investigation. The ship set sail out of Fort Lauderdale on March 16 for a seven-night trip.

## Some personal news

date: 2024-03-23, from: OS News

I&#8217;ve got two bits of related news that will affect the future of OSNews. The first bit of news kind of led to the second bit of news. You don&#8217;t have to care much about former, but the latter will be important for where OSNews will be going from here on out. First, after 14 years, I&#8217;ve effectively quit my job as a translator &#8211; I am self-employed so there&#8217;s no dramatic clearing of my desk of being led out by security, which is probably a little bit of a letdown to some of you. The translation industry is in the process of collapsing &#8211; you know why &#8211; and I&#8217;ve been feeling the squeeze for a while now, and I like going out on my own terms. I&#8217;ve known this day would come, and I&#8217;m not sad about it. My motto: it is what it is. Of course, this meant I had to think of what to do next. Well, I have decided to work on OSNews full-time. This is risky, scary, and I&#8217;m absolutely terrified of what this will mean. Right now, my OSNews income &#8211; ads plus Patreon &#8211; does not even remotely come close to what I earned as a translator, and as any translator will tell you, translating isn&#8217;t exactly a cornucopia either. This means I&#8217;ve got some serious work ahead of me to change that. After talking things over with David, OSNews&#8217; owner who takes care of the commercial/advertisement side, we&#8217;ve already taken a few steps. First, we&#8217;ve switched hosting providers and saved considerably on our hosting costs in the process. Second, David changed advertising partners to one that will most likely yield us some better rates, but since I don&#8217;t know much about that side of OSNews &#8211; as it should be &#8211; I can&#8217;t comment much on it. There are two main ways in which I can increase OSNews&#8217; revenue, and that is by growing our readership, and by giving people more reasons to become a Patreon, make individual donations, or buy our merch. In other words, you can expect more original articles so that people will want to keep coming back, and possibly support me financially because they like what I do. A third avenue for revenue I&#8217;m exploring is sponsorships &#8211; this is a longer-term project, and I&#8217;m approaching and talking to several (tech) companies about this. If you happen to work for a company who would be a good fit for an OSNews weekly sponsorship, feel free to contact me for more information. The end goal: have OSNews be entirely funded by readers and sponsors, and remove all regular advertising. This all sounds great, but there is a dark side to this news, too. If all of this fails, if I am unable to attract more readers and make my work for OSNews financially sustainable, I&#8217;ll have to find work elsewhere &#8211; and that would mean the end of OSNews. I&#8217;m not trying to be alarmist or scare you; I just want to be as honest and realistic as possible about where we stand. Anyway, this is a big deal for me. I&#8217;ve really only ever had one job, and that&#8217;s being a translator, a job I am trained for with two university degrees to show for it. My only other job was a teenage thing where I worked at a hardware store (think hammers and screws, not computers) for eight years. I don&#8217;t like taking risks with these sorts of matters, so I&#8217;m absolutely terrified, and while I believe there&#8217;s a sustainable income hiding in this ol&#8217; website, it&#8217;s not always clear how to get at it. Anyway, want to become a Patreon? Or a sponsor? Pretty please? Now would be kind of a really good time to do so.

## Arrests for Illegal Border Crossings Up in February, Among Lowest of Biden Term

date: 2024-03-23, from: VOA News USA

washington — The number of arrests for illegally crossing the U.S. southern border with Mexico nudged upward February over the previous month. But at a time when immigration is increasingly a concern for voters, the numbers were still among the lowest of Joe Biden's presidency. 


According to figures from Customs and Border Protection, Border Patrol agents made 140,644 arrests of people attempting to enter the country between the legal border crossing points during February. 


The figures are part of a range of data related to immigration, trade and fentanyl seizures that is released monthly by CBP. The immigration-related figures are a closely watched metric at a time of intense political scrutiny over who is entering the country and whether the Biden administration has a handle on the issue. 


Republicans have charged that Biden's policies have encouraged migrants to attempt to come to the U.S. and that the border is out of control. The Biden administration counters that Republicans failed to work with Democrats to fund a key border security bill and argues that what is happening on the southern border is part of a worldwide phenomenon of more people fleeing their homes to seek safety. 


The numbers come after a December that saw the Border Patrol tally 249,785 arrests — a record that increased tensions over immigration — before the numbers plunged in January to 124,220. 


Officials have credited enforcement efforts by Mexico as well as seasonal fluctuations that affect when and where migrants attempt to cross the border for the drop from December to January and February. 


Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said during a February 29 trip to Brownsville, Texas, with Biden that the "primary reason is the enhanced enforcement efforts on the part of the Mexican government." But he said encounters remained up in Arizona in part because Sonora, which is the Mexican state directly south of Arizona, is difficult to patrol. 


In February, the Tucson sector in Arizona was by far the busiest region for migrant crossings between the ports of entry, followed by San Diego and El Paso, Texas. 


Separately, 42,100 migrants used an app called CBP One to schedule an appointment to present themselves at an official border crossing point to seek entry into the United States. 


The app has been a key part of the Biden administration's efforts to reduce chaos at the border by encouraging migrants to wait for an appointment instead of wading through the river or trekking across the desert and seeking Border Patrol agents to turn themselves in. 


The administration has also allowed 30,000 people a month into the country from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela using the administration's humanitarian parole authority. The migrants must have a financial sponsor in the U.S. and fly into an American airport. According to the data released Friday, 386,000 people from those four countries have been admitted to the country since that program was announced in January 2023.

## THE ZONE OF SHAME

Here is a piece I wrote for the New Statesman recently. It is self-explanatory. Jonathan Glazer&#8217;s profoundly subtle and disturbing film, The Zone of Interest, no sooner won an Oscar for Best International Feature than its director delivered an apology for his Jewishness so grovelling in its emotional simplicity it would have made the angels &#8211; of any religion &#8211; weep.

## Growth is a mind cancer

date: 2024-03-23, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>I'm following with somewhat vague interest the various legal battles Apple is currently involved in. Reading their response to the EU's DMA makes me sad. Not for the company itself. I honestly could not care less about the company. Nor for the people who run that company. I'm sad because the pursuit of endless growth is such a mind cancer. It consumes and distracts everyone. If you're an artisan, creating amazing objects is your end goal. Ideally, you want those objects to last forever. And if they don't, you want to do such an amazing job that once something is broken beyond repair, people will come to you again and ask you to make something new, rather than buying from someone else.</p>
<p>Apple makes amazing products. I bought the laptop I'm typing this 9 years ago. It still works fine. Sure, it's slow compared to my new machine but I can use it to do calls and write blog posts. And that's great. I love it. I was happy to give Apple my money back in 2015. But you know who's not happy? Apple. Apple is not happy that I bought a laptop in 2015 that was so good that it is still working fine 9 years later. And it's also not happy that I bought a phone more than 4 years ago that still does all the things I need it to do. Because they need to make money. More money. There's no end state here. <em>"More"</em> has no end state. At some point, a company like Apple will inevitably run out of people willing to buy their stuff. Because it's unreasonable to expect people to upgrade phones, laptops, screens, watches, tablets, virtual-ski-goggles every damn year. And so what do they do? They move into services. Music, movies, games, fitness, storage. You name it. But those also can't grow forever. Because guess what? There are other companies out there doing the same.</p>
<p>But they can't stop. They're a public company. If they're not growing enough it means they're failing. Forget that they make amazing products that can last decades with no issues. Forget that they're an almost 3-fucking-trillions dollar company. If they're not growing enough, stock goes down and that's no good. Because remember, there's no finish line here. They can't just be happy with their size. They can't be happy with the idea of employing thousands of smart people and creating amazing products. No, they have to keep growing. And sooner or later, this mind cancer becomes malignant.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, this is not just an Apple issue. It's an issue with any big company. It's an issue with everyone who can't accept that they reached their end state.</p>
<p>Cory Doctorow famously coined the enshittification term to describe the sad trend of online services going to shit over time. I don't think that's just an online services issue. It's a societal issue related to the pursuit of endless growth. And if you think about it, it's a deeply human issue. It's what happens when you can't say stop. No matter what you're doing, it can be something positive or negative, if you can't say stop, bad things will happen. Try to go for a run, and don't stop. Ever. Or try to drink water, and don't stop. Ever.</p>
<p>But it's our fault. Our as a society. We celebrate when Apple becomes the first trillion-dollar company but we don't celebrate when someone says <em>"You know what? I think I have enough"</em>.</p>                <hr>

## US Mega Millions Jackpot Climbs to $1.1B

date: 2024-03-23, from: VOA News USA

DES MOINES, Iowa — The Mega Millions jackpot climbed to an estimated $1.1 billion after no one matched the game's six numbers Friday night, continuing a stretch of more than three months without a big winner. 


The numbers drawn were: 3, 8, 31, 35, 44, 16. 


The jackpot increased after a drawing for an estimated $977 million failed to produce a jackpot winner. 


No one has won the game's jackpot since December 8, a string of 30 consecutive drawings without anyone taking home the top prize. That has enabled the jackpot to slowly grow, week after week. 


The $1.1 billion prize is for a sole winner who chooses to be paid through an annuity over 30 years. Winners almost always opt for a cash payment, which for the next drawing Tuesday night is an estimated $525.8 million. 


A lucky player winning the $1.1 billion jackpot would take home the eighth largest in U.S. lottery history. 


The other U.S. lottery game, Powerball, has grown to an annuity jackpot of $750 million and a cash payout of $357.3 million. The next Powerball drawing is scheduled to take place Saturday night.

## Doctorow on the antitrust case against Apple

date: 2024-03-23, from: OS News

The foundational tenet of &#8220;the Cult of Mac&#8221; is that buying products from a $3t company makes you a member of an oppressed ethnic minority and therefore every criticism of that corporation is an ethnic slur. Call it &#8220;Apple exceptionalism&#8221; – the idea that Apple, alone among the Big Tech firms, is virtuous, and therefore its conduct should be interpreted through that lens of virtue. The wellspring of this virtue is conveniently nebulous, which allows for endless goal-post shifting by members of the Cult of Mac when Apple&#8217;s sins are made manifest. ↫ Cory Doctorow An absolutely brilliant response to the DoJ lawsuit from Cory Doctorow. You notice this &#8220;Apple exceptionalism&#8221; a lot right now because of the new laws in the EU and now the lawsuit by the US DoJ. Apple products being better is posited as a fact, a law of the universe, and as such, any claims, either through lawsuits or legislation, that Apple is doing something wrong, illegal, or anticompetitive are by definition false. Things that, according to them, make Apple products &#8220;superior&#8221; can simply not be illegal. You also notice this a lot when it comes to the existence of Android. People who don&#8217;t like being locked in or have issues with Apple&#8217;s behaviour can just switch to Android, right? The thought that there are real, monetary costs to switching from iOS to Android &#8211; costs driven up by Apple&#8217;s very behaviour &#8211; is irrelevant to them, because in the eyes of the tech pundit, everyone&#8217;s rich. What we&#8217;ll be discovering over the course of the DoJ lawsuit &#8211; a course that will take us years &#8211; is that the general public cares a lot less about Apple as a company than Apple tech pundits think it does. People have iPhones not because they love Apple, but because their previous phone was an iPhone, because of network effects, or a bit of both. I doubt the average (in this case) American gives a rat&#8217;s ass about Apple, and are much more worried about the fact they have to live paycheck-to-paycheck in a dysfunctional shell of a democracy while being told the economy is doing just great.

This blogroll is much like the one I had in the 00s, but it's in motion, and it's a source of news and ideas. It's also doing the thing that Twitter used to do, it lets me have a way to see what specific people are interested in. I expect more of that as new people get this kind of blogroll. Right now I'm pretty much the only one. The next step is getting the blogroll running in WordPress. And then getting it running on <a href="https://om.co/">Om's blog</a> and <a href="https://doc.searls.com/">Doc's blog</a>, both of whom have real experience with the art of blogrolling. From that, I expect to have a better idea of what the editorial UI should look like for people creating and managing these blogrolls. We'll iterate until it's pretty easy to set up and manage one. Also to be clear, I want it to run in other platforms, this is not exclusive to WordPress. It's just the place where the people are right now, the ones I really want to work with. But I wouldn't mind it running in <a href="https://substack.com/">Substack</a> for example, if there are any writers there who find this compelling. That would require cooperation from the company though, their platform as far as I know, does not support other-party plugins.

## ‘Even stronger’ than imagined: DOJ’s sweeping Apple lawsuit draws expert praise

date: 2024-03-23, from: OS News

The Department of Justice’s antitrust division has come into its own, having filed its third tech monopoly lawsuit in four years. The accumulated experience shows up in the complaint, according to antitrust experts who spoke with The Verge about the complaint filed Thursday accusing Apple of violating antitrust law. The DOJ describes a sweeping arc of behaviors by Apple, arguing that it adds up to a pattern of illegal monopoly maintenance. Rather than focusing on two or three illegal acts, the complaint alleges that Apple engages in a pattern of behaviors that further entrench consumers into their ecosystem and make it harder to switch, even in the face of high prices and degraded quality. ↫ Lauren Feiner at The Verge It&#8217;s been somewhat entertaining seeing Apple fanatics claim the complaint is bad, horrible, has no merit, has no chance in court, and that the DoJ has zero clue what it&#8217;s doing &#8211; while actual experts are actually positively surprised by how the complaint seems better than they expected. I wonder whose judgement to trust more.

## Feds ordered Google to unmask certain YouTube users. Critics say it’s ‘terrifying.’

date: 2024-03-23, from: OS News

Federal investigators have ordered Google to provide information on all viewers of select YouTube videos, according to multiple court orders obtained by Forbes. Privacy experts from multiple civil rights groups told Forbes they think the orders are unconstitutional because they threaten to turn innocent YouTube viewers into criminal suspects. ↫ Thomas Brewster at Forbes United States law enforcement has been asking Google who watches certain YouTube videos, covering as many as 30,000 people per video. They wanted names, addresses, telephone numbers and user activity for all Google accounts who had watched a video within a certain week&#8217;s timeframe, and the IP addresses of everyone who watched the video without a Google account. That&#8217;s an absolute crapton of data, all because they suspected one person of a money-laundering scheme. And this is just one example. Forbes could not determine if Google complied with the requests, but it does highlight the dangers of having so much data on one place.

## Atari Falcon030: impressive, but too late to the party

date: 2024-03-23, from: OS News

So looking back, it is obvious that neither Atari or Commodore would really be able to succeed in the long-term, although perhaps one of them could have become the 3rd “also-ran”. For a while, Atari really thought they could be that third choice and some of their late-model computers have some impressive innovations. With that preamble over with, let’s talk about the last Atari computer: the Falcon030. ↫ Paul Lefebvre In my mind, Atari is a game and console company, not a computer company &#8211; I don&#8217;t have any sale figures, but I feel like the Atari general computers weren&#8217;t quite as popular in The Netherlands as they were in some other places.

## Picotron: a fantasy workstation for making pixelart games, animations, music, demos and other curiosities

date: 2024-03-23, from: OS News

Picotron is a Fantasy Workstation for making pixelart games, animations, music, demos and other curiosities. It has a toy operating system designed to be a cosy creative space, but runs on top of Windows, MacOS or Linux. Picotron apps can be made with built-in tools, and shared with other users in a special 256k png cartridge format. ↫ Picotron website Picotron is very similar to PICO-8, but more powerful and with a few additional features &#8211; it&#8217;s actually made by the same people as PICO-8. It also contains a small, &#8216;toy&#8217; operating system to serve as a workspace, everything makes use of Lua, and any applications made with it can be shared using a special 256k PNG cartridge format. It&#8217;s currently in alpha, and cost $11.99, and uses the early Minecraft model of a one-time purchase for access to all future updates. The FAQ has tons more information. It looks incredibly neat. I don&#8217;t have much use for it, but I&#8217;m interested to see what people with actual skills will make with it.

## Biden Signs $1.2 Trillion Budget Measure

date: 2024-03-23, from: VOA News USA

WILMINGTON, Delaware — President Joe Biden on Saturday signed a $1.2 trillion package of spending bills after Congress passed the long overdue legislation just hours earlier, ending the threat of a partial government shutdown.


“This agreement represents a compromise, which means neither side got everything it wanted,” Biden said in a statement. “But it rejects extreme cuts from House Republicans and expands access to child care, invests in cancer research, funds mental health and substance use care, advances American leadership abroad, and provides resources to secure the border. ... That’s good news for the American people.”


It took lawmakers six months into the current budget year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term spending bills to keep agencies funded.


The White House said Biden signed the legislation at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where he was spending the weekend. It cleared the Senate by a 74-24 vote shortly after funding expired for the agencies at midnight.


But the White House sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing that the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the Democratic president would sign it Saturday.


The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies. The second covered the departments of Defense, Homeland Security and State, as well as other aspects of general government.


When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country’s rising debt.


On Ukraine aid, which Biden and his administration have argued was critical and necessary to help stop Russia’s invasion, the package provided $300 million under the defense spending umbrella. That funding is separate from a large assistance package for Ukraine and Israel that is bogged down on Capitol Hill.


Biden, in his statement, again pressed Congress to pass additional aid.


“The House must pass the bipartisan national security supplemental to advance our national security interests. And Congress must pass the bipartisan border security agreement — the toughest and fairest reforms in decades — to ensure we have the policies and funding needed to secure the border. It’s time to get this done.”


A bipartisan border package collapsed last month when Republican senators scuttled months of negotiations with Democrats on legislation intended to cut back record numbers of illegal border crossings.




To win over support from Republicans, House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson pointed to some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That’s about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.


Democrats are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer’s research.


The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy of California worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.


Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. But shortly before midnight, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced a breakthrough.


“It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it," Schumer said.


The House passed the legislation Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval.


The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though most Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill “represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.”


In a sign of the conservative frustration, Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove McCarthy.


The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

## 100 Iconic Washington Cherry Trees To Be Cut Down, Including 'Stumpy'

date: 2024-03-23, from: VOA News USA

washington — The sun is setting on Stumpy, the gnarled old cherry tree that has become a social media phenom. This year's cherry blossom festivities in Washington will be the last for Stumpy and more than 100 other cherry trees that will be cut down as part of a multiyear restoration of their Tidal Basin home.


Starting in early summer, crews will begin working to replace the crumbling seawall around the Tidal Basin, the area around the Jefferson Memorial with the highest concentration of cherry trees. The work has been long overdue, as the deterioration, combined with rising sea levels, has resulted in Potomac waters regularly surging over the barriers.


The twice-daily floods at high tide not only cover some of the pedestrian paths, they regularly soak some of the cherry trees' roots. The $133 million project to rebuild and reinforce the sea wall will take about three years, said Mike Litterst, National Park Service spokesperson for the National Mall.


"It's certainly going to benefit the visitor experience, and that's very important to us," Litterst said. "But most of all, it's going to benefit the cherry trees, who right now are every day, twice a day, seeing their roots inundated with the brackish water of the Tidal Basin." Litterst said entire stretches of trees to the water, as wide as 100 yards, or 90 meters, have been lost and can't be replaced "until we fix the underlying cause of what killed them in the first place."




Stumpy still alive


Stumpy remains alive, if in rough shape.


Plans call for 140 cherry trees — and 300 trees total — to be removed and turned into mulch. When the project is concluded, 277 cherry trees will be planted as replacements.


The mulch will protect the roots of surviving trees from foot traffic and break down over time into nutrient-rich soil, "so it's a good second life" for the trees being cut down, Litterst said.


The National Cherry Blossom Festival is widely considered to be the start of the tourist season in the nation's capital. Organizers expect 1.5 million people to view the pink and white blossoms this year, the most since the coronavirus pandemic. Large numbers of cherry blossom fans have already been drawn to the area as the trees entered peak bloom on March 17, several days earlier than expected.


Tree becomes social star


Stumpy became a social media star during the pandemic of 2020. Its legacy has spawned T-shirts, a calendar and a fanbase. News of Stumpy's final spring has prompted people to leave flowers and bourbon and had one Reddit user threatening to chain themselves to the trunk to save the tree.


The good news on Stumpy is that the National Arboretum plans to take parts of the tree's genetic material and create clones, some of which will eventually be replanted at the Tidal Basin.


The regular flooding at the Tidal Basin — sea levels have risen about a foot since the the seawall was built in the early 1990s — is just one of the ways climate change has impacted the cherry trees. Rising global temperatures and warmer winters have caused peak bloom to creep earlier in the calendar.


This year's peak bloom, when 70% of the city's 3,700 cherry trees will be flowering, was originally predicted to start around Saturday but ended up being declared on March 17. By comparison, the 2013 peak bloom began on April 9.


Leslie Frattaroli, national resources program manager for the Park Service, told The Associated Press in February that peak bloom could regularly come in the middle of March by 2050.


"All the timing is off." he said. "It's a huge cascading effect."


Another weather side effect: A mid-March cold snap in the D.C. area should actually extend this year's bloom past the predicted April 9 ending.


For visitors and cherry blossom enthusiasts, the annual tradition of a stroll on the Tidal Basin under the flowers is a core Washington experience.




Jorge and Sandra Perez make a point of coming every year from Stafford, Virginia.


"Yes, we have cherry blossoms in my community, but it's a completely different feel when you see all of them bloom together," Sandra Perez said. "And you can walk through, you know, the trees under it and smell it. And it's just, it's a beautiful view."


They also came looking for Stumpy, having heard the legend and knowing this would be its final spring.


"It's actually beautiful," Jorge Perez said. "So, it's sad to see him leave."

As expected, Trump&#8217;s team has reorganized the Republican National Committee&#8217;s donation system, arranging for maximum donations to go first to Trump&#8217;s presidential campaign, then to Trump&#8217;s Save America political action committee, and finally to the RNC to elect down ballot candidates. The Save America PAC pays Trump&#8217;s legal bills. So far in 2024 it has spent $8.5 million on them. In essence, this new flow means Trump is using the RNC to raise money that is then diverted to him.

## US Says It Struck 3 Houthi Underground Storage Sites in Yemen

date: 2024-03-23, from: VOA News USA

Washington — The U.S. military said Friday it had struck three underground storage facilities used by Yemen's Houthis, as the Iran-backed rebels continue to launch attacks on shipping in the Red Sea.


U.S. forces "conducted self-defense strikes against three Houthi underground storage facilities in Iranian-backed Houthi terrorist-controlled areas of Yemen," Central Command (CENTCOM) said in a statement.


It said U.S. forces had also "successfully engaged and destroyed four unmanned aerial vehicles" in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen throughout Friday, while also registering four anti-ship ballistic missiles fired by the Houthis toward the Red Sea.


"There were no injuries or damage reported by U.S., coalition, or commercial ships," CENTCOM said.


The Houthis began attacking ships in the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea in November, a campaign they say is intended to signal solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.


They have vowed to target Israeli, British and American ships, as well as vessels heading to Israeli ports, disrupting traffic through the vital trade route off Yemen's coasts.


The attacks have sent insurance costs spiraling for vessels transiting the Red Sea and prompted many shipping firms to take the far longer passage around the southern tip of Africa instead.

## With Recent Headlines About Gear Falling Off Planes, Is Flying Safe?

date: 2024-03-23, from: VOA News USA

DALLAS — It has been 15 years since the last fatal crash of a U.S. airliner, but you would never know that by reading about a torrent of flight problems in the last three months.


There was a time when things like cracked windshields and minor engine problems didn't turn up very often in the news.


That changed in January, when a panel plugging the space reserved for an unused emergency door blew off an Alaska Airlines jetliner 16,000 feet above Oregon. Pilots landed the Boeing 737 Max safely, but in the United States, media coverage of the flight quickly overshadowed a deadly runway crash in Tokyo three days earlier.


And concern about air safety — especially with Boeing planes — has not let up.


Is flying getting more dangerous?


By the simplest measurement, the answer is no. The last deadly crash involving a U.S. airliner occurred in February 2009, an unprecedented streak of safety. There were 9.6 million flights last year.


The lack of fatal crashes does not fully capture the state of safety, however. In the past 15 months, a spate of close calls caught the attention of regulators and travelers.


Another measure is the number of times pilots broadcast an emergency call to air traffic controllers. Flightradar24, a popular tracking site, just compiled the numbers. The site's data show such calls rising since mid-January but remaining below levels seen during much of 2023.


Emergency calls also are an imperfect gauge: the plane might not have been in immediate danger, and sometimes planes in trouble never alert controllers.


Safer than driving


The National Safety Council estimates that Americans have a 1-in-93 chance of dying in a motor-vehicle crash, while deaths on airplanes are too rare to calculate the odds. Figures from the U.S. Department of Transportation tell a similar story.


"This is the safest form of transportation ever created, whereas every day on the nation's roads about a 737 full of people dies," Richard Aboulafia, a longtime aerospace analyst and consultant, said. The safety council estimates that more than 44,000 people died in U.S. vehicle crashes in 2023.


But a shrinking safety margin


A panel of experts reported in November that a shortage of air traffic controllers, outdated plane-tracking technology and other problems presented a growing threat to safety in the sky.


"The current erosion in the margin of safety in the (national airspace system) caused by the confluence of these challenges is rendering the current level of safety unsustainable," the group said in a 52-page report.




What is going on at Boeing?


Many but not all of the recent incidents have involved Boeing planes.


Boeing is a $78 billion company, a leading U.S. exporter and a century-old, iconic name in aircraft manufacturing. It is one-half of the duopoly, along with Europe's Airbus, that dominates the production of large passenger jets.


The company's reputation, however, was greatly damaged by the crashes of two 737 Max jets — one in Indonesia in 2018, the other in Ethiopia the following year — that killed 346 people. Boeing has lost nearly $24 billion in the last five years. It has struggled with manufacturing flaws that at times delayed deliveries of 737s and long-haul 787 Dreamliners.


Boeing finally was beginning to regain its stride until the Alaska Airlines Max blowout. Investigators have focused on bolts that help secure the door-plug panel, but which were missing after a repair job at the Boeing factory.


The FBI is notifying passengers about a criminal investigation. The Federal Aviation Administration is stepping up oversight of the company.


"What is going on with the production at Boeing? There have been issues in the past. They don't seem to be getting resolved," FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said last month.


CEO David Calhoun says no matter what conclusions investigators reach about the Alaska Airlines blowout, "Boeing is accountable for what happened" on the Alaska plane. "We caused the problem and we understand that."


Where do design and manufacturing fit in?


Problems attributed to an airplane manufacturer can differ greatly.


Some are design errors. On the original Boeing Max, the failure of a single sensor caused a flight-control system to point the nose of the plane down with great force — that happened before the deadly 2018 and 2019 Max crashes. It is a maxim in aviation that the failure of a single part should never be enough to bring down a plane.


In other cases, such as the door-plug panel that flew off the Alaska Airlines jet, it appears a mistake was made on the factory floor.


"Anything that results in death is worse, but design is a lot harder to deal with because you have to locate the problem and fix it," said Aboulafia, the aerospace analyst. "In the manufacturing process, the fix is incredibly easy – don't do" whatever caused the flaw in the first place.


Manufacturing quality appears to be an issue in other incidents too.


Earlier this month, the FAA proposed ordering airlines to inspect wiring bundles around the spoilers on Max jets. The order was prompted by a report that chafing of electrical wires due to faulty installation caused an airliner to roll 30 degrees in less than a second on a 2021 flight.


Even little things matter. After a LATAM Airlines Boeing 787 flying from Australia to New Zealand this month went into a nosedive — it recovered — Boeing reminded airlines to inspect switches to motors that move pilot seats. Published reports said a flight attendant accidentally hitting the switch likely caused the plunge.


Not everything is Boeing's fault


Investigations into some incidents point to likely lapses in maintenance, and many close calls are due to errors by pilots or air traffic controllers.


This week, investigators disclosed that an American Airlines jet that overshot a runway in Texas had undergone a brake-replacement job four days earlier, and some hydraulic lines to the brakes were not properly reattached.


Earlier this month, a tire fell off a United Airlines Boeing 777 leaving San Francisco, and an American Airlines 777 made an emergency landing in Los Angeles with a flat tire.


A piece of the aluminum skin was discovered missing when a United Boeing 737 landed in Oregon last week. Unlike the brand-new Alaska jet that suffered the panel blowout, the United plane was 26 years old. Maintenance is up to the airline.


When a FedEx cargo plane landing last year in Austin, Texas, flew close over the top of a departing Southwest Airlines jet, it turned out that an air traffic controller had cleared both planes to use the same runway.


Separating serious from routine


Aviation-industry officials say the most concerning events involve issues with flight controls, engines and structural integrity.


Other things such as cracked windshields and planes clipping each other at the airport rarely pose a safety threat. Warnings lights might indicate a serious problem or a false alarm.


"We take every event seriously," former NTSB member John Goglia said, citing such vigilance as a contributor to the current crash-free streak. "The challenge we have in aviation is trying to keep it there."

## Broken images suck, Google

date: 2024-03-23, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><img src="https://noimage.com/nosuchimage.png" width="105" height="105" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="5">Something the HTTPS evangelists must not understand: there's substantial breakage when you convert an HTTP site to HTTPS. Every image in every page breaks. Broken images make a <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/22/statement.png">statement</a>, they're like broken windows, they say no one gives a F about this site. Well I care about the archive of scripting.com, I hope people understand that. I have been creating a record here since 1994. It'll be 30 years in October.</p>
<p>Instead of trying to blackmail me into breaking my archive, Google should be helping to preserve it. And not just mine, the entire early web. We poured our hearts and hopes into this, and massive amounts of time, without which Google would not exist.  </p>
<p>I know Google doesn't have a heart and it isn't a living thing, but it's bad PR to make that so freaking obvious. </p>
<p>I think that perhaps Google is already run by the machines. Maybe it was the first such company. </p>
<p>To remind you of what Google's idea of the ancient web is, I put a broken image next to this post. </p>

## 2024-03-23 The end of capitalism

date: 2024-03-23, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-03-23-the-end-of-capitalism">2024-03-23 The end of capitalism</h1>

<p>A few days ago, I saw a toot claiming that capitalism was the natural state of being since the world just wasn’t altruistic, that is just the way things are.</p>

<p>I… I don’t know where to start. The entire idea that production is part of a natural state is bonkers. Nobody else purchases things. What about other non-altruistic systems like dictatorships, slavery, feudalism, we have so much choice in terrible solutions… and what a strange reaction in face of one’s lack of imagination to just lie down and give up instead of insisting on human ingenuity and demanding that we do better.</p>

<p>If you ever see anybody say anything about the natural state, the first thing is to ask: are they a philosopher? A biologist? Or are they an economist? Or a haver of opinions?</p>

<p>These are not alike.</p>

<p>I love philosophy enough to have read a few books and I spent four years studying biology in the last millennium. I&rsquo;m a master of science in biology. Homo sapiens survived at least 49500 years without capitalism and now we&rsquo;ve had 500 years of capitalism max – that doesn’t sound like a natural state, from my biologist perspective. There are a lot of extra factors that are required for capitalism to flourish.</p>

<p>Modern humans appeared about 300,000 years ago. Cultural developments started speeding up 40,000 years ago. Agriculture started about 10,000 years ago. Writing started about 6000 years ago. Mercantilism started about 400 years ago.</p>

<p>I also don&rsquo;t think that capitalism &ldquo;evolved&rdquo; naturally. As a biologist, the word &ldquo;evolve&rdquo; is even more tricky than the word &ldquo;natural&rdquo;. When the word &ldquo;evolved&rdquo; is used like in evolutionary biology, then I have questions about the applicability of the concept to the development of an economic system. It is not clear to me how this can work without using it metaphorically. To compare an economic system with anything that has evolved without genes (DNA or RNA, chromosomes, and so on) is to use the word metaphorically.</p>

<p>My point is about the use of the word &ldquo;natural&rdquo; in an argument supporting the existence of capitalism. Using the word &ldquo;natural&rdquo; is extremely problematic. It usually raises more questions than it solves. The examples I gave above illustrate that many aspects of capitalism don&rsquo;t exist in nature without humans. No animal has means of production that allow them to exploit the labour of other creatures to increase their capital and thus allow them to increase their means of production. Thus, there is nothing &ldquo;natural&rdquo; about capitalism.</p>

<p>Or perhaps one would be tempted to argue that anything related to humans is natural for humans, and therefore capitalism is a natural thing for humans to engage in? But then all the alternative economic system are just as natural: slavery empires, feudalism – all of it natural? Or maybe the word &ldquo;natural&rdquo; would become unusable when used in this way since it would no longer add anything to the conversation.</p>

<p>My point is also about there being a lot of other political systems that are bad, that satisfy the condition of fitting a world that&rsquo;s &ldquo;not altruistic&rdquo;. These other political systems held for centuries, such as monarchies, feudalism, slavery empires and the like. So &ldquo;natural&rdquo; cannot be used to describe a tendency towards something so comparatively short-lived as capitalism. We spent many more years doing all these other evil economic systems and all of them at one point seemed &ldquo;natural&rdquo; in the metaphorical sense, at the time, for a long time.</p>

<p>In order to argue that capitalism was the natural end-point of an &ldquo;evolution&rdquo; is to argue like Hegel, Marx, or Fukuyama, it seems to me – except that now it&rsquo;s capitalism that&rsquo;s the stable end-state, instead of Prussia, communism or democracy. And if it isn&rsquo;t the inevitable end, then that&rsquo;s exactly what I&rsquo;ve been trying to say: the use of the word &ldquo;natural&rdquo; in this context is bogus.</p>

<p>To have capitalism is at most a choice or maybe the result of external conditions. If the oil dries up, if the energy no longer flows, if famine comes back, then other economic systems might rise again. We might revert to theocracy or to feudalism or to slavery empires.</p>

<p>My claim is that there&rsquo;s no natural progression, there are just external factors that currently benefit capitalism. And of course evil people will be able to take advantage of power structures, no matter which economic system a society uses.</p>

<p>And one day the conditions will no longer be right and capitalism will end, not with a bang but with a whimper. When the economy crumbles to dust and we&rsquo;re thrown back into the conditions of the 15th century, there will be no more capitalism. The sword will once again be mightier than the coin.</p>

<p>Or maybe – and here I&rsquo;ll allow myself to dream – we might yet find another solution so that we can all inhabit this earth without torturing each other to death.</p>

## Transparent Superconductors for Single-photon Detectors

date: 2024-03-22, from: NASA breaking news

Manuel Quevedo-Lopez University Of Texas, Dallas ESI23 Quevedo-Lopez Quadchart.pdf Current SNSPD’s use a thin, superconducting film to detect photons. These films are highly reflective and must be made very thin, on the order of a few nanometers, in order to allow light to interact with their entire thickness.

## Time for some tea… vee

date: 2024-03-22, from: RiscOS Story

Rick Murray recently pranked readers of the RISC OS Open Ltd (ROOL) forums, by posting a screenshot of his RISC OS desktop with an extra icon on the left hand side (where devices sit) depicting a cup of tea. When someone spotted it and asked what it was, he replied that it was &#8216;the tea device&#8217;, which reminds him to drink the tea he&#8217;s just made before it gets cold. Rick&#8217;s fondness for tea is well known, so this wasn&#8217;t questioned &#8211; even though it was, in his words, complete&#8230;

StreetFix, the application from Kevin Wells for keeping track of and reporting local problems, such as damaged street furniture, potholes, and so on, has been updated to work with a couple of additional remote API (application programmer interface) providers that use the FixMyStreet platform. The change, added in version 1.07 of the program, means it can now be used in both Norway (the data for which comes from FiksGataMi) and Sweden (FixaMinGata).

## Mozilla drops Onerep after CEO admits to running people-search networks

date: 2024-03-22, from: OS News

The nonprofit organization that supports the Firefox web browser said today it is winding down its new partnership with Onerep, an identity protection service recently bundled with Firefox that offers to remove users from hundreds of people-search sites. The move comes just days after a report by KrebsOnSecurity forced Onerep’s CEO to admit that he has founded dozens of people-search networks over the years.  On March 14, KrebsOnSecurity published a story showing that Onerep’s Belarusian CEO and founder Dimitiri Shelest launched dozens of people-search services since 2010, including a still-active data broker called Nuwber that sells background reports on people. Onerep and Shelest did not respond to requests for comment on that story. ↫ Brian Krebs It&#8217;s good that Mozilla has immediately responded properly to this discovery, but it does make one wonder &#8211; how did this happen in the first place? It seems like a service provider like this would be thoroughly vetted, especially considering Mozilla&#8217;s stated mission and types of users. My worries about Firefox&#8217; future are no secret, and this gaffe certainly doesn&#8217;t help reduce my worries. It&#8217;s clear something went horribly wrong here, and my hope is that it&#8217;s a random fluke, and not a sign of more structural problems in Mozilla&#8217;s vetting process for potential partners.

## Haiku in February: tons of small fixes and improvements

Haiku published its latest monthly activity report, and this one is a veritable grab bag of a whole bunch of small fixes, improvements, and changes &#8211; there&#8217;s really no tent pole features or major improvements this month. Going through the list, the items that jump out at me are updated ping and traceroute applications and work on improving FFmpeg, but there&#8217;s so much more in there, so be sure to read the whole thing. At the end of the report, the Haiku project states about a possible fifth beta release: A few more tickets in the milestone were fixed, including the “ICU upgrade” one, but a few were also added (some migrated from HaikuPorts that turned out to be regressions in Haiku or its buildtools, etc.). ↫ Haiku Activity and Contract Report, February 2024 So, beta 5 is not quite ready for prime time just yet, but it feels like it&#8217;s getting closer.

## Don't Abandon Europe in the Name of 'Asia First'

Allies are key to U.S. great power competition. They are the only asset its adversaries do not also share.

## Switch emulator Suyu hit by GitLab DMCA, project lives on through self-hosting

date: 2024-03-22, from: OS News

Switch emulator Suyu—a fork of the Nintendo-targeted and now-defunct emulation project Yuzu—has been taken down from GitLab following a DMCA request Thursday. But the emulation project&#8217;s open source files remain available on a self-hosted git repo on the Suyu website, and recent compiled binaries remain available on an extant GitLab repo. While the DMCA takedown request has not yet appeared on GitLab&#8217;s public repository of such requests, a GitLab spokesperson confirmed to The Verge that the project was taken down after the site received notice &#8220;from a representative of the rightsholder.&#8221; GitLab has not specified who made the request or how they represented themselves; a representative for Nintendo was not immediately available to respond to a request for comment. ↫ Kyle Orland at Ars Technica Self-hosting the code repository and binaries is probably the only way the Switch emulator can continue to reasonably exist. The issue with Switch emulation seems to be that the device is current, popular, and still makes endless amounts of money for Nintendo; it&#8217;s very different from SNES or Mega Drive emulation, to name a few examples. While I personally don&#8217;t think that should make Switch emulation off-limits or any less valid than emulating older systems, I can see how it would draw the ire of Nintendo more readily.

## The Advanced Nuclear Industry Would Like to Power Your Data Center

At the same time, many technology companies want to procure and invest in clean power, while many states have clean energy goals that may make it difficult to add new load to the grid without a corresponding investment in clean generation. All told, the Department of Energy estimates that some 700 to 900 gigawatts of new clean firm capacity — energy generation that doesn’t emit greenhouse gases and can run 24 hours a day — will be necessary to build a <a href="https://liftoff.energy.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Liftoff_DOE_NextGen_Geothermal.pdf" target="_blank">fully decarbonized grid</a>. Even in the real world, technology companies are interested in acquiring whatever clean power they can.</p><p><span></span>This is where the nuclear industry would love to step in, specifically the segment of the industry making small modular reactors, otherwise known as SMRs. These reactors, which promise to be cheaper, smaller, and faster to build than the existing nuclear fleet, seem like an ideal match for what technology companies need. What could be better for data centers than on-site power (meaning no transmission costs) that runs all day (meaning no intermittency issues) with no carbon emissions (meaning no climate worries)? And if those nuclear power plants could be built quickly and cheaply out of pre-fabricated parts, all the better, right?<del></del></p><p>Whether SMRs actually <em>can</em> step in, well ... “If I had every agreement in principle SMRs have signed, I could walk from here to Europe without getting my feet wet,” Dan Yurman, the publisher of <em>Neutron Bytes</em> and a former project manager at the Idaho National Laboratory, told me. </p><p><strong></strong>The issue is that the most optimistic timeline for commercial deployment of SMRs starts in the late 2020s, with most observers putting actual deployment into sometimes in the 2030s. All the while, demand for data centers is growing <em>now</em> and is projected to accelerate sharply in the next few years.</p><p>As of today only a handful of small modular reactors are currently operational anywhere in the world, and none in the United States. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission<strong>, </strong>which governs all civilian nuclear construction in the country, has so far approved just one SMR design; NuScale, the company behind said design, recently laid off <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/nuscale-power-lay-off-28-labor-force-save-costs-2024-01-08/" target="_blank">almost a third of its employees</a> after its deal to <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/nuscale-small-modular-reactor-nuclear-costs-inflation" target="_self">build a power plant in Utah</a> for a collection of local utilities fell through due to rising costs.</p><p>That approval process cost $500 million and took around five years, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/microsoft-targets-nuclear-to-power-ai-operations-e10ff798" target="_blank">according to the Wall Street Journal</a> — and, of course, NuScale has yet to get a functioning reactor out of it. The company is currently in the process of getting the go-ahead on a more powerful version of its existing design, which the company’s chief executive said could be approved “within 24 months.”</p><p>On paper, however, enthusiasm for co-locating SMRs with data centers and industrial sites abounds. Despite the collapse of the Utah project, during an earnings call this month, NuScale eagerly talked up a partnership with Standard Power to provide 2 gigawatts of electricity to data centers in Ohio and Pennsylvania<strong>.</strong> While its shares are down around 50% for the past 12 months, they are up about 35% (albeit to around $4.20) since the end of last year. In its presentation to investors, NuScale cited estimates that data center electricity consumption would triple by the beginning of the next decade.</p><p>“Management is quite enthusiastic around its opportunity with data center operators, noting that it's in discussions with large players as electricity demand accelerates via the AI buildout,” Ryan Pfingst and Chris Souther, two analysts for B. Riley Securities, wrote in a note to clients following the release of NuScale’s earnings report.<br/><br/>That enthusiasm notwithstanding, it’s not clear how far along the Standard Power project is. “A project of this size has a significant amount of detail that’s confirmed and structured before a project begins construction and those discussions are ongoing,” NuScale CEO John Hopkins told analysts on the company’s most recent earnings call. Standard Power did not return a request for comment asking for more details on the financing or construction timeline for its project. When asked for an update from NuScale, a spokesperson referred me to the earnings call.<strong><em></em></strong></p><p>Meanwhile, in Surry County, Virginia, work is advancing on a project adjacent to the existing Surry nuclear plant. The project would combine data centers, small modular reactors, and hydrogen fuel production; the <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/nuclear-powered-data-center-campus-in-surry-virginia-gets-rezoning-approval/" target="_blank">data centers would come first</a>, with SMRs following once costs come down, according to <a href="https://www.ip3international.com/about-us/ip3-founders-and-management/rear-admiral-ret-michael-hewitt-u-s-navy/" target="_blank">Michael Hewitt</a>, the co-founder and chief executive officer of IP3, the project’s developer.</p><p>For Hewitt, the model for SMR deployment is to build them in factories and scale them directly for end users. “That’s the future of energy: If I want a gigawatt of data center, I build SMRs for the data center on day one,” he told me.<br/></p><p>Which company will get there first? “If I had to guess right now, in terms of what will be factory-built first and available to consumers like us, it will more than likely be a light water reactor design — <a href="https://www.gevernova.com/nuclear/carbon-free-power/bwrx-300-small-modular-reactor" target="_blank">GE</a>, NuScale, or perhaps<a href="https://www.rolls-royce-smr.com/" target="_blank"> Rolls-Royce</a>,” Hewitt said. GE’s SMR design, the BWRX-300, is in the pre-application process with the NRC, and was picked by Ontario Power Generation for a nuclear development on its <a href="https://www.gevernova.com/news/press-releases/ge-hitachi-signs-contract-for-the-first-north-american-small-modular-reactor" target="_blank">existing Darlington site</a>. The Rolls-Royce SMR <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/rolls-royce-shortlisted-uk-seeks-small-nuclear-plant-developers-2023-10-02/" target="_blank">has been advancing</a> through the British regulatory and procurement process, while the company currently designs light-water reactors for the Royal Navy.</p><p>“The first guy to get the factory built is the winner,” Hewitt said. But none will likely be ready for the Virginia project, at least not within the next eight to 10 years, though, he added. Nevertheless, urgent interest persists.</p><p>On Tuesday, Google, Microsoft, and the steel company Nucor announced that they were forming a group that would <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/google-microsoft-nucor-clean-energy-initiative/" target="_blank">commit to purchasing clean firm technologies</a> and included in its laundry list of potential power sources advanced nuclear. Another advanced nuclear developer, TerraPower, which is backed by Microsoft’s founder Bill Gates, announced Tuesday that it was applying for a construction permit for a plant in Wyoming and plans to start building non-nuclear portions of it in June<strong>.</strong> The company expects the full plant to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/418907d1-d497-439c-9800-eb814226ab71" target="_blank">come online in 2030</a>.</p><p>There are dozens of other SMR designs at various stage of realization, but the absolute fastest a new design could get online, according to Adam Stein of the Breakthrough Institute, is around four years. “If a developer has not already submitted an application to the NRC to build a power plant — which none of them have for a specific site — then they mostly likely would not be able to operate a power plant before 2028,” Stein told me. “That is the soonest it could happen.”</p><p>That said, “If there’s more urgency from the market, a clearer and larger demand signal, then developers will move faster than they are right now,” Stein added.</p><p>What’s far more likely, according to Yurman, is that tech companies will sign power purchase agreements for existing nuclear power plants, as <a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/amazon-nuclear-talen-energy" target="_blank">Amazon has with Talen Energy</a>. “That’s immediate access to reliable power,” Yurman said.</p><p>And even if SMRs are actually built, they may not end up adjacent to data centers, but instead on the sites of existing nuclear and even coal plants (this is the plan for the TerraPower site) which have preexisting grid connections. “If I’m putting together this kind of deal,” Yurman told me, “I’m looking at an old coal power plant I can demolish and keep the grid connection.”</p><p>While American tech companies are eager to buy up new power, the real opportunity, should it ever come, may be overseas, where smaller countries without indigenous energy supplies could be especially interested in nuclear power.</p><p>“What we need to do is get to full rate production and start stamping out SMRs with low risk,” Hewitt said. “If we do that, we can take these things everywhere.”</p>

## US Pledges Additional $22M to Fight Terrorism in Mozambique

date: 2024-03-22, from: VOA News USA

Maputo, Mozambique — U.S. officials pledged $22 million in new funding Thursday to help Mozambique fight Islamist militants in the country’s troubled, oil-rich Cabo Delgado, where an insurgency has intensified in recent weeks.


The United States already had pledged $100 million.


At the end of a five-day visit to Maputo, Anne Witkowsky, U.S. assistant secretary of state for conflict and stabilization operations, said the funding aims to help Mozambique with stabilizing and peacebuilding efforts in its northern provinces.


Calling security in north Mozambique critical, Witkowsky told VOA that the U.S.-financed programs provide training for local government officials to deliver services; promote social cohesion through peace clubs, sports and the arts; and increase educational and employment opportunities for youth.


“Mozambique is a priority partner country under our strategy to prevent conflict and promote stability,” she said. “So, the U.S. supports a Mozambique that is more prosperous, more secure, more resilient and more democratic for all.”


Since 2017, Mozambique’s province of Cabo Delgado has faced an armed insurgency, with some attacks claimed by an extremist group calling itself Islamic State.


On Monday, Mozambican President Filipe Nyusi warned that terrorism could divide the country, advocating that citizens unite to fight rebel groups in the province.


Nyusi spoke after missionaries, priests and religious sisters were forced to flee from remote towns and villages to Pemba and other large cities, which are overwhelmed with persons displaced by the conflict.


Nyusi said resolution of the problem depends on the unity of Mozambicans and foreign forces supporting them.


The Reverend Marcos Macamo, a scholar of African theology and religious sciences, is part of a coalition of religious and civic advocacy groups that are urging the government to open negotiations with the militants. But, he said, even diplomacy has its own challenges.


“The terrorists ... wouldn’t have power unless local people give them information,” Macamo said. “They [locals] open the doors slightly so that the enemy can enter.”


The insurgency in northern Mozambique began in 2017 but has seen an increase in attacks since the beginning of this year. In the last few days alone, there have been several raids on towns and villages, and people have been killed or kidnapped.


According to humanitarian agencies, the insurgency has killed at least 5,000 people and displaced more than 1 million.


Oil giants Exxon Mobil and Total are among international energy companies developing natural gas projects offshore of northern Mozambique.

Nebraska small talk regresses not to what route you took — the California concern — but how fast you got there. Rather than get on a plane, people from the Great Plains will undertake a 10-hour drive to Cousin Rob’s in Dallas and rue that they could’ve done it in nine and a half if not for all the construction. Dads refuse to stop on long drives for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GenX/comments/17xoi65/comment/k9oqs0q/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3" target="_blank">this very reason</a>.<br/></p>
<p>Electric cars aren’t great for making great time. Even though charging speeds are getting faster, the leisurely pace of the EV break can’t compare to the Cannonball Run pit stop: pump gas, use the restroom, and get back on the road within five minutes. EVs are not (yet) ideal for other, more practical rural concerns. The punishing winter temperatures of North Dakota can sap a battery’s driving range. So does towing the boat to the lake. Flyover country is full of state highways where there is nary a fast-charger in sight.</p>
<p>Those are among the reasons the residents of rural America hesitate to embrace the EV. There is a tribal impetus, too: Rural areas are heavily Republican and more likely to reject electric cars on the basis of political identity. This fact may spell trouble for the Detroit auto giants trying to sell EV pickup trucks to die-hard combustion loyalists and for goals of making America an all-EV nation anytime soon. But when it comes to climate, maybe it’s not a <em>crisis</em>.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p class="drop-caps">Like any environmental issue, the EV question is about scale. To reduce the carbon pollution of the transportation sector, it’s not enough for a few people to trade in their gas-guzzling Ford Expeditions for Mustang Mach-Es. Most people need to do it to take a chunk out of emissions.</p>
<p>Fortunately, electric vehicles work best where people are concentrated. City dwellers generally drive shorter distances than rural residents during errands and commutes, meaning an EV with decent range can cover their everyday needs. Even those at the exurban extents of major metropolitan areas are generally close enough to city centers to make a round trip without charging in the middle. </p>
<p>Charging infrastructure follows the population maps, too. As the country scales up its supply of level 3 fast chargers, it still makes the most sense to put the vast majority of those plugs in cities and along the Interstate System where those urbanites do most of their driving. This drives a feedback loop that will continue to make electric driving more enticing to city people than country people.</p>
<p>For those rooting for mass adoption of EVs, this is good news. According to sustainability researchers at the University of Michigan, <a href="https://css.umich.edu/publications/factsheets/built-environment/us-cities-factsheet" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">83%</a> of Americans now live in urban areas, up from 64% in 1950. That number could approach 90% by mid-century. The United States, despite its small town self-mythologizing, is an urban country that grows more urban by the day, and that means most people live in a location where an EV could meet their daily driving needs. </p>
<p>(Also, urban areas should embrace EVs to reduce the <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-cars-improve-air-quality" target="_self">health-damaging air pollution</a> from ICE tailpipes, which concentrates in places with lots of people, and therefore cars. In rural places where people are spread out and dozens of cars don’t sit idling as a herd during freeway traffic, this is a less pressing concern.)</p>
<p>The fact that electric driving would prove more challenging for rural America sounds like grim news for climate change, since <a href="https://www.anthropocenemagazine.org/2020/02/the-unexpected-drivers-of-carbon-footprints/#:~:text=Overall%2C%20the%20rural%20carbon%20footprint,to%20transportation%20and%20home%20heating." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to one study</a>, they have a 20% larger carbon footprint compared to their urban counterparts, a difference largely attributed to home heating and to driving longer distances. But, again, the question is about scale. Even though living in the boonies necessitates emitting more carbon, there are just <em>so many more</em> metropolitan Americans. The best way to make a big dent in transportation emissions is to get metro residents — the 83% — to embrace the life electric.</p>
<p>Eventually, the EV revolution will reach the countryside, but those who prefer combustion driving will be able to keep doing so for a long time to come. Even if the nation followed the California goal of making the light-duty vehicle market 100% electric by <a href="https://rhg.com/research/build-back-better-transportation/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2035</a>, that’s only <em>new</em> cars. (California <a href="https://www.realclearenergy.org/articles/2024/01/18/california_landscapers_brace_for_gas-powered_lawn_equipment_ban_1005864.html#:~:text=On%20January%201%2C%202024%2C%20California,noise%20pollution%2C%20and%20climate%20change." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">banned</a> the sale of gas-powered lawn equipment, but I still hear plenty of small-engine leaf blowers at work around Los Angeles every afternoon.) Vehicles are better-built than they’ve even been and last on the road for more than a decade, meaning there’ll be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/03/10/climate/electric-vehicle-fleet-turnover.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">plenty of gas-burners</a> on the highway deep into the 2040s. It will just become more expensive to fuel and to service them as the country’s infrastructure and mechanic shops finally move away from combustion.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p class="drop-caps">Just like America’s presidential elections, the country’s EV battle may be won or lost in the suburbs. </p>
<p>Consider one recent research <a href="https://theconversation.com/suburban-living-the-worst-for-carbon-emissions-new-research-149332" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">project</a>, which found that while rural residents emit more carbon than city-dwellers, it’s suburbanites who are the very worst. They drive more than those who live in the center city and might have access to decent public transportation. And, on average, they earn more than truly rural residents, which is <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1922205117" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">correlated with a higher carbon footprint</a>. That project studied Austria, but the Brookings Institute <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/its-not-just-cities-suburbs-and-exurbs-need-to-adopt-and-implement-climate-plans-too/#:~:text=In%20metropolitan%20regions%2C%20suburbs%20emit,up%20to%20twice%20the%20average." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">found the same thing</a> in the United States: “In metropolitan regions, suburbs emit up to four times the household emissions of their urban cores. While households located in more densely populated neighborhoods have a carbon footprint 50% below the national average, those in the suburbs emit up to twice the average.”</p>
<p>To put it another way: It’s suburbanites who could potentially do the most climate good by switching to EVs. Plus, they are potentially affluent enough to afford electric vehicles. They’re also likely to have garages and driveways to make charging at home a simpler affair compared to the apartment-dweller who has little control over whether their landlord puts plugs in the parking lot. (Mine didn’t.)</p>
<p>Certainly suburbia has its share of MAGA rank-and-file who dismiss EVs as the choice of the woke, as well as Towing Dads who’ll hold out until electric pickup range can match that of gas. Yet the politically purple ‘burbs may be ruled by the pragmatists, or people who’ll happily buy an EV — just as soon as they’re convinced it’s the right economic choice for their families, or, perhaps, as soon as everybody else at their kids’ school starts getting one. </p>
<p>Sources like David Rapson of the University of California, Davis have <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/03/americas-lost-year-electric-cars/677686/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told me</a> these buyers are the tipping point for the mass adoption of the electric vehicle. It makes sense: EVs may never convince their entrenched opponents to ditch internal combustion, but they don’t have to. If the bulk of Americans make the jump and begin driving the kids to practice on battery power, that’s an enormous chunk of carbon that’s simply not emitted.</p>
<p>Transportation is about the right technology for the right situation. EVs are a just-okay choice for dense urban centers — they’re better than gas cars, but thoughtful city planning could help people choose greener and better solutions such as cycling and mass transit. For car-reliant suburbs and exurbs, EVs hold the key to drastically reducing carbon emissions. In truly rural America, the best choice for years to come might be burning gasoline. And maybe that’s fine — as long as the country’s population centers get with the program. </p>

## The North Pole Is Still a Giant Climate Mystery

date: 2024-03-22, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTc0OTM1My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0NDEwMTUyNn0.4K9JXZkO07yhibQ5hDw7Bdyd68LYm0hOA6DXyE6itMk/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p>As is usually the case, one of the most basic questions in <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/this-is-the-end-of-climate-science" target="_blank">climate science</a> has also been one of the most difficult to answer: How much energy is the Earth sending out into space? The pair of shoebox-sized satellites that comprise PREFIRE — Polar Radiant Energy in the Far-InfraRed Experiment — could very well provide the answer.</p><p>Principal investigator Tristan L’Ecuyer, a professor in the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the director of the Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies, spoke with Heatmap about PREFIRE. Tentatively scheduled to launch in May, the project stands not only to make future climate models more accurate, but could also help shape a new generation of atmospheric exploration.</p><p>The interview has been edited for length and clarity.</p><p><strong>Could you tell me a little bit about your research and the work that you do?</strong></p><p>A lot of our climate information comes from models — where I come in is trying to make sure that those predictions are rooted in actual observations of our planet. But it’s impossible to cover the whole globe with a temperature sensor or water vapor [sensor] or those sorts of things, so I’ve always focused on using satellite observations, and in particular I’ve been focusing on the exchange of energy. </p><p>Basically, what drives the climate is the incoming energy from the sun and how that’s balanced by the thermal energy that the Earth emits. One of the big influencers of that balance are clouds — they reflect the sunlight, but they also have a greenhouse effect of their own; they trap the thermal energy emitted. So I’ve spent most of my career trying to understand the effects of clouds on the climate and how that might change if the climate warms.</p><p><strong>And what’s the goal of this particular mission?</strong></p><p>One of the fastest changing regions on Earth right now is the polar regions — I think a lot of people are aware of that. Normally, the polar regions are very cold — they reflect a lot of sunlight just because of the ice surface. But as the ice surface melts, the ocean is a lot darker than ice, and so [the poles] can actually absorb more of the solar radiation that’s coming in. </p><p>A lot of people say, “Well, okay, but that’s the Arctic. I don’t live there.” But the way the climate works is that in order to create an equilibrium between these really, really cold polar caps and the really, really warm tropics. It’s just like heating the end of a rod — the rod is going to transfer some of the heat from the hot end to the cold end to establish an equilibrium between them. The Earth does the same thing, but the way it does that is through our weather systems. So basically, how cold the polar region is versus the equator is what’s going to govern how severe our weather is in the mid-latitudes. </p><p>What we’re trying to do is make measurements of, basically, how that thermal energy is distributed. We just have a lack of understanding right now — or it’s more that the understanding comes from isolated, individual field projects, and what we really want to do is map out the whole Arctic and understand all of the different regions and how it’s changing.</p><p><strong>How do you expect your findings to influence our climate models? Or how <em>significantly</em> do you expect them to affect the climate models?</strong></p><p>This is quite unusual for a satellite project, we actually have climate modelers as part of our team. There’s the people that take, for example, the Greenland ice sheet, and they model things like the melting of the ice, how heat transports into the ice sheet, how the water once it melts percolates through the ice and then runs off at the bottom of the glacier, or even on top of the glacier. And then I have a general climate modeling group that basically uses climate models to project future climate. </p><p>There’s two ways that's going to happen. The first is we’ve developed a tool that allows us to kind of simulate what our satellite would see if it was flying in a climate model as opposed to around the real Earth — we can simulate exactly what the climate model is suggesting the satellite should see. And then of course, we’re making the real observations with the satellite. We can compare the two and evaluate, in today’s climate, how well is that climate model reproducing what the satellites see?</p><p>The other way is we’re going to generate models of how much heat comes off of various surfaces — ice surfaces, water surfaces, snow surfaces — and that information can be used to create a new module that goes right into the climate model and improves the way it represents the surface.</p><p><strong>So what do these satellites look like and how do they work?</strong></p><p>Our satellite is called a CubeSat. It’s not very big at all, maybe a foot wide, a foot-and-a-half or so long. There’s a little aperture, a little hole on the end of the satellite that lets the thermal energy from the Earth go in, and then the the rest of the satellite is basically just this big box that has a radio and a transmitter. In total, I think the whole thing weighs about 15 kilograms. </p><p>Because it's relatively small and relatively inexpensive, we're actually able to have two of those instead of just having one, and what that lets us do is put them into different orbits. At some point that will cross and see the same spot on the ground — let’s say somewhere in the center of Greenland — but up to eight or nine hours apart. Let’s say it melts in between, we’ll be able to understand how that melting process affected the heat that was emitted from the surface into the atmosphere.</p><p><strong>How big of a deal do you think this is? Or how big of a deal do you think it could be?</strong></p><p>There’s more than a couple of aspects to this. To really segue from the last question to this one, the reason [the satellites are] inexpensive, it’s not that they’re low-quality. It’s actually because they’re very uniform sizes and shapes. You can mass produce them. And so it’s that fact, coupled with the fact that we can now do real science on this small platform. We’ve been able to miniaturize the technology. If we can keep demonstrating that these missions are viable and producing realistic science data, this could be the future of the field. </p><p>Coming back to the polar climate, we absolutely know that the poles are warming at a very alarming rate. We know that the ice sheets are melting. We know that this has implications for the weather in the lower latitudes where we live, and for sea level. But when you try to predict that 100 years from now, there’s quite a range of different answers, from very catastrophic to still pretty bad. Depending on which of those answers is correct, it really dictates what we need to do today. How quickly do we need to adapt to a rising sea level, or to stronger storms or more frequent storms? After this mission, we will be able to improve the climate models in such a way that we’ll have a narrower range of possibilities. </p><p>The other thing that’s exciting is also just the unknown. There’s always new things that you learn by measuring something for the first time. We might learn something about the tropics, we might learn something about the upper atmosphere. There are some people in mountainous areas that are quite interested in the measurements — at the top of mountains, it’s actually quite similar in climate to the Arctic. So I’m also really excited about what happens when the science community in general explores that data for the first time.</p>

## Qualcomm says most Windows games should ‘just work’ on its unannounced Arm laptops

date: 2024-03-22, from: OS News

In a 2024 Game Developers Conference session titled “Windows on Snapdragon, a Platform Ready for your PC Games,” Qualcomm engineer Issam Khalil drove home that the unannounced laptops will use emulation to run x86/64 games at close to full speed. Those laptops may be coming fast. Qualcomm has confirmed it will launch Snapdragon X Elite systems this summer, and unannounced consumer versions of the Surface Pro 10 and Surface Laptop 6 are expected in May with those chips, sources told The Verge. ↫ Sean Hollister at The Verge I&#8217;m genuinely curious to see if they can fulfill this promise. I really want widespread availability of ARM laptops. My hope is that we end up with a more standardised ARM landscape, making it easier for operating systems to support these new machines.

## The LNG Lawsuit Everyone Saw Coming

date: 2024-03-22, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDM0MDAwMC9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2ODQzODE2Nn0.7qLtGHwtvJDuHPOt-W4Ue-pqu3d_1ggV3S7sxzg1utg/image.png?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C1%2C0%2C1"/><br/><br/><p>
<em><strong>Current conditions:</strong> The air quality in Birmingham, Alabama, is “moderate” due to smoke from planned fires • Tourists in drought-stricken Barcelona are being asked to conserve water • It’s 103 degrees Fahrenheit in South Sudan. Tomorrow will be even hotter.</em>
</p><h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2><h3>1. 16 states sue Biden administration over LNG pause</h3><p>
<strong></strong>Sixteen Republican-led states are <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=8be0bfb2f3&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">suing</a> the Biden administration over its pause on approvals for new liquified natural gas export terminals. The White House <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=e5c8a1111b&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a> the pause in January, saying it wanted the Energy Department to first study the effect LNG projects have on the climate. The lawsuit claims this move was illegal and that there should have been a regulatory process giving key stakeholders a voice in the final decision. The U.S. is the biggest exporter of LNG in the world. Gas is “cleaner” to burn than coal, but the emissions footprint of transporting LNG is <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=4c011ceffd&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">potentially massive</a>, which is why climate activists celebrated the pause. But the decision was slammed by the fossil fuel industry and some advocates who say gas is “crucial for discouraging coal use in developing nations,” <em>Bloomberg</em> <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=cdb14b9f18&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">explained</a>, adding: “The White House’s move struck at the heart of the debate over the future of energy.”

</p><div class="horizontal-rule"></div><h3>2. White House tells Ukraine to stop targeting Russian oil refineries</h3><p>
<strong></strong>Washington has told Ukraine to stop targeting Russia’s energy infrastructure because its attacks could cause global oil prices to rise and push the Kremlin to retaliate, the <em>Financial Times </em><a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=ce47f9f933&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>. A military intelligence official told the paper that there have been at least 12 attacks on Russian oil refineries since 2022, nine of which occurred this year. There have also been attacks on terminals and storage infrastructure. “Russia remains one of the world’s most important energy exporters despite western sanctions on its oil and gas sector,” the <em>FT</em> said. Gas prices have risen almost 15% already this year, putting pressure on President Biden leading into the November election.
</p><h3>3. NASA: Sea levels saw ‘relatively large jump’ last year</h3><p>
<strong></strong>The global average sea level rose by about 0.3 inches between 2022 and 2023, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=90112dab68&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to</a> NASA. This is a “relatively large jump,” the agency said, driven by climate change and El Niño. Since 1993, the global average sea level has risen by 4 inches and the rate of rise is accelerating. In 1993, sea levels rose by about .07 inches per year.

	“Current rates of acceleration mean that we are on track to add another 20 centimeters [nearly 8 inches] of global mean sea level by 2050, doubling the amount of change in the next three decades compared to the previous 100 years and increasing the frequency and impacts of floods across the world,” <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=0e57d16dab&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> Nadya Vinogradova Shiffer, director for the NASA sea level change team and the ocean physics program in Washington.
</p><h3>4. Countries pledge to double down on nuclear energy expansion</h3><p>
<strong></strong>A group of 35 countries have <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=d1d3ea291e&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pledged</a> to “work to fully unlock the potential of nuclear energy” in the quest for energy security and emissions reductions. The relatively vague commitment, cosigned by the U.S., China, Britain, and Saudi Arabia, emerged from the first-ever Nuclear Energy Summit in Brussels yesterday. It says countries will help extend the lives of existing nuclear reactors, construct new ones, and support deployment of advanced reactors. “Generating electricity using nuclear fission remains a divisive issue that cuts across partisan lines,” <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=6d26939cbc&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a><a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=c3204c4185&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Nicole Pollack at Heatmap</a>. Some environmental groups see the risk of nuclear disasters as too high, while others see it as a reliable low-carbon energy resource that’s available to us right now. “Without the support of nuclear power, we have no chance to reach our climate targets on time,” said International Energy Agency chief Fatih Birol.
</p><h3>5. Biden administration to award $6.3 billion for projects to decarbonize heavy industries</h3><p>
<strong></strong>In the coming days, the Biden administration is expected to announce which projects will receive a cut of some $6.3 billion in funding to help decarbonize the U.S. industrial sector, <em>Bloomberg</em> <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=68e58963de&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>. Heavy industry contributes nearly one third of the nation’s primary energy-related carbon dioxide, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=9befd85e4f&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to</a> the Department of Energy, so slashing emissions here without hurting the economy is a priority. The <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=2b9652c06c&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Industrial Demonstrations Program</a> aims to kickstart the process by focusing on the big emitters, like iron, steel, cement and concrete, chemicals, food and drink, aluminum, and paper products. “We hear every day about industrial companies that are interested in decarbonizing their plants, but the initial costs can be daunting,” Nora Esram, a senior director for research with the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy nonprofit, told <em>Bloomberg</em>. “The federal funds are geared to enable them to invest in new technologies to cut emissions while supporting community development.” The announcement could come as soon as Monday.
</p><h2>THE KICKER</h2><p>New York’s JFK airport is <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=2758d464d5&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">getting a large EV charging station</a> that will be open to the public 24/7.</p>

## P&B: Taylor Troesh

date: 2024-03-22, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>This is the 30th edition of <em>People and Blogs</em>, the series where I ask interesting people to talk about themselves and their blogs. Today we have Taylor Troesh and his blog, <a href="https://taylor.town/">taylor.town</a></p>
<p>To follow this series <a href="https://peopleandblogs.com">subscribe to the newsletter</a>. A new interview will land in your inbox every Friday. Not a fan of newsletters? No problem! You can read the interviews here on the blog or you can subscribe to the <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/feed">RSS feed</a>.</p>
<hr />
<div class="q"><p><strong>Let&rsquo;s start from the basics: can you introduce yourself?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>Hello! I’m Taylor (mayor of <a href="https://taylor.town/">taylor.town</a>).</p>
<p>I collect hobbies, build things, incite chaos, and engage in elaborate tomfoolery. I work as a developer, designer, DB architect, <a href="https://taylor.town/hire-me">and other things</a>.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>What&rsquo;s the story behind your blog?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>I created my first personal website to quickly teach myself how to make websites, because I fudged my resume and accidentally landed a job as a web developer before I was ready.</p>
<p>My website became a blog when I posted my digital notebooks online circa 2015. I maintained hundreds of markdown files on various topics and ideas, but I was too embarrassed to publish most of the actual notes, so I replaced the body of each file with “Coming soon!”. My private ideas.txt file sits at 110,427 words right now. This does not include hundreds of unfinished essays, papers, books, stories, games, gadgets, etc.</p>
<p>As I grew more specific and organized, my notes became easier to digest. In 2019, I started writing about <a href="https://taylor.town/the-speedy-media-manifesto">my opinions</a>, <a href="https://taylor.town/synthetic-intelligence">my fears</a>, <a href="https://taylor.town/time">my inspirations</a>, and <a href="https://taylor.town/how-do-taoists-quit-smoking">my paradoxes</a>.</p>
<p>But I didn’t start writing seriously <a href="https://taylor.town/1000-weekends">until I stopped drinking in 2022</a>. Writing was welcome respite from alcohol withdrawals. Without booze to fill my emptiness, I suddenly found myself with plenty of “boring” hours. So I kept writing. And now I can’t stop writing.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>What does your creative process look like when it comes to blogging?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>I consume absurd amounts of <a href="https://taylor.town/books">books</a>, <a href="https://blogs.hn/">small blogs</a>, <a href="https://taylor.town/music">music</a>, <a href="https://taylor.town/podcasts">podcasts</a>, and other internet media.</p>
<p>From there, my inspiration ferments in a 1Mb text file called ideas.txt. When I’m not doing chores, I start from the top of ideas.txt and work my way down, making small <a href="https://taylor.town/pseudoprose">pseudoprose</a> edits along the way. An idea usually sits at the top of the list for a few months before it’s ripe enough to publish.</p>
<p>Here’s an excerpt from the top of my list on Dec 7, 2023:</p>
<p>Krampus and negative punishment</p>
<ul>
<li>holiday alignment chart</li>
<li>does negative punishment work?</li>
<li>santa claus is not a god: <a href="https://brill.com/view/journals/jocc/8/1-2/article-p149_8.xml">https://brill.com/view/journals/jocc/8/1-2/article-p149_8.xml</a></li>
<li>is santa effective? <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0361476X84900031">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0361476X84900031</a> santa</li>
<li>visits rich sick children: <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/355/bmj.i6355.abstract">https://www.bmj.com/content/355/bmj.i6355.abstract</a></li>
</ul></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe the physical space influences your creativity?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>Countless creations die in the pursuit of Ideal Creative Environments. After hearing how much quality work Tyler Cowen completes while traveling, I taught myself how to <a href="https://taylor.town/between-time">scrounge for in-between time</a>. Through that process, I made more time for creative pursuits via <a href="https://taylor.town/extinguish-all-notifications">extinguishing notifications</a> and <a href="https://taylor.town/nowify">bespoke time-tracking software</a>.</p>
<p>Today, most of my creative process occurs on couches – just me and my laptop. When I need more real-estate, I use <a href="https://taylor.town/my-battlestation">my battlestation</a>. When my thoughts become tangled, I clean my home or play with my daughter or walk outside. When I draw, I use our makeshift art studio in the basement. And so on.</p>
<p>Everything in a home or office eventually becomes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inattentional_blindness#Invisible_Gorilla_Test">invisible gorillas</a>. In my experience, physical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propinquity">propinquity</a> is the fastest way to modulate creativity. Unsurprisingly, surrounding myself with healthy and supportive people was a really good way to become healthy and supported.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your tech stack?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><ul>
<li>All my writings are markdown files (with YAML frontmatter) in a GitHub repo.</li>
<li>An ugly Elixir script converts each file into HTML and compiles <a href="https://taylor.town/feed.xml">an atom feed</a>.</li>
<li>All of these files are served to the public via Cloudflare Pages.</li>
<li>Every few weeks, I copy/paste stuff into <a href="https://buttondown.email/">Buttondown</a> for <a href="https://newsletter.taylor.town/">my email newsletter</a>.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would you do anything differently?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><ul>
<li>More doodles! I’m still working up the courage to share more of my drawings…</li>
<li>People cannot spell “Troesh” from memory, so I’m glad I chose <a href="https://taylor.town/">taylor.town</a> over <a href="https://taylor.troe.sh/">taylor.troe.sh</a>. But I’ll never know if <a href="https://taylor.town/">taylor.town</a> was a better choice than <a href="https://taylor.land/">taylor.land</a>.</li>
<li>If I started over, I probably wouldn’t write my build script in Elixir – maybe Haskell or Go or JS instead?</li>
<li>I wasted a lot of time on essay ideas that were time-consuming but obviously worthless. I should’ve learned earlier to sort by <a href="https://dom.iowa.gov/resource/lean-resources/impact-difficulty-matrix-template">difficulty vs. impact</a>.</li>
<li>I’m still unsure about Instagram, X, and other socials media. I love meeting strangers via email – am I missing cool people from other corners of the web?</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>Financial question since the web is obsessed with money: how much does it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost or does it generate some revenue? And what&rsquo;s your position on people monetising personal blogs?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>It costs $0 to host my blog on GitHub and Cloudflare. I spend $30/mo on Buttondown. I once hoped that my blog would land me some sweet consulting gigs. As of 2023, total consulting revenue is $0.</p>
<p>I aim to be worth <a href="https://taylor.town/dollar-per-hour">$1/hour</a>. Advertising is spooky, so I’ve been working on books and games and services to sell instead. But it’s hard to juggle making worthwhile art while working for an employer while publishing free content.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth checking out? And also, who do you think I should be interviewing next?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>I support <a href="https://www.patreon.com/todepond">TodePond</a> and <a href="https://www.patreon.com/hundredrabbits">Hundred Rabbits</a> via Patreon.</p>
<p>I would also love to support <a href="https://www.experimental-history.com/">Experimental History</a> and <a href="https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/">Escaping Flatland</a>, but I’m avoiding Substack for now.</p>

## The spending bill is also kind of a border security bill

date: 2024-03-22, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>The House is set to vote on a $1.2 trillion spending package Friday ahead of a partial government shutdown deadline. The proposed appropriations bill includes a significant bump in border security funding, including cash intended to more or less double the number of Border Patrol agents. We&#8217;ll also break down the Department of Justice&#8217;s antitrust case against Apple and hear how the need for insurance is influencing major life decisions.</p>

## Hubble Spots the Spider Galaxy

This image from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope shows the gauzy-looking celestial body UGC 5829, an irregular galaxy that lies about 30 million light-years away. Despite the lack of observations of this relatively faint galaxy, UGC 5829 has a distinct and descriptive name: the Spider Galaxy. Perhaps its distorted galactic arms with their glowing, star-forming […]

## Say it ain’t so: BMW, Volkswagen, and Renault take aim at Europe’s ICE ban phase-out

Next year, the policy will tighten ahead of the full ban of gas and diesel cars in 2035, leaving automakers to pay steep fines if they fall short.</p>

## At UN, Russia and China Veto US Effort at Gaza Cease-Fire

date: 2024-03-22, from: VOA News USA

UNITED NATIONS — The U.N. Security Council failed again Friday to demand a Gaza cease-fire after Russia and China vetoed a U.S.-drafted resolution supporting a halt to the fighting.


"Russia and China simply did not want to vote for a resolution that was penned by the United States, because it would rather see us fail than see this council succeed," U.S. Ambassador Linda-Thomas Greenfield said.


Eleven of the 15 council members supported the U.S. text, Algeria joined Russia and China in voting against it, and Guyana abstained.


The United States drafted the resolution following its three earlier vetoes of council texts calling for a halt to the fighting. In what some council members said was vague language, the U.S. draft "determines the imperative of an immediate and sustained cease-fire" to protect civilians, get more humanitarian aid in and hostages out.


"However, to save the lives of peaceful Palestinian civilians, this is not enough," Russian envoy Vassily Nebenzia said of the language. "This is in no way what is stipulated in the mandate of the U.N. Security Council – the council, which is invested with a unique mechanism to demand a cease-fire, and where necessary to compel compliance therewith."


China's envoy echoed that, saying the draft resolution was "ambiguous" and did not call for an immediate cease-fire.


Guyanese Ambassador Carolyn Rodrigues-Birkett, whose country joined the council in January, said her government could not support a resolution that did not "unequivocally" call for an immediate and unconditional cease-fire.


"The demand for a cease-fire should not be linked to or conditioned on the release of hostages," she said. "The taking of hostages is strictly prohibited under international law, and their release must be unconditional." 




She also questioned why only Hamas was condemned for its actions and not Israel, as well.


"For example, who is responsible for 1.5 million Palestinians taking refuge in Rafah? And who has announced a planned military ground offensive there? To whom is the demand for compliance with obligations under international law regarding the protection of civilians and civilian objects, humanitarian access, and the protection of humanitarian relief and medical personnel, their assets and infrastructure applicable?" she asked.


The condemnation of Hamas has been a repeated sticking point for some council members. Thomas-Greenfield called it "outrageous" that the council has failed to condemn its terror attack on Israel.


This was the seventh time the council failed to agree on a cease-fire resolution since the war started in October. The International Crisis Group's U.N. director, Richard Gowan, told VOA that a lot of council members may feel that Russia and China "blew up" what has been the best opportunity to engage with the United States to achieve one.


"If the resolution had passed, it would at least have been a hook for further negotiations and sent a signal to Israel to step back from Rafah," he said. "Now the Israelis may sense that they can push forward with their operations without facing any censure at the U.N. So, the main beneficiary of the Russian-Chinese vetoes is [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu."


A group of seven elected council members – Algeria, Guyana, Malta, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, Slovenia, and Switzerland – have drafted their own text that "demands" an immediate cease-fire for the Muslim holy month of Ramadan – which is already under way.


Diplomats said the text will be voted on Saturday morning. Russia and China said they would support it, but Thomas-Greenfield indicated that in its current form it may not have Washington's support.


"If that alternative resolution comes up for a vote and does not support the diplomacy happening on the ground, we may once again find this council deadlocked," she said. "I truly hope that that does not come about."


Regional diplomacy


Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken left the Middle East without convincing Netanyahu to call off a military offensive in Rafah, in southern Gaza, which many believe would exacerbate the territory’s humanitarian crisis.


Netanyahu said he told Blinken during talks Friday in Tel Aviv, that "we have no way to defeat Hamas without entering Rafah."




Blinken told reporters at the end of his visit that the U.S. shares Israel's goal of defeating Hamas.


"But a major ground operation in Rafah is not, in our judgment, the way to achieve it and we were very clear about that," he said.


The State Department said Blinken emphasized the need to protect civilians in Gaza and increase and sustain humanitarian assistance, including through both land and sea routes.


Blinken's meeting with Israeli officials in Tel Aviv Friday came as efforts continued to secure a six-week-long cease-fire between Israel and Hamas in exchange for the release of hostages seized on October 7. The threat of a potential invasion of Rafah casts doubt over the talks.


On Thursday, Blinken told reporters after meetings in Egypt that "the gaps are narrowing" and that there's still "difficult work to get there," but he believes a deal is possible.


The main point of contention in negotiations has been that Hamas says it will release the remaining hostages only as part of a deal that would end the war, whereas Israel says it will consider only a temporary pause.


At the United Nations, Israel's ambassador told the Security Council his government does not want to send its "sons and daughters" to fight in Rafah, but that there is "no alternative" as its military must go after the four remaining Hamas battalions it says are in the city.


"The road to a permanent cease-fire passes through Rafah," Ambassador Gilad Erdan said.


More than a million Palestinians are sheltering in Rafah, many of them after fleeing other parts of Gaza to try to find safety amid the war.


Hamas' October 7 terror attack inside Israel triggered the war, killing about 1,200 people. Israel's subsequent counteroffensive in Gaza has killed nearly 32,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry.


Delivery of humanitarian assistance has been difficult, and a U.N.-backed food insecurity report said last week that more than a million Palestinians are at risk of famine in the coming weeks.


VOA's State Department bureau chief Nike Ching contributed to this report.

On March 9, Kovensky explored the secret, men-only, right-wing society called the Society for American Civic Renewal (SACR), whose well-positioned, wealthy, white leaders call for instituting white male domination and their version of Christianity in the U.S. after a &#8220;regime&#8221; change.

## US Official in Guatemala for Talks, Says Texas Migrant Law Unconstitutional

date: 2024-03-22, from: VOA News USA

Guatemala city — U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said Thursday that a Texas law giving state authorities the power to arrest and deport migrants who have entered the country illegally is unconstitutional.


"It is our strongly held view as a matter of law that SB4 [the Texas law] ... is unconstitutional and it is our hope and confidence that the courts will strike it down with finality," Mayorkas said during a joint news conference with Guatemala President Bernardo Arevalo in the Guatemalan capital.


A three-judge panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments on the Texas law Wednesday but did not rule. The law is on hold for now.


Mayorkas was in Guatemala to work on the U.S.-led regional strategy toward immigration. He described it as seeking to "build lawful, safe and orderly pathways for people to reach safety from their place of persecution and, at the same time, returning people to their countries as a consequence when they do not take advantage of those lawful pathways."


Among those safe pathways is a U.S. effort to streamline the process for those seeking U.S. asylum in the region through so-called safe mobility offices. They allow migrants to start the process where they are rather than making the dangerous and costly journey to the U.S. border.


Guatemala's safe mobility office, unlike some others like Colombia's, is only open to Guatemalans seeking U.S. protection. One of the requests made by Mayorkas' delegation was that Guatemala allow the safe mobility office to process requests for migrants from other countries, according to a Guatemalan official who requested anonymity because the issue was still under discussion.


Asked during the joint news conference if the U.S. government had asked Guatemala to sign a safe third country agreement, which Guatemala's previous president had agreed to during the Trump administration, Mayorkas did not directly answer. Such an agreement would require migrants from other countries passing through Guatemala to seek protection from the Guatemalan government rather than at the U.S. border.


Asked again in the interview with the AP, Mayorkas said that Guatemala could be a safe destination for some migrants, but that he deferred to Arevalo's administration on that.


The U.S. has sought to improve cooperation with countries along the migrant route, including Guatemala, Mexico, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia and Ecuador, but Mayorkas acknowledged that it has been more challenging in Nicaragua and Venezuela, where the U.S. has strained relations with those governments.


Arévalo explained the talks in similar terms.


"We are operating under the principle that the immigration phenomenon is a regional phenomenon and that for that reason has to have answers framed in the collaborative efforts of different countries," he said.


Mayorkas also offered words of support for the Guatemalan leader, whose election victory last year was challenged and whose party still faces prosecution from Guatemala's attorney general.


"We know that the forces of corruption continue to seek to threaten democracy and the well-being of the people of Guatemala and beyond," Mayorkas said. "The United States stands with President Arevalo and his fight for democracy against the forces of corruption and for the people of Guatemala."

## US Bolstering Philippines Amid Increasing Assertiveness by China

date: 2024-03-22, from: VOA News USA

washington — The U.S. and Philippines will for the first time venture outside Manila’s territorial waters when they begin joint annual combat drills in April, a Philippines government spokesman said Thursday.


Colonel Michael Logico said elements of the Balikatan 2024 drills would be conducted about 22 kilometers (more than 12 nautical miles) off the west coast of Palawan, an island in the archipelago nation that faces a troubled region of the South China Sea.


Chinese ships this month blocked Philippine ships near the Second Thomas Shoal, a reef about 200 kilometers (120 miles) off Palawan that both sides claim.


“The message that we want to send is that we are serious about defending our territory and we have allies,” Logico said at a news conference, according to Philippine media.


Beijing claims most of the South China Sea as its own, putting it in conflict with Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam, all of which border the sea. An international tribunal at The Hague has rejected China's claim.


Blinken visit


U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited the Philippines this week to bolster relations between the two countries and underscore Washington’s commitment to Manila in the face of an increasingly assertive China.


Blinken on Tuesday cited China’s “repeated violations of international law and the rights of the Philippines: water cannons, blocking maneuvers, close shadowing, [and] other dangerous operations.”


China has been building up its military presence in the South China Sea by building on reefs, including the disputed Scarborough Shoal, which it effectively seized from the Philippines in 2012.


Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s government has defiantly sought to assert sovereignty over disputed areas by supplying troops and escorting fishing boats. He told Bloomberg TV on Tuesday that he was not trying to start a conflict but “since the threat has grown, we must do more to defend our territory.”


The Philippines announced last week that it would build a new port with U.S. funding on its northern Batanes Islands, 200 kilometers (about 124 miles) from Taiwan.


While the port is expected to be for civilian use, analysts say it could also be used for military purposes and play an important role in defense — and not only for the Philippines.


Carl Thayer, an emeritus professor of politics at Australia’s University of New South Wales School of Humanities and Social Sciences, emailed VOA: "U.S. and Filipino forces in the northern Philippines would be able to monitor and strike Chinese forces in the event a conflict over Taiwan broke out."


Beijing considers Taiwan a breakaway province that must one day reunite with mainland China, by force if necessary, while the U.S. has vowed to defend Taiwan’s right to self-rule.


But the U.S. mainland is separated from the Taiwan Strait by about 11,000 kilometers (6,000 nautical miles), while mainland China is roughly 160 kilometers (100 miles) from the democratic island.


'Positive impact' for Taiwan


Although the U.S. has military bases that are closer to Taiwan in Hawaii, about 8,150 kilometers (4,400 nautical miles); Guam, about 2,780 kilometers (1,500 nautical miles); and Okinawa, about 740 kilometers (400 nautical miles), analysts say the closer its military assets are to Taiwan, the faster they can respond and resupply in the event of a Chinese attack.


"While the Philippines may not change the situation in the Taiwan Strait, the greater interest in the Philippines by Washington and Tokyo will have a positive impact on Taiwan's security,” said Thomas J. Shattuck, the senior program manager at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perry World House, in an email to VOA.


“It will increase U.S. assets in Taiwan's south," Shattuck said. "It will make it harder for China to dominate in the 'southern theater' of a possible Taiwan conflict. But again, there is more work to be done in this regard."


Marcos last year said the U.S. military would be allowed to use four new military bases in the Philippines, in addition to five where they are already allowed, for training, building infrastructure and pre-positioning supplies, though the access would not be permanent.


Although many countries in the Indo-Pacific region receive U.S. military assistance, the Philippines receives the most.  From 2015 to 2022, Manila received more than $1.14 billion worth of aircraft, armored vehicles, small arms, equipment and training, $475 million of it in aid.


Blinken's trip to the Philippines marks the second time a senior U.S. Cabinet official has visited the nation this month. On March 11, U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo announced fresh investments from U.S. firms of more than $1 billion in the archipelago nation.


Despite China’s more assertive moves in the South China Sea, the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies’ Gregory Poling argues Beijing has lost momentum. Poling, who is senior fellow and director of CSIS’s Southeast Asia Program and Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative, notes that since 2022, Southeast Asian nations such as the Philippines have stopped giving ground to China.


At the same time, he writes in Eurasia Review, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam have resumed development of infrastructure and oil and gas fields in the disputed region, despite China's objections.


China’s provocative moves are one of the main topics expected to be on the agenda in April when President Joe Biden hosts a historic summit with Marcos and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.

## Creature Named for Kermit the Frog Offers Clues on Amphibian Evolution

date: 2024-03-22, from: VOA News USA

washington  — There definitely were no Muppets during the Permian Period, but there was a Kermit — or at least a forerunner of modern amphibians that has been named after the celebrity frog.


Scientists on Thursday described the fossilized skull of a creature called Kermitops gratus that lived in what is now Texas about 270 million years ago. It belongs to a lineage believed to have given rise to the three living branches of amphibians — frogs, salamanders and limbless caecilians.


While only the skull, measuring around 3 cm long, was discovered, the researchers think Kermitops had a stoutly built salamander-like body roughly 15-18 cm long, though salamanders would not evolve for another roughly 100 million years.


Amphibians are one of the four groups of living terrestrial vertebrates, along with reptiles, birds and mammals. The unique features of the Kermitops skull — a blend of archaic and more advanced features — are providing insight into amphibian evolution.


"Kermitops helps us understand the early history of amphibians by revealing there isn't a clear trend of step by step becoming more like the modern amphibian," said Calvin So, a George Washington University paleontology doctoral student and lead author of the study published in the Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society.


The fossil was collected in 1984 near Lake Kemp in Texas and kept in the expansive collection of the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History in Washington but was not thoroughly studied until recently.


Kermitops had a rounded snout, not unlike frogs and salamanders. Preserved in its eye sockets were palpebral bones, or eyelid bones, a feature absent in today's amphibians. Its skull is constructed of roof-like bones, in contrast to the thin and strut-like bones of modern amphibians.


"The length of the skull in front of the eyes is longer than the length of the skull behind the eyes, which differs from the other fossil amphibians living at the same time. We think this might have allowed Kermitops to snap its jaws closed faster, enabling capture of fast insect prey," So said.


The fossil record of early amphibians and their forerunners is spotty, making it difficult to figure out the origins of modern amphibians.


"Kermitops, with its unique anatomy, really exemplifies the importance of continuing to add new fossil data to understanding this evolutionary problem," said National Museum of Natural History paleontologist and study co-author Arjan Mann.


Kermit the Frog was created by the late American puppeteer Jim Henson in 1955, and a Kermit puppet made in the 1970s is in the collection of the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History as an important cultural object.


Kermitops means "Kermit face," a nod to the Muppet's humorous look.


"We thought that the eyelid bones gave the fossil a bug-eyed look, and combined with a lopsided smile produced by slight crushing during the preservation of the fossil, we really thought it looked like Kermit the Frog," So said.


Kermitops belonged to a group called temnospondyls that arose a few tens of millions of years after the first land vertebrates evolved from fish ancestors. The biggest temnospondyls superficially resembled crocodiles, including two that each were around 6 meters in length, Prionosuchus and Mastodonsaurus.


Temnospondyls are considered the progenitor lineage of modern amphibians, Mann said.


Kermitops existed about 20 million years before the worst mass extinction in Earth's history and about 40 million years before the first dinosaurs. It lived alongside other members of the amphibian lineage as well as the impressive sail-backed Dimetrodon, a predator related to the mammalian lineage.


The environment in which Kermitops lived appears to have alternated between warm and humid seasons and hot and arid seasons.


"This environment would be similar to modern-day monsoons that take place in the Southwest U.S. and Southeast Asia," So said.
