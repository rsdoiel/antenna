## Voted in America? This Site Doxed You

date: 2024-11-06, from: 404 Media Group

Voting rolls are technically public records but can be laborious to get hold of. A right-wing site weaponizes that information by allowing anyone, anywhere, to search for a voter’s physical address and party affiliation.

## We’re not in Lake Wobegon any more, Toto

date: 2024-11-06, from: Status-Q blog

For those struggling to understand the US election results, I can only offer the following statistical observations: Roughly half of the world are of below-average intelligence. Roughly half of the world are of above-average gullibility. More than half of the world are on social media. Sometimes these combine in unfortunate ways.

## Book: The Outward Mindset

date: 2024-11-05, from: Accidentally in Code

My coach recommended The Outward Mindset, from the Arbginger institute, same as Leadership and Self Deception (one of my all time most impactful books) and The Anatomy of Peace. It feels in many ways a continuation of those ideas, but more team/business oriented. The first part of the book focuses on the impact of mindset, [&#8230;]

## How to Highlight Text Fragments When Linking

## GHC 9.12.1-alpha2 is now available

date: 2024-11-05, from: Glasgow Haskell Compiler

<h1>GHC 9.12.1-alpha2 is now available</h1>
<h4 class="text-muted">Zubin Duggal - 2024-11-05</h4>

<p>The GHC developers are very pleased to announce the availability
of the second alpha release of GHC 9.12.1. Binary distributions, source
distributions, and documentation are available at <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/9.12.1-alpha2">downloads.haskell.org</a>.</p>
<p>We hope to have this release available via ghcup shortly.</p>
<p>GHC 9.12 will bring a number of new features and improvements, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The new language extension <a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0522-or-patterns.rst">OrPatterns</a> allowing you to combine multiple
pattern clauses into one.</p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0569-multiline-strings.rst">MultilineStrings</a> language extension to allow you to more easily write
strings spanning multiple lines in your source code.</p></li>
<li><p>Improvements to the OverloadedRecordDot extension, allowing the built-in
<code>HasField</code> class to be used for records with fields of non lifted representations.</p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0409-exportable-named-default.rst">NamedDefaults</a> language extension has been introduced allowing you to
define defaults for typeclasses other than <code>Num</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>More deterministic object code output, controlled by the <code>-fobject-determinism</code>
flag, which improves determinism of builds a lot (though does not fully do so)
at the cost of some compiler performance (1-2%). See <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/12935">#12935</a> for the details</p></li>
<li><p>GHC now accepts type syntax in expressions as part of <a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0281-visible-forall.rst">GHC Proposal <span>#281</span></a>.</p></li>
<li><p>The WASM backend now has support for TemplateHaskell.</p></li>
<li><p>… and many more</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A full accounting of changes can be found in the <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/9.12.1-alpha2/docs/users_guide/9.12.1-notes.html">release notes</a>.
As always, GHC’s release status, including planned future releases, can
be found on the GHC Wiki <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/GHC-status">status</a>.</p>
<p>We would like to thank GitHub, IOG, the Zw3rk stake pool,
Well-Typed, Tweag I/O, Serokell, Equinix, SimSpace, the Haskell
Foundation, and other anonymous contributors whose on-going financial
and in-kind support has facilitated GHC maintenance and release
management over the years. Finally, this release would not have been
possible without the hundreds of open-source contributors whose work
comprise this release.</p>
<p>As always, do give this release a try and open a <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/new">ticket</a> if you see
anything amiss.</p>

## Notes on binary soup

date: 2024-11-05, from: Marginallia log

I recently put together a small library called Slop, for intermediate on-disk data representation for the search engine, replacing a few ad-hoc formats I had in place before.
This post isn&rsquo;t so much an attempt to convince anyone else to use this library, as it makes trade-offs catering to a fairly niche use case, but to explore some of its design ideas, as it all came together very nicely, in the hopes that other libraries can draw ideas from it.
