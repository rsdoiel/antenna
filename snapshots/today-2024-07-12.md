## How you feel about the economy may depend on how you vote

date: 2024-07-12, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>Feelings about the economy have been sort of middling, with consumers optimistic about jobs but pessimistic about prices. But there’s another aspect of consumer surveys that doesn’t often get reported — sentiment can skew heavily partisan. Today: how consumers see the world through Republican or Democrat lenses. Plus, we&#8217;ll do the numbers on wholesale prices, hear about a Marathon Oil pollution settlement and learn about a downturn in TV and film production.</p>

## Poll: 60% of US adults support protection of access to in vitro fertilization

date: 2024-07-12, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Relatively few Americans fully endorse the idea that a fertilized egg should have the same rights as a pregnant woman. But a significant share say it describes their views at least somewhat well, according to a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. 


The new survey comes as questions grow around reproductive health access in the continued fallout from the decision by the Supreme Court to end federal abortion protections. The poll found that a solid majority of Americans oppose a federal abortion ban as a rising number support access to abortions for any reason. 


But anti-abortion advocates are increasingly pushing for broader measures that would give rights and protection to embryos and fetuses, which could have massive implications for fertility treatments and other areas of health care. 


The poll suggests that when it comes to more nuanced questions about issues such as in vitro fertilization — which may be affected by the restrictive climate in some states, even though they were not previously considered as part of "abortion" — there is general support for reproductive health protections. But the poll also shows some uncertainty, as Americans are faced with situations that would not have arisen before Roe v. Wade was overturned. 


According to the poll, about 6 in 10 U.S. adults support protecting access to in vitro fertilization, or IVF, a type of fertility treatment in which eggs are combined with sperm outside the body in a lab to form an embryo. Views on banning the destruction of embryos created through IVF are less developed, with 4 in 10 adults expressing a neutral opinion. 


"I believe that it's a woman's right to determine what she wants to do with her pregnancy, and she should be cared for. There should be no question about that," said John Evangelista, 73. "And IVF, I mean, for years, it's saved a lot of people grief — because they want to have a child. Why would you want to limit this for people?" 


Earlier this year, Alabama's largest hospital paused in vitro fertilization treatments, following a court ruling that said frozen embryos are the legal equivalent of children. Soon after, the governor signed legislation shielding doctors from potential legal liability in order to restart procedures in the state. 




But the political damage was done. Democrats routinely cite IVF concerns as part of a larger problem where women in some states are getting worse medical care since the fall of Roe. They link delayed IVF care to cases in states with abortion restrictions, where women must wait until they are very sick to get care. Democrats say these issues show how GOP efforts to overturn Roe have profoundly affected all facets of reproductive care. 


On the other hand, protections for IVF are supported by Americans across the political spectrum: About three-quarters of Democrats and 56% of Republicans favor preserving access to IVF, while about 4 in 10 independents are in favor and just under half, 46%, neither favor nor oppose protecting access. 


For some, their views have been shaped by personal experience with the procedure. 


"I'm about to go through IVF right now, and you're trying to get as many embryos as you can so you can have more chances at having one live birth, or more than that, if you're lucky," said Alexa Voloscenko, 30. "I just don't want people to be having more trouble to access IVF; it's already hard enough." 


But the poll found that about 3 in 10 Americans say that the statement "human life begins at conception, so a fertilized egg is a person with the same rights as a pregnant woman" describes their views on abortion law and policy extremely or very well, while an additional 18% say it describes their views somewhat well. About half say the statement describes their views "not very well" or "not well at all." 


This view is in tension with some aspects of IVF care — in particular, fertility treatments where eggs are fertilized and develop into embryos in a lab. Sometimes, embryos are accidentally damaged or destroyed, and unused embryos may be discarded. 


Republicans are about twice as likely as Democrats or independents to say that the statement about fertilized eggs having the same rights as a pregnant woman describes their views extremely or very well. About 4 in 10 Republicans say that compared with about 2 in 10 Democrats and independents. 


And views are less clear overall on a more specific aspect of policy related to IVF — making it illegal to destroy embryos created during the process. One-quarter of U.S. adults somewhat or strongly favor banning the destruction of embryos created through IVF, while 4 in 10 have a neutral view and about one-third somewhat or strongly oppose it. 


"Human life begins at a heartbeat," said Steven Otey, 73, a Republican who doesn't believe created embryos should be destroyed. "Embryos ... can become babies, we shouldn't be destroying them." 


About 3 in 10 Republicans and roughly one-quarter of Democrats favor banning the destruction of embryos created through IVF. Four in 10 Republicans — and nearly 6 in 10 independents — have a neutral view.

The money will go to factories in eight states (including swing states Michigan and Pennsylvania) and recipients include Stellantis, Volvo, GM, and Harley-Davidson. Most of the funding comes from the Inflation Reduction Act and it could create nearly 3,000 new jobs and save 15,000 union positions at risk of elimination, the Energy Department said. “Agencies across the federal government are rushing to award the rest of their climate cash before the end of Biden’s first term,” <em><em>The Washington Post </em></em><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/07/11/ev-production-biden-electric-vehicle-factories/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_ZjkSGaX5MVfUZx_0mJrFDp3_wQLEZ6uvKb7H946n4P6OZU-ODtWpbeSEXtnoi1P2FuQez" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

The authors found that between 2007 and 2021, the ice-free shipping seasons in the Northwest Passage – which runs through northern Canada and connects the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans – actually shortened significantly because warmer temperatures are causing some of the thickest, oldest Arctic sea ice to flow south into the passage’s “choke points,” posing a high risk to ships. “The variability of shipping season and, in particular, the shortening of the season will impact not only international shipping but also resupply and the cost of food in many Arctic communities, which require a prompt policy response,” the authors wrote.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

Marathon and EPA reach record settlement over Clean Air Act violations</h3><p>Oil giant Marathon must pay a $64.5 million fine for violating the Clean Air Act at its oil and gas operations in North Dakota as part of a settlement with the Environmental Protection Agency, the Justice Department <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-and-epa-announce-2415m-settlement-marathon-oil-reduce-climate-and-health?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_ZjkSGaX5MVfUZx_0mJrFDp3_wQLEZ6uvKb7H946n4P6OZU-ODtWpbeSEXtnoi1P2FuQez" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a>. The company also has to invest $177 million in cleaning up those operations, which could result in the equivalent of 2.3 million tons of reduced pollution over the next five years. The EPA accused Marathon of violating the Clean Air Act at 90 facilities in the state, resulting in huge amounts of methane emissions, as well as illegal pollution linked to respiratory disease.

## Australia’s migration policy and disability discrimination

date: 2024-07-12, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>Australia is sometimes called a &#8220;migration nation,&#8221; as a third of its population was born abroad. That said, people with disabilities are often not welcome. Many foreigners with disabilities or serious medical conditions are routinely denied an Australian visa. But there&#8217;s pressure for policy change. Also on the show: A three-judge panel has concluded that many U.S. college athletes are likely employees and may be protected under federal minimum wage laws.</p>

<hr />
<h2>Let's start from the basics: can you introduce yourself?</h2>
<p>My name is Andrew Stephens. As a child in 1980s small town New Zealand I few in love with the 8-bit micro computers of the time which delightfully allowed my own creations (mostly elaborate text adventures) to be displayed on our TV screen. I never quite lost the thrill of computing so a degree in Computer Science seemed a natural choice. I joined the workforce just as the Internet was taking off and work eventually brought me to Boston, USA where I live now.</p>
<p>My day job is programming C++ but I enjoy stretching myself with projects at home in various media. But what I like most of all is publishing something on the web where everyone can see it.</p>
<h2>What's the story behind your blog?</h2>
<p>I first created a (long lost) web page back in 1996 during my student days. I loved reading other people's stuff on the web and wanted to contribute my own content - it seemed only fair to give something back. I am not sure when I first heard the word blog but I remember thinking it sounded like a stupid idea; nevertheless sometime in the mid 2000s I installed WordPress and started writing just in time to completely miss the heyday of blogging.</p>
<p>My blog has never been popular. Occasionally something I write will get some attention but it soon settles down.</p>
<p>The most modern iteration of my blog was created when I realized that I should be the change I wanted to see. There is no point complaining about the "old internet" fading when we all have the tools to create whatever we want.</p>
<p>The sheep.horse domain name came about because the .horse top level domain had just become available and I couldn't resist such a stupid offering. Of course all the good .horse domains were snapped up by squatters but sheep.horse was available. According to family lore, "sheep horse" was the first multiple word sentence I uttered as I beheld a lama but it holds no other significance.</p>
<p>It has caused some awkward moments professionally though.<br />
"Great interview question, I have a blog post on exactly this technical subject"<br />
"Excellent, what is the URL?"<br />
"ummm, sheep dot horse"</p>
<p>Thankfully it has never failed to get a laugh.</p>
<h2>What does your creative process look like when it comes to blogging?</h2>
<p>I am a big proponent of letting my mind wander when doing something mindless like cleaning or commuting. We spend so much effort minimizing time spent in menial activity but I find such "unproductive" periods both relaxing and useful for generating new ideas. Often times a thought will hit me and rattle around in my head for a few days before I even start to write. Sometimes it is just an opening phrase or a neat metaphor and more than once I have started a piece arguing one side only to talk myself around to the other side. Those pieces often get abandoned - if I don't feel strongly enough to hold an opinion then I probably have little to say on the subject.</p>
<p>I am a slow writer (I don't even touch-type properly) but I try to blat everything out in a single evening. Then I let it sit for at least 12 hours to proof like a loaf of bread while I sleep. Then I read through it again and make revisions, usually making it worse. My wife is a very good proof reader and the best presented articles are the ones that she has corrected.</p>
<p>I write almost all of my text in a plain text editor called TextMate (it is what I am typing into now). Apart from checking my spelling it does not get in the way with fancy features. I find "real" word processors distracting.</p>
<h2>Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe the physical space influences your creativity?</h2>
<p>My home office is pretty comfortable but I have also written on trains and flights with good results. There is something about writing that puts me in my own world. When I was younger I used to work listening to music but now I find the quiet works best for me. It doesn't have to be silence, just background noise without voices.</p>
<p>I find getting out into nature really helps with ideas but I have never managed to write anything sitting outside.</p>
<h2>A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your tech stack?</h2>
<p>I thought you would never ask. The most modern iteration of my blog is statically generated by a python project of my own called gensite that turns a directory structure of markdown files into modern html and rsync's the result to my server which is a DigitalOcean droplet. I even wrote some custom markdown tags so that I could include asides and footnotes. I was aiming for mostly text so I based the style of my blog on Edward Tufte's ideas on document formatting which I was very excited about at the time.</p>
<p>If I was to be honest I would have to admit that I rent a server to run a blog, and maintain a blog to give my server something to do. Writing a static site generator was just to justify both and now I am in too deep to stop now. The actual contents of my site is secondary.</p>
<p>On top of that I have a simple hit counter of my own design. I gradually grew to hate the influence of Google Analytics and vowed not to include it or anything similar on my site because I believe that chasing eyeballs has led us to the state the Internet is in today. However, I am a total hypocrite and found that I really wanted to know if anyone was reading my stuff. So now I just count hits.</p>
<h2>Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would you do anything differently?</h2>
<p>I am happy with the way everything works now - it suits me. But I could not recommend my setup to anyone else. Honestly, the most important part is putting your work somewhere people can access it with minimal fuss. Hosted is fine although I will say that it is important to choose a service that will allow you to migrate your work if you need to part ways with your hosting provider, which is why I think WordPress is a good choice to start with.</p>
<p>One thing I have learned is not to spend too much time futzing with the aesthetics of your blog. Just pick a readable theme - the words are the important part.</p>
<h2>Financial question since the Web is obsessed with money: how much does it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost, or does it generate some revenue? And what's your position on people monetising personal blogs?</h2>
<p>I have never tried to monetize my work - part of me still considers blogging to be contributing to the wacky ball of nonsense called the internet. My total cost is about $10 a month for hosting and the domain. Perhaps I could get cheaper but this is what works for me now.</p>
<h2>Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth checking out? And also, who do you think I should be interviewing next?</h2>
<p>I love passion project single-subject blogs that go into great detail on arcane matters. <a href="http://nzpetesmatteshot.blogspot.com">Matte Shot</a> has been a favorite of mine for a long time.</p>
<p>But I am really interested in the citizen journalists who do rigorous reporting on topics they cover. I have been very interested in cryptocurrency (very much on the "this is all a stupid idea" side of the table) for over a decade and I admire the great reporting done by the likes of <a href="https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/">David Gerard</a> and <a href="https://amycastor.com">Amy Castor</a>. And of course, <a href="https://www.mollywhite.net">Molly White</a>'s writing is amazing as well. I have no idea how they can stay so focused on a world they (rightfully) disdain and I would love to hear what motivates them.</p>
<h2>Final question: is there anything you want to share with us?</h2>
<p>I recently went back to my roots and created a short but elaborate text adventure with illustrations, <a href="https://sheep.horse/voyage_of_the_marigold/">Voyage of the Marigold</a>. Its my love letter to 80s adventure gamebooks and Star Trek, I get an enormous kick when people tell me they have played it.</p>

## Hungary's Orban, a NATO outlier on Ukraine, talks 'peace mission' with Trump

date: 2024-07-12, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban met with Donald Trump on Thursday and the pair discussed the "possibilities of peace," a spokesperson for the prime minister said as he pushes for a cease-fire in Ukraine.


Trump and Orban met at Trump's Mar-a-Lago home in Florida "as the next stop of his peace mission," Orban's spokesperson said. "The discussion was about the possibilities of peace."


Nationalist leader Orban, a longtime Trump supporter, made surprise visits to Kyiv, Moscow and Beijing in the past two weeks on a self-styled "peace mission," angering NATO allies.


His meeting in Moscow with Russian President Vladimir Putin in particular vexed some other NATO members, who said the trip handed legitimacy to Putin when the West wants to isolate him over his war in Ukraine.


Orban traveled to Kyiv before visiting Moscow but did not tell Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy about his mission to Russia, Zelenskiy said, dismissing Orban's ambition of playing the peacemaker.


"Not all the leaders can make negotiations. You need to have some power for this," Zelenskiy said earlier at a news conference at the NATO summit.


White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan, when asked about Orban's initiative, said Ukraine would be rightly concerned about any attempt to negotiate a peace deal without involving Kyiv.


"Whatever adventurism is being undertaken without Ukraine's consent or support is not something that's consistent with our policy, the foreign policy of the United States," Sullivan said.


Orban's self-styled peace mission has also irked many members of the European Union, whose rotating presidency Hungary took over at the start of this month.


The Hungarian embassy in Washington declined to comment on the planned meeting with Trump, which was first reported by Bloomberg.


Orban has been attending a NATO summit hosted by Democratic President Joe Biden. Hungary's delegation voiced opposition to key NATO positions, while not blocking the alliance from taking action.


Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto told Reuters on Wednesday that Hungary believes a second Trump presidency would boost hopes for peace in Ukraine.


Orban hoped to bring an end to the war through peace talks involving both Russia and Ukraine, according to Szijjarto.


Trump has said he would quickly end the war. He has not offered a detailed plan to achieve that, but Reuters reported last month that advisers to the former president had presented him with a plan to end the war in part by making future aid to Kyiv conditional on Ukraine joining peace talks.


In the past several months, foreign officials have regularly sought meetings with Trump and his key advisers to discuss his foreign policy should he beat Biden in the November 5 election. Polls show Trump widening his lead over Biden.


One adviser, Keith Kellogg, has met with several high-ranking foreign officials on the sidelines of the NATO summit, Reuters reported this week.


NATO frustration


Orban appeared isolated at the opening of a NATO meeting on Ukraine on Thursday, sitting alone while other leaders talked in a huddle.


Two European diplomats told Reuters that NATO allies were frustrated with Orban's actions around the summit but stressed that he had not blocked the alliance from taking action on Ukraine.


Multiple EU leaders made clear Orban was not speaking for the bloc in his discussions on the war in Ukraine.


"I don't think there's any point in having conversations with authoritarian regimes that are violating international law," said Finnish President Alexander Stubb.


Hungary also diverged from its NATO allies on China, which the alliance said is an enabler of Russia's war effort and poses challenges to security. Hungary does not want NATO to become an "anti-China" bloc, and will not support it doing so, Szijjarto said Thursday.

## US, South Korea sign nuclear guideline strategy to deter and respond to North Korea

date: 2024-07-12, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The U.S. commitment to deterrence against North Korea is backed by the full range of U.S. capabilities, including nuclear, U.S. President Joe Biden told South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol in a meeting Thursday on the sidelines of a NATO summit.


The two leaders also authorized a guideline on establishing an integrated system of extended deterrence for the Korean peninsula to counter nuclear and military threats from North Korea, Yoon's office said.


The guideline formalizes the deployment of U.S. nuclear assets on and around the Korean peninsula to deter and respond to potential nuclear attacks by the North, Yoon's deputy national security adviser Kim Tae-hyo told a briefing in Washington.


"It means U.S. nuclear weapons are specifically being assigned to missions on the Korean Peninsula," Kim said.


Earlier Biden and Yoon issued a joint statement announcing the signing of the Guidelines for Nuclear Deterrence and Nuclear Operations on the Korean Peninsula.


"The presidents reaffirmed their commitments in the U.S.-ROK Washington Declaration and highlighted that any nuclear attack by the DPRK against the ROK will be met with a swift, overwhelming and decisive response," it said.


DPRK is short for North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. ROK refers to South Korea's formal name, the Republic of Korea.


Cheong Seong-Chang, a security strategy expert at the Sejong Institute and a strong advocate of South Korea's own nuclear armament, said the new nuclear guideline is significant progress that fundamentally changes the way the allies will respond to a nuclear threat from North Korea.


"The problem is, the only thing that will give South Korea full confidence is a promise from the U.S. of an immediate nuclear retaliation in the event of nuclear use by the North, but that is simply impossible," Cheong said.


"That is the inherent limitation of nuclear deterrence," he said, adding whether the nuclear guideline will survive a change in U.S. administration is also questionable.


Yoon's office said the guideline itself is classified.


North Korea has openly advanced its nuclear weapons policy by codifying their use in the event of perceived threat against its territory and enshrining the advancement of nuclear weapons capability in the constitution last year.


Earlier this year, it designated South Korea as its "primary foe" and vowed to annihilate its neighbor for colluding with the United States to wage war against it, in a dramatic reversal of peace overtures they made in 2018.


Both Seoul and Washington deny any aggressive intent against Pyongyang but say they are fully prepared to counter any aggression by the North and have stepped up joint military drills in recent months.


Yoon reaffirmed South Korea's support for Ukraine, pledging to double its contribution to a NATO trust fund from the $12 million it provided in 2024, his office said. The fund enables short-term non-lethal military assistance and long-term capability-building support, NATO says.


It made no mention of any direct military support for Ukraine. Yoon's office has said it was considering weapons supply for Kyiv, reversing its earlier policy of limiting its assistance to humanitarian in nature.

## NATO, Pacific partners strengthen ties at summit

date: 2024-07-12, from: VOA News USA

washington — NATO set out Thursday to deepen relations with key Indo-Pacific partners, meeting with leaders from Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea a day after all 32 NATO allies called out China for its support of Russia's illegal war against Ukraine in a sternly worded communique.


During a working session, NATO and its Indo-Pacific partners strengthened plans and developed strategies to face growing threats in the Pacific region, including North Korean missile launches and China's steady stream of technology and raw materials to Russia that have allowed President Vladimir Putin to replace his losses on the battlefield.


U.S. officials said the Indo-Pacific partners' attendance sent a message to China that democratic alliances will stand up for the rule of law, no matter where an aggressor tries to break it.


"NATO also recognizes that threats from the Indo-Pacific, whether it's the DPRK [North Korea] or the PRC [China] supporting Russia in their aggression against Ukraine, we cannot avoid," Jason Israel, National Security Council senior director for defense policy, Israel told VOA.


In a final communique signed by all 32 allies, NATO called China a "decisive enabler" of Russia's war and urged Beijing to cease its support. 


"The PRC cannot enable the largest war in Europe in recent history without this negatively impacting its interests and reputation," the leaders wrote.


They also expressed concerns about Beijing's space capabilities and nuclear arsenal.


NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on Wednesday told reporters that "China is propping up Russia's war economy" and "increas[ing] the threat Russia holds to Europe and NATO security."


"China provides dual-use equipment, microelectronics and a lot of other tools which are enabling Russia to build the missiles, to build bombs, to build the aircraft, to build the weapons they're using to attack Ukraine," he added.


Asked by VOA whether the statement was a strong enough message to deter China from continuing to support Russia, Stoltenberg replied in the news conference that Wednesday's declaration was "the strongest message that NATO allies have ever sent on China's contributions to Russia's illegal war against Ukraine."


Some allies on Thursday cautioned the alliance against using the narrowly worded communique as a springboard to make NATO appear "anti-China."


"NATO is a defense alliance. ... We can't organize it into an anti-China bloc," Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto told Hungarian state television on the sidelines of the summit.


However, defense expert Bradley Bowman, the senior director for the Foundation for Defense of Democracies' Center on Military and Political Power, said calling out China was long overdue for the bloc.


"Europeans are dying in Europe in a war of aggression from the Kremlin with the support of Iran, North Korea and China, period," he said.


U.S. President Joe Biden on Wednesday said NATO must counter Russia's ramping up of defense production — made possible by help from China, North Korea and Iran — by continuing to invest more in Ukraine's and NATO's own defense production.


"We cannot allow the alliance to fall behind," Biden said. 


China insists that it does not provide military aid to Russia, despite maintaining strong trade ties with Moscow.


On Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian accused NATO of "breaching its boundary, expanding its mandate, reaching beyond its defense zone and stoking confrontation."

## Half a million Houston-area homes, businesses still won't have power into next week

date: 2024-07-12, from: VOA News USA

HOUSTON — About half a million Houston-area homes and businesses will still be without electricity next week, the city's largest utility said Thursday, stoking the frustration of hot and weary residents and leading a top state official to call the pace of recovery from Hurricane Beryl "not acceptable."


Jason Ryan, executive vice president of CenterPoint Energy, said power has been restored to more than 1 million homes and businesses since Beryl made landfall in Texas on Monday. And the company expects to get hundreds of thousands of more customers back online by Sunday. But many more will wait much longer.


"We know that we still have a lot of work to do," Ryan said during a meeting of the Texas Public Utility Commission, the state's utility regulation agency. "We will not stop the work until it is done."


Ryan said that the prolonged outages into next week would be concentrated along the Gulf Coast, close to where Beryl came ashore.


During a news conference Thursday, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick pushed CenterPoint to work faster to relieve residents who have been without power for days and have been forced to seek air conditioning in community cooling centers and meals from food and water distribution points.


Compounding their discomfort was a new band of rainstorms that swept through the Houston area Thursday. The rain provided brief relief from the heat before temperatures were expected to creep back above 32 Celsius over the weekend.


"Folks, that is not acceptable," that half a million customers could still be without power a week after the storm, said Patrick, who is acting governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is in Asia on an economic development trip.


Patrick and Abbott have both promised that the state will investigate the storm response. Texas has dealt with several major storms over the past two decades.


"We are always going to have big storms in this area. ... We have to be sure they were prepared as they should have been," Patrick said. "It's a terrible situation for people who are in this heat."




Patrick and Abbott also sparred with the White House over the timing of requests for federal declarations for the area, whether they would delay help for storm cleanup and other emergency expenses.


The Category 1 hurricane — the weakest type — knocked out power to around 2.7 million customers after it made landfall, according to PowerOutage.us.


Residents have been frustrated that such a relatively weak storm could cause such disruption at the height of summer.


Some have criticized the utility and state and city officials as not ready for the storm, the slow restoration process, and that CenterPoint's online map has been woefully inaccurate, sometimes showing entire neighborhoods as restored when they were still without power.


The company acknowledged that most of the 12,000 workers it brought in to help the recovery were not in the Houston area when the storm arrived. Initial forecasts had the storm blowing ashore much farther south along the Gulf Coast, near the Texas-Mexico border, before it headed toward Houston.


Ryan said the vast majority of outages were caused by falling trees and tree limbs, and workers had to conduct damage surveys on some 13,700 kilometers of power lines.


Beryl has been blamed for at least eight U.S. deaths — one each in Louisiana and Vermont, and six in Texas. Earlier, 11 died in the Caribbean.


The storm's lingering impact for many in Texas, however, was the wallop to the power supply that left much of the nation's fourth-largest city sweltering.


Mallary Cohee said her duplex in New Caney, about 48 kilometers north of Houston, has been without power since Monday. She said her "little country neighborhood" is a "hot mess" of downed trees, so she's staying at a Houston hotel.


Cohee said she initially felt she could withstand the lack of air conditioning because she managed to get by without it in summer while serving a two-year prison sentence.


"I thought, 'I can do this. I can ride it. If I can do time with no heat, no AC in there, I could possibly make it,'" Cohee said. "But it's a whole different ballgame when you don't even have a fan to plug in."


Clean water was also becoming an issue. More than 160 boil water notices were in effect across the area, and more than 100 wastewater treatment plants were offline Thursday, said Nim Kidd, chief of the Texas Division of Emergency Management.


The Texas Hospital Association said a "vast majority" of hospitals in the area are dealing with some kind of issue caused by Beryl, including water and wind damage, power and internet connection problems, staffing shortages or transportation problems.


Carrie Kroll, the association's vice president of advocacy, public policy and political strategy, said hospitals are getting an "extremely high" number of people coming to emergency departments with symptoms of heat stroke and injuries from cleaning up debris.


By Wednesday night, hospitals had already sent more than 100 patients who couldn't be released to homes with no power to a Houston sports and event complex with an area set up to hold up to 250, Office of Emergency Management spokesman Brent Taylor said.

## Trump lawyers lay out case for reversing  hush money conviction

date: 2024-07-12, from: VOA News USA

new york — Donald Trump's lawyers on Thursday said Manhattan prosecutors improperly relied on evidence of the former U.S. president's official acts in securing his conviction on criminal charges stemming from hush money paid to a porn star.


In a court filing dated July 10 but made public on Thursday, defense lawyers said the guilty verdict should be set aside following the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling on presidential immunity.


They said evidence of official acts that were improperly shown to the jury included Trump's conversations with former White House aide Hope Hicks and some of his Twitter posts while he was in office.


"The use of official-acts evidence was a structural error under the federal Constitution," defense lawyers Todd Blanche and Emil Bove wrote. "The jury's verdicts must be vacated."


Justice Juan Merchan this month delayed Trump's sentencing by two months after defense lawyers said the justices' July 1 ruling that presidents cannot face criminal charges over official acts meant prosecutors should not have shown evidence from Trump's time in the White House at trial.


They said that meant the Manhattan jury's May 30 guilty verdict in the first-ever criminal trial of a U.S. president could not stand.


Prosecutors with Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office have until July 24 to respond. They have previously called Trump's arguments meritless but agreed to push back the sentencing.


Legal experts said Trump faces steep odds of getting the hush money conviction overturned because much of the case involves conduct before his presidency and the evidence from his time in the White House has more to do with private conduct.


The Supreme Court's ruling stemmed from a separate case Trump faces on federal charges involving his efforts to undo his 2020 election loss to Joe Biden. It all but ensured Trump would not face trial in that case before the November 5 election.


Trump's lawyers are also seeking a pause in a third criminal case on charges of mishandling classified documents because of the ruling. Trump has pleaded not guilty to all charges.


In the hush money case, Trump was found guilty of falsifying business records to cover up his former lawyer's $130,000 payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels to remain quiet about a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump. Prosecutors say the payment was designed to boost his presidential campaign in 2016, when he defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.


The Supreme Court's decision said evidence of a president's official acts cannot be used in a prosecution on private matters.


Merchan has said he will decide on Trump's arguments by September 6. If the conviction is upheld, Trump will be sentenced on September 18, less than seven weeks before the election.

## Biden rejects calls to quit the race, vows to ‘finish the job because so much is at stake’

date: 2024-07-12, from: VOA News USA

washington — At his first solo news conference in eight months, U.S. President Joe Biden spent most of an hour responding to questions about the growing movement within his own Democratic Party to get him to step aside because of concerns he may be in cognitive decline.


"I've taken three significant and intense neurological exams" as recently as February, Biden said. "They say I'm in good shape."


If any of his doctors "think I should have a neurological exam again, I’ll do it," he said.


Aging "creates a little bit of wisdom," added Biden, who is 81, maintaining he could handle the stress of the job for another term.


The president was asked what happened to his promise during the 2020 campaign to be a bridge candidate to a younger generation of Democrats, which was interpreted at the time as indicating he would not run again in 2024.


Biden replied, "What changed was the gravity of the situation I inherited, in terms of the economy, our foreign policy and domestic division."


He also said if former President Donald Trump returns to the White House for a second term, American democracy would be imperiled.


In his responses to questions from about a dozen reporters, Biden touted his accomplishments in handling foreign crises and the economy. But what will remain in the headlines after his latest public remarks will be his response to the biggest crisis he currently faces, which comes from within his own party.


Asked if he would stay in the race if his team presented data indicating Vice President Kamala Harris had a better chance to defeat Trump, the president said he would fight on unless his aides told him "there’s no way you can win." He then dramatically whispered from the lectern: "No poll says that."


"I think it was a good day for Mr. Biden, the best day he’s had in quite some time. Will it change the course of the stream, or will it just be a stone in the stream that diverts the current without fundamentally changing its course? I don’t know," William Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and who served as deputy assistant for domestic policy to President Bill Clinton, told VOA.


There were a couple of gaffes during the nearly hourlong event.




He referred to Harris as "Vice President Trump" before saying he had picked the former California senator as his running mate twice because she’s ready to step in as president.


At another point, Biden said, "I’m taking the advice of my commander-in-chief," apparently referring to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. As president, Biden himself is the commander-in-chief.


Calls for Biden to drop out have expanded beyond at least 16 Democratic Party members of the House. The prominent actor George Clooney on Wednesday, in an opinion piece in The New York Times, called on Biden to be a hero for democracy again by dropping out of the rematch against the Republican former president.


Clooney, who last month hosted the single largest fundraiser supporting any Democrat ever, said the candidate who appeared at that event was not the Joe Biden of 2016 or 2020, but "the same man we all witnessed at the debate" against Trump on June 27.


Even many of the president’s most prominent supporters have characterized that debate as a disaster for the incumbent. White House and campaign officials have repeatedly insisted that it was just "a bad night" for the veteran politician.


Hours before Thursday’s news conference, introducing Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelenskyy at a NATO event, Biden announced to the audience, "Ladies and gentlemen, President Putin," referring to the Russian leader who is waging a war against neighbor Ukraine.


"Going to beat President Putin, President Zelenskyy. I am so focused on beating Putin," Biden said while correcting himself. He made light of that mistake when asked about it at the news conference.


Biden’s signature mix-ups were reminiscent of President Ronald Reagan’s White House Rose Garden welcoming in 1982 for Liberian President Samuel Doe. Reagan introduced him as "Chairman Moe."


In a debate two years later with the Democratic Party nominee, Walter Mondale, Reagan appeared lost for words and fumbled with his notes, but he went on in November of 1984 to capture a second term with a landslide victory over Mondale.


Reagan announced in 1994 that he had been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease but in the years after his death in 2004, one of his sons and some former officials acknowledged there were clear signs of the president’s cognitive decline in his second term.


Top officials at the United Auto Workers union met on Thursday to discuss their concerns about Biden’s candidacy, the Reuters news agency reported, attributing the information to three sources familiar with the matter.


The 400,000-member union endorsed the Democratic Party incumbent in January. It is especially influential in industrial states, including the swing state of Michigan, which pollsters consider a must-win for Biden if he hopes to be reelected.




"I know he can win Michigan," Democratic Senator Debbie Stabenow said of Biden and her home state after the president’s senior advisers earlier Thursday briefed Senate Democrats on Capitol Hill.


More Democrats held off making public assessments of their incumbent's suitability for a second term until after Thursday evening’s presidential news conference and the end of the NATO summit, which Biden hosted in Washington.


Immediately after the press event concluded, another Democratic Party congressman -- Jim Himes of Connecticut, the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee -- added his voice to the rising chorus expressing a loss of confidence in Biden’s ability to win reelection.


"The 2024 election will define the future of American democracy, and we must put forth the strongest candidate possible to confront the threat posed by Trump’s promised MAGA authoritarianism," Himes said in a statement. "I no longer believe that is Joe Biden."


After Himes’ statement was released, another Democratic congressman, Scott Peters of California, also called for Biden to exit the race.


"The stakes are high, and we are on a losing course. My conscience requires me to speak up," said Peters in a statement.


Referring to Biden’s several verbal stumbles at the news conference, NPR Weekend Edition Saturday host Scott Simon put it this way in a social media posting while Biden was still talking: "Here’s the problem: even if [Biden’s] verbal slips are quickly corrected and totally understandable, people are listening for them now. Even scoring and numbering them. What used to be dismissed and understood is certainly heard differently."


The president, in response to one reporter on Thursday, said there are others in his party who could beat Trump as well, but this close to next month’s Democratic Party nominating convention and November’s election, "it would be hard to start from scratch."

## Progress Is in Flight to Reduce Santa Barbara Airport’s Impacts

## Qualcomm’s Oryon core: a long time in the making

date: 2024-07-11, from: OS News

In 2019, a startup called Nuvia came out of stealth mode. Nuvia was notable because its leadership included several notable chip architects, including one who used to work for Apple. Apple chips like the M1 drew recognition for landing in the same performance neighborhood as AMD and Intel’s offerings while offering better power efficiency. Nuvia had similar goals, aiming to create a power efficient core that could could surpass designs from AMD, Apple, Arm, and Intel. Qualcomm acquired Nuvia in 2021, bringing its staff into Qualcomm’s internal CPU efforts. Bringing on Nuvia staff rejuvenated Qualcomm’s internal CPU efforts, which led to the Oryon core in Snapdragon X Elite. Oryon arrives nearly five years after Nuvia hit the news, and almost eight years after Qualcomm last released a smartphone SoC with internally designed cores. For people following Nuvia’s developments, it has been a long wait. ↫ Chips and Cheese Now that the Snapdragon X Elite and Pro chips are finally making their way to consumers, we&#8217;re also finally starting to see proper deep-dives into the brand new hardware. Considering this will set the standard for ARM laptops for a long time to come &#8211; including easy availability of powerful ARM Linux laptops &#8211; I really want to know every single quirk or performance statistic we can find.

## Jill Biden takes initiative in White House and on campaign trail

date: 2024-07-11, from: VOA News USA

washington  — First lady Jill Biden is supporting her husband, President Joe Biden, as he tries to salvage his reelection campaign after a debate performance left a growing number of members of his own party questioning his decision to stay in the race.


“She’s his biggest supporter and champion, because she believes in him, and she fears for the future of our country if it goes the other way,” Elizabeth Alexander, the first lady's communications director, said this week. “Just as he’s always supported her career, she supports his.”


Jill Biden has been campaigning with her husband this week but also on her own at several stops.


“For all the talk out there about this race, Joe has made it clear that he’s all in,” she said at each of her solo campaign stops.


“That’s the decision he’s made. And just as he has always supported my career, I am all in, too. I know you are, too, or you wouldn’t be here today,” she told crowds in North Carolina, Florida and Georgia.


As first lady, Jill Biden has spearheaded initiatives for military members and their families as well as cancer treatment. As a longtime teacher, she also prioritized programs focused on education.


She has been involved in Joining Forces, a White House designed initiative to support military and veteran families, caregivers and survivors, according to the White House website. Joining Forces focuses on projects such as improving military spouse employment and military child education. In her first two years as first lady, Biden visited 24 military installations.


She has also been a part of Cancer Moonshot, a program rejuvenated by the Bidens. According to its website, the project is committed to “ending cancer as we know it” by preventing more than 4 million cancer deaths by 2047. According to the American Cancer Society, a little more than 600,000 people died of cancer in 2021.


The goals of Cancer Moonshot include increasing access to screenings and avoiding harmful environmental exposures.


In addition to being the U.S. first lady, Biden is also an educator. Part of her focus while in the White House has been on academic initiatives aimed at recruiting and retaining teachers and lowering education costs.


When Joe Biden became vice president under President Barack Obama, Jill Biden became the first-ever second lady to hold a paying job outside the White House. As first lady she has continued to teach writing at Northern Virginia Community College, just south of Washington, where she taught full time while her husband was vice president.   


“Many of my students don’t know that I have two jobs,” she said in 2021.  


Biden is very familiar with life in Washington, since her husband spent 36 years in the U.S. Senate and eight years as vice president under Obama.  


Joe Biden’s 2020 election victory gave Jill Biden the distinction of being the first presidential spouse to have earned a doctorate.


Dr. Biden, 73, was born in New Jersey and grew up in the northern suburbs of Philadelphia. She earned her doctorate in education from the University of Delaware.  


Life with Joe Biden was complicated from the start. She was going through a divorce. He was grieving, raising two young sons alone after his wife and baby daughter died in a car crash. Jill and Joe married, after Joe asked five times.   


“And the fifth time, I finally said to her, 'Jill, my Irish pride has gotten ahold of me. This is the last time I'm gonna ask you,” Biden said on the “Rachael Ray Show.” “I said, ‘You don't have to tell me when you will marry me, just if you'll marry me.’ She said yes.”


Four years later, Jill gave birth to a daughter, Ashley. Tragedy would strike again in 2015 when Joe Biden’s 46-year-old son, Beau, died of brain cancer.


“This is personal for me and my husband Joe,” she said.


She was the author of the 2020 children’s book Joey: The Story of Joe Biden. It was about her husband’s early years, his competitiveness and resilience after being mocked over his stutter.    


She displayed that protective streak during a campaign rally in March 2023, using her body on two occasions to block a protester from reaching her husband on stage.  


Although they call the tiny Mid-Atlantic state of Delaware their home, Jill Biden has followed her husband through his career as U.S. senator, vice president and president. Now, she hopes to see him in the White House for another four years.

## Iconography of the X Window System: the boot stipple

date: 2024-07-11, from: OS News

For the uninitiated, what are we looking at? Could it be the Moiré Error from Doom? Well, no. You are looking at (part of) the boot up screen for the X Window System, specifically the pattern it uses as the background of the root window. This pattern is technically called a stipple. What you’re seeing is pretty important and came to symbolize a lot for me as a computer practitioner. ↫ Matt T. Proud The X bootup pattern is definitely burnt onto my retina, as it probably is for a lot of late &#8217;90s, early 2000s Linux users. Setting up X correctly, and more importantly, not breaking it later, was almost an art at the time, so any time you loaded up your PC and this pattern didn&#8217;t greet you, you&#8217;d get this sinister feeling in the pit of your stomach. There was now a very real chance you were going to have to debug your X configuration file, and nobody &#8211; absolutely nobody &#8211; liked doing that, and if you did, you&#8217;re lying. Matt T. Proud dove into the history of the X stipple, and discovered it&#8217;s been part of X since pretty much the very beginning, and even more esoteric X implementations, like the ones used by Solaris or the various commercial versions, have the stipple. He also discovered several other variants of the stipple included in X, so there is a chance your memory might be just a tiny bit different. The stipple eventually disappeared at around 2008 or so, it disappeared as part of the various efforts to modernise, sanitise, and speed up the Linux boot process on desktops. On modern distributions still using X, you won&#8217;t encounter it anymore by default, but in true X fashion, the code is still there and you can easily bring it back using a flag specifically designed for it, -retro, that you can use with startx or your X init file. There&#8217;s a ton more information in Proud&#8217;s excellent article, but this one paragraph made me smile: I will remark that in spite of my job being a software engineer, I had never spent a lot of time looking at the source code for the X Server (XFree86 or X.Org) before. It’s really nuts to see that a lot of the architecture from X10R3 and X11R1 still persists in the code today, which is a statement that can be said in deep admiration for legacy code but also disturbance from the power of old decisions. Without having looked at the internals of any Wayland implementation, I can sympathize sight unseen with the sentiments that some developers have toward the X Window System: the code is a dead end. I say that with the utmost respect to the X Window System as a technology and an ecosystem. I’ll keep using X, and I will be really sad when it’s no longer possible for me to do so for one reason or another, as I’m extremely attached to it quirks. But it’s clear the future is limited. ↫ Matt T. Proud We all have great &#8211; and not so great &#8211; memories of X, but I am really, really happy I no longer have to use it.

## Exclusive: Iran struggled to arrange US ballot stations for presidential election runoff

date: 2024-07-11, from: VOA News USA

washington — Iran struggled to arrange absentee voting in the U.S. for the second round of its presidential election Friday, as a VOA investigation found that Tehran’s U.S. ballot stations suffered more setbacks than those it organized for the election’s first round a week prior.


Tehran declared relative moderate former Iranian Health Minister Masoud Pezeshkian the winner of the July 5 runoff against ultraconservative former nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili.




Iran's interests section office in Washington began the absentee voting operation on U.S. soil by setting up ballot stations for the election’s first round on June 28.


That first-round operation suffered some setbacks, according to an initial VOA investigation. Three of the 33 ballot station addresses listed online by the interests section office just hours before voting started quickly canceled their voting events under pressure from Iranian American activists and protesters who oppose Iran’s authoritarian Islamist rulers.




VOA’s new investigation found that Iran’s U.S.-based agents encountered deeper problems with organizing ballot stations for the July 5 runoff. The findings conflict with Iran’s assertion, published by state news agency IRNA, that those agents were able to “increase” the number of ballot stations for the runoff, thanks to the “welcome” of Iranians living in the U.S.


Almost half of the June 28 ballot stations were not relisted for use in the runoff, indicating difficulties for the organizers in rebooking some of the first-round venues.


VOA also assessed that for the runoff, the locations where voting was canceled doubled, while ballot stations whose addresses were hidden to keep protesters away increased. Those addresses were accessible only by contacting a listed phone number or email address.


A VOA review of the July 5 ballot station list, which was updated multiple times that day, found that it included street addresses of 32 venues. One additional venue near Boston had been exposed by activists online after they apparently accessed its unlisted address via email. The listed addresses included those of 16 hotels, six Islamic centers, and a variety of other venues.


VOA assessed that voting events proceeded in at least 17 venues on the July 5 list, based on verbal confirmations from venue staff who answered phone calls that day and on images of the sites posted by activists on social media and deemed to be credible.






Fifteen of the identified July 5 ballot station locations had not been listed for the election’s first round, while 18 locations from the first round were relisted for round two.




One of them was the main ballot station, in Iran’s Washington interests section office. That is where a VOA Persian reporter observed about 90 to 100 people entering the venue in a 10-hour period on July 5. Three of them told the reporter that most of the visitors were filling out passport applications or other paperwork rather than voting.


One man was at the office with his wife on July 5 specifically to vote. He told the VOA Persian reporter that voting is a pillar of democracy and could lead to positive change for Iran.




Many diaspora Iranians denounced Iran’s presidential election as a sham, while the State Department called it neither free nor fair. The Islamic republic’s ruling clerics permit only loyalists of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to run for offices such as president and parliament, which are subservient to him on key policy issues.


Iranian American activists opposed to Tehran's U.S. ballot stations protested peacefully on June 28 outside two venues that canceled voting events, and those activist told VOA they successfully appealed to a third to do the same. None of the three venues were relisted for the July 5 vote.


One of them was the Congregational Church of Weston near Boston. Pastoral Resident Megan Strouse told VOA in an interview that those who rented the church on June 28 identified themselves as from Boston’s Iranian American community.


"We thought their intention was to hold an election event for their local community, for a board or something of that nature," Strouse said. "That morning, we realized what the event was, and our senior pastor made the call to ask the renters to stop their event, as it did not align with our mission and purpose as a religious organization."


VOA emailed the independently owned Biltmore Hotel Oklahoma in Oklahoma City on July 3, requesting confirmation of its use as a June 28 ballot station after Iran had identified it as such, and asking whether the hotel would host a voting event for the runoff. There was no response from the hotel, and it was left off the second-round ballot station list published on July 5.


In another sign of the difficulties that Iran faced in its U.S. ballot station operation for July 5, VOA determined that voting was canceled in three of the 33 identified venues.




Hotel staff who answered the phones at the Embassy Suites by Hilton Seattle North Lynnwood in Washington and at Marriott’s The Westin Tysons Corner in Virginia confirmed that the runoff voting events were called off following protest activity.


Protesters also found the unlisted address of a second-round mobile ballot station that briefly operated out of a police station parking lot in the Boston suburb of Woburn. They posted social media images indicating the event was called off after they showed up at the site.




Three additional U.S. cities initially appeared in Iran’s July 5 list as numbered voting precincts, but they were removed in updated versions of the list with no ballot station addresses having been displayed, indicating that voting plans for those locations had been canceled as well. These were Ontario, California; Oklahoma City; and Sterling, Virginia.


Iran also hid the addresses of July 5 mobile voting stations that it listed for three parts of Los Angeles and for New York’s Manhattan borough and the Boston area, forcing both prospective voters and protesters to use the listed contact information for those stations to find their addresses. For the June 28 vote, only the mobile station for Manhattan had an unlisted address.


U.S. advocacy group National Iranian American Council, which has adopted a positive view of Pezeshkian, Iran’s incoming president, decried what it called the protesters’ intimidation and harassment of Iranian Americans who voted at U.S. ballot stations on June 28.


"We cannot be a community that stands for voter suppression and attacks against Iranians who dare to express their political agency," NIAC said in a July 2 statement.


Andrew Ghalili, a senior policy analyst with National Union for Democracy in Iran, an Iranian American advocacy group that opposes the Islamic republic, told VOA that those who organized and participated in the U.S. voting events were helping the Iranian government boost its legitimacy at home and abroad.


But Ghalili said the boycott of the vote by most diaspora Iranians and protest actions by some of them showed that they have lost faith in the Islamic republic’s ability to reform itself through elections.


"Some of the protesters’ goals were accomplished, in terms of making Iran struggle with its election messaging, so I think they should be pleased with their efforts," he said.


Soran Khateri of VOA’s Persian service contributed to this report from Washington.

## Palestinians say Microsoft unfairly closing their accounts

Microsoft says they violated its terms of service &#8211; a claim they dispute. ↫ Mohamed Shalaby and Joe Tidy at the BBC Checking up on your family members to see if they survived another day of an ongoing genocide doesn&#8217;t seem like something that should be violating any terms of any services, but that&#8217;s just me.

## “Majority of websites and mobile apps use dark patterns”

date: 2024-07-11, from: OS News

A global internet sweep that examined the websites and mobile apps of 642 traders has found that 75,7% of them employed at least one dark pattern, and 66,8% of them employed two or more dark patterns. Dark patterns are defined as practices commonly found in online user interfaces and that steer, deceive, coerce, or manipulate consumers into making choices that often are not in their best interests. ↫ International Consumer Protection and Enforcement Network Dark patterns are everywhere, and it&#8217;s virtually impossible to browse the web, use certain types of services, or install mobile applications, without having to dodge and roll just to avoid all kinds of nonsense being thrown at you. It&#8217;s often not even ads that make the web unusable &#8211; it&#8217;s all the dark patterns tricking you into viewing ads, entering into a subscription, enabling notifications, sharing your email address or whatever, that&#8217;s the real reason. This is why one of the absolute primary demands I have for the next version of OSNews is zero dark patterns. I don&#8217;t want any dialogs begging you to enable ads, no modal windows demanding you sign up for a newsletter, no popups asking you to enable notifications, and so on &#8211; none of that stuff. My golden standard is &#8220;your computer, your rules&#8221;, and that includes your right to use ad blockers or anything else to change the appearance or functioning of our website on your computer. It&#8217;d be great if dark patterns became illegal somehow, but it would be incredibly difficult to write any legislation that would properly cover these practices.

## Climate change, population growth may threaten global food security

date: 2024-07-11, from: VOA News USA

nairobi, kenya — The combination of climate change and a growing world population may threaten global food security. As the United Nations marks World Population Day, changes in agriculture, especially in Africa, may be the only way forward.


The global population is expected to grow over the next 60 years, from 8.2 billion today to 10.3 billion in the 2080s. Much of that growth will occur in Africa, where many countries still have high fertility rates.


The United Nations Population Fund said climate change is expected to exacerbate global inequalities and trigger national and international migration.


U.N. agencies say 1 billion of the 1.3 billion people living in Africa struggle to afford healthy diets and hunger worsened between 2019 and 2022.


Food needs grow, farmland shrinks


Africa's farmland has been shrinking because of persistent drought, while the growing population leaves less space to farm.


Chris Ojiewo, principal scientist at the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center, said African farmers need to produce a lot of food in small spaces to feed the growing population.


"We cannot even think of a human way ... or ethical way to stop population growth, so let it grow but let us people able to produce more within a small area," said Ojiewo. "For example, where we are able to produce only one ton of maize per hectare, why don't we work and that is what we are doing to improve this productivity to go beyond 1 ton to 2 to 3 to 4 to 5 to 10 tons per hectare, considering developing varieties but also production systems that enable us to produce in the intensified system but also to produce even when there is drought."


Speaking at a conference in Mexico this week, Ann Vaughan, deputy assistant administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, said scientific research and technology can help farmers cope with climate change and assist them in cultivating diverse crops.


"To help make sure we are accelerating smart innovations so that farmers are getting access so even in the face of horrific drought, they are still able to produce food for themselves and their families," said Vaughan. "... what that looks like is making sure we have the right science, the right seeds, the right private sector partners who are pulling and creating a demand for these types of seeds, diversifying so that you are not just growing maize but you are also growing cowpeas and other things which are more resilient to climate change and the brighter type of practices so that you are mixing intercropping and having less tilt."


Initiative promotes sustainable practices


In 2010, the U.S. government launched Feed the Future, an initiative aimed at addressing the causes of hunger and poverty in developing countries worldwide.


The program improved African agriculture systems by promoting sustainable practices that considered climate challenges. That helped increase economic opportunities, employment and trade.


In some African countries, the dominance of maize crops as the primary source of food has worried experts. The crop relies on rain, and climate change is causing unpredictable rainfall patterns.


African farmers must change when and what they grow to produce enough food, said Ojiewo.


"Ensuring that production and productivity continue, whether in season or off-season, does not necessarily mean relying 100 percent on rain-fed agriculture," said Ojiewo. "Diversification, as I mentioned here, does not mean overlying on one single crop for population survival. I know many countries are relying on maize in terms of cereals and ignoring some of the other crops that will fit into these systems."


Due to increasing drought in several African countries, farmers are urged to cultivate crops such as cassava, sorghum, pigeon peas, and pearl millet, which are resilient to unpredictable and harsh conditions.

## House rejects GOP effort to fine Attorney General Garland for refusal to turn over Biden audio

date: 2024-07-11, from: VOA News USA

Washington — The House rejected a GOP effort Thursday to fine Attorney General Merrick Garland $10,000 a day until he turns over audio of President Joe Biden's interview in his classified documents case as a handful of Republicans resisted taking an aggressive step against a sitting Cabinet official.


Even if the resolution — titled inherent contempt — had passed, it was unclear how the fine would be enforced as the dispute over the tape of Biden's interview with special counsel Robert Hur is now playing out in court.




The House voted 204-210, with four Republicans joining all Democrats, to halt a Republican resolution that would have imposed the fine, effectively rebuffing the latest effort by GOP lawmakers to assert its enforcement powers — weeks after Biden asserted executive privilege to block the release of the recording.


"This is not a decision that we have reached lightly but the actions of the attorney general cannot be ignored," Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., the resolution's lead sponsors, said during debate Wednesday. "No one is above the law."


The House earlier this year made Garland the third attorney general in U.S. history to be held in contempt of Congress. But the Justice Department said Garland would not be prosecuted, citing the agency's "longstanding position and uniform practice" to not prosecute officials who don't comply with subpoenas because of a president's claim of executive privilege.




Democrats blasted the GOP effort as another political stunt. Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., said that the resolution is unjustified in the case of Garland because he has complied with subpoena.


"Their frustration is that they can't get their hands on an audio recording that they think they could turn into an RNC attack ad," McGovern said in reference to the Republican National Committee. "When you start making a mockery of things like inherent contempt you diminish this institution."


Garland himself has defended the Justice Department, saying officials have gone to extraordinary lengths to provide information to the committees about Hur's classified documents investigation, including a transcript of Biden's interview. However, Garland has said releasing the audio could jeopardize future sensitive investigations because witnesses might be less likely to cooperate if they know their interviews might become public.


House Republicans sued Garland earlier this month in an attempt to force the release of the recording.


Republicans have accused Biden of suppressing the recording because he's afraid to have voters hear it during an election year. The White House and Democratic lawmakers, meanwhile, have slammed Republicans' motives for pursuing contempt and dismissed their efforts to obtain the audio as purely political.




The congressional inquiry began with the release of Hur's report in February, which found evidence that Biden willfully retained and shared highly classified information when he was a private citizen. Yet the special counsel concluded that criminal charges were not warranted.


Republicans, incensed by Hur's decision, issued a subpoena for audio of his interviews with Biden during the spring. But the Justice Department turned over only some of the records, leaving out audio of the interview with the president.


Beyond the bitingly critical assessment of Biden's handling of sensitive government records, Hur offered unflattering characterizations of the Democratic president's memory in his report, sparking fresh questions about his competency and age that cut at voters' most deep-seated concerns about the 81-year-old seeking a second term.

## The IRA Might Survive a Republican Trifecta — But Not as a Climate Law

date: 2024-07-11, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjY3MDcxMi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1NjIzNTcyMH0.DKe5YHu2mkVJyGRu4WfJ_ii6BxZnMdashI8erMppr5Q/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">The Biden administration has shoveled money from the Inflation Reduction Act out the door <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/37-billion-biden-ira" target="_blank">as fast as possible</a> this year, touting the many benefits all that cash has brought to Republican congressional districts. Many — in Washington, at think tanks and non-profits, among developers — have found in this a reason to be calm about the law’s fate. But this is incorrect. The IRA’s future as a climate law is in a far more precarious place than the Beltway conventional wisdom has so far suggested. </p><p>Shortly after the changing of the guard in Congress and the White House, policymakers will begin discussing <a href="https://punchbowl.news/archive/53024-punchbowl-news-am/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>whether to extend</u></a> the Trump-era tax cuts, which expire at the end of 2025. If they opt to do so, they’ll try to find a way to pay for it — and if Republicans win big in the November elections, as recent polling and Democratic fretting suggests could happen, the IRA will be an easy target. </p><p>Yes, the law has created a <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/republicans-reject-climate-jobs" target="_self"><u>ton of jobs</u></a> in states and congressional districts controlled by Republicans. Sure, some in the GOP have <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/john-curtis-senate" target="_self"><u>moderated on climate</u></a> and stopped denying the science behind the warming of our planet. Absolutely, the IRA is the kind of all-carrot and no-stick approach to energy that <a href="https://www.axios.com/pro/energy-policy/newsletters/2023/06/08/energy-no-ira-smoke" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Republicans tend to like</u></a>, and there would be legal and political challenges to accomplishing anything of consequence in today’s polarized and chaotic Congress. </p><p>But while some lawmakers may be evolving on climate, the broader GOP under Trump’s control has grown far more willing to spurn its pro-business past and give industries heartburn in pursuit of other ideological or cultural objectives. </p><p>“The Republican Party’s traditional views on climate and business are both changing and result in competing pressures,” Alex Flint, a longtime Senate Republican energy staffer, told me. Flint now runs the pro-business climate group Alliance for Market Solutions. “There is less climate denialism. And less support for business. So on the one hand, more Republicans are comfortable supporting climate policies like those in the IRA, but are less responsive to the businesses that want to defend those programs.” </p><p>What that means is that, in the event of a big GOP victory, anything impossible to fully repeal may be fiddled with, whether through legislative or administrative means. On top of all the energy and climate regulations that would be targeted in that event, the nation’s transition away from fossil fuels could lose significant federal policy tailwinds. </p><h3>It wouldn’t take full repeal to kneecap the IRA</h3><p>On the legislative side, there is already broad GOP support for: repealing the <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/republican-platform-heavy-on-energy-silent-on-climate/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>consumer electric vehicle</u></a> and <a href="https://www.cbtnews.com/gop-bill-aims-to-repeal-u-s-ev-tax-credit-hurting-production-and-benefiting-china/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>charging station benefits</u></a>, nixing <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/house-passes-repeal-of-green-bank-methane-fee/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the methane fee</u></a>, killing the national “green bank” program, and eliminating any money <a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/posts/e-and-c-republicans-pressure-epa-over-potentially-awarding-600-million-to-left-wing-groups-for-environmental-justice" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>labeled “environmental justice.”</u></a> Broader programs with immense importance to decarbonization such as the “clean electricity” investment and production tax credits could be diminished or gutted at the urging of the party’s rightward flank. (See: this GOP committee chair’s <a href="https://waysandmeans.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/H.R.-3938-Bill-Text.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>IRA repeal bill</u></a>, which targeted the investment and production tax credits, specifically.) </p><p>Anything that cannot be repealed — as the Heritage Foundation’s <a href="https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_CHAPTER-22.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Project 2025 instructs</u></a> — Republicans will attempt to modify. Mike Faulkender, a former Trump official at the Treasury Department who is now chief economist for the America First Policy Institute, explained to me for <a href="https://www.axios.com/pro/energy-policy/2023/10/30/america-first-buzzsaw-for-the-ira" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>an </u><u><em><em>Axios</em></em></u><u> story</u></a> last October that if Trump wins, “We are going to review every rule, every notice, everything the administration has done in its implementation of that statute.” Demonstrating his seriousness, Faulkender also pointed to the IRA’s <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/market-insights/latest-news/energy-transition/072523-ira-turbocharged-carbon-capture-tax-credit-but-challenges-persist-experts#:~:text=In%20particular%2C%20the%20tax%20credit,and%20%2450%2Fmt%2C%20respectively." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>credit for carbon removal</u></a>. “The dollar values on this are extraordinary … I would go through that statute and see how we, through the rulemaking process, can narrow it as much as possible.” </p><p>It is possible to take these threats with a grain of salt. Kimberly Clausing, a former Biden official for the Treasury Department, told me that while she can imagine “one or two elements” of the law being revisited if they’re political priorities, it would require “too many lawyer man-hours” to “justify that kind of wholescale implementation pivot.” </p><p>Industries would also lobby heavily to avoid their credits going away. Going after the tech-neutral ITC and PTC, for example, could spark an immense backlash among a swath of energy sectors Republicans do support, including nuclear energy. Same for incentives to advanced manufacturing. Not to mention there are substantial logistical realities to repealing the IRA or changing its programs, as with Obamacare in the past. Such an effort would require organizing GOP lawmakers at a time when infighting has undermined even seeming slam dunks like a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gas-stove-protection-bills-suffer-major-setback-house-republicans-express-frustration-mccarthy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ban on gas stove bans</u></a>. </p><p>But seasoned political veterans and D.C. industry pros I spoke with for this story noted that Republicans may be more receptive to tweaking programs in a selective fashion, going after industries <a href="https://www.wpr.org/agriculture/gop-bill-would-pull-farmland-tax-credits-farmers-hosting-solar-power-installations" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>like solar</u></a> and <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/4287900-donald-trump-republicans-cheer-cancellation-new-jersey-offshore-wind-projects/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>offshore wind</u></a> that some have long-standing grievances with. For example, it may be too difficult to repeal the “tech-neutral” electricity credits in their entirety, but legislators could try to limit their reach for these less-favored sectors — as some have <a href="https://www.wpr.org/agriculture/gop-bill-would-pull-farmland-tax-credits-farmers-hosting-solar-power-installations" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>proposed doing</u></a> for solar projects on farmland — in the name of saving the government money or helping other favored interests. </p><p>Energy lobbying veteran Frank Maisano put it to me this way: “Businesses will support many things that they have their tentacles into and Republicans will support many things that are going on in their districts that constituents like. The reality is, if you’re going to try to repeal it, you’re going to have to do it through Congress and a lot of the action in the energy transition is in Republican districts. It becomes a constituent issue.”</p><p>Or, in plain English: If it’s a <em><em>successful </em></em>project in a GOP constituent district <em><em>and their specific voters like it</em></em>, that will be what has the most sway. </p><p>That won’t stop Republicans from claiming that the renewable sector as a whole is flagging. In <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/qa-scalise-talks-ira-repeal-evs-and-hopes-for-trump/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>an interview</u></a> with <em><em>E&E News’</em></em> Kelsey Brugger, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise responded to the question of whether the jobs created by the IRA would put Republicans in a tough spot on repeal by — dubiously — downplaying the figures. “Overall, there haven’t been many projects built,” Scalise said. “We’re scrutinizing all of it.” </p><p>There’s a reason for this: It creates an opening to point to real <a href="https://time.com/6565415/rooftop-solar-industry-collapse/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>market struggles</u></a> (though possibly in a <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/whats-behind-the-republican-hatred-of-evs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>selective fashion</u></a>) as a predicate for squeezing benefits to renewables. It’s easy to imagine a world where the impacts of <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/solar-module-tariff-china" target="_self"><u>tariffs on</u></a> domestic solar or hurdles <a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-episode-two-offshore-wind" target="_self"><u>facing offshore wind</u></a> are used as rationale for paring back credits and other federal supports. You might not be hearing much about this right now as the GOP is quietly letting Democrats knife themselves, but it’ll be worth watching the Republican National Convention next week to see if anyone spills the tea on plans for the IRA next year. </p><p>“Which of [these] forces prevail on any specific IRA program and on the totality of the IRA package is impossible to predict,” said Flint, “because members – Republicans who acknowledge the need to address climate – may be aligned with companies that receive those subsidies. But on the other hand, populists not closely aligned with business interests may be willing to criticize those programs without regard to their climate benefits. So what happens to climate policies and all of the IRA is a test case for the future of the Republican Party.” </p><h3>Fast isn’t fast enough</h3><p>Developers are starting to ask questions about the durability of IRA programs, Abigail Ross Hopper, president of the Solar Energy Industries Association, told me. Hopper’s optimistic that the marketplace will continue to favor solar. But she is clear-eyed about the risks ahead for certain aspects of the IRA – naming bonuses and the transferability of credits — that may not survive in their current form. </p><p>“People ask me all the time about, ‘How do I make educated opinions, not prognostications?’” she said. “There is this kind of built in uncertainty because of the partisanship that clean energy has unfortunately [had] imposed upon us … I am in agreement that the pace of decarb is going to be impacted by these elections and policy decisions. [But] I am not persuaded that we’re going to stop these efforts.” </p><p>To Hopper and others, at most risk is any unspent money or unused spending authority left over at agencies at the conclusion of Biden’s first term. Those supports face “probably the highest risk of clawback or not being spent,” she said. </p><p>Some agencies are still moving at a brisk pace that has reassured those in industry and advocacy spaces. The Treasury Department has signaled it may complete implementation of several key IRA credits — <a href="https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaViewRule?pubId=202404&RIN=1545-BR17" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>including</u></a> the “clean electricity” investment and production tax credits — before Jan. 20, 2025. And the Environmental Protection Agency’s been quite successful at doling out dollars that would otherwise be targeted in a future GOP-controlled Congress, such as those the IRA provided for the Solar For All program and the green bank initiative. These dollars will live on independent of who remains president because once they’re given to states or nonprofits, those parties get to decide how to spend them. </p><p>But there are still billions that may wind up in Trump’s control should he win in November. One example is the Department of Energy’s <a href="https://www.achrnews.com/articles/154798-a-slow-roll-for-ira-rebates" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>home electrification rebates</u></a>, which received $8.8 billion. Despite almost all states applying for at least some of the funding, per <a href="https://www.energy.gov/save/rebates#funding" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>DOE’s own tracker</u></a>, only five have been accepted, and only one – New York – had made those rebates available as of this week. </p><p>“I’m under the assumption that if it’s not going out in January 2025, then it’s not going out the door,” Harrison Godfrey, who works for energy policy shop Advanced Energy United, told me. “If the dollars get out the door, then the story of ‘25 is that regardless of who’s president, the states are in the driver’s seat.” </p><p>There are aspects of the IRA that <a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/eenews/2024/06/06/republicans-embrace-ira-at-politico-energy-summit-00161918" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>could survive</u></a> even a Republican trifecta. The law’s support for low-carbon fuels enjoys <a href="https://www.axios.com/pro/energy-policy/newsletters/2024/05/08/energy-safs-hard-landing" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>apparent bipartisan backing</u></a> because of the lifeline it can offer corn-based ethanol as the federal renewable fuel standard <a href="https://www.axios.com/pro/energy-policy/2023/05/22/ethanol-standards-brave-new-world" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>wanes in relevance</u></a>. And <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/hydrogen-rule-biden-clean-energy" target="_self"><u>despite grousing</u></a> about Biden’s implementation of the hydrogen tax credit, it’s easier to imagine industry lobbying for a rule change under Trump than it is a full-scale repeal of a credit that could be a boon to the oil and gas sector. </p><p>Meanwhile, the administration and other industry groups continue to sound an optimistic note.</p><p>“The Inflation Reduction Act credits have spurred a clean energy boom in communities across the country and markets have responded overwhelmingly,” Treasury spokesperson Michael Martinez told me in a statement. Jason Ryan, a spokesperson for American Clean Power, said that “with the new tax credits in place,” more than $488 billion investments have been announced, including new or expanded utility-scale manufacturing plants, and that “with over a third of those manufacturing facilities already up and running or under constructions, these numbers translate to real-world positive impacts.” </p><p>But even if some of the IRA remains, without regulations to drive demand for decarbonization solutions, its climate benefits would be substantially undermined. One must look only at <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4750699&download=yes" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>research</u></a> from Clausing and others, who found even a partial IRA repeal combined with weakened EPA regulations could significantly harm odds of meeting the current administration’s goal of slashing emissions in half by 2030. </p><p>In other words, deep breaths! It’s only four months until the election and six months until the tax conversation begins.</p>

## IN YOUR OWN TIME, JOE

date: 2024-07-11, from: Howard Jacobson blog

## A useful investment strategy? Copy what members of Congress are doing

<p>A Senate committee is set to hold a hearing later this month on a new bill that would ban stock trading by members of Congress and their families. The legislation was unveiled yesterday.

## Oil tanker held by Iran for over a year heads toward international waters

date: 2024-07-11, from: VOA News USA

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — An oil tanker held by Iran for over a year after being seized amid tensions between Tehran and the United States was sailing Thursday toward international waters, tracking data showed.


The Marshall Islands-flagged tanker Advantage Sweet traveled toward the Strait of Hormuz, where it was seized in April 2023 by Iran's navy while carrying $50 million worth of oil from Kuwait for Chevron Corporation. That's according to tracking data analyzed by The Associated Press, which also listed the vessel's destination at Khor Fakkan in the United Arab Emirates, which has been the first port of call for other vessels leaving Iranian detention.


Iran did not acknowledge the ship's departure. It came after an Iranian court on Thursday ordered the U.S. government to pay over $6.7 billion in compensation over a Swedish company stopping its supply of special dressings and bandages for those afflicted by a rare skin disorder after Washington imposed sanctions on the Islamic Republic.


Iran's government initially said it seized the Advantage Sweet because it hit another vessel, a claim not supported by any evidence. Then Iranian officials linked the Advantage Sweet's seizure to the court case that was decided Thursday.


A report by the state-run IRNA news agency described the $6.7 billion order as being filed on behalf of 300 plaintiffs, including family members of victims and those physically and emotionally damaged. IRNA said about 20 patients died after the Swedish company's decision.


Epidermolysis bullosa is a rare genetic condition that causes blisters all over the body and eyes. It can be incredibly painful and kill those afflicted. The young who suffer from the disease are known as "butterfly children" as their skin can appear as fragile as a butterfly's wing.


The order comes as U.S. judges have issued rulings that call for billions of dollars to be paid by Iran over attacks linked to Tehran, as well as those detained by Iran and used as pawns in negotiations between the countries — something Iran has responded to with competing lawsuits accusing the U.S. of involvement in a 2017 Islamic State group attack. The United Nations' highest court also last year rejected Tehran's legal bid to free up some $2 billion in Iranian Central Bank assets frozen by U.S. authorities.


In 2018, then-President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the U.S. from Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, apparently sparking the Swedish company to withdraw from the Iranian market. Iran now says it locally produces the bandages.


Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, has maintained that the Advantage Sweet was "seized under false pretenses." It has since written off the cargo as a loss.


The U.S. Navy has blamed Iran for a series of limpet mine attacks on vessels that damaged tankers in 2019, as well as for a fatal drone attack on an Israeli-linked oil tanker that killed two European crew members in 2021.


Tehran denies carrying out the attacks, but a wider shadow war between Iran and the West has played out in the region's volatile waters. Iranian tanker seizures have been a part of it since 2019. The last major seizure came when Iran took two Greek tankers in May 2022 and held them until November of that year.

## 15 books that made an impact

date: 2024-07-11, from: Ben Werdmuller's blog


<div class="e-content entry-content">
<p><img src="https://werd.io/file/668fe039afd3faea8a0f7472/thumb.jpg" alt="A lot of books, piled up in the best kind of bookstore" width="1024" height="683"></p><p>I really like <a href="https://louplummer.lol/15-books-with-the-most-impact/">Lou Plummer’s list of 15 books which made the most impact on him</a>, which I discovered <a href="https://tracydurnell.com/2024/07/10/re-15-books-with-the-most-impact/">via Tracy Durnell’s own list</a>:</p><blockquote><p>I think you can figure out a lot about a person if you know what books have had the most impact on them. At one point or another, each of these books was my current favorite. They all had a lasting impact on me. I'd love to see your list.</p></blockquote><p>Tracy has smartly split hers up into categories. I’ll do the same here. And just as Lou said, I’d love to see your list!</p><h3>Formative Books</h3><p>These books disproportionately influenced me when I was a much younger adult, and helped contribute to the way I saw the world in a hundred ways, from my sense of what was possible to my sense of humor.</p><ol><li><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/7949/9780345418913">The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, by Douglas Adams</a> — I don’t quote it, but the clever irreverence still sweeps me off my feet. A large part of me wishes I was Douglas Adams and always will.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellations:_Stories_of_the_Future">Constellations: Stories of the Future</a> — a mind-blowing collection of science fiction short stories, some of which became episodes of <em>The Twilight Zone</em> and so on. Jerome Bixby’s <em>It’s a Good Life</em>and Fritz Leiber’s <em>A Pail of Air</em> are standouts for me.</li>
<li><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/7949/9781501167713">Something Wicked This Way Comes, by Ray Bradbury</a> — There’s a warm, beating heart at the center of this story, and that’s what draws me in every time (and I’ve reread it countless times). There are better Bradbury books which have probably aged better — you’re probably thinking of them right now — but at the time, it resonated.</li>
<li><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/7949/9780679406419">Maus, by Art Spiegelman</a> — It was much later until I really understood how my own family was affected by WWII, but I connected to this hard. It was also the first graphic novel that made me really think about the possibilities of the form: something that was clearly far beyond superheroes and fantasy.</li>
<li><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/7949/9780385490818">The Handmaid’s Tale, by Margaret Atwood</a> — Practically a documentary at this point, but it’s always been a riveting work of speculative fiction that does what that genre does best: help us grasp with elements of our present. To most of us, it’s a warning. To the Heritage Foundation, I guess it’s a manual.</li>
<li><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/7949/9780451524935">1984, by George Orwell</a> — It’s hard to imagine a more culturally influential science fiction novel. I love it: although it has a lot to say, I find it to be a page-turner. If you haven’t read Sandra Newman’s follow-up, <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/7949/9780063265332">Julia</a>, run to get it: it’s an impressive work of fiction in its own right that reframes the story in brilliant ways.</li>
<li><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/7949/9780061624261">Microserfs, by Douglas Coupland</a> — Coupland sometimes reads like a funnier Bret Easton Ellis (which is to say zeitgeisty but hollow — <a href="https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/shampoo-planet_douglas-coupland/689466/item/14413484/#isbn=0671755056&amp;idiq=14413484">Shampoo Planet</a> and <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/7949/9780679781486">The Rules of Attraction</a> are cousins), but at his best he captures something real. Microserfs gave me that first taste of the community and camaraderie around building software together: it’s set in an earlier version of the industry than I got to be a part of, but its depiction of those early years is recognizable. Even the outlandish characters don’t feel out of place. I don’t think it’s probably aged at all well, but it resonated with me hard in my early twenties.</li>
</ol><h3>Motivating External Change</h3><p>These books helped me think about how we need to change, and what we might do.</p><ol><li><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/7949/9780679406419">The Jakarta Method: Washington’s Anticommunist Crusade and the Mass Murder Program That Shaped Our World, by Vincent Bevins</a> — I’m convinced that every American citizen should read this, in order to better understand how we show up in the world. (Spoiler alert: we don’t show up well.)</li>
<li><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/7949/9780553447453">Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City, by Matthew Desmond</a> — Visceral, accessible, memorable reporting on poverty and housing. Again, it should probably be required reading for American citizens.</li>
<li><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/7949/9780316300148">The Ministry for the Future, by Kim Stanley Robinson</a> — There’s a very silly passage in this book about the role of blockchain in solving climate change (come <em>on</em>), as well as quite a bit in favor of climate engineering, which I think is highly dubious bordering on terrifying. But at the same time, the novel succeeds at painting a visceral picture of what the effects of the climate crisis could be.</li>
<li><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/7949/9780593230275">Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents, by Isabel Wilkerson</a> — A key to understanding America. There’s a lot spelled out here that I simply didn’t know, running the gamut from the details of peoples’ everyday lived experiences to the chilling fact that Hitler based his Nazi caste system on Jim Crow.</li>
</ol><h3>Books That Changed Me</h3><p>These books either left me a different person somehow or touched something in me I didn’t know existed.</p><ol><li><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/7949/9780807083697">Kindred, by Octavia Butler</a> — I wish I’d discovered Butler earlier. Her work is immediate and deeply human, and while it shouldn’t have had to change a whole genre, it absolutely did. <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/7949/9781538732182">Parable of the Sower</a> is seismic, of course, and rightly famous. (It’s also getting to be a harder and harder read in the current climate.) But it was Kindred that opened the doors to a different kind of science fiction to me, and through it, all kinds of possibilities.</li>
<li><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/7949/9780063072657">How High We Go in the Dark, by Sequoia Nagamatsu</a> — I have never read a more effective metaphor for grief and change. I read it when I was in the depths of grief myself, and the way this book captures the nuance, the brutality, and the beauty is poetry. I still think about one chapter almost daily. (It’s the rollercoaster. If you know, you know.)</li>
<li><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/7949/9780143135692">The Color Purple, by Alice Walker</a> — A breathtaking example of a modern novel: a masterclass in form as well as content. Not a word is wasted in bringing the lived experiences of her characters to life (and through them, so many more). I’ve read this many times, and I’ve never made it through without absolutely weeping.</li>
<li><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/7949/9780385480017">Bird by Bird: Some Instructions on Writing and Life, by Anne Lamott</a> — So often recommended to writers for really good reasons, <em>Bird by Bird</em> is not just the best book I’ve ever read about writing but also about embarking upon <em>any</em> large project. It’s hopeful, nourishing, actionable, and lovely. Its lessons still motivate me.</li>

## U.S. Wind and Solar Just Hit a Power Milestone

date: 2024-07-11, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjY3MzAzOC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1NzM2NTU5NX0.YHA3Vw9ltw3kGQORmbtWSybFLOQWuSfagPi0YqVC04w/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p>
<em><strong>Current conditions:</strong> More than 10 inches of rain fell over nine hours in southwestern China • Wildfires are spreading in Canada, with at least 140 burning as of yesterday afternoon • The streets of Cape Town in South Africa are under water after severe storms caused widespread flooding. </em>
</p><h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2><h3>1. Wind and solar surpass nuclear in U.S. electricity generation</h3><p>
	More electricity was generated by wind and solar than by nuclear plants in the first half of 2024 for the first time ever in U.S. history, <em><em>Reuters</em></em> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/us-renewables-electricity-output-overtaking-nuclear-2024-07-11/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9kb0LtQdlztOjVJorJho0KEs5_tel0-2A9ugyIsZQQjgSjg-IK62Dj551DpJDZ9APeUUNN" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>, citing data from energy think tank Ember. Solar and wind farms generated 401.4 terawatt hours (TWh) compared to 390.5 TWh generated from nuclear reactors, setting 2024 on pace to be the “first full year when more U.S. electricity will come from renewables than from any other form of clean power.” It’s helpful to compare these numbers to the same period last year, when nuclear generated 9% more power than solar and wind. Solar saw the greatest gains, with output 30% higher in the first half of 2024 compared to 2023; wind generation was up 10% and nuclear was up just 3.4%. Between 2018 and 2023, installed capacity grew by 168% for utility solar and 56% for wind. Meanwhile, nuclear generation capacity dropped by 4%.
</p><h3>2. BP forecasts that oil demand will peak next year</h3><p>
	In its latest <a href="https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/business-sites/en/global/corporate/pdfs/energy-economics/energy-outlook/bp-energy-outlook-2024.pdf?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9kb0LtQdlztOjVJorJho0KEs5_tel0-2A9ugyIsZQQjgSjg-IK62Dj551DpJDZ9APeUUNN" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">energy outlook report</a>, fossil fuel giant BP forecasts that global demand for oil will peak in 2025, and the related carbon emissions will, too. The analysis is based on current climate policies and pledges, growing efficiency standards for the internal combustion engine and a rise in electric vehicles, and rapid expansion of renewables. By 2050, oil’s share of the energy mix is predicted to fall to about 25%, and that would decrease even more, to just 10%, if nations strengthen (and follow through on) their climate pledges to better align with the Paris Agreement.

## Trump’s Likely VPs All Have Different Bad Ideas About Climate

date: 2024-07-11, from: Heatmap News

D. Vance, and North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum. All erstwhile critics of Trump, they now share a fervent admiration for the former president they once scorned. But where do they stand on climate change?</p><p>Opinions on climate within the Republican Party are <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/nikki-haley-ron-desantis-fracking-environmentalist-gop-debate" target="_self"><u>complex</u></a>, and these three men reflect the divisions. According to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/03/01/how-republicans-view-climate-change-and-energy-issues/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Pew Research Center polls</u></a>, 47% of Republicans over the age of 65 believe that human activity contributes a great deal or some to climate change, but a full 79% of Republicans under 30 think so. Yet only a tiny number of them feel any urgency around climate: In <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/02/29/americans-top-policy-priority-for-2024-strengthening-the-economy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a Pew poll</u></a> earlier this year, only 12% of Republicans said climate should be a top priority for the president and Congress, the lowest score of the 20 issues they asked about. (59% of Democrats said it should be a top priority.) </p><p>That leaves room for Republican politicians to take a variety of positions, as long as they agree that the ideas favored by climate hawks are bad. For many, the optimal position is a kind of malign neglect: They’ll admit that warming temperatures are bad, but somehow find their way to opposing all measures to address the problem. With one partial exception, that describes all of Trump’s likeliest running mates.</p><h3>Doug Burgum</h3><p>Burgum can be a little tough to pin down on climate, in large part because of how he shrewdly avoids talking about the issue in the culture-war terms so many in his party prefer. At the start of his second term he <a href="https://www.thedickinsonpress.com/business/gov-doug-burgum-calls-for-north-dakota-to-be-carbon-neutral-by-2030" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>set a target</u></a> of achieving carbon neutrality by 2030 — but without regulation or any reduction in fossil fuel production. Instead, Burgum wants the state to become a center for carbon capture, calling the room underground to store large amounts of carbon the state’s “geologic jackpot.” </p><p>As part of that project, Burgum has advocated the construction of a pipeline to carry CO2 into the state from other Midwest states, which he touts as simply a money-making proposition. “This has nothing to do with climate change,” <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-burgum-pipeline-north-dakota-vice-president-ba0bbfa00984de04ab23624b963dc66f" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>he said in March</u></a>. “This has to do with markets.” He has <a href="https://futurefarmermag.com/qa-with-governor-doug-burgum-on-carbon-neutrality/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>touted</u></a> environmental, social, and governance-related investing, which focuses on companies with strong environmental records, as an opportunity for the state to lure capital — but has also <a href="https://wdeawebsite.blob.core.windows.net/usrfiles/documents/jointgovernors-policy-statementonesg_3-16-2023.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>joined</u></a> with other Republican governors to condemn it. </p><p>Burgum has close ties with the oil industry, so much so that he has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/09/climate/burgum-energy-trump-oil.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>become</u></a> Trump’s key liaison to the industry and its <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-47-committee-big-oil" target="_self"><u>billionaire magnates</u></a>; he has also been mentioned as a possible energy secretary if he is not Trump’s running mate, which would make him the administration’s chief fossil fuel advocate. </p><p>In other words, Burgum seems to be on multiple sides of the climate issue. He’s a fossil-fuel promoter and <a href="https://northdakotamonitor.com/2024/04/30/burgum-gives-ev-plan-the-cold-shoulder/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>critic</u></a> of electric vehicles who wants to make his state carbon neutral. And you will look in vain for any statement where Burgum says exactly what kind of threat he believes climate change poses, or even if he thinks it is happening at all; in technocratic style, he shifts any question on the issue to economic and practical concerns. </p><h3>Marco Rubio</h3><p>With its frequent hurricanes and dramatic sea level rise, Florida sees direct and repeated effects of climate change as much as any state in the country. Yet it took Marco Rubio many years to arrive at his current position: In the early part of his career he was a clear climate denier, but lately he has taken something more like the prevailing Republican view, which is that while climate change is happening and human activity may be contributing to it, we shouldn’t actually do much about it. At the very least, we shouldn’t do anything that comes with even the smallest cost in dollars or convenience.</p><p>During his first run for Senate in 2010, Rubio <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140513233119/https://www.tbo.com/ap/politics/rubio-questions-climate-change-83470" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>said</u></a>, “The climate is always changing” — a common dodge among climate deniers, used to make them sound like they aren’t completely oblivious while they refuse to acknowledge the causes and consequences of post-industrialization warming. But “I don't think there's the scientific evidence to justify” the idea that humans have anything to do with it, he added.</p><p>He continued to hold that position for years. “I do not believe that human activity is causing these dramatic changes to our climate the way these scientists are portraying it,” <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2014/may/13/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-humans-are-not-causing-climate-ch/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>he said in 2014</u></a>. But over time, Rubio became less hesitant about admitting the reality of warming, even if he <a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/10/22/18007922/climate-change-republicans-denial-marco-rubio-trump" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>steered away</u></a> from talking about the cause. He <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/08/19/rubio-on-climate-change-we-should-choose-adaptive-solutions-column/2019310001/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>proposed</u></a> modest measures to increase climate resilience, while always pairing them with <a href="https://www.rubio.senate.gov/icymi-rubio-exposes-left-s-climate-whataboutism/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>attacks</u></a> on more aggressive action as an attempt by leftist radicals to destroy the economy. </p><p>Today, Rubio is a member of the bipartisan <a href="https://www.coons.senate.gov/climate-solutions-caucus/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Senate Climate Solutions Caucus</u></a>, which has occasional meetings but steers away from taking any positions on particular legislation or regulations, making it mostly a way for senators to say “I care” without committing themselves to action. </p><h3>J. D. Vance</h3><p>When Vance talks about climate, it’s in the terms of a culture warrior, heaping contempt on liberals and their goals for a safer and cleaner environment. His 2022 Senate campaign against Democrat Tim Ryan featured substantial discussion of climate issues, with Vance regularly condemning efforts to reduce emissions and lamenting the decline of coal. “All of this ‘bring American manufacturing back’ from the Democrats is fake unless we stop the green energy fantasy,” <a href="https://x.com/JDVance1/status/1553001982662791170" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>he tweeted that July</u></a>. “Solar panels can’t power a modern manufacturing economy. That’s why the Chinese are building coal power plants, something Tim Ryan’s donors won’t let America do.”</p><p>“If you want to make our environment more clean, the way to do it is to invest in Ohio natural gas,” <a href="https://woub.org/2022/08/17/j-d-vance-and-tim-ryan-square-off-on-electric-vehicle-measures-in-new-federal-climate-change-plan/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>he’s said</u></a>. Or as <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6314984883112" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>he told Fox News</u></a>, “The obsession Democrats have with eliminating fossil fuels is crazy.” </p><p>Like Trump, Vance has emphasized his loathing for electric vehicles. “Even if there was a climate crisis, I don’t know how the way to solve it is to buy more Chinese manufactured electric vehicles,” <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/18102022/ohio-senate-climate-jd-vance-tim-ryan/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>he said</u></a> on a radio show in 2022 in response to the EV incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act (which in fact requires that to qualify for subsidies vehicles must be mostly American-made with domestic materials; <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/12/28/1219158071/ev-electric-vehicles-tax-credit-car-shopping-tesla-ford-vw-gm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the requirements</u></a> are complicated, but no Chinese vehicles qualify). “The whole EV thing is a scam, right?”</p><p>Always attuned to the value of a PR stunt, Vance <a href="https://www.vance.senate.gov/press-releases/senator-vance-introduces-legislation-to-heighten-penalties-for-art-vandals/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>introduced</u></a> a bill he called the “Consequences for Climate Vandals Act,” meant to crack down on the scourge of climate activists throwing soup on paintings. Fox News was <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-lawmaker-crack-down-climate-change-activists-deface-historical-artwork" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>pleased</u></a>, but the bill went nowhere, leaving America dangerously vulnerable to art-based climate protests.</p><p>This is the common thread running through Vance’s comments on climate: Unlike Rubio, who may have no choice but to discuss the effects of warming given the state he represents, Vance almost never mentions these effects. He turns any discussion of climate into an attack on liberals, environmentalists, and Democrats for their supposedly ruinous ideas to address the problem. If Burgum’s response to climate is <em><em>Can we make money off this?</em></em> and Rubio’s is <em><em>It’s serious, but let’s not be hasty</em></em>, Vance’s could be summed up as <em><em>Go to hell, libs</em></em>. </p><p>No matter who Trump picks, his vice president is unlikely to be anything but the most tentative voice of reason in the administration’s climate policy, even in the best of circumstances. None of these three has given us much reason to think he would risk his own position by standing in the way of what will no doubt be a determined effort to remove regulations on the fossil fuel industry, undo the carrot-based approach of the Biden administration to encouraging a green transition, and generally let the emissions rip. Or even that they’d want to.</p>

## NATO, Ukrainian leaders to meet Thursday at Washington summit

date: 2024-07-11, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — NATO and Ukrainian leaders are to meet Thursday in Washington, a day after NATO allies bolstered support for Ukraine to join the alliance.


The NATO summit’s final day will also include talks with leaders from Australia, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and the European Union addressing security challenges and cooperation.


A NATO communique released by the 32-member bloc Wednesday said Ukraine’s path to NATO membership is “irreversible.”


“It’s not a question of if, but when,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters Wednesday.




The United States was once deeply concerned about whether Ukraine was ready for NATO membership but now appears resolved to ensure Kyiv eventually joins the alliance.


“We're providing that bridge to membership for Ukraine. It's really a significant deliverable,” Michael Carpenter, the senior director for Europe at the National Security Council, told VOA.


Stoltenberg said that when fighting stops in Ukraine, NATO will need to ensure that halt will be the final end to violence there.


The way to ensure it stops for good, Stoltenberg said, is NATO membership for Ukraine. Otherwise, he said, Russia could continue its aggression.


Unlike the European Union, which began negotiations with Ukraine to join its ranks on June 25, there is no consensus yet about Ukraine joining NATO.


F-16 transfer under way


Meanwhile, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the first American-made F-16 fighter jets are currently being delivered to Ukraine and are expected to patrol Ukrainian skies in coming weeks.


“The transfer of F-16s is officially under way, and Ukraine will be flying F-16s this summer,” he said at the summit.


In a statement Wednesday, Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and U.S. President Joe Biden announced that the Dutch and Danish governments were providing the F-16s, while Belgium and Norway had committed to send more aircraft to Ukraine.


NATO member heads of state held their first working session of the summit Wednesday as they sought to boost the alliance’s support for Ukraine and enhance their own defense and deterrence efforts.


At the start of the session, Biden said Russia was ramping up its defense production with Chinese, North Korean and Iranian help.


To counter their efforts, he said, NATO members must continue to invest more in defense production.


“We cannot allow the alliance to fall behind,” Biden said.


China called out


In the NATO communique, all 32 allies on Wednesday also called on China to cease its support for Russia’s war effort against Kyiv, including its transfer of dual-use materials, such as weapons components, equipment and raw materials that aid Russia’s defense sector.


“The PRC cannot enable the largest war in Europe in recent history without this negatively impacting its interests and reputation,” the leaders wrote.


Asked by VOA whether the statement was a strong enough message to deter China from continuing to support Russia, Stoltenberg replied in the press conference that Wednesday’s declaration is “the strongest message that NATO allies have ever sent on China’s contributions to Russia’s illegal war against Ukraine.”


A spokesperson for China’s mission to the European Union rejected the NATO statement, calling it “filled with Cold War mentality and belligerent rhetoric.”


NATO allies invited Indo-Pacific partners from Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand to also attend this week’s summit. Officials say their inclusion reflects their importance during growing Chinese, North Korean, Russian and Iranian aggression.


Iulia Iarmolenko contributed to this report. Some information for this report was provided by Reuters

## Las Vegas hits record of fifth consecutive day of 46.1 Celsius or greater

date: 2024-07-11, from: VOA News USA

LAS VEGAS — Las Vegas baked Wednesday in its record fifth consecutive day of temperatures sizzling at 46.1 Celsius or greater amid a lengthening hot spell that is expected to broil much of the U.S. into the weekend.


The temperature climbed to 46.1 shortly after 1 p.m. at Harry Reid International Airport, breaking the old mark of four consecutive days set in July 2005. And the record could be extended, or even doubled, by the weekend.


Even by desert standards, the prolonged baking that Nevada's largest city is experiencing is nearly unprecedented, with forecasters calling it "the most extreme heat wave" since the National Weather Service began keeping records in Las Vegas in 1937.


Already the city has broken 16 heat records since June 1, well before the official start of summer, "and we're not even halfway through July yet," meteorologist Morgan Stessman said Wednesday. That includes an all-time high of 48.8 C set on Sunday, which beat the previous 47.2 C record.


Alyse Sobosan said this July has felt the hottest in the 15 years she has lived in Las Vegas. She said she doesn't step outside during the day if she can help it.


"It's oppressively hot," she said. "It's like you can't really live your life."


It's also dangerously hot, health officials have emphasized. There have been at least nine heat-related deaths this year in Clark County, which encompasses Las Vegas, according to the county coroner's office. Officials say the toll is likely higher.


"Even people of average age who are seemingly healthy can suffer heat illness when it's so hot it's hard for your body to cool down," said Alexis Brignola, an epidemiologist at the Southern Nevada Health District.


For homeless residents and others without access to safe environments, officials have set up emergency cooling centers at community centers across southern Nevada.


The Las Vegas area has been under an excessive heat warning on three separate occasions this summer, totaling about 12 days of dangerous heat with little relief even after the sun goes down, Stessman said.


Keith Bailey and Lee Doss met early Wednesday morning at a Las Vegas park to beat the heat and exercise their dogs, Breakie, Ollie and Stanley.


"If I don't get out by 8:30 in the morning, then it's not going to happen that day," Bailey said, wearing a sunhat while the dogs played in the grass.




More than 142 million people around the U.S. were under heat alerts Wednesday, especially in Western states, where dozens of locations tied or broke heat records over the weekend and are expected to keep doing so all week.


Oregon has seen record daily high temperatures, with Portland reaching 39.4 C and Salem and Eugene hitting 40.5 C on Tuesday. The number of potentially heat-related deaths in Oregon has risen to 10, according to the state medical examiner's office. The latest two deaths involved a 54-year-old man in Jackson County and a 27-year-old man in Klamath County.


On the other side of the nation, the National Weather Service warned of major-to-extreme heat risk over portions of the East Coast.


An excessive heat warning remained in place Wednesday for the Philadelphia area, northern Delaware and nearly all of New Jersey. Temperatures were around 32.2 C for most of the region, and forecasters warned the heat index could soar as high as 42.2 C. The warning was due to expire at 8 p.m. Wednesday, though forecasters said there may be a need to extend it.


The heat was blamed for a motorcyclist's death over the weekend in Death Valley National Park. At Death Valley on Tuesday, tourists queued for photos in front of a giant thermometer that was reading 48.9 C.


Simon Pell and Lisa Gregory from London left their air-conditioned RV to experience a midday blast of heat that would be unthinkable back home.


"I wanted to experience what it would feel like," Pell said. "It's an incredible experience."


At the Grand Canyon, the National Park Service was investigating the third hiker death in recent weeks. Temperatures on parts of some trails can reach 49 C in the shade.


An excessive heat warning continued Wednesday in many parts of southern and central Arizona. Forecasters said the high in Phoenix was expected to reach 45.5 C after it hit 46.6 C Tuesday, tying the previous record for the date set in 1958.


Authorities were investigating the death of a 2-year-old who was left alone in a hot vehicle Tuesday afternoon in Marana, near Tucson, police said. At Lake Havasu, a 4-month-old died from heat-related complications Friday, the Mohave County Sheriff's Department said.


The U.S. heat wave came as the global temperature in June was a record warm for the 13th straight month and marked the 12th straight month that the world was 1.5 degrees Celsius  warmer than pre-industrial times, the European climate service Copernicus said. Most of this heat, trapped by human-caused climate change, is from long-term warming from greenhouse gases emitted by the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, scientists say.


Firefighters in Henderson, Nevada, last week became the first in the region to deploy what city spokesperson Madeleine Skains called "polar pods," devices filled with water and ice to cool a person exhibiting symptoms of heat stroke or a related medical emergency.


Extreme heat in the West has also dried out vegetation that fuels wildfires.


A blaze burning in northern Oregon, about 178 kilometers east of Portland, blew up to 28 square kilometers by Wednesday afternoon due to hot temperatures, gusty wind and low humidity, according to the Oregon State Fire Marshal. The Larch Creek Fire closed Highway 197 and forced evacuations for remote homes.


In California, firefighters were battling least 19 wildfires Wednesday, including a 117-square-kilometer blaze that prompted evacuation orders for about 200 homes in the mountains of Santa Barbara County.

## US plan to boost Pacific air power seen as counterbalance to China

date: 2024-07-11, from: VOA News USA

washington — A U.S. plan to boost its Pacific air power is seen by analysts as an effort to reinforce deterrence in the Indo-Pacific and counterbalance China's attempt to gain dominance in the region.


The U.S. Air Force plans to upgrade more than 80 fighter jets stationed at Japanese bases over the next several years as part of a $10 billion program to modernize its forces there.


The Defense Department announced the plan last week, saying it aims to enhance the U.S.-Japan alliance and bolster deterrence in the Indo-Pacific.


"This is a necessary upgrade that has been planned for some time. And combined with Japan's own investments, it will help maintain some degree of air power balance between the allies and China's progress in air force modernization," said James Schoff, senior director of the U.S.-Japan NEXT Alliance Initiative at the Sasakawa Peace Foundation USA.


"Without it, the credibility of U.S. deterrent capacity would be much weaker, which could cause Beijing to doubt U.S. seriousness about protecting the status quo across the Taiwan Strait and prompt more aggressive Chinese behavior," Schoff said.


The Taiwanese Defense Ministry said it spotted 37 Chinese aircraft near Taiwan on Wednesday as they headed to the Western Pacific for drills with the Shandong aircraft carrier.


Chinese jets and warships have frequently made dangerous maneuvers around the self-ruled island of Taiwan, which Beijing claims as a part of its own territory.




Former U.S. Indo-Pacific Commander John Aquilino told the Senate Armed Services Committee in March that China could soon have the world's largest air force.


China is currently the third-largest air power in the world, behind the United States and Russia.


China's rapid military modernization efforts have led it to possess more than 3,150 aircraft, of which about 2,400 are combat aircraft, including fighters, strategic and tactical bombers, and attack aircraft, according to the Pentagon's 2023 report on China's military power.


Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, told VOA on Monday that "U.S.-Japan relations should not target or harm other countries' interests and should not undermine regional peace and stability."


Upgrade designed to help defend Japan


In addition to protecting Taiwan, the upgrade — which includes the advanced F-35 jets — also will help U.S. Forces Japan (USFJ) deter North Korea and defend Japan's Southwest Islands, said James Przystup, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute.


Japan has a territorial dispute with China over what it calls the Senkaku Islands and what China calls the Diaoyu Islands.




Japan and Russia also have a dispute over islands off Hokkaido, which Japan calls the Northern Territories and Russia calls the Kuril Islands.


The U.S. aircraft upgrade plan is to modify several deployed F-35B jets stationed at the Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni in Yamaguchi prefecture south of Hiroshima.


The Misawa Air Base in Japan's northern Aomori prefecture will see 36 F-16 aircraft be replaced with 48 F-35A jets.




Aircraft will be rotated


At Kadena Air Base in Japan's southern island of Okinawa, 48 F-15 C/D jets will be replaced with 36 new F-15EX jets. During the upgrades, fourth- and fifth-generation tactical aircraft will be dispatched on a rotational basis, according to the Pentagon.


"The upgrades will provide qualitative and quantitative boosts to the USFJ inventory, which will also enhance the U.S.-Japan alliance's readiness against China, North Korea and Russia," said Ryo Hinata-Yamaguchi, a professor at the University of Tokyo and a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council's Indo-Pacific Security Initiative.


"Benefits will be seen not only in aerial operations but also guarding U.S. and Japanese capabilities for naval and amphibious operations. The platforms are not simply about technological superiority for combat, but also more advanced electronic warfare capabilities to penetrate weaknesses of China, North Korea and Russia," he said.


China often conducts joint air drills with Russia over the waters near South Korea and Japan. In December, Chinese and Russian jets entered South Korea's Air Defense Identification Zone, prompting Seoul to scramble fighter jets in response.


David Maxwell, vice president of the Center for Asia Pacific Strategy, said, "Russia has been conducting some combined operations with China on a limited basis recently, so if Russia operates in the Indo-Pacific, it will certainly indicate these systems will contribute to the defense of U.S.-allies' interests."


Maxwell said U.S. bases in Japan give the U.S. "a lot of operational flexibility to be able to deal with multiple contingencies, either on the Korean Peninsula or in the South China Sea, or really, anywhere in Asia."


Okinawa is about 740 kilometers (459.8 miles) from Taiwan and 990 kilometers (615.1 miles) from South Korea's southern port city of Busan. Kadena, which the U.S. calls "the keystone of the Pacific," is the largest U.S. installation in the Indo-Pacific.


Zack Cooper, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, who served as special assistant to the principal deputy undersecretary of defense for policy during the George W. Bush administration, said rotating aircraft presence at Kadena during the upgrade transition helps the U.S. disperse them in case of an attack.


"Kadena Air Base is under greater threat than it's been in decades," from a range of Chinese capabilities, both ballistic and cruise missiles, he said. "There are a couple of options for how to deal with that. One is for the U.S. to disperse its forces more so that if there was an attack, there would be less concentration of U.S. forces."

## NATO calls Ukraine’s path to membership 'irreversible'

date: 2024-07-11, from: VOA News USA

washington — The United States and its NATO allies have agreed that Ukraine’s path to membership in the organization is “irreversible,” according to a communique released by the 32-member bloc during this week’s summit in Washington.


“It’s not a question of if, but when,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters Wednesday.


The United States was once deeply concerned about whether Ukraine was ready for NATO membership but now appears resolved to ensure Kyiv eventually joins the alliance.




“We're providing that bridge to membership for Ukraine. It's really a significant deliverable,” Michael Carpenter, the senior director for Europe at the National Security Council, told VOA.


Stoltenberg explained that when fighting stops in Ukraine, NATO will need to ensure that it stops for good.


The way to ensure that, he added, is to secure NATO membership for Ukraine. Otherwise, he said, Russia could continue its aggression.


Unlike the European Union, which began negotiations with Ukraine to join its ranks on June 25, there is no consensus yet about Ukraine joining NATO.


 




F-16 transfer under way


Meanwhile, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the first American-made F-16 fighter jets were being delivered to Ukraine and were expected to patrol Ukrainian skies in the coming weeks.


“The transfer of F-16s is officially under way, and Ukraine will be flying F-16s this summer,” he said at the summit.


In a statement Wednesday, Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and U.S. President Joe Biden announced that the Dutch and Danish governments were providing the F-16s, while Belgium and Norway had committed to send more aircraft to Ukraine.


NATO member heads of state held their first working session of the summit Wednesday as they sought to boost the alliance’s support for Ukraine and enhance their own defense and deterrence efforts.


At the start of the session, Biden said Russia was ramping up its defense production with the help of China, North Korea and Iran.


To counter them, he said, NATO members must continue to invest more in defense production.


“We cannot allow the alliance to fall behind,” Biden said.


 




China called out


In the NATO communique, all 32 allies also called on China to cease its support for Russia’s war effort against Kyiv, including its transfer of dual-use materials, such as weapons components, equipment and raw materials that serve as inputs for Russia’s military sector.


China "cannot enable the largest war in Europe in recent history without this negatively impacting its interests and reputation,” the leaders wrote.


Asked by VOA whether the statement was a strong enough message to deter China from continuing to support Russia, Stoltenberg replied in the press conference that Wednesday’s declaration was “the strongest message that NATO allies have ever sent on China’s contributions to Russia’s illegal war against Ukraine.”


NATO allies invited Indo-Pacific partners from Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand to attend this week’s summit. Officials said their inclusion relayed the importance of these partners amid growing aggression from China, North Korea, Russia and Iran.
