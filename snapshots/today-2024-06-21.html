defense chiefs to gather in Botswana for US military conference</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Gaborone, Botswana — Defense chiefs from 30 African countries will
gather in Botswana next week for a two-day military conference to
discuss the continent’s security and stability challenges. The meeting,
organized by the United States Africa Command, or AFRICOM, will be the
first to be held in Africa since the inaugural conference in 2017 </p>
<p>“The aim [is] to tackle the pressing security challenges on the
African continent and to find ways to work together for a safer, more
secure Africa,” said Lt. Commander Bobby Dixon, a spokesman at AFRICOM. 
“From counterterrorism efforts to cyber threats and peacekeeping
missions, this conference will cover it all. Experts and military
leaders will share insights, strategies, and forge partnerships that
will strengthen the collective defense capabilities for all of Africa.
This is more than just a conference — it’s a significant step towards a
unified approach in safeguarding the African continent.”</p>
<p>AFRICOM says the meeting will build on the success of previous
conferences. Last year’s meeting held in Rome, Italy, attracted the
highest turnout, with 43 countries in attendance.</p>
<p>“It is evident that Africa faces a series of challenges,” said Jakkie
Cilliers, a political scientist at the Institute for Security Studies in
Pretoria. “It is not always clear that the model that the U.S. presents
is appropriate for Africa. In recent years, we have seen a variety of
coups in Africa, sometimes executed by African forces that have been
trained in the U.S., the U.K. and France. And it is also evident that a
number of U.N. peacekeeping missions, such as that in the DR Congo and
Mali, are withdrawing from Africa.</p>
<p>“On the other hand, the role of Russia and the so-called Africa Group
[pls check the audio; it is usually called the Africa Corps] is
expanding. So, it’s clear that Africa is facing a security challenge,
and partners can and should do as much as possible to help.”</p>
<p>Cilliers added that there is a need for the Gaborone conference to
come up with effective solutions to the continent’s security
challenges. </p>
<p>“Are we seeing a new model developing where African governments are
considering alternative security arrangements, mostly by other African
countries?” he said. “And of course, the role of private companies is
also increasing. These events occur at a time of significant shifts in
the global balance of power, and Africa again is an area of competition.
One hopes all these issues will be discussed at the upcoming conference
in Gaborone, and that real solutions will come to the fore.”</p>
<p>In March, following its Peace and Security Council meeting, the
African Union expressed “deep concern” over the scourge of conflicts on
the continent and their impact on socioeconomic development.</p>

<li>Solar to provide one-fifth of global electricity during peak summer
hours
</h3>
<p>
During the sunniest hours of the longest days of the year, solar power
can now provide about 20% of the world’s electricity, according to
<a href="https://ember-climate.org/insights/in-brief/the-global-solar-revolution/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8vwIQiInF9t6t3FqFOIahapl9tvXyJCxIPn0TMiSvwogvuXmomxRMXIM7i1khnZYYkNsxE" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new
estimates from energy think tank Ember</a>. That’s up from 16% last
year. Throughout the entire month of June, solar will account for
roughly 8.2% of global electricity, up from 6.7% in the same month last
year, and higher than the 5.5% annual average across the whole of 2023.
The report underscores the rapid expansion of solar, which is now the
fastest-growing source of electricity. “As solar continues to expand, it
is poised to further transform the power sector and accelerate the
world’s transition to renewable energy,” the authors said.

<li>Startup plans to use methane to make graphite
</h3>
<p>
A California-based startup called Molten Industries is trying to
transform natural gas into a key component for making lithium-ion
batteries. The company has “developed a specialized technique to break
methane into graphite and hydrogen, the latter of which can be used as a
source of clean energy,” <em><em>Bloomberg</em></em>
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-20/california-startup-creates-key-electric-vehicle-battery-material-from-methane?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8vwIQiInF9t6t3FqFOIahapl9tvXyJCxIPn0TMiSvwogvuXmomxRMXIM7i1khnZYYkNsxE" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.
Graphite is used to make batteries, but most of it comes from China, so
Molten wants to onshore production at a competitive cost. The company
says its graphite production was a sort of happy accident. “Our original
focus was just to make the lowest-cost hydrogen with the most
energy-efficient reactor possible,” said co-founder and CEO Kevin Bush.
Molten announced this week a $25 million series A round of funding led
by Breakthrough Energy Ventures. It plans to use the money to build its
first modular commercial reactor.

this week it will stop using plastic “air pillows” to protect the

The shift will be completed by the end of 2024, and will mean 15 billion

in part by support among investors for cutting waste, but it’s helped by
the fact that Amazon discovered recycled paper protects packages better

TikTok’s Chinese parent company, ByteDance, has six months to divest or
the U.S. plans to ban the app for national security reasons. But in a
new court filing, ByteDance calls the U.S. government’s demands
unconstitutional and says government officials have refused to seriously
negotiate for two years. Also, AI comes for banking jobs. And later,
what if your deepfake was circulating halfway across the world in China?

I think I have mentioned it before but I absolutely love her site
because it’s precisely everything mine isn’t. My site is this super
clean, super calm place, with no JS, no weirdness going on, and almost
no images. Her site is a proper experience and you’ll understand what I
mean when you click that link. And even though the containers are
incredibly different we share an appreciation for a certain type of
living the web which is why I’m very grateful to have her as a guest on
this series.

<h2>
Let’s start from the basics: can you introduce yourself?
</h2>
<p>
I was born and raised in the southern United States. I think I got a
reasonably decent public education in an era just before the education
system, both higher and lower, started becoming extremist
indoctrination. You’ll find countless Gen Xers online these days
reminiscing about the things we used to do as kids. There’s not much I
can add to that as far as everyday life goes.
</p>
<p>
I became an avid fan of science fiction at an early age, and developed a
fascination with history, science, electronics, and computers. The two
latter were the same hobby back then, actually. You had to understand
electronics to mess around with computers.
</p>
<h2>
What’s the story behind your blog?
</h2>
<p>
The funny thing is that I don’t really call my website a “blog” or
consider myself to be a “blogger” per se. I didn’t really have a plan or
goal for what I wanted to do with my personal website when I started it.
I only knew that the social media paradigm wasn’t working for me, and I
needed to do something else.
</p>
<p>
My stock in trade has long been shitposting on “free speech” forums and
social media. I have a habit of getting banned from social media sites
because the normies don’t get my sense of humor. I’m not interested in
making my opinions “advertiser-friendly,” nor in virtue-signaling to
censorious, self-righteous ideologues. It’s popular amongst the
simple-minded these days to label people as bigots on the basis of
colorful remarks. In so doing, the self-appointed thought police often
completely miss the point the writer was trying to make. As a feral Gen
Xer, I don’t have the patience to walk on eggshells around thin-skinned
people. If I can’t be honest and authentic, then why bother?
</p>
<p>
An essential aspect of my modus operandi is to always return to a “last
known good” state when current conditions aren’t yielding favorable
results. I’ve been on the World Wide Web since 1994, and have owned
personal websites before. I mean that’s what everybody did when the
Internet was first opened to the public. The ever-growing litany of
creative constraints imposed by social media over the years more or less
forced my return to the “real” Internet.
</p>
<p>
The name “Devastatia” was a nickname I made up for a cat I used to have.
Audrey and her big brother Elvis liked to tear things up, as cats do, so
I gave them the nicknames Dr. Destructo and his lovely assistant,
Devastatia. It had a gothy ring to it, and since I’m a goth, I thought
it’d make a catchy screen name.
</p>
<p>
I thought it would be funny to spoof social media “influencers” —
low-talent midwits with swollen egos — so I built a sort of role-playing
character around that idea. That’s how Devastatia was born.
</p>
<h2>
What does your creative process look like when it comes to blogging?
</h2>
<p>
You’ve heard the expression, “The jokes write themselves,” right? Well,
the Internet is basically one big lolcow for those of us who can see the
humor in almost anything. Most of my social commentary and shitposting
is in response to things I see online.
</p>
<p>
Nearly everything I write is my own opinion and shouldn’t be taken as
fact. “Fact-checking” has acquired an unsavory connotation for me due to
the way it’s ham-handedly rammed down our throats, sans nuance or
context, by ideologues in the mainstream media and on social media. When
I do research something, it’s usually just a quick Web search in which I
choose a few links that have intriguing titles or summaries, not
necessarily the “most relevant” results as decided by the search
engines. Some of those links lead to fact-checking articles, but they’re
not typically the agenda-driven kind.
</p>
<p>
I re-read and edit the crap out of an article after I publish it,
usually for hours, and sometimes for days. I’m careful not to make
spelling or grammatical errors, but some occasionally slip through. I
catch most of them the same day by re-reading though. Most of my editing
is done to improve the flow of a passage, to add content I forgot to
include in the first draft, or to express something in a more
picturesque way. Sometimes I’ll come up with a relevant joke hours
later, and throw it in retroactively to liven the piece up.
</p>
<p>
I think the most glaring error I’ve made was a continuity error in one
of my erotic short stories. A reader brought it to my attention months
after the piece was published. A peripheral character, coincidentally
named Manuel, was identified as the brother of a main character in one
episode, but as his cousin in the following episode.
</p>
<p>
I write a lot about Web development because that’s what interests me. I
decorate my pages with irrelevant naughty pictures because I like
looking at them, and my readers tell me they do too. I aim to be nerdy,
funny, and sexy at the same time. I think I mostly succeed at that.
</p>
<h2>
Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe the
physical space influences your creativity?
</h2>
<p>
I just need for it to be reasonably quiet and dark. When I started
messing with computers, everything was green or amber text in a
fixed-width font on a black background — which, incidentally, is why my
website resembles an old school terminal. I use a dark mode browser
plugin on every site I visit. Staring at a page with a white background
is like staring into a flashlight. Why would anybody do such a thing?
</p>
<p>
I usually don’t notice my physical surroundings at all once I get into
the groove. I keep the temperature at around 77° Fahrenheit and wear as
few clothes as possible, so I don’t even feel the air, really.
</p>
<p>
I’m also blind in my right eye and nearsighted in the left, so I sit
pretty close to the monitor. Most of the items on my desk have dark
colors, so I don’t really notice anything in my peripheral vision when
there are no lights on nearby.
</p>
<p>
I use a 75% mechanical keyboard with Cherry MX switches, again because
that’s what I’m used to from the early days of home computing. I detest
touch screens and keyboards with short-travel switches.
</p>
<h2>
A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your tech
stack?
</h2>
<p>
My basic tools are <a href="https://www.geany.org/">Geany</a>, a coding
text editor for Linux similar to UltraEdit or Notepad++ for Windows;
FileZilla, an FTP client that’s ubiquitous on Windows, Mac, and Linux
PCs; and Firefox. If I happen to be in the terminal and need to take a
quick look at something, I’ll open it in vim. I haven’t used Github that
much since I left the corporate world. The tools I use now are the same
ones I used when I first started making personal websites years ago.
</p>
<p>
All of my sites are hosted on
<a href="https://siteground.com/">SiteGround</a>. Page loads are very
fast, their tech support is prompt and effective, and their “grow big”
plan gives me everything I need. I don’t remember where I registered my
domain name. It’s registered either through SiteGround or DreamHost.
</p>
<p>
I absolutely hate reading other people’s code. When I worked as a
professional developer, I became disenchanted with the emphasis on
integrating third-party software over writing custom code. I’m not an
integrator, and I’m definitely not a “coder.” I’m a programmer. That’s
what I got into this racket to do, and now that I have full creative
control, that’s what I do.
</p>
<p>
With the exception of a couple of PHP packages and some code snippets
borrowed from Stack Overflow and elsewhere, everything on my site is
hand-coded by me. I don’t use third-party frameworks or general-purpose
libraries period, let alone a third-party CMS. Everything is written
either specifically for its task or as a component that I can reuse for
multiple similar tasks.
</p>
<h2>
Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would you do
anything differently?
</h2>
<p>
I think the question presumes I have a purpose or goal in mind when I
start something, which isn’t necessarily the case. I’ll oftentimes start
working on something because I find the technology interesting, and the
use case will present itself later.
</p>
<p>
That said, my current website is showing its limitations, and I’m slowly
developing the next version. This is only my second single-page
application (SPA), and the first in which I got everything working as
expected. I’ve constantly added features over the past seven or eight
months, and it’s reached the point where it’d be easier to rewrite most
of it from scratch than to keep adding onto the existing platform.
</p>
<p>
I won’t change my domain name or the name of my site because it’s the
name I’m known by. One doesn’t change a trademark that has achieved
brand recognition without a good reason. Companies only do so when they
get a bad reputation due to scandal. Well, I’m not overly concerned
about my reputation. I mean I have a slutty online persona and write
naughty stories, both by choice. Those things are fun for me, and I
don’t believe that’ll ever change.
</p>
<h2>
Financial question since the Web is obsessed with money: how much does
it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost, or does it generate some
revenue? And what’s your position on people monetising personal blogs?
</h2>
<p>
It’d be difficult to separate the cost of running my personal site from
the cost of running my other sites because they’re all on a single
hosting plan. Moreover, the plan includes capabilities that aren’t
available with the typical “basic” plan because, as somebody who
compulsively tinkers with technology, I know I’ll use them. I also
prefer traditional .com, .net, or .org domain names when available,
which tend to cost a little more than some of the newer “personal
website” top-level domains.
</p>
<p>
I have three sites at the moment, and will probably build others. As of
now, simple division of the total cost by the number of sites yields an
average cost of about 156 USD per year. That’s about what I’d pay for
three domain names and individual hosting plans from the same company,
and the per-site cost will decrease as I add more sites.
</p>
<p>
I don’t try to monetize my site, nor make any effort to promote it in
the major search engines. This is a personal project that I work on for
the fun of it. The Personal Web as a community has plenty of grassroots
ways to help a website gain attention — webrings, listing sites, blog
carnivals, etc. — from those who are interested in personal websites.
</p>
<p>
I don’t have anything against other people monetizing their blogs if
they choose to do so, but it’s not for me. Again, this is all for fun
and “at will.” I don’t want to be held to other people’s expectations
regarding deadlines, messaging, or the type or quality of content I
produce.
</p>
<h2>
Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth checking out?
And also, who do you think I should be interviewing next?
</h2>
<p>
One of the most fascinating people I know on the Personal Web isn’t a
blogger at all. Magill, or
<a href="https://bohemiansultriness.nekoweb.org/">Fritzi</a> as she’s
known on the Personal Web, is a well-read 60s pop culture aficionado
who, in addition to making charming little brochure sites, publishes
<a href="https://theliverpudlianbardot.neocities.org/">erotic Beatles
fan fiction</a> on <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/">Archive of Our
Own</a> (AO3). Fritzi isn’t a professional Web designer, but you’d never
guess it because she’s exceptionally talented.
</p>
<p>
And you’ll definitely want to interview
<a href="https://sarajaksa.eu/">Sara Jaksa</a>. Sara is a brilliant
woman whose correspondence I enjoy immensely. I’d love to hear from her
more frequently, but I understand that her work keeps her very busy.
What I like most about Sara is that she doesn’t give shallow answers,
but considers things deeply before forming an opinion. It’d be
interesting to read her answers to some of your questions.
</p>
<h2>
Final question: is there anything you want to share with us?
</h2>
<p>
I’m a blurter. Anything I want to share will most likely appear on my
website the moment it wanders into my mind. I use my site the same way
I’d use Twitter if I weren’t banned from there. I’m always throwing
things at the wall to see what’ll stick.
</p>
<p>
As for projects, I’m working on a free RSS feed reader for personal
website feeds called <a href="https://www.geeklyreader.com/">The Geekly
Reader</a>. Commercial readers making money from blogs that the authors
themselves haven’t monetized just doesn’t sit well with me. In my view,
they’re the same as low-effort YouTubers whose videos are nothing but a
text-to-speech program reading a Reddit thread. The days of corporations
profiting from other people’s free content need to end.
</p>
<p>
When I heard that 123Guestbook is shutting down in July, I started a
project at <a href="https://personal-web.org/">Personal-Web.org</a> to
provide a replacement for static website owners who use 123Guestbook.
Depending on how much utilization that service gets, I may provide other
hosted widgets later.

id="chinas-top-prosecutor-urges-officials-to-focus-on-illicit-drug-trafficking">China’s
top prosecutor urges officials to focus on illicit drug trafficking</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BEIJING — China’s top prosecutor urged law enforcement officials
across the country on Friday to focus efforts on combating drug
trafficking, capping a week in which Beijing and Washington announced a
rare joint counternarcotics investigation.</p>
<p>The Supreme People’s Procuratorate published “six typical cases,”
involving actions ranging from postal fraud to medical professionals
selling illicit drugs on the side, and clarified the legal application
standards to handle such cases.</p>
<p>The prosecutor said in a statement that the release was meant to show
its “determination and attitude to intensify efforts to crack down on
related crimes, while hoping that this batch of typical cases will serve
as a warning to the society.”</p>
<p>The United States and China held high-level counternarcotics talks on
Thursday following a breakthrough in bilateral cooperation this week in
which both sides went after a major drug-linked money laundering
operation.</p>
<p>The United States, where fentanyl abuse has been a major cause of
death, has pushed China for deeper law enforcement cooperation,
including tackling illicit finance and further controls on the chemicals
that can be used to make fentanyl.</p>
<p>These chemicals are often shipped to the U.S. and other destinations
from China using mail packages that have unverifiable addresses or are
mislabeled, experts say. The U.S. Postal Service has for years struggled
with the problem.</p>
<p>One of the examples highlighted in the prosecutor’s note on Friday
involved a case of a Chinese buyer, surnamed Yan, purchasing date-rape
drug triazolam from overseas and then selling it in China by mail using
mislabeled packaging.</p>
<p>As a result, “the procuratorate issued a procuratorial suggestion to
the postal administration department…urging the regulatory department to
fulfill its main responsibility and perform its duties
conscientiously.”</p>
<p>The postal administration then “urged the company to make timely
rectifications,” the prosecutor said.</p>
<p>The note said “the procuratorate invited nearly 100 couriers and
college students to attend the trial, focusing on the new
characteristics and new forms of new drug cases to carry out anti-drug
law publicity.”</p>
<p>Postal fraud was briefly mentioned in the opening remarks by Rahul
Gupta, director of the White House Office of National Drug Control
Policy, who on Thursday held talks in Beijing with China’s minister of
public security, Wang Xiaohong.</p>
<p>Gupta said it was among the “areas where we’re both being negatively
impacted,” listing it alongside illicit finance, “illegal drug
trafficking and use, and the emergence of new and more dangerous
drugs.”</p>

<h2 id="us-bans-russias-kaspersky-antivirus-software">US bans Russia’s
Kaspersky antivirus software</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration on Thursday
banned Russia-based cybersecurity firm Kaspersky from providing its
popular antivirus products in the United States over national security
concerns, the U.S. Commerce Department said.</p>
<p>“Kaspersky will generally no longer be able to, among other
activities, sell its software within the United States or provide
updates to software already in use,” the agency said in a statement.</p>
<p>The announcement came after a lengthy investigation found Kaspersky’s
“continued operations in the United States presented a national security
risk due to the Russian Government’s offensive cyber capabilities and
capacity to influence or direct Kaspersky’s operations,” it said.</p>
<p>U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said, “Russia has shown time
and again they have the capability and intent to exploit Russian
companies, like Kaspersky Lab, to collect and weaponize sensitive U.S.
information.”</p>
<p>Kaspersky, in a statement to AFP, said the Commerce Department “made
its decision based on the present geopolitical climate and theoretical
concerns,” and vowed to “pursue all legally available options to
preserve its current operations and relationships.”</p>
<p>“Kaspersky does not engage in activities which threaten U.S. national
security and, in fact, has made significant contributions with its
reporting and protection from a variety of threat actors that targeted
U.S. interests and allies,” the company said.</p>
<p>The move is the first such action taken since an executive order
issued under Donald Trump’s presidency gave the Commerce Department the
power to investigate whether certain companies pose a national security
risk.</p>
<p>Raimondo said the Commerce Department’s actions demonstrated to
America’s adversaries that it would not hesitate to act when “their
technology poses a risk to the United States and its citizens.”</p>
<p>While Kaspersky is headquartered in Moscow, it has offices in 31
countries around the world, servicing more than 400 million users and
270,000 corporate clients in more than 200 countries, the Commerce
Department said.</p>
<p>As well as banning the sale of Kaspersky’s antivirus software, the
Commerce Department also added three entities linked to the firm to a
list of companies deemed to be a national security concern, “for their
cooperation with Russian military and intelligence authorities in
support of the Russian government’s cyber intelligence objectives.”</p>
<p>The Commerce Department said it “strongly encouraged” users to switch
to new vendors, although its decision does not ban them from using the
software should they choose to do so.</p>
<p>Kaspersky is allowed to continue certain operations in the United
States, including providing antivirus updates, until September 29, “in
order to minimize disruption to US consumers and businesses and to give
them time to find suitable alternatives,” it added.</p>

id="border-patrol-reports-arrests-down-25-since-biden-announced-asylum-restrictions">Border
Patrol reports arrests down 25% since Biden announced asylum
restrictions</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The number of arrests by Border Patrol agents of people
crossing illegally into the United States fell in May to the third
lowest of any month during the Biden presidency, while preliminary
figures released Thursday show encounters with migrants falling even
more in the roughly two weeks since the president announced new rules
restricting asylum. </p>
<p>The figures are likely welcome news for a White House that has been
struggling to show to voters concerned about immigration that it has
control of the southern border. But the number of people coming to the
border is often in flux, dependent on conditions in countries far from
the U.S. and on smugglers who profit from global migration. </p>
<p>The Border Patrol made 117,900 arrests of people entering the country
between the official border crossing points in May, Customs and Border
Protection said in a news release. That’s 9% lower than during April,
the agency said. The agency said preliminary data since President Joe
Biden’s June 4 announcement restricting asylum access show arrests have
fallen by 25%. </p>
<p>“Our enforcement efforts are continuing to reduce Southwest border
encounters. But the fact remains that our immigration system is not
resourced for what we are seeing,” said Troy A. Miller, the acting head
of CBP. </p>
<p>The U.S. has also benefited from aggressive enforcement on the
Mexican side of the border, where Mexican authorities have been working
to prevent migrants from making their way to the U.S.-Mexico
border. </p>
<p>The figures are part of a range of data related to immigration, trade
and drug seizures that the CBP releases monthly. The immigration-related
figures are closely watched at a time of intense political scrutiny over
who is entering the country and whether the Biden administration has a
handle on the situation. </p>
<p>Immigration is a top concern for voters, with many saying Biden
hasn’t been doing enough to secure the country’s borders. Former
President Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for
president, has made immigration a cornerstone of his campaign by saying
he’s going to deport people in the country illegally en masse and take
other measures to crack down on immigration. </p>
<p>After Biden announced his plan to restrict asylum access at the
southern border, opponents sued, saying it was no different from a
similar effort under Trump.</p>

id="a-us-veteran-died-alone-hundreds-of-strangers-came-to-say-goodbye">A
US veteran died alone; hundreds of strangers came to say goodbye</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>AUGUSTA, Maine — Former U.S. Marine Gerry Brooks died alone at a
nursing home in Maine, abandoned and all but forgotten. Then the funeral
home posted a notice asking if anyone would serve as a pallbearer or
simply attend his burial. </p>
<p>Within minutes, it was turning away volunteers to carry his
casket. </p>
<p>A bagpiper came forward to play at the service. A pilot offered to
perform a flyover. Military groups across the state pledged a proper
sendoff. </p>
<p>Hundreds of people who knew nothing about the 86-year-old beyond his
name showed up on a sweltering afternoon and gave Brooks a final salute
with full military honors Thursday at the Maine Veterans’ Memorial
Cemetery in Augusta. </p>
<p>Patriot Guard Riders on motorcycles escorted his hearse on the
40-mile route from the funeral home in Belfast, Maine, to the cemetery.
Members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars paid tribute with a 21-gun
salute. Volunteers held American flags next to the casket while a crane
hoisted a huge flag above the cemetery entrance. </p>
<p>Some saluted while filing by. Others sang The Marines’ Hymn. </p>
<p>“It’s an honor for us to be able to do this,” said Jim Roberts,
commander of the VFW post in Belfast. “There’s so much negativity in the
world. This is something people can feel good about and rally around.
It’s just absolutely wonderful.” He said Brooks’ son, granddaughter and
son-in-law came to the funeral but did not speak during the
service. </p>
<p>‘We will always be there’</p>
<p>The VFW is called a couple times a year about a deceased veteran with
no family or with one that isn’t willing to handle the funeral
arrangements, said Roberts. But “we will always be there.” Like other
veterans helping out Thursday, he hadn’t known Brooks. </p>
<p>So many groups volunteered to take part in paying tribute that there
wasn’t enough space to fit them into the 20-minute burial service, said
Katie Riposta, the funeral director who put out the call for help last
week. </p>
<p>“It renews your faith in humanity,” she said. </p>
<p>More than 8 million of the U.S. veterans living are 65 or older,
almost half the veteran population. They are overwhelmingly men. That’s
according to a U.S. Census Bureau report last year. As this generation
dies, it said, their collective memory of wartime experiences “will pass
into history.” </p>
<p>A master of ‘dad jokes’</p>
<p>Much about Brooks’ life is unknown. </p>
<p>He was widowed and lived in Augusta. He died on May 18, less than a
week after entering a nursing home, Riposta said. A cause of death was
not released. </p>
<p>The funeral home and authorities reached his next of kin, but no one
was willing to come forward or take responsibility for his body, she
said. </p>
<p>“It sounds like he was a good person, but I know nothing about his
life,” Riposta said, noting that after Brooks’ death, a woman contacted
the funeral home to say he had once taken her in when she had no other
place to go, with no details. </p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter if he served one day or made the military his
career,” she said. “He still deserves to be respected and not
alone.” </p>
<p>The crowd on Thursday wasn’t all strangers — and it turned out Brooks
hadn’t been one, either. </p>
<p>Victoria Abbott, executive director of the Bread of Life shelter in
Augusta, said he had come every day to eat at their soup kitchen, always
ready to crack “dad jokes” and make the staff smile. He had a favorite
table. </p>
<p>“Your quintessential 80-year-old, dad jokes every day,” Abbott said.
“He was really great to have around. He was part of the soup kitchen
family.” </p>
<p>But most people there Thursday met him too late. The memorial book
posted online by Direct Cremation of Maine, which helped to arrange the
burial, had a few strangers’ good wishes. </p>
<p>“Sir,” one began, and ended with “Semper Fi.” </p>
<p>The two others, a couple, thanked Brooks for his service. “We all
deserve the love kindness and respect when we are called home. I hope
that you lived a full beautiful life of Love, Kindness, Dreams and
Hope,” they wrote. </p>
<p>They added: “Thank you to all those who will make this gentleman’s
service a proper, well-deserved goodbye.” </p>
<p>Linda Laweryson, who served in the Marines, said this was the second
funeral in little over a year that she has attended for a veteran who
died alone. Everyone deserves to die with dignity and be buried with
dignity, she said. </p>
<p>Laweryson read a poem during the graveside service written by a
combat Marine who reflects on the spot where Marines graduate from boot
camp. </p>
<p>“I walked the old parade ground, but I was not alone,” the poem
reads. “I walked the old parade ground and knew that I was home.”</p>

<h2 id="us-sleepwalking-into-space-disaster-lawmaker-warns">US
‘sleepwalking’ into space disaster, lawmaker warns</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — A key U.S. lawmaker warned Thursday that Russia is on
the verge of ushering in the end of the Space Age with its new, nuclear
anti-satellite weaponry.</p>
<p>House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Turner, an Ohio
Republican, told an audience in Washington that allowing Russia to gain
such an advantage would be catastrophic. He called on President Joe
Biden to mount an aggressive response.</p>
<p>“This crisis is the Cuban missile crisis in space,” Turner said,
comparing the moment to the 1962 confrontation between the U.S. and the
former Soviet Union, which took both sides to the brink of nuclear
conflict.</p>
<p>But in this case, Turner said, Russia could unilaterally impose high
costs on the U.S. simply by detonating a nuclear anti-satellite weapon
in orbit.</p>
<p>“This threat would mean that our economic, international security and
social systems come to a grinding halt,” he said. “This would be a
catastrophic and devastating attack upon Western economic and democratic
systems.”</p>
<p>Turner, who accused Biden of “sleepwalking into an irreversible day
zero,” called on the White House to immediately declassify all of its
intelligence on the Russian program to make the world aware of the full
extent of the threat.</p>
<p>The White House on Thursday rejected Turner’s accusations.</p>
<p>“He’s just wrong. He’s just flat-out wrong,” White House national
security spokesman John Kirby told reporters.</p>
<p>“We have absolutely taken this very seriously,” Kirby said. “We’ve
been working this particular problem set from every possible angle,
including through intense diplomacy with countries around the world and,
obviously, through direct conversations with Russia.”</p>
<p>Russia has repeatedly denied the U.S. accusations, including last
month when Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov dismissed concerns as
“fake news.”</p>
<p>“The Americans can say whatever they want, but our policy does not
change,” Ryabkov told the Interfax news agency, adding that Moscow,
“always consistently opposed the deployment of strike weapons in
low-Earth orbit.”</p>
<p>Turner first raised concerns about the prospect of a Russian
anti-satellite weapons program in February, when he issued a statement
warning of “a serious national security threat” and issued his initial
call for the White House to declassify the relevant intelligence.</p>
<p>Biden responded by confirming that Russia was developing a
space-based, anti-satellite weapons system but added there was no
indication that Russia had decided to move ahead with the program and
that there was no nuclear threat to anyone on Earth.</p>
<p>Concerns spiked last month when the U.S. accused Russia of using a
May 16 space launch to deploy what the U.S. Defense Department described
as an anti-satellite weapon “capable of attacking other satellites in
low-Earth orbit.”</p>
<p>“Russia deployed this new counterspace weapon into the same orbit as
a U.S. government satellite,” Major General Pat Ryder, Pentagon press
secretary, said at the time. “So, you know, obviously that’s something
that we’ll continue to monitor.”</p>

<h2 id="is-2024-the-year-of-windows-on-the-desktop">Is 2024 the year of
Windows on the desktop?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-20, from: OS News</p>
<p>It should be no secret to anyone reading OSNews that I’m not exactly
a fan of Windows. While I grew up using MS-DOS, Windows 3.x, and Windows
9x, the move to Windows XP was a sour one for me, and ever since I’ve
vastly preferred first BeOS, and then Linux. When, thanks to the
tireless efforts of the Wine community and Valve gaming on Linux became
a boring, it-just-works affair, I said goodbye to my final gaming-only
Windows installation about four or so years ago. However, I also
strongly believe that in order to be able to fairly criticise or dislike
something, you should at least have experience with it. As such, I
decided it was time for what I expected was going to be some serious
technology BDSM, and I installed Windows 11 on my workstation and force
myself to use it for a few weeks to see if Microsoft’s latest operating
system truly was as bad as I make it out to be in my head. Installing
Windows 11 Technically speaking, my workstation is not supported by
Windows 11. Despite packing two Intel Xeon E5 V4 2640 CPUs for a total
of 20 cores and 40 threads, 32 GB of ECC RAM, an AMD Radeon Pro w5700,
and the usual stuff like an M.2 SSD, this machine apparently did not
meet the minimum specifications for Windows 11 since it has no TPM 2.0
security chip, and the processors were deemed too old. Luckily, these
limitations are entirely artificial and meaningless, and using Ventoy,
which by default disables these silly restrictions, I was able to
install Windows 11 just fine. During installation, you run into the
first problem if you’re coming from a different operating system – even
after all these years, Windows still does not give a single hootin’ toot
about any existing operating systems or bootloaders on your machine.
This wasn’t an issue for me since I was going to allow Windows to take
over the entire machine, but for those of used to have control over what
happens when we install our operating systems, be advised that your
other operating systems will most likely be rendered unbootable. The
tools you have access to during installation for things like disk
partitioning are also incredibly limited, and there’s nothing like the
live environments you’re used to from the Linux world – all you get is
an installer. In addition, since Windows only really supports FAT and
NTFS file systems, your existing ext4, btrfs, UFS, or ZFS partitions
used by your Linux or BSD installs will not work at all in Windows.
Again – be advised that Windows is a very limited operating system
compared to Linux or BSD. Once the actual installation part is done,
you’re treated to a lengthy – and I truly mean lengthy – out of box
experience. This is where you first get a glimpse of just how much data
Microsoft wants to collect from its Windows users, and it stands in
stark contrast to what I’m used to as a Linux user. On my Linux
distribution of choice, Fedora KDE, there’s really only KDE’s opt-in,
voluntary User Feedback option, which only collects basic system
information in an entirely anonymous way. Windows, meanwhile, seems to
want to collect pretty much everything you do on your machine, and while
there’s some prompts to reduce the amount of data it collects, even with
everything set to minimum it’s still quite a lot. Once you’re past the
out of box experience, you can finally start using your new Windows
installation – but actually not really. Unlike a Linux distribution,
where all your hardware is detected automatically and will use the
latest drivers, on Windows, you will most likely have to do some manual
driver hunting, searching the web for PCI and vendor IDs to hopefully
locate the correct drivers, which isn’t always easy. To make matters
worse, even if Windows Update installs the correct drivers for you,
those are often outdated, and you’re better off downloading the latest
versions straight from the vendors’ websites. This is especially
problematic for motherboard drivers – motherboard vendor websites often
list horribly outdated drivers. Updating Windows 11 Once you have all
the drivers installed and updated, which often requires several reboots,
you might notice that your system seems to be awfully busy, even when
you’re not actually doing anything with it. Most likely, this means
Windows Update is running in the background, sucking up a lot of system
resources. If you’re used to Linux or BSD, where updating is a quick and
centralised process, updating things on Windows is a complete and utter
mess. Instead of just updating everything all at once, Windows Update
will often require several different rounds of updates, marked by
reboots. You’ll also discover that Windows Update is not only incredibly
slow both when it comes to downloading and installing, but that it’s
also incredibly buggy. Updates will randomly fail to install for no
apparent reason, and there’s a whole cottage industry of useless ML and
SEO content on the internet trying to “help” you fix these issues. On my
system, without doing anything, Windows Update managed to break itself
in less than 24 hours – it listed 79 (!) driver updates related to the
two Xeon processors (I assume it listed certain drivers for every single
of the 40 threads), but every single one of them, save for one or two,
would fail to install with a useless generic error code. Every time I
tried to install them, one or two more would install, with everything
else failing, until eventually the update process just hung the entire
system. A few days later, the listed updated just disappeared entirely
from Windows Update. The updates had no KB numbers, so it was impossible
to find any information on them, and to this day, I have no idea what
was going on here. Even after battling your way through Windows Update,
you’re not done actually updating your system. Unlike,</p>

asks Vietnam to support Ukraine’s sovereignty, territorial
integrity</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The United States called on Vietnam Thursday to support
Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity following Vladimir
Putin’s one-day visit to Hanoi, part of the Russian president’s brief
Asian tour seeking to shore up alliances in the face of mounting Western
sanctions.</p>
<p>“We expect that any country, when it engages in conversations with
the government of Russia, and especially when it hosts leaders from the
government of Russia, will make clear their respect for the principles
of the U.N. Charter, including sovereignty and territorial integrity,
and convey that those principles must be upheld across the world,” State
Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told VOA during a briefing on
Thursday.</p>
<p>US diplomat to Hanoi</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the State Department’s top diplomat for Asia is traveling
to Hanoi to reaffirm ties after the U.S. and Vietnam upgraded their
bilateral relationship last year.</p>
<p>Daniel J. Kritenbrink, assistant secretary of state for East Asian
and Pacific affairs, will travel to Hanoi, Vietnam, June 21 to 22,
according to a State Department press release.</p>
<p>Kritenbrink will meet with senior Vietnam government officials “to
underscore the strong U.S. commitment to implementing the U.S.-Vietnam
Comprehensive Strategic Partnership and to working with Vietnam in
support of a free and open Indo-Pacific region,” said the release.</p>
<p>Kritenbrink’s trip was planned “well before” Putin’s visit to Hanoi,
said Miller.</p>
<p>Vietnam maintains three tiers of diplomatic relationship with other
countries: Comprehensive Partnerships; Strategic Partnerships; and
Comprehensive Strategic Partnerships. The United States, China and
Russia are among the countries that maintain top-tier ties with
Vietnam.</p>
<p>U.S. officials did not have an assessment, when asked by reporters,
if there is any indication that Vietnamese companies or people are
providing material support to Moscow for its war on Ukraine, or whether
Washington has warned Hanoi against it.</p>
<p>At the White House, John Kirby, the National Security Council
communications adviser, told reporters that the U.S. will “stay focused
on continuing to deepen” the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership with
Vietnam and “broaden it, improve it, for our own mutual benefit to each
other and to the region.”</p>
<p>Putin’s visit to North Korea</p>
<p>Russia and Vietnam pledged Thursday to deepen ties during a state
visit by Putin aimed at bolstering his alliances to counter Western
efforts to isolate Moscow over the war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Russia and Vietnam “want to push up cooperation in defense and
security, how to deal with nontraditional security challenges on the
basis of international law, for peace and security in the region and the
world,” Vietnamese President To Lam told reporters after talks with
Putin.</p>
<p>Putin traveled to Vietnam, a close ally of Moscow since the Cold War,
after talks in Pyongyang with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Those two
countries signed a mutual defense pact.</p>
<p>“It’s a significant visit,” said William Courtney, an adjunct senior
fellow at the Rand Research organization about Putin’s trip to Vietnam
amid Russia’s war on Ukraine and Russia’s growing isolation over that
war.</p>
<p>“There’s no question Vietnam does depend on Russia for oil, for
military equipment and some technology,” Courtney said. “But Vietnam
appears to be now trying to broaden its aperture to look in other
directions for military equipment as well. One reason might be that
Vietnam has seen that a lot of Russian military equipment has performed
poorly in Ukraine.”</p>
<p>In Washington, Republican Representative Mike Turner, who is the
chairperson of the U.S. House of Representatives Permanent Select
Committee on Intelligence, voiced concerns over the possibility of
Russia providing North Korea with technological assistance to improve
its long-range ballistic missiles and their ability to directly target
the United States.</p>
<p>“I think we’ve all sort of felt intuitively that China, Russia, North
Korea, Iran are working together in both their development of
capabilities and in their threats to the United States. These symbolic
meetings, I think, should allow us to focus on this as a threat that has
already been occurring,” Turner said during an event at the
Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.</p>

Correspondent Jeff Seldin and Kim Lewis contributed to this report. Some

<p class="drop-caps">
If the global shipping industry were its own nation, it would be the
sixth largest emitter of carbon dioxide, belching about
<a href="https://oecdstatistics.blog/2023/06/15/new-estimates-provide-insights-on-co2-emissions-from-global-shipping/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
billion tons</u></a> of the stuff into the atmosphere every year. And
not to state the obvious, but the sector isn’t going anywhere. Not only
is cargo shipping the means by which 80% of global trade is carried out,
but transporting goods via ship is actually much more fuel-efficient
than the alternatives.
</p>
<p>
That means that slashing shipping emissions, which account for
<a href="https://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Environment/Pages/Fourth-IMO-Greenhouse-Gas-Study-2020.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>nearly
3% of the global total</u></a>, is 100% necessary for a decarbonized
future. But unlike most other industries, there’s a global regulatory
body — the International Maritime Organization — that can set goals and
mandates to ensure that decarbonization happens on schedule. The IMO is
targeting
<a href="https://www.imo.org/en/MediaCentre/PressBriefings/pages/Revised-GHG-reduction-strategy-for-global-shipping-adopted-.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>net-zero
shipping emissions by 2050</u></a>, with a 40% reduction in the carbon
intensity of international shipping by 2030 compared to 2008. And while
these goals aren’t binding,
<a href="https://www.imo.org/en/MediaCentre/Pages/WhatsNew-2055.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>forthcoming
measures</u></a> set to be developed and adopted late next year will be.
</p>
<p>
Shipping decarbonization is still in its early infancy though, meaning
the pathway to net zero remains highly unclear — <em><em>and
</em></em>that there’s lots of room for technological innovation. One
company that’s gained traction in the past few years is aiming more at
the “net” than the “zero” part of that equation — rather than develop
clean fuels, UK-based startup Seabound is retrofitting ships with
onboard carbon capture devices. The process uses a technology called
calcium-looping that allows the company to capture carbon from the
ship’s exhaust system, essentially locking it up in a limestone rock,
and then process it later on land.
</p>
<p>
Though it’s relatively unproven, onboard carbon capture has the
potential to gain ground quickly if it can be shown to work at scale.
But precisely because the<em> </em>technology is unproven, the industry
is far from unified in the idea that it will play a consequential role
in the final decarbonization picture. “Alternative fuels are probably
going to be the dominant solution,” Aparajit Pandey, shipping
decarbonization lead at the think tank RMI, told me.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, low and zero-carbon fuels made from green methanol or ammonia
(which are themselves made from green hydrogen) are widely considered
the leading contenders in this space — while methanol does produce some
CO2 when burned, it’s much cleaner than fossil fuels due to its low
carbon and high oxygen content, and ammonia contains no carbon at all.
But it could take a while to ramp up production to meet the industry’s
ravenous fuel demand. Plus, repowering an existing ship with ammonia or
methanol requires an expensive and time-consuming engine retrofit, and
turning over the entire global fleet could take decades.
</p>
<p>
Other ideas and approaches abound.
<a href="https://www.goodfuels.com/sustainable-shipping" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Biofuels?
</u></a>They come with a familiar host of concerns, plus fuel production
is inherently limited by the amount of biomass that’s available.
<a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/voltic" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Solar-powered
ships? </u></a> Folks are trying, but current panels aren’t nearly
energy dense enough to power a freighter on their own.
<a href="https://www.fleetzero.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Electrifying
ships?</u></a> It definitely makes sense for smaller vessels like
ferries and tugboats, but batteries also take up a lot of space that
could otherwise be used for freight. They also need to be either charged
or swapped, requiring infrastructure that just doesn’t exist yet.
</p>
<p>
“Carbon capture is probably the only way that you can get a meaningful
amount of emissions reduction in any near term way,” Clea Kolster,
partner and head of science at Lowercarbon Capital, told me, referring
to the cargo shipping industry. Lowercarbon led Seabound’s $4.4 million
seed round two years ago.
</p>
<p>
This is not a zero sum calculation, however. Seabound CEO Alisha
Fredricksson told me that she believes both methanol and ammonia fuels
have a significant role to play. “They’re just taking a long time to
develop. And so we won’t have sufficient supply for another 10, 20 years
or so.”
</p>
<p>
Seabound’s system works by reacting the CO2 in a ship’s exhaust gas with
calcium oxide to form solid calcium carbonate (aka limestone). This
essentially locks the carbon away in small pebbles, which are unloaded
when the ship docks. Because Seabound doesn’t purify or compress the CO2
onboard, the company says its system requires “negligible” amounts of
additional fuel to operate. Once on land, the plan is for Seabound to
either sell the limestone for use as a building material or to separate
the CO2 and calcium oxide; the latter could then be reused to capture
more carbon, while the former could either be used to produce methanol
shipping fuel or geologically sequestered.
</p>
<p>
There are other companies attempting onboard carbon capture:
<a href="https://valuemaritime.com/news/value-maritime-announces-co2-capture-unit-2/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Value
Maritime</u></a>,
<a href="https://www.mr-sustainability.com/stories/2020/worlds-first-carbon-capture-at-sea-set-for-shipping-trials" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Mitsubishi</u></a>,
and
<a href="https://www.wartsila.com/marine/products/exhaust-treatment/carbon-capture-and-storage" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Wartsila</u></a>,
among others, all of which rely on amine-based systems, a well-proven
technology for carbon removal on land. But Fredricksson told me that
miniaturizing these systems to work on ships is much more capital and
energy intensive than Seabound’s decoupled approach, which allows the
company to capture the CO2 at sea and process it later on land. This
older tech also produces liquified CO2, which she says ports are less
equipped to handle than a solid material like limestone.
</p>
<p>
Seabound completed its maiden voyage earlier this year, leaving from
Turkey and traveling around the Middle East in a months-long trip that
put their tech to the test in the real world for the first time. The
system was installed on a freighter from Lomar Shipping, and was able to
capture carbon at 78% efficiency and sulfur, a pollutant that can cause
respiratory problems and acid rain, at about 90% efficiency while it was
running.
</p>
<p>
Fredricksson and the company’s backers deemed the voyage a great
success. “We hit the results we were looking for,” she told me. But in
the grand scheme of things, the pilot was still quite small-scale.
Seabound’s system only captured about 1 metric ton of carbon per day, a
tiny percent of the ship’s overall emissions. That’s because the system
was only running for a total of around 100 hours during the two months
it was at sea. The objective, Fredricksson told me, was not to capture
as much CO2 as possible, but to demonstrate the technical feasibility of
the system and prepare for future scale-up.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, the company hopes to capture up to 95% of a ship’s carbon
emissions. But similar to batteries, this involves a space-related
tradeoff. A larger, more effective carbon capture system would mean less
room for cargo. “So I think the main goal for our engineering team over
time will be to increase the efficiency to pack more and more tons of
CO2 into each container,” Fredricksson told me. Right now, she says that
10- to 14-day voyages are Seabound’s sweet spot, given the size of its
systems. The company hopes to build its first full scale system by the
end of this year and start delivering to commercial customers in 2025.
</p>
<p>
The degree of interest in Seabound’s systems will depend in no small
part on forthcoming directives from the IMO. As of now, there’s a rule
mandating that ships calculate their energy efficiency and report it to
the organization. Fredricksson says it’s already getting harder to sell
ships with lower ratings. Pandey said he thinks future regulations could
resemble the
<a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2023/07/25/fueleu-maritime-initiative-council-adopts-new-law-to-decarbonise-the-maritime-sector/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>FuelEU
initiative</u></a>, which requires a steady decrease in the emissions
intensity of shipping fuels over time, from 2% in 2025 to up to 80% by
2050.
</p>
<p>
While it’s unclear how a rule like this would incorporate onboard carbon
capture into its framework, Pandey told me that if Seabound can prove
out its tech on a larger scale, the approach is promising. “Of the
carbon capture solutions that are out there, they’re probably the most
innovative,” he told me. But he’s not sure that the company’s aim to
commercialize by next year is realistic. “From now to prove it out to
scale, who knows? Five years, six years, seven years, something like
that,” Pandey guessed, “I think it could be viable, but it’s so early.”
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.dnv.com/maritime/publications/the-potential-of-onboard-carbon-capture-in-shipping-download/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>A
recent report</u></a> on the potential of onboard carbon capture from
DNV, an organization that maintains technical standards for ships,
agrees that a longer timeline is more likely, stating that, “With the
wider [carbon capture, utilization, and storage] infrastructure in
development, scaling up of the maritime carbon capture network will take
time and is expected to reach a broader uptake after 2030.”
</p>
<p>
Since returning from its first voyage, Seabound has reconfigured its
system to fit into modified shipping containers that are intended to
reduce retrofit time and costs. Now, if a shipowner wants to use
Seabound’s system, the primary modification involves installing pipes to
route exhaust from the ship’s smokestack or funnel to the company’s
carbon capture device. Fredricksson estimates installation costs will be
on the order of $100,000 per ship, though that will vary greatly
depending on vessel size and type.
</p>
<p>
But if that estimate is in the right ballpark, it would be orders of
magnitude cheaper than retrofitting a ship with an engine built for
ammonia or methanol fuels. And yet Pandey isn’t so sure ship operators
will be keen on either upgrade. “My strong guess is if they’re not going
to retrofit a vessel for a new engine, they’re also not going to
retrofit it for carbon capture,” Pandey told me.
</p>
<p>
Fredricksson expects Seabound will raise a Series A round later this
year or early next, to help get its first commercial units off the line.
And apparently, there’s been loads of investor interest. “Shipping and
maritime is new for the climate tech ecosystem,” Fredricksson told me,
meaning there’s lots to be gained by moving quickly and early. “There is
so much CO2 out there being emitted by ships,” Fredricksson said, “and
not a lot of solutions yet going after them.”

<p>As recent arrests of government officials show, allegations of
corruption are a precursor to a change of management in Russia. But
corruption in Russia is not a problem that can be eradicated by a change
of policy or personnel; it is a function of the system itself. What can
we expect now?</p>

Sutherland, ‘M.A.S.H.’ and ‘Hunger Games’ actor, dies at 88</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Donald Sutherland, the prolific film and television actor
whose long career stretched from “M.A.S.H.” to “The Hunger Games,” has
died. He was 88.</p>
<p>Kiefer Sutherland, the actor’s son, confirmed his father’s death
Thursday. No further details were immediately available.</p>
<p>“I personally think one of the most important actors in the history
of film,” Kiefer Sutherland said on X. “Never daunted by a role, good,
bad or ugly. He loved what he did and did what he loved, and one can
never ask for more than that.”</p>
<p>The tall and gaunt Canadian actor with a grin that could be sweet or
diabolical was known for offbeat characters such as Hawkeye Piece in
Robert Altman’s “M.A.S.H.,” the hippie tank commander in “Kelly’s
Heroes” and the stoned professor in “Animal House.”</p>
<p>Before transitioning into a long career as a respected character
actor, Sutherland epitomized the unpredictable, antiestablishment cinema
of the 1970s.</p>
<p>Over the decades, Sutherland showed his range in more buttoned-down —
but still eccentric — parts in Robert Redford’s “Ordinary People” and
Oliver Stone’s “JFK.”</p>
<p>More recently, he starred in the “Hunger Games” films and the HBO
limited series “The Undoing.” He never retired and worked regularly up
until his death.</p>
<p>“I love to work. I passionately love to work,” Sutherland told
Charlie Rose in 1998. “I love to feel my hand fit into the glove of some
other character. I feel a huge freedom — time stops for me. I’m not as
crazy as I used to be, but I’m still a little crazy.”</p>
<p>He received an honorary Oscar in 2017.</p>

id="afghan-evacuees-in-limbo-humanitarian-parole-leaves-1000s-facing-uncertainty-in-us">Afghan
evacuees in limbo: Humanitarian parole leaves 1,000s facing uncertainty
in US</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — In 2021, the United States began one of its biggest
humanitarian evacuations in history as it withdrew from Afghanistan,
resettling more than 80,000 Afghans fleeing Taliban rule in the initial
weeks of Operation Allies Welcome. However, they were brought into the
U.S. through the humanitarian parole process that gives temporary
immigration status to the displaced persons. But how has this temporary
status affected Afghan evacuees in the U.S.?</p>
<p>Upon arrival in the United States, more than 70,000 evacuees were
granted humanitarian parole for two years, a temporary immigration
status with no path to permanent residency. Uncertainty around the
humanitarian parole status has had several concrete effects on aspects
of the evacuees’ lives, including financial, employment, housing, and
mental health.</p>
<p>This process has come with many challenges for the resettled men,
women and children from Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Masi Siddiqi, who came to the United States after the Taliban took
control over Kabul, was granted admission to the prestigious Columbia
University in New York. However, his status hindered his ability to
secure funding through loans to continue his studies.</p>
<p>“I was admitted to Columbia University for the fall of 2023, and I
did attend one semester. I thought that I may be able to afford it at
first because I had my family’s support. But after doing one semester I
found out that I was financially not able to do it because I did not
qualify for Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), for
federal loans, for federal aid, grants, funds and for none of the
benefits that a U.S. citizen or non-citizen would qualify for,” Masi
said.</p>
<p>Safiullah Rauf, founder of Human First Coalition, an organization
providing aid primarily to Afghanistan and Afghans, leads a team of
hundreds to provide food, medical care and resettlement services to more
than 15,000 Afghans in need. The organization has helped evacuate more
than 7,000 people, including 1,400 U.S. nationals, since the Taliban
seized control of the country.</p>
<p>Rauf is visiting communities in the United States to gather support
for Congress to do more to support Afghans in the U.S., including in the
form of draft legislation known as the Afghan Adjustment Act.</p>
<p>“[The] Afghan Adjustment Act is one of the most important pieces of
legislation that was introduced in 2022 to help those allies we brought
to the U.S. in 2021,’’ Rauf told VOA. ’’There are over 80,000 allies
that were brought to the U.S., and many came with the humanitarian
parole. They had a two-year visa to stay in the U.S. and their future
was uncertain though the parole was extended for another year; but they
still face an uncertain future. The Afghan Adjustment Act makes sure
that all who came in 2021 go through a vetting process and after that
they will become a productive member of the society.</p>
<p>“In the United States, passing of any kind of legislation is a huge
hurdle and you have to move mountains to approve any law, especially
right now where [the] Senate and the House is most divided,’’ Rauf said.
‘’Because this bill is somewhat related to immigration, the Republicans
are very much against any immigration bills right now. However, this
bill is different than a normal immigration bill. This bill is for those
allies who supported the U.S. for over 20 years in Afghanistan and their
life will be in danger and it is a certain death if they go back to
Afghanistan. So they must be given a permanent residency here.’’</p>
<p>According to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, or USCIS,
legal assistance resources and immigration processing are experiencing
extreme delays that could span years.</p>
<p>Laila Mangal, who is working for LLS resettlement agency as a case
manager and cultural liaison in the state of Virginia, told VOA Deewa
about the challenges faced by the Afghans who came to the U.S. on short
notice and in chaotic circumstances. She expressed that the unclear
nature of evacuees’ immigration status for the near future, has posed a
critical structural barrier to their well-being and, ultimately, their
success in the U.S.</p>
<p>“When their legal case is in the process and it takes longer, the
refugees go through stress and pressure,’’ Mangal said. ’’Sometimes this
legal battle drains their mental health.”</p>
<p>Masi, the student, calls on the Senate and the House of
Representatives to pass the Afghan Adjustment Act so the displaced
Afghans can be categorized as U.S. permanent residents.</p>
<p>“As the U.S. officials say ‘we stand by our Afghan allies,’ we do
expect them to stand by their allies because I personally believe that
they have not yet stood by their Afghan allies,’’ Masi said. ‘’Not only
with the ones that are left behind but also the ones that are currently
facing the immigration limbo here in the U.S.; just like my family and
myself. I really appreciate that the senators and the representatives
from my state and from the other states should support the Afghan
Adjustment Act. I think the social media slogans are not enough by
themselves. They must push the majority leaders to bring the act to the
floor because with bipartisan support, we can have the act pass.’’</p>
<p>Like other resettled immigrants, Afghans were encouraged to find jobs
quickly and felt the pressure to do so given the high costs of living,
limited aid available, and, for some, the large families they’re
supporting. Many found low-wage jobs in manufacturing, hospitality,
retail, food processing, trucking, or ride sharing to support themselves
and their families.</p>
<p>But with the pending expiration of employment authorization documents
this fall, employment stability is at risk for some. Stakeholders shared
that because of the expiration date, some employers have begun notifying
people they will lose their jobs later this year or that they are now no
longer needed.</p>

<p>
[<a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/i-will-fucking-piledrive-you-if-you-mention-ai-again/">Nikhil
Suresh at Ludicity</a>]
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“This entire class of person is, to put it simply, abhorrent to
right-thinking people. They’re an embarrassment to people that are
actually making advances in the field, a disgrace to people that know
how to sensibly use technology to improve the world, and are also a
bunch of tedious know-nothing bastards that should be thrown into
Thought Leader Jail until they’ve learned their lesson, a prison I’m
fundraising for.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I enjoyed this very much.
</p>
<p>
Here’s the thing, though: I don’t think what Nikhil wants will happen.
</p>
<p>
I mean, don’t get me wrong: it probably <em>should</em>. The author is a
leader in his field, and his exasperation at the hype train is
well-earned.
</p>
<p>
But it’s not people like Nikhil who actually make the decisions, or
invest in the companies, or make the whole industry (or industries) tick
over. Again: it should be.
</p>
<p>
What happens again and again is that people who see that they can make
money out of a particularly hyped technology leap onto the bandwagon,
and then market the bandwagon within an inch of everybody’s lives. Stuff
that shouldn’t be widespread becomes widespread.
</p>
<p>
And here we are again with AI.
</p>
<p>
This is exactly right:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“Unless you are one of a tiny handful of businesses who know exactly
what they’re going to use AI for, you do not need AI for anything - or
rather, you do not need to do anything to reap the benefits. Artificial
intelligence, as it exists and is useful now, is probably already baked
into your businesses software supply chain.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
And this:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“It did not end up being the crazy productivity booster that I thought
it would be, because programming is designing and these tools aren’t
good enough (yet) to assist me with this seriously.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
There is work that will be improved with AI, but it’s not something that
most industries will have to stop everything and leap on top of. The
human use cases must come first with any technology: if you have a
problem that AI can solve, by all means, use AI. But if you don’t,
hopping on the hype train is just going to burn you a lot of money and
slow your actual core business down.

Today marks the summer solstice, the longest day of the year here in the
Northern Hemisphere and the official start of summer 2024. With global
temperatures still at record highs, what we’re experiencing now is
probably just a preview of what’s to come in the following months and
years. “These days I think it’s much more appropriate to call it ‘global
weirding’” than global warming, climate professor
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-06-18/from-texas-to-dubai-the-era-of-extremely-wild-weather-is-here?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9ddtUhySUPNHKQt7mhowG-VAeLA_S7HVC4CbVe3QsrpWZMk43suS88HOc9TPZK0cg6i9mS" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Katharine

getting much weirder.”

<h3>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Warm temperatures send U.S. power generation soaring
</h3>
<p>
The warm temperatures across the U.S. are driving up power generation
and putting a strain on the grid. Natural gas-fired power generation is
up 6% so far this year compared to 2023, and in fact is at its highest
since 2021, <em>Reuters</em>
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-power-system-cranks-up-gas-output-cooling-season-kicks-off-maguire-2024-06-20/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9ddtUhySUPNHKQt7mhowG-VAeLA_S7HVC4CbVe3QsrpWZMk43suS88HOc9TPZK0cg6i9mS" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.
While clean power output is also set to rise, natural gas is expected to
remain the top fuel source in the U.S. “In turn, U.S. power sector
emissions from gas use will likely also climb to new highs in 2024,
potentially accelerating the climate warming trends that are fuelling
increased higher gas demand in the first place,”
<em><em>Reuters</em></em> added. The heat wave sweeping east prompted
New England’s power grid operator to declare a level 1 emergency this
week, and briefly pushed electricity prices up near $2,000 per
megawatt-hour, “more than 10 times the day-ahead cost for the hour,”
<em><em>Bloomberg</em></em>

report from the Energy Institute</a>. Coal demand rose, oil consumption
“rebounded strongly” after a pandemic dip, and crude oil consumption
exceeded 100 million barrels per day for the first time ever. As a
result, greenhouse gas emissions increased 2.1% and broke the record set
the year before. Emissions from energy have increased by 50% since the
year 2000, the report found. At the same time, renewable power
generation reached a record high last year and accounted for about 15%
of the global energy mix, and fossil fuel consumption for energy dropped
ever so slightly (by 0.4%). The report sheds light on huge regional
contrasts: “In advanced economies, we observe signs of demand for fossil
fuels peaking, contrasting with economies in the Global South for whom
economic development and improvements in quality of life continue to
drive fossil growth,” Energy Institute Chief Executive Nick Wayth

Cannabis is now legal — for medical or recreational use — in 38 states,
plus D.C. But marijuana remains illegal at the federal level, meaning
there are stringent rules governing the transportation of cannabis. That
can leave some parts of the industry stranded, sometimes on literal
islands. Today, we travel to Martha’s Vineyard to hear how those hurdles
have impacted one dispensary. Plus, a look at fossil fuel use and the

id="south-africa-beats-us-in-super-eight-playoffs-at-the-t20-world-cup">South
Africa beats US in Super Eight playoffs at the T20 World Cup</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NORTH SOUND, Antigua — South Africa had to work hard to earn an
18-run win over the fast-improving United States in the opening game of
the Super Eight at the Twenty20 World Cup on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Co-host the West Indies also lost it first match in the Super Eight
stage Wednesday, beaten by eight wickets by defending champion England.
Jack Salt scored 87 runs to lead England.</p>
<p>Andries Gous made an unbeaten 80 off 47 balls for the U.S. — against
the country of his birth — to move atop the batting charts at the World
Cup before South Africa restricted the Americans at 176-6.</p>
<p>Fast bowler Kagiso Rabada claimed 3-18 and spinner Keshav Maharaj got
the prized wicket of U.S. captain Aaron Jones for a duck — no runs — to
finish with 1-24.</p>
<p>Quinton de Kock had earlier made a rampant 74 off 40 balls and
Heinrich Klaasen provided the perfect finish with 36 not out in the
South African total of 194-4 after Jones won the toss and elected to
field.</p>
<p>“Pretty happy with the performance as a whole,” South Africa captain
Aiden Markram said. “A couple of overs here and there we need to tidy up
… but the wicket definitely changes and gets a bit slower.”</p>
<p>De Kock and Markram (46 off 32 balls) dominated both spinners and the
pacers as they raised a solid 110-run stand after Saurabh Netravalkar
(2-21) had provided the early breakthrough by getting the wicket of
Reeza Hendricks in his second over.</p>
<p>“We’ve had some tricky wickets so it was nice to spend some time in
the middle today,” de Kock said. “The USA put us under pressure towards
the end. It was a great game.”</p>
<p>Netravalkar, who bowled a sensational Super Over in the United
States’ historic win over heavyweights Pakistan in the group stage,
struck immediately in his return spell when Markram was brilliantly
caught by diving Ali Khan at deep backward point off a full-pitched
ball.</p>
<p>But Klaasen used all his T20 experience in the last five overs and
struck three sixes while Tristan Stubbs also hit two fours in his
16-ball unbeaten 20 which lifted the South Africa total.</p>
<p>“Hard to take a defeat after coming so close,” Jones said. “We did
lack discipline in the bowling at times, (but) once we play good cricket
we can beat any team in the world. We need to be a lot more
disciplined.”</p>
<p>England beats the West Indies</p>
<p>At Gros Islet, St Lucia, Salt carried his bat for 87 and Jonny
Bairstow made an unbeaten 48 as defending champion England beat the West
Indies by eight wickets in a match between two-time World Cup
champions.</p>
<p>It was the West Indies’ first loss of the tournament and their first
defeat in eight Twenty20 internationals.</p>
<p>The West Indies made 180-4 batting first on the same pitch on which
they made 218-5 against Afghanistan in the final match of the group
stage on Monday.</p>
<p>The fireworks came at the end and from England as Salt made his 87
runs from 47 balls with seven fours and five sixes and Bairstow added
his 48 from 26 deliveries. England reached 181-2 with 15 balls to
spare.</p>
<p>Salt provided a solid foundation for the England run chase, initially
in a 67-run opening partnership with Jos Buttler.</p>
<p>Salt scored 30 runs — three sixes and three fours — from the 16th
over bowled by Romario Shepherd.</p>
<p>“I’m not looking too far ahead at the minute, just glad that I could
contribute to a good team win,” Salt said. “It was a little bit tougher
in the middle overs with the spin.”</p>
<p>The pitch may have been a little slower than on Monday but England
captain Buttler also used his bowlers well and the West Indies innings
included 50 dot balls.</p>
<p>A capacity crowd in the first night match of the Super Eight stage
was out to party but the match really didn’t come alive until the
end.</p>
<p>The West Indies started well but were disrupted in the six-over power
play by the loss of Brandon King who retired hurt after 4.3 overs with a
side or groin strain. King had just hit the first six of the match, a
103-meter (338-foot) blow that flew over the grandstand and out of the
stadium.</p>
<p>He made 23 from 13 balls and was setting the early pace of the
innings when he was forced to retire with the West Indies at 40-0. There
was no immediate word on the seriousness of King’s injury.</p>
<p>“Credit has to be given to the England bowling unit. You can see they
had clear plans and executed them well,” West Indies captain Rovman
Powell said.</p>

of Boeing MAX crash victims seek nearly $25 billion fine,
prosecution</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Families of Boeing 737 MAX crash victims on Wednesday
asked U.S. authorities to impose a fine of up to $24.8 billion on the
aviation giant and proceed with criminal prosecution.</p>
<p>The move comes a day after Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun acknowledged the
gravity of the company’s safety problems and assured a U.S.
congressional panel that it was making progress on the issue.</p>
<p>Sitting behind him in the audience were relatives of victims of the
Boeing 737 MAX 8 crashes in 2018 and 2019, who held up victims’
photos.</p>
<p>“Because Boeing’s crime is the deadliest corporate crime in U.S.
history, a maximum fine of more than $24 billion is legally justified
and clearly appropriate,” Paul Cassell, a lawyer for the families, wrote
in a letter to the U.S. Department of Justice.</p>
<p>The 32-page document explains the calculations behind the amount
sought, saying Boeing “should be fined the maximum — $24,780,000,000 —
with perhaps $14,000,000,000 to $22,000,0000,000 of the fine suspended
on the condition that Boeing devote those suspended funds to an
independent corporate monitor and related improvements in compliance and
safety programs as identified below.”</p>
<p>It added: “And Boeing’s Board of Directors should be ordered to meet
with the families.”</p>
<p>The families also believe the government should promptly “launch
criminal prosecutions of the responsible corporate officials at Boeing
at the time of the two crashes.”</p>
<p>The case relates to crashes in 2018 and 2019 in Indonesia and
Ethiopia that together claimed 346 lives and comes as Boeing faces
intensifying scrutiny following recent manufacturing and safety
problems.</p>
<p>The aviation giant has again been in the public spotlight since a
January 5 incident in which a 737 MAX operated by Alaska Airlines was
forced to make an emergency landing after a fuselage panel blew out
midflight.</p>

requires public school classrooms to display Ten Commandments</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BATON ROUGE, Louisiana — Louisiana has become the first U.S. state to
require that the Ten Commandments be displayed in every public school
classroom, the latest move from a Republican-dominated legislature
pushing a conservative agenda under a new governor. </p>
<p>The legislation that Republican Governor Jeff Landry signed into law
on Wednesday requires a poster-sized display of the Ten Commandments in
“large, easily readable font” in all public classrooms, from
kindergarten to state-funded universities. </p>
<p>Opponents questioned the law’s constitutionality and vowed to
challenge it in court. Proponents said the measure is not solely
religious, but that it has historical significance. In the language of
the law, the Ten Commandments are “foundational documents of our state
and national government.” </p>
<p>The posters, which will be paired with a four-paragraph “context
statement” describing how the Ten Commandments “were a prominent part of
American public education for almost three centuries,” must be in place
in classrooms by the start of 2025. </p>
<p>Under the law, state funds will not be used to implement the mandate.
The posters would be paid for through donations. </p>
<p>The law also “authorizes” but does not require the display of other
items in K-12 public schools, including: The Mayflower Compact, which
was signed by religious pilgrims aboard the Mayflower in 1620 and is
often referred to as America’s “First Constitution”; the Declaration of
Independence; and the Northwest Ordinance, which established a
government in the Northwest Territory — in the present day Midwest — and
created a pathway for admitting new states to the Union. </p>
<p>Opponents vow to challenge law</p>
<p>Not long after the governor signed the bill into law at Our Lady of
Fatima Catholic School in Lafayette on Wednesday, civil rights groups
and organizations that want to keep religion out of government promised
to file a lawsuit challenging it. </p>
<p>The law prevents students from getting an equal education and will
keep children who have different beliefs from feeling safe at school,
the American Civil Liberties Union, Americans United for Separation of
Church and State, and the Freedom from Religion Foundation said in a
joint statement Wednesday afternoon. </p>
<p>“Even among those who may believe in some version of the Ten
Commandments, the particular text that they adhere to can differ by
religious denomination or tradition. The government should not be taking
sides in this theological debate,” the groups said. </p>
<p>The controversial law, in a state ensconced in the Bible Belt, comes
during a new era of conservative leadership in Louisiana under Landry,
who replaced two-term Democratic Governor John Bel Edwards in January.
Republicans hold a supermajority in the legislature, and Republicans
hold every statewide elected position, paving the way for lawmakers to
push through a conservative agenda. </p>
<p>Similar bills requiring the Ten Commandments be displayed in
classrooms have been proposed in other states, including Texas, Oklahoma
and Utah. However, with threats of legal battles over the
constitutionality of such measures, no state besides Louisiana has
succeeded in making the bills law. </p>
<p>Similar law ruled unconstitutional</p>
<p>Legal battles over the display of the Ten Commandments in classrooms
are not new. </p>
<p>In 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a similar Kentucky law was
unconstitutional and violated the establishment clause of the U.S.
Constitution, which says Congress can “make no law respecting an
establishment of religion.”  </p>
<p>The high court found that the law had no secular purpose but rather
served a plainly religious purpose.</p>
