## I still don't think companies serve you ads based on spying through your microphone

date: 2025-01-02, updated: 2025-01-02, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p>One of my weirder hobbies is trying to convince people that the idea that companies are listening to you through your phone's microphone and serving you targeted ads is a conspiracy theory that isn't true. I wrote about this previously: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Dec/14/ai-trust-crisis/#facebook-dont-spy-microphone">Facebook don’t spy on you through your microphone</a>.</p>
<p>(Convincing people of this is basically impossible. It doesn't matter how good your argument is, if someone has ever seen an ad that relates to their previous voice conversation they are likely convinced and there's nothing you can do to talk them out of it. Gimlet media did <a href="https://gimletmedia.com/amp/shows/reply-all/z3hlwr">a great podcast episode</a> about how impossible this is back in 2017.)</p>
<p>This is about to get even harder thanks to this proposed settlement: <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/apple-agrees-to-pay-95m-delete-private-conversations-siri-recorded/">Siri “unintentionally” recorded private convos; Apple agrees to pay $95M</a> (Ars Technica).</p>
<p>Apple are spending $95m (nine hours of profit), agreeing to settle while "denying wrongdoing".</p>
<p>What actually happened is it turns out Apple were capturing snippets of audio surrounding the "Hey Siri" wake word, sending those back to their servers and occasionally using them for QA, without informing users that they were doing this. This is bad.</p>
<p>The Reuters 2021 story <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-must-face-siri-voice-assistant-privacy-lawsuit-us-judge-2021-09-02/">Apple must face Siri voice assistant privacy lawsuit -U.S. judge</a> reported that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One Siri user said his private discussions with his doctor about a "brand name surgical treatment" caused him to receive targeted ads for that treatment, while two others said their discussions about Air Jordan sneakers, Pit Viper sunglasses and "Olive Garden" caused them to receive ads for those products.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The claim from that story was then repeated in <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/apple-pay-95-million-settle-siri-privacy-lawsuit-2025-01-02/">the 2025 Reuters story</a> about the settlement.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/apple-agrees-to-pay-95m-delete-private-conversations-siri-recorded/">Ars Technica story</a> reframes that like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The only clue that users seemingly had of Siri's alleged spying was eerily accurate targeted ads that appeared after they had just been talking about specific items like Air Jordans or brands like Olive Garden, Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/apple-pay-95-million-settle-siri-privacy-lawsuit-2025-01-02/">noted</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Crucially, this was never <em>proven in court</em>. And if Apple settle the case it never will be.</p>
<p>Let’s think this through. For the accusation to be true, Apple would need to be recording those wake word audio snippets and transmitting them back to their servers for additional processing (likely true), but then they would need to be feeding those snippets <em>in almost real time</em> into a system which forwards them onto advertising partners who then feed that information into targeting networks such that next time you view an ad on your phone the information is available to help select the relevant ad.</p>
<p>That is <em>so far fetched</em>. Why would Apple do that? Especially given both their brand and reputation as a privacy-first company combined with the large amounts of product design and engineering work they’ve put into preventing apps from doing exactly this kind of thing by enforcing permission-based capabilities <em>and</em> ensuring a “microphone active” icon is available at all times when an app is listening in.</p>
<p>I really don't think this is happening - in particular for Siri wake words!</p>

<p id="argued-these-points">I've <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Dec/14/ai-trust-crisis/#facebook-dont-spy-microphone">argued these points before</a>, but I'll do it again here for good measure.</p>
<ol>
<li>You don't notice the hundreds of times a day you say something and <em>don't</em> see a relevant advert a short time later. You see thousands of ads a day, can you remember what <em>any</em> of them are?</li>
<li>The tiny fraction of times where you see an ad that's relevant to something you've just said (hence breaking through your filter that prevents you from seeing most ads at all) stick in your head.</li>
<li>Human beings are pattern matching machines with a huge bias towards personal anecdotes. If we've seen direct evidence of something ourselves, good luck talking us out of it!</li>
</ol>
<p>I think the truth of the matter here is much more pedestrian: the quality of ad targeting that's possible just through apps sharing data on your regular actions within those apps is shockingly high... combined with the fact that it turns out just knowing "male, 40s, NYC" is often more than enough - we're all pretty basic!</p>
<p>I fully expect that this Apple story will be used as "proof" by conspiracy theorists effectively forever.</p>

## Oxide and Friends Predictions 2025 - on Monday Jan 6th at 5pm Pacific

I'll be participating in the annual Oxide and Friends predictions podcast / live recording next Monday (6th January) at 5pm Pacific, in their Discord.</p>
<p>The event description reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Join us in making 1-, 3- and 6-year tech predictions -- and to revisit our 1-year predictions from 2024 and our 3-year predictions from 2022!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I find the idea of predicting six months ahead in terms of LLMs hard to imagine, so six years will be absolute science fiction!</p>
<p>I had a lot of fun talking about open source LLMs on this podcast <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jan/17/oxide-and-friends/">a year ago</a>.

## Ending a year long posting streak

date: 2025-01-02, updated: 2025-01-02, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p>A year ago today I wrote about <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jan/2/escalating-streaks/">Tom Scott's legendary 10 year YouTube streak</a>, in which he posted a new video once a week for the next ten years. Inspired by that, I also started my own.</p>
<p>I set myself the goal of posting something to my blog every day for a year.</p>
<p>Given how much happened in my chosen field of <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/31/llms-in-2024/">Large Language Models over the course of 2024</a> this wasn't as hard as I had expected!</p>
<p>One of the lessons I learned from Tom is that it's much healthier for a streak to have a predetermined end - that way the streak can act as a goal that doesn't turn into an ongoing imposition.</p>
<p>I'm calling it: this streak is done. According to <a href="https://simonwillison.net/dashboard/streaks-with-post-count/">my custom dashboard</a> I hit 367 days - December 31st 2023 to December 31st 2024, inclusive (it was a leap year) - 1,151 posts in total.</p>

<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/jan-streak.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="Table of data. Row 1 has duration in days=1, start date=2025-01-02, end date=2025-01-02, num posts=1. Row 2 has duration in days=367, start date=2023-12-31, end date=2024-12-31, num posts=1151. Row 3 has duration in days=1, start date=2023-12-23, end date=2023-12-23, num posts=1. Row 4 has duration in days=4, start date=2023-12-18, end date=2023-12-21, num posts=6." /></p>

<p>I'm going to drop back to a much more reasonable target of at least one long-form post per week and at least three days per week with a link or quote - see <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/22/link-blog/">My approach to running a link blog</a> for how I think about that kind of content.</p>
<p>Posting daily has been fun, but it definitely impacted my productivity on my other projects. My blog runs on UTC so it also resulted in a minor panic coming up to 4pm Pacific coast time if I hadn't posted anything yet!</p>

<p>Almost every post in the streak came out in 2024, so my <a href="https://simonwillison.net/search/?year=2024">faceted search engine for 2024</a> provides a way to explore them.</p>

<p>My <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/">2024 archive page</a> also serves up this illustrative tag cloud:</p>

<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/2024-tag-cloud.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="A tag cloud with llms and ai as the central largest terms, surrounded by technology-related words: nomic, datasette, security, rag, projects, llama, openai, gemini, edge-llms, psf, sql, open-source, json, javascript, ethics, python, google, plugins, gis, django, apple, sqlite, aws, tools, rust, golang, c, uv, s3, css, git, ocr" /></p>

## Normware: The Decline of Software Engineering

date: 2025-01-02, updated: 2025-01-02, from: Tom Kellog blog

There’s a common refrain that “AI won’t replace software engineers”, often with the resolution,
“you’ll be replaced by software engineers that use AI”, implying that AI will be used to make
software engineers more productive and efficient. I argue that software engineers will be
replaced by normies, non-engineers (accountants, lawyers, etc.) that are empowered to
create their own software to solve their own problems.

## Hard data integration problems at Carbonfact

date: 2025-01-02, from: Max Halford Blog

<p>Carbonfact&rsquo;s customers are clothing brands and factories. Our mission is to measure (and ultimately reduce) the carbon footprint of their products. We need primary data to do this: purchase orders, bills of materials, energy consumption data, etc.</p>
<p>Each customer has a unique IT setup, which makes it challenging to scale to hundreds/thousands of customers. Our success as a business depends on our ability to not reinvent the wheel for each customer.</p>
