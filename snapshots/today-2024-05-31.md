As Debbie Chinn wrote in her memoir, “Dancing in their Light,” her parents' ability to remake their lives in the US, a country that didn't always welcome them, provided a template for surviving change, which Chinn has employed to help arts groups navigate challenges in the 21st century.

## NASA Mission Flies Over Arctic to Study Sea Ice Melt Causes

date: 2024-05-31, from: NASA breaking news

It’s not just rising air and water temperatures influencing the decades-long decline of Arctic sea ice. Clouds, aerosols, even the bumps and dips on the ice itself can play a role. To explore how these factors interact and impact sea ice melting, NASA is flying two aircraft equipped with scientific instruments over the Arctic Ocean [&#8230;]

## Unexpected Anti-Patterns for Engineering Leaders

date: 2024-05-31, from: Ben Werdmuller's blog

    <div class="known-bookmark">
                <div class="e-content">

<p>"The key to effective engineering leadership lies in figuring out which scenarios are worth deliberately defying conventional logic, and when to simply follow the rules."</p>

<p>Lots of good food for thought here. I've definitely been guilty of some of the anti-patterns here - particularly trying to be an umbrella for my team, which can leave people out of the loop and let them feel like they're lacking needed transparency.</p>

<p>The key is being able to jump in and get into the weeds when it's helpful, get out when it's not, and give everybody the context, culture, information, and resources they need in order to do their best work in service of the mission, vision, and strategy.</p>

<p>Speaking of, I love this:</p>

<p>"There’s this pervasive belief that there’s no strategy anywhere, but that’s not true. There is strategy everywhere, it’s just rarely written."</p>

<p>That's been true of every organization I've joined, and - if I'm honest with myself - every organization I've started.</p>

<p>"Complicating things even further, Larson also has found that many companies do have a habit of writing things down, they just aren’t the right things. “It’s the small decisions that end up getting documented,” Larson says. “You’d think it would be the opposite, but in my experience, the answers to important questions like, ‘Why did we go into this business? Why are we shutting down this business line? Why are we doing this services migration that's going to take five years?’ literally aren't written down anywhere.”"</p>

<p>Encouraging people to write reflections, to capture the "why" of decisions that were made, and, essentially, to journal the journey of the team and the company is rarely done, but I think forms part of a solution to many problems.  <a href="https://werd.io/tag/Technology" class="p-category" rel="tag">#Technology</a></p>

## Biden allows Ukraine to hit Russia with American weapons near Kharkiv

date: 2024-05-31, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — In a shift from his previous position, U.S. President Joe Biden has allowed Ukraine to use American-provided weapons to counter Russian attacks in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, located just 30 kilometers (18 miles) from the border with Russia.


Speaking from Prague on Friday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken confirmed the change in policy. “Over the past few weeks, Ukraine came to us and asked the authorization to use weapons that we're providing to defend against this aggression, including against Russian forces that are massing on the Russian side of the border and then attacking into Ukraine,” he said.


Blinken left open the possibility of the policy being applied to other regions of the conflict. “Going forward, we'll continue to do what we've been doing, which is, as necessary, adapt and adjust, he said.




U.S. policy prohibiting the use of long-range missiles known as ATACMS, or Army Tactical Missile System, that could hit targets deep inside Russia has not changed.


"This applies to counter-fire capabilities that are deployed just across the border. It does not apply to ATACMS or long-range strikes," said Michael Carpenter, senior director for Europe at the White House National Security Council.


"This is meant to enable Ukrainians to defend themselves against what would otherwise be a Russian sanctuary across the border," Carpenter said in a Friday interview with VOA.


Fearing escalation, Biden had been reluctant to authorize the use of weapons to hit targets inside Russia despite pressure from Ukraine and European allies. However, Moscow’s advances on Kharkiv in recent weeks may have persuaded him.




The White House’s decision “does the minimum to help Ukraine with a difficult situation in the northeast,” removing “a major burden on Ukraine’s efforts to defend civilians in Kharkiv and to stop the Russian offensive,” said John Herbst, senior director of the Atlantic Council’s Eurasia Center and former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. At the same time, it “makes public a range of restrictions that seem designed to temper Moscow’s reaction.”


“This half step is certainly better than none,” Herbst said, but it “does not send the necessary message of American resolve to the Kremlin.”


Russian assets


Biden is hosting Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo at the White House on Friday, following formal adoption of a plan by the European Union earlier this month to use profits from Russian central bank assets frozen in the EU for Ukraine's defense.


To punish Moscow over its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, G7 economies, including the United States and the EU, have immobilized vast sums of Russian central bank assets. U.S. and European officials have been debating on how to unlock these funds to help Kyiv.


Biden signed legislation in April allowing Washington to seize the roughly $5 billion in Russian assets located in the United States. However, most of the approximately $280 billion Russian assets are in Europe, including $225 billion held by EU countries, the majority of which are frozen in Belgium.


Last week G7 finance ministers said they will back the EU’s plan. Biden and other G7 leaders are set to formally give their support during their summit in Bari, Italy, this June.


Under the plan agreed to by the EU, interest and other investment returns accruing on these assets could total more than $3 billion each year and will be used by Western allies to pay themselves back for funds they provide to Ukraine in the near term.


Details of the plan are still unclear, said Ian Lesser, distinguished fellow and adviser to the president at the German Marshall Fund of the United States.


“What is clear is that it's going to be collected and used in the European level,” he told VOA. The funds could be used for economic support for Ukraine but also to back the purchase arms for Ukraine and support the European defense industries, he said.


Russian officials have suggested they could retaliate by confiscating U.S. and European assets in Russia. While some countries may be concerned by the threat, others are worried about the precedent of using frozen assets under international law.


“If this goes ahead, others who may be exposed to historic grievances of all kinds may find that they are having their assets ceased as reparations,” Lesser said.


The plan is projected to yield as much as $50 billion for Ukraine in the near future. However, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the ultimate goal is to seize Russian assets, not just the interest. "With all our gratitude for this decision today, the amounts are not commensurate [with the amount of frozen assets]," he told reporters.


De Croo’s visit to Washington came days after his meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Belgium. The leaders signed a security agreement which includes the delivery of 30 U.S.-made F-16 fighter jets, another move to bolster Kyiv's defense capabilities against Moscow.




"These F-16 jets will be provided to Ukraine as soon as possible. Our aim is to be able to provide first aircraft before the end of this year, 2024," De Croo said at a press conference with Zelenskyy earlier this week.


However, he underscored those jets cannot be flown in Russian territory.


De Croo is also expected to urge Biden to exert more pressure on Israel to change its war conduct and allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza.


After Spain, Ireland and Norway said they would recognize a Palestinian state earlier this week, several parties pushed the Belgian Federal Government to do the same but failed to reach an agreement.

## Servo sees another month full of improvements

date: 2024-05-31, from: OS News

Servo, the Rust-based browser engine originally started by Mozilla but since spun off into an entity under the umbrella of the Linux Foundation, has published another monthly update. As almost every month, there&#8217;s been a lot of progress on rendering tech I don&#8217;t quite understand, and further improved support for various standards. Another major focus is the ongoing font system rework, which is yielding not only vastly improved support for font rendering options, but is also reducing the memory load. The example browser included in Servo is also making progress, from reducing the amount of errors on Windows, to implementing support for using extra mouse buttons to go back and forward, and showing the link desination when hovering the mouse over a link.

## Can Electric Cars Escape Identity Politics?

The mini-rant about EVs that follows is now as much a feature of Trump speeches as complaints about immigration or the injustice of his criminal indictments. As he said recently in <a href="https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speaks-at-rally-in-ohio" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Dayton, Ohio</u></a>, “They want to do this all-electric nonsense where the cars don’t go far, they cost too much, and they’re all made in China.” </p><p>When Trump chooses to elevate an issue, he inevitably infuses it with questions of identity, the divisions between <em><em>us</em></em> and <em><em>them</em></em>. He doesn’t just tell you what to believe, he tells you that this is what our kind of people believe, and believing the opposite would make you one of our enemies, contemptible and repugnant. </p><p>Of course, EVs were already a means of expressing identity long before Trump started talking about them. None of us, no matter what our political orientation or feelings about capitalism, are immune from the impulse to make a statement to the world about our selfhood and the groups we belong to through our consumer choices, whether it’s the clothes we wear or the phone we carry or the car we drive. </p><p>But if we’re ever going to reach the point where the overwhelming majority of vehicles on the road are electric — an indispensable part of reducing carbon emissions — we’ll have to divorce the fuel source that drives a car from those identity questions.</p><p>Trump will certainly do what he can to prevent that from happening, even if his position on EVs is less than coherent. “The electric cars, automatically, are going to be made in China,” <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-criticizes-uaw-leadership-strike-warns-auto-workers-jobs-are-mov-rcna105301" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>he says</u></a>, yet he offers this as a reason to <em><em>oppose </em></em>policies that would encourage domestic production of EVs. Part of his interest is surely just about adding EVs to the list of things he can criticize President Biden for. Early in his presidency, Biden <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/biden-sign-order-aiming-half-new-vehicles-be-electric-2030-n1275995" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>set out a goal</u></a> that by 2030, half of new cars sold in the U.S. would be zero-emission, and though new tailpipe <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/20/climate/biden-phase-out-gas-cars.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>regulations</u></a> from the Environmental Protection Agency push that goal back by two years, the rules give it teeth in the form of fines if car companies don’t meet the target.</p><p>It helps Trump that the target is optimistic, to say the least; <a href="https://www.kbb.com/car-news/americans-bought-nearly-1-2-million-evs-last-year/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>only 7.6 percent</u></a> of new car sales in 2023 were EVs. And Republicans <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/buttigieg-defends-bidens-ev-strategy-after-question-how-only-8-federal-charging-stations-have-been-built" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>delight</u></a> in mocking the slow progress on building a nationwide network of charging stations, presenting it as a case study in both government inefficiency and the folly of taking action on climate change. The clear message to conservative voters is that buying an EV would violate their sense of self in a profound way, putting them on the side of Joe Biden and all those woke enviro-hippies. </p><p>From their earliest modern iterations, EVs and hybrids were indeed a statement of identity for liberals: Driving one said that you cared about pollution and climate change, and were willing to sacrifice a certain amount of convenience to lower your personal negative impact on the environment. In the right circles, a Prius could be a kind of <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/02/the-prius-as-an-oddly-shaped-status-symbol/385263/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>status symbol</u></a> despite its relatively modest price. The reaction from the right was contempt at anyone driving one, for the same reasons. </p><p>Though Tesla began to alter that image by marketing their EVs as stylish and technologically advanced, the political division on EVs has remained. According to <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/643334/ownership-ticks-fewer-nonowners-buy-one.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a recent Gallup poll</u></a>, 72 percent of liberals say they either have an EV or might buy one in the future, while an identical 72 percent of conservatives say they won’t ever buy one.</p><p>If you were a car company looking only to boost sales, that might not be too much of a problem, since in a market where around 15 million cars <a href="https://www.coxautoinc.com/news/cox-automotive-forecast-december-2023-u-s-auto-sales-forecast/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>are sold</u></a> every year, there’s plenty of room for identity segmentation. Auto companies can promote particular models to young people or suburban moms or even <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/06/29/1108739853/when-subaru-came-out-classic" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>lesbians</u></a>, and still make healthy profits. Everyone can find the car to express their identity; for instance, every year, the three <a href="https://www.kbb.com/car-news/the-25-best-selling-cars-of-2023/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>best-selling</u></a> vehicles in America are pickup trucks (the Ford F-series, the Ram, and the Chevy Silverado), and it isn’t because so many people need them for hauling and towing. It’s because the pickup is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/11/01/pickup-trucks-men-masculinity-rural-symbols/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>associated</u></a> with a brand of rugged masculinity that millions of men want to present to the world, whether it’s really who they are or not. </p><p>But the goal isn’t getting some or even a lot of people to buy EVs, it’s to get nearly <em><em>every </em></em>car buyer to choose one. The paradox is that driving an EV may only cease to be a matter of identity when it becomes the default, and that can only happen when people of every partisan and political orientation start buying them.</p><p>We can see the glimmers of that transition in accelerating demand for hybrids. Hybrid sales <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-latest-numbers-say-americans-are-going-all-in-for-hybrids-4dca8d4c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>grew an extraordinary 53 percent</u></a> from 2022 to 2023, as more models — including low-priced ones — became available. You can even get a Ford Maverick Hybrid pickup, which is proving <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/ford-maverick-hybrid-q1-sales" target="_self"><u>extremely popular</u></a>, for under $25,000 (a MotorTrend <a href="https://www.motortrend.com/reviews/2023-ford-maverick-hybrid-yearlong-review-test-arrival/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>article</u></a> from last year was titled “We Bought a 2023 Ford Maverick Hybrid and It’s a Real F***ing Truck, Damn It!”). That greater variety of choices, combined with the increasing availability of EVs, may be depoliticizing hybrids, at least to a degree. As Heatmap’s Robinson Meyer said on <a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/transcript-shift-key-episode-three-ira" target="_self"><u>a recent episode</u></a> of Shift Key, “the presence of battery electric vehicles really defangs conventional hybrids because it is no longer the ‘lib car.’”</p><p>There are two critical impediments to a similar change happening for EVs: price and battery range. At the moment, going fully electric still means paying more up front compared to buying a comparable internal combustion vehicle, even if subsidies significantly lower that premium. But if getting an EV involved no extra initial cost, and charging stations were as common as gas stations, buying an EV wouldn’t say “I am willing to sacrifice to address climate change.” And it may be that the less your EV says about you — or at least, the less the fact that it’s an EV says about you — the better.</p><p>An increase in the number of EV models (which is already happening) will help too: If there are small and large EV pickups, EV sedans, EV sports cars, and critically, cheap EVs — which <a href="https://insideevs.com/features/721285/china-ev-policy-niedermeyer/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>at the moment</u></a> are only being manufactured in China — then there will be enough room to make a variety of identity statements with an EV that have nothing to do with its fuel source.</p><p>If he wins in November, Trump will probably try to reverse Biden’s tailpipe emission standards and roll back some of the EV subsidies that are now in place. But he may encounter more resistance than he thinks. Despite a recent slowdown in the growth rate of EV sales, the auto companies are still committed to transitioning to zero-emission fleets (even if they’d like to take their time getting there). And some red parts of the country are now deeply invested in EVs, especially in the “Battery Belt” in the Southeast, where EV technology companies are hiring thousands of workers and auto companies are <a href="https://apnews.com/article/hyundai-georgia-electric-vehicles-incentives-tax-breaks-b071c820f55a7946912af11acf2eea63" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>opening</u></a> EV plants. </p><p>One signal that mass adoption of EVs is imminent will be when car companies barely mention the fact that they’re electric in marketing them. When all the ads feature masculine men doing manly things with their manly electric trucks, hip and beautiful young people heading to the beach in their fun electric convertibles, and safety-conscious moms carpooling to soccer practice in their comfy electric SUVs, none of whom seem concerned about the climate, then we’ll know we’re on our way.</p>

## 25 years of Krita

date: 2024-05-31, from: OS News

Twenty-five years. A quarter century. That&#8217;s how long we&#8217;ve been working on Krita. Well, what would become Krita. It started out as KImageShop, but that name was nuked by a now long-dead German lawyer. Then it was renamed to Krayon, and that name was also nuked. Then it was renamed to Krita, and that name stuck. I only became part of Krita in 2003, when Krita was still part of KDE&#8217;s suite of productivity applications, KOffice, later renamed to Calligra&#8230; And I became maintainer of Krita in 2004, when Patrick Julien handed over the baton. That means that I&#8217;ve been around Krita for about twenty of those twenty-five years, so I&#8217;ll hope you, dear reader, will forgive me for making this a really personal post; a very large part of my life has been tied up with Krita, and it&#8217;s going to show. ↫ Krita website While it may not be as popular as something like LibreOffice due to fewer people needing it, Krita is a cornerstone application of the Linux desktop (it&#8217;s also available for Windows and macOS), and I honestly can barely believe it&#8217;s been around for this long. I&#8217;m about as far removed from being an artistic painter as a squirrel&#8217;s tail is from being a functioning propeller engine so I don&#8217;t have need for Krita, but I&#8217;m always surprised by how many people mention using it for their painting endeavours. I wish the project and its developers another successful 25 years, and they&#8217;re going to need it &#8211; Krita 5.3 is coming soon(ish), and the much more involved Krita 6.0, which makes the jump fro Qt 5 to Qt 6, is also in the works. On a personal note, I&#8217;m online acquainted with the lead maintainer of Krita, and as she alludes to at the end of the article, COVID hit her hard, and maintaining such a huge open source project isn&#8217;t easy to begin with. Much respect for keeping it up, and of course, to everyone else contributing to the project.

## Vermont’s ‘Climate Superfund’ Bill Just Became Law

date: 2024-05-31, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDM0MDAwMC9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2ODQzODE2Nn0.7qLtGHwtvJDuHPOt-W4Ue-pqu3d_1ggV3S7sxzg1utg/image.png?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C1%2C0%2C1"/><br/><br/><p>
<em><strong>Current conditions: </strong>Severe thunderstorms are slamming Houston • Earth could experience another solar storm this weekend • It’s about 78 degrees Fahrenheit and partly cloudy in New York City, where former President Donald Trump has been found guilty on 34 felony counts.</em>
</p><h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2><h3>1. Vermont’s ‘Climate Superfund’ bill becomes law</h3><p>
	Vermont has become the first state to pass a law holding big fossil fuel companies financially responsible for climate change damages caused by the emissions from their products. The state’s Republican governor, Phil Scott, neither signed nor vetoed bill S.259, aka the “Climate Superfund Act,” therefore allowing it to become law. In a rather <a href="https://governor.vermont.gov/sites/scott/files/documents/S.259%20without%20signature%20letter.pdf?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_D-IPCw_Ec-9Ur9FXQXLyL6DdXQdZg_T6RJVYtbj4fiQgwbcA1Srx8jVap3KKObxsWULse" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">terse note</a> to Senate Secretary John Bloomer about the move, Scott warned of a lack of state funds to take on Big Oil, but said he understands “the desire to seek funding to mitigate the effects of climate change that has hurt our state.”
</p><p>
	As <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/climate-superfund-vermont?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_D-IPCw_Ec-9Ur9FXQXLyL6DdXQdZg_T6RJVYtbj4fiQgwbcA1Srx8jVap3KKObxsWULse" target="_self">Heatmap’s Emily Pontecorvo previously reported</a>, the bill will kick off a multiyear process that, in the most optimistic case, could bring money into the state by 2028. The first step is for the state Treasurer to assess the cost to Vermont, specifically, of emissions from the extraction and combustion of fossil fuels from 1995 to 2024, globally. Regulators will then request compensation from responsible parties in proportion to the emissions each company contributed. The state will identify responsible parties by focusing only on the biggest emitters, companies whose products generated at least a billion tons of emissions during that time. The money will go toward implementing a state “resilience and implementation strategy” to be mapped out in the next two years.
</p><h3>2. Data suggests few ethanol producers will qualify for SAF subsidies</h3><p>
<span></span>New <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/little-no-ethanol-will-qualify-us-aviation-fuel-credit-2024-05-30/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_D-IPCw_Ec-9Ur9FXQXLyL6DdXQdZg_T6RJVYtbj4fiQgwbcA1Srx8jVap3KKObxsWULse" target="_blank">analysis</a> from <em>Reuters</em> suggests almost no U.S. ethanol will be eligible for President Biden’s sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) subsidies, because very few corn farmers currently use all three of the “climate smart agriculture” practices outlined by the Treasury Department and IRS. The administration’s <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-24-37.pdf?_hsmi=305150367&utm_content=305150367&utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_D-IPCw_Ec-9Ur9FXQXLyL6DdXQdZg_T6RJVYtbj4fiQgwbcA1Srx8jVap3KKObxsWULse" target="_blank">guidance</a>, finalized at the end of April, said that SAF refiners would be eligible for a credit of $1.25 per gallon if their fuel reduces greenhouse gas emissions by 50% compared to traditional jet fuel, and up to $1.75 per gallon if emissions cuts go beyond 50%. But corn producers will only be eligible if they use cover cropping, avoid tilling, and use efficient fertilizer application to keep carbon in the soil. “I have not had a single ethanol producer member contact me and say, we’re going to meet the climate-smart agriculture requirements,” Brian Jennings, CEO of the lobby group American Coalition for Ethanol, told <em><em>Reuters</em></em>. A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) said the rule will encourage farmers to adopt these practices. Biden once <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/biden-administration-split-over-ethanols-role-aviation-fuel-subsidy-program-2023-08-02/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_D-IPCw_Ec-9Ur9FXQXLyL6DdXQdZg_T6RJVYtbj4fiQgwbcA1Srx8jVap3KKObxsWULse" target="_blank">said</a> that farmers would provide 95% of SAF.

The 600-horsepower vehicle has over 300 miles of range, can go from 0 to 60 mph in 3.4 seconds, and can charge from 20% to 80% in 23 minutes using a DC fast charger. The vehicle will “test the appetite of Jeep customers for a fully electric model,” <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/30/business/jeep-reveals-its-first-american-ev/index.html?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_D-IPCw_Ec-9Ur9FXQXLyL6DdXQdZg_T6RJVYtbj4fiQgwbcA1Srx8jVap3KKObxsWULse" target="_blank">wrote</a> Peter Valdes-Dapena at CNN.

Local media outlets said 10 people died of heat stroke in the eastern state of Odisha and 19 were killed in Bihar. One weather station in the capital New Delhi recorded 127.22 degrees Fahrenheit on Wednesday. That reading may have been faulty, officials said, but the mercury will hover around 110 degrees for at least another week and electricity demand is soaring as people crank up their air conditioners. Making matters worse, the city is experiencing a water shortage, with reports of desperate residents chasing after water tankers. A heat wave has gripped much of South Asia since April, and <a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/climate-change-made-the-deadly-heatwaves-that-hit-millions-of-highly-vulnerable-people-across-asia-more-frequent-and-extreme?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_D-IPCw_Ec-9Ur9FXQXLyL6DdXQdZg_T6RJVYtbj4fiQgwbcA1Srx8jVap3KKObxsWULse" target="_blank">researchers say</a> human-caused climate change is making the heat wave about 30 times more likely.

The analysis indicates that, between 1951 and 2020, the frequency of winter tornadoes has increased by a staggering 102%. This shift could potentially increase the destruction and disruption of tornadoes that catch people off guard over the holidays or simply unawares. The authors offered a bit of real estate advice: avoid Jackson, Mississippi, which saw one of the greatest increases in tornadoes of any city in the United States, and exhale if you’ve recently purchased property in Cleburne, Texas, which saw one of the greatest decreases.

<p>I'm Matthew Graybosch of Long Island in New York. I'm a GenX college dropout with delusions of erudition, a long-haired metalhead, and an incorrigible nerd. I'm a man of modest means and plebeian tastes, and if this post seems disjointed, it is because I am large and contain multitudes.</p>
<p>I had majored in computer science but I regret not saying be damned to the naysayers and going for a liberal arts degree. Then again, I probably should have just become an electrician; it's a union job in a skilled trade and not particularly amenable to outsourcing or automation.</p>
<p>Instead, I build software for a living — a job that pays well but often feels like building cathedrals atop quicksand — and make a hobby of writing science fantasy inspired by heavy metal and prog rock. Nothing I've written would be mistaken by a discerning reader for a towering work of literature, but I had a hell of a lot of fun writing it, and I've given readings from my work at the World Fantasy Convention. I'm also a terrible musician; I can stay on beat and in tune, and play three instruments poorly: viola, piano, and bass guitar. I have an uncle who does philosophy for a living; I merely dabble in it, since I'm one of those techies who gets curious about areas outside his expertise and sometimes develops opinions about them, too. Worse, I sometimes express them on my website, though you may find I am somewhat more progressive in many of my opinions than the typical Hacker News commenter.</p>
<p>I currently live and work in central Pennsylvania. I'm technically a homeowner, but all that means right now is that my landlord is a bank, my rent isn't subject to annual increases, and I'm much less likely to hear my neighbors having sex or domestic disputes. It still beats being a renter.</p>
<p>I have a relatively anodyne and corporate-friendly "professional" website at <a href="https://matthewgraybosch.com/">matthewgraybosch.com</a>, but my personal website is at <a href="https://starbreaker.org/">starbreaker.org</a> and that's where I let my hair down and speak my mind straight from the heart (with <a href="https://starbreaker.org/blog/rants/disdain-profanity-luxury-belief/index.html">liberal use of profanity</a>).</p>
<p>I tend to use the alias "starbreaker" online. I grabbed it out of an old Judas Priest song from their <em>Sin After Sin</em> album, but apparently it's also the name of a DC super-villain from the 1970s that nobody gives a damn about anymore. It's also a super-weapon in the Xeelee sequence of sf novels by Stephen Baxter. But I just didn't want to use "Stormbringer"; there were too many of those online in 1996.</p>
<p>However, when I play <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> I'm <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/character/40706699/">Naomi Bradleigh</a>. You can blame my wife Catherine for that; she loves to play around with character creation in RPGs, she tends to make characters based on characters from <a href="https://starbreaker.org/fiction/">my fiction</a>, and Naomi is one of her favorites: a swashbuckling soprano catgirl whose demon sword (which was forged of a stable transuranic heavy metal not yet seated at the periodic table) has figured out how to talk to her over 802.11 wireless networking and thinks that <em>The Dreaming City</em> by Michael Moorcock and <em>Gate of Ivrel</em> by C. J. Cherryh are fun bedtime stories.</p>
<p>Besides, I <a href="https://starbreaker.org/blog/entertainment/playing-woman-ffxiv/index.html">already pretend to be a man in real life</a>. Why also do it in <a href="https://starbreaker.org/blog/rants/choose-life-problem-video-games/index.html">a massively multiplayer online power fantasy</a>?</p>
<p>I suppose I should mention my day job. For my sins, I work a full-stack developer working at one of the US' Big Four consulting firms. They've got me typecast as a .NET developer, but my technical repertoire is rather broader than they care to realize. When I dropped out of college, it was with both a working knowledge of UNIX and the sting of my ex-girlfriend's last kiss still lingering on my lips.</p>
<p>Not many geeks can make that boast; they might manage the former but not necessary the latter. I run Slackware and OpenBSD on secondhand computers at home, and build my website with basic UNIX tools. More on that later, since you're curious about my tech stack. I've been on the periphery of various FOSS projects for years; I used to be active on the FreeBSD mailing list between 2002 and 2004 and used to answer a lot of questions about setting up dial-up connections using <code>wvdial</code>. I had also dabbled a bit with Gemini Protocol in 2020 and 2021, to the point of running my own server at tanelorn.city. I'm also part of the reason that <a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~adnano/gemini/%3C20200613053926.GH11281%40brevard.conman.org%3E#%3C20200613022323.46fd03f0ec8bd59ca6a5709b@matthewgraybosch.com%3E">Gemini's companion upload protocol is called "Titan"</a>.</p>
<p>I not only use GNU Emacs for programming at home, but for my writing. Speaking of which, I'm the author of the novels <em>Without Bloodshed</em> and <em>Silent Clarion</em>, as well as stories like "The Milgram Battery" and "Limited Liability". They're all part of the same post-apocalyptic metal hurlant science fantasy saga: <em>Starbreaker</em>. It's basically a pastiche on Michael Moorcock and a bunch of other sf and fantasy authors who aren't slavish imitators of J. R. R. Tolkien, though I do have a dark lord who wears white and already rules the world; he's a Silicon Valley Saruman and as cunning a linguist as his namesake. (Remember: what happens in Lothlorien stays in Lothlorien.) If you read my fiction, expect a strong undercurrent of the same sort of Romantic Satanism one finds in Byron, Shelley, and Goethe.</p>
<p>I'm also autistic, but wasn't diagnosed until I was in my early 40s. Being like that has made my life harder than it might ordinarily be; I can be sociable, friendly, or even charming with effort — but even doing the minimum to seem normal in an office setting can leave me drained at the end of a workday. Despite this, I managed to meet a woman online in 2000 and court her for four years before marrying her in 2004; it'll have been 20 years for Catherine and me this Halloween.</p>
<p>I haven't always had the means to make a huge fuss over her for our anniversaries, but we did spend her 40th birthday in Paris, where I did the talking for both of us because I had just enough French to order at shops and restaurants and make basic polite conversation without immediately revealing myself as an Ugly American. It was more than she had, though. <em>Mais non, je ne parle et lire pas Francais bien.</em> But my French is better than my German, which is barely good enough to make sense of Rammstein lyrics.</p>
<p>I've got a couple of cats curled up beside me while I'm writing this, and the neighborhood strays know me for a soft touch. I'm a typical middle-aged American man in that I don't have any friends beside my wife, and I had to get by as a child and a young man without a lot of support, but the life I live is mostly the life I wanted for myself in my youth and I've done most of what I had wanted to do. I've written and published novels, I've traveled a bit, I live in a library, and my wife and I still enjoy each other's company. I'm doing pretty well for myself.</p>
<p>(Fair warning: if my introduction seemed like too much, it only gets worse from here.)</p>
<h2>What's the story behind your blog?</h2>
<p>I can't remember ever not having some kind of website after I first got internet access through my college's computer lab back in 1996. I've always dabbled in writing about my life online and sharing bits and pieces of my fiction online. The internet was always a place where I could geek out in a way I never felt safe enough to do in "real life". Even though I wasn't diagnosed as autistic until I was about 41, my parents had taught me to keep a low profile, not show off what I knew, and not bore other people with my interests.</p>
<p>On my websites I wasn't obligated to play by those rules, so I didn't. I didn't even have to be myself online. Instead, I could call myself "Mabelode the Faceless" in the time-honored tradition of wannabe hackers adopting grandiose pseudonyms. Of course, I'm still doing that, but taking inspiration from a Judas Priest song instead of a Michael Moorcock novel.</p>
<p>For about a decade I ran a website under my real name at <a href="https://matthewgraybosch.com/">matthewgraybosch.com</a>, because posting fiction on Google+ had gotten me a book deal with an independent press and I needed a website to promote myself if I wasn't to be wholly dependent on parasocial media like Google+, Facebook, and Twitter. If I had been a bit smarter at the time, I would have registered <a href="https://starbreaker.org/">starbreaker.org</a> in 2013 instead of 2020 and never used my real name. Though if I had really been smart, I would not have let starbreaker.net go, which I had held from about 2000 to 2006.</p>
<p>I still have a website on <a href="https://matthewgraybosch.com/">matthewgraybosch.com</a>, but it's mainly a substitute for having a LinkedIn account because LinkedIn has always been the Ashley Madison of job hunting, only more cultish. I mean, have you seen the people posting there? It's like the Stepford Wives got equally robotic husbands and they all got corporate jobs.</p>
<p>Some would argue that my clinging to a personal website instead of "getting with the program" and doing social media or a podcast or video is pointless. However, the pointlessness is the point. It's rather like my science fantasy writing: a sacrament of defiance. I feel as though the world only values me (and men in general (and don't even get me started on the way women are still objectified; Elon Musk in particular reminds me of Immortan Joe from <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em>)) for my ability to further enrich the already wealthy. My saving the best of my effort and paltry intellect for a website or fiction that benefits nobody but merely amuses me is the sort of gentle rebellion that keeps me alive. Without it I'd have killed myself decades ago, because a life lived solely for the sake of others isn't a life at all, but a life sentence.</p>
<p>On a lighter note, it's helped me with dating, too. All of the women I've dated, I met online. It wasn't my face or physique that interested them, but my writing. One of them is my wife of twenty years. The possibility that she might read something I've posted online keeps me from being entirely unreasonable.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I'm just another opinionated guy who happens to be capable of running his own website, so I do. If I had more musical talent and better social skills, I might be playing in a heavy metal band on nights and weekends instead.</p>
<p>Instead, I have <a href="https://starbreaker.org/">starbreaker.org</a>, where I let my hair down and speak my mind straight from the heart. My opinions aren't necessarily palatable; I'm generally irreligious, anti-capitalist, and anti-authoritarian. I provide the usual disclaimers, but it should be obvious that I'm not speaking for my employers there, or their partners and clients. Besides, if somebody doesn't want to hire me because I play the edgelord on a personal website then they don't deserve to have my name on their payroll in the first place; they're not a <em>culture fit</em> for me because they think they have the right to expect me to put aside basic human rights like freedom of expression even when I'm not on the clock.</p>
<h2>What does your creative process look like when it comes to blogging?</h2>
<p>Wifi off, headphones on. Beyond that, it depends. Sometimes I know what I want to write and have most of it roughed out in my head before my fingertips touch the keyboard because it's been in the background of my mind like a daemon process. Sometimes I'm feeling my way through, exploring an idea, smacking it around like my cat with a hollow ball that dispenses a little kibble if he can get it to roll the right way.</p>
<p>And sometimes, I'm just angry — usually about real-world bullshit that a sensible person would dismiss as somebody else's problem because they don't have the power and authority to take meaningful action. I, however, am not a sensible person. (My wife is looking over my shoulder and saying, "Thank God", incidentally.)</p>
<p>Hemingway supposedly wrote a lot of his best work while drunk. I'd like to think I've managed a few epic rants while somewhere between high dudgeon and Shakespearean wrath. There's a trope in Japanese role-playing games which suggests that you can solve the world's problems by finding the right white-haired pretty-boy and beating the crap out of him, but the real-world has a surplus of problems and a marked shortage of atomic blond Adonises on whom the world's problems can be blamed. Besides, I've more experience with a pen than a sword, and I'm a middle-aged adult besides, so I use my words.</p>
<p>Ultimately, my creative process — such as it is — is often just me asking myself how I can go about leaving the world a few scars by which to remember me without hurting innocent people in the process. I am ultimately shouting at the void, daring it to shout back as the abyss might in a Nietzschean staring contest. And sometimes it does, too.</p>
<p>For example, last year I wrote a rant after reading a post by Jake Seliger in which he outlined his regrets, because most of them annoyed me; they sounded like the scoldings of would-be Jordan Petersen who thinks he knows something about the world because he's made a few mistakes. One of them, which he suggested was not widely applicable, was in my opinion the only one that mattered. He didn't see a doctor the moment he noticed that something was weird about his tongue. If he had, he might not have lost it to cancer. If he had, he might not be slowly dying.</p>
<p>A couple of months later, I got an email from a woman whom discretion forbids me to name. She went to the doctor after putting it off for months because she had read my rant. Turns out she's got cancer, too. I never heard from her again. I hope she made it, but I'll never know. All I know is that if she did make it, but never felt the need to write to me again, I might still have saved somebody's life.</p>
<h2>Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe the physical space influences your creativity?</h2>
<p>If I have an ideal creative environment, I haven't found it yet. I've written at food courts in crowded shopping malls while my wife went shopping. I've written in an overpriced apartment with thin walls while my neighbors had a domestic dispute (after calling the police). I've written in my bedroom as a young man while my parents screamed at each other over money. I've written in the break room at my day job. I've written in bed, unable to sleep, and in my home office while listening in on a conference call that should have been an email.</p>
<p>I'm not joking about any of this. I wrote one novel, <a href="https://starbreaker.org/fiction/novels/without-bloodshed/index.html"><em>Without Bloodshed</em></a>, 1000 words at a time while hiding in a pizza parlor near my office. I'd get a slice, write part of a scene, and go back to work. I finished the first draft in about 100 days of writing in this fashion. I worked on <a href="https://starbreaker.org/fiction/novels/silent-clarion/index.html"><em>Silent Clarion</em></a> while working the night shift, babysitting a server farm. Did a lot of blogging that year, too, but I haven't gotten around to digging those posts out of the archive.</p>
<p>Rather than waiting or searching for the right environment in which to write, I made do with what I had; Virginia Woolf might have needed a room of her own, but there were times when I didn't even have that. Instead, I counted myself lucky if my parents weren't at my door giving me grief for being at home writing instead of going out and trying to meet girls. Never mind that what little money I made from my part time job went toward college expenses (or maintenance on my bicycle) so I had no money for dating, let alone the time or inclination.</p>
<p>I've found that it isn't so much the physical space that affects my creativity, but the playlist. The wrong music can make achieving a flow state impossible, but the right music can make me all but unstoppable. A playlist has to have music complex enough to engage my brain and keep me from noticing the world around me, but not so complex that I focus more on the music than the task I've set myself. Also, when writing fiction, the music needs to match the character.</p>
<p>For example, I've had good sessions with albums by the Blue Öyster Cult, Queensrÿche, Therion, Hiromi Uehara, Thank You Scientist, Braindance, Galneryus, The Sisters of Mercy, Threshold, Savatage, Judas Priest, Ghost, Paradise Lost, and Iron Maiden. I've had terrible sessions with albums by Frank Zappa, even though he's an old favorite. Likewise King Crimson, Mahavishnu Orchestra, Steve Vai, Devin Townshend, Coheed and Cambria, Baroness, and Titans to Tachyons — all of whom have released excellent albums that just don't make for good writing music because they demand the listener's active attention.</p>
<p>The importance of having the right album playing doesn't apply solely to blogging, incidentally. It applies to my fiction writing and to my day job as a developer. All of these roles require that I be able to quickly and reliably access a flow state.</p>
<p>There's also the matter of tooling. I don't spend quite so much time in GNU Emacs that I use it to read and compose email, but that's mainly because setting up Emacs to interface with an IMAP-based provider is a pain in the ass and Fastmail's web interface is <em>good enough</em> that I'd rather not bother. Emacs has, however, become indispensable to me for writing in a way few other applications have. It is for me what Scrivener is for a lot of novelists, and it integrates with other tools in a way few writing tools can match. Those that can generally trace their descent to Bill Joy's vi editor.</p>
<h2>A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your tech stack?</h2>
<p>I doubt your more technical readers would find my stack particularly impressive, but everything's in <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~starbreaker/starbreaker.org">my site's git repository</a>, which is publicly accessible on Sourcehut.</p>
<p>I usually have "Rube Goldberg Variations" by Thank You Scientist on repeat when working on my tooling, incidentally. The title seemed fitting.</p>
<p>My host is Nearly Free Speech, and my website is served by Apache on FreeBSD. It's all static HTML pages with a little CSS (as a treat) so there's no database involved and no need for a server-side programming language or framework like PHP or Ruby on Rails, let alone the C# and ASP.NET I use at my day job.</p>
<p>Nor is there any JavaScript, let alone front-end frameworks like Bootstrap. It simply isn't needed for a personal website in my opinion, especially not with all the functionality that gets built into HTML5 and CSS3. I'm not one of those developers building their blog with Node.js and Astro or Eleventy, for example, let alone React. I don't even use a static site generator like Jekyll or Hugo, though I've tried both.</p>
<p>I write for my website in HTML with GNU Emacs on an old, secondhand computer running Slackware, and I compile Emacs myself to have the latest version. I used to use Markdown or Org Mode and convert to HTML with pandoc, but that gets slow once you've got a couple hundred posts in your archive (not to mention a few novels). Each page's metadata is stored in a separate file as shell variables that I source from my build script.</p>
<p>I make use of templates and partials, but implement them using shell scripts and a makefile that I run locally instead of depending on a continuous integration (CI) system. My dependencies are limited to bash, GNU coreutils, sed, awk, m4, exiftool, libjxl, avifenc, cwebp, HTML tidy, and tools from the W3C's HTML-XML-utils suite. My idea of deploying a website is to type "make install", which calls rsync and pushes changes to my host over SSH. If I really wanted automatic builds and deployments, I could set up a cron job on my Slackware machine.</p>
<p>Aside from the support for WebP, AVIF, and JPEG XL image formats, my stack is something I might have used in 1999 if I knew then what I knew today. It's just a MEWNIX system. My cats know this.</p>
<figure class="m-o" data-template="with"><div class="m-m"><img class="img" loading="lazy" src="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/pb-matthew-graybosch/9c25d1967c-1717050282/battlestation.jpg" style="aspect-ratio:1000 / 1333"></div><figcaption>Smudge (bottom right) and Purrseus (top left) taking turns as sysadmins</figcaption></figure>
<p>(At risk of ruining a joke by explanation: MEWNIX is a weak pun on UNIX, which was in turn a weak pun on MULTICS.)</p>
<h2>Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would you do anything differently?</h2>
<p>The main reason I have a blog is that everybody and their cat seems to have one. I can't help but wonder if maybe blogging really did break the World Wide Web, as some posts I've read suggest.</p>
<p>I find that blogging requires a different sort of focus, and that I don't necessarily refer to old blog posts when writing new ones. When blogging, it is easy to ignore the past in favor of the eternal present. This often leads to me repeating myself, or at least paraphrasing myself, because each post is a discrete and timestamped snapshot of what I was thinking in the moment. It seems a format better suited to machines than people.</p>
<p>If I were starting from zero today, or could go back 20 years knowing what I know today, I wouldn't start a blog. I would rather have the online equivalent of a <a href="https://starbreaker.org/blog/personal/making-a-grimoire/index.html">commonplace book or a grimoire</a>, with a single page per major topic that just keeps growing as I add to it. If I have written about a particular subject, such as commentary on a particular novel or heavy metal album, I would rather expand upon or refine what I have already written than write something entirely new.</p>
<p>I understand that this is also called digital gardening. However, having an internet grimoire appeals more to my inner child, who is still a thirteen-year-old edgelord trying to shock his elders by appearing to dabble in diabolism.</p>
<p>At the very least, I would not want to do as much blogging as I currently do, but instead take an excerpt from my commonplace and either summarize or reformat it as a blog post — or use the blog to highlight changes and additions to my grimoire.</p>
<p>I also think that blogging doesn't encourage deep reading on the part of visitors. You might read a blog post because somebody shared a link somewhere, but not bother to dig deeper into that site's archive. Furthermore, blogging in retrospect seems a precursor to social media, especially after RSS feeds and feed aggregators had their 15 minutes. This approach made it easy to think in terms of being a "content creator" and thus commodifying personal expression.</p>
<p>It's bad enough I have to be a commodity, or human capital, at my day job. I don't want to be a commodity in my recreation as well.</p>
<h2>Financial question since the web is obsessed with money: how much does it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost or does it generate some revenue? And what's your position on people monetising personal blogs?</h2>
<p>I rent my domain for about $15/year. Dot org domains don't seem trendy, so they're generally cheap. I rent disk, CPU, and bandwidth from Nearly Free Speech for about $5/month on average, though that's dependent mainly on traffic. Hosting on Nearly Free Speech is relatively cheap because they charge extra for technical support if you aren't the sort who can read a FAQ and figure things out yourself.</p>
<p>I pay the expenses of running a website out of my salary from my day job instead of trying to make a side hustle out of it. This is, oddly enough, recreation and self-care for me. My website is my work done my way, and that's priceless.</p>
<p>Besides, I spend a lot less to run my website than I have on any of the following in a given year:</p>
<ul>
<li>Local, state, and Federal property, sales, income, and payroll taxes</li>
<li>Power</li>
<li>Heating</li>
<li>Water</li>
<li>Sewage</li>
<li>Garbage collection</li>
<li>Rent/Mortgage payments</li>
<li>Groceries</li>
<li>My subscription to <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> (aka multiplayer power fantasy with anime melodrama and a symphonic power metal soundtrack)</li>
<li>Books, movies, and music on physical media</li>
<li>Dates with my wife</li>
<li>Health insurance premiums</li>
<li>Residential internet access from a regional monopoly provider those TOS won't let me self-host HTTP or email</li>
<li>Streaming video subscriptions that have little of interest to watch</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm against monetizing personal websites, but nobody elected me to have an opinion on what other people do with their own websites — and they certainly aren't <em>paying</em> me to care. If you want to turn your website into a side hustle, or can make a full-time living off of affiliate links and making people pay for the privilege of posting comments, more power to you. I just can't be bothered to do any of that myself.</p>
<p>Memo to people monetizing their sites with ads: don't expect me to turn off my ad blocker for you. I don't do that for <em>anybody</em>, because all adtech is malware and uBlock Origin is the new Norton Antivirus. And if you get really annoying, I'll disable JavaScript for your domain, too. Why? For the same reason I write: because I can, because I choose to, and because you can't stop me. If ads on your website can't support your expenses, too bad: that's what having a day job is for.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I'm even rethinking my "screw AI" and "screw Google" stance; it had occurred to me that by <a href="https://starbreaker.org/robots.txt">blocking AI crawlers</a> I am forgoing an opportunity to throw a monkey wrench (or a spanner for the Brits reading this) into OpenAI's works by injecting my irreligious, anti-capitalist, and anti-authoritarian sentiments into their training data. It would be amusing of ChatGPT encouraged young workers to ask themselves what America has done for <em>them</em> lately because OpenAI slurped down my blog without anything resembling meaningful human oversight.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there's enough machine-generated slop on the internet without me indirectly contributing to it.</p>
<h2>Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth checking out? And also, who do you think I should be interviewing next?</h2>
<p>I was tempted to suggest that you take a look at my <a href="https://starbreaker.org/bookmarks/">links page</a> and pick websites to check out, but reorganizing that page (and adding more sites) has been on my to-do list for a while now.</p>
<p>I'll try to keep this simple: with one exception that I'll list first, if I mention a website here it's probably worthwhile to interview its operator as well.</p>
<p>The exception is Simone Silvestroni at <a href="https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/">Minutes to Midnight</a>, because not only have <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/pb-simone-silvestroni">you already thought of him</a> but he seems to have submitted his reply with greater alacrity than I've managed.</p>
<ul>
<li>I like <a href="https://silviamaggidesign.com/">Silvia Maggi's</a> website, whom Simone often mentions. I didn't know she and Simone were married until recently; I never asked because I figured it was none of my business.</li>
<li>I also like <a href="https://maya.land/">maya.land</a>, not least because its content warning both amuses me and allows me to indulge in self-flattery; because I can chuckle when I read it, it proves I can take a joke.</li>
<li>I don't think Brian Russ has a blog, but he's been running the <a href="http://www.bnrmetal.com/v5/main/home">BNR Metal Pages</a> since 1995. It was one of the first websites I ever visited when I first got onto the internet at a college computer lab in late 1996.</li>
<li><a href="https://so1o.xyz/">so1o</a> is an otaku and gamer out of Hong Kong. He <a href="https://so1o.xyz/blog/designing-in-the-open">builds his website from scratch</a>, and he's better at it than he thinks.</li>
<li><a href="https://lysianth.us/">Lysianthus</a> is another website operator who isn't much for blogging. I like her style, though.</li>
<li><a href="https://frills.dev/">Frills</a> is a web developer from Wales with some <a href="https://frills.dev/experiments/">fun experiments</a>. I've made a lot of use of her <a href="https://frills.dev/experiments/html-named-colors/">HTML Named Colors</a> tool.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.kradeelav.com/">Kradeelav</a> is fun if you're into villains or leather. She does a lot of fan art, but isn't suitable for children. I liked her zine <a href="https://kradeelav.itch.io/boxofdoom"><em>The Box of Doom</em></a> (and bought a paper copy).</li>
<li><a href="https://www.marginalia.nu/">Viktor Lofgren</a> runs his own <a href="https://search.marginalia.nu">search engine</a>. That alone should make him worth interviewing.</li>
<li><a href="https://darylsun.page/">Daryl Sun</a> is a Filipina gamer and otaku building her own website and blog.</li>
<li><a href="https://foreverliketh.is/">foreverliketh.is</a> is a teacher and digital gardener.</li>
<li><a href="https://melonland.net/">Melon</a> runs a smol web forum that's closed on Mondays (Irish time).</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.basementcommunity.com/">Orchids</a> runs another smol web forum called Basement Community.</li>
<li><a href="https://btxx.org/">Bradley Taunt</a> is into minimalist web design, shell scripting, and OpenBSD.</li>
<li><a href="https://xandra.cc">xandra</a> was active in Yesterweb and is currently one of the major personalities behind <a href="https://32bit.cafe">32bit Cafe</a>.</li>

</ul>
<h2>Final question: is there anything you want to share with us?</h2>
<p>Oh, there's quite a bit I could share, and not all of it mine, but I'll get to the self-promotion in due course.</p>
<h3>Books</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Circe</em> by Madeline Miller retells the myths surrounding the sorceress who first proved an obstacle to Odysseus before becoming an ally, giving her a depth of character not readily apparent in the source material. I had written at some length about her first novel, <a href="https://starbreaker.org/blog/entertainment/song-of-achilles/index.html"><em>The Song of Achilles</em></a>, too.</li>
<li><em>A Thousand Ships</em> and <em>Stone Blind</em> by Natalie Haynes are more retellings of classic myths by a feminist classical scholar; Haynes also hosts "Natalie Haynes Stands Up for the Classics" for BBC Radio 4.</li>
<li>I am still reading Emily Wilson's translation of Homer's <em>Iliad</em>; my wife had given me the hardcover for Christmas. When I'm done I'll read her translation of the <em>Odyssey</em>, and I wonder what she'd make of Virgil's <em>Aeneid</em>.</li>
<li>I have at the top of one of my "read next" piles a copy of <em>Inanna</em> by Emily H. Wilson, no relation to the aforementioned translator of Homer. This novel deals with Sumerian myth, and includes a rather more down-to-earth depiction of Gilgamesh.</li>
<li>If retellings of ancient epics aren't your style, I'd like to recommend <a href="https://www.ljcohen.net/">L. J. Cohen's</a> space operas, starting with <a href="https://starbreaker.org/blog/entertainment/lj-cohen-derelict-worthy-heinlein/index.html"><em>Derelict</em></a>.</li>
<li>Sally Wiener Grotta has four feminist sf stories worthy of <a href="https://starbreaker.org/blog/entertainment/catherine-lucille-moore-queen-pulps/index.html">C. L. Moore</a> in her latest collection, <a href="https://www.sallywienergrotta.com/of-being-woman/"><em>Of Being Woman</em></a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Music</h3>
<p>I had been listening to some of the following while working on this post (and other things):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://nuclearpowertrio.bandcamp.com/album/a-clear-and-present-rager"><em>A Clear and Present Rager</em></a> and <a href="https://nuclearpowertrio.bandcamp.com/album/wet-ass-plutonium"><em>Wet Ass Plutonium</em></a> by the Nuclear Power Trio remind me of Liquid Tension Experiment on a Latin jazz kick, but with more puns and tongues wedged firmly in cheeks hidden by dictator masks.</li>
<li>Oddly enough for band that seems to mainly do jazz/synthwave fusion, I discovered Cloud People's <a href="https://cloudpeople1.bandcamp.com/album/simulacra"><em>Simulacra</em></a> album via a review on <a href="https://www.angrymetalguy.com/cloud-people-simulacra-review/">Angry Metal Guy</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://emberbelladonna.bandcamp.com/album/the-grove"><em>The Grove</em></a> by Ember Belladonna is folk metal with a flute as lead instrument, but flautist Emma Kramer-Rodger doesn't play like she's auditioning for a Jethro Tull revival band, and thank Arioch for that.</li>
<li>NYC's Braindance calls the music they do <a href="http://progressivedarkwave.com/brainbio.html">"progressive darkwave"</a>. It kinda reminds me of Type O Negative, but with more guitar shredding courtesy of axe witch Vora Vor. Whenever I put on their <em>Redemption</em> album from 2002, I settle into a groove, but I think I still have the promo tape I got from them while waiting to get into a show at the long-gone Roseland Ballroom in Manhattan back in 1995. And their website is a throwback to turn-of-the-century web design.</li>
</ul>
<h3>My Stuff</h3>
<p>I've got a fairly sizable archive of posts on my website, but I provide a <a href="https://starbreaker.org/blog/recommended.html">recommended page</a> as a starting point. It has web manifestos like "Party Like It's 1989" and "This Is Not My Side Hustle" along with rants like "Literature Ain't Burger King" and "Storming Heaven". Basically, something to offend everyone.</p>
<p>There's also <a href="https://starbreaker.org/fiction/index.html">my fiction</a>. After the rights to the fiction I had published with <a href="https://writerbeware.blog/2018/04/25/author-complaints-mount-at-curiosity-quills-press/">Curiosity Quills Press</a> reverted to me around 2020, I ended up putting it all on my website. Good thing, too, because my first novel <a href="https://starbreaker.org/fiction/novels/without-bloodshed/index.html"><em>Without Bloodshed</em></a> (2013) is long out of print, and my second novel <a href="https://starbreaker.org/fiction/novels/silent-clarion/index.html"><em>Silent Clarion</em></a> never got a print edition in the first place.</p>
<p>(For people interested in web development, I manage to publish both of these novels as a single page while using less data than a typical post on either Twitter, Bluesky, or Mastodon. My secret: no JavaScript, and no frameworks — just raw HTML with a little CSS.)</p>
<p>Both novels, as well as my <a href="https://starbreaker.org/fiction/stories/index.html">short stories</a> and <a href="https://starbreaker.org/fiction/index.html">other unfinished/abandoned work</a>, are pastiches of <em>Final Fantasy</em>, Michael Moorcock, and lyrics from Blue Öyster Cult and Judas Priest. My fiction page makes no secret of my influences, and you can also read <em>Silent Clarion</em> as a mostly-affectionate parody of urban fantasy and paranormal romances by the likes of Laurell K. Hamilton, Patricia Briggs, and Kim Harrison.</p>
<p>If you've ever decided against sharing something like <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com">Motherfucking Website</a> at work because of the profanity (or find it too Oedipal), I've got you covered. <a href="https://actualwebsite.org/">This is an Actual Website</a>.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, I have a somewhat more professional website at <a href="https://matthewgraybosch.com/">matthewgraybosch.com</a>. At least, I'm not using nearly as much profanity there, but I still claim to be a "full-stack thaumaturge" there. I'm also looking for a better job, so if anybody knows somebody looking to hire an experienced generalist techie with a patchwork DIY liberal arts education, please send them my way.</p>
<p>In closing, and to paraphrase what I say in party chat after a dungeon crawl or boss fight in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>: <strong>thanks for having me!</strong></p>

## US, Chinese defense leaders exchange views over contentious issues in Singapore

date: 2024-05-31, from: VOA News USA

Singapore — U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and Chinese Defense Minister Dong Jun held their first in-person meeting on the sideline of the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore on Friday.


The two officials exchanged views on a range of contentious issues, including the rising tension across the Taiwan Strait, the ongoing confrontation between the Philippines and China in the South China Sea, as well as major global conflicts like Russia’s war in Ukraine and the Middle East conflict.


During the 75-minute meeting, Austin and Dong both highlighted the importance of maintaining open lines of communication between the two militaries and vowed to resume the hotline between theater commanders from both sides in the coming months.


Austin reiterated Washington’s concern about China’s recent two-day military exercise encircling Taiwan and urged Beijing not to use Taiwan’s political transition, which he characterized as part of a routine democratic process, as "a pretext for coercive measures" against the democratic island.


At a news conference Friday following the meeting between the two defense officials, Chinese Defense Ministry spokesperson Wu Qian told journalists from more than a dozen Chinese and foreign media outlets, including VOA, that the Taiwan question remains purely China’s internal affairs and that external forces "have no right to interfere in the issue."


Washington’s behavior "severely violated the commitments made by the U.S. side" and sent wrong signals to "the Taiwan independence separatist forces," Wu said during the 50-minute news conference.


In addition to the rising tension across the Taiwan Strait, Austin and Dong also exchanged views on the ongoing confrontation between the Philippines and China in the South China Sea.


Austin said the United States will continue to "fly, sail, and operate" wherever international law allows safely and responsibly while stressing the importance of respecting high seas freedom of navigation under international law, especially in the South China Sea.


During the meeting, Dong said the Philippines has broken its promises due to support from "outside forces" and keeps making provocations on the disputed Second Thomas Shoal in the South China Sea, which both Beijing and Manila view as its territories, according to Chinese Defense Ministry spokesperson Wu.


The Chinese defense minister also criticized Washington for deploying mid-range missile systems to the Philippines "under cover of a military exercise," warning that such a move poses a real threat to regional security.


"We remain committed to resolving the disagreements with the Philippines side through consultation on an equal footing, but our tolerance for continued and intensified provocations will have a limit," Wu told journalists during the press conference.




Apart from the two contentious issues in the Indo-Pacific region, Austin and Dong also exchanged views on the ongoing wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. The U.S. defense secretary expressed Washington’s concerns about North Korea’s "direct contributions to Russia's ongoing assault on Ukraine."


Dong reiterated that China has maintained a "just and impartial position" on the Ukraine conflict, honored the promise of not providing weapons to either side in the war and strictly controlled the "export of military items and dual-use goods in accordance with relevant laws and regulations."


He urged the United States not to shift the blame for the ongoing war onto China and said that Beijing will continue to play a constructive role in promoting peace talks, according to Wu.


The Chinese Defense Ministry said the two sides will have ongoing consultations regarding future exchanges between the two militaries, with engagements between military academies and potential bilateral policy dialogues being the potential starting point.


"We believe that having meetings is better than no meeting and having dialogues is better than having no dialogue at all," Wu told journalists, adding that bilateral exchanges like this meeting can help develop "the sound and stable" military-to-military relationship.


Some analysts say the meeting between Austin and Dong is mainly focusing on "posturing" and sharing the fundamental and core interests and red lines from Beijing and Washington’s perspectives.


"The talk is not about negotiation or high-level diplomacy but more about establishing lines of communication for the hard work that usually goes on at the lower level," Stephen Nagy, a regional security expert at the International Christian University in Japan, told VOA.


While military-to-military communication between Beijing and Washington is important and has the effect of de-escalating growing regional tensions, one thing that remains to be seen is whether the Chinese side will "pick up the phone" in the event of an actual crisis.


"Due to the nature of China’s political system, power has been highly centralized under Xi Jinping, [so] we are not sure if our Chinese counterpart would be able to pick up the phone, communicate and make decisions in a crisis situation," he added.


Despite this uncertainty, some experts say conversations between defense leaders remain "incredibly helpful." The two officials “can have a conversation about intentions that’s incredibly stabilizing to the overall relationship, [but] I don’t think there is a lot of room for adjusting each side’s red lines," Rorry Daniels, managing director of the Asia Society Policy Institute, told VOA by phone.


But with tensions rising in several parts of Asia, including the Taiwan Strait, South China Sea, and the Korean Peninsula, some observers, say Friday’s dialogue between Austin and Dong will be increasingly crucial for the region, especially at a time when there are two ongoing military conflicts in the world.


"It is a way both sides can turn down the temperature, exchange information in a multilateral security forum, and have corridor diplomacy, which is extremely important for high-context Asian culture that shies away from talking about volatile issues openly and frankly in the public," Lim Tai Wei, Professor at the National University of Singapore, told VOA in a video interview.

## US-British strikes leave at 16 dead in Yemen, Houthi TV says

date: 2024-05-31, from: VOA News USA

DUBAI — The Houthi's Al-Masirah television said on Friday 16 people had been killed and 35 wounded in U.S. and British strikes on Yemen's Hodeidah Province.


The outlet reported that the strikes targeted a radio building in Hodeidah's Al-Hawk district and port of Salif.


The U.S. and British militaries said they launched strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen on Thursday as part of efforts to deter the militant group from further disrupting shipping in the Red Sea.


The U.S. Central Command said in a statement that U.S. and British forces had hit 13 targets in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen.


The British defense ministry said the joint operation targeted three locations in the Red Sea port city of Hodeidah, which it said housed drones and surface-to-air weapons.


"As ever, the utmost care was taken in planning the strikes to minimize any risk to civilians or non-military infrastructure," the British defense ministry said in a statement.


"Conducting the strikes in the hours of darkness should also have mitigated yet further any such risks."


The Houthis, who control Yemen's capital and most populous areas, have attacked international shipping in the Red Sea since November in solidarity with the Palestinians in the war between Israel and Hamas militants, drawing U.S. and British retaliatory strikes since February.

## US, China hold diplomatic talks to try to defuse tensions, advance cooperation

date: 2024-05-31, from: VOA News USA

STATE DEPARTMENT — Senior officials from the United States and the People's Republic of China held diplomatic talks in Washington on Thursday to try to defuse tensions, to discuss efforts to maintain military-to-military communication, and to advance cooperation.


Deputy U.S. Secretary of State Kurt Campbell hosted China's Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu at the State Department for talks aimed at maintaining open communication to prevent miscalculations and unintended conflicts, especially during times of tension. 


Following two hours of face-to-face discussions, U.S. and Chinese officials had a working lunch at the State Department. Later in the afternoon, U.S. deputy national security adviser Jon Finer continued discussions with Ma.


White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan also stopped by the meeting to greet Ma and exchanged views on key issues.


"The two sides discussed ongoing work to continue military-to-military communication and advance cooperation in areas where our interests align, such as counternarcotics," the White House said in a statement, ahead of the expected meeting between U.S. and China defense chiefs during the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore.


They also discussed areas of disagreement.


"Finer affirmed the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. He underscored U.S. support for international law and freedom of navigation in the South China Sea. The two sides also discussed Russia's war against Ukraine, challenges in the Middle East, and efforts to advance the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula," the White House statement said.




The visit by Ma follows U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken's trip to Shanghai and Beijing in April.  Officials said it builds on the U.S.'s intensive diplomacy with the PRC to responsibly manage competition in the relationship, even in areas where the two countries disagree. 


The State Department has said the U.S. is engaging in face-to-face diplomacy with China to clearly and directly communicate Washington's positions and intentions, aiming to make progress on bilateral, regional and global issues.


A spokesperson from PRC's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Ma would also "interact and communicate with representatives from various sectors in the U.S." during his visit to the country Thursday to Sunday.


State Department deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel said Thursday that the U.S. would continue its engagement with China at senior levels while raising concerns over contentious issues, including Beijing's support for Russia's war efforts in Ukraine. 


"If China does not curtail its support for Russia's defense industrial base, the U.S. would be prepared to take further steps," Patel told reporters during a briefing.


He added, "The PRC's reconstitution of the Russian defense industrial base not only threatens Ukrainian security but also threatens European security," a view held by the United States, the G7, the European Union and NATO countries.


However, Patel declined to preview any potential U.S. sanctions.


While in Beijing last month, Blinken voiced "serious concern" regarding China's support for Russia's defense industry, warning Chinese leaders that Washington could impose sanctions over the matter. 


China has defended its approach to Russia, saying it is engaged only in normal economic exchanges with a major trading partner. 


On Wednesday, Campbell renewed the U.S. warnings, saying Chinese support was helping to revitalize Russia's military capabilities, including long-range missiles, artillery, drones and battlefield tracking.


During his visit to Brussels, Campbell emphasized the urgent need for European and NATO countries "to send a collective message of concern to China about its actions, which we view are destabilizing in the heart of Europe." 


The latest U.S.-China talks occur just days after China conducted a large-scale, two-day military exercise involving 111 aircraft and 46 naval vessels around Taiwan. Washington has strongly urged Beijing to exercise restraint and has reaffirmed the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.


Mark Lambert, U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state for China and Taiwan, met virtually on May 23 with Hong Liang, the PRC's director-general for boundary and ocean affairs. During the meeting, Lambert expressed profound concerns regarding People's Liberation Army joint military drills in the Taiwan Strait and around Taiwan.

## First, and possibly only, look at Dell’s weird version of FreeBSD: ThinOS

date: 2024-05-30, from: OS News

About a week ago I reported on a case study from Dell and FreeBSD, about Dell&#8217;s ThinOS thin client operating system, which basically consists of a proprietary Dell GUI running on top of, at the moment, FreeBSD 12 (they&#8217;re moving to FreeBSD 14 for the next ThinOS release). Well, this got me interested &#8211; I&#8217;ve always been fascinated by thin clients, and a Dell/Wyse FreeBSD &#8216;distribution&#8217; is just wild enough to be interesting &#8211; so I went onto eBay, and bought a Dell thin client. More specifically, I bought a Dell OptiPlex 3000 Thin Client, which comes with an Intel Pentium Silver N6005, a four core CPU without hyperthreading, 16 GB of RAM, a 32GB eMMC storage chip with room for a small M.2 SSD, WiFi 6, Ethernet, USB 3.0, 2.0, and C ports, Bluetooth, and so on. A low-power, but still quite capable little computer that I snagged for a mere €130, which is a steal compared to the full unit price; my configuration is sold new for like €700-800. Of course, these things are sold in batches of hundreds or maybe even thousands of units, and in such volumes corporate clients get massive discounts. Still, it&#8217;s a nice deal. My model came installed with Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, which I was not at all interested in. I immediately downloaded the latest ThinOS version for my model, used Dell&#8217;s tool and instructions to create a bootable USB, and got to work. The installation process was quick and easy, and does indeed look like an automated FreeBSD installation, TUI and all. After the installation is completed, you get guided through a first-run experience to configure things like the keyboard, WiFi, and so on, and it looks rather fancy. Once I completed the first-run experience, I hit the roadblock I was expecting: in order to use ThinOS, you need a ThinOS Activation License. Since my device was originally sold with (I think) Ubuntu preinstalled, it doesn&#8217;t have a TAL in its UEFI, and the only way to push a TAL to a device is to use the Dell Wyse Management Suite. Sadly, the Dell WMS only runs on Windows, and to make matters far worse, only on Windows Server. And it gets even worse &#8211; even if I created a Windows Server VM just to run WMS, I need the Pro version, which isn&#8217;t free (the free Standard version cannot push TALs), and I&#8217;d need to buy a TAL. Aside from the Windows Server restriction, I was aware of these limitations and requirements, so I&#8217;m not in the least bit surprised. I was curious to see if buying a TAL was an easy experience, or if it&#8217;s entirely geared towards enterprise customers and silly hobbyists like me need not apply. Without a license, I can use the proprietary Dell user interface, but it seems I can&#8217;t connect to any possible VDI providers, and I can&#8217;t tell what other features might be gated at the moment. With some admittedly very mild poking and prodding, I also haven&#8217;t been able to discover any ways of &#8216;leaving&#8217; Dell&#8217;s proprietary GUI to get to a terminal. I&#8217;ll do some more prodding over the coming days. I&#8217;m not entirely sure where to go from here when it comes to seeing just how much you can do with ThinOS, which was my original goal for this project. I have a feeling the pro version of the Dell Wyse Management Suite is going to be rather expensive &#8211; I can&#8217;t find any pricing information, which confirms my suspicions &#8211; so I think the journey ends here. Unless any OSNews readers have experience with this stuff, and can point me to some tips and tricks to perhaps acquire and install a TAL some other way, there won&#8217;t be a more in-depth look at Dell&#8217;s weird version of FreeBSD on OSNews. Which sucks, but was to be expected when it comes to enterprise software. Mind you, this does not mean the hardware is going to waste. Not only are there other purpose-built thin client operating systems to experiment with, it is also a full-fledged tiny x86 computer with completely silent passive cooling and a free M.2 slot, so the possibilities are endless.

## Coordinated effort leads to arrest of Chinese national for cyberattacks

date: 2024-05-30, from: VOA News USA

Washington — A 35-year-old Chinese national is facing charges related to committing cybercrimes that FBI Director Christopher Wray described as “likely the world’s largest botnet ever.”  


The arrest in Singapore was the result of an international coordinated effort that included law enforcement agencies from Germany, Singapore, the United States and Thailand. 


YunHe Wang, arrested on May 24, is accused of being the creator of the 911 S5 botnet, a residential proxy service.  


Wang, along with other unnamed parties, created the 911 S5 botnet to facilitate “cyber-attacks, large-scale fraud, child exploitation, harassment, bomb threats, and export violations,” said Attorney General Merrick Garland in a Department of Justice press release on Wednesday.   


Wang sold access to infected IP addresses to cybercriminals in exchange for crypto or fiat currency. From these transactions, he received at least $99 million in profits, the DOJ stated.  


The cybercriminals Wang transacted with were allegedly able to use the infected IP addresses to “bypass financial fraud detection systems and steal billions of dollars from financial institutions, credit card issuers, and federal lending programs,” according to the DOJ release.  


The compromised IP addresses allowed Wang’s customers to create fraudulent unemployment claims that targeted pandemic relief programs. The United States estimates they lost $5.9 billion from these fraudulent claims.  


Wang used his profits to buy property in China, St. Kitts and Nevis, the United States, Singapore, Thailand and the United Arab Emirates. Wang also spent his money on luxury cars and watches.  


Wang faces several charges including substantive computer fraud, conspiracy to commit computer fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. Wang could face up to 65 years in prison if convicted.  


Some information for this report was provided by Reuters and Agence France-Presse.

<p>This absence of data (as well as the complexity and unpredictability of the storms) has been a problem not just <a href="https://today.tamu.edu/2023/03/28/why-tornadoes-are-still-hard-to-forecast-even-though-storm-predictions-are-improving/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>when it comes to forecasting</u></a> tornadoes, but also in understanding how or even <em><em>if</em></em> they’re being affected by climate change. After <a href="https://www.foxweather.com/weather-news/memorial-day-weekend-severe-weather-forecast" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>at least 26 people</u></a> were killed across eight states over Memorial Day weekend, this knowledge gap has felt especially urgent and worrisome.</p>
<p>But <a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/apme/aop/JAMC-D-23-0143.1/JAMC-D-23-0143.1.xml" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a new analysis</u></a> of research recently published by the American Meteorological Society’s <em><em>Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology </em></em>might at last shed some much-needed light on how tornadoes have changed in the last half-century. (The research has passed peer review but is not yet in its final published form.) According to the paper’s authors — Timothy Coleman of the University of Alabama in Huntsville; Richard Thompson of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma; and Gregory Forbes, formerly of the Weather Channel — between 1951 and 2020, “tornadogenesis events” have trended both eastward and “away from the warm season, especially the summer, and toward the cold season.”</p>
<p>This is intriguing for several reasons. For one thing, it means more and more tornadoes are forming <a href="https://images.app.goo.gl/E859AXY8BtR1ZNDg6" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>outside Tornado Alley</u></a> (which runs north-south through the Great Plains) and in densely populated southeastern and midwestern states like Arkansas, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and southwest Kentucky. We truly <em><em>aren’t</em></em> in Kansas anymore.</p>
<p>While spring is traditionally thought of as “tornado season” by those with storm cellars in their backyards, the authors of the paper also point to a rise in tornadoes during the “cold season,” defined as September through February. Such a shift in seasonality could potentially increase the destruction and disruption of tornadoes that catch people off guard over the holidays or simply unawares. The analysis indicates that the frequency of winter tornadoes has increased by a staggering <em><em>102% </em></em>from 1951 to 2020, further underscoring the potential dangers of the changing seasonal patterns.</p>
<p>While the “causes of any geographic and seasonal shifts in tornado activity” were not within the scope of the analysis, the authors did offer a handful of insights. Some studies have suggested that decreasing sea ice might reduce <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-018-0025-9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>summer tornadoes</u></a>, and that the Pacific decadal oscillation and the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation could also play a role. Another researcher used numerical models to determine that “tornado environments may be less favorable in spring by the late 21st century” <a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/34/22/JCLI-D-20-0901.1.xml" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>due to climate change</u></a>.  These conditions, in some part or combination, could potentially result in a reversal of the changes observed in the paper “in future years.”</p>
<p>For now, though, the analysis found the most significant decrease in annual tornadoes in eastern Kansas through Oklahoma and northern Texas, while the most significant increase was in southern Mississippi. The authors even offered a bit of real estate advice: avoid Jackson, Mississippi, which saw one of the greatest increases in tornadoes of any city in the United States, and exhale if you’ve recently purchased property in Cleburne, Texas, which saw one of the greatest decreases.</p>
<p>Much of avoiding disaster and tragedy comes down simply to <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/noaa-hurricane-forecast-2024" target="_self"><u>being prepared</u></a>, though. That, of course, requires knowing who should be making such preparations and when. While there is still much left to understand about tornadoes, the new analysis offers a better picture than what we had before. </p>
<p>But it’s still up to agencies to get the word out — and to Hollywood. The <em><em>Twister </em></em>sequel is <a href="https://people.com/luke-combs-drops-aint-no-love-in-oklahoma-featured-on-twisters-soundtrack-8649928" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reportedly set in Oklahoma</u></a>.</p>

## Tribute to late Iranian president at UN stirs anger

date: 2024-05-30, from: VOA News USA

United Nations — The U.N. General Assembly drew criticism Thursday for its tribute to the late Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi who died in a helicopter crash, with Washington boycotting the gathering. 


Following a minute's silence, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres offered his condolences to the families of the victims of the May 19 incident, as well as to the Iranian people. 


"I wish to assure that the United Nations stands in solidarity with the Iranian people and in the quest for peace, development and fundamental freedoms," Guterres said. 


"For that, the United Nations will be guided by the Charter to help realize peace and security, sustainable development and human rights for all," he added. 


Asked about the U.N. chief offering condolences in the days after the leader's death, Guterres's official spokesman defended his position. 




The secretary-general "has never been shy about expressing his deep concerns about the human rights situation in Iran, notably on the issues of women," Stephane Dujarric said. 


"It does not stop him from expressing condolences when the head of state of a Member State of this organization, and a foreign minister, with whom he met regularly … dies in a helicopter crash," he added. 


The General Assembly pays tribute to any head of state of a U.N. member country who dies in office, including Namibian President Hage Geingob, an independence stalwart, last February, and North Korean leader Kim Jong Il in 2011. 


Pakistan's ambassador to the U.N., Munir Akram, spoke for the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and hailed what he called Raisi's legacy of "socio-economic and political transformation" in Iran. 


No representatives of Western countries spoke at the tribute and some, such as France and the United States, did not send representatives. 


"The U.N. should be standing with the people of Iran. Raisi was involved in numerous, horrific human rights abuses, including the extrajudicial killings of thousands of political prisoners in 1988," said Nate Evans, spokesman for the U.S. delegation.  


"Some of the worst human rights abuses on record took place during his tenure," Evans added. 


Outside the U.N. headquarters in New York several dozen protesters opposed to the Iranian authorities chanted "shame on U.N." 


Israel's ambassador Gilad Erdan, who condemned the initial minute silence at the Security Council on May 20, also criticized Thursday's event. 


"The UN was founded to prevent atrocities, but today it salutes mass-murdering dictators!" he wrote on X last week.

## Will America’s Wet, Hot Summer Upend the 2024 Race?

date: 2024-05-30, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjM1ODgyNS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3ODU0MzYzOX0.W81OcAXN0xrpggZY14ET1jPAIyqNlPGfHQ9n6pX08Co/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">Of the 158 days left to go before the presidential election, 94 of them will fall during the summer. Such an alignment is not entirely a coincidence — the 29th U.S. Congress designated the first Tuesday in November for voting in order to avoid summer planting and the autumn harvest — but in 2024, the overlap between the hottest months of the year and the feverish finale of the presidential campaign is especially apropos. </p><p>Fire agencies have warned of an “<a href="https://www.nifc.gov/nicc-files/predictive/outlooks/monthly_seasonal_outlook.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>above average</u></a>” wildfire season in the Southwest, northern Great Lakes, <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/owyhee-canyonlands-monument-biden" target="_self"><u>northern Great Basin</u></a>, and Hawaii. Last week, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued the <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/noaa-hurricane-forecast-2024" target="_self"><u>most active hurricane outlook</u></a> in its history. The western Great Plains and the intermountain West are in a <a href="https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/expert_assessment/sdo_summary.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>worsening drought</u></a>. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianbushard/2024/05/01/bigger-heat-waves-could-be-in-store-this-summer-as-forecasters-predict-more-above-average-temperatures-heres-where/?sh=52eb4a62395c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Forecasters at AccuWeather</u></a> predicted widespread heat waves over much of the eastern and southern United States in the coming months. Emergency managers are bracing for the “new normal” of <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/vermont-rain-storm-flooding-climate" target="_self"><u>deadly summer rainfall</u></a>. </p><p>But will a wet, hot, <a href="https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-matters/2024-summer-package" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>climate change-driven summer</u></a> be enough to tilt the election in someone’s favor? </p><p>We know that climate-related issues <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/climate-change-voting-elections" target="_self"><u><em><em>can</em></em></u><u> swing elections</u></a> — clean air and water, cheap energy, and creating new high-paying jobs all poll exceptionally well. Voter interest tends to drop off, however, when these things are framed as climate issues. And on the darker flip side, the realities of living in a hotter world, including “unchecked migration, economic stagnation, and the loss of homeland,” are “precisely the kind of developments that have historically fomented authoritarian sentiments,” Justin Worland <a href="https://time.com/6554410/climate-change-democracy-2024-elections/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>argued in </u><u><em><em>Time</em></em></u></a> earlier this year. Donald Trump, meanwhile, has repeatedly proved eager to <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/biden-trump-climate-debate" target="_self"><u>go toe-to-toe</u></a> with President Joe Biden on things like <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-fact-check-climate-change" target="_self"><u>clean energy, electric vehicles, and climate science</u></a>.</p><p>But how much extreme weather events themselves could swing the November election is far less clear. Research suggests that even living through a traumatic event like a wildfire or hurricane isn’t necessarily enough to convert you into a climate voter. “Experience matters, but I don’t know that it matters in the way that people <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/wishcasting#:~:text=wishcasting%20(uncountable),a%20conclusion%3B%20a%20wishful%20forecast." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>wishcast</u></a> it to,” Matto Mildenberger, a political scientist at the University of California, Santa Barbara who has <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/abs/wildfire-exposure-increases-proenvironment-voting-within-democratic-but-not-republican-areas/8F483913E13A44DCB975CE90024C0931" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>studied the relationship</u></a> between proximity to wildfires and pro-environmental voting, told me.</p><p>As Mildenberger explained, “In order to experience a wildfire or a heat wave or a flood and have that galvanize you into wanting to see more ambitious climate action, you’d have to experience and understand yourself as a victim of climate change.” For decades, fossil fuel interests have worked to undermine the scientific narrative and cast doubt on the links between extreme weather and climate, which is why even Republicans who experience disasters firsthand still “fall back onto stories about how there have always been wildfires, there have always been droughts.” </p><p>In other words, this is not a chicken-or-egg enigma. How voters <em><em>already think </em></em>about climate change is what shapes their ensuing narratives about disasters. Peter Howe, a professor of geography at Utah State University who studies public perceptions of climate change, conducted a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352154621001200" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>survey</u></a> of research on behavioral outcomes in relation to extreme weather that reinforced this idea. He found that “extreme weather may reinforce opinions among people who are already worried about climate change, yet be misattributed or misperceived by those who are unconcerned.”</p><p>There is evidence that linking climate change with extreme weather could actually backfire<em> </em>at the ballot box for green-minded candidates<em><em>. </em></em>A <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abo2190" target="_blank">2022 study</a> led by Rebecca Perlman, a professor of political science at the University of California, Berkeley, found that Republicans who saw references to climate change after a wildfire became less likely to support an energy tax that would “protect against future wildfires and other natural disasters.” Concerningly, this pattern even showed up (albeit with “weaker and generally nonsignificant effects”) among Democrats and Independents, leading Perlman and her coauthor to suggest that “on the margin, attributing weather-related natural disasters to climate change may be a losing political proposition with voters.”</p><p>Perlman confirmed that she would be “surprised” if extreme summer weather had “much impact on voting at the national level” when I reached her via email. But that “doesn’t mean it will be precisely zero,” she went on.</p><p>Mildenberger made a similar point. Though a hurricane or a wildfire is unlikely to peel Republican voters away from Trump (and might even push some deeper into his arms), if you take <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/8-climate-races-election-2024" target="_self"><u>a more regional lens</u></a>, then you could “easily expect extreme weather events to reshape how people are prioritizing their vote, or their likelihood of volunteering, or how they’re talking to their friends and family about the current administration.” </p><p>But while hurricanes, droughts, wildfires, and heat waves can confirm Democratic priors and motivate liberals who wouldn’t otherwise have voted, Matthew Burgess, a professor of environmental studies at the University of Colorado, Boulder, warned me against lumping all conservatives together as uniformly undisturbed. “Even deep red parts of Colorado get worried about drought and water scarcity,” he pointed out. </p><p>Burgess’ <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/10494414" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>research</u></a> has found that Independents and liberal-to-moderate Republicans worry about climate change only slightly less than moderate-to-conservative liberals do; it’s conservative Republicans who are set far apart from the rest of the electorate, sometimes skewing results. In other words, while many studies look at extreme weather events and climate change attribution and frame the results as Republicans versus Democrats, the actual split in how voters interpret extreme weather events might be better framed as between the<em><em> most</em></em> <em><em>conservative</em></em> Republicans and everyone else.</p><p>The bigger question, in Burgess’s mind, is whether extreme weather could ever rival issues like crime or inflation, which generally affect a greater portion of the electorate, for a place in voters’ hearts. “If you had a really big natural disaster that directly affects a broad swath of people, and whose link to climate change is really clear — <em><em>that</em></em> would be the type of thing I would expect to have an effect” on voters, Burgess said.</p><p>Admittedly, it’s scary to imagine what exactly that event might be. A massive wildfire season with smoke that <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/wildfire-smoke-east-air-quality" target="_self"><u>blankets the entire country</u></a> or breaks out in <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/the-maui-fires-reveal-the-growing-danger-of-compound-climate-events" target="_self"><u>a place we don’t expect</u></a>? Hurricanes that pummel both the East Coast <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/future-floods-california-hilary" target="_self"><u><em><em>and</em></em></u><u> the West Coast</u></a>? So much flooding that <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/nyc-flooding-whirlpool-subway-sea-lions" target="_self"><u>whirlpools appear in the streets</u></a> of American cities? Or something we <em><em>haven’t </em></em>already experienced and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/21/opinion/climate-change-greenhouse-gas-emissions.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>maybe haven’t even anticipated</u></a>?</p><p>If there were ever a summer to find out, it’d be this one. It’s <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/07/climate/record-hot-april/index.html#:~:text=Hausfather%20estimates%20a%2066%25%20chance,%2Dindustrial%20levels%2C%20he%20said." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>another</u></a> “hottest year ever” on Planet Earth, and even if Americans <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-climate-change-project-2025" target="_self"><u>don’t ultimately vote like it</u></a>, that truth will remain.</p>

## US Supreme Court boosts NRA in free speech fight with New York official

date: 2024-05-30, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court gave a boost on Thursday to the National Rifle Association in its free speech dispute with a New York state official it accused of coercing banks and insurers to avoid doing business with the influential gun rights advocacy group. 


The justices, in a 9-0 decision authored by liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor, threw out a lower court's ruling that dismissed the NRA's 2018 lawsuit against Maria Vullo, a former superintendent of New York's Department of Financial Services. The NRA has claimed that Vullo unlawfully retaliated against it following a mass shooting in which 17 people were killed at a high school in Parkland, Florida. 


At issue in the dispute is whether Vullo had wielded her regulatory power to coerce New York financial institutions into cutting ties with the NRA in violation of protections under the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment against government restrictions on free speech. 


"Ultimately, the critical takeaway is that the First Amendment prohibits government officials from wielding their power selectively to punish or suppress speech, directly or, as alleged here, through private intermediaries," Sotomayor wrote. 


The case will now return to the lower courts for further analysis of the NRA's allegations under the standard articulated in the Supreme Court's ruling. 


Vullo called upon banks and insurers to consider the "reputational risks" of doing business with gun rights groups following the February 2018 Parkland shootings. In the aftermath of the Parkland rampage by a 19-year-old former student armed with an AR-15 rifle, NRA officials lashed out at gun control advocates, arguing that Democratic elites were politicizing the shootings to erode gun rights. 


Vullo later fined Lloyd's of London and two other insurers more than $13 million for offering an NRA-endorsed product called "Carry Guard" that Vullo's office found was in violation of New York insurance law. The product provided liability coverage for policyholders who caused injuries from gunfire, even in cases involving the wrongful use of a firearm.  


The insurers agreed to stop selling NRA-endorsed products that New York considered illegal. 


The NRA's lawsuit, seeking unspecified monetary damages, accused Vullo of unlawfully retaliating against the group for its constitutionally protected gun rights advocacy by targeting it with an "implicit censorship regime." Its suit alleged that New York's "blacklisting" campaign sought to deprive the NRA of basic financial services and threatened its advocacy work. 


The case did not involve the Constitution's Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. 


The Supreme Court heard arguments in the case in March. 


The NRA is the largest and most powerful gun rights organization in the United States and has been instrumental in thwarting Democratic-backed gun restrictions in the U.S. Congress. The nonprofit group is organized under the laws of New York state, with its main offices in Virginia. 


A federal judge in 2021 dismissed all of the NRA's claims apart from two free speech counts against Vullo. The Manhattan-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2022 said those also should have been dismissed, prompting the NRA's Supreme Court appeal. 


The NRA found an unlikely ally in the case in President Joe Biden's administration. Even though Biden has called gun violence a national embarrassment, his administration had urged the justices to let the NRA pursue its lawsuit.  


The administration argued that a lower court should determine whether Vullo's actions crossed the line between permissible criticism of the NRA and coercion aimed at suppressing a disfavored viewpoint in violation of the First Amendment protections. 


The case was the latest to come before the Supreme Court involving the NRA, a group closely aligned with Republicans that has opposed gun control measures and backed pivotal lawsuits that have widened U.S. gun rights.  


Americans remain deeply divided over how to address firearms violence including mass shootings even as the Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has taken an expansive view of gun rights. 


Vullo was sued in both her official and personal capacities. But the 2nd Circuit found that Vullo would be protected from suit under the legal defense of qualified immunity that shields officials from civil litigation in certain circumstances. 


The Supreme Court by the end of June is expected to issue rulings in two gun rights cases. One involves a challenge to the legality of a federal ban on "bump stock" devices that enable semiautomatic weapons to fire rapidly like machine guns. The other involves a challenge to the legality of a federal law that makes it a crime for people under domestic violence restraining orders to have guns.

## US sanctions Ugandan officials over graft, rights abuse claims

date: 2024-05-30, from: VOA News USA

Nairobi — The United States said on Thursday it was imposing sanctions on five senior Ugandan officials over accusations of involvement in corruption or human rights abuses.


Ugandan parliament speaker Anita Among was one of four officials the US State Department said would face travel bans because of "significant corruption", following similar action by Britain last month.


Mary Goretti Kitutu and Agnes Nandutu -- previously ministers responsible for Uganda's isolated and impoverished border region of Karamoja -- and former state minister for finance Amos Lugolobi were also named.


State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said in a statement the three had "misused public resources and diverted materials from Uganda's neediest communities".


"All four officials abused their public positions for their personal benefit at the expense of Ugandans," he added.


In addition, Peter Elwelu, former deputy chief of the Ugandan Peoples' Defense Forces (UPDF), has been sanctioned "due to his involvement in gross violations of human rights", he said.


While commanding defense forces, Elwelu was involved in extrajudicial killings committed by UPDF members, Miller said, without giving further information.


"As a result of these actions, the designated Ugandan officials are generally ineligible for entry into the United States."


Miller said Washington is also planning to impose visa restrictions on multiple other Ugandan officials for "undermining the democratic process and repressing members of marginalized or vulnerable populations in Uganda".


In April, the British government imposed travel bans and asset freezes on Among, Kitutu and Nandutu over claims of corruption.


At the time the Ugandan parliament said the sanctions on Among were based on a "false premise" and imposed because of her stance on the East African country's controversial anti-gay legislation adopted last year.


Kitutu and Nandutu are accused of stealing roofing materials destined for the poor under a government-funded project and redirecting them to politicians and their families.

Several major pension funds said ahead of the meeting that they would vote to remove most of Exxon’s board after the company sued activist shareholders pushing for stronger emissions reduction targets. Though most of its petrochemical peers have similar targets, the company argued that the activists’ true goal was to “interfere with ExxonMobil’s business and to promote their own interests over those of ExxonMobil’s shareholders.” </p><p>The resistance effort “amounted to a test of whether top fund firms would rally to defend the small shareholders whose resolutions have put topics like the environment and workforce diversity at the center of many corporate annual meetings,” <em>Reuters</em> said. “Wednesday’s results suggested the answer was no.” All 12 of Exxon’s director nominees received between 87% and 98% support at the meeting, the company reported. The activists, meanwhile, withdrew their proposal in February, but Exxon is still <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-27/exxon-xom-investor-sued-for-climate-proposal-promises-to-back-off?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9gJ_DIPUbYqw6sXhacTKpnisetIEAskAdY7ePtjJPDCN-nXVgztEZO2X-RhIbyBXhqbSsB" target="_blank">pursuing the matter</a> in court.</p><h3>2. EV charging companies hire former Tesla employees</h3><p>The U.S. electric vehicle sector is <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/how-charging-rivals-plan-to-thrive-on-teslas-chaos/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9gJ_DIPUbYqw6sXhacTKpnisetIEAskAdY7ePtjJPDCN-nXVgztEZO2X-RhIbyBXhqbSsB" target="_blank">snapping up</a> Tesla employees who were laid off when the company gutted its charging team last month. Atlanta-based charging provider EnviroSpark Energy Solutions has hired a dozen of them, <em>E&E News</em> reported, while other charging companies have landed high-profile hires let go by Tesla or are in talks to do so. “It does present an awesome opportunity for other charging operators like us to fill in the gap,” David Jankowsky, CEO of Francis Energy, told <em>E&E News</em>. There is still some trepidation, however, over how Tesla’s tribulations could affect the broader industry’s future. Despite its poor recent performance, Tesla still dominates the U.S. EV market, so a dip in consumer confidence could have negative ripple effects on EV uptake.</p><h3>3. Rich countries meet $100 billion aid target two years late</h3><p>The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development announced Wednesday that the world’s rich countries had <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b9f24e37-9154-4fc4-b410-25f45782b8ba?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9gJ_DIPUbYqw6sXhacTKpnisetIEAskAdY7ePtjJPDCN-nXVgztEZO2X-RhIbyBXhqbSsB" target="_blank">met their goal</a> of delivering $100 billion in annual climate finance to poorer countries in 2022 — two years after their self-imposed deadline, the group said. The 2020 target was first set at the 2009 United Nations climate change conference in Copenhagen, and the delay in meeting it had strained recent climate talks. Developed countries came up with $115.9 billion in climate finance in 2022, <a href="https://www.oecd.org/newsroom/developed-countries-materially-surpassed-their-usd-100-billion-climate-finance-commitment-in-2022-oecd.htm?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9gJ_DIPUbYqw6sXhacTKpnisetIEAskAdY7ePtjJPDCN-nXVgztEZO2X-RhIbyBXhqbSsB" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">OECD data shows</a>, an increase of 30% from 2021. That’s the biggest year-on-year jump so far. “Exceeding this annual commitment materially by more than 15% is an important and symbolic achievement which goes some way towards making up for the two-year delay, which should help build trust,” OECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann said in a statement.</p><p>Climate advocates warned, however, that achieving this aim is not an end point in itself. Transitioning to clean energy and adapting to new climate realities are both expensive processes. “While domestic finance, strong policies and private finance are important, for these countries, international public finance needs to play a lynchpin role,” Melanie Robinson, global climate, economics and finance director at the World Resources Institute, said in a statement. Discussions about setting a new climate finance goal will be a centerpiece of COP29 in Azerbaijan.</p><h3>4. An IRA rebate roll-out</h3><p>New York will be the first state to launch home energy rebates created by the Inflation Reduction Act, the Biden administration announced Thursday. The initial phase of New York’s $158 million rebate program will be aimed at single-family homes and multifamily properties with up to four units, while later phases will expand to larger buildings and retailers. It will provide up to $14,000 per housing unit for upgrades such as better insulation, heat pumps, and heat pump water heaters. A separate, $159 million IRA home efficiency rebate program is expected to follow. Massachusetts, Michigan and Rhode Island have all applied for the funding to establish their own home energy rebate programs under the IRA — a process that’s turned out to be <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/biden-heat-pump-rebates?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9gJ_DIPUbYqw6sXhacTKpnisetIEAskAdY7ePtjJPDCN-nXVgztEZO2X-RhIbyBXhqbSsB" target="_self">messier</a> than some had hoped, according to Heatmap’s Emily Pontecorvo. </p><h3>5.

Globally, the average person experienced 26 more extra-hot days due to climate change, while in a few countries, that number exceeded 120, according to the report by Climate Central, the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre, and World Weather Attribution. The researchers considered temperatures abnormal when they exceeded 90% of a location’s daily readings recorded between 1991 and 2020. Americans experienced 39 such days in total over the last 12 months. Almost 80% of the world’s population experienced 31 or more.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

## Help identify these obscure operating systems and vendors

date: 2024-05-30, from: OS News

Over on the GNU config-patches mailing list, Zack Weinberg is looking for help identifying a number of ancient operating systems and vendors. These are probably all either vendor or OS names from the late 1980s or early 1990s. Can anyone help me fill out the following list of things that ought to appear in testsuite/config-sub.data, if I knew what to put in place of the question marks? ???-pc533 ???-pc533-??????-sim ???-sim-??????-ultra ???-ultra-??????-unicom ???-unicom-??????-acis ???-???-aos???-triton ???-???-sysv3???-oss ???-???-sysv3???-storm-chaos ???-???-??? ↫ Zack Weinberg One of them has already been identified &#8211; &#8220;storm-chaos&#8221; turns out to have been added to binutils and/or maybe GCC in 2000, and after some digging around, John Marshall found what it&#8217;s referring to: chaos, a hobby operating system for x86 written in C. It has a long history, and after a period of inactivity came back in 2015 with a new website. Some new releases followed, with the last one being version 0.3.0 in 2019. It&#8217;s been silence since then. The others are still up for grabs to be discovered. There is some talk that the pc533 one might be a misspelling of pc532, which would refer to the &#8220;NS32K-based PC532 board running NetBSD&#8221;. This is an incredibly obscure complete system built around the NS32532, of which only around 150 were built in the early &#8217;90s. However, Weinberg is hesitant to accept this theory without more information, since there is already code to handle the pc532, and he wants to be sure before making any changes. If there is one place on the internet outside of the GNU mailing lists that might be able to help Weinberg, it&#8217;s the OSNews audience. We have so many older people reading OSNews who have been working or otherwise active in this field for many decades, and I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if these cryptic names make some bells ring for some of you. If one of you does e-mail a reply, be sure to mention this article &#8211; organic marketing to help keep us going!

## AI and the English language

date: 2024-05-30, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>I was going through my morning routine of checking emails and various forums and chats, when I stumbled on <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@eleventy/112526068812208213">this post on mastodon</a>.</p>
<p>Not going to comment on the stupidity of the suggestion itself but it got me wondering if the fact that most of the web is English-based is going to be both a blessing and a curse for these AI. There is just so much nonsense written in English online, maybe a lot more as a % compared to the other languages.</p>
<p>I very much look forward to reading some studies done by someone smarter than me in the future. It's a fascinating topic.</p>                <hr>

## US official, Chinese counterpart holds talks amid effort to avert unintended conflict

date: 2024-05-30, from: VOA News USA

STATE DEPARTMENT — Deputy U.S. Secretary of State Kurt Campbell is hosting China’s Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu in Washington on Thursday. The talks are aimed at maintaining open communication channels to prevent miscalculations and unintended conflicts, especially during times of tension.


Following two hours of face-to-face discussions, officials from the United States and the People's Republic of China will have a working lunch at the State Department. Later in the afternoon, U.S. Deputy National Security Adviser Jon Finer will continue discussions with Ma.


The visit by Ma Zhaoxu follows U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s trip to Shanghai and Beijing in April. Officials said it builds on U.S.’s intensive diplomacy with the PRC to responsibly manage competition in the relationship, even in areas where the two countries disagree.  


“As we continue to take actions to protect our interests and values and those of our allies and partners, we are also using face-to-face diplomacy with the PRC to clearly and directly communicate our positions and intentions, and make progress on bilateral, regional, and global issues that matter to the American people and the world,” a State Department spokesperson told VOA.  


A spokesperson from PRC’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Ma will also “interact and communicate with representatives from various sectors in the U.S.” during his visit to the U.S. from May 30 to June 2.


While in Beijing last month, Blinken voiced "serious concern" regarding China's support for Russia's defense industry, warning Chinese leaders that Washington could impose sanctions over the matter.


China has defended its approach to Russia, saying it is only engaged in normal economic exchanges with a major trading partner. 


Wednesday, Campbell renewed the U.S. warnings. He said Chinese support was helping to revitalize Russia's military capabilities, including long-range missiles, artillery, drones and battlefield tracking.


During his visit to Brussels, the State Department's second-highest diplomat emphasized the urgent need for European and NATO countries "to send a collective message of concern to China about its actions, which we view are destabilizing in the heart of Europe."


The latest U.S.-China talks occur just days after China conducted a large-scale, two-day military exercise involving 111 aircraft and 46 naval vessels around Taiwan. Washington has strongly urged Beijing to exercise restraint and has reaffirmed the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.


U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for China and Taiwan Mark Lambert met virtually with PRC’s Director-General for Boundary and Ocean Affairs Hong Liang on May 23.  During this meeting, Lambert expressed profound concerns regarding People’s Liberation Army joint military drills in the Taiwan Strait and around Taiwan.

Microsoft and Google are putting AI chat into all their apps everywhere you can enter text, which imho is as pointless as embedding web browsers in all of the Office apps in 1994. ChatGPT is the Netscape of this generation. Compete with that, create the best environment for the kind of work we do there. That’s the game, from a UI standpoint.

## First Ukrainian pilots graduate from F-16 training in US

date: 2024-05-30, from: VOA News USA

the Pentagon   — The first Ukrainian pilots have completed F-16 fighter jet training at a military base in Arizona, with others soon to follow this summer.


"The first batch has graduated, and other Ukrainian pilots are finishing their training here by the end of August," Arizona National Guard spokesperson Capt. Erin Hannigan told VOA.


The graduates include a handful of Ukrainian pilots who had trained at Morris Air National Guard Base in Tucson, according to a U.S. official who spoke to VOA on condition of anonymity because of security sensitivities.


Out of an abundance of caution for the pilots’ safety, officials declined to provide an exact number of how many had graduated or the number of those who remain in F-16 training.


The 162nd Wing at Morris is considered the Air National Guard’s premier F-16 training unit and houses the Air Force’s only school dedicated to training pilots from more than 20 countries on the fighter.


Kyiv pleaded for Western aircraft when Russia launched its full-scale invasion of their country in February 2022. In August 2023, U.S. President Joe Biden approved a plan for Western allies to send F-16s to Ukraine once pilot training was complete.


Last August, Ukraine was gaining momentum in the conflict against Russia, but that was before a monthslong delay by Congress to approve new military assistance for Kyiv.


Since then, Ukrainian officials reported that troops were forced to ration supplies as ammunition ran low. Analysts say Russia has capitalized on Kyiv’s disadvantage to make gains on the battlefield.


Last month, Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo said his country's promised jets would be delivered to Kyiv by the end of the year.
