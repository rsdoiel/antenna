## Mocking Haley’s name is latest race-based attack from Trump

date: 2024-01-19, from: San Jose Mercury News

"That's what he does when he feels threatened. That's what he does when he feels insecure," Haley told reporters in New Hampshire on Friday when asked about Trump's false assertions that her heritage disqualifies her from the Oval Office. "I know that I am a threat. I know that's why he's doing that. So it's not going to waste any energy for me."

## US Citizens Named in Jimmy Lai Trial Deny Allegations: 'Just Journalism'

date: 2024-01-19, from: VOA News USA

LONDON — The names of two U.S. citizens came up in the trial of Apple Daily founder Jimmy Lai in Hong Kong this week as the prosecution brought forward its first witness in the landmark national security case.


Lai has been charged with “conspiracy to collude with foreign forces” under the Hong Kong National Security Law, among other crimes.


Lai has pleaded not guilty. Following this week’s testimony from a former colleague at the newspaper, the two Americans named, Mark Simon and Mark Clifford, said the allegations that came up in testimony were just normal journalistic work.


In court on Wednesday, Cheung Kim-hung, the former publisher of Apple Daily, appeared as an “accomplice witness.” In his testimony, Cheung said that Lai sought out writers for the popular, now-defunct tabloid through introductions from Simon, his personal assistant, and Clifford, a former director of the newspaper’s parent company, Next Digital.


Simon told VOA Cantonese that he has written English columns for publications owned by Next Digital for more than 10 years and has also invited others to write opinion pieces for Apple Daily, including two Nobel Prize winners in economics, Vernon L. Smith and “father of the euro” Robert Mundell.


“It wasn’t uncommon. it’s basically journalism. I mean, that’s what it is, it’s basically journalism management,” he told VOA Cantonese. “I don't really know where they [the prosecution] are going with this. It seems to me like, the issue is a newspaper being a newspaper.”




Simon said he first met Cheung in 2001 and considered him a friend.


“The human tragedy here of a man being turned against his friend and his boss, it’s horrific to see,” Simon said. “I mean this is very painful for a lot of people to watch. And so, it's a tragedy to watch. With the system, you know, he cut a deal, and I guess he’s saying what he’s going to say.”


When the prosecution made its opening statement for the trial, it said Lai had a broad international network and named many foreign political and business figures who had contact or links with him. Simon was one of those named as a “co-conspirator.”


The prosecution also mentioned Clifford, saying that he attended Lai's online talk show in October 2020 that discussed Washington’s sale of weapons to Taiwan.


Clifford, who is currently the president of the Committee for Freedom in Hong Kong Foundation, issued a statement acknowledging that he helped find writers for Apple Daily.


“Yes, I, too, plead guilty of practicing journalism. However, it was Kim-hung and his colleagues, working with Jimmy, who deserve the accolades for everything they did to advance the cause of freedom and democracy in Hong Kong in the 26 years they ran the city’s most important newspaper,” wrote Clifford.


Clifford said that there was nothing in Cheung’s testimony that suggested Lai broke the law. He added that Lai was only advocating for freedom and democracy, which was promised by China under the Basic Law, the de facto constitution that governs the territory.


Clifford said he did not feel anger but “immense sorrow” at Cheung's testimony. He said Lai and other defendants should be released immediately.


“Kim-hung and five colleagues have been held as hostages almost three years, since authorities forced Apple Daily to shut in mid-2021. They have pled guilty but remain behind bars, denied bail, so that they can be used as bit players in the ongoing show trial against Jimmy Lai,” he wrote. “None of us know how we would react if put under the sort of strain that Kim-hung and others have endured.


“We all like to think we would be as brave and honorable in sticking to our principles as Jimmy Lai has been. Thankfully, most of us will never be tested like this.”


Britain and the United States have called for Lai’s release and said the case is politically motivated. Hong Kong officials say Lai will receive a fair trial.




Following massive public protests in 2019, authorities in China set up a National Security Law for Hong Kong in a bid to restore stability. The law punishes acts of subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life imprisonment, a penalty Lai could face if found guilty.


Lai’s trial began on December 18 and is being overseen by three judges: Esther Toh, Susana Maria D’Almada Remedios and Alex Lee. There is no jury.


Cheung has also been charged with “conspiracy to collude with foreign forces.” He pled guilty with five other defendants in November 2022. Mitigation and sentencing for the six will be conducted after Lai's trial.


When the six pled guilty, the International Federation of Journalists issued a statement condemning the “arbitrary legal persecution” of Apple Daily staff and urged Hong Kong authorities to drop all charges against the media workers immediately.


Aleksandra Bielakowska, Asia-Pacific Bureau Advocacy Officer for Reporters Without Borders, told VOA Cantonese that the latest developments in the case against Lai are deeply worrying and further demonstrate the spurious nature of charges against the Apple Daily founder.


“Targeting human rights defenders in other parts of the world as ‘co-conspirators’ for simply doing their jobs, and now having on stand witnesses who have been held hostage in jail for more than three years, is showing the true extent of the arbitrariness of proceedings Lai is facing,” she said.


“Cheung Kim-hung has been held in custody together with his Apple Daily colleagues simply as the hostages that are being used against Jimmy Lai. Cheung and other detained media staff have been put through an ordeal which is hard to imagine and that none should ever endure.”


Bielakowska said that recent developments in the trial show how China will do anything in its power to crush press freedom in Hong Kong.


“It is not Jimmy Lai as an individual on the trial, it is his media, journalists and press freedom, a principle that shouldn't be crushed but protected as enshrined in the Basic Law,” she said.

<p>The Apple Vision Pro is Apple&#8217;s first standalone device in a completely new product category since the company launched the iPad in 2010. So it&#8217;s not surprising that when Apple first unveiled its first &#8220;spatial computing&#8221; device, the focus was more on experiences than tech specs. But now that the Apple Vision Pro is up [&#8230;]</p>

## Pluralistic: 2600's amazing Hackers on Planet Earth con may go down to enshittification (19 Jan 2024)

date: 2024-01-19, from: Cory Doctorow's blog

Today's links 2600's amazing Hackers on Planet Earth con may go down to enshittification: Remember, hacking is more than just a crime: it's a survival trait. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2014 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading 2600's amazing Hackers on Planet Earth con may go down to enshittification (permalink) It's been 40 years since Emmanuel Goldstein launched the seminal, essential, world-changing 2600: The Hacker Quarterly. 2600 wasn't the first phreak/hacker zine, but it was the most important, spawning a global subculture dedicated to the noble pursuit of technological self-determination: https://www.2600.com/ 2600 has published hundreds of issues in which digital spelunkers report eagerly on the things they've discovered by peering intently at the things no one was supposed to even glance at (I'm proud to be one of those writers!). They've fought legal battles, including one that almost went to the Supreme Court: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeCSS They created a global network of meetups where some of technology's most durable friendships and important collaborations were born. These continue to this day: https://www.2600.com/meetings And they've hosted a weekly radio show on NYC's WBAI, Off the Hook: https://wbai.org/program.php?program=76 When WBAI management lost their minds and locked the station's most beloved hosts out of the studio, Off the Hook (naturally) led the rebellion, taking back the station for its audience, rescuing it from a managerial coup: https://twitter.com/2600/status/1181423565389942786 But best of all, 2600 gave us HOPE &#8211; both in the metaphorical sense of "hope for a better technological tomorrow" and in the literal sense, with its biannual Hackers On Planet Earth con: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers_on_Planet_Earth For decades HOPE had an incredible venue, the Hotel Pennsylvania (memorialized in the phreak anthem "PEnnsylvania 6-5000"), a crumbling pile in midtown Manhattan that was biannually transformed into a rollicking, multi-day festival of forbidden technology, improbable feats, and incredible presentations. I was privileged to keynote HOPE in 2016: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1D7APjmVbk But after the 2018 HOPE, the Hotel Pennsylvania was demolished to make way for the Penn15 (no, really) skyscraper, a vaporware mega-tower planned as a holding pen for luxury shopping and empty million-dollar condos sold to offshore war-criminals as safe-deposit boxes in the sky. The developer, Vornado (no, really) hasn't actually done all that &#8211; after demo'ing the Hotel Pennsylvania, they noped out, leave a large, unusable scar across midtown. But HOPE wasn't lost. In 2022, the ever-resilient 2600 crew relocated to Queens, hosted by St John's University &#8211; a venue that was less glamorous that the Hotel Pennsylvania, but the event was still fantastic. Attendance fell from 2,000 to 1,000, but that was something they could work with, and reviews from attendees were stellar. Good thing, too. 2600 is, first and foremost, a magazine publisher, and these have been hard years for magazines. First there was the mass die-off of indie bookstores and newsracks (I used to sell 2600 when I was a bookseller, and in the years after, I always took the presence of 2600 on a store's newsrack as an unimpeachable mark of quality). Thankfully for 2600, their audience is (unsurprisingly) a tech-savvy one, so they were able to substitute digital subscriptions for physical ones: https://www.2600.com/Magazine/DigitalEditions Of course, many of those subscriptions came through Amazon's Kindle, because nerds were early Amazon adopters, and because the Kindle magazine publishing platform offered DRM-free distribution to subscribers along with a fair payout to publishers. But then Amazon enshittified its magazine system. Having locked publishers to its platform, it rugged them and killed the monthly subscription fees that allowed publishers to plan for a steady output. Publishers were given a choice: leave Amazon (and all the readers locked inside its walled garden) or put your magazine into the Kindle Unlimited system: https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/arp/B0BWPTCP4K?deviceType=A1FG5NAKX0MRJL Kindle Unlimited is an all-you-can-eat program for Kindle, which pays publishers and writers based on a system that is both opaque and easily gamed, with the lion's share of the money going to "publishers" who focus on figuring out how to cheat the algorithm. Revenues for 2600 &#8211; and all the other magazines that Amazon had sucked in and sucked dry &#8211; fell off a cliff. Which brings me to the present moment. After 40 years, 2600 is still at it, having survived the bookstorepocalypse, the lunacy of public radio management, the literal demolition of their physical home by an evil real-estate developer, and Amazon's crooked accounting. This is 2600, circa 2024, and 2024 a HOPE year: https://www.hope.net/ Once again, HOPE has been scheduled for its new digs in Queens, July 12-14. Last week, HOPE sent out an email blast to their subscribers telling them the news. They expected to sell 500 tickets in the first 24 hours. They didn't even come close: https://www.2600.com/content/hope-ticket-sales-update It turns out that Google and the other major mail providers don't like emails with the word "hacker" in them. The cartel that decides which email gets delivered, and which messages go to spam, or get blocked altogether, mass-blocked the HOPE 2024 announcement. Email may be the last federated, open platform we have, but mass concentration has created a system where it's nearly impossible to get your email delivered unless you're willing to play by Gmail's rules: https://pluralistic.net/2021/10/10/dead-letters/ For Emmanuel Goldstein, founder of 2600 and tireless toiler for this community, the deafening silence following from that initial email volley was terrifying: "like some kind of a "Twilight Zone" episode where everyone has disappeared." The enshittification that keeps 2600's emails from being delivered to the people who asked to receive them is even worse on social media. Social media companies routinely defraud their users by letting them subscribe to feeds, then turning around to the people and organizations that run those feeds and saying, "You've got x thousand subscribers on this platform, but we won't put your posts in their feeds unless you pay us to 'boost' your content": https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/04/platforms-decay-lets-put-users-first Enshittification has been coming at 2600 for decades. Like other forms of oddball media dedicated to challenging corporate power and government oppression, 2600 has always been a ten-years-ahead preview of the way the noose was gonna tighten on all of us. And now, they're on the ropes. HOPE can't sell tickets unless people know about HOPE, and neither email providers nor social media platforms have any interest in making that happen. A handful of giant corporations now get to decide what we read, who we hear from, and whether and how we can get together in person to make friends, forge community, rabble-rouse and change the world. The idea that "it's not censorship unless the government does it" has always been wrong (not all censorship violates the First Amendment, and censorship can be real without being unconstitutional): https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/04/yes-its-censorship/ What can you do about it? Well, for one thing, you can sign up for HOPE. It's gonna be great. They've got sub-$100 hotel rooms! In New York City! https://store.2600.com/products/tickets-to-hope-xv If you can't make it to HOPE, you can sign up for a virtual membership: https://store.2600.com/products/tickets-to-hope-xv-virtual-attendee You can submit a talk to HOPE: https://www.hope.net/cfp.html You can subscribe to 2600, in print or electronically (I signed up for the lifetime print subscription and it was a bargain &#8211; I devour every issue the day it arrives): https://store.2600.com/collections/subscriptions-renewals 2600 is living a decade in the future of every other community you care about, weird hobby you enjoy, con you live for, and publication you read from cover to cover. If we can all pull together to save it, it'll be a beacon of hope (and HOPE).

## What’s come out of Davos?

date: 2024-01-19, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>Today, the World Economic Forum is wrapping up in Davos, Switzerland. There, meetings have been held between company heads and global leaders. Key themes include artificial intelligence, increasingly complicated relationships between world powers and prospects of another potential Donald Trump administration. We&#8217;ll outline the results of some of these meetings. But first, how are consumers feeling? A lot of it has to do with how they&#8217;re doing relative to inflation.</p>

## Why Teslas crash more than gas-powered cars

date: 2024-01-19, from: San Jose Mercury News

Hertz recently announced it was selling 20,000 electric cars out of its fleet, and replacing them with gasoline vehicles. One reason the company gave was that drivers kept crashing the cars.

## A New Sculpture Garden in Miami Built to Withstand Heat and Floods

date: 2024-01-19, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTA3MjAyOC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1Mzg1NDA0NH0.QEt5wsy3mvTIUcqlyBY8Ro0b6X-Ss3WsiVuw6ZcKbbc/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">
	The Underline in Miami is a 10-mile trail that will, over the next few years, repurpose 120 acres of unused land into an urban mobility corridor for pedestrians, dogs, bikers, and skateboarders. The route runs under the Metrorail rapid transit tracks from the financial district at the northernmost end all the way south to Dadeland. It’s New York’s Highline at ground level.
</p><p>
	For now, only the half-mile-long Phase 1 is complete; the 2-plus-mile Phase 2 will be finished by this spring, and the remaining leg by 2026. Phase 1 begins at a green space called Brickell Backyard near the Miami River in the Brickell District and includes a sculpture garden designed by Miami-based mixed-media artist Typoe Gran.
</p><p>
	I caught up with Gran last month at the Art Basel fair in Miami, where he was celebrating the launch of a permanent chandelier-inspired installation at the Rimowa store in Miami’s Design District. I am inspired by the joy and playfulness in his work, which is rare in climate design.
</p><p>
	We talked about his inspiration for the Sculpture Garden and the unique challenges of designing a permanent, durable play park that can also withstand extreme weather conditions in Miami. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.
</p><p>
<strong>What is your approach to design at Primary, your gallery in Miami?</strong>
</p><p>
	My partners, Cristina Gonzalez and Books Bischof, and I started Primary in 2007, and it began as a public art project in Miami’s Wynwood neighborhood. I have always been fascinated by Friedrich Fröbel who created kindergarten and children’s building blocks. My work often involves creating larger-than-life sculptures and murals that remind us of the importance of play and experimentation.
</p><p>
<strong>How did you get connected to the Underline Sculpture Garden project?</strong>
</p><p>
	The Underline project was really cool because I knew the curator and there was a great team with such an accumulation of knowledge working on how to build it and create beautiful areas for people to come together.
</p><p>
	Our pitch was to build a space where people can play, connect, grow, and be inspired to use their imagination. The most important thing was igniting their imagination. I arrived to the Underline team with an already-funded idea and got it greenlit from the beginning.
</p><p>
<strong>What was your approach to designing the Sculpture Garden?</strong>
</p><p>
	I looked at multiple sites along the beginning of the path, and the area I chose was the densest in terms of people walking around, which was exciting to me. I wanted a spot where there would be people. It was also located at a position where the train line split a gentrified area with luxury brands and a super mall on one side, with a rougher area on the other side. I liked being the connector of these areas.
</p><p>
	It was also the saddest-looking area! Dead plants, nothing there, with just a pathway through it. It was underneath the Metrorail, so it would offer protection from sun — you could still play and it wouldn’t be blistering hot, and you’d be shielded from rain. This was a beautiful start because the area was underutilized and I had to figure out how to make it a destination.
</p><p>
<strong>Tell me about your design approach to the location.</strong>
</p><p>
	What we designed is not officially a playground but a sculpture garden, with benches and big sculptures you can look at that are playful and reference adolescent activity.
</p><p>
	The material we used is important because of the environment. The sun is hot. There is a small amount of salt water in the air, and that affects metals and paints on metals — we didn’t want to deal with rust, plus metal gets hot. So, we thought it would be cool to make fiberglass sculptures — what we make boats out of. Fiberglass offers a lighter load and is simple to install. Also, it looks clean and shiny and doesn’t get too hot, so kids can touch and play on it and it’s safe — there are no sharp edges and no one gets hurt. We sloped the concrete so when it rains, the water runs into the plants. It’s just a slight tilt and not noticeable to the naked eye.
</p><p>
<strong>Your Habitable score for the Sculpture Park shows <a href="https://habitableliving.com/climatecheck/25.7579226/-80.3789563/SW%2010th%20Street%20and%20Southwest%2011th%20Street,%20Miami,%20Florida%2033199,%20United%20States/us" target="_blank">extreme flood and heat risk</a>. Were you aware of this when you built the park? What decisions did you have to make?</strong>
</p><p>
	I have never seen it underwater. That zone is still slightly higher than the street, and again, we tilted the path so that the water slides off into the planter areas.
</p><p>
	[It was] tricky because there is not a full-time irrigation system throughout the Underline and we had to be specific about choosing plants that could last without watering. We used temporary sprinklers to get the plants established and then rely on native plants that would thrive without a lot of watering.
</p><p>
<strong>How does the park perform? Has it had to withstand a hurricane yet?</strong>
</p><p>
	This sculpture garden has been alive only for a year, so it hasn’t lived through a hurricane yet. But I’ve gone there a lot and it’s cool to see people eating lunch, taking work breaks and taking pictures.
</p><p>
	Early on, I would’ve thought it would be a place for kids to play. But I’ll see an elderly man taking selfies with the sculptures. It makes me happy that their imagination is going and my sculptures and park are in conversation with people.
</p><p>
<strong>Is there anything you would’ve done differently?</strong>
</p><p>
	It all turned out, luckily, exactly how I had hoped. And of course, now I have ideas for more parks. Next, I want to do a really big one! I’m in talks with multiple cities and countries to figure out where the next park will be.
</p><p>
<strong>What are your three top takeaways for park designers?</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>1. </strong>Before I even thought about what I was going to do, I had to think about the landscape. It was partial shade, heat, salt water, flooding. I had to take all of that into consideration.The fiberglass sculptures had to be engineered and rated for hurricanes and engineered with metal plates so that we can unbolt from a side hatch and easily move [them], but [also] will never move during a storm — the last thing we want is a sculpture flying into someone’s house. We had to have an engineer design for all possible weather conditions.
</p><p>
<strong>2. </strong>Design for the world we are living in, not the one we wish we were living in. You have to consider the human element: Are people going to try to sleep in my park? Or is it a place where everyone tries to skate on it?
</p><p>
<strong>3. </strong>Graffiti! We had to put a special clear coat on all the surfaces so the graffiti could be taken off. You have to expand your mind to consider every type of human being who is going to be in the park and accept it — whatever can happen might. You have to prepare for the worst. People are going to write, sleep and skate all over it, so design for it!

## Tesla Model Y was Europe’s best-selling car in 2023, the first EV to take top spot

date: 2024-01-19, from: Electrek Feed

While the Model Y had taken the spot for a few months last year, year-end results were a close call with a very different vehicle: the ubiquitous ICE hatchback Dacia Sandero, tightly priced at $13,051 (€12,000).</p>

## Serving Oddµ via a socket

date: 2024-01-19, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1>Serving Oddµ via a socket</h1>

<p>Recently, <a href="http://the-brannons.com/">Chris Brannon</a> sent me a patch for <a href="Odd%C2%B5">Oddµ</a> that allowed it to listen at a Unix-domain socket instead of a host and port.</p>

<p>I decided to investigate since I don&rsquo;t know anything about sockets. If you see something that can be improved, let me know.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to use systemd, but for my user.</p>

<p>I have two files, one for the socket and one for the service. These are not the same files as the ones provided with the Oddµ sources. Those are intended to be used together with a web server that acts as a reverse proxy. These files are for me testing the installation using netcat and curl.</p>

<h2>Socket</h2>

<p>Make sure the directory for the socket exists:</p>

<pre><code>mkdir --parents /home/alex/.local/run/oddmu
</code></pre>

<p>This is the file &ldquo;oddmu-unix-domain.socket&rdquo;:</p>

<pre><code>[Unit]
Description=Oddmu server socket
[Socket]
ListenStream=/home/alex/.local/run/oddmu/oddmu.sock
Accept=no
[Install]
WantedBy=sockets.target
</code></pre>

<p>Enable and start it:</p>

<pre><code>systemctl --user enable ./oddmu-unix-domain.socket
systemctl --user start oddmu-unix-domain.socket
</code></pre>

<h2>Service</h2>

<p>Make sure the directory for the wiki exists and copy the template files:</p>

<pre><code>mkdir --parents /home/alex/.local/share/oddmu
cp *.html /home/alex/.local/share/oddmu
</code></pre>

<p>This is the file &ldquo;oddmu-unix-domain.service&rdquo;:</p>

<pre><code>[Unit]
Description=Oddmu
After=network.target
Requires=oddmu-unix-domain.socket
[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=always
StandardInput=socket
StandardOutput=journal
StandardError=journal
ExecStart=/home/alex/src/oddmu/oddmu
WorkingDirectory=/home/alex/.local/share/oddmu
Environment=&quot;ODDMU_WEBFINGER=1&quot;
Environment=&quot;ODDMU_LANGUAGES=de,en&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>This doesn&rsquo;t limit a lot of capabilities, but I guess I trust my own code.</p>

<p>Install it:</p>

<pre><code>systemctl --user enable ./oddmu-unix-domain.service
systemctl --user start oddmu-unix-domain.service
</code></pre>

<h2>Test</h2>

<p>Check the journal:</p>

<pre><code>journalctl --user --follow --unit oddmu-unix-domain
</code></pre>

<p>Do some requests using netcat:</p>

<pre><code>echo -e &quot;GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: localhost\r\n\r\n&quot; \
  | ncat --unixsock ~/.local/run/oddmu/oddmu.sock
echo -e &quot;GET /view/index HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: localhost\r\n\r\n&quot; \
  | ncat --unixsock ~/.local/run/oddmu/oddmu.sock
echo -e &quot;GET /edit/index HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: localhost\r\n\r\n&quot; \
  | ncat --unixsock ~/.local/run/oddmu/oddmu.sock
</code></pre>

<p>Using curl:</p>

<pre><code>curl --unix-socket ~/.local/run/oddmu/oddmu.sock \
  http://localhost/edit/index
curl --unix-socket ~/.local/run/oddmu/oddmu.sock \
  --form body=&quot;Hello!&quot; http://localhost/save/index
curl --unix-socket ~/.local/run/oddmu/oddmu.sock \
  http://localhost/view/index
</code></pre>

<h2>What now?</h2>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m going to change my web server setup. But using sockets and <code>systemctl --user</code> has been interesting.</p>

<p>Thank you, Chris Brannon, for sending that patch!</p>

## 2024 Could Be a Very Bad Year for Emissions

date: 2024-01-19, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDM0MDAwMC9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2ODQzODE2Nn0.7qLtGHwtvJDuHPOt-W4Ue-pqu3d_1ggV3S7sxzg1utg/image.png?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C1%2C0%2C1"/><br/><br/><p>
<em><strong>Current conditions: </strong>Parts of Western Australia could see temperatures as high as 122 degrees Fahrenheit • Floods are forcing some U.K. supermarkets to sell smaller vegetables • Americans are bracing for another arctic blast.</em>
</p><h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2><h3>
	1. CO2 emissions could exceed 1.5 Celsius warming threshold this year
</h3><p>
<strong></strong>2024 is expected to be a record year for carbon dioxide emissions, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=1241d302dc&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">according to</a> the U.K.’s Met Office. The emissions increase could push atmospheric CO2 levels beyond the threshold for limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Driving the surge in emissions is the continued use of fossil fuels, plus the El Niño weather pattern. But even without El Niño, “human-induced emissions would still cause the CO2 rise in 2024 to be on the absolute limits of compliance with the 1.5°C pathways,” said the Met Office’s Richard Betts. Scientists say surpassing 1.5 degrees in warming could trigger tipping points and irreversibly alter the global climate system.

</p><h3>2. IEA says global oil demand will grow more than expected </h3><p>
<strong></strong>Global demand for oil will grow this year by about 1.2 million barrels per day, the International Energy Agency (IEA) <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=34e1580a8c&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">forecast</a> in its January Oil Market Report. That’s a slight increase on the 1.1 million BPD growth the IEA forecast last month, and the third consecutive upward revision. However it’s still much lower than 2023’s demand growth, as well as <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=6f008e5cef&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">projections</a> put out by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). The IEA said rising popularity of electric vehicles, plus improvements in energy efficiency, is curbing oil usage overall, but economic growth across the world, combined with lower crude prices, is buoying demand in the short term. The agency predicts that oil demand will peak by 2030.
</p><h3>3. The Pentagon is going solar</h3><p>
<strong></strong>The Department of Defense will <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=8c4f13c232&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">install</a> rooftop solar panels at the Pentagon, as well as a heat pump system for space heating and solar thermal panels for water heating. Alongside reducing fossil fuel usage, the upgrades could save the Pentagon $1.36 million per year. And the solar panels offer a more secure power source, just in the case there’s a grid outage or cyberattack, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=8f5128aa2e&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> Brendan Owens, assistant secretary of defense for energy. The Pentagon is one of 31 federal buildings getting grants from the Department of Energy to make their facilities more energy efficient.

<strong></strong>In more solar news: The Biden administration this week identified 22 million acres of federal land across 11 states it thinks could be used for solar development. The draft plan expands on an existing Obama-era policy, the Western Solar Plan, that originally pinpointed areas in six states – Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah – for their solar potential. The updated roadmap adds Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington, and Wyoming to the mix, focuses specifically on areas within 10 miles of planned or existing transmission lines, and steers away from sensitive habitats, historic land, and old growth forests, <em>Reuters</em> <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=efdb3543a2&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>. Of course not all of this land will be used for solar development, but the Bureau of Land Management wants to have “maximum flexibility” when working to meet President Biden’s goal of decarbonizing the U.S. power grid by 2035.

	5. Uber and Lyft drivers reportedly clogging EV charging stations
</h3><p>
<strong></strong>A bunch of Uber and Lyft drivers who recently switched to Teslas are reportedly overwhelming electric vehicle charging stations in several major cities. This week’s severe cold snap prompted tales of dead Tesla batteries in frigid Chicago, but <em>Inside EVs</em> <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=8ca357cf4b&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">claimed</a> that the city’s “massive EV ridesharing fleet” exacerbated things by hogging charging stations: “Since most of these cars are rented out in an already-cold state and then often driven slowly and on very short trips, these cars never warm up sufficiently. Add in the fact that most Uber/Lyft drivers likely know next to nothing about EVs and preconditioning and you can begin to see why they contributed significantly to the charging issue in Chicago.”<br/>

This triggered a run on Teslas by Uber drivers. Now customers staring down long lines at charging stations have taken to X to appeal to Elon Musk for help:

## When cold weather and EVs don’t mix

date: 2024-01-19, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>With much of the country frozen right now, some EV owners are going through their first frigid winter and finding that their cars don&#8217;t like the cold either. Turns out, EVs tend to lose range and take longer to charge when it&#8217;s colder outside. We&#8217;ll examine. Plus, Congress approves their third stopgap funding measure in four months, and we look at the factors that could keep a lid on home prices.</p>

<blockquote><p>Last spring, a friend of a friend visited my office and invited me to Langley to speak to Invisible Ink, the CIA&#8217;s creative writing group.</p>
<p>I asked Vivian (not her real name) what she wanted me to talk about.</p>
<p>She said that the topic of the talk was entirely up to me.</p>
<p>I asked what level the writers in the group were.</p>
<p>She said the group had writers of all levels.</p>
<p>I asked what the speaking fee was.</p>
<p>She said that as far as she knew, there was no speaking fee.</p></blockquote>
<p>What I want to know is, why haven&#8217;t I been invited? There are nonfiction writers in that group...</p>

## P&B: Tom MacWright

date: 2024-01-19, from: Manu - I write blog

<p>This is the 21st edition of <em>People and Blogs</em>, the series where I ask interesting people to talk about themselves and their blogs. Today we have Tom MacWright and his blog, <a href="https://macwright.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">macwright.com</a></p>
<p>Tom is an American programmer, with a very minimal blog—something I really appreciate—and he's currently working on <a href="https://www.val.town" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Val.town</a>, a social website to code in the cloud.</p>
<p>To follow this series <a href="https://peopleandblogs.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">subscribe to the newsletter</a>. A new interview will land in your inbox every Friday. Not a fan of newsletters? No problem! You can read the interviews here on the blog or you can subscribe to the <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/feed">RSS feed</a>.</p>
<hr />
<div class="q"><p><strong>Let&#039;s start from the basics: can you introduce yourself?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>Hi! I'm from New Jersey and I live in Brooklyn now. I studied Computer Science in college a lot time ago, and that led to a series of jobs at early-stage startups: I've worked on CAD software extensions, visualization tools, geospatial software, and programming tools. It can be a little hectic, the urgency to get these companies from point A to B, but I like it.</p>
<p>I've always had a lot of hobbies, and have kept most of them. Guitar, banjo, running, art, writing, gardening, hardware projects: having a few things to do is pretty important to me. The creative energy from one project can spill over to another, and you can get a fresh perspective by taking a break from some long-running task.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>What&#039;s the story behind your blog?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>When I started writing online in 2010, there were a lot of people leading the way. I remember <a href="http://simplebits.com/blog/">SimpleBits</a> and <a href="https://kottke.org/">kottke</a>, <a href="http://artypapers.com/">Rebekah Cox</a> and David Heinemeier Hansson. <a href="https://rsms.me/">Rasmus Andersson</a> had a perfect look for his blog that heavily influenced mine. One of my earliest jobs, working at a company called <a href="https://developmentseed.org/">Development Seed</a>, encouraged us all to write. Bonnie Bogle, one of the founders, had worked professionally as a writer and helped a lot with editing and taught us all how to write for the web.</p>
<p>I write to think, so I do it all the time and not just for the blog. I keep paper journals. I like that quote on the back of all my <a href="https://fieldnotesbrand.com/">Field Notes</a> notebooks: "I’m not writing it down to remember it later, I’m writing it down to remember it now."</p>
<p>For the current blog, I'm kind of proud of how little it's changed. It's so easy to just chase the latest blog software or design, but with my current blog I've been able to really restrain myself. I like the design and the technology just works. The content has definitely changed as what I've worked on shifted. There's usually some writing that's work-related, some that's about what I'm interested in now. I've added sections for photos and book reviews.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>What does your creative process look like when it comes to blogging?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>I don't have a process for getting inspired or finding topics to write about. I just write about what I'm interested in and what I think is fun to share. So sometimes months go by without finishing anything, and sometimes it's four posts in a month.</p>
<p>It's scary when the inspiration doesn't come. Right now is one of those times: it's been three months since I wrote a standalone blog post. But I write one a month, always called "Recently," which is there to keep a cadence. The Recently posts have a consistent structure and are less of a commitment to write - I think they've helped me keep the habit through all these years.</p>
<p>I don't have anyone proofread my drafts. I make grammar and spelling mistakes all the time, and would probably benefit from an editor, but it's a solo operation, for better or worse.</p>
<p>I don't write outlines. Sometimes I'll write multiple drafts when I can't figure out which part of the topic is really interesting. I'll write long blog posts just to find the 25% that's actually good, and I'll keep just that part.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe the physical space influences your creativity?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>I'm either incredibly neat in my own space, with everything on the table arranged at right angles, or writing on a laptop at a chaotic cafe. If I'm listening to anything when I'm writing, it's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Hecker">Tim Hecker</a>.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your tech stack?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>Sure! It's simple. The blog is generated by <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, stored on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> and hosted on <a href="https://netlify.com/">Netlify</a>. I recently switched to using Cloudflare as my domain registrar – really happy with them so far. I also used Cloudflare to store photos, with their R2 service. I also have my own email address on the site, using Fastmail, which is fantastic.</p>
<p>And that's really it – it's a static site. I've made small changes to the tech stack like switching from GitHub Pages to Netlify and from Gandi to Cloudflare. But overall, I've used simple tools to make something simple and it has been unproblematic.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would you do anything differently?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>Not really: I like how I have it set up. Maybe I'd use Hugo or Eleventy instead of Jekyll, just because it's annoying to set up Ruby on new computers. But Jekyll has been great otherwise.</p>
<p>It's easy to overcomplicate these things.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>Financial question since the web is obsessed with money: how much does it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost or does it generate some revenue? And what&#039;s your position on people monetising personal blogs?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>The domain costs about $20 a year. Hosting images on Cloudflare R2 costs a few cents a month. Fastmail costs $5 a month.</p>
<p>Thanks to Brooklyn rents, these numbers are relatively insignificant to me.</p>
<p>I've tried a few things to monetize it: affiliate links, hooking up the Brave Browser's advertising system, and a ko-fi.com link for donations.</p>
<p>I also sell the blog's theme for $100, because people kept asking for it. But, I try to make it clear that if you just want to recreate it on your own or rip off design elements, be my guest, don't pay me!</p>
<p>I shut down the Brave advertising setup, which paid me in BAT tokens, because the annoyance of accounting for "crypto income" outweighed the income itself. I don't use affiliate links anymore – they were always a paltry income.</p>
<p>For me, I've had a relatively comfortable career in the tech industry. The most value that my blog has provided me is job flexibility and exposure. I feel awkward about the prospect of monetizing my audience and I have the luxury not to do so.</p>
<p>But that's not a universal experience at all, and I think it's totally cool and fair for anyone to monetize their blog. Some people have done really well that way!</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth checking out? And also, who do you think I should be interviewing next?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>I read enough tech stuff at work, so I don't really need programming blogs. I have a few RSS subscriptions that I still treasure: <a href="https://www.cycfi.com/">Cycfi Research</a> is from a company that is building wild MIDI-compatible guitars out of carbon fiber. <a href="https://zeptobars.com/en/">Zeptobars</a> is a very focused blog that posts die shots - images of chips after the coating has been etched away. <a href="https://drewdevault.com/">Drew DeVault’s blog</a> is software engineering feats of strength and some very strong opinions. <a href="https://www.lightbluetouchpaper.org/">Light Blue Touchpaper</a> always has some post about a mind-blowing security vulnerability. <a href="https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/">Language Log</a> has wild language-crossover examples. And of course there's <a href="https://100r.co/site/log.html">100 Rabbits</a> posting about their art, programming, music, and boat adventures.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>Final question: is there anything you want to share with us?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>Right now I'm spending a lot of time on <a href="https://www.val.town/">Val Town</a>, so check that out!</p></div>

## Thomas Oatway | The Worst Mistake We’ve Made

## Bezos promised $100 million after Maui wildfire but no one knows where it’s going

date: 2024-01-19, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>Jeff Bezos has a habit of issuing splashy philanthropic promises while offering few details. The latest: a $100 million pledge to help rebuild Maui after August&#8217;s devastating wildfires. Bezos and fianc&#0233;e Lauren Sanchez have given $15.5 million over the past five months through the Bezos Maui Fund, according to a spokesperson for the billionaire. But he declined to name the recipients &#8212; and local officials and nonprofits on Hawaii&#8217;s second-biggest island are puzzled at where the money might have gone.</p>

Those deadlines were tomorrow (January 19) and February 2. The deadlines in the new measure are March 1 and March 8. This is the third continuing resolution passed in four months as extremist Republicans have refused to fund the government unless they get a wish list of concessions to their ideology.

## Russian Foreign Minister Rejects US Proposal to Resume Nuclear Talks

date: 2024-01-19, from: VOA News USA

moscow — Russia's top diplomat on Thursday dismissed a U.S. proposal to resume a dialogue on nuclear arms control, saying it's impossible while Washington offers military support to Ukraine. 


Speaking at his annual news conference, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov accused the West of fueling global security risks by encouraging Ukraine to ramp up strikes on Russian territory and warned that Moscow would achieve its goals in the conflict despite Western assistance for Kyiv. 


Commenting on a U.S. proposal to resume contacts in the sphere of nuclear arms control, Lavrov described it as "unacceptable," saying that Moscow had put forward its stance in a diplomatic letter last month. He argued that for such talks to be held, Washington first needed to revise its current policy toward Russia. 




White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in June that the Biden administration was ready to talk to Russia without conditions about nuclear arms control even as Russia-U.S. ties were at their lowest point since the Cold War, noting "it is in neither of our countries' interest to embark on opening the competition in the strategic nuclear forces." 


But Lavrov charged that Washington's push for the revival of nuclear talks has been driven by a desire to resume inspections of Russia's nuclear weapons sites. He described such U.S. demands as "indecent" and cynical in view of Ukraine's attacks on Russian nuclear-capable bomber bases during the conflict. 


He mocked the U.S. offer to resume nuclear arms dialogue, arguing that Washington's position amounts to saying, "We have declared you an enemy, but we're ready to talk about how we could look at your strategic nuclear arsenal again." 


Extensive mutual inspections of nuclear weapons sites were envisaged by the New START treaty, which then-Presidents Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev signed in 2010. The inspections were halted in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic and never resumed. 


Moscow participation suspended


In February 2023, Russian President Vladimir Putin suspended Moscow's participation in the treaty, saying Russia could not allow U.S. inspections of its nuclear sites at a time when Washington and its NATO allies have openly declared Moscow's defeat in Ukraine as their goal. Moscow emphasized, however, that it wasn't withdrawing from the pact altogether and would continue to respect the caps on nuclear weapons the treaty set. 


The New START, the last remaining nuclear arms control pact between Russia and the United States, limits each country to no more than 1,550 deployed nuclear warheads and 700 deployed missiles and bombers. It's set to expire in 2026, and the lack of dialogue on anchoring a successor deal has worried arms control advocates. 


"Amid a 'hybrid war' waged by Washington against Russia, we aren't seeing any basis, not only for any additional joint measures in the sphere of arms control and reduction of strategic risks, but for any discussion of strategic stability issues with the U.S.," he said. "We firmly link such possibility to the West fully renouncing its malicious course aimed at undermining Russia's security and interests." 


The minister said Washington's push for restarting nuclear arms talks was rooted in a desire to "try to establish control over our nuclear arsenal and minimize nuclear risks for itself," but added that "those risks are emerging as a result of forceful pressure on our country." 


He accused the West of blocking any talks on ending the conflict and inciting the ramping up of attacks on Russia. 




"Such encouragement and the transfer of relevant weapons shows that the West doesn't want any constructive solution," Lavrov said. "The West is pushing toward the escalation of the Ukrainian crisis, and that raises new strategic risks." 


Asked if tensions with the West over Ukraine could spiral into a showdown resembling the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis — when the U.S. and the Soviet Union found themselves on the edge of nuclear war — Lavrov sternly warned against encouraging Ukraine to strike targets in Russia. 


He specifically accused Britain of inciting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to order such attacks, although he didn't offer any proof to back the claim. 


"London is literally egging on Zelenskyy to bomb any facilities anywhere in Russia," Lavrov said. 


'We will achieve' goals in Ukraine


He reaffirmed that Russia would pursue what it calls the "special military operation" regardless of Western pressure. 


"We will consistently and persistently press the goals of the special military operation and we will achieve them," he said. "They should have no hope that Russia could be defeated in any way. Those in the West who fantasize about it have failed to learn history lessons." 


On other foreign policy issues, Lavrov talked at length about growing influence of the Global South and argued that Western sway in international affairs was waning. 


He hailed Russia-China ties, saying they were going through their "best period in history" and were stronger than a conventional military union. 


Lavrov reaffirmed Moscow's call for the creation of an independent Palestinian state, describing it as the only way to ensure security for both Palestinians and Israel. He also criticized the U.S.-led attacks on Yemen, saying that "the more the Americans and the British bomb, the less desire to talk the Houthis have."

## Hans Reiser on ReiserFS deprecation from the Linux kernel

date: 2024-01-19, from: OS News

What follows is a letter from Hans Reiser to myself, which he wrote some two months back, and has asked me to publish, with his thoughts on the deprecation of ReiserFS from the Linux kernel. I have transcribed it to the best of my ability. Plaintext email may not be the best way to read it, as such, I have also made available PDF and HTML versions of the letter. ↫ Fredrick R. Brennan Hans Reiser is the creator of the ReiserFS file system, which used to be a serious contender for the Linux file system you&#8217;d use in the early 2000s. In 2006, Hans Reiser murdered his wife, and is currently serving a prison sentence for this crime. Hopefully, after he completes his prison sentence, he can become a contributing member of society once again, if the professionals and specialists involved in such matters deem him capable of doing so. The long letter mentioned here was actually quite a fascinating read, and details his abrasive behaviour in the Linux world, the design of ReiserFS and its place in the ecosystem at the time, and his thoughts on the removal of ReiserFS from the Linux kernel.

## Why is Boeing such a shitty corporation?

date: 2024-01-18, from: Robert Reich on Substack

Friends, My friend Harold Meyerson just wrote this for The American Prospect, and it&#8217;s so good and timely that I wanted to share it with you. In the wake of the midair blowout of a door on a Boeing 737 MAX 9 earlier this month, the lead that Airbus has taken over Boeing in the manufacture and sales of the world&#8217;s commercial aircraft has, not surprisingly, grown.

## 9/11 Victim's Remains Identified More Than 2 Decades After Attack

date: 2024-01-18, from: VOA News USA

new york — The remains of a man killed at the World Trade Center on 9/11 have been identified more than two decades after the 2001 attacks, the New York City medical examiner's office announced Thursday. 


John Ballantine Niven of Oyster Bay, New York, was a 44-year-old executive at Aon Risk Services, an insurance firm on the 105th floor of Tower 2 of the trade center complex, according to obituaries at the time. He left a wife and a son who was 18 months old at the time. 


Niven is the 1,650th victim identified from the deadliest act of terrorism on U.S. soil, when hijackers crashed airplanes into the Twin Towers, killing 2,753 people. 


"While the pain from the enormous losses on September 11th never leaves us, the possibility of new identifications can offer solace to the families of victims," New York City Mayor Eric Adams said in a statement. "I'm grateful for the ongoing work from the Office of Chief Medical Examiner that honors the memory of John Ballantine Niven and all those we lost." 


The medical examiner's office has been using advanced DNA analysis to identify victim remains in recent years. 


Ahead of the anniversary of the attacks last September, the office said it had identified remains of a man and a woman, though their names were not made public at the request of their families. 


"We will forever remember our heroes who perished on 9/11, and we appreciate the continuous efforts of forensic experts to help identify victims," Oyster Bay Supervisor Joseph Saladino said in a separate statement. "We're hopeful that this amazing advance in technology helps bring peace to Mr. Niven's family and allows him to eternally rest in peace." 


Roughly 40% of victims of the World Trade Center attack have yet to have their remains identified, as few full bodies were recovered when the giant towers collapsed. 


But as DNA testing has evolved, so has the costly, painstaking effort to connect more than 21,900 bits of remains to individual victims. In some cases, scientists have gone back to the same bone fragment 10 or more times, hoping new technology will provide answers. 


The 9/11 attacks killed nearly 3,000 people in New York, at the Pentagon, and near Shanksville, Pennsylvania.

## Where have all the flowers gone?

date: 2024-01-18, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>A post from Jason Velazquez called “<a href="https://www.fromjason.xyz/p/notebook/where-have-all-the-websites-gone/">Where have all the websites gone?</a>” crossed my socials. It’s a good lament about the dearth of interesting content on the internet and how we’re stuck in the same boring content silos.</p>
<p>The question reminded me of a song by Pete Seeger called “<em>Where have all the flowers gone?</em>” In the song Pete wonders aloud about the flowers now missing from the field…</p>
<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="html">[Verse 1]
Where have all the flowers gone?
Long time passing
Where have all the flowers gone?
Long time ago
Where have all the flowers gone?
The girls have picked them, every one
Oh, when will you ever learn?
Oh, when will you ever learn?
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>We find out that the girls have picked all the flowers. All of them. That’s a bit excessive. Why? The second verse explores the young girls’ situation…</p>
<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="html">[Verse 2]
Where have all the young girls gone?
Long time passing
Where have all the young girls gone?
Long time ago
Where have all the young girls gone?
They've taken husbands, every one
Oh, when will you ever learn?
Oh, when will you ever learn?
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The girls got married, good for them! That’s a natural part of growing up. But what of the husbands and how are they connected to the missing flowers? Did they use all the flowers for their weddings? The third verse answers this question.</p>
<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="html">[Verse 3]
Where have all the young men gone?
Long time passing
Where have all the young men gone?
Long time ago
Where have all the young men gone?
They're all in uniform
Oh, when will you ever learn?
Oh, when will you ever learn?
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The young men, dressed in uniform, went off to war. The flowers were, presumably, for their funerals. Pete sure knew how to tell a story.</p>
<p>So where have all the websites gone? Well, the people who make them have all gone to war for the capitalist machine. They grew up and got jobs. A natural part of growing up. Silos came and plucked their voices. Invasive memes and short form content grew in their place. Hustle overtook leisure. Harassment overtook openness. Influence overtook creativity. An economy of interestingness replaced by one of followers, likes, and engagement metrics.</p>
<p>One important thing to note; websites aren’t extinct. In fact, you’re on one now! Uploading your own words is ancient technology but still works.</p>
<p>I loved Jason’s point about the curators and it illuminated something I don’t think I fully understood before. Curators and aggregators are integral to the ecosystem. If we all create, steal, and regurgitate the same content then we only reinforce our own echo chamber. Aggregators bridge subcultures in a world of content bubbles and subreddits. They share curios from the web you may have missed, subverting the FOMO-based dopamine addiction machine using RSS. They find beauty in the mundane and surface wisdom from obscure writings. That is valuable, worth more than gold.</p>
<p><a href="https://robinrendle.com/notes/i-am-a-poem-i-am-not-software/">We are poems, not software</a> and in need of a reforestation of our curators. To paraphrase Mr. Rogers in these dire times, “Look for the aggregators…”</p>

## US Congress Averts Shutdown, Funds Government Into March

date: 2024-01-18, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — U.S. Congress sent President Joe Biden a short-term spending bill on Thursday that would avert a looming partial government shutdown and fund federal agencies into March. 


The House approved the measure by a vote of 314-108, with opposition coming mostly from the more conservative members of the Republican conference. Shortly before the vote, the House Freedom Caucus announced it 'strongly opposes' the measure because it would facilitate more spending than they support. 


Nevertheless, about half of Republicans joined with Democrats in passing the third stopgap funding measure in recent months. The action came a few hours after the Senate had voted overwhelmingly to pass the bill by a vote of 77-18. 


The measure extends current spending levels and buys time for the two chambers to work out their differences over full-year spending bills for the fiscal year that began in October. 


The temporary measure will run to March 1 for some federal agencies. Their funds were set to run out Friday. It extends the remainder of government operations to March 8. 


Right wing pressures Johnson


Speaker Mike Johnson has been under pressure from his right flank to scrap a $1.66 trillion budget deal he reached with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer earlier this month. Republican Representative Chip Roy said the continuing resolution passed Thursday will facilitate that agreement. 


"It's Groundhog Day in the House chamber all the time, every day, yet again spending money we don't have," Roy said. 


Johnson has insisted he will stick with the deal, and moderates in the party have stood behind him. They say that changing course now would be going back on his word and would weaken the speaker in future negotiations. 


Representative Rosa DeLauro, the ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, said Americans expect Congress to govern and work in a bipartisan fashion. 


"Some of my colleagues would see that this government would shut down and don't care how hurtful that would be," DeLauro said. 


House Republicans have fought bitterly over budget levels and policy since taking the majority at the start of 2023. Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy was ousted by his caucus in October after striking an agreement with Democrats to extend current spending the first time. Johnson also has come under criticism as he has wrestled with how to appease his members and avoid a government shutdown in an election year. 


"We just needed a little more time on the calendar to do it and now that's where we are," Johnson said Tuesday about the decision to extend federal funding yet again. "We're not going to get everything we want."




Most House Republicans have refrained so far from saying that Johnson's job is in danger. But a revolt of even a handful of Republicans could endanger his position in the narrowly divided House. 


Representative Bob Good, one of eight Republicans who voted to oust McCarthy, has been pushing Johnson to reconsider the deal with Schumer. 


"If your opponent in negotiation knows that you fear the consequence of not reaching an agreement more than they fear the consequence of not reaching an agreement, you will lose every time," Good said this week. 


Other Republicans acknowledge Johnson is in a tough spot. "The speaker was dealt with the hand he was dealt," said Representative Andy Barr, noting the constraints imposed by the party's slim majority. 


The short-term measure comes amid negotiations on a separate spending package that would provide wartime dollars to Ukraine and Israel and strengthen security at the U.S.-Mexico border. Johnson is also under pressure from the right not to accept a deal that is any weaker than a House-passed border measure that has no Democratic support. 


Johnson, Schumer and other congressional leaders and committee heads visited the White House on Wednesday to discuss spending legislation. Johnson used the meeting to push for stronger border security measures while Biden and Democrats detailed Ukraine's security needs as it continues to fight Russia. 


Biden has requested a $110 billion package for the wartime spending and border security.

## Asking People to Use Less Electricity Works

During Uri, much of the Texas electricity system essentially failed for several days, leading to hundred of deaths, while during Elliott, the Tennessee Valley Authority instituted rolling blackouts <a href="https://www.tva.com/newsroom/press-releases/tva-accepts-responsibility-starts-full-review" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">for the first time ever</a> as hundreds of thousands of Duke Energy customers in the Carolinas <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/duke-energy-apologizes-for-winter-storm-outages-as-ferc-nerc-open-investig/639583/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lost power.</a></p><p>This time around, TVA requested customers conserve power from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. on Wednesday morning, citing <a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/weather/2024/01/18/nashville-winter-weather-updates-freezing-rain/72269159007/" target="_blank">extremely low temperatures</a> throughout the Tennessee Valley and the areas it serves. </p><p>TVA was right that the grid would be stressed — it would ultimately break its <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/tennessee-valley-authority-record-electricity-ercot-texas" target="_blank">all time record</a> for demand. And yet, that demand peaked on Wednesday morning at 8 a.m. at 34,376 megawatts, notably short of the forecast demand of 35,125 MW, <a href="https://www.eia.gov/electricity/gridmonitor/dashboard/electric_overview/balancing_authority/TVA" target="_blank">according to Energy Information Administration data</a>.</p><p>There was also a sizable gap between forecast demand and actual demand the evening prior, after the TVA put out a release requesting conservation the following morning, but before the actual conservation period began. The request was tweeted out a little after 5 p.m. Central time on Tuesday; by 8 p.m., there was a roughly 3,000 MW gap between forecast demand and actual demand.</p><p>Something similar happened earlier this week in Texas. This time, ERCOT, which runs the market for 90% of the state’s electricity consumption, issued requests to conserve for Monday and Tuesday mornings. At 9 a.m. Central time on Monday, <a href="https://www.eia.gov/electricity/gridmonitor/dashboard/electric_overview/balancing_authority/ERCO" target="_blank">ERCOT forecasted demand</a> of 83,561 MW, while actual demand was 74,452 MW. And on Tuesday morning at 8 a.m., forecasted demand was 87,055 MW, while actual demand was 78,155 MW. ERCOT’s all-time demand record from last summer still stands, but it broke winter records this week.</p><p>And in the U.K., the national grid operator has turned this into a business, paying homes and businesses some $11.4 million so far this winter to conserve demand in peak moments, according to <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-18/uk-grid-operator-paid-9-million-to-shift-winter-power-demand" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a></em>. The combined energy saving was enough to power six million homes for at least an hour, per the report.</p><p>Voluntary conservation calls, while often effective in the short term, are often an indication that something has probably gone wrong. In both Texas and the TVA territory, advocates have called for measures to make grids more resilient and to improve energy efficiency, especially during cold weather. This means everything from winterizing natural gas infrastructure to updating building codes to better insulating homes so that they require less heat during cold snaps.</p><p>There are also more structured ways to get customers to consume less electricity during peak demand times than putting out voluntary requests — so-called “demand response” includes systems of incentives and payments to use less electricity at peak times. But Texas does not, as yet, offer them at a <a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/grid-edge/why-arent-texans-paid-to-help-prevent-blackouts-during-heat-waves" target="_blank">meaningful scale</a> to residential customers, just businesses.</p>

## Blinken Heading to Africa Next Week on Four-Nation Tour

date: 2024-01-18, from: VOA News USA

State Department — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will travel to Cape Verde, Ivory Coast, Nigeria, and Angola next week, the State Department announced, his fourth trip to the African continent.


The trip comes after 17 Cabinet-level official visits last year as a follow-up to the 2022 U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit in Washington.


President Joe Biden has also expressed his desire to visit Africa this year, but no definite plans have been announced.


State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Blinken’s six-day trip will highlight how the United States has accelerated the U.S.-Africa partnership since the summit, including in areas such as climate, food and health security.


“He will also emphasize our future-focused economic partnership and how the United States is investing in infrastructure in Africa to boost two-way trade, create jobs at home and on the continent, and help Africa compete in the global marketplace,” Miller said.




Asked if countering China’s influence on the continent would be a major theme, Molly Phee, assistant secretary of state for African affairs, said this is more of a preoccupation of the media.


“If China didn't exist, we would be fully engaged in Africa," she said. “Africa is important for its own sake, and it's important for American interests.”


Phee mentioned major U.S. infrastructure projects partnering with Angola and Cape Verde. She said a lot of the news coming out of Africa is negative, and Blinken’s trip would highlight the positive.


“I think it can highlight the great capacity of African people, particularly the youth. It can show really forward-looking types of engagements, for example, our partnership with Angola in outer space,” she said.




Phee said the Africa Cup of Nations football [soccer] tournament will be going on, and Blinken hopes to be able to attend a match in person while in the Ivory Coast.


Phee acknowledged that it is never possible for U.S. officials to get away from security issues, saying that Blinken would talk about the situation in the Sahel and coastal West Africa when he visits the Ivory Coast.




She said Nigeria is dealing with several internal security challenges, and Angola has played an important role in trying to address and reduce tensions in the eastern Congo.


In response to a question from VOA about Blinken’s visit to Cape Verde, Phee said the country is literally the port on Africa's doorstep.


“It is also a terrific democracy. It's a good model for the region,” she said.

## Did the battle against “misinformation” go too far?

date: 2024-01-18, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

Kulldorff, then a professor at Harvard Medical School, had spent 20 years researching infectious diseases and contributing to the development of the country’s vaccine safety surveillance system. “No,” he responded. The vaccines were important for some high-risk people,...

## A Lesson Learned

date: 2024-01-18, from: David Rosenthal's blog

You know how backups work great until you really need them? Below the fold, a lesson learned from my recent example of this phenomenon.<br />
<span><a name='more'></a></span>
<br />
A long time ago I was feeling rich, so I spent nearly $2000 on  one of the first-generation Mac Airs.  This led to me travelling with a <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/12/a-note-of-thanks.html">laptop I could afford to lose</a> instead. I loved the Air for all sorts of reasons but one of its important tasks was to back up my iPhone every day. And, of course, being something of an expert on preserving digital information, then back up the Air to an external USB hard disk using Time Machine. <a href="https://www.lockss.org">Lots Of Copies Keep Stuff Safe</a>.<br />
<br />
In the end I had to upgrade to a more recent M1 Air, not because the old one stopped working, but simply because the USB ports stoppped working, so it could no longer backup the iPhone or update the Time Machine disk. The new Air was impressively fast and had two USB-C ports, which it used both for data and for power. I continued to back up the iPhone and the Air daily<br />
<br />
Fast forward to last month. The new Air's USB-C ports had been a bit flaky for a while, but now one failed. It wouldn't transfer data or power. A few days later the other port stopped transferring power, leaving me with no way to charge it. It was about 85% charged, so I powered it off.<br />
<br />
I thought "I'm OK, I have yesterday's Time Machine so I can get a new M2 Air and initialize it from the disk". So I ordered a new one and, as soon as it was delivered, plugged in the Time Machine disk and fired up the Migration Assistant. It asked me what disk it should use. I wasn't able to select the Time Machine disk because, to my surprise, the Air couldn't see it. Plugging the disk into my Linux desktop revealed that in the couple of weeks since the day before the M1 Air failed, the Time Machine disk had died.<br />
<br />
At this point I remembered that when I powered it off, the M1 Air still had a USB-C port that transferred data, even if it didn't work for power. There were two ways to initialize the M2 Air using the remaining battery, either create a new Time Machine disk using the one USB-C port that transferred data, or via Bluetooth. I found a USB-C external SSD, which I figured would use less power, powered up the M1 Air, plugged in the drive, started a Time Machine backup, and crossed my fingers.<br />
<br />
After a long, agonizing wait the backup finished with still quite a lot of battery left, so I powered off the M1 Air and used the disk to initialize the M2 Air. Apple's Migration Assistant worked flawlessly, and I relaxed. The best thing about the M2 Air is that Apple went back to powering it with MagSafe! Their fragile USB hardware could no longer prevent the machine charging.<br />
<br />
So the lesson was that I needed to have <i>two</i> Time Machine disks and use them alternately, so even if the most recent one failed I would have a backup only one day older.<br />
<br />
The next problem came when I plugged my iPhone into the M2 Air to back it up. I got "unknown error 7014". Google had no trace of "unknown error 7014" so, baffled, I made an appointment with the "Genius" at Apple's Palo Alto store. In the faint hope that the M1 Air could be fixed, I took both Airs and the iPhone with me.<br />
<br />
The Genius was very good. He rapidly figured out that:<br />
<ul>
<li>"unknown error 7014" was caused by the fact that, despite its having been delivered a few days earlier, the M2 Air's operating system was out-of-date. A software update overnight fixed the problem.</li>
<li>He confirmed that the M1 Air's USB-C ports had failed and, to my surprise, explained that the ports were on a daughter-board that could be replaced. It was a $15 part and $90 in labor, and completed overnight.</li>
</ul>
So now I can travel with a Mac Air.<br />
<br />

## Corporate dealmaking is “in” for 2024

date: 2024-01-18, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>Globally, the total value of mergers and acquisitions last year was the lowest since in a decade, held back by interest rates, a volatile stock market and a strict regulatory environment.

It's much more powerful esp with people who like Telsas (of which I am one). I also see the Tesla as a very capable replacement for my 2007 BMW 535i, which I donated to charity in 2012, which I loved for the same reasons I love the Tesla. Putting down the competition isn't what marketing is about, you have to think about the people whose minds you're trying to change, and know you're in it for the long haul. An example of their ad copy: "With electric driving comes exciting possibilities. That’s why BMW approaches this new era in mobility just like any other; where engineering, innovation and aesthetics come together seamlessly to inspire joy in every journey." These people understand their product and how their fans see them.

## Pluralistic: Demon-haunted computers are back, baby (17 Jan 2024)

date: 2024-01-18, from: Cory Doctorow's blog

Today's links Demon-haunted computers are back, baby: Surely no one will ever find a way to abuse this security system that treats the computer's owner as an attacker. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2009, 2014, 2019, 2023 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading Demon-haunted computers are back, baby (permalink) As a science fiction writer, I am professionally irritated by a lot of sf movies. Not only do those writers get paid a lot more than I do, they insist on including things like "self-destruct" buttons on the bridges of their starships. Look, I get it. When the evil empire is closing in on your flagship with its secret transdimensional technology, it's important that you keep those secrets out of the emperor's hand. An irrevocable self-destruct switch there on the bridge gets the job done! (It has to be irrevocable, otherwise the baddies'll just swarm the bridge and toggle it off). But c'mon. If there's a facility built into your spaceship that causes it to explode no matter what the people on the bridge do, that is also a pretty big security risk! What if the bad guy figures out how to hijack the measure that &#8211; by design &#8211; the people who depend on the spaceship as a matter of life and death can't detect or override? I mean, sure, you can try to simplify that self-destruct system to make it easier to audit and assure yourself that it doesn't have any bugs in it, but remember Schneier's Law: anyone can design a security system that works so well that they themselves can't think of a flaw in it. That doesn't mean you've made a security system that works &#8211; only that you've made a security system that works on people stupider than you. I know it's weird to be worried about realism in movies that pretend we will ever find a practical means to visit other star systems and shuttle back and forth between them (which we are very, very unlikely to do): https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/09/astrobezzle/#send-robots-instead But this kind of foolishness galls me. It galls me even more when it happens in the real world of technology design, which is why I've spent the past quarter-century being very cross about Digital Rights Management in general, and trusted computing in particular. It all starts in 2002, when a team from Microsoft visited our offices at EFF to tell us about this new thing they'd dreamed up called "trusted computing": https://pluralistic.net/2020/12/05/trusting-trust/#thompsons-devil The big idea was to stick a second computer inside your computer, a very secure little co-processor, that you couldn't access directly, let alone reprogram or interfere with. As far as this "trusted platform module" was concerned, you were the enemy. The "trust" in trusted computing was about other people being able to trust your computer, even if they didn't trust you. So that little TPM would do all kinds of cute tricks. It could observe and produce a cryptographically signed manifest of the entire boot-chain of your computer, which was meant to be an unforgeable certificate attesting to which kind of computer you were running and what software you were running on it. That meant that programs on other computers could decide whether to talk to your computer based on whether they agreed with your choices about which code to run. This process, called "remote attestation," is generally billed as a way to identify and block computers that have been compromised by malware, or to identify gamers who are running cheats and refuse to play with them. But inevitably it turns into a way to refuse service to computers that have privacy blockers turned on, or are running stream-ripping software, or whose owners are blocking ads: https://pluralistic.net/2023/08/02/self-incrimination/#wei-bai-bai After all, a system that treats the device's owner as an adversary is a natural ally for the owner's other, human adversaries. The rubric for treating the owner as an adversary focuses on the way that users can be fooled by bad people with bad programs. If your computer gets taken over by malicious software, that malware might intercept queries from your antivirus program and send it false data that lulls it into thinking your computer is fine, even as your private data is being plundered and your system is being used to launch malware attacks on others. These separate, non-user-accessible, non-updateable secure systems serve a nubs of certainty, a remote fortress that observes and faithfully reports on the interior workings of your computer. This separate system can't be user-modifiable or field-updateable, because then malicious software could impersonate the user and disable the security chip. It's true that compromised computers are a real and terrifying problem. Your computer is privy to your most intimate secrets and an attacker who can turn it against you can harm you in untold ways. But the widespread redesign of out computers to treat us as their enemies gives rise to a range of completely predictable and &#8211; I would argue &#8211; even worse harms. Building computers that treat their owners as untrusted parties is a system that works well, but fails badly. First of all, there are the ways that trusted computing is designed to hurt you. The most reliable way to enshittify something is to supply it over a computer that runs programs you can't alter, and that rats you out to third parties if you run counter-programs that disenshittify the service you're using. That's how we get inkjet printers that refuse to use perfectly good third-party ink and cars that refuse to accept perfectly good engine repairs if they are performed by third-party mechanics: https://pluralistic.net/2023/07/24/rent-to-pwn/#kitt-is-a-demon It's how we get cursed devices and appliances, from the juicer that won't squeeze third-party juice to the insulin pump that won't connect to a third-party continuous glucose monitor: https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/01/unauthorized-bread-a-near-future-tale-of-refugees-and-sinister-iot-appliances/ But trusted computing doesn't just create an opaque veil between your computer and the programs you use to inspect and control it. Trusted computing creates a no-go zone where programs can change their behavior based on whether they think they're being observed. The most prominent example of this is Dieselgate, where auto manufacturers murdered hundreds of people by gimmicking their cars to emit illegal amount of NOX. Key to Dieselgate was a program that sought to determine whether it was being observed by regulators (it checked for the telltale signs of the standard test-suite) and changed its behavior to color within the lines. Software that is seeking to harm the owner of the device that's running it must be able to detect when it is being run inside a simulation, a test-suite, a virtual machine, or any other hallucinatory virtual world. Just as Descartes couldn't know whether anything was real until he assured himself that he could trust his senses, malware is always questing to discover whether it is running in the real universe, or in a simulation created by a wicked god: https://pluralistic.net/2022/07/28/descartes-was-an-optimist/#uh-oh That's why mobile malware uses clever gambits like periodically checking for readings from your device's accelerometer, on the theory that a virtual mobile phone running on a security researcher's test bench won't have the fidelity to generate plausible jiggles to match the real data that comes from a phone in your pocket: https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/01/google-play-malware-used-phones-motion-sensors-to-conceal-itself/ Sometimes this backfires in absolutely delightful ways. When the Wannacry ransomware was holding the world hostage, the security researcher Marcus Hutchins noticed that its code made reference to a very weird website: iuqerfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea.com. Hutchins stood up a website at that address and every Wannacry-infection in the world went instantly dormant: https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/10/flintstone-delano-roosevelt/#the-matrix It turns out that Wannacry's authors were using that ferkakte URL the same way that mobile malware authors were using accelerometer readings &#8211; to fulfill Descartes' imperative to distinguish the Matrix from reality. The malware authors knew that security researchers often ran malicious code inside sandboxes that answered every network query with fake data in hopes of eliciting responses that could be analyzed for weaknesses. So the Wannacry worm would periodically poll this nonexistent website and, if it got an answer, it would assume that it was being monitored by a security researcher and it would retreat to an encrypted blob, ceasing to operate lest it give intelligence to the enemy. When Hutchins put a webserver up at iuqerfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea.com, every Wannacry instance in the world was instantly convinced that it was running on an enemy's simulator and withdrew into sulky hibernation. The arms race to distinguish simulation from reality is critical and the stakes only get higher by the day. Malware abounds, even as our devices grow more intimately woven through our lives. We put our bodies into computers &#8211; cars, buildings &#8211; and computers inside our bodies. We absolutely want our computers to be able to faithfully convey what's going on inside them. But we keep running as hard as we can in the opposite direction, leaning harder into secure computing models built on subsystems in our computers that treat us as the threat. Take UEFI, the ubiquitous security system that observes your computer's boot process, halting it if it sees something it doesn't approve of. On the one hand, this has made installing GNU/Linux and other alternative OSes vastly harder across a wide variety of devices. This means that when a vendor end-of-lifes a gadget, no one can make an alternative OS for it, so off the landfill it goes. It doesn't help that UEFI &#8211; and other trusted computing modules &#8211; are covered by Section 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), which makes it a felony to publish information that can bypass or weaken the system. The threat of a five-year prison sentence and a $500,000 fine means that UEFI and other trusted computing systems are understudied, leaving them festering with longstanding bugs: https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/09/free-sample/#que-viva Here's where it gets really bad. If an attacker can get inside UEFI, they can run malicious software that &#8211; by design &#8211; no program running on our computers can detect or block. That badware is running in "Ring -1" &#8211; a zone of privilege that overrides the operating system itself. Here's the bad news: UEFI malware has already been detected in the wild: https://securelist.com/cosmicstrand-uefi-firmware-rootkit/106973/ And here's the worst news: researchers have just identified another exploitable UEFI bug, dubbed Pixiefail: https://blog.quarkslab.com/pixiefail-nine-vulnerabilities-in-tianocores-edk-ii-ipv6-network-stack.html Writing in Ars Technica, Dan Goodin breaks down Pixiefail, describing how anyone on the same LAN as a vulnerable computer can infect its firmware: https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/01/new-uefi-vulnerabilities-send-firmware-devs-across-an-entire-ecosystem-scrambling/ That vulnerability extends to computers in a data-center where the attacker has a cloud computing instance. PXE &#8211; the system that Pixiefail attacks &#8211; isn't widely used in home or office environments, but it's very common in data-centers. Again, once a computer is exploited with Pixiefail, software running on that computer can't detect or delete the Pixiefail code. When the compromised computer is queried by the operating system, Pixiefail undetectably lies to the OS. "Hey, OS, does this drive have a file called 'pixiefail?'" "Nope." "Hey, OS, are you running a process called 'pixiefail?'" "Nope." This is a self-destruct switch that's been compromised by the enemy, and which no one on the bridge can de-activate &#8211; by design. It's not the first time this has happened, and it won't be the last. There are models for helping your computer bust out of the Matrix. Back in 2016, Edward Snowden and bunnie Huang prototyped and published source code and schematics for an "introspection engine": https://assets.pubpub.org/aacpjrja/AgainstTheLaw-CounteringLawfulAbusesofDigitalSurveillance.pdf This is a single-board computer that lives in an ultraslim shim that you slide between your iPhone's mainboard and its case, leaving a ribbon cable poking out of the SIM slot. This connects to a case that has its own OLED display. The board has leads that physically contact each of the network interfaces on the phone, conveying any data they transit to the screen so that you can observe the data your phone is sending without having to trust your phone. (I liked this gadget so much that I included it as a major plot point in my 2020 novel Attack Surface, the third book in the Little Brother series): https://craphound.com/attacksurface/ We don't have to cede control over our devices in order to secure them. Indeed, we can't ever secure them unless we can control them. Self-destruct switches don't belong on the bridge of your spaceship, and trusted computing modules don't belong in your devices.

## What a Trump Victory Could Mean for Climate Policy

date: 2024-01-18, from: Heatmap News

<em><strong>Current conditions: </strong>Parts of Indonesia are under water due to heavy rainfall • Tree branches are heavy with ice in Oregon • A no-burn alert is in place for Southern California as an atmospheric “lid” locks in smog.</em>
</p><h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2><h3>1. Kerry warns U.S. election stakes for climate policy are ‘as high as they can get’</h3><p>
	As election season heats up and a <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=4db794fb87&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">certain bombastic former president</a> looks to take back the White House in November, conversation has turned to what a second Trump presidency could mean for climate policy. Trump has promised to <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=b1e6defe64&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">gut the Inflation Reduction Act</a> and <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=5f35df938f&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cut funding for climate adaptation</a> in poorer countries, among other things. What would his return really mean for the climate movement on a national and global scale? Here’s a quick opinion roundup:
</p><ul>
<li><strong>The stakes couldn’t be higher: </strong>Trump won’t be able to stop the green energy transition that’s already underway, but he could slow it down, U.S. Climate Envoy John Kerry told <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=0ea1ef1b12&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bloomberg TV</a>. “The marketplace is going to support this transition and it’s irrevocable now — we’re going to get there. The only question is if we’re going to get there in time to not be ravaged by the worst consequences of the climate crisis.”</li>
<li><strong>Gutting the IRA would be very unpopular: </strong>Many clean-energy programs funded by President Biden’s signature climate bill are in red states, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=67e5d1cca6&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">noted <em>The Economist</em></a>. If Trump nixes them, “he may face pushback from his own party,” not to mention business leaders. Some automakers, like GM and Nissan, are already warning against the move.</li>
<li><strong>Trump can’t stop the global momentum:</strong> Of course the U.S. president’s views on climate matter, but “the world’s in a slightly different place than it was five years ago,” World Bank President Ajay Banga <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=e8a7b3af3d&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told <em>Politico</em></a>. The bank helps finance climate adaptation in developing countries, and is pushing for more private sector investment in renewables. Banga suggested international momentum on these issues is “much bigger than just the U.S. and the EU.”</li>
</ul><p>
<strong>Side note:</strong> New <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=a8bf1d994b&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">research</a> from the University of Colorado at Boulder <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=e34a0e0a6c&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">concludes</a> that concerns about climate change have “a significant and growing effect on voting that favors the Democrats” and “that climate change opinion probably cost Republicans the 2020 presidential election, all else being equal.”
</p><h3>2. The South smashes electricity records</h3><p>
<strong></strong>The Tennessee Valley Authority, America’s largest public power company, just set a new record for electricity usage thanks to the cold weather system hammering huge sections of the country, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=7403f5b09c&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reports <em>Heatmap</em>’s Matthew Zeitlin</a>. Consumers used around 34,500 megawatts of electricity yesterday morning, about 1,000 megawatts more than its previous all-time record of around 33,500 megawatts in August 2007. Like much of the region, Tennesseans largely heat their homes using electricity as opposed to fuel oil or natural gas. Cold mornings are particularly challenging for the authority because lots of people are trying to heat their chilly homes between waking up and going to work or school. “By contrast, summer afternoons and early evenings are tough for grids to manage because temperatures stay high even as the sun goes down and people return to their homes and cool them and start operating appliances,” Zeitlin explains. The cold snap is expected to last through the weekend.
</p><h3>3. Study: Greenland is losing way more ice than experts thought </h3><p>
<strong></strong>The Greenland ice sheet has lost 20% more ice than scientists previously thought due to global warming, according to new <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=56b8a3ebbd&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">research</a> published in the journal <em>Nature</em>. The researchers came to this conclusion by looking at the amount of glacial ice lost around the edges of the sheet, an area that earlier estimates overlooked. Experts worry the huge amounts of fresh water pouring into the north Atlantic could disrupt ocean currents and wreak havoc on global weather patterns.

<strong></strong>Butterflies may lose their spotty wings thanks to climate change, scientists say. The new <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=1088fc7ce2&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">research</a> focuses on female meadow brown butterflies, and finds that insects that developed in warmer temperatures had fewer spots than those that developed in cooler weather. "This is an unexpected consequence of climate change,” <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=dc8c32b09a&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> Richard ffrench-Constant, a professor of molecular natural history at the University of Exeter in the U.K. “We tend to think about species moving north, rather than changing appearance."
</p><h3>5. Scientists urge swift climate action ahead of EU elections</h3><p>
<strong></strong>The European Union needs to double down on plans to phase out fossil fuels and implement green policies if it wants to reach its 2050 net zero targets, a <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=5ae9a63ee0&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a> from the European Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change said. "The EU needs to sharply decrease the use of fossil fuels, and almost fully phase out the use of coal and fossil gas in public electricity and heat generation by 2040," the advisers said. The report urges the EU to work quickly to put planned climate policies into law. The timing of the report is interesting because, as the <em>Financial Times </em><a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=3ba4995c02&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">explained</a>, the EU faces parliamentary elections this summer, “when rightwing parties that want to slow the pace of progress are expected to focus on rhetoric about the social costs of switching away from fossil fuels to combat climate change.”

## Evangelicals for Trump? It's Not About Religion

date: 2024-01-18, from: Dan Rather's Steady

Right after his victory in Iowa, where he received 53% of the evangelical and born-again Christian vote, Donald Trump traveled to New York to plead his case &#8212; literally. He was in federal court today, where he&#8217;ll soon find out how much he&#8217;ll have to pay for defaming a woman he&#8217;s also been found liable for sexually abusing. You may want to think about that for a moment. And let us remember it&#8217;s only January. There are more trials to come starring the leading GOP presidential candidate.

## Analysts: Pyongyang Tries to Create Seoul-Tokyo Friction to Harm US Relations

date: 2024-01-18, from: VOA News USA

washington — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is trying to create friction between Tokyo and Seoul, South Korea, and undermine their trilateral relations with the United States as security cooperation among them deepens, analysts said.  


Washington, Seoul and Tokyo conducted trilateral naval drills in the international waters south of Jeju Island from Monday to Wednesday, said South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS).   


The exercises involving nine ships, including the USS Carl Vinson, a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, were aimed at enhancing deterrence against North Korean nuclear, missile and underwater threats, the JCS said. 


North Korea is taking an increasingly hostile stance toward South Korea. Calling for the amendment of its constitution to refer to South Korea as its "principal enemy," Kim said Pyongyang should plan for occupying South Korea if war breaks out.   




He made the remarks in a speech on Monday to the Supreme Assembly, the country's rubber-stamp parliament, said state media KCNA. 


A day earlier, North Korea test-fired what it said was a solid fuel intermediate range ballistic missile with a hypersonic warhead.




Pyongyang also fired more than 200 rounds of artillery shells near Yeonpyeong Island on a disputed maritime border with South Korea on January 5 and more than 60 rounds near the same island on January 7. Yeonpyeong Island is about 120 kilometers west of Seoul. 


While escalating tensions on the Korean Peninsula, Kim sent a message to Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on January 5 conveying sympathy over a powerful earthquake that shook Ishikawa prefecture, leaving at least 200 people dead and more than 200 missing as the new year began.  




In the message, Kim expressed "his deep sympathy and condolences" to Kishida for losses caused by the earthquake, KCNA reported on January 6.  


Analysts said although North Korea has relayed condolence messages to Japan after disasters in the past, this is the first time Kim personally reached out to a Japanese prime minister.


"While Kim Jong Un may wish to drive a wedge between Japan and the ROK, the real intention, subtle but still real, is to drive a wedge between Japan and America, in spite of last year's successes at Camp David in the trilateral summit," said Kenneth Dekleva, a senior fellow at the George H.W. Bush Foundation for U.S.-China Relations.


At the Camp David summit, U.S. President Joe Biden, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, and Kishida agreed to cooperate on multiple measures to bolster deterrence against North Korea.




Dekleva, who served as a State Department psychiatrist analyzing foreign leaders including Kim from 2006 to 2016, continued, "Another intention of equal importance is to test the U.S.-ROK relationship, especially given the recent dangerous, bellicose threats of war made recently by Kim Jong Un."  


Kim ordered his military forces to prepare for war with the U.S. and "South Korean puppets and Japs," according to KCNA, describing Kim's speech made at a planning meeting of his ruling Workers' Party on December 31.




Pyongyang has been critical of the trilateral ties forged after Seoul and Tokyo mended relations in March. Disputes rooted in Japan's colonization of the Korean Peninsula from 1910 to 1945 had strained relations for decades.  


Ken Gause, an expert on North Korea's leadership and political system at the Center for Naval Analyses,  said Kim's message also signals Pyongyang could be "keeping its options open for engagement."  


"North Korea is trying to put Japan in a situation where it has to choose between its own self-interest and the self-interest of the alliance as a whole," he said.  


Kishida said in May that he is willing to meet Kim to discuss the return of Japanese who were abducted by North Korea in the 1960s and 1970s.  


At North Korea's summit with Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi in September 2002, Kim's father, Kim Jong Il, admitted the country had abducted 12 Japanese nationals. North Korea returned five of them to Japan in October of that year. 


Japan says North Korea abducted 17 Japanese citizens in the 1970s to 1980s.  


Shihoko Goto, Asia program director at the Wilson Center, said, "The abduction issue remains a highly emotional agenda in Japan, and moving forward to seek a resolution is high on the agenda of Kishida's government." 




She added that Kim's message of condolence "was seen favorably in Tokyo and seen as an opportunity for greater dialogue, if not improved relations, between the two countries." 


However, she said, Tokyo will be "in lockstep" with Seoul and Washington in deterring North Korea, as Pyongyang also is "an existential threat" to Japan.

## Lichee Console 4A, RISC-V mini laptop: review, benchmarks and early issues

## Frigid Weather Compounds Chicago's Struggles to House Asylum-Seekers

date: 2024-01-18, from: VOA News USA

chicago — As temperatures hover below freezing in Chicago, dozens of asylum-seekers are staying in the lower level of a library until the bitter cold gripping much of the country lifts. 


But after that, Chicago's plans for offering immediate shelter to the growing number of migrants arriving in the nation's third-largest city remain murky. 


For more than a year, Chicago has wrestled with how to house new arrivals until shelter space is free, utilizing measures that city leaders insist are a stopgap. Last week, it was parked city buses. Before that it was police station lobbies and airports. The makeshift approach has frazzled volunteers, nonprofit groups and migrants wary of the lack of a long-term plan, particularly during the city's long winters. 


"The city's favorite word for everything is 'temporary,'" said Vianney Marzullo, a volunteer who has helped migrants staying at O'Hare International Airport. "It's their new choice of Band-Aid word. Everything is temporary, temporary, temporary." 




Chicago has struggled, like New York and Denver, to deal with the crisis that started in 2022 when migrants began arriving in Democratic-led cities, largely at the direction of Texas Governot Greg Abbott. The winter weather has further complicated efforts. Last week, New York, which has received more than 170,000 migrants, evacuated a massive tent camp ahead of a storm. Big-city mayors have asked repeatedly for more federal help. 


Chicago's response has stood out for its haphazard approach with a heavy reliance on volunteers who have spent more than a year providing medical care, food and donated items. 


City leaders say the situation keeps changing and there have been snags along the way. 


Mayor Brandon Johnson floated the idea of a heated tent encampment, but construction was scrapped over the risk of contaminants at the former industrial site. 


The city had instituted a 60-day limit for shelter stays but pushed the first batch of notices off to next week because of the weather. Meanwhile, the city has been heavily criticized for conditions at its shelters and the death of a young boy whose family stayed at one. 


The political fight has also heated up and spread to the suburbs. 


Abbott's busing operation has been dropping off migrants at all hours in different Chicago area cities without coordination. When the city began fining bus companies and filing lawsuits, Abbott fired back with chartered planes. Johnson had planned a summit for this week with suburban mayors to discuss the problem; it was canceled by the weather. His office didn't return a request for comment Wednesday. 


"This is an international crisis that requires federal intervention of which local government is subsidizing that work. Never designed to do it, but yet here we are still standing," Johnson said last week ahead of the storm. 




Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker also wrote to Abbott last week asking to suspend buses until the temperatures rise and with many migrants arriving without winter coats or shoes. But Abbott rejected the notion, saying the federal government needs to step up. 


More than 33,000 migrants, mostly from Venezuela, have arrived in Chicago since 2022. Currently, nearly 15,000 migrants are living in 28 shelters and the city is continually opening more. Many migrants have gone elsewhere or live with family and friends in the area. Chicago, like other cities, has offered bus tickets out of the city. 


The city wound down its much-maligned use of police stations to house migrants, but O'Hare International Airport is still being used, with some asylum-seekers staying for weeks at a time as they await shelter. More than 200 were there Wednesday, according to the city. 


Until the weather turned, the city was keeping migrants aboard eight city buses that were running continuously and parked near a downtown highway in an area designated "the landing zone." 


Six heated tents are under construction nearby, which the city says will be used for intake and services, such as medical care. It's unclear if they will also be used for housing. 


Marylin Gonzalez, 34, slept on the buses last week along with her husband and three children, ages 15, 16 and 18. The buses were crowded, with sicknesses spreading quickly. 




Gonzalez described the atmosphere aboard as tense, with many worried about where they would go. She said it made her feel like a prisoner. 


"The children are stressed. People get stressed, they argue, they are already desperate," she said. "Sometimes we have to sleep sitting up because there is no space to lay down." 


Outside the buses, many would take up activities, like throwing around a football, to keep warm. 


The landing zone was cleared of people and vehicles on Monday, but by Wednesday morning, the empty warming buses were parked there again, a signal that the city intends to return to using them. The city's Office of Emergency Management didn't respond to questions Wednesday about the city's plans when the weather warms. 


Roughly 50 migrants were staying in the lower level of the Harold Washington Library Center, the city's flagship location downtown during the cold snap, according to people staying there. Migrants, including those who came in on their own to avoid the cold, were living with others facing homelessness. According to the city's tally, 5 migrants at the library site were on lists for shelters. An Associated Press reporter was not allowed inside. 


Angel Alberto Chourio, 30, slept there over the weekend, saying he was trying to figure out his next steps. He and a friend arrived from Venezuela last year. The promise of work out of state didn't pan out, so they came back to Chicago recently. Without any place else to go, they came to the library. 


He said Wednesday that he was nervous about the shelter stay limits and was not on a waiting list for one. 


"We are not used to this. The cold is too much, since it is already below zero," he said, looking for a silver lining. "At least they give one a chance to continue living."

## Biden Convenes Top Congressional Leaders to Discuss Ukraine Aid, US Border Deal

date: 2024-01-18, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — U.S. President Joe Biden convened top congressional leaders at the White House to underscore Ukraine's security needs, a meeting that comes at a pivotal time as senators narrow on a landmark immigration deal that could unlock $110 billion in stalled aid to Ukraine, Israel and other U.S. allies.


But Speaker Mike Johnson and other Republicans used the face-to-face moment with Biden to push him for tougher border security measures, with the speaker telling the president that Republican lawmakers were demanding "substantive policy change" and insisting that the White House's executive actions on immigration had weakened the border.




"We understand that there's concern about the safety, security and sovereignty of Ukraine," Johnson told reporters after the meeting, which ran for more than an hour. "But the American people have those same concerns about our own domestic sovereignty and our safety and our security."


Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, also speaking to reporters after the meeting, stressed that Biden has repeatedly said he is willing to compromise on certain border measures and that any effort in a divided Congress must be bipartisan. House Republicans have insisted on passage of a hard-line border security measure that has no Democratic support on Capitol Hill.


"There was a large amount of agreement around the table that we must do Ukraine, and we must do border," he said.


The White House called the meeting with lawmakers — including Johnson, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, and Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell — to brief them on Ukraine's current need for weapons and other aid, which the White House described as "desperate" and "urgent."


By populating the meeting with national security leaders, the meeting was expected to impress on the new speaker the importance of the aid package and the current U.S. approach to world affairs. The Republicans in the room, even Johnson, are largely supportive of aiding Ukraine but have stressed to the White House that it will need significant border-security measures in return to persuade the large swath of rank-and-file Republican lawmakers skeptical about sending more funds abroad.


"He's willing to hear what these congressional members want to talk about, but the purpose of this meeting is to talk about Ukraine," White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said ahead of the mid-afternoon gathering, which was held in the Cabinet Room.


Key time to convene


Biden is convening the lawmakers at the start of an election year when border security and the wars abroad are punctuating the race for the White House as he faces a potential rematch against Republican Donald Trump with control of the presidency and Congress all at stake.


It comes as Congress is about to quickly approve temporary funding to avoid a government shutdown — postponing the annual spending battles — but as the supplemental aid package sits undone during the immigration and border talks.


Biden, a longtime leader in U.S. foreign policy, finds himself confronting a new generation of Republican lawmakers who have little interest in engaging abroad or supporting vast American military aid or actions around the world.


Led by Trump, the former president who is the Republicans' front-runner for the nomination, a growing number of the Republicans in Congress are particularly hostile to helping Ukraine fight Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion.


U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who along with National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan met this week with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy in Davos, Switzerland, said Washington is determined to keep supporting Ukraine, and "we're working very closely with Congress in order to do that."


Ahead of the meeting, McConnell announced the package could be ready for a vote as soon as next week, and Schumer sounded a similarly optimistic note — though negotiations continue.


Senators develop border proposal


Johnson, since taking the gavel in October, signaled he personally believes in supporting Ukraine as it works to expel Russia. He met privately with Zelenskyy during the Ukrainian president's whirlwind tour of Washington last month seeking aid before the year-end holidays.


But the speaker leads an ambivalent House Republican majority that wants to extract its own priorities on the U.S.-Mexico border in exchange for any overseas support.


The speaker has insisted any border security deal must align with the House-passed strict border security bill. He told lawmakers in a private meeting over the weekend that they could probably get their priorities enacted with a Republican president, though the speaker did not mean that to preclude not taking action now, said a Republican leadership aide familiar with the call.


But senators, even fellow Republicans, said the House approach is a nonstarter that would never find the bipartisan backing in both chambers needed for approval.


Instead, a core group of senators led by Republican James Lankford has been meeting privately for weeks with Biden's top advisers — including Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas — to develop a border security package that could actually be signed into law.


Lankford told reporters late Tuesday that he hopes to prepare bill text as negotiations try to wrap up soon.


McConnell told Republican senators privately last week they should take the deal Lankford is producing, according to a person granted anonymity to discuss the closed meeting.


"This is a unique moment in time," said the Number 2 Republican John Thune.


"It's an opportunity to get some really conservative border policy that we haven't been able to get for 40 years," he said. "And so we'll see. I mean, it may or may not happen, but I think you got to take a run at it."


Senator 'hopeful'


The broader security package includes about $60 billion for Ukraine, which is mainly used to purchase U.S. weaponry to fight the war and to shore up its own government operations, along with some $14.5 billion for Israel, about $14 billion for border security, and additional funds for other security needs.


Biden opened the door to a broader U.S.-Mexico border security package late last year and the changes being discussed could be difficult for some Democrats who oppose strict restrictions on immigration.


Schumer said negotiations over the border security package have made progress in recent weeks and he was "hopeful that things are headed in the right direction."


Schumer said he expects the meeting with Biden will reinforce that the national security package is urgent and "any agreement on an issue as complex and contentious as the border is going to have to have support from both sides of the aisle."

## Do users write more insecure code with AI assistants?

date: 2024-01-18, from: OS News

AI code assistants have emerged as powerful tools that can aid in the software development life-cycle and can improve developer productivity. Unfortunately, such assistants have also been found to produce insecure code in lab environments, raising significant concerns about their usage in practice. In this paper, we conduct a user study to examine how users interact with AI code assistants to solve a variety of security related tasks. Overall, we find that participants who had access to an AI assistant wrote significantly less secure code than those without access to an assistant. Participants with access to an AI assistant were also more likely to believe they wrote secure code, suggesting that such tools may lead users to be overconfident about security flaws in their code. To better inform the design of future AI-based code assistants, we release our user-study apparatus and anonymized data to researchers seeking to build on our work at this link. ↫ Neil Perry, Megha Srivastava, Deepak Kumar, and Dan Boneh I&#8217;m surprised somewhat randomly copying other people&#8217;s code into your program &#8211; violating their licenses, to boot &#8211; leads to crappier code. Who knew!
