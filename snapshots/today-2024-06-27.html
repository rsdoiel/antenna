state superintendent orders schools to teach the Bible in schools</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>oklahoma city, oklahoma — Oklahoma’s top education official on
Thursday ordered public schools to incorporate the Bible into lessons
for grades 5 through 12, the latest effort by conservatives to
incorporate religion into classrooms.</p>
<p>The directive drew immediate condemnation from civil rights groups
and supporters of the separation of church and state, with some calling
it an abuse of power and a violation of the U.S. Constitution.</p>
<p>The order sent to districts across the state by Republican State
Superintendent Ryan Walters says adherence to the mandate is compulsory
and “immediate and strict compliance is expected.”</p>
<p>“The Bible is an indispensable historical and cultural touchstone,”
Walters said in a statement. “Without basic knowledge of it, Oklahoma
students are unable to properly contextualize the foundation of our
nation which is why Oklahoma educational standards provide for its
instruction.”</p>
<p>Oklahoma law already explicitly allows Bibles in the classroom and
lets teachers use them in instruction, said Phil Bacharach, a spokesman
for state Attorney General Gentner Drummond.</p>
<p>But it’s not clear if Walters has the authority to mandate that
schools teach it. State law says individual school districts have the
exclusive authority to decide on instruction, curriculum, reading lists,
instructional materials and textbooks.</p>
<p>The head of the Oklahoma chapter of the Council on American-Islamic
Relations criticized the directive as a clear violation of the
Constitution’s Establishment Clause, which prohibits the government from
“establishing” a religion.</p>
<p>“We adamantly oppose any requirements that religion be forcefully
taught or required as a part of lesson plans in public schools, in
Oklahoma, or anywhere else in the country,” Adam Soltani said in a
statement.</p>
<p>“Public schools are not Sunday schools,” Rachel Laser, president and
CEO of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, said in a
statement. “This is textbook Christian Nationalism: Walters is abusing
the power of his public office to impose his religious beliefs on
everyone else’s children. Not on our watch.”</p>
<p>The directive is the latest salvo in an effort by conservative-led
states to target public schools: Louisiana has required them to post the
Ten Commandments in classrooms, while others are under pressure to teach
the Bible and ban books and lessons about race, sexual orientation and
gender identity.</p>
<p>Earlier this week the Oklahoma Supreme Court blocked an attempt by
the state to have the first publicly funded religious charter school in
the country.</p>
<p>A former public school teacher who was elected to his post in 2022,
Walters ran on a platform of fighting “woke ideology,” banning books
from school libraries and getting rid of “radical leftists” who he
claims are indoctrinating children in classrooms.</p>
<p>He has clashed with leaders in both parties for his focus on
culture-war issues including transgender rights and banning books, and
in January he faced criticism for appointing a right-wing social media
influencer from New York to a state library committee.</p>

<h2 id="cnn-bans-white-house-pool-reporters-from-debate-room">CNN bans
White House pool reporters from debate room</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The White House Correspondents’ Association said
Thursday that CNN had rejected multiple requests to include White House
pool reporters inside the studio during the first presidential debate
between incumbent Joe Biden and Republican rival Donald Trump. </p>
<p>The press pool, made up of representatives of major news
organizations, accompanies the president on foreign and domestic trips
and normally has access to any event where he speaks or appears in
public, with the goal of keeping the U.S. public informed. </p>
<p>It is extremely rare for it to be barred from an event in the United
States. </p>
<p>“WHCA is deeply concerned that CNN has rejected our repeated requests
to include the White House travel pool inside the studio,” Kelly
O’Donnell, president of the White House Correspondents’ Association,
said in a statement. </p>
<p>“The pool is there for the ‘what ifs?’ in a world where the
unexpected does happen,” she said, and to provide “context and insight
by direct observation and not through the lens of the television
production.” </p>
<p>These reporters are there to see what is said and done when the
microphones and cameras are off, and provide independent observation,
she wrote, with duties “separate from the production of the debate as a
news event.” </p>
<p>O’Donnell said both the Biden and Trump campaigns agreed to the
WHCA’s request. </p>
<p>CNN has agreed to allow only one White House print pool reporter to
enter the studio during a commercial break to “briefly observe the
setting.” </p>
<p>The network will also allow still photographers from other outlets to
cover the candidates inside the studio and will provide a television
feed of the debate to other networks. </p>
<p>CNN has put in place many other rules for the first showdown,
including two commercial breaks, no props and muted microphones except
when the candidates are recognized to speak. The network did not respond
to a request for comment. </p>
<p>“Precedent matters for future debates,” O’Donnell said, alluding to
the next Biden-Trump face-off in September. </p>
<p>The National Association of Black Journalists also asked CNN to
accredit reporters from local Black-owned news organizations, after none
of Atlanta’s Black news groups got credentials to be on-site for the
debate.</p>

id="windows-10-will-be-covered-by-0patch-a-third-party-paid-patching-service">Windows
10 will be covered by 0patch, a third-party paid patching service</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-27, from: OS News</p>
<p>So I learned something new today: there are companies that provide
security patches for Windows that aren’t Microsoft. I never even
considered this could be a thing, but it turns out that a paid service
called 0patch seems to have been around for a long time, and the
consensus seems to be that not only can it be trusted, it also sometimes
provides patches sooner than Microsoft does. Today, 0patch announced
it’ll also be providing this service for Windows 10 after the end of
support next year. With October 2025, 0patch will “security-adopt”
Windows 10 v22H2, and provide critical security patches for it for at
least 5 more years – even longer if there’s demand on the market. We’re
the only provider of unofficial security patches for Windows (“virtual
patches” are not really patches), and we have done this many times
before: after security-adopting Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 in
January 2020, we took care of 6 versions of Windows 10 as their official
support ended, security-adopted Windows 11 v21H2 to keep users who got
stuck there secure, took care of Windows Server 2012 in October 2023 and
adopted two popular Office versions – 2010 and 2013 – when they got
abandoned by Microsoft. We’re still providing security patches for all
of these. ↫ Mitja Kolsek on the 0patch blog This service implements
patching through what it calls “micropatches”, which are very small sets
of CPU instructions injected into running code in memory without
modifying – in this case – Microsoft’s own code. These micropatches are
applied by briefly stopping the offending program, injecting the fix,
and continuing the program – without having to close the program or
reboot. Of course, they can be unapplied in the same, non-disruptive
way. The 0patch service will provide patches for 0days that Microsoft
hasn’t fixed yet, patches for issues Microsoft won’t fix, and sometimes
patches for third party code. As the headline clearly states, this
service isn’t free, but honestly, at roughly 25 dollars plus tax per
computer per year, it’s not exactly expensive, and definitely cheaper
than Microsoft’s own Windows 10 Extended Security Update program it’s
going to offer for Windows 10 after the end of support date next year.
Diving a bit deeper into who is providing this service, it comes from a
company called ACROS Security, a small company out of Slovenia. The
company details its micropatches on its 0patch blog if you want more
information on how each individual ones works. I still don’t know
exactly what to make of this, and I definitely wouldn’t rely on
something like this for mission-critical Windows computers or servers,
but for something like a home PC that can’t be upgraded to Windows 11
but still works just fine, or perhaps some disposable virtual machines
you’re using, this might be a good stopgap solution until you can
upgrade to a better operating system, like Linux or one of the BSDs. Are
there any people in the OSNews audience who’ve used 0patch, or perhaps a
service similar to it?</p>

id="new-migration-patterns-could-fuel-is-plans-for-us-some-officials-contend">New
migration patterns could fuel IS plans for US, some officials
contend</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — Recent changes in global migration patterns and
smuggling routes have created an opening for terror groups like the
Islamic State to set their sights on the U.S. southern border.</p>
<p>For years, top U.S. counterterrorism officials have pushed back
against critics who sounded alarms about would-be terrorists streaming
across the U.S. border with Mexico. But changes within the past year
have increased the likelihood of such a reality.</p>
<p>“What we face today is a greater vulnerability to the possibility
that terrorist organizations might use that pathway to get individuals
into the United States,” according to Nick Rasmussen, the
counterterrorism coordinator for the Department of Homeland Security, or
DHS.</p>
<p>“The diversity of the migrant population arriving at our borders —
this is not in any way, shape or form a problem of the Western
Hemisphere,” Rasmussen told a conference Thursday in Omaha,
Nebraska.</p>
<p>“It’s a global migration problem with migrants from literally every
corner of the world, including from most conflict zones around the
world, showing up and arriving on our shores,” he said, describing the
convergence of the migration routes with concerns about terror groups
like Islamic State “relatively recent.”</p>
<p>Concerns about possible infiltration by migrants linked to the
Islamic State, also known as IS or ISIS, have spiked in recent
weeks.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, The New York Post reported the FBI arrested eight
men from Tajikistan who crossed the U.S.-Mexico border partly with the
help of an IS-linked network.</p>
<p>And earlier this week, NBC News reported more than 400 immigrants
from Central Asia crossed into the U.S., again with help from IS-linked
smugglers. Of those, some 150 have been arrested, while another 50
remain at large. The officials did not comment on the status of the
remaining 200.</p>
<p>Senior DHS officials say there is no evidence to suggest any of the
400 Central Asian migrants are IS operatives.</p>
<p>But officials have said the eight men from Tajikistan were arrested
because of potential ties to IS. All eight are in the middle of removal
hearings and face deportation.</p>
<p>U.S. officials have sought to allay concerns.</p>
<p>White House deputy homeland security adviser Jen Daskal told the
counterterrorism conference in Omaha on Wednesday that there is now
increased vigilance along the U.S. southern border.</p>
<p>“We have enhanced our screening and vetting, instituted recurrent
vetting of migrants to identify newly uncovered threats and detain those
who pose a public safety threat,” Daskal said. “We know that there is a
continued risk posed by those inspired by these terrorist organizations,
and we are acutely focused on that risk.”</p>
<p>Rasmussen, speaking a day later, likewise pushed back against fears
of a terrorist free for all.</p>
<p>“Most of the last decade there have been political critics who have
said that terrorists are streaming across the southern border, and we
could look at that analytically as our intelligence and law enforcement
really did, and say, no, that’s actually not happening,” he said. “I
would argue it’s not true today, as well.”</p>
<p>Rasmussen agreed, though, the newfound focus by groups like IS on
exploiting migration to the Western Hemisphere deserves immediate
attention.</p>
<p>The convergence of migration patterns and terrorism is “probably
highest on my worry and priority list today,” he said.</p>

id="closer-russia-north-korea-ties-may-create-opportunity-for-us-china">Closer
Russia-North Korea ties may create opportunity for US, China</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The recent defense pact between Russia and North Korea
could present a diplomatic opportunity for the United States and China
to work together for stability on the Korean Peninsula, an issue of
mutual interest to both countries, some experts say.</p>
<p>U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell said Monday that China
would be “somewhat anxious” about enhanced cooperation between Russia
and North Korea, adding that Chinese officials have “indicated so in
some of our interactions, and we can see some tension associated with
those things.”</p>
<p>White House national security spokesperson John Kirby told reporters
after the Russia-North Korea summit last week in Pyongyang that concern
about the new defense agreement between the two countries “would be
shared by the People’s Republic of China” — China’s official name.</p>
<p>During their keenly watched summit, Russian President Vladmir Putin
and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un signed a comprehensive strategic
partnership treaty, vowing to challenge the U.S.-led world order.</p>
<p>Under the treaty, the two countries, which share a short border along
the lower Tumen River, are now required to provide military assistance
using all available means if either of them is attacked by a third
country.</p>
<p>High-precision weapons</p>
<p>Putin further raised the stakes in this newly cemented relationship,
saying he is not ruling out the possibility of Russia providing
high-precision weapons to North Korea.</p>
<p>According to some experts in Washington, China’s frustration with its
two neighbors could make room for a Sino-American effort to dissuade
Russia and North Korea from moving forward with their nascent defense
pact.</p>
<p>Patrick Cronin, the Asia-Pacific security chair at the Hudson
Institute, told VOA’s Korean Service earlier this week that there is a
way for the U.S. to find “some common ground” with China on this
issue.</p>
<p>He explained that it is in China’s interest not to see the transfer
of Russia’s advanced, offensive military technologies to North Korea,
which could be destabilizing on the Korean Peninsula.</p>
<p>“That opens up a common ground for the United States to deal with
China to limit any destabilizing transfer of technology to the Korean
Peninsula,” he said.</p>
<p>Joseph DeTrani, who served as the special envoy for six-party
denuclearization talks with North Korea from 2003 to 2006, told VOA’s
Korean Service on Wednesday that the U.S. and China need to come
together on this issue.</p>
<p>DeTrani said North Korea has to be on the list of “the issues of
mutual concern” between the top two powers, as the U.S. pursues dialogue
with China on subjects such as artificial intelligence and trade.</p>
<p>Dennis Wilder, who served as senior director for East Asia affairs at
the White House’s National Security Council during the George W. Bush
administration, was more cautious about the possibility of U.S.-China
coordination.</p>
<p>Wilder told VOA’s Korean Service this week that the current state of
U.S.-China relations makes Beijing averse to working with Washington on
North Korea.</p>
<p>“No, they have no interest in joining with us, considering how they
feel we are treating them,” Wilder said. “I very much doubt that the
Chinese would be interested. A far possibility would be that they might
want to share information, but that would be the only place.”</p>
<p>No ties to call on</p>
<p>Robert Gallucci, who was the chief U.S. negotiator during the 1994
North Korea nuclear crisis, offered a similar view.</p>
<p>“We don’t have a relationship with Beijing right now that we could
call on,” he said earlier this week.</p>
<p>Gallucci told VOA’s Korean Service that China will not appreciate the
possibility of its influence on North Korea being undercut.</p>
<p>Gary Samore, who served as the White House coordinator for arms
control and weapons of mass destruction during the Obama administration,
told VOA’s Korean Service via email on Wednesday that China might have a
limited influence on what is happening between Russia and North Korea,
although Washington and Beijing share an interest in keeping things calm
on the Korean Peninsula.</p>
<p>“I expect that Beijing will discourage any military assistance from
Russia to North Korea that could be destabilizing,” he said. “Whether
Putin or Kim Jong Un will respect China’s wishes, I can’t say.”</p>
<p>Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, told
VOA’s Korean Service via email earlier this week that “in principle,
China welcomes Russia to consolidate and develop traditional friendly
relations with relevant countries,” without referring to North
Korea.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Washington is holding out hope that Beijing can still
leverage its historical ties with Pyongyang to drive a solution.</p>
<p>“We urge Beijing to use its influence to encourage the DPRK
[Democratic People’s Republic of Korea] to refrain from destabilizing
behavior and return to the negotiating table,” a State Department
spokesperson told VOA’s Korean Service on Wednesday.</p>

sanctions Iran over nuclear escalations, petroleum transport</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The United States on Thursday issued fresh sanctions
targeting Iran in response to “continued nuclear escalations,” U.S.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement.</p>
<p>“Over the past month, Iran has announced steps to further expand its
nuclear program in ways that have no credible peaceful purpose,” Blinken
said. “We remain committed to never letting Iran obtain a nuclear
weapon, and we are prepared to use all elements of national power to
ensure that outcome.”</p>
<p>Iran’s mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately
respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Thursday’s action imposes sanctions on three companies based in the
United Arab Emirates the U.S. accused of being involved in the transport
of Iranian petroleum or petrochemical products, as well as 11 associated
vessels.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the Group of Seven advanced industrialized
economies warned Iran against advancing its nuclear enrichment program,
and members said they would be ready to enforce new measures if Tehran
were to transfer ballistic missiles to Russia.</p>
<p>Iran rebuked the statement, calling on the G7 to distance itself from
“destructive policies of the past,” said Iranian Foreign Ministry
spokesperson Nasser Kanaani.</p>
<p>Earlier in June, the United Nations nuclear watchdog’s 35-nation
Board of Governors passed a resolution calling on Iran to step up
cooperation with the watchdog and reverse its recent barring of
inspectors.</p>
<p>Iran is enriching uranium to up to 60% purity — close to the 90% of
weapons grade — and has enough material enriched to that level, if
enriched further, for three nuclear weapons, according to an IAEA
yardstick.</p>
<p>Western powers say there is no credible civilian reason for that.
Iran says its aims are entirely peaceful, but officials have recently
said it could change its “nuclear doctrine” if it is attacked or its
existence was threatened by arch-foe Israel. That has prompted alarm at
the IAEA and in Western capitals.</p>

nonprofit sues ChatGPT maker OpenAI, Microsoft for ‘exploitative’
copyright infringement</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Los Angeles — The Center for Investigative Reporting said Thursday it
has sued ChatGPT maker OpenAI and its closest business partner,
Microsoft, marking a new front in the news industry’s fight against
unauthorized use of its content on artificial intelligence
platforms.</p>
<p>The nonprofit, which produces Mother Jones and Reveal, said that
OpenAI used its content without permission and without offering
compensation, violating copyrights on the organization’s journalism. The
lawsuit, filed in a New York federal court, describes OpenAI’s business
as “built on the exploitation of copyrighted works” and focuses on how
AI-generated summaries of articles threaten publishers.</p>
<p>“It’s immensely dangerous,” Monika Bauerlein, the nonprofit’s CEO,
told The Associated Press. “Our existence relies on users finding our
work valuable and deciding to support it.”</p>
<p>Bauerlein said that “when people can no longer develop that
relationship with our work, when they no longer encounter Mother Jones
or Reveal, then their relationship is with the AI tool.”</p>
<p>That, she said, could “cut the entire foundation of our existence as
an independent newsroom out from under us” while also threatening the
future of other news organizations.</p>
<p>OpenAI and Microsoft didn’t immediately respond to requests for
comment Thursday.</p>
<p>The lawsuit is the latest against OpenAI and Microsoft to land at
Manhattan’s federal court, where the companies are already battling a
series of other copyright lawsuits from The New York Times, other media
outlets and bestselling authors such as John Grisham, Jodi Picoult and
George R.R. Martin. The companies also face a separate case in San
Francisco’s federal court brought by authors including comedian Sarah
Silverman.</p>
<p>Some news organizations have chosen to collaborate rather than fight
with OpenAI by signing deals to get compensated for sharing news content
that can be used to train its AI systems. The latest to do so is Time
magazine, which announced Thursday that OpenAI will get access to its
“extensive archives from the last 101 years.”</p>
<p>OpenAI and other major AI developers don’t typically disclose their
data sources but have argued that taking troves of publicly accessible
online text, images and other media to train their AI systems is
protected by the “fair use” doctrine of American copyright law.</p>
<p>CIR’s lawsuit says a dataset that OpenAI has acknowledged using to
build an earlier version of its chatbot technology contained thousands
of links to the website of Mother Jones, a 48-year-old print magazine
that’s been publishing online since 1993. But the text used for AI
training was usually missing information about a story’s author, title
or copyright notice.</p>
<p>Last summer, more than 4,000 writers signed a letter to the CEOs of
OpenAI and other tech companies accusing them of exploitative practices
in building chatbots.</p>
<p>“It’s not a free resource for these AI companies to ingest and make
money on,” Bauerlein said of news media. “They pay for office space.
They pay for electricity. They pay salaries for their workers. Why would
the content that they ingest be the only thing that they don’t [pay
for]?”</p>
<p>The AP is among the news organizations that have made licensing deals
over the past year with OpenAI; others include The Wall Street Journal
and the New York Post publisher News Corp., The Atlantic, Axel Springer
in Germany and Prisa Media in Spain, France’s Le Monde newspaper and the
London-based Financial Times.</p>
<p>Mother Jones and CIR were both founded in the 1970s and merged
earlier this year. Both are based in San Francisco, as is OpenAI.</p>
<p>The lawsuit from CIR, also known for its Reveal podcast and radio
show, outlines the expense of producing investigative journalism and
warns that losing control of copyrighted content will result in less
revenue and even fewer reporters to tell important stories in “today’s
paltry media landscape.”</p>
<p>“With fewer investigative news stories told, the cost to democracy
will be enormous,” the lawsuit says.</p>

<h2 id="fixing-kwins-performance-on-old-hardware">Fixing KWin’s
performance on old hardware</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-27, from: OS News</p>
<p>KWin had a very long standing bug report about bad performance of the
Wayland session on older Intel integrated graphics. There have been many
investigations into what’s causing this, with a lot of more specific
performance issues being found and fixed, but none of them managed to
fully fix the issue… until now. ↫ Xaver Hugl An excellent deep dive into
a very annoying problem KWin on Wayland running on older Intel hardware
was facing. It turns out the issue was related to display timings, and
older Intel hardware simply not being powerful enough to render frames
within the timing window. The solution consisted of a various smaller
solutions, and one bigger one: triple-buffering. The end result is a
massive performance improvement for KWin on Wayland on older Intel
hardware. This detailed post underlines just how difficult it is to
simply render a bunch of windows and UI elements on time, without
stutters or tearing, while taking into account the wide variety of
hardware a project like KDE Plasma intends to run on. It’s great to see
them paying attention to the older, less powerful systems too, instead
of only focusing on the latest and greatest like Apple, and recently
Microsoft as well, do.</p>

maritime aggression seen as test of US-Philippine alliance</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>manila, Philippines — Analysts see China’s increasingly aggressive
attacks on Philippine vessels in the South China Sea as a test of the
U.S.-Philippines alliance. What happens next, they say, will depend
largely on how Manila and Washington respond. </p>
<p>Dramatic footage released last week by the Philippine military showed
Chinese coast guard personnel wielding knives, an ax and other weapons
as they intercepted Philippine soldiers who were in rubber boats
delivering supplies to a garrison at Second Thomas Shoal.  </p>
<p>The June 17 clash was the worst so far in the escalating tension in
the disputed waters, with several Philippine soldiers injured, including
one who lost a thumb, according to Manila. </p>
<p>But while the Philippines tried to de-escalate the tension with
diplomacy, analysts say future such incidents are likely.  </p>
<p>“China will seek to push the Philippines further,” said Don McLain
Gill, an international studies lecturer at De La Salle University in
Manila.  </p>
<p>“The main challenge here is to apply considerable cost on China in
order for it not to illustrate this sort of behavior and turn it into
something regular, like the same way it had regularized water canonning
and ramming [of Philippine vessels],” he told VOA. </p>
<p>There have been several incidents in the past months in which Chinese
coast guard ships blasted Philippine patrol boats with water cannons and
performed dangerous maneuvers in attempts to stop resupply missions to
Philippine troops stationed at the shoal. </p>
<p>The flash point of the conflict is the BRP Sierra Madre, a
dilapidated warship that Manila deliberately ran aground in 1999 to
stake its claim to Second Thomas Shoal, a maritime feature in the
Spratly Islands that is within the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone.
 </p>
<p>China claims almost the entirety of the South China Sea, including
the Spratly chain, based on historical maps that an international
tribunal has ruled have no legal basis.</p>
<p>Parallel strand of negotiation</p>
<p>Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., in his first media
interview since the incident, acknowledged Thursday that more must be
done than to just file diplomatic protests against China. </p>
<p>“We have [lodged] more than 100 protests already. … [What usually
happens is] we summon the ambassador, we tell him our position, that we
don’t want what happened, and that’s it. But we have to do more than
that, so we are. We are doing more than just that,” Marcos told
reporters Thursday, without elaborating. </p>
<p>But Collin Koh, a fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International
Studies in Singapore, said there must also be a “parallel strand of
negotiation and dialogue” between China and the United States to
de-escalate the tension. </p>
<p>The United States is a treaty ally of the Philippines and is
obligated to defend Manila against external armed attack, including in
areas in the South China Sea. </p>
<p>Given the high stakes for all three countries, Koh said, China might
listen to another superpower.  </p>
<p>“I think in large part it will depend very greatly on U.S. signaling
explicitly to China on things that it should refrain from doing, and it
must come with a very explicit threat of repercussions or consequences,”
Koh told VOA. </p>
<p>“If the messaging isn’t done clearly, then we are going to see a
repetition of what’s happening,” he added. </p>
<p>Mutual defense treaty </p>
<p>Marcos has ruled out invoking the mutual defense treaty over the
latest incident, saying it could not be considered an “armed
attack.” </p>
<p>Marcos had earlier said he wanted a review of the treaty, which was
signed in 1951, to respond to the changing security challenges in the
region.  </p>
<p>The recent escalation might provide urgency for Washington and Manila
“to expedite the process of defining particular provisions and enhancing
consultations,” according to Gill of De La Salle University. </p>
<p>One such clarification was provided earlier this year by Marcos, who
said the death of a Philippine serviceman in “an attack or an aggressive
action by another foreign power” could trigger the treaty.  </p>
<p>This specific requirement, however, might work in China’s favor.</p>
<p>“If you set the bar so high, then it means that you are allowing
China to keep doing whatever it is doing just under that threshold,” Koh
said, although he agreed that it was not yet necessary to activate the
treaty.  </p>
<p>“Nobody died and there were no other serious injuries other than the
poor guy who lost his thumb. The question is: Are we going to be lucky
in the future like that?” Koh asked.</p>

2023 fires spewed more heat-trapping gas than millions of cars</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Catastrophic Canadian wildfires last year pumped more
heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the air than India did by burning
fossil fuels, setting ablaze an area of forest larger than the U.S.
state of West Virginia, new research finds.</p>
<p>Scientists at the World Resources Institute and the University of
Maryland calculated how devastating the impacts were of the monthslong
fires in Canada in 2023 that sullied the air around large parts of the
globe. They figured it put 2.98 billion metric tons of heat-trapping
carbon dioxide into the air, according to a study update published in
Thursday’s Global Change Biology. The update is not peer-reviewed, but
the original study was.</p>
<p>The fire spewed nearly four times the carbon emissions as airplanes
do in a year, study authors said. It’s about the same amount of carbon
dioxide that 647 million cars put in the air in a year, based on U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency data.</p>
<p>Forests “remove a lot of carbon from the atmosphere and that gets
stored in their branches, their trunks, their leaves and kind of in the
ground as well. So, when they burn all the carbon that’s stored within
them, [it] gets released back into the atmosphere,” said the study’s
lead author, James MacCarthy, a research associate with WRI’s Global
Forest Watch.</p>
<p>When and if trees grow back, much of that can be recovered, MacCarthy
said, adding, “It definitely does have an impact on the global scale in
terms of the amount of emissions that were produced in 2023.”</p>
<p>MacCarthy and colleagues calculated that the forest burned totaled
77,574 square kilometers (29,951 square miles), which is six times more
than the average from 2001 to 2022. The wildfires in Canada made up 27%
of global tree cover loss last year; usually it’s closer to 6%,
MacCarthy’s figures show.</p>
<p>These are far more than regular forest fires, but researchers focused
only on tree cover loss, which is a bigger effect, said study co-author
Alexandra Tyukavina, a geography professor at the University of
Maryland.</p>
<p>Syracuse University geography and environment professor Jacob Bendix,
who wasn’t part of the study, said, “The loss of that much forest is a
very big deal, and very worrisome.</p>
<p>“Although the forest will eventually grow back and sequester carbon
in doing so, that is a process that will take decades at a minimum, so
that there is a quite substantial lag between addition of atmospheric
carbon due to wildfire and the eventual removal of at least some of it
by the regrowing forest,” he said.</p>
<p>“So, over the course of those decades, the net impact of the fires is
a contribution to climate warming.”</p>
<p>It’s more than just adding to heat-trapping gases and losing forests;
there were health consequences as well, Tyukavina said.</p>
<p>“Because of these catastrophic fires, air quality in populated areas
and cities was affected last year,” she said, mentioning New York City’s
smog-choked summer. More than 200 communities with about 232,000
residents had to be evacuated, according to another not-yet-published or
peer-reviewed study by Canadian forest and fire experts.</p>
<p>One of the authors of the Canadian study, fire expert Mike Flannigan
at Thompson Rivers University in Kamloops, British Columbia, puts the
acreage burned at twice what MacCarthy and Tyukavina do.</p>
<p>“The 2023 fire season in Canada was [an] exceptional year in any time
period,” Flannigan, who wasn’t part of the WRI study, said in an email.
“I expect more fire in our future, but years like 2023 will be
rare.”</p>
<p>Flannigan, Bendix, Tyukavina and MacCarthy all said climate change
played a role in Canada’s big burn. A warmer world means a longer fire
season, more lightning-caused fires and especially drier wood and brush
to catch fire “associated with increased temperature,” Flannigan
wrote.</p>
<p>The average May-to-October temperature in Canada last year was almost
2.2 degrees Celsius warmer than normal, his study found. Some parts of
Canada were 8 to 10 degrees Celsius hotter than average in May and June,
MaCarthy said.</p>
<p>There’s short-term variability within trends, so it’s hard to blame
one specific year and area on climate change, and geographic factors
play a role, Bendix said in an email, but still, “there is no doubt that
climate change is the principal driver of the global increases in
wildfire.”</p>
<p>With the world warming from climate change, Tyukavina said, “The
catastrophic years are probably going to be happening more often, and we
are going to see those spikier years more often.”</p>

<h2 id="us-denies-zimbabwes-claims-it-is-militarizing-zambia">US denies
Zimbabwe’s claims it is militarizing Zambia</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>HARARE, ZIMBABWE — The head of U.S. Africa Command denied Thursday
claims by Zimbabwean government officials that Washington is setting up
a military base in neighboring Zambia and wants to move AFRICOM
operations there from Germany.</p>
<p>At an online press briefing, General Michael Langley, head of
AFRICOM, rejected Zimbabwe’s claims that the United States is
establishing a base in neighboring Zambia.</p>
<p>“That’s absolutely false,” Langley said from an African Chiefs of
Defense Conference in Botswana. “We have no bases in Zambia. We have no
plans to put one there.”</p>
<p>He said the U.S.’s approach on the continent is “African-led and
U.S.-enabled.”</p>
<p>“We have a deep partnership with Zambia,” he said. “We have increased
security cooperation with them. But there is no footprint. There’s no
posture. There’s no base.”</p>
<p>Zimbabwean officials declined to comment to VOA about Langley’s
remarks. But Rutendo Matinyarare, chairperson of the pro-government
Zimbabwe Anti-Sanctions Movement, alleged that Langley held a briefing
in Lusaka and that the U.S. was setting up the AFRICOM hub in
Zambia.</p>
<p>Matinyarare claimed that several businesspeople who have flown into
the country have seen a substantial amount of American military
equipment at Zambia’s airport.</p>
<p>“And so, the question is, ‘What are these weapons doing in Zambia?’”
he said.</p>
<p>Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema denies that his country is being
militarized by the U.S. He says Zambia’s army has exchange programs with
a number of countries, including the U.S., which should not be mistaken
for the U.S. establishing a base.</p>
<p>Zambia says it has called on two regional bodies — the African Union
and the Southern African Development Community — to mediate talks with
Zimbabwe. Zambia and Zimbabwe are members of both organizations.</p>
<p>Zambian officials have also said the fallout stems from comments that
Zimbabwean President Emerson Mnangagwa made during a recent trip to
Russia — namely, the accusation that the U.S. has been militarizing
Zambia to consolidate power in the region and isolate Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>Western countries imposed travel and financial sanctions on
Zimbabwe’s leadership and affiliated companies in the early 2000s for
alleged election rigging and human rights abuses. The U.S. recently
removed sanctions on most Zimbabweans, but a few prominent figures —
including Mnangagwa — remain on the list.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Langley told reporters that top regional security
challenges throughout Africa were discussed at the just-ended defense
conference.</p>
<p>“Our African partners want this conference here because they want to
own it. But we are AFRICOM, and the U.S. government is here because we
have common values, common objectives, that will affect stability,
security and prosperity on the continent,” he said.</p>
<p>This year’s conference provided a “valuable wealth of information”
and lessons ahead of talks next year, Langley said.</p>

<h2 id="will-this-be-the-hottest-presidential-debate-ever">Will This Be
the Hottest Presidential Debate Ever?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-27, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjUwODk4Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1MzY0MTkyNn0.pbW1q2DycZVdPmnamScWJ0gpGEcEXvnlhTE8aOk0KCY/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
In spite of a deadly heat wave that has seen temperatures touch 100
degrees Fahrenheit and a first-ever summer date, today’s presidential
debate in Atlanta won’t even come close to being the hottest ever.
Temperatures will reach 84 degrees this afternoon and are forecasted to
settle around 80 degrees by the time the debate begins at 9 p.m.
Eastern.
</p>
<p>
This is the first presidential debate not to be held in September or
October, when most American cities have started to cool down. And of the
cities that have hosted debates, just four are further south Atlanta.
Yet this is just the eighth-hottest debate in history.
</p>
<center>
<iframe aria-label="Scatter Plot" data-external="1" frameborder="0" height="466" id="datawrapper-chart-D1plG" scrolling="no" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/D1plG/8/" style="border: none;" title="Debate-day highs over the years" width="680">
</iframe>
</center>
<p>
The story would’ve been different if the debate had been held in any of
the past six days. Thermometers in Atlanta have hit 93 degrees all week
— which would’ve made this debate the hottest ever.
</p>
<p>
Even more remarkably, there have been <em><em>three</em></em> previous
debates on days when temperatures surpassed 90 degrees.
</p>
<p>
The high of 92 degrees the day of the third presidential debate in 2004
between then-President George W. Bush and his Democratic challenger John
Kerry was ordinary for a mid-October day in Tempe, Arizona, where the
debate was held. There, temperatures regularly reach into the 90s late
into the month.
</p>
<p>
But the September 21, 1980 presidential debate in Baltimore between
insurgent Republican nominee Ronald Reagan and Independent John B.
Anderson (Democrat Jimmy Carter, the incumbent, declined the invitation)
saw temperatures soar about 14 degrees higher than average, reaching 90
degrees. And in San Francisco on October 6, 1976, the thermometer also
hit 90 degrees — more than 20 degrees above the average for the city at
that time of year.
</p>
<p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="Map of debate day high temperatures relative to average." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="b495c0e5bbe1d7f615e25506cfd0a2e0" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="5af2e" loading="lazy" src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjUxMzQ0Ni9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2MjUzMjYzOX0.YaWTTQEOQF5s5JukLu9OzU6Uk6ujXd9CHR1qWzhs12Q/image.png?width=980"/>
</p>
<p>
On average, debate-day high temperatures have been trending higher in
recent years. But in truth, there aren’t many conclusions to be drawn
from that metric. Temperatures can vary widely from day to day, and this
will be only the 36th general-election presidential debate since
then-candidates John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon faced off for the
first time on national television in 1960. That doesn’t give us a huge
data set to work with.
</p>

</iframe>
</center>
<p>
Of the four cities that have hosted 90 degree debates, temperature
variability is especially pronounced in Baltimore, where at least 23
days out of the past year have been 10 degrees hotter or cooler than the
day before. The figure is lower but still pronounced for Atlanta, San
Francisco, and Tempe, underscoring the difficulty of drawing reliable
conclusions on the trajectory of debate-day forecasts. <br/>
</p>

</iframe>
</center>
<p>
Plus, every debate has been held in the evening, after heat has subsided
for the day. On that scorching day in San Francisco, for instance,
temperatures had fallen to the 70s by the time Carter and then-President
Gerald Ford were making their opening statements.
</p>
<p>
But even if presidential debates go back to their usual early autumn
time slot, we might still see a rise in debate temperatures as the
seasons themselves change. One 2021
<a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2020GL091753" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>study</u></a>
found that climate change had increased the length of summer by 17 days
from 1952 to 2011, while spring, autumn, and winter all lost days. By
2100, summer could last up to half the year, the study found.

id="reports-of-visa-checks-deportations-worry-chinese-stem-students-in-us">Reports
of visa checks, deportations worry Chinese STEM students in US</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Geopolitical tensions and growing competition in tech
between the United States and China appear to be spilling over into
academia despite commitments from the world’s two biggest economies to
boost people-to-people exchanges.</p>
<p>The United States remains the top choice for Chinese students seeking
to study abroad with nearly 300,000 studying in American colleges and
universities during the 2022-2023 school year. But reports of some cases
that students and professors are facing extra scrutiny while passing
through immigration and the deportation of others are raising
concerns.</p>
<p>For Chen Xiaojin, a doctoral student studying semiconductor materials
at a university in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area, it has been
six years since she returned to her hometown of Beijing.</p>
<p>At first, it was the COVID-19 pandemic that kept her from going home.
But over the past two years, she has been deterred by accounts of
Chinese students majoring in science and engineering being required to
reapply for their visas upon returning to China.</p>
<p>She also says she is worried by reports over the past six months of
Chinese students being deported, even at nearby Dulles Airport.</p>
<p>“My current research is relatively sensitive, and my boss [adviser]
is getting funds from the U.S. Department of Defense, making it even
more sensitive,” she told VOA. “I am afraid that I won’t be able to
return after I go back [to China].”</p>
<p>Chen says that if she did return to China, she would have to apply
for a new visa.</p>
<p>In a report late last month, Bloomberg said it had found at least 20
Chinese students and scholars with valid visas who were deported at U.S.
Customs since November and barred from reentry. The U.S. Customs and
Border Protection Agency does not release relevant data.</p>
<p>Immigration attorney Dan Berger represented one Chinese student who
was deported late last year. He tells VOA Mandarin that the student
studied biological sciences at Yale University and was about to complete
her doctorate.</p>
<p>She visited her family in China and got a new visa but was deported
by customs at Dulles Airport and barred from reentering the country for
five years. Berger said he did not see anything suspicious in the
transcript of the conversation between the student and the customs
officer.</p>
<p>“We have seen what seems like a pattern over the last six months of
Chinese PhD students being turned around…. more than I’ve seen in quite
a while,” he said.</p>
<p>Matthew Brazil, a fellow at the Jamestown Foundation, said neither
country seems willing to explain the situation. However, he believes
that in most cases, the United States must have valid reasons for
blocking visa holders from entering the country.</p>
<p>In some cases, the student’s background may not match what is written
on the visa application. In other cases, customs agents may also find
something that the State Department missed, and once they see it, they
are responsible for taking action.</p>
<p>“I wish the Chinese side would be specific about their students who
were refused entry,” he said. “The fact that both sides are mum on
details and that the Chinese side is engaged with the usual angry
rhetoric means that each has security concerns. And that says to me that
there was good reason for the U.S. to stop these particular
applicants.”</p>
<p>Brazil also sees a connection between the entry denials and export
control regulations issued by the United States in October 2022 that
restrict China’s ability to obtain advanced computing chips, develop and
maintain supercomputers, and manufacture advanced semiconductors.</p>
<p>U.S. Customs and Border Protection is one of the law enforcement
agencies authorized to investigate violations of export control
regulations, he said.</p>
<p>“Beijing’s intelligence agencies are known to focus attention on PRC
[People’s Republic of China] students and scientists headed abroad who
study or work on dual-use technologies controlled under the Export
Administration Act — compelling Chinese students and scientists to
report on what they’ve learned when they return to China on holiday,” he
said. “This has been true for decades.”</p>
<p>Bill Drexel, a fellow for the Technology and National Security
Program at the Center for a New American Security, said the U.S.
government did find some cases where students tried to steal strategic
technology for China.</p>
<p>“I think it would both not be surprising that they found some really
questionable or incriminating evidence for some students,” he said. “It
would also not be surprising if, in their hunt for really solid
evidence, they also may have made some mistakes on other students.”</p>
<p>Drexel adds that “it’s just kind of an unfortunate fact of the time
that we live in and the tactics that the CCP uses when it comes to these
measures.”</p>
<p>In a post on X in early May, U.S. ambassador to China Nicholas Burns
tried to dispel concerns about visas and entry to the United States for
students and scholars. In the post, he said “99.9% of Chinese students
holding visas encounter no issues upon entering the United States.”</p>
<p>In an interview with The Wall Street Journal Monday, Burns said it is
China that is making it impossible to promote people-to-people ties.
Burns told the Journal that students attending events sponsored by the
United States in China have been interrogated and intimidated.</p>
<p>He also said that since U.S. President Joe Biden and China’s leader
Xi Jinping held their summit in San Francisco last year, China’s
Ministry of State Security and other agencies had interfered with
Chinese citizens’ participation at some 61 events.</p>
<p>At a regular briefing on Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesperson Mao Ning dismissed those accusations, saying that they did
not “reflect reality” and that went against key understandings reached
by both countries’ presidents in San Francisco.</p>
<p>“The United States, under the pretext of ‘national security,’
unjustifiably harasses, interrogates, and deports Chinese students in
the U.S., causing them significant harm and creating a severe chilling
effect,” Mao said. “The image of the United States in the minds of the
Chinese people fundamentally depends on the actions of the United States
itself.”</p>
<p>Drexel said he believes Burns’ comments about visas and students’
willingness to study in the U.S. still ring true.</p>
<p>“On balance, it’s still the case that American universities are
overwhelmingly warm towards Chinese students and want them in large
numbers,” he said.</p>
<p>However, Berger, the immigration lawyer, is concerned about the
chilling effect recent cases involving Chinese students could have.</p>
<p>“In general, we are being more careful about advising Chinese
graduate students in STEM fields about traveling and letting them know
that there is some small risk,” he said.</p>
<p>Even though the risk is small, it does seem to be real at the moment,
he said.</p>

<h2 id="ferc-says-yes-to-the-lng-terminal">FERC Says Yes to the LNG
Terminal</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-27, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjUxMTUyNS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4MjIzNTU2NH0.bHFtHzEuq57UYvGvjJ2cljSt__QXAi3IWiq02KhmcOM/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
The Department of Energy may not be ready to say yes to more liquified
natural gas export projects, but the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission is. In a meeting on Thursday, FERC approved plans for a
massive LNG terminal project in Louisiana by a 2-1 vote, with Allison
Clements, an outgoing Democratic commissioner, as the lone dissenter.
</p>
<p>
The Calcasieu Pass 2, or CP2, project would install some 20 million
metric tons of export capacity in a hurricane-battered coastal Louisiana
community near the Texas border. You may have heard of it if you
followed the drama in January around the Biden administration’s decision
to
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/biden-lng-exports-pause-young-voters-climate" rel="noopener" target="_self">pause</a>
approving new LNG export terminals, which will allow the DOE to
reexamine how it assesses whether new energy projects are in the “public
interest.”
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/house-lng-hearing-ukraine-emissions" target="_blank">Republicans
haven’t stopped talking about it since</a>, arguing that the pause
chokes off a major American export and that it both was tantamount to a
fossil fuel ban and that it undermined the administration’s climate
goals. Democrats — especially those running for reelection in swing
states — have been lukewarm.
</p>
<p>
CP2 has enjoyed
<a href="https://venturegloballng.com/press/venture-global-and-louisiana-governor-john-bel-edwards-announce-proposed-cp2-lng-export-facility/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>bipartisan
political support</u></a> within Louisiana but became a target for
national and local environmental groups who want the Biden
administration to do more to prevent the development of new fossil fuel
resources. These groups argued that CP2 would both
“<a href="https://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/2023/12/11/cp2-lng/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lock
in</a>” substantial greenhouse gas emissions from the extraction and
transport of natural gas (one former Environmental Protection Agency
official called it a “carbon mega bomb”) and have deleterious
environmental effects on an area that’s already heavily industrialized.
</p>
<p>
“Venture Global is a bad actor in the energy space and FERC is enabling
them to start another disastrous project that puts polluters over
people,” the Sierra Club’s Cathy Collentine said in a statement. “CP2 is
an environmental justice, climate, and economic disaster waiting to
happen, and with this decision, FERC has ignored the harm that will be
caused by CP2 — and gas exports more broadly — and sided with the greedy
fossil fuel industry.”
</p>
<p>
FERC evaluated CP2’s environmental impacts last year and concluded that
they would be “less than significant,” but that the “visual resources”
of the area would see “significant adverse effect” — in other words, it
would be an ugly and permanent addition to the landscape.
</p>
<p>
But final approval has been delayed for months, much to the annoyance of
the industry. FERC released its final environmental impact statement in
July of last year, making the wait for approval one of “the longest to
sit before the commission,” according to <em>Bloomberg</em>. The climate
effect of LNG exports is a
<a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-episode-1-lng" target="_self"><u>matter
of some debate</u></a>, with some researchers arguing that if LNG is
replacing fuels with
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/lng-exports-pause-biden-emissions" target="_self"><u>higher
associated emissions</u></a>, it can lead to lower overall global
emissions over time.
</p>
<p>
LNG projects exist in a kind of regulatory Venn diagram. While FERC has
jurisdiction over natural gas pipelines, natural gas exports to
countries that don’t have free trade agreements with the U.S. — which
make up the bulk of the natural gas market — requires DOE approval, and
that’s still in limbo. “No major LNG terminal has ever reached a final
investment decision or started construction without this critical export
authorization,” the Sierra Club noted in its statement.

<h2
id="boeing-sanctioned-over-release-of-737-max-investigation-details">Boeing
sanctioned over release of 737 MAX investigation details</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON/SEATTLE — U.S. investigators on Thursday sanctioned Boeing
for revealing details of a probe into a 737 MAX mid-air blowout and said
they would refer its conduct to the Justice Department, prompting the
embattled planemaker to issue an apology.</p>
<p>The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said Boeing had
“blatantly violated” its rules by providing “non-public investigative
information” and speculating about possible causes of the Jan. 5 Alaska
Airlines ALK.N door-plug emergency during a factory tour attended by
dozens of journalists.</p>
<p>The decision sheds new light on strains between the crisis-hit
planemaker and government agencies at a time when it is trying to avoid
criminal charges being weighed by the Department of Justice (DOJ) ahead
of a July 7 deadline.</p>
<p>“As a party to many NTSB investigations over the past decades, few
entities know the rules better than Boeing,” the NTSB said.</p>
<p>The NTSB said Boeing would keep its status as a party to the
investigation into the Jan. 5 Alaska Airlines emergency but would no
longer see information produced during its probe into the accident,
which involved the mid-air blowout of a door plug with four missing
bolts.</p>
<p>Unlike other parties, Boeing will now not be allowed to ask questions
of other participants at a hearing on August 6-7.</p>
<p>“We deeply regret that some of our comments, intended to make clear
our responsibility in the accident and explain the actions we are
taking, overstepped the NTSB’s role as the source of investigative
information,” Boeing said in a statement.</p>
<p>The NTSB’s criticism revolves around comments made during a media
briefing about quality improvements on Tuesday at the 737 factory near
Seattle - widely seen as part of an exercise to showcase greater
transparency ahead of the Farnborough Airshow.</p>
<p>During the briefing, which was held on Tuesday under an embargo
allowing contents to be published on Thursday, an executive said the
plug had been opened on the assembly line without the correct paperwork
to fix a quality issue with surrounding rivets, and that missing bolts
were not replaced.  </p>
<p>The team that came in and closed the plug was not responsible for
reinstalling the bolts, Elizabeth Lund, Boeing’s senior vice president
of quality, added.</p>
<p>The NTSB said that by providing investigative information and giving
an analysis of information already released, Boeing had contravened its
agreement with the agency.</p>
<p>“Boeing offered opinions and analysis on factors it suggested were
causal to the accident,” it added.</p>
<p>In May, the DOJ said Boeing had violated a 2021 settlement with
prosecutors that shielded it from criminal charges over interactions
with the Federal Aviation Administration prior to MAX crashes in 2018
and 2019 that killed 346 people.</p>
<p>U.S. prosecutors have recommended criminal charges be brought,
Reuters reported on Sunday. The DOJ already has a separate criminal
probe into the door-plug episode.</p>
<p>Thursday’s rare exchange marks the latest sign of strains between
Boeing and the NTSB.  </p>
<p>In 2018, Boeing was widely criticized for issuing a statement
appearing to question the performance of pilots in the first of two
fatal crashes that led to a grounding of the MAX. Later investigations
emphasized the role of flawed software.</p>
<p>In March this year, NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy told a U.S. Senate
hearing Boeing had failed to provide names of employees on its 737 MAX
door team for two months, drawing criticism from lawmakers. Boeing then
quickly provided the names.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the NTSB said Boeing had portrayed its investigation of
the Alaska air incident to media as a search to locate the individual
responsible for plug work.</p>
<p>“The NTSB is instead focused on the probable cause of the accident,
not placing blame on any individual or assessing liability,” the agency
said.</p>
<p>Asked during Tuesday’s briefing who had failed to fill in
documentation, Lund said: “There may have been one or more than one
employee. What I will say is the ‘who’ is absolutely in the
responsibility of the NTSB. That investigation is still going on and I
am going to not comment on that right now”.</p>
<p>The role of individuals is a particularly sensitive topic in air
safety amid an increasing focus on litigation and, in some countries, a
trend towards criminalizing air accidents.</p>
<p>Under global rules, agencies carry out civil probes into air
accidents for the sole purpose of finding the cause and making
recommendations to improve safety in future. Such actions are separate
from any judicial probes seeking to attribute blame.</p>
<p>Aviation experts say an 80-year-old international treaty that
encourages people to speak freely and focus on causes rather than blame
allowed the industry to cut the number of accidents dramatically since
the start of the jet age, but depends on curbing any special pleading by
the parties involved.</p>
<p>Critics, including some lawyers, say this system does not
sufficiently take account of the need of the families of victims for
detailed answers.</p>
<p>In 2013, the NTSB barred United Parcel ServiceUPS.N and its pilots
union from an investigation of a crash in Alabama that killed two UPS
pilots.  </p>
<p>In 2018, it removed Tesla as a party to an investigation into a fatal
crash involving a vehicle’s “Autopilot” system. Tesla hit back publicly,
saying it had already decided to withdraw and accusing the NTSB of
violating its own rules.</p>

id="supreme-court-rejects-us-opioid-settlement-with-purdue-pharma">Supreme
Court rejects US opioid settlement with Purdue Pharma</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The Supreme Court on Thursday rejected a nationwide
settlement with OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma that would have shielded
members of the Sackler family who own the company from civil lawsuits
over the toll of opioids but also would have provided billions of
dollars to combat the opioid epidemic.</p>
<p>After deliberating more than six months, the justices in a 5-4 vote
blocked an agreement hammered out with state and local governments and
victims. The Sacklers would have contributed up to $6 billion and given
up ownership of the company but retained billions more. The agreement
provided that the company would emerge from bankruptcy as a different
entity, with its profits used for treatment and prevention.</p>
<p>Justice Neil Gorsuch, writing for the majority, said “nothing in
present law authorizes the Sackler discharge.”</p>
<p>Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Brett Kavanaugh, Elena Kagan
and Sonia Sotomayor dissented.</p>
<p>“Opioid victims and other future victims of mass torts will suffer
greatly in the wake of today’s unfortunate and destabilizing decision,”
Kavanaugh wrote.</p>
<p>The high court had put the settlement on hold last summer, in
response to objections from the Biden administration.</p>
<p>It’s unclear what happens next.</p>
<p>“Today’s Supreme Court ruling marks a major setback for the families
who lost loved ones to overdose and for those still struggling with
addiction,” Edward Neiger, a lawyer representing more than 60,000
overdose victims, said in a statement.</p>
<p>“The Purdue plan was a victim-centered plan that would provide
billions of dollars to the states to be used exclusively to abate the
opioid crisis and $750 million for victims of the crisis, so that they
could begin to rebuild their lives. As a result of the senseless
three-year crusade by the government against the plan, thousands of
people died of overdose, and today’s decision will lead to more needless
overdose deaths.”</p>
<p>An opponent of the settlement praised the outcome.</p>
<p>Ed Bisch’s 18-year-old son Eddie, died from an overdose after taking
OxyContin in Philadelphia in 2001.</p>
<p>The older Bisch, who lives in New Jersey, has been speaking out
against Purdue and Sackler family members ever since and is part of a
relatively small but vocal group of victims and family members who
opposed the settlement.</p>
<p>“This is a step toward justice. It was outrageous what they were
trying to get away with,” he said Thursday. “They have made a mockery of
the justice system and then they tried to make a mockery of the
bankruptcy system.”</p>
<p>He said he would have accepted the deal if he thought it would have
made a dent in the opioid crisis.</p>
<p>He’s now calling on the Department of Justice to seek criminal
charges against Sackler family members</p>
<p>Arguments in early December lasted nearly two hours in a packed
courtroom as the justices seemed, by turns, unwilling to disrupt a
carefully negotiated settlement and reluctant to reward the
Sacklers.</p>
<p>The issue for the justices was whether the legal shield that
bankruptcy provides can be extended to people such as the Sacklers, who
have not declared bankruptcy themselves. Lower courts had issued
conflicting decisions over that issue, which also has implications for
other major product liability lawsuits settled through the bankruptcy
system.</p>
<p>The U.S. Bankruptcy Trustee, an arm of the Justice Department, argued
that the bankruptcy law does not permit protecting the Sackler family
from being sued. During the Trump administration, the government
supported the settlement.</p>
<p>The Biden administration had argued to the court that negotiations
could resume, and perhaps lead to a better deal, if the court were to
stop the current agreement.</p>
<p>Proponents of the plan said third-party releases are sometimes
necessary to forge an agreement, and federal law imposes no prohibition
against them.</p>
<p>OxyContin first hit the market in 1996, and Purdue Pharma’s
aggressive marketing of it is often cited as a catalyst of the
nationwide opioid epidemic, with doctors persuaded to prescribe
painkillers with less regard for addiction dangers.</p>
<p>The drug and the Stamford, Connecticut-based company became
synonymous with the crisis, even though the majority of pills being
prescribed and used were generic drugs. Opioid-related overdose deaths
have continued to climb, hitting 80,000 in recent years. Most of those
are from fentanyl and other synthetic drugs.</p>
<p>The Purdue Pharma settlement would have ranked among the largest
reached by drug companies, wholesalers and pharmacies to resolve
epidemic-related lawsuits filed by state, local and Native American
tribal governments and others. Those settlements have totaled more than
$50 billion.</p>
<p>But the Purdue Pharma settlement would have been only the second so
far to include direct payments to victims from a $750 million pool.
Payouts would have ranged from about $3,500 to $48,000.</p>
<p>Sackler family members no longer are on the company’s board, and they
have not received payouts from it since before Purdue Pharma entered
bankruptcy. In the decade before that, though, they were paid more than
$10 billion, about half of which family members said went to pay
taxes.</p>

It seems to me that this particular problem can be solved if the
compiler marks the formal parameter, which is (possibly) returned by
reference, and checks the actual parameter when calling the procedure.
This will not solve all problems with returning by reference, but it
will eliminate a significant number of errors.

Court halts enforcement of the EPA’s plan to limit downwind pollution
from power plants</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court is putting the Environmental
Protection Agency’s air pollution-fighting “good neighbor” plan on hold
while legal challenges continue, the conservative-led court’s latest
blow to federal regulations.</p>
<p>The justices in a 5-4 vote on Thursday rejected arguments by the
Biden administration and Democratic-controlled states that the plan was
cutting air pollution and saving lives in 11 states where it was being
enforced and that the high court’s intervention was unwarranted.</p>
<p>The rule is intended to restrict smokestack emissions from power
plants and other industrial sources that burden downwind areas with
smog-causing pollution. It will remain on hold while the federal appeals
court in Washington considers a challenge to the plan from industry and
Republican-led states.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court, with a 6-3 conservative majority, has increasingly
reined in the powers of federal agencies, including the EPA, in recent
years. The justices have restricted the EPA’s authority to fight air and
water pollution — including a landmark 2022 ruling that limited the
EPA’s authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from power plants
that contribute to global warming. The court also shot down a vaccine
mandate and blocked President Joe Biden’s student loan forgiveness
program.</p>
<p>The court is currently weighing whether to overturn its 40-year-old
Chevron decision, which has been the basis for upholding a wide range of
regulations on public health, workplace safety and consumer
protections.</p>
<p>Three energy-producing states — Ohio, Indiana and West Virginia —
have challenged the air pollution rule, along with the steel industry
and other groups, calling it costly and ineffective. They had asked the
high court to put it on hold while their challenge makes it way through
the courts.</p>
<p>The challengers pointed to decisions in courts around the country
that have paused the rule in a dozen states, arguing that those
decisions have undermined the EPA’s aim of providing a national solution
to the problem of ozone pollution because the agency relied on the
assumption that all 23 states targeted by the rule would
participate.</p>
<p>The issue came to the court on an emergency basis, which almost
always results in an order from the court without arguments before the
justices.</p>
<p>But not this time. The court heard arguments in late February, when a
majority of the court seemed skeptical of arguments from the
administration and New York, representing Democratic states, that the
“good neighbor” rule was important to protect downwind states that
receive unwanted air pollution from other states.</p>
<p>The EPA has said power plant emissions dropped by 18% last year in
the 10 states where it has been allowed to enforce its rule, which was
finalized a year ago. Those states are Illinois, Indiana, Maryland,
Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and
Wisconsin. In California, limits on emissions from industrial sources
other than power plants are supposed to take effect in 2026.</p>
<p>The rule is on hold in another dozen states because of separate legal
challenges. Those states are Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana,
Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah and West
Virginia.</p>
<p>States that contribute to ground-level ozone, or smog, are required
to submit plans ensuring that coal-fired power plants and other
industrial sites don’t add significantly to air pollution in other
states. In cases in which a state has not submitted a “good neighbor”
plan — or in which the EPA disapproves a state plan — the federal plan
was supposed to ensure that downwind states are protected.</p>
<p>Ground-level ozone, which forms when industrial pollutants chemically
react in the presence of sunlight, can cause respiratory problems,
including asthma and chronic bronchitis. People with compromised immune
systems, the elderly and children playing outdoors are particularly
vulnerable.</p>

<h2 id="carbon-removals-existential-question">Carbon Removal’s
Existential Question</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-27, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
Carbon removal would seem to have a pretty clear definition. It’s the
reverse of carbon emissions. It means taking carbon out of the
atmosphere and putting it somewhere else — underground, into products,
into the ocean — where it won’t warm the planet. But a new kind of
carbon removal project shows how this formula can conceal consequential
differences between approaches.<br/>
</p>
<p>
A few months ago, Puro.earth, a carbon removal registry, certified a
small ethanol refinery in North Dakota to sell carbon removal credits —
the first ethanol plant to earn this privilege. Red Trail Energy, which
owns the facility, captures the CO2 released from the plant when corn is
fermented into ethanol, and injects it into a porous section of rock
more than 6,000 feet underground. Since Red Trail started doing this in
June of 2022, it’s prevented some 300,000 metric tons of CO2 from
entering the atmosphere, according to
<a href="https://www.dmr.nd.gov/dmr/oilgas/ClassVI" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>data</u></a>
published by the North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources.
</p>
<p>
There are two ways to look at what’s happening here.
</p>
<p>
If you just follow the carbon, it started in the atmosphere and ended up
underground. In between, the corn sucked up carbon through
photosynthesis; when it was processed into ethanol, about a third of
that carbon went into the fuel, a third was left behind as dried grain,
and the remainder was captured as it wafted out of the fermentation tank
and stashed underground. “That is, in a broad sense, how that looks like
carbon removal,” Daniel Sanchez, an assistant professor at the
University of California, Berkeley who studies biomass carbon removal,
told me.
</p>
<p>
But if you zoom out, the picture changes. For the carbon to get from the
atmosphere to the ground, a few other things had to happen. The corn had
to be grown, harvested, and transported in trucks to the plant. It had
to be put through a mill, cooked, and then liquified using heat from a
natural gas boiler. And this was all in service, first and foremost, of
producing ethanol to be burned, ultimately, in a car engine. If you
account for the CO2 emitted during these other steps, the process as a
whole is putting more into the atmosphere than it’s taking out.
</p>
<p>
So, is Red Trail Energy really doing carbon removal?
</p>
<p>
Puro.earth takes the first view — the registry’s rules essentially draw
a box around the carbon capture and storage, or CCS, part of the
process. Red Trail has to count the emissions from the energy it took to
capture and liquify and inject the carbon, but not from anything else
that happened before that. So far, Puro has issued just over 157,000
carbon removal credits for Red Trail to sell.
</p>
<p>
This is, essentially, industry consensus. Other carbon market registries
including Gold Standard, Verra, and Isometric more or less take the same
approach for any projects involving biomass, though they haven’t
certified any ethanol projects yet. (Isometric’s current rules
disqualify ethanol plants because they only allow projects that use
waste biomass.)
</p>
<p>
But the nonprofit CarbonPlan, a watchdog for the carbon removal
industry, argues that it’s a mistake to call this carbon removal. In a
<a href="https://carbonplan.org/research/ethanol-cdr-claims" target="_blank">blog
post</a> published in December, program lead Freya Chay wrote that
because the carbon storage is “contingent upon the continued production
of ethanol,” it’s wrong to separate the two processes. The project
<em><em>reduces</em></em> the facility’s overall emissions, Chay argued,
but it’s not “carbon removal.”
</p>
<p>
This debate may sound semantic, and to some extent, it is. As long as an
action results in less pollution warming the planet, does it matter
whether we label it “carbon removal” or “emission reduction”?
</p>
<p>
The point of carbon credits is that they are paying for an intervention
that wouldn’t have happened otherwise. “You have to look at, what part
of the project is being built because they receive carbon removal
credits?” Marianne Tikkanen, the co-founder and head of standard at Puro
told me. “In this case, it was the capture part.” Previously, the
emissions from the fermentation tank were considered to be zero, since
the carbon started in the atmosphere and ended up back in the
atmosphere. If you just look at the change that the sale of credits
supported, those emissions are now negative.
</p>
<p>
But the logic of carbon credits may not be totally aligned with the
point of carbon <em><em>removal.</em></em> Scientists generally see
three roles for technologies that remove carbon from the atmosphere. The
first is to reduce net emissions in the near term — Red Trail’s project
checks that box. In the medium term, carbon removal can counteract any
remaining emissions that we don’t know how to eliminate. That’s how
we’ll “achieve net-zero” and stop the planet from warming.
</p>
<p>
But those who say these labels really matter are thinking of the third
role. In the distant future, if we achieve net-zero emissions, but
global average temperatures have reached dangerous heights, doing
additional carbon removal — and lowering the total concentration of CO2
in the atmosphere — will be our only hope of cooling the planet. If this
is the long term goal, there is a “clear conceptual problem” with
calling a holistic process that emits more than it removes “carbon
removal,” Chay told me.
</p>
<p>
“I think the point of definitions is to help us navigate the world,” she
said. “It will be kind of a miracle if we get there, but that is the
lighthouse.”
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p class="drop-caps">
Red Trail may have been the first ethanol company to get certified to
sell carbon removal credits, but others are looking to follow in its
footsteps. Chay’s blog post, written in December, was responding to news
of another project: Summit Carbon Solutions, a company trying to build a
major pipeline through the midwest that will transport CO2 captured from
ethanol refineries and deliver it to an underground well in North
Dakota,
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-26/carbon-credit-deal-targets-us-pipeline-to-remove-corn-based-ethanol-emissions" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>announced
a deal</u></a> to pre-sell $30 million worth of carbon removal credits
from the project; it plans to
<a href="https://www.goldstandard.org/news/first-carbon-dioxide-removal-and-storage-methodolo" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>certify
the credits through Gold Standard</u></a>. In May, Summit
<a href="https://summitcarbonsolutions.com/anew-climate-summit-carbon-solutions-advance-megaton-co2-removal-project/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>announced</u></a>
it planned to sell more than 160 million tons of carbon removal credits
over the next decade.
</p>
<p>
Decarbonization experts often refer to the emissions from ethanol plants
as low-hanging fruit. Out of all the polluting industries that we could
be capturing carbon from, ethanol is one of the easiest. The CO2
released when corn sugar is fermented is nearly 100% pure, whereas the
CO2 that comes from fossil fuel combustion is filled with all kinds of
chemicals that need to be scrubbed out first.
</p>
<p>
Even if it’s relatively easy, though, it’s not free, and the ethanol
industry has historically ignored the opportunity. But in the past few
years, federal tax credits and carbon markets have made the idea more
attractive.
</p>
<p>
Red Trail’s CCS project has been a long time in the making. The company
began looking into CCS in 2016, partnering with the Energy and
Environmental Research Center, the North Dakota Industrial Commission
Renewable Energy Council, and the U.S. Department of Energy on a
five-year feasibility study. Jodi Johnson, Red Trail’s CEO, answered
questions about the project by email. “Building a first-of-its-kind CCS
project involved significant financial, technical, and regulatory
risks,” she told me. “The technology, while promising, required
substantial upfront investment and a commitment to navigating uncharted
regulatory frameworks.”
</p>
<p>
The primary motivation for the project was the company’s “commitment to
environmental stewardship and sustainability,” Johnson said, but
low-carbon fuel markets in California and Oregon were also a “strategic
incentive.” Ethanol companies that sell into those states earn carbon
credits based on how much cleaner their fuel is than gasoline. They can
sell those credits to dirtier-fuel makers who need to comply with state
laws. The carbon capture project would enable Red Trail to earn more
credits — a revenue stream that at first, looked good enough to justify
the cost. A
<a href="https://undeerc.org/research/projects/_files/docs/integrated-cc-storage-for-ethanol-production.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>2017
economic assessment</u></a> of the project found that it “may be
economically viable,” depending on the specific requirements in the two
states.
</p>
<p>
But today, two years after Red Trail began capturing carbon, the
company’s application to participate in California’s low-carbon fuel
market is still pending. Though the company does sell some ethanol into
the Oregon market, it decided to try and sell carbon removal credits
through Puro to support “broader decarbonization and sequestration
efforts while awaiting regulatory approvals,” Johnson said. Red Trail
had already built its carbon capture system prior to working with Puro,
but it may not have operated the equipment unless it had an incentive to
do so.
</p>
<p>
Puro didn’t just take Red Trail’s word for it. The project underwent a
“financial additionality test” including an evaluation of other
incentives for Red Trail to sequester carbon. For example, the company
can earn up to $50 in tax credits for each ton of CO2 it puts
underground. (The Inflation Reduction Act increased this subsidy to $85
per ton, but Red Trail is not eligible for the higher amount because it
started building the project before the law went into effect.) In
theory, this tax credit alone could be enough to finance the project. A
recent
<a href="https://efifoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/20230212-CCS-Final_Full-copy.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>report</u></a>
from the Energy Futures Initiative concluded that a first-of-a-kind CCS
project at an ethanol plant should cost between $36 and $41 per ton of
CO2 captured and stored.
</p>
<p>
Johnson told me Red Trail does not pay income tax at the corporate
level, however — it is taxed as a partnership. That means individual
investors can take advantage of the credit, but it’s not a big enough
benefit to secure project finance. The project “requires significant
capital expenditure, operating expense, regulatory, and long-term
monitoring for compliance,” she said. “Access to the carbon market was
the needed incentive to secure the investment and the continuous project
operation.”
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, after an independent audit of Red Trail’s claims, Puro
concluded that the company did, in fact, need to sell carbon removal
credits to justify operating the CCS project. (Red Trail is currently
also earning carbon credits for fuel sold in Oregon, but Puro is
accounting for these and deducting credits from its registry
accordingly.)
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p class="drop-caps">
All this helps make the case that it’s reasonable to support projects
like Red Trail’s through the sale of carbon credits. But it doesn’t
explain why we should call it carbon removal.
</p>
<p>
When I put the question to Tikkanen, she said that the project
interrupts the “short cycle” of carbon: The CO2 is captured during
photosynthesis, it’s transferred into food or fuel, and then it’s
released back into the air in a continuous loop — all in a matter of
months. Red Trail is turning that loop into a one-way street from the
atmosphere to the ground, taking more and more carbon out of the air
over time. That’s different from capturing carbon at a fossil fuel
plant, where the carbon in question had previously been trapped
underground for millennia.
</p>
<p>
Robert Hoglund, a carbon removal advisor who co-founded the database
CDR.fyi, had a similar explanation. He told me that it didn’t make sense
to categorize this project as “reducing emissions” from the plant
because the fossil fuel-burning trucks that deliver the corn and the
natural gas boilers cooking it are still releasing the same amount of
carbon into the atmosphere. “If we say only processes that, if they’re
scaled up, lead to lower emissions in the atmosphere are carbon removal,
that’s looking at it from a system perspective,” he said. “I can
understand where they come from, but I think it does add some
confusion.”
</p>
<p>
Red Trail Energy and Summit Carbon Solutions defended the label, noting
that this is the way carbon market registries have decided to treat
biomass-based carbon sequestration projects. “The fact that emissions
remain from the lifecycle of the corn itself is not the focus of the
removal activity,” Johnson told me. “The biogenic CO2 is clearly removed
from the atmosphere permanently.”
</p>
<p>
Sanchez, the Berkeley professor, argued that Puro’s rules are adequate
because there’s a path for ethanol plants to eventually achieve
net-negative emissions. They will have to capture emissions from the
boiler, in addition to the fermentation process, and make a few other
tweaks, like using renewable natural gas, according to
<a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.2c04784" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
recent peer-reviewed study</u></a> Sanchez authored. “That’s not what’s
happening here,” he told me, “but I view that as indicative that this is
part of the basket of technologies that we use to reach net-zero and to
suck CO2 out of the air.”
</p>
<p>
(Red Trail is working on reducing its emissions even more, Johnson told
me. The company is finishing engineering on a new combined heat and
power system that will improve efficiency at the plant.)
</p>
<p>
In addition to teaching at Berkeley, Sanchez is a principal scientist
for the firm
<a href="https://www.carbon-direct.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Carbon
Direct</u></a>, which helps corporate buyers find “high quality” carbon
removal credits. He added that he felt the project was “worthy” of the
dollars companies are designating for carbon removal because of the risk
it involved, and the fact that it would blaze a trail for others to
follow. Ethanol CCS projects will help build up carbon storage
infrastructure and expertise, enabling other carbon removal projects in
the future.
</p>
<p>
Though there is seeming consensus among carbon market participants that
this is carbon removal, scientists outside the industry are more
skeptical. Katherine Maher, an Earth systems scientist who studies the
carbon cycle at Stanford University, said she understood the argument
for calling ethanol with CCS carbon removal, but she also couldn’t
ignore the fact that capturing the carbon requires energy to grow the
corn, transport it, and so on. “You really need to be conscious about,
what are the other emissions in the project, and are those being
accounted for in the calculation of the CO2 removed?”
</p>
<p>
Carbon180, a nonprofit that advocates for carbon removal policy, shares
that perspective. “When it comes to ethanol with CCS, we want to see the
actual net negativity,” Sifang Chen, the group’s managing science and
innovation advisor, told me.
</p>
<p>
In the U.S. Department of Energy’s
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/fecm/articles/department-energy-roads-removal-report-maps-path-gigatonne-scale-co2-removal" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Road
to Removals report</u></a>, a 221-page document that highlights all of
the opportunities for carbon removal in the United States, the agency
specifically chose not to analyze ethanol with CCS “due largely to its
inability to achieve a negative [carbon intensity] without substantial
retrofitting of existing corn-ethanol facilities.”
</p>
<p>
It’s possible to say that both views are correct. Each follows a clear
logic — one more rooted in creating practical rules for a market in
order to drive innovation, the other in the uncompromising math of
atmospheric science.
</p>
<p>
At times throughout writing this, I wondered if I was making something
out of nothing. But the debate has significance beyond ethanol. Sanchez
pointed out to me that you could ask the same question about any
so-called carbon removal process that’s tied to an existing industry.
Take enhanced rock weathering, for example, which involves crushing up
special kinds of rocks that are especially good at absorbing carbon from
the air. A lot of the companies trying to do this get their rocks from
mining waste, but they don’t include all the emissions from mining in
their carbon removal calculation.
</p>
<p>
Similarly, Summit Carbon Solutions noted that CarbonPlan supports claims
of carbon removal by Charm Industrial, a company that takes the biomass
left behind in corn fields, turns it into oil, and sequesters the oil
underground. In that case, the company is not counting emissions from
corn production or the downstream uses of corn.
</p>
<p>
Chay admitted that she didn’t have a great answer for why she drew the
boundaries differently for one versus the other. “We don’t claim to have
all the answers, and this back-and-forth illustrates just how much
ambiguity there is and why it’s important to work through these issues,”
she told me in an email. But she suggested that one point of comparison
is to look at how dependent the carbon removal activity is on “the
ongoing operation of a net emitting industry, and how one thinks about
the role of that emitting industry in a net-zero world.” There is no
apparent version of the future where we no longer have mining as an
industry, or no longer grow corn for food. But there is a path to
eliminating the use of ethanol by electrifying transportation.
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p class="drop-caps">
It’s worth mentioning that this niche debate about carbon removal is
taking place within a much larger and longer controversy about whether
ethanol belongs in a low-carbon future at all.
</p>
<p>
Red Trail told me the company sees the adoption of electric vehicles as
an opportunity to diversify into making fuels for aviation and
heavy-duty transportation, which are more difficult to electrify. But
some environmental groups, like the World Resources Institute, argue
that
<a href="https://www.wri.org/insights/us-sustainable-aviation-fuel-emissions-impacts" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
more sustainable approach</u></a> would be to develop synthetic fuels
from captured carbon and hydrogen. I should note that experts from both
sides of this debate told me that carbon credit sales should not justify
keeping an ethanol plant open or building a new one if the economics of
the fuel don’t work on their own.
</p>
<p>
In Chay’s blog post, she presented real stakes for this rhetorical
debate. If we call net-emitting processes carbon removal, we could
develop an inflated sense of how much progress we’ve made toward our
overall capacity to remove carbon from the atmosphere, which in turn
could warp perceptions of how quickly we need to reduce emissions.
</p>
<p>
Peter Minor, the former director of science and innovation at Carbon180
who is starting a company focused on measurement and verification,
raised the same concern. “When the definition of what it means to remove
a ton of CO2 from the air is subjective, what happens is you get a bunch
of projects that might have quite different climate impacts,” he told
me. “And you may or may not realize it until after the fact.”
</p>
<p>
There’s also a risk of diverting funding that could go toward scaling up
more challenging, more expensive, but truly net-negative solutions such
as direct air capture. This risk is compounded by the growing pressure
on carbon market players like Puro and Carbon Direct to identify new,
more affordable carbon removal projects. Over the past several years,
influential groups like the Science Based Targets initiative and
corporate sustainability thought leaders like Stripe and Microsoft have
decided that old-school carbon credits — the cheaper so-called “offsets”
that represent emissions reductions — are not good enough. Now companies
are expected to buy carbon removal credits to fulfill their climate
promises to customers, lest they be accused of greenwashing.
</p>
<p>
As a result, the industry has backed itself into a corner, Minor told
me. “We have come out as a society and said, the only thing that is
worth it, the only thing that is allowed to be used is carbon removal,”
he said. “So if that’s the only thing with economics behind it, then
yeah, like, magic! Everything is now all of a sudden carbon removal! Who
would have predicted that this could have happened?”
</p>
<p>
The success of carbon removal depends, ultimately, on integrity — the
industry’s favorite word these days. From the companies trying to remove
carbon, to the carbon credit registries validating those efforts, to the
nonprofits, brokers, and buyers that want to see the market scale,
everyone is talking about developing transparent and trustworthy
processes for measuring how much carbon is removed from the atmosphere
by a given intervention. But how good is good measurement if experts
don’t agree on what should be measured?
</p>
<p>
“There hasn’t been a way to standardize the climate impacts that are
being promised,” said Minor. “And so I think unless we solve that
problem, I just don’t see how we’re going to build the trust we need, to
create the economics that we need and justify an industry that can’t
really exist outside of the millions or billions of tons scale.”

The report says the trend is driven in part by a rise in lawsuits
targeting the “professional and financial services that enable the work
of fossil fuel companies.” For example, marketing and advertising
companies that create positive campaigns for oil and gas firms. And
another factor here is sectors that rely heavily on fossil fuels
(airlines, for example) but may attempt to “climate wash” by overstating
their environmental initiatives. These kinds of corporate lawsuits are
becoming more and more common, and more than 70% have been successful.
The report concludes that “companies from many sectors are now at risk
of being taken to court over the climate.”

has gone from serving a single industry — ethanol — at its pilot plant
in California, to making deals around the globe that demonstrate the
technology’s potential versatility. With grant funding from Breakthrough
Energy Catalyst, as well as the European Investment Bank, the company
will install three commercial-scale batteries at factories in Denmark,
Germany, and Portugal. Each one will prove Rondo’s compatibility with a
different industry: In Denmark, the battery will be used to produce
low-carbon biogas. In Germany, it will power a Covestro chemical plant
that produces polymers. In Portugal, it will power a to-be-announced
food and beverage factory.

I don't see the problem. The assignment operator

<h2 id="ads-hypocrisy">Ads hypocrisy</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-27, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;I was browsing the web—like I often do—and I stumbled on a message on a website that read:&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>
If you’re reading this, you blocked our ad. That’s cool, we block ads
too. This site is free though, so maybe unblock the ad so we can keep
paying for this website that you’re on, thanks.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This message rubbed me in the wrong way for a variety of reasons. First,
the hypocrisy of its content is annoying: we do something to others but
you should not do the same to us. Isn’t the whole <em>“Don’t do unto
others what you don’t want done unto you.”</em> common wisdom at this
point? Second, the <em>“This site is free though”</em> is a shitty
attempt to justify having ads served by an AD network because that’s
literally what every goddamn site out there does. Facebook is free.
Should I allow the tracking because of it? And lastly, the <em>“so we
can keep paying for this website”</em> is a desperate attempt to guilt
trip me into disabling my adblocker. I know very well how much running a
site like that costs. And I know for a fact the people behind that site
all have daily jobs. And so they can easily afford to pay for this site
exactly like countless others are paying for theirs.
</p>
<p>
The discourse around advertising on the web is messy. And the
pervasiveness of ads doesn’t help. You can just see how advertising
manages to find its way into almost everything. But if you’re a creator
of any kind it’s important to recognise the hypocrisy in some of the
arguments that are floating out there. The most glaring example is
YouTube. People often argue that by watching YouTube with adblockers I’m
stealing revenues from creators. Fair. The proposed solution is to pay
for YouTube Premium. Again, fair. My question is: are creators going to
upload YT Premium exclusive versions of the videos without their
sponsors’ ad reads baked in? The answer is no because that’s where the
vast majority of the revenues come from for them. And that’s another
example of the hypocrisy that’s powering this entire business model.
</p>
<p>
I don’t hate the general concept of an AD. I think sponsorships and
partnerships can be a net benefit if done correctly, especially when
done without tracking and profiling. If you run a site that’s focused on
a niche, the profiling is implicit. For example, the people who visit
minimalissimo.com probably have an interest in design and architecture
otherwise they wouldn’t waste their time on that site. And so if I were
to do some sort of partnership it would make sense to work with
companies that make products within those niches. That’s how “good”
advertising should work on the web. And that’s how it used to be before
hyper-targeting was a thing. Mind you, it’s still an option and plenty
of people do do it. It pays less than targeting advertising, for obvious
reasons. But creators need to do their part if we hope to make progress
on this front. Because the future can’t be targeted advertising
everywhere at anytime.
</p>
<p>
I’m not going to disable my adblocker for you. I’m running two at the
same time precisely because I don’t give a fuck about your stupid
targeted ad. But if you give me an option to donate something to you
directly I’m gonna do it. Because I believe contributing directly is the
most sane way to keep this whole boat afloat.

pandas en route from China to US under conservation partnership</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SAN DIEGO — A pair of giant pandas are on their way from China to the
U.S., where they will be cared for at the San Diego Zoo as part of an
ongoing conservation partnership between the two nations, officials said
Wednesday.</p>
<p>Officials with the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance were on hand in
China for a farewell ceremony commemorating the departure of the giant
pandas, Yun Chuan and Xin Bao.</p>
<p>The celebration included cultural performances, video salutations
from Chinese and American students and a gift exchange among
conservation partners, the zoo said in a statement. After the ceremony,
the giant pandas began their trip to Southern California.</p>
<p>“This farewell celebrates their journey and underscores a
collaboration between the United States and China on vital conservation
efforts,” Paul Baribault, the wildlife alliance president, said in a
statement. “Our long-standing partnership with China Wildlife
Conservation Association has been instrumental in advancing giant panda
conservation, and we look forward to continuing our work together to
ensure the survival and thriving of this iconic species.”</p>
<p>It could be several weeks before the giant pandas will be viewable to
the public in San Diego, officials said.</p>
<p>Yun Chuan, a mild-mannered male who’s nearly 5 years old, has
connections to California, the wildlife alliance said previously. His
mother, Zhen Zhen, was born at the San Diego Zoo in 2007 to parents Bai
Yun and Gao Gao.</p>
<p>Xin Bao is a nearly 4-year-old female described as “a gentle and
witty introvert with a sweet round face and big ears.”</p>
<p>The San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance has a nearly 30-year partnership
with leading conservation institutions in China focused on protecting
and recovering giant pandas and the bamboo forests they depend on.</p>

id="evidence-mounts-islamic-state-is-looking-to-the-us-southern-border">Evidence
mounts Islamic State is looking to the US southern border</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. intelligence and security officials are increasing
their focus on the country’s southern border, worried the constant flow
of migrants has attracted the attention of the Islamic State terror
group.</p>
<p>The heightened concern follows the arrests earlier this month of
eight men from Tajikistan, all of whom entered the United States via its
southern border with Mexico, some making the trip over a year ago.</p>
<p>While the initial background checks came up clean, U.S. law
enforcement subsequently turned up information indicating potential ties
to the Islamic State group, also known as IS or ISIS.</p>
<p>“It’s not lost on us that the people who killed over 150 Russians in
that theater were from the same part of the world,” said Ken Wainstein,
the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s undersecretary for
intelligence and analysis, referring to the March attack on a Moscow
concert hall, claimed by the terror group’s Afghan affiliate. </p>
<p>Wainstein, testifying Wednesday before the House Homeland Security
Subcommittee on Counterterrorism, said concern about the potential for
IS to exploit the border has led to daily meetings with the director of
the U.S. National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC), as well as
unprecedented cooperation with the FBI.</p>
<p>But he sought to downplay concerns stemming from intelligence
suggesting that the IS-linked human smuggling network may have brought
more than 400 migrants from Central Asia into the U.S., across the
southern border.</p>
<p>“There is not information which suggests those particular individuals
are terrorist operatives,” Wainstein told lawmakers.</p>
<p>Information on the 400 migrants, first reported by NBC News,
indicates more than 150 of the migrants have been arrested. But
officials told NBC that the whereabouts of more than 50 others are
unknown.</p>
<p>The newfound concerns about terror groups like IS actively trying to
exploit the southern border seems to indicate a significant shift in the
threat landscape.</p>
<p>For years, U.S. counterterrorism officials have maintained there was
no evidence that IS or other Sunni terror groups were trying to
infiltrate the U.S. along its border with Mexico. </p>
<p>And this past November, NCTC Director Christine Abizaid told
lawmakers that while counterterrorism officials “absolutely recognize
the risk,” evidence for such plots was lacking.</p>
<p>“We don’t have indications that are credible or corroborated,” she
told members of the House of Representatives at the time.</p>
<p>But U.S. and Turkish sanctions unveiled earlier this month may point
to the Islamic State terror group’s growing interest in human
smuggling.</p>
<p>The sanctions focus on what the U.S. Treasury Department described as
a Eurasian human smuggling network that was providing support for IS
members in Turkey. </p>
<p>One of the key operatives, Olimkhon Ismailov, is based in Uzbekistan.
And Ismailov had high-level help, with Treasury alleging he was given
guidance by the leader of IS in the Republic of Georgia, Adam
Khamirzaev.</p>
<p>According to the U.S. State Department, Khamirzaev apparently had his
sights set on the U.S. </p>
<p>The IS-Georgia emir “provided guidance to this network on a range of
activities supporting ISIS and was aware of its efforts to facilitate
travelers to the United States,” the State Department said in a
statement.</p>
<p>Multiple U.S. agencies, including DHS, the FBI and the State
Department declined to respond to questions about the reach of the
Eurasian human smuggling network involved with IS operatives in Turkey
and Uzbekistan.</p>
<p>There are also no indications that the sanctioned network is
connected to the same IS-linked network that brought the eight men from
Tajikistan, or the hundreds of other Central Asian migrants, into the
U.S. through the southern border.</p>
<p>As for the eight men from Tajikistan, Homeland Security Secretary
Alejandro Mayorkas told reporters in Tucson, Arizona, Wednesday that,
“They are in removal proceedings as we speak.”</p>
<p>And other U.S. officials say they have stepped up security
measures.</p>
<p>“We have increased our vigilance at our border,” said Jen Daskal, the
White House deputy Homeland Security adviser, virtually addressing a
counterterrorism conference Wednesday in Omaha, Nebraska.</p>
<p>“We have enhanced our screening and vetting, instituted recurrent
vetting of migrants to identify newly uncovered threats and detain those
who pose a public safety threat,” she said.</p>
<p>But Daskal admitted the threat from IS, and especially its Afghan
affiliate, persists.</p>
<p>“Both ISIS and ISIS-Khorasan, or what we call ISIS-K, have
demonstrated a capability and intent to conduct external operations,”
she said.</p>

<h2>
Upgrading to PostgreSQL 17 Beta 2
</h2>
<p>
To upgrade to PostgreSQL 17 Beta 2 from an earlier version of
PostgreSQL, you will need to use a strategy similar to upgrading between
major versions of PostgreSQL (e.g. <code>pg_upgrade</code> or
<code>pg_dump</code> / <code>pg_restore</code>). For more information,
please visit the documentation section on
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/static/upgrading.html">upgrading</a>.
</p>

<p>
Fixes and changes in PostgreSQL 17 Beta 2 include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Correctly enforce the default behavior of the <code>ON EMPTY</code>
clause when it’s not present in a SQL/JSON query.
</li>
<li>
Fixed issue with <code>pg_logical_slot_get_changes</code> related to
resource ownership.
</li>
<li>
Several fixes around the new data structure for vacuum-related data.

Testing for Bugs &amp; Compatibility
</h2>
<p>
The stability of each PostgreSQL release greatly depends on you, the
community, to test the upcoming version with your workloads and testing
tools in order to find bugs and regressions before the general
availability of PostgreSQL 17. As this is a Beta, minor changes to
database behaviors, feature details, and APIs are still possible. Your
feedback and testing will help determine the final tweaks on the new
features, so please test in the near future. The quality of user testing
helps determine when we can make a final release.

<h2 id="the-anatomy-of-metadata-matching">The anatomy of metadata
matching</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-27, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<p>
In our
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/metadata-matching-101-what-is-it-and-why-do-we-need-it/">previous
blog post</a> about metadata matching, we discussed what it is and why
we need it (tl;dr: to discover more relationships within the scholarly
record). Here, we will describe some basic matching-related terminology
and the components of a matching process. We will also pose some typical
product questions to consider when developing or integrating matching
solutions.
</p>
<h2 id="basic-terminology">
Basic terminology
</h2>
<p>
Metadata matching is a high-level concept, with many different problems
falling into this category. Indeed, no matter how much we like to focus
on the similarities between different forms of matching, matching
affiliation strings to ROR IDs or matching preprints to journal papers
are still different in several important ways. At Crossref and ROR, we
call these problems matching tasks.
</p>
<p>
Simply put, a <strong>matching task</strong> defines the kind or nature
of the matching. Examples of matching tasks are bibliographic reference
matching, affiliation matching, grant matching, or preprint matching.
</p>
<p>
Every matching task has an input, which is all the data that is needed
to perform the matching. Input data can come in many shapes and forms,
depending on the matching task. For example, all of the following could
be inputs to a matching task:
</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapporo Medical University, Sapporo 060-8556, Japan
</code></pre>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&lt;fr:program xmlns:fr=&#34;http://www.crossref.org/fundref.xsd&#34; name=&#34;fundref&#34;&gt;
&lt;fr:assertion name=&#34;fundgroup&#34;&gt;
&lt;fr:assertion name=&#34;funder_name&#34;&gt;
European Union&#39;s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program through Marie Sklodowska Curie
&lt;fr:assertion name=&#34;funder_identifier&#34;&gt;http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780&lt;/fr:assertion&gt;
&lt;/fr:assertion&gt;
&lt;fr:assertion name=&#34;award_number&#34;&gt;721624&lt;/fr:assertion&gt;
&lt;/fr:assertion&gt;
&lt;/fr:program&gt;
</code></pre>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Everitt, W. N., &amp; Kalf, H. (2007). The Bessel differential equation and the Hankel transform. Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics, 208(1), 3–19.
</code></pre>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>{
&#34;title&#34;: &#34;Functional single-cell genomics of human cytomegalovirus infection&#34;,
&#34;issued&#34;: &#34;2021-10-25&#34;,
&#34;author&#34;: [
{&#34;given&#34;: &#34;Marco Y.&#34;, &#34;family&#34;: &#34;Hein&#34;},

]
}
</code></pre>
<p>
Every matching task also has an <strong>output</strong>. For our
purposes, this is almost exclusively zero or more matched identifiers.
In the context of a specific matching task, output identifiers may be of
a specific type (e.g. we might match to a ROR ID, and never to an ORCID
ID). In some cases, there can be a certain target set as well
(i.e. matching only to DataCite DOIs). The output identifiers can have
different
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality" target="_blank">cardinality</a>
depending on the task, meaning that the matching task might allow for
zero, one, or more identifiers as a result of matching to a single
input.
</p>
<p>
A <strong>matching strategy</strong> defines how the matching is done.
Multiple strategies can exist for a specific matching task. Compound
strategies can run other strategies and combine their outcomes into a
single result.
</p>
<p>
In some cases, we may also want the matching strategy to output a
confidence score for each matched identifier. A confidence score
represents the degree of certainty or likelihood that the matched
identifier is correct, typically expressed as a value between 0 and 1.
This score may help with post-processing or further interpretation of
the results.
</p>
<p>
To summarise, the anatomy of the matching task can be diagrammed as
follows:

<br />
<h2 id="how-to-specify-a-matching-task">
How to specify a matching task
</h2>
<p>
Whenever we plan the development or integration of a matching solution,
it is good to begin by answering a few basic questions:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
What problem do we plan to solve with our matching task? What would we
call our matching task and how would we describe it?
</li>
<li>
What do we expect as the input for this matching task? Which input
formats do we need to be able to accept? What information do we expect
to find in this input?
</li>
<li>
What kind of identifiers should be output? Is there a target set of
identifiers? Can our matching output zero/one/or multiple identifiers,
and under what conditions might that occur?
</li>
</ol>
<p>
These sound fairly simple, but the answers to these questions can be
remarkably complex. Once one tries to apply these concepts to real-world
problems, they might encounter several non-obvious challenges.
</p>
<p>
For example, one common concern is at what level we should define each
matching task. Consider the following problems:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Matching bibliographic reference strings to DOIs. Example input:
</li>
</ol>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Everitt, W. N., &amp; Kalf, H. (2007). The Bessel differential equation and the Hankel transform. Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics, 208(1), 3–19.
</code></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>
Matching structured bibliographic reference to DOIs. Example input:
</li>
</ol>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>{
volume: &#34;208&#34;,
author: &#34;Everitt&#34;,
journal-title: &#34;J. Comput. Appl. Math.&#34;,
article-title: &#34;The Bessel differential equation and the Hankel transform&#34;,
first-page: &#34;3&#34;,
year: &#34;2007&#34;,
issue: &#34;1&#34;
}
</code></pre>
<p>
Are those discrete matching tasks (<em>unstructured reference
matching</em> vs. <em>structured reference matching</em>), or are they
the same task (<em>reference matching</em>) that can accept different
types of inputs (unstructured or structured)?
</p>
<p>
Similarly, let’s compare the following tasks:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Matching affiliation strings to ROR IDs. Example input:
</li>
</ol>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapporo Medical University, Sapporo 060-8556, Japan
</code></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>
Matching funder names to ROR IDs. Example input:
</li>
</ol>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Alexander von Humboldt Foundation
</code></pre>
<p>
Are these different matching tasks (<em>affiliation matching</em>
vs. <em>funder matching</em>), or the same task with different inputs
(<em>organisation matching</em>)?
</p>
<p>
Defining the boundaries of a matching task can also be difficult.
Consider, for example, the need to obtain ROR IDs for organisations
mentioned in the acknowledgements section of a full-text academic paper.
To begin, one may first extract the acknowledgement section from the
full text, then run something like a named entity recognition (NER) tool
to isolate the organisation names from the extracted text, and finally
match these names to ROR IDs. Is this entire process matching, with the
input being the full text of a paper? Or perhaps matching starts with
the acknowledgement section as the input? Instead, is it only the last
phase, where we try to match the extracted name to the ROR ID, that
constitutes the matching task, with the extraction phases being
completely separate processes?
</p>
<p>
There are also important questions related to the expected behaviour of
a matching strategy. Consider, for example, developing an affiliation
matching strategy where we define our input as “an affiliation string”.
What should happen when the strategy gets something else on the input,
for example, song lyrics? Perhaps the strategy should simply return no
matches, or an error, or we could say that in such a situation the
behaviour is undefined and it simply doesn’t matter what is returned.
But what should happen if in this input we have the lyrics of
<a href="https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/roxymusic/streetlife.html" target="_blank">Street
Life by Roxy Music</a>, a song that mentions the names of a few
universities that happen to have ROR IDs?
</p>
<p>
It is likewise important to consider what should happen if different
parts of the input match to different identifiers, like in the following
example:
</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Department of Haematology, Eastern Health and Monash University, Box Hill, Australia
</code></pre>
<p>
Here, “Eastern Health” matches to
<a href="https://ror.org/00vyyx863" target="_blank">https://ror.org/00vyyx863</a>
and “Monash University” to
<a href="https://ror.org/02bfwt286" target="_blank">https://ror.org/02bfwt286</a>.
Should the matching strategy return all the identifiers, one of them (if
so, which one?), or nothing at all?
</p>
<p>
Similar questions arise when it is possible to match to multiple
versions (or duplicates) in the target identifier set. This can happen,
for example, in the context of bibliographic reference matching or
preprint matching. Multiple matches may occur when there are different
editions, reprints, or variations of the same publication in the target
dataset, each with its own unique identifier.
</p>
<p>
If you are waiting for an answer to these questions, we unfortunately
must disappoint you here. These can only be answered in the context of a
specific problem, considering who the users are and what it is they need
and expect.
</p>
<p>
Did you notice any other subtleties related to metadata matching and its
concerns? Are there other non-obvious questions that should be
considered when planning to develop or integrate metadata matching
strategies? Let us know—we’d love to hear from you!

<h2 id="emotional-homecoming-for-wikileaks-assange">Emotional homecoming
for WikiLeaks’ Assange</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>London — WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange arrived in his home country
of Australia a free man Wednesday after agreeing to a plea deal with
U.S. prosecutors over espionage charges, ending a 14-year legal
odyssey.</p>
<p>Supporters of the 52-year-old journalist and political activist
welcomed his release, but said the prosecution sets a dangerous
precedent for press freedom.</p>
<p>Assange received an emotional welcome as he arrived at Canberra
Airport by private jet Wednesday morning. He was embraced by his wife
Stella, and his father, John Shipton, before punching the air as he was
cheered by a group of supporters gathered nearby.</p>
<p>“Julian wanted me to sincerely thank everyone. He wanted to be here,
but you have to understand what he’s been through. He needs time. He
needs to recuperate,” Stella Assange told reporters at a press
conference in Australia’s capital.</p>
<p>She thanked his supporters around the world.</p>
<p>“It took millions of people. It took people working behind the
scenes. People protesting on the streets for days and weeks and months
and years. And we achieved it,” she said.</p>
<p>Assange spends years in prison</p>
<p>Assange spent more than five years in London’s high-security Belmarsh
Prison as he fought a legal battle over extradition to the United
States.</p>
<p>Britain’s High Court finally ruled in May that he could appeal the
extradition order. That decision prompted the U.S. Department of
Justice, British and Australian authorities, and Assange’s legal team to
expedite negotiations on a deal in which Assange pleaded guilty to one
charge of espionage.</p>
<p>He was flown Monday evening from London to the U.S. Pacific territory
of Saipan, where a brief hearing at a U.S. District Court on Tuesday
concluded the prosecution.</p>
<p>Assange was sentenced to the equivalent of the time he had already
spent in prison and was free Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>Defense criticizes US prosecutors</p>
<p>Assange’s lawyer, Jennifer Robinson, criticized U.S. prosecutors’
pursuit of a conviction.</p>
<p>“In order to win his freedom, Julian pleaded guilty to conspiracy to
commit espionage for publishing evidence of U.S. war crimes, human
rights abuse and U.S. wrongdoing around the world. This is journalism.
This is the criminalization of journalism,” said Robinson.</p>
<p>“And while the plea deal does not set a judicial precedent — it’s not
a court decision — the prosecution itself sets a precedent that can be
used against the rest of the media,” Robinson said at the press
conference in Canberra on Wednesday.</p>
<p>‘Democracy demands this’</p>
<p>U.S. prosecutors charged Assange in 2019 with 17 counts of espionage
and one count of hacking, relating to the publication of stolen
diplomatic cables covering the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.</p>
<p>Wikileaks said the material revealed abuses by the U.S. military.
Campaigners for press freedom say Assange was simply doing his job.</p>
<p>“Essentially what he does is what all journalists want to do: expose
incompetence, expose wrongdoing and hold the power to account. Because
essentially, democracy demands this. I mean, without this, we wouldn’t
have democracy,” said Abdullahi Tasiu Abubakar, a senior lecturer in
journalism at City, University of London.</p>
<p>US State Department defends US’ action</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Justice has not yet commented on the plea
deal. The State Department defended the United States’ actions.</p>
<p>“I do think it is important when we talk about Julian Assange to
remind the world that the actions for which he was indicted and for
which he has now pled guilty are actions that put the lives of our
partners, our allies and our diplomats at risk, especially those who
work in dangerous places like Afghanistan and Iraq,” State Department
spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters on Wednesday.</p>
<p>“The documents they published gave identifying information of
individuals who were in contact with the State Department that included
opposition leaders, human rights activists around the world, whose
positions were put in some danger because of their public disclosure,”
Miller added. “It also chilled the ability of American personnel to
build relationships and have frank conversations with them.”</p>
<p>Australian PM lobbies for release</p>
<p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who personally lobbied
U.S. President Joe Biden to allow Assange’s release, welcomed the plea
deal.</p>
<p>“Regardless of your views about his activities — and they will be
varied — Mr. Assange’s case has dragged on for too long. I have said
repeatedly that there was nothing to be gained by his continued
incarceration.</p>
<p>“We have used all appropriate channels. This outcome has been the
product of careful, patient and determined work, work I am very proud
of,” Albanese told lawmakers on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Supporters say they’ll seek pardon</p>
<p>Assange spent seven years in self-imposed confinement in Ecuador’s
embassy in London from 2012, as he evaded unrelated rape charges filed
by Swedish prosecutors, which were later dropped. Assange said he always
believed the U.S. was seeking his extradition.</p>
<p>He was arrested by British authorities for breach of bail after the
Ecuadorian Embassy ejected him in 2019. Assange was held in Belmarsh
Prison as he fought U.S. attempts to secure his extradition.</p>
<p>Assange’s supporters say they will seek a full pardon of his
espionage conviction and have vowed to fight for the principle of press
freedom.</p>

<h2 id="extreme-weather-flooding-grip-us-midwest">Extreme weather,
flooding grip US Midwest</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>DES MOINES, Iowa — A house that was teetering on the edge of an
eroding riverbank near a Minnesota dam collapsed into the river in the
latest jarring example of extreme weather gripping the upper
Midwest. </p>
<p>Video shows the house owned by the Barnes family falling into the
flood-swollen Blue Earth River near Mankato on Tuesday night. The dam’s
west abutment failed Monday, sending the river around the dam and
eroding the bank where the home sat. The family had evacuated the house
before the collapse. </p>
<p>“It’s been a very scary and hard situation,” Jenny Barnes, whose
family has run the nearby Dam Store for decades, told KARE-TV on Tuesday
before the house fell into the river. She also was worried about the
store. </p>
<p>“That’s our life, as well. That’s our business; that’s our
livelihood. It’s everything to us,” Barnes said.  </p>
<p>A swath through Nebraska, Iowa, South Dakota and Minnesota has been
under siege from flooding because of torrential rains since last week,
while also suffering through a scorching heat wave. Up to 46 centimeters
of rain have fallen in some areas, pushing some rivers to record levels.
Hundreds of people were rescued, homes were damaged and at least two
people died after driving in flooded areas. </p>
<p>Tornado warnings, flash flooding and large hail Tuesday night added
insult to injury for some Midwesterners. The National Weather Service
said several tornadoes were reported in Iowa and Nebraska. The service
was assessing damage to some buildings, crops and trees to confirm
whether tornadoes touched down. No major injuries were reported. </p>
<p>The weather service also extended flood warnings for multiple rivers
in the region. On Tuesday, floodwaters breached levees in Iowa, creating
dangerous conditions that prompted evacuations. </p>
<p>Preliminary information from the weather service shows the recent
flooding brought record-high river levels at more than a dozen locations
in South Dakota and Iowa, surpassing previous crests by an average of
about (1 meter). The Big Sioux River reached nearly 12 meters in
Hawarden, Iowa, on Saturday and nearly 14 meters in Sioux City, Iowa, on
Monday, exceeding previous highs by 1.5 to 2.1 meters,
respectively. </p>
<p>Missouri Gov. Mike Parson on Wednesday declared a state of emergency
in anticipation of Missouri River flooding. </p>
<p>In South Dakota, Kathy Roberts lost nearly everything she had when
she escaped flooding Sunday night with her cat and the clothes on her
back, KTIV-TV reported. </p>
<p>“I heard screaming outside and looked outside and I had neighbors
that had water rushing into their place and water was slowly rising in
my driveway,” Roberts said.  </p>
<p>In the residential development where Roberts lived in North Sioux
City, streets, utility poles and trees collapsed, and some homes were
washed off their foundations. There was no water, sewer, gas or

Tuesday in a Facebook post. </p>
<p>South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem said in a post on the social platform X
Tuesday night that people needed to stay out of the area unless escorted

<p>The sheriff’s office in Monona County, near the Nebraska border, said
the Little Sioux River breached levees in several areas. In neighboring
Woodbury County, the sheriff’s office posted drone video on Facebook
showing the river overflowing the levee and flooding land in rural
Smithland. No injuries were immediately reported. </p>
<p>In the Sioux City, Iowa, area, water spilled over the Big Sioux River
levee, damaging hundreds of homes, officials estimated. And the local
wastewater treatment plant has been so overwhelmed by the floodwaters
that officials say they’re having to dump about 3.8 million liters of
untreated sewage per day into the Missouri River. </p>
<p>As new areas were flooding this week, some cities and towns were
cleaning up after the waters receded while others downstream were piling
sandbags and taking other measures to protect against the oncoming

<p>Many streams, especially with additional rainfall, may not crest
until later this week as the floodwaters slowly drain down a web of
rivers to the Missouri and Mississippi. The Missouri will crest at Omaha

Backed by a whopping $1.69 billion endowment, Stanford’s Doerr School of
Sustainability — its first new school in more than 70 years — opened its
doors two years ago, and what else came along with it but a new
sustainability-focused accelerator specifically for the Stanford
community. Seeking to move research out of the lab and into the real
world, the Sustainability Accelerator provides early stage funding and a
deep network of university-affiliated support to its grantees.
</p>
<p>
Now that the accelerator has
<a href="https://sustainability.stanford.edu/news/sustainability-accelerator-announces-first-executive-director?utm_source=feedotter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=int-05-06-2024&utm_content=httpssustainabilitystanfordedunewssustainabilityacceleratorannouncesfirstexecutivedirector&mkt_tok=NjYwLVRKQy05ODQAAAGS8h-KZSPjBfGozsgKcvqyzIdh0A2iGGiP6KmEgvPSZTNwM9eyUiNDMN2HoV-cQP8w6SHKHfns6mUb4hb9ZUl1j7ow2JciTunsZyVa1K4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>staffed
up</u></a>, gathered insights from its first funding cohort, and
<a href="https://sustainability.stanford.edu/news/stanford-doerr-school-sustainability-announces-its-first-focus-area" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>given
more structure</u></a> to what is still a very flexibly organized
program, I wanted to know more.
</p>
<p>
The basic concept sounded very Stanford-y indeed — gobs of money, a
hugely valuable network, entrepreneurial vibes out the wazoo. But that’s
nothing new. When I was at Stanford as an undergrad over a decade ago,
<em><em>The New Yorker</em></em>’s Nicholas Thompson, now the CEO of the
Atlantic (and a fellow Stanford alumnus), quipped that the school had
come to resemble
“<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/the-end-of-stanford" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
giant tech incubator with a football team</u></a>.” This was in the
early days of Snapchat and around the time when
<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324020504578396912443242512" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>over
a dozen computer science students</u></a> dropped out to work on the
Venmo-wannabe Clinkle, which
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/15/clunk/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>went
up in smoke soon after</u></a>. Concerns about the
<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/04/30/get-rich-u" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>university’s
deep ties to Silicon Valley</u></a> and the preponderance of potentially
pointless startups coming out of it coexisted with plaudits poured on
alumni founders with started-in-a-garage-now-we’re-here type stories.
</p>
<p>
I thought it was all a bit much. But now there’s a
<em><em>sustainability </em></em>accelerator, and man, does that sound
like something we could all get behind. So I talked with the
accelerator’s faculty director, Yi Cui, and managing director, Jeff
Brown, about the accelerator’s goals, what sets it apart from the
infinite other funding avenues in Silicon Valley, and how they go about
deciding what concepts have the potential for widespread adoption,
either in the commercial or the policy space.
</p>
<p>
Brown himself is a Stanford alum with a deep background as a Silicon
Valley engineer and founder — in other words, he can talk the talk as
well as he walks the walk. Prior to his current role at the
sustainability accelerator, he was founder and CEO of Novvi, which makes
plant-based oils for use in the lubricants industry. He told me that one
of the primary elements that sets Stanford’s accelerator apart from
other incubators or venture capital funds is that it’s not just focused
on technical solutions to climate and sustainability problems.
</p>
<p>
“There’s a lot of challenges beyond technology,” Brown told me. “This is
market development, this is frameworks that need to be globally aligned,
this is policy that leads to new legislation in a global scenario. And
so at the accelerator, we’re thinking about these things at that scale,
and working in a very interdisciplinary manner across all those spaces.”
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://sustainability-accelerator.stanford.edu/how-we-work/selected-projects" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Thirty-one
projects</u></a> were selected to join the accelerator’s initial cohort
in the summer of 2022, their teams generally comprised of researchers
with deep subject area expertise — mostly professors partnering with
other professors, faculty members or postdocs. Topics spanned the gamut
from highly technical ideas like
<a href="https://sustainability-accelerator.stanford.edu/news/electrified-reactors-could-decarbonize-industrial-chemical-production" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>electrifying
steam cracking reactors</u></a> for industrial chemical production to
policy projects such as
<a href="https://sustainability-accelerator.stanford.edu/western-wildfire-policy-prescribed-fire-public-health" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reforming
California’s approach</u></a> to wildfire management or partnering with
stakeholders to
<a href="https://sustainability-accelerator.stanford.edu/partnering-domestic-and-international-players-more-effective-energy-transition-policies-and" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>support
the energy transition in Southeast Asia</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
“We are interested in water, food. We are interested in climate
adaptation,” Cui, a Stanford professor in both the Materials Science
&amp; Engineering department as well as the Energy Science &amp;
Engineering Department, told me. “We are also interested in new
approaches that could be highly scalable for sustainability — for
example, synthetic biology.” He also cited grid decarbonization and
industrial decarbonization as focus areas.
</p>
<p>
And yet Brown also told me it’s vital that all teams, even
policy-focused ones, demonstrate that they have potential backers
outside the Stanford bubble. For legislative solutions, “you have to go
out into the community and find that people agree and are willing to
adopt that and move forward with you.” And for technical solutions,
Brown said, “you’ve got to show that customers are willing to receive
it, and there are other funding sources that buy into that, as you’re
going to need increasing capital to scale.”
</p>
<p>
For the accelerator’s first cohort, projects were organized into one of
three categories based on their level of maturity — planning, mid-range,
and large-scale, which dictated the amount of funding they were eligible
to receive. Brown didn’t want to disclose how much money Stanford is
pouring into these projects (although he did say they have a “large
budget” to work with) but a 2022
<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/184Cq-T-uoDT3E3iHO6y4vbYUKKYxuuLV/view" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>request
for proposals</u></a> indicates that Level 1 projects could secure up to
$100,000, Level 2 up to $400,000, and Level 3 up to $1,000,000. It also
noted that project teams can specify their own timelines, ranging from
three months up to a year, with the option for follow-on funding based
on a project’s progress.
</p>
<p>
Going forward, cohorts will be organized around particular climate
themes, a.k.a. “flagship destinations,” which will include key metrics
for scalability and speed. The first focus area for the 2024 group is
greenhouse gas removal,
<a href="https://sustainability-accelerator.stanford.edu/focus-areas/greenhouse-gas-removal" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>for
which 16 projects were chosen</u></a> based on their potential to remove
a gigaton (that’s a billion tons, folks) of greenhouse gas from the
atmosphere by 2050, either by technical or policy means. Examples
include
<a href="https://sustainability-accelerator.stanford.edu/carbon-dioxide-removal-materials-integrated-capture-and-permanent-sequestration" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>transforming
rocks and mining waste</u></a> into efficient CO2 sponges, and
<a href="https://sustainability-accelerator.stanford.edu/developing-robust-frameworks-and-methods-monitoring-reporting-and-verification-mcdr" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>developing
a monitoring, reporting, and verification framework</u></a> for
ocean-based carbon removal.
</p>
<p>
Brown emphasized the importance of MRV particularly, the Achilles’ heel
of many well-intentioned carbon removal efforts.
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/reforestation-gap-offsets" target="_self"><u>Reforestation</u></a>,
for example, “is not a technology problem,” he told me. “It’s a
framework problem around the MRV challenge, and getting the legislation
in place, and getting community alignment around the world on how to
execute this properly.”
</p>
<p>
Some in the Stanford community worry, however, that the choice of
greenhouse gas removal as a focus area was influenced by the
university’s fossil fuel connections, as big oil and gas companies often
tout carbon capture as a solution that would allow them to continue
producing fossil fuels. The Doerr School
<a href="https://stanforddaily.com/2024/01/29/doerr-funding/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>does
accept research funding from fossil fuel companies</u></a>, and three
years ago, Stanford’s Precourt Institute for Energy collaborated with
Shell, ExxonMobil, and TotalEnergies to host a
<a href="https://carbon-removal.stanford.edu/news-events/workshops/stanford-global-carbon-management-workshop-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>workshop</u></a>
on carbon management. The Doerr School itself
<a href="https://sustainability.stanford.edu/news/stanford-doerr-school-sustainability-announces-its-first-focus-area#:~:text=The%20Precourt%20Institute%20for%20Energy%20held%20a%20workshop%20on%20engineered%20and%20hybrid%20solutions%2C%20including%20carbon%20sequestration%20underground%2C%20bioenergy%2C%20and%20carbon%20mineralization.%C2%A0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>cited</u></a>
the meeting as one of two events that led to the focus on greenhouse gas
removal.
</p>
<p>
Cui, though, has downplayed the meeting’s influence on the accelerator.
<a href="https://stanforddaily.com/2023/05/16/qa-yi-cui-discusses-climate-change-flagship-destinations/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>In
an interview with the </u><u><em><em>Stanford Daily</em></em></u></a>,
he said that “greenhouse gas removal has always been incredibly
important to everybody. It’s not because of the workshop.” It’s one of a
few key climate solutions he always brings up in his talks, he added.
“So it wasn’t hard at all to get to the point and say this should be the
first flagship destination.”
</p>
<p>
In an effort to build the right internal partnerships, the accelerator
is launching a
<a href="https://sustainability-accelerator.stanford.edu/stanford-sustainability-accelerator-fellowship" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>postdoc
fellowship program</u></a>, in which entrepreneurial fellows will team
up with faculty members to work on projects that align with flagship
destinations. The inaugural class should be announced by the end of
July. Cui told me the accelerator staff is also contemplating an
entrepreneur-in-residence type of program and finding ways to deepen
connections with the Stanford Graduate School of Business, which has
already partnered with the Doerr School
<a href="https://ecopreneurship.stanford.edu/programs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>for
its ecopreneurship programs</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
The point, of course, is to leverage the full weight of the Stanford
network, giving project teams access to the entrepreneurial expertise of
Silicon Valley as well as the interdisciplinary skillset among the
university’s different schools and departments. It’s a much higher-touch
experience than teams would get at other incubators or accelerators, Cui
told me.
</p>
<p>
“We actually build an ecosystem,” he explained. “We provide coaching if
it [a project] needs coaching. If it needs outside partners and
connections, we build that in, we help the team to do that. And if the
team doesn’t have an entrepreneur type of person, we might hire a person
to work with the team.”
</p>
<p>
And given the university’s reputation as, well, a tech incubator with a
(now bad, I hear) football team, Cui stressed that there’s a surprising
amount of promising research that never sees the light of day. “There
are many technologies, many solutions actually developed in Stanford
faculty’s lab — they don’t come out, you’re not even aware of them,” he
told me. But their potential in the sustainability space could be huge,
Cui said. “The accelerator’s function is super important to further grow
and amplify the entrepreneurial spirit on Stanford campus, and also
orient the faculty into working on scalable ideas.”

tells Congress youth care programs need more oversight</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Reality TV star Paris Hilton called for greater federal
oversight of youth care programs at a U.S. House of Representatives
committee hearing on Wednesday as she described her traumatic experience
in youth care facilities.</p>
<p>Hilton, 43, the great-granddaughter of Hilton Hotels founder Conrad
Hilton, has spoken publicly about the emotional and physical abuse she
endured when she was placed in residential youth treatment facilities as
a teen.</p>
<p>In remarks to the committee on Wednesday, she described being taken
from her bed in the middle of the night at age 16 and transported across
state lines to a residential facility where she experienced physical and
sexual abuse.</p>
<p>“This $23 billion industry sees this population [of vulnerable
children] as dollar signs and operates without meaningful oversight,”
she said.</p>
<p>“There’s no education in these places; there’s mold and blood on the
walls,” she said in response to lawmaker questions. “It’s horrifying
what these places are like. They’re worse than some dog kennels.”</p>
<p>Hilton said private equity firms that have taken a greater stake in
the industry in recent years focus on maximizing profits, prompting them
to hire unqualified workers.</p>
<p>“They’re caring more about profit than the safety of children,” she
said.</p>
<p>Hilton first described her experience at a Utah facility in 2021 and
has been a vocal advocate for greater oversight of the system.</p>
<p>“These programs promised ‘healing, growth, and support,’ but instead
did not allow me to speak, move freely, or even look out of a window for
two years,” Hilton told the committee. “My parents were completely
deceived, lied to and manipulated by this for-profit industry, so you
can only imagine the experience for youth who don’t have anyone checking
in on them.”</p>
<p>Several lawmakers agreed that more federal oversight was
necessary.</p>
<p>“We must always be concerned about fraud and guard against Wall
Street vultures snatching public funds to line their pockets,”
Democratic Representative Bill Pascrell said. “We cannot allow the
private equity octopus to reach its tentacles into child services.”</p>

Supreme Court seems poised to allow emergency abortions in Idaho</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court appears poised to allow emergency
abortions in Idaho when a pregnant patient’s health is at serious risk,
according to Bloomberg News, which said a copy of the opinion was
briefly posted Wednesday on the court’s website. </p>
<p>The document suggests the court will conclude that it should not have
gotten involved in the case so quickly and will reinstate a lower court
order that had allowed hospitals in the state to perform emergency
abortions to protect a pregnant patient’s health, Bloomberg said. It
does not appear likely to fully resolve the issues at the heart of the
case. </p>
<p>The Supreme Court acknowledged that a document was inadvertently
posted Wednesday. That document was quickly removed. </p>
<p>“The Court’s Publications Unit inadvertently and briefly uploaded a
document to the Court’s website. The Court’s opinion in Moyle v. United
States and Idaho v. United States will be issued in due course,” court
spokeswoman Patricia McCabe said in a statement. </p>
<p>The case would continue at the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals if
the Supreme Court dismisses the proceedings. </p>
<p>WATCH: Are abortion laws in Idaho hurting maternal health care?</p>
<p>The finding may not be the court’s final ruling because the justices’
decision has not been officially released. </p>
<p>The Biden administration sued Idaho, arguing that hospitals must
provide abortions to stabilize pregnant patients in rare emergency cases
when their health is at serious risk. </p>
<p>Most Republican-controlled states began enforcing restrictions after
the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade two years ago. Idaho is among
14 states that outlaw abortion at all stages of pregnancy with very
limited exceptions. Idaho argued its ban does allow abortions to save a
pregnant patient’s life and that federal law does not require the
exceptions to expand. </p>
<p>The opinion briefly posted would reverse the Supreme Court’s earlier
order that allowed the Idaho law to go into effect, even in medical
emergencies, while the case played out. Several women have since needed
medical airlifts out of state in cases in which abortion is routine
treatment to avoid infection, hemorrhage and other dire health risks,
Idaho doctors have said. </p>
<p>The Supreme Court’s eventual ruling could have ripple effects on
emergency care in other states with strict abortion bans. Reports of
pregnant women being turned away from U.S. emergency rooms spiked after
the Supreme Court’s 2022 ruling overturning the constitutional right to
abortion, according to federal documents obtained by The Associated
Press. </p>
<p>The Justice Department’s lawsuit came under a federal law that
requires hospitals accepting Medicare to provide stabilizing care
regardless of a patient’s ability to pay. The law is the Emergency
Medical Treatment and Labor Act, or EMTALA. </p>
<p>Nearly all hospitals accept Medicare, so emergency room doctors in
Idaho and other states with bans would have to provide abortions if
needed to stabilize a pregnant patient and avoid serious health risks
such as the loss of reproductive organs, the Justice Department
argued. </p>
<p>Idaho argued that its exception for a patient’s life covers dire
health circumstances and that the Biden administration misread the law
to circumvent the state ban and expand abortion access. </p>
<p>Doctors have said Idaho’s law has made them fearful to perform
abortions, even when a pregnancy is putting a patient’s health severely
at risk. The law requires anyone who is convicted of performing an
abortion to be imprisoned for at least two years. </p>
<p>A federal judge initially sided with the Democratic administration
and ruled that abortions were legal in medical emergencies. After the
state appealed, the Supreme Court allowed the law to go fully into
effect in January.</p>

hits back at US Congress’ call for election probe</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD — Pakistan strongly objected Wednesday to a U.S.
congressional resolution calling for an investigation into interference
and fraud allegations related to Pakistan’s February 8 parliamentary
elections.</p>
<p>“We believe that the timing and context of this particular resolution
does not align well with the positive dynamics of our bilateral ties,”
said the Foreign Ministry in Islamabad.</p>
<p>The statement said the resolution “stems from an incomplete
understanding of the political situation and electoral process” in
Pakistan.</p>
<p>The rebuke came a day after the U.S. House of Representatives
overwhelmingly voted (368-7) to approve a resolution urging “the full
and independent investigation of claims of interference or
irregularities” in Pakistan’s election.</p>
<p>The U.S. lawmakers also condemned what they described as “attempts to
suppress” participation of Pakistanis in their democracy “through
harassment, intimidation, violence, arbitrary detention, restrictions on
access to the internet and telecommunications.”</p>
<p>In its response, the Pakistan Foreign Ministry stated that Islamabad
was committed to “the values of constitutionalism, human rights, and the
rule of law in pursuance of our own national interest.” It urged the
U.S. Congress to play its role in strengthening bilateral relations and
mutual collaboration benefiting both countries.</p>
<p>“We believe in constructive dialogue and engagement based on mutual
respect and understanding. Such resolutions are, therefore, neither
constructive nor objective.”</p>
<p>Khawaja Asif, the Pakistani defense minister, also went on social
media platform X to criticize the U.S. lawmakers’ call for an impartial
election probe.</p>
<p>“This is from the country that spent the 20th century overthrowing
democratically elected governments, and currently facilitating the
Palestinian genocide,” Asif wrote. “Let’s look at their history of
irregularities in 2016 &amp; 2020 elections, both Democrats and
Republicans accused of foreign intervention and rigging, how about
asking U.N. for probe.”</p>
<p>U.S. State Department spokesperson Mathew Miller declined to comment
specifically on the resolution while addressing a regular news
conference in Washington.</p>
<p>“Our most senior officials, including Secretary [of State] Antony
Blinken and Ambassador Donald Blome [in Islamabad], have consistently,
both privately and publicly, urged Pakistan to respect the rights of its
people and live with its constitutional and international obligations,”
Miller said.</p>
<p>“We continuously urge the government of Pakistan to respect human
rights and fundamental freedoms, including the freedoms of expression,
association, peaceful assembly, religion, as well as the rights of
marginalized populations such as women and religious minorities,” he
said.</p>
<p>Analysts, such as Washington-based Michael Kugelman, said the
resolution would not have much impact on U.S. policy toward Pakistan,
noting that the Biden administration already has called for an
investigation into charges of election irregularities.</p>
<p>“But the vote does raise questions about what additional legislation
we could see re Pakistan,” Kugelman, the South Asia Institute director
at the Wilson Center, wrote on X. “What really stands out for me is the
margin of the vote, and the number of Members that voted. 85% of House
members voted on it, and 98% voted in favor of the resolution. This is
quite significant.”</p>
<p>Pakistani authorities have vehemently defended the February 8 vote
and its outcome. Opposition parties and independent domestic and foreign
observers, however, have complained of nationwide mobile phone and
internet shutdowns on the polling day, unusually delayed results, and a
state crackdown against jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan’s party
in the run-up to the election.</p>
<p>Khan, who has been in jail since last August on controversial graft
charges, was convicted in several other cases just days before election
day in an apparent bid to keep him from contesting or campaigning.</p>
<p>His Pakistani Tehreek-e-Insaf, or PTI, party was blocked from using
its iconic cricket bat symbol on ballot papers in a country where
symbols are important to help illiterate voters, in particular, identify
which party to vote for.</p>
<p>Despite the crackdown, legal setbacks and alleged military-plotted
vote rigging by election authorities, independent candidates backed by
Khan’s PTI won the most seats in the 342-seat National Assembly but were
short of a simple majority.</p>
<p>That enabled rival Pakistan Muslim League-N, or PML-N, and the
Pakistan Peoples Party, or PPP, to form a coalition government with the
backing of the military. The PML-N leader, Shehbaz Sharif, became the
prime minister.</p>
<p>Khan has since been forcefully raising the electoral fraud issue in
statements from his prison cell. PTI leaders at news conferences have
persistently stated their party was on the way to sweeping the elections
but its mandate was stolen.</p>
<p>“Washington already had been uneasy for months, frustrated, since
brazen electoral fraud in Pakistan, and it looked like the regime in
Pakistan mistook their silence as approval,” the PTI stated in its
response to Tuesday’s U.S. congressional resolution.</p>
<p>The victory of PTI-linked candidates surprised observers and was seen
as a landmark upset in Pakistan, where political success has long been
tied to the military’s backing.</p>
<p>Khan, a cricket star turned prime minister, was removed from power in
a vote of no confidence in April 2022. The 71-year-old politician
dismissed the move as illegal and plotted by the military.</p>
<p>Pakistan’s military has ousted democratically elected governments
through several coups and has ruled the country for more than three
decades since it gained independence in 1947.</p>

id="homeland-security-border-arrests-fell-more-than-40-since-bidens-halt-to-asylum-processing">Homeland
Security: Border arrests fell more than 40% since Biden’s halt to asylum
processing</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>TUCSON, Arizona — Arrests for illegal border crossings have dropped
more than 40% during the three weeks that asylum processing has been
suspended, the Homeland Security Department said Wednesday. </p>
<p>The announcement comes just one day before President Joe Biden is set
to debate former President and presumptive Republican presidential
nominee Donald Trump in what is expected to be a crucial moment in the
election campaign. </p>
<p>Biden is considered especially vulnerable with voters when it comes
to immigration. Trump has hammered him repeatedly on border security by
painting a picture of the border as out of control and migrants as a
threat to the nation’s security and economy. </p>
<p>Biden has both sought to crack down on new arrivals at the border and
to offer new immigration pathways. </p>
<p>The restrictions he announced at the beginning of June cut off asylum
access when arrivals at the border reached a certain number, infuriating
immigration advocates who say the policy differs little from what Trump
attempted. Then a few weeks later Biden announced a new program aimed at
undocumented spouses of American citizens who had been in the country
for a decade or more that could ultimately provide them a pathway to
citizenship. </p>
<p>The figures announced Wednesday by the Department of Homeland
Security show that the Border Patrol’s average daily arrests over a
seven-day period have fallen below 2,400, down more than 40% from before
Biden’s proclamation took effect June 5. That’s still above the 1,500
mark needed to resume asylum processing, but Homeland Security says it
marks the lowest number since Jan. 17, 2021, just before Biden took
office.</p>
<p>Last week, Customs and Border Protection said in its monthly release
of statistics that border arrests had fallen 25% since Biden’s order
took effect, indicating they have decreased much more since then. </p>
<p>The monthly data releases are a closely watched metric of border
security and how many people are coming to the southern border of the
U.S. The numbers reached a record high last December before falling
roughly in half in January and staying in that range throughout the
spring. A large part of that decrease was believed to be due to Mexican
enforcement on its side of the border. </p>
<p>Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas was to address
reporters Wednesday in Tucson, Arizona, the busiest corridor for illegal
crossings during much of the last year. U.S. authorities say the
seven-day daily average of arrests in the Border Patrol’s Tucson sector
was just under 600 on Tuesday, down from just under 1,200 on June
2. </p>
<p>Speaking to MSNBC/Morning Joe on Wednesday, Mayorkas said the numbers
were moving in the right direction and lauded the agency’s staff. But he
also noted that opponents have sued to stop the restrictions. </p>
<p>“We are conducting more removal flights than ever before. We are
moving people through the system and those who do not qualify are being
removed or returned more rapidly. It’s a remarkable feat that our
personnel have accomplished in just such a short period of time. It’s
really important to remember though that the president’s executive
action is being challenged in the court,” Mayorkas said. </p>
<p>Under the asylum suspension, which takes effect when daily arrests
are above 2,500, anyone who expresses fear or an intention to seek
asylum is screened by a U.S. asylum officer but at a higher standard
than currently used. If they pass the screening, they can pursue more
limited forms of humanitarian protection than asylum, including the U.N.
Convention Against Torture.</p>

<h2 id="mozilla-integrating-ai-chatbots-into-firefox">Mozilla
integrating AI chatbots into Firefox</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-26, from: OS News</p>
<p>Mozilla has announced it’s adding easy access to tool like ChatGPT,
Gemini, and so to Firefox. Whether it’s a local or a cloud-based model,
if you want to use AI, we think you should have the freedom to use (or
not use) the tools that best suit your needs. With that in mind, this
week, we will launch an opt-in experiment offering access to preferred
AI services in Nightly for improved productivity as you browse. Instead
of juggling between tabs or apps for assistance, those who have opted-in
will have the option to access their preferred AI service from the
Firefox sidebar to summarize information, simplify language, or test
their knowledge, all without leaving their current web page.  Our
initial offering will include ChatGPT, Google Gemini, HuggingChat, and
Le Chat Mistral, but we will continue adding AI services that meet our
standards for quality and user experience. ↫ Ian Carmichael My biggest
worry is not so much Mozilla adding these tools to Firefox – other
browsers are doing it, and people clearly want to use them, so it makes
sense for Firefox, too, to integrate them into the browser. No, my
biggest worry is that this is just the first step on the way to the next
major revenue agreement – just as Google is paying Mozilla to be the
default search engine in Firefox, what if OpenAI starts paying to be the
default AI tool in Firefox? Once that happens, I’m afraid a lot of the
verbiage around choice and the ability to easily disable it all is going
to change. I’m still incredibly annoyed by the fact I have to dive into
about:config just to properly remove Pocket, a service I do not use, do
not want, and annoys me by taking up space in my UI. I’m afraid that one
or two years from now, AI integration will be just another complex set
of strings I need to look for in about:config to truly disable it all.
It definitely feels like Firefox is only going to get worse from here on
out, not better, and this AI stuff seems more like an invitation for a
revenue agreement than something well thought-out and useful. We’ll see
where things go from here, but my worries about Firefox’ future are only
growing stronger with Mozilla’s latest moves. As a Linux user, this
makes me worried.</p>

Supreme Court rules for Biden administration in social media dispute
with conservative states</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The Supreme Court on Wednesday sided with the Biden
administration in a dispute with Republican-led states over how far the
federal government can go to combat controversial social media posts on
topics including COVID-19 and election security. </p>
<p>By a 6-3 vote, the justices threw out lower-court rulings that
favored Louisiana, Missouri and other parties in their claims that
officials in the Democratic administration leaned on the social media
platforms to unconstitutionally squelch conservative points of
view. </p>
<p>Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote for the court that the states and
other parties did not have the legal right, or standing, to sue. </p>
<p>Justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas
dissented. </p>
<p>The case is among several before the court this term that affect
social media companies in the context of free speech. In February, the
court heard arguments over Republican-passed laws in Florida and Texas
that prohibit large social media companies from taking down posts
because of the views they express. In March, the court laid out
standards for when public officials can block their social media
followers. </p>
<p>The cases over state laws and the one that was decided Wednesday are
variations on the same theme, complaints that the platforms are
censoring conservative viewpoints. </p>
<p>The states had argued that White House communications staffers, the
surgeon general, the FBI and the U.S. cybersecurity agency are among
those who applied “unrelenting pressure” to coerce changes in online
content on social media platforms. </p>
<p>But the justices appeared broadly skeptical of those claims during
arguments in March and several worried that common interactions between
government officials and the platforms could be affected by a ruling for
the states. </p>
<p>The Biden administration underscored those concerns when it noted
that the government would lose its ability to communicate with the
social media companies about antisemitic and anti-Muslim posts, as well
as on issues of national security, public health and election
integrity. </p>
<p>The Supreme Court had earlier acted to keep the lower-court rulings
on hold. Justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas would
have allowed the restrictions on government contacts with the platforms
to go into effect. </p>
<p>Free speech advocates had urged the court to use the case to draw an
appropriate line between the government’s acceptable use of the bully
pulpit and coercive threats to free speech. </p>
<p>A panel of three judges on the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals had ruled earlier that the Biden administration had
probably brought unconstitutional pressure on the media platforms. The
appellate panel said officials cannot attempt to “coerce or
significantly encourage” changes in online content. The panel had
previously narrowed a more sweeping order from a federal judge, who
wanted to include even more government officials and prohibit mere
encouragement of content changes. </p>
<p>The case is Murthy v. Missouri, 23-411.</p>

Coolest Thing in Climate Tech Just Got More Buyers</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-26, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjUwMjY2Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2NjYyMTA3OH0.IUkl8-C_vedP-vY6LO33tP_3Azz28_WJw8O5lmXnmUU/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
Rondo Energy, a Silicon Valley startup building “heat batteries” to
replace fossil fuels in heavy industries, announced three new customers
on Wednesday. In just a few months’ time, the company has gone from
serving a single industry — ethanol — at its pilot plant in California,
to making deals around the globe that demonstrate the technology’s
potential versatility.
</p>
<p>
With grant funding from Breakthrough Energy Catalyst, as well as the
European Investment Bank, the company will install three
commercial-scale batteries at factories in Denmark, Germany, and
Portugal. Each one will prove Rondo’s compatibility with a different
industry: In Denmark, the battery will be used to produce low-carbon
biogas. In Germany, it will power a Covestro chemical plant that
produces polymers. In Portugal, it will power a to-be-announced food and
beverage factory.
</p>
<p>
Rondo warms up literal tons of bricks to more than 1,000 degrees Celsius
(more than 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit) using electric heaters powered by
renewable energy. The bricks can retain the heat for up to 18 hours, my
colleague Katie Brigham
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/antora-rondo-energy-thermal-batteries" target="_self"><u>reported
earlier this year</u></a>. When the heat is needed, air flows through
the system and releases energy as either hot air or steam. At the site
in Denmark, for instance, the battery will generate high pressure steam
to drive a turbine generator, delivering steady heat and power to the
plant. Rondo sells the energy as a service, retaining ownership and
control of the equipment.
</p>
<p>
The projects announced Wednesday follow a series of recent deals across
a diverse list of industries: a cement plant in Thailand, a plastic
recycling plant in Texas, and even whiskey — Diageo will use the tech to
electrify its Bulleit Bourbon plant in Kentucky. The fast fashion giant
<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hm-group-invests-in-rondo-energy-to-further-strengthen-their-climate-strategy-302176925.html" style="" target="_blank">H&amp;M
is exploring use of the tech</a>, and the company has also announced
partnerships with the renewable energy developer EDP as well as Saudi
Aramco.<strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
<span></span>As Katie noted in her piece, there are a lot of
technologies competing to solve the challenge of producing
industrial-grade heat. Carbon capture and storage equipment can be added
to existing fossil fuel boilers, or natural gas and coal can be replaced
with clean hydrogen fuel. There are also industrial heat pumps that can
produce lower-temperature heat. But all of these solutions have the same
challenge — overcoming the “green premium” compared with the fossil fuel
boilers and furnaces used today.
</p>
<p>
Just because Rondo has made inroads in some industries, doesn’t mean all
its potential customers are ready or able to fork over that green
premium today. That’s why, in addition to being an investor in Rondo,
Breakthrough Energy Catalyst decided to provide grant funding to these
three new deployments, said Mario Fernandez, the head of the Catalyst
program. The hope is these projects will help bring down the cost and
catalyze greater adoption.

Is Sending a Conservative Climate Believer to the Senate</h2>

<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjUwMjY0MC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1MDA0Mjk2Mn0.ILSdj8F8CiuTJV30gjjZqN_R0TQCgpaoGMvGF3ga9gk/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
The United States Senate is almost certainly getting another Republican
who at least thinks climate change is a real problem.
</p>
<p>
Utah Congressman John Curtis, the founder of the Conservative Climate
Caucus, won the Republican primary for Mitt Romney’s Senate seat over a
gaggle of more conservative opponents, including one endorsed by former
president Donald Trump. The primary victory puts Curtis in position to
win the general election in November. (Utah hasn’t elected a Democrat to
the Senate since 1970.)
</p>
<p>
His victory was fueled in part by conservative environmental groups and
donors, who put considerable resources toward his campaign. American
Conservation Coalition Action, which seeks to mobilize young
conservatives around climate, endorsed Curtis and hosted events with
him, while its affiliated political action committee, ACC PAC, knocked
on doors in Utah and<strong> </strong>spent around $250,000 in support
of his candidacy,
<a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/american-conservation-coalition/C00877233/independent-expenditures/2024" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>according
to OpenSecrets</u></a>. The most substantial support came from Clear
Path Action, another center-right environmental group, which has spent
<a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/outside-spending/detail/2024?cmte=C00608943&tab=targeted_candidates" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>almost
$500,000</u></a> so far on Curtis, making up the overwhelming majority
of its spending this cycle. The group’s founder,
<a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/receipts/individual-contributions/?committee_id=C00855064" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Jay
Faison</u></a>, is the biggest donor (to the tune of $2 million) to
Conservatives Values for Utah,
<a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/outside-spending/detail/2024?cmte=C00855064&tab=targeted_candidates" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>an
outside group that’s spent $5 million to boost Curtis</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
During his four terms in the House, Curtis largely steered clear of
large scale, Democrat-backed climate and energy bills, instead
supporting energy policies that have or could have broad, bipartisan
support. He worked on the legislation that would
<a href="https://curtis.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=3281" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>become
the ADVANCE Act</u></a>, the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/advance-act-nuclear" target="_self"><u>nuclear
regulatory reform bill</u></a> that passed the House and Senate with
huge bipartisan majorities; he’s also a
<a href="https://x.com/RepJohnCurtis/status/1795554909179216350" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>supporter
of geothermal energy</u></a>, and has introduced legislation to ease the
permitting process for new projects. Like all Republicans in Congress,
he voted against the Inflation Reduction Act, and, like most Republicans
in Congress, he also opposed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act,
more typically called the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which contained
billions of clean energy funding.
</p>
<p>
Curtis is unlikely to garner support from the mainstream environmental
groups that typically support Democrats, especially considering his
opponent, Caroline Gleich, is an environmental activist. But he has
gotten far more respectful notice than is typical for Republicans.The
Sierra Club’s
<a href="https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/john-curtis-utah-republican-wants-make-climate-change-bipartisan-issue" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>magazine</u></a>
profiled Curtis earlier this year, saying he “would be one of the few —
perhaps the only — Senate Republicans who say that climate action is a
priority.”
</p>
<p>
But Curtis is still unmistakably a Republican. Yes, he attended the
United Nations climate conference in the United Arab Emirates and
<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/un-delegates-circulate-petition-shut-down-us-natural-gas-production-global-climate-summit-kicks-off" target="_blank"><u>told
Fox News</u></a>, “the goal at COP should be to reduce global emissions,
not energy choices;” but afterward,
<a href="https://www.deseret.com/2023/12/12/23997075/john-curtis-conservative-climate-caucus-cop28-fossil-fuels/" target="_blank"><u>he
also told the </u><u><em><em>Deseret News</em></em></u></a>, “you’re not
going to replace [fossil fuels] with windmills and solar farms,’ and “we
need to start having a discussion about the role of fossil fuels in our
clean energy future.”
<a href="https://www.climateone.org/audio/two-voices-climate-will-surprise-you" target="_blank"><u>When
he appeared on the </u><u><em><em>Climate One</em></em></u><u>
podcast</u></a>, he said his interest in climate change derived from “an
innate desire to be good stewards over this earth,” but also insisted
that “it’s been a mistake to focus solely on fossil fuels [as] the
problem here.”
</p>
<p>
It’s unlikely that Curtis will show up in the Senate and
<a href="https://www.budget.senate.gov/chairman/newsroom/press/whitehouse-raskin-urge-doj-to-investigate-fossil-fuel-disinformation-" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>demand
investigations of fossil fuel companies</u></a>. More likely, he’ll
continue his efforts to
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/popular-senate-carbon-tariff-bill-gains-house-champions/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>respond
to Europe’s carbon border adjustment</u></a> alongside fellow
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/carbon-border-adjustment-manchin-cassidy" target="_self"><u>Republican
Bill Cassidy of Louisiana</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
“Representative Curtis’ thought leadership on environmental issues while
staying true to his conservative values is a major step forward for the
conservative environmental movement. We’re fortunate to have a strong
ally like Representative Curtis in Congress, and we’re excited to
hopefully continue working with him in the Senate to make America the
most prosperous and cleanest country in the world,” ACC Action chief
executive Danielle Butcher Franz told me in an emailed statement.
</p>
<p>
Curtis’ conservative environmentalism has helped him fundraise, but it’s
also been the
<a href="https://www.deseret.com/2024/1/13/24035509/rep-john-curtis-republican-debate-over-climate-change-senate-campaign/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>primary
line of attack</u></a> from his more conservative opponents, who seek to
paint him as too liberal for the conservative state and whose climate
politics are, at best, a misplaced priority, and at worst, at bat signal
for out of state donors. (Faison, Curtis’ biggest supporter, lives in
North Carolina.)
</p>
<p>
Curtis will likely join a small gaggle of Republican Senators who push
policies to support American clean energy while remaining skeptical of
the Democratic Party’s efforts to restrict fossil fuels, including
Cassidy and Alaska Senator

Our current projections for sea level rise from the melting ice sheets

published in the journal <em><em>Nature Geoscience</em></em>. The
researchers said they identified a potential melting process by which
warm seawater makes its way into the gap between the ice and the ground
beneath it, known as the “grounding zone.” This water melts holes in the
ice, allowing more warm water through, creating a feedback loop. “We
find that grounding zone melting displays a ‘tipping point like’
behavior, where a very small change in ocean temperature can cause a
very big increase in grounding zone melting, which would lead to a very
big change in flow of the ice above
it,”<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jun/25/newly-identified-tipping-point-for-ice-sheets-could-mean-greater-sea-level-rise?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8YNFYnOkwjo-E_wMQPnGB0bNuxTJxggag-_WecfI-1RRhfwx_ysgcoURikssQRzFBLnDkE" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
said Alex Bradley</a>, an ice dynamics researcher at the British
Antarctic Survey and lead author of the new paper. Bradley said this
finding could help explain why the ice sheets in Antarctica and
Greenland are melting faster than scientists would expect, and called
for incorporating seawater intrusion into the existing models.

<li>Denmark will become first country in the world to tax farmers for

</h3>
<p>
In a world first, Denmark will start taxing farmers for the methane
their livestock emit. Methane is a very potent greenhouse gas, and
livestock are a major source of emissions because ruminant animals like
cows belch the stuff. Denmark’s new measure will charge farmers the
equivalent of about $17 per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent starting in
2030, increasing to roughly $28 by 2035.

to</a> <em>The Associated Press</em>, a typical Danish cow produces
methane emissions equivalent to 6.6 tons of CO2, so the new tax could
add up to about $112 per year per cow in 2030, jumping to nearly $185
per cow per year by 2035. The hope is that other countries follow
Denmark’s lead and that the tax will “lay the groundwork for a
restructured food industry.”

watches other EV startups go under. But VW also needs something out of
this. We unpack. Plus, why it’s so difficult to maintain America’s aging
bridge infrastructure and how the market for online comics is doing as
Webtoon Entertainment looks to go public.

Congress just passed perhaps its biggest support for zero-carbon energy
since the Inflation Reduction Act. The ADVANCE Act, which the Senate
adopted overwhelmingly last week, aims to keep America at the cutting
edge of the global nuclear industry by cutting regulatory fees, making
it easier for U.S. companies to build nuclear power plants abroad, and
reforming the agency that oversees it all, the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission.

<a href="https://www.thirdway.org/about/staff/ryan-norman" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ryan
Norman</a>, a senior policy advisor at Third Way’s climate and energy
program, about how America got here. We talk about why nuclear is such a
bipartisan issue, what the ADVANCE Act will actually do, and how soon
new nuclear power plants could actually get built. Shift Key is hosted
by Robinson Meyer, the founding executive editor of Heatmap, and Jesse
Jenkins, a professor of energy systems engineering at Princeton

Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Ryan Norman:</strong> The U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission
has a very well-regarded reputation, around the world partially because
of the way it thinks about layers of different issues.<br/> <br/>
Stepping back for a brief second, when we talk about these relationships
with other countries — I had mentioned that it’s an interagency option,
but it’s also much deeper than financial. There’s a market piece, but
there’s also a long-term relationship that you end up building with the
country because your regulators understand each other. You’ve built a
relationship with the international regulators and the monitoring
agencies. You’re more or less introduced into that relationship by your
partner, so by the U.S,. or by the French, or the Koreans, or whoever it
is. So there’s a long-term relationship of trust that needs to be built
there between those two poles.<br/> <br/> So it’s really important that
you work with a country that has experience mitigating some of these
social issues and working that into the process effectively. Because
when those disputes happen in a partner country, they want to be able to
replicate the discourse process of transparency and all the different
things that the NRC does.<br/><br/> When you think about how that
translates to some of our competitors, countries like Russia and China,
the dynamic of those countries’ regulators in the industry is very
opaque. It’s much closer to the way the NRC’s precursor, the Atomic
Energy Commission, used to operate in the United States, right? There’s
just a lot of issues that those industries in Russia and China aren’t
concerned with. Practically speaking, there’s no such thing as
environmental or energy justice in China, right? Like there’s no
community benefits plan process that they have to go through to build a
new reactor. They have a lot of space. The density is very different.
The authority and the permitting process is so different that they
basically just make a decision and that’s how it goes.<br/> <br/> So
then that means that when you’re basing — when a country, you know, like
a partner like Ghana, for example, is trying to base, okay, how do I
want my regulator to look? Well, if I take the structure they have in
another country that is not used to incorporating social engagement and
understanding around some of these issues, and really mitigating social
backlash, you’re really just replicating a system that is not going to
be as equitable as what you could do if you were a partner with the U.S.
So it’s another reason that U.S. leadership is really an
imperative.<br/> <br/> <strong>Robinson Meyer: </strong>And this is what
makes nuclear reactors so different from solar, or onshore wind, or
really any kind of wind or other kinds of energy technologies, I
suppose, is that you’re signing up … You alluded to, like, a 50-year
agreement, basically, between two countries, and you’re pledging a very
long-term integration between those two regulatory states. In between,
for lack of better term, energy-planning elites in those two
countries.<br/> <br/><strong>Norman: </strong>Yeah, they call it the
100-year relationship, and that’s a long time. But it’s super real, and
it’s super important because there’s a lot of influence that comes with
being an energy partner, and you have the ability and I would say even
the responsibility to guide that energy partner to do things responsibly
and do things equitably. And I think that if we want a clean energy
future that is abundant but also just, we can’t just defer leadership in
these spaces to folks who are not focused on these principles.

<h2 id="the-living-computers-museum-finally-isnt">The Living Computers
Museum finally isn’t</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-26, from: Old Vintage Computer Research</p>
First off, apologies for a quiet month as I’ve been dealing with family
matters which hopefully are now on a better footing (more articles are
in the hopper). Unfortunately, the same apparently can’t be said for the
once-great Living Computers Museum + Labs in Seattle, established by the
late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and closed in 2020 during the COVID
pandemic after his death,
<a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/seattles-living-computers-museum-logs-off-for-good-as-paul-allen-estate-will-auction-vintage-items/">at
least some of which is going up for auction</a>. The specific pieces
have not yet been announced by Christie’s, but will ostensibly include
<a href="https://www.christies.com/en/stories/gen-one-innovations-from-the-paul-g-allen-collection-1f0df60a726e4dcbabef3a91a57ef7ee#section-mx815mb7Yb">his
personal DECsystem-10</a>, a 1971 KI10 DEC PDP-10 from the MIT AI Lab
which is the first computer he and Bill Gates ever used. (There’s just
something about your first. I still have
<a href="/2024/03/after-41-years-my-first-assembly.html">my actual first
computer</a> too, and with only around 1500 systems built the unit at
the LCM was apparently the exact machine they used also. Here’s a
picture of it from <a href="https://obsolescence.dev/pidp10.html">when
it was in residence</a> at the LCM and used to develop a replica.)
<p>
Obviously, while I think it’s a crying shame, the estate can do what it
likes with its own stuff and I hope the machine, plus the other 149
pieces reportedly to be auctioned off, goes to someone who appreciates
it. (Bill Gates himself perhaps.) What’s more problematic is the people
who donated systems and peripherals with the expectation they would
remain there in some capacity, especially since the museum reportedly
didn’t accept items as long-term loans. (Wikipedia has
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_Computers:_Museum_%2B_Labs">a
substantially complete list of those items</a>.) That’s not <i>per
se</i> an unreasonable position, and one that helps protect the museum,
but it’s also one that leaves their prior owners with no firm recourse
for recovery before they get liquidated or scrapped in a situation like
this. Throwing them away is bad enough but if those items also go up for
sale, though doing so <em>may</em> be technically legal depending on how
the transfer was written up, it’s pretty darn sleazy. Allen’s estate,
notably his sister Jody who is the trustee and executrix, would then be
profiting off items donated in good faith on the understanding that
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFmhRLiYho0">they would be in a
museum</a>. That’s bad and they should feel bad.
<p>
But then perhaps museums aren’t what they used to be. On <tt>cctalk</tt>
someone mentioned the now defunct? National Museum of Communications in
Irving, TX which downsized in 1998 by taking about five commercial
dumpsters’ worth of radios and other items to the dump. It looks like
<a href="https://www.museumsusa.org/museums/info/15631">one guy ran that
shop</a> and it probably became too large for him to handle, a story
which is probably more common than most of us know, though it’s still
bad news for the equipment that got junked — some of which was almost
certainly rare or irreplaceable, even if specific items themselves
weren’t particularly valuable. Every collector has had well-intentioned
dreams at one time or another of opening our own museums, not realizing
that they turn into massive sinks of time and money and regulatory
filings, and they’re never as much fun to operate as the private
computer room or display case you used to have in your house. Situations
like this should also remind us that donating our own beloved items to
any institution in the hopes they’ll “survive” us is no guarantee
they’ll remain there either.
<p>
<p>We’re amateurs, though. Paul Allen, on the other hand, was not an
amateur and was an incredibly wealthy man who had to have some awareness
of estate planning, and one who knew his cancer was likely to return. It
is widely reputed that the LCM was expensive to run and hard to manage
even with his sizeable fortune and a lot of diligent volunteers. Now his
collection and quite a few artifacts I imagine some folks would like
back are in the hands of his sister, who allegedly doesn’t have any
interest in them other than the price they might fetch. Let that be a
lesson to us that no one and nothing lives forever.</p>

Hi, I was curious about browsing some of the pre-2000s sources for A2,
particularly to see the history of the X11 interface

I tried using <code>git-svn</code> to pull the history from the ETH
hosted SVN server, but it doesn't appear to work unfortunately. I could
try again or take some pointers, but I don't want to blindly mash
against what's meant to be an archive. Maybe the SVN repo could be
dumped to an object storage service as a permanent download? In general
I think it would be illustrative to have a more complete history of the
source code, but I understand if that's not a priority of the faculty.
Thanks!

There will be many chances this week to dissect why two-term New York
Congressman Jamaal Bowman lost his primary to Westchester County
Executive George Latimer,
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/25/nyregion/bowman-latimer-house-new-york.html?smid=url-share" target="_blank">which
<em>The Associated Press</em> called</a> less than an hour after the
polls closed on Tuesday. Post mortems will focus on the financial angle
(the 16th District primary was
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/06/24/bowman-latimer-primary-israel-race/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
most expensive</u></a> in House history) and, of course, the
Israel-Palestine angle (nearly $15 million alone came from an American
Israel Public Affairs Committee-affiliated super PAC that aggressively

<a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/house/2024/new-york/16/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
forgone conclusion</u></a> and point to the disturbing way Latimer
<a href="https://www.thehandbasket.co/p/george-latimer-jamaal-bowman-white-grievance?utm_source=www.thehandbasket.co&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=jamaal-bowman-s-democratic-primary-challenger-has-run-a-campaign-on-white-grievance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>co-opted

<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/jamaal-bowman-george-latimer-aipac-israel-zionism-new-york-race.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>by
shifting too far to the left</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
It’s probably still a stretch to say that Bowman’s<strong><i>
</i></strong>resounding loss was a referendum on progressive climate
movements like
<a href="https://www.sunrisemovement.org/endorsement/jamaal-bowman-for-new-yorks-16th-2024/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Sunrise</u></a>,
which attached itself both to Bowman and to the
<a href="https://www.bxtimes.com/bowman-rally-aoc-sanders/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Green
New Deal</u></a>. But look at it the other way around: In the context of
Governor Kathy Hochul’s reneging on
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/kathy-hochul-nyc-congestion-pricing" target="_self"><u>congestion
pricing</u></a> and the state legislature’s
<a href="https://nysfocus.com/2024/04/19/new-york-heat-act-state-budget" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>failure
to pass the NY HEAT Act</u></a>, one of the
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/green-new-deal-backers-in-danger-of-losing-primaries/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>staunchest
allies</u></a> of progressive climate policy losing his election
represents another blow to
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/08/climate/new-york-california-climate-race.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>New
York’s image</u></a> as a national leader on the issue — and its ability
to remain one.
</p>
<p>
The Sunrise Movement played a pivotal role in Bowman’s 2020 win against
30-year incumbent Eliot Engel — who was, himself, an original co-sponsor
of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s Green New Deal bill. But Bowman, then 44,
represented
<a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/16062020/new-york-progressive-establishment-incumbent-eliot-engel-jamaal-bowman/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
fresh face</u></a> for environmentally minded progressives in a district
that once voted more overwhelmingly for Barack Obama
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120218060409/http://www.swingstateproject.com/showDiary.do?diaryId=4161" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>than
any other locality in the county</u></a>. When Bowman ultimately
defeated the then-73-year-old establishment figure, he also became the
first Black representative of
<a href="https://censusreporter.org/profiles/50000US3616-congressional-district-16-ny/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
majority minority district</u></a> that covers the southern half of
Westchester County and the northern lip of the Bronx.
</p>

<p>
Fast-forward to 2024, and the Sunrise Movement is
<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/sunrise-movement-climate-change-biden-endorse-election-trump-gaza.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>going
through a reckoning</u></a> of its own over whether President Biden’s
climate record outweighs his handling of the crisis in Gaza.
(Ironically, Bowman “probably had the worst politics on the issue of any
Squad member early on in his tenure,” the progressive <em><em>Discourse
Blog</em></em>
<a href="https://www.discourseblog.com/p/of-course-jamaal-bowman-is-right" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has
argued</u></a>.)
</p>
<p>
That’s not to say that the climate is “losing” to Middle East policy in
Americans’ hearts and minds, exactly; on the contrary, climate
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/climate-change-voting-elections" target="_self"><u>is
a proven election winner</u></a>, albeit
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/climate-inflation-poll" target="_self"><u>not
always in those words</u></a>. “The NY16 race is a setback for the
climate movement, but it also shows the popularity of our ideas,” Saul
Levin, the campaigns and political director of the Green New Deal
Network, wrote me. “It took the most money in primary history and GOP
donors to buy Green New Deal champion Jamaal Bowman’s seat.”
</p>
<p>
But elections are about, and influenced by, many things, and whatever
the combination of reasons may be, the truth stands that with Bowman’s
defeat, Congress is now down one more progressive climate ally than it
otherwise would have been. (Latimer has called climate change an
“<a href="https://x.com/LatimerforNY/status/1782425052513755604" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>existential
threat</u></a>” but has not foregrounded it as a primary concern.)
</p>
<p>
Bowman’s loss might not sound like much in the bigger picture of the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/8-climate-races-election-2024" target="_self"><u>many
climate elections</u></a> happening this year — including, of course,
the Big One. But if former President Donald Trump manages to take back
the White House this November, every House and Senate seat sympathetic
to the urgent realities of climate change
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-climate-change-project-2025" target="_self"><u>will
matter critically</u></a>. That’s not to say, necessarily, that Latimer
<em><em>won’t</em></em> fight for such causes, but it seems unlikely
he’ll be a leader the way Bowman and other Squad members have been, at
times pushing more centrist Democrats further to the left and to action.
</p>
<p>
So yes, you can draw many conclusions from the 16th District primary —
that it represents the
<a href="https://theprincetonprogressive.com/what-went-wrong-with-the-sunrise-movement/" target="_blank"><u>collapse</u></a>
of the progressive influence of groups like Sunrise; or that, with
Bowman being the first Squad member to lose reelection, it reveals a
growing impatience with
<a href="https://www.axios.com/2021/11/09/aoc-squad-defend-infrastructure-no-vote" target="_blank"><u>absolutist
politics</u></a>; or that big-money interests have finally figured out a
winning strategy in outspending scrappy underdogs; or how all these
things in combination might spell trouble for Biden in a few months. But
a loss is a loss, and it’s the nature of post mortems to leave out the
most important question: What happens next?

transportation official says railroad company interfered with derailment
probe</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>EAST PALESTINE, Ohio — The head of the National Transportation Safety
Board said Tuesday that Norfolk Southern repeatedly tried to interfere
with the agency’s investigation into the derailment in East Palestine,
Ohio, and shape its conclusions about the flawed decision to blow open
five tank cars and burn the vinyl chloride inside. </p>
<p>The NTSB also confirmed at Tuesday’s hearing that the February 2023
derailment was caused by a wheel bearing that video showed was on fire
for 32.19 kilometers (more than 20 miles) beforehand but wasn’t caught
in time by inaccurate trackside detectors. The board also approved more
than two dozen recommendations to prevent similar disasters, including
establishing federal rules for those detectors and the way railroads
respond to them along with reviewing how officials decide whether to
ever conduct a vent and burn again. </p>
<p>More than three dozen freight cars derailed February 3, 2023, on the
outskirts of East Palestine near the Pennsylvania border, including 11
carrying hazardous materials. Some residents were evacuated that night,
but days later more had to leave their homes amid fears of an imminent
explosion. Despite potential health effects, officials intentionally
released and burned toxic vinyl chloride three days after the crash,
sending flames and smoke into the air.</p>

<h2 id="ecuador-ends-visa-free-entry-for-chinese-nationals">Ecuador ends
visa-free entry for Chinese nationals</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Austin, Texas — Ecuador says it will suspend visa-free entry into the
country for Chinese citizens, starting July 1, citing a “worrying”
increase in irregular migration. </p>
<p>Over the past few years, Ecuador has been the starting point for many
of the thousands of Chinese citizens who have decided to take the long
and treacherous journey through South America, Central America and
Mexico to reach the southern U.S. border.</p>
<p>Some who have already migrated to the United States say Ecuador’s
decision and the growing resolve of both Washington and Beijing to stop
the flow of illegal migration is a sign that the door may be closing for
those seeking to “zouxian” or “walk the line” – as the journey is
popularly described in Chinese.</p>
<p>Wang Zhongwei, a 33-year-old Chinese from Anhui, came to the U.S. by
“walking the line” from Ecuador in May 2023. He said that after the
Ecuadorian government’s announcement, “the discussion [among Chinese
illegal immigrants] has been heated, and this has a great impact
[because] more than 80% of the people came through Ecuador.”</p>
<p>According to U.S. Customs and Border Patrol statistics, the monthly
number of encounters for Chinese nationals at the southwestern border
hit a record high of nearly 6,000 in December of 2023. In recent months,
those encounters have started to come down, slipping to just more than
3,600 in May.</p>
<p>In addition to a recent decision by U.S. President Joe Biden to
temporarily restrict asylum eligibility at the U.S.-Mexico border, there
are signs that Washington and Beijing are finding ways or at least
trying to work together on the issue.  </p>
<p>In May, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the Associated
Press that Beijing is “willing to maintain dialogue and cooperation with
the United States in the field of immigration enforcement” and accept
the repatriation of people with verified Chinese nationality.</p>
<p>In April, U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas told
a congressional hearing that he had “engaged” with his Chinese
counterparts and that China had begun to accept the repatriation of
Chinese immigrants who have no legal basis to stay in the United
States.</p>
<p>VOA emailed the Department of Homeland Security to inquire about
U.S.-Chinese cooperation on the deportation of Chinese nationals but did
not receive a response by the time of publication.</p>
<p>Guo Bin, a Chinese citizen from Guangxi who arrived in the United
States at the end of last year with his 12-year-old daughter, said he
has heard of some Chinese who “walked the line” being deported in Los
Angeles since May.</p>
<p>“There are indeed deportations, and they can be deported on the
spot,” he said.</p>
<p>According to posts from social media influencer Teacher Li, Chinese
authorities recently issued two documents to public prosecutors that
highlight their determination to crack down on those who “walk the line”
and to strengthen border control.</p>
<p>VOA could not independently verify the authenticity of the documents,
but when it asked the Chinese Embassy about the documents the spokesman
did not say they were fabricated.</p>
<p>In an emailed response to questions about the post, Liu Pengyu,
spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in the U.S. said: “China’s Supreme
Court performs its duty in keeping with the law.”</p>
<p>“On illegal migration, China’s position is clear and consistent,” he
said. “We oppose and firmly combat all forms of illegal migration and
human smuggling.”</p>
<p>Li also said that “China’s law-enforcement agencies are working with
the relevant countries to combat human smuggling and on extradition as
well, in a joint effort to uphold the orderly flow of people across the
countries.”</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Mexico strengthened its border control by setting
up new checkpoints on major roads and increasing patrols at the more
heavily used crossing points into the U.S. More illegal migrants have
been intercepted as a result. </p>
<p>According to the Washington Office on Latin America, Mexican
immigration forces set a new record for the number of immigrant arrests
in a single month in January and February of this year.</p>
<p>Guo said that he has heard about some Chinese who were intercepted
while crossing Mexico. </p>
<p>“U.S. immigration officers cooperate with the Mexican government and
go deep into central Mexico to intercept immigrants,” he said. </p>
<p>Once Chinese migrants are intercepted, they are sent to southern
Mexico, he said.</p>
<p>If they want to continue “walking the line,” they must start again
from a place farther away from the U.S., which will cost them more money
and time.</p>
<p>Challenges aside, Wang and Guo say there are still ways to make it to
the border. </p>
<p>Wang says the desire of people to leave China is still strong and
that some are exploring new routes. </p>
<p>“You can fly to Cuba, and you can also fly to Bolivia,” Wang
said.</p>
<p>In May, the Cuban government began allowing 90-day visa-free entry
for Chinese citizens. Bolivia allows Chinese citizens holding ordinary
passports to receive tourist visas upon arrival. Those with a transit
visa can stay for 15 days or on a tourist visa for 30 days.</p>
<p>The straight-line distance from Cuba to the southernmost tip of
Florida is about 150 km. The narrow waterway has been a smuggling route
for decades. And some Chinese have already tried, despite the risks.</p>
<p>In October 2023, authorities in Florida say, 11 male and six female
Chinese citizens were arrested after illegally entering Key Largo,
Florida, from Cuba.</p>
<p>Li Xiaosan, a Chinese dissident, arrived in the U.S. in February 2023
by “walking the line.” He says he feels fortunate to be able to start a
new life and sad for others who want to leave China now. Since arriving
in the U.S., Li opened a translation company in New York and has passed
his preliminary hearing for his political asylum application. He also
obtained a work permit.</p>
<p>He says that once Ecuador’s new policy takes effect on July 1, even
if Chinese people use other routes, the chances of successfully reaching
the U.S. and staying will be significantly reduced.</p>
<p>“The door is closed,” Li said, adding that the question now is: “How
many people can squeeze in through the cracks?” </p>

id="in-deal-with-us-wikileaks-assange-pleads-guilty-secures-freedom-ends-legal-fight">In
deal with US, WikiLeaks’ Assange pleads guilty, secures freedom, ends
legal fight</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SAIPAN, Northern Mariana Islands — WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange
has pleaded guilty to a single felony charge for publishing U.S.
military secrets in a deal with Justice Department prosecutors that
secures his freedom and concludes a drawn-out legal saga that raised
divisive questions about press freedom and national security. </p>
<p>The plea was entered Wednesday morning in federal court in Saipan,
the capital of the Northern Mariana Islands, a U.S. commonwealth in the
Pacific. He arrived at court shortly before the hearing was to begin and
did not take questions. </p>
<p>Though the deal with prosecutors required him to admit guilt to a
single felony count, it would also permit him to return to his native
Australia without spending any time in an American prison. He had been
jailed in the United Kingdom for the last five years, fighting
extradition to the United States on an Espionage Act indictment that
could have carried a lengthy prison sentence in the event of a
conviction. </p>
<p>The abrupt conclusion enables both sides to claim a degree of
victory, with the Justice Department able to resolve without trial a
case that raised thorny legal issues and that might never have reached a
jury at all given the plodding pace of the extradition process.  </p>
<p>WikiLeaks, the secret-spilling website that Assange founded in 2006,
applauded the announcement of the deal, saying it was grateful for “all
who stood by us, fought for us, and remained utterly committed in the
fight for his freedom.” </p>
<p>The deal, disclosed Monday night in a sparsely detailed Justice
Department letter, represents the latest and presumably final chapter in
a court fight involving the eccentric Australian computer expert who has
been celebrated by supporters as a transparency crusader but lambasted
by national security hawks who insist that his disdain for government
secrecy put lives at risks, and strayed far beyond the bounds of
traditional journalism duties. </p>
<p>The U.S. Justice Department agreed to hold the hearing on the remote
island because Assange opposed coming to the continental U.S. and
because it’s near Australia, where he will return. </p>
<p>The guilty plea resolves a criminal case brought by the Trump
administration Justice Department in connection with the receipt and
publication of war logs and diplomatic cables that detailed U.S.
military wrongdoing in Iraq and Afghanistan. Prosecutors alleged that he
conspired with former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to
obtain the records and published them without regard to American
national security, including by releasing the names of human sources who
provided information to U.S. forces. </p>
<p>But his activities drew an outpouring of support from press freedom
advocates who heralded his role in bringing to light military conduct
that might otherwise have been concealed from view. Among the files
published by WikiLeaks was a video of a 2007 Apache helicopter attack by
American forces in Baghdad that killed 11 people, including two Reuters
journalists. </p>
<p>The indictment was unsealed in 2019, but Assange’s legal woes long
predated the criminal case and continued well past it. </p>
<p>Weeks after the release of the largest document cache in 2010, a
Swedish prosecutor issued an arrest warrant for Assange based on one
woman’s allegation of rape and another’s allegation of molestation.
Assange has long maintained his innocence, and the investigation was
later dropped. </p>
<p>He presented himself in 2012 to the Ecuadorian Embassy in London,
where he claimed asylum on the grounds of political persecution, and
spent the following seven years in self-exile there, hosting a parade of
celebrity visitors and making periodic appearances from the building’s
balcony to address supporters. </p>
<p>In 2019, his hosts revoked his asylum, allowing British police to
arrest him. He remained locked up for the last five years while the
Justice Department sought to extradite him, in a process that
encountered skepticism from British judges who worried about how Assange
would be treated by the American criminal justice system. </p>
<p>Ultimately, though, the resolution sparing Assange prison time in the
U.S. is a repudiation of sorts of years of ominous warnings by Assange
and his supporters that the American criminal justice system would
expose him to unduly harsh treatment, including potentially the death
penalty — something prosecutors never sought.</p>
