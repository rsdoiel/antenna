has developed deep cracks and is badly in need of maintenance.
Postsecondary education is rapidly becoming unaffordable, even at public

I recently was a guest on The Stack Overflow’s Podcast today, talking
about docs (of course), the Vale prose linter, job titles, automation,
LLMs, and much more. You can listen to the entire episode here or
<a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2024/11/26/your-docs-are-your-infrastructure/">in

personal goals this year, and I think these kind of appearances might
help. We need to be where developers are.

all. […] A key tenet of our thinking in this vision is that we want to
drastically reduce the number of explicit concurrency annotations

<p>date: 2024-11-25, from: Advent of Computing</p>
<p data-pm-slice="0 0 []">
The Z4, completed by Konrad Zuse in 1945, is a computer with a wild
story. It was made from scrounged parts, survived years of bombing
raids, moved all around Berlin, and eventually took refuge in basements
and stables. In this episode we will follow the Z4’s early days, and
look at how it fits into the larger picture of Zuse’s work. Along the
way there is looting, rumors, and even… IBM!

I became a Documentation Engineer (and what that even means)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-24, from: Blog by Fabrizio Ferri-Benedetti</p>
<p>
A reader asked me how they’d become a Documentation Engineer, because
they saw I got hired as one and felt curious about what it takes to get
there. This inevitably got me thinking about job titles and the
evolution of tech writing, two topics that are quite central to this
blog. Let me begin with the short answer: As a tech writer you’ll have
to wear many hats, but you’ll always be a technical writer. Depending on
your preferences, some hats will be more comfortable than others. Docs
Engineer is one of those.

<p>date: 2024-11-21, updated: 2024-11-21, from: Tom Kellog blog</p>
<p>A year ago I wrote a post called LLMs Are Interpretable. The gist is
that LLMs were the closest thing to “interpretable machine learning”
that we’ve seen from ML so far. Today, I think it’s fair to say that
LRMs (Large Reasoning Models) are even more interpretable.</p>
