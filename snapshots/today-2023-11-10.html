Big Telco’s fury over FCC plan to infuse telecoms policy with facts (10
Nov 2023)</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-10, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links Big Telco’s fury over FCC plan to infuse telecoms
policy with facts: Dickey Amendments for everything. Hey look at this:
Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2003, 2013, 2018, 2022
Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current
writing projects, current reading Big Telco’s fury over FCC plan to
infuse telecoms policy with facts (permalink) Reality has a distinct
anti-conservative bias, but conservatives have an answer: when the facts
don’t support your policies, just get different facts. Who needs
evidence-based policy when you can have policy-based evidence? Take gun
violence. Conservatives tell us that “an armed society is a polite
society,” which means that the more guns you have, the less gun violence
you’ll experience. To prevent reality from unfairly staining this
pristine ideological mind-palace with facts, conservatives passed the
Dickey Amendment, which had the effect of banning the CDC from gathering
stats on American gun-violence. No stats, no violence!
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dickey_Amendment Policy-based evidence is
at the core of so many cherished conservative beliefs, like the idea
that queer people (and not youth pastors) are responsible for the sexual
abuse of children, or the idea that minimum wages (and not monopolies)
decrease jobs, or the idea that socialized medicine (and not private
equity) leads to death panels:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/26/death-panels/#what-the-heck-is-going-on-with-CMS
The Biden administration features a sizable cohort of effective
regulators, whose job is to gather evidence and then make policy from
it: https://pluralistic.net/2023/10/23/getting-stuff-done/#praxis
Fortunately for conservatives, no every Biden agency is led by
competent, honest brokers – the finance wing of the Dems got to foist
some of their most ghoulish members upon the American people, including
a no-fooling cheerleader for mass foreclosure:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/03/06/personnel-are-policy/#janice-eberly
And these same DINOs reached across the aisle to work with Republicans
to keep some of the most competent, principled agency leaders from being
seated, like the remarkable Gigi Sohn, targeted by a homophobic smear
campaign funded by the telco industry, who feared her presence on the
FCC:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/03/19/culture-war-bullshit-stole-your-broadband/
The telcos are old hands at this stuff. Long before the gun control
debates, Ma Bell had figured out that a monopoly over Americans’
telecoms was a license to print money, and they set to corrupting
agencies from the FCC to the DoJ:
https://pluralistic.net/2021/11/14/jam-to-day/ Reality has a vicious
anti-telco bias. Think of Net Neutrality, the idea that if you pay an
ISP for internet service, they should make a best effort to deliver the
data you request, rather than deliberately slowing down your connection
in the hopes that you’ll seek out data from the company’s preferred
partners, who’ve paid a bribe for “premium delivery.” This shouldn’t
even be up for debate. The idea that your ISP should prioritize its
preferred data over your preferred data is as absurd as the idea that a
taxi-driver should slow down your rides to any pizzeria except Domino’s,
which has paid it for “premium service.” If your cabbie circled the
block twice every time you asked for a ride to Massimo’s Pizza, you’d be
rightly pissed – and the cab company would be fined. Back when Ajit Pai
was Trump’s FCC chairman, he made killing Net Neutrality his top
priority. But regulators aren’t allowed to act without evidence, so Pai
had to seek out as much policy-based evidence as he could. To that end,
Pai allowed millions of obviously fake comments to be entered into the
docket (comments from dead people, one million comments from <span
class="citation" data-cites="pornhub.com">@pornhub.com</span> address,
comments from sitting Senators who disavowed them, etc). Then Pai
actively – and illegally – obstructed the NY Attorney General’s
investigation into the fraud:
https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/06/boogeration/#pais-lies The pursuit of
policy-based evidence is greatly aided by the absence of real evidence.
If you’re gonna fill the docket with made-up nonsense, it helps if
there’s no truthful stuff in there to get in the way. To that end, the
FCC has systematically avoided collecting data on American broadband
delivery, collecting as little objective data as possible:
https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/26/pandemic-profiteers/#flying-blind
This willful ignorance was a huge boon to the telcos, who demanded
billions in fed subsidies for “underserved areas” and then just blew it
on anything they felt like – like the $45 billion of public money they
wasted on obsolete copper wiring for rural “broadband” expansion under
Trump:
https://pluralistic.net/2022/02/27/all-broadband-politics-are-local/
Like other cherished conservative delusions, the unsupportable fantasy
that private industry is better at rolling out broadband is hugely
consequential. Before the pandemic, this meant that America – the
birthplace of the internet – had the slowest, most expensive internet
service of any G8 country. During the lockdown, broadband deserts meant
that millions of poor and rural Americans were cut off from employment,
education, health care and family:
https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/12/ajit-pai/#pai Pai’s response was to
commit another $8 billion in public funds to broadband expansion, but
without any idea of where the broadband deserts were – just handing more
money over to monopoly telcos to spend as they see fit, with zero
accountability:
https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/26/pandemic-profiteers/#flying-blind All
that changed after the 2020 election. Pai was removed from office (and
immediately blocked me on Twitter) (oh, diddums), and his successor,
Biden FCC chair Jessic Rosenworcel, started gathering evidence,
soliciting your broadband complaints:
https://pluralistic.net/2021/03/23/parliament-of-landlords/#fcc And even
better, your broadband speed measurements:
https://pluralistic.net/2021/04/14/for-sale-green-indulgences/#fly-my-pretties
All that evidence spurred Congress to act. In 2021, Congress ordered the
FCC to investigate and punish discrimination in internet service
provision, “based on income level, race, ethnicity, color, religion, or
national origin”:
https://www.congress.gov/117/plaws/publ58/PLAW-117publ58.pdf In other
words, Congress ordered the FCC to crack down on “digital redlining.”
That’s when historic patterns of underinvestment in majority Black
neighborhoods and other underserved communities create broadband
deserts, where internet service is slower and more expensive than
service literally across the street:
https://pluralistic.net/2021/06/10/flicc/#digital-divide FCC Chair
Rosenworcel has published the agency’s plan for fulfilling this
obligation. It’s pretty straightforward: they’re going to collect data
on pricing, speed and other key service factors, and punish companies
that practice discrimination:
https://www.fcc.gov/document/preventing-digital-discrimination-broadband-internet-access
This has provoked howls of protests from the ISP cartel, their lobbying
org, and their Republican pals on the FCC. Writing for Ars Technica, Jon
Brodkin rounds up a selection of these objections:
https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/11/internet-providers-say-the-fcc-should-not-investigate-broadband-prices/
There’s GOP FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr, with a Steve Bannon-seque
condemnation of “the administrative state [taking] effective control of
all Internet services and infrastructure in the US. He’s especially
pissed that the FCC is going to regulate big landlords who force all
their tenants to get slow, expensive from ISPs who offer kickbacks to
landlords:
https://www.fcc.gov/document/carr-opposes-bidens-internet-plan The
response from telco lobbyists NCTA is particularly, nakedly absurd: they
demand that the FCC exempt price from consideration of whether an ISP is
practicing discrimination, calling prices a”non-technical aspect of
broadband service”: https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/110897268295/1 I
mean, sure – it’s easy to prove that an ISP doesn’t discriminate against
customers if you don’t ask how much they charge! “Sure, you live in a
historically underserved neighborhood, but technically we’ll give you a
100mb fiber connection, provided you give us $20m to install it.” This
is a profoundly stupid demand, but that didn’t stop the wireless
lobbying org CTIA from chiming in with the same talking points,
demanding that the FCC drop plans to collect data on “pricing, deposits,
discounts, and data caps,” evaluation of price is unnecessary in the
competitive wireless marketplace”:
https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/1107735021925/1 Individual cartel
members weighed in as well, with AT&amp;T and Verizon threatening to sue
over the rules, joined by yet another lobbying group, USTelecom:
https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/1103655327582/1 The next step in this

<p>
A new report from the Urban Institute finds that hundreds of thousands
of younger veterans are uninsured. One of the solutions it outlines is
expanded Medicaid, which all but 10 states have already done. Plus, the
story of terror portrayed in “Killers of the Flower Moon” takes place in
the 1920s and ’30s. But what happened after? We hear about the Osage
Nation’s developments in government, language preservation and land
acquisition.

<h2 id="kerry-us-and-china-have-some-agreement-on-climate-issues">Kerry:
US and China Have ‘Some Agreement’ on Climate Issues</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. climate envoy John Kerry said talks this week with his Chinese
counterpart resulted in “some agreement” on climate issues that leave
him optimistic about the U.N. climate summit scheduled for later this
month in Dubai. </p>
<p>Speaking at the Bloomberg New Economy Forum in Singapore, Kerry said
Friday that he met for four days this week with Chinese climate envoy
Xie Zhenhua in California. He described their talks as “productive” and,
without providing details, said they had reached “some agreement on
reducing emissions and the direction we have to go.” </p>
<p>Kerry said, “I am hopeful about that,” adding that details of the
agreements would be released soon. </p>
<p>The U.N. Climate Change Conference, known as COP28, is scheduled for
the end of this month. The climate conference seeks to meet and expand
on climate goals established during the Paris agreement of 2015, in
which some 200 nations agreed to limit the rise of global temperatures
to 1.5 degrees Celsius, or about pre-industrial age levels. </p>
<p>Kerry said the goal, as in the previous climate conferences, “is to
open up the opportunity to keep 1.5 degrees alive.” </p>
<p>Any agreements between the United States and China — the world’s two
largest polluters — would be integral to the success of the
conference. </p>
<p>The U.S. climate envoy said the use of fossil fuels — coal in
particular — is likely to be a central part of the discussion at the
conference. China is the world’s largest user of fossil fuels and relies
on coal for most of its energy production. </p>
<p>In comments at the Singapore forum Friday, Kerry said, “It is
irresponsible to be funding or building a coal-fired power plant
anywhere in the world. And who is allowed to get away with doing that,
when it is not the only option for what we could be doing.” </p>
<p>Reuters reports Xie told a diplomatic climate forum in September that
phasing out fossil fuels is “unrealistic” for China. </p>
<p>Some information for this report was provided by Reuters and Agence
France-Presse.</p>

NYT, which I subscribe to, sent me an email today that linked to a
<a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/68861692-nyt-cooking/3543047-easy-weeknight-soups">page</a>
of easy soup recipes. I thought this is nice, I thought their cooking
site was extra money, which I refuse to pay because I think I already
give them far to much money for the value I get. But when I clicked on
one of the pictures I was
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/11/10/nytBaitAndSwitchForAPayingSubscriber.png">told</a>
this is a “subscriber-only recipe.” This, like everything the NYT does,
is incredibly disrespectful and probably unethical, because I was being
conned by an ad, thinking it was journalistic content that I actually
paid for. I used to love the NYT. I grew up reading them along with
everyone else in my family. Now they betray that every chance they get.
Whoever is running the NYT now is running it into the ground as far as
I’m concerned.</p>

From the BBC World Service: Meta, the company that owns Facebook and

advertising products. The move aims at tackling misinformation and
deepfake videos. Then, Diwali — the Hindu festival of lights — takes
place on Sunday. But as people battle higher living costs and air
pollution, will the celebrations be a bit dimmer this year?
Additionally, JKN Group — the Thai owner of the Miss Universe beauty

id="blinken-much-more-needs-to-be-done-to-protect-palestinian-civilians">Blinken:
‘Much More Needs To Be Done’ to Protect Palestinian Civilians</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, “some progress” has been
made toward protecting Palestinian civilians, but that “much more needs
to be done” to minimize casualties and deliver humanitarian assistance
to war-stricken Gaza.</p>
<p>“We have seen progress, we just need to see more of it,” Blinken told
reporters in New Delhi at the end of a nine-day, eight-country tour that
focused in large part on the worsening Middle East conflict.</p>
<p>Israel on Thursday agreed to pause its military operation against
Hamas militants in certain areas of northern Gaza for four hours each
day, according to White House officials.</p>
<p>The pauses are aimed at allowing the flow of more humanitarian aid,
as well as Palestinians who want to flee areas where the Israeli ground
operation and airstrikes are most intense.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Israel also opened a second corridor along Gaza’s coast,
which will allow more Palestinians to flee, White House officials
said.</p>
<p>“What Israel announced yesterday will help,” Blinken said, adding
that the U.S. is also discussing “concrete steps” that would allow more
regular deliveries of humanitarian aid, as well as fuel for vital
facilities, such as hospitals and water treatment plants.</p>
<p>More than 10,000 people, about 40% of them children, have been killed
during Israel’s heavy bombardment of Gaza over the past month, according
to Palestinian officials.</p>
<p>In reality, that figure may be even higher, according to a senior
Biden administration official who delivered testimony to Congress on
Wednesday.</p>
<p>Barbara Leaf, assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs,
told the House Committee on Foreign Relations that it is “very possible”
that the casualty rates are higher than what is being reported. “We will
only know after the guns fall silent,” she said.</p>
<p>Israel’s military says its ground forces have encircled Gaza City, a
Hamas stronghold, as part of an effort to divide the Palestinian
enclave.</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to eradicate
Hamas, the Islamist group that governs Gaza. Hamas militants last month
carried out a bloody surprise attack on Israeli soldiers and civilians
that left over 1,400 people dead.</p>
<p>Netanyahu has said there will be no cease-fire until Hamas releases
the over 200 hostages it is thought to be holding.</p>
<p>Though global calls for a cease-fire have grown louder, U.S.
officials oppose such a move, saying it would allow Hamas to regroup and
eventually carry out more terrorist attacks.</p>
<p>The Mideast crisis has dominated Blinken’s trip, which included stops
in Israel, the West Bank, Jordan, Iraq, Turkey, Japan, and South
Korea.</p>
<p>Asia focus</p>
<p>However, especially in the second half of his trip, the top U.S.
diplomat has attempted to maintain a focus on Asia, which he said is
“the critical region for our future.”</p>
<p>On Friday, Blinken and U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met their
Indian counterparts, Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and
Defense Minister Rajnath Singh, in New Delhi for talks aimed at boosting
defense ties.</p>
<p>“Defense remains one of the most important pillars of our bilateral
relationship,” said Singh at the outset of the so-called “2+2
Dialogue.”</p>
<p>“In spite of various emerging geopolitical challenges, we need to
keep our focus on the important and long-term issues,” he added.</p>
<p>India and the United States, along with Japan and Australia, are a
part of the Quad, a regional security grouping widely seen as a
multilateral attempt to counter China’s rising influence.</p>
<p>India has seen tensions with China rise, especially since a deadly
clash in 2020 along the two countries’ disputed Himalayan border.</p>
<p>But India has maintained close defense and economic ties with Russia
– much to the disappointment of Western countries that have attempted to
economically and diplomatically isolate Russia following Moscow’s
invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>Tensions also spiked in September after Canada, a close U.S. ally,
alleged Indian involvement in the killing of Canadian citizen Hardeep
Singh Nijjar, a Sikh separatist.</p>
<p>India has furiously denied the allegations. But U.S. officials want
India to cooperate with Canada on an investigation into the killing.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters after meeting Indian officials Friday, Blinken
said India and Canada are “two of our closest friends and partners and
of course we want to see them resolving any differences or
disputes.”</p>

id="korean-war-veteran-96-still-trying-to-get-purple-heart-medal-after-7-decades">Korean
War Veteran, 96, Still Trying to Get Purple Heart Medal after 7
Decades</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Earl Meyer remembers in vivid detail when his platoon came under
heavy fire during the Korean War – he still has shrapnel embedded in his
thigh.</p>
<p>But over 70 years later, the 96-year-old is still waiting for the
U.S. Army to recognize his injury and to award him a Purple Heart medal,
which honors service members wounded or killed in combat.</p>
<p>Meyer has provided the Army with documents to back up his assertion
that he was wounded in combat in June 1951. Doctors at the Department of
Veterans Affairs agreed that his account of the shrapnel coming from a
mortar attack was probably true. But few men in his unit who would have
witnessed the battle have survived, and he thinks the medic who treated
him on the battlefield was killed before he could file the
paperwork.</p>
<p>An Army review board in April issued what it called a final rejection
of Meyer’s request for a Purple Heart, citing insufficient
documentation. His case highlights how it can be a struggle for wounded
veterans to get medals they’ve earned when the fog of war, the absence
of records and the passage of time make it challenging to produce
proof.</p>
<p>“At first I didn’t know that I had been wounded,” Meyer wrote in a
sworn statement that was part of his rejected appeal. “But as my unit
advanced from where the mortar rounds were hitting, I noticed that my
pants were sticking to my leg. I reached down to correct this and
discovered that my hand was covered in blood.”</p>
<p>Meyer took the rare step of suing the Department of Defense and the
Army in September. The Army’s Office of Public Affairs said it doesn’t
comment on ongoing litigation. But after The Associated Press made
requests for comment on Meyer’s case, the office of the Army’s top
noncommissioned officer, Sgt. Maj. of the Army Michael Weimer, said that
it’s going to take another look.</p>
<p>“The Sergeant Major of the Army’s Office is engaging with Mr. Meyer’s
family and looking into the situation,” spokesperson Master Sgt. Daniel
Wallace said. “Either way, we’re proud of Mr. Meyer’s service to our
country.”</p>
<p>Meyer said in an interview that he wouldn’t have pursued the Purple
Heart because his injuries were relatively minor compared to those of
many men he served with, but his three daughters persuaded him. Growing
up, they knew that he had been injured in the war, but like many
veterans, he never talked much about it. It’s only been in the past
decade or so that he’s opened up to them, which led them to urge his
pursuit of a Purple Heart.</p>
<p>“I think it will provide closure for him. I really do,” said his
daughter, Sandy Baker, of New Buffalo, Michigan.</p>
<p>Tony Cross, a disability claims and appeals specialist with the
American Legion, the country’s largest veterans’ service organization,
said the Legion doesn’t commonly see cases like Meyer’s of medals
denied, though it did see one earlier this year. The process is
challenging because each military branch has its own approval process
and it gets more challenging after a veteran leaves the military, he
said.</p>
<p>Meyer’s main obstacle has been the lack of paperwork. He told the AP
the medic who bandaged his leg told him he would file the forms to show
he was wounded in combat. But he never did. Meyer thinks the medic may
have been killed in action. Only a few members of his platoon made it
out unharmed.</p>
<p>At the time, Meyer wasn’t hurt badly enough to leave the battlefield.
But Army medical records show he injured his back a few days later when
he fell down a hill while carrying a machine gun, and then aggravated it
again days later while lifting ammunition. He was evacuated to a MASH
unit, then a hospital ship. The records show his treatment included a
tetanus shot, apparently for the shrapnel injury.</p>
<p>“I still had the hole in my pants and the blood on it,” he said about
the time he was hospitalized for his back. He said he still had the
patch on his leg. “I should have told them at that time.”</p>
<p>But he wasn’t thinking then about gathering paperwork for a future
medal. His mind was on survival.</p>
<p>“I was just glad to get out of there,” he said.</p>
<p>Accidental back injuries generally don’t qualify a service member for
a Purple Heart, but wounds from enemy shrapnel can.</p>
<p>Meyer finished out his tour guarding prisoners of war. He was
honorably discharged in 1952. His decorations included the Combat
Infantryman Badge, which is reserved for those who actively participate
in ground combat under enemy fire. He also received the Congressional
Gold Medal for his service in the Merchant Marine in World War II.</p>
<p>He still has coffee with fellow veterans a couple mornings a week at
the St. Peter American Legion post. He said his leg isn’t acutely sore,
but it still aches. VA doctors told him they didn’t want to risk surgery
to remove the shrapnel because it was too close to his sciatic
nerve.</p>
<p>In 2005, doctors at the VA Medical Center in Minneapolis agreed that
his leg injury probably happened in combat. “The scar in the left thigh
is at least as likely as not (50/50 probability) caused by or a result
of a combat fragment wound,” they wrote in one report. “Reasonable doubt
has been resolved in your favor,” they wrote in another.</p>
<p>Meyer first applied for a Purple Heart in 2020. The Army denied him,
saying he needed more documentation.</p>
<p>So U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar’s staff then helped him get documents from
the National Archives and made numerous follow-up inquiries. But even
with the additional evidence, the Army Board for Correction of Military
Records turned him down. Klobuchar said this week that she’s not giving
up.</p>
<p>“Earl Meyer put his life on the line in defense of our freedoms, and
we will continue to do all we can to further the work to rightfully
honor his service,” the Minnesota Democrat said in a statement.</p>
<p>In its most recent rejection letter, the board said he must have
“substantiating evidence to verify that he was injured, the wound was
the result of hostile action, the wound must have required treatment by
medical personnel and the medical treatment must have been made a matter
of official record.”</p>
<p>The board conceded that “some evidence available for review indicates
a possible injury,” but that “based on the preponderance of the evidence
available for review, the Board determined the evidence presented
insufficient to warrant a recommendation for relief.”</p>
<p>Meyer’s attorney, Alan Anderson, wrote in the the lawsuit that review
boards have awarded Purple Hearts under similar circumstances —
sometimes under court order. He said the board noted the problems of
relying solely on medical records when it approved a Purple Heart in a
separate 2015 case.</p>
<p>“Under wartime conditions, wounds requiring medical treatment by a
medical officer will not always receive such treatment, and, even if a
soldier requiring such treatment receives it, there will be cases where
the treatment is not made a matter of official record,” the board said
in that case. “In such cases, other sources, including credible
statements from colleagues, may be useful in establishing the
circumstances in which a soldier was wounded.”</p>

id="clashes-over-israel-hamas-war-unnerve-students-at-us-colleges">Clashes
Over Israel-Hamas War Unnerve Students at US Colleges</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>As a Jewish student, Eden Roth, always has felt safe and welcome at
Tulane University, where more than 40% of the students are Jewish. That
has been tested by the aftermath of last month’s invasion of Israel by
Hamas.</p>
<p>Graffiti appeared on the New Orleans campus with the message “from
the river to the sea,” a rallying cry for pro-Palestinian activists.
Then came a clash between dueling demonstrations, where a melee led to
three arrests and left a Jewish student with a broken nose.</p>
<p>“I think that the shift of experience with Jews on campus was
extremely shocking,” said Roth, who was in Israel last summer for a
study-abroad program. “A lot of students come to Tulane because of the
Jewish population — feeling like they’re supported, like a majority
rather than a minority. And I think that’s definitely shifted.”</p>
<p>Tulane isn’t alone. On other campuses, long-simmering tensions are
erupting in violence and shattering the sense of safety that makes
colleges hubs of free discourse. Students on both sides are witnessing
acts of hate, leaving many fearing for their safety even as they walk to
classrooms.</p>
<p>Threats and clashes have sometimes come from within, including at
Cornell, where a student is accused of posting online threats against
Jewish students. A University of Massachusetts student was arrested
after allegedly punching a Jewish student and spitting on an Israeli
flag at a demonstration. At Stanford, an Arab Muslim student was hit by
a car in a case being investigated as a hate crime.</p>
<p>The unease is felt acutely at Tulane, where 43% of students are
Jewish, the highest percentage among colleges that are not explicitly
Jewish.</p>
<p>“To see it on Tulane’s campus is definitely scary,” said Jacob Starr,
a Jewish student from Massachusetts.</p>
<p>Within the student Jewish community, there is a range of perspectives
on the conflict. The latest war began with an attack on Oct. 7 by Hamas
militants who targeted towns, farming communities and a music festival
near the Gaza border, killing more than 1,400 people. Israel has
responded with weeks of attacks in Gaza, which have killed more than
10,000 people.</p>
<p>Emma Sackheim, a Jewish student from Los Angeles who attends Tulane’s
law school, said she grew up as a supporter of the Jewish state but now
considers herself an opponent of Zionism. Sackheim says she knows
students who oppose Israel’s policies “but don’t feel comfortable to
publicly say anything.”</p>
<p>“I was standing on the Palestinian side,” she said when asked about
the Oct. 26 demonstration, which took place along a public New Orleans
street that runs through campus.</p>
<p>Still, she said Tulane is where she feels most comfortable as a Jew.
“I know that I have so many options of community,” she said.</p>
<p>On campuses around the U.S., students on both sides say they have
been subjected to taunts and rhetoric that oppose their very existence
since the invasion and the subsequent Israeli assault on Hamas in
northern Gaza.</p>
<p>They see it in campus rallies, on anonymous message boards frequented
by college students, and on graffiti scrawled on dorms and buildings. In
one case under police investigation as a possible hate crime, “Free
Palestine” was found written this week on a window of Boston
University’s Hillel center.</p>
<p>Colleges have been scrambling to restore a sense of security for
Jewish and Arab students — and stressing messages of inclusion for
diverse student bodies. But untangling what’s protected as political
speech and what crosses into threatening language can be daunting
task.</p>
<p>Tulane’s president, Michael Fitts, has described an increased police
presence and other security measures on campus. In messages to the
campus community, he has lamented the loss of innocent Israeli and
Palestinian lives and said the university was reaching out to Jewish and
Muslim student groups and religious organizations.</p>
<p>He has faced criticism from people on both sides seeking more
forceful statements.</p>
<p>Islam Elrabieey, for example, seeks condemnation of Israel’s
actions.</p>
<p>“To condemn Hamas is a good thing,” said Elrabieey, a native of Egypt
and a visiting scholar in Tulane’s Middle East and North African Studies
program. “But at the same time, if you didn’t condemn Israel for
committing war crimes, this is a double standard.”</p>
<p>As places that encourage intellectual debate, it isn’t surprising
that colleges have seen heated conflict, said Jonathan Fansmith, a
senior vice president for the American Council on Education, an
association of university presidents. But when different factions
disagree about what crosses the line between free speech and abuse, it
puts colleges in a difficult place, he said.</p>
<p>“Everyone should be incredibly sympathetic to Jewish students who
feel under threat, and the alarming rise in antisemitic actions is
something college universities take very seriously,” Fansmith said. “But
they have a requirement, a responsibility under the law as well, to
balance the free speech rights of people who may disagree, who may have
critiques that they find disagreeable or dislike. And finding that line
is very, very difficult.”</p>
<p>After facing criticism for trying to remain too neutral on the war,
Harvard University’s president on Thursday condemned the phrase “from
the river to the sea,” saying it has historical meanings that imply to
many the eradication of Jews from Israel. Pro-Palestinian activists
around the world chanted the phrase in the aftermath of the Hamas
raid.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Roth said that some Tulane Jewish students have been
rattled enough to make them think twice about visiting the Mintz Center,
the headquarters for the Tulane Hillel organization.</p>
<p>“I don’t feel completely safe, but I feel like we have no other
choice but to embrace who we are in these times,” Roth said in an
interview at the building. “I know a lot of my friends are nervous to
wear their Star of David necklaces, to wear a kippah or even come into
this building. But I think it’s critical that we do not let fear consume
us.”</p>
<p>Lea Jackson, a freshman from New Jersey who describes herself as a
modern Orthodox Jew, said she is concerned that supporters of a
Palestinian state are nervous expressing their views because of the
large numbers of Jewish students on campus.</p>
<p>The Hamas raid may have made some people more reluctant to speak even
as others become more outspoken, said Jackson, who said she recently
spent a “gap year” in Israel and has friends and family there.</p>
<p>“But it’s a lot harder to have a civil conversation,” Jackson said,
“when emotions and tension are so high and so many people are so
personally connected to this.”</p>

id="police-investigate-fentanyl-filled-envelopes-sent-to-us-election-offices">Police
Investigate Fentanyl-Filled Envelopes Sent to US Election Offices</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Authorities were hunting Thursday for whoever sent suspicious letters
— including some containing fentanyl — to elections offices in at least
five states this week, delaying the counting of ballots in some local
races in the latest instance of threats faced by election workers around
the country.</p>
<p>The letters were sent to elections offices in the presidential
battlegrounds of Georgia and Nevada, as well as California, Oregon and
Washington, with some being intercepted before they arrived. Four of the
letters contained fentanyl, the FBI and U.S. Postal Inspection Service
reported in a statement to elections officials Thursday.</p>
<p>“Law enforcement is working diligently to intercept any additional
letters before they are delivered,” the statement said.</p>
<p>The Pierce County auditor’s office in Tacoma, Washington, released
images of the letter it received, showing it had been postmarked in
Portland, Oregon, and read in part, “End elections now.”</p>
<p>In Seattle, King County Elections Director Julie Wise said that
letter appeared to be the same one her office got. She said it was very
similar to one King County received during the August primary, which
also contained fentanyl.</p>
<p>Authorities in Georgia suspect that election offices in Fulton
County, which includes Atlanta and is the largest voting jurisdiction in
one of the nation’s most important presidential swing states, was a
likely target. They were working to intercept any letters. In the
meantime, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said officials were
sending the overdose-reversal drug naloxone to the office as a
precaution.</p>
<p>“This is domestic terrorism, and it needs to be condemned by anyone
that holds elected office and anyone that wants to hold elective office
anywhere in America,” said Raffensperger, a Republican.</p>
<p>It was not immediately clear how authorities came to suspect that a
letter might have been sent to Georgia’s biggest election office.
Raffensperger said the state alerted all 159 of its counties of the
possible threat Wednesday but believes only Fulton County is being
targeted.</p>
<p>In California, the United States Postal Service intercepted two
suspicious envelopes that were headed to election facilities in Los
Angeles and Sacramento.</p>
<p>Authorities in Lane County, Oregon, which includes the University of
Oregon, were investigating a piece of mail that arrived at the local
election office Wednesday. No one who came in contact with it had
experienced any negative health effects, said Devon Ashbridge,
spokesperson for the Lane County Elections Office in Eugene.</p>
<p>The incident prompted officials to close the office and delayed an
afternoon pickup of ballots. Ashbridge declined to provide further
details.</p>
<p>“Someone attempted to terrorize our elections staff, and that’s not
OK,” Ashbridge said.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, authorities in Washington state said four county
election offices had to be evacuated as election workers were processing
ballots cast in Tuesday’s election, delaying vote-counting.</p>
<p>Election offices in King, Skagit, Spokane and Pierce counties
received envelopes containing powders. Local law enforcement officials
said the substances in King and Spokane counties field-tested positive
for fentanyl. In at least one other case, the substance was baking
soda.</p>
<p>Pierce County Auditor Linda Farmer released images of the envelope
and letter her office received. The letter contained a warning about the
vulnerability of “ballot drops” and read: “End elections now. Stop
giving power to the right that they don’t have. We are in charge now and
there is no more need for them.”</p>
<p>The letter featured an antifascist symbol, a progress pride flag and
a pentagram. While the symbols have sometimes been associated with
leftist politics, they also have been used by conservative figures to
label and stereotype the left, and the sender’s political leanings were
unclear.</p>
<p>Elections offices in two Washington counties — King and Okanogan —
also received suspicious envelopes while processing ballots during the
August primary, and the letter sent to King County tested positive for
traces of fentanyl. Those letters remain under investigation by the U.S.
Postal Inspection Service and FBI.</p>
<p>Washington Secretary of State Steve Hobbs called the incidents in his
state “acts of terrorism to threaten our elections.”</p>
<p>White House spokesperson Olivia Dalton said the Biden administration
was aware of the investigation: “We are grateful for the election and
poll workers who served this week to ensure the security of our
democratic processes.”</p>
<p>Fentanyl, an opioid that can be 50 times as powerful as the same
amount of heroin, is driving an overdose crisis deadlier than any the
U.S. has ever seen as it is pressed into pills or mixed into other
drugs. Briefly touching fentanyl cannot cause an overdose, and
researchers have found that the risk of fatal overdose from accidental
exposure is low.</p>

<h2 id="gaza-war-complicates-bidens-meeting-with-indonesias-widodo">Gaza
War Complicates Biden’s Meeting with Indonesia’s Widodo</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>What had been expected to be a workmanlike meeting Monday between
U.S. President Joe Biden and his Indonesian counterpart, Joko Widodo,
has become more sensitive in light of widespread Muslim anger over
Israel’s devastating anti-terror campaign in Gaza.</p>
<p>During Widodo’s official visit, the U.S. is expected to upgrade
diplomatic ties with a key Indo-Pacific partner that has been advancing
toward China’s sphere of influence. The two leaders are expected to
elevate bilateral ties to a “Comprehensive Strategic Partnership,”
putting Washington on par with Beijing.</p>
<p>However, the presidents are far apart in their responses to the
Israel-Hamas war, with Biden offering staunch support to Israel in its
response to Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack into Israel, while Widodo has called
the humanitarian situation in Gaza “unacceptable.”</p>
<p>Biden understands “there are strong feelings” but “will continue to
make it clear the U.S. stands with Israel,” National Security Council
coordinator for strategic communications John Kirby told VOA during a
briefing Thursday.</p>
<p>Biden will also make it clear that the United States will do
everything it can to provide humanitarian aid and safe passage for the
Palestinian people and will not back down from “the real promise of a
two-state solution.”</p>
<p>Gregory Poling, director of the Southeast Asia Program at the Center
for Strategic and International Studies, said he expects the two
presidents to tread carefully on the emotion-laden issue, particularly
on calls for an indefinite cease-fire.</p>
<p>“Anything Jokowi [Joko Widodo] says that’s too critical of Israel or
too supportive of Hamas will damage relations with the U.S and the West.
And anything he says that is not sufficiently critical of Israel will
damage him at home,” Poling said.</p>
<p>Indonesian support for Palestinian cause</p>
<p>The Palestinian cause heavily influences political views in Indonesia
based on its anti-colonial tradition and demographics. About 229 million
Muslims — 13% of the world’s total — live here, where they constitute
87% of the population.</p>
<p>Just as no presidential candidate can win in the U.S. without
pledging support for Israel, the opposite is the case in Indonesia.</p>
<p>“Not a single Indonesian president has dared not to defend
Palestine,” said Siti Mutiah Setiawati, a lecturer of Middle East
studies at Indonesia’s Gadjah Mada University. “Our founding fathers
have laid the foundation of our foreign policy — nonaligned, free and
active. Defend the oppressed,” she said.</p>
<p>As civilian casualties mount in Gaza, several Indonesian cities have
erupted in protest over U.S. support of Israel. Prominent Islamic
parties have often sought to capitalize on the Palestinian issue, and
with a presidential election next year, the ruling Indonesian Democratic
Party of Struggle is wary of Widodo appearing too soft on the war in
Gaza.</p>
<p>Just a day before his White House visit, Widodo is scheduled to
attend a summit of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, hosted by
Saudi Arabia in Riyadh, where the agenda calls for a discussion of “the
brutal Israeli aggression against the Palestinian people.”</p>
<p>But policy experts warn that any friction over the Israel-Hamas war
could jeopardize progress on a long list of common interests, including
a deal on nickel and China’s rising ambitions in the Indo-Pacific.</p>
<p>“The incentive here is to avoid any sort of public airing of
differences over the Israel-Gaza conflict,” said Lucas Myers, senior
associate for Southeast Asia at the Wilson Center’s Asia Program.</p>
<p>Critical minerals deal</p>
<p>Jakarta has been pushing for a limited free trade agreement similar
to one the U.S. signed with Japan in March that will allow Indonesian
nickel exports to be covered by the 2022 U.S. Inflation Reduction
Act.</p>
<p>The IRA is Biden’s signature climate change and clean energy
legislation that provides tens of billions of dollars in tax credits to
spur domestic electric vehicle manufacturing and sales.</p>
<p>American consumers can qualify for a $7,500 tax credit to purchase an
EV if 50% of its battery components were produced in North America and
if 40% of the critical minerals used for the vehicle was extracted,
processed and/or recycled domestically or in a country that has a free
trade agreement with Washington.</p>
<p>EV manufacturing requires various critical minerals, including
nickel, of which Indonesia has the world’s largest reserves by far. When
Widodo met Vice President Kamala Harris in Jakarta in September, he
asked the U.S. to begin talks on a limited free trade deal for critical
minerals.</p>
<p>Negotiations have not formally begun, but according to the White
House, Biden and Widodo will “explore opportunities to enhance
cooperation on the clean energy transition.”</p>
<p>Challenges lie ahead since Indonesia’s mining and refining industry
is dependent on Chinese investment and besieged by labor and
environmental concerns. In October, a bipartisan group of U.S. senators
sent a letter to the Biden administration urging it to include these
concerns in its consideration of any expanded access for critical
minerals.</p>
<p>While Jakarta wants a bilateral deal like the U.S.-Japan Critical
Minerals Agreement, Washington is also exploring a critical minerals
scheme under its 2022 Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity,
signed by 13 countries including Indonesia. The IPEF does not grant
market access to its signees but offers trade facilitation.</p>
<p>Poling said some sort of critical minerals announcement will likely
come out of Monday’s meeting.</p>
<p>“There will also probably be a multilateral critical minerals
announcement around APEC, like this will be part of IPEF,” he said.</p>
<p>Polling was referring to the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit
that the U.S. will be hosting next week in San Francisco that Widodo
will attend. Whether Indonesia gets both – the kickoff of bilateral
talks on critical minerals and a multilateral framework – remains to be
seen, he added.</p>
<p>China</p>
<p>With its large population, fast-growing trillion-dollar economy and
abundant resources, Indonesia plays a key role in the geopolitical
battle for influence in Asia between Washington and Beijing.</p>
<p>Under Widodo, who cannot run for a third term but is aiming to cement
his legacy as a champion of infrastructure projects, Indonesia came
second only to Pakistan in terms of value of Belt and Road Initiative
projects — $20.3 billion and 71 operating projects in 2021.</p>
<p>However, like other major Southeast Asian countries, Indonesia is
tilting its military relations toward Washington as China increasingly
asserts its claim to disputed waters in the South China Sea.</p>
<p>In August, the Indonesian and U.S. militaries conducted the Super
Garuda Shield exercises, expanding their annual drills to involve more
than 4,000 service members with 19 nations either participating or
observing. It was one of the largest multinational exercises in the
Indo-Pacific region.</p>
<p>Monday’s visit by Widodo was arranged after Biden sent Harris to the
ASEAN summit hosted by Indonesia in September, and he went to Hanoi.</p>

<h2 id="blinken-in-india-for-talks-on-china-israel">Blinken in India for
Talks on China, Israel</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is in New Delhi on Friday for
talks seeking to bolster India as a regional counterweight to China and
win backing for the U.S. position on Israel’s war with Hamas. </p>
<p>Blinken and U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin will join Foreign
Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and Defense Minister Rajnath Singh for
annual “two-plus-two” talks that India has said will focus on “defense
and security cooperation.” </p>
<p>India is part of the Quad alliance alongside the United States,
Australia and Japan, a grouping that positions itself as a bulwark
against China’s growing assertiveness in the Asia-Pacific region. </p>
<p>Washington hopes a tighter defense relationship will help wean India
off Russia, New Delhi’s primary military supplier. </p>
<p>“Our intention is to encourage more collaboration to produce
world-class defense equipment to meet Indian defense needs and
contribute to greater global security,” Donald Lu, the top U.S. diplomat
for South and Central Asia, said ahead of the trip. </p>
<p>Blinken arrived in New Delhi late Thursday from South Korea, the
latest leg of a marathon trip that has included a G7 foreign ministers
meeting in Japan, which sought to find common ground on the Gaza
conflict, and a whirlwind tour of the Middle East. </p>
<p>India was swift to condemn Hamas and shares with Washington a
long-standing call for an independent Palestinian state. </p>
<p>“The Indian government was direct in its condemnation of the Hamas
terrorist attack and has also joined a chorus of nations, including the
United States, that have called for sustained humanitarian access to
Gaza,” Lu said. </p>
<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he stood “in solidarity with
Israel,” and last month India airlifted aid to Egypt for Palestinian
civilians from the besieged Gaza Strip. </p>
<p>The conflict in Gaza poses a major challenge to hopes of a key trade
and transport route linking Europe, the Middle East and India, unveiled
during G20 talks in India in September. </p>
<p>India has a long-running border dispute with northern neighbor China,
with a deadly Himalayan clash in 2020 sending diplomatic relations into
a deep freeze. Their 3,500-kilometer shared frontier remains a
long-running source of tension. </p>
<p>Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will also be on the agenda, Lu
said. </p>
<p>New Delhi has had to balance its traditional alliance with Russia,
the provider of most of its arms imports and now a source of cut-price
oil, with growing ties to Washington. </p>
<p>President Joe Biden’s administration has prioritized relations with
New Delhi, seeing a like-minded partner faced with the rise of China,
but Blinken’s trip could be made awkward by a bitter feud between India
and another close U.S. partner, Canada. </p>
<p>Relations between the two have plunged since Prime Minister Justin
Trudeau in September publicly linked Indian intelligence to the killing
of a Canadian citizen, Hardeep Singh Nijjar, allegations India has
called absurd. </p>
<p>Nijjar, who advocated for a separate Sikh state carved out of India,
was wanted by Indian authorities for alleged terrorism and conspiracy to
commit murder.</p>

<h2 id="questions-over-gazas-postwar-future-remain-unanswered">Questions
Over Gaza’s Postwar Future Remain Unanswered</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>As Israel Defense Forces commanders claim that Hamas fighters have
lost control of the north of the Gaza strip — and its troops enter the
center of Gaza City — a central question remains unanswered: What will
happen to the devastated Palestinian territory after the war between
Israel and Hamas militants is over?</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told ABC News this week
that Israel would maintain “security responsibility” for Gaza for an
indefinite period, “because we’ve seen what happens when we don’t have
that security responsibility.”</p>
<p>However, questioned on those comments, U.S. Secretary of State Antony
Blinken said Wednesday that Washington would not support any
reoccupation of Gaza, some 18 years after Israel withdrew its forces and
settlers from the narrow strip of land in 2005. While the territory is
home to 2.3 million Palestinians, Israel controls access by land, sea
and air, and the United Nations considers the Gaza strip as occupied
territory.</p>
<p>G7 meeting</p>
<p>More than 1,400 Israeli soldiers and civilians were killed in the
cross-border attack by Hamas militants on October 7, and more than 200
people were taken hostage.</p>
<p>Israel’s aerial bombing and ground attacks on Hamas targets since
then have killed more than 10,000 people in the Gaza strip, including
several thousand women and children, according to Hamas-run health
authorities.</p>
<p>The apparent lack of any post-conflict plan for Gaza overshadowed a
two-day meeting of foreign ministers from the G7 group of wealthy
nations in Tokyo, which wrapped up Wednesday.</p>
<p>The group — comprising the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom,
Canada, France, Italy and Germany — issued a joint statement following
the meeting, only the second such joint communique since the October 7
Hamas attack on Israel.</p>
<p>“G7 members have agreed to unequivocally condemn the terrorist attack
by Hamas and others and, secondly, to seek the immediate release of
hostages. Thirdly, we have agreed that it’s necessary to take urgent
action to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza,” Japanese Foreign
Minister Yoko Kamikawa told reporters following the meeting
Wednesday.</p>
<p>She added that G7 foreign ministers had called for “pauses” in the
fighting “to allow undisrupted humanitarian assistance including food,
water, medical care, fuel, shelter and access for those involved in
humanitarian aid access [to Gaza].”</p>
<p>Postwar plan</p>
<p>Israel, its Western backers and other regional powers — including the
Palestinians — must formulate a postwar plan for Gaza, said Yossi
Mekelberg of Chatham House, a London-based policy institute.</p>
<p>“What happens if Hamas disappears as a political and military power?
Who is sucked into this vacuum? It might be even worse than Hamas. I
think we move into an interim period. And I think it’s really important,
I really think there should be a regional element to this,” he told
VOA.</p>
<p>While the U.S.-Israeli alliance remains strong, there are
disagreements between Washington and Tel Aviv, Mekelberg said.</p>
<p>“From early on, the United States understood that on the one hand,
giving Israel all the support it needs, including allocating more than
$14 billion, sending weapons, munitions and its navy to the eastern
Mediterranean, is one thing. But they don’t trust Netanyahu. They don’t
trust the current government. And they know that giving too much of a
blank check can be dangerous,” he said.</p>
<p>Global protests</p>
<p>The G7 did not call for a more permanent cease-fire. Across the
world, there have been protests calling for an end to the war. There is
a danger that the conflict exacerbates global divisions, according to
Mekelberg.</p>
<p>“It’s very tricky. Because the G7 obviously represent the more
affluent part of the world — and the one that much of the resentment is
directed at — of neglecting and taking an approach which protects their
interests but not the rest of the world’s interests. I, for one, find it
difficult to feel sorry for their predicament, because the neglect of
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was criminal. I’ve no other word.
Because for years there were some of us that warned that this was
unsustainable, it will implode one way or another. And they did
nothing,” Mekelberg said.</p>
<p>Israeli security</p>
<p>Arriving in Saudi Arabia for talks on the conflict Thursday,
Britain’s Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said Israel’s military
operation to defeat Hamas was a necessary response.</p>
<p>“Calling for a cease-fire is understandable. But what we also
recognize is that Israel is taking action to secure its own stability
and its own security,” Cleverly told Reuters.</p>
<p>“The Israeli military are currently in Gaza. And we have said that
any security responsibility that they take on because of the military
operation in Gaza needs to be temporary, and needs to exist only as long
as we’re able to move towards a Palestinian leadership — a Palestinian
leadership that we want to see committed to peace, committed to the
two-state solution,” he added.</p>
<p>Ukraine distraction</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ukraine has warned that the conflict between Israel and
Hamas is distracting Kyiv’s Western allies from its war with invading
Russian forces.</p>
<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke with G7 foreign
ministers in Tokyo via video link.</p>
<p>The G7 host, Japan’s Kamikawa, said Ukraine had the group’s full
support. “We as the G7 stand with Ukraine even while the international
attention tends to be on the Middle East,” Kamikawa said Wednesday.</p>

<h2 id="joe-manchin-was-americas-de-facto-climate-king">Joe Manchin Was
America’s De Facto Climate King</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-10, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDQzOTA2MC9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcyNTI1NTk2Mn0.yXCYNDQUu5PdSEsBBNrj-Q1xNVTj10M93spvUoN84gU/image.png?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps" style>
What can you say about Joe Manchin, perhaps the most important — and
most complicated — American climate policy maker of the past decade?
</p>
<p>
Let’s start here: Soon, he won’t be a senator any more. On Thursday,
Manchin announced that he will not pursue re-election in West Virginia
in 2024.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve made one of the toughest decisions of my life and decided that I
will not be running for re-election to the United States Senate,” he
said
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-xiBEy8GTg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in
a video message</a>. Instead, he said, he will be “traveling the country
and speaking out to see if there is an interest in creating a movement
to mobilize the middle and bring Americans together.”
</p>
<p>
We don’t have many details about what “mobilizing the middle” might look
like; Manchin was recently said
<a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2023/09/23/joe-manchin-texas-tribune-festival/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to
be considering</a> a third-party presidential run. If he did make a go
for the White House, that would seemingly have disastrous consequences
for Joe Biden’s re-election effort — and, in all likelihood, for climate
action generally — because it could probably hand the 2024 race to
Donald Trump.
</p>
<p>
But pending that possibility, Manchin’s decision immediately reframes
several aspects of next year’s elections.
</p>
<p>
It means, first, that West Virginia Governor and
<a href="https://www.npr.org/2016/10/07/496696292/billionaire-gubernatorial-candidate-owes-15-million-in-taxes-and-fines" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">serial
coal-mine-safety violator</a> Jim Justice will likely win Manchin’s
seat, marking the end of a tectonic political realignment that saw the
state go from solidly Democratic to solidly Republican.
</p>
<p>
Without West Virginia, Democrats’
<a href="https://www.270towin.com/2024-senate-election/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">path
to a Senate majority</a> now looks more like a tightrope: It requires
Democrats to hold difficult seats in Ohio, Montana, Pennsylvania, and
Arizona. Then the party needs to win in <em>one additional state</em>.
But the pickings are slim. Are Texas or Florida really going to elect a
Democrat to the Senate? Is Mississippi, Missouri, or Nebraska?
</p>
<p>
Manchin’s decision will, in other words, have big implications for what
Democrats can and cannot do in government. Without a working Senate
majority, Democrats will struggle to pass laws or appoint justices to
the Supreme Court even if they control the House of Representatives and
the White House.
</p>
<p>
But, of course, Manchin’s decision is even more profound because who he
is — his anxieties, whims, and cognitive biases — has long had an
outsized influence on legislation. Setting aside presidents and a few
jurists, there may not be a recent Democratic policymaker whose personal
views more closely shaped the law.
</p>
<p>
Manchin wielded power, above all, because he represented West Virginia,
the most conservative state to send a Democrat to the Senate. That meant
he was his caucus’s obvious marginal member and swing vote.
</p>
<p>
And you could tell. What other Democrat could get away with
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/27/climate/manchin-coal-climate-conflicts.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">owning
a coal plant</a> while ostensibly overseeing the coal industry? (Manchin
is the chairman of the Senate energy and natural resources committee.)
What other Democrat could demand
<a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/3/6/22316811/federal-unemployment-insurance-joe-manchin-compromise-300-week" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">last-minute
changes</a> to an economic recovery package?
</p>
<p>
Manchin’s crowning legacy will be the Inflation Reduction Act, which is
often described as “President Biden’s signature climate bill,” but which
is smudged with Manchin’s fingerprints, too. As chairman of the Senate
energy committee, Manchin had a good deal of <em>de jure</em> authority
over the law; as the Senate’s swing vote, he had even more <em>de facto
</em>power. The final bill text was hammered out in negotiations between
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s team — who were essentially
negotiating on behalf of the rest of the caucus — and Manchin’s team.
</p>
<p>
You can see it in the law’s final policies.
</p>
<p>
Some of the Inflation Reduction Act’s most generous subsidies will go to
the nascent clean hydrogen industry, which Manchin has long nurtured. If
hydrogen becomes
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/green-hydrogen-tax-credit-treasury" target="_self">an
anti-environmental boondoggle</a> on par with
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/us-corn-based-ethanol-worse-climate-than-gasoline-study-finds-2022-02-14/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ethanol</a>,
then Manchin will bear a good deal of the blame; if it
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/bidens-grand-energy-plan-is-finally-getting-real" target="_self">decarbonizes
the American industrial sector</a>, he should get some credit.
</p>
<p>
Likewise, Manchin is why the bill’s
<a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/ev-tax-credit-new-2023" target="_self">tax
credits for electric vehicles</a> do not incentivize
<a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/ev-tax-credit-new-2023" target="_self">union
membership</a>.
</p>
<p>
He is behind the law’s peculiar rules about exactly which industries and
organizations can claim their subsidies as direct cash payments. He also
shaped the design of its carbon-capture tax credits.
</p>
<p>
If there is something distinctive in the IRA, the odds are good that
Manchin either insisted on it, approved it, or didn’t notice it.
</p>
<p>
But Manchin drove other climate and energy policy too. He
<a href="https://www.energy.senate.gov/2020/12/murkowski-manchin-house-colleagues-reach-agreement-on-energy-package-for-year-end-appropriations-bill#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThis%20all%2Dof%2Dthe,buildings%20and%20addressing%20climate%20change." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cowrote
the bipartisan Energy Act of 2020</a> with Senator Lisa Murkowski of
Alaska. That law focused the federal government’s industrial policy on
carbon management, clean hydrogen, and critical minerals — some of the
same topics that would dominate the IRA. It also
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/lpo/articles/getting-know-lpo-energy-act-2020-bil-implementation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">expanded
the powers</a> of the Loan Programs Office, the Department of Energy’s
in-house bank.
</p>
<p>
He criticized
<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/05/11/manchin-epa-new-rules-biden-00096320" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the
Environmental Protection Agency</a> and sometimes voted to overturn its
rules. He consistently opposed carbon taxes or pricing carbon in any
way, all but ensuring the idea’s
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/07/obituary-carbon-tax-beloved-climate-policy-dies-47/619507/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">political
death</a> in the short-term. Even his Senate career more or less began
with him taking aim — literally — at Obama’s climate bill. During his
first race for Senate in 2010, Manchin
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/oct/12/democrat-obama-climate-change-agenda" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ran
a TV ad</a> in which he shot a rifle at a stack of papers labeled “cap
and trade bill” and promised to take on then-President Barack Obama’s
proposal.
</p>
<p>
In short, if you thought about climate policy over the past decade, you
wound up thinking quite a lot about the likes, dislikes, and
peculiarities of Joe Manchin. What he might support or oppose mapped the
frontier of political possibility in the United States. He was, in
short, potentially the most influential force in shaping American
climate policy during the 2010s. (Only
<a href="https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/about/leadership/mary-d-nichols" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mary
Nichols</a>, who has been California’s chief air-pollution regulator
since 2007, might match his importance.)
</p>
<p style>
My first thought is that Manchin may soon join that list of capricious
ex-senators — Joe Lieberman and Ben Nelson come to mind — whose names,
once synonymous with power itself, become the answer to bad trivia
questions. But I have been thinking about Joe Manchin, 76, for a long
time, and I expect to find it a hard habit to break. He is an ambitious,
eccentric, and preternaturally lucky man. I suspect his next few
decisions will prove even more important than those that have come
before.

begins Polaris and Vega GPU retirement process, reduces ongoing driver

<p>date: 2023-11-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>As AMD is now well into their third generation of RDNA architecture
GPUs, the sun has been slowly setting on AMD’s remaining Graphics Core
Next (GCN) designs, better known by the architecture names of Polaris
and Vega. In recent weeks the company dropped support for those GPU
architectures in their open source Vulkan Linux driver, AMDVLK, and now
we have confirmation that the company is slowly winding down support for
these architectures in their Windows drivers as well. Under AMD’s
extended driver support schedule for Polaris and Vega, the drivers for
these architectures will no longer be kept at feature parity with the
RDNA architectures. And while AMD will continue to support Polaris and
Vega for some time to come, that support is being reduced to security
updates and “functionality updates as available.” What’s odd is that AMD
is still selling these as integrated GPUs to this day, and they, too,
are getting this treatment. That’s a pretty shitty deal for people
buying these products today.</p>

<p>Amazon has been working on a new operating system to replace Android

as job listings and other materials referencing these efforts.
Development of the new operating system, which is internally known as
Vega, appears fairly advanced . The system has already been tested on
Fire TV streaming adapters, and Amazon has told select partners about
its plans to transition to a new application framework in the near
future. A source with knowledge of the company’s plans suggested that it
could start shipping Vega on select Fire TV devices as early as next
year. Is it a Linux distribution? Amazon’s new operating system is also
based on a flavor of Linux, and is using a more web-forward application
model. App developers are being told to use React Native as an
application framework, which allows them to build native apps with
Javascript-powered interfaces. Of course it’s a Linux distribution.</p>

id="voters-resistance-to-abortion-restrictions-clouds-republicans-future-in-2024">Voters’
Resistance to Abortion Restrictions Clouds Republicans’ Future in
2024</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>In what may be a preview of the 2024 general election, Democrats on
Tuesday surged to surprising victories in a number of states across the
United States, in large part by highlighting their resistance to
Republican efforts to pass strict abortion bans.</p>
<p>More than a year after the U.S. Supreme Court reversed a
constitutional right to receive abortion care, experts say the issue is
likely to remain salient with voters into next year. This offers some
hope to the many Democrats publicly fretting about their chances in
2024.</p>
<p>The party’s leader, President Joe Biden, is suffering from low
approval ratings as well as a widespread perception that his age — he
would be 82 at the beginning of a second term — may make him less
effective in office.</p>
<p>Republicans are not helped by the fact that they do not speak with
one voice on the subject. A presidential primary debate on Wednesday
featured one candidate calling for a federal law limiting abortion,
while another argued that the party should recognize that passing such a
proposal is a practical impossibility.</p>
<p>Changing laws</p>
<p>In June 2022, the Supreme Court ruled that Roe v. Wade, a nearly
50-year-old decision that guaranteed women access to abortion in all 50
states, was wrongly decided, and declared that the legality of abortion
should be decided at the state level.</p>
<p>That case, Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health, set off a flurry of
legislative activity across the country, as states began considering new
laws on abortion, or reviving old laws that had been rendered moot by
the Roe decision in 1973. In many states where Republicans control the
legislature, strict abortion bans were quickly put into place.</p>
<p>As a result, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive
health research organization, 58% of women in the U.S. between the ages
of 13 and 44 now live in states with laws that are “hostile or extremely
hostile to abortion rights.”</p>
<p>Backlash</p>
<p>Evidence of a backlash began to appear quickly. Prior to the Dobbs
decision, Democrats had been expected to fare poorly in the 2022
congressional elections. However, that November, a wave of anger at the
new abortion restrictions helped limit Republican gains.</p>
<p>Hoping they would sweep to a large majority in the House of
Representatives, the Republicans instead eked out only a tiny one. In
the Senate, Democrats managed to retain control — an outcome that was
far from guaranteed just a few months earlier.</p>
<p>In the following months, Democrats scored a series of unexpected
victories in special elections and abortion-related ballot referendums
across the country, foreshadowing the results of Tuesday’s off-year
elections in multiple states.</p>
<p>Tuesday’s results</p>
<p>In Ohio, a Republican-run state legislature had passed a strict ban
on abortions after the sixth week of pregnancy — before many women even
know they are pregnant. On Tuesday, voters overwhelmingly approved 
adding the right to an abortion to the state’s constitution.</p>
<p>In Virginia, popular Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin campaigned
hard for his party’s candidates for the state’s General Assembly,
promising that if voters gave the Republicans full control of the state
government, he would institute a 15-week limit on the right to an
abortion.</p>
<p>Going into the election, Democrats had a majority in the state
Senate, while Republicans held a majority in the House of Delegates. In
an apparent rebuke to Youngkin, voters gave Democrats control of both
houses of the legislature.</p>
<p>In Kentucky, typically a Republican stronghold, Democratic Governor
Andy Beshear won reelection handily, despite a concerted effort by
Republican political action groups to unseat him. His campaign credited
the victory, in part, to the distinction he drew between himself and his
opponent, who favors strict curbs on abortion.</p>
<p>New challenge for Republicans</p>
<p>Tuesday’s election results highlight a core challenge facing
Republican candidates in a post-Dobbs world, said Jeremy Mayer, an
associate professor at the Schar School of Policy and Government at
George Mason University in Virginia.</p>
<p>“The Republican base, the people that vote and choose candidates, is
very pro-life,” Mayer told VOA. “So, in order to win the nomination for
governor or for state legislature or for national Senate, often
Republicans have to be incredibly pro-life.”</p>
<p>Supporters and opponents of abortion rights have long used the terms
“pro-choice” and “pro-life” to describe their competing positions.</p>
<p>In the past, with Roe v. Wade guaranteeing the right to an abortion,
a Republican candidates could be as vocally anti-abortion as they liked.
They did not risk losing the votes of Republicans who support abortion
access, because the procedure was understood to be protected. Now,
however, voters have to take candidates’ anti-abortion-rights stances
more seriously.</p>
<p>“Once the Supreme Court opened up the gates to banning abortion,
Republicans needed to come up with smart messaging, and they haven’t
figured it out yet,” Mayer said.</p>
<p>Sarah Parshall Perry, a senior legal fellow in the Edwin Meese III
Center for Legal and Judicial Studies at the Heritage Foundation, a
conservative think tank, agreed.</p>
<p>“I’m hoping this will be a wake-up call,” Perry told VOA. “The GOP
and pro-lifers have got to get their messaging in order.”</p>
<p>She said the Republicans need to do a better job dissecting the
language in ballot measures, such as the one that recently passed in
Ohio, and pointing out their implications. For instance, she said, the
Ohio referendum results could eliminate requirements that a minor’s
parents receive notification if their child seeks an abortion.</p>
<p>“There needs to be a little bit of cohesion going forward, because we
know we’re going to see this in other states,” Perry said. “In fact,
Arizona is getting ready to put a ballot initiative on their election
forms for next year. They’re now having discussions in Florida and in
Missouri — deep-red states — because the Democratic abortion lobby is
energized after some of its recent wins.”</p>
<p>Democrats confident</p>
<p>Democratic activists, for their part, seem confident that Republicans
will continue to struggle to reframe the abortion issue ahead of the
2024 election.</p>
<p>“The reason why we can take this into the national 2024 election is
because the everyday American has been so impacted by the Dobbs
decision,” said Sabrina Talukder, director of the Women’s Initiative at
the Center for American Progress.</p>
<p>“Particularly in the maternal mortality crisis that we’re facing in
the country, it’s not a hard point to drive home,” Talukder told VOA.
“Abortion wins. The American people want access to abortion. They want
to codify it in their state statutes, and they want elected officials
who believe in abortion access, who believe in abortion care as health
care.”</p>
<p>Republican contenders</p>
<p>In a debate Wednesday among five of the Republicans vying for the
party’s presidential nomination next year, the challenge in coming to a
shared Republican position on abortion was on full display.</p>
<p>“I’m 100% pro-life,” said Senator Tim Scott. “I would certainly, as
president of the United States, have a 15-week national limit.”</p>
<p>“I think you have to be honest with the American people,” said former
South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley. “When it comes to the federal law,
which is what is being debated here, be honest. It’s going to take 60
Senate votes, a majority of the House and a president to sign it.</p>
<p>“We haven’t had 60 Senate votes in over a hundred years. … So, no
Republican president can ban abortions any more than a Democrat
president can ban these state laws.”</p>
<p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis conceded that the GOP is losing its own
voters on issues like the ballot measure passed in Ohio on Tuesday,
saying, “A lot of the people who are voting for the referenda are
Republicans who would vote for a Republican candidate.”</p>
<p>In his own state, DeSantis signed a strict abortion law banning most
instances of the procedure after six weeks.</p>
<p>Former President Donald Trump, the front-runner for the Republican
nomination, was not present at the debate. His policy on abortion has
shifted over the years, but it was his nomination, during his first
term, of three Supreme Court justices known to favor overturning Roe
that led to the Dobbs decision.</p>

id="republican-contenders-lay-out-foreign-policy-views-in-third-debate">Republican
Contenders Lay Out Foreign Policy Views in Third Debate</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The five Republicans vying to snatch their party’s presidential
nomination from former President Donald Trump sparred Wednesday night
during a foreign policy-heavy debate in which they echoed some of
President Joe Biden’s support for Israel while debating how to counter
China and manage the relationship with Iran.</p>
<p>They also took a significantly harder line than the Biden
administration on how to handle the flow of migrants seeking to enter
the U.S. through the border with Mexico.</p>
<p>But on Ukraine, the candidates differed with one another and with the
White House, with biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy saying he was
“absolutely unpersuaded” by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s
appeals for support — going so far as to appear to call the Jewish head
of state a Nazi, and a “comedian in cargo pants.”</p>
<p>Here’s a look at how the group — which also included Florida Governor
Ron DeSantis, former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, South Carolina Senator
Tim Scott and former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie — differs from
the Biden administration, from independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy
Jr. and from Trump.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Calls for Israel to ‘finish the job’ with Hamas</p>
<p>The candidates largely echoed one another with tough talk about
Hamas, with DeSantis saying he would urge Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu to “finish the job” in his quest to eradicate the
U.S.-designated terrorist group after its October 7 attack killed more
than 1,400 people.</p>
<p>Haley, Ramaswamy and Scott used similarly strong language in
supporting Israel’s offensive, as did Christie, who said Netanyahu “must
go in and make sure that Hamas can never do this again.”</p>
<p>This support for Israel aligns with that of the White House, though
Biden has been careful to moderate his language on the actions of the
Israel Defense Forces, with administration officials repeatedly
stressing that Israel, as a democracy, is beholden to laws governing
warfare.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Biden reiterated his support for Israel, telling
reporters that there was “no possibility” of an indefinite cease-fire,
although his administration welcomed Israel’s announcement that there
will be daily four-hour humanitarian pauses.</p>
<p>In an interview with VOA, spokesperson Nathan Tek explained the U.S.
position: “What a cease-fire means, in effect, is that Israel would
cease firing, but that Hamas, of course, would be allowed to regroup,
reattack and freeze the battle as it is.”</p>
<p>Kennedy, so far, appears to support the White House, saying in early
October, “I applaud the strong statements of support from the Biden
White House for Israel in her hour of need.” </p>
<p>On Israel, Trump has given mixed and sometimes contradictory
messages. Shortly after the Hamas attack, Trump said he would “fully
support” Israel over Hamas, but he also drew criticism for criticizing
Netanyahu.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Absolutely unpersuaded’ on Ukraine</p>
<p>Ramaswamy stood alone in his strong, unsubstantiated criticism of
Ukraine, its leader and its democratic bona fides. That prompted Haley
to reply that the presidents of Russia and China “are salivating at the
thought that someone like that could become president.”</p>
<p>The others took a cautiously supportive line on Ukraine — with Haley
calling Putin a “thug” and saying, “I don’t think we should give them
cash; I think we should give them equipment to win,” reflecting the
Republican Party’s concerns about accountability over the billions of
dollars’ worth of aid and military supplies Biden has sent to help the
nation stave off Russia’s invasion.</p>
<p>“The last time that we turned our back on a shooting war in Europe,”
Christie said, “it bought us just a couple of years. And then 500,000
Americans were killed in Europe to defeat Hitler. This is not a choice.
This is the price we pay for being leaders of the free world.”</p>
<p>DeSantis and Scott were more ambiguous, both pivoting to talk of
threats from waves of irregular migration at the U.S.-Mexico border. In
line with the mainstream Republican platform, all candidates on stage
Wednesday advocated stronger controls to stop migration along that
border. </p>
<p>“We are not going to send your sons and daughters to Ukraine,”
DeSantis said. “I am going to send troops to our southern border.” </p>
<p>Kennedy, for his part, says he “will find a diplomatic solution that
brings peace to Ukraine and brings our resources back where they belong.
We will offer to withdraw our troops and nuclear-capable missiles from
Russia’s borders.”</p>
<p>Trump’s position on Ukraine is complicated. Zelenskyy recently said
the former president turned down his invitation to visit Ukraine, citing
an unspecified “conflict of interest” with the Biden administration.</p>
<p>Biden has repeatedly said he will support Ukraine “as long as it
takes” and is asking Congress to push through $61 billion in
supplemental funding for Ukraine.</p>
<p>Tek told VOA that support for Ukraine is “something that we’ve made a
commitment to, and that we will continue to fulfill that
commitment.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Iran: ‘You cannot negotiate with evil’</p>
<p>Both Scott and Haley swung hard at Tehran, accusing it of supporting
malign groups — something the Biden administration also often says,
though administration officials have been careful to say they have yet
to find evidence that Tehran directly supported Hamas’ October 7
attack.</p>
<p>“There would be no Hamas without Iran,” Haley said.</p>
<p>“My foreign policy is simple,” Scott said. “You cannot negotiate with
evil, you have to destroy it.”</p>
<p>Haley, who had sparred with Scott over other issues in this debate
and the two previous ones, most closely aligned with that view, saying:
“You punch them once and you punch them hard, and they will back
off.”</p>
<p>DeSantis’ language was more vague, but he criticized Biden’s decision
to pursue the now-moribund deal aimed at preventing Iran from having
nuclear weapons — a deal that would have seen Washington strike
compromises with Tehran.</p>
<p>Responding to the Republican debate, Kennedy said on the X platform
Wednesday night: “These guys seem to be in full agreement that we should
escalate this war and bomb Iran. Seriously? Is that what we want? Am I
missing something? Enough of these warmongers. Let’s bring that money
back home.”</p>
<p>In an editorial he wrote earlier this month, Trump accused Biden of
being too soft on Iran.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>New ‘Axis of Evil’?</p>
<p>So is China in the Axis of Evil now? Haley and Christie appeared to
think so, echoing a pronouncement earlier this month from Senate
Minority Leader Mitch McConnell that lumped it in the infamous grouping
that includes Iran and Russia.</p>
<p>Haley said her administration would “end all formal trade relations
with China until they stop murdering Americans from fentanyl.” She also
endorsed unambiguous support for arming and training Taiwan’s forces
against a Chinese invasion.</p>
<p>Ramaswamy described China as “our top enemy” — but noted an
inconvenient fact.</p>
<p>“Here’s why we can’t get tough with China,” he said. “It’s because we
depend on them for our modern way of life. And we have to declare
economic independence from our enemy.”</p>
<p>Trump holds more than 100 trademarks in China, according to ethics
paperwork he recently filed, though while president he imposed tariffs
on China that the Biden administration has yet to change.</p>
<p>Talk of, of all things, Tik Tok led to perhaps the weirdest, least
diplomatic moment of the night. Christie and DeSantis slammed the
platform and called for it to be banned or sold.</p>
<p>Haley agreed, which provoked a broadside from Ramaswamy, who uses the
platform to campaign.</p>
<p>He pointed out that Haley’s 25-year-old daughter uses the popular
platform, prompting her to reply, “You’re just scum.”</p>
<p>Biden’s position on China is neatly described by his famous phrase
“competition, not conflict” and circumscribed by careful, measured
language. But the relationship has grown frosty this year, with a number
of crucial issues at stake, including semiconductor production,
military-to-military communication, the status of Taiwan, China’s
increased military and economic ambitions, and more.</p>
<p>Biden and President Xi Jinping are both expected in San Francisco
next week for a summit of Asian economies. VOA asked the White House
this week if it could confirm that Biden has firmed up his heavily
hinted-at plans to meet with Xi — and if so, what the two leaders plan
to discuss.</p>
<p>“No,” said John Kirby, director of strategic communications for the
National Security Council. “And no.”</p>

I’m Piper Haywood, and I’m a design-adjacent software engineer based in
Brooklyn. I came to my profession in a roundabout way, studied fine art
at a liberal arts school in central Maine and took one CS course that I
really liked. I had to make my own portfolio site in order to apply for
a postgrad in fine art at
<a href="https://www.arts.ac.uk/colleges/central-saint-martins" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Central
Saint Martins</a>, which led to building other people’s sites, and it
sort of snowballed from there.
</p>
<p>
I met my husband
<a href="https://sambaldwin.info" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Sam
Baldwin</a> when I was studying briefly at
<a href="https://www.gsa.ac.uk" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Glasgow
School of Art</a>, and then we re-met when I was in London for CSM. We
ended up running a studio together for six years which was such a
fundamental part of my growth as an engineer and professional. But it
eventually came time to either really push it, to consider hiring people
and that sort of thing, or to fold it and go our separate ways
professionally. We decided on the latter, and though we’re still working
on some fun stuff together, we’re enjoying working on larger, separate
teams at the moment.
</p>
<p>
I just finished up a stint at
<a href="https://www.superhi.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">SuperHi</a>
where I managed the engineers and worked on the next iteration of the
platform, and am now looking for new contracting or FTE opportunities.
In the meantime, I’m really enjoying poking around with a few side
projects including a really exciting one I’m working on with Sam (!),
and a whole ton of blog maintenance I’ve been itching to complete. In my
free time, I’m usually chasing my toddler around all of the playgrounds
in a three mile radius, cooking, recording memories on my blog, or
singing in groups (previously with Musarc in London, now with the
Brooklyn Conservatory Chorale).
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>What's the story behind your blog?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
My blog started in 2014 when Sam and I decided to make a
<a href="https://www.tumblr.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Tumblr</a>
theme that we felt should exist. We needed some test content to work
with, so I started keeping track of thoughts and things. That theme
project took a back seat, but I found I enjoyed recording things so I
just kept going.
</p>
<p>
I eventually felt a bit penned-in by Tumblr and migrated it over to
WordPress. I’ve been tempted to move it off WordPress here and there, I
particularly love the ergonomics of a lightweight
<a href="https://www.11ty.dev" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Eleventy</a>
setup. But as a writer, I rely on so many WordPress features that it
would be silly to move, really. Also, I know of enough people that use
my theme for their own sites that I’d like to keep supporting it by
dogfooding it, if I can.
</p>
<p>
When I first started my blog, I kept it on a subdomain and didn’t really
share it much. It helped keeping it less visible, it’s less pressure. I
did eventually move it on to my main domain. Looking back through the
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230000000000*/https://piperhaywood.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Wayback
Machine</a>, it’s interesting looking at the old versions of my
homepage. It doesn’t really feel like “me” until it’s a blog.
</p>
<p>
My first priority when I started messing around with the design of my
blog, and something that remains a priority for me, is deemphasizing the
title when appropriate. I think this might be something that I loved
from Tumblr, though I didn’t love everything about how they implemented
it. The thing is, a lot of stuff that I want to note or record just
doesn’t <em>need</em> an obvious title. In fact, an obvious title would
make it something other than what it is, something more official or
something. If every short little thing I wanted to note required a super
visible title, I don’t think I’d ever publish much of anything.
</p>
<p>
Besides that, I guess you might say that I have a bit of a propensity
for white space. Some people might call it “minimal”, though I didn’t
really purposefully seek out that vibe. Initially, I experimented with
varying opacities for the tags.
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161225105347/http://blog.piperhaywood.com/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">See
an example in the Wayback Machine</a>. So the darker the tag background,
the more content associated with it. I liked the effect, but it was
almost impossible to do it and keep it appropriately accessible. I fell
out of love with writing on my blog for a bit around late 2017, but got
back in to the swing of things by revisiting the design and making the
blog my entire site in early 2018.
</p>
<p>
For the new design, I moved towards something more colorful. I was
interested in having the color reflect the time of year, so I added a
bar down the left-hand side that changed hue depending upon how far
through the year the post was added.
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180531060331/https://piperhaywood.com/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">See
this example in the Wayback Machine</a>. It’s sort of hard to get a feel
for the color change in that bar since those posts are relatively close
together, but you can get a better picture of it if you
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190410213935/https://piperhaywood.com/browse/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">look
at the Browse page</a>. I liked that it made the passage of time, the
distance between posts, more obvious. Like that lull in 2017 becomes
marked. As well as introducing the color, I started using monospace for
all of the text. I wanted to move away from the prior typeface since,
though lovely, it just felt a little precious to me. And I used it the
same everywhere, always the same weight and size. IIRC it was somewhat
inspired by this fantastic community cookbook that my grandma had, where
it had clearly been typeset on a typewriter. But it was also a result of
myself being extremely unfamiliar with good typography, so it just felt
easier to use spacing to differentiate things. I did get frequent
reminders that the hierarchy wasn’t great though, lol. In early 2019, I
dropped the left color bar and instead gave the dates a color background
so that you could differentiate the posts more easily when scrolling
(<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190119070257/https://piperhaywood.com/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">see
example</a>). That was a useful suggestion from Sam.
</p>
<p>
Around the start of the pandemic, my friend Bec Worth and I got talking
about my blog and how she found it similar to a commonplace book. I
hadn’t encountered that idea before, but it immediately struck me as
appropriate once I started reading up about it. She was interested in
using my WordPress theme to keep track of her own thoughts, so we
collaborated on a new theme that would be more appropriate for both of
us and hopefully for others and inspired by the concept of a commonplace
book for the web. (By the way, I would share her blog but I don’t really
know if she wants it to be public TBH!) We ended up using a serif for
the main body copy partly because we just like reading serif text. Also
IIRC, it’s sort of a “screw you” to an old boss of Bec’s who said that
using a serif, any serif, for some project she was working on would be
too “girly”. The idea that an entire typeface category would be
gendered, I mean come on! So the serif stuck.
</p>
<p>
We have further ideas for the theme. Like introducing other views
(thumbnails, list, etc.) that you can set as default on a tag-by-tag
basis. But life has gotten in the way for both of us, we both have had
babies since we started looking at the theme together. I’m hoping to
finally introduce some of the new features soon though. On a technical
level, I’d like to make much wider use of CSS variables so that the
theme is much more easily child-theme-able, for those that want to use
it but would want to set up their own typographic system.
</p>
<p>
Oh and one other thing: analytics. I had Google Analytics on my site for
a while, mostly because I found it interesting which posts people
identified most with. I then moved to Matomo because I wanted to avoid
sharing data unnecessarily. But when numbers started to climb up, I
started to get more self-conscious about posting anything. And that’s
the opposite of the point for me, it’s nice if I can pretend that no one
reads it. So I got rid of analytics entirely in September 2020 and
haven’t looked back.
</p>
<p>
I’m coming up on the 10th anniversary of my blog next year and have been
tempted to do some sort of print-on-demand thing to get a hard-copy
version of the entire thing, including all of the private posts that I
keep for myself. But the index is such an important part of my blog, to
me. And I’d want to get that right in a printed version, which would be
tricky. I’m thinking of commissioning another engineer for it actually,
if anyone knows of someone that would be interested and/or a good fit,
let me know!
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>What does your creative process look like when it comes to
blogging?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
Oh gosh… it’s not a very formal process! I do have a folder in Apple
Notes of things I think are interesting or want to remember, those are
usually dashed off in a spare minute for revisiting later. Then when I
have a second (which feels rare at the moment!), I’ll draft something up
in WordPress. Some things languish in drafts forever. Other things get
published privately (especially a lot of stuff relating to my son). And
other things get a proper public post. I don’t spend a lot of time
re-writing or editing things. That’s partly because most of my posts are
fairly short, they don’t really warrant that sort of time.
</p>
<p>
Longer things like
<a href="https://piperhaywood.com/rietveld-stool/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">this
post about making a Rietveld-esque crate stool or table</a> take days
and days. Sometimes I’ll publish it as a password-protected page first
so that I can run it past other people for their opinion before making
it live. But super long-format stuff is really the exception, not the
norm.
</p>
<p>
I don’t have any objections to editing after the fact, though if it’s a
major edit, I do try to note it somewhere on the post. And I don’t have
any objections to back-dating content. Sometimes I don’t get round to
writing about something until a little while after it happens, but the
chronology is important to me.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe
the physical space influences your creativity?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I’m not sure… I do believe that physical space influences creativity,
quite a bit in many cases. And I don’t really listen to music or
anything when I’m writing, I get too distracted by the music. The only
exceptions to this are wordless albums that I know inside and out, like
Vivaldi’s Four Seasons recomposed by Max Richter.
</p>
<p>
My biggest hurdle right now is time, and giving my blog the priority
that it probably deserves. I went from working independently to working
in house for the first time back in early 2022 and my publishing took a
bit of a hit at that point. It’s interesting, what is the balance?
Writing on my site is really part of my practice both as an engineer and
as a human being, since it is so essential to my learning and memory.
But if I were to publish something “on the clock”, I felt like it could
be perceived as me not doing my job properly. Which honestly, would
probably never have been a problem at the company I was at. But I
imagine some other managers might look at it that way! It’s tricky. At
the moment I theoretically have all the time in the world to write, but
I struggle to prioritize it since I feel like I should be doing other
things, like reaching out to hiring managers, or finishing the side
project that Sam and I are working on. I don’t know, it’s just a tricky
line to toe when you have a dependent and simply have less time to play
with.
</p>
<p>
So because of that time crunch, I honestly end up writing and publishing
from all over the place and on all sorts of devices.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your
tech stack?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I’ve covered a bit about the CMS above (started on Tumblr, moved to
WordPress, am curious about other options but WordPress is just too good
a fit for me).
</p>
<p>
In terms of the hosting, I was with
<a href="https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">NearlyFreeSpeech</a>
for years and years until just a few weeks ago. I was doing a lot less
with my site because I was behind on some server admin I needed to do on
NFSN, and that made me realize that I just don’t have <em>time</em> for
the server admin anymore. It’s something I used to enjoy, but it’s not
the reason I have my blog. So I moved to
<a href="https://getflywheel.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Flywheel</a>
on the suggestion of a lovely internet acquaintance and have been
extremely impressed with them so far, especially with their support as
I’ve tried to get my site set up on Mastodon.
</p>
<p>
The domain registration is actually owned by Sam! LOL, I need to get
that moved to my own account.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would
you do anything differently?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I don’t think so? Honestly I think I lucked out in a lot of ways. I
lucked out with the whole “keep it private for a while” thing, it wasn’t
deliberate but allowed me a lot of flexibility in reflection. And
starting with Tumblr allowed me to start small, while WordPress has
allowed me to make use of a heck of a lot of great blog-specific
functionality.
</p>
<p>
I think I would have moved to managed WordPress hosting sooner, it has
just reduced a lot of stress.
</p>
<p>
I would have kept child theming in mind from the get go when creating my
current theme, since the idea of revising it for better child theming is
a little daunting.
</p>
<p>
And I would never have bothered with analytics. I can see how it’s
useful for some people who have a different purpose for their blog
maybe, but it usually just introduced stress for me.
</p>
<p>
And I think I would have started my blog earlier. I didn’t realize just
how useful it would be until a little while down the road, but my
goodness, it is so great having a little slice of the web to yourself.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Financial question since the web is obsessed with money: how
much does it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost or does it
generate some revenue? And what's your position on people monetising
personal blogs?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I have <em>zero</em> problem with people monetizing their personal
blogs, go wild! Whatever you’ve got to do.
</p>
<p>
For myself, I haven’t been tempted because it hasn’t cost me very much
historically. I think it was less than $1.50 per month at
NearlyFreeSpeech, and the domain registration was around $13 yearly.
</p>
<p>
It definitely costs me more now with managed hosting, but I don’t have
to spend as much time maintaining it so it seems worth it. I’m on the
Starter plan with Flywheel which is around $30/ mo. If I have to bump up
a level… I might consider monetizing in some way. But I don’t know, it
just changes the priorities a bit. I’ll have to weight it up if/when the
time comes.
</p>
<p>
I do financially support a few other bloggers, but only via Substack at
the moment. I would LOVE to both learn more about the web monetization
API and support people through it though. If anyone wants to talk about
this, please hit me up!
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth
checking out? And also, who do you think I should be interviewing
next?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
For sure!

</ul>
<p>
Any of those people would be great interviewees, would love to know more
about their relationships to their blogs.
</p>
<p>
And honestly I’m sure there are others… But my RSS reader is such a mess
at the moment, it’s hard for me to find the ppl I most enjoy following.
Yet another thing I need to tidy up!
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Final question: is there anything you want to share with
us?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I guess maybe just watch
<a href="https://piperhaywood.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">this
space</a>? I’m really excited about the project Sam and I are working on
but am wary of sharing more just yet since it’s still in its infancy.
But I’ll share on my site as soon as we can.
</p>
<p>
And since I’m no longer at SuperHi, I’m looking for opportunities to
contribute to a like-minded team either as a contractor or in FTE. If
you know of anything that might be a good fit, give me a buzz. There’s
more about me and what I’m looking for on my site of course, but feel
free to reach out to chat if you’d like to hear it from the horse’s
mouth. I love talking to people.
</p>
<p>
Oh and maybe one final thing. My good friend
<a href="https://gemmacope.land" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Gemma
Copeland</a> introduced me to Ursula K. Le Guin’s essay
“<a href="https://otherfutures.nl/uploads/documents/le-guin-the-carrier-bag-theory-of-fiction.pdf" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">The
Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction</a>” ages ago, and hardly a week goes by
that I don’t refer to or mention it. It feels like an antidote, a salve,
for some of the crappiest mindsets that consistently underpin the less
savory things happening in the world. I’m so thankful that Gem
introduced me to it, and though I feel like some sort of Evangelist with
how often I mention it, I do feel like it’s essential reading for anyone
living through the past two decades. You can read it in her excellent
collection <em>Dancing at the Edge of the World</em>, or
<a href="https://ignota.org/products/the-carrier-bag-theory-of-fiction#:~:text=In%20The%20Carrier%20Bag%20Theory,than%20a%20weapon%20of%20domination." rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">get
it from Ignota Books</a> in a lovely, slim, pocket-sized edition of just
that essay.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for the opportunity to answer your questions (and for persevering
with my extremely tardy reply!). It was fun reflecting. ♥️

<p>date: 2023-11-09, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p class="drop-caps" style>
When Manjula Martin was growing up in Northern California in the 1980s,
wildfires weren’t something she thought about much. She knew about
disaster — the magnitude 6.9 Loma Prieta earthquake of 1989, which
killed 63 people and injured thousands, hit when she was a teenager —
but fire, she thought, was just something that happened up in the
mountains in the summer.
</p>
<p>
Things are different now. In 2017, Martin left the high prices of San
Francisco for the redwoods of Sonoma County. The night of their
housewarming party, a firestorm swept through Santa Rosa and Sonoma and
Napa counties. The next year — 5 years ago this week — the Camp Fire,
the deadliest and most destructive fire in the state’s history,
destroyed the town of Paradise and killed 85 people.
</p>
<p style>
In her new book,
<a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/711111/the-last-fire-season-by-manjula-martin/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>The
Last Fire Season</em></a> (out on January 16 next year), Martin writes
about the fires that swept through California in 2020, weaving her
personal story with that of fire in California writ large. It’s a
beautiful book, and I called her up to talk about her relationship with
fire and how we can learn to live with the changing world. Our
conversation has been edited for length and clarity.
</p>
<p>
<strong>The book opens in 2020, which was a year of multiple fire
complexes. Was that the first time fire made itself known in the
immediate vicinity of your home?</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong></strong>No, it wasn’t. But it was the first time that I
realized that it wasn’t an anomaly.
</p>
<p>
We had horrible fires near my area in 2017. In 2018, the Camp Fire
happened in Northern California, which was like a four-hour drive away,
but the smoke from that fire lingered in the Bay Area for weeks. And
then in 2019, the Kincade fire was a huge fire up here in Sonoma, and
the entire west of the county was evacuated in basically the course of a
night, including ourselves.
</p>
<p>
Then in 2020, the Lightning Complex fires happened in late August, which
is what the book starts with. And that was the moment where I personally
was like, “oh, this is going to keep happening.”
</p>
<p>
Before that a natural disaster to me felt like a thing that happened
once and then that’s it, right? It wasn’t connected to larger things for
me. But the fact is that the new wildfires that we’re having are bigger
and hotter and far more destructive than the previous wildfires we’ve
had, and 2020, which is probably far too late, was the year that I
personally put that all together under the name of climate change. It
wasn’t the first year I knew about fire, but it was the moment I
realized that I was going to be living with fire for the rest of my
life.
</p>
<p>
<strong>I was struck by your description of the 2020 fires and the ways
that COVID complicated your experience of them. It reminded me of the
concept of cascading events; it was striking to read about how your go
bag was filled with these N95 masks that were there for the sake of the
fires, but also, of course, turned out to have utility for this other
thing that you’re dealing with at the same time.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong></strong>That was one of the reasons why I chose to center the
book around 2020. I think that was a moment where it became clear for a
lot of people that disasters don’t take their turn. When it was
happening, I felt it was a historic moment.
</p>
<p>
<strong>You named your book <em>The Last Fire Season. </em>But, of
course, it wasn’t the last.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong></strong>Unfortunately not. The book began as an essay, and
since I was writing it in 2021 I thought I was writing about the last
fire season I had experienced. But then I realized that it was actually
a really great title for a book. It’s pretty commonly acknowledged now
that in the North American West, fire season isn’t really a thing
anymore. Now fire authorities talk about having a fire year.
</p>
<p>
That is directly linked to the changing of the weather and the climate.
But for me, the deeper meaning of it is this idea that fire being
seasonal also sort of implies that it’s temporary, and that it’s going
to go away. But really it’s not seasonal, it’s part of this land. And
we’re going to be living with it forever.
</p>
<p>
<strong>There’s a point in your book where you write that the California
ecosystem was fire-adapted, but also that fire is changing. What do you
mean by that?</strong>
</p>
<p>
Since time immemorial, California’s ecosystems — from oak woodlands to
redwood forests to grasslands and chaparral — evolved with fire as part
of their natural cycle. Fire is actually something that helps the cycle
of the landscape reset and continue.
</p>
<p>
And this was something that Indigenous people knew and really sort of
harnessed and used in the way that they tended the lands. But the
genocide of Indigenous people in California really sort of stopped that
cycle, as is the case with colonialism in most places.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Right, you have a chapter about the Indigenous history of fire
in California and the suppression of fire both through violence against
Indigenous communities and also a long history of policies against
fire.</strong>
</p>
<p>
Yeah, the colonial policies of managing the land in California had been
what they call ”total fire exclusion,” which is basically the idea that
all fire is bad and we need to extinguish fires right away. There was a
policy in place called the 10 AM policy that actually said every new
forest fire needs to be extinguished by 10 AM the next morning. And, you
know, there are a lot of reasons why that happened, including profits
and fear and prioritizing human habitat and recreation over the
landscape. But the result is that the landscapes here are actually
neglected at this point, 150 years after colonization.
</p>
<p>
<strong>You wrote at one point about going to prescribed burns and there
was a section that really stood out to me:</strong>
</p>
<p>
<em><strong>Fire is exuberant. It’s joyous. It dances. I can see why
people joke that all firefighters are secret pyros. It’s so much
fun.</strong></em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>I fully relate to this feeling. Has going to prescribed burns
changed your own relationship with fire?</strong>
</p>
<p>
Good fire and cultural fire, which is generally the term we use when
we’re talking about Indigenous use of fire, have radically changed my
feelings about fire. Humans have evolved with fire, and the more I
engage with fire, the more I learn about it, the more I understand its
role in both the land and the history of this place, the less afraid I
feel.
</p>
<p>
<strong>You write about your own experience with getting a hysterectomy
and how that affected your life afterwards, and I thought that was an
interesting choice. You could have written a book that was just about
fire, and we could have never learned about your hysterectomy. But you
chose to include it. Can you tell me a little bit about how that came to
happen?</strong>
</p>
<p>
I could have written a straight journalistic look at wildfire right now
or at the 2020 fire season specifically. And that was something I toyed
with. But I ultimately realized, in thinking about this idea of
cascading disasters, that they’re all happening while people are living
their lives. Climate change, wars, economic ruin are all happening on
top of whatever else is going on in your life. So I thought this part of
my life was worth including.
</p>
<p>
The hysterectomy, and many associated health crises, led me to having
chronic pain. And one of the only things that helped me with that was
gardening. For me, the physical act of literally touching the land,
being in this dialogue with the environment and the ecosystem around me,
was the thing that helped me recover from this health crisis. I wasn’t
quite well. And more importantly, nature wasn’t quite well. And
gardening in this environment is what really made it click for me that
this environment is going through a crisis as well.
</p>
<p>
<strong>That garden was partly how you knew about the oncoming fires in
2020, right?</strong>
</p>
<p>
Yeah, when the Lightning Complex fires started, I was out in my garden
watering the roses. I saw this little black object on the ground, and
when I leaned down and picked it up I saw it was a leaf of a California
bay laurel tree. And it was burned black, but it was still whole. It had
been blown on the wind and landed in my garden. It was sort of like a
messenger, telling me that a few miles away these trees were burning.
</p>
<p>
Bay trees are a natural part of the forest understory here, but they are
highly flammable. They’re basically made of oil, and they serve as
what’s called a ladder fuel; if fire gets in that tree, it will shoot up
it and then can get into the crowns of taller trees like redwoods or
oaks that would normally be more fire resistant. It’s literally a fire
spreader. Anyone who lives in the area will tell you that when there’s a
fire nearby it rains burnt leaves.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Parts of the book are unexpectedly written in the past tense.
You write, for example, that “Northern California
<em>was</em></strong><strong> a very large place,” but the depictions of
events in the past or future are written in the present tense. Was that
intentional? Did you mean to contract the idea of Northern
California?</strong>
</p>
<p>
I absolutely did. The convention in nonfiction is to write events in the
past tense, but to phrase facts, or things that are still true, in the
present tense. I felt like it was important to acknowledge that the
things we take as granted, these truths about the way the environment
works, might not always remain that way. It was also partly a pragmatic
decision, because I didn’t know what would happen before the book came
out. What if my house burned down before that, or if I have to move?
Things are just so chaotic right now.
</p>
<p>
The other time I break with convention is when I write about Indigenous
nations and Indigenous management practices. I intentionally used the
present tense there as a way to push back against the trope of a lot of
non-Indigenous writers portraying Indigenous people and worldviews as
extinct when in fact they’re very, very alive.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Throughout the book you’re constantly talking to your partner
about whether to stay in your home or move away to a “safer” area. I
think it can be really hard for people who don’t live in areas under
threat to grasp just how hard the concept of migrating really
is.</strong>
</p>
<p>
Right, that’s such a common binary: to stay or go. And the reality is
actually a lot messier. I’m fortunate to even have the choice of whether
to stay or go; I am a person who has a lot of different privileges. I
have resources, I have friends, I’m educated, I’m white.
</p>
<p>
Most people don’t willingly leave their homes unless things are really
bad. But it’s never really all bad: Sometimes there’s extreme weather
and disasters, and then there isn’t. It’s up and down. There’s a lot of
talk around what the perfect solution is, where the safe places are. And
the truth is that nowhere is safe because of climate change.
</p>
<p>
For me, the point of living at this moment on this planet is that it’s
messy. It’s full of grief, it’s full of joy and beauty, and it’s also
dangerous. There may be a time when I leave this place, for a variety of
reasons. But I think the idea that you can run away from climate change
is false.
</p>
<p>
Something I’ve learned a lot from talking with people who are deeply
connected to the land here and who work with fire is that you have a
responsibility to the place where you live. If I love this place so
much, what do I owe it? The idea of tending a place for its overall
health, not just for my personal survival, is very powerful.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Right, at one point you write about you and your partner
thinking about doing prescribed burns in the woods near you to help
reduce the risk of more fires.</strong>
</p>
<p>
We have thought a lot about the idea of reintroducing good fire where we
live. Our neighborhood has been getting together and doing work days
where we clear fuels from the forest floor together. And it’s really
proof of how much work is needed, because you can clear brush and cut
dead limbs off trees for a day with a group of 15 people, and then you
look at this tiny quarter acre that you’ve worked on, and it still needs
so much more work.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Stewardship is a constant act.</strong>
</p>
<p>
Absolutely. And it might not be perfect, and honestly it might not make
a difference. These woods might still burn. But if and when they do
burn, they are going to be healthier afterwards because the fire is
going to be healthier.

Stands Firm With Israel Amid Conflict, State Department Tells VOA</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The U.S. says it has an obligation to “stand with our friends” and
support Israel as it continues its operation against militant group
Hamas in the wake of the stunning October 7 attack that left more than
1,400 Israelis dead.</p>
<p>Israel’s offensive has since killed “many, many thousands of
Palestinians,” the White House says – President Joe Biden has openly
questioned figures from the Gaza Ministry of Health, which is run by
Hamas, which the U.S. classifies as a terrorist group. This week,
assistant secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Barbara Leaf told
a House panel that the ministry’s reported death toll – 10,000 people –
may be “higher than is being cited.”</p>
<p>State Department Deputy Spokesperson Nathan Tek spoke late Wednesday
to VOA’s Anita Powell about the conflict, why the U.S. supports
“humanitarian pauses” but not a ceasefire, and why the U.S.’ lead
foreign policy organ believes there is “no equivalency between Israel
and Hamas.”</p>
<p>The interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.</p>
<p>VOA: Let’s start with the conflict between Israel and Hamas. A senior
Biden administration official told us that U.S. support for a cease-fire
depends on the Israelis feeling secure that something like the Hamas
attack will never happen again. Can you elaborate on what that means?
How can we ascertain Israel’s confidence in its security?</p>
<p>Tek: Well, if you take into account what happened on October 7, we
saw the greatest loss of Jewish life since World War II. It was a
profoundly devastating, despicable, abominable attack on Israeli
civilians that day. And of course, Israel has the right and, indeed, the
obligation to defend itself and that is exactly what Israel is doing.
And that is exactly what the United States is helping Israel to do: to
ensure that it has what it needs to do what it takes to defeat Hamas. We
have been quite clear that we support humanitarian pauses so that
civilians can get to safety, so that aid can get to those who need it.
It is not the policy of the United States to support a cease-fire,
because what a cease-fire means, in effect, is that Israel would cease
firing, but that Hamas, of course, would be allowed to regroup,
re-attack and freeze the battle as it is.</p>
<p>VOA: Next week, President Biden meets with President Joko Widodo of
Indonesia, who leads the largest Muslim country in the world. What’s the
message to the leader and the people of this large Muslim country that
aligns itself with the Palestinian cause?</p>
<p>TEK: I’m sure that the conflict between Israel and Hamas will come up
in those meetings. I think our message to any Muslim country – any
Muslim community around the world – is that this is not a religious
conflict. This is not about Israel versus Muslims. This is about Israel
against a terrorist organization, Hamas, that has a radical extremist
interpretation of Islam, that is engaged in a war of choice against
Israel. Hamas has dragged 2 million civilians in Gaza into this conflict
and into the crossfire. So, this is not a religious conflict. This is a
conflict about politics. It’s a conflict about defeating terrorism.
 </p>
<p>VOA: Let’s talk about something that has been coming up in the White
House briefing room, which is: can you explain why the U.S. doesn’t
believe that what Israel is doing in Gaza amounts to collective
punishment – war crimes – which is something that the United Nations’
refugee agency believes?</p>
<p>TEK: I want to be clear here: The United States, of course, supports
Israel’s right to defend itself. Israel is a democracy just like the
United States and democracies, of course, have a special obligation to
protect civilians and to respect international humanitarian law. I think
it is important to draw a distinction – which many unfortunately do not
do – between Hamas and Israel. Hamas has deliberately targeted civilians
and they have continued to do so with rocket attacks on Israeli civilian
infrastructure. Hamas has in fact, without a doubt, violated
international humanitarian law. Hamas has also placed an added burden on
Israel because Hamas uses civilians as human shields. A clear message
that we’ve conveyed to Israel that we’re discussing with Israel as
friends and allies do is that Israel has the obligation to take every
measure possible to minimize civilian casualties. We will continue to
have those conversations with our friend Israel and we will continue to
do what we can to ensure that Israel can defeat a terrorist
organization.</p>
<p>VOA: But to be clear, does the U.S. believe that Israel has crossed
any lines here like Hamas has?</p>
<p>TEK: No, there is no equivalency between Israel and Hamas.</p>
<p>VOA: A senior Hamas official told Lebanese media that Hamas has
intensified its contacts with Beijing and Moscow. Is this a concern for
the U.S., and what are you doing to address this, if anything?</p>
<p>TEK: It is our view that all outside actors and members of the
international community should be playing a positive role here in
seeking to ensure that terrorism does not go unpunished. And we believe
that it is incumbent upon the international community to reject
terrorism, to reject terrorist organizations, and to condemn what Hamas
did on October 7.</p>
<p>VOA: Why is unity among the Group of 7 wealthy liberal democracies on
Israel important, and how is this bloc moving things forward? And what
tools does this bloc have?</p>
<p>TEK: We saw, I think, a very strong statement come out of the G7
meetings in Tokyo, calling for humanitarian pauses, condemning Hamas’
attacks. And I think that really does reflect a sense among the United
States and its closest, most like-minded partners and allies, that what
Hamas did is unacceptable, Hamas should never again be able to use Gaza
as a platform to launch strikes against Israeli civilians, and drag
Palestinian civilians into a conflict that they did not ask for. So, we
will continue to work with our G7 allies and partners – and countries
from around the world, frankly – in order to ensure that terrorism is
defeated, because this is really a multilateral challenge that requires,
in some cases, multilateral solutions.</p>
<p>VOA: My final question is about Ukraine, and something that President
Volodymyr Zelenskyy recently said: he basically said that he needs one
more year of U.S. support. I’d like you to just elaborate on what that
could mean, if you think that that’s realistic, and if he’s going to get
it.</p>
<p>TEK: We have been clear from the start of this conflict that we will
support Ukraine as long as it takes to ensure that Ukraine can defend
the democratic, independent, sovereign and prosperous nature of its
country. And that is something that we’ve made a commitment to, and that
we will continue to fulfill that commitment.</p>
<p>VOA: Is there anything else you’d like to tell our global
audience?</p>
<p>TEK: I just want to thank you for having me. And I want to be clear
that it’s important, in times like these, for the United States to
demonstrate that it stands with its friends and allies around the world.
Israel is engaged in a very serious fight for its future, for its
existence. And we have to stand with our friends.</p>

<p>date: 2023-11-09, from: RiscOS Story</p>
<p>The Midlands User Group (MUG) will be holding their next meeting at
2:00pm on Saturday, 11th November, and with their Xmas Market event
barely a month away, the time will be given over to discussing the mini
show, and finalising plans for it. As such, the meeting may prove a
useful one not only for MUG regulars to attend, but also those who are
planning to exhibit at the event, and perhaps even people just aiming to
visit and see where things are at in the world of RISC OS…</p>

Receives First Eye Transplant in Step Toward One Day Restoring
Sight</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Surgeons have performed the world’s first transplant of an entire
human eye, an extraordinary addition to a face transplant — although
it’s far too soon to know if the man will ever see through his new left
eye. </p>
<p>An accident with high-voltage power lines destroyed most of Aaron
James’ face and one eye. His right eye still works. But surgeons at NYU
Langone Health hoped replacing the missing one would yield better
cosmetic results for his new face, because it would support the
transplanted eye socket and lid. </p>
<p>The NYU team announced Thursday that so far, it’s doing just that.
James is recovering well from the dual transplant last May, and the
donated eye looks remarkably healthy. </p>
<p>“It feels good. I still don’t have any movement in it yet. My eyelid,
I can’t blink yet. But I’m getting sensation now,” James told The
Associated Press as doctors examined his progress recently. </p>
<p>“You got to start somewhere, there’s got to be a first person
somewhere,” said James, 46, of Hot Springs, Arkansas. “Maybe you’ll
learn something from it that will help the next person.” </p>
<p>Today, transplants of the cornea — the clear tissue in front of the
eye — are common to treat certain types of vision loss. But
transplanting the whole eye — the eyeball, its blood supply and the
critical optic nerve that must connect it to the brain — is considered a
moonshot in the quest to cure blindness. </p>
<p>Whatever happens next, James’ surgery offers scientists an
unprecedented window into how the human eye tries to heal. </p>
<p>“We’re not claiming that we are going to restore sight,” said
Dr. Eduardo Rodriguez, NYU’s plastic surgery chief, who led the
transplant. “But there’s no doubt in my mind we are one step
closer.” </p>
<p>Some specialists had feared the eye would quickly shrivel like a
raisin. Instead, when Rodriguez propped open James’ left eyelid last
month, the donated hazel-colored eye was as plump and full of fluid as
his own blue eye. Doctors see good blood flow and no sign of
rejection. </p>
<p>Now researchers have begun analyzing scans of James’ brain that
detected some puzzling signals from that all-important but injured optic
nerve. </p>
<p>One scientist who has long studied how to make eye transplants a
reality called the surgery exciting. </p>
<p>“It’s an amazing validation” of animal experiments that have kept
transplanted eyes alive, said Dr. Jeffrey Goldberg, chair of
ophthalmology at Stanford University. </p>
<p>The hurdle is how to regrow the optic nerve, although animal studies
are making strides, Goldberg said. He praised the NYU team’s “audacity”
in even aiming for optic nerve repair and said he hopes the transplant
will spur more research. </p>
<p>“We’re really on the precipice of being able to do this,” Goldberg
said. </p>
<p>James was working for a power line company in June 2021 when he was
shocked by a live wire. He nearly died. Ultimately, he lost his left
arm, requiring a prosthetic. His damaged left eye was so painful it had
to be removed. Multiple reconstructive surgeries couldn’t repair
extensive facial injuries including his missing nose and lips. </p>
<p>James pushed through physical therapy until he was strong enough to
escort his daughter Allie to a high school homecoming ceremony, wearing
a face mask and eye patch. Still, he required breathing and feeding
tubes, and he longed to smell, taste and eat solid food again. </p>
<p>“In his mind and his heart, it’s him — so I didn’t care that, you
know, he didn’t have a nose. But I did care that it bothered him,” said
his wife, Meagan James. </p>
<p>Face transplants remain rare and risky. James’ is only the 19th in
the United States, the fifth Rodriguez has performed. The eye experiment
added even more complexity. But James figured he’d be no worse off if
the donated eye failed. </p>
<p>Three months after James was placed on the national transplant
waiting list, a matching donor was found. Kidneys, a liver and pancreas
from the donor, a man in his 30s, saved three other people. </p>
<p>During James’ 21-hour operation, surgeons added another experimental
twist: When they spliced together the donated optic nerve to what
remained of James’ original, they injected special stem cells from the
donor in hopes of spurring its repair. </p>
<p>Last month, tingles heralded healing facial nerves. James can’t yet
open the eyelid and wears a patch to protect it. But as Rodriguez pushed
on the closed eye, James felt a sensation — although on his nose rather
than his eyelid, presumably until slow-growing nerves get reoriented.
The surgeon also detected subtle movements beginning in muscles around
the eye. </p>
<p>Then came a closer look. NYU ophthalmologist Dr. Vaidehi Dedania ran
a battery of tests. She found expected damage in the light-sensing
retina in the back of the eye. But she said it appears to have enough
special cells called photoreceptors to do the job of converting light to
electrical signals, one step in creating vision. </p>
<p>Normally, the optic nerve then would send those signals to the brain
to be interpreted. James’ optic nerve clearly hasn’t healed. Yet when
light was flashed into the donated eye during an MRI, the scan recorded
some sort of brain signaling. </p>
<p>That both excited and baffled researchers, although it wasn’t the
right type for vision and may simply be a fluke, cautioned Dr. Steven
Galetta, NYU’s neurology chair. Only time and more study may tell. </p>
<p>As for James, “we’re just taking it one day at a time,” he said.</p>

The enshittification of garage-door openers reveals a vast and deadly
rot (09 Nov 2023)</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-09, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links The enshittification of garage-door openers reveals a
vast and deadly rot: Firms undisciplined by competition, regulation, or
self-help measures. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in
history: 2003, 2008, 2013, 2018, 2022 Colophon: Recent publications,
upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading
The enshittification of garage-door openers reveals a vast and deadly
rot (permalink) How could this happen? Owners of Chamberlain MyQ
automatic garage door openers just woke up to discover that the company
had confiscated valuable features overnight, and that there was nothing
they could do about it. Oh, we know what happened, technically speaking.
Chamberlain shut off the API for its garage-door openers, which breaks
their integration with home automation systems like Home Assistant. The
company even announced that it was doing this, calling the integration
an “unauthorized usage” of its products, though the “unauthorized”
parties in this case are the people who own Chamberlain products:
https://chamberlaingroup.com/press/a-message-about-our-decision-to-prevent-unauthorized-usage-of-myq
We even know why Chamberlain did this. As Ars Technica’s Ron Amadeo
points out, shutting off the API is a way for Chamberlain to force its
customers to use its ad-beshitted, worst-of-breed app, so that it can
make a few pennies by nonconsensually monetizing its customers’
eyeballs:
https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/chamberlain-blocks-smart-garage-door-opener-from-working-with-smart-homes/
But how did this happen? How did a giant company like Chamberlain come
to this enshittening juncture, in which it felt empowered to sabotage
the products it had already sold to its customers? How can this be
legal? How can it be good for business? How can the people who made this
decision even look themselves in the mirror? To answer these questions,
we must first consider the forces that discipline companies, acting
against the impulse to enshittify their products and services. There are
four constraints on corporate conduct: I. Competition. The fear of
losing your business to a rival can stay even the most sociopathic
corporate executive’s hand. II. Regulation. The fear of being fined,
criminally sanctioned, or banned from doing business can check the
greediest of leaders. III. Capability. Corporate executives can dream up
all kinds of awful ways to shift value from your side of the ledger to
their own, but they can only do the things that are technically
feasible. IV. Self-help. The possibility of customers modifying,
reconfiguring or altering their products to restore lost functionality
or neutralize antifeatures carries an implied threat to vendors. If a
printer company’s anti-generic-ink measures drives a customer to
jailbreak their printers, the original manufacturer’s connection to that
customer is permanently severed, as the customer creates a durable
digital connection to a rival. When companies act in obnoxious,
dishonest, shitty ways, they aren’t merely yielding to temptation – they
are evading these disciplining forces. Thus, the Great Enshittening we
are living through doesn’t reflect an increase in the wickedness of
corporate leadership. Rather, it represents a moment in which each of
these disciplining factors have been gutted by specific policies. This
is good news, actually. We used to put down rat poison and we didn’t
have a rat problem. Then we stopped putting down rat poison and rats are
eating us alive. That’s not a nice feeling, but at least we know at
least one way of addressing it – we can start putting down poison again.
That is, we can start enforcing the rules that we stopped enforcing, in
living memory. Having a terrible problem is no fun, but the best kind of
terrible problem to have is one that you know a solution to. As it
happens, Chamberlain is a neat microcosm for all the bad policy choices
that created the Era of Enshittification. Let’s go through them:
Competition: Chamberlain doesn’t have to worry about competition,
because it is owned by a private equity fund that “rolled up” all of
Chamberlain’s major competitors into a single, giant firm. Most
garage-door opener brands are actually Chamberlain, including
“LiftMaster, Chamberlain, Merlin, and Grifco”:
https://www.lakewoodgaragedoor.biz/blog/the-history-of-garage-door-openers
This is a pretty typical PE rollup, and it exploits a bug in US
competition law called “Antitrust’s Twilight Zone”:
https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/16/schumpeterian-terrorism/#deliberately-broken
When companies buy each other, they are subject to “merger scrutiny,” a
set of guidelines that the FTC and DoJ Antitrust Division use to
determine whether the outcome is likely to be bad for competition. These
rules have been pretty lax since the Reagan administration, but they’ve
currently being revised to make them substantially more strict:
https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-and-ftc-seek-comment-draft-merger-guidelines
One of the blind spots in these merger guidelines is an exemption for
mergers valued at less than $101m. Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act,
these fly under the radar, evading merger scrutiny. That means that
canny PE companies can roll up dozens and dozens of standalone
businesses, like funeral homes, hospital beds, magic mushrooms, youth
addiction treatment centers, mobile home parks, nursing homes,
physicians’ practices, local newspapers, or e-commerce sellers:
http://www.economicliberties.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Serial-Acquisitions-Working-Paper-R4-2.pdf
By titrating the purchase prices, PE companies – like Blackstone, owners
of Chamberlain and all the other garage-door makers – can acquire a
monopoly without ever raising a regulatory red flag. But antitrust
enforcers aren’t helpless. Under (the long dormant) Section 7 of the
Clayton Act, competition regulators can block mergers that lead to
“incipient monopolization.” The incipiency standard prevented monopolies
from forming from 1914, when the Clayton Act passed, until the Reagan
administration. We used to put down rat poison, and we didn’t have rats.
We stopped, and rats are gnawing our faces off. We still know where the
rat poison is – maybe we should start putting it down again. On to
regulation. How is it possible for Chamberlain to sell you a garage-door
opener that has an API and works with your chosen home automation
system, and then unilaterally confiscate that valuable feature?
Shouldn’t regulation protect you from this kind of ripoff? It should,
but it doesn’t. Instead, we have a bunch of regulations that protect
Chamberlain from you. Think of binding arbitration, which allows
Chamberlain to force you to click through an “agreement” that takes away
your right to sue them or join a class-action suit:
https://pluralistic.net/2022/10/20/benevolent-dictators/#felony-contempt-of-business-model
But regulation could protect you from Chamberlain. Section 5 of the
Federal Trade Commission Act allows the FTC to ban any “unfair and
deceptive” conduct. This law has been on the books since 1914, but
Section 5 has been dormant, forgotten and unused, for decades. The FTC’s
new dynamo chair, Lina Khan, has revived it, and is use it like a
can-opener to free Americans who’ve been trapped by abusive conduct:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/10/the-courage-to-govern/#whos-in-charge
Khan’s used Section 5 powers to challenge privacy invasions, noncompete
clauses, and other corporate abuses – the bait-and-switch tactics of
Chamberlain are ripe for a Section 5 case. If you buy a gadget because
it has five features and then the vendor takes two of them away, they
are clearly engaged in “unfair and deceptive” conduct. On to capability.
Since time immemorial, corporate leaders have fetishized “flexibility”
in their business arrangements – like the ability to do “dynamic
pricing” that changes how much you pay for something based on their
guess about how much you are willing to pay. But this impulse to play
shell games runs up against the hard limits of physical reality: grocers
just can’t send an army of rollerskated teenagers around the store to
reprice everything as soon as a wealthy or desperate-looking customer
comes through the door. They’re stuck with crude tactics like doubling
the price of a flight that doesn’t include a Saturday stay as a way of
gouging business travelers on an expense account. With any shell-game,
the quickness of the hand deceives the eye. Corporate crooks armed with
computers aren’t smarter or more wicked than their analog forebears, but
they are faster. Digital tools allow companies to alter the “business
logic” of their services from instant to instant, in highly automated
ways: https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/19/twiddler/ The monopoly
coalition has successfully argued that this endless “twiddling” should
not be constrained by privacy, labor or consumer protection law. Without
these constraints, corporate twiddlers can engage in all kinds of
ripoffs, like wage theft and algorithmic wage discrimination:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/12/algorithmic-wage-discrimination/#fishers-of-men
Twiddling is key to the Darth Vader MBA (“I am altering the deal. Pray I
don’t alter it further”), in which features are confiscated from moment
to moment, without warning or recourse:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/10/26/hit-with-a-brick/#graceful-failure
There’s no reason to accept the premise that violating your privacy,
labor rights or consumer rights with a computer is so different from
analog ripoffs that existing laws don’t apply. The unconstrained
twiddling of digital ripoff artists is a plague on billions of peoples’
lives, and any enforcer who sticks up for our rights will have an army
of supporters behind them. Finally, there’s the fear of self-help
measures. All the digital flexibility that tech companies use to take
value away can be used to take it back, too. The whole modern history of
digital computers is the history of “adversarial interoperability,” in
which the sleazy antifeatures of established companies are banished
through reverse-engineering, scraping, bots and other forms of
technological guerrilla warfare:
https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/10/adversarial-interoperability
Adversarial interoperability represents a serious threat to established
business. If you’re a printer company gouging on toner, your customers
might defect to a rival that jailbreaks your security measures. That’s
what happened to Lexmark, who lost a case against the toner-refilling
company Static Controls, which went on to buy Lexmark:
https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/06/felony-contempt-business-model-lexmarks-anti-competitive-legacy
Sure, your customers are busy and inattentive and you can degrade the
quality of your product a lot before they start looking for ways out.
But once they cross that threshold, you can lose them forever. That’s
what happened to Microsoft: the company made the tactical decision to
produce a substandard version of Office for the Mac in a drive to get
Mac users to switch to Windows. Instead, Apple made Iwork (Pages,
Numbers and Keynote), which could read and write every Office file, and
Mac users threw away Office, the only Microsoft product they owned,
permanently severing their relationship to the company:
https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/06/adversarial-interoperability-reviving-elegant-weapon-more-civilized-age-slay
Today, companies can operate without worrying about this kind of
self-help measure. There’ a whole slew of IP rights that Chamberlain can
enforce against you if you try to fix your garage-door opener yourself,
or look to a competitor to sell you a product that restores the feature
they took away: https://locusmag.com/2020/09/cory-doctorow-ip/
Jailbreaking your Chamberlain gadget in order to make it answer to a
rival’s app involves bypassing a digital lock. Trafficking in a tool to
break a digital lock is a felony under Section 1201 of the Digital
Millennium Copyright, carrying a five-year prison sentence and a
$500,000 fine. In other words, it’s not just that tech isn’t regulated,
allowing for endless twiddling against your privacy, consumer rights and
labor rights. It’s that tech is badly regulated, to permit unlimited
twiddling by tech companies to take away your rightsand to prohibit any
twiddling by you to take them back. The US government thumbs the scales
against you, creating a regime that Jay Freeman aptly dubbed “felony
contempt of business model”:
https://pluralistic.net/2022/10/23/how-to-fix-cars-by-breaking-felony-contempt-of-business-model/
All kinds of companies have availed themselves of this government-backed
superpower. There’s DRM – digital locks, covered by DMCA 1201 – in
powered wheelchairs:

It should come as no surprise to learn that Chamberlain has used DMCA
1201 to block interoperable garage door opener components:
https://scholarship.law.marquette.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1233&amp;amp;context=iplr
That’s how we arrived at this juncture, where a company like Chamberlain
can break functionality its customers value highly, solely to eke out a
minuscule new line of revenue by selling ads on their own app.
Chamberlain bought all its competitors. Chamberlain operates in a
regulatory environment that is extremely tolerant of unfair and
deceptive practices. Worse: they can unilaterally take away your right
to sue them, which means that if regulators don’t bestir themselves to
police Chamberlain, you are shit out of luck. Chamberlain has endless
flexibility to unilaterally alter its products’ functionality, in
fine-grained ways, even after you’ve purchased them. Chamberlain can sue
you if you try to exercise some of that same flexibility to protect
yourself from their bad practices. Combine all four of those factors,
and of course Chamberlain is going to enshittify its products. Every
company has had that one weaselly asshole at the product-planning table
who suggests a petty grift like breaking every one of the company’s
customers’ property to sell a few ads. But historically, the weasel lost
the argument to others, who argued that making every existing customer
furious would affect the company’s bottom line, costing it sales and/or
fines, and prompting customers to permanently sever their relationship
with the company by seeking out and installing alternative software.
Take away all the constraints on a corporation’s worst impulses, and
this kind of conduct is inevitable:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/07/28/microincentives-and-enshittification/
This isn’t limited to Chamberlain. Without the discipline of
competition, regulation, self-help measures or technological
limitations, every industry in undergoing wholesale enshittification.
It’s not a coincidence that Chamberlain’s grift involves a push to move
users into its app. Because apps can’t be reverse-engineered and
modified without risking DMCA 1201 prosecution, forcing a user into an
app is a tidy and reliable way to take away that user’s rights. Think
about ad-blocking. One in four web users has installed an ad-blockers
(“the biggest boycott in world history” -Doc Searls). Zero app users
have installed app-blockers, because they don’t exist, because making
one is a felony. An app is just a web-page wrapped in enough IP to make
it a crime to defend yourself against corporate predation:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/08/27/an-audacious-plan-to-halt-the-internets-enshittification-and-throw-it-into-reverse/
The temptation to enshitiffy isn’t new, but the ability to do so without
consequence is a modern phenomenon, the intersection of weak policy
enforcement and powerful technology. Your car is autoenshittified, a
rolling rent-seeking platform that spies on you and price-gouges you:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/07/24/rent-to-pwn/#kitt-is-a-demon Cars are
in an uncontrolled skid over Enshittification Cliff. Honda, Toyota, VW
and GM all sell cars with infotainment systems that harvest your
connected phone’s text-messages and send them to the corporation for
data-mining. What’s more, a judge in Washington state just ruled that
this is legal:
https://therecord.media/class-action-lawsuit-cars-text-messages-privacy
While there’s no excuse for this kind of sleazy conduct, we can
reasonably anticipate that if our courts would punish companies for
engaging in it, they might be able to resist the temptation. No wonder
Mozilla’s latest Privacy Not Included research report called cars “the
worst product category we have ever reviewed”:
https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/privacynotincluded/articles/its-official-cars-are-the-worst-product-category-we-have-ever-reviewed-for-privacy/
I mean, Nissan tries to infer facts about your sex life and sells those
inferences to marketing companies:
https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/privacynotincluded/nissan/ But the OG
digital companies are the masters of enshittification. Microsoft has
been at this game for longer than anyone, and every day brings a fresh
way that Microsoft has worsened its products without fear of
consequence. The latest? You can’t delete your OneDrive account until
you provide an acceptable explanation for your disloyalty:
https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/8/23952878/microsoft-onedrive-windows-close-app-notification
It’s tempting to think that the cruelty is the point, but it isn’t. It’s
almost never the point. The point is power and money. Unscrupulous
businesses have found ways to make money by making their products worse
since the industrial revolution. Here’s Jules Dupuis, writing about 19th
century French railroads: It is not because of the few thousand francs
which would have to be spent to put a roof over the third-class
carriages or to upholster the third-class seats that some company or
other has open carriages with wooden benches. What the company is trying
to do is to prevent the passengers who can pay the second class fare
from traveling third class; it hits the poor, not because it wants to
hurt them, but to frighten the rich. And it is again for the same reason
that the companies, having proved almost cruel to the third-class
passengers and mean to the second-class ones, become lavish in dealing
with first-class passengers. Having refused the poor what is necessary,
they give the rich what is superfluous.
https://www.tumblr.com/mostlysignssomeportents/731357317521719296/having-refused-the-poor-what-is-necessary-they
But as bad as all this is, let me remind you about the good part: we
know how to stop companies from enshittifying their products. We know
what disciplines their conduct: competition, regulation, capability and
self-help measures. Yes, rats are gnawing our eyeballs, but we know
which rat-poison to use, and where to put it to control those rats.
Competition, regulation, constraint and self-help measures all backstop
one another, and while one or a few can make a difference, they are most
powerful when they’re all mobilized in concert. Think of the failure of
the EU’s landmark privacy law, the GDPR. While the GDPR proved very
effective against bottom-feeding smaller ad-tech companies, the worse
offenders, Meta and Google, have thumbed their noses at it. This was
enabled in part by the companies’ flying an Irish flag of convenience,
maintaining the pretense that they have to be regulated in a notorious
corporate crime-haven:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/05/15/finnegans-snooze/#dirty-old-town That
let them get away with all kinds of shenanigans, like ignoring the
GDPR’s requirement that you should be able to easily opt out of
data-collection without having to go through cumbersome “cookie consent”
dialogs or losing access to the service as punishment for declining to
be tracked. As the noose has tightened around these surveillance giants,
they’re continuing to play games. Meta now says that the only way to opt
out of data-collection in the EU is to pay for the service:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/10/30/markets-remaining-irrational/#steins-law
This is facially illegal under the GDPR. Not only are they prohibited
from punishing you for opting out of collection, but the whole scheme
ignores the nature of private data collection. If Facebook collects the
fact that you and I are friends, but I never opted into data-collection,
they have violated the GDPR, even if you were coerced into granting
consent:
https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2023/11/the-pay-or-consent-challenge-for-platform-regulators.html
The GDPR has been around since 2016 and Google and Meta are still
invading 500 million Europeans’ privacy. This latest delaying tactic
could add years to their crime-spree before they are brought to justice.
But most of this surveillance is only possible because so much of how
you interact with Google and Meta is via an app, and an app is just a
web-page that’s a felony to make an ad-blocker for. If the EU were to
legalize breaking DRM – repealing Article 6 of the 2001 Copyright
Directive – then we wouldn’t have to wait for the European Commission to
finally wrestle these two giant companies to the ground. Instead, EU
companies could make alternative clients for all of Google and Meta’s
services that don’t spy on you, without suffering the fate of OG App,
which tried this last winter and was shut down by “felony contempt of
business model”:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/05/battery-vampire/#drained
Enshittification is demoralizing. To quote Wil Wheaton, every update to
the services we use inspires “dread of ‘How will this complicate things
as I try to maintain privacy and sanity in a world that demands I have
this thing to operate?’”
https://wilwheaton.tumblr.com/post/698603648058556416/cory-doctorow-if-you-see-this-and-have-thoughts
But there are huge natural constituencies for the four disciplining
forces that keep enshittification at bay. Remember, Antitrust’s Twilight
Zone doesn’t just allow rollups of garage-door opener companies – it’s
also poison for funeral homes, hospital beds, magic mushrooms, youth
addiction treatment centers, mobile home parks, nursing homes,
physicians’ practices, local newspapers, or e-commerce sellers. The
Binding Arbitration scam that stops Chamberlain customers from suing the
company also stops Uber drivers from suing over stolen wages, Turbotax
customers from suing over fraud, and many other victims of corporate
crime from getting a day in court. The failure to constrain twiddling to
protect privacy, labor rights and consumer rights enables a host of
abuses, from stalking, doxing and SWATting to wage theft and price
gouging:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/11/06/attention-rents/#consumer-welfare-queens
And Felony Contempt of Business Model is used to screw you over every
time you refill your printer, run your dishwasher, or get your Iphone’s
screen replaced. The actions needed to halt and reverse this
enshittification are well understood, and the partisans for taking those
actions are too numerous to count. It’s taken a long time for all those
individuals suffering under corporate abuses to crystallize into a
movement, but at long last, it’s happening. (Image: Cryteria, CC BY 3.0,

Treasury Secretary to Meet Chinese Vice Premier in What Analysts See as
Act of Diplomacy</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen kicks off two days of talks with
Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng Thursday as the U.S. looks to manage
tensions with Beijing and keep dialogue open on a range of issues from
climate change to trade and defense.</p>
<p>Following Yellen’s meetings on Thursday and Friday, presidents Joe
Biden and Xi Jinping are expected to meet next week on the sidelines of
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, or APEC, forum in San
Francisco.</p>
<p>Analysts say Yellen’s meeting with He is the latest attempt to ensure
that China doesn’t back out of the upcoming meeting between the two
heads of state. Yellen has previously emphasized a relationship based on
“healthy competition” rather than mutual scorn.</p>
<p>In remarks to He ahead of the talks in San Francisco, Yellen said
that “the United States has no intention to decouple from China …” but
when concerns arise “about specific economic practices, such as those
that prevent American firms and workers from competing on a level
playing field, we will communicate them directly.”</p>
<p>He told Yellen through an interpreter that his meetings with her have
been “constructive.” He also said that U.S.-China relations needed to be
restored “back to a healthy and stable development.” </p>
<p>Maintaining lines of communication is how Yellen has so far advanced
her diplomacy and prevented misunderstandings about U.S. foreign policy.
In July, she visited Beijing to meet with He.</p>
<p>“This week, I will speak to my counterpart about our serious concerns
with Beijing’s unfair economic practices, including its large-scale use
of non-market tools, its barriers to market access, and its coercive
actions against U.S. firms in China,” Yellen wrote in an op-ed for The
Washington Post that was published on Monday.</p>
<p>In that op-ed, Yellen also emphasized that global problems, including
climate change and debt relief for developing nations, could provide
opportunities for bilateral cooperation.</p>
<p>Some information for this report was provided by Reuters.</p>

<a href="https://www.kron4.com/news/bay-area/video-cruise-cars-halt-traffic-in-sf-cite-connectivity-issues-linked-to-outside-lands-festival/">traffic
congestion</a> they exacerbate, the really devastating part of the
article is the economics. Below the fold, I lay out the numbers.<br />
<span><a name='more'></a></span> <br /> The reason robotaxis look like a
good investment is that the up-front investment in equipping cars with
high-tech sensors and powerful computers would earn returns in two ways,
by removing the need to pay drivers, and by operating 24/7. In the real
world, it isn’t quite that simple.<br /> <br /> First, the investment is
very significant. The NYT team reports on
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/21/technology/waymo-driverless-cars-san-francisco.html">Waymo</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/24/technology/self-driving-cars-wait.html">cars
are staggeringly expensive</a>, outfitted with high-tech sensors and
cameras, and are worth as much as $200,000.
</blockquote>
And on
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/03/technology/cruise-general-motors-self-driving-cars.html">Cruise</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Each Chevrolet Bolt that Cruise operates costs $150,000 to $200,000,
according to a person familiar with its operations.
</blockquote>
So the upfront investment is around $150K/car. Assuming a 5-year life
and 7% interest, the annual cost would be around $32K, or about $90/day.
After paying about $12/hr for fuel, insurance, repairs, depreciation and
so on an
<a href="https://therideshareguy.com/how-much-do-uber-drivers-make/">Uber
driver makes $18/hr</a>, or assuming an 8hr day, $144/day. The robotaxi
looks like it is about $54/day ahead.<br /> <br /> Proponents will claim
that the robotaxi works 24hrs/day, not just 8. But the demand for rides
isn’t constant through the day. The robotaxi fleet needs enough cars to
satisfy peak demand, so most will be idle for most of the time, still
consuming interest and depreciation. Uber doesn’t pay for the cars, and
Uber drivers only work when there is enough demand for rides. I think
this is roughly a wash, so the robotaxi stays about $54/day ahead.<br />
<br /> So far I have assumed that the robotaxi fleet needs no humans.
But, as the NYT team reports, that
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/03/technology/cruise-general-motors-self-driving-cars.html">isn’t
the case</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Half of Cruise’s 400 cars were in San Francisco when the driverless
operations were stopped. Those vehicles were supported by a vast
operations staff, with 1.5 workers per vehicle.
</blockquote>
With 1.5 workers at Uber’s pay rate the robotaxi’s staff and equipment
is costing $306/day, so the robotaxi is $162/day behind, and Cruise is
unlikely to be able to pay only $18/hr. What were the 1.5 people per car
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/03/technology/cruise-general-motors-self-driving-cars.html">actually
doing</a>?<br />
<blockquote>
The workers intervened to assist the company’s vehicles every 2.5 to
five miles, according to two people familiar with is operations.
</blockquote>
Lora Kolodny followed up the NYT team’s reporting in
<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/06/cruise-confirms-robotaxis-rely-on-human-assistance-every-4-to-5-miles.html"><i>Cruise
confirms robotaxis rely on human assistance every four to five
miles</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Vogt confirmed that the General Motors-owned company does have a remote
assistance team, in response to a discussion under the header, “GM’s
Cruise alleged to rely on human operators to achieve ‘autonomous’
driving.”<br /> <br /> The CEO wrote, “Cruise AVs are being remotely
assisted (RA) 2-4% of the time on average, in complex urban
environments. This is low enough already that there isn’t a huge cost
benefit to optimizing much further, especially given how useful it is to
have humans review things in certain situations.”
</blockquote>
Clearly, the robotaxi fleet needs some staff. The cars need refueling,
say every 200 miles. They need cleaning. Lets guess the average ride is
5 miles and they need cleaning every 10 rides. That would be staff
required every 40 miles. So the vast majority of interventions are
because Cruise’s self-driving technology just can’t handle San Francisco
traffic. They may be called robotaxis, just pay no attention to the
driver behind the curtain. These remote drivers will be <i>more
expensive</i> than the in-car drivers they are replacing!<br /> <br />
Overall, their robotaxi operation is costing GM a
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/03/technology/cruise-general-motors-self-driving-cars.html">boatload
of money</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
G.M. has spent an average of $588 million a quarter on Cruise over the
past year, a 42 percent increase from a year ago.
</blockquote>
$2,232B/year for 400 cars is $5.6M per car per year! How could each car
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/03/technology/cruise-general-motors-self-driving-cars.html">earn
this much</a>?<br />
<blockquote>
The company charged an average of $10.50 per ride in the city.
</blockquote>
To generate $5.6M each car would have to service 510K rides/year or
1,400 rides/day, or one ride per minute. Cruise’s goal, before they got
shut down,
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/03/technology/cruise-general-motors-self-driving-cars.html">was
less ambitious</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The shutdown complicates Cruise’s ambition of hitting its goal of $1
billion of revenue in 2025.
</blockquote>
Covering less than half their costs in 2025 is about 91M rides, or about
250K/day. Lets be generous, and assume 10 rides/day/car. They would need
25K Chevrolet Bolts. Scaling the operation from 400 to 25K in under 2
years would be hard. It would be made harder because
<a href="https://gmauthority.com/blog/2023/11/gm-confirms-2023-chevy-bolt-ev-bolt-euv-production-will-end-in-december/">Bolt
production stops next month</a>. But even if the Bolts were available,
this would be an additional investment of between $3.7B and $5B in order
to lose only $1.2B/year.<br /> <br /> I’m not the only one pointing out
that the numbers don’t add up. Here, for example, is
<a href="https://www.eschatonblog.com/2023/11/imagine-theres-no-people.html">Atrios</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Focusing on the notoriously high margin taxi business has always been
odd, in that even if they “work” it’s not entirely clear where the big
profit opportunity is! Replacing low wage workers with expensive
machines that require a lot of attention from people who have more
specialized skills than “driving” doesn’t seem to be such a great
plan!<br /> <br /> I get the appeal for the carbrained. What “we” all
want is a 24 hour driver at an affordable rate. It’s just not quite
clear what the business model is, even if the technology works!<br />
<br /> People always point to niche cases in which robot car would be
particularly useful. But they’re niche cases and you need scale to make
anything in this industry profitable! Scale is necessary for a lot of
reasons, but one is maintenance and spare parts production. Your
self-driving campus vans won’t last long if there’s only one guy who
knows to maintain them and the parts manufacturer just went bankrupt.
</blockquote>
Last August, Hubert Horan continued his long-running series with
<a href="https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2023/08/hubert-horan-can-uber-ever-deliver-part-thirty-three-uber-isnt-really-profitable-yet-but-is-getting-closer-the-antitrust-case-against-uber.html"><i>Part
Thirty-Three: Uber Isn’t Really Profitable Yet But is Getting Closer;
The Antitrust Case Against Uber</i></a>, which starts:<br />
<blockquote>
<b>After $33 Billion in Losses Over 14 Years, Uber is Finally
Approaching GAAP Breakeven</b><br /> <br /> Uber claimed its first ever
quarterly GAAP profit when it released its second quarter and first half
financial results on August 1. The claim was a bit of stretch as the
reported $394 million second quarter profit ($237 million for the first
half) was entirely explained by an alleged $386 million second quarter
gain ($707 million in the first half) in the value of untradable
securities they hold in companies like Didi, Grab, and Aurora that have
nothing to do with their ongoing operations. Readers of this series will
know that Uber has aggressively used claims like this to justify
misleading claims about its corporate financial performance ever since
2018 when it inflated published net income numbers by $5.8 billion just
prior to its IPO.
</blockquote>
Uber has always viewed drivers as a temporary necessity to tide them
over until robotaxis take over and boost them into actual instead of
manipulated profits. Last month they started offering
<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/26/uber-begins-offering-rides-in-self-driving-waymo-cars.html">robotaxi
service in Phoenix</a> using Waymo’s cars. But unless Waymo is showing
them radically different numbers than the NYT team found for Cruise,
Horan’s series is going to run and run.<br /> <br /> These numbers look
even worse for Tesla. Last year Matthew Loh reported that
<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-tesla-worth-basically-zero-without-self-driving-2022-6"><i>Elon
Musk says the difference between Tesla being ‘worth a lot of money or
worth basically zero’ all comes down to solving self-driving
technology</i></a>, and the reason was that owners would rent out their
Teslas as robotaxis when they weren’t using them. This was always
obviously a stupid idea; who wants drunkards home-bound from the pub
throwing up on their Tesla’s seats? But the fact that the numbers don’t
add up for robotaxis in general, and the fact that
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/27/23934691/hertz-tesla-uber-ev-plans-damage-repair-price-cuts"><i>Hertz
is scaling back its EV ambitions because its Teslas keep getting
damaged</i></a> because half of them are being used by Uber drivers as
taxis, make the idea even more laughable.<br /> <br /> It is really
surprising that the DMV took so long to shut Cruise down. In August
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/21/technology/waymo-driverless-cars-san-francisco.html">the
NYT team wrote</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Last week, a Cruise driverless car collided with a fire truck responding
to an emergency.
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/17/us/driverless-car-accident-sf.html">Another

Cruise cars blocked traffic</a> in the city’s North Beach neighborhood.
</blockquote>
More recently,
<a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/11/06/cruise-self-driving-cars-children/">Sam
Biddle reported that</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
previously unreported internal materials such as chat logs show Cruise
has known internally about two pressing safety issues: Driverless Cruise
cars struggled to detect large holes in the road and have so much
trouble recognizing children in certain scenarios that they risked
hitting them. Yet, until it came under fire this month, Cruise kept its
fleet of driverless taxis active, maintaining its
<a href="https://getcruise.com/news/blog/2023/human-ridehail-crash-rate-benchmark/">regular
reassurances of superhuman safety</a>.
</blockquote>
In contrast, all the NYT team could find to report
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/21/technology/waymo-driverless-cars-san-francisco.html">about
Waymo was</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
In May, one of its
<a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/file/waymo_052123-pdf/">cars
struck and killed a small dog</a>. A few years ago,
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/waymo-says-self-driving-car-that-struck-pedestrian-in-san-francisco-was-in-manual-mode/">a
driverless Waymo car with a human safety driver operating the wheel</a>
hit a pedestrian who needed to be taken to the hospital. The company has
been collecting fares in the Phoenix area for several years and now has
a fleet navigating some 200 miles across that region, including to and
from the airport.
</blockquote>
Why is Cruise so much less safe? The NYT team
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/03/technology/cruise-general-motors-self-driving-cars.html">write</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Company insiders are putting the blame for what went wrong on a tech
industry culture — led by the 38-year-old Mr. Vogt — that put a priority
on the speed of the program over safety. In the competition between
Cruise and its top driverless car rival, Waymo, Mr. Vogt wanted to
dominate in the same way Uber dominated its smaller ride-hailing
competitor, Lyft.<br /> <br /> “Kyle is a guy who is willing to take
risks, and he is willing to move quickly. He is very Silicon Valley,”
said Matthew Wansley, a professor at the Cardozo School of Law in New
York who specializes in emerging automotive technologies. “That both
explains the success of Cruise and its mistakes.”
</blockquote>
As someone who has been sharing the roads with Waymo cars for many
years, I have always believed that Waymo, unlike Cruise and much worse
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2023/10/elon-musk-threat-or-menace-part-3.html">Tesla</a>,
understood that it was necessary to <i>prove</i> that self-driving
technology was safe, not just gaslight the public as
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/03/technology/cruise-general-motors-self-driving-cars.html">Mr. Vogt
did</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
To make streets safer, he said in an interview, cities should embrace
self-driving cars like those designed by Cruise, a subsidiary of General
Motors. They do not get distracted, drowsy or drunk, he said, and being
programmed to put safety first meant they could substantially reduce
car-related fatalities.
</blockquote>
Two months later Cruise’s safety record got them shut down.
<a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/11/06/cruise-self-driving-cars-children/">The
very same day</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
CEO Mary Barra told financial analysts that Cruise “is safer than a
human driver and is constantly improving and getting better.”

exec defends 8GB $1,599 MacBook Pro, claims it’s like 16GB on a PC</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>Eight gigabytes has been the standard RAM load out on new MacBook
Pros for the better part of a decade, and in 2023, Apple execs still
believe it’s enough for customers. With the launch of Apple’s M3 MacBook
Pros last month, a base 14-inch $1,599 model with an M3 chip still only
gets you 8GB of unified DRAM that’s shared between the CPU, GPU, and
neural network accelerator. In a show of Apple’s typical modesty this
week, the tech giant’s veep of worldwide product marketing Bob Borchers
has argued, in an interview with machine-learning engineer Lin YilYi,
that the Arm-compatible, Apple-designed M-series silicon and software
stack is so memory efficient that 8GB on a Mac may equal 16GB on a PC –
so we therefore ought to be happy with it. Eight gigabyte of RAM in and
of itself isn’t an issue, on a budget machine. Apple is selling
incredibly expensive machines labelled as “pro” with a mere 8 GB, and
charges €200 for another 8, which is highway robbery, plain and simple.
I wonder how many people at Apple – at any level – use Macs with 8 GB of
RAM. I have a feeling that number is quite low.</p>

the exploration was useful. I think this process still has quite a ways

still a miracle of technology. And a miracle for this human, because

The only issue is that it currently contains a lot of unnecessary junk

Extra Credit” project</a>, we’re watching Martin Scorsese’s new feature
film, “Killers of the Flower Moon.” The film shows how white settlers
terrorized members of the Osage Nation, violently attempting to acquire
their oil resources. We’re joined by professor and Osage Nation citizen
Jean Dennison to define key concepts in the film, including headrights
and guardianships. But first: What’s up with Speaker Mike Johnson’s

UK faces legal action over “toxic culture” allegations</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-09, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
From the BBC World Service: A group of young former McDonald’s workers
in the United Kingdom is taking the fast food chain to court, accusing
it of failing to protect them at work. Earlier this year, a BBC
investigation revealed allegations of sexual assault, harassment, racism
and bullying. Plus, Bangladesh is the world’s second-largest exporter of
clothes, but workers are protesting over better pay and conditions.
Then, as the French government hosts a conference in Paris today to
discuss ways of getting humanitarian aid to people in Gaza, we hear from
a bakery in the territory that is struggling to keep up with the massive
demand for crucial supplies of bread.

But there is no doubt some online sellers deliberately trick customers
into buying smaller and often cheaper-to-produce items, Witcher said.
Common tactics include displaying products against a white background
rather than in room sets or on models, or photographing items with a
perspective that makes them appear bigger than they really are.
Dimensions can be hidden deep in the product description, or not
included at all…

<p>Xiaomi also has bad news for MIUI users who wish to unlock their
smartphones, saying they won’t get updated to HyperOS. “Previous
operating systems, such as MIUI 14, still retain the ability to unlock,
but users will no longer receive any Xiaomi HyperOS updates if they
leave their devices in an unlocked state,” the company told us. The
Chinese brand clarified in a follow-up email that HyperOS updates won’t
be available if you’ve unlocked your phone’s bootloader, regardless of
whether you’re on MIUI 14 or HyperOS. However, the company said you’ll
receive HyperOS updates if you choose to lock your device again. This
applies to all Xiaomi devices outside of China. I rarely say this, but
with this new “HyperOS” skin being the most blatant iOS ripoff I’ve ever
seen, just get an iPhone if you want that experience that badly.</p>

<h2 id="sanitize-html-and-svg">Sanitize HTML and SVG?</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-09, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
Sanitize HTML and SVG?
</h1>
<p>
Would you do it? Is “writing your own website” an activity that could be
described as “untrusted user generated content”? I get the feeling that
perhaps it is not! It is your site, you are writing the thing, so it’s
trusted. Your visitors need to trust you, too.
</p>
<p>
Now, in order for an attacker to hurt your visitors, they would need to
get access to the file system via the web server somehow.
</p>
<p>
Do you feel that the situation changes when there’s a service like
<a href="oddmu">Oddmu</a> that generates the HTML based on Markdown?
</p>
<p>
I guess the source remains the same, you’re writing the Markdown,
therefore the HTML, and so on. But now the attack surface is larger:
attackers can attack either the web server (the reverse proxy in front)
or the service itself (in the backend). I don’t run the service in a
“demilitarized zone” (DMZ) – what a word! – so there’s that.
</p>
<p>
The reason I’m wondering about all that is because I wonder whether I
need to sanitize the output of the Markdown to HTML conversion using a
library like
<a href="https://github.com/microcosm-cc/bluemonday">bluemonday</a>.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
bluemonday takes untrusted user generated content as an input, and will
return HTML that has been sanitised against an allowlist of approved
HTML elements and attributes so that you can safely include the content
in your web page.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Hm. Even if Oddmu is used by a group of people, I would still assume
that they trust each other. In such a context, there are no “untrusted
users”.
</p>
<p>
So why not take the easy route and just apply sanitization always? The
reason is that I sometimes (rarely!) include SVG in my Markdown, like in
<a href="2022-06-30_How_to_communicate_dungeon_maps_to_players">2022-06-30
How to communicate dungeon maps to players</a>.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday evening and this morning I spent a fair amount of time writing
code that adds SVG validation to a bluemonday policy. You can take a
look in
<a href="https://github.com/microcosm-cc/bluemonday/issues/196">issue
#196</a>. It’s awful. And I suspect that the specs will keep changing
over time and so I will keep running into issues. It would be much
easier to just drop it.

they all need to be the same (or nearly the same) except for content.

Online attack coincided with major military action, Mandiant says

<p>
Blackouts in Ukraine last year were not just caused by missile strikes
on the nation but also by a seemingly coordinated cyberattack on one of
its power plants. That’s according to Mandiant’s threat intel team,
which said Russia’s Sandworm crew was behind the two-pronged
power-outage and data-wiping attack.…

id="suspect-in-attack-on-nancy-pelosis-husband-goes-on-trial-in-san-francisco">Suspect
in Attack on Nancy Pelosi’s Husband Goes on Trial in San Francisco</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The man accused of breaking into former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s
San Francisco home, bludgeoning her husband with a hammer and seeking to
kidnap her goes on trial Thursday.</p>
<p>Opening statements are scheduled in the federal trial of David
DePape, who prosecutors say assaulted then-82-year-old Paul Pelosi,
sending shockwaves through the political world just days before last
year’s midterm elections.</p>
<p>The attack in the early hours of Oct. 28, 2022, also highlighted how
conspiracy theories and misinformation that spread online can fuel
political violence.</p>
<p>DePape pleaded not guilty to attempted kidnapping of a federal
official and assault on the immediate family member of a federal
official. Paul Pelosi is expected to testify next week.</p>
<p>DePape posted rants on a blog and an online forum about aliens,
communists, religious minorities and global elites. He questioned the
results of the 2020 election and echoed the baseless, right-wing QAnon
conspiracy theory that claims the U.S. government is run by a cabal of
devil-worshipping pedophiles.</p>
<p>The websites were taken down shortly after his arrest.</p>
<p>A Canadian citizen, DePape moved to the United States more than 20
years ago after falling in love with Gypsy Taub, a Berkeley pro-nudity
activist well-known in the Bay Area, his stepfather, Gene DePape said.
In recent years, David DePape had been homeless and struggling with drug
abuse and mental illness, Taub told local media.</p>
<p>Federal prosecutors say DePape smashed his shoulder through a glass
panel on a door in the back of the Pelosis’ Pacific Heights mansion and
confronted a sleeping Paul Pelosi, who was wearing boxer shorts and a
pajama top.</p>
<p>“Where’s Nancy? Where’s Nancy?” DePape asked, standing over Paul
Pelosi around 2 a.m. holding a hammer and zip ties, according to court
records. Nancy Pelosi was in Washington and under the protection of her
security detail, which does not extend to family members.</p>
<p>Paul Pelosi called 911 and two San Francisco Police officers showed
up and witnessed DePape strike Paul Pelosi in the head with a hammer,
knocking him unconscious, court records showed.</p>
<p>Nancy Pelosi’s husband of 60 years later underwent surgery to repair
a skull fracture and injuries to his right arm and hands.</p>
<p>After his arrest, DePape, 43, allegedly told a San Francisco
detective that he wanted to hold Nancy Pelosi hostage. He said that if
she told him the truth, he would let her go and if she lied, he was
going to “break her kneecaps” to show other members of Congress there
were “consequences to actions,” according to prosecutors.</p>
<p>A backpack DePape was carrying had tape and a rope, in addition to
zip ties, according to police.</p>
<p>The assault was captured on the officers’ body cameras. U.S. District
Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley ruled last month that the jury will be
allowed to see footage that shows Paul Pelosi in a pool of his own blood
struggling to breathe and the police officers trying to stop the
bleeding. Angela Chuang, one of DePape’s federal public defenders, had
argued that the shocking footage would be prejudicial to her client.</p>
<p>Corley also ruled jurors can listen to portions of a 5-minute call
DePape made in January to a television reporter in which he repeated
conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>“Freedom and liberty isn’t dying, it’s being killed systematically
and deliberately,” he said.</p>
<p>“The tree of liberty needs watering. He needs men of valor, patriots
willing to put their own lives on the line to stand in opposition to
tyranny,” he added.</p>
<p>Katherine Keneally, a senior researcher at the nonprofit Institute
for Strategic Dialogue, said the attack is an example of increasing
online hate, conspiracies and false narratives influencing political
violence.</p>
<p>“This didn’t occur in a vacuum,” Keneally said.</p>
<p>Keneally said people who commit such conspiracy-fueled acts of
violence often are struggling with mental health or other life crises,
such as the death of a family member or a divorce.</p>
<p>“I can’t think of a single case where someone engaged in violent
behavior where they were solely influenced by the conspiracy theory,”
she said.</p>
<p>DePape, who lived in a garage in the Bay Area city of Richmond and
had been doing odd carpentry jobs to support himself, allegedly told
authorities he had other targets, including a women’s and queer studies
professor, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, actor Tom Hanks and President
Joe Biden’s son Hunter.</p>
<p>One of those targets is included in the defense’s short witness list,
though their name has been redacted. The other possible witnesses are
DePape, Nancy Pelosi’s chief of staff Daniel Bernal, extremism and
antisemitism researcher Elizabeth Yates, and federal public defender
Catherine Goulet.</p>
<p>The prosecution’s list of potential witnesses contains 15 names,
including the surgeon who operated on Paul Pelosi, federal agents, San
Francisco police officers and several first responders.</p>
<p>If convicted, DePape faces life in prison. He was also charged in
state court with attempted murder, assault with a deadly weapon, elder
abuse, residential burglary and other felonies. He pleaded not guilty to
those charges. A state trial has not been scheduled.</p>

<h2 id="picassos-woman-with-a-watch-fetches-139m-at-auction">Picasso’s
‘Woman with a Watch’ Fetches $139M at Auction</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>One of Pablo Picasso’s masterpieces, Woman with a Watch, was sold at
auction Wednesday night for $139.3 million by Sotheby’s in New York, the
second-highest price ever achieved for the artist.</p>
<p>In a jam-packed room at the venerable auction house, it only took a
few minutes of telephone bidding for the 1932 painting depicting one of
the Spanish artist’s companions and muses, the French painter
Marie-Therese Walter, to be sold.</p>
<p>Femme a la montre had been valued at over $120 million before going
on the block, according to Sotheby’s.</p>
<p>It was part of the house’s special sale this week of the collection
of New York arts patron Emily Fisher Landau, who died this year at age
102.</p>
<p>Julian Dawes, Sotheby’s head of impressionist and modern art, called
the Picasso canvas – which hung in Landau’s living room – “a masterpiece
by every measure.”</p>
<p>“Painted in 1932 – Picasso’s ‘annus mirabilis’ – it is full of
joyful, passionate abandon yet at the same time it is utterly considered
and resolved,” he said.</p>
<p>Walter was regarded as Picasso’s “golden muse,” and features in
another of his works going under the hammer on Thursday at Christie’s:
Femme endormie, or Sleeping Woman, estimated to sell for $25 million-$35
million.</p>
<p>She also featured in Femme assise pres d’une fenetre (Marie-Therese),
or Woman Sitting Near a Window, which was sold in 2021 for $103.4
million.</p>
<p>Walter met Picasso in Paris in 1927, when she was just 17 and the
Spanish artist was still married to Russian-Ukrainian ballet dancer Olga
Khokhlova. The couple had a daughter, who died last year.</p>
<p>Another Picasso from 1932 was sold for $106 million in 2010.</p>
<p>The record sale for one of his works was of The Women of Algiers
(Version O), a 1955 oil painting which sold for $179.4 million.</p>
<p>When it went under the hammer at Christie’s New York in 2015, it was
also the record for any work of art sold at auction.</p>
<p>It was dethroned in November 2017 by the sale of Salvator Mundi
attributed to Leonardo da Vinci, which went for $450 million and holds
the record to this day.</p>
<p>Hot market</p>
<p>Fifty years after his death in 1973 at age 91, Picasso remains one of
the most influential artists of the modern world, often hailed as a
dynamic and creative genius.</p>
<p>But following the #MeToo movement against sexual harassment and
assault, his reputation has been tarnished by accusations he exerted a
violent hold over the women who shared his life and inspired his
art.</p>
<p>Sotheby’s has already netted $406 million in sales from Landau’s
collection, which also includes works by Jasper Johns, Willem de
Kooning, Mark Rothko and Andy Warhol.</p>
<p>Flags by the 93-year-old Johns sold for $41 million, while Securing
the Last Letter (Boss) by painter and photographer Ed Ruscha sold for
$39.4 million.</p>
<p>Auction houses are enjoying a healthy art and luxury goods market,
driven by China and showing no signs of a slowdown, said Kelsey Reed
Leonard, head of contemporary art sales at Sotheby’s.</p>
<p>Against a backdrop of wars in Ukraine and Gaza, as well as worldwide
inflation, the two titans of the sector – Sotheby’s and Christie’s –
will be moving a host of big-ticket lots in the autumn sales, though
they may still have a hard time topping last year, when total sales hit
a record $16 billion.</p>

id="judge-to-hear-arguments-as-michigan-activists-try-to-keep-trump-off-ballot">Judge
to Hear Arguments as Michigan Activists Try to Keep Trump Off
Ballot</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A judge in Michigan is expected to hear arguments Thursday on whether
Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson has the authority to keep Donald
Trump’s name off state ballots for president.</p>
<p>Activists are suing Benson in the Michigan Court of Claims to force
her to keep Trump’s name off ballots and to assess Trump’s
constitutional qualifications to serve a second term as president.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, attorneys for the former president are demanding that
Trump’s name be allowed on the 2024 Republican presidential primary
ballot.</p>
<p>Arguments were scheduled to begin Thursday morning in Grand Rapids
before Judge James Robert Redford.</p>
<p>Activists — in two separate suits — point to a section of the U.S.
Constitution’s 14th Amendment that prohibits a person from running for
federal office if they have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against
the U.S. or given aid or comfort to those who have.</p>
<p>Liberal groups also have filed lawsuits in Colorado and Minnesota to
bar Trump from the ballot, portraying him as the inciter of the January
6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, which was intended to stop Congress
from certifying Joe Biden’s 2020 presidential election win.</p>
<p>The groups cite a rarely used constitutional prohibition against
holding office for those who swore an oath to uphold the Constitution
but then “engaged in insurrection” against it. The two-sentence clause
in the 14th Amendment has been used only a handful of times since the
years after the Civil War.</p>
<p>The Minnesota Supreme Court on Wednesday dismissed a lawsuit citing
the provision. The court’s ruling said its decision applied only to the
state’s primary.</p>
<p>Free Speech For People, a group representing petitioners before the
Minnesota Supreme Court, also represents petitioners in one of the
Michigan cases against Benson.</p>
<p>Trump is considered the leading candidate for the 2024 Republican
presidential nomination.</p>
<p>Benson already has said in a filing that Michigan’s Legislature does
not give her the authority to determine whether a candidate for
president may be disqualified for the state ballot under the 14th
Amendment or to assess a candidate’s constitutional qualifications to
serve as president.</p>
<p>It’s a “federal constitutional question of enormous consequence”
whether Trump cannot appear as a presidential candidate on state
ballots, Benson wrote. “Michigan courts have held that administrative
agencies generally do not have the power to determine constitutional
questions.”</p>
<p>However, she added that she will follow the direction of the court
either way.</p>

Presidential Candidates Back Israel at Latest Debate</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Five Republicans hoping to be their party’s candidate in next year’s
U.S. presidential election debated Wednesday night, expressing support
for Israel in its war against Hamas, while clashing over China and
Russia.</p>
<p>Not appearing on the debate stage in Miami was Republican
front-runner Donald Trump, who is seeking to return to the White House
after losing the 2020 election.</p>
<p>Trump has not appeared at any of the three Republican debates, and
while holding his own rally nearby on Wednesday called the event with
his competitors “unwatchable.”</p>
<p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who appears a distant second place in
opinion polls, said Trump owes it to those watching the debates to
appear and “explain why he should get another chance” to be the party’s
nominee.</p>
<p>Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie pointed to Trump’s multiple
current and impending legal trials, saying, “Anybody who’s going to be
spending the next year and a half of their life focusing on keeping
themselves out of jail and courtrooms cannot lead this party.”</p>
<p>With Israel’s military response to an October attack by Hamas
militants in its second month, former U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki
Haley said Israel needs to “eliminate Hamas.”</p>
<p>“We need to be very clear-eyed to know there would be no Hamas
without Iran, there would be no Hezbollah without Iran, there would not
be the Houthis without Iran, and there wouldn’t be the Iranian militias
in Syria and Iraq that are trying to hit our military men and women, if
it hadn’t been for Iran,” Haley said.</p>
<p>Senator Tim Scott said he would tell Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, “not only do you have the responsibility and the right to
wipe Hamas off the map, we will support you.”</p>
<p>Republican candidates will next debate on Dec. 6.</p>
<p>Voters will begin selecting the party’s presidential nominee Jan. 15
with the Iowa caucuses, and after the state-by-state nominating contests
conclude, the Republican nominee will officially be named at the party’s
convention in July.</p>

id="takeaways-from-the-third-2024-republican-presidential-debate">Takeaways
From the Third 2024 Republican Presidential Debate</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Five candidates seeking to halt Donald Trump’s march toward the 2024
Republican presidential nomination gathered in Miami on Wednesday for
the party’s third debate while the former president held a separate
campaign rally across town.</p>
<p>Here are some takeaways from the debate:</p>
<p>Laying blame</p>
<p>One night after a stinging series of election losses at the hands of
Democrats, the candidates vented their frustrations on the debate
stage.</p>
<p>“I’m sick of Republicans losing,” Florida Governor Ron DeSantis
said.</p>
<p>DeSantis has long contrasted his successful reelection last year in
Florida with Republican setbacks in the last few elections, including
Trump’s loss in 2020. Earlier in the day, his campaign argued that
backing Trump cost candidates seats in races such as the one for
governor of Kentucky, where Republican Daniel Cameron lost to Democrat
Andy Beshear.</p>
<p>Republicans on Wednesday were also smarting from the success of a
ballot issue in Ohio that enshrined the right to an abortion in the
state constitution, as well as the loss of state legislative control in
Virginia.</p>
<p>Entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy blamed Ronna McDaniel, the chair of the
Republican National Committee, instead of Trump, for the party’s recent
performance.</p>
<p>“We’ve become a party of losers,” he lamented. “We have to have
accountability in our party.”</p>
<p>McDaniel was Trump’s hand-picked choice to lead the RNC in 2017, and
the committee was a sponsor of Wednesday’s debate.</p>
<p>Ramaswamy comes out swinging</p>
<p>It was clear from the outset that Ramaswamy, whose candidacy has
faded since the first debate, was determined to be a spoiler and throw
elbows in every direction.</p>
<p>Ramaswamy, a businessman with no political experience, attacked
former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley and DeSantis right out of the
gate.</p>
<p>In an exchange regarding the conflict in Israel, Ramaswamy warned
that the two leading candidates on the stage could drag America into a
bloody war in Europe, while also channeling speculation that DeSantis
wears lifts inside his boots.</p>
<p>“Do you want Dick Cheney in 3-inch heels? Because you’ve got two of
them on stage tonight,” he said in reference to Haley and DeSantis,
while invoking the Republican former vice president who was known for
his neoconservative views.</p>
<p>“They’re 5-inch heels, and I don’t wear them unless I can run in
them,” Haley later shot back. “They are not a fashion statement, they
are ammunition.”</p>
<p>Ramaswamy wasn’t finished going after Haley. During a discussion over
banning the Chinese short video app TikTok, he mentioned that Haley’s
daughter used the platform. “You might want to take care of your family
first,” he said.</p>
<p>“Leave my daughter out of your voice,” Haley countered, adding under
her breath, “You’re just scum.”</p>
<p>Given his lagging poll numbers, the Miami debate could end up being
Ramaswamy’s final one. Haley won’t miss him.</p>
<p>Haley and DeSantis go head-to-head on China</p>
<p>All eyes were on Haley and DeSantis, who were widely expected to go
after each other in a bid to establish themselves as the top challenger
to Trump in the Republican nominating contest.</p>
<p>After circling each other for half the debate, they finally went on
the attack over the other’s dealings with China.</p>
<p>Both said their opponent had cozied up to Chinese industry as
governors — Haley in South Carolina and DeSantis in Florida. Both,
unsurprisingly, disagreed, leading to a heated exchange.</p>
<p>While all candidates on the stage portray themselves as tough on
China, Haley has taken pains for months to establish herself as the top
China hawk in the field.</p>
<p>The DeSantis campaign, meanwhile, has tried to attack Haley on that
issue, accusing her of welcoming a Chinese company into her state.</p>

id="biden-administration-picks-maryland-for-new-fbi-headquarters">Biden
Administration Picks Maryland for New FBI Headquarters</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The Biden administration has chosen a Maryland location for a new FBI
headquarters, the General Services Administration confirmed Wednesday,
as the suburban Washington location was selected over nearby Virginia
following a sharp competition between the two states.</p>
<p>The site is planned for Greenbelt, about 20 kilometers northeast of
Washington.</p>
<p>“GSA looks forward to building the FBI a state-of-the-art
headquarters campus in Greenbelt to advance their critical mission for
years to come,” Robin Carnahan, the GSA administrator, said. “Thank you
to everyone at GSA, DOJ, FBI, Congress, and others who helped reach this
important milestone after a comprehensive, multi-year effort.”</p>
<p>The GSA also noted that Greenbelt was determined to be the best site
because it came at the lowest cost to taxpayers, provided the greatest
transportation access to FBI employees and visitors, and gave the
government the most certainty on a project delivery schedule.</p>
<p>Consideration for a new headquarters has been going on for more than
a decade, and in recent months the FBI has expressed concern about the
site selection process.</p>
<p>Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland said the location in his state
was ideal because of access to mass transit and because the cost to
taxpayers would be significantly less there.</p>
<p>“We’re very happy about this location. We’ve got a lot more work to
do,” Cardin said. The choice was first reported by The Washington
Post.</p>
<p>In a joint statement, Maryland’s elected leaders applauded the
decision and said their push to bring the FBI headquarters there was
“never about politics” and the new facility would meet a “dire,
longstanding need for a new consolidated headquarters.”</p>
<p>Democratic Maryland Gov. Wes Moore argued in recent months that
building it there would be fast, save taxpayers $1 billion and meet
equity goals raised by President Joe Biden, with a location in the
majority-Black Prince George’s County.</p>
<p>Most of Maryland’s congressional delegation and the governor
personally raised concerns to the GSA in March about the process,
including extra weight abruptly given in 2022 to proximity to the FBI
Academy in Quantico, Virginia.</p>
<p>News of the choice brought frustrated criticism from Virginia
leaders.</p>
<p>Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia told reporters he had not
been officially notified of the selection, but if true, “it would be
evidence of gross political interference in an established GSA process
that both states went through, and it would be frankly more reminiscent
of the tactics from the last administration.”</p>
<p>In a joint statement with Sen. Tim Kaine, he said he was disappointed
that the “clear case” for Virginia, home to the FBI Academy, was set
aside.</p>
<p>Virginia leaders, including Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, argued
that along with the academy the state has also welcomed Amazon and other
big companies in recent years.</p>
<p>In July, the GSA announced changes in criteria for choosing the new
location, boosting two potential places in Maryland. The new criteria
raised the weight given to cost and social equity concerns to 20% each
and reduced proximity to the FBI Academy to 25%, down from 35%.</p>
<p>Plans to replace the FBI’s roughly five-decade-old J. Edgar Hoover
Building, where nets surround the facility to protect pedestrians from
falling debris, have been under discussion for 15 years. Momentum
stalled at one point while Donald Trump was president, with discussion
centering on rebuilding on the existing site in Washington.</p>
<p>Two other finalists were Springfield, Virginia, and Landover,
Maryland. About 7,500 jobs are connected to the facility</p>

<p style>
Tonight, at approximately seven feet above sea level, the five leading
Republican presidential candidates not named Trump assembled in a
performing arts center in Miami to once again go through the motions of
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/24/politics/gop-debate-trump-surrender-analysis/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pretending
this is a normal election cycle</a>.
</p>
<p style>
If you happened to be doing something else with your finite mortal hours
on Wednesday evening, though, you didn’t miss much. Entrepreneur Vivek
Ramaswamy made every effort to maintain his status as the group’s enfant
terrible with obnoxious barbs that didn’t even spare the moderators;
Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina managed to use a Bible verse to talk
about the economy; and former Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey
reminded the American people that, yes, he is still here.
</p>
<p style>
The debate finally gained a bit of a pulse, however, during a brief
rematch between Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida and former U.N.
Ambassador Nikki Haley over DeSantis’ fracking record. During the
previous debate in September (yes, Wednesday’s was the <em>third
</em>Republican debate so far), Haley had blasted DeSantis for being
“against fracking” and “against drilling.” DeSantis protested — although
a fact check showed
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/ron-desantis-fracking-florida-debate-nikki-haley" target="_self">Haley
kind of had a point</a>, seeing as the governor signed an executive
order telling his state officials to “take necessary actions to
adamantly oppose” fracking and offshore drilling on his second day in
office.
</p>
<p style>
On Wednesday, Haley started in again. “It cracks me up that Ron
continues to do this: He has opposed fracking, he’s opposed drilling,”
she said. Then she went for the jugular: “He was praised by the Sierra
Club,” she slammed. “You’re trying to make up for it and act like you
weren’t a liberal when it comes to the environment — but you are, you
always have been. Just own it if that’s the case, but don’t keep saying
you’re something that you’re not.”

DeSantis protested the use of the E-word (not to mention the L-word) was
unfair. “We are <em>absolutely</em> going to frack,” he insisted, though
you could see a flicker of
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/ron-desantis-environment-climate-change" target="_blank">his
old green moderateness</a> when he added, “I don’t think it’s a good
idea to drill in the Florida Everglades and I know most Floridians agree
with me.” The end of his sentence was drowned out, however, by Haley
saying loudly into her mic, “<em>YOU BANNED FRACKING</em>.”
</p>
<p style>
As was the case the last time around, Haley and DeSantis’ back-and-forth
just goes to show “the [Republican] Party’s utter confusion about how to
handle environmental issues,” as <em>Heatmap</em>’s Robinson Meyer
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/ron-desantis-fracking-florida-debate-nikki-haley" target="_self">has
written</a>. On the one hand, the conversation around environmental
protections and the green transition has advanced to the point that even
the GOP debates
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/even-a-republican-debate-has-to-cover-climate-change-in-2023" target="_self">can’t
ignore climate change</a> (or,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/second-gop-debate-climate-energy" target="_self">at
least not entirely</a>); Trump himself will
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-ranted-about-heat-pumps-evs-and-water-with-tucker-carlson" target="_self">allow
that hybrid cars are “pretty good”</a> during his rants about electric
vehicles. On the other hand, smearing DeSantis as a “liberal
environmentalist” who allegedly hates fracking is still perceived to be
damaging enough in a Republican primary that Haley used her limited
minutes in front of the approximately 17 American viewers who tuned in
on Wednesday night to try, once more, to get it to stick.
</p>
<p style>
Only time will tell if such a barb can harm DeSantis (who, for his part,
continually insists
<a href="https://x.com/RonDeSantis/status/1722460159170023452?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he
welcomes</a> barbs, as well as arrows, hits, and presumably other
assorted forms of torment). Then again, the whole thing might be moot.
In the next century, the waves of Biscayne Bay could very well

lapping at the stage</a> where, once upon a time, five Republican
presidential hopefuls had futilely name-called, hand-wrung, and
<a href="https://x.com/therecount/status/1722424721881399700?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">heel-shamed</a>.

are not enough for some tasks. I occasionally need to generate some

means swapping to the disk. Not only swapping is not ideal for a SSD but
it also greatly slows things down.</p>

Court Dismisses ‘Insurrection Clause’ Challenge, Allows Trump on
Ballot</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump will stay on the Minnesota primary
ballot after the state supreme court Wednesday dismissed a lawsuit
seeking to end his candidacy under a rarely used constitutional
provision that forbids those who “engaged in insurrection” from holding
office.</p>
<p>The Minnesota Supreme Court declined to become the first in history
to use Section 3 of the 14th Amendment to prevent someone from running
for the presidency. The court dodged the central question of the lawsuit
— does Trump’s role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol
disqualify him from the presidency — by ruling that state law allows
parties to put whomever they want on the primary ballot.</p>
<p>“There is no state statute that prohibits a major political party
from placing on the presidential nomination primary ballot, or sending
delegates to the national convention supporting, a candidate who is
ineligible to hold office,” Chief Justice Natalie Hudson ruled.</p>
<p>The court left open the possibility that plaintiffs could try again
to knock Trump off the general election ballot in November. The
Minnesota challenge was filed by the liberal group Free Speech For
People, which said it will continue its campaign to end Trump’s
presidential bid.</p>
<p>“We are disappointed by the court’s decision,” said the group’s legal
director Ron Fein, who argued before the court at its Nov. 2 hearing on
the case. “However, the Minnesota Supreme Court explicitly recognized
that the question of Donald Trump’s disqualification for engaging in
insurrection against the U.S. Constitution may be resolved at a later
stage. The decision isn’t binding on any court outside Minnesota, and we
continue our current and planned legal actions in other states to
enforce Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment against Donald Trump.”</p>
<p>The ruling is the first from a series of lawsuits filed by Free
Speech For People and a second liberal group that are seeking to use
Section 3 to end the candidacy of the front-runner in the Republican
presidential primary.</p>
<p>On his social media platform, Truth Social, Trump said: “Ridiculous
14th Amendment lawsuit just thrown out by Minnesota Supreme Court.” He
added, “Congratulations to all who fought this HOAX!”</p>
<p>The provision at issue bars from office anyone who swore an oath to
the Constitution and then “engaged in insurrection” against it. It was
mainly used to prevent former confederates from taking over state and
federal government positions after the Civil War.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs in the cases contend that Section 3 is simply another
qualification for the presidency, just like the Constitution’s
requirement that a president be at least 35 years old. They filed in
Minnesota because the state has a quick process to challenge ballot
qualifications, with the case heard directly by the state’s highest
court.</p>
<p>Trump’s attorneys argued that Section 3 has no power without Congress
laying out the criteria and procedures for applying it, that the Jan. 6
attack doesn’t meet the definition of insurrection and that the former
president was simply using his free speech rights. They also argued that
the clause doesn’t apply to the office of the presidency, which is not
mentioned in the text.</p>
<p>Parallel cases are being heard in other states, including Colorado,
where a state judge has scheduled closing arguments for next week.</p>
<p>Many legal experts expect the issue to eventually reach the U.S.
Supreme Court, which has never ruled on Section 3.</p>
<p>Secretaries of state have generally said they don’t have the power to
determine whether Trump should not be on the ballot and have sought
guidance from courts.</p>

id="striking-actors-reach-tentative-deal-with-hollywood-studios">Striking
Actors Reach Tentative Deal With Hollywood Studios</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The SAG-AFTRA actors’ union reached a tentative agreement with
Hollywood studios to resolve the second of two strikes that rocked the
entertainment industry as workers demanded higher pay in the streaming
TV era, the union said Wednesday.</p>
<p>The 118-day strike will end officially just after midnight, SAG-AFTRA
said in a statement. The group’s national board will consider the deal
on Friday, and the union said it would release further details after
that meeting.</p>
<p>Members of SAG-AFTRA walked off the job in mid-July asking for an
increase in minimum salaries, a share of streaming service revenue and
protection from being replaced by “digital replicas” generated by
artificial intelligence (AI).</p>
<p>The union said negotiators had reached a preliminary deal on a new
contract with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers
(AMPTP), which represents Walt Disney DIS.N, Netflix NFLX.O and other
media companies.</p>
<p>An AMPTP representative did not immediately respond to a request for
comment.</p>
<p>The breakthrough means Hollywood can ramp up to full production for
the first time since May, once union members vote to ratify the deal in
the coming weeks.</p>
<p>“I’m relieved,” actor Fanny Grande said in an interview. “It’s been
really difficult for most people in the industry, especially people of
color. As it is, we don’t have as many opportunities. We aren’t big
celebrities that have money in the bank for months. I just really hope
that it’s a fair deal.”</p>
<p>Actors had similar concerns to film and television writers, who
argued that compensation for working-class cast members had dwindled as
streaming took hold, making it hard to earn a living wage in cities such
as Los Angeles and New York. TV series on streaming did not offer the
same residual payments that actors enjoyed during the heyday of
broadcast TV.</p>
<p>Performers also became alarmed by recent advances in artificial
intelligence, which they feared could lead to studios manipulating their
likenesses without permission or replacing human actors with digital
images.</p>
<p>George Clooney and other A-list stars voiced solidarity with
lower-level actors and had urged union leadership, including SAG-AFTRA
President and The Nanny actor Fran Drescher, to reach a resolution.</p>
<p>Many film and TV sets shut down when the Writers Guild of America
(WGA) called a strike in the spring. While WGA members returned to
writing scripts in late September, the ongoing SAG-AFTRA work stoppage
left many productions dark.</p>
<p>The disruptions cost California more than $6 billion in lost output,
according to a Milken Institute estimate.</p>
<p>With little work available, many prop masters, costume designers and
other crew members struggled to make ends meet. FilmLA, the group that
approves filming permits, reported scripted production during the week
of Oct. 29 had fallen 77% from the same time a year earlier.</p>
<p>The Hollywood strikes came during a year of other high-profile job
actions. The United Auto Workers recently ended six weeks of walkouts at
Detroit carmakers. Teachers, nurses and healthcare workers also walked
off the job.</p>
<p>Hollywood’s work stoppages forced broadcast networks to fill their
fall lineups with re-runs, games shows and reality shows. It also led
movie studios to delay big releases such as Dune: Part 2 because
striking actors could not promote them.</p>
<p>Other major films, including the latest installment of the Mission:
Impossible franchise and Disney’s live-action remake of animated classic
Snow White, were postponed until 2025.</p>

<p>I cannot pinpoint the source of this misconception, it could have
been a vendor, or long-lost blog post, or one of the many webinars I
attended in my early days as a program lead. Regardless of the source, I
operated under the wild misconception that all I needed to do was train
my teams to do accessibility. Developers, QAs, designers, all they
needed was training! This model does not work. Especially for an
organization with multiple products, multiple platforms, and multiple
development teams. Accessibility is so much more complicated than can be
summarised in a mere training. It requires experts, capable programmers,
users who actually require said accessbility, and so much more. It’s
also an ongoing process – it’s not a static “train once, use everywhere”
kind of deal.</p>

<p>Wednesday’s debate will be broadcast live from the Adrienne Arsht
Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County from 8 to 10 p.m.
Eastern time on NBC News and Rumble, a  livestreaming platform.</p>
<p>Since the first Republican debate in Milwaukee more than two months
ago, former Vice President Mike Pence has left the race and former
Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson and Governor Doug Burgum of North
Dakota have been swept aside, having raised too little money to qualify
for Wednesday night’s forum.</p>
<p>Those still in contention — and willing to show up to the debate —
are Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, biotech businessman Vivek Ramaswamy,
former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, former New Jersey Governor Chris
Christie and U.S. Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina.</p>
<p>Here’s what to know about the candidates’ positions on key issues
that are likely to come up.</p>
<p>Foreign policy</p>
<p>There are two competing approaches to foreign policy to look for
tonight: hawkish neoconservativism from Haley and isolationism — Trump’s
brand of diplomacy that Ramaswamy and DeSantis seem to be mimicking.</p>
<p>Haley sees military aid to Israel and Ukraine as crucial to
preserving Western interests abroad. Scott and Christie agree that
helping Israel and Ukraine in their war efforts is crucial.</p>
<p>Ramaswamy, on the other hand, wants out of what he calls “no-win
wars” and recently said the U.S.’s job is not “to be the global police.”
To Ramaswamy, successful foreign policy means cutting off many U.S.
allies from support.</p>
<p>DeSantis has similarly argued that helping Ukraine’s counteroffensive
is not a priority, echoing Trump’s controversial “America first”
stance.</p>
<p>Super political action committees for Haley and DeSantis have
repeatedly aired campaign ads accusing each other of being too easy on
China. Those ads leveled claims that fact-checkers have called into
doubt, including that Haley allowed a Chinese corporation to “get
dangerously close” to a U.S. Army base and another that “DeSantis voted
to fast-track” Obama-era trade deals with China.</p>
<p>Expect Haley and DeSantis to defend themselves and spar over their
views on China and more.</p>
<p>Abortion</p>
<p>Progressives made inroads in state-level elections Tuesday in winning
back abortion rights, which the U.S. Supreme Court returned to the
states’ purview when it struck down Roe v. Wade in June 2022. Some
states have greatly restricted abortion rights since then.</p>
<p>The Republican candidates differ in their views on abortion.</p>
<p>Haley, DeSantis and Scott would sign a nationwide ban on abortions
after 15 weeks. They haven’t said whether they would allow exceptions in
instances of rape or incest or when a pregnancy could be fatal.</p>
<p>Ramaswamy and Christie, while both personally against abortions, have
said that they would not support a federal ban, citing the 10th
Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which some legal scholars say gives
decision-making authority over abortion bans to the states.</p>
<p>Ramaswamy has advocated for six-week abortion bans at the state level
but said he wouldn’t use executive authority to impose them.</p>
<p>Both Ramaswamy and Christie support exceptions in instances of rape
or incest or when a pregnancy could be fatal.</p>
<p>As governor of Florida, DeSantis helped outlaw mifepristone, a
hormone-blocking drug that is used in medication abortions. Haley has
said the legality of mifepristone should be decided by elected officials
at the state level.</p>
<p>Ramaswamy, Christie and Scott haven’t elaborated their positions on
mifepristone.</p>
<p>Immigration</p>
<p>Ramaswamy, himself the child of immigrants, has perhaps the harshest
policies on immigration. He has said that he would deport every
undocumented immigrant and deploy the military at the southern U.S.
border to halt any more mass crossings.</p>
<p>Haley has said she would make it more difficult for undocumented
immigrants to find jobs and that immigration officials should carry out
deportations.</p>
<p>DeSantis has said he would deport undocumented immigrants,
particularly those who overstay their visas or are found guilty of
crimes. In Florida, he clamped down on undocumented immigration.</p>
<p>Scott has supported bringing back Title 42, which forces out migrants
without any legal proceedings, but hasn’t said whether he would deport
undocumented immigrants.</p>
<p>Christie has supported mass deportations, and as governor of New
Jersey he rejected a national program that helped immigrants find new
beginnings in his state.</p>
<p>Haley, Scott and Christie are against breaking up families.</p>
<p>Ramaswamy, DeSantis and Haley are against birthright citizenship.</p>
<p>Trump</p>
<p>New polling from The New York Times and Siena College shows that
Trump is beating President Joe Biden in five of six battleground states.
Analysts say that should worry Trump’s party rivals, who all trail him
by some distance.</p>
<p>But not all are so sure of Trump’s campaign.</p>
<p>Christie has made a name for himself among the Republican candidates
as Trump’s harshest critic, claiming that Trump’s legal battles will
make it harder to beat Biden as the primaries approach.</p>
<p>Haley has likewise called Trump’s trials “a distraction” from the
larger goal of getting a Republican in the White House.</p>
<p>Haley blasted Trump for being too cozy with authoritarian leaders, in
a recent meeting with the Republican Jewish Coalition, which is a
co-sponsor of tonight’s debate. Trump has a record of praising dictators
such as North Korea’s Kim Jong Un and Russia’s Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p>DeSantis also has said that Trump “views everything from the lens of
him,” referring to how Trump’s legal dramas may have clouded his
message.</p>
<p>Scott recently said that Trump isn’t electable in 2024. “I don’t
think he can win,” Scott said in late October. “You have to be able to
win in Georgia. I don’t think he can win in Georgia.”</p>
<p>Of all the contenders, Ramaswamy has been the least critical of
Trump.</p>
<p>As Haley and DeSantis vie for second place, expect them to make their
cases for why Republican voters should want them over Trump.</p>
<p>Climate</p>
<p>DeSantis hasn’t said whether he thinks human activity is the main
cause of climate change. Haley, Christie and Scott, however, have.
Ramaswamy has said that human activity causing climate change is
probable but has never expressed certainty.</p>
<p>Ramaswamy and Scott have publicly doubted that climate change is
making natural disasters more lethal, with Ramaswamy having said at the
first Republican debate that “the climate change agenda is a hoax.”</p>
<p>All the candidates who will take the stage at tonight’s debate have
said that the market is better suited than the government to handle
climate change.</p>
<p>DeSantis, Haley, Ramaswamy and Scott are opposed to rebate programs
for drivers of clean-energy vehicles. Christie hasn’t given his position
on tax credits yet.</p>
<p>If the impacts of climate change come up, expect Ramaswamy to be the
most vocal denier as in previous debates.</p>
<p>Guns</p>
<p>All the candidates who will appear at tonight’s debate are against
restricting access to firearms for those who might pose threats to
themselves or others. They also oppose expanding background checks,
except for Ramaswamy, who hasn’t yet made his opinions on that
known.</p>
<p>Of all the topics that might come up tonight, what to do — or not to
do — about gun violence will likely be among the least contentious for
the candidates, who broadly see eye to eye on the Second Amendment right
to keep and bear arms.</p>
