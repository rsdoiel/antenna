## Excerpts from The Believer: Inside Out

date: 2025-01-24, from: McSweeney's Internet Tendency

<p><img src="https://edge.mcsw.net/mcsweeneys/yae2mwre18rcu785d5t0o0ptobm1" alt="" /><br /> <i>With stable employment exceedingly difficult to come by, intellectually disabled adults have another, occasionally lucrative, way of participating in American society: they can become artists.</i></p> <div class='break'>- - -</div><p>On a Monday morning in early June, Nicole Storm arrived at the Creative Growth Art Center in downtown Oakland, California. Light poured in through broad windows that faced the street. Nicole put her jacket and lunch away in the closet and then selected a large piece of cardboard from a stack in a hallway. A staff member helped her secure the makeshift canvas to an easel and set out her paints and markers. She chatted with some fellow artists and then explained to me that she is starting a new project, after having finished a few paintings last week. Nicole refers to her artistic process as “taking notes.” It is a way for her to organize the events of a day, although the results never look like a typical archive or journal. She creates bright washes of color that provide a glowing background for lines and shapes that appear like an indeterminate form of writing. Nicole records what is going on around her with marks that may initially seem impulsive and spontaneous. But they are the culmination of a well-honed practice, undeniable creativity, and decades of sustained work.</p> <p>Nicole was born in 1967, during what her mother, Diane, refers to as “the tail end of the Dark Ages,” when someone like Nicole, who has Down syndrome, would almost certainly have lived her entire life in an institution. At that time, Diane recalls, “I sent away for some information about Down syndrome and what I got was bleak. The life expectancy was twelve years. Fifty percent of people were dead before their fifth birthday. So I threw that stuff in the trash and decided to do it my way.”</p> <p>Diane and Nicole are closer than most mothers and their adult daughters. They live together, and Diane volunteers once a week at Creative Growth when Nicole is there. Nicole inherited Diane’s round face and direct stare. They both speak with a great deal of confidence. Diane attributes Nicole’s confidence to how she “ran with the pack” as a kid; she was thrown into the deep end of progressive schools that included her with the rest of the students. Diane’s confidence developed out of her fierce advocacy for Nicole and a lifetime of fighting with bureaucratic systems that did little more than tell her what her daughter would not be able to do. I mentioned to Diane that my daughter, like Nicole, has Down syndrome. “You know how it goes then,” she said. “We had no support when she was growing up, but I’m sure your daughter has a bright future.”</p> <p>Diane is right. My daughter is part of a generation with more opportunities to attend school with her peers, although she still faces plenty of challenges. I hope she might be able to find a job and work in a supportive community. But historically our society has expected very little of people with intellectual disabilities, which makes Nicole’s success as an artist all the more remarkable.</p> <p>When Nicole was in her twenties, Diane searched for a day program that Nicole could attend while she worked full-time. But they struggled to find a suitable situation that met Nicole’s need for routine and predictability. She spent most of her days on public transportation. Diane recalled a time when Nicole traveled with a group to an event at a library in Berkeley, only to have to catch another bus fifteen minutes later to come back home. Eventually Nicole moved into a group home for people with disabilities, where she lived in an apartment with the help of support staff. Both Nicole and Diane believed this was the independence Nicole deserved. But after two and a half years, she wasn’t thriving. Nicole wasn’t developing much of a life outside her apartment, and the support staff wasn’t as attentive as Diane had expected. After Nicole became seriously ill with pneumonia, they decided they had had enough. Nicole went back to living with Diane. An artist friend told them about Creative Growth, and Nicole started attending the program regularly. The new sense of routine and purpose transformed her almost overnight.</p> <p>“It was the most wonderful moment,” Nicole remembered.</p> <p>“You’re right,” said Diane. “That’s when the magic started to happen.”</p> <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://edge.mcsw.net/mcsweeneys/u8cbia3zca0uryw2by7sk271jsr9" alt="" /><br /> <i><small>Installation view of Nicole Storm’s exhibit at White Columns, New York, 2021.</small></i></p> <div class='break'>- - -</div><p style="text-align:center;"><i>Read the rest over at </i> <a href="https://www.thebeliever.net/inside-out/">The Believer</a>.</p>

## Should you write differently for LLMs?

date: 2025-01-24, from: Blog by Fabrizio Ferri-Benedetti

<p>Writing for LLMs is the new SEO obsession. Not a day passes without seeing some question popping up in tech writing communities about how to best compose content for AI scrapers. Folks even wonder if a different style guide should be necessary, or whether tables should be avoided because they’ve seen <a href="https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/WSL/pull/2021#issuecomment-2546627586">a pull request</a> rejected in a Microsoft repository on the silliest grounds.</p>

## Anthropic's new Citations API

date: 2025-01-24, updated: 2025-01-24, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p>Here's a new API-only feature from Anthropic that requires quite a bit of assembly in order to unlock the value: <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/introducing-citations-api">Introducing Citations on the Anthropic API</a>. Let's talk about what this is and why it's interesting.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/24/anthropics-new-citations-api/#citations-for-rag">Citations for Retrieval Augmented Generation</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/24/anthropics-new-citations-api/#trying-out-the-new-api-with-uv-run">Trying out the new API with uv run</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/24/anthropics-new-citations-api/#rendering-the-citations">Rendering the citations</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/24/anthropics-new-citations-api/#now-i-need-to-design-an-abstraction-layer-for-llm">Now I need to design an abstraction layer for LLM</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/24/anthropics-new-citations-api/#anthropic-s-strategy-contrasted-with-openai">Anthropic's strategy contrasted with OpenAI</a></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="citations-for-rag">Citations for Retrieval Augmented Generation</h4>

<p>The core of the <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/rag/">Retrieval Augmented Generation</a> (RAG) pattern is to take a user's question, retrieve portions of documents that might be relevant to that question and then answer the question by including those text fragments in the context provided to the LLM.</p>
<p>This usually works well, but there is still a risk that the model may answer based on other information from its training data (sometimes OK) or hallucinate entirely incorrect details (definitely bad).</p>
<p>The <em>best</em> way to help mitigate these risks is to support the answer with citations that incorporate direct quotations from the underlying source documents. This even acts as a form of fact-checking: the user can confirm that the quoted text did indeed come from those documents, helping provide relatively robust protection against hallucinated details resulting in incorrect answers.</p>
<p>Actually building a system that does this can be quite tricky. Matt Yeung described a pattern for this he called <a href="https://mattyyeung.github.io/deterministic-quoting">Deterministic Quoting</a> last April, where answers are accompanied by direct quotations from the source documents that are guaranteed to be copied across and not lossily transformed by the model.</p>
<p>This is a great idea, but actually building it requires some quite sophisticated prompt engineering and complex implementation code.</p>
<p>Claude's new <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/citations">Citations API</a> mechanism handles the difficult parts of this for you. You still need to implement most of RAG - identifying potentially relevant documents, then feeding that content in as part of the prompt - but Claude's API will then do the difficult work of extracting relevant citations and including them in the response that it sends back to you.</p>
<h4 id="trying-out-the-new-api-with-uv-run">Trying out the new API with uv run</h4>
<p>I tried the API out using Anthropic's Python client library, which was <a href="https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python/commit/67aa83e5d589f6afad5fbc8bd2e616cc71a80a29">just updated</a> to support the citations API.</p>
<p>I ran a scratch Python 3.13 interpreter with that package using <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/">uv run</a> like this (after first setting the necessary <code>ANTHROPIC_API_KEY</code> environment variable using <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/help.html#llm-keys-get-help">llm keys get</a>):</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre><span class="pl-k">export</span> ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span><span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">$(</span>llm keys get claude<span class="pl-pds">)</span></span><span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>
uv run --with anthropic --python 3.13 python</pre></div>
<p>Python 3.13 has <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.13.html#a-better-interactive-interpreter">a nicer interactive interpreter</a> which you can more easily paste code into. Using <code>uv run</code> like this gives me an environment with that package pre-installed without me needing to setup a virtual environment as a separate step.</p>
<p>Then I ran the following code, adapted from <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/citations">Anthropic's example</a>. The <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/9fbb3c2e2c40c181727e497e358fd7ce">text.txt Gist</a> contains text I copied out from my <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/31/llms-in-2024/">Things we learned about LLMs in 2024</a> post.</p>

<p>This format is pretty interesting! It's the standard Claude format but those <code>"content"</code> blocks now include an optional additional <code>"citations"</code> key which contains a list of relevant citation extracts that support the claim in the <code>"text"</code> block.</p>
<h4 id="rendering-the-citations">Rendering the citations</h4>
<p>Eyeballing the JSON output wasn't particularly fun. I wanted a very quick tool to help me see that output in a more visual way.</p>
<p>A trick I've been using a lot recently is that LLMs like Claude are <em>really</em> good at writing code to turn arbitrary JSON shapes like this into a more human-readable format.</p>
<p>I fired up my <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/19/one-shot-python-tools/#custom-instructions">Artifacts project</a>, pasted in the above JSON and prompted it like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Build a tool where I can paste JSON like this into a textarea and the result will be rendered in a neat way - it should should intersperse text with citations, where each citation has the cited_text rendered in a blockquote</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It helped me <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/render-claude-citations">build this tool</a> (<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/85bd050908486de36b078c8c7d01e903">follow-up prompt here</a>), which lets you paste in JSON and produces a rendered version of the text:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/render-citations-artifact.jpg" alt="Render Claude Citations tool. Paste a JSON response from Claude below to render it with citations. JSON is shown, then a Render Message button, then an iframe containing the rendered text." style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
<h4 id="now-i-need-to-design-an-abstraction-layer-for-llm">Now I need to design an abstraction layer for LLM</h4>
<p>I'd like to upgrade my <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a> tool and <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-claude-3">llm-claude-3</a> plugin to include support for this new feature... but doing so is going to be relatively non-trivial.</p>
<p>The problem is that LLM currently bakes in an assumption that all LLMs respond with a stream of text.</p>
<p>With citations, this is no longer true! Claude is now returning chunks of text that aren't just a plain string - they are annotated with citations, which need to be stored and processed somehow by the LLM library.</p>
<p>This isn't the only edge-case of this type. DeepSeek recently released their Reasoner API which has a similar problem: it can return two different types of text, one showing reasoning text and one showing final content. I <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/a5ca117dd0325c93a5b1f5a18c4a9e34">described those differences here</a>.</p>
<p>I've opened a design issue to tackle this challenge in the LLM repository: <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/716">Design an abstraction for responses that are not just a stream of text</a>.</p>
<h4 id="anthropic-s-strategy-contrasted-with-openai">Anthropic's strategy contrasted with OpenAI</h4>
<p>Another interesting aspect of this release is how it helps illustrate a strategic difference between Anthropic and OpenAI.</p>
<p>OpenAI are increasingly behaving like a consumer products company. They just made a big splash with their <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/23/introducing-operator/">Operator</a> browser-automation agent system - a much more polished, consumer-product version of Anthropic's own <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/23/introducing-operator/">Computer Use</a> demo from a few months ago.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Anthropic are clearly focused much more on the developer / "enterprise" market. This Citations feature is API-only and directly addresses a specific need that developers trying to build reliable RAG systems on top of their platform may not even have realized they had.</p>

## Quoting Dustin Ewers

date: 2025-01-24, updated: 2025-01-24, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<blockquote cite="https://dustinewers.com/ignore-the-grifters/"><p>AI tools create a significant productivity boost for developers. Different folks report different gains, but most people who try AI code generation recognize its ability to increase velocity. Many people think that means we’re going to need fewer developers, and our industry is going to slowly circle the drain.</p>
<p>This view is based on a misunderstanding of why people pay for software. A business creates software because they think that it will give them some sort of economic advantage. The investment needs to pay for itself with interest. There are many software projects that would help a business, but businesses aren’t going to do them because the return on investment doesn’t make sense.</p>
<p>When software development becomes more efficient, the ROI of any given software project increases, which unlocks more projects. [...] Cheaper software means people are going to want more of it. More software means more jobs for increasingly efficient software developers.</p></blockquote>

## Introducing Operator

date: 2025-01-23, updated: 2025-01-23, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-operator/">Introducing Operator</a></strong></p>
OpenAI released their "research preview" today of Operator, a cloud-based browser automation platform rolling out today to $200/month ChatGPT Pro subscribers.</p>
<p>They're calling this their first "agent". In the Operator announcement video Sam Altman defined that <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/31/llms-in-2024/#-agents-still-haven-t-really-happened-yet">notoriously vague term</a> like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>AI agents are AI systems that can do work for you independently. You give them a task and they go off and do it.</p>
<p>We think this is going to be a big trend in AI and really impact the work people can do, how productive they can be, how creative they can be, what they can accomplish.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Operator interface looks very similar to Anthropic's <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/22/computer-use/">Claude Computer Use</a> demo from October, even down to the interface with a chat panel on the left and a visible interface being interacted with on the right. Here's Operator:</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of Operator. The user has asked the chat window to book a table at a restauraunt. The OpenTable website is visible on the right." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/operator-1.jpg" /></p>
<p>And here's Claude Computer Use:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/computer-use-sudoku.jpg" alt="A Sudoku puzzle is displayed - the bot has already filled in several squares incorrectly with invalid numbers which have a subtle pink background." style="max-width: 100%;"></p>
<p>Claude Computer Use required you to run a own Docker container on your own hardware. Operator is much more of a product - OpenAI host a Chrome instance for you in the cloud, providing access to the tool via their website.</p>
<p>Operator runs on top of a brand new model that OpenAI are calling CUA, for Computer-Using Agent. Here's <a href="https://openai.com/index/computer-using-agent/">their separate announcement</a> covering that new model, which should also be available via their API in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>This demo version of Operator is understandably cautious: it frequently asked users for confirmation to continue. It also provides a "take control" option which OpenAI's demo team used to take over and enter credit card details to make a final purchase.</p>
<p>The million dollar question around this concerns how they deal with security. Claude Computer Use <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/25/zombais/">fell victim to prompt injection attack at the first hurdle</a>.</p>
<p>Here's what <a href="https://openai.com/index/computer-using-agent/#safety">OpenAI have to say about that</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One particularly important category of model mistakes is <strong>adversarial attacks on websites</strong> that cause the CUA model to take unintended actions, through prompt injections, jailbreaks, and phishing attempts. In addition to the aforementioned mitigations against model mistakes, we developed several additional layers of defense to protect against these risks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cautious navigation:</strong> The CUA model is designed to identify and ignore prompt injections on websites, recognizing all but one case from an early internal red-teaming session.</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> In Operator, we've implemented an additional model to monitor and pause execution if it detects suspicious content on the screen.</li>
<li><strong>Detection pipeline:</strong> We're applying both automated detection and human review pipelines to identify suspicious access patterns that can be flagged and rapidly added to the monitor (in a matter of hours).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Color me skeptical. I imagine we'll see all kinds of novel successful prompt injection style attacks against this model once the rest of the world starts to explore it.</p>
<p>My initial recommendation: start a fresh session for each task you outsource to Operator to ensure it doesn't have access to your credentials for any sites that you have used via the tool in the past. If you're having it spend money on your behalf let it get to the checkout, then provide it with your payment details and wipe the session straight afterwards.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://cdn.openai.com/operator_system_card.pdf">Operator System Card PDF</a> has some interesting additional details. From the "limitations" section:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Despite proactive testing and mitigation efforts, certain challenges and risks remain due to the difficulty of modeling the complexity of real-world scenarios and the dynamic nature of adversarial threats. Operator may encounter novel use cases post-deployment and exhibit different patterns of errors or model mistakes. Additionally, we expect that adversaries will craft novel prompt injection attacks and jailbreaks. Although we’ve deployed multiple mitigation layers, many rely on machine learning models, and with adversarial robustness still an open research problem, defending against emerging attacks remains an ongoing challenge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Plus this interesting note on the CUA model's limitations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The CUA model is still in its early stages. It performs best on short, repeatable tasks but faces challenges with more complex tasks and environments like slideshows and calendars.</p>
</blockquote>

## Faculty Fight Night

date: 2025-01-23, from: McSweeney's Internet Tendency

<p>To: Department of English<br /> Re: Faculty Fight Night</p> <p>Thank you for your overwhelming interest in Faculty Fight Night. What started as a modest departmental fundraiser has become a major university charity event.</p> <p>To your many questions:</p> <ul> <li>The format will be three one-minute rounds (wearing heavy gloves and headgear) under the rules of the state boxing commission. Unlike in the Toughman Competition, no kicking will be allowed.</li> <li>Many of you have expressed interest in fighting individuals within the English Department, but I must ask you to consider professors from other departments. Interdepartmental bouts will generate more interest in the community and student body and, consequently, more revenue for charity. (However, we will do our best to accommodate those of you who still insist on fighting another member of the department.)</li> <li>Full-time faculty will not be allowed to fight teaching assistants. The legal department strictly forbids this since TAs have a different employment classification under state law. (Given the enthusiastic response from full-time faculty, it appears TAs will not be needed.)</li> <li>For insurance and legal reasons, no one will be allowed to fight more than one weight class above their own.</li> <li>As several of you suggested, I contacted the chancellor’s office, but they will not yet commit. While they won&#8217;t stand in our way, their full support will be contingent on our willingness to fight members of the Athletic Department. My understanding is that the athletic director will not fight, but the coaches would likely participate if invited or egged on. A few of you mentioned to me that you would only be willing to fight those holding PhDs, but I ask you to give serious consideration to welcoming the coaches.</li> <li>Three of you have already asked me about nicknames. One of you wants to be known as Charles the Wrestler, and two of you have asked for The Poetic Pugilist. Please see me to sign up for your nickname so that we have no more duplication. I think it’s okay if two of you want to be The Poetic Pugilist. You can fight each other for it.</li> <li>Yes, you may design your own robes and trunks. These should more or less conform to state boxing regulations. See me if you need a copy.</li> <li>We have narrowed the field to two beneficiaries for the proceeds, and I need your input before deciding. Several of you in the <span class="caps">MFA</span> program have suggested Alcoholics Anonymous. I have also had several PhD candidates suggest an Alzheimer’s charity.</li> </ul> <p>Again, thanks for your enthusiasm about this project. See you in the ring.</p>

If you visited the National Archives Exhibition Hall—now known as the Rotunda—between the years 1942 and 1955, you would have likely seen one of the National Archives’ most dedicated and enthusiastic guards, George Bloomquist.

## Robots among us

I ended up with mixed reactions to Waiting for Robots: The Hired Hands of Automation by Antonio Caselli. The powerful point it makes is the complete dependence of AI and digital technologies generally on ongoing human input.

## LLM 0.20

date: 2025-01-23, updated: 2025-01-23, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/releases/tag/0.20">LLM 0.20</a></strong></p>
New release of my <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a> CLI tool and Python library. A bunch of accumulated fixes and features since the start of December, most notably:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for OpenAI's <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models#o1">o1 model</a> - a significant upgrade from <code>o1-preview</code> given its 200,000 input and 100,000 output tokens (<code>o1-preview</code> was 128,000/32,768). <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/676">#676</a></li>
<li>Support for the <code>gpt-4o-audio-preview</code> and <code>gpt-4o-mini-audio-preview</code> models, which can accept audio input: <code>llm -m gpt-4o-audio-preview -a https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/pelican-joke-request.mp3</code> <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/677">#677</a></li>
<li>A new <code>llm -x/--extract</code> option which extracts and returns the contents of the first fenced code block in the response. This is useful for prompts that generate code. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/681">#681</a></li>
<li>A new <code>llm models -q 'search'</code> option for searching available models - useful if you've installed a lot of plugins. Searches are case insensitive. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/700">#700</a></li>
</ul>
