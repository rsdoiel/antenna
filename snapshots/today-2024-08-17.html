id="lockouts-at-canadas-2-largest-railroads-may-disrupt-us-supply-chain">Lockouts
at Canada’s 2 largest railroads may disrupt US supply chain</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>DETROIT — Canada’s two largest railroads are starting to shut down
their shipping networks as a labor dispute with the Teamsters union
threatens to cause lockouts or strikes that would disrupt cross-border
trade with the U.S. </p>
<p>Both the Canadian Pacific Kansas City and Canadian National
railroads, which haul millions of tons of freight across the border,
have stopped taking certain shipments of hazardous materials and
refrigerated products. </p>
<p>Both are threatening to lock out Teamsters Canada workers starting
Thursday if deals are not reached. </p>
<p>On Tuesday, CPKC will stop all shipments that start in Canada and all
shipments originating in the U.S. that are headed for Canada, the
railroad said Saturday. </p>
<p>The Canadian Press reported Friday that, Canadian National barred
container imports from U.S. partner railroads. </p>
<p>Jeff Windau, industrials analyst for Edward Jones &amp; Co., said his
firm expects work stoppages to last only a few days, but if they go
longer, there could be significant supply chain disruptions. </p>
<p>“If something would carry on more of a longer term in nature, then I
think there are some significant potential issues just given the amount
of goods that are handled each day,” Windau said. “By and large the
rails touch pretty much all of the economy.” </p>
<p>The two railroads handle about 40,000 carloads of freight each day,
worth about $1 billion, Windau said. Shipments of fully built
automobiles and auto parts, chemicals, forestry products and
agricultural goods would be hit hard, he said, especially with harvest
season looming. </p>
<p>Both railroads have extensive networks in the U.S., and CPKC also
serves Mexico. Those operations will keep running even if there is a
work stoppage. </p>
<p>CPKC said it remains committed to avoiding a work stoppage that would
damage Canada’s economy and international reputation. “We must take
responsible and prudent steps to prepare for a potential rail service
interruption next week,” spokesperson Patrick Waldron said in a
statement. </p>
<p>Shutting down the network will allow the railroad to get dangerous
goods off IT before any stoppage, CPKC said. </p>
<p>Union spokesperson Christopher Monette said in an email Saturday that
negotiations continue, but the situation has shifted from a possible
strike to “near certain lockout” by the railroads. </p>
<p>CPKC said bargaining is scheduled to continue Sunday with the union,
which represents nearly 10,000 workers at both railroads. The company
said it continues to bargain in good faith. </p>
<p>Canadian National said in a statement Friday that there had been no
meaningful progress in negotiations, and it hoped the union “will engage
meaningfully” during a meeting scheduled for Saturday. </p>
<p>“CN wants a resolution that allows the company to get back to what it
does best as a team, moving customers’ goods and the economy,” the
railroad said. </p>
<p>Negotiations have been going on since last November, and contracts
expired at the end of 2023. They were extended as talks continued. </p>
<p>The union said company demands on crew scheduling, rail safety and
worker fatigue are the main sticking points. </p>
<p>Windau said the trucking industry currently has a lot of excess
capacity and might be able to make up some of the railroads’ shipping
volumes, but “You’re not going to be able to replace all of that with
trucking.”</p>

id="google-threatened-tech-influencers-unless-they-preferred-the-pixel">Google
threatened tech influencers unless they ‘preferred’ the Pixel</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>The tech review world has been full of murky deals between companies
and influencers for years, but it appears Google finally crossed a line
with the Pixel 9. The company’s invite-only Team Pixel program — which
seeds Pixel products to influencers before public availability —
stipulated that participating influencers were not allowed to feature
Pixel products alongside competitors, and those who showed a preference
for competing phones risked being kicked out of the program. For those
hoping to break into the world of tech reviews, the new terms meant
having to choose between keeping access or keeping their integrity. ↫
Victoria Song at The Verge Even though this ended up being organised and
run by a third party, and Google addressed it immediately, it doesn’t
surprise me at all that stuff like this happens. Anyone who has spent
any time on tech YouTube, popular tech news sites, and content farms
knows full well just how… Odd a lot of reviews and videos often feel.
This is because a lot of review programs subtly – or not so subtly –
imply that if you’re not positive enough, you’re going to be kicked out
and won’t get the next batch of cool products to review, thereby harming
your channel or website. Apple is a great example of a company that uses
the threat of not getting review samples, event invites, and similar
press benefits to gain positive media attention. I myself was kicked out
of Apple’s review program and press pool way back during the Intel
transition, because I mentioned the new Intel MacBook Pro got
uncomfortably hot, and Apple really didn’t like that. They tried to
pressure me to change the wording, but I didn’t budge, and consequently,
that was the end of me getting any review items or press invites. I only
ever accepted one Apple press invite, by the way, to their headquarters
in The Netherlands, which was in Bunnik, of all places. Not much of
value was lost without Apple press invites. Nobody wants to go to
Bunnik. With every review of a loaned item on OSNews, you can be 100%
sure there are no shenanigans, because I simply do not let anyone
influence me. OSNews doesn’t live or die by getting reviews of the
latest and greatest tech, so I have no incentive to deal with pushy,
manipulative companies or PR people. I refused to budge to Apple 17
years ago, during my first year at OSNews, when I was in my early 20s –
and I’ve never budged since, either. Now look at everyone getting press
access from Apple, and think to yourself – would any of them tell Apple
to get bent? That being said, I’d love to review the new Google Pixel 9
Pro Fold, if only to make fun of that horrid name. Hit me up,
Google.</p>

id="single-command-windows-11-system-requirements-bypass-trick-for-unsupported-pcs-blocked">Single-command
Windows 11 system requirements bypass trick for unsupported PCs
blocked</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>In October last year, we covered a very simple bypass trick that
involved just a single command when running the Windows 11 Setup. While
this passthrough got popular in the tech community during this time as a
result of the media coverage from Neowin as well as others, it was
actually something even older. To use this, all a user had to do was add
“/product server” when running the setup, and Windows would just skip
the hardware requirements check entirely. As it turns out, Microsoft has
blocked this bypass method on the latest Canary build 27686 as
discovered by X user and tech enthusiast Bob Pony. When trying to use
the Server trick now, the hardware requirements check is not bypassed. ↫
Sayan Sen It’s such an own goal to limit Windows 11 as much as Microsoft
is doing. Windows 11 runs pretty much identically, performance-wise, to
Windows 10 on the same hardware, so there’s no reason other than to
enable the various security features through TPMs and the like. The end
result is that people simply aren’t upgrading to Windows 11 – not only
because Windows 10 is working just fine for them, but also because even
if they want to upgrade, they often can’t. Most people don’t just buy a
brand new PC because a new version of Windows happens to be available.
There’s been a variety of tricks and methods to circumvent the various
minimum specifications checks Microsoft added to the regular consumer
versions of Windows, and much like with the activation systems of yore,
Microsoft is now engaging in a game of whack-a-mole where as soon as it
kills on method, ten more pop up to take its place. There’s a whole
cottage industry of methods, tools, registry edits, and much more,
spread out across the most untrustworthy-looking content farms you can
find on the web, which all could’ve been avoided if Microsoft just
offered consumers the choice of disabling these restrictions,
accompanied by a disclaimer. So Microsoft is now in the unfortunate
situation where most of its Windows users are still using Windows 10,
yet the end of Windows 10’s support is coming up next year. Either
Microsoft extends this date by at least another five years to catch the
wave of ‘natural’ PC upgrades to a point where Windows 10 is a minority,
or it’s going to have to loosen some of the restrictions to give more
people the ability to upgrade. If they don’t, they’re going to be in a
world of hurt with security issues and 0-days affecting the vast
majority of Windows users.</p>

‘uncommitted’ movement hits impasse with top Democrats as DNC
begins</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>DEARBORN, Michigan — Of the thousands of delegates expected to gather
Monday at the Democratic National Convention, only 36 will belong to the
“uncommitted” movement sparked by dissatisfaction with U.S. President
Joe Biden’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war.</p>
<p>But that small core has an outsized influence.</p>
<p>Anger over U.S. backing for Israel’s offensive in Gaza could generate
unwelcome images for convention organizers, with raucous protests
expected outside and potentially inside the Chicago arena where Vice
President Kamala Harris will accept the nomination Thursday.</p>
<p>Top Democrats have spent weeks meeting with “uncommitted” voters and
their allies — including a previously unreported sit-down between Harris
and the mayor of Dearborn, Michigan — in an effort to respond to
criticism in key swing states such as Michigan, which has a significant
Arab American population.</p>
<p>Months of meetings and phone calls between pro-Palestinian activists
and the Harris campaign have fallen into an effective impasse. The
activists want Harris to endorse an arms embargo to Israel and a
permanent cease-fire. Harris has supported Biden’s negotiations for a
cease-fire but rejected an arms embargo.</p>
<p>Rima Mohammad, one of Michigan’s two “uncommitted” delegates, said
she sees the convention as a chance to share their movement’s concerns
with the party leadership.</p>
<p>“It is a way for protesters outside to be able to share their
frustration with the party,” she said.</p>
<p>Harris meets key Arab American mayor</p>
<p>Questions remain about the leverage “uncommitted” voters hold now
that Biden has stepped aside and Harris has taken his place. Democrats
have seen a significant surge in enthusiasm for Harris’ campaign, and
concerns about voter apathy in key areas, such as Detroit’s large Black
population, appear to have diminished.</p>
<p>But Harris and her team have still made communication with Arab
American leaders a priority.</p>
<p>During a campaign trip to Michigan last week, Harris met with
Abdullah Hammoud, the 34-year-old mayor of Dearborn, a Detroit suburb
that has the largest number of Arab Americans of any city in the United
States. The meeting was disclosed by a person who was not authorized to
discuss it publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>The person familiar with the meeting did not provide specific details
but said the focus was on Harris’ potential policy, if elected, on the
Israel-Hamas conflict. Hammoud declined to comment.</p>
<p>“Vice President Harris supports the deals currently on the table for
a permanent cease-fire in Gaza and for the release of hostages,” her
campaign said in a statement. “She will continue to meet with leaders
from Palestinian, Muslim, Israeli and Jewish communities, as she has
throughout her vice presidency.”</p>
<p>Campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez on Thursday held separate
one-on-one meetings with leaders in the Arab American community and
“uncommitted” movement in metro Detroit.</p>
<p>“They are listening, and we are talking,” said Osama Siblani,
publisher of the Arab American News, who met with Chavez Rodriguez. “But
none of us can garner votes in the community without public statements
from Harris. She doesn’t need us; she can win over votes by saying and
doing the right thing.”</p>
<p>According to Siblani, Chavez Rodriguez agreed that “the killing has
to stop.” In response, Siblani said he pressed: “How? There is no
plan.”</p>
<p>Lavora Barnes, the Democratic chair in Michigan, said the party would
“continue working toward our goal of coming together to defeat Donald
Trump and Republicans up and down the ballot.”</p>
<p>“We are committed to continuing these conversations with community
leaders, activists and organizations because we want to ensure that
everyone in the Michigan Democratic Party has a seat at the table,”
Barnes said in a statement.</p>
<p>No agreement on an arms embargo</p>
<p>Some on the Democratic Party’s left have called for including a
moratorium on the use of U.S.-made weapons by Israel in the platform of
policy goals that will be approved during next week’s convention. But
such language isn’t included in a draft platform party officials
released earlier this summer, and it’s unlikely that those close to
Harris’ campaign would endorse including it.</p>
<p>The Uncommitted National Movement has also requested a speaking slot
at the convention for a doctor who has worked on the frontlines in Gaza,
along with a leader of the movement. And they have asked for a meeting
with Harris “to discuss updating the Gaza policy in hopes of stopping
the flow of unconditional weapons and bombs” to Israel, said Abbas
Alawieh, another “uncommitted” delegate from Michigan and one of the
founders of the movement.</p>
<p>Before a Harris rally just outside Detroit last week, Alawieh and
Layla Elabed, co-founders of the movement, briefly met with the vice
president. They requested a formal meeting with Harris and urged her to
support an embargo on weapons shipments to Israel. According to them,
Harris seemed open to the idea of meeting.</p>
<p>However, shortly after news of the meeting became public, Harris’
national security adviser, Phil Gordon, reaffirmed that she does not
support an arms embargo. Alawieh mentioned Wednesday that the group has
not received any further response from Harris’ team or the DNC regarding
their requests ahead of the convention.</p>
<p>“I hope she doesn’t miss the opportunity to unite the party,” said
Alawieh.</p>
<p>Trump campaign continues its outreach</p>
<p>Elsewhere in metro Detroit this week, Massad Boulos, the
father-in-law of Trump’s youngest daughter and now a leader in his Arab
American outreach, was holding meetings with various community groups.
Boulos has come to Michigan often for the outreach, along with Arab
Americans for Trump chair Bishara Bahbah.</p>
<p>According to Bahbah, their pitch highlights the situation in Gaza
under Biden’s administration and a promise from Trump’s team to give the
community a seat at the table if he wins.</p>
<p>“We have been told by the Trump circle, which is not part of the
campaign, that in return for our votes, there would be a seat at the
table and a voice to be heard,” said Bahbah.</p>
<p>But any apparent political opportunity for Trump in the Arab American
community or the “uncommitted” movement may be limited by his past
remarks and policies.</p>
<p>Many Arabs remain offended by Trump’s ban, while in office, on
immigration from several majority Muslim countries, as well as remarks
they consider insulting. Trump also has criticized Biden for not being a
strong enough supporter of Israel.</p>
<p>Speaking to an audience of Jewish supporters Thursday, Trump painted
the protesters expected in Chicago as antisemitic and invoked an Arabic
term that is sometimes used by Muslims to mean war or struggle.</p>
<p>“There will be no jihad coming to America under Trump,” he said.</p>
<p>But Bahbah acknowledges that his and Boulos’ strategy isn’t
necessarily aimed at converting voters to support Trump — but to stop
them from voting for Harris.</p>
<p>“If I can’t convince people to vote for Trump, having them sit at
home is better,” said Bahbah.</p>

id="search-finds-3-more-tulsa-race-massacre-victims-with-gun-wounds">Search
finds 3 more Tulsa Race Massacre victims with gun wounds</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA — The latest search for the remains of 1921
Tulsa Race Massacre victims has ended with three more sets containing
gunshot wounds, investigators said Friday.</p>
<p>The three are among 11 sets of remains exhumed during the latest
excavation in Oaklawn Cemetery, state archaeologist Kary Stackelbeck
said.</p>
<p>“Two of those gunshot victims display evidence of munitions from two
different weapons,” Stackelbeck said. “The third individual who is a
gunshot victim also displays evidence of burning.”</p>
<p>Forensic anthropologist Phoebe Stubblefield, who will remain on site
to examine the remains, said one victim suffered bullet and shotgun
wounds while the second was shot with two different caliber bullets.</p>
<p>Searchers are seeking simple wooden caskets because they were
described at the time in newspaper articles, death certificates and
funeral home records as the type used for burying massacre victims,
Stackelbeck said.</p>
<p>The exhumed remains will then be sent to Intermountain Forensics in
Salt Lake City, Utah, for DNA and genealogical testing in an effort to
identify them.</p>
<p>The search ends just over a month after the first identification of
remains previously exhumed during the search for massacre victims were
identified as World War I veteran C.L. Daniel from Georgia.</p>
<p>There was no sign of gunshot wounds to Daniel, Stubblefield said at
the time, noting that if a bullet doesn’t strike bone and passes through
the body, such a wound likely could not be determined after the passage
of so many years.</p>
<p>The search is the fourth since Tulsa Mayor G.T. Bynum launched the
project in 2018, and 47 remains have now been exhumed.</p>
<p>Bynum, who is not seeking reelection, said he hopes to see the search
for victims continue.</p>
<p>“My hope is, regardless of who the next mayor is, that they see how
important it is to see this investigation through,” Bynum said. “It’s
all part of that sequence that is necessary for us to ultimately find
people who were murdered and hidden over a century ago.”</p>
<p>Stackelbeck said investigators are mapping the graves in an effort to
determine whether more searches should be conducted.</p>
<p>“Every year we have built on the previous phase of this
investigation. Our cumulative data have confirmed that we are finding
individuals who fit the profile of massacre victims,” Stackelbeck
said.</p>
<p>“We will be taking all of that information into consideration as we
make our recommendations about whether there is cause for additional
excavations,” said Stackelbeck.</p>
<p>Brenda Nails-Alford, a descendant of massacre survivors and a member
of the committee overseeing the search for victims, said she is grateful
for Bynum’s efforts to find victim’s remains.</p>
<p>“It is my prayer that these efforts continue, to bring more justice
and healing to those who were lost and to those families in our
community,” Nails-Alford said.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Bynum and City Councilor Vanessa Hall-Harper
announced a new committee to study a variety of possible reparations for
survivors and descendants of the massacre and for the area of north
Tulsa where it occurred.</p>
<p>The massacre took place over two days in 1921, a long-suppressed
episode of racial violence that destroyed a community known as Black
Wall Street and ended with as many as 300 Black people killed, thousands
of Black residents forced into internment camps overseen by the National
Guard and more than 1,200 homes, businesses, schools and churches
destroyed.</p>

out when reporters say something said on their air or in their pub is
“misleading.” What they really mean is someone just lied in their space.
Heard it just now
<a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/tnyradiohour/articles/the-makeorbreak-issues-of-the-2024-election">on
NPR</a> after a Republican was using “talking points” that were
“misleading.” Of course lies <i>are</i> misleading, but they are also
lies. What these reporters hope to do (I guess) is convince you that the
lies they just broadcast don’t reflect poorly on them. If they said
“that guy just lied five times” you’d have to wonder why they included
it. What’s wrong with them. But if they just were “misleading” oh I
guess that’s okay. Same thing happened in an otherwise pretty honorable
piece by Jennifer Rubin in the Washington Post. “When not one but
multiple rants call ‘into question not only his fitness for office but
his basic cognitive abilities,’ the media’s refusal to convey Trump’s
unfitness amounts to misleading the public.” No. It’s not just
misleading, it’s deadly – to the reputation of the publication that
didn’t convey what they saw clearly with their own two eyes. The rest of
the Rubin piece is worth reading. I expect she softened her criticism
because she has to work with the editors at the Post who decided to keep
cutting Trump slack. You and I don’t have that problem. The news
industry in the US must be scrapped and replaced with one that tells the
truth, otherwise what’s the point.</p>

outgoing prime minister plans US visit, media reports</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>TOKYO — Outgoing Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is finalizing
plans to visit the United States in late September for the U.N. General
Assembly and a possible meeting with President Joe Biden, the Yomiuri
newspaper reported on Saturday.</p>
<p>The visit may take place for several days starting on September 22,
the report said, citing multiple government sources it did not
identify.</p>
<p>The Japanese Foreign Ministry, in response to a request for comment
from Reuters, said “nothing has been decided yet.”</p>
<p>Kishida on Wednesday dropped out of the leadership race for the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party, meaning he will step down as prime
minister when his term as party leader ends in late September.</p>
<p>The date of the LDP election is not yet set. It could be as early as
September 20, in which case Kishida would likely address the General
Assembly after Japan’s parliament, where the LDP has a majority, has
chosen his replacement as prime minister, according to Yomiuri.</p>
<p>Some in the Japanese government think it best if Kishida’s successor
does not develop close ties with Biden, who is scheduled to leave office

id="popular-ai-nudify-sites-sued-amid-shocking-rise-in-victims-globally">Popular
AI “nudify” sites sued amid shocking rise in victims globally</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>San Francisco’s city attorney David Chiu is suing to shut down 16 of
the most popular websites and apps allowing users to “nudify” or
“undress” photos of mostly women and girls who have been increasingly
harassed and exploited by bad actors online. These sites, Chiu’s suit
claimed, are “intentionally” designed to “create fake, nude images of
women and girls without their consent,” boasting that any users can
upload any photo to “see anyone naked” by using tech that realistically
swaps the faces of real victims onto AI-generated explicit images. ↫
Ashley Belanger at Ars Technica This is an incredibly uncomfortable
topic to talk about, but with the advent of ML and AI making it so
incredibly easy to do this, it’s only going to get more popular. The
ease with which you can generate a fake nude image of someone is
completely and utterly out of whack with the permanent damage it can do
the person involved – infinitely so when it involves minors, of course –
and with these technologies getting better by the day, it’s only going
to get worse. So, how do you deal with this? I have no idea. I don’t
think anyone has any idea. I’m pretty sure all of us would like to just
have a magic ban button to remove this filth from the web, but we know
such buttons don’t exist, and trying to blast this nonsense out of
existence is a game of digital whack-a-mole where there are millions of
moles and only one tiny hammer that explodes after one use. It’s just
not going to work. The best we can hope for is to get a few of the
people responsible behind bars to send a message and create some
deterrent effect, but how much that would help is debatable, at best. As
a side note, I don’t want to hang this up on AI and ML alone. People –
men – were doing this to to other people – women – even before the
current crop of AI and ML tools, using Photoshop and similar tools, but
of course it takes a lot more work to do it manually. I don’t think we
should focus too much on the role ML and AI plays, and focus more on
finding real solutions – no matter how hard, or impossible, that’s going
to be.</p>

<h2 id="on-hobbies-side-projects-and-money">On hobbies, side projects,
and money</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-17, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;I had a bunch of conversations recently that revolved around the intersection of making things on the web and the financial aspect of them. Talking about money is never particularly fun or inspiring but I think it’s sometimes helpful and worth doing.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
I think the first thing we need to do is make a distinction between side
projects and hobbies. They might look the same but to me, there’s a
clear distinction between the two. A hobby is something one does for
themselves. This blog is a hobby. I write on it because I find it
enjoyable and the primary user is myself. And since it’s a hobby, money
is not taken into consideration because I’m expected to pay for my
hobbies. That’s just how the world works. If you like to go running you
don’t expect other people to pay for your gear or your runs. It’s your
hobby, you’re the beneficiary, you pay for it. And sure, other people
might see you running and find that enjoyable—kinda weird but hey, not
judging—but you still wouldn’t expect them to pay or contribute to that
activity. So in a hobby, the creator and the user overlap.
</p>
<p>
A side project is a bit different. The way I see it, the users of a side
project don’t necessarily overlap with the creator. That’s for example
the case of People and Blogs. P&amp;B is not a hobby but a side project.
The goal is to make something not for myself, but for others. I
obviously enjoy reading the interviews but if I didn’t have to send out
a newsletter every week I’d do this entirely differently. I’d not send
out a series of 9 questions to people but I’d rather email them and have
conversations about things we both find interesting which is something I
often do privately.
</p>
<p>
That’s the main distinction between a hobby and a side project in my
view. Now, as I said before, hobbies are something you’re supposed to
pay for yourself. But what about side projects? This is where things get
messy. Sometimes side projects are straight-up commercial products and
in that case, the financial implications are fairly easy to understand:
I make something, and you pay for it. Easy enough. But what about side
projects where there’s not something up for sale? P&amp;B—just to stick
with the same example—is free for everyone. The newsletter is free, the
interviews here on the site are free, and the RSS is also free. As they
should! After all the goal is to promote a healthier way to inhabit the
web and to encourage more people to go back to personal sites and
personal blogs. And so putting the content behind a paywall makes no
sense because it goes against the goal of the project. But at the same
time, it costs money to run and those costs only go up over time. At the
moment, running P&amp;B is relatively inexpensive but as the project
slowly grows, so do costs. That’s just the reality of doing anything on
the web. And at some point, everyone who has run a side project of some
sort has to figure out what to do. I always went with donations because
I believe in the kindness of people and at the moment—at least for
P&amp;B—it is working out. Another popular option is to rely on either
ads or some form of sponsorship. I’m gonna say more about ads in a
future post but for now, let’s just say that ads can’t be the only
solution. We’re all tired of ads. Ads are everywhere. But we also do
need to accept the fact that it’s either ads or we have to start paying
for the things we enjoy if we want them to stay around.
</p>
<p>
The problem with contributing directly is that sometimes creators don’t
provide a reasonable way to do it. I’ve seen PLENTY of sites that have
one way to contribute and it’s 10/month. And personally, I can’t afford
to support dozens of sites for 10/month. I’d love to, but I just can’t.
And I’m sure I’m not the only person in this situation. I “solved” this
problem for myself with my
<a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/one-a-month">one-a-month</a>
approach—and others <a href="https://oneamonth.club">are
following</a>—but from a purely financial standpoint, it’s a terrible
solution. On a 1$ donation, the payment providers take almost 40% and
I’m left with around 60c. This is obviously not ideal and the math would
work a lot better if I were to set up a 12-a-year club rather than a
1-a-month one. But the point of making 1$ is to lower the friction and
make it easy for the people out there to contribute. Because what we
actually need is a shift in mentality. We need to accept that in order
for the open, non hyper-commercial web to stay alive, we all have to do
our part and we have to contribute something to it. Because running the
sites you enjoy takes time and effort. And it costs money. We can’t
expect everyone to do everything for free, forever. And we also can’t
complain about the endless proliferation of ads and paywalls if we’re
not willing to contribute even as little as 1$ ourselves.
</p>
<p>
I’m personally trying to be transparent with what I do: the amount
people contribute is
<a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/supporters">public on my site</a> and
I’m also listing the sites I’m personally contributing to. I don’t think
it matters how much or how little we all donate because we’re all in
different life circumstances but I do think it’s important to at least
try to contribute something. And if you are not in a position to help
the sites you like financially, try something else: take the time to
email the creators and let them know that what they do matters or share
the links on your own site or on social media. It all helps.
</p>
<p>
The reason why the current web sucks is because way too many people are
expecting things to magically get better without doing their part. The
web is a collaborative product and we all have to do our part to make it
better.

<h1 id="2024-08-16-json-feed-for-indexing">
2024-08-16 JSON feed for indexing
</h1>
<p>
Recently,
<a class="account" href="https://toot.cat/@dredmorbius" title="@dredmorbius@toot.cat"><span
class="citation" data-cites="dredmorbius">@dredmorbius</span></a> wrote
about Google and search and posed the question:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
What if websites indexed their own content, and published a permuted
index in a standard format, in a cache-and-forward model similar to how
DNS works?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
A while ago I wondered about
<a href="2023-03-07_A_vision_for_search">self-published indexes</a>. We
have software to generate feeds. Why not software to generate indexes?
Back then I proposed a JSON format. Today I finally took a look at
<a href="https://www.jsonfeed.org/version/1.1/">JSON Feed</a>. I think
it has everything we need.
</p>
<p>
Take a look at the example for this site:
<a href="/.well-known/search-feed.json.gz">.well-known/search-feed.json.gz</a>.
This file has about 251KiB. The source material is 6740 Markdown pages,
a total of about 21MiB.
</p>
<p>
Using the <code>next_url</code> attribute, it would be possible to split
this file up into chunks of 100 pages each, or a chunk per year, if the
platform promises that older pages never change. This wouldn’t work for
my wiki, but perhaps it would for certain platforms.
</p>
<p>
Somebody will have write up a best-practice on how to use HTTP headers
to avoid downloading the whole file when nothing has changed. Sadly,
<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616#section-13">section
13 of RFC 2616</a> is pretty convoluted. Basically something about the
use of If-Modified-Since and ETags headers.
</p>
<p>
We also need to agree on how to use some of the JSON Feed attributes.
</p>
<p>
<code>content_text</code>: If used, all markup should be ignored by the
server (no guessing whether the text is Markdown or not). It would be
fine if this contained just the text nodes of the HTML, separated by
spaces. This can be useful to see whether words occur in the text, how
frequent they are, etc.
</p>
<p>
<code>content_html</code>: This is the preferred way to include pages in
the index. It is up to the search engine provider to extract useful
information from the HTML, including summaries, extracts, scoring, etc.
It is up to index providers to provide the kind of HTML they think
serves search engines best. This includes using the semantic HTML tags
and dropping style, scripts, footers and other elements that might be
used by search engines to reduce the relevance of the item.
</p>
<p>
I also find <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5005">RFC
5005</a> to be very instructive in how to think about feeds for
archiving.
</p>
<p>
<a class="account" href="https://neuromatch.social/@jonny" title="@jonny@neuromatch.social"><span
class="citation" data-cites="jonny">@jonny</span></a> commented, saying
that it was important to think about how search indexes were going to be
used:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
so given that no single machine would or should store a whole index of
the internet or even all your local internet, you can go a few ways with
that, take the global quorum sensing path and you get a bigass global
dht-like thing like ipfs. if instead you think there should be some
structure, then you need proximity. is that social proximity where we
swap indexes between people we know? or webring like proximity dependent
on pages linking to each other and mutually indexing their neighborhood?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It’s an interesting question but I think I want incremental improvements
to the current situation. So if a person has a website right now, on
server, what’s the simplest thing they can do so that they aren’t
drowned in crawlers and can still be found via search? That would be
publishing an index, analogous to publishing a feed. Having more search
engines (even if using legacy centralized architecture) would be better
than what we have now. Not depending on crawlers would be better what we
have now.
</p>
<p>
In terms of decentralisation, I think I like community search engines
like lieu. The idea is great: a community lists a bunch of sites. Lieu
generates a web ring and crawls them to build an index of all the member
sites. Instead of crawling, it could fetch the indexes. This would be
much better than what it does right now, because right now, lieu uses
colly for crawling and colly ignores robots.txt. This means that
<a href="2024-06-22-lieu">lieu instantly bans itself when it visits my
site</a> because it’s not rate limited. It’s just an implementation
detail, but sadly I am biased. I’ve been on a Butlerian Jihad since 2009
when I discover that <a href="2009-10-15_Network_Traffic">over 30% of
all requests I serve from my sites are for machines, not humans</a>.
</p>
<p>
It makes me want to raise my keyboard and scream “CO₂ for the CO₂ god!!”
</p>
<p>
Somebody should draw a Hacker Elric doing that, standing on a mountain
of electro-trash with the burnt and dead landscape of the
post-apocalypse in the background.
</p>
<p>
But back to the problem of indexing. Right now, search engine operators
and their parasites, the search engine optimisation enterprises, crawl
every single page including page histories, page diffs, and more, on my
wikis. If every wanna-be search engine downloaded my index once a day, I
would be saving resources. Whether that’s a step in the right direction,
I don’t know.
</p>
<p>
<a class="account" href="https://neuromatch.social/@jonny" title="@jonny@neuromatch.social"><span
class="citation" data-cites="jonny">@jonny</span></a> also said:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
i just think that the ability to fundamentally depart from the
commercial structure of the web and all its brokenness doesn’t happen
gradually and esp. not with the server/client stack we have now
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Indeed, there must be another way. I just don’t see it, right now. It’s
always hard to imagine a new world while you’re still living in the old
one. I’m sure the solution will seem obvious to the next generation,
looking back.

suggested that this was the same as the sitemaps.org concept, but I
think the sitemap lists the URLs available and you still have to crawl
the site. At least now you never miss a page.
</p>
<p>
Would having such an index generate too much traffic? I think it would
worm if all other crawling would stop. That’s the necessary trade-off,
of course. No stupid crawlers lost in my wiki admin links (history
pages, diffs) wasting resources – that is my goal. Also, since I ask for
a crawl delay, crawling has to reconnect all the time, negotiate TLS all
the time, start up CGI scripts all the time… having basically a static
snapshot for download would obviate that (in a world where crawlers are
smart enough to understand that the don’t need to crawl).

climate change spurs more wildfires, smoke threatens farmworkers, study
says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — As wildfires scorched swaths of land in the wine
country of Sonoma County in 2020, sending ash flying and choking the air
with smoke, Maria Salinas harvested grapes.</p>
<p>Her saliva turned black from inhaling the toxins, until one day she
had so much trouble breathing she was rushed to the emergency room. When
she felt better, she went right back to work as the fires raged on.</p>
<p>“What forces us to work is necessity,” Salinas said. “We always
expose ourselves to danger out of necessity, whether by fire or
disaster, when the weather changes, when it’s hot or cold.”</p>
<p>As climate change increases the frequency and intensity of wildfires
around the world, a new study shows that farmworkers are paying a heavy
price by being exposed to high levels of air pollution. And in Sonoma
County, the focus of the work, researchers found that a program aimed at
determining when it was safe to work during wildfires did not adequately
protect farmworkers.</p>
<p>They recommended a series of steps to safeguard the workers’ health,
including air quality monitors at work sites, stricter requirements for
employers, emergency plans and trainings in various languages,
post-exposure health screenings and hazard pay.</p>
<p>Farmworkers are “experiencing first and hardest what the rest of us
are just starting to understand,” Max Bell Alper, executive director of
the labor coalition North Bay Jobs with Justice, said Wednesday during a
webinar devoted to the research, published in July in the journal
GeoHealth. “And I think in many ways that’s analogous to what’s
happening all over the country. What we are experiencing in California
is now happening everywhere.”</p>
<p>Farmworkers face immense pressure to work in dangerous conditions.
Many are poor and don’t get paid unless they work. Others who are in the
country illegally are more vulnerable because of limited English
proficiency, lack of benefits, discrimination and exploitation. These
realities make it harder for them to advocate for better working
conditions and basic rights.</p>
<p>Researchers examined data from the 2020 Glass and LNU Lightning
Complex fires in northern California’s Sonoma County, a region famous
for its wine. During those blazes, many farmworkers kept working, often
in evacuation zones deemed unsafe for the general population. Because
smoke and ash can contaminate grapes, growers were under increasing
pressure to get workers into fields.</p>
<p>The researchers looked at air quality data from a single AirNow
monitor, operated by the Environmental Protection Agency and used to
alert the public to unsafe levels, and 359 monitors from PurpleAir,
which offers sensors that people can install in their homes or
businesses.</p>
<p>From July 31 to November 6, 2020, the AirNow sensor recorded 21 days
of air pollution the EPA considers unhealthy for sensitive groups and 13
days of poor air quality unhealthy for everyone. The PurpleAir monitors
found 27 days of air the EPA deems unhealthy for sensitive groups and 16
days of air toxic to everyone.</p>
<p>And on several occasions, the smoke was worse at night. That’s an
important detail because some employers asked farmworkers to work at
night due in part to cooler temperatures and less concentrated smoke,
said Michael Méndez, one of the researchers and an assistant professor
at University of California-Irvine.</p>
<p>“Hundreds of farmworkers were exposed to the toxic air quality of
wildfire smoke, and that could have detrimental impact to their health,”
he said. “There wasn’t any post-exposure monitoring of these
farmworkers.”</p>
<p>The researchers also examined the county’s Agricultural Pass program,
which allows farmworkers and others in agriculture into mandatory
evacuation areas to conduct essential activities like water or harvest
crops. They found that the approval process lacked clear standards or
established protocols, and that requirements of the application were
little enforced. In some cases, for example, applications did not
include the number of workers in worksites and didn’t have detailed
worksite locations.</p>
<p>Irva Hertz-Picciotto, a professor of public health sciences at the
University of California-Davis who was not part of the study, said
symptoms of inhaling wildfire smoke — eye irritation, coughing, sneezing
and difficulty breathing — can start within just a few minutes of
exposure to smoke with fine particulate matter.</p>
<p>Exposure to those tiny particles, which can go deep into the lungs
and bloodstream, has been shown to increase the risk of numerous health
conditions such as heart and lung disease, asthma and low birth weight.
Its effects are compounded when extreme heat is also present. Another
recent study found that inhaling tiny particulates from wildfire smoke
can increase the risk of dementia.</p>
<p>Anayeli Guzmán, who like Salinas worked to harvest grapes during the
Sonoma County fires, remembers feeling fatigue and burning in her eyes
and throat from the smoke and ash. But she never went to the doctor for
a post-exposure health checkup.</p>
<p>“We don’t have that option,” Guzmán, who has no health coverage, said
in an interview. “If I go get a checkup, I’d lose a day of work or would
be left to pay a medical bill.”</p>
<p>In the webinar, Guzman said it was “sad that vineyard owners are only
worried about the grapes” that may be tainted by smoke, and not about
how smoke affects workers.</p>
<p>A farmworker health survey report released in 2021 by the University
of California-Merced and the National Agricultural Workers Survey found
that fewer than 1 in 5 farmworkers have employer-based health
coverage.</p>
<p>Hertz-Picciotto said farmworkers are essential workers because the
nation’s food supply depends on them.</p>
<p>“From a moral point of view and a health point of view, it’s really
reprehensible that the situation has gotten bad and things have not been
put in place to protect farmworkers, and this paper should be really
important in trying to bring that to light with real recommendations,”
she said.</p>

id="supreme-court-keeps-new-rules-about-sex-discrimination-in-education-on-hold-in-half-of-us">Supreme
Court keeps new rules about sex discrimination in education on hold in
half of US</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Friday kept on hold in roughly half
the country new regulations about sex discrimination in education,
rejecting a Biden administration request.</p>
<p>The court voted 5-4, with conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch joining
the three liberal justices in dissent.</p>
<p>At issue were protections for pregnant students and students who are
parents, and the procedures schools must use in responding to sexual
misconduct complaints.</p>
<p>The most noteworthy of the new regulations, involving protections for
transgender students, were not part of the administration’s plea to the
high court. They remain blocked in 25 states and hundreds of individual
colleges and schools across the country because of lower
court-orders.</p>
<p>The cases will continue in those courts.</p>
<p>The rules took effect elsewhere in U.S. schools and colleges on
August 1.</p>
<p>The rights of transgender people — and especially young trans people
— have become a major political battleground in recent years as trans
visibility has increased. Most Republican-controlled states have banned
gender-affirming health care for transgender minors, and several have
adopted policies limiting which school bathrooms trans people can use
and barring trans girls from some sports competitions.</p>
<p>In April, President Joe Biden’s administration sought to settle some
of the contention with a regulation to safeguard the rights of LGBTQ+
students under Title IX, the 1972 law against sex discrimination in
schools that receive federal money. The rule was two years in the making
and drew 240,000 responses — a record for the Education Department.</p>
<p>The rule declares that it’s unlawful discrimination to treat
transgender students differently from their classmates, including by
restricting bathroom access. It does not explicitly address sports
participation, a particularly contentious topic.</p>
<p>Title IX enforcement remains highly unsettled. In a series of
rulings, federal courts have declared that the rule cannot be enforced
in most of the Republican states that sued while the litigation
continues.</p>
<p>In an unsigned opinion, the Supreme Court majority wrote that it was
declining to question the lower-court rulings that concluded that “the
new definition of sex discrimination is intertwined with and affects
many other provisions of the new rule.”</p>
<p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in dissent that the lower-court orders
are too broad in that they “bar the government from enforcing the entire
rule — including provisions that bear no apparent relationship to
respondents’ alleged injuries.”</p>

id="new-jersey-governors-ex-chief-of-staff-will-replace-menendez-until-election">New
Jersey governor’s ex-chief of staff will replace Menendez until
election</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEWARK, New jersey — New Jersey Democratic Governor Phil Murphy
tapped his former chief of staff Friday to temporarily replace convicted
U.S. Senator Bob Menendez and said he would appoint whoever wins the
post in November as soon as election results were certified.</p>
<p>Democratic Representative Andy Kim and Republican hotelier Curtis
Bashaw are competing in the race. Murphy said that he spoke to both
about his plans.</p>
<p>“I expressed to them that this approach will allow the democratically
chosen winner of this year’s election to embark on the smallest possible
transition into office,” Murphy said at a news conference.</p>
<p>Former chief of staff George Helmy promised during Friday’s
announcement to resign after the election.</p>
<p>Helmy’s appointment underscored Murphy’s decision to not appoint Kim,
who is in a strong position in the November election. Kim and first lady
Tammy Murphy were locked in a primary struggle for the Senate seat
earlier this year before Tammy Murphy dropped out, citing the prospects
for a negative, divisive campaign.</p>
<p>The stakes in the Senate election are high, with Democrats holding on
to a narrow majority. Republicans have not won a Senate election in
Democratic-leaning New Jersey in over five decades.</p>
<p>Helmy’s appointment won’t take effect until after Menendez’s
resignation on August 20. The governor said he picked Helmy because he
understands the role after serving as an aide to New Jersey U.S. Senator
Cory Booker and former New Jersey U.S. Senator Frank Lautenberg.</p>
<p>Murphy also praised Helmy’s work as his top aide, and the two
embraced briefly after Helmy spoke.</p>
<p>Helmy, 44, served as Murphy’s chief of staff from 2019 until 2023 and
currently serves as an executive at one of the state’s largest health
care providers, RWJBarnabas Health. He previously served as Booker’s
state director in the Senate. The son of Egyptian parents who immigrated
to New Jersey, Helmy attended public schools in New Jersey and then
Rutgers University.</p>
<p>“New Jersey deserves its full voice and representation in the whole
of the United States Senate,” he said.</p>
<p>Menendez, 70, used his influence to meddle in three different state
and federal criminal investigations to protect the businessmen,
prosecutors said. They said he helped one bribe-paying friend get a
multimillion-dollar deal with a Qatari investment fund and another keep
a contract to provide religious certification for meat bound for
Egypt.</p>
<p>He was also convicted of taking actions that benefited Egypt’s
government in exchange for bribes, including providing details on
personnel at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo, ghostwriting a letter to fellow
senators regarding lifting a hold on military aid to Egypt. FBI agents
found stacks of gold bars and $480,000 hidden in Menendez’s house.</p>
<p>Menendez denied all the allegations.</p>
<p>“I have never been anything but a patriot of my country and for my
country,” he said after his conviction.</p>
<p>Menendez said in a letter to Murphy last month that he was planning
to appeal the conviction but would step down on August 20, just over a
month after the jury’s verdict.</p>

id="border-arrests-drop-33-after-asylum-restrictions-take-hold">Border
arrests drop 33% after asylum restrictions take hold</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Arrests for illegally crossing the border from Mexico
plummeted 33% in July to the lowest level since September 2020, a result
of asylum being temporarily suspended, authorities said Friday.</p>
<p>The Border Patrol made 56,408 arrests last month, down from 83,536
arrests in June, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, its
parent agency.</p>
<p>Asylum was halted at the border June 5 because arrests for illegal
crossings topped a threshold of 2,500 a day, though a lack of
deportation flights prevents authorities from turning away everyone.
U.S. authorities say arrests dropped 55% after the measure took effect,
which followed a steep decline earlier this year that was widely
attributed to Mexican authorities increasing enforcement within their
borders.</p>
<p>“In July, our border security measures enhanced our ability to
deliver consequences for illegal entry,” said Troy Miller, acting CBP
commissioner.</p>
<p>The numbers, which were roughly in line with preliminary estimates,
may give Democrats some breathing room on an issue that has dogged them
throughout Joe Biden’s presidency.</p>
<p>“The Biden-Harris administration has taken effective action, and the
Republicans continue to do nothing,” said White House spokesperson
Angelo Fernández Hernández.</p>
<p>More than 38,000 people were admitted at land crossings through an
online appointment system called CBP One, bringing the total to more
than 765,000 since it was introduced in January 2023.</p>
<p>More than 520,000 people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela
were admitted through July under a separate policy allowing people from
those four countries to apply online with a financial sponsor and arrive
at an airport. Permits were recently halted amid concerns about fraud by
sponsors.</p>
<p>“[The Department of Homeland Security] is working to restart
applications processing as quickly as possible, with appropriate
safeguards,” CBP said in a statement.</p>
<p>CBP said Friday that it will expand areas where non-Mexican migrants
can apply online for appointments to seek U.S. asylum on August 23 to a
large swath of southern Mexico.</p>
<p>Migrants will be able to schedule appointments on the CBP One app
from the states of Chiapas and Tabasco, extending the zone from northern
and central Mexico. Mexicans can apply anywhere in the country.</p>
<p>The move requested by Mexico could ease the strain on the Mexican
government by allowing migrants to wait for their appointments in the
south farther from the U.S. border and lessen dangers for people trying
to reach the U.S. border to claim asylum.</p>
<p>U.S. Representative Mark Green, Republican chair of the House
Homeland Security Committee, criticized the Biden administration’s new
and expanded legal pathways at the border.</p>
<p>“This administration is orchestrating a massive shell game,
encouraging otherwise-inadmissible aliens to cross at ports of entry
instead of between them, thereby creating a façade of improved optics
for the administration, but in reality imposing a growing burden on our
communities,” he said.</p>

id="former-usagm-chief-john-lansing-credited-with-modernizing-agency-dies-at-67">Former
USAGM chief John Lansing, credited with modernizing agency, dies at
67</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — John Lansing, who served as chief executive of the U.S.
Agency for Global Media, died Wednesday at his lakeside home in
Wisconsin at the age of 67. His cause of death was not immediately
announced.</p>
<p>Lansing became the chief of the U.S. Agency for Global Media, known
as USAGM, in 2015. The USAGM is the parent organization that oversees
outlets including Voice of America, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and
Radio Free Asia.</p>
<p>In a written statement, USAGM CEO Amanda Bennett called Lansing “a
relentless advocate for press freedom, journalist safety, and connecting
people around the world in support of freedom and democracy.”</p>
<p>While CEO of USAGM, Lansing created a committee made up of the heads
of each of the agency’s networks “so we could regularly talk through the
state of the world together,” Bennett said.</p>
<p>“John did a lot to modernize this agency,” said Bennett. “From
adopting a digital-first content strategy, to enhancing internet freedom
initiatives, to renaming the agency USAGM from BBG — his vision was
transformative.” </p>
<p>While leading USAGM, Lansing stood up for press freedom.</p>
<p>“Despite some very dark moments, we have not been silenced,” he said
on World Press Freedom Day in 2019. “We will continue to report the
truth. We will continue to find new ways to get independent reporting
and programming to global audiences who rely on it.”</p>
<p>Under Lansing’s leadership, USAGM networks increased their global
weekly audience by more than 100 million. He also expanded the agency’s
use of platforms ranging from encrypted live broadcasting to shortwave
radio in order to push content into countries that jam or ban American
programming.</p>
<p>While Lansing led USAGM, the agency in 2017 launched Current Time TV,
a Russian-language TV and digital network led by RFE/RL in partnership
with VOA.</p>
<p>Left ‘indelible positive impact’ at NPR</p>
<p>Lansing stepped down from his role at USAGM in 2019. After leaving
USAGM, he joined National Public Radio, where he served as chief
executive until stepping down early this year.</p>
<p>In a statement, Lansing’s successor at NPR, CEO Katherine Maher,
lauded how he understood the importance of NPR’s role in supporting
American democracy.</p>
<p>“John had a tremendous impact on NPR’s workplace culture and led the
organization through some of its most difficult times,” Maher said in
the statement. “His commitment to improving NPR’s audience and staff
diversity has left an indelible positive impact.”</p>
<p>Maher said Lansing “inspired those around him with his integrity and
compassion, and his loss will be felt deeply by our staff and across the
public radio system.”</p>
<p>Lansing led NPR throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, which began just
months into his start at the news outlet. During his tenure at NPR, the
outlet won more than 90 awards for its reporting, including its first
Pulitzer in 2021.</p>
<p>Career included leading Scripps</p>
<p>Lansing started in journalism when he was 17 years old at a local
television station in Kentucky. Later in his career, he served for nine
years as president of the Scripps Networks, which oversees stations such
as the Food Network and the Travel Channel.</p>
<p>He also served as CEO of Cable &amp; Telecommunications Association
for Marketing, a marketing association comprised of 90 of the top U.S.
and Canadian cable companies and television programmers.</p>
<p>Lansing is survived by his wife Jean, and their four children, Alex,
Jackson, Nicholas and Jennifer.</p>

<h2 id="the-apple-iigs-megahertz-myth">The Apple IIGS megahertz
myth</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-16, from: OS News</p>
<p>A story you hear all the time about the Apple IIGS is that Apple
purposefully underclocked or limited its processor in some way to
protect the nascent Macintosh, and ensure the IIGS, which could build
upon the vast installed base of Apple II computers, would not outcompete
the Macintosh. I, too, have always assumed this was a real story – or at
least, a story with a solid kernel of truth – but Dan Vincent decided to
actually properly research this claim, and his findings tell an entirely
different story. His research is excellent – and must have been
incredibly time-consuming – and his findings paint a much different
story than Apple intentionally holding the IIGS back. The actual issue
lied with the production of the 65816 processor that formed the beating
heart of the IIGS. It turns out that the 65816 had serious problems with
yields, was incredibly difficult to scale, and had a ton of bugs and
issues when running at higher speeds. What a ride, huh? Thanks for
making it this far down a fifty-plus minute rabbit hole. I can’t claim
that this is the final take on the subject—so many of the players aren’t
on the record, but I’m pretty confident in saying that Apple did not
artificially limit the IIGS’ clock speed during its development for
marketing purposes. Now, I’m not a fool—I know Apple didn’t push the
IIGS as hard as it could, and it was very much neglected towards the end
of its run. If the REP/SEP flaws hadn’t existed and GTE could’ve shipped
stable 4MHz chips in volume, I’m sure Apple would’ve clocked them as
fast as possible in 1986. ↫ Dan Vincent Promise me you’ll read this
article before the weekend’s over. It’s a long one, but it’s
well-written and a joy to read. You’ll also run into Tony Fadell – the
creator of the iPod – somewhere in the story, as well as a public
shouting match, and an almost fistfight, between the creator of the
65816 and Jean-Louis Gassée during San Francisco AppleFest in September
1989, right after Gassée placed the blame for the lack of a faster IIGS
on the 65816’s design. This is an evergreen article.</p>

id="biden-signs-order-to-establish-1908-springfield-race-riot-monument">Biden
signs order to establish 1908 Springfield race riot monument</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden on Friday designated a national
monument at the site of the 1908 race riot in Springfield, Illinois, a
seminal moment in the United States’ long and difficult history with
racial violence targeting Black people. </p>
<p>Biden was joined in the Oval Office by lawmakers as well as civil
rights and community leaders as he signed the proclamation establishing
the monument on 1.57 acres of federal land. The monument is intended to
be a solemn reminder of the two-day riot sparked by mobs of white
residents tearing through Illinois’ capital city under the pretext of
meting out judgment against two Black men — one jailed on a sexual
assault charge involving a white woman, and the other jailed in the
separate murder of a white man. </p>
<p>The Democratic president’s effort to establish the monument comes as
he looks to burnish his legacy in his final months in office. Biden is
also looking to help Vice President Kamala Harris contrast herself with
former President Donald Trump, who is aiming to cut into Democrats’
historic edge with Black voters. </p>
<p>“We can’t let these things fade,” Biden said before signing the
proclamation. He added, “I know this may not seem significant to most
Americans, but it’s of great significance. … It can happen again if we
don’t take care of and fight for our democracy.” </p>
<p>The issue of racial violence continues to reverberate throughout the
country. The monument designation was announced less than six weeks
after the shooting death of Sonya Massey, a 36-year-old Black woman, by
a white sheriff’s deputy in her Springfield home after she called 911
for help. </p>
<p>Biden said he saw the establishment of the Springfield monument as an
opportunity to recognize a significant moment of the Black community’s
resilience. The event helped spur the creation of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People.</p>
<p>Still, Biden, who has repeatedly criticized Trump for sowing racial
discord and failing to speak out against white supremacy, expressed
concern in his Oval Office remarks that the country is at a moment where
he continues “worrying about people wanting to erase history.” </p>
<p>The 1908 riot was a chilling episode that started just blocks from
where Abraham Lincoln had once lived. </p>
<p>After authorities secretly moved the prisoners from the jail and sent
them to another lockup about 60 miles away, the mob took out their anger
on the city’s Black population. </p>
<p>Two Black men, Scott Burton and William Donnegan, were lynched,
dozens of Black-owned and Jewish-owned businesses were looted and
vandalized, and several Black-owned homes were damaged or destroyed. At
least eight white people were also killed in the violence, and more than
100 were injured, mostly by members of the state’s militia or one
another, according to news articles from that period. </p>
<p>The National Guard was called in to restore order. White rioters were
charged but later acquitted for their roles in the lynching and
destruction. </p>
<p>Fed-up civil rights leaders met in New York and chose the centennial
of Lincoln’s birthday, Feb. 12, 1909, to form the NAACP, whose original
board included scholar W.E.B. Du Bois. </p>
<p>The National Park Service in 2018 completed a reconnaissance survey
of sites associated with the Springfield riot and a special resource
study in 2023 that found the sites met the criteria for inclusion in the
National Park System. </p>
<p>“Good things can come out of bad things as long as you don’t forget
what happened,” said Democratic U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth of
Illinois, who was on hand for the signing. </p>
<p>Over the course of his presidency, Biden has signed into law
legislation codifying lynching as a federal hate crime, established
Juneteenth as a federal holiday, and signed a proclamation establishing
a national monument across three sites in Illinois and Mississippi
honoring Emmett Till, and his mother, Mamie Till-Mobley. </p>
<p>The 14-year-old Emmett was tortured and killed in 1955 after he had
been accused of whistling at a white woman in Mississippi. His mother,
Till-Mobley, insisted on an open casket at the funeral to show the world
how her son had been brutalized. Jet magazine’s decision to publish
photos of his mutilated body helped galvanize the Civil Rights
Movement.</p>

id="former-nevada-official-stands-trial-for-murder-of-investigative-journalist">Former
Nevada official stands trial for murder of investigative journalist</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — As the trial into the murder of a Las Vegas
investigative journalist got underway this week, defense attorney Robert
Draskovich argued in court that “killing a journalist does not kill a
story.”</p>
<p>The statement came on the opening day of the trial against Robert
Telles. The 47-year-old former Clark County public administrator is
accused of murder with a deadly weapon against a victim aged 60 or
older.</p>
<p>The victim is Jeff German, a 69-year-old reporter at The Las Vegas
Review-Journal, who was found stabbed to death outside his suburban Las
Vegas, Nevada, home on September 3, 2022.</p>
<p>Telles has pleaded not guilty.</p>
<p>German had reported on alleged mismanagement in Telles’ office. When
Telles later lost a reelection bid in 2022, he posted a letter online in
which he attacked the Review-Journal for its coverage.</p>
<p>In court on Wednesday, prosecutors outlined what they have previously
said is “overwhelming” evidence against Telles, including that the
former public administrator had downloaded images of German’s house onto
his work computer and had done research on German’s car. Prosecutors
have also previously said that DNA matching that of Telles was found
beneath German’s fingernails and on his hands.</p>
<p>“In the end, this case isn’t about politics. It’s not about alleged
inappropriate relationships. It’s not about who’s a good boss or who’s a
good supervisor or favoritism at work,” Chief Deputy District Attorney
Pamela Weckerly said. “It’s just about murder.”</p>
<p>As part of the defense’s argument, Telles’ attorney said that his
client did not have a motive to kill German because “killing a
journalist does not kill a story.”</p>
<p>Multiple press freedom experts told VOA that line of reasoning stood
out to them as shocking — including because it’s factually incorrect,
they said.</p>
<p>“That’s absurd. It’s a little preposterous,” Kirstin McCudden, vice
president of editorial for Freedom of the Press Foundation, told VOA.
“Killing a journalist kills stories. It kills stories every day, all
over the world, and it certainly has a chilling effect on any journalist
who wants to hold powerful people to account.”</p>
<p>Other press freedom experts agreed.</p>
<p>“It makes no sense. Very often the death of a journalist is the death
of a story. No one knows what additional reporting Jeff German could
have done if he were still alive,” Clayton Weimers, the head of the U.S.
bureau of Reporters Without Borders, told VOA in an email.</p>
<p>In the first week of the trial, three of German’s neighbors
testified, including the man who first found German’s body. Other
witnesses included detectives, a medical examiner and former associates
of the defendant.</p>
<p>Based on surveillance footage, former Metropolitan Police Department
homicide detective Cliff Mogg testified that he believed Telles’
vehicle, a maroon Yukon Denali, “was the one used in the commission of
Jeffrey German’s murder.”</p>
<p>After German’s killing, police publicized images of the suspect
walking on a sidewalk near the reporter’s home and the Denali car
driving away.</p>
<p>Real estate agent Zackary Schilling, who helped sell homes through
the public administrator’s office and first met Telles in 2020,
testified that he recognized the suspect’s walk, his shoes and the
vehicle.</p>
<p>Chief Deputy District Attorney Christopher Hamner asked, “Who was the
person you were thinking of?”</p>
<p>“I was thinking of Mr. Telles,” Schilling said. When asked about the
suspect’s shoes, Schilling said, “They’re the cheap Nikes he always
wore.”</p>
<p>Schilling also testified that he knew about the stories German had
written about Telles and that he saw images published in the media of
the suspect’s vehicle.</p>
<p>“It just came down my spine,” Schilling said. “I was like holy crap.
I didn’t want to believe it, but the facts are the facts. That was Rob
Telles’ car.”</p>
<p>The case is the first in U.S. history in which an elected official is
accused of murdering an American journalist.</p>
<p>“Understanding that this is believed to be a crime about the work
that he was doing is incredibly chilling and scary for journalists,”
said McCudden, who is based in New York.</p>
<p>Journalist killings are rare in the United States. According to the
Committee to Protect Journalists, or CPJ, in New York, 17 journalists
and media workers have been killed in the U.S. since the watchdog
started keeping records in 1992. Of those, the CPJ has said it believes
15 cases — including German’s — were in relation to the journalist’s
work.</p>
<p>And while impunity is high globally — journalist murders go
unpunished in nearly 80% of cases around the world, according to the CPJ
— pending a verdict in the German case, no journalist murder in the
United States that has gone entirely unpunished since the group started
keeping track.</p>
<p>Accountability in these cases is especially important because it
sends the message that targeting journalists is unacceptable, according
to Katherine Jacobsen, the U.S. and Canada program coordinator at the
CPJ. Attacks against journalists can also have a chilling effect on
other reporters, she said.</p>
<p>“Because of that public face that many journalists have, killing them
does have a ripple effect throughout the community,” she told VOA.</p>

<h2 id="it-is-finally-possibly-almost-time-for-fusion">It Is Finally,
Possibly, Almost Time for Fusion</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-16, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzE3MzQ1OC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1MDIzNjk4M30.FoeIK73Aty0kUDn6aDoSBsJhCgDnEnmjml0ZWQkBDYU/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
There’s a reason they call a seemingly impossible technological reach a
“moonshot.” Over the years, the term has been used to refer to virtual
reality, self-driving cars, and biometric identification such as DNA
fingerprinting. Now, it’s fusion’s turn.
</p>
<p>
“Where we are on fusion is kind of where we were on getting to the moon
when Kennedy gave his speech,” Phil Larochelle, a founding partner at
Breakthrough Energy Ventures who leads its fusion investment strategy,
told me, referencing John F. Kennedy’s 1962 speech about putting a man
on the moon by 1970. “Did they have any idea how they were going to make
a guidance computer that was actually going to get on the moon? No. Did
they have the rockets that they needed that were strong enough to get to
the moon? No. And so it’s kind of like that in fusion.”
</p>
<p>
There have already been some high-profile milestones over the past few
years. Toward the end of 2022, the National Ignition Facility at
Lawrence Livermore National Lab
<a href="https://www.llnl.gov/article/49306/lawrence-livermore-national-laboratory-achieves-fusion-ignition" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>beat
breakeven</u></a>, creating a fusion reaction that produced more energy
than it took to heat up the fusion plasma. Or when the startup
Commonwealth Fusion Systems, a.k.a. CFS, announced that it had developed
a new type of
<a href="https://cfs.energy/news-and-media/cfs-commercial-fusion-power-with-hts-magnet" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>extremely
powerful magnet</u></a> to better contain and control superheated
plasma. Now, startups and investors think the next decade will be
critical for commercialization.
</p>
<p>
“When we started BEV, we kind of assumed that fusion was going to be too
far off,” said Larochelle. But after talking with CFS and learning more
about the company’s magnet tech, minds changed. Breakthrough invested in
the company — and eventually three other fusion startups, too. “These
better magnets matter a lot,” Larochelle told me. “It matters as much as
the transistor did to a computer. It’s that level of component level
breakthrough that totally changes the game.”
</p>
<p>
For the ordinary optimist, fusion energy might invoke a cheerful
<em><em>Jetsons</em></em>-style future of flying cars and interplanetary
colonization. For the cynic, it’s a world-changing moment that’s
perpetually 30 years away. But investors, nuclear engineers, and
physicists see it as a technology edging ever closer to
commercialization and a bipartisan pathway towards both energy security
and decarbonization.
</p>
<p>
To some extent at least, the data backs them up.
<a href="https://www.fusionindustryassociation.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2024-global-fusion-industry-report-FIA.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>According
to the Fusion Industry Association</u></a>, over 60% of all private
fusion companies were founded in 2019 or later. And in the past three
years alone, fusion companies have brought in over $5.1 billion, over
70% of the sector’s total funding since 1992.
</p>
<p>
“We would hope to see a breakeven moment by private companies in the
next two to three years, by 2028-ish,” followed by a commercial reactor
in the mid-2030s, Julien Barber, an investor at Emerson Collective, told
me. Thus far, Emerson, which is headed by Laurene Powell Jobs, has
invested in two fusion companies, CFS and Xcimer Energy.
</p>
<p>
The major players in the startup ecosystem say they’re on track to get
there. “The progress has actually been faster than Moore’s law,” Ally
Yost, senior vice president of corporate development at CFS, told me,
“but people weren’t looking at that.”
</p>
<p>
Moore’s law is a prediction — largely validated for decades — that the
number of transistors on a microchip, and thus a computer’s processing
speed, would generally double every two years. The performance of fusion
reactors, especially the donut-shaped tokamak reactors that CFS uses,
has historically improved at an even faster rate. But due to some
midcentury researchers and technology enthusiasts overpromising on the
near-term feasibility of fusion, cynicism remains. It also doesn’t help
that the large, intergovernmental fusion megaproject known as ITER has
consistently faced delays and huge cost overruns due to the technical
complexity of the project, as well as the difficulty of wrangling 35
countries to work together.
</p>
<p>
Thus far, though, the private sector is faring better. CFS has raised
over $2 billion, more than any other private company in the space. It
uses an approach known as magnetic confinement fusion, which involves
using strong magnets to confine fusion fuel in the form of a plasma. If
you can keep the plasma dense enough and hot enough for long enough,
atoms start fusing together, releasing a vast amount of energy in the
process. ITER, as well as startups including Type One Energy, Thea
Energy, and Renaissance Fusion are pursuing the same fundamental route,
though with their own technical twists.
</p>
<p>
Lawrence Livermore, on the other hand, achieved its breakthrough fusion
reaction (which it’s since repeated several times) using an approach
known as inertial confinement, in which powerful lasers fire at a pellet
of fusion fuel, causing rapid compression and heating that leads to
nuclear fusion. But the national lab is not aiming to create a
commercial reactor. So when the founders of the startup Xcimer Energy
saw that the National Ignition Facility was closing in on its goal, they
jumped to get inertial confinement tech ready for market.
</p>
<p>
“In August of 2021, NIF achieved a fusion gain of about 0.6,” Xcimer’s
President and CTO, Alexander Valys, told me, referring to the ratio of
the energy generated by the fusion reaction to the energy required to
heat the fusion plasma. An energy gain of one constitutes breakeven, so
the moment didn’t get any mainstream press to speak of. “But inside the
field, everyone knew that the previous NIF shot record was effectively a
gain of like 0.01,” Valys said. The massive jump indicated to him that,
“If we’re going to do this, we have to do it now.” Since then Xcimer has
gotten backing from the biggest names in the space, including BEV,
Lowercarbon Capital, and Emerson Collective, as it looks to build lasers
at lower cost and higher power.
</p>
<p>
One thing that ties fusion’s various technical approaches together is
the fact that they’ve all benefited tremendously from advances in
supercomputing, which allows researchers to better model plasma physics
and rapidly simulate fusion experiments. “It’s really taken the advent
of modern computational methods and supercomputers to be able to model
that process with sufficient accuracy, that you can actually develop a
machine that recreates those conditions,” Christofer Mowry, CEO of the
magnetic confinement startup Type One Energy, told me.
</p>
<p>
At this point, many leading companies say that the problem is no longer
about basic science, but cost. Clea Kolster, head of science at
Lowercarbon Capital, told me that once CFS turns on its demonstration
reactor, the company knows its fusion gain will be “at least greater
than two.” (Lowercarbon is a CFS investor.) That said, there’s still
loads of uncertainty around the reactor’s performance, as outside
studies project that its energy gain will be more like 11 — although
even that might not be enough for it to make economic sense.
</p>
<p>
So while the economics of fusion are a large part of what venture
capitalists are betting on these days, private investment in the
industry has actually fallen over the past two years, after peaking in
2022 at $2.8 billion. “A step change in growth will be required once
private companies deliver results on their prototype machines,” Andrew
Holland, CEO of the Fusion Industry Association,
<a href="https://www.fusionindustryassociation.org/fia-launches-2024-global-fusion-industry-report/" target="_blank"><u>said
in a statement</u></a>, adding that last year’s $900 million in funding
“will not be enough to deliver fusion’s ambitious goals.”
</p>
<p>
To date, government funding has comprised a mere 6% of the industry’s
total, but contra the private funding trend, that figure has been
ticking up as of late. Last year, the
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-announces-46-million-commercial-fusion-energy-development" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Department
of Energy announced</u></a> $46 million in funding for eight private
fusion companies to help the administration reach its goal of
demonstrating fusion at pilot scale within a decade.
</p>
<p>
All the companies I spoke with were awardees, and all agreed that much
more would be needed, pointing to the public-private partnership between
NASA and SpaceX as a model for how the government could more deeply
support commercialization of fusion. That partnership was the product of
NASA’s Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program, designed to
catalyze the development of private spacecraft and funded to the tune of
$800 million.
</p>
<p>
China, meanwhile, is outspending the U.S. on fusion, just as it’s done
with solar, and
<a href="https://www.ans.org/news/article-5668/china-launches-fusion-consortium-to-build-artificial-sun/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>launched
a national fusion consortium</u></a> at the beginning of this year.
</p>
<p>
“We are about to harness the sun a second time, and we can’t make that
mistake again. We have to get serious about building this industry here
in the United States,” Clay Dumas, a partner at Lowercarbon Capital,
told me. The firm has a dedicated
<a href="https://lowercarboncapital.com/2022/10/19/race-to-q1/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$250
million fusion fund</u></a>, and has invested in a total of eight
companies in the space, spanning a wide array of technical approaches.
“That is going to take the combined efforts of investors and
entrepreneurs and policymakers and energy companies and governments to
make sure that we can drive this forward on the timeframe that it needs
to happen.”

leaker Teixeira arraigned on military charges ahead of March trial</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>HANSCOM AIR FORCE BASE, Massachusetts — Jack Teixeira, a member of
the Massachusetts Air National Guard accused of leaking classified U.S.
national security documents online, was arraigned Friday on charges
brought by the U.S. Air Force that he violated military laws. </p>
<p>During a brief appearance before a military judge at Hanscom Air
Force Base in Massachusetts, 22-year-old Teixeira deferred entering a
plea to charges that he obstructed justice and failed to obey a lawful
order until closer to when his court-martial trial is scheduled to begin
on March 10. </p>
<p>The Air Force announced in May it was pursuing charges that he
violated military laws after Teixeira had already pleaded guilty in
March to separate charges in federal court brought by the U.S. Justice
Department. </p>
<p>Air Force prosecutors say Teixeira ignored an order to cease
accessing classified information unrelated to his duties and obstructed
justice by disposing of an iPad, computer hard drive and iPhone after
the leaks were uncovered and instructing someone to delete online
messages Teixeira had sent. </p>
<p>Military Judge Colonel Vicki Marcus at Friday’s hearing said she
would hold hearings in November and January where she would address any
pre-trial motions from defense lawyers. They have argued the charges
were brought in violation of Teixeira’s constitutional right to not be
prosecuted twice for the same offense. </p>
<p>Teixeira was arrested in April 2013 after authorities said he carried
out one of the most serious U.S. national security breaches in years
while working as a cyber defense operations journeyman, or information
technology support specialist. </p>
<p>Despite being a low-level airman, Teixeira held a top-secret security
clearance, and starting in January 2022 began accessing hundreds of
classified documents related to topics including Russia’s invasion of
Ukraine, according to prosecutors. </p>
<p>Teixeira shared classified information on the messaging app Discord
in private servers — a kind of chat room — while bragging that he had
access to “stuff for Israel, Palestine, Syria, Iran and China,”
according to prosecutors.</p>
<p>The U.S. Justice Department plans to seek a sentence of more than 16
years when Teixeira is sentenced on November 12.</p>

A landmark federal staffing mandate has prompted fierce disagreement
between resident advocates and the nursing home industry. Nursing home
owners describe the minimums as extreme, warning they could force some
facilities out of business. Though advocates welcomed the new mandate,
they say it’s more lenient than ideal. We hear about this fierce — and
personal — debate. Plus: a major Social Security number data breach and
parsing more retail sales data.

id="us-colleges-revise-rules-on-free-speech-in-hopes-of-containing-anti-war-demonstrations">US
colleges revise rules on free speech in hopes of containing anti-war
demonstrations</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — As students return to colleges across the United States,
administrators are bracing for a resurgence in activism against the war
in Gaza, and some schools are adopting rules to limit the kind of
protests that swept campuses last spring. </p>
<p>While the summer break provided a respite in student demonstrations
against the Israel-Hamas war, it also gave both student protesters and
higher education officials a chance to regroup and strategize for the
fall semester. </p>
<p>The stakes remain high. At Columbia University, President Minouche
Shafik resigned Wednesday after coming under heavy scrutiny for her
handling of the demonstrations at the campus in New York City, where the
wave of pro-Palestinian tent encampments began last spring. </p>
<p>Some of the new rules imposed by universities include banning
encampments, limiting the duration of demonstrations, allowing protests
only in designated spaces and restricting campus access to those with
university identification. Critics say some of the measures will curtail
free speech. </p>
<p>The American Association of University Professors issued a statement
Wednesday condemning “overly restrictive policies” that could discourage
free expression. Many of the new policies require protesters to register
well in advance and strictly limit the locations where gatherings can be
held, as well as setting new limits on the use of amplified sound and
signage.</p>
<p>“Our colleges and universities should encourage, not suppress, open
and vigorous dialogue and debate even on the most deeply held beliefs,”
said the statement, adding that many policies were imposed without
faculty input. </p>
<p>The University of Pennsylvania has outlined new “temporary
guidelines” for student protests that include bans on encampments,
overnight demonstrations, and the use of bullhorns and speakers until
after 5 p.m. on class days. Penn also requires that posters and banners
be removed within two weeks of going up. The university says it remains
committed to freedom of speech and lawful assembly. </p>
<p>At Indiana University, protests after 11 p.m. are forbidden under a
new “expressive activities policy” that took effect August 1. The policy
says “camping” and erecting any type of shelter are prohibited on
campus, and signs cannot be displayed on university property without
prior approval. </p>
<p>The University of South Florida now requires approval for tents,
canopies, banners, signs and amplifiers. The school’s “speech,
expression and assembly” rules stipulate that no “activity,” including
protests or demonstrations, is allowed after 5 p.m. on weekdays or
during weekends and not allowed at all during the last two weeks of a
semester. </p>
<p>A draft document obtained over the summer by the student newspaper at
Harvard University showed the college was considering prohibitions on
overnight camping, chalk messages and unapproved signs. </p>
<p>“I think right now we are seeing a resurgence of repression on
campuses that we haven’t seen since the late 1960s,” said Risa
Lieberwitz, a Cornell University professor of labor and employment law
who serves as general counsel for the AAUP. </p>
<p>Universities say they encourage free speech as long as it doesn’t
interfere with learning, and they insist they are simply updating
existing rules for demonstrations to protect campus safety. </p>
<p>Tensions have run high on college campuses since the October 7 Hamas
terror attack in southern Israel killed 1,200 people, most of them
civilians, and took about 250 hostages. </p>
<p>Many student protesters in the U.S. vow to continue their activism,
which has been fueled by Gaza’s rising death toll, which surpassed
40,000 on Thursday, according to the territory’s Health Ministry. </p>
<p>About 50 Columbia students still face discipline over last spring’s
demonstrations after a mediation process that began earlier in the
summer stalled, according to Mahmoud Khalil, a lead negotiator working
on behalf of Columbia student protesters. He blamed the impasse on
Columbia administrators. </p>
<p>“The university loves to appear that they’re in dialogue with the
students. But these are all fake steps meant to assure the donor
community and their political class,” said Khalil, a graduate student at
Columbia’s School of International and Public Affairs. </p>
<p>The university did not immediately respond to a request for comment
Thursday. </p>
<p>The Ivy League school in upper Manhattan was roiled earlier this year
by student demonstrations, culminating in scenes of police officers with
zip ties and riot shields storming a building occupied by
pro-Palestinian protesters. </p>
<p>Similar protests swept college campuses nationwide, with many leading
to violent clashes with police and more than 3,000 arrests. Many of the
students who were arrested during police crackdowns have had their
charges dismissed, but some are still waiting to learn what prosecutors
decide. Many have faced fallout in their academic careers, including
suspensions, withheld diplomas and other forms of discipline. </p>
<p>Shafik was among the university leaders who were called for
questioning before Congress. She was heavily criticized by Republicans
who accused her of not doing enough to combat concerns about
antisemitism on the Columbia campus. </p>
<p>She announced her resignation in an emailed letter to the university
community just weeks before the start of classes on September 3. The
university on Monday began restricting campus access to people with
Columbia IDs and registered guests, saying it wanted to curb “potential
disruptions” as the new semester draws near. </p>
<p>“This period has taken a considerable toll on my family, as it has
for others in the community,” Shafik wrote in her letter. “Over the
summer, I have been able to reflect and have decided that my moving on
at this point would best enable Columbia to traverse the challenges
ahead.” </p>
<p>Pro-Palestinian protesters first set up tent encampments on
Columbia’s campus during Shafik’s congressional testimony in mid-April,
when she denounced antisemitism but faced criticism for how she
responded to faculty and students accused of bias. </p>
<p>The school sent in police to clear the tents the following day, only
for the students to return and inspire a wave of similar protests at
campuses across the country as students called for schools to cut
financial ties with Israel and companies supporting the war. </p>
<p>The campus was mostly quiet this summer, but a conservative news
outlet in June published images of what it said were text messages
exchanged by administrators while attending a May 31 panel discussion
titled “Jewish Life on Campus: Past, Present and Future.” </p>
<p>The officials were removed from their posts, with Shafik saying in a
July 8 letter to the school community that the messages were
unprofessional and “disturbingly touched on ancient antisemitic
tropes.” </p>
<p>Other prominent Ivy League leaders have stepped down in recent
months, largely because of their response to the volatile protests on
campus. </p>
<p>University of Pennsylvania President Liz Magill resigned in December
after less than two years on the job. She faced pressure from donors and
criticism over testimony at a congressional hearing where she was unable
to say under repeated questioning that calls on campus for the genocide
of Jews would violate the school’s conduct policy. </p>
<p>And in January, Harvard University President Claudine Gay resigned
amid plagiarism accusations and similar criticism over her testimony
before Congress.</p>

(so ActivityPub for now is probably the best approach) and supports
plain old Markdown without any weird embellishments. I don’t work in the
Mastodon world, I’m already committed to the projects I’m doing. But we
could really use something nice, designed to plug into blogs. This is a
good use-case, and it’s pretty close.</p>

<h2 id="windows-can-now-create-2tb-fat32-file-systems">Windows can now
create 2TB FAT32 file systems</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-16, from: OS News</p>
<p>Even though FAT32 supports disk sizes of up to 2TB, and even though
Windows can read FAT32 file systems of up to 2TB, Windows can’t actually
create them. The maximum file system limit Windows can create with FAT32
is 32GB, a limitation that dates back to Windows 95 which has never been
changed. It seems Microsoft is finally changing this with the latest
Insider Preview build of Windows 11, as the format command can now
finally create FAT32 file systems of up to 2TB. When formatting disks
from the command line using the format command, we’ve increased the
FAT32 size limit from 32GB to 2TB. ↫ Amanda Langowski and Brandon
LeBlanc Sadly, this only works through the format command; it’s not yet
reflected in the graphical user interface, which is just so typically
Microsoft. Of course, most of us will be using exFAT at this point for
tasks that require an interoperable file system, but not every device
accepts exFAT properly, and even those that do sometimes have issues
with exFAT that are not present when using FAT32. A more interesting new
addition in this preview build is the Windows Sandbox Client Preview.
This build includes the new Windows Sandbox Client Preview that is now
updated via the Microsoft Store. As part of this preview, we’re
introducing runtime clipboard redirection, audio/video input control,
and the ability to share folders with the host at runtime. You can
access these via the new “…” icon at the upper right on the app.
 Additionally, this preview includes a super early version of command
line support (commands may change over time). You can use ‘wsb.exe
–help’ command for more information. ↫ Amanda Langowski and Brandon
LeBlanc Windows Sandbox is a pretty cool feature that provides a
lightweight desktop environment in which you can run applications
entirely sandboxed, separate from your actual Windows installation.
Changes and files made in the sandbox do not persist, unless the sandbox
is shut down from within the sandbox itself. There’s a whole variety of
uses this could be good for, and having it integrated into Windows is
awesome. Windows Sandbox is available in Windows Pro or Enterprise – not
Home – and is quite easy to use. Open up its window, copy/paste an
executable to the sandbox, and run it inside the sandbox. As said, after
closing the sandbox, all your changes will be lost. That process is
still a bit clunky, but with a bit more work it should be possible for
Microsoft to smooth this out, and, say, add an option in the right-click
menu to just launch any executable in the sandbox that way.</p>

yesterday it is building a massive $1.4 billion manufacturing plant in
North Carolina. Natron already has a facility in Michigan, which is the
only commercial scale sodium-ion battery plant in the country. Its new
operation will be the first sodium-ion battery gigafactory in the U.S.,
capable of producing 24GW of batteries every year and representing a
40-times scaling up of production. The factory will create 1,000 clean
energy jobs.

Heatmap’s Katie Brigham explained</a>, sodium-ion technology “performs
roughly the same as lithium-ion in energy storage systems,” but is far
more abundant in the U.S. than lithium, cheaper, and also appears less
likely to catch fire than lithium-ion. Research and consulting firm
Benchmark Mineral Intelligence expects to see a 350% jump in announced
sodium-ion battery manufacturing capacity this year alone. And while the
supply of these batteries is only in the tens of gigawatts today,
Benchmark forecasts that it will be in the hundreds of gigawatts by
2030.

<h2>
Let’s start from the basics: can you introduce yourself?
</h2>
<p>
You should, like my wife and my children, call me Ploum!
</p>
<p>
I’m a 43 years Belgian writer, free software developer and blogger. I
write novels (in French) and teach open source development at École
Polytechnique de Louvain. I’m also a cyclist and a freediver. As a
native French speaker, I apalogise for the English mistakes. Please read
my answer with an atrocious French accent.
</p>
<p>
On the <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Dricot">Wikipedia
page about me</a>, the first word next to my name is “blogueur” (blogger
in French). I conclude that my most important activity is being a
blogger. All important things in my life happened, directly or
indirectly, because of my blog.
</p>
<p>
I’ve been hired in most of my professional positions because of my blog.
I’ve met my wife because, after reading a tweet of mine that went viral,
she started to read my blog. I’ve written the first book ever about
Ubuntu because of my blog. I’ve met my current publisher through my
blog. I’ve even started doing long distance bikepacking trips thanks to
Thierry Crouzet, a French writer that I knew for years because we were
reading each other blog.
</p>
<p>
My blog is thus irremediably linked to my identity. I would say that the
only part of my life insulated from my blog is my passion for
freediving. Being a freediver at heart but living far from the sea, I’ve
been practising under water hockey for years. It allows me to spend time
at the bottom of the pool.
</p>
<h2>
What’s the story behind your blog?
</h2>
<p>
I started my first website in 1998, a few weeks after my parents got an
Internet connection. I quickly had multiple websites, one of them being
a kind of online journal for which I was updating a monthly page by
hand. I also started a quite popular generalist wiki which attracted
many external contributors.
</p>
<p>
Around 2002, I declared that blog was just a stupid name for what was a
normal website, that I would never have a blog myself. I’m a visionary,
you see. In 1995, after trying to browse the web for the first time on a
friend’s computer, I’ve said that the web had no future, that it was
only a temporary fad.
</p>
<p>
At the same time, I was very active on many different forums. Remember
forums? I was often repeating myself on them and posting same stuff for
various communities. So, at some point, I wanted to centralise all my
writing in one place. Inspired by the blogger Tristan Nitot, I installed
the Dotclear CMS and opened my blog.
</p>
<p>
On forums, my avatar was often a small Waldo from the “Where is Waldo?”
books. A roommate suggested that if I ever started a blog, it should be
called “Where is Ploum?” So I called my first blog with that name on a
subdomain from one of my websites.
</p>
<p>
There was also a hidden motivation behind the blog. At the time, I was
really involved in a project called “no-name-yet” that would soon become
public. And I wanted a platform to spread the word about that project.
That “no-name-yet” was later released under the name “Ubuntu”. So it
happens that my blog has the exact same age as Ubuntu and shares a lot
of its history.
</p>
<p>
Writing on my blog quickly became a lifestyle. The success of my blog
also took me by surprise: people I didn’t know were reading me,
commenting, contacting me, inviting me to conferences. For 4 years, I
used Dotclear. As a side gig, I started a small business hosting
people’s blogs on a Dotclear version 2 platform but kept Dotclear
version 1 for my own blog.
</p>
<p>
In 2008, I eventually migrated to Wordpress because it was the de facto
standard in the industry. I’ve always been self-hosted and made sure to
import all my old blog posts. Beside a theme change, the migration was
totally transparent for my readers. Even URLs were kept because cool
URLs never change.
</p>
<p>
I started to hate Wordpress more every year but, despite multiple
attempts, I could not get rid of it. In 2020, I encountered the Gemini
protocol and started a gemlog (a blog on Gemini), completely separated
from my blog. It started to grow and I wanted to integrate my gemlog
posts into my historical blog (that I was still using).
</p>
<p>
In 2022, I had a “Eureka” moment. Instead of integrating my gemlog into
my wordpress blog, I would do the opposite and import all my historical
blog posts into my gemlog. Then, I would make an HTML version of my
gemlog.
</p>
<p>
I called that
“<a href="https://ploum.net/2022-12-04-fin-du-blog-et-derniere-version.html">the
last version of ploum.net</a>” because I’m not dependent anymore on any
external tools. Everything is now done through a handmade python script.
All I have to do is to write text files in the Gemtext format. It cannot
be simpler.
</p>
<h2>
What does your creative process look like when it comes to blogging?
</h2>
<p>
Firstly, I never force myself to write or publish. I don’t have any
schedule or any mandatory thing to do.
</p>
<p>
Every single post is there because I wanted to write it and publish it.
I’ve been through many iterations of my creative process, using stuff
like Evernote or other. I threw it all away.
</p>
<p>
I simply have an “inbox” folder where there are drafts in gemtext
format. They could linger there for months or years. Sometimes, they are
published one hour after starting them. There’s no rule.
</p>
<p>
I’ve been greatly influenced by Cory Doctorow and his memex method. In
my inbox, I keep a “today.gmi” file in which I write small reflections
and links to interesting articles. When the file is bigger than 1000
words, I try to give it a direction, I reorder the nuggets and publish
it without thinking too much about it.
</p>
<p>
As a consequence, my blog is a mix of focused posts that took a long
time to write, focused posts that were written in a whim and posts
containing random thoughts and links. I let you try to guess in which
category is a given post.
</p>
<p>
The gemtext format had a great influence on my process. It doesn’t allow
inline links and forces a link to be alone on its own line. This
constraint was a liberating tool. Instead of putting links everywhere in
my posts, I started to really think about each link. A link can only be
added if it is clear why it is there and if it is not interrupting too
much the reading flow. Which means that it should add real value for the
reader. I feel my writing greatly improved because of this. I can write
without thinking in HTML, without thinking about the links. Every post
is a standalone with optional links for readers who want to investigate
more the subject.
</p>
<p>
I must add that I write my own journal on a mechanical typewriter.
Sometimes, I realise that an entry could be made public so I copy it to
a file by hand (I’ve tried OCR but without much success. It is easier to
copy everything by hand as it allows me to make corrections).
</p>
<p>
One day, I will write a whole book about my typewriter creative process.
</p>
<h2>
Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe the
physical space influences your creativity?
</h2>
<p>
Yes, I do believe that the body associate a physical space with a given
activity. It is a learned habit. The bad news is that my body learned
that my home office is the place to answer emails, read stuff and do
administrative work.
</p>
<p>
When I need to work on a new book, I often need to walk away. I would
take my typewriter in a hotel room or a cabin in the wood and spend
multiple days disconnected to « just write ».
</p>
<p>
I also hate every single noise and don’t listen to music during the
creative phase. But I may listen to loud metal, punk rock or classic
music during all the “boring” steps: proofreading, general corrections,
spelling, etc.
</p>
<p>
Hopefully, writing blog posts is now part of my daily automatic tasks so
I can do it in my home office.
</p>
<p>
The editor is also important. I’ve been using Gedit, Pyroom, Ulysses,
Zettlr. But, a few years ago, I decided to really improve my Vim skills
and I’m now doing everything in Vim without any plugins nor special
configuration. Vim and my Bépo keyboard are unbeatable power tools. I
see my writing on the screen before thinking of it.
</p>
<h2>
A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your tech
stack?
</h2>
<p>
I’ve told above the history of my blogs. The current setup is quite
interesting.
</p>
<p>
I write gemtext files and give them a name that starts with the date
such as “2024-06-25-blogpost.gmi”. When this is done, I have a simple
python script that does two things: first it creates an index.gmi file
with a list of all blog posts in anti-chronological order. This is the
gemini capsule. Then, the python file convert all the gemtext into html,
creating the website itself.
</p>
<p>
There are some subtleties: the script also handle the atom feed, the
fact that I write in French and English (thus generating two indexes)
and send an email version for my mailing-list subscribers. But
everything is done by one python file without any dependency. It is
extremely simple.
</p>
<p>
The HTML template itself has around 40 lines of CSS and nothing else.
Very clean, very efficient, very fast to load even on bad connections.
</p>
<p>
Currently, I host it on Sourcehut. It allows me to simply do a “git
push” and have the HTML version generated on the server. Sourcehut is
also, to my knowledge, one of the only Gemini hosting providers.
</p>
<p>
But if I had to move, it would be only a matter of changing my git
remote.
</p>
<p>
I don’t need to backup anything from the server side: my blog and all
its history are now in a git repository.
</p>
<p>
It should be highlighted than I’m a command-line junkie. So I do
everything in Vim and even developed a command-line offline-first
browser to read Gemini, RSS and other blogs. It is called
<a href="https://sr.ht/~lioploum/offpunk/">Offpunk </a>.
</p>
<p>
So, yeah, my screen is fully black with tiled terminals. I live with
Neovim, Offpunk, Neomutt and a couple of bash/python scripts. This is so
comfy that I’m frustrated each time I need to open Firefox or any other
GUI application.
</p>
<h2>
Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would you do
anything differently?
</h2>
<p>
My blog is exactly where I want it to be. If I had to start again, I
would simply do it like I did in 2022. I was quick to remove any form of
comments from my blog and, later, any kind of statistics. As far as I
know, I’m one of the few strong advocates for the complete removal of
statistics/analytic/tracking tools. It’s not ethical to spy on users but
it is also completely counterproductive. Statistics on websites are a
brainworm. People are obsessed by it and it makes them write dumb stuff
in order to increase a dumb counter. Getting rid of any
audience-measuring tool is one of the best things I did in 2013.
</p>
<p>
There’s another thing I want to say to past me if time travel is ever
invented: don’t fall into the social networks trap!
</p>
<p>
I’ve spent way too many time chasing followers on Twitter, Facebook,
Medium and Google+. I’ve written many interesting stuff on those
platforms, thinking they were not “interesting enough” for my blog. I
regret all I’ve written on proprietary platforms. My blog is my personal
history and I plan to keep it until I die.
</p>
<p>
I’ve completely deleted all my social network accounts and never felt so
free. Ironically, the less I was using social networks, the more readers
I had on my blog. Social networks don’t bring you an audience. This is a
lie! Social networks distract you from your real work and prevent your
audience from reaching you. That’s their whole business! I know how
frightening it is to delete permanently an account with thousands of
followers. But this number is also a lie.
</p>
<p>
Removing permanently those accounts (and not merely “deactivating them”,
as I’ve done multiple times before) changed my life and my blog.
</p>
<p>
The only account I still have is a Mastodon account. That I access
through the command-line “toot”. You can find me there if you really
like but I don’t encourage you to follow me. Use RSS!
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://mamot.fr/@ploum">https://mamot.fr/<span
class="citation" data-cites="ploum">@ploum</span></a> - <span
class="citation" data-cites="ploum">@ploum</span><span class="citation"
data-cites="mamot.fr">@mamot.fr</span>
</p>
<p>
I don’t use Mastodon to reach an audience but only to communicate with
interesting people. I hope Mastodon will one day hide the followers
counter so we stop being obsessed with those silly numbers.
</p>
<h2>
Financial question since the Web is obsessed with money: how much does
it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost, or does it generate some
revenue? And what’s your position on people monetising personal blogs?
</h2>
<p>
In 2006, I experimented with advertising on my blog, earning something
between 35€ and 100€ every month (through Google).
</p>
<p>
I quickly realised the moral implications of that money and now consider
that advertising is, by essence, a scam. Its goal is to make us consume
stuff we don’t need and, in the process, make people dishonest. If you
earn money through advertising, you are, by definition, dishonest. You
cannot be honest as the whole definition of advertising is paying you to
be dishonest. All in the name of destroying our natural resources as
fast as possible.
</p>
<p>
Later, I was one of the first French bloggers to popularise the concept
of “prix libre” (free price in French), asking my readers to make free
donations. I managed to earn a regular income between 200€-300€ per
month, mainly on the Flattr platform but also through direct donations.
This was well before Patreon and similar platforms.
</p>
<p>
This experience was awesome. I was paid but I also received pictures,
hand-written letters of support, nice messages. People really understood
that it was not about money only, it was about supporting my work. I can
never thank enough those who supported me.
</p>
<p>
With the advent of platforms like Patreon, the “free price” concept
become a bit too popular for my taste. Everybody was asking for money.
Also, I started to publish books. Now, I ask people that want to support
me to simply buy my books. It’s the best way to support me but to also
support my publisher (who took the risk of putting most of his catalogue
into the Creative Commons license) and to support small bookstore.
</p>
<p>
Running the blog itself is cheap. 10€/year for a domain. To support the
project, I decided to pay the maximum tier for Sourcehut, which is
100€/year. All in all, my blog costs me less than 10€ per month.
</p>
<p>
In 20 years, I’ve published ±900 blog posts. With all the pictures, this
amount to less than 150Mo. If it was really needed, it could probably be
hosted for next to nothing. Blogging is really cheap.
</p>
<h2>
Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth checking out?
And also, who do you think I should be interviewing next?
</h2>
<p>
I read many blogs and gemlogs. The whole Gemini community is really
interesting as it reminds me of the blogosphere I was reading in
2003-2004.
</p>
<p>
Maybe the most interesting are people I’m still reading after all those
years, people that have a great influence on how I blog.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://www.standblog.org/blog/">Tristan Nitot</a> (in French)
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://tcrouzet.com/">Thierry Crouzet</a> (in French)
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://pluralistic.net/">Cory Doctorow</a> (in English)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I’m still reading and was also influenced a lot by Low-Tech Magazine:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/">Low-Tech Magazine</a> (in
English)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
For those that would like to try discovering Gemini and its gemlogs, I
recommend starting with those two aggregators:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Antenna - gemini://warmedal.se/~antenna/
</li>
<li>
Cosmos - gemini://skyjake.fi/~Cosmos/recent.gmi
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are many gemlogs I like but you should probably follow Solderpunk
as he’s the creator of the Gemini protocol.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Solderpunk’s gemlog -
gemini://zaibatsu.circumlunar.space/~solderpunk/gemlog/
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
Final question: is there anything you want to share with us?
</h2>
<p>
I think I’ve covered it all about myself in all the previous questions.
I’m currently working on several novels and one book about the history
of computer science.
</p>
<p>
As that last one is in English and as we discuss translating my novels
with my publisher, I find myself increasingly wanting to work with a
literary agent. If you happen to know one, I would be happy to be put in
touch.
</p>
<p>
And to all blog readers across the world: use RSS readers! Those are
awesome and allows you to quickly subscribe/unsubscribe at your own
pace.

<h2 id="the-bright-side-of-the-trump-musk-summit">The Bright Side of the
Trump-Musk Summit</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-16, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzM2NTYwOC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3MDAyNzMwOX0.777FEizy1qGQbDUVIcTzENoB9ol8xkNFpLpDvf7BFIg/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
When Donald Trump speaks at length — at a rally, at a press conference,
or in an interview — subsequent news reports often clean up his remarks
through well-placed ellipses and generous paraphrases, imposing a
coherence nowhere to be found in the original. So it was with
<a href="https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/elon-musk-and-donald-trump-interview" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>his
recent conversation</u></a> with Elon Musk on X, during which the two
spent a fair amount of time laying out their deep thoughts on climate
change, to the horror of many observers. (Bill McKibben
<a href="https://billmckibben.substack.com/p/the-dumbest-climate-conversation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>called
it</u></a> “The dumbest climate conversation of all time.”)
</p>
<p>
At the risk of being too kind to both men, there was a silver lining to
be found in their tête-à-tête, even if its purpose was to help get Trump
back in the White House. For all he has devolved into a right-wing
internet troll, Musk might convince Trump — and the millions who follow
them both — to shift their perspective on climate change a critical few
degrees in a useful direction.
</p>
<p>
That’s not to say the Trump-Musk confab wasn’t uncommonly stupid,
because it was. In addition to a litany of false statements and odd non
sequiturs, Trump was illogically dismissive of climate concerns: “The
biggest threat is not global warming, where the ocean’s going to rise
one-eighth of an inch over the next 400 years and you’ll have more
oceanfront property.” He also lamented the imaginary fact that “you have
farmers that are not allowed to farm anymore and have to get rid of
their cattle,” an area apparently of deep concern to him; elsewhere he
has
<a href="https://x.com/SamJefferson__/status/1816257343446765933" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>claimed</u></a>
that Kamala Harris “wants to pass laws to outlaw red meat to stop
climate change.” Neither of these things is remotely true (though
farmers forced to sell their cattle due to
<a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/is-extreme-weather-climate-change#drought" target="_self"><u>drought</u></a>
are now eligible for
<a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/farmers-and-ranchers-hit-hard-by-drought-may-be-eligible-for-extension-of-tax-relief" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>extra
tax relief</u></a> as of 2022).
</p>
<p>
The Tesla chief offered his own brand of misinformation; like many a
semi-informed autodidact, he often says things that are true in some
sense but deeply misleading. Talking about carbon in the atmosphere, he
told Trump, “Eventually, it actually simply gets uncomfortable to
breathe. People don’t realize this. If you go past 1,000 parts per
million of CO2, you start getting headaches and nausea. And so we’re now
in the sort of 400 range … we still have quite a bit of time. We don’t
need to rush.” While it’s true that it would be difficult to breathe at
a CO2 concentration of 1,000 parts per million, the danger of rising
carbon emissions isn’t that someday we might all choke to death; as
climate scientist Michael Mann
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/aug/13/trump-musk-x-climate" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>said</u></a>
in response, by the time we reach that point the myriad effects of
climate change “will be so devastating as to have already caused
societal collapse.”
</p>
<p>
On the whole, the interview showed Musk praising Trump and nodding along
with some of the former president’s loopier statements, but eventually
attempting to convince him that carbon emissions can be lowered
painlessly (albeit in ways that would just happen to make Musk even
richer). “People can still have a steak and they can still drive
gasoline cars, and it’s okay,” he reassured Trump. “When you look at our
cars, we don’t believe that environmentalism, that caring about the
environment should mean that you have to suffer. So we make sure that
our cars are beautiful, that they drive well, that they’re fast, they’re
sexy. They’re cool,” Musk said, concluding that “I’m a big fan of, let’s
have an inspiring future and let’s work towards a better future.”
</p>
<p>
That has always been Musk’s position, and while one certainly might
disagree with parts of his argument (or his
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/h4ZoGASM8bI" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>prior
claim</u></a> that “I’ve done more for the environment than any single
human on Earth”), if the goal were to talk Trump into lessening his
opposition to any and all efforts to mitigate climate change, that might
be the only way to do it. Even in the course of the conversation one
could see Trump coming around, at least here and there. “I’m sort of
waiting for you to come up with solar panels on the roofs of your cars,”
he told Musk. “I’m sure you’ll be the first, but it would seem that a
solar panel on the roofs, on flat surfaces, on certain surfaces might be
good, at least in certain areas of the country or the world where you
have the sun.” There are already
<a href="https://www.edmunds.com/electric-car/articles/electric-cars-with-solar-panels.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
number of cars</u></a> with solar panels on their roofs — no one is
waiting for Musk to devise one — but the fact of Trump speaking
positively about any kind of solar power is more significant than
whether he is aware of the latest technology.
</p>
<p>
For the moment, Trump’s bromance with Musk — or marriage of convenience
— has even led the former president to moderate his
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/trump-ev-pivot-elon-musk" target="_self"><u>rhetoric
on electric vehicles</u></a>, which he has often condemned in the past.
“I’m constantly talking about electric vehicles but I don’t mean I’m
against them. I’m totally for them,”
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/23/climate/trump-electric-vehicles-musk.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>he
said</u></a> at a rally in July. “I’ve driven them and they are
incredible, but they’re not for everybody.”
</p>
<p>
None of this is to say that Trump has anything but a deeply reactionary
climate agenda. The oil magnates
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/13/oil-donors-trump-pac-harold-hamm-election/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>pouring
money</u></a> into his campaign are not being fooled about the return
they can expect on their investment. The Republican nominee himself may
have few fixed ideas about climate, but the people he appoints to
another administration and the Republicans in Congress that support him
will be committed to rolling back President Biden’s climate programs and
finding new ways to promote fossil fuels and undermine the policy
changes that are beginning to reduce emissions.
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, rhetoric does matter, and Trump doesn’t have to become a
climate hawk to begin influencing his admirers to see the issue in a
slightly different way. Even if all it means is that they become a
little more open to looking at climate mitigation as not a dire threat
to their way of life, but rather something that won’t make much of
difference to them one way or the other — in other words, if they move
from being hostile to climate efforts to being simply indifferent — that
would be a significant change.
</p>
<p>
The theory behind favoring
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/inflation-reduction-act-carrots-sticks" target="_self"><u>carrots
over sticks</u></a> in climate policy — more subsidies, fewer mandates —
is in part that diffusing opposition is an important component of policy
success. If Elon Musk encourages Trump to start talking about climate in
ways that make addressing the problem sound less threatening to his
supporters, it couldn’t hurt.

US look to joint production of hypersonic missile, US lawmaker says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SYDNEY — Joint production of hypersonic missiles by Australia and the
United States could reduce strain on the U.S. defense industrial base
and boost deterrence in the Indo-Pacific region, U.S. Republican
lawmaker Michael McCaul said in Sydney on Friday.</p>
<p>In an interview, the chair of the U.S. House Foreign Affairs
Committee said the Australian manufacture of the cutting-edge weapons
provided an example of how streamlined licensing of sensitive U.S.
defense technology, and license exemptions on 70% of defense exports to
Australia from September 1, would help the U.S. compete with China in
developing advanced weapons.</p>
<p>Hypersonic missiles, which travel in the upper atmosphere more than
five times faster than sound, were tested by China in 2021, prompting a
technology race with the United States. Their recent use by Russia in
the Ukraine war, sparked concern among members of NATO.</p>
<p>A Chinese hypersonic weapon “could hit Australia in a matter of
minutes and Australia cannot stop that right now. So we need to catch up
to that,” McCaul said.</p>
<p>“I was at a hypersonic company just yesterday and we want to move
towards co-production,” he added.</p>
<p>“It is already starting and that is the exciting thing and it will
help relieve the stress that we see on the defense industrial base,” he
added.</p>
<p>Australia is testing a Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile (HACM) with
the United States, which it will consider as its first such weapon for
fighter jets, the defense and foreign ministers of the two countries
said after talks last week.</p>
<p>McCaul said his visit focused on the AUKUS partnership with the
United States and Britain to transfer nuclear-powered submarines to
Australia, as well as develop other advanced defense technologies.</p>
<p>The AUKUS alliance was an example of a U.S. ally spending more on its
own defense, he said, when asked if a reelected Donald Trump would
continue to back a growing U.S. defense posture in Australia, and the
sale of U.S. nuclear submarines next decade.</p>
<p>AUKUS talks had started under the Republican Trump presidency, he
added.</p>
<p>“I think there will be strong support for it,” he said.</p>
<p>Rotations of U.S. nuclear submarines through Australia under AUKUS
are a deterrent factor in the region, where the Philippines is under
pressure from China in the South China Sea, he said, after visiting the
Philippines.</p>
<p>“Chairman Xi, I think, fears this alliance more than anything else
because he knows what it means - it means that nuclear submarines will
be rotating, but also these innovative technologies that we have,” he
added, in a reference to Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p>
<p>In Beijing this week, the Chinese foreign ministry said AUKUS “harms
efforts” to keep the region peaceful and secure and exacerbates the arms
race.</p>

<h2 id="hurricane-ernesto-moves-toward-bermuda">Hurricane Ernesto moves
toward Bermuda</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — U.S. forecasters said Hurricane Ernesto
remained a category 2 storm Friday as it churns in the Atlantic Ocean on
a path toward the island of Bermuda, where it is predicted to bring high
winds, heavy rain and strong surf.</p>
<p>At last report, Ernesto was about 415 kilometers (258 miles)
south-southwest of Bermuda and was moving to the north-northeast at 20
kph (13 mph). It has maximum sustained winds of 155 kph (about 100
mph).</p>
<p>A hurricane warning remains in effect for Bermuda, where Ernesto is
expected to produce 15 to 30 centimeters (up to 12 inches) of rain with
isolated maximum amounts up 38 centimeters (15 inches). Forecasters said
this could result in considerable life-threatening flash flooding.</p>
<p>Officials in the British territory announced Thursday they would
suspend public transportation and close the airport by Friday night.
National Security Minister Michael Weeks had urged people to complete
their hurricane preparations by Thursday.</p>
<p>While forecasters initially predicted Ernesto would continue to
strengthen and possibly become a major storm — a Category 3 hurricane or
stronger — by the time it reached Bermuda, they now say that
strengthening seemingly halted overnight, although it has not lost its
punch.</p>
<p>Ernesto was expected to strengthen further Friday before it passes
near or over Bermuda sometime Saturday.</p>
<p>Forecasters said the size is generally larger than their previous
forecast, with hurricane-force winds extending outward up to 110
kilometers (68 miles) from the center and tropical-storm-force winds
extending outward up to 425 kilometers (265 miles), so the
life-threatening hazards from Ernesto are unchanged.</p>
<p>Even though Ernesto is expected to remain well off the U.S. East
Coast, forecasters said the storm is expected to generate swells along
the shoreline into the weekend. The swells could pose a significant risk
of life-threatening surf and rip currents.</p>
<p>High surf and rip currents are also possible in the northern
Caribbean along the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic,
Turks and Caicos, and the Bahamas </p>
<p>during the next few days.</p>
<p>Ernesto brought heavy wind and rain to the northern Caribbean as it
moved through Wednesday. It knocked out power, downed trees and forced
schools and businesses to close in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto
Rico, where many of the island’s businesses and homes lost power.</p>
<p>Ernesto is the fifth named storm and the third hurricane of this
year’s Atlantic hurricane season.</p>
<p>Some information for this report was provided by The Associated
Press.</p>
