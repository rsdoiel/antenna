<li>Restore toolbar button to show and hide the sidebar</li>
<li>Add keyboard shortcuts for Copy Article URL and Copy External URL menu items</li>
<li>Fix a few AppleScript support bugs</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: this version requires macOS 13 and up.</p>

<p>Also note: the equivalent update for iOS is in testing — if you’d like to help, you can <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/wpedPMRR">join the TestFlight program</a>.</p>
