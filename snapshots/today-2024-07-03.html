id="after-boosting-ties-japan-s.-korea-us-try-to-keep-them-going">After
boosting ties, Japan, S. Korea, US try to keep them going</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Seoul, South Korea — The United States, Japan and South Korea last
week held what in some ways could be seen as their most important joint
military exercise ever — and an indication of enhanced future
cooperation.</p>
<p>The inaugural Freedom Edge drill involved a U.S. aircraft carrier and
multiple Japanese and South Korean ships and planes, mirroring other
recent trilateral exercises held since the three countries intensified
defense cooperation.</p>
<p>But, importantly, this drill for the first time took place across
multiple domains, including land, sea, air and cyber — a crucial step
toward allowing the countries’ militaries to work together more
seamlessly and in a wider range of warfighting scenarios.</p>
<p>The drill reflects a bigger effort by Washington, Seoul and Tokyo,
which are trying to advance cooperation toward a more formalized stage
that will be harder for future leaders to overturn.</p>
<p>In recent months, the three countries have not only expanded the
frequency of their engagement but also taken steps to ensure that it
lasts — an attempt to solidify a partnership that could reshape
northeast Asian geopolitics.</p>
<p>The steps include establishing a regular pattern of joint military
exercises, activating a channel for sharing real-time data on North
Korean missile launches, and exploring the creation of a permanent
office to boost coordination.</p>
<p>During meetings among senior officials, the countries have also
increasingly emphasized shared values for the region, such as a “free
and open Indo-Pacific,” in the hopes of providing a more durable
foundation for cooperation.</p>
<p>The moves attempt to fulfill the vision laid out in August, when U.S.
President Joe Biden, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and South
Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol held the first standalone summit among
the leaders of the three countries.</p>
<p>South Korea key</p>
<p>A primary goal of the so-called Camp David summit was to create a
framework for collaboration that could withstand domestic political
fluctuations in each country.</p>
<p>A major concern was South Korea, where commitment to the trilateral
partnership has often wavered. Those efforts appear to be yielding
progress, according to a growing number of South Korea-based
observers.</p>
<p>“Cooperation is now entering a level of institutionalization that
will make it considerably more difficult for future administrations in
Seoul to change,” said Jeffrey Robertson, a professor of diplomatic
studies at Seoul’s Yonsei University.</p>
<p>The depth of trilateral ties has long hinged on whatever government
is in power in South Korea.</p>
<p>The South Korean left opposes closer cooperation with Japan without
more steps by Tokyo to atone for atrocities committed during its
1910-1945 colonization of Korea.</p>
<p>South Korea’s leaders also have been reluctant to sign up for any
multilateral efforts that anger China, the military and economic giant
that lies just beyond its border.</p>
<p>Changing views</p>
<p>South Korea’s outlook toward its neighbors, however, appears to be
shifting.</p>
<p>Opinion polls suggest that South Korean perceptions of China have
declined precipitously, as Beijing becomes more authoritarian at home
and more assertive in expanding its regional influence.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, views on Japan appear to be improving, especially among
young people.</p>
<p>South Korea’s national security establishment has also expressed
growing fears about North Korea, which has rapidly expanded its nuclear
arsenal and become much more hostile toward Seoul.</p>
<p>For Yoon, a conservative who took office in 2022, the solution was to
align his country more closely with the United States. Yoon also mended
ties with Japan, quickly accelerating trilateral cooperation.</p>
<p>Reasons for optimism</p>
<p>The big question is whether Yoon’s approach will outlast his
presidency, given that his predecessor, the left-leaning Moon Jae-in,
reversed many of the Japan-friendly policies of previous
administrations.</p>
<p>Peter Lee, a research fellow at the Seoul-based Asan Institute for
Policy Studies, a conservative research group, says he is optimistic.
Although he concedes that South Korean public attitudes toward Japan
remain generally unfavorable, he points to opinion polls conducted by
his organization suggesting consistently strong support for South Korean
participation in U.S.-led multilateral initiatives.</p>
<p>“This suggests that future ROK presidents will struggle to withdraw
or terminate their participation in these partnerships, at least for
populist purposes,” Lee said.</p>
<p>Another potential deterrent is that each step toward formalizing
trilateral engagement adds a layer of commitment, making it politically
riskier for any future South Korean administration to reverse, many
observers say.</p>
<p>Not so fast</p>
<p>Others think that Yoon’s policies are on much shakier ground.</p>
<p>Moon Chung-in, a senior foreign affairs adviser in multiple
left-leaning governments, rejected the notion of a permanent change in
South Koreans’ views toward their neighbors.</p>
<p>“Yoon and Biden do not see this. But Japanese political leaders are
well aware of the volatility, and that’s why they are not making major
concessions,” Moon said.</p>
<p>Seoul-Tokyo ties can “easily degenerate,” Moon maintained, unless
Japan takes further steps to address unresolved historical disputes.</p>
<p>Many in South Korea also worry that enhanced trilateral cooperation
could provoke a counter-reaction from U.S. foes in the region,
ultimately leading to increased instability.</p>
<p>As evidence, they cite last month’s decision by North Korea and
Russia to restore a Cold War-era mutual defense treaty — a move both
sides described as necessary to counter U.S. moves in Asia.</p>
<p>If the regional security dilemma worsens, some fear that China could
eventually respond by enhancing its own security cooperation with North
Korea and Russia.</p>
<p>For many South Korean liberals, the best way to avoid such a scenario
with China is to take a more cautious approach to Japan and the United
States.</p>
<p>“China is near and powerful,” Moon said. “What other options do we
have but to maintain good relations? This is common sense.”</p>

Well this was a fabulous talk, and went into the subtle problems I had
struggled with in the past (assume memory bound vs load) and I am now
quite happy with my new gained understanding.

<ol type="1">
<li>Car companies see EV growth in Q2 sales reports
</h3>
<p>
Many automakers are reporting Q2 U.S. sales and deliveries this week.
Let’s take a look at how the EV numbers are shaping up:
</p>
<p>
<strong>General Motors<br/> </strong>Deliveries: 21,930 EVs,
<a href="https://investors.gm.com/static-files/699583ff-f000-423e-ab31-ac0ef104c8b7?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8JzXo_leZod1102ulzV1J2XNHsRci7sPHpNbCC4jmytzzxnsb5HwEa7jHK650oq0gecW91" target="_blank">up
40% compared to Q2 last year,</a> and up 34% compared to Q1. EV
registrations are up 17% YTD, “outpacing the industry average of 10%.”
Sales of its LYRIQ EV were up 26% on Q1.<br/> <strong>Rivian<br/>
</strong>Deliveries: 13,790 EVs,
<a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240702827857/en/Rivian-Releases-Q2-Production-Figures-and-Sets-Date-for-Second-Quarter-2024-Results?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8JzXo_leZod1102ulzV1J2XNHsRci7sPHpNbCC4jmytzzxnsb5HwEa7jHK650oq0gecW91" target="_blank">in
line with expectations</a>. The company still expects to produce 57,000
vehicles this year.<br/> <strong>Toyota</strong> (and Lexus)<br/> Sales:
247,347 “electrified vehicles” (including hybrids). EV sales for the
entire first half of the year were up 68% and accounted for 38% of total
sales volume,
“<a href="https://pressroom.toyota.com/toyota-motor-north-america-reports-u-s-june-and-first-half-2024-sales-results/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8JzXo_leZod1102ulzV1J2XNHsRci7sPHpNbCC4jmytzzxnsb5HwEa7jHK650oq0gecW91" target="_blank">an
all-time best-ever</a>.”<br/> <strong>Kia<br/> </strong>Sales: 17,980
BEVs, up 131% year-over-year. In June, overall U.S. sales for the brand
were down 6.5% YOY, but EV sales specifically were up 125%,

</strong>Sales: 38,657 fully-electric vehicles (plus 26 hydrogen fuel
cell SUVs, fwiw) in the U.S.,

15% compared to Q2 2023</a>. IONIQ 5 sales were up 51%. KONA SUV sales
were up 26%. Hybrid sales are up 42% for the quarter.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Tesla</strong>, for its part, reported 443,956 global EV
deliveries,

its dominance.
</p>
<p>
The sales figures, while encouraging, don’t necessarily suggest EV
growth will accelerate,

told</a> <em>Reuters</em>. “We’re expecting this period of time to have
bumps along the way for the next few years as the transition goes from
early adopters to mainstream buyers and we’re going to see this happen
for a long time,” said Sam Fiorani, vice president at research firm
AutoForecast Solutions. “Some quarters will be up, some quarters will be
down, but all in all, it won’t be as strong a growth as we saw over the
last few years.”

<li>Study finds alarming glacial loss in Alaskan icefield
</h3>
<p>
Global warming is speeding up glacial ice loss in a major Alaskan
icefield, and could push the field over a tipping point sooner than
previously expected, according to
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-49269-y?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8JzXo_leZod1102ulzV1J2XNHsRci7sPHpNbCC4jmytzzxnsb5HwEa7jHK650oq0gecW91" target="_blank">a
new study</a> published in the journal <em><em>Nature
Communications</em></em>. The researchers found that the Juneau
Icefield, which covers about 1,500 square miles, is melting twice as
quickly as it was in 2010 and has lost a quarter of its ice volume since
the 18th century. “The fate of Alaska’s ice matters tremendously for the
world,”

climate reporter Raymond Zhong at <em><em>The New York Times</em></em>.
“In no other region of the planet are melting glaciers predicted to
contribute more to global sea-level rise this century.” Current melting
projections suggest ice loss for the Juneau Icefield will accelerate
after 2070, but the researchers suggest this projection may be “too
small and underestimate glacier melt in the future.”

<h2 id="ferc-is-already-split-over-the-end-of-chevron">FERC Is Already
Split Over the End of Chevron</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-03, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjUyMTg4NS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0NjYwNDMyM30.9cDwuL_uNnD9sYXdFxnklVj8Q0lnuvKnDwgJByCZgHU/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
As decades of administrative law were being rendered irrelevant last
week by a landmark Supreme Court decision
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/supreme-court-chevron#:~:text=On%20Friday%2C%20the%20Supreme%20Court,side%20in%20the%20original%20case." target="_blank">denying
regulators deference</a> in their interpretations of ambiguous legal
statues, one such regulator, Mark Christie, already had some ideas about
what do with this new development.
</p>
<p>
Christie, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s sole Republican
member, had taken issue with FERC
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/ferc-transmission-planning-rule" target="_self"><u>Order
No. 1920</u></a>, which was unveiled in May and established a new set of
rules requiring transmission planners to be more proactive in assessing
their future needs and how to pay for them<strong>.</strong> The order
was decided in a 2-1 vote along partisan lines and was largely hailed by
environmental and climate groups, who saw it as a way to encourage
building out the transmission necessary to bring more wind and solar
onto the grid.
</p>
<p>
To some conservatives, however, the order would remove states from their
rightful role in the transmission planning process and stick ratepayers
with the cost of infrastructure they never asked for. The rule is
already being challenged by
<a href="https://www.tdworld.com/overhead-transmission/article/55089651/west-virginia-commission-requests-rehearing-of-ferc-1920-transmission-rule" target="_blank"><u>state
utility commissions</u></a>,
<a href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/sites/default/files/images/press/FERC-States-Request-for-Rehearing-Filed.pdf" target="_blank"><u>Republican
state attorneys general</u></a>, and the country’s largest
<a href="https://www.pjm.com/-/media/about-pjm/who-we-are/public-disclosures/2024/20240624-pjm-board-response-to-four-govs-letter-re-ferc-order-no-1920.ashx" target="_blank"><u>regional
transmission organization</u></a> in a FERC process known as request for
rehearing. Lawsuits will almost certainly follow.
</p>
<p>
Those lawsuits will play out on the new terrain laid out by <em>Loper
Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo</em>, the Supreme Court decision rendered
last week, which overturned a decades-old legal principle known as
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/supreme-court-chevron" target="_self">Chevron
deference</a>. Named for the 1984 case <em>Chevron v. Natural Resources
Defense Council</em>, which established the notion that courts should
defer to agencies’ interpretation of ambiguous statutory language to
justify their rulemaking activity, Chevron deference formed the legal
foundation for much of the U.S. regulatory apparatus. <span></span>
</p>
<p>
In Christie’s lengthy and impassioned dissent to the order, however, he
signaled that he thought that foundation might be crumbling.
</p>
<p>
“The final rule does not deserve a shred of deference under Chevron,”
Christie wrote. Unlike past transmission planning rules that had
survived legal challenge, this new order was “pretextual” and “heavy
handed.” An earlier transmission case case that reached the Washington,
D.C. Court of Appeals in 2014, <em>South Carolina Public Service
Authority v. FERC</em>, upholding FERC’s ability to mandate transmission
planning was, Christie wrote, decided in favor of FERC because it
“upheld precisely because it was only mandating
<em><em>processes</em></em>, not <em><em>outcomes</em></em>,” whereas
the new rule “nakedly intends to produce very specific outcomes.”
Christie was basically painting a red flag on the order for the bull of
the judicial process to run through.
</p>
<p>
Once Chevron deference was no longer in force, Christie issued an update
to that dissent, writing in a statement on Friday that the “most
important legal lifeline that Order No. 1920 needed was pulled away
today, and the final rule’s chances of surviving court challenges just
shrank to slim to none.” He referred to outstanding petitions for
rehearing the order as “devastating takedowns.” Without
<em><em>Chevron</em></em> to lean on, he prognosticated, “the Commission
can wait for a court to strike down” 1920, or it can answer “those many
petitions asking for rehearing or amendments with a new opportunity for
amendments.”
</p>
<p>
In other words, the order should not have had Chevron’s protection, but
now that it doesn’t, it’s toast.
</p>
<p>
On Monday, the Commission’s Democratic Chairman Willie Phillips released
a statement (because there was nothing else going on in the legal world
that day) arguing that the Commission’s ability to regulate both
planning and the distribution of costs “has long been recognized by
bipartisan majorities of the Commission and U.S. Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia Circuit,” adding that “nothing in the Supreme
Court’s <em><em>Loper Bright </em></em>decision overturning the Chevron
doctrine calls that conclusion into question.”
</p>
<p>
He also gave a preview of how the Commission will likely defend the rule
in federal court. Order No. 1920 “fits easily within the <em>South
Carolina</em> precedent,” he wrote. “It does not promote particular
public policies, does not dictate specific outcomes, does not include
any selection mandate whatsoever, and employs only the lightest touch
possible on cost allocation by simply restating the well-established
cost causation principle.”
</p>
<p>
In conclusion, according to Phillips, Christie’s statement “does not
provide a logical or reasonable basis for calling into question whether
we have that authority in the first place.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s not every day that two FERC commissioners just decide to release
their thoughts on the latest Supreme Court case,” Ari Peskoe, the
director of the Electricity Law Initiative at Harvard Law School, told
me.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>FERC’s likely argument rests on two legal pillars. The
first is that FERC gets its authority from the Federal Power Act, which
calls for utility rates to be “just and reasonable” and not “unduly
discriminatory or preferential.” FERC has argued that this gives it
power over practices that directly affect rates, including transmission
planning, which the D.C. Circuit affirmed in <em>South Carolina</em>.
</p>
<p>
In a
<a href="https://casetext.com/case/fed-energy-regulatory-commn-v-elec-power-supply-assn" target="_blank"><u>separate
2016 case</u></a>, the Supreme Court ruled that FERC could make rules on
practices that directly affect wholesale electricity rates but not
retail sales. This case did not depend on <em>Chevron</em>, with Justice
Elena Kagan writing in her opinion that the justices “think FERC’s
authority clear.” The combined D.C. and Supreme Court precedent, Peskoe
said, adds up to FERC having “authority when something directly affects
rates.”<del></del>
</p>
<p>
But in this new legal environment, these precedents may not be enough
for a fresh case against FERC’s transmission planning authority.<br/>
</p>
<p>
“What does happen now? Who knows,” University of Richmond law professor
Joel Eisen told me. “What you would expect now is for litigants to say
that any major FERC order, including this one, is inconsistent with the
statutory authority that the agency has. They would cite <em><em>Loper
Bright</em></em> to say that the court has to make an independent
judgment that FERC has interpreted law to grant authority to do sweeping
change to transmission planning, and that is simply no longer the case,”
Eisen said.<strong><em> </em></strong><br/>
</p>
<p>
Much of FERC’s more than 1,300-page order is devoted to detailed
analysis of the electricity market as it stands now and how it will
evolve over time, justifying the new transmission planning rules. It’s
this record, Eisen said, that might let the order survive in a
post-<em>Chevron</em> world, even when FERC asserting that the Federal
Power Act gives it the right to set rules may be insufficient on its
own.
</p>
<p>
“That may not have been done as an explicit nod to whether a court might
uphold it under <em><em>Chevron</em></em> going forward. “It seems to me
at least that in this new landscape, what will matter is the robustness
of the agency grounded in its expertise,” Eisen told me. “The voluminous
record supporting 1920 may be persuasive to a federal court.”
</p>
<p>
But, as Eisen and Peskoe both warned, <em>which</em> federal court may
be as important — if not more so — than any argument FERC makes.
</p>
<p>
Will FERC’s arguments about the nature of the electricity market and
precedents relating to interpretation of the Federal Power Act fly in,
say, a Texas federal court in the Fifth Circuit, where state utility
commissions or Republican attorneys general may file suit? District and
appeals court judges in the Fifth Circuit have shown great eagerness to
throw out Biden-era rules, with a federal judge in Louisiana only this
week
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/07/01/liquefied-natural-gas-exports-court-ruling/" target="_blank"><u>blocking
the Biden administration’s pause</u></a> on approving new natural gas
export terminals.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>“If it goes to the Fifth Circuit,” Peskoe said, “that will
be bad news.”

Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Robinson Meyer</strong>: Can you give me a compare-contrast on
how European policymakers used to think about climate change versus how
they’re thinking about it now?<br/> <br/> <strong>Ann Mettler</strong>:
Well, as I said, they used to approach them primarily through, we will
decarbonize our economy and then, you know, we’ve done our job. But
again, going back to the 8% of global CO2 emissions, it’s a drop in the
bucket. So, I mean, we really needed to have the focus on global
emissions and how we can help address these.<br/> <br/> But coming back
to your original question, Europe has had two really major shocks. One
is obviously 2022, the war in Ukraine breaks out. We have the most
serious energy crisis, acute security crisis, we’ve frankly ever had,
since the Second World War. And so energy resilience and security are
now very important issues. <br/> <br/> Then the second big shock — of
course on a different magnitude — was really the Americans getting into
the climate game. The IRA was sort of a thunderclap on this side of the
Atlantic. I honestly cannot say how … it was a moment of humility that
within one legislative mandate, the U.S. could really put itself out
there and become something that … I think it’s a very serious competitor
in this space. <br/> <br/> Of course, I personally think that we
shouldn’t think in terms of competition because the fact is that both
Europe and the United States are behind. So I think if we had a more
joined up approach, it would create bottomless opportunity to accelerate
the energy transition on both sides of the Atlantic. <br/> <br/>
<strong>Meyer</strong>: It is funny because I do feel like, to some
degree, Europe was a little — it was surprising to me how much Europe
was taken by surprise by the IRA. When the IRA passed, I remember
reading the European press, and then a lot of the initial coverage was
around business tax rates and stuff, just relatively fiddly aspects of
the law that we don’t talk about anymore. And then it felt like it took
a few months — it was until November that I remember Macron talking
about it during a visit to the U.S. — that it felt like the continent
even began to realize the scale of what the U.S. was trying to do with
the law.<br/> <br/> <strong>Aliya Haq</strong>: I’ll say as a, you know,
aging, grizzled climate activist, that after the Inflation Reduction Act
passed, we’re so used to being behind Europe and … you know, decades and
decades of trying and never getting further, and then having a law
passed that we could then say with a straight face, we’ve taken the
largest climate action in global history, that really did feel
good.<br/> <br/> But I was glad that, you know, that initial reaction,
this kind of race to the bottom — like, how dare you, this isn’t good
for global competitiveness — and eventually the Europeans kind of coming
around realizing, well, wait, we’ve wanted the U.S. to take action for a
while, maybe this is a good thing, was funny.

<p>date: 2024-07-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>R9 is a work-in-progress effort to build a Plan 9 kernel to Rust. It
was started a couple years back by the maintainers of the Harvey OS
distribution of Plan 9, who threw in the towel after “loss of traction”.
R9 is a reimplementation of the plan9 kernel in Rust. It is not only
inspired by but in many ways derived from the original Plan 9 source
code. ↫ R9OS GitHub page For now, the project is obviously mostly
focused on running in virtual machines, specifically Qemu, in which it
can be run using a variety of architectures: aarch64, x86-64 (with or
without kvm), and RISC-V.</p>

id="what-was-the-first-american-novel-on-this-independence-day-a-look-at-what-it-started">What
was the ‘first American novel’? On this Independence Day, a look at what
it started</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — In the winter of 1789, around the time George Washington
was elected the country’s first president, a Boston-based printer
quietly launched another American institution.</p>
<p>William Hill Brown’s The Power of Sympathy, published anonymously by
Isaiah Thomas &amp; Company, is widely cited as something momentous: the
first American novel.</p>
<p>Around 100 pages long, Brown’s narrative tells of two young New
Englanders whose love affair abruptly and tragically ends when they
learn a shocking secret that makes their relationship unbearable. The
dedication page, addressed to the “Young Ladies of United Columbia” (the
United States), promised an exposé of “the Fatal consequences of
Seduction” and a prescription for the “Economy of Human Life.”</p>
<p>Outside of Boston society, though, few would have known or cared
whether The Power of Sympathy marked any kind of literary milestone.</p>
<p>“If you picked 10 random citizens, I doubt it would have mattered to
any of them,” says David Lawrimore, an associate professor of English at
the University of Idaho who has written often about early U.S.
literature. “Most people weren’t thinking about the first American
novel.”</p>
<p>What the first American novel was like</p>
<p>Subtitled The Triumph of Nature. Founded in Truth, Brown’s book is in
many ways characteristic of the era, whether its epistolary format, its
Anglicized prose, its unidentified author, or its pious message. But The
Power of Sympathy also includes themes that reflected the aspirations
and anxieties of a young country and still resonate now.</p>
<p>Dana McClain, an assistant professor of English at Holy Family
University, notes that Brown was an outspoken Federalist, believing in a
strong national government, and shared his contemporaries’ preoccupation
with forging how a stable republican citizenry. The letters in The Power
of Sympathy include reflections on class, temperament and the
differences between North and South, notably the “aristocratic temper”
of Southern slaveholders that endangered “domestic quietude,” as if
anticipating the next century’s Civil War.</p>
<p>Like many other early American writers, fiction and nonfiction, Brown
tied the behavior of women to the fate of the larger society. The
novel’s correspondents fret about the destabilizing “power of pleasure”
and how female envy “inundates the land with a flood of scandal.” Virtue
is likened to a “mighty river” that “fertilizes the country through
which it passes and increases in magnitude and force until it empty
itself into the ocean.”</p>
<p>Brown also examines at length the ways novels might be a path to
corruption or a vehicle to uplift, mirroring current debates over the
banning and restrictions of books in schools and libraries.</p>
<p>“Most of the novels with which our female libraries are overrun are
built upon on a foundation not always placed on strict morality, and in
the pursuit of of objects not always probable or praiseworthy,” one of
Brown’s characters warns. “Novels, not regulated on the chaste
principles of true friendship, rational love, and connubial duty, appear
to me totally unfit to form the minds of women, of friends, or of
wives.”</p>
<p>Brown was likely more interested in shaping minds than in literary
glory.</p>
<p>“The Great American Novel” is a favorite catchphrase but wasn’t
coined until the 1860s. During Brown’s lifetime, novels were a
relatively crude art form and were valued mostly for satire, light
entertainment or moral instruction. Few writers identified themselves as
“novelists”: Brown was known as a poet, and essayist and the composer of
an opera.</p>
<p>Even he recognized the book’s lower stature, writing in the novel’s
preface: “This species of writing hath not been received with universal
approbation.”</p>
<p>How it became considered the first</p>
<p>The Power of Sympathy was commonly cited as the first American novel
in the 1800s, but few bothered debating it until the 20th century.
Scholars then agreed that honors should belong to the first written and
published in the United States by an author born and still residing in
the country.</p>
<p>Those guidelines disqualified such earlier works as Charlotte Ramsay
Lennox’s The Life of Harriot Stuart and Thomas Atwood Digges’ Adventures
of Alonso.</p>
<p>Another contender was Father Bombo’s Pilgrimage to Mecca, a prose
adventure by college students Hugh Henry Brackenridge and Philip
Freneau, both of whom went on to prominent public careers. Written
around 1770, the manuscript was later believed lost and wasn’t published
in full until 1975.</p>
<p>Brown’s novel was unexamined for so long that only in the late 19th
century did the public even discover he had written it. Many had
credited the Boston poet Sarah Wentworth Apthorp Morton, whose family
had endured a scandal similar to the one in The Power of Sympathy.</p>
<p>In 1894-95, editor Arthur W. Brayley of the Bostonian serialized the
novel in his magazine, identifying Morton as the author. But after being
contacted by Brown’s niece, Rebecca Vollentine Thompson, Brayley
published a lengthy correction, titled “The Real Author of the Power of
Sympathy.”</p>
<p>Thompson herself added a preface to a 1900 reissue, noting that Brown
was close to Morton’s family and alleging that the publication had been
“suppressed” because Brown had bared an “unfortunate scandal.”</p>
<p>A clockmaker’s son, Brown was a Boston native, likely born in 1765.
He was well-read, connected, culturally conservative and politically
minded; one of his first published writings was an unflattering poem
about Daniel Shays, the namesake for the 1786-87 rebellion of
impoverished Revolutionary War veterans in Massachusetts. Brown is also
the author of several posthumous releases, including the play The
Treason of Arnold and the novel Ira and Isabella.</p>
<p>His unofficial standing as “America’s First Novelist” did not lead to
broader fame. The novel, currently in print through a 1996 edition from
Penguin Classics, remains more of interest to specialists and
antiquarians than to general readers.</p>
<p>Brown was not yet 30 when he died in North Carolina, in 1793, from
what is believed to be malaria. He apparently never married or had
children. No memorials or other historical sites are dedicated to him.
No literary societies have been formed in his name.</p>
<p>His burial site is unknown.</p>

id="robert-towne-oscar-winning-writer-of-chinatown-dies-at-89">Robert
Towne, Oscar-winning writer of ‘Chinatown,’ dies at 89</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Robert Towne, the Oscar-winning screenplay writer of
“Shampoo,” “The Last Detail” and other acclaimed films whose work on
“Chinatown” became a model of the art form and helped define the jaded
allure of his native Los Angeles, has died. He was 89.</p>
<p>Towne died Monday surrounded by family at his home in Los Angeles,
said publicist Carri McClure. She declined to comment on a cause of
death.</p>
<p>In an industry that gave birth to rueful jokes about the writer’s
status, Towne for a time held prestige comparable to the actors and
directors he worked with.</p>
<p>Through his friendships with two of the biggest stars of the 1960s
and ’70s, Warren Beatty and Jack Nicholson, he wrote or co-wrote some of
the signature films of an era when artists held an unusual level of
creative control.</p>
<p>The rare “auteur” among screen writers, Towne managed to bring a
highly personal and influential vision of Los Angeles onto the
screen.</p>
<p>“It’s a city that’s so illusory,” Towne told The Associated Press in
a 2006 interview. “It’s the westernmost west of America. It’s a sort of
place of last resort. It’s a place where, in a word, people go to make
their dreams come true. And they’re forever disappointed.”</p>
<p>Recognizable around Hollywood for his high forehead and full beard,
Towne won an Academy Award for “Chinatown” and was nominated three other
times, for “The Last Detail,” “Shampoo” and “Greystoke.” In 1997, he
received a lifetime achievement award from the Writers Guild of
America.</p>
<p>“His life, like the characters he created, was incisive, iconoclastic
and entirely (original),” said “Shampoo” actor Lee Grant on X.</p>
<p>Towne’s success came after a long stretch of working in television,
including “The Man from U.N.C.L.E” and “The Lloyd Bridges Show,” and on
low-budget movies for “B” producer Roger Corman. In a classic show
business story, he owed his breakthrough in part to his psychiatrist,
through whom he met Beatty, a fellow patient. As Beatty worked on
“Bonnie and Clyde,” he brought in Towne for revisions of the Robert
Benton-David Newman script and had him on the set while the movie was
filmed in Texas.</p>
<p>Towne’s contributions were uncredited for “Bonnie and Clyde,” the
landmark crime film released in 1967, and for years he was a favorite
ghost writer. He helped out on “The Godfather,” “The Parallax View” and
“Heaven Can Wait” among others and referred to himself as a “relief
pitcher who could come in for an inning, not pitch the whole game.”</p>
<p>But Towne was credited by name for Nicholson’s macho “The Last
Detail” and Beatty’s sex comedy “Shampoo” and was immortalized by
“Chinatown,” the 1974 thriller set during the Great Depression.</p>
<p>“Chinatown” was directed by Roman Polanski and starred Nicholson as
J.J. “Jake” Gittes, a private detective asked to follow the husband of
Evelyn Mulwray (played by Faye Dunaway). The husband is chief engineer
of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, and Gittes finds
himself caught in a chaotic spiral of corruption and violence, embodied
by Evelyn’s ruthless father, Noah Cross (John Huston).</p>
<p>Influenced by the fiction of Raymond Chandler, Towne resurrected the
menace and mood of a classic Los Angeles film noir but cast Gittes’
labyrinthine odyssey across a grander and more insidious portrait of
Southern California. Clues accumulate into a timeless detective tale and
lead helplessly to tragedy, summed up by one of the most repeated lines
in movie history, words of grim fatalism a devastated Gittes receives
from his partner Lawrence Walsh (Joe Mantell): “Forget it, Jake, it’s
Chinatown.”</p>

high heat builds in California, south central US</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>sacramento, california — Swaths of California sweltered Tuesday and
things were only expected to get worse during the Fourth of July holiday
week for parts of the United States with nearly 90 million people under
heat alerts.</p>
<p>The torrid conditions were being caused by a ridge of high pressure
just off the West Coast and a separate ridge that spawned heat warnings
and advisories from Kansas and Missouri to the Gulf Coast states,
according to the National Weather Service.</p>
<p>California’s capital, Sacramento, was under an excessive heat warning
expected to last until Sunday night, with temperatures forecasted to
reach between 40.5-46 Celsius (105-115 Farenheit).</p>
<p>John Mendoza, 35, called it a “firehose of heat” as he walked around
the Capitol on Tuesday morning with an iced coffee in his hand. By 9
a.m., he had already been in a pool once — and planned to go back later
in the day.</p>
<p>“I felt like I needed to be submerged in water,” he said.</p>
<p>Darlene Crumedy of Fairfield, about an hour’s drive from Sacramento,
said she doesn’t use air conditioning because it’s too expensive.</p>
<p>“I’m good, I have a hundred fans,” she said, adding she tries to stay
inside and drink cold water.</p>
<p>An analysis by The Associated Press found that heat killed more than
2,300 people in the U.S. last year, setting a record. That figure is
likely a major undercount, dozens of experts told AP reporters.</p>
<p>Dr. Arthur Jey, an emergency services physician with Sutter Health in
Sacramento, told reporters that getting out of the heat is important,
along with wearing a hat and loose clothes, hydration and watching out
for signs of heat stroke.</p>
<p>“With heat stroke, it looks like a stroke,” Jey said, describing
symptoms that may include acting unusual, significant headaches, blurry
vision, profuse sweating and then no sweating.</p>
<p>“And that’s a really big deal,” Jey said. “So we want to prevent them
getting even close to heat stroke.”</p>
<p>California’s heat was expected to spread from north to south over the
week, with the worst of it focused on interior areas including the
Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys and the southern deserts. But
warnings extended out to just short of the coast.</p>
<p>The heat arrived with gusty, dry winds in the northern part of the
state, where the utility Pacific Gas &amp; Electric implemented public
safety power shutoffs in parts of 10 counties to prevent wildfires from
being ignited by downed or damaged electrical wires.</p>
<p>PG&amp;E said about 12,000 customers were told their power could be
cut and given information about centers where they could obtain ice,
water, snacks, Wi-Fi and other necessities.</p>
<p>California has had a spate of spring and early summer wildfires
feeding on abundant grasses spawned by back-to-back wet winters. The
largest current blaze, dubbed the Basin Fire, was 17% contained Tuesday
after charring more than 54 square kilometers of the Sierra National
Forest in eastern Fresno County.</p>

rules to protects migrant shelter on US-Mexico border, accuses Texas of
harassment</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>McAllen, Texas — A judge blasted efforts by Texas Attorney General
Ken Paxton to shutter one of the oldest and largest migrant shelters on
the U.S.-Mexico border in a scathing ruling Tuesday, accusing the
Republican of “outrageous” conduct over his claims that the shelter
encourages migrants to enter the country illegally.</p>
<p>Judge Francisco X. Dominguez ruled that Paxton’s attempts to enforce
a subpoena for records of migrants who have been served at Annunciation
House in the past few years violated the El Paso shelter’s
constitutional rights. The judge’s ruling prevents Paxton from seeking
the records and protects the shelter from what Dominguez called
“harassment and overreaching” by Paxton’s office.</p>
<p>Paxton’s office did not respond to requests for comment, but the
state is expected to appeal.</p>
<p>Annunciation House is one of several nonprofit groups that help
migrants from which Paxton’s office has sought information in recent
months. Team Brownsville, which assists migrants who are dropped off by
federal agents in the border city of Brownsville, received a letter
demanding documents in May. Paxton is also suing Catholic Charities of
the Rio Grande Valley seeking testimony.</p>
<p>Dominguez wrote that he previously expressed concern that Paxton’s
office had not identified which laws Annunciation House was allegedly
breaking.</p>
<p>“The record before this Court makes clear that the Texas Attorney
General’s use of the request to examine documents from Annunciation
House was a pretext to justify its harassment of Annunciation House
employees and the persons seeking refuge,” he wrote.</p>
<p>“In fact, the record before the Court now establishes that the
Attorney General was seeking evidence of alleged criminal activity all
along,” Dominguez continued. “This is outrageous and intolerable.”</p>
<p>Paxton alleged that by providing shelter to migrants regardless of
their legal status, Annunciation House was facilitating illegal
immigration and human smuggling, and operating a stash house.</p>
<p>State officials visited the El Paso shelter in early February
demanding immediate access to records — including medical and
immigration documents — of migrants who had received services there
since 2022. Officials from Annunciation House, a Catholic nonprofit that
oversees a network of shelters, said they were willing to comply but
needed time to determine what they could legally share without violating
their clients’ constitutional rights.</p>
<p>Investigators who sought to access records the day after requesting
entry were not allowed inside the shelter. Jerry Wesevich, the attorney
representing Annunciation House, said that corporations under the
Constitution’s Fourth Amendment are protected from unreasonable searches
and seizures by the government.</p>
<p>Wesevich expressed relief after the ruling and said it could affect
other organizations. He also questioned why Paxton wanted to close the
shelter.</p>
<p>“All that’s going to mean is more people in El Paso streets. Who does
that help? All it does is provide a narrative of chaos on the border,
which is a narrative that some people politically want to promote,”
Wesevich said.</p>

approves 2nd Alzheimer’s drug that modestly slows disease</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. officials have approved another Alzheimer’s drug
that can modestly slow the disease, providing a new option for patients
in the early stages of the incurable, memory-destroying ailment. </p>
<p>The Food and Drug Administration approved Eli Lilly’s Kisunla on
Tuesday for mild or early cases of dementia caused by Alzheimer’s. It’s
only the second drug that’s been convincingly shown to delay cognitive
decline in patients, following last year’s approval of a similar drug
from Japanese drugmaker Eisai. </p>
<p>The delay seen with both drugs amounts to a matter of months — about
seven months, in the case of Lilly’s drug. Patients and their families
will have to weigh that benefit against the downsides, including regular
IV infusions and potentially dangerous side effects like brain
swelling. </p>
<p>Physicians who treat Alzheimer’s say the approval is an important
step after decades of failed experimental treatments. </p>
<p>“I’m thrilled to have different options to help my patients,” said
Dr. Suzanne Schindler, a neurologist at Washington University in
St. Louis. “It’s been difficult as a dementia specialist — I diagnose my
patients with Alzheimer’s and then every year I see them get worse and
they progress until they die.” </p>
<p>Both Kisunla and the Japanese drug, Leqembi, are laboratory-made
antibodies, administered by IV, that target one contributor to
Alzheimer’s: sticky amyloid plaque buildup in the brain. Questions
remain about which patients should get the drugs and how long they might
benefit. </p>
<p>The new drug’s approval was expected after an outside panel of FDA
advisers unanimously voted in favor of its benefits at a public meeting
last month. That endorsement came despite several questions from FDA
reviewers about how Lilly studied the drug, including allowing patients
to discontinue treatment after their plaque reached very low
levels. </p>
<p>Costs will vary by patient, based on how long they take the drug,
Lilly said. The company also said a year’s worth of therapy would cost
$32,000 — more than the $26,500 price of a year’s worth of Leqembi. </p>
<p>The FDA’s prescribing information tells doctors they can consider
stopping the drug after confirming via brain scans that patients have
minimal plaque. </p>
<p>More than 6 million Americans have Alzheimer’s. Only those with early
or mild disease will be eligible for the new drug, and an even smaller
subset are likely to undergo the multistep process needed to get a
prescription. </p>
<p>The FDA approved Kisunla, known chemically as donanemab, based on
results from an 18-month study in which patients given the treatment
declined about 22% more slowly in terms of memory and cognitive ability
than those who received a dummy infusion. </p>
<p>The main safety issue was brain swelling and bleeding, a problem
common to all plaque-targeting drugs. The rates reported in Lilly’s
study, including 20% of patients with microbleeds, were slightly higher
than those reported with competitor Leqembi. However, the two drugs were
tested in slightly different types of patients, which experts say makes
it difficult to compare the drugs’ safety. </p>
<p>Kisunla is infused once a month compared to Leqembi’s twice-a-month
regimen, which could make things easier for caregivers who bring their
loved ones to a hospital or clinic for treatment.</p>

id="satellite-imagery-shows-china-expanding-spy-bases-in-cuba">Satellite
imagery shows China expanding spy bases in Cuba</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — New satellite images of Cuba show signs the country is
installing improved intelligence capabilities at four military bases
with suspected links to China, potentially providing Beijing with a
network of facilities that could be used to spy on the United
States.</p>
<p>The imagery, presented in a report Tuesday by the Washington-based
Center for Strategic and International Studies, was taken in March and
April. It indicated new or recent construction at three sites near the
capital, Havana, as well as work on a previously unreported site not far
from the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay.</p>
<p>“Without access to classified materials, pinpointing the specific
targets of these assets is nearly impossible,” the report said.
“Nonetheless, the growth of space-monitoring equipment at sites like
Bejucal and Calabazar is notable given that Cuba lacks its own
satellites or space program.”</p>
<p>Bejucal is the largest of the four sites, according to CSIS analysts
and first came to prominence during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, when
the base was used to store nuclear weapons for the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>More recently, it has gained prominence as a major signals
intelligence monitoring station, suspected to be tracking electronic
communications for China.</p>
<p>The new satellite pictures show evidence that Bejucal has seen
expansive updates, including a new electronic antenna enclosure.</p>
<p>Two other sites near Havana — Wajay and Calabazar — have seen growth
as well, with CSIS analysts citing evidence of an expanding and evolving
mission, including the installation of antennae, radar dishes and other
equipment that could help those using it to monitor satellites.</p>
<p>The final site, El Salao, appears to be still under construction. But
its location, not far from the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay near
the city of Santiago de Cuba, and the structures themselves, could be
cause for concern for the U.S.</p>
<p>The imagery collected by CSIS shows progress on what appears to be an
antenna array with a diameter of 130 to 200 meters (425 to 655 feet).
Similar arrays, according to the analysts, have shown the ability to
track signals up to 15,000 kilometers (9,300 miles).</p>
<p>The U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to
comment on the CSIS report. But it follows a report last year by The
Wall Street Journal that China was paying Cuba several billion dollars
to build a spy facility.</p>
<p>U.S. officials later said that China had upgraded its intelligence
facilities in Cuba in 2019 but that U.S. pushback had prevented Beijing
from achieving its goals.</p>
<p>“We’re confident that we can continue to meet our security
commitments,” said Pentagon press secretary Major General Pat Ryder
while briefing reporters Tuesday.</p>
<p>“We know that the PRC [People’s Republic of China] is going to
continue to try to enhance its presence in Cuba, and we will continue to
keep working to disrupt that,” he said in response to a question from
VOA. “We’re continuing to monitor this closely, taking steps to counter
it.”</p>
<p>China on Tuesday rejected the findings of the CSIS report, with the
spokesperson of the Chinese Embassy in Washington calling them “nothing
but slander.”</p>
<p>“The U.S. side has repeatedly hyped-up China’s establishment of spy
bases or conducting surveillance activities in Cuba,” Liu Pengyu told
VOA in an email.</p>
<p>“The U.S. should immediately stop its malicious smearing of China,”
Liu said, adding, “The U.S. is no doubt the leading power in terms of
eavesdropping and does not even spare its Allies [sic].”</p>
<p>Cuba also pushed back against the CSIS report, singling out a
write-up in The Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p>“Without citing a verifiable source or showing evidence, it seeks to
scare the public with legends about Chinese military bases that do not
exist and no one has seen,” according to a post by Cuban Deputy Foreign
Minister Carlos Fernandez de Cossio on the X social media platform.</p>
<p>The CSIS report says monitoring stations in Cuba could help China to
acquire needed capabilities and insights as it tries to militarily
surpass the United States.</p>
<p>“Collecting data on activities like military exercises, missile
tests, rocket launches, and submarine maneuvers would allow China to
develop a more sophisticated picture of U.S. military practices,” the
report said.</p>
<p>“Cuban facilities would also provide the ability to monitor radio
traffic and potentially intercept data delivered by U.S. satellites as
they pass over highly sensitive military sites across the southern
United States,” the report said.</p>
<p>Such monitoring stations could also help China gain access to what
the report describes as a “treasure trove of data” from commercial
communications transiting the southeastern U.S.</p>

Commission shoots down Facebook’s “pay or consent” model</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-02, from: OS News</p>
<p>The European Union’s Digital Markets Act is the gift that keeps on
giving. This time, it’s Facebook’s turn to be slapped on the fingers
with a ruler – a metric ruler, of course – because of its malicious
compliance with the DMA. Today, the Commission has informed Meta of its
preliminary findings that its “pay or consent” advertising model fails
to comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA). In the Commission’s
preliminary view, this binary choice forces users to consent to the
combination of their personal data and fails to provide them a less
personalised but equivalent version of Meta’s social networks. ↫
European Commission press release The European Commission’s preliminary
conclusion takes issue with Facebook’s binary choice between “pay for
zero ads” and “full-on tracking and all the ads”. According to the DMA,
Facebook must offer users the option of an equivalent experience with
less tracking, and the company doesn’t offer such an option to users. In
addition, Facebook’s proposal does not allow users to “exercise their
right to freely consent to the combination of their personal data”. It’s
important to note that this is not some sort of definitive ruling of
finding; it’s preliminary, and Facebook now has the opportunity to state
its case and formulate its arguments. If the eventual ruling is that
Facebook does not comply, the company is liable for fines up to 10% of
its yearly worldwide turnover, which can rise up to 20% for repeated
infractions.</p>

id="exiled-hong-kong-activists-feel-strain-after-bounty-imposed-on-them">Exiled
Hong Kong activists feel strain after bounty imposed on them</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS — Two exiled Hong Kong activists say bounties
imposed on them last year are causing fear and anxiety as they conduct
their advocacy work from U.S. soil amid concerns for their safety.</p>
<p>Anna Kwok expected to face retaliation from the Hong Kong government
when she became the executive director of the Washington-based advocacy
organization Hong Kong Democracy Council in November 2022. Hong Kong
authorities imposed a bounty on her and seven others on July 3,
2023.</p>
<p>Frances Hui, who is the policy and advocacy coordinator for the
U.S.-based Committee for Freedom in Hong Kong Foundation, was one of an
additional five who had bounties imposed on them in December.</p>
<p>The 13 are accused of violating a controversial national security law
that went into effect in the former British colony in July 2020.</p>
<p>Despite being mentally prepared, Hui and Kwok said they felt shocked
when the Hong Kong government issued arrest warrants and bounties worth
$127,635 for them and the other overseas Hong Kong activists last year.
Hui said the bounty felt like “a death certificate” as it confirmed she
would not be able to set foot in Hong Kong again.</p>
<p>“After learning about the bounty imposed against me, I suddenly felt
like everything was out of my control because I could no longer get in
touch with my family and close people in Hong Kong,” she said, adding
that the event pushed her life onto a completely different path.</p>
<p>“I’m officially a wanted fugitive, and whoever in Hong Kong is
associated with me will get into trouble,” Hui told VOA by phone.</p>
<p>While Hui described the experience as “jarring and shocking,” Kwok
said she didn’t realize how the bounties could affect her until her bank
account in Hong Kong was frozen.</p>
<p>“At first, I was surprised for only 10 seconds and immediately went
into work mode, thinking about how to use this incident to advance our
advocacy agenda in media interviews,” said Kwok.</p>
<p>“When I checked my Hong Kong bank account at 11 p.m. on July 3, 2023,
I noticed my asserts were frozen and I suddenly realized the real-life
implications of the bounty on my head,” Kwok told VOA by phone.</p>
<p>These activists “betrayed their country, betrayed Hong Kong,
disregarded the interests of Hong Kong people, and continue to endanger
national security even when abroad,” the chief superintendent of Hong
Kong’s National Security Department, Li Kwai-wah, said at a December 14
press conference.</p>
<p>Eric Lai, a research fellow at Georgetown University’s Center for
Asian Law in the United States, said the Hong Kong government hopes to
create a chilling effect that will further disconnect people in Hong
Kong from overseas activists by issuing arrest warrants and
bounties.</p>
<p>“It’s a silencing tactic to both people around the bounty holders and
the bounty holders themselves,” he told VOA by phone, adding that it is
part of the Hong Kong government’s efforts to surveil, harass and
intimidate political dissidents in exile.</p>
<p>In addition to imposing bounties on more than a dozen activists, Hong
Kong authorities canceled the passports of overseas activists last
month. In the U.K., three men were charged in May with spying on members
of the Hong Kong diaspora community on behalf of the territory’s
intelligence service.</p>
<p>Threat to mental health, personal safety</p>
<p>Apart from targeting overseas activists, Hong Kong authorities have
interrogated family members of the activists, including Hui’s mother and
Kwok’s brothers and parents.</p>
<p>Hui said the interrogations of her family members made her realize
that her activism abroad could affect those who are still in Hong Kong.
She said that is one way that Hong Kong authorities have limited her
freedom.</p>
<p>“It’s a very lonely experience to know that whatever I do could be
connected to people who are associated with me; but I also know that if
I stop my activism now, that’s exactly what the Chinese Communist Party
would want, to intimidate and silence me,” she said.</p>
<p>In addition to the sense of loneliness, Hui said the bounty has
increased her fear of threats to her safety.</p>
<p>“I have become extra cautious about talking to people, even those in
the Hong Kong diaspora community, and my heightened sensitivity toward
security issues has also contributed to my increased level of anxiety,”
she said, adding that she is trying hard not to let fear dictate her
advocacy work.</p>
<p>As for Kwok, the fear for her safety became real when she began to
receive death threats shortly before leaders convened for an
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, held in November in San
Francisco. At the time, she was planning to attend protest rallies
against Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p>
<p>“I started receiving death threats and threats of raping me in my
inbox, and those accounts are not afraid of using brutal language or
insinuating physical harm against me,” she told VOA. She said the
messages would appear in her inbox in a coordinated fashion.</p>
<p>While she was shocked about the explicitness of those threats, she
tried to take steps to rein in her fear, including maintaining regular
contact with close friends, playing with her cats or diving into the
world of fiction.</p>
<p>These steps “help to assure me that things are okay and I’m doing
something impactful, which is an important realization to me,” Kwok
said.</p>
<p>Despite their efforts to overcome the fear created by the bounties,
Hui and Kwok say the Hong Kong government’s efforts to launch
transnational repression are a threat to the entire diaspora
community.</p>
<p>“I think my personal experience shows that there are still many gaps
in implementing protection mechanisms against transnational repression
in many countries,” Kwok said, adding that the moves initiated by Hong
Kong authorities are damaging trust within the diaspora community.</p>
<p>While Hong Kong authorities try to isolate some overseas activists,
Hui said she will continue to concentrate her advocacy efforts on
speaking up for activists who have been imprisoned in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>“There is a sense of mission for me, and I hope I can continue to
advocate for those who can’t,” she said.</p>
<p>In response to criticisms made by the activists, the Hong Kong
government said the extraterritorial effect of the national security law
is fully in line with the principles of international law and common
practices adopted by several countries.</p>
<p>“Absconders should not think they can evade criminal liability by
absconding from Hong Kong, [because] ultimately, they will be held
accountable for their acts constituting serious offences endangering
national security and be sanctioned by law,” a Hong Kong government
spokesperson told VOA in a written response.</p>

the Supreme Court Just Changed Climate Law, According to 9 Lawyers</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-02, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
The word “consequential” barely touches the importance of the Supreme
Court’s decisions this term, as two cases — <em>Loper Bright Enterprises
v. Raimondo</em> and <em>Corner Post, Inc. v. Board of Governors</em> —
took a wrecking ball to the stability of the administrative state.
Courts will no longer give deference to regulators to interpret statute
and will permit new challenges against existing rules. Essentially,
depending on whom you ask, anything goes.
</p>
<p>
So naturally, we had to ask. While the legal universe is still digesting
these rulings, climate and environmental law experts had plenty of
opinions about them, as lawyers tend to do. Here’s what we heard:
</p>
<h3>
Michael Gerrard, professor and faculty director at the Sabin Center for
Climate Change Law, Columbia Law School
</h3>
<p>
The Supreme Court has been on a campaign to weaken environmental
regulation. In 2016, it halted implementation of President Obama’s Clean
Power Plan without explanation. In 2022, it issued the devastating
opinion in <em><em>West Virginia v. Environmental Protection
Agency</em></em>, finding that the EPA couldn’t go very far in using the
Clean Air Act to fight climate change because the statute isn’t specific
enough. In 2023, the court in <em><em>Sackett v. EPA</em></em> greatly
reduced the coverage of the Clean Water Act.
</p>
<p>
That campaign intensified this year. On June 27, 2024, in <em><em>Ohio
v. EPA</em></em>, it struck down a life-saving Clean Air Act rule based
on exceedingly narrow technical grounds that Justice Amy Coney Barrett,
in her dissent, found were completely off base. The same day, in
<em><em>SEC v. Jarkesy</em></em>, the Court said that agencies could not
use long-established administrative processes to impose certain kinds of
penalties. On June 28, the court reversed the Chevron doctrine in
<em><em>Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo</em></em>. On July 1, in
<em><em>Corner Post, Inc. v. Board of Governors</em></em>, it said that
corporate defendants can challenge federal regulations long past the
usual statute of limitations. And this campaign may continue: on June 24
the Supreme Court agreed to hear <em><em>Seven County Infrastructure
Coalition v. Eagle County</em></em>, which may shrink the coverage of
the National Environmental Policy Act.
</p>
<p>
The next election will determine whether the 6-3 conservative majority
may be enlarged and rejuvenated to last another generation, or —
depending on the fates — may shrink or be reversed.
</p>
<h3>
Scott Lemieux, professor of political science at the University of
Washington
</h3>
<p>
For good reason, the last day of the Supreme Court’s term will be known
for its decision giving presidents incredibly broad immunity from
criminal prosecution. But another decision that will play a major role
in restricting the ability of the executive branch to protect the
environment should not be neglected. <em><em>Corner Post
</em></em>effectively eliminated what had been a six-year statute of
limitations for challenging federal regulations. The impact of
<em><em>Corner Post</em></em> will amplify the effect of last week’s
opinion overturning the <em><em>Chevron</em></em> decision, which had
held that the judiciary should defer to reasonable legal interpretations
made by the executive branch.
</p>
<p>
The Court announcing that it will take a much more aggressive role in
replacing the judgment of regulatory experts in the executive branch
with their own judgments will have particularly dire consequences for
environmental regulations. What they see as “excessive” environmental
regulation is one of the central reasons why conservative legal
activists wanted the Chevron doctrine overruled. It’s not a coincidence
that last week, the court also prevented a federal regulation of air
pollutants from going into effect, one of a long series of Roberts court
rulings undermining environmental regulation. And in a darkly comic
illustration of what a bad idea it is to replace the judgment of EPA
experts with that of arrogant, power-hungry judges, in his opinion for
the court, Justice Gorsuch confused “nitrous oxide” (commonly known as
“laughing gas”) and “nitrogen oxides” (the pollutant the EPA sought to
regulate.)
</p>
<p>
People who want to stop environmental regulation will not be laughing
when considering the effects of this Supreme Court term. Conservative
lawyers will aggressively forum-shop for judges hostile to environmental
regulations to bring challenges even to long-settled rules, and the
authority of the EPA will be under constant threat as the planet
continues to warm.
</p>
<h3>
Stan Meiburg, executive director of the Sabin Family Center for
Environment and Sustainability at Wake Forest University, formerly of
the Environmental Protection Agency
</h3>
<p>
The combined effect of the <em><em>Comer Post</em></em> and
<em><em>Loper</em></em> decisions may not be immediate, but they will be
profound. They will make it harder for agencies to do their work, and
easier for challengers (especially very well-funded challengers) to
attack and delay actions.
</p>
<p>
The two opinions are hard to reconcile. In <em><em>Loper</em></em>, the
opinion cites <em><em>Chevron</em></em> as “fostering unwarranted
instability” in the law, but in <em><em>Comer Post</em></em>, the court
has added extreme instability by leaving open-ended the question of when
a regulation is ever settled. The only common thread is the seeming
desire of the court to aggrandize the power of the courts.
</p>
<p>
Specific to climate, notwithstanding the statement in the opinion that
<em><em>Loper</em></em> does not reopen prior holdings that used the
<em><em>Chevron</em></em> framework, it is hard to imagine that such
challenges will not be forthcoming. In particular, opponents of the
finding in <em><em>Massachusetts v. EPA</em></em> may see
<em><em>Loper</em></em> and <em><em>Comer Post</em></em> as an
opportunity to reopen that 2007 case, especially as the court seems
quite ready and willing to overturn past precedents.
</p>
<p>
Finally, we have examples of how pre- <em><em>Chevron</em></em>
litigation worked under the Clean Air Act — and these examples should
give as much pause to conservatives as to progressives. Courts are not
likely to function well as regulatory agencies. The original
<em><em>Chevron</em></em> decision was favored by conservatives at the
time; post-<em><em>Chevron</em></em>, conservatives may regret that they
got what they asked for.
</p>
<h3>
Kym Meyer, litigation director at the Southern Environmental Law Center
</h3>
<p>
The Supreme Court’s rulings this session jeopardize critical
environmental protections and climate progress and are likely to wreak
chaos across the regulatory landscape. In <em><em>Corner Post</em></em>
the Supreme Court upended the statute of limitations for challenging
many government regulations, opening the door to hundreds of new
corporate challenges to long-established protections we all take for
granted. And in <em><em>Loper Bright</em></em>, the court displaced the
long-standing Chevron doctrine by shifting power to judges and
sidelining the expertise of agency staff who live and breathe the
science and safety concerns that federal agencies specialize in.
</p>
<p>
In combination, the cases tip the balance of power away from everyday
Americans that depend on commonsense protections to industry groups that
believe they will financially benefit without any limitations in place.
We’re ready to fight back to make sure this conservative supermajority
doesn’t leave us with a patchwork of inconsistent rulings and an
annihilation of the regulatory structure and critical protections that
keep us safe and healthy.
</p>
<h3>
Sanjay Narayan, managing attorney with the Sierra Club’s Environmental
Law Program
</h3>
<p>
The Supreme Court’s decisions, in combination, make it clear that the
Court intends to insert itself as, in Justice Kagan’s words, the
country’s “administrative czar.” Those decisions give courts control
over a wide array of scientific, technical, and policy choices necessary
to effectively implement our laws protecting clean air, clean water, and
affordable and reliable energy (and much more). That is likely to prove
corrosive to climate policy; judges lack the accountability, expertise,
and experience of agencies like the EPA or the Department of Energy.
</p>
<p>
But the primary drivers of decarbonization — economics and public
investments to accelerate the clean energy transition, like the
Inflation Reduction Act — remain relatively insulated from judicial
interference. So while the court’s decisions make the likely pathway to
decarbonization less steady, science-driven, and predictable, it should
not derail our ongoing progress towards achieving our climate goals over
the long term.
</p>
<h3>
Josiah Neeley, resident fellow and director of Texas-related programs at
the R Street Institute
</h3>
<p>
Undoubtedly, the Supreme Court’s decisions in <em><em>Corner
Post</em></em> and <em><em>Loper Bright</em></em> will make it easier
for plaintiffs to prevail in legal challenges to environmental
regulations. But we should be careful to keep things in perspective. The
end of Chevron deference means that agency interpretations of statutes
will get more judicial scrutiny than they did before, but even under
Chevron deference it was limited by such things as the major questions
doctrine. Agency interpretations are still likely to prevail in many
cases. Similarly, while the changes to when the statute of limitations
begins to run will allow additional challenges to be brought, a
regulation that has already survived earlier legal challenges is likely
to be upheld again if challenged by a new plaintiff later on. Agencies
like EPA or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission do not need to be
insulated from judicial review in order to be able to function. If they
do, that suggests a deeper problem with the administrative state.
</p>
<h3>
Adam Orford, assistant professor at University of Georgia School of Law
</h3>
<p>
In its regulatory jurisprudence this term, the Supreme Court has
fundamentally changed the playing field for environmental regulation,
making it much more difficult for agencies to use the flexibility that
Congress has attempted to provide to protect the environment. This is
likely to be felt especially where agencies are trying to tackle new
problems using older statutes. The ball is now in Congress’s court to
protect the American people by regularly improving the nation’s
environmental laws, ensuring that federal regulatory programs that
prevent pollution and preserve our country’s natural resources for
future generations are not lost forever over legal technicalities.
</p>
<h3>
Sam Sankar, senior vice president for programs at Earthjustice
</h3>
<p>
Taken together, <em><em>Corner Post</em></em> and <em><em>Loper
Bright</em></em> fire the starting gun for an onslaught of lawsuits
challenging long-settled regulatory programs. (They also sound the
dinner bell for amoral corporate law firms.)
</p>
<p>
Judicial conservatives have long proclaimed the need for judicial
minimalism and caution. Judges, they say, are not elected, and have no
business making policy from the bench. They should decide individual
cases and focus on the facts in front of them to avoid ripple effects
that they can’t foresee and can’t easily fix.
</p>
<p>
This conservative supermajority is instead heedlessly pursuing a
political agenda. By rewriting settled precedents to pursue a holy war
against federal regulations, the court is truly legislating from the
bench. And in justifying all this by citing idiosyncratic views of the
separation of powers, the court is practically holding a new
constitutional convention behind closed doors.
</p>
<h3>
Tim Whitehouse, executive director of Public Employees for Environmental
Responsibility
</h3>
<p>
The Supreme Court has made it clear that legal precedents and the plain
language of statutes will not slow their crusade to destroy the modern
regulatory state at the behest of their wealthy benefactors. Justice
Ketanji Brown Jackson got it right in her dissent in <em><em>Corner
Post:</em></em> “At the end of a momentous Term, this much is clear: The
tsunami of lawsuits against agencies that the Court’s holdings in this
case and <em><em>Loper Bright</em></em> have authorized has the
potential to devastate the functioning of the Federal Government.”
</p>
<p>
This tsunami of lawsuits will result in less consistent statutory
interpretations based on individual courts’ views on government
regulation generally and on the matter at hand. The court’s power grab
lays bare the importance of civil society and elected officials finding
ways to rebalance the relationships between the three branches of
government and supporting the ability of federal agencies to implement
federal laws effectively.

<h2 id="does-biden-himself-matter-for-climate-policy">Does Biden Himself
Matter for Climate Policy?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-02, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjUyNDQ4Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3MDQ5NzgwMn0.jiSxZEts3ThdqWih1BIScmOjhvFt6281od1wb9TvNWM/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Joe Biden was not a late arrival to the cause of arresting climate
change, even if for most of his career he was better known for advancing
the interests of the credit card industry than for environmental
passion. He
<a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/may/08/joe-biden/was-joe-biden-climate-change-pioneer-congress-hist/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>introduced</u></a>
an early climate bill in 1987, and though it didn’t do much (the bill,
which eventually passed, set up a task force to study the issue), he can
legitimately claim to have been there early. As president he has spoken
with sincere feeling about climate; even through the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/biden-trump-debate-climate-change" target="_blank">muddle
of his first debate</a> with Donald Trump, he managed to say that “the
only existential threat to humanity is climate change,” one of the
clearest statements he made all evening.
</p>
<p>
After his first debate with Donald Trump and the doubts it raised about
his ability to serve out another term, it’s natural to wonder whether
we’re approaching a high water mark of action on climate, and that after
this president the tide will again gradually recede. When we elect a
president, we elect a person who has their own values and priorities —
but we also elect not only the large group of policy personnel that
accompanies them but on top of that an entire political party that
determines what course they will take. It’s easy to lose sight of that
fact when so much attention is focused on the individual who occupies
the Oval Office, as though politics were a story with a singular
protagonist whose will determines the outcome of events.
</p>
<p>
But the truth is that the next Democrat in the White House — whether
it’s Kamala Harris or someone else — would not be able to backslide on
this issue even if they wanted to. Aggressive climate action is now
woven into the Democratic Party’s governing agenda for the foreseeable
future.
</p>
<p>
This is partly a story about polarization, which can sometimes have
positive effects. Not too long ago, the parties contained an ample
amount of ideological diversity; there were Northern liberal Republicans
and Southern conservative Democrats. Though it was race that powered the
realignment that began in the 1960s, one by one nearly every major
policy issue polarized cleanly along party lines. Which means that once
a party decides an issue is important to them, every elected official
has to get on board if they have ambitions for higher office.
</p>
<p>
Intra-party disagreement on policy hasn’t entirely disappeared, but it
takes place within a much narrower band of alternatives, and on some
issues there is almost no disagreement at all. There used to be
pro-choice, pro-gun reform Republicans and pro-life, pro-gun Democrats,
but they all either left office or changed their positions. With
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/joe-manchin-retiring-west-virginia-senator-inflation-reduction-act" target="_blank">Joe
Manchin retiring</a> this year, there will be almost no prominent fossil
fuel advocates left in the Democratic Party.
</p>
<p>
Few politicians have been more diligent in shifting with their party
than Biden, who spent a career carefully positioning himself precisely
where the center of Democratic gravity was. This is why he has been a
much more progressive president than one might have thought, especially
given that he was considered the “moderate” alternative to the likes of
Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren in the 2020 primaries. On almost no
issue is that more clear than on climate, where he can accurately claim
to have done more than any president in history.
</p>
<p>
If you look back at what the primary candidates
<a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/9/10/20851109/2020-democrats-climate-change-plan-president" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>were
saying in 2020</u></a>, most of the differences were small. Biden and
others promised to pursue net-zero emissions for the nation by 2050,
while a few set their target at 2045. Sanders’ plans were the most
enthusiastically optimistic (100% renewables in energy and
transportation by 2030; $16.3 trillion in green spending), but all of
them had committed to making climate action a policy centerpiece of
their administrations.
</p>
<p>
That includes Kamala Harris, who has
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/02/politics/kamala-harris-cop28-saturday/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>sometimes</u></a>
been the public
<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/07/14/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-on-combatting-climate-change-and-building-a-clean-energy-economy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>face</u></a>
of the administration’s climate efforts. To anyone wondering whether
Harris feels the urgency of climate action in her bones, the answer is
that it doesn’t really matter. If you’re a Democrat, you have to pursue
that goal because the entire party, from members of Congress to
activists to voters, will demand it.
</p>
<p>
That goes as well for the Democratic governors who are likely future
presidential contenders, either this year if Biden steps aside or in
2028. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/michigan-climate-laws-gretchen-whitmer-democrats-senate-bill-0271-0273-0502-0519" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">signed</a>

and has

a comprehensive “Healthy Climate Plan” that addresses energy,
transportation, residential decarbonization, and climate resilience.
California’s Gavin Newsom has put climate at the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/california-newsom-emissions-wind-solar" target="_blank">center</a>
of his governorship, attacking oil companies, spending
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/01/climate/california-lawmakers-climate-legislation.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>tens
of billions</u></a> of dollars on climate initiatives, and

a law banning the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035. J.B. Pritzker in
Illinois has
<a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/pritzker-signs-transformative-energy-plan-aimed-at-bringing-state-to-100-clean-energy-by-2050/2612986/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>signed</u></a>
legislation to achieve 100% clean energy and pushed a comprehensive
climate
<a href="https://dnr.illinois.gov/outreach/climate-action-plan.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>strategy</u></a>.
Gov. Josh Shapiro in Pennsylvania has walked a more careful line in the
third-largest
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/coal/production/weekly/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">coal-producing</a>
state (unlike the others, he has to contend with a legislature partly
controlled by Republicans), but he has
<a href="https://www.lehighvalleylive.com/news/2024/03/pennsylvania-governor-announces-plan-to-fight-climate-change-in-his-major-energy-producing-state.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>advocated</u></a>
a carbon pricing program and
<a href="https://www.shapirobudget.pa.gov/energy-strategy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>touts</u></a>
a variety of efforts to reduce emissions in the state.
</p>
<p>
In other words, any Democratic governor with national ambitions has to
be able to tell voters that in their state they made progress on
climate. It isn’t enough to say they agree with the party’s basic
orientation; they have to show results, just as a Republican governor
will have to demonstrate that they limited abortion access and expanded
gun rights.
</p>
<p>
That doesn’t mean progress is guaranteed even when an administration
committed to climate action is in office, as recent Supreme Court
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/supreme-court-epa" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rulings</a>
make clear. But if it was something of a surprise to see the moderate
Joe Biden do as much as he did on climate, his Democratic successors
will have to take this administration’s record as a baseline, and at
least try to do no less. They won’t have a choice.

York disbars Giuliani as court finds he repeatedly lied about
election</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Rudolph Giuliani, the former New York City mayor, federal
prosecutor and legal advisor to Donald Trump, was disbarred in the state
on Tuesday after a court found he repeatedly made false statements about
Donald Trump’s 2020 election loss.</p>
<p>The decision was handed down by a New York appeals court in
Manhattan.</p>
<p>The court ruled that Giuliani be “disbarred from the practice of law,
effective immediately, and until the further order of this Court, and
his name stricken from the roll of attorneys and counselors-at-law in
the State of New York.”</p>
<p>Giuliani has already had his New York law license suspended for false
statements he made after the election.</p>
<p>Giuliani was the primary mouthpiece for Trump’s false claims of
election fraud after the 2020 vote, standing at a press conference in
front of Four Seasons Total Landscaping outside Philadelphia on the day
the race was called for Democrat Joe Biden over the Republican Trump and
saying they would challenge what he claimed was a vast conspiracy by
Democrats.</p>
<p>Lies around the election results helped push an angry mob of
pro-Trump rioters to storm the U.S. Capitol on January 6 to stop the
certification of Biden’s victory.</p>

Is Slowly Breaking the EPA</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-02, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjUyNDIyOC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczOTU3NjgyN30.C7QOnRVu-ODCyjvIbsdkufUSjKC79am5L1LAs4i-DF4/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Perhaps it’s futile to talk about any Supreme Court decision this term
other than the
justices’<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
<u>unprecedented ruling</u></a> in the Trump case. The court’s decision
to grant broad immunity to the president from criminal prosecution could
reshape the modern presidency and empower Donald Trump during his
potential — and increasingly likely — second term.
</p>
<p>
That ruling, too, will have profound practical implications for
Americans who care about climate change. During his presidency, Trump
flexed his power to
<a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/trump-administration-stifling-renewable-energy-public-lands-waters/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>slow</u></a>
the energy transition,
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/11/national-climate-assessment-black-friday/576589/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>bury</u></a>
scientific reports, and
<a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/06/01/867532070/trumps-unannounced-church-visit-angers-church-officials" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>attack</u></a>
protesters. What will happen now that he is unbound?
</p>
<p>
But just as the court was expanding the president’s personal authority,
it was confining and shrinking the power of <em><em>any
</em></em>president to address climate change or regulate carbon dioxide
emissions.
</p>
<p>
In a series of important rulings over the past week, the Supreme Court
sharply limited the Environmental Protection Agency’s ability to
regulate carbon pollution. These rulings could resonate for years to
come, no matter who wins the White House in November.
</p>
<p>
It did so by focusing on a corner of federal law that is often
overlooked by the mass public: administrative law, the body of rules
that govern how federal agencies constrain and regulate the private
sector. Although Americans rarely interact with these rules, they affect
the water we drink, air we breathe, and the food and drugs that we
ingest.
</p>
<p>
Taken together, the four cases — <em><em>Loper Bright
Enterprises</em></em>,<em><em> Corner Post</em></em>,<em><em>
Jarkesy</em></em>,<em> </em>and<em><em> Ohio v. EPA —</em></em> are not
as high-profile as the Supreme Court’s broad grant of immunity to Trump.
But they could substantially weaken the EPA for decades to come,
stymying its ability to write and enforce rules limiting carbon
pollution. They could also slow down the permitting and construction of
new clean energy infrastructure.
</p>
<p>
“All of these decisions — all four of them — inflate the role of the
courts relative to the bureaucracy. This is part of a longstanding
campaign by the conservative legal movement to bring the administrative
state to judicial heel,”
<a href="https://michigan.law.umich.edu/faculty-and-scholarship/our-faculty/nicholas-bagley" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Nicholas
Bagley</u></a>, a law professor at the University of Michigan Law
School, told me.
</p>
<p>
“Congress has not comprehensively addressed climate change but the
agencies are trying to,” Emily Hammond, an environmental law professor
at George Washington University, told me. “What these cases do, all
together, is fairly comprehensively limit the ability of agencies to
protect health and human safety and try to mitigate climate change.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s a shocking and scary grab of power by a court that is rapidly
discarding principles that we’ve been able to rely on and expect for a
long time,” she added.
</p>
<p>
In the first case, <em><em>Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo,
</em></em>the Supreme Court repealed a 40-year-old tenet of American
regulatory law that said courts should generally defer to executive
agencies such as the EPA when interpreting an ambiguous law. In the
second, <em><em>Corner Post v. Board of Governors, </em></em>the court
opened the door to lawsuits targeting federal regulations that have been
on the books for years. Instead of allowing companies to challenge a new
rule during the first six years after it was published, the court ruled
that companies can challenge a new rule during the six years
<em><em>after the rule begins to affect them. </em></em>That seemingly
allows companies to challenge federal regulations long after they have
been issued and treated as settled law.
</p>
<p>
In the EPA’s case, these two cases may have less influence than it may
seem— not because the EPA won’t be subject to these precedents, but
rather because the agency receives so little deference from the justices
<em><em>already</em></em>.
</p>
<p>
The high court
<a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF12077" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has
asserted</u></a> since 2022 that agencies cannot write new rules on
questions of “vast economic and political significance” without clear
authorization from Congress. This principle, called the “major questions
doctrine,” was first invoked by the justices to overturn the Clean Power
Plan, an Obama-era rule that restricted greenhouse gas pollution from
power plants in part by setting up an interstate carbon trading scheme.
But the doctrine would seem to constrain almost any EPA attempt to
regulate activities related to climate change, Carlson said. The EPA’s
recent attempt
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/epa-auto-emissions-rule" target="_self"><u>to
limit tailpipe pollution from cars</u></a> — in addition to
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/regulations-emissions-vehicles-and-engines/final-rule-greenhouse-gas-emissions-standards-heavy-duty#:~:text=On%20March%2029%2C%202024%2C%20the,model%20year%20(MY)%202027." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>rules
cutting carbon pollution</u></a> from heavy-duty trucks — could run
astray of the major questions doctrine.
</p>
<p>
“At least in my mind, in terms of what regulations will be challenged
and how, the major questions doctrine poses the biggest threat to
regulatory authority,” Carlson said.
</p>
<p>
The <em><em>Corner Post </em></em>ruling, which effectively extends the
statute of limitations for suing over new regulations, may also mean
less for the EPA than for other agencies. That’s because virtually every
EPA climate protection is already battled over in court, and once a
court has decided whether a given regulation is legal, everyone has to
abide by that precedent.
</p>
<p>
“Most rules worth challenging will already have been challenged,” Bagley
said.
</p>
<p>
The EPA may escape, too, from the worst of the <em><em>Corner Post
</em></em>ruling, but only because its rules are almost always litigated
within the first six years of their life anyway, Carlson told me. That
means companies probably won’t need to sue after that, as they might
want to do for other federal regulations.
</p>
<p>
Even if those cases have a muted effect on the EPA, however, the other
two rulings — which have received less attention so far — could prove
far more restrictive to the agency’s authority.
</p>
<p>
In one case,
<a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/securities-and-exchange-commission-v-jarkesy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>Securities
and Exchange Commission v. Jarkesy</em></em></u></a>, the court ruled
6-3 that the SEC cannot use an in-house tribunal of administrative
judges to impose a civil penalty on a company. Instead, the agency must
grant the company a full jury trial in federal court. But many other
agencies, including the EPA, also use administrative judges and in-house
trials to punish individuals or companies for breaking the law. Each
year, the EPA
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/enforcement/enforcement-and-compliance-annual-results-fiscal-year-2022" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>imposes
hundreds of millions of dollars</u></a> in fines on companies that
violate the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act.
</p>
<p>
Over the next few years, federal judges — and eventually the Supreme
Court — will have to decide whether the <em><em>Jarkesy </em></em>ruling
affects all executive agencies, including the EPA. If they decide it
does, then it could slow down the agency’s efforts to penalize polluting
companies by forcing virtually every decision into an already overworked
court system.
</p>
<p>
But perhaps the most ominous ruling, Bagely said, is the one in a
lawsuit concerning the EPA itself. On Thursday, in
<a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/ohio-v-environmental-protection-agency/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>Ohio
v. EPA</em></em></u></a>,<em> </em>the court blocked the agency’s “good
neighbor” rule, meant to limit how much air pollution upwind states can
release into downwind states. The five-justice majority did so not only
because it disagreed about the agency’s interpretation of the Clean Air
Act, but also because the justices felt that the EPA had not properly
addressed a few of the more than 1,100 comments about the rulemaking
that it had received from the public. As such, they stayed the rule —
temporarily blocking it from being enforced — and sent the case back
down to a lower court.
</p>
<p>
That decision could change how every<em> </em>court views the rulemaking
process, Bagley told me. Whenever the EPA drafts a new environmental
rule, it receives thousands of public comments criticizing and praising
different aspects of the proposal. Under a law called the Administrative
Procedure Act, which governs how federal agencies deal with the public,
it must respond to the substance of each of those comments before it can
finalize and enforce the rule.
</p>
<p>
The EPA <em><em>did</em></em> respond to the comments at the center of
the <em><em>Ohio </em></em>case, but Justice Neil Gorsuch, writing for
the majority, decided the agency did not address a few specific concerns
sufficiently.
</p>
<p>
Justice Amy Coney Barrett issued a dissent — joined by the court’s
liberals — and castigated Gorsuch for focusing on “an alleged procedural
error that likely had no impact” on the EPA’s actual anti-pollution
plan.
</p>
<p>
“Given the number of companies included and the timelines for review,
the court’s injunction leaves large swaths of upwind States free to keep
contributing significantly to their downwind neighbors’ ozone problems
for the next several years,” Barrett wrote.
</p>
<p>
“The reason this worries me in the environmental context is that
<em><em>every</em></em> major environmental action is going to come with
1,000, 2,000 — 3,000 public comments,” he said. “What the court did here
is flyspeck those comments,” meaning it looked for a tiny error and used
it to justify pausing the entire rule. That’s despite the fact that the
Clean Air Act, which the EPA was enforcing in the <em><em>Ohio</em></em>
case, says that the courts must already meet an unusually high standard
to intervene in an agency’s response to public comments.
</p>
<p>
“By flyspecking these comments … it increases the incentive to submit
lots and lots of comments” in the hope that the EPA misses one of them.
In those comments, “industry groups strew rakes all over your lawn in
the hope that you’ll step on one — eventually an agency will.”
</p>
<p>
That has dire implications for the EPA’s ability to propose new climate
rules, he said, but more broadly it affects any regulatory proceeding
where the federal government has to reply to hundreds or thousands of
public comments. In recent years, for insurance, some Democrats and many
clean energy developers have grown frustrated with the National
Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, which requires the government to
study the environmental impact of any action that it takes. NEPA seems
to
<a href="https://ifp.org/no-nepa-really-is-a-problem-for-clean-energy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>particularly
hamstring</u></a> clean energy projects, such as
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/sunzia" target="_self"><u>transmission
lines</u></a> and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/permitting-reform-transmission-nepa-geothermal" target="_self"><u>geothermal
wells</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
NEPA does not require that agencies minimize a project’s impact to the
environment; only that the government <em><em>study </em></em>all
potential impacts. But as part of the NEPA process, the government must
respond to public comments about the proposed action. It can receive
hundreds or thousands of comments about a given NEPA case.
</p>
<p>
That means virtually every NEPA process could now be subject to the same
high level of scrutiny that the court imposed on the EPA in <em><em>Ohio
v. EPA. </em></em>“This is a dramatic intensification of the stringency
of judicial review across a number of domains,” Bagley said.
</p>
<p>
It is ironic, at best, that these sharp new limits on executive
agencies’ ability to regulate carbon pollution came from the same Court
that vastly expanded the president’s immunity under the law.
</p>
<p>
“This is a court that is hostile to environmental regulation,” Ann
Carlson, a UCLA environmental law professor and the former acting head
of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration from 2022 to 2023,
told me. “I don’t think there’s any other way to view it.”

Supreme Court to weigh in on flavored e-cigarette products</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court took up an e-cigarette case
Tuesday, weighing whether the Food and Drug Administration wrongly
blocked the marketing of sweet, flavored products amid a surge in vaping
by young people.</p>
<p>Vaping companies argue the FDA unfairly denied more than a million
applications to market fruit or candy flavored versions of
nicotine-laced liquid that’s heated by the e-cigarette to create an
inhalable aerosol.</p>
<p>The case comes as the FDA undertakes a sweeping review after years of
regulatory delays intended to bring scientific scrutiny to the
multibillion-dollar vaping market, which includes thousands of flavored
vapes that are technically illegal but are widely available in
convenience stores, gas stations and vape shops. The FDA recently
approved its first menthol-flavored electronic cigarettes for adult
smokers.</p>
<p>The agency says the sweet, flavored e-liquids pose a “serious,
well-documented risk” of enticing more young people to pick up a
nicotine habit. In 2020, nearly 20% of high school students and almost
5% of middle school students used e-cigarettes, and almost all of those
kids used flavored products, the agency said in court documents.</p>
<p>The agency says companies were blocked because they couldn’t show the
possible benefits for adult smokers outweighed the risk of underage use.
The companies say they had prepared detailed plans to avoid appealing to
young people.</p>
<p>The companies scored a victory when the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of
Appeals sided with vaping companies and tossed out orders denying the
marketing of e-liquids with names like “Jimmy The Juice Man in Peachy
Strawberry.”</p>
<p>The 5th Circuit found the agency was unfair because it required the
companies, without warning, to present studies showing that flavored
products would help with smoking cessation.</p>
<p>The FDA appealed that finding to the Supreme Court. The justices are
expecting to hear the case in the fall.</p>
<p>Other appeals courts have sided with the FDA, which regulates new
tobacco products under a 2009 law aimed at curbing youth tobacco
use.</p>
<p>Vaping companies have long claimed their products can help blunt the
toll of smoking, which is blamed for 480,000 U.S. deaths annually due to
cancer, lung disease and heart disease.</p>
<p>Youth vaping has declined from all-time highs in recent years, but
about 10% of high schoolers still reported e-cigarette use last
year.</p>

President Biden’s pause on permits for new liquefied natural gas export
terminals. The administration issued a temporary moratorium on new LNG
approvals in January, allowing the Energy Department to study what
effect terminals have on the climate, a move seen as a big win for
climate activists. But it was quickly followed by a lawsuit from 16
states accusing the administration of violating federal law. A
Trump-appointed judge in Louisiana agreed that the pause was hurting
states, and said it was “completely without reason or logic and is
perhaps the epiphany of ideocracy [sic].” The Energy Department
disagreed with the ruling and is considering its next steps. Some early
reaction and analysis to the news:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
“The ruling represents the latest example of how the judiciary is
increasingly constraining President Biden’s climate goals at the behest
of conservative and corporate challengers.”

heat-related violations in workplaces. If finalized, the rule would
apply to about 36 million workers and reduce heat-related health
problems in the workplace significantly. The plan is “likely to face
legal challenges from businesses and lobbying groups that have staunchly
opposed such a measure,” <em><em>The Guardian</em></em>

<p>date: 2024-07-02, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Online interactions are weirdly unique. They happen in shared, digital spaces—forums, chats, comment sections, social media platforms—where it’s easy to forget that more often than not, the people interacting with each other don’t share the same day-to-day reality. And sometimes that doesn’t matter. There are plenty of topics we can chat about that don’t have a connection with our lives. But there are also plenty who do have a connection and a profound one. From food to politics, from everything related to society to cultural norms. We all live in bubbles whether we like it or not. And it’s easy to forget about this fact when interacting online. Every time I stumble on someone making some wild claims about something I have to remind myself that maybe that specific thing appears wild to me because of my circumstances and it might be perfectly normal and reasonable somewhere else. And that’s why when I’m interacting with someone online I try to be both charitable in my interpretations of what others are saying and also generally curious and open-minded. Sometimes asking a question is all it takes to make a bubble pop and help a conversation move to a more interesting place.&lt;/p&gt;                &lt;hr&gt;

seeks to set aside New York verdict hours after Supreme Court
ruling</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — Donald Trump’s lawyers on Monday asked the New York judge
who presided over his hush money trial to set aside his conviction and
delay his sentencing scheduled for later this month.</p>
<p>The letter to Judge Juan M. Merchan cited the U.S. Supreme Court’s
ruling earlier Monday and asked the judge to delay Trump’s sentencing
while he weighs the high court’s decision and how it could influence the
New York case, the people said.</p>
<p>The people could not discuss details of the letter before it was made
public and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court on Monday ruled for the first time that former
presidents have broad immunity from prosecution.</p>
<p>Trump was convicted on 34 counts of falsifying business records,
arising from what prosecutors said was an attempt to cover up a hush
money payment just before the 2016 presidential election.</p>
<p>Merchan instituted a policy in the run-up to the trial requiring both
sides to send him a one-page letter summarizing their arguments before
making longer court filings. He said he did that to better manage the
docket, so he was not inundated with voluminous paperwork.</p>

id="deepening-russia-north-korea-ties-test-us-south-korea-deterrence-strategy">Deepening
Russia-North Korea ties test US-South Korea deterrence strategy</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The United States’ commitment to providing extended
deterrence to South Korea is being put to the test, with some South
Korean politicians publicly questioning the effectiveness of the U.S.
nuclear umbrella after Russia and North Korea reached a new defense
pact.</p>
<p>Debate over the U.S. extended deterrence was sparked by
Representative Na Kyung Won, a five-term lawmaker of South Korea’s
ruling People Power Party, who is running for the party leadership.</p>
<p>“The deterrence under the solid South Korea-U.S. alliance is
currently working, but it does not guarantee the capacity to respond to
the future changes in the security environment,” Na said in a social
media post last week.</p>
<p>“The international situation, such as cooperation between North Korea
and Russia, is adding uncertainty to the security of South Korea,” she
added, referring to the stronger military ties between Russia and North
Korea, bolstered by the comprehensive strategic partnership treaty
signed by Russia’s President Vladmir Putin and North Korean leader Kim
Jong Un in Pyongyang last month.</p>
<p>The new treaty mandates Russia and North Korea to immediately assist
each other militarily if either of them is attacked by a third country.
The prospect of quasi-automatic Russian involvement in any future war
between the two Koreas is now causing alarm in Seoul.</p>
<p>The credibility of extended deterrence is a frequent topic of
conversation in today’s South Korea, where citizens must contend with
seemingly endless threats and provocations from the North. </p>
<p>  </p>
<p>Seoul is doing its best to allay citizens’ fears by invoking the
April 2023 Washington Declaration, which reaffirmed the U.S. commitment
to defend South Korea through its extended nuclear umbrella as well as
robust missile defense and conventional forces. </p>
<p>  </p>
<p>The Washington Declaration outlined a series of measures, including
the establishment of the bilateral Nuclear Consultative Group (NCG), to
deter North Korea’s use of nuclear weapons. </p>
<p>  </p>
<p>In the joint declaration, the U.S. additionally vowed to enhance the
visibility of its strategic assets, such as a nuclear-armed submarine,
around the Korean Peninsula.</p>
<p>The Washington Declaration’s measures are collectively sufficient to
deter aggression from Pyongyang, according to some experts in the
U.S.</p>
<p>The joint declaration was “unprecedented in its strength and
clarity,” Evans Revere, a former State Department official who
negotiated with North Korea, told VOA’s Korean Service on Sunday. “And
the NCG process is designed to be flexible, creative, and allow for
adaptation to a broad range of future contingencies.”</p>
<p>Troop presence</p>
<p>David Maxwell, a former U.S. Special Forces colonel who served on the
Combined Forces Command of the U.S and South Korea, told VOA’s Korean
Service on Sunday that a large troop presence on the Korean Peninsula
demonstrates Washington’s firm commitment to the defense of its key
ally.</p>
<p>“How many Russian troops are committed to North Korea? There is no
comparison as to the commitment,” said Maxwell, who now serves as vice
president of the Center for Asia Pacific Strategy.</p>
<p>Currently, the U.S. has about 28,500 service members deployed in
South Korea.</p>
<p>In contrast, Elbridge Colby, who served as the deputy assistant
secretary of defense for strategy and force development in the Trump
administration, suggested the U.S. might have to go beyond the
Washington Declaration to ensure the security of South Korea.</p>
<p>“I think we need to take very seriously how dire the threat from
North Korea is, and that the Washington Declaration is not a solution,”
Colby told VOA’s Korean Service on the phone last week.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“It’s been a failure that both North Korea and China are a nuclear
breakout. They’re increasing the size and the sophistication of the
nuclear forces. So it’s very unsurprising that serious people in South
Korea are coming to this conclusion.” </p>
<p>  </p>
<p>Bruce Bennett, senior defense analyst at the RAND Corporation,
believes some South Koreans may lack confidence in the Washington
Declaration because the NCG’s work is not made public.</p>
<p>“Because the NCG that it established has carried out most of its work
in secrecy and provided little substance to reassure the South Korean
people, many of the South Koreans with whom I have spoken are concerned
that it is an inadequate means for rebuilding South Korean trust,”
Bennett told VOA’s Korean Service on Sunday.</p>
<p>Responding to an inquiry from VOA’s Korean Service, a State
Department spokesperson said Thursday that “the U.S. and the ROK are
enhancing and strengthening extended deterrence through the Nuclear
Consultative Group, established as part of the Washington
Declaration.”</p>
<p>The spokesperson also stressed that the Washington Declaration is “a
landmark U.S. extended deterrence commitment to the Republic of Korea.”
The Republic of Korea is South Korea’s official name.</p>
<p>Earlier last week, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell
maintained that the series of mechanisms put in place between the United
States and South Korea through the Washington Declaration “has given us
what we need to work with” regarding the alliance’s deterrence
posture.</p>
<p>North Korea launched two short-range ballistic missiles Monday, one
of which is presumed to have failed and fallen inland near Pyongyang.
The latest missile test came just five days after North Korea conducted
a ballistic missile test in which it claimed to have successfully tested
its multiple-warhead missile technology. South Korean authorities have
dismissed such a claim.</p>

<h2 id="crossmark-community-consultation-what-did-we-learn">Crossmark
community consultation: What did we learn?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-02, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<p>
In the first half of this year we’ve been talking to our community about
post-publication changes and Crossmark. When a piece of research is
published it isn’t the end of the journey—it is read, reused, and
sometimes modified. That’s why we run Crossmark, as a way to provide
notifications of important changes to research made after publication.
Readers can see if the resesarch they are looking at has updates by
clicking the Crossmark logo. They also see useful information about the
editorial process, and links to things like funding and registered
clinical trials. All of this contributes to what we call the
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/isr-part-one-what-is-our-role-in-preserving-the-integrity-of-the-scholarly-record/" target="_blank">integrity
of the scholarly record</a>.

</div>
<p>
Crossmark has been around a long time and the context around it is
constantly changing. It last had a major update in
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/get-ready-for-crossmark-2.0/" target="_blank">2016</a>
and in
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/encouraging-even-greater-reporting-of-corrections-and-retractions/" target="_blank">2020</a>
we removed fees for its use.
</p>
<p>
The past few years have seen a more intense focus on research integrity,
leading to more retractions and calling out large-scale manipulation of
editorial processes. At the same time, we haven’t seen an increase in
the uptake of Crossmark, which is still used by only a minority of our
members. We would like to know why the uptake is low and whether there
is more we can do in this area. To dig into this, in the first part of
2024 we reached out to members of our community.
</p>
<h2 id="what-did-we-do">
What did we do?
</h2>
<p>
We wanted to learn about attitudes towards Crossmark and related aspects
of research integrity. This was done in several ways:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Structured interviews with eight of our members.
</li>
<li>
Round tables at Crossref LIVE events in Bogota and Nairobi
</li>
<li>
Surveying a selection of our members, which led to 94 responses.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The topics we asked about were related to how post-publication updates
are made and communicated, and which metadata demonstrates good
practice.
</p>
<p>
We are extremely grateful to the members who contributed. They provided
valuable feedback and have helped to shape the future of Crossmark and
our approach to the integrity of the scholarly record.
</p>
<h2 id="what-did-we-find">
What did we find?
</h2>
<p>
Across the various groups there were a few common themes, which fell
into several areas.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Communication of updates is highly valued, and seen as the most
important role that Crossmark can play. Some of those we spoke to would
like readers to see if there is an update as soon as a page opens,
without having to open a popup. This could be done by having a logo that
changes colour, shape, or size.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Conversely, not as much enthusiasm was shown for the metadata
assertions. These are additional fields that can be displayed to readers
in the Crossmark popup. There wasn’t a strong consensus on which
commonly-made assertions are the most important for research integrity.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
There is diversity in attitudes towards making updates to published
works, what research integrity means, and approaches to workflows for
updates. Even within a single organisation, a number of different
workflows and multiple staff members might be called on to update
published research. This makes things complex and means that it can be
difficult to fit Crossmark in.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
There are technical challenges to getting started with Crossmark. Those
responsible for implementing Crossmark are often technical staff who
struggle with the documentation we provide in English. There is also no
plugin for OJS, a widely-used open source editorial software. It is more
difficult to deposit Crossmark metadata for books than journal articles,
and many article types don’t permit Crossmark metadata at all. On the
other hand, those who successfully installed Crossmark found it easy to
use and low-maintenance.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Overall, it seems that Crossmark still has an important role to play but
there are changes and improvements we can make.
</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">
What’s next?
</h2>
<p>
Here are the main areas we intend to follow up on in the coming months.
</p>
<h3 id="implementation">
Implementation
</h3>
<p>
We need to look at how to make implementation more straight-forward. Can
we provide multilingual documentation, plugins, run workshops or
webinars, or make changes to Crossmark to lower the barrier to entry?
</p>
<h3 id="understanding-workflows">
Understanding workflows
</h3>
<p>
Can we collaborate with our members and other organisations to reach a
better understanding of how to update published works? Are there
alternative workflows we need to support? Have we made it too difficult
to understand and implement the options we currently have?
</p>
<p>
While updates are always likely to be rare, we want to help members
understand the benefits of making them. We talked to some members who
were proud of never having published a retraction or correction, which
left us wondering whether they are missing legitimate opportunities to
correct the scholarly record. We also know that for some members and
many work types (preprints, for example), updates are made without a
separate published notification. Can we better understand the role that
the published updates play and communicate updates even if there isn’t a
published notice?
</p>
<h3 id="ongoing-feedback">
Ongoing feedback
</h3>
<p>
Clearly one size doesn’t fit all when it comes to implementing and
communicating updates. We need to find ways of keeping in touch with the
community to test new solutions with as broad a range of members as
possible. We want to avoid catering to a minority and leaving others
struggling to find ways to implement a solution.
</p>
<h3 id="custom-metadata">
Custom metadata?
</h3>
<p>
Is there an ongoing need for metadata assertions? Many of the assertions
currently made are possible as standard metadata and others could be
included in our deposit schema. We want to consider removing the option
to add assertions. This needs more feedback from the community,
especially those who currently make use of assertions.
</p>
<h3 id="redesign-the-ui">
Redesign the UI
</h3>
<p>
Crossmark doesn’t have the recognition with readers we would like. Is
there a way we can redesign it to make it more associated with Crossref
and accurate metadata? We intend to explore different designs, and test
them with members and readers.
