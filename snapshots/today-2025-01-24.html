<i>With stable employment exceedingly difficult to come by,
intellectually disabled adults have another, occasionally lucrative, way
of participating in American society: they can become artists.</i>

On a Monday morning in early June, Nicole Storm arrived at the Creative
Growth Art Center in downtown Oakland, California. Light poured in
through broad windows that faced the street. Nicole put her jacket and
lunch away in the closet and then selected a large piece of cardboard
from a stack in a hallway. A staff member helped her secure the
makeshift canvas to an easel and set out her paints and markers. She
chatted with some fellow artists and then explained to me that she is
starting a new project, after having finished a few paintings last week.
Nicole refers to her artistic process as “taking notes.” It is a way for
her to organize the events of a day, although the results never look
like a typical archive or journal. She creates bright washes of color
that provide a glowing background for lines and shapes that appear like
an indeterminate form of writing. Nicole records what is going on around
her with marks that may initially seem impulsive and spontaneous. But
they are the culmination of a well-honed practice, undeniable
creativity, and decades of sustained work.
</p>
<p>
Nicole was born in 1967, during what her mother, Diane, refers to as
“the tail end of the Dark Ages,” when someone like Nicole, who has Down
syndrome, would almost certainly have lived her entire life in an
institution. At that time, Diane recalls, “I sent away for some
information about Down syndrome and what I got was bleak. The life
expectancy was twelve years. Fifty percent of people were dead before
their fifth birthday. So I threw that stuff in the trash and decided to
do it my way.”
</p>
<p>
Diane and Nicole are closer than most mothers and their adult daughters.
They live together, and Diane volunteers once a week at Creative Growth
when Nicole is there. Nicole inherited Diane’s round face and direct
stare. They both speak with a great deal of confidence. Diane attributes
Nicole’s confidence to how she “ran with the pack” as a kid; she was
thrown into the deep end of progressive schools that included her with
the rest of the students. Diane’s confidence developed out of her fierce
advocacy for Nicole and a lifetime of fighting with bureaucratic systems
that did little more than tell her what her daughter would not be able
to do. I mentioned to Diane that my daughter, like Nicole, has Down
syndrome. “You know how it goes then,” she said. “We had no support when
she was growing up, but I’m sure your daughter has a bright future.”
</p>
<p>
Diane is right. My daughter is part of a generation with more
opportunities to attend school with her peers, although she still faces
plenty of challenges. I hope she might be able to find a job and work in
a supportive community. But historically our society has expected very
little of people with intellectual disabilities, which makes Nicole’s
success as an artist all the more remarkable.
</p>
<p>
When Nicole was in her twenties, Diane searched for a day program that
Nicole could attend while she worked full-time. But they struggled to
find a suitable situation that met Nicole’s need for routine and
predictability. She spent most of her days on public transportation.
Diane recalled a time when Nicole traveled with a group to an event at a
library in Berkeley, only to have to catch another bus fifteen minutes
later to come back home. Eventually Nicole moved into a group home for
people with disabilities, where she lived in an apartment with the help
of support staff. Both Nicole and Diane believed this was the
independence Nicole deserved. But after two and a half years, she wasn’t
thriving. Nicole wasn’t developing much of a life outside her apartment,
and the support staff wasn’t as attentive as Diane had expected. After
Nicole became seriously ill with pneumonia, they decided they had had
enough. Nicole went back to living with Diane. An artist friend told
them about Creative Growth, and Nicole started attending the program
regularly. The new sense of routine and purpose transformed her almost
overnight.
</p>
<p>
“It was the most wonderful moment,” Nicole remembered.
</p>
<p>
“You’re right,” said Diane. “That’s when the magic started to happen.”

<h2 id="should-you-write-differently-for-llms">Should you write
differently for LLMs?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-24, from: Blog by Fabrizio Ferri-Benedetti</p>
<p>
Writing for LLMs is the new SEO obsession. Not a day passes without
seeing some question popping up in tech writing communities about how to
best compose content for AI scrapers. Folks even wonder if a different
style guide should be necessary, or whether tables should be avoided
because they’ve seen
<a href="https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/WSL/pull/2021#issuecomment-2546627586">a
pull request</a> rejected in a Microsoft repository on the silliest
grounds.

<h2 id="anthropics-new-citations-api">Anthropic’s new Citations API</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-24, updated: 2025-01-24, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
Here’s a new API-only feature from Anthropic that requires quite a bit
of assembly in order to unlock the value:
<a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/introducing-citations-api">Introducing
Citations on the Anthropic API</a>. Let’s talk about what this is and
why it’s interesting.

</ul>
<h4 id="citations-for-rag">
Citations for Retrieval Augmented Generation
</h4>
<p>
The core of the <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/rag/">Retrieval
Augmented Generation</a> (RAG) pattern is to take a user’s question,
retrieve portions of documents that might be relevant to that question
and then answer the question by including those text fragments in the
context provided to the LLM.
</p>
<p>
This usually works well, but there is still a risk that the model may
answer based on other information from its training data (sometimes OK)
or hallucinate entirely incorrect details (definitely bad).
</p>
<p>
The <em>best</em> way to help mitigate these risks is to support the
answer with citations that incorporate direct quotations from the
underlying source documents. This even acts as a form of fact-checking:
the user can confirm that the quoted text did indeed come from those
documents, helping provide relatively robust protection against
hallucinated details resulting in incorrect answers.
</p>
<p>
Actually building a system that does this can be quite tricky. Matt
Yeung described a pattern for this he called
<a href="https://mattyyeung.github.io/deterministic-quoting">Deterministic
Quoting</a> last April, where answers are accompanied by direct
quotations from the source documents that are guaranteed to be copied
across and not lossily transformed by the model.
</p>
<p>
This is a great idea, but actually building it requires some quite
sophisticated prompt engineering and complex implementation code.
</p>
<p>
Claude’s new
<a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/citations">Citations
API</a> mechanism handles the difficult parts of this for you. You still
need to implement most of RAG - identifying potentially relevant
documents, then feeding that content in as part of the prompt - but
Claude’s API will then do the difficult work of extracting relevant
citations and including them in the response that it sends back to you.
</p>
<h4 id="trying-out-the-new-api-with-uv-run">
Trying out the new API with uv run
</h4>
<p>
I tried the API out using Anthropic’s Python client library, which was
<a href="https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python/commit/67aa83e5d589f6afad5fbc8bd2e616cc71a80a29">just
updated</a> to support the citations API.
</p>
<p>
I ran a scratch Python 3.13 interpreter with that package using
<a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/">uv run</a> like this (after first
setting the necessary <code>ANTHROPIC_API_KEY</code> environment
variable using
<a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/help.html#llm-keys-get-help">llm
keys get</a>):
</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell">
<pre><span class="pl-k">export</span> ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span><span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">$(</span>llm keys get claude<span class="pl-pds">)</span></span><span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>
uv run --with anthropic --python 3.13 python</pre>
</div>
<p>
Python 3.13 has
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.13.html#a-better-interactive-interpreter">a
nicer interactive interpreter</a> which you can more easily paste code
into. Using <code>uv run</code> like this gives me an environment with
that package pre-installed without me needing to setup a virtual
environment as a separate step.
</p>
<p>
Then I ran the following code, adapted from
<a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/citations">Anthropic’s
example</a>. The

Here’s
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/022d082ccfd636256f72150df344335e">the
full response</a>.
</p>
<p>
This format is pretty interesting! It’s the standard Claude format but
those <code>“content”</code> blocks now include an optional additional
<code>“citations”</code> key which contains a list of relevant citation
extracts that support the claim in the <code>“text”</code> block.
</p>
<h4 id="rendering-the-citations">
Rendering the citations
</h4>
<p>
Eyeballing the JSON output wasn’t particularly fun. I wanted a very
quick tool to help me see that output in a more visual way.
</p>
<p>
A trick I’ve been using a lot recently is that LLMs like Claude are
<em>really</em> good at writing code to turn arbitrary JSON shapes like
this into a more human-readable format.
</p>
<p>
I fired up my
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/19/one-shot-python-tools/#custom-instructions">Artifacts
project</a>, pasted in the above JSON and prompted it like this:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Build a tool where I can paste JSON like this into a textarea and the
result will be rendered in a neat way - it should should intersperse
text with citations, where each citation has the cited_text rendered in
a blockquote
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It helped me
<a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/render-claude-citations">build
this tool</a>
(<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/85bd050908486de36b078c8c7d01e903">follow-up
prompt here</a>), which lets you paste in JSON and produces a rendered
version of the text:
</p>
<p>

</p>
<h4 id="now-i-need-to-design-an-abstraction-layer-for-llm">
Now I need to design an abstraction layer for LLM
</h4>
<p>
I’d like to upgrade my <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a> tool
and <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-claude-3">llm-claude-3</a>
plugin to include support for this new feature… but doing so is going to
be relatively non-trivial.
</p>
<p>
The problem is that LLM currently bakes in an assumption that all LLMs
respond with a stream of text.
</p>
<p>
With citations, this is no longer true! Claude is now returning chunks
of text that aren’t just a plain string - they are annotated with
citations, which need to be stored and processed somehow by the LLM
library.
</p>
<p>
This isn’t the only edge-case of this type. DeepSeek recently released
their Reasoner API which has a similar problem: it can return two
different types of text, one showing reasoning text and one showing
final content. I
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/a5ca117dd0325c93a5b1f5a18c4a9e34">described
those differences here</a>.
</p>
<p>
I’ve opened a design issue to tackle this challenge in the LLM
repository: <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/716">Design an
abstraction for responses that are not just a stream of text</a>.
</p>
<h4 id="anthropic-s-strategy-contrasted-with-openai">
Anthropic’s strategy contrasted with OpenAI
</h4>
<p>
Another interesting aspect of this release is how it helps illustrate a
strategic difference between Anthropic and OpenAI.
</p>
<p>
OpenAI are increasingly behaving like a consumer products company. They
just made a big splash with their
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/23/introducing-operator/">Operator</a>
browser-automation agent system - a much more polished, consumer-product
version of Anthropic’s own
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/23/introducing-operator/">Computer
Use</a> demo from a few months ago.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, Anthropic are clearly focused much more on the developer /
“enterprise” market. This Citations feature is API-only and directly
addresses a specific need that developers trying to build reliable RAG
systems on top of their platform may not even have realized they had.

<blockquote cite="https://dustinewers.com/ignore-the-grifters/">
<p>
AI tools create a significant productivity boost for developers.
Different folks report different gains, but most people who try AI code
generation recognize its ability to increase velocity. Many people think
that means we’re going to need fewer developers, and our industry is
going to slowly circle the drain.
</p>
<p>
This view is based on a misunderstanding of why people pay for software.
A business creates software because they think that it will give them
some sort of economic advantage. The investment needs to pay for itself
with interest. There are many software projects that would help a
business, but businesses aren’t going to do them because the return on
investment doesn’t make sense.
</p>
<p>
When software development becomes more efficient, the ROI of any given
software project increases, which unlocks more projects. […] Cheaper
software means people are going to want more of it. More software means
more jobs for increasingly efficient software developers.

<h2 id="introducing-operator">Introducing Operator</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-23, updated: 2025-01-23, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-operator/">Introducing
Operator</a></strong>
</p>
OpenAI released their “research preview” today of Operator, a
cloud-based browser automation platform rolling out today to $200/month
ChatGPT Pro subscribers.
</p>
<p>
They’re calling this their first “agent”. In the Operator announcement
video Sam Altman defined that
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/31/llms-in-2024/#-agents-still-haven-t-really-happened-yet">notoriously
vague term</a> like this:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
AI agents are AI systems that can do work for you independently. You
give them a task and they go off and do it.
</p>
<p>
We think this is going to be a big trend in AI and really impact the
work people can do, how productive they can be, how creative they can
be, what they can accomplish.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The Operator interface looks very similar to Anthropic’s
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/22/computer-use/">Claude
Computer Use</a> demo from October, even down to the interface with a
chat panel on the left and a visible interface being interacted with on
the right. Here’s Operator:
</p>
<p>
<img alt="Screenshot of Operator. The user has asked the chat window to book a table at a restauraunt. The OpenTable website is visible on the right." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/operator-1.jpg" />
</p>
<p>
And here’s Claude Computer Use:
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/computer-use-sudoku.jpg" alt="A Sudoku puzzle is displayed - the bot has already filled in several squares incorrectly with invalid numbers which have a subtle pink background." style="max-width: 100%;">
</p>
<p>
Claude Computer Use required you to run a own Docker container on your
own hardware. Operator is much more of a product - OpenAI host a Chrome
instance for you in the cloud, providing access to the tool via their
website.
</p>
<p>
Operator runs on top of a brand new model that OpenAI are calling CUA,
for Computer-Using Agent. Here’s
<a href="https://openai.com/index/computer-using-agent/">their separate
announcement</a> covering that new model, which should also be available
via their API in the coming weeks.
</p>
<p>
This demo version of Operator is understandably cautious: it frequently
asked users for confirmation to continue. It also provides a “take
control” option which OpenAI’s demo team used to take over and enter
credit card details to make a final purchase.
</p>
<p>
The million dollar question around this concerns how they deal with
security. Claude Computer Use
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/25/zombais/">fell victim to
prompt injection attack at the first hurdle</a>.
</p>
<p>
Here’s what
<a href="https://openai.com/index/computer-using-agent/#safety">OpenAI
have to say about that</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
One particularly important category of model mistakes is
<strong>adversarial attacks on websites</strong> that cause the CUA
model to take unintended actions, through prompt injections, jailbreaks,
and phishing attempts. In addition to the aforementioned mitigations
against model mistakes, we developed several additional layers of
defense to protect against these risks:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Cautious navigation:</strong> The CUA model is designed to
identify and ignore prompt injections on websites, recognizing all but
one case from an early internal red-teaming session.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Monitoring:</strong> In Operator, we’ve implemented an
additional model to monitor and pause execution if it detects suspicious
content on the screen.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Detection pipeline:</strong> We’re applying both automated
detection and human review pipelines to identify suspicious access
patterns that can be flagged and rapidly added to the monitor (in a
matter of hours).
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
Color me skeptical. I imagine we’ll see all kinds of novel successful
prompt injection style attacks against this model once the rest of the
world starts to explore it.
</p>
<p>
My initial recommendation: start a fresh session for each task you
outsource to Operator to ensure it doesn’t have access to your
credentials for any sites that you have used via the tool in the past.
If you’re having it spend money on your behalf let it get to the
checkout, then provide it with your payment details and wipe the session
straight afterwards.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://cdn.openai.com/operator_system_card.pdf">Operator
System Card PDF</a> has some interesting additional details. From the
“limitations” section:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Despite proactive testing and mitigation efforts, certain challenges and
risks remain due to the difficulty of modeling the complexity of
real-world scenarios and the dynamic nature of adversarial threats.
Operator may encounter novel use cases post-deployment and exhibit
different patterns of errors or model mistakes. Additionally, we expect
that adversaries will craft novel prompt injection attacks and
jailbreaks. Although we’ve deployed multiple mitigation layers, many
rely on machine learning models, and with adversarial robustness still
an open research problem, defending against emerging attacks remains an
ongoing challenge.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Plus this interesting note on the CUA model’s limitations:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The CUA model is still in its early stages. It performs best on short,
repeatable tasks but faces challenges with more complex tasks and
environments like slideshows and calendars.
</p>

<h2 id="faculty-fight-night">Faculty Fight Night</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-23, from: McSweeney’s Internet Tendency</p>
<p>
To: Department of English<br /> Re: Faculty Fight Night
</p>
<p>
Thank you for your overwhelming interest in Faculty Fight Night. What
started as a modest departmental fundraiser has become a major
university charity event.
</p>
<p>
To your many questions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The format will be three one-minute rounds (wearing heavy gloves and
headgear) under the rules of the state boxing commission. Unlike in the
Toughman Competition, no kicking will be allowed.
</li>
<li>
Many of you have expressed interest in fighting individuals within the
English Department, but I must ask you to consider professors from other
departments. Interdepartmental bouts will generate more interest in the
community and student body and, consequently, more revenue for charity.
(However, we will do our best to accommodate those of you who still
insist on fighting another member of the department.)
</li>
<li>
Full-time faculty will not be allowed to fight teaching assistants. The
legal department strictly forbids this since TAs have a different
employment classification under state law. (Given the enthusiastic
response from full-time faculty, it appears TAs will not be needed.)
</li>
<li>
For insurance and legal reasons, no one will be allowed to fight more
than one weight class above their own.
</li>
<li>
As several of you suggested, I contacted the chancellor’s office, but
they will not yet commit. While they won’t stand in our way, their full
support will be contingent on our willingness to fight members of the
Athletic Department. My understanding is that the athletic director will
not fight, but the coaches would likely participate if invited or egged
on. A few of you mentioned to me that you would only be willing to fight
those holding PhDs, but I ask you to give serious consideration to
welcoming the coaches.
</li>
<li>
Three of you have already asked me about nicknames. One of you wants to
be known as Charles the Wrestler, and two of you have asked for The
Poetic Pugilist. Please see me to sign up for your nickname so that we
have no more duplication. I think it’s okay if two of you want to be The
Poetic Pugilist. You can fight each other for it.
</li>
<li>
Yes, you may design your own robes and trunks. These should more or less
conform to state boxing regulations. See me if you need a copy.
</li>
<li>
We have narrowed the field to two beneficiaries for the proceeds, and I
need your input before deciding. Several of you in the <span
class="caps">MFA</span> program have suggested Alcoholics Anonymous. I
have also had several PhD candidates suggest an Alzheimer’s charity.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Again, thanks for your enthusiasm about this project. See you in the
ring.

start of December, most notably:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Support for OpenAI’s
<a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models#o1">o1 model</a> - a
significant upgrade from <code>o1-preview</code> given its 200,000 input
and 100,000 output tokens (<code>o1-preview</code> was 128,000/32,768).
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/676">#676</a>
</li>
<li>
Support for the <code>gpt-4o-audio-preview</code> and
<code>gpt-4o-mini-audio-preview</code> models, which can accept audio
input: <code>llm -m gpt-4o-audio-preview -a
https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/pelican-joke-request.mp3</code>
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/677">#677</a>
</li>
<li>
A new <code>llm -x/–extract</code> option which extracts and returns the
contents of the first fenced code block in the response. This is useful
for prompts that generate code.
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/681">#681</a>
</li>
<li>
A new <code>llm models -q ‘search’</code> option for searching available
models - useful if you’ve installed a lot of plugins. Searches are case
insensitive. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/700">#700</a>
</li>
</ul>

Beat the Nazis</h2>

<p>
The story of Wojtek – the bear who took on the Nazis – amidst the death
