This is the OPML list of podcasts I follow. I keep it updated when I add or remove feeds. You are welcome to use this list, I publish it because I want to bootstrap this practice, of influencers sharing lists of podcasts they recommend. We can make this happen folks. Bootstrapping works.

The Dems stopped campaigning against Trump after winning the 2020 election and Trump never stopped. They failed to even see this. And it costs so little to keep the party on the air on social web. Highest priority now -- getting back on the air. Such a stupid unforced error. Blind.
