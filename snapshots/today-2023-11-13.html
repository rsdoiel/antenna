Irreverent Punks Trying to Flip the Energy System on Its Head</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-13, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDQ0MzcwOC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcyODQ1Mzg1OX0.lh0tE0zjfubQ7UZQeRgyUUS-mDM0WK12grWC1gi-e8k/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps" style>
The hottest ticket in Brooklyn last week wasn‚Äôt for an indie rock show
or a buzzy new restaurant. It was for the most niche, nerdiest clean
energy conference of the year ‚Äî the sold-out DERVOS 2023.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The conference name ‚Äî a satirical play on Davos, a stuffy, World
Economic Forum event attended by governmental and business elites ‚Äî
tells you much of what you need to know about this irreverent subculture
of the climate movement. A teaser video for DERVOS described it as a
‚Äúrad clean energy summit ‚Ä¶ where youths get DER-pilled and the hot takes
haven‚Äôt been approved by PR.‚Äù
</p>
<p style>
To translate, DERVOS is for people who are stoked about a category of
technologies known as ‚Äúdistributed energy resources,‚Äù or DERs. They
encompass pretty much any device that can generate or store energy, or
use energy flexibly, at the scale of a single building, like rooftop
solar panels, batteries, and smart thermostats. This kind of tech has
historically been written off as less important than big projects like
wind farms ‚Äî ‚Äúnice-to-haves‚Äù but incapable of cutting emissions at
climate-relevant scales. But once you get DER-pilled, another vision for
the future emerges.

Imagine a solar panel on every roof, a battery in every basement, and a
smart thermostat in every home. Now imagine these devices being
aggregated and synchronized across neighborhoods, cities, or entire
regions. If 5,000 batteries discharge at the same time, you‚Äôve got the
equivalent of a new power plant. If 5,000 smart thermostats turn the
temperature up by a few degrees on a hot summer day, you can prevent a
natural gas ‚Äúpeaker‚Äù plant from firing up. In that sense, DERs offer a
potentially faster option for growing the electric grid than large-scale
projects, and could provide significant savings ‚Äî around $10 billion in
avoided infrastructure costs by 2030, according to a
<a href="https://liftoff.energy.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/LIFTOFF_DOE_VVP_10062023_v4.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recent
Department of Energy report</a>.
</p>
<p>
But that‚Äôs not all. To the DER-pilled, this future will also be a
‚Äúbetter world, a higher performing world,‚Äù as James McGinniss, one of
the organizers of DERVOS, put it. It‚Äôs a world where your heating and
cooling and EV charging are orchestrated seamlessly to utilize the
cleanest power at the lowest cost; where solar panels and batteries
aren‚Äôt called upon to keep your lights on when the power goes out,
because they are preventing system-wide blackouts from occurring in the
first place.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúHow many industries can you work on that are going to completely change
the way one of our foundational systems works and flip it entirely on
its head?‚Äù Nathaniel Teichman, a DER-pilled former financial analyst,
told me at the conference. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anywhere else with
such importance or at such an inflection point.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
To kick things off at DERVOS, McGinniss painted a picture of an industry
on the verge of an explosion. ‚ÄúIt feels like if DERs were the internet,
it‚Äôs 1995,‚Äù he told the roughly 250-person crowd. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre very, very
early in this. And I think there‚Äôs massive, massive growth coming to
this space.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
The event was held at Newlab, a startup incubator located in a renovated
shipbuilding warehouse in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Unlike other energy
summits, it‚Äôs not put on by a trade association or a professional
organization. It‚Äôs organized by a loose collective called the DER
Taskforce, a bunch of enthusiasts who met on Twitter.
</p>
<p>
The story is a roadmap for movement-building in the modern age. It
started in March 2019, when McGinniss posted a tweet asking if anyone in
New York wanted to start a monthly happy hour to talk shop about
distributed energy. ‚ÄúLike 30 people responded. And I had like 100
Twitter followers,‚Äù he told me.
</p>
<p>
The tweet led to a group message called ‚ÄúDG Beers‚Äù (for distributed
generation) and eventually to a series of real life hangs. They got
drinks. They went to see
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Current_War" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>The
Current War</em></a>, a movie about the 19th century battle over which
electrical current system would prevail. They had people give powerpoint
presentations. When COVID-19 hit, they moved the monthly meetup to Zoom
and started a
<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/der-task-force/id1511642490" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">podcast</a>.
The group blew up. ‚ÄúSuddenly we had people from like, South Africa and
like, rural Alaska joining us,‚Äù said Duncan Campbell, another one of the
original members.
</p>
<p>
Regulars at the meetups told me it was unlike other networking spaces.
‚ÄúWhat stands out the most is the atmosphere of strong opinions, weakly
held,‚Äù said Kyle Baranka. ‚ÄúI think there‚Äôs a lot of people who are
intellectuals, who like getting into the big picture <em>and</em> the
small details. But they never take themselves too seriously.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
That‚Äôs also a fitting description of DERVOS, which covered broad, heady
topics like the concept of ‚Äúenergy abundance‚Äù with a combination of deep
expertise and lighthearted, often crude informality. ‚ÄúWe need to double
or triple the grid. That is crazy,‚Äù said Pier LaFarge, the CEO of a
company called Sparkfund, during the first panel, which contemplated the
potential for centralized grid planning. ‚ÄúThat is like the technical
challenge of the space race and the economic scale of the highway
system. That is non-trivial, societal shit.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
During the next session, Andy Frank, founder of the home retrofit
company Sealed, was talking about how DERs can help avoid the need to
build transmission lines and power plants. ‚ÄúWe need a ‚Äî and this is a
very technical term ‚Äî a <em>fuck-ton</em> of DERs to try to avoid an
even more fuck-ton of costs.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIs it a metric fuckton?‚Äù McGinniss, who was moderating the panel, shot
back. The audience burst out laughing.
</p>
<p>
The conference skewed very white and male. Nicole Green, another
founding member, speculated that it might be because that‚Äôs still the
demographic at a lot of university engineering programs. Integrating
DERs into the grid and into power markets is technologically
complicated, and the community is largely made up of engineers.
</p>
<p>
When I asked other attendees to describe the vibe, one said it was ‚Äútech
bro-ey, but better ‚Äî not as toxic.‚Äù Another said ‚Äúyoung and exciting.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIt feels a little bit like the energy industry underground, in a way,‚Äù
Baranka told me.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a rebellious, counter-establishment ethos within the DER
community,‚Äù said Teichman, ‚Äúboth by the nature of what it is and the
people it attracts.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Part of that comes from the fact that these technologies challenge the
monopoly utility model ‚Äî the way that electricity has been generated and
distributed and commoditized for decades through big, corporate power
plants. The DER community also likes to push back on the narrative that
tackling climate change requires sacrifice. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs also where the
irreverence bleeds in,‚Äù said McGinniss. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just like, this is an
awesome, exciting future. That‚Äôs what we want people to feel.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
To illustrate the point, McGinniss and his friends organized a DERVOS
afterparty with the first-ever ‚Äúvehicle to rave‚Äù demonstration. Working
with another group of DER-enthusiasts called the SOLARPUNKS, who

Lightning to power the sound system at an old fire station-turned-event

</p>
<p>
But this better, higher performing world is still mostly out of reach.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre mired in a lot of decades-old thinking at this point about DERs
and how they can be a part of all of this,‚Äù Campbell told the audience
at the start of the conference.
</p>
<p>
The obstacles preventing DERs from realizing their full potential was a
major theme of the day. Frank talked about how DERs aren‚Äôt properly
valued in energy markets. Leah Stokes, a political scientist from the
University of California, lamented that utilities haven‚Äôt taken DERs
seriously or integrated them into their resource planning. Jesse
Jenkins, an energy systems engineer from Princeton University, and
Heatmap contributor, suggested we regulate utilities differently so that
they have more incentive to utilize DERs. Jen Downing, a senior advisor
at the Department of Energy, said regulators need data showing that DERs
are reliable.
</p>
<p>
Part of the problem is that there‚Äôs no DER industry association, no one
advocating for funding or policy changes to support these solutions at
the state or national level. During last year‚Äôs conference, Jigar Shah,
a Department of Energy official and a sort of Godfather figure in the
DER scene, pushed the community to be more ambitious. ‚ÄúYou guys are left
out of the narrative, and it‚Äôs just fun, it‚Äôs sort of like, ‚Äôoh that‚Äôs
so cool, I‚Äôm glad that they‚Äôre doing that,‚Äô‚Äù he said, calling in to
deliver the keynote speech from the car during his family vacation.
</p>
<p>
The DER Task Force took up Shah‚Äôs call to arms and decided to use its
revenue from events and the podcast to hire Allison Bates Wannop, an
energy lawyer, to work on policy full time. At this year‚Äôs DERVOS,
Wannop announced the group‚Äôs initial plans, which include turning New
York State into a DER ‚Äúnirvana,‚Äù and a campaign to ‚Äúoccupy NARUC,‚Äù the
association for utility regulators that holds triannual conferences,
which are heavily attended by the natural gas industry.
</p>
<p>
Colleen Metelitsa, one of the founders of the Task Force, told me the
current landscape for DERs was like the internet before the iPhone came
out. There was a lot you could do with the existing technology, but the
iPhone ‚Äúproliferated so many things we do on the internet that we didn‚Äôt
even think about.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
What else, besides raves powered by pick-up trucks, does the future
hold?

Service Agents Protecting Biden‚Äôs Granddaughter Open Fire When 3 People
Try to Break Into SUV</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Secret Service agents protecting President Joe Biden‚Äôs granddaughter
opened fire after three people tried to break into an unmarked Secret
Service vehicle in the nation‚Äôs capital, a law enforcement official told
The Associated Press.</p>
<p>The agents, assigned to protect Naomi Biden, were out with her in the
Georgetown neighborhood late Sunday night when they saw the three people
breaking a window of the parked and unoccupied SUV, the official said.
The official could not discuss details of the investigation publicly and
spoke to the AP on Monday on the condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>One of the agents opened fire, but no one was struck by the gunfire,
the Secret Service said in a statement. The three people were seen
fleeing in a red car, and the Secret Service said it put out a regional
bulletin to Metropolitan Police to be on the lookout for it.</p>
<p>Washington has seen a significant rise in the number of carjackings
and car thefts this year. Police have reported more than 750 carjackings
this year and more than 6,000 reports of stolen vehicles in the
district. U.S. Rep.¬†Henry Cuellar of Texas was carjacked near the
Capitol last month by three armed assailants, who stole his car but
didn‚Äôt physically harm him.</p>
<p>Violent crime in Washington has also been on the rise this year, up
more than 40% compared with last year. In February, U.S. Rep.¬†Angie
Craig of Minnesota was assaulted in her apartment building, suffering
bruises while escaping serious injury.</p>

House Hopes Biden-Xi Meeting Leads to More Talks with China</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>When U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping meet
Wednesday in California, U.S. officials do not expect any major
breakthroughs that could dramatically improve the relationship.</p>
<p>Instead, White House officials say one of their main summit goals is
simply to ensure that both sides continue talking, to reduce the chances
that U.S.-China tensions spiral into conflict.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not talking about a long list of outcomes or deliverables,‚Äù a
senior Biden administration official conceded during a telephone
briefing to preview the Biden-Xi meeting.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe goals here really are about managing the competition, preventing
the downside risk of conflict, and ensuring channels of communication
are open,‚Äù the official added.</p>
<p>The meeting, which will occur on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation Summit, will be the first in-person interaction
between the two men in about a year. It will be Xi‚Äôs first U.S. visit in
six years.</p>
<p>During that time, relations have sunk to perhaps their lowest point
since the United States and China established diplomatic ties in
1979.</p>
<p>The two sides not only disagree over issues including Taiwan, trade,
human rights, and global governance ‚Äì U.S. and Chinese military planes
and ships now regularly have close and dangerous encounters in the East
and South China Sea</p>
<p>The Pentagon has repeatedly warned that such encounters could turn
deadly. But until recently, U.S. officials have had fewer and fewer
venues to raise such complaints, as Beijing closed many of the
communications channels to protest U.S. actions.</p>
<p>Beijing‚Äôs change in tone</p>
<p>In the months leading up to the Biden-Xi meeting, China‚Äôs opposition
to dialogue began to soften.</p>
<p>U.S. and Chinese officials now have held preliminary talks on a wide
range of issues, including arms control, macroeconomics, and climate
change.</p>
<p>In some instances, Xi surprised visiting U.S. delegations with a
personal reception that many observers saw as notably warm.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI have said many times, including to several presidents, we have
1,000 reasons to improve China-U.S. relations, but not one reason to
ruin them,‚Äù Xi told a visiting group of U.S. senators in Beijing.</p>
<p>Analysts say Xi‚Äôs change in tone can be attributed to domestic
factors, such as slower than expected post-Covid economic growth and
China‚Äôs struggle to attract foreign investment amid U.S. trade
restrictions.</p>
<p>By engaging with Washington, Xi may be trying to demonstrate to his
domestic audience and international partners that he remains in control
of China‚Äôs most important bilateral relationship, says Amanda Hsiao, a
senior China analyst at the Crisis Group.</p>
<p>Beijing was also likely caught off guard ‚Äúby just how hostile of an
external environment that it‚Äôs facing now,‚Äù said Hsiao. She cites the
international backlash to Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine, which resulted
in a ‚Äúnarrative of democracies versus authoritarian countries.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThat created‚Ä¶a rallying effect for Washington and its allies and
partners to form a bit of an anti-China coalition,‚Äù Hsiao added, citing
expanded U.S. alliances with South Korea, Japan, and the
Philippines.</p>
<p>Small steps</p>
<p>Though few expect the Biden-Xi meeting to transform the relationship,
officials and analysts point to several areas of progress that could
soon be announced.</p>
<p>Last week, U.S. climate envoy John Kerry said the United States and
China ‚Äì the world‚Äôs two biggest greenhouse gas emitters ‚Äì have reached
‚Äúunderstandings and agreements‚Äù that could lead to a more successful
United Nations climate change conference later this month in Dubai.
Details, Kerry said, would be released soon.</p>
<p>Biden may push Xi to take steps to reduce the flow of chemicals used
to make fentanyl, a dangerous narcotic that is responsible for tens of
thousands of drug overdoses in the United States each year.</p>
<p>The fentanyl issue represents a possible area where the two sides
‚Äúcan work immediately to enhance mutual trust and cooperation,‚Äù said
Zichen Wang, a research fellow at the Beijing-based Center for China and
Globalization research organization.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAccording to press reports, China has a positive attitude towards
the fentanyl issue and there is room to establish a regular
communication and control mechanism with the U.S. on the matter,‚Äù Wang
added.</p>
<p>China ended all talks over the fentanyl issue last year, after former
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan in a show of support for the
self-ruled island claimed by Beijing.</p>
<p>At the time, China also halted military dialogue with the United
States ‚Äì a matter of particular concern for Biden officials.</p>
<p>According to a White House official, Biden will press Xi
‚Äúassertively‚Äù on Wednesday to restore more military-to-military
communications.</p>
<p>However, Nathaniel Sher, a senior research analyst at Carnegie China,
warns that one meeting is unlikely to create a durable floor under the
U.S.-China relationship, especially ahead of elections in the United
States and Taiwan.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOne meeting, however, can prevent relations from deteriorating
further,‚Äù he said.</p>

<p>date: 2023-11-13, updated: 2023-11-08, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Artificial intelligence will change so many aspects of society, largely
in ways that we cannot conceive of yet. Democracy, and the systems of
governance that surround it, will be no exception. In this short essay,
I want to move beyond the ‚ÄúAI-generated disinformation‚Äù trope and
speculate on some of the ways AI will change how democracy functions‚Äîin
both large and small ways.
</p>
<p>
When I survey how artificial intelligence might upend different aspects
of modern society, democracy included, I look at four different
dimensions of change: speed, scale, scope, and sophistication. Look for
places where changes in degree result in changes of kind. Those are
where the societal upheavals will happen‚Ä¶

id="in-meeting-with-xi-biden-will-seek-restoration-of-military-communication">In
Meeting With Xi, Biden Will Seek Restoration of Military
Communication</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Reestablishing communication between militaries of the two
superpowers will be high on President Joe Biden‚Äôs agenda Wednesday
during a highly anticipated meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Xi
Jinping, in the San Francisco Bay area, a senior administration official
says.</p>
<p>The leaders will be meeting on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation summit that the U.S. is hosting.</p>
<p>The Biden-Xi summit¬†will be the first face-to-face meeting¬†between
the two presidents since they met last year in Bali, Indonesia.¬†</p>
<p>It‚Äôs a positive sign for the rocky U.S.-China relationship and
follows a wave of increased engagement between American and Chinese
officials. The administration already has sent several high-ranking
officials to Beijing this year, including Secretary of State Antony J.
Blinken, Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen and Commerce Secretary Gina
Raimondo.</p>
<p>Biden is ‚Äúdetermined to take the necessary steps‚Äù to reestablish
military communication channels with Beijing, said the senior
administration official, who spoke to reporters Thursday evening on the
condition of anonymity. The administration believes the step will inject
more stability into the relationship and lower the risk of a military
miscalculation. ¬†</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p>China suspended military communication last year to protest
then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi‚Äôs August visit to Taiwan. Included in
the suspension were the Defense Policy Coordination Talks, intended to
maintain effective communication channels and reduce risks, and the
Maritime Military Communications Agreement, which enables ship and
aircraft operators to communicate regularly. ¬†</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p>Blinken was unable to reestablish communication channels during his
visit to Beijing in June. ‚ÄúThe Chinese have been reluctant. And so, the
president is going to press assertively next week,‚Äù the senior
administration official said.</p>
<p>Joint Chiefs Chairman General Charles Q. Brown Jr.¬†told reporters
Friday that he had sent a letter to his Chinese counterpart, General Liu
Zhenli, underscoring the U.S. request. Brown said he was ‚Äúhopeful.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs reasonable to expect that there‚Äôs going to be some movement
toward the resumption of some level of important dialogue,‚Äù Michael D.
Swaine, a senior research fellow at the Quincy Institute for Responsible
Statecraft, a Washington think tank. ‚ÄúBut exactly to what extent and how
enduring it‚Äôs going to be, I think remains to be seen,‚Äù he told VOA.</p>
<p>Restarting the talks does not imply there will be any substantive
breakthroughs, warned Zack Cooper, a senior fellow focusing on U.S.
strategy in Asia at the American Enterprise Institute, a policy research
group in Washington. ¬†¬†</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p>‚ÄúBeijing continues to believe that crisis management mechanisms
generally favor the United States, by allowing Washington to operate
near China‚Äôs coast with less risk of escalation,‚Äù he told VOA. ‚ÄúSo,
although I expect some of these dialogues to restart, I would not assume
that they will be particularly productive.‚Äù</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p>Election interference¬†</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p>The Biden-Xi meeting comes just months before Taiwan‚Äôs presidential
election in January, and Washington wants Beijing not to meddle in the
campaign. China considers the self-governing island its wayward
province.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAny actions or interference in the election would raise extremely
strong concerns from our side,‚Äù said a second senior administration
official in the same briefing.</p>
<p>Such calls are likely to go unheeded. ‚ÄúI doubt that Beijing will have
any comments regarding a purported U.S. request not to interfere in
Taiwan elections,‚Äù Bonnie Glaser told VOA. Glaser is the managing
director of the Indo-Pacific Program at the German Marshall Fund of the
United States, a public policy research group. ¬†</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p>Beijing‚Äôs preferred candidate is former New Taipei City Mayor Hou
Yu-ih, candidate of the Kuomintang opposition party. Hou has been
campaigning on the message ‚ÄúVote for the Kuomintang, and there will be
no war on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.‚Äù ¬†</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p>But polls show that Vice President William Lai, who represents the
incumbent Democratic Progressive Party and favors a tougher approach to
Beijing, is in the lead. Experts predict a Lai win would lead to a much
more confrontational China.</p>
<p>In video remarks to a forum in Hong Kong on Thursday, China‚Äôs
ambassador to the United States, Xie Feng, said China wanted
reassurances that ‚Äúthe U.S. does not seek to change China‚Äôs system, does
not seek a new Cold War, does not support Taiwan independence and has no
intention to seek decoupling from China.‚Äù</p>
<p>Understanding between the U.S. and China on Taiwan is key, said Yun
Sun, director of the China Program at the Stimson Center, a Washington
think tank.</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe biggest issue is the stabilization of bilateral relations,‚Äù she
told VOA. ‚ÄúGiven the upcoming Taiwan elections, it is particularly
important for them to have some consensus to prepare for the upcoming
turmoil.‚Äù¬†</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p>Washington does not take a position on Taiwan‚Äôs sovereignty but
opposes unilateral changes to the status quo from either side ‚Äî
something that Biden will reaffirm to Xi. The president will ‚Äúensure
that we‚Äôre clear we are not supportive of Taiwan independence,‚Äù the
second official said.¬†</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p>Regional conflicts¬†</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p>The conversation is expected to cover a broad range of irritants in
the bilateral relationship, as well as global problems such as climate
change, artificial intelligence and the scourge of fentanyl.¬†</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p>The leaders will also share views on regional conflicts, including
North Korea‚Äôs weapons program, the war in Ukraine and the conflict in
Gaza, the officials said.¬†</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p>The president will convey to Xi that it is essential for Iran not to
widen the war in Gaza and spread violence in the Middle East. ‚ÄúIf Iran
undertakes provocative actions anywhere,‚Äù the senior administration
official said, ‚Äúthe United States is prepared to respond and respond
promptly.‚Äù¬†</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p>Beijing has growing clout in the region after it brokered a deal to
normalize relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran in March. So far,
China has carefully navigated the conflict between Israel and Hamas,
stopping short of explicitly taking sides, while calling for a
cease-fire and a two-state solution.</p>

id="biden-to-hear-muslim-world-views-on-gaza-in-meeting-with-indonesias-widodo">Biden
to Hear Muslim World Views on Gaza in Meeting with Indonesia‚Äôs
Widodo</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden is set to hear the views of the Muslim world
on the war in Gaza during a meeting with Indonesian President Joko
Widodo at the White House Monday afternoon.</p>
<p>Widodo is in Washington to elevate diplomatic ties to ‚Äúcomprehensive
strategic partnership,‚Äù the highest in the country‚Äôs diplomatic
ranking.</p>
<p>The leaders are far apart on their views of the conflict, with
Biden‚Äôs unwavering support of Israel and Widodo demanding an immediate
cease-fire in Gaza and supporting a United Nations commission¬†that has
been collecting evidence of war crimes allegedly committed by both sides
since the Oct.¬†7 attack by Hamas.¬†</p>
<p>Widodo will be meeting Biden fresh off an emergency summit of the
Organization of Islamic Cooperation, or OIC, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia
this past weekend.</p>
<p>The summit brought together 57 mostly Muslim-majority states
including the Arab League. Its communique rejected Israel‚Äôs
justification of its actions in Gaza as self-defense and demanded an
immediate end to the war. It called for a halt to the sale of arms to
Israel and increased access for humanitarian aid.</p>
<p>Making a statement to press virtually from Washington Sunday evening,
Widodo said that he will deliver the summit‚Äôs resolutions to Biden.
‚ÄúIsrael must take responsibility for the atrocities it has committed,‚Äù
he said.</p>
<p>President Biden will ‚Äúlisten carefully to what President Widodo heard
and what his perspectives are with respect to discussions he‚Äôs just
undertaken in Saudi Arabia and with other Arab and Middle East leaders,‚Äù
a senior administration official told VOA during a briefing Sunday.</p>
<p>While there is a massive gap between the two on immediate calls for a
cease-fire, which the United States believes at this point will only
benefit Hamas, Washington is seeking a point of convergence with Jakarta
further down the line. Indonesia is not a regional actor like Egypt,
Jordan or Qatar with key roles in the administration‚Äôs immediate goals,
such as securing the release of hostages and establishing humanitarian
corridors into Gaza.</p>
<p>As the largest Muslim majority country, Jakarta‚Äôs voice carries clout
in the administration‚Äôs medium- and long-term plans of resolving the
conflict and working toward a pathway to peace. About 229 million
Muslims live in Indonesia, making up 87% of the population. That‚Äôs 13%
of the world‚Äôs Muslim population.</p>
<p>‚ÄúJust peace, the two-state solution, substantial resources that will
be necessary to rebuild and give hope to shattered lives. I think those
are areas that we look forward to working closely with Indonesia on
giving its leading role,‚Äù the official said.</p>
<p>Like many Muslim countries, Indonesia has long provided aid to
Palestinians, including a hospital in northern Gaza. Hospital
administrators told VOA that the surrounding vicinity has been hit by
Israeli airstrikes and they are on the brink of collapse due to a lack
of supplies and fuel.</p>
<p>Widodo‚Äôs official visit, which was arranged to smooth ruffled
feathers after Biden skipped the ASEAN summit hosted by Indonesia in
September and went to Hanoi instead, will be a delicate balancing act
for Widodo.</p>
<p>Observers say he must speak forcefully enough to represent passions
at the OIC and avoid political damage at home, where massive anti-Israel
and anti-U.S. demonstrations have rocked major cities. Additionally,
they say he must be careful not to jeopardize progress on a long list of
common interests, including a deal on critical minerals and China‚Äôs
rising ambitions in the Indo-Pacific.</p>
<p>Critical minerals work plan</p>
<p>Indonesia is seeking a limited free trade agreement with the United
States, similar to the one the U.S. signed with Japan in March, to
include its nickel exports under the 2022 U.S. Inflation Reduction Act,
or IRA. The IRA, Biden‚Äôs key climate change and clean energy
legislation, offers tax incentives to boost domestic electric vehicle,
or EV, manufacturing.</p>
<p>The bill includes provisions for consumer tax credits to purchase EVs
produced with critical minerals sourced domestically or from a country
that has a free trade agreement with the U.S.</p>
<p>Boasting the world‚Äôs largest nickel reserves ‚Äì a key mineral in EV
production ‚Äì and aiming to be a global EV hub, Indonesia is keen on such
a deal. The Biden administration, meanwhile, wants to secure a supply
chain for its ambitious goal of ensuring that two-thirds of new
passenger cars and a quarter of new heavy trucks sold in the United
States are all electric by 2032.</p>
<p>The administration is seeking a process with Jakarta toward a
‚Äúconsequential partnership,‚Äù said the official. Washington, however, has
voiced concern over Indonesia‚Äôs reliance on Chinese investment in its
mining industry as well as labor and environmental issues in its mining
practices.</p>
<p>The pair will announce a ‚Äúwork plan‚Äù to explore a partnership on
critical minerals, said a second administration official, to ‚Äúmake sure
that both of our systems are prepared to move forward together.‚Äù The
official underscored that any agreed pathway forward must be in
accordance with the ‚Äúhighest of labor and environmental standards.‚Äù</p>
<p>The plan has received pushback from some in the U.S. mining industry,
which has received funding as part of the Biden administration‚Äôs efforts
to boost domestic production of nickel, lithium and other metals needed
for EVs.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAt the end of the day, neither the president nor Congress can
support a scheme that facilitates U.S. taxpayer funds going to Chinese
companies mining and refining Indonesian critical minerals through a
trade agreement that does not include environmental and labor
protections,‚Äù Julie C. Lucas, executive director of the industry group
MiningMinnesota, told VOA in a statement.</p>
<p>China.</p>
<p>Biden and Widodo will elevate diplomatic ties to a ‚Äúcomprehensive
strategic partnership,‚Äù a status that Jakarta already shares with
Beijing. Under Widodo, Indonesia has embraced China‚Äôs massive
infrastructure project known as the Belt and Road Initiative, attracting
a record amount of Chinese investment. It‚Äôs second only to Pakistan in
terms of value of BRI projects ‚Äî $20.3 billion and 71 operating
projects.</p>
<p>Observers say Chinese President Xi Jinping is eyeing the vast
archipelago as a key prize in expanding Beijing‚Äôs influence in the
Indo-Pacific. Just last month, he announced an expansion of cooperation
with Indonesia on emerging industries such as the digital economy,
photovoltaics and EVs. Photovoltaics involve converting light into
electricity.</p>
<p>While Jakarta relies heavily on Chinese investments, observers say it
is wary of Beijing‚Äôs increasingly assertive claims to disputed waters in
the South China Sea. Like many countries in the region, it has been
boosting military ties with Washington.</p>
<p>After his Washington stop, Widodo heads to San Francisco for the Asia
Pacific Economic Cooperation summit hosted by the U.S. Biden is set to
meet with Xi on the sidelines of the APEC summit and is keen to use
discussions with Widodo to inform him on regional views on Beijing.</p>
<p>Those include ‚Äúcritical issues like the South China Sea, what they‚Äôre
seeing and with respect to China‚Äôs diplomacy and engagement,‚Äù the first
senior official said.</p>
<p>The pair will also be discussing the crisis in Myanmar. Since a
February 2021 military coup, the junta in Myanmar has carried out a
brutal nationwide crackdown on millions of people opposed to its rule,
ignoring demands by Indonesia and other members of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations for constructive dialogue and an immediate
cessation of violence.</p>

<p>
I like my Markdown ‚Üí HTML + CSS ‚Üí PDF pipeline. For new PDFs of mine, I
try to use this setup rather than relying on LaTeX. It‚Äôs true, LaTeX
documents probably look better in the end. But I don‚Äôt write enough
LaTeX at the end of the day. Everything is always tricky to find.
Packages are hard to pick. I always end up on some StackExchange site
and nothing is ever simple.
</p>
<p>
Now, the Markdown ‚Üí HTML + CSS ‚Üí PDF pipeline isn‚Äôt simple, either. But
it uses HTML and CSS and I use those two more often. I can look at the
using the browser. When I have questions, I end up on the Mozilla
Developer Network (MDN) and it‚Äôs not too bad. It‚Äôs the kind of bad that
I‚Äôm used to.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm doing a great job selling this. Remember how many years
I tried to be objective about it all and concluded that using Libre
Office would be the most efficient tool. But I guess I got burned back
in the last millenium when Word 5.1 was new and liked to crash, and Open
Office was not great either, and Abi Word was too limited. I learned to
love Emacs and LaTeX and I don‚Äôt want to go back to those graphical user
interfaces.
</p>
<p>
Somehow they make it hard to use styles correctly and consistenly.
</p>
<p>
So here‚Äôs a short summary of how the Markdown ‚Üí HTML + CSS ‚Üí PDF
pipeline works.
</p>
<p>
There are a number of things you need:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
a bunch of Markdown files, which you write using your favourite editor

a program to turn Markdown into HTML; by chance I started using Python
with the Markdown module
</li>
<li>
a CSS file to format it
</li>
<li>
a program to turn HTML and CSS into PDF; the one I use is called
weasyprint
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Weasyprint is also written in Python, which shouldn‚Äôt matter too much ‚Äì
except that I have Debian installed and the weasyprint it comes with
doesn‚Äôt know how to hyphenate my text, which is bad news when you‚Äôre
writing a German text with long words. And what German text doesn‚Äôt have
long words? We love smashing words together!
</p>
<p>
This leads me to an immediate problem that LaTeX solves but that
weasyprint does not: In German, you can‚Äôt have ligatures connecting
parts of a word that are themselves smashed-together words. For example,
the word Auffahrt (up-drive, also known as Ascension Day) consists of
the prefix ‚Äúauf‚Äù and the word ‚Äúfahrt‚Äù so you can‚Äôt use the Ô¨Ä ligature.
There‚Äôs a LaTeX package for that,
<a href="https://github.com/micoloretan/selnolig/" rel="nofollow">selnolig</a>.
</p>
<p>
A while ago I wrote a Perl script that takes this file and does the
right thing for HTML: it inserts ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER characters in all
those places. This Perl script is called
<a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/keine-ligaturen.git" rel="nofollow">keine-ligaturen</a>,
no ligatures.
</p>
<p>
So I need that.
</p>
<p>
Now, Python‚Äôs Markdown module doesn‚Äôt generate a stand-alone HTML file.
I need to provide my own prefix and suffix.
</p>
<p>
<code>prefix</code> is where I define the language to use for
hyphenation and the CSS file to use for the formatting.
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html lang=de&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;/&gt;
    &lt;link type=&#34;text/css&#34; rel=&#34;stylesheet&#34; href=&#34;Horte.css&#34;/&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
<code>suffix</code> is the file where I close the <code>html</code> and
<code>body</code> tags I opened in the <code>prefix</code> file.
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
I tie all of this together in my <code>Makefile</code>. Here‚Äôs how it
might work.
</p>
<pre><code>SHELL=/bin/bash
KAPITEL=$(sort $(wildcard [0-9A-F]-*.md))

all: Horte.pdf

%.pdf: %.html %.css
    weasyprint $&lt; $@

%.html: %.html.tmp prefix suffix append-index
    cat prefix $&lt; suffix | perl append-index &gt; $@

%.html.tmp: %.md
    python3 -m markdown \n
        --extension=markdown.extensions.attr_list \
        --extension=markdown.extensions.tables \
        --extension markdown.extensions.smarty \
        $&lt; \
    | keine-ligaturen &gt; $@

Horte.md: Titelblatt.md Lizenz.md $(KAPITEL)
    date &#39;+&lt;p class=&#34;timestamp&#34;&gt;%F&lt;/p&gt;&#39; &gt; timestamp
    cat Titelblatt.md timestamp $(KAPITEL) Lizenz.md &gt; $@

clean:
    rm -f Horte.md Horte.html Horte.html.tmp \
          Horte.pdf
</code></pre>
<p>
So this is what happens:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
all the Markdown files are concatenated into <code>Horte.md</code> (and
a timestamp is added after the titlepage)
</li>
<li>
the Markdown file is turned into a temporary HTML file called
<code>Horte.html.tmp</code> using the Python Markdown module and the
German ligature breaks are added by the <code>keine-ligaturen</code>
Perl script
</li>
<li>
the temporary HTML file is concatenated with the <code>prefix</code> and
<code>sufix</code> files to form the real HTML file, called
<code>Horte.html</code> and here yet another Perl script is used:
<code>append-index</code> (more about that below)
</li>
<li>
finally, the HTML file is turned into PDF using <code>weasyprint</code>
resulting in <code>Horte.pdf</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Now we‚Äôre finally getting to the script I wanted to talk about this
entire time. What‚Äôs the role of <code>append-index</code>? It parses the
HTML file and determines which terms should be in the index using XPath.
And then it adds an index at the end.
</p>
<p>
There are two parts to the script. In the first part, the terms to index
are collected.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
the HMTL is parsed and an XPath expression is used to search for strings
to index (in this case: H3 headings and bold text in blockquotes if they
have the <code>ref</code> class)
</li>
<li>
if the term has no <code>id</code>, an <code>id</code> is computed based
on the term to index; a number is appended if the <code>id</code>
computed turns out to be a duplicate
</li>
<li>
every term is associated with a list of ids (in case a term appears
multiple times)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
In the second part, the HTML for the Index page is assembled. Every term
is printed, followed by a link for every <code>id</code> recorded above.
The text of the link is a ZERO WIDTH SPACE so that it doesn‚Äôt look weird
in the PDF. The actual page number to use is still unknown at this point
because only the PDF generator knows about the pages! See below for
more.
</p>
<pre><code>use Modern::Perl &#39;2018&#39;;

</code></pre>
<p>
Here is some example Markdown illustrating the functionality:
</p>
<pre><code>Elfen verwenden gerne grosse [Raubkatzen](#katze) zum Schutz ihrer Lager.

&gt; **Pumas**{: .ref ref=&#34;Puma&#34;} (1W6-3) TW 3 RK 14 1W6 RW¬†+1 BW 24 ML 7
&gt; EP 300

### Raubkatzen {: #katze}

&gt; **Puma**{: .ref} TW 3 RK 14 1W6 RW¬†+1 BW 24 ML 7 EP 300
</code></pre>
<p>
The XPath expression find the following terms:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
‚ÄúPumas‚Äù because of <code>class="ref"</code> and determines that the term
to use is ‚ÄúPuma‚Äù (singular) because of <code>ref="Puma"</code>
</li>
<li>
‚ÄúRaubkatzen‚Äù because it‚Äôs a H3 heading
</li>
<li>
‚ÄúPuma‚Äù because of <code>class="ref"</code> and this time the term is the
text content
</li>
</ul>
<p>
HTML generated for the Index:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div id=&#34;index&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Index&lt;/h2&gt;
‚Ä¶
&lt;p&gt;Puma&lt;a class=&#34;ref&#34; href=&#34;#puma&#34;&gt;‚Äã&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;ref&#34; href=&#34;#puma2&#34;&gt;‚Äã&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raubkatzen&lt;a class=&#34;ref&#34; href=&#34;#katze&#34;&gt;‚Äã&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
‚Ä¶
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
The magic for page numbers is in the CSS, namely in the last rule where
it says that the content of index links is a space and
<code>target-counter(attr(href), page)</code>.
</p>
<pre><code>/* index */
#index {
    columns: 3;
    column-gap: 2ex;
    font-size: 11pt;
    line-height: 13pt;
    text-align: left;
}
#index h2 {
    column-span: all;
}
#index p {
    margin: 0;
    padding-left: 1em;
    text-indent: -1em;

#index a {
    color: inherit;
    text-decoration: none;

id="south-carolina-sen.-tim-scott-abruptly-ends-2024-presidential-bid">South
Carolina Sen.¬†Tim Scott Abruptly Ends 2024 Presidential Bid</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Republican presidential candidate Tim Scott abruptly announced late
Sunday that he was dropping out of the 2024 race, a development that
surprised his donors and stunned his campaign staff just two months
before the start of voting in Iowa‚Äôs leadoff Republican Party
caucuses.</p>
<p>The South Carolina senator, who entered the race in May with high
hopes, made the surprise announcement on Fox News Channel‚Äôs ‚ÄúSunday
Night in America‚Äù with Trey Gowdy, one of his closest friends. The news
was so unanticipated that one campaign worker told The Associated Press
that campaign staff found out Scott was dropping out by watching the
show.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI love America more today than I did on May 22,‚Äù Scott said Sunday.
‚ÄúBut when I go back to Iowa, it will not be as a presidential candidate.
I am suspending my campaign. I think the voters who are the most
remarkable people on the planet have been really clear that they‚Äôre
telling me, ‚ÄòNot now, Tim.‚Äô‚Äù</p>
<p>Scott‚Äôs impending departure comes as he and the rest of the
Republican field have struggled in a race that has been dominated by
former President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Despite four criminal indictments and a slew of other legal
challenges, Trump continues to poll far ahead of his rivals, leading
many in the party to conclude the race is effectively over, barring some
stunning change of fortune.</p>
<p>Scott, in particular, has had trouble gaining traction in the polls,
despite millions spent on his behalf by high-profile donors. In his
efforts to run a positive campaign, he was often overshadowed by other
candidates ‚Äî particularly on the debate stage, where he seemed to
disappear as others sparred. It was unclear whether Scott would qualify
for the upcoming fourth debate, which will require higher polling
numbers and more donors.</p>
<p>Scott is the second major candidate to leave the race since the end
of October. Former Vice President Mike Pence suspended his campaign two
weeks ago, announcing at a Republican Jewish Coalition gathering in Las
Vegas, ‚ÄúThis is not my time.‚Äù Pence, however, was polling behind Scott
and was in a far more precarious financial position.</p>
<p>Scott said he wouldn‚Äôt immediately be endorsing any of his remaining
Republican rivals.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe voters are really smart,‚Äù Scott said. ‚ÄúThe best way for me to be
helpful is to not weigh in on who they should endorse.‚Äù</p>
<p>He also appeared to rule out serving as vice president, saying the
No.¬†2 slot ‚Äúhas never been on my to-do list for this campaign, and it‚Äôs
certainly not there now.‚Äù</p>
<p>Scott‚Äôs departure leaves Nikki Haley, Trump‚Äôs first United Nations
ambassador and the former South Carolina governor, as the sole South
Carolinian in the race.</p>
<p>As governor, Haley appointed Scott ‚Äî then newly elected to his second
U.S. House term ‚Äî to the Senate in 2012, and the fact that both were in
the 2024 race had created an uncomfortable situation for many of the
donors and voters who had supported them both through the years.</p>
<p>It also sparked some unpleasant on-stage moments during the first
three Republican debates, with the longtime allies ‚Äî who for a time had
also shared political consultants ‚Äî trading tense jabs. After the
surprise announcement, some of Scott‚Äôs donors said they would be
switching to back Haley in the primary.</p>
<p>In a post on X on Sunday night, Haley called Scott ‚Äúa good man of
faith and an inspiration to so many,‚Äù adding that the Republican primary
‚Äúwas made better by his participation in it.‚Äù</p>
<p>Scott‚Äôs team was so surprised by his exit that just 13 minutes before
he announced his departure, his campaign sent out an email soliciting
supporters for donations to further Scott‚Äôs ‚Äústrong leadership and
optimistic, positive vision to lead our country forward.‚Äù Saying that
‚ÄúEVERYTHING is on the line‚Äù to win the White House, the email went on
offering readers ‚ÄúONE LAST CHANCE to donate this weekend and help Tim
reach his campaign goal.‚Äù</p>
<p>Campaign staffers expressed their extreme irritation to the AP in
light of the candidate recently shifting staff and money from New
Hampshire to Iowa in an effort to boost his standing in the leadoff
caucus.</p>
<p>A senior staffer characterized the experience as incredibly
frustrating, saying that staff had been working around the clock to
accommodate the move, only to completely reverse it. As with the
campaign worker who said Scott‚Äôs staff found out about his departure by
watching the senator on TV, the worker was not authorized to discuss the
internal deliberations publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>Many donors were surprised and saddened by Scott‚Äôs announcement,
though they praised him for stepping aside to give Republicans a chance
to coalesce behind a Trump alternative.</p>
<p>Eric Levine, a New York-based donor who was raising money for Scott,
said he was caught totally off guard.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHe stepped aside with dignity. He is a true patriot. I could not
have been prouder to have supported him,‚Äù said Levine, a vocal Trump
critic. He said he would now be supporting Haley.</p>
<p>‚ÄúShe is our last best hope to defeat Donald Trump and then take back
the White House,‚Äù Levine said.</p>
<p>Chad Walldorf, a South Carolina businessman and longtime Scott
supporter and donor, thought Scott‚Äôs decision was in the best interest
of the Republican Party.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôve always thought the field needs to winnow quickly so we can get
behind a good alternative to Trump, so I greatly respect Tim for
unselfishly stepping aside rather than waiting until too late,‚Äù said
Walldorf, who added he‚Äôs now backing Haley.</p>
<p>Mikee Johnson, a South Carolina businessman and Scott donor who
served as his national finance co-chairman, told the AP that he knew
before Scott‚Äôs TV appearance that he would be suspending his
campaign.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHe is honorable, knows his supporters were prepared to support him
for the duration, and was not going to ask that of his friends and
supporters,‚Äù said Johnson. ‚ÄúHe is energized and ready for the next
phase. ‚Ä¶ I told him I did not have a single regret.‚Äù</p>
<p>Many of Scott‚Äôs former 2024 rivals issued statements Sunday night
wishing him well.</p>
<p>On social media, Florida Gov.¬†Ron DeSantis commended him as a ‚Äústrong
conservative with bold ideas about how to get our country back on
track,‚Äù adding, ‚ÄúI respect his courage to run this campaign and thank
him for his service to America and the U.S. Senate.‚Äù</p>
<p>Pence called Scott ‚Äúa man of faith and integrity who brought his
optimistic vision and inspiring personal story to people all across this
country.‚Äù</p>
<p>Trump‚Äôs campaign did not immediately respond to news of Scott‚Äôs exit.
But Trump has been careful not to criticize the senator, leading some in
his orbit to consider Scott a potential vice presidential pick.</p>
<p>The former president and his team had welcomed a large field of
rivals, believing they would splinter the anti-Trump vote and prevent a
clear challenger from emerging.</p>
<p>Scott‚Äôs next move is not clear. He has said that his 2022 Senate
reelection would be his last and has at times been mentioned as a
possible candidate for South Carolina governor, which is next up in
2026. Gov.¬†Henry McMaster, a Trump backer, is term-limited, and the
Republican primary is expected to be heated.</p>

Massive Fire Closes Los Angeles Interstate, Motorists Urged to Take
Public Transport</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Los Angeles motorists should expect traffic snarls indefinitely as
crews assess how much damage was caused by a raging fire that closed a
major elevated interstate near downtown, officials said Sunday.</p>
<p>Hazardous materials teams were clearing burned material from
underneath Interstate 10 to make way for engineers to make sure the
columns and deck of the highway can support the 300,000 vehicles that
typically travel that route daily, Gov.¬†Gavin Newsom said at a news
conference.</p>
<p>‚ÄúRemember, this is an investigation as to the cause of how this
occurred, as well as a hazmat and structural engineering question,‚Äù
Newsom said. ‚ÄúCan you open a few lanes? Can you retrofit the columns? Is
the bridge deck intact to allow for a few lanes to remain open
again?‚Äù</p>
<p>Newsom said answering those questions would be a ‚Äú24-7 operation,‚Äù
but officials couldn‚Äôt yet offer a timeline for when the highway might
reopen.</p>
<p>Commuters were urged to work from home or take public transportation
into downtown Los Angeles. The I-10 closure between Alameda Street and
Santa Fe Avenue will have ripple effects on surface streets and other
key freeways including State Route 60 and Interstate 5, the California
Highway Patrol said.</p>
<p>The cause of the fire was under investigation. Flames reported around
12:20 a.m. Saturday raged through two storage lots in an industrial area
underneath the highway, burning piles of wooden pallets, parked cars and
support poles for high-tension power lines, Fire Chief Kristin M.
Crowley said. No injuries were reported.</p>
<p>More than 160 firefighters from 26 companies responded to the blaze,
which spread across 8 acres (3 hectares) ‚Äî the equivalent of about six
football fields ‚Äî and burned for more than three hours. The highway‚Äôs
columns are charred and chipped, while guardrails along the deck are
twisted and blackened.</p>
<p>Newsom declared a state of emergency Saturday afternoon and directed
the state Department of Transportation to request assistance from the
federal government.</p>
<p>The governor said Sunday that the state has been in litigation with
the owner of the business leasing the storage property where the fire
started. The lease is expired, Newsom said, and the business had been in
arrears while subleasing the space. ‚ÄúThis is a site we were aware of,
this is a lessee we were aware of,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>California Secretary of Transportation Toks Omishakin said storage
yards under highways are common statewide and across the country. He
said the practice would be reevaluated following the fire.</p>
<p>At least 16 homeless people living underneath the highway were
evacuated and brought to shelters, Mayor Karen Bass said. Officials said
there was no immediate indication that the blaze began at the
encampment.</p>
<p>Bass said the fire‚Äôs long-term impact was reminiscent of damage from
the Northridge earthquake that flattened freeways in 1994.</p>
<p>‚ÄúUnfortunately, there is no reason to think that this is going to be
over in a couple of days,‚Äù she said.</p>

football fields ‚Äî and burned for more than three hours. The highway‚Äôs
columns are charred and chipped, while guardrails along the deck are
twisted and blackened.</p>
<p>Newsom declared a state of emergency Saturday afternoon and directed
the state Department of Transportation to request assistance from the
federal government.</p>
<p>The governor said Sunday that the state has been in litigation with
the owner of the business leasing the storage property where the fire
started. The lease is expired, Newsom said, and the business had been in
arrears while subleasing the space. ‚ÄúThis is a site we were aware of,
this is a lessee we were aware of,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>California Secretary of Transportation Toks Omishakin said storage
yards under highways are common statewide and across the country. He
said the practice would be reevaluated following the fire.</p>
<p>At least 16 homeless people living underneath the highway were
evacuated and brought to shelters, Mayor Karen Bass said. Officials said
there was no immediate indication that the blaze began at the
encampment.</p>
<p>Bass said the fire‚Äôs long-term impact was reminiscent of damage from
the Northridge earthquake that flattened freeways in 1994.</p>
<p>‚ÄúUnfortunately, there is no reason to think that this is going to be
over in a couple of days,‚Äù she said.</p>

id="another-wildfire-burns-in-hawaii-this-one-is-destroying-a-rainforest">Another
Wildfire Burns in Hawaii, This One is Destroying a Rainforest</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A wildfire burning in a remote Hawaii rainforest is underscoring a
new reality for the normally lush island state just a few months after a
devastating blaze on a neighboring island leveled an entire town and
killed at least 99 people.</p>
<p>No one was injured and no homes burned in the latest fire, which
scorched mountain ridges on Oahu, but the flames wiped out irreplaceable
native forestland that‚Äôs home to nearly two dozen fragile species. And
overall, the ingredients are the same as they were in Maui‚Äôs historic
town of Lahaina: severe drought fueled by climate change is creating
fire in Hawaii where it has almost never been before.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt was really beautiful native forest,‚Äù said JC Watson, the manager
of the Koolau Mountains Watershed Partnership, which helps take care of
the land. He recalled it had uluhe fern, which often dominate Hawaii
rainforests, and koa trees whose wood has traditionally been used to
make canoes, surfboards and ukuleles.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a full-on clean burn, but it is pretty moonscape-looking
out there,‚Äù Watson said.</p>
<p>The fact that this fire was on Oahu‚Äôs wetter, windward side is a ‚Äúred
flag to all of us that there is change afoot,‚Äù said Sam ‚ÄôOhu Gon III,
senior scientist and cultural adviser at The Nature Conservancy in
Hawaii.</p>
<p>The fire mostly burned inside the Oahu Forest National Wildlife
Refuge, which is home to 22 species listed as endangered or threatened
by the U.S. government. They include iiwi and elepaio birds, a tree
snail called pupu kani oe and the Hawaiian hoary bat, also known as
opeapea. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which manages the refuge,
does not know yet what plants or wildlife may have been damaged or
harmed by the fire, spokesperson Kristen Oleyte-Velasco said.</p>
<p>The fire incinerated 6.5 square kilometers (2.5 square miles) since
first being spotted on Oct.¬†30 and was 90% contained as of Friday.
Officials were investigating the cause of the blaze roughly 32
kilometers (20 miles) north of Honolulu.</p>
<p>The flames left gaping, dark bald spots amid a blanket of thick green
where the fire did not burn. The skeletons of blackened trees poked from
the charred landscape.</p>
<p>The burn area may seem relatively small compared to wildfires on the
U.S. continent, which can raze hundreds of square miles. But Hawaii‚Äôs
intact native ecosystems aren‚Äôt large to begin with, especially on
smaller islands like Oahu, so even limited fires have far-reaching
consequences.</p>
<p>One major concern is what plants will grow in place of the native
forest.</p>
<p>Hawaii‚Äôs native plants evolved without encountering regular fires,
and fire is not part of their natural life cycle. Faster-growing
non-native plants with more seeds tend to sprout in place of native
species afterward.</p>
<p>Watson said an Oahu forest near the latest fire had uluhe ferns, koa
trees and ohia trees before a blaze burned less than a square mile of it
2015. Now the land features invasive grasses that are more fire-prone,
and some slow-growing koa.</p>
<p>A much larger 2016 fire in the Waianae mountains on the other side of
Oahu took out one of the last remaining populations of a rare tree
gardenia, said Gon.</p>
<p>There are cultural losses when native forest burns. Gon recalled an
old Central Oahu story about a warrior who was thrown off a cliff while
battling an enemy chief. His fall was stopped by an ohia tree, another
plant common in the incinerated area.¬†</p>
<p>Feathers from Hawaii‚Äôs forest birds were once used to make cloaks and
helmets worn by chiefs.</p>
<p>Watson‚Äôs organization is coordinating with the Fish and Wildlife
Service to conduct initial surveys of the damage. They‚Äôll devise a
restoration plan that will include invasive species control and planting
native species. But there are limits to what can be done.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôll never be able to be returned to its previous state within our
lifetimes,‚Äù Watson said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs forever changed, unfortunately.‚Äù</p>
<p>The Mililani Mauka fire ‚Äî named after the area near where the fire
began ‚Äî burned in the Koolau mountains. These mountains are on Oahu‚Äôs
wetter, windward side because they trap moisture and rain that move
across the island from the northeast.</p>
<p>But repeated and more prolonged episodes of drought are making even
the Koolaus dry. Gon expects more frequent Koolau fires in the
future.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere has been a huge uptick in the last 10 years, largely in
Waianae range, which is the western and drier portion of the island,‚Äù
Gon said. ‚ÄúBut now we‚Äôre seeing fires in the wet section of the island
that normally doesn‚Äôt see any fires at all.‚Äù</p>
<p>Hawaii fires are almost always started by humans, so Gon said more
needs to be done to raise awareness about prevention. Native forests
could be further protected with buffer zones by planting less flammable
vegetation in former sugarcane and pineapple plantation lands often
found at lower elevations, he said.</p>
<p>Many of these now-fallow fields sprout dry, invasive grasses. Such
grasses fueled the blaze that raced across Lahaina in August,
highlighting their dangers. The cause of that fire is still being
investigated, but it may have been sparked by downed power lines that
ignited dry grass. Winds related to a powerful hurricane passing to the
south helped spread the blaze, which destroyed more than 2,000 buildings
and homes for some 8,000 people.</p>
<p>The fire is likely to affect Oahu‚Äôs fresh water supply, though this
is challenging to measure. Oahu‚Äôs 1 million residents and visitors get
their drinking water from aquifers, but it usually takes decades for
rain to seep through the ground to recharge them. Native forests are the
best at absorbing rain, so the disappearance of high-quality forest is
certain to have some effect, Watson said.</p>
<p>State officials are seeking additional funding from the Legislature
next year for updated firefighting equipment, firebreaks, new water
sources for fire suppression, replanting native trees and plants, and
seed storage.</p>
<p>Firefighters and rain last week finally tamped down the Oahu blaze,
but Gon urged action now ‚Äúto make sure that it doesn‚Äôt turn into yearly
fires nibbling away at the source of our water supply.‚Äù</p>

Apple Network Server‚Äôs all-too-secret weapon: PPC Toolbox</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-13, from: OS News</p>
<p>However, there was a secret weapon hidden in ANS AIX most of us at
the time never knew about. Built-in to the operating system was a fully
Unix-native AppleTalk stack and support for receiving and sending Apple
Events, surfaced in the form of Apple‚Äôs disk administration tools and
AppleShare. But Apple had a much more expansive vision for this feature:
full server-client ‚Äúsymbiotic‚Äù applications that could do their
number-crunching on the ANS and present the results on a desktop Mac.
Using the Program-to-Program Communication Toolbox (‚ÄúPPCToolbox‚Äù), and
because AIX‚Äôs throughput far exceeded anything the classic Mac OS ever
could ever handle, an ANS could augment a whole bunch of Macs at once
that didn‚Äôt have to stop to do the work themselves. Well, today we‚Äôre
going to write one of those ‚Äúsymbiotic‚Äù applications doing something
this little Mystic Color Classic could never efficiently do itself ‚Äî
accessing and processing a JSON API over TLS 1.3 ‚Äî and demonstrate not
only how such an client application looked on the Mac side, but also how
the server component worked on the AIX side. If you‚Äôre lucky enough to
have an ANS running AIX too, you can even compile and run it yourself.
But before we do that, it might be a little instructive to talk about
how the Apple Network Server came to run AIX in the first place. I had
no idea the ANS could do this. That‚Äôs an incredibly cool feature, and
clearly fits in the whole ‚Äúthe network is the computer‚Äù idea that
dominated the late ‚Äô90s.</p>

Strikes Iran-Linked Sites in Eastern Syria, Pentagon Chief Says</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The United States carried out strikes against two Iran-linked sites
in Syria on Sunday in response to attacks on American personnel, Defense
Secretary Lloyd Austin said.</p>
<p>It is the third time in less than three weeks that the U.S. military
has targeted locations in Syria it said were tied to Iran, which
supports various armed groups that Washington blames for a spike in
attacks on its forces in the Middle East.</p>
<p>‚ÄúU.S. military forces conducted precision strikes today on facilities
in eastern Syria used by Iran‚Äôs Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC)
and Iran-affiliated groups in response to continued attacks against U.S.
personnel in Iraq and Syria,‚Äù Austin said in a statement.¬† ¬†</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe strikes were conducted against a training facility and a safe
house near the cities of Albu Kamal and Mayadeen, respectively,‚Äù he
said. ¬†</p>
<p>The United States targeted a Tehran-linked weapons storage site in
Syria on Wednesday, and also hit two facilities in the country on
October 26 that it said were used by Iran and affiliated organizations.
¬†</p>
<p>Washington says the series of strikes is in response to repeated
attacks on American forces in Iraq and Syria ‚Äì more than 45 since
October 17 ‚Äì that have wounded dozens of U.S. personnel. ¬†</p>
<p>The surge in attacks on U.S. troops in recent weeks is linked to the
war between Israel and Hamas, which began when the Palestinian militant
group carried out a shock cross-border attack from Gaza on October 7
that Israeli officials say killed about 1,200 people. ¬†</p>
<p>Israel‚Äôs military responded with a relentless air, land and naval
assault on Gaza that the territory‚Äôs health ministry said has killed
more than 11,100 people ‚Äì deaths that have sparked widespread anger in
the Middle East, and criticism against Washington from Iran-backed
groups. ¬†</p>
<p>There are roughly 2,500 American troops in Iraq and some 900 in Syria
as part of efforts to prevent a resurgence of the Islamic State
group.</p>
<p>The militant group once held significant territory in both countries
but were pushed back by local ground forces supported by international
air strikes in a bloody, multiyear conflict.</p>

<p>date: 2023-11-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Activists protesting corporate profits, environmental abuses, poor
working conditions and the Israel-Hamas war marched Sunday in downtown
San Francisco, united in their opposition to a global trade summit that
will draw President Joe Biden and leaders from nearly two dozen
countries.</p>
<p>Protests are expected throughout this week‚Äôs Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation leaders‚Äô conference, which could draw more than 20,000
attendees, including hundreds of international journalists. The No to
APEC coalition, made up of more than 100 grassroots groups, says trade
deals struck at summits such as APEC exploit workers and their
families.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs unlikely world leaders will even glimpse the protests given the
strict security zones accessible only to attendees at the Moscone Center
conference hall and other summit sites. But Suzanne Ali, an organizer
for the Palestinian Youth Movement, says the U.S. government needs to be
held to account for supplying weapons to Israel in its war against
Hamas.</p>
<p>‚ÄúEven if they cannot see us, as we‚Äôre mobilizing and marching
together, they will know that we‚Äôre out there,‚Äù she said.</p>
<p>San Francisco has a long tradition of loud and vigorous protests, as
do trade talks. In 1999, tens of thousands of protesters took to the
streets of Seattle during a World Trade Organization conference.
Protesters succeeded in delaying the start of the conference and
captured global attention as overwhelmed police fired tear gas and
plastic bullets and arrested hundreds of people.</p>
<p>Chile withdrew as APEC host in 2019 due to mass protests. Last year,
when Thailand hosted the summit in Bangkok, pro-democracy protesters
challenged the legitimacy of the Thai prime minister. Police fired at
the crowd with rubber bullets that injured several protesters and a
Reuters journalist.</p>
<p>Chief Bill Scott of the San Francisco Police Department said he
expects several protests a day, although it‚Äôs uncertain how many will
materialize. He warned against criminal behavior.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPeople are welcome to exercise their constitutional rights in San
Francisco, but we will not tolerate people committing acts of violence,
or property destruction or any other crime,‚Äù Scott said. ‚ÄúWe will make
arrests when necessary.‚Äù</p>
<p>APEC, a regional economic forum, was established in 1989 and has 21
member countries, including the world‚Äôs two largest economic superpowers
‚Äî China and the U.S ‚Äî as well as Mexico, Brazil and the Philippines. An
accompanying CEO summit is scheduled for this week, which critics also
plan to protest Wednesday.</p>
<p>Headlining the summit is a highly anticipated meeting between Biden
and Chinese President Xi Jinping, who rarely ‚Äî if at all ‚Äî encounters
protesters on home soil.</p>
<p>China has heavy security ahead of any events within its borders to
ensure no protests occur. It also steps up border checks at city limits
and at transit points such as railway stations and airports. Human
rights activists based in China will often receive visits or phone calls
from police ahead of important events as reminders to not
demonstrate.</p>
<p>Rory McVeigh, sociology professor and director of the Center for the
Study of Social Movements at the University of Notre Dame, said
politicians use protests to gauge public opinion and that media
attention helps.</p>
<p>‚ÄúProbably a lot of protests just don‚Äôt make much difference, but
occasionally they do, and occasionally they can make a huge difference,‚Äù
he said.</p>
<p>The United Vietnamese American Community of Northern California plans
to protest Xi and Vietnam President Vo Van Thuong. The International
Coalition for Human Rights in the Philippines will be rallying for the
rights of Indigenous Filipinos and protesting the presence of President
Bongbong Marcos, the son of dictator Ferdinand Marcos.</p>
<p>Protesters are disappointed that San Francisco, with its rich history
of standing up for the working class, would host CEOs of companies and
leaders of countries that they say do great harm.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs silly, from the mayor to the governor to the president, they
want to say this is a great idea to have all these people who have been
profiting off the intersecting crises of our time,‚Äù said Nik Evasco, a
climate activist. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just sickening.‚Äù</p>

Marvels‚Äô Melts Down at Box Office, Marking New Low for MCU</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Since 2008‚Äôs ‚ÄúIron Man,‚Äù the Marvel machine has been one of the most
unstoppable forces in box-office history. Now, though, that aura of
invincibility is showing signs of wear and tear. The superhero factory
hit a new low with the weekend launch of ‚ÄúThe Marvels,‚Äù which opened
with just $47 million, according to studio estimates Sunday.</p>
<p>The 33rd installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, a sequel to
the 2019 Brie Larson-led ‚ÄúCaptain Marvel,‚Äù managed less than a third of
the $153.4 million its predecessor launched with before ultimately
taking in $1.13 billion worldwide.</p>
<p>Sequels, especially in Marvel Land, aren‚Äôt supposed to fall off a
cliff. Yet ‚ÄúThe Marvels‚Äù debuted with more than $100 million less than
‚ÄúCaptain Marvel‚Äù opened with ‚Äî something no sequel before has ever done.
David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm Franchise Research
Entertainment, called it ‚Äúan unprecedented Marvel box-office
collapse.‚Äù</p>
<p>The previous low for a Walt Disney Co.-owned Marvel movie was
‚ÄúAnt-Man,‚Äù which bowed with $57.2 million in 2015. Otherwise, you have
to go outside the Disney MCU to find such a slow start for a Marvel
movie ‚Äî releases like Universal‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Incredible Hulk‚Äù with $55.4
million in 2008, Sony‚Äôs ‚ÄúMorbius‚Äù with $39 million in 2022 or 20th
Century Fox‚Äôs ‚ÄúFantastic Four‚Äù reboot with $25.6 million in 2015.</p>
<p>But ‚ÄúThe Marvels‚Äù was a $200 million-plus sequel to a billion-dollar
blockbuster. It was also an exceptional Marvel release in numerous ways.
The film, directed by Nia DaCosta, was the first MCU release directed by
a Black woman. It was also the rare Marvel movie led by three women ‚Äî
Larson, Teyonah Parris and Iman Vellani.</p>
<p>Reviews weren‚Äôt strong (62% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) and neither was
audience reaction. ‚ÄúThe Marvels‚Äù is only the third MCU release to
receive a ‚ÄúB‚Äù CinemaScore from moviegoers, following ‚ÄúEternals‚Äù and
‚ÄúAnt-Man and the Wasp: Quantamania.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Marvels,‚Äù which added $63.3 million in overseas ticket sales,
may go down as a turning point in the MCU. Over the years, the franchise
has collected $33 billion globally ‚Äî a point Disney noted in reporting
its grosses Sunday.</p>
<p>But with movie screens and streaming platforms increasingly crowded
with superhero films and series, some analysts have detected a new
fatigue setting in for audiences. Disney chief executive Bob Iger
himself has spoken about possible oversaturation for Marvel.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOver the last three and a half years, the growth of the genre has
stopped,‚Äù Gross wrote in a newsletter Sunday.</p>
<p>Either way, something is shifting for superheroes. The box-office
crown this year appears assured to go to ‚ÄúBarbie,‚Äù the year‚Äôs biggest
smash with more than $1.4 billion worldwide for Warner Bros.</p>
<p>Marvel has still produced recent hits. ‚ÄúGuardians of the Galaxy Vol.
3‚Äù launched this summer with $118 million before ultimately raking in
$845.6 million worldwide. Sony‚Äôs ‚ÄúSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse‚Äù
earned $690.5 million globally and, after rave reviews, is widely
expected to be an Oscar contender.</p>
<p>The actors strike also didn‚Äôt do ‚ÄúThe Marvels‚Äù any favors. The cast
of the film weren‚Äôt permitted to promote the film until the strike was
called off late Wednesday evening when SAG-AFTRA and the studios reached
agreement. Larson and company quickly jumped onto social media and made
surprise appearances in theaters. And Larson guested on ‚ÄúThe Tonight
Show‚Äù on Friday.</p>
<p>The normally orderly pattern of MCU releases has also been disrupted
by the strikes. After numerous strike-related delays, the only Marvel
movie currently on the studio‚Äôs 2024 calendar is ‚ÄúDeadpool 3,‚Äù opening
July 26.</p>
<p>Separately, after two weeks atop the box office, Universal Pictures‚Äô
‚ÄúFive Nights at Freddy‚Äôs‚Äù slid to second place with $9 million in its
third weekend of release. The Blumhouse-produced videogame adaptation
has accumulated $127.2 million domestically.</p>
<p>Taylor Swift‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Eras Tour‚Äù concert film came in third with $5.9
million from 2,484 venues in its fifth weekend of release. The film,
produced by Swift and distributed by AMC Theatres, has made $172.5
million domestically and $240.9 million worldwide.</p>
<p>Sofia Coppola‚Äôs ‚ÄúPriscilla‚Äù held strongly in its second weekend of
wide release. The A24 film, starring Cailee Spaeny as Priscilla Presley
and Jacob Elordi as Elvis, remained in fourth place with $4.8 million,
dipping only 5% from the week prior.</p>
<p>Martin Scorsese‚Äôs ‚ÄúKillers of the Flower Moon,‚Äù an Apple Studios
production being theatrically distributed by Paramount Pictures, took in
$4.7 million on its fourth weekend, to bring its domestic haul to about
$60 million. While quite low for a $200 million movie, ‚ÄúKillers of the
Flower Moon‚Äù is primarily an awards-season statement by Apple of its
growing moviemaking ambitions.</p>
<p>In its first weekend of expanded release, Alexander Payne‚Äôs acclaimed
‚ÄúThe Holdovers,‚Äù starring Paul Giamatti as a curmudgeonly
boarding-school instructor, launched with $3.2 million from 778
locations. The Focus Features release, an expected Oscar contender, will
hope for strong legs as it plays through the fall.</p>
<p>‚ÄúJourney to Bethlehem,‚Äù a release from Sony‚Äôs Christian subsidiary
Affirm Films, debuted with $2.4 million in about 2,000 locations.</p>
<p>Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian
theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released
Monday.</p>

id="if-reelected-biden-wants-to-complete-his-goals-on-civil-rights-taxes-social-services">If
Reelected, Biden Wants to Complete His Goals on Civil Rights, Taxes,
Social Services</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>President Joe Biden has a simple reelection pitch to voters ‚Äî let him
‚Äúfinish the job.‚Äù</p>
<p>So what does that mean? What‚Äôs left for him to get done?</p>
<p>Unlike Donald Trump, the front-runner for the 2024 Republican
presidential nomination who has been releasing videos and statements
detailing his agenda, Biden hasn‚Äôt formally released his plans as part
of his campaign.</p>
<p>But his ambitions are no secret, and his goals for child care,
community college and prescription drugs have been laid out in detail
during the Democrat‚Äôs first term. He also has unfulfilled promises on
civil rights, such as protecting access to the ballot box, preventing
police misconduct and restoring the nationwide right to abortion.
Banning firearms known as assault rifles remains a priority as well.</p>
<p>The result is a second-term agenda that could look a lot like Biden‚Äôs
first-term agenda, with some of the same political challenges. Almost
none of this can get done without cooperation from Congress, and many of
these goals already have been blocked or pared down because of
opposition on Capitol Hill.</p>
<p>Biden has achieved bipartisan victories on infrastructure projects
and public funding for the domestic computer chip industry. But
Democrats would need to win wide majorities in both the House and the
Senate to clear a path for the rest of his plans.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to finish as much of the job as we can in the next
year,‚Äù said Bruce Reed, Biden‚Äôs deputy chief of staff. ‚ÄúAnd finish the
rest after that.‚Äù</p>
<p>Taxes</p>
<p>Biden‚Äôs plans are expensive and he doesn‚Äôt want to increase the
deficit, so that means he‚Äôs looking to raise taxes on the wealthy.</p>
<p>He already has succeeded in implementing a 15% minimum tax on
companies with annual income exceeding $1 billion.</p>
<p>Biden has proposed raising the top tax rate to 39.6%, the corporate
tax rate to 28% and the stock buyback tax to 4%.</p>
<p>He wants a minimum tax of 25% on the wealthiest Americans, a levy
that would be applied not only to income but unrealized capital gains.
The idea, which Biden called the ‚Äúbillionaire minimum income tax,‚Äù could
prove difficult to put in place, not to mention extremely hard to push
through Congress, given Republican opposition to higher taxes.</p>
<p>Social services and health care</p>
<p>Biden‚Äôs original signature plan was known as Build Back Better, a
cornucopia of proposals that would have dramatically changed the role of
the federal government in Americans‚Äô lives.</p>
<p>It was pared down because of resistance from Sen.¬†Joe Manchin, a West
Virginia Democrat who is a key vote in the narrowly divided Senate and
announced this past week that he will not seek reelection. The result
was the Inflation Reduction Act, which included financial incentives for
clean energy and limits on prescription drug costs, but not many other
programs.</p>
<p>Biden will want to bring back the ideas that were left on the cutting
room floor. That includes making two years of community college tuition
free, offering universal preschool and limiting the cost of child care
to 7% of income for most families.</p>
<p>He also wants to resuscitate the expanded child tax credit. The
American Rescue Plan, the pandemic-era relief legislation, boosted the
credit to $3,000 for children over six and $3,600 for children younger
than age 6. The expansion lapsed after a year, returning the credit to
$2,000 per child, when his original package stalled.</p>
<p>More work is left on prescription drugs. The monthly cost of insulin
was capped at $35 for Medicare recipients. Biden wants the same limit
for all patients.</p>
<p>Gun violence</p>
<p>The White House recently announced a new office dedicated to
preventing gun violence. Biden also signed legislation that‚Äôs intended
to help officials keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers and
other dangerous people.</p>
<p>But Biden‚Äôs biggest goal, a ban on so-called assault weapons, remains
out of reach because of Republican opposition. Such a ban was in place
from 1994 to 2004, but it wasn‚Äôt extended after it expired. Although the
proposal hasn‚Äôt been spelled out in detail, it would likely affect
popular high-powered weapons such as the AR-15, which can shoot dozens
of bullets at a fast pace.</p>
<p>Another item on the wish list is universal background checks, which
increase scrutiny of sales conducted through gun shows or other
unlicensed avenues.</p>
<p>Civil rights</p>
<p>Biden took office at a time of national upheaval over the role of
racism in policing and the future of democracy. George Floyd, a Black
man in Minneapolis, was murdered by a white police officer, and Trump
tried to overturn Biden‚Äôs election victory, leading to the riot on
Jan.¬†6, 2021, at the U.S. Capitol.</p>
<p>Biden promised to address both of these issues through landmark
legislation, but he came up short of his goals.</p>
<p>On policing, bipartisan negotiations on Capitol Hill failed to reach
a deal, particularly when it came to making it easier to sue over
allegations of misconduct. So Biden instead crafted an executive order
with input from activists and police. The final version changes rules
for federal law enforcement, but it does little to alter how local
departments do their jobs.</p>
<p>He similarly issued an executive order on voting rights that aims to
expand registration efforts. But Democratic legislation intended to
solidify access to the ballot box failed to advance when some members of
the party refused to sidestep Senate filibuster rules to pass it.</p>
<p>Biden‚Äôs presidency was upended by the Supreme Court‚Äôs decision to
overturn Roe v. Wade, which guaranteed nationwide access to abortion.
It‚Äôs proved to be a potential campaign issue for Democrats, but they
have had less success in Congress. Biden said that if his party picks up
more seats, he will push for legislation codifying the right to
abortion.</p>
<p>Immigration</p>
<p>On Biden‚Äôs first day in office, he sent Congress his proposal for
overhauling the country‚Äôs immigration system. The idea went nowhere.</p>
<p>But the president would want to take another swing at the issue in a
second term. It will prove an especially urgent topic as migrants
continue crossing the U.S.-Mexico border and the country looks for the
next generation of workers to achieve its economic goals.</p>
<p>Biden wants to allow people who are in the United States illegally to
apply for legal status and eventually citizenship. He also wants a
smoother and expanded visa process, particularly for foreign graduates
of American universities. These steps would be paired with additional
resources for border enforcement.</p>
<p>Ukraine and Israel</p>
<p>Biden is facing two wars on two continents, and the fallout from each
conflict will shape a second term even if the fighting ends before
that.</p>
<p>The Russian invasion of Ukraine has been going on for almost two
years, and Israel and Hamas began their latest clash about a month ago.
Biden wants to send military support to Ukraine and Israel, something
that he describes as ‚Äúvital‚Äù to U.S. national security interests.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHistory has taught us when terrorists don‚Äôt pay a price for their
terror, when dictators don‚Äôt pay a price for their aggression, they
cause more chaos and death and more destruction,‚Äù he said in a recent
Oval Office address.</p>
<p>His plans will require challenging congressional negotiations. Some
Republicans are resisting more assistance for Ukraine after Congress has
already approved $113 billion in security, economic and humanitarian
resistance.</p>
<p>Both conflicts will likely require years of U.S. involvement. For
example, Biden is looking for a new opportunity to push for a two-state
solution in the Middle East, creating an independent Palestinian country
alongside Israel.</p>
<p>Climate</p>
<p>Fighting global warming is one of the areas where Biden has had the
most success. The Inflation Reduction Act includes nearly $375 billion
for climate change, much of it going toward financial incentives for
electric cars, clean energy and other initiatives. Biden is also pushing
stricter regulations on vehicles and power plants.</p>
<p>But the U.S. is not yet on track to meet Biden‚Äôs ambitious target for
reducing greenhouse gas emissions, according to independent analysts.
And there‚Äôs a lot of work ahead to ensure new programs reach their
potential.</p>
<p>One hurdle is red tape for energy projects. The White House argues
that it‚Äôs too hard to build infrastructure such as transmission lines,
but legislation to address the issue would likely require compromises
with Republicans, who see an opportunity to grease the skids for
additional fossil fuel development.</p>

US Military Personnel Killed in Mediterranean Air Refueling Training
Crash</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Five U.S. service personnel were killed Friday when their aircraft
crashed into the Mediterranean Sea during a routine air refueling
training mission, the U.S. Defense Department said Sunday.</p>
<p>The U.S. European Command gave no further details of the incident or
where it occurred but said the crash did not involve hostile fire. It
said the names of those killed would not be released until 24 hours
after their relatives had been notified.</p>
<p>The U.S. military has deployed two aircraft carriers, their
supporting ships and dozens of aircraft to the eastern Mediterranean
since Hamas militants‚Äô surprise October 7 attack on Israel, to act as a
deterrent to a spread of the conflict.</p>
<p>Nearby U.S. military aircraft and ships began an immediate search for
the wreckage, while authorities said they were opening an investigation
into the cause of the crash.</p>
<p>In a statement, U.S. President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden
paid tribute to the five who were killed, saying the ‚Äúdaily bravery and
selflessness‚Äù of the country‚Äôs service members ‚Äúis an enduring testament
to what is best in our nation. Jill and I are praying for the families
and friends who have lost a precious loved one ‚Äî a piece of their
soul.‚Äù</p>

Veterans Eye 80th Anniversary of D-Day as Europe Salutes War Dead</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>English soldier Ken Hay was trapped behind German lines and captured
while on night patrol in 1944, days after joining the Allied invasion of
Normandy, a turning point in World War Two.</p>
<p>The ambush near the bitterly contested ‚ÄúHill 112‚Äù came during weeks
of fighting after the largest seaborne assault in history, which began
the liberation of France from Nazi German occupation.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThirty of us went out, 16 including my brother got back, five of us
got captured and nine got killed,‚Äù Hay said.</p>
<p>As many nations around the world commemorate last century‚Äôs wars and
other conflicts during a weekend of remembrance, preparations are
already under way to mark next year‚Äôs 80th anniversary of the D-Day
landings and the Battle of Normandy.</p>
<p>Born in the English county of Essex, Hay took part in the early
reinforcements of Juno Beach, which had been stormed under Canadian
command on D-Day, June 6. He is now an active ambassador for the nearby
British Normandy Memorial, overlooking Gold Beach in the U.K.
sector.</p>
<p>Until two years ago, Britain was alone among allies on the Western
front in not having a dedicated Normandy memorial.</p>
<p>An elegant rectangular colonnade now sits on former farmland chosen
by veterans themselves at Ver-sur-Mer.</p>
<p>In total, 22,440 servicemen and two servicewomen of more than 30
nationalities who died under British command between June 6 and Aug.¬†31,
1944, are commemorated on 160 stone columns, as well as a ceremonial
wall for those who perished on D-Day itself.</p>
<p>The 30-million-pound ($37 million) memorial was financed by fines
levied on banks by the British government, as well as private
donations.</p>
<p>Hay, 98, is helping raise funds for an educational pavilion in time
for next year‚Äôs 80th anniversary, likely to be attended by Britain‚Äôs
King Charles III and French President Emmanuel Macron.</p>
<p>With the average age of a dwindling number of veterans also 98, it
will be the last major chance to gather some of those who helped their
fallen comrades push back the Western front.</p>
<p>Unusually, the memorial is laid out by date of death.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe fact that names are presented chronologically means you get an
understanding of how the battle unfolded: the days that are particularly
fierce,‚Äù said operations manager Sacha Marsac.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhen a whole unit is lost on the same day, their names are all next
to each other.‚Äù</p>
<p>Too young</p>
<p>Neatly carved rows of names, ranks and ages can only hint at the
personal stories. Four 16-year-olds presumably exaggerated their age to
serve before the age of 18. The majority barely knew their 20s. The
oldest: merchant seaman Thomas Hardwyre Milligan, 64.</p>
<p>Soldiers promoted unusually young, like a major of only 28, hint at
heavy losses as their superiors were killed.</p>
<p>One name is honored with a special insignia. Corporal Sidney Bates
posthumously received Britain‚Äôs Victoria Cross for ‚Äúsupreme gallantry‚Äù
after repeatedly charging a critical German position with a light
machine gun before dying of his wounds. He was 23.</p>
<p>A separate monument honors French civilians.</p>
<p>Veterans like Hay refuse to call themselves heroes, deferring to
those who fell in battle. Yet many suffered hardship, injury and
separation.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI joined at the age of 17 in 1943, but they wouldn‚Äôt call me [to
serve] until I was 17-and-a-half; they said I was too young to die,‚Äù Hay
said in a recent interview.</p>
<p>For six days after capture, he and fellow prisoners were hauled in a
cattle wagon to Stalag VIII-D prison camp, now in the Czech Republic.
Later he was sent to work in a Polish coal mine.</p>
<p>Then, in early 1945, began a three-month march westward as German
captors moved their prisoners ahead of the advancing Soviet army.</p>
<p>In a forest near Regensburg, Germany, guns approached from the West
and the German commanding officer accepted the war was over.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThat was April 20. From Jan.¬†23, we had done 1,000 miles,‚Äù Hay said.
‚ÄúI‚Äôve got a good pair of feet.‚Äù</p>

to Push China to Resume Military Ties With US, Official Says</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden wants to re-establish military-to-military
ties with China, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan
said on Sunday, days before the president and the Chinese leader are set
to meet.¬†</p>
<p>Biden will meet Chinese President Xi Jinping in person for the first
time in a year on Wednesday during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
summit in San Francisco. It will be only the second in-person meeting
between the two leaders since Biden took office in January 2021.¬†</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe president is determined to see the re-establishment of
military-to-military ties because he believes it‚Äôs in the U.S. national
security interest,‚Äù Sullivan said in an interview with CBS‚Äô ‚ÄúFace the
Nation.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe need those lines of communication so that there aren‚Äôt
mistakes or miscalculations or miscommunication.‚Äù¬†</p>
<p>Sullivan said restored military ties could take place at every level
from senior leadership to the tactical operational level, as well ‚Äúon
the water and in the air in the Indo-Pacific.‚Äù¬†</p>
<p>Sullivan said on CNN‚Äôs ‚ÄúState of the Union‚Äù that Biden would seek to
‚Äúadvance the ball‚Äù on military ties during his meeting with Xi, but
declined to provide further details.¬†</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Chinese have basically severed those communication links.
President Biden would like to re-establish that,‚Äù Sullivan said. ‚ÄúThis
is a top agenda item.‚Äù¬†</p>
<p>The Biden-Xi meeting is expected to cover global issues from the
Israel-Hamas war to Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine, North Korea‚Äôs ties
with Russia, Taiwan, the Indo-Pacific, human rights, fentanyl
production, artificial intelligence, as well as ‚Äúfair‚Äù trade and
economic relations, a senior U.S. official said.¬†</p>
<p>Relations between the two countries grew frosty after Biden ordered
the shooting down in February of a suspected Chinese spy balloon that
flew over the United States. But top Biden administration officials have
since visited Beijing and met with their counterparts to rebuild
communications and trust.</p>

<p>
By David Hegg Anyone who has ever written a research paper, especially
those who have gained a post-high school degree, has been instructed in
the relationship between meaning and context. The simple truth is the
beginning place of meaning in any written document is authorial
intention. This goes for spoken communication as well, especially
orations [‚Ä¶]

<p>The great thing about the private Facebook group is I have invited
friends from all stages of my life. People I knew in from high school,
New Orleans, Madison, Palo Alto, Cambridge and Berkeley, NYC and
Woodstock. Even people I knew as a child. People I only or mostly know
virtually. Imho, people who won‚Äôt use Facebook miss out. Its greatest
feature are the people who use it. It‚Äôs the kind of village we yearn
for, at a DNA level. People you will never stop loving. I don‚Äôt think
I‚Äôve ever mentioned this group on the blog, but maybe I should do that
more, because it‚Äôs a uniquely civilized, friendly and soul-nourishing

<p>Someday an author is going to construct a universe in a LLM and let
users interact with it. That sounds boring, but here‚Äôs the interesting
idea that led to it. Yesterday I asked
<a href="http://scripting.com/2023/11/11/013609.html">ChatGPT to
draw</a> me a image of an ancient band performing in the desert with
cacti as the audience. Then this morning I had the idea of moving the
concert into the pond behind my house, except this time
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/11/12/concertInThePond.png">the
audience are frogs</a>. I have a private Facebook group where I tell the
story of the pond, including the animals who come to visit. Some of them
I invent, they don‚Äôt actually exist. And they have relationships with
each other, at least in my mind. A natural thing to make part of this
private group would be the LLM of all the animals, and their stories and
relationships. And other people‚Äôs models could incorporate mine. This
was an idea I had for SimCity, and the
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+world+outline">web
of outlines</a>, neither of which happened. Maybe it‚Äôll happen in
LLM-land.</p>

Japan, South Korea to Share North Korea Missile Data</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Defense chiefs from South Korea, Japan and the United States have
agreed to start in December as planned a real-time data-sharing
operation on North Korean missiles, South Korea‚Äôs defense ministry said
Sunday.</p>
<p>U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met his South Korean counterpart
Shin Won-sik in Seoul Sunday with Japanese defense minister Minoru
Kihara joining the meeting online.</p>
<p>The ministers discussed strengthening their three-way cooperation in
the face of ‚Äúsevere security environments,‚Äù Kihara told reporters. It
was the first time the three ministers held such a gathering, he
said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe confirmed that we are steadily making adjustments, bringing the
process to the final stage,‚Äù Kihara added.</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden agreed with South Korean President Yoon Suk
Yeol and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida at an Aug.¬†18 summit
that, by the end of this year, the three countries would share North
Korea missile warning data in real time.</p>
<p>The ministers also condemned growing military cooperation between
North Korea and Russia as a violation of U.N. resolutions, the South
Korean defense ministry said in a statement, and also stressed the
importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.</p>
<p>Separately, General Charles Q. Brown, chairman of the U.S. Joint
Chiefs of Staff, held talks with his South Korean counterpart in Seoul
Sunday, the South Korean military said.</p>
<p>In his first visit to South Korea since he took office in October,
the top U.S. general discussed the ‚Äúcontinuous provocations‚Äù of North
Korea, including missile launches, and reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to
the defense of South Korea, the South Korean joint chiefs of staff said
in a statement.</p>

id="close-calls-between-planes-show-that-aviation-is-under-stress-us-official-says">Close
Calls Between Planes Show That Aviation Is Under Stress, US Official
Says</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The nation‚Äôs top accident investigator said Thursday that a surge in
close calls between planes at U.S. airports this year is a ‚Äúclear
warning sign‚Äù that the aviation system is under stress.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhile these events are incredibly rare, our safety system is showing
clear signs of strain that we cannot ignore,‚Äù Jennifer Homendy, chair of
the National Transportation Safety Board, told a Senate panel on
Thursday.</p>
<p>Homendy warned that air traffic and staffing shortages have surged
since the pandemic. She said there has been a ‚Äúlack of meaningful‚Äù
training ‚Äî and more reliance on computer-based instruction ‚Äî by the
Federal Aviation Administration and airlines, and too many irregular
work schedules among pilots and air traffic controllers.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhere you end up with that is distraction, fatigue,‚Äù she told the
aviation subcommittee. ‚ÄúYou are missing things, you are forgetting
things.‚Äù</p>
<p>The NTSB is investigating six close calls, or what aviation insiders
call ‚Äúrunway incursions.‚Äù The FAA identified 23 of the most serious
types of close calls in the last fiscal year, which ended Oct.¬†1, up
from 16 the year before and 11 a decade ago. Independent estimates
suggest those figures grossly understate such incidents.</p>
<p>Thursday‚Äôs hearing included only a momentary discussion of pilot
mental health, which is on travelers‚Äô minds because of the arrest of an
off-duty pilot accused of trying to disable a plane in midflight and a
co-pilot who allegedly threatened to shoot the captain. Critics have
pointed out that federal screening relies on pilots to disclose whether
they are taking medication or being treated for mental illness including
depression.</p>
<p>The FAA said separately that it will appoint a committee of medical
experts and aviation and union leaders to make recommendations ‚Äúon
breaking down the barriers that prevent pilots from reporting mental
health issues to the agency.‚Äù</p>
<p>The Senate hearing produced no new ideas for increasing safety but
brought a new warning about the potential for travel disruptions over
the upcoming holidays because the FAA doesn‚Äôt have enough air traffic
controllers.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are not healthier than we were last year, controller-wise,‚Äù said
Rich Santa, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers
Association. ‚ÄúI think FAA‚Äôs own numbers indicate we have potentially six
more air traffic controllers than we had last year.‚Äù</p>
<p>The union president said many controllers are forced to work 10-hour
days or six-day weeks.</p>
<p>The Transportation Department‚Äôs inspector general criticized the FAA
in a report this summer, saying the agency has made only ‚Äúlimited
efforts‚Äù to fix a shortage at staffing at critical air traffic control
centers.</p>
<p>Among the close calls in recent months, the scariest occurred in
February in Austin, Texas. During poor visibility in the early morning
hours, a FedEx cargo plane preparing to land flew over the top of a
Southwest Airlines jet that was taking off. The NTSB has estimated that
they came within about 30 meters of colliding.</p>
<p>An air traffic controller had cleared both planes to use the same
runway. In other recent incidents, pilots appeared to be at fault by
failing to follow orders from controllers.</p>

<h2 id="worlds-population-has-passed-8-billion-us-census-says">World‚Äôs
Population Has Passed 8 Billion, US Census Says</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The human species has topped 8 billion, with longer lifespans
offsetting fewer births, but world population growth continues a
long-term trend of slowing down, the U.S. Census Bureau said
Thursday.</p>
<p>The bureau estimates the global population exceeded the threshold
Sept.¬†26, a precise date the agency said to take with a grain of
salt.</p>
<p>The United Nations estimated the number was passed 10 months earlier,
having declared Nov.¬†22, 2022, the ‚ÄúDay of 8 Billion,‚Äù the Census Bureau
pointed out in a statement.</p>
<p>The discrepancy is due to countries counting people differently ‚Äî or
not at all. Many lack systems to record births and deaths. Some of the
most populous countries, such as India and Nigeria, haven‚Äôt conducted
censuses in over a decade, according to the bureau.</p>
<p>While world population growth remains brisk, growing from 6 billion
to 8 billion since the turn of the millennium, the rate has slowed since
doubling between 1960 and 2000.</p>
<p>People living to older ages account for much of the recent increase.
The global median age, now 32, has been rising in a trend expected to
continue toward 39 in 2060.</p>
<p>Countries such as Canada have been aging with declining older-age
mortality, while countries such as Nigeria have seen dramatic declines
in deaths of children under 5.</p>
<p>Fertility rates, or the rate of births per woman of childbearing age,
are meanwhile declining, falling below replacement level in much of the
world and contributing to a more than 50-year trend, on average, of
slimmer increases in population growth.</p>
<p>The minimum number of such births necessary to replace both the
father and mother for neutral world population is 2.1, demographers say.
Almost three-quarters of people now live in countries with fertility
rates around or below that level.</p>
<p>Countries with fertility rates around replacement level include
India, Tunisia and Argentina.</p>
<p>About 15% of people live in places with fertility rates below
replacement level. Countries with low fertility rates include Brazil,
Mexico, the U.S. and Sweden, while those with very low fertility rates
include China, South Korea and Spain.</p>
<p>Israel, Ethiopia and Papua New Guinea rank among countries with
higher-than-replacement fertility rates of up to 5. Such countries have
