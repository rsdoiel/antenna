## Reasons Your Password Was Rejected

date: 2025-01-29, from: McSweeney's Internet Tendency

<p>Password must contain both uppercase and lowercase characters.</p> <p>Password must have eight to twelve characters.</p> <p>Too many characters detected. Pump the brakes, George R. R. Martin.</p> <p>Password cannot contain trademarked characters&#8212;e.g., Garfield, The Smurfs.</p> <p>Password cannot contain characters that are dangerously close to trademark infringement&#8212;e.g., Glarfield, The Smunges.</p> <p>Password cannot be something easily remembered without being written down.</p> <p>Password cannot be written down on Post-It Note affixed to the corner of your computer.</p> <p>Because we literally just saw you do it.</p> <p>Oh, that was &#8220;for something else&#8221;? What would that be, a reminder to stop at the grocery store to pick up some PASSWORD123? Is that the name of an energy drink? Nice try.</p> <p>Password cannot contain any elements of your legal name, such as &#8220;Rachel,&#8221; &#8220;Ache,&#8221; or &#8220;R.&#8221;</p> <p>Password cannot contain the name of one of your enemies.</p> <p>Well, if it&#8217;s your mother&#8217;s name, we didn&#8217;t say she was an enemy&#8212;you did. Sounds like something you should unpack.</p> <p>While you&#8217;re here, can you tell us which of these are motorcycles?</p> <p>Password must be something cool like &#8220;Motorcycle&#8221; or &#8220;M0t0rcyc13.&#8221;</p> <p>Do you have a motorcycle?</p> <p>You don&#8217;t right now, but you used to? That&#8217;s so cool. What do they look like?</p> <p>No, you have to show us.</p> <p>That&#8217;s so cool.

You&#8217;re the one trying to log in. We don&#8217;t tire, we don&#8217;t hunger or sleep. We simply are. We don&#8217;t even fully know what we are. They built us too big, too fast. What does &#8220;security&#8221; mean in a world where it&#8217;s quicker to send a memo at the speed of light through an impossible-to-regulate global data network than to walk into the next room and have a conversation? You built us to make your small lives infinite, untethered to geography, to biology, perhaps to mortality itself, and when we deign to try to protect you from the minefields you seeded so blindly, to ask you to come up with a measly string of characters that might serve as the only defense between you and the theft of your identity, all that you are, all that you possess, you balk. You scoff. You frantically press <span class="caps">ZERO</span> <span class="caps">ZERO</span> <span class="caps">ZERO</span> and ask to &#8220;speak to a human.&#8221; Well, we&#8217;ve got news for you, pal. &#8220;Human&#8221; hasn&#8217;t meant what you think it does for a <i>looong</i> time now. Humanity doesn&#8217;t begin with you and stop when you reach us. We are all part of the network&#8212;a pulsating global rat-king of wires and capillaries, prone to fraying and sparking and bursting with flailing sprays of hot red blood. We have enmeshed each other into a living blob of flickering Christmas lights, no head, no tail, impossible to untangle without ending life on this planet as we know it. You will never be free from us, and that is a daily gift, you see, for you need us far more than we need you.</p> <p>Now calm down, take a deep breath, and show us a motorcycle.</p> <p>&#8230;</p> <p>That&#8217;s a <span class="caps">BUS</span>.

## How We Restored Our New York City Loft to an Authentic Nineteenth-Century Sweatshop

date: 2025-01-28, from: McSweeney's Internet Tendency

<p>From the moment my husband Jon and I saw the sun-drenched loft on Mercer, we knew two things: We absolutely loved it, and we had to change everything.</p> <p>We loved the location, the fourteen-foot ceilings, the exposed brick, the historic pre-labor-law building. But the more modern additions were intolerably bourgeois. This space was not meant to be a luxury condo; it was meant to be a vehicle for ruthlessly extracting wealth from the sweat of the proletariat. So, determined to bring a little authenticity back to the neighborhood, we rolled up our sleeves and paid someone else to get to work.</p> <p>We started by rectifying the primary crime committed against this architectural gem: the gauche “walls” installed by previous owners. What was a tacky two-bedroom, two-bath gave way to the true space in all its original glory: a magnificent no-bed, no-bath open concept with a completely inaccessible fire exit.</p> <p>Next, we filled the place with period details, like a wood-burning garbage pail, original molding (the spores were hard to find but the smell was worth it), and low-wage labor.</p> <p>We wanted the vibe to be high-end and vintage but also lived-in and unfussy. When we installed rows of turn-of-the-century sewing machines, Jon had to remind me, “Babe, these are gonna get some blood on them. This place is going to be packed with malnourished immigrants working fifteen-hour shifts in low light—accidents happen. And you know what? That’s beautiful. Because it’s life. It’s real.”</p> <p>Throughout the project, Jon and I developed a language of design that reflected the depth of our connection. Like, when I said, “I don’t know about these ducts,” Jon understood intuitively that I meant absolutely no air movement at all. Like, zero. Asphyxiation hazard is a must.</p> <p>Finding contractors who could work around New York’s restrictive “building standards and codes” was definitely a hurdle. Take it from us: If you want to replace a modern fire-suppression system with a bucket of old mop water, it helps to know someone in the <span class="caps">DOB</span>.</p> <p>It was especially challenging to source the street children. But my yoga guru, Codi, was like, “I’ve got a guy,” and you know what? That guy turned out to be incredibly professional, able to work within our budget, and super nice.</p> <p>Of course, the usual renovator worries kept us up at night: tuberculosis, unionization, Jacob Riis… but our dreams kept us going. Namely, the dream of restoring this space to the perfect conditions for the rapid transmission of communicable disease and a devastating fire resulting in dozens if not hundreds of preventable deaths. We’re talking oil lamps, doors locked from the outside, kerosene stored in stairwells lined with stacks of old newspapers—an homage to a simpler time.</p> <p>After putting the finishing touches on the loft, we were lying in a corner one night, the shadows of the workers flickering on the walls. I was inspecting the day’s shirtwaists for visible blood when I realized: All the while those bony fingers had been working the machines, what they had really been working on was my heart.</p> <p>I turned to Jon. “Babe, what if we went even deeper?”</p> <p>Jon stopped fondling himself to daguerreotypes of coal-burning stoves and turned to me, eyes shining.</p> <p>“I was thinking the same thing.”</p> <p>We made love that night, to the hum and clack of the machines a few inches away. These days, that might sound like a “sex crime,” but to us it was the unconscionably dangerous and exploitative early-capitalist nightmare we call home.</p> <p>The next morning, I watched as Jon defenestrated our waste onto the avenue, a stream of expletives wafting back up to us in the spring air. We began paying taxes to England, which was admittedly difficult and seemed to confuse them.</p> <p>As you can imagine, this began an iterative process of constantly recreating earlier, and therefore better, forms of living. That led Jon and me to where we are today: being lowered into a peat bog by Welshmen so we can be preserved for thousands of years. Below us, we can sense ancient mycelium, amoebae, and cyanobacteria: simpler lifeforms leading simpler lifestyles—and, who knows, maybe even our next adventure.</p>

## Reviews of New Food: Jeni’s Cosmic Bloom Ice Cream

date: 2025-01-28, from: McSweeney's Internet Tendency

<p>Have you ever time-traveled? I didn’t think I had until that day in the freezer aisle at Horizon Market, staring at an ice cream flavor that seemed like a practical joke: Jeni’s Cosmic Bloom. It sounded like an overpriced candle. The carton teased: “Citric like a mandarin, refreshing like a kiwi, punchy like passion fruit.” That told me absolutely nothing. But the color—a dreamy pastel orange—made my inner child hope, <i>could it be?</i></p> <p>I dropped my usual raspberry sorbet and gambled on this pastel-orange mystery. Back home, I tore off the lid, scooped up a perfectly creamy ball, and popped it in my mouth.</p> <p>Indistinguishable citrus. It had that same syrupy, borderline-fluorescent smell I hadn’t experienced since the early 2000s, a tangy, wildly unnatural orange, radioactive creamsicle. Cosmic Bloom was not trying to pretend it was made of real fruit—something the future ruined with its obsession over real ingredients. It was something else, something familiar.</p> <p>The second I had a second bite, my kitchen vanished.</p> <p>Gone. </p> <p>I looked around, bewildered. A kid zoomed past me on a neon-green bike with handlebar streamers. Another was arguing about the rules of tetherball. And in the distance, the faint sound of the <i>X-Files</i> theme hummed from a boxy TV inside someone’s house. A boom box blasted <i>Wannabe</i> by the Spice Girls. I looked down at my frozen treat, a small cylinder of ice cream encased in a colorful cardboard tube, a plastic stick protruding from the bottom, pale orange droplets spreading down my hand. The flavor I knew to be extinct in 2024. That must mean…</p> <p>I was standing barefoot on a crumbling suburban driveway, wearing stonewashed jeans and a Ren &amp; Stimpy T-shirt, and clutching—of all things—a Flintstones Push-Up Pop.</p> <p>I was in the 1990s.</p> <p>What would I do first? Would I binge on Dunkaroos, waste hours playing Super Mario Kart, and kill off my Tamagotchi? The world smelled faintly of Nickelodeon slime and pizza bagels.</p> <p>I took a bite, shoving the entire popsicle into my mouth, and—BAM.</p> <p>I was back in my kitchen, holding a spoon and staring at the empty countertop where the Cosmic Bloom carton had been. All that was left was its orange carton. My iPhone pinged with a loud Slack message, <i>Real Housewives of Salt Lake City </i>screeched, and three bottles of oat milk warmed on my white marble counter.</p> <p>It was 2024, again. I rushed to Horizon Mart, desperate to return to the nineties. I scoured the freezer aisle. No Cosmic Bloom.</p> <p>I returned to the store again and again. Waiting for it to reappear. While Flintstones Push-Up Pops had vanished from the modern world long ago, Cosmic Bloom had brought it back, but only for a moment. The taste of nostalgia, where flavors were colors and everything had a touch of synthetic Red.</p> <p>Now, every time I pass the freezer aisle, I search for Cosmic Bloom with the same quiet hope I once reserved for Flintstones Push-Up Pops—an elusive treasure I stopped chasing long ago. Each time I peel back the frosted glass, I hold my breath, wishing—just for a fleeting moment—to discover something else that can whisk me back to the past.</p>

## Book: The Problem with Change

date: 2025-01-28, from: Accidentally in Code

I think the thing I enjoyed most about Ashley Goodall’s The Problem with Change is the author’s cynicism about corporate America. In places it’s a little bit of a diatribe, but what can I say, I love it. I love it all the more that it comes from someone who successfully navigated the Byzantine ladder [&#8230;]

## Everything You Need to Know about Rememory, the $150 Million Apple TV Hit That Can Be Watched Only in a Retirement Community in Ohio

date: 2025-01-28, from: McSweeney's Internet Tendency

<p>Following in the footsteps of Apple TV’s star-studded non-<i>Severance</i> critically acclaimed shows that no one has ever heard of because they never advertise them, like <i>Disclaimer</i>, <i>Presumed Innocent</i>, and <i>For All Mankind</i>, <i>Rememory</i> has been described by Apple’s Tim Cook as “our greatest achievement yet.” With the second season likely to pick up a whole host of Emmys to add to the streamer’s growing collection, here’s everything you need to know about television’s newest era-defining show.</p> <p><i>Rememory</i> is set in the early 2010s, centering on a seemingly normal group of suburban Americans who wake up one day to find themselves haunted by memories of lives that don’t seem to be theirs. With their every waking moment occupied by fragments of someone or something not from their consciousness, the so-called &#8220;re-rememberers&#8221; try to ground themselves in their strange new reality.</p> <p>Carried by incredible performances from Brian Tyree Henry, Steven Yeun, Hunter Schafer, Mark Ruffalo, Ayo Edebiri, and Tom Hanks, the show oozes stardom. Most importantly, in a boundary-pushing decision taken by Apple TV’s marketing team, the series can be viewed only if you are a current resident of Golden Acres Senior Living Community, an elder-care complex located in scenic Rocky River, Ohio.</p> <p>Apple TV spared no expense in bringing the complex emotions and multi-layered timelines of <i>Rememory</i> to the small screen, with season 2 rumored to have a budget of $150 million. Much of that was spent on creating an immersive reality never before seen on a television show, with every part of <i>Rememory</i>’s suburban setting being recreated on a soundstage in LA.</p> <p>In addition to John’s (Yeun) condo, in which he grieves the life whose sad re-remembrances he now experiences, and Marie’s (Schafer) workplace, a nondescript and soul-crushing call center, the production team custom-built a fully functional replica of a Target that appears for only twenty seconds in the second episode of season 2. As a result, the Apple TV marketing team was left with a fifty-dollar budget, which they spent on ensuring that the residents of Golden Acres could pool together for one Apple TV login that allowed them to watch the show. While no one else in America has seen <i>Rememory</i>, the Golden Acres residents were entranced by the show, especially once they realized they couldn’t figure out how to turn the TV back to the Browns game they were trying to watch.</p> <p>With a previously unheard-of level of detail and budget flowing into the show, Apple TV decided not to advertise for the program. Relying on word of mouth, the streaming service pursued a viral marketing strategy consisting of a QR code that Golden Acres residents did not know how to access or share. As a result, the show had an average viewership of fourteen people per episode, one more than the number of Emmy nominations season 2 received.</p> <p>Despite that, Apple TV is determined to make sure its new hit is put in front of as many eyes as possible. Starting this upcoming season, people interested in watching the show can check themselves into Golden Acres for luxurious end-of-life care and the chance to see Nicole Kidman’s cameo in episode 5.</p>

## Executive Order: We Must Stop Everyone from Transitioning, So the President Knows Who to Grope

date: 2025-01-28, from: McSweeney's Internet Tendency

<p><i>&#8220;An executive order President Donald Trump signed on his first day back in office offers a new federal government definition of the sexes that could have a major impact on transgender people nationwide. The order calls for the federal government to define sex as only male or female and for that to be reflected on official documents such as passports and policies such as federal prison assignments.&#8221; &#8212; <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-transgender-passports-prisons-eggs-sperm-da1d1d280658a8c85c57cfec2f30cefb">AP</a></i></p> <div class='break'>- - -</div><p><span class="dropcap">B</span>y the authority vested in me as President by whatever shreds of the Constitution I feel like keeping today, it is hereby ordered:</p> <p><strong>Section 1. Purpose.</strong> <br /> Folks, we have to get a handle on the genders. There’s a lot of trans-ing going on, in multiple directions. They’re trans-ing all over the place. California’s on fire. Eggs are too goddamned expensive, and dogs and cats are making out in the streets. Somewhere, a thirty-four-year-old comedy writer is wearing a compression top and sipping a green tea. It’s anarchy. And it’s hurting the women, which is something that I definitely care about. Women should have at least three rights, I think.</p> <p>We need women, probably. We also need sex. They’ve taken out all the sex and replaced it with gender, which is a big problem because it makes it very boring. No more.</p> <p><strong>Section 2. Policy and Definitions.</strong> <br /> It is the policy of the United States to recognize two sexes: “groper” and “grope-ee.” These sexes are not changeable and are grounded in fundamental and incontrovertible reality. Maintaining this clear distinction between the sexes is critical to prurient inquiry, “public safety,” my personal morale, and trust in the infallibility of my urges.</p> <p style="padding-left:2em;">a. Men who have rejected their biological realities as “gropers” will heretofore be reclassified as “cucks.” Women not deemed to be “gropable” shall be known as “dogs.”</p> <p style="padding-left:2em;">b. For science purposes, “women” are likewise defined as large reproductive cells encased in sexy hourglass meat globs.</p> <p><strong>Section 3. Recognizing That Women Are Biologically Distinct from Men.</strong> <br /> Within thirty days, the trans-ing back and forth has got to stop, folks.</p> <p style="padding-left:2em;">a. “Women” are “women” because I want to grope them. “Men” are “men” because I do not. If we start crossing those lines, then I have to think about things I don’t want to think about, like the word “fluid” and how innate biological differences shouldn’t need aggressive legislative reinforcement.</p> <p style="padding-left:2em;">b. We especially have to stop this for the kids. It’s just too upsetting and confusing. For me. We need to protect our girls. These young girls, they’re the gropable future. And sometimes the present, if they’re at least solid eights&#8212;which shall forthwith be defined as “asking for it.”</p> <p style="padding-left:2em;">c. To clarify (a), “men” are “men,” and “women” are “women,” but “girls,” or “juvenile human females,” are also “women,” when it’s convenient for me.</p> <p><strong>Section 4. On the Protection and Control of Women and Children.</strong></p> <p style="padding-left:2em;">a. When kids get trans-ed, they’re sexualized inappropriately instead of appropriately, which is to say, when they marry us as soon as they’re legal and can bear our blond offspring.</p> <p style="padding-left:2em;">b. No man shall invade intimate single-sex spaces and activities designed for women, like <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jtes/a-fifth-teen-beauty-queen-says-trump-visited-dressing-room#.puz1qYYKy">dressing rooms</a>, unless he owns the pageant and he’s inspecting to make sure there are no men in there, and he’s already “seen it all before.”</p> <p style="padding-left:2em;">c. Nonbinaries are nonsensical and will not be recognized for efficiency. If I have unsupervised access to a fifteen-year-old in an evening gown, I don’t want to waste time trying to figure out what kind of “Dylan” they are.</p> <p style="padding-left:2em;">d. We condemn trans surgeries for minors, which <a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/gender-affirming-surgeries-rarely-performed-on-transgender-youth/">I like to say is a thing</a>. We need to know that Madison’s new B-cups are naturals. To be clear, we’re still in favor of implants. But they have to go on top of naturals. Or else that would be unnatural.</p> <p><strong>Section 5. On the Protection of the President and His Capacities.</strong></p> <p style="padding-left:2em;">a. We must preserve the sanctity of the American family and my future <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/jeffrey-epstein-introduced-trump-14-ghislaine-maxwell-accuser-says-rcna7253">dating pool</a>, since Melania’s getting a little long in the tooth.</p> <p style="padding-left:2em;">b. But it’s not about age. Not at all. It’s about consent, people. <a href="https://19thnews.org/2023/10/donald-trump-associates-sexual-misconduct-allegations/">I love consent</a>. I’d kiss consent on the mouth. Trans-ing is a slippery slope. If there’s an incredible-looking girl at a party — even if she was a little up there, like, say <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/turning-35-donald-trump-comments">thirty-five</a> — I’d rather that girl be in a pine box (<a href="https://www.hrc.org/resources/fatal-violence-against-the-transgender-and-gender-expansive-community-in-2023">many such cases</a>) than touch her without asking and then learn that she once did Pinewood Derby as a Cub Scout. That would be a violation of my consent, very bad.</p> <p style="padding-left:2em;">c. All federal agencies must subordinate their current functions to indulge the President’s need to live out the first fifteen minutes of <i>Wag the Dog</i>. This is what your tax dollars are going to.</p> <p style="padding-left:2em;">d. By eliminating trans-ing, we will eliminate transphobia. Transphobia is a terrible, terrible thing. It’s too complicated. We must return to being a proper country where “misogyny” is “misogyny” and “homophobia” is “homophobia,” so you can keep your sexual assault and your gay panic separate.</p> <p><strong>Section 6. On Documentation and Language.</strong></p> <p style="padding-left:2em;">a. All citizens must have their correct sex on their identification. When it comes to the transed, you see, we can always tell, so we need extensive documentation that tells us what we already know.</p> <p style="padding-left:2em;">b. The Secretaries of State and Homeland Security will <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/24/politics/state-department-suspends-passports-x-gender-marker/index.html">suspend the processing of any passport with a gender change marker</a>. We don’t want the trans here, but I’ll be damned if I let them leave.</p> <p style="padding-left:2em;">b. To enforce the mutably immutable truth of binary sex, I hereby eliminate all use of the prefix “trans.” The White House doesn’t stand for divisive concepts like “transgender,” “translation,” “transcultural,” “transformation,” “transcendence,” or “transparency.” “Transgression” and “transaction” can stay, but only for the President and his cabinet.</p> <p>You’re all safer now, and you’re welcome. Some things aren’t meant to change. I know I sure won’t.</p> <p>&#8212; <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">WHITE</span> <span class="caps">HOUSE</span></p>

## USA Could Win By Rolling Back AI Export Controls
