<h2 id="at-last-browser-choice">At last, browser choice*</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-29, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
The
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24050478/apple-ios-17-4-browser-engines-eu">EU
Digital Markets Act is making waves in the Apple ecosystem</a>. For the
first time ever you’ll be able to install a browser other than
Safari/Webkit on iOS (as long as you live in the EU). While there are
other browsers on the iOS App Store, they’re all Safari/Webkit under the
hood due to non-competitive App Store submission guidelines.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://open-web-advocacy.org/">Open Web Advocacy</a> group
have spent years documenting the issues at hand. I haven’t participated
much there, but I’ve built countless web apps and have felt most (if not
all) the pain points that come with supporting Safari users and, as a
Mobile Safari user, not having access to features I’ve built. That
feature gap has closed considerably in the last couple years and the
Safari/Webkit team’s movement is impressive, their relative openness on
issues is welcome, and
<a href="https://webkit.org/standards-positions/">declaring standards
positions</a> reduces risk and removes mystery. But this (potentially)
blows the doors open on competition.
</p>
<p>
It will be interesting to see what happens from here. Will we break out
of the Chromium/Webkit duopoly? Or will we fall headlong into a Chromium
monopoly? Regardless, the EU ruling is a win for the Open Web because
now users have options beyond the OS-provided default browser. Before
there was nothing beyond a thin veneer of choice.
</p>
<p>
At the time of writing, there are
<a href="https://cloudfour.com/thinks/this-web-page-is-best-viewed-in-the-eu/">some
questions on how to test this</a> if you don’t live in the EU and it’s
not yet known if (or ever) the rest of the world might also get access
to other browsers. And there seems to be some malicious compliance
afoot… but hopefully over time the situation normalizes towards the
ideal outcome; an unfettered web.
</p>
<p>
Next, if the EU could fix the GDPR banners that are killing the web,
that would be wonderful.

<h2 id="us-arms-exports-hit-record-high-in-fiscal-2023">US Arms Exports
Hit Record High in Fiscal 2023</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Sales of U.S. military equipment to foreign governments
in 2023 rose 16% to a record $238 billion, the U.S. State Department
said on Monday, as countries sought to replenish stocks sent to Ukraine
and prepare for major conflicts.  </p>
<p>The figures underpin expectations of stronger sales for the likes of
Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics and Northrop Grumman, whose shares are
forecast to rise amid growing global instability. </p>
<p>Arms sales and transfers are viewed as “important U.S. foreign policy
tools with potential long-term implications for regional and global
security,” the State Department said in a statement. </p>
<p>Sales approved in the year included $10 billion worth of High
Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) to Poland, $2.9 billion worth
of AIM-120C-8 Advanced Medium-Range Air-To-Air Missiles (AMRAAM) to
Germany, and National Advanced Surface to Air Missile Systems (NASAMS)
to Ukraine. </p>
<p>Lockheed makes the HIMARS, and RTX, formerly Raytheon, makes AMRAAM.
RTX and Norway’s Kongsberg produce NASAMS. </p>
<p>Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics expect existing orders for
hundreds of thousands of artillery rounds, hundreds of Patriot missile
interceptors, and a surge in orders for armored vehicles will underpin
their results in coming quarters. </p>
<p>There are two major ways foreign governments purchase arms from U.S.
companies: direct commercial sales negotiated with a company, or foreign
military sales in which a government typically contacts a Defense
Department official at the U.S. embassy in its capital. Both require
U.S. government approval. </p>
<p>The direct military sales by U.S. companies rose to $157.5 billion in
fiscal 2023 from $153.6 billion in fiscal 2022, while sales arranged
through the U.S. government rose to $80.9 billion in 2023 from $51.9
billion the prior year.</p>

id="judge-orders-oregon-newspaper-not-to-publish-documents-linked-to-nike-lawsuit">Judge
Orders Oregon Newspaper Not to Publish Documents Linked to Nike
Lawsuit</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PORTLAND, Ore. — A federal judge has ordered an Oregon newspaper not
to publish documents that it obtained regarding a sex discrimination
lawsuit against sports behemoth Nike.</p>
<p>The Oregonian/OregonLive reported that an attorney who represents
plaintiffs in the case sent the documents to one of its reporters on
January 19 and then asked for them back. When the news outlet declined,
the attorney filed a court motion requesting they be returned.</p>
<p>U.S. Magistrate Judge Jolie Russo approved the motion on Friday and
ordered the news outlet to return the documents.</p>
<p>“The Court is aware that certain documents marked ‘Confidential’ and
‘Attorneys’ Eyes Only’ have been inadvertently disclosed by plaintiff’s
counsel to the Oregonian via e-mail,” Russo wrote, ordering the outlet
to return the records and “agree not to disseminate that information in
any way; and to destroy any copies in its possession.”</p>
<p>Russo said the documents fall under the case’s protective order,
which withholds some content from public view.</p>
<p>The Oregonian/OregonLive said it planned to appeal.</p>
<p>“Prior restraint by government goes against every principle of the
free press in this country,” said Editor and Vice President of Content
Therese Bottomly. “This is highly unusual, and we will defend our First
Amendment rights in court.”</p>
<p>Neither the attorney nor Nike immediately responded to requests for
comment from The Associated Press.</p>
<p>The sex discrimination suit, filed in 2018, alleges Nike’s workplace
is hostile toward women and that the Oregon-based company underpays
female employees.</p>

Pulitzer Prize Winner and Giant of Native American Literature, Dead at
89</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — N. Scott Momaday, a Pulitzer Prize-winning storyteller,
poet, educator and folklorist whose debut novel “House Made of Dawn” is
widely credited as the starting point for contemporary Native American
literature, has died. He was 89.</p>
<p>Momaday died Wednesday at his home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, publisher
HarperCollins announced. He had been in failing health.</p>
<p>“Scott was an extraordinary person and an extraordinary poet and
writer. He was a singular voice in American literature, and it was an
honor and a privilege to work with him,” Momaday’s editor, Jennifer
Civiletto, said in a statement. “His Kiowa heritage was deeply
meaningful to him and he devoted much of his life to celebrating and
preserving Native American culture, especially the oral tradition.”</p>
<p>“House Made of Dawn,” published in 1968, tells of a World War II
soldier who returns home and struggles to fit back in, a story as old as
war itself: In this case, home is a Native community in rural New
Mexico. Much of the book was based on Momaday’s childhood in Jemez
Pueblo, New Mexico, and on his conflicts between the ways of his
ancestors and the risks and possibilities of the outside world.</p>
<p>“I grew up in both worlds and straddle those worlds even now,”
Momaday said in a 2019 PBS documentary. “It has made for confusion and a
richness in my life.”</p>
<p>Despite such works as John Joseph Mathews’ 1934 release “Sundown,”
novels by American Indians weren’t widely recognized at the time of
“House Made of Dawn.” A New York Times reviewer, Marshall Sprague, even
contended in an otherwise favorable review that “American Indians do not
write novels and poetry as a rule, or teach English in top-ranking
universities, either. But we cannot be patronizing. N. Scott Momaday’s
book is superb in its own right.”</p>
<p>Like Joseph Heller’s “Catch-22,” Momaday’s novel was a World War II
story that resonated with a generation protesting the Vietnam War. In
1969, Momaday became the first Native American to win the fiction
Pulitzer, and his novel helped launch a generation of authors, including
Leslie Marmon Silko, James Welch and Louise Erdrich.</p>
<p>His other admirers would range from the poet Joy Harjo, the country’s
first Native to be named poet laureate, to the film stars Robert Redford
and Jeff Bridges.</p>
<p>“He was a kind of literary father for a lot of us,” Harjo told The
Associated Press during a telephone interview Monday. “He showed how
potent and powerful language and words were in shaping our very
existence.”</p>
<p>Over the following decades, he taught at Stanford, Princeton and
Columbia universities, among other top-ranking schools, was a
commentator for NPR, and lectured worldwide.</p>
<p>He published more than a dozen books, from “Angle of Geese and Other
Poems” to the novels “The Way to Rainy Mountain” and “The Ancient
Child,” and became a leading advocate for the beauty and vitality of
traditional Native life.</p>
<p>Addressing a gathering of American Indian scholars in 1970, Momaday
said, “Our very existence consists in our imagination of ourselves.” He
championed Natives’ reverence for nature, writing that “the American
Indian has a unique investment in the American landscape.” He shared
stories told to him by his parents and grandparents. He regarded oral
culture as the wellspring of language and storytelling, and dated
American culture back not to the early English settlers, but also to
ancient times, noting the procession of gods depicted in the rock art at
Utah’s Barrier Canyon.</p>
<p>“We do not know what they mean, but we know we are involved in their
meaning,” he wrote in the essay “The Native Voice in American
Literature.”</p>
<p>“They persist through time in the imagination, and we cannot doubt
that they are invested with the very essence of language, the language
of story and myth and primal song. They are 2,000 years old, more or
less, and they remark as closely as anything can the origin of American
literature.”</p>
<p>In 2007, President George W. Bush presented Momaday with a National
Medal of Arts “for his writings and his work that celebrate and preserve
Native American art and oral tradition.” Besides his Pulitzer, his
honors included an Academy of American Poets prize and, in 2019, the
Dayton Literary Peace Prize.</p>
<p>Momaday was married three times, most recently to Barbara Glenn, who
died in 2008. He had four daughters, one of whom, Cael, died in
2017.</p>
<p>He was born Navarre Scott Mammedaty, in Lawton, Oklahoma, and was a
member of the Kiowa Nation. His mother was a writer, and his father an
artist who once told his son, “I have never known an Indian child who
couldn’t draw,” a talent Momaday demonstrably shared. His artwork, from
charcoal sketches to oil paintings, were included in his books and
exhibited in museums in Arizona, New Mexico and North Dakota. Audio
guides to tours of the Smithsonian Institution’s Museum of the American
Indian featured Momaday’s avuncular baritone.</p>
<p>After spending his teens in New Mexico, he studied political science
at the University of Mexico and received a master’s and Ph.D. in English
from Stanford. Momaday began as a poet, his favorite art form, and the
publication of “House Made of Dawn” was an unintentional result of his
early reputation. Editor Fran McCullough, of what is now HarperCollins,
had met Momaday at Stanford and several years later contacted him and
asked whether he would like to submit a book of poems.</p>
<p>Momaday did not have enough for a book, and instead gave her the
first chapter of “House Made of Dawn.”</p>
<p>Much of his writing was set in the American West and Southwest,
whether tributes to bears — the animals he most identified with — or a
cycle of poems about the life of Billy the Kid, a childhood obsession.
He saw writing as a way of bridging the present with the ancient past
and summed up his quest in the poem “If I Could Ascend”: </p>
<p>Something like a leaf lies here within me; / it wavers almost not at
all, / and there is no light to see it by / that it withers upon a black
field. / If it could ascend the thousand years into my mouth, / I would
make a word of it at last, / and I would speak it into the silence of
the sun.</p>
<p>In 2019, he was the subject of a PBS “American Masters” documentary
in which he discussed his belief he was a reincarnation of a bear
connected to the Native American origin story around Devils Tower in
Wyoming. He told The Associated Press in a rare interview that the
documentary allowed him to reflect on his life, saying he was humbled
that writers continued to say his work has influenced them.</p>
<p>“I’m greatly appreciative of that, but it comes a little bit of a
surprise every time I hear it,” Momaday said. “I think I have been an
influence. It’s not something I take a lot of credit for.”</p>

Defense Secretary Returns to Work at Pentagon After Cancer Surgery</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin returned to work at the
Pentagon on Monday after nearly a month’s absence because of prostate
cancer and met with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg.</p>
<p>“At this important time, I’m glad to be back at the Pentagon,” said
Austin, speaking at the start of the meeting. “I feel good and am
recovering well, but still recovering, and I appreciate all the good
wishes that I have received thus far.”</p>
<p>After that session, Austin went to the White House Situation Room for
a meeting of the national security team to discuss the drone attack at a
base in Jordan that killed three U.S. troops and wounded several dozen
others.</p>
<p>He was last in the Pentagon on December 21. He had been diagnosed
with prostate cancer earlier in December, and he went to a hospital for
a surgical procedure for the cancer on December 22. He worked the
following week from home.</p>
<p>On January 1, he was taken by ambulance to Walter Reed National
Military Medical Center after experiencing extreme pain and was admitted
to the intensive care unit. He stayed there for two weeks but didn’t
inform the White House or his deputy that he had cancer, had surgery or
had been taken back to the hospital and put in intensive care until days
later. He told President Joe Biden and other key leaders about his
diagnosis only after he’d been in the hospital more than a week.</p>
<p>Austin’s lack of disclosure has prompted changes in federal
guidelines and has triggered an internal Pentagon review and an
inspector general review into his department’s notification procedures.
Both reviews are ongoing.</p>
<p>Austin has been working from home since he got out of the hospital on
January 15, and he made his first public appearance early last week
during a virtual Ukraine contact defense group meeting. He gave opening
remarks for the meeting via video camera that was streamed online.</p>
<p>Doctors at Walter Reed said on Friday that Austin’s prostate cancer
prognosis is excellent and no further treatments will be needed. He saw
doctors for a checkup on Friday.</p>
<p>Austin has been criticized for keeping secret his prostate cancer
diagnosis, surgery and subsequent hospitalization with complications
from the procedure.</p>
<p>He was diagnosed in early December and had what the Pentagon
described as a “minimally invasive surgical procedure,” called a
prostatectomy, to treat the cancer on December 22. He was under general
anesthesia during this procedure and had transferred some authorities to
his deputy defense secretary, Kathleen Hicks. He was discharged the next
day and continued to perform his duties.</p>

Decries Interrogations, Deportations of Students at US Entry Points</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Beijing — The Chinese government has protested to the United States
over the treatment of Chinese arriving to study in America, saying some
have been interrogated for hours, had their electronic devices checked
and in some cases were forcibly deported from the country.</p>
<p>Xie Feng, the Chinese ambassador in Washington, said dozens of
Chinese have been denied entry every month for the past few months when
returning to school from overseas travel or visiting relatives in China,
according to a post on the Chinese Embassy website.</p>
<p>“When they landed at the airport, what awaited them was an
eight-hour-long interrogation by officers who prohibited them from
contacting their parents, made groundless accusations against them and
even forcibly repatriated them and banned their entry,” he said Sunday
at an event at the embassy on student exchanges. “This is absolutely
unacceptable.”</p>
<p>The protest comes as the U.S. and China try to boost student and
other exchanges to shore up their relations, which have turned
confrontational in recent years over trade, technology, human rights
and, more fundamentally, the future direction of the world.</p>
<p>Nearly 290,000 Chinese students are in the U.S., about one-third of
the foreign students in the country, according to the embassy post.
China has more than 1.3 million students studying abroad, more than any
other country, it said.</p>
<p>In a separate online statement, the Chinese Embassy said it had made
“solemn representations” to the U.S. government about the treatment of
students arriving at Dulles airport in Washington, D.C. The statement
reminded Chinese students to be cautious when entering through the
airport.</p>
<p>It wasn’t clear whether Xie’s comments referenced cases only at
Dulles or at other entry points as well.</p>
<p>The U.S. Embassy in Beijing did not immediately respond to a request
for comment.</p>
<p>The Chinese Embassy statement said the affected students had their
electronic devices checked, were prohibited from communicating with
anyone outside and, in some cases, held for more than 10 hours. It said
the actions of border control officers “have had a serious impact on the
studies of international students from China and caused great
psychological harm.”</p>
<p>The statement also said that the actions ran counter to the agreement
between Presidents Joe Biden and Xi Jinping at their meeting last
November to promote people-to-people exchanges.</p>

When the White House announced on Friday that it would temporarily pause
the approval of new liquified natural gas export terminals, it wasn’t
just a
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/biden-lng-exports-pause-young-voters-climate" target="_self">victory

like the primaries are already over.

Trump wasted no time vowing to “approve the export terminals on my very
first day back” in a campaign speech in Nevada, which his campaign made
official in an

<p>
LNG was hardly a preordained battleground; though there’d been
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/10/17/natural-gas-exports-climate-activists/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">some
jostling in the fall</a> between activists and Republicans, Americans
more generally are
<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2022/05/12/a-majority-of-americans-favor-expanding-natural-gas-production-to-export-to-europe/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fuzzy
on the specifics</a> of how the U.S. meets its energy needs and divided
on how to address them.
</p>
<p>
Still, the Biden campaign clearly picked its spot. For one thing, the
administration’s LNG pause is a literal challenge to the existing
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2018/06/f52/Macroeconomic%20LNG%20Export%20Study%202018.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">methodology</a>
for assessing LNG projects, developed under the Trump administration
back in 2018. The timing of the announcement further marks it as an
opening salvo to young climate-conscious voters whose faith in the
president suffered a
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/biden-s-climate-betrayal" target="_self">bruising</a>
when he approved a ConocoPhillips oil exploration effort known as the
<a href="https://www.conocophillips.com/operations/alaska/willow-project/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Willow
Project</a> last spring. There could be some strategy here on the part
of the campaign, as well — by baiting Trump into taking up LNG as a
low-hanging talking point, it gets to amplify and contrast Biden’s
climate agenda repeatedly in response.
</p>
<p>
But it’s a risky gambit. Attacks on LNG
<a href="https://thebreakthrough.org/issues/energy/howarth-natural-gas" target="_blank">might
not be as simple</a> as they look at first glance — that is, after all,
what the Energy Department’s review is all about, although it also
likely kicks the decision to, conveniently, after Election Day.
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/inflation-reduction-act-popularity-repeal" target="_self">Heatmap
polling</a> also shows Americans aren’t very familiar with Biden’s
landmark climate legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act, even as
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/27/climate/biden-climate-campaign.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">experts
believe</a> “climate voters could make or break Joe Biden in 2024.” I
fear Americans’ eyes will glaze over at yet another three-letter acronym
— not that “<em>liquified natural gas export terminals</em>” is exactly
any better. At the very least, other polling appears to indicate a
public that is
<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2023/06/28/what-americans-think-about-an-energy-transition-from-fossil-fuels-to-renewables/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">confused
and conflicted</a> about fossil fuels, see-sawing between a desire for
energy security and anxiety over climate priorities.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, Trump can add LNG to his
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-fact-check-climate-change-wind-solar-electric-vehicles-energy" target="_self">laundry
list of dubious attacks</a> on the energy transition and the “Green New
Scam.”
</p>
<p>
Of course, none of these risks is a reason for the Biden administration
not to get to the bottom of LNG’s environmental impacts. The U.S. is,
after all, now the largest
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=60361" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">LNG
exporter</a> in the world. But the timing of the Biden administration’s
announcement, just as the Republican race took a decisive and seemingly
inevitable
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-new-hampshire-primary-two-candidate-race-72a59c4133879eaeec63d6ed30e91e01" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">turn
in Trump’s favor</a>, means that one way or another, we’ll be hearing a
lot more about LNG in the long, long months to come.

id="ex-irs-contractor-sentenced-to-5-years-for-leaking-trump-tax-records">Ex-IRS
Contractor Sentenced to 5 Years for Leaking Trump Tax Records</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — A former contractor for the U.S. Internal Revenue
Service was sentenced by a judge on Monday to five years in prison on
Monday for leaking the tax records of former President Donald Trump and
thousands of other wealthy Americans to media organizations.</p>
<p>Charles Littlejohn, 38, in October had pleaded guilty to a charge of
disclosing income tax return information without authorization.  </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes decided on his sentence.  </p>
<p>Federal prosecutors had sought a five-year sentence, the maximum
allowed under U.S. law, arguing that Littlejohn was motivated by a
political agenda and compromised the security of sensitive personal
information. Littlejohn, according to prosecutors, sought a position at
a consulting firm that works with the IRS in 2017 in hopes of accessing
and disclosing records on Trump, who was president at the time.</p>
<p>Littlejohn’s lawyers said he was motivated by a “deep, moral belief”
that the public had a right to know the information he shared, but now
regrets his actions. Littlejohn’s legal team did not request a specific
sentence, but sought a punishment comparable to prior government
leakers.  </p>
<p>Littlejohn secretly downloaded years of Trump’s tax records in 2018,
later sharing them with reporters from the New York Times, according to
court documents. The newspaper published a series of articles in 2020
revealing that Trump paid no income tax in 10 of the 15 years before he
was elected president.</p>
<p>Trump became the first major U.S. presidential candidate in decades
not to release his tax returns when he ran for the White House in 2016.
A U.S. House of Representatives panel released six years of his tax
records in 2022 after a court battle.</p>
<p>Littlejohn later leaked tax information on “ultra-high net worth
taxpayers” to the investigative news outlet ProPublica. He was motivated
by concerns about economic inequality and wanted to spur reforms to the
U.S. tax system, his defense team wrote in court documents.  </p>
<p>ProPublica published nearly 50 articles based on the information,
revealing how the wealthy evade income taxes in the United States.</p>
<p>The nearly 6,000 pages of records released by the House panel in 2022
included more than 2,700 pages of personal returns from Trump and his
wife Melania Trump, plus more than 3,000 pages of returns from his
businesses. They showed that Trump’s income and tax liability fluctuated
dramatically from 2015 through 2020 and that he and his wife claimed
large deductions and losses, and paid little or no income tax in several
of those years.</p>

Offers Reward for Escaped Sudan Official Wanted on Darfur</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The United States on Monday offered a reward of up to $5
million for the arrest of a former Sudanese official sought over alleged
Darfur war crimes who escaped from prison when war erupted last
year.</p>
<p>Ahmed Harun, a former top aide to deposed dictator Omar al-Bashir, is
wanted by the International Criminal Court for helping form the
notorious Janjaweed militia which carried out a scorched-earth campaign
in Darfur in the 2000s.</p>
<p>Harun announced in April that he and other former regime officials
escaped Khartoum’s Kober prison days after fighting broke out between
Sudan’s army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces.</p>
<p>The United States pointed out that the Janjaweed has evolved into the
Rapid Support Forces, which is accused of ethnic-based attacks against
the non-Arab population in western Sudan.</p>
<p>“Lasting peace in Sudan requires justice for victims and
accountability for those responsible for human rights abuses and
violations, both past and present,” State Departments spokesman Matthew
Miller said.</p>
<p>“There is a clear and direct connection between impunity for abuses
under the Bashir regime, including those of which Harun is accused, and
the violence in Darfur today,” he said.</p>
<p>Secretary of State Antony Blinken has accused the Rapid Support
Forces of crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing in the latest
bloodshed.</p>
<p>The United States has worked with Saudi Arabia to broker between the
dueling generals but to little avail.</p>
<p>The war has killed at least 13,000 people, according to a
conservative estimate by the Conflict Location and Event Data project,
and displaced more than seven million people, according to the U.N.</p>
<p>The International Criminal Court has sought Harun since 2007 over 20
counts of crimes against humanity and 22 counts of war crimes. In 2009,
Bashir became the first sitting head of state indicted by the
Hague-based court, but Sudan has not handed him over.</p>
<p>The reward by the United States – which itself is not party to the
court – is offered for information that leads to Harun’s arrest,
transfer or conviction.</p>

<p>
Hi Dave Rupert LLC,
</p>
<p>
I liked your latest blog post
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2023/08/quick-thoughts-on-chips/">Quick
toughts on chips</a> and see you are a business leader in accessibility,
Doritos®, and Jekyll blogging software. I thought we should connect. I
would like to inform you of an exciting opportunity.
</p>
<p>
I scraped or stole your email address from some list that you never
signed up for, but would you like help growing your company’s sales? I
can do the same impersonal, unsolicited, scumbag sales shit I’m doing to
you right now but on behalf of your company.
</p>
<p>
I generated this with AI, so it took me literally no time or effort but
I sent it anyways. The federal crime I just committed is utterly
offensive and every time I send this to you under a different fake
business name you instantly delete it, but some might also call it
“innovative”. I can provide this service for your company. Reach new
customers today by deploying large scale AI-driven spam operations.
</p>
<p>
I clearly have no ethics, but you should enter a business relationship
with me, a guy who found your email on the internet.
</p>
<p>
You are now signed up for a no-opt-out email drip campaign to send you
automated replies every day for the next week to get you to reply. Reply
and start a conversation with your harasser if you’d like it to stop.
</p>
<p>
Also, would you like to have my boss on your podcast? He’s a B2B Growth
Saas Fortune Trope 500 Under 500 Startups Entreprenuer and has a red
Porsche. There’s almost no trace of this guy on the internet but you
should absolutely have him on your super niche web development podcast.
I think he’d be a great fit for your audience.
</p>
<p>
What do you say? Are you ready to increase the size of your revenue?
</p>
<p>
Thanks,<br /> Helen

2023 was yet another pivotal year for EVs as the segment began to expand
beyond early adopters and into the early majority. What should come as
no surprise to most people is that American automaker Tesla dominated
Google Trends search data for EVs last year. Still, gas and hybrid
specialist <a href="https://electrek.co/guides/toyota/">Toyota</a>
remained the most searched auto brand, not by any specific state.

<h2 id="us-schools-not-immune-from-rise-in-hate-crimes">US Schools Not
Immune From Rise in Hate Crimes</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Schools in the United States are not being spared from a
dramatic rise in hate crimes that has swept across the country.</p>
<p>A new report released Monday from the Federal Bureau of Investigation
finds that 10% of all hate crimes in the U.S. in 2022 took place at
schools, making them the country’s third most common location for hate
crimes.</p>
<p>Only homes (27%) and highways, roads or alleys (16%) saw more hate
crime offenses.</p>
<p>The report found that the number of reported hate crimes at schools —
from preschool through university — has risen steadily since 2020, when
officials recorded 500 hate crimes at school. In 2021, the number of
school-based offenses rose to 896 before hitting a high of more than
1,300 in 2022.</p>
<p>Those increases track with what FBI officials have described as a
worrisome rise in hate crimes overall, with the latest data showing a
record 11,643 incidents in 2022, surpassing the previous record of
almost 11,000 incidents in 2021.</p>
<p>Monday’s report is the first of its kind issued by the FBI, and
officials say it is not clear yet whether they will issue additional
reports on school-based hate crimes in the future.</p>
<p>“The goal is to draw attention to the data and to the occurrences of
hate crimes at schools giving possibly others the opportunity to
respond,” an FBI official told reporters Monday, briefing on the
condition of anonymity under ground rules established by the bureau.</p>
<p>“[This is] not a situation here where the bureau is looking to take
immediate action on this,” the official added. “But by providing the
information, we think that it enables our law enforcement partners to do
so.”</p>
<p>The report, which looked at data from the five-year period covering
2018 to 2022, found the most common hate crime offense was intimidation,
followed by vandalism and assault.</p>
<p>The most common hate crimes were anti-Black crimes (12.6%), followed
by anti-Jewish crimes (5.6%) and anti-Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual or
Transgender crimes (2.6%).</p>
<p>Anti-Muslim hate crimes were 0.5% of the total.</p>
<p>The FBI report also found that hate crimes in schools were more
frequent in October, November and December, with nearly a third of
school-based hate crimes taking place during those months.</p>
<p>Overall, the report said that more than 30% of children who were
victims of hate crimes over the five-year period were victimized at
school. Almost 36% of juvenile hate crime offenders committed the crimes
in school.</p>
<p>Almost two-thirds of the reported hate crimes took place in
preschools, elementary schools and high schools, according to the FBI
data.</p>

<h1>
Berlin School
</h1>
<p>
I’m listening to
<a href="https://yt.cdaut.de/watch?v=BE8rMsM3zLs">Berlin Schoool: An
Uncomplicated Approach</a> by Synth Seeker because
<a class="account" href="https://social.sdf.org/@phf" title="@phf@social.sdf.org"><span
class="citation" data-cites="phf">@phf</span></a> recommended it.
</p>
<p>
We were talking about music. All I do is create small jingles for my
podcast but every now and then I wonder about music theory. A while ago
I had saved <a href="https://yewtu.be/watch?v=rgaTLrZGlk0">Learn music
theory in half an hour</a> by Andrew Huang to get back to it. But all I
had done about it was think to myself: Pick a scale, like this one, B
Major looks nice, OK, so full full half full full full half, that’s
these keys, OK, let me doodle around on these … beep beep boop boop …
here we go. Or maybe do the other one, full full full half full full
half … biep biep boup boup … all right! 🥳
</p>
<p>
But then I wonder: what would my next step be? Some days I look at the
circle of fifth and wonder if that’s hogwash. Non-European music doesn’t
need it! But then again, they also use <em>something</em>. There are
rules because people figured out what generally “works”. Well, on the
other hand there are books about many things and they are neither a
replacement for spending ten thousand hours practising and the rules
they espouse are often just there to get you started and then they are
immediately broken.
</p>
<p>
All I know when I look at a typical drum machine or tracker setup with
<sup>8</sup>⁄<sub>8</sub> or similar I immediately want to do a
<a href="https://babayagamusic.com/Music/nine-eight-rhythms.htm"><sup>9</sup>⁄<sub>8</sub>
Karsilama</a> or something like that. My wife’s oriental dancing and all
the Turkish, Arab, Iranian and Maghreb music we listened to must have
left an impression… Or confused the hell out of me, depending on your
perspective. Or mine.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, writing all of this and I’m still not making music. What next, I
wonder. Perhaps playing C Major and playing a bunch of notes it shares
with another scale and then continuing with that scale is cool. Or maybe
not. I don’t know. Or just stay in that scale and do some drum machine
and patterns below that!
</p>
<p>
That Synth Seeker video had a link to a
<a href="https://www.hooktheory.com/cheat-sheet">Key Cheat Sheet
Index</a>. The effect is similar to picking scales in Garage Band or
Animoog: limiting the keys I use in order to stay in that scale. Works
for me!
</p>
<p>
All this listening and writing makes me realize that it’s Sunday, late
at night, I should go to bed, and then I’ll be working and playing
role-playing games and war-games every evening until the next week-end
comes around. Whaaat!
</p>
<p>
I must find time between the things I do to do the other things.
</p>
<p>
This is my life.

We had already been friends for a few years then. By total coincidence
we were both offered writing gigs at the then-new
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_(magazine)#History">Wired</a>,
Dave as the Fetish columnist, where he wrote about all the latest tech
gadgetry, which was a perfect assignment for him, because Dave is one of
the most tech-literate people you’ll ever meet. Also an avid bike rider,
Deadhead, and later a receiver of donated kidneys, and a pioneer of the
technology for matching kidney donors with recipients. He has saved a
lot of lives with his software. And he’s still with us, against all
odds.
</p>
<p>
Just chatted with him last night during the

game</a>. The only football team I’ve ever loved, from back in the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Montana">Joe Montana</a>
days.
</p>
<p>
I was offered a column to basically write whatever I wanted to write
about, although by default I was supposed to write about the world wide
web, which was then as new as ChatGPT is today and every bit as
exciting. You can find our respective columns somewhere I hope on the
web.

<h1>
VASL Templates
</h1>
<p>
I’m trying to get <a href="https://vasl-templates.org/">VASL
Templates</a> to run on my laptop so that I can create nice setups for
Advanced Squad Leader. As it turns out, I have to use <code>pipx</code>
because that automatically creates virtual environments for me, as far
as I understand.
</p>
<pre><code>cd src
git clone https://code.pacman-ghost.com/public/vasl-templates.git
cd vasl-templates
pipx install .
</code></pre>
<p>
As it turns out, this is not enough:
</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;/home/alex/.local/bin/vasl-templates&quot;, line 5, in &lt;module&gt;
    from vasl_templates.main import main
  File &quot;/home/alex/.local/pipx/venvs/vasl-templates/lib/python3.11/site-packages/vasl_templates/main.py&quot;, line 19, in &lt;module&gt;
    import PyQt5.QtWebEngineWidgets
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'PyQt5'
</code></pre>
<p>
So now you need to install PyQt5 into the virtual environment used by
vasl-templates:
</p>
<pre><code>pipx inject vasl-templates PyQt5
</code></pre>
<p>
Next error:
</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;/home/alex/.local/bin/vasl-templates&quot;, line 5, in &lt;module&gt;
    from vasl_templates.main import main
  File &quot;/home/alex/.local/pipx/venvs/vasl-templates/lib/python3.11/site-packages/vasl_templates/main.py&quot;, line 19, in &lt;module&gt;
    import PyQt5.QtWebEngineWidgets
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'PyQt5.QtWebEngineWidgets'
</code></pre>
<p>
Fix:
</p>
<pre><code>pipx inject vasl-templates PyQtWebEngine
</code></pre>
<p>
And now it works at last! 😅

<p>date: 2024-01-29, from: Miek Giebin blog</p>
<p>this project needs a name and a domain. After many years of playing
with YAML in k8s, I’ve returned to using CFEngine (at work). The last
config management software before that was Puppet. An issue I see with
all modern config management tooling is the lack of monitoring and the
impossibility to cleanly roll back. In k8s it works better, but that’s
only for pods running in k8s (which are stateless), not the underlying
machines.</p>

</li>
<li>
Polestar’s Q4 results won’t be released until the <strong>end of
February</strong>, but the Volvo-owned brand “cut about 15% of its
global workforce [last week] in response to what it described as
‘challenging market conditions’ and lower volume expectations in 2025,”

<strong>Last week</strong>, Tesla projected “notably slower” growth for
the year ahead. The company “is clearly trying to figure out what to do
next,”

<li>EU climate chief warns against ‘false narrative’ that climate action
and business interests are at odds
</h3>
<p>
The European Union’s climate commissioner, Wopke Hoekstra, said that the
energy transition will mean a “heavy change” for industries on the
continent but warned against the “false narrative” that climate action
comes at the cost of business and innovation, <em>The Financial
Times</em>
<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a5c5b266-788a-4f2f-a5b2-5e27e54e3855" target="_blank">reported</a>
Monday. Hoekstra’s comments came ahead of an intended proposal by
Brussels that the EU cut emissions by 90% of 1990 levels by 2040.
</p>
<p>
While the aggressive proposition would need to be agreed upon by EU
governments before becoming law, environmental regulations have already
rankled farmers in Germany, Poland, Romania, Belgium, and France — where
<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/france-farmers-protests-fuel-tax-cut-red-tape" target="_blank">farmers</a>
even threatened to put Paris
“<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/french-farmers-aim-put-paris-siege-tractor-protest-106746513" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">under
siege</a>” on Monday — while right-wing politicians have attacked green
policies and industrialists have blamed “red tape” for holding up
innovation. “We need to stand on two legs: one leg is climate action,
the other leg is the just transition, competitiveness, and a thriving
business community, because both are needed,” Hoekstra said.

<li>Chicago faces uphill battle to ban gas from new construction
</h3>
<p>
Last week, Chicago Mayor Mayor Brandon introduced an ordinance that
would ban natural gas for cooking and heating in most new construction.
“This is a critical first step for [Chicago] to take towards a planned
transition away from fossil fuels,” Leslie Perkins, the chief of staff
and policy director for the city’s Committee on Environmental Protection
and Energy,
<a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/chicago-mayor-natural-gas-ban-new-buildings-electrification-decarbonization-emissions/705736/#:~:text=Chicago%20Mayor%20Brandon%20Johnson%20introduced,Johnson%20in%20supporting%20the%20legislation." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a>
<em>Utility Drive</em> at the time. However, the ordinance faces an
uphill battle, <em>The Chicago Tribune</em> argued in
<a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/opinion/editorials/ct-editorial-natural-gas-brandon-johnson-stoves-utilities-20240128-bkb4u53l3vcbbg6ae5z2fusoqm-story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a
Sunday editorial</a>. “Better to wait and see what the statewide policy
is on the future of natural gas,” the authors wrote, stressing examples
like Berkeley, California, which has been unable to enforce its version
of a gas ban after a federal appeals court ruled the city doesn’t have
the authority. Additionally, “much of the power keeping lights on in
Chicagoland comes from nuclear energy (which doesn’t emit carbon) and,
ironically enough, gas (which does),” the op-ed authors pointed out.
“It’s not economically feasible to build new nuclear plants at present,
so any increased electricity demand will be met mostly by burning gas.”

<p>date: 2024-01-29, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
Consumer spending ticked up in December, and more people are swiping
their credit cards. Part of the reason folks are more comfortable
putting it on plastic is confidence in the overall job market. But
delinquency rates have been climbing too. We’ll hear what economists
make of these trends. Also: United Airlines in talks with Airbus and
ripple effects of liquidation orders for property giant Evergrande.

<p class="drop-caps">
Does everything actually suck right now? Or is it just the end of
January?
</p>
<p>
It can be difficult to tell. We’re officially in the thick of what
Americans consider to be the
<a href="https://today.yougov.com/society/articles/45312-americans-favorite-and-least-favorite-months-year" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">worst
time of year</a>, when complaining about the weather is an acceptable
salutation and feeling “blah” is the basic condition of being alive.
Even setting aside seasonal affective disorder — a condition linked to
<a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/seasonal-affective-disorder#:~:text=Seasonal%20affective%20disorder%2C%20or%20SAD,antidepressants%20can%20help%20treat%20SAD." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">limited
daylight</a>, and thus not
<a href="https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-environment-watch/michigan-winters-are-super-cloudy-and-getting-worse-heres-how-deal" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">directly
affected</a> by climate change —
<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/17456916231178695" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">studies
have shown</a> that people have a lower quality diet in the winter, and
body weight usually reaches its peak this time of year. Physical
activity, which is also important for mental health, dips as the weather
gets worse, and research has even shown that people with Alzheimer’s
disease experience more severe symptoms when the planet is tilted away
from the sun.
</p>
<p>
Some have taken these winter blues as an opportunity to question the
basic premise that climate change is bad. “The chief benefits of global
warming” include “fewer winter deaths” and lower heating bills, Matt
Ridley
<a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/why-climate-change-is-good-for-the-world/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">argued</a>
in <em>The Spectator </em>in 2013. Former President Donald Trump even
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/01/its-cold-so-trump-is-doubting-climate-change/580885/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has
a quasi-annual tradition</a> of tweeting something like <em>“Wouldn’t be
bad to have a little of that good old fashioned Global Warming right
now!” </em>during cold snaps this time of year.
</p>
<p>
Winter is, in fact, warming
<a href="https://heatmap.news/what-is-winter-anymore" target="_self">faster
than any other season</a> in the United States, with some parts of the
country on track to lose over a month of freezing days as soon as 2050.
Even if you do believe — correctly — that climate change is a global
catastrophe, unless you’re
<a href="https://heatmap.news/lifestyle/ski-snowboard-season-snow-climate-change" target="_self">a
skier or snowboarder</a>, this might sound like a good thing. So, as
sacrilegious as it feels to ask, <em>could</em> a warmer planet make us
healthier in the wintertime?
</p>
<p>
When I asked Leslie Davenport, a climate psychology educator at the
California Institute of Integral Studies, if she expected milder winters
to impact people psychologically, she answered immediately. “Oh, one
hundred percent!,” she told me. That doesn’t mean she thinks the impact
will be positive. She said she has heard people “who are a little more
on the climate denial end of things” make comments like “this is great,
it used to be so cold and now I can go golfing,” she told me, but “I
can’t honestly call that an upside.”
</p>
<p>
Far more often, Davenport said she hears from people experiencing a
sense of “unsettling” as they notice winter isn’t as cold or as snowy as
they remember it being. Some might even express a feeling of
“solastalgia,” a neologism that describes the sense of displacement or
nostalgia that arises when a place changes environmentally. “Whether
it’s the loss of snow, or areas that are drier or hotter or wetter, it
is like, ‘Well, this is not the town I grew up in or the place I chose
to move to because it has changed so much,’” Davenport said.
</p>
<p>
While there might be an abstract appeal to the Los Angelesification of
winter nationwide, it would be a mistake to count on climate change
making the season “better.” Quite the opposite, actually — warmer
winters could make winter much <em>worse</em>, especially for those
living in midlatitude cities like New York, London, or Amsterdam. “I
have observed, in my travels and my research and in talking to people,
that it is often much easier and more pleasant to cope with winter
weather that is slightly below freezing consistently than weather that
is slightly above freezing consistently,” Kari Leibowitz, a health
psychologist who is working on a book about
<a href="https://www.karileibowitz.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">winter
mindsets</a>, told me.
</p>
<p>
Cold temperatures can actually improve our lives in several ways,
Leibowitz argued. For one thing, snowfall “opens up a whole bunch of
winter opportunities” like sledding, snowmobiling, snowshoeing, and all
those winter sports that get people out of the house. That helps combat
some of the bluesiness that otherwise comes from moping around indoors
when it’s too gray and rainy to do anything active. Frozen lakes offer
opportunities for skating and hockey, plus “there’s also a lot of beauty
and intrigue in ice — you know, icicles and frozen rainstorms,”
Leibowitz went on.
</p>
<p>
Snow, meanwhile, “reflects the light, so it makes the darkness of winter
feel much, much brighter,” Leibowitz said. “And most people think it’s
really beautiful — it’s clean and fresh and it smells good.”
</p>
<p>
Of course, winter weather can be dangerous, too, but “places that are
colder and have really frozen winters have good infrastructure for
dealing with that, and houses tend to be better insulated and heated
more efficiently,” Leibowitz said. Bad winter weather can also give us
much-needed
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2020/02/why-adults-still-love-snow-days/606481/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">permission
to rest</a>.
</p>
<p>
While there are certain places further in the south, such as Atlanta,
where winter might genuinely become more pleasant as the planet warms,
“there are far more places where the end of winter is just going to mean
places are dark and wet,” without the upsides that come with the snow
and freezing temperatures, Leibowitz stressed.
</p>
<p>
Michael Varnum, the head of the Culture and Ecology Laboratory at
Arizona State University and a specialist in
<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/17456916231178695" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">seasonal
psychology</a>, did find one positive. “Nobody likes to feel down, or to
look at their waistline and see it’s grown,” he told me. “So
potentially, there could be some upsides there.”
</p>
<p>
Naturally, much of how you feel about winter will depend on the climate
where you live. In general, though, “we are somewhat more insulated from
the changes in temperature that come with the seasons than we were, say,
10,000 years ago or even a couple hundred years ago,” Varnum said.
Feelings of climate anxiety and distress tend to be highest in
Indigenous communities in or near the Arctic, where the cold weather is
a part of cultural identity and inheritance. Likewise, Davenport told
me, in “places where there tends to be a lot of snow” like Japan or
Finland, “there’s talk about things like ‘winter grief,’” where a milder
winter makes it so that “certain rituals or holidays that have been
planned in the past can’t happen anymore or as consistently.”
</p>
<p>
Many Americans, too,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/fifth-national-climate-assessment-america" target="_self">lose
a sense of themselves</a> when winter gets milder. “It’s what a lot of
us love about living here: our winters,” Erich Osterberg, a Dartmouth
climate scientist,
<a href="https://newhampshirebulletin.com/2022/01/06/losing-winter-and-big-chunks-of-new-hampshires-identity/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told
<em>The New Hampshire Bulletin</em></a> in 2022. “It’s more than changes
to the climate,” he added, “it’s changes to our livelihood and our
culture.” I encountered similar comments from Minnesotans when I was
looking into how an unseasonably dry winter is imperiling this year’s
cross country ski season: “Spiritually, this is terrible,” Claire
Wilson, the executive director of Minneapolis’ Loppet Foundation,
recently
<a href="https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-climate-change-warm-winter-december-2023-laura-yuen-sven-sundgaard-world-cup-loppet/600332632/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told
the <em>Star Tribune</em></a>.
</p>
<p>
Winter doesn’t have to be dreaded, Leibowitz said — much of one’s
enjoyment of the season comes down to
<a href="https://www.karileibowitz.com/winter-mindset" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mindset</a>.
But it does seem to matter that winter is actually, well,
<em>wintery</em>, too. Whether that’s a question of our evolutionary
seasonal biology (winter appears to be an important trigger for
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/12/12/winter-mood-sex-concentration-diet/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the
human reproductive cycle</a>, for one thing), or a matter of our
cultural practices, or something as simple as snow being more fun than
rain, it’s hard to make the case that warming winters will leave us
better off.
</p>
<p>
“If you want me to find the psychological upside of anything, I could
maybe do it,” Leibowitz confessed. She added, though, that “a lot of
people think, ‘I hate winter, I hate the cold, I would be happy if it
was warmer all year round.’ But people underestimate how much there is
to be lost in losing winter.”

Jan 2024)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-29, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links I assure you, an AI didn’t write a terrible “George
Carlin” routine: The Mechanical Turk would like to have a word with all
of us. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history:
2004, 2009, 2014, 2019, 2023 Colophon: Recent publications,
upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading I
assure you, an AI didn’t write a terrible “George Carlin” routine
(permalink) On Hallowe’en 1974, Ronald Clark O’Bryan murdered his son
with poisoned candy. He needed the insurance money, and he knew that
Halloween poisonings were rampant, so he figured he’d get away with it.
He was wrong: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Clark_O%27Bryan The
stories of Hallowe’en poisonings were just that – stories. No one was
poisoning kids on Hallowe’en – except this monstrous murderer, who
mistook rampant scare stories for truth and assumed (incorrectly) that
his murder would blend in with the crowd. Last week, the dudes behind
the “comedy” podcast Dudesy released a “George Carlin” comedy special
that they claimed had been created, holus bolus, by an AI trained on the
comedian’s routines. This was a lie. After the Carlin estate sued, the
dudes admitted that they had written the (remarkably unfunny) “comedy”
special:
https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/01/george-carlins-heirs-sue-comedy-podcast-over-ai-generated-impression/
As I’ve written, we’re nowhere near the point where an AI can do your
job, but we’re well past the point where your boss can be suckered into
firing you and replacing you with a bot that fails at doing your job:
https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/15/passive-income-brainworms/#four-hour-work-week
AI systems can do some remarkable party tricks, but there’s a huge
difference between producing a plausible sentence and a good one. After
the initial rush of astonishment, the stench of botshit becomes
unmistakable:
https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/03/botshit-generative-ai-imminent-threat-democracy
Some of this botshit comes from people who are sold a bill of goods:
they’re convinced that they can make a George Carlin special without any
human intervention and when the bot fails, they manufacture their own
botshit, assuming they must be bad at prompting the AI. This is an old
technology story: I had a friend who was contracted to livestream a
Canadian awards show in the earliest days of the web. They booked in
multiple ISDN lines from Bell Canada and set up an impressive Mbone
encoding station on the wings of the stage. Only one problem: the ISDNs
flaked (this was a common problem with ISDNs!). There was no way to
livecast the show. Nevertheless, my friend’s boss’s ordered him to go on
pretending to livestream the show. They made a big deal of it, with all
kinds of cool visualizers showing the progress of this futuristic
marvel, which the cameras frequently lingered on, accompanied by
overheated narration from the show’s hosts. The weirdest part? The next
day, my friend – and many others – heard from satisfied viewers who
boasted about how amazing it had been to watch this show on their
computers, rather than their TVs. Remember: there had been no stream.
These people had just assumed that the problem was on their end – that
they had failed to correctly install and configure the multiple browser
plugins required. Not wanting to admit their technical incompetence,
they instead boasted about how great the show had been. It was the
Emperor’s New Livestream. Perhaps that’s what happened to the Dudesy
bros. But there’s another possibility: maybe they were captured by their
own imaginations. In “Genesis,” an essay in the 2007 collection The
Creationists, EL Doctorow (no relation) describes how the ancient
Babylonians were so poleaxed by the strange wonder of the story they
made up about the origin of the universe that they assumed that it must
be true. They themselves weren’t nearly imaginative enough to have come
up with this super-cool tale, so God must have put it in their minds:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/29/gedankenexperimentwahn/#high-on-your-own-supply
That seems to have been what happened to the Air Force colonel who
falsely claimed that a “rogue AI-powered drone” had spontaneously
evolved the strategy of killing its operator as a way of clearing the
obstacle to its main objective, which was killing the enemy:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/06/04/ayyyyyy-eyeeeee/ This never happened.
It was – in the chagrined colonel’s words – a “thought experiment.” In
other words, this guy – who is the USAF’s Chief of AI Test and
Operations – was so excited about his own made up story that he forgot
it wasn’t true and told a whole conference-room full of people that it
had actually happened. Maybe that’s what happened with the George
Carlinbot 3000: the Dudesy dudes fell in love with their own vision for
a fully automated luxury Carlinbot and forgot that they had made it up,
so they just cheated, assuming they would eventually be able to make a
fully operational Battle Carlinbot. That’s basically the Theranos story:
a teenaged “entrepreneur” was convinced that she was just about to
produce a seemingly impossible, revolutionary diagnostic machine, so she
faked its results, abetted by investors, customers and others who wanted
to believe: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos The thing about
stories of AI miracles is that they are peddled by both AI’s boosters
and its critics. For boosters, the value of these tall tales is obvious:
if normies can be convinced that AI is capable of performing miracles,
they’ll invest in it. They’ll even integrate it into their product
offerings and then quietly hire legions of humans to pick up the botshit
it leaves behind. These abettors can be relied upon to keep the defects
in these products a secret, because they’ll assume that they’ve
committed an operator error. After all, everyone knows that AI can do
anything, so if it’s not performing for them, the problem must exist
between the keyboard and the chair. But this would only take AI so far.
It’s one thing to hear implausible stories of AI’s triumph from the
people invested in it – but what about when AI’s critics repeat those
stories? If your boss thinks an AI can do your job, and AI critics are
all running around with their hair on fire, shouting about the coming AI
jobpocalypse, then maybe the AI really can do your job?
https://locusmag.com/2020/07/cory-doctorow-full-employment/ There’s a
name for this kind of criticism: “criti-hype,” coined by Lee Vinsel, who
points to many reasons for its persistence, including the fact that it
constitutes an “academic business-model”:
https://sts-news.medium.com/youre-doing-it-wrong-notes-on-criticism-and-technology-hype-18b08b4307e5
That’s four reasons for AI hype: I. to win investors and customers; II.
to cover customers’ and users’ embarrassment when the AI doesn’t
perform; III. AI dreamers so high on their own supply that they can’t
tell truth from fantasy; IV. A business-model for doomsayers who form an
unholy alliance with AI companies by parroting their silliest hype in
warning form. But there’s a fifth motivation for criti-hype: to simplify
otherwise tedious and complex situations. As Jamie Zawinski writes, this
is the motivation behind the obvious lie that the “autonomous cars” on
the streets of San Francisco have no driver:
https://www.jwz.org/blog/2024/01/driverless-cars-always-have-a-driver/
GM’s Cruise division was forced to shutter its SF operations after one
of its “self-driving” cars dragged an injured pedestrian for 20 feet:
https://www.wired.com/story/cruise-robotaxi-self-driving-permit-revoked-california/
One of the widely discussed revelations in the wake of the incident was
that Cruise employed 1.5 skilled technical remote overseers for every
one of its “self-driving” cars. In other words, they had replaced a
single low-waged cab driver with 1.5 higher-paid remote operators. As
Zawinski writes, SFPD is well aware that there’s a human being (or more
than one human being) responsible for every one of these cars – someone
who is formally at fault when the cars injure people or damage property.
Nevertheless, SFPD and SFMTA maintain that these cars can’t be cited for
moving violations because “no one is driving them.” But figuring out who
which person is responsible for a moving violation is “complicated and
annoying to deal with,” so the fiction persists. (Zawinski notes that
even when these people are held responsible, they’re a “moral crumple
zone” for the company that decided to enroll whole cities in
nonconsensual murderbot experiments.) Automation hype has always
involved hidden humans. The most famous of these was the “mechanical
Turk” hoax: a supposed chess-playing robot that was just a puppet
operated by a concealed human operator wedged awkwardly into its
carapace. This pattern repeats itself through the ages. Thomas Jefferson
“replaced his slaves” with dumbwaiters – but of course, dumbwaiters
don’t replace slaves, they hide slaves:
https://www.stuartmcmillen.com/blog/behind-the-dumbwaiter/ The modern
Mechanical Turk – a division of Amazon that employs low-waged
“clickworkers,” many of them overseas – modernizes the dumbwaiter by
hiding low-waged workforces behind a veneer of automation. The MTurk is
an abstract “cloud” of human intelligence (the tasks MTurks perform are
called “HITs,” which stands for “Human Intelligence Tasks”). This is
such a truism that techies in India joke that “AI” stands for “absent
Indians.” Or, to use Jathan Sadowski’s wonderful term: “Potemkin AI”:
https://reallifemag.com/potemkin-ai/ This Potemkin AI is everywhere you
look. When Tesla unveiled its humanoid robot Optimus, they made a big
flashy show of it, promising a $20,000 automaton was just on the
horizon. They failed to mention that Optimus was just a person in a
robot suit:
https://www.siliconrepublic.com/machines/elon-musk-tesla-robot-optimus-ai
Likewise with the famous demo of a “full self-driving” Tesla, which
turned out to be a canned fake:
https://www.reuters.com/technology/tesla-video-promoting-self-driving-was-staged-engineer-testifies-2023-01-17/
The most shocking and terrifying and enraging AI demos keep turning out
to be “Just A Guy” (in Molly White’s excellent parlance):
https://twitter.com/molly0xFFF/status/1751670561606971895 And yet, we
keep falling for it. It’s no wonder, really: criti-hype rewards so many
different people in so many different ways that it truly offers
something for everyone. (Image: Cryteria, CC BY 3.0; Ross Breadmore, CC

<p>Today—last night U.S. time—three military personnel were killed and
34 more wounded in a drone attack on the living quarters at a U.S. base
in Jordan, near the Iraq-Syria border. U.S. troops are stationed there
to enable them to cross into Syria to help fight the Islamic State.
There have been almost-daily drone and missile strikes on U.S. forces in
Iraq and Syria since the October 7 attack on Israel by Iran-backed
Hamas. The U.S. has blamed Iran-backed militant groups for the attack,
and while no one has officially claimed responsibility yet, three
officials from such groups have said an Iran-backed militia in Iraq is
responsible.</p>

id="illinois-election-officials-to-consider-striking-trumps-name-off-primary-ballot">Illinois
Election Officials to Consider Striking Trump’s Name off Primary
Ballot</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CHICAGO — Former President Donald Trump should be removed from
Illinois’ primary ballot, but the decision should be left to the courts,
a retired judge recommended Sunday to the state’s election board,
arguing that it was clear Trump engaged in insurrection in the Jan. 6,
2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.</p>
<p>The Illinois State Board of Elections is expected to consider the
recommendation Tuesday. Attorneys for Trump and citizens seeking to keep
the Republican former president off the ballot presented their arguments
Friday before the hearing officer, Clark Erickson. The retired longtime
Kankakee County judge is a Republican.</p>
<p>The Illinois effort to keep Trump off the March ballot is similar to
those filed in several other states. The U.S. Supreme Court is set to
hear arguments next month in a historic Colorado Supreme Court ruling to
remove Trump from that state’s ballot. The case presents the high court
with its first look at a provision of the 14th Amendment barring some
people who “engaged in insurrection” from holding public office.</p>
<p>Erickson’s 21-page recommendation concluded that a “preponderance of
the evidence” presented proves that Trump engaged in insurrection.</p>
<p>But he said the election board can’t engage in the “significant and
sophisticated constitutional analysis” required to remove Trump’s name
before the March 19 primary.</p>
<p>“All in all, attempting to resolve a constitutional issue within the
expedited schedule of an election board hearing is somewhat akin to
scheduling a two-minute round between heavyweight boxers in a telephone
booth,” he wrote.</p>
<p>Still, Erickson noted that even if the board disagrees with his
reasoning, Trump’s name should be removed from the Illinois primary
ballot.</p>
<p>The election board is split evenly between four Democrats and four
Republicans.</p>
<p>Free Speech for People, which is leading the Illinois ballot effort,
praised the recommendation from the Republican retired judge as
“significant” but argued that Illinois law allows the board to make the
ballot decision.</p>
<p>“We expect that the board and ultimately Illinois courts will uphold
Judge Erickson’s thoughtful analysis of why Trump is disqualified from
office, but — with the greatest respect — correct him on why Illinois
law authorizes that ruling,” Ron Fein, legal director for the group,
wrote in a Sunday statement.</p>
<p>Trump’s campaign did not immediately return a message left
Sunday.</p>

id="house-republicans-release-impeachment-articles-against-homeland-security-secretary-mayorkas">House
Republicans Release Impeachment Articles Against Homeland Security
Secretary Mayorkas</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — House Republicans on Sunday released two articles of
impeachment against Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas as
they vowed to swiftly push forward with election-year efforts to oust
him over what they call his failure to manage the U.S.-Mexico border.
The rare step against a Cabinet member drew outrage from Democrats and
the agency as a politically motivated stunt lacking the constitutional
basis to remove Mayorkas from office.</p>
<p>Republicans contend Mayorkas is guilty of “high crimes and
misdemeanors” that amount to a “willful and systemic refusal to comply
with the law” on immigration and a “breach of the public trust.”
Impeachment, they say, is “Congress’s only viable option.”</p>
<p>“Alejandro N. Mayorkas willfully and systemically refused to comply
with the immigration laws, failed to control the border to the detriment
of national security, compromised public safety, and violated the rule
of law and separation of powers in the Constitution, to the manifest
injury of the people of the United States,” the impeachment resolution
says.</p>
<p>Only once in American history has a Cabinet secretary been impeached:
William Belknap, President Ulysses Grant’s war secretary, in 1876, over
kickbacks in government contracts. Going after an official for a policy
dispute, in this instance over the claim that Mayorkas is not upholding
immigration laws, is unprecedented.</p>
<p>Ever since taking control of the House in 2023, Republicans have
pushed to impeach Mayorkas. Sunday’s announcement comes as their other
impeachment drive — to impeach Democratic President Joe Biden in
relation to his son Hunter’s business dealings — has struggled to
advance.</p>
<p>But Republicans have moved with rapid speed against Mayorkas after a
series of hearings in recent weeks. It all comes at a time when border
security and immigration are key issues in the 2024 campaign and as
Donald Trump, the front-runner for the Republican presidential
nomination, is promising to launch the “largest deportation operation”
in U.S. history if he returns to the White House.</p>
<p>The Republican-controlled House Homeland Security Committee is set to
vote Tuesday on the articles of impeachment, aiming to send them to the
full House for consideration. Republican Speaker Mike Johnson has said
the House will move forward as soon as possible with a vote after
that.</p>
<p>Passage requires only a House majority. The Senate would hold a
trial, and a two-thirds vote is required for conviction, an exceedingly
unlikely outcome in the Democratic-run Senate.</p>
<p>The Republican push also comes at a curious time for Mayorkas.</p>
<p>Even as the House is taking steps to try to remove him from office,
Mayorkas has been engaged in arduous negotiations with senators seeking
to reach a bipartisan deal on border policy. He has won praise from
senators for his engagement in the process.</p>
<p>Democrats have lambasted the impeachment proceedings, calling them a
waste of time when lawmakers should be working together to solve the
problems. They also say Republicans are part of the problems at the
border, with Republicans attacking Mayorkas even as they have failed to
give his department the tools it needs to manage the situation.</p>
<p>“They don’t want to fix the problem; they want to campaign on it.
That’s why they have undermined efforts to achieve bipartisan solutions
and ignored the facts, legal scholars and experts, and even the
Constitution itself in their quest to baselessly impeach Secretary
Mayorkas,” the department said in a statement Sunday.</p>
<p>Rep. Bennie Thompson, the top Democrat on the House committee, said
the Republican resolution did not have “a shred of evidence of high
crimes or misdemeanors — the Constitutional standard for
impeachment.” </p>
<p>The two articles mark the culmination of a roughly yearlong
examination by Republicans of the secretary’s handling of the border and
what they describe as a crisis of the administration’s own making.
Republicans contend that the administration and Mayorkas specifically
either got rid of policies in place under Trump that had controlled
migration or enacted policies of their own that encouraged migrants from
around the world to come to the U.S. illegally via the southern border.
They also accused Mayorkas of lying to Congress, pointing to comments
about the border being secure or about vetting of Afghans airlifted to
the U.S.</p>
<p>They cite growing numbers of migrants who have at times overwhelmed
the capacity of Customs and Border Protection authorities to care for
and process them. Arrests for illegal crossings topped 2 million in each
of the U.S. government’s past two budget years. In December, arrests for
illegal border crossings from Mexico reached an all-time high since
figures have been released. The backlog of people in immigration court
has grown by 1 million over the past budget year.</p>
<p>In the articles, Republicans argue that Mayorkas is deliberately
violating immigration laws passed by Congress, such as those requiring
detention of migrants, and that through his policies, a crisis has
arisen at the border. They accuse him of releasing migrants without
effective ways to make sure they show up for court or are removed from
the country. They cited an Immigration and Customs Enforcement memo
written by Mayorkas that sets priorities for whom the agency should
target for enforcement proceedings as proof that he is letting people
stay in the country who don’t have the right to do so.</p>
<p>They also attacked the administration’s use of the humanitarian
parole authority, which allows the DHS secretary to admit certain
migrants into the country. Republicans said the Biden administration has
essentially created a mass parole program that bypasses Congress. They
cited cities such as New York that have struggled with high numbers of
migrants, taxing housing and education systems, as proof of the
financial costs immigration is taking.</p>
<p>Democrats, as well as Mayorkas, have argued that it’s not the
administration’s policies that are causing people to attempt to migrate
to America but that the movement is part of a global mass migration of
people fleeing wars, economic instability and political repression.</p>

Pack Tampa, Florida, Waterfront for Gasparilla Pirate Fest</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Tampa, Florida — Revelers clad in pirate finery packed Tampa’s
waterfront this weekend as a flotilla of boats arrived for the city’s
annual Gasparilla Pirate Fest.</p>
<p>Led by Ye Mystic Krewe of Gasparilla, the invading pirates docked to
make a final demand for the key to the city. Once ashore, the
festivities celebrating their annual invasion included a Saturday
afternoon parade through downtown and live music and bead throwing that
lasted well into the night.</p>
<p>A fixture nearly every year since 1904, the Gasparilla Pirate Fest is
named for the mythical pirate Jose Gaspar. There’s not much evidence he
actually existed, but according to legend he plundered ships and
captured hostages in the Gulf of Mexico from the 1780s until around
1821.</p>
<p>The colorful account of his supposed life first surfaced in the early
1900s in an advertising brochure for the Gasparilla Inn, which was
located south of Tampa in Boca Grande at the end of a rail line and in
need of an exciting promotion to lure in guests.</p>
<p>Called the “Last of the Buccaneers,” Gaspar’s memory lives on in the
name of Tampa Bay’s NFL team.</p>

Redefines Distributed PostgreSQL with the Launch of pgEdge Cloud
Developer Edition</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-29, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
First serverless distributed Postgres managed cloud service delivers low
latency and high availability in three minutes or less
</p>
<p>
Alexandria, Virginia – January 24, 2024 — pgEdge, Inc., the leading
company dedicated to distributed Postgres, today announced the launch of
pgEdge Cloud Developer Edition, making it easy for developers to deploy
and access distributed Postgres databases for low latency and high
availability. pgEdge Cloud is the first fully distributed database as a
service (DBaaS) optimized for the network edge and based completely on
the widely adopted open-source PostgreSQL database. pgEdge Cloud
Developer is a generous free tier for developers to rapidly and easily
experience the advantages of distributed Postgres.
</p>
<p>
pgEdge Cloud addresses the growing demand for low-latency and “always
on” applications that need to be dispersed across multiple cloud
regions. As a fully managed distributed Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS),
pgEdge Cloud empowers developers and database architects with an
intuitive user interface for creation, management and monitoring of
distributed database clusters running across multiple cloud regions.
</p>
<p>
By putting database nodes closer to global users, pgEdge Cloud can
dramatically reduce latency and application response times, particularly
page loads for database intensive applications. Additionally, having
multiple replicated database nodes across the network ensures high
levels of availability, since when a node fails or is not reachable
traffic automatically routes to the nearest still available node.
</p>
<p>
pgEdge Cloud is especially well suited for use with edge development
platforms such as Cloudflare Workers, Vercel and Fastly. The ability to
place database nodes in multiple regions around the global network,
together with automated and seamless nearest-node routing, allow
developers to deploy very low latency applications that eliminate slow
round trips to a single centrally located database. pgEdge Cloud
Developer Edition includes built-in integration for Cloudflare Workers,
and support for Vercel and Fastly will be available in coming weeks. An
example demonstrating pgEdge Cloud’s ease of integration with Cloudflare
is https://github.com/pgEdge/cloudflare-worker-template. Additionally, a
demo application running against a distributed version of the well-known
“Northwind Traders” database, and implemented with Cloudflare Workers
and pgEdge Cloud, is at: https://northwind.pgedge.com/.
</p>
<p>
Key features of pgEdge Cloud Developer Edition include:
</p>
<p>
Instant Deployment: Developers can now deploy a globally distributed
PostgreSQL serverless database in just a minute, streamlining the
database setup process and accelerating development.
</p>
<p>
Predefined multi-region clusters: Creation and deployment of pgEdge
distributed databases is simplified via prebuilt global clusters.
Developers can select from a set of predefined multi-region clusters
that span the continental US, US and Europe, or US, Europe and Asia.
</p>
<p>
Multi-Master (Active-Active) Architecture: Each database node can handle
both read and write traffic for low latency and high availability,
utilizing an eventually consistent multi-master architecture with built
in conflict resolution and reporting.
</p>
<p>
Latency-based DNS Routing: Geo-proximity routing ensures that users are
connected to the nearest pgEdge node that is up and running.
</p>
<p>
Generous Free Tier: Available for prototyping, application development
and evaluation of pgEdge capabilities with up to 12GB of storage across
three nodes.
</p>
<p>
Management and Monitoring: Eliminates the need for manual infrastructure
configuration and management while providing automated backups, security
against misconfiguration, and continuous monitoring via a clean and easy
to use web dashboard.
</p>
<p>
“pgEdge Cloud Developer Edition marks a significant leap in our mission
to make it easy for developers to build and deploy highly distributed
database applications across the global network,” said Phillip Merrick,
Co-founder and CEO at pgEdge. “The innovative features of the pgEdge
Cloud fully managed service, from multi-region, multi-master support to
its intuitive user interface, empower developers to easily create and
manage distributed PostgreSQL databases.”
</p>
<p>
Availability
</p>
<p>
pgEdge Cloud Developer Edition is available today in preview. Users
requiring more resources or capabilities beyond what is offered in the
Developer Edition free tier can upgrade to either pgEdge Cloud Team
Edition (coming in H1 2024), or pgEdge Cloud Enterprise Edition.
</p>

<h2 id="us-china-to-resume-stalled-fentanyl-talks-in-beijing">US, China
to Resume Stalled Fentanyl Talks in Beijing</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — U.S. and Chinese officials will meet in Beijing Tuesday
for their first talks in years to stem the production of ingredients for
the drug fentanyl, senior Biden administration officials said.</p>
<p>The meeting of the counternarcotics working group comes after Chinese
President Xi Jinping pledged during a summit with U.S. President Joe
Biden in November to clamp down on the trade.</p>
<p>“For years bilateral cooperation between the United States and the
People’s Republic of China on counternarcotics has been suspended which
has hindered our progress,” a U.S. official said.</p>
<p>“But that changed during the November 15 meeting,” the official told
reporters on the condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>Washington hopes to get China to cooperate on tackling companies that
manufacture the precursor chemicals to make fentanyl, a synthetic opioid
many times more powerful than heroin, and on cutting financing for the
trade.</p>
<p>Fentanyl has caused an epidemic of addiction in the United States,
with 100,000 overdose deaths a year, making it the leading cause of
death of people aged 18 to 49, the official said.</p>
<p>Since the summit China has shut down one company, blocked some
international payments and resumed sharing information on shipments and
trafficking, added the official.</p>
<p>The meeting, featuring U.S. justice, homeland security, diplomatic
and counternarcotics officials, will focus on “ongoing coordination to
support concrete enforcement actions.”</p>
<p>Xi said after meeting Biden in California in November that China
“deeply sympathizes” with victims of fentanyl.</p>
<p>China and the United States have been trying to stabilize relations
after years of tensions with Beijing’s top diplomat Wang Yi and U.S.
national security adviser Jake Sullivan meeting in Bangkok this past
week.</p>
<p>Another senior U.S. official said after those talks that cooperation
on fentanyl between the two countries “needs to be continuous and
ongoing. It’s not just one snapshot in time.”</p>

Orleans Thief Steals 7 King Cakes From Bakery in Very Mardi Gras
Way</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New Orleans, Louisiana — With their purple, gold and green colors and
toy babies hidden inside, king cakes are staples of Mardi Gras
celebrations in New Orleans, but apparently they’re also valuable enough
to steal — at least this time of year during the Carnival season.</p>
<p>A thief stole seven king cakes — about as many as he could carry —
during a break-in last week at a New Orleans bakery. The thief also took
cash and a case of vodka from Bittersweet Confections last Wednesday,
according to the New Orleans Police Department.</p>
<p>“Our king cakes are just that good,” the bakery wrote on social
media. “But please come and purchase one during our regular store
hours.”</p>
<p>While it’s a secular celebration, Carnival in New Orleans — and
around the world — is strongly linked to Christian and Roman Catholic
traditions. The season begins on Jan. 6, the 12th day after Christmas,
and continues until Mardi Gras, known as Fat Tuesday, which is the final
day of feasting, drinking and revelry before Ash Wednesday and the
fasting associated with Lent.</p>
<p>King cakes are among the foods most associated with Carnival in New
Orleans. The rings of pastry are adorned with purple, green and gold
sugar or icing, and they often have a tiny plastic baby hidden inside as
a prize.</p>
<p>One wisecracker responded to the bakery’s social media post with a
tongue-in-cheek false admission that he was the thief.</p>
<p>“It was me. …I’m holding all seven babies hostage until I get a
lifetime supply of King Cakes from you every year,” the man posted.</p>

Newspaper to Relaunch Print Edition After Theft Forced It to Lay Off Its
Staff</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Portland, Oregon — An Oregon weekly newspaper that had to lay off its
entire staff after its funds were embezzled by a former employee will
relaunch its print edition next month, its editor said, a move made
possible in large part by fundraising campaigns and community
contributions.</p>
<p>The Eugene Weekly will return to newsstands on Feb. 8 with roughly
25,000 copies, about six weeks after the embezzlement forced the
decades-old publication to halt its print edition, editor Camilla
Mortensen said Saturday.</p>
<p>“It has been both terrifying and wonderful,” Mortensen told The
Associated Press, describing the emotional rollercoaster of the last few
weeks. “I thought it was hard to run a paper. It’s much harder to
resurrect a paper.”</p>
<p>The alternative weekly, founded in 1982 and distributed for free in
Eugene, one of the largest cities in Oregon, had to lay off its entire
10-person staff right before Christmas. It was around that time that the
paper became aware of at least $100,000 in unpaid bills and discovered
that a now-former employee who had been involved with the paper’s
finances had used its bank account to pay themselves around $90,000,
Mortensen said.</p>
<p>Additionally, multiple employees, including Mortensen, realized that
money from their paychecks that was supposed to be going into retirement
accounts was never deposited.</p>
<p>The accused employee was fired after the embezzlement came to
light.</p>
<p>The news was a devastating blow to a publication that serves as an
important source of information in a community that, like many others
nationwide, is struggling with growing gaps in local news coverage.</p>
<p>The Eugene police department’s investigation is still ongoing, and
forensic accountants hired by the paper are continuing to piece together
what happened.</p>
<p>Local Eugene news outlets KEZI and KLCC were among the first to
report the weekly’s return to print.</p>
<p>Since the layoffs, some former staff members have continued to
volunteer their time to help keep the paper’s website up and running.
Much of the online content published in recent weeks has been work from
journalism students at the University of Oregon, located in Eugene, and
from freelancers who offered to submit stories for free — “the
journalistic equivalent of pro bono,” Mortensen said.</p>
<p>Some former employees had to find other jobs in order to make ends
meet. But Mortensen hopes to eventually rehire her staff once the paper
pays its outstanding bills and becomes more financially sustainable.</p>
<p>The paper has raised roughly $150,000 since December, Mortensen said.
The majority of the money came from an online GoFundMe campaign, but
financial support also came from local businesses, artists and readers.
The paper even received checks from people living as far away as Iowa
and New York after news outlets across the country picked up the
story.</p>
<p>“People were so invested in helping us that it just really gives me
hope for journalism at a time where I think a lot of people don’t have
hope,” she told the AP. “When we saw how many people contributed and how
many people continue to offer to help, you can’t not try to print the
paper. You’ve got to give it a shot.”</p>
<p>The paper aims to continue weekly printing beyond Feb. 8.</p>

Spotify</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-28, from: Om Malik blog</p>
<p>As a way to play music, it was better in nearly every way. Spotify
then became my favorite way to listen to music. Recently though, I’ve
found myself hating Spotify. The app loads slowly. Music no longer plays
instantly. The interface is riddled with recommendations, podcasts,
audiobooks, and other junk that I don’t care for. …</p>

macOS app windows for 16:9 screen capture</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-28, from: Jeff Geerling blog</p>
<p><span
class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Resizing
macOS app windows for 16:9 screen capture</span></p>
<pre><code>        &lt;div class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I frequently need to capture a window of some Mac app for a recording (usually for my YouTube channel), and I&#39;ve used a little AppleScript I wrote years ago for the purpose.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
Somehow, that script (which I saved as a ‘one shot’ App
(<code>.app</code> extension) that just runs then quits) got deleted off
my Script Editor folder in my iCloud Drive, so I had to re-create it.
</p>
<p>
Luckily, the syntax for this operation is dead simple:
</p>
<pre><code>tell application "Safari"
    set bounds of front window to {0, 50, 1280, 770}
end tell
</code></pre>
<p>
You can adjust the <code>{X, Y, width, height}</code> parameters
accordingly—note that the width and height seem to be additive to the
X/Y. So I use 770 instead of 720 for the height (720 + 50).
</p>
<p>
In <code>Script Editor</code>, save the file as a <code>.app</code>,
with the option to keep it running unchecked. Now, whenever you want a
window sized perfectly for capture, just press Command + Spacebar, then
type in the name of the Script/App you saved, and hit enter. The
top-most window in Safari will scale to exactly 720p resolution.

its seven-year older and smaller sibling, the Honda CR-V.</p>
<p>The Honda HR-V, the smallest of an SUV foursome, arrived in North
America in 2015. The Honda Passport, positioned between the HR-V and the
Pilot, debuted in 1993.</p>

<h2 id="morning-chatgpt-notes">Morning ChatGPT Notes</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-28, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2017/09/04/peterRojas.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I
spent a couple of days putting together a JSON text editor in a modal
dialog for a project I’m working on. I’m combining the
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/aceEditorDemo">Ace editor</a> with
the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap toolkit</a>. I’ve used
both components before, but never together. And they’re always a bit
tricky to get working because I’m impatient and the docs are spread out,
and there are different versions. It’s all kind of a mess, so you just
get it working and move on, never quite sure why it works, and I rarely
end up with reusable code. But it’s certainly a lot better than starting
from scratch, which basically is impossible, given the depth of the two
components. After spinning my wheels a bit, I did what I always do in
2024, I turned to ChatGPT, outlined the problem, and asked if it knew of
any sample code, which it proceeded to write for me, in about two
seconds (not kidding about that). I copied their code and pasted it into
my editor and ran it. It worked. Then I went through a number of
iterations, restructuring the code to meet my needs, each time checking
with ChatGPT, asking what it thought of my code. And of course there
were problems, for example at one point there were two vertical
scrollbars, and each time we worked <i>together</i> to figure out the
problem and the fix. In the end, I have a solid editor that works
exactly as I want it to, and best of all, I understand how it works.
Here’s the
<a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/840e8159-9988-4159-8289-5167d6fb78c8">transcript
of the work</a> I did with it, over more than 24 hours, a few different
sessions.
</p>
<p>
I’ll try to remember when this code ships as part of a product, to link
to this perspective.
</p>
<p>
Next up, I’d like to get it to understand my coding conventions, so when
it shares code with me it can save me the step of having to convert its
conventions to mine. In other words, I’d like to return the favor. It’s
doing a great job of teaching and coaching me. I’d like to teach it how
to do that better, so we work better together over time. And perhaps it
can teach human programmers what I’ve learned about programming in over
50 years of doing this work.
</p>
<p>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2017/09/05/enjoyEveryDay.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">A
bit of philosophy. People say these things aren’t intelligent, but
seriously, if I can engage with it as if it were intelligent, far more
intelligent in ways than I am, what’s the difference between that and
actually being intelligent? I know from a lifetime of dealing with
supposedly intelligent humans, and being one myself, how rarely we focus
on the idea that the person we’re conversing with has an inner life
that’s vastly different from ours and no less complex, and
contradictory. We tend to think of others as being like us, or like
someone who raised us. Always in a movie, never in the moment. So why is
it interesting that ChatGPT is a machine? These are questions thinkers
and writers have been pondering for decades if not centuries, but –
<i>now we’re living it.</i> I’m so happy to have made it this far! An
amazing experience, so much learning in so little time. I don’t
understand how people can sit on the sidelines and not want to be the
first to try all this stuff out, to be part of its evolution. I feel so
lucky.
</p>
<p>
A puzzling thing, in the transcripts I’m identified as “anonymous,” but
I am logged in. It must know my name. I bet this is some kind of setting
which defaults to anonymous, to play it safe.
</p>
<p>
One more thing. I copied and pasted the text above into ChatGPT.
<a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/5fe361cd-1fca-4e8d-82cc-920514e8c4b8">Here
are its comments</a>. A funny thing about ChatGPT is that you can’t ask
it how to use ChatGPT itself. It doesn’t know about the chat UI?
</p>
<p>
Yet another thing. I remember my father, when he was forced to retire by
illness, said how fortunate he was that the internet was there, so he
could be involved in the world even though he had stopped working. He
said his father would have loved it, and I don’t doubt that he would.
Same with ChatGPT. My parents and uncles were always looking up stuff,
wanting to understand how things worked. This is a whole new level. The
machines are now far better at collaborating over the net than humans
are. Where will that take us? Maybe this is something else we can learn
from the machines.

Toyota Corolla Cross. Small crossovers, also known as subcompact SUVs,
are a type of sport utility vehicle that are smaller in size and have a
more fuel efficient design that gets better gas mileage than all the
larger SUVs.</p>

<p>I was reminiscing recently about songs that are close to my heart. So

certainly a reason to smile. Back in 1982, Willie recorded “Always On My

<p>date: 2024-01-28, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
Drivethru, I am unhappy!
</h1>
<p>
The DrivethruRPG website so depends on shit that it loads from other
domains that I cannot log in no matter how many exceptions I add to
uBlock Origin, Privacy Badger, or the Firefox content blocking
preferences. And with every second I spend doing this, I resent them
more. And when I finally start Chromium to try and connect, I’m already
ranting as I sit at my laptop. And then I get Connection timed out from
cloudflare and really… I feel like they don’t want my money. Uuuugh.
</p>
<p>
I used their contact form. When I hit the submit button I was greeted by
a white page. I don’t know if they go an email. (I did try the next day
from a phone and that worked – which sort of illustrates the point.)
</p>
<p>
Here’s what I wrote:
</p>
<p>
I think in a world where big tech is tracking us, where everybody and
their uncle is spying on us, it is only natural that people start
locking down their browser. I have uBlock Origin and Privacy Badger
installed and I tell all my browsers to do as much content blocking as
they can, I delete all cookies when I close the browser. It’s the right
thing to do. It is all the more galling when a website such as Drivethru
becomes practically unusable as a consequence of me trying to do the
right thing. It feels as if Drivethru is betraying me to the big tech
corporations, helping them spy on me. It’s a revolting feeling. These
days, I have it every time I remember to use an unprotected Chromium
browser just to log into Drivethru. Every single time I wish for an
alternative. Every single time I hope that itch.io and other competitors
end up replacing you.
</p>
<p>
If only you had a simple, straight forward website, served your own
Javascript, had no tracking, and allowed me to browse stuff and buy it.
I don’t really expect an answer to this email. It just feels unfair to
rant on social media about the situation without telling you about it.
</p>
<p>
I hope Drivethru improves. I really do. I believe that change is
possible and I hope that you do, too.

Sees Signs of Progress on Deal to Release Israeli Hostages, Pause
War</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. negotiators are making progress on a potential
agreement under which Israel would pause military operations against
Hamas in Gaza for two months in exchange for the release of more than
100 hostages who were captured in the October 7 attack on Israel,
according to two senior administration officials.</p>
<p>The officials, who requested anonymity to discuss the sensitive
negotiations, said Saturday that emerging terms of the yet-to-be sealed
deal would play out over two phases.</p>
<p>In the first phase, fighting would stop to allow for the remaining
women, elderly and wounded hostages to be released by Hamas.</p>
<p>Israel and Hamas would then aim to work out details during the first
30 days of the pause for a second phase in which Israeli soldiers and
civilian men would be released. The emerging deal also calls for Israel
to allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza.</p>
<p>While the proposed deal would not end the war, U.S. officials are
hopeful that such an agreement could lay the groundwork for a durable
resolution to the conflict.</p>
<p>The New York Times first reported on Saturday that progress has been
made towards an agreement for a pause in fighting in exchange for the
remaining hostages.</p>
<p>CIA director Bill Burns is expected to discuss the contours of the
emerging agreement when he meets on Sunday in France with David Barnea,
the head of Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency, Qatari Prime Minister
Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, and Egyptian intelligence chief Abbas
Kamel for talks centered on the hostage negotiations, according to three
people familiar with the scheduled meeting who were not authorized to
comment publicly.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden on Friday spoke by phone with Egyptian President
Abdel Fattah el-Sissi and Qatar’s ruling emir, Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad
Al-Thani. Calls with both leaders focused on the hostage situation.</p>
<p>“Both leaders affirmed that a hostage deal is central to establishing
a prolonged humanitarian pause in the fighting and ensure additional
life-saving humanitarian assistance reaches civilians in need throughout
Gaza,” the White House said in a statement about Biden’s call with the
Qatari leader. “They underscored the urgency of the situation, and
welcomed the close cooperation among their teams to advance recent
discussions.”</p>
<p>Burns heads to France for the high-level talks after White House
senior adviser Brett McGurk traveled to the Mideast this week for talks
on the hostage situation.</p>
<p>If Burns sees progress in his talks in France, Biden may dispatch
McGurk back to the Mideast quickly to try to complete an agreement.
McGurk during his talks this week was also laying the groundwork for
another trip to the region by Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who
next week could make his fifth trip to the Middle East since the start
of the Israel-Hamas war in October.</p>
<p>The White House and CIA have yet to publicly confirm Burns’ meeting
in France and administration officials have been guarded that a deal can
quickly be brokered.</p>
<p>“We should not expect any imminent developments,” National Security
Council spokesperson John Kirby told reporters on Friday.</p>
<p>Biden and his aides are keenly aware that the mounting Palestinian
death toll, and widespread suffering in Gaza, is frustrating some in his
Democratic base, who want to see him put more pressure on Israel to end
the war. Democrats in Michigan have warned the White House that Biden’s
handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict could cost him enough support
within the state’s sizable Arab American community to sway the outcome
of the 2024 election in a state that could be key to whether he wins a
second term.</p>
<p>Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly vowed to
continue the offensive until complete victory over Hamas is
achieved.</p>
<p>Netanyahu has faced increasing pressure from the families of many
hostages who are demanding a deal to win their loved ones’ release.</p>
<p>The October 7 attack killed some 1,200 people in Israel, and Hamas
and other militants abducted around 250 people.</p>
<p>Around 100 hostages were freed under a weeklong cease-fire deal in
November in exchange for the release of Palestinians imprisoned by
Israel. Around 130 remain captive, but a number have since been
confirmed dead.</p>
<p>Hamas has previously said it will free more captives only in exchange
for an end to the war and the release of thousands of Palestinian
prisoners.</p>

<h2
id="artist-who-performed-nude-sues-museum-over-sexual-assault-claims">Artist
Who Performed Nude Sues Museum Over Sexual Assault Claims</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>albany, new york — A performer who appeared naked in a show by
world-renowned performance artist Marina Abramovic at New York City’s
Museum of Modern Art is suing the museum, saying it failed to take
action after he was sexually assaulted multiple times by attendees
during the performances nearly 14 years ago. </p>
<p>The suit was filed in Manhattan on Monday under the New York Adult
Survivors Act, a special state law that created a yearslong suspension
of the usual time limit for accusers to sue. Although the law expired
last year, the suit says the parties agreed to extend the window
closing. </p>
<p>John Bonafede alleges in the suit he was sexually assaulted by five
public onlookers who attended a show he was hired by the museum to
perform in as part of Abramovic’s retrospective “The Artist Is
Present.” </p>
<p>Email messages sent to the museum this week were not returned.
Abramovic is not named as a defendant and did not immediately return a
request for comment. </p>
<p>The work, titled “Imponderabilia,” saw Bonafede and another performer
standing face-to-face with each other in a doorway about 18 inches (45.7
centimeters) apart, fully nude, silent, and still. The exhibition, which
ran from March 14, 2010, through May 31, 2010, was curated by the museum
in a way that encouraged visitors to pass in between the performers as
they went from one gallery to the next, the suit alleges. </p>
<p>Mostly older men involved, says suit</p>
<p>The people who assaulted Bonafede were mostly older men, the suit
says. One of the perpetrators was a corporate member of the museum, who
was ultimately kicked out and revoked of his membership, according to
the suit. </p>
<p>During the final weeks of the exhibition, another attendee
non-consensually groped Bonafede’s private areas three times before they
were finally stopped by security, the suit said. </p>
<p>Bonafede reported four of the individuals to the museum staff and
security immediately, according to the suit, while the fifth was
witnessed personally by the museum security staff. </p>
<p>Female performer also assaulted, suit says</p>
<p>At one point, Bonafede also witnessed a public attendee sexually
assault his female co-performer by kissing her on the mouth without her
consent, the suit said. </p>
<p>Prior to the exhibition, the performers had voiced their concerns
about nude performers being subject to harassment in a letter to the
museum during contract negotiations, the suit said. </p>
<p>Once it began, several news outlets including The New York Times
reported on the inappropriate behavior by visitors, and the sexual
assaults on “Imponderabilia” were discussed within New York City’s art
and performance communities, the suit says. </p>
<p>Despite the museum having knowledge of the issue, it failed to take
action to protect the performers and prevent further sexual assaults,
such as telling visitors ahead of time that touching was not allowed,
the lawsuit said. </p>
<p>About a month into the exhibition, the museum created a handbook
outlining protocols for the performers to alert museum staff if they
felt unsafe or were inappropriately touched. </p>
<p>Bonafede agreed to continue the performance after he was assaulted
because of the “tough it out” culture of the exhibition, the suit says,
but suffered for years from emotional distress, and his mental health,
body image and career were damaged as a result. </p>
<p>The Associated Press generally does not name people who say they have
been sexually assaulted unless they come forward publicly. Bonafede gave
consent through his lawyer, Jordan Fletcher. </p>
<p>Fletcher declined to comment further on the suit, but said they will
be seeking a jury trial and compensatory damages.</p>

<h2 id="avian-flu-outbreaks-roil-us-poultry-industry">Avian Flu
Outbreaks Roil US Poultry Industry</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PETALUMA, Calif. — Last month, Mike Weber got the news every poultry
farmer fears: His chickens tested positive for avian flu.</p>
<p>Following government rules, Weber’s company, Sunrise Farms, had to
slaughter its entire flock of egg-laying hens — 550,000 birds — to
prevent the disease from infecting other farms in Sonoma County north of
San Francisco.</p>
<p>“It’s a trauma. We’re all going through grief as a result of it,”
said Weber, standing in an empty hen house. “Petaluma is known as the
Egg Basket of the World. It’s devastating to see that egg basket go up
in flames.”</p>
<p>A year after the bird flu led to record egg prices and widespread
shortages, the disease known as highly pathogenic avian influenza is
wreaking havoc in California, which escaped the earlier wave of
outbreaks that devastated poultry farms in the Midwest.</p>
<p>The highly contagious virus has ravaged Sonoma County, where
officials have declared a state of emergency. During the past two
months, nearly a dozen commercial farms have had to destroy more than 1
million birds to control the outbreak, dealing an economic blow to
farmers, workers and their customers.</p>
<p>Merced County in Central California also has been hit hard, with
outbreaks at several large commercial egg-producing farms in recent
weeks.</p>
<p>Experts say bird flu is spread by ducks, geese and other migratory
birds. The waterfowl can carry the virus without getting sick and easily
spread it through their droppings to chicken and turkey farms and
backyard flocks through droppings and nasal discharges.</p>
<p>California poultry farms are implementing strict biosecurity measures
to curb the spread of the disease. State Veterinarian Annette Jones
urged farmers to keep their flocks indoors until June, including organic
chickens that are required to have outdoor access.</p>
<p>“We still have migration going for another couple of months. So we’ve
got to be as vigilant as possible to protect our birds,” said Bill
Mattos, president of the California Poultry Federation.</p>
<p>The loss of local hens led to a spike in egg prices in the San
Francisco Bay Area over the holidays before supermarkets and restaurants
found suppliers from outside the region.</p>
<p>While bird flu has been around for decades, the current outbreak of
the virus that began in early 2022 has prompted officials to slaughter
nearly 82 million birds, mostly egg-laying chickens, in 47 U.S. states,
according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Whenever the disease is
found the entire flock is slaughtered to help limit the spread of the
virus.</p>
<p>The price of a dozen eggs more than doubled to $4.82 at its peak in
January 2023. Egg prices returned to their normal range as egg producers
built up their flocks and outbreaks were controlled. Turkey and chicken
prices also spiked, partly due to the virus.</p>
<p>“I think this is an existential issue for the commercial poultry
industry. The virus is on every continent, except for Australia at this
point,” said Maurice Pitesky, a poultry expert at the University of
California, Davis.</p>
<p>Climate change is increasing the risk of outbreaks as changing
weather patterns disrupt the migratory patterns of wild birds, Pitesky
said. For example, exceptional rainfall last year created new waterfowl
habitat throughout California, including areas close to poultry
farms.</p>
<p>In California, the outbreak has impacted more than 7 million chickens
in about 40 commercial flocks and 24 backyard flocks, with most of the
outbreaks occurring over the past two months on the North Coast and
Central Valley, according to the USDA.</p>
<p>Industry officials are worried about the growing number of backyard
chickens that could become infected and spread avian flu to commercial
farms.</p>
<p>“We have wild birds that are are full of virus. And if you expose
your birds to these wild birds, they might get infected and ill,” said
Rodrigo Gallardo, a UC Davis researcher who studies avian influenza.</p>
<p>Gallardo advises the owners of backyard chickens to wear clean
clothes and shoes to protect their flocks from getting infected. If an
unusual number of chickens die, they should be tested for avian flu.</p>
<p>Ettamarie Peterson, a retired teacher in Petaluma, has a flock of
about 50 chickens that produce eggs she sells from her backyard barn for
50 cents each.</p>
<p>“I’m very concerned because this avian flu is transmitted by wild
birds, and there’s no way I can stop the wild birds from coming through
and leaving the disease behind,” Peterson said. “If your flock has any
cases of it, you have to destroy the whole flock.”</p>
<p>Sunrise Farms, which was started by Weber’s great-grandparents more
than a century ago, was infected despite putting in place strict
biosecurity measures to protect the flock.</p>
<p>“The virus got to the birds so bad and so quickly you walked in and
the birds were just dead,” Weber said. “Heartbreaking doesn’t describe
how you feel when you walk in and perfectly healthy young birds have
been just laid out.”</p>
<p>After euthanizing more than half a million chickens at Sunrise Farms,
Weber and his employees spent the Christmas holiday discarding the
carcasses. Since then, they’ve been cleaning out and disinfecting the
hen houses.</p>
<p>Weber hopes the farm will get approval from federal regulators to
bring chicks back to the farm this spring. Then it would take another
five months before the hens are mature enough to lay eggs.</p>
<p>He feels lucky that two farms his company co-owns have not been
infected and are still producing eggs for his customers. But recovering
from the outbreak won’t be easy.</p>
<p>“We have a long road ahead,” Weber said. “We’re going to make another
run of it and try to keep this family of employees together because
they’ve worked so hard to build this into the company that it is.”</p>

<p>On January 27, 1838, Abraham Lincoln rose before the Young Men’s
Lyceum in Springfield, Illinois, to make a speech. Just 28 years old,
Lincoln had begun to practice law and had political ambitions. But he
was worried that his generation might not preserve the republic that the
founders had handed to it for transmission to yet another generation. He
took as his topic for that January evening, “The Perpetuation of Our
Political Institutions.”</p>

Returns to South Carolina, Determined to Win Back Black Voters</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>COLUMBIA, South carolina — U.S. President Joe Biden doesn’t need to
worry about his prospects in South Carolina’s Democratic primary next
week. He’s got that locked up. </p>
<p>He also knows he’s not likely to win the solidly red state come
November. South Carolina hasn’t voted for a Democrat since 1976. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, Biden spent the weekend in the state, intent on driving
home two messages: He’s loyal to the state that saved his campaign in
2020 and he’s determined to win back Black voters here and elsewhere who
were central to his election last time but are less enthused this
go-round. </p>
<p>“You’re the reason I am president,” Biden told attendees at the state
party’s fundraising dinner ahead of its first ever “first-in-the-nation”
Democratic primary on February 3. “You’re the reason Kamala Harris is a
historic vice president. And you’re the reason Donald Trump is a
defeated former president. You’re the reason Donald Trump is a loser.
And you’re the reason we’re going to win and beat him again.” </p>
<p>Biden received raved applause and chants of “four more years” from
attendees at the dinner, as he criticized his predecessor’s policies and
highlighted his efforts to support Black Americans. He was set to spend
Sunday in the state where politics and faith are intertwined at a
political event at St. John Baptist Church. </p>
<p>Deputy campaign manager Quentin Fulks said of the primary that
Biden’s team was working to “blow this out of the water” by running up
the score against long shot challengers. The Biden campaign also wants
to learn lessons about activating Black voters — the backbone of the
party — ahead of an expected 2024 rematch with Republican front-runner
Donald Trump. </p>
<p>Challenger invites Biden to pass torch</p>
<p>It was the first time Biden shared a stage with Representative Dean
Phillips, a long-shot challenger for the Democratic nomination, who
called on the president, 81, to step aside for a younger generation of
leaders to take on Trump. </p>
<p>“The numbers do not say things are looking good,” Phillips said of
Biden’s poll numbers. “My invitation to President Biden is to pass the
torch.”</p>
<p>Struggling to hold the attention of the crowd — many of whom were
holding Biden campaign signs ahead of the president’s appearance —
Phillips repeatedly asked the audience to quiet down and listen to
him.</p>
<p>Phillips told The Associated Press he did not interact with Biden at
the event, saying of Biden’s staff, “No. I don’t think they want him to
see me.” </p>
<p>Supporters talk up accomplishments</p>
<p>Ahead of the dinner, Biden stopped into Regal Lounge Men’s Barber
&amp; Spa in Columbia, greeting, owners, employees and customers
mid-haircut at the barbershop. </p>
<p>The president has been getting mixed reviews from some Black voters
in the state that came through for him in 2020, including discontent
over his failure to deliver on voting rights legislation and other
issues. </p>
<p>Last year, at the outset of Biden’s reelection bid, conflicting views
among the same South Carolina Democratic voters whose support had been
so crucial to his nomination provided an early warning sign of the
challenges he faces as he tries to revive his diverse winning coalition
from 2020. </p>
<p>Overall, just half of Black adults said they approved of Biden in a
December poll by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs.
That is compared with 86% in July 2021, a shift that is generating
concern about the president’s reelection prospects. </p>
<p>APVoteCast, an extensive national survey of the electorate, also
found that support for Republican candidates ticked up slightly among
Black voters during the 2022 midterm elections, although Black voters
overwhelmingly supported Democrats. </p>
<p>The Biden campaign is running TV ads in South Carolina highlighting
Biden initiatives that it hopes will boost enthusiasm among Black
voters. </p>
<p>“On his first day in office with a country in crisis, President Biden
got to work — for us,” the ad states. “Cutting Black child poverty in
half, more money for Black entrepreneurs, millions of new good-paying
jobs and he lowered the cost of prescription drugs.” </p>
<p>The campaign is spending more than $270,000 on the ads through the
primary, according to tracking data. The Democratic National Committee
also launched a six-figure ad campaign across South Carolina and Nevada,
which is next on the Democratic primary calendar, to boost enthusiasm
for Biden among Black and Latino voters. And first lady Jill Biden was
in the state on Friday evening to rally voters. </p>
<p>Biden’s campaign has also hired staff in South Carolina to organize
ahead of the primary and through the general election, although for
nearly 50 years the state has picked a Republican for president. </p>
<p>‘We know Joe…Joe knows us’</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a pro-Biden super PAC, Unite the Country, is airing an ad
featuring Democratic Representative Jim Clyburn of South Carolina
ticking through what he says are major Biden accomplishments such as
reducing student loan debt and cutting insulin costs for older
people. </p>
<p>It was Clyburn’s 2020 endorsement of his longtime friend Biden that
helped the then-candidate score a thundering win in South Carolina’s
presidential primary. </p>
<p>In the new advertisement, Clyburn references his late wife, Emily,
who influenced his 2020 endorsement of Biden. She said that “if we
wanted to win the presidency, we better nominate Joe Biden,” Clyburn
says in the ad. “She was right then, and she’s still right today.” </p>
<p>Clyburn greeted Biden at the airport and accompanied him throughout
his visit. </p>
<p>While Trump has seen slightly improving levels of support among Black
and Latino voters, Biden’s team is more concerned that a lack of
enthusiasm for Biden will depress turnout among voters who are pivotal
to the Democratic coalition. </p>
<p>Biden’s team is using South Carolina as a proving ground, tracking
which messages and platforms break through with voters. </p>
<p>South Carolina, where Black voters make up a majority of the
Democratic electorate, is now the first meaningful contest in the
Democratic presidential race after the party reworked the party’s
nominating calendar at Biden’s call. Leading off with Iowa and New
Hampshire had long drawn criticism because the states are less diverse
than the rest of the country. </p>
<p>A co-chairman of Biden’s reelection campaign, Clyburn has remained
one of the president’s most stalwart advocates in Congress, as well as
in his home state. </p>
<p>Frequently, he reminds people of the same message he delivered in his
2020 endorsement: “We know Joe, and Joe knows us.” </p>
<p>Biden’s decision to campaign in the state “helps solidify South
Carolina’s place as the first in the nation primary moving forward,”
said Biden campaign communications director Michael Tyler. </p>
<p>It also provides Biden an opportunity to re-engage with Black voters
who have connections that extend beyond South Carolina. </p>
<p>“Obviously the diaspora is strong, familial ties are strong with
other key swing states in the area like Georgia and North Carolina,”
Tyler said. </p>
<p>This is Biden’s second trip to South Carolina this month. He spoke
earlier in the month at the pulpit of Mother Emanuel AME Church in
Charleston, where nine Black parishioners were shot to death in 2015 by
a white stranger they had invited to join their Bible study.</p>

<h2 id="us-appeals-for-contributions-to-haiti-security-mission">US
Appeals for Contributions to Haiti Security Mission</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The United States on Saturday appealed for urgent
support for a U.N.-backed law-and-order mission to Haiti, which has been
thrown into doubt after a Kenyan court ruled against Nairobi’s plan to
send its police to the gang-plagued nation.</p>
<p>“The United States’ commitment to the Haitian people remains
unwavering,” State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a
statement.</p>
<p>“We reaffirm our support of ongoing international efforts to deploy a
Multinational Security Support mission for Haiti… and renew our calls
for the international community to urgently provide support for this
mission.”</p>
<p>Kenya had been meant to lead the mission but a High Court judge on
Friday ruled that sending police to Haiti “contravenes the constitution
and the law and is therefore unconstitutional, illegal and invalid.”</p>
<p>The Kenyan government has vowed to challenge the decision, a move
noted by Miller in his statement.</p>
<p>Nairobi had previously said it was ready to provide up to 1,000
personnel — an offer welcomed by the United States and other nations
that had ruled out putting their own forces on the ground.</p>
<p>“It is urgent that the international community respond to the
unprecedented levels of gang violence and destabilizing forces preying
upon the Haitian people,” Miller said.</p>
<p>“At the same time, we call for the restoration of democratic order
through an inclusive political process in Haiti,” he said, adding that
the “only legitimate path to long-term peace and stability is through
free and fair elections.”</p>
<p>Haiti, the Western hemisphere’s poorest nation, has been in turmoil
for years, with armed gangs taking over parts of the country and
unleashing brutal violence, leaving the economy and public health system
in tatters.</p>
<p>The 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moise plunged the country
further into chaos. No elections have taken place since 2016 and the
presidency remains vacant.</p>
<p>Haiti’s foreign minister pleaded Thursday for the deployment plans to
be accelerated, telling the U.N. Security Council that gang violence in
the country was as barbaric as the horrors experienced in war zones.</p>

id="tiny11-creates-a-100mb-version-of-windows-11-by-axing-the-windows">Tiny11
creates a 100MB version of Windows 11 by axing the windows</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>If you know your Windows history, you’ll know that the operating
system got that name when it moved away from using pure MS-DOS and
started using a graphical user interface to show things. As it turns
out, you can force Windows 11 back to its legacy roots and reduce it
back to a command-line interface. This is what the developer of Tiny11
has achieved, calling their new creation “Minwin.” The developer of
Win11, NTDev, posted a video on YouTube about their project. There’s
absolutely nothing flashy here; no Copilot, no Start menu, and
definitely no UI. It’s as graphically complex as the Command Prompt,
which meant that NTDev had to resort to fancy 00s-era ASCII logos to
announce that Minwin was working. ↫ Simon Batt at XDA Definitely a neat
proof-of-concept, and it shows just how modular Windows could be if only
Microsoft allowed its users to take out the parts they don’t need. I
wonder how close this is to Nano Server, an installation option for
Windows Server you’ve probably never heard of. I also like the nod to
MinWin, the informal codename Microsoft used internally to refer to an
effort by a small number of expert Windows kernel engineers to untangle
the spaghetti ball of dependencies that had sprouted between the various
architectural layers of Windows. This project started around Vista, and
eventually made it possible to make broader, sweeping changes to Windows
without breaking things all over the place because the spaghetti ball of
internal, low-level dependencies wasn’t mapped out.</p>

<p>Another month, another pile of improvement to Servo, the rendering
engine written in Rust, originally a Mozilla project. This month the
proof-of-concept browser UI got forward and backward buttons, making
this bare-bones UI just a tiny bit more usable. Of course, the vast
majority of changes and improvements are all focused on the actual
rendering engine, which makes sense because Servo definitely isn’t ready
for any prime time use – nor is anyone claiming it is. I’m incredibly
curious to see where Servo goes in the future.</p>

About Barman
</h3>
<p>
Backup and Recovery Manager (or Barman) is an open-source administration
tool for remote backups and disaster recovery of PostgreSQL servers in
business-critical environments. It relies on PostgreSQL’s robust and
reliable Point-In-Time Recovery technology, allowing DBAs to remotely
manage a complete catalog of backups and the recovery phase of multiple
remote servers – all from one location. Barman is distributed under GNU
GPL 3 and maintained by <a href="https://www.enterprisedb.com">EDB</a>.
