<h2 id="berlin-school">Berlin School</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-29, from: Alex Schroeder‚Äôs Blog</p>
<h1>
Berlin School
</h1>
<p>
I‚Äôm listening to
<a href="https://yt.cdaut.de/watch?v=BE8rMsM3zLs">Berlin Schoool: An
Uncomplicated Approach</a> by Synth Seeker because
<a class="account" href="https://social.sdf.org/@phf" title="@phf@social.sdf.org"><span
class="citation" data-cites="phf">@phf</span></a> recommended it.
</p>
<p>
We were talking about music. All I do is create small jingles for my
podcast but every now and then I wonder about music theory. A while ago
I had saved <a href="https://yewtu.be/watch?v=rgaTLrZGlk0">Learn music
theory in half an hour</a> by Andrew Huang to get back to it. But all I
had done about it was think to myself: Pick a scale, like this one, B
Major looks nice, OK, so full full half full full full half, that‚Äôs
these keys, OK, let me doodle around on these ‚Ä¶ beep beep boop boop ‚Ä¶
here we go. Or maybe do the other one, full full full half full full
half ‚Ä¶ biep biep boup boup ‚Ä¶ all right! ü•≥
</p>
<p>
But then I wonder: what would my next step be? Some days I look at the
circle of fifth and wonder if that‚Äôs hogwash. Non-European music doesn‚Äôt
need it! But then again, they also use <em>something</em>. There are
rules because people figured out what generally ‚Äúworks‚Äù. Well, on the
other hand there are books about many things and they are neither a
replacement for spending ten thousand hours practising and the rules
they espouse are often just there to get you started and then they are
immediately broken.
</p>
<p>
All I know when I look at a typical drum machine or tracker setup with
<sup>8</sup>‚ÅÑ<sub>8</sub> or similar I immediately want to do a
<a href="https://babayagamusic.com/Music/nine-eight-rhythms.htm"><sup>9</sup>‚ÅÑ<sub>8</sub>
Karsilama</a> or something like that. My wife‚Äôs oriental dancing and all
the Turkish, Arab, Iranian and Maghreb music we listened to must have
left an impression‚Ä¶ Or confused the hell out of me, depending on your
perspective. Or mine.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, writing all of this and I‚Äôm still not making music. What next, I
wonder. Perhaps playing C Major and playing a bunch of notes it shares
with another scale and then continuing with that scale is cool. Or maybe
not. I don‚Äôt know. Or just stay in that scale and do some drum machine
and patterns below that!
</p>
<p>
That Synth Seeker video had a link to a
<a href="https://www.hooktheory.com/cheat-sheet">Key Cheat Sheet
Index</a>. The effect is similar to picking scales in Garage Band or
Animoog: limiting the keys I use in order to stay in that scale. Works
for me!
</p>
<p>
All this listening and writing makes me realize that it‚Äôs Sunday, late
at night, I should go to bed, and then I‚Äôll be working and playing
role-playing games and war-games every evening until the next week-end
comes around. Whaaat!
</p>
<p>
I must find time between the things I do to do the other things.
</p>
<p>
This is my life.

We had already been friends for a few years then. By total coincidence
we were both offered writing gigs at the then-new
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_(magazine)#History">Wired</a>,
Dave as the Fetish columnist, where he wrote about all the latest tech
gadgetry, which was a perfect assignment for him, because Dave is one of
the most tech-literate people you‚Äôll ever meet. Also an avid bike rider,
Deadhead, and later a receiver of donated kidneys, and a pioneer of the
technology for matching kidney donors with recipients. He has saved a
lot of lives with his software. And he‚Äôs still with us, against all
odds.
</p>
<p>
Just chatted with him last night during the Niners game. The only
football team I‚Äôve ever loved, from back in the Joe Montana days.
</p>
<p>
I was offered a column to basically write whatever I wanted to write
about, although by default I was supposed to write about the world wide
web, which was then as new as ChatGPT is today and every bit as
exciting. You can find our respective columns somewhere I hope on the
web.

<h1>
VASL Templates
</h1>
<p>
I‚Äôm trying to get <a href="https://vasl-templates.org/">VASL
Templates</a> to run on my laptop so that I can create nice setups for
Advanced Squad Leader. As it turns out, I have to use <code>pipx</code>
because that automatically creates virtual environments for me, as far
as I understand.
</p>
<pre><code>cd src
git clone https://code.pacman-ghost.com/public/vasl-templates.git
cd vasl-templates
pipx install .
</code></pre>
<p>
As it turns out, this is not enough:
</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;/home/alex/.local/bin/vasl-templates&quot;, line 5, in &lt;module&gt;
    from vasl_templates.main import main
  File &quot;/home/alex/.local/pipx/venvs/vasl-templates/lib/python3.11/site-packages/vasl_templates/main.py&quot;, line 19, in &lt;module&gt;
    import PyQt5.QtWebEngineWidgets
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'PyQt5'
</code></pre>
<p>
So now you need to install PyQt5 into the virtual environment used by
vasl-templates:
</p>
<pre><code>pipx inject vasl-templates PyQt5
</code></pre>
<p>
Next error:
</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;/home/alex/.local/bin/vasl-templates&quot;, line 5, in &lt;module&gt;
    from vasl_templates.main import main
  File &quot;/home/alex/.local/pipx/venvs/vasl-templates/lib/python3.11/site-packages/vasl_templates/main.py&quot;, line 19, in &lt;module&gt;
    import PyQt5.QtWebEngineWidgets
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'PyQt5.QtWebEngineWidgets'
</code></pre>
<p>
Fix:
</p>
<pre><code>pipx inject vasl-templates PyQtWebEngine
</code></pre>
<p>
And now it works at last! üòÖ

<p>date: 2024-01-29, from: Miek Giebin blog</p>
<p>After many years of playing with YAML in k8s, I‚Äôve returned to using
CFEngine. The last config management software before that was Puppet. An
issue I see with all modern config management tooling is the lack of
monitoring and the impossibility to cleanly roll back. In k8s it works
better, but that‚Äôs only for pods running in k8s, not the underlying
machines. I want something that: works on a plain Debian machine has
sane monitoring support rollbacks (is written in Go) What If?</p>

<li>EU climate chief warns against ‚Äòfalse narrative‚Äô that climate action
and business interests are at odds
</h3>
<p>
The European Union‚Äôs climate commissioner, Wopke Hoekstra, said that the
energy transition will mean a ‚Äúheavy change‚Äù for industries on the
continent but warned against the ‚Äúfalse narrative‚Äù that climate action
comes at the cost of business and innovation, <em>The Financial
Times</em>
<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a5c5b266-788a-4f2f-a5b2-5e27e54e3855" target="_blank">reported</a>
Monday. Hoekstra‚Äôs comments came ahead of an intended proposal by
Brussels that the EU cut emissions by 90% of 1990 levels by 2040.
</p>
<p>
While the aggressive proposition would need to be agreed upon by EU
governments before becoming law, environmental regulations have already
rankled farmers in Germany, Poland, Romania, Belgium, and France ‚Äî where

policies and industrialists have blamed ‚Äúred tape‚Äù for holding up
innovation. ‚ÄúWe need to stand on two legs: one leg is climate action,
the other leg is the just transition, competitiveness, and a thriving
business community, because both are needed,‚Äù Hoekstra said.

<li>Chicago faces uphill battle to ban gas from new construction

<p>
Last week, Chicago Mayor Mayor Brandon introduced an ordinance that
would ban natural gas for cooking and heating in most new construction.

like Berkeley, California, which has been unable to enforce its version
of a gas ban after a federal appeals court ruled the city doesn‚Äôt have

Chicagoland comes from nuclear energy (which doesn‚Äôt emit carbon) and,
ironically enough, gas (which does),‚Äù the op-ed authors pointed out.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not economically feasible to build new nuclear plants at present,

Does everything actually suck right now? Or is it just the end of
January?
</p>
<p>
It can be difficult to tell. We‚Äôre officially in the thick of what
Americans consider to be the
<a href="https://today.yougov.com/society/articles/45312-americans-favorite-and-least-favorite-months-year" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">worst

salutation and feeling ‚Äúblah‚Äù is the basic condition of being alive.
Even setting aside seasonal affective disorder ‚Äî a condition linked to

<a href="https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-environment-watch/michigan-winters-are-super-cloudy-and-getting-worse-heres-how-deal" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">directly
affected</a> by climate change ‚Äî
<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/17456916231178695" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">studies
have shown</a> that people have a lower quality diet in the winter, and
body weight usually reaches its peak this time of year. Physical
activity, which is also important for mental health, dips as the weather
gets worse, and research has even shown that people with Alzheimer‚Äôs
disease experience more severe symptoms when the planet is tilted away
from the sun.
</p>
<p>
Some have taken these winter blues as an opportunity to question the
basic premise that climate change is bad. ‚ÄúThe chief benefits of global
warming‚Äù include ‚Äúfewer winter deaths‚Äù and lower heating bills, Matt
Ridley
<a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/why-climate-change-is-good-for-the-world/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">argued</a>
in <em>The Spectator </em>in 2013. Former President Donald Trump even
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/01/its-cold-so-trump-is-doubting-climate-change/580885/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has
a quasi-annual tradition</a> of tweeting something like <em>‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt be
bad to have a little of that good old fashioned Global Warming right
now!‚Äù </em>during cold snaps this time of year.
</p>
<p>
Winter is, in fact, warming
<a href="https://heatmap.news/what-is-winter-anymore" target="_self">faster
than any other season</a> in the United States, with some parts of the
country on track to lose over a month of freezing days as soon as 2050.
Even if you do believe ‚Äî correctly ‚Äî that climate change is a global
catastrophe, unless you‚Äôre
<a href="https://heatmap.news/lifestyle/ski-snowboard-season-snow-climate-change" target="_self">a
skier or snowboarder</a>, this might sound like a good thing. So, as
sacrilegious as it feels to ask, <em>could</em> a warmer planet make us
healthier in the wintertime?
</p>
<p>
When I asked Leslie Davenport, a climate psychology educator at the
California Institute of Integral Studies, if she expected milder winters
to impact people psychologically, she answered immediately. ‚ÄúOh, one
hundred percent!,‚Äù she told me. That doesn‚Äôt mean she thinks the impact
will be positive. She said she has heard people ‚Äúwho are a little more
on the climate denial end of things‚Äù make comments like ‚Äúthis is great,
it used to be so cold and now I can go golfing,‚Äù she told me, but ‚ÄúI
can‚Äôt honestly call that an upside.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Far more often, Davenport said she hears from people experiencing a
sense of ‚Äúunsettling‚Äù as they notice winter isn‚Äôt as cold or as snowy as
they remember it being. Some might even express a feeling of
‚Äúsolastalgia,‚Äù a neologism that describes the sense of displacement or
nostalgia that arises when a place changes environmentally. ‚ÄúWhether
it‚Äôs the loss of snow, or areas that are drier or hotter or wetter, it
is like, ‚ÄòWell, this is not the town I grew up in or the place I chose
to move to because it has changed so much,‚Äô‚Äù Davenport said.
</p>
<p>
While there might be an abstract appeal to the Los Angelesification of
winter nationwide, it would be a mistake to count on climate change
making the season ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù Quite the opposite, actually ‚Äî warmer
winters could make winter much <em>worse</em>, especially for those
living in midlatitude cities like New York, London, or Amsterdam. ‚ÄúI
have observed, in my travels and my research and in talking to people,
that it is often much easier and more pleasant to cope with winter
weather that is slightly below freezing consistently than weather that
is slightly above freezing consistently,‚Äù Kari Leibowitz, a health
psychologist who is working on a book about
<a href="https://www.karileibowitz.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">winter
mindsets</a>, told me.
</p>
<p>
Cold temperatures can actually improve our lives in several ways,
Leibowitz argued. For one thing, snowfall ‚Äúopens up a whole bunch of
winter opportunities‚Äù like sledding, snowmobiling, snowshoeing, and all
those winter sports that get people out of the house. That helps combat
some of the bluesiness that otherwise comes from moping around indoors
when it‚Äôs too gray and rainy to do anything active. Frozen lakes offer
opportunities for skating and hockey, plus ‚Äúthere‚Äôs also a lot of beauty
and intrigue in ice ‚Äî you know, icicles and frozen rainstorms,‚Äù
Leibowitz went on.
</p>
<p>
Snow, meanwhile, ‚Äúreflects the light, so it makes the darkness of winter
feel much, much brighter,‚Äù Leibowitz said. ‚ÄúAnd most people think it‚Äôs
really beautiful ‚Äî it‚Äôs clean and fresh and it smells good.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Of course, winter weather can be dangerous, too, but ‚Äúplaces that are
colder and have really frozen winters have good infrastructure for
dealing with that, and houses tend to be better insulated and heated
more efficiently,‚Äù Leibowitz said. Bad winter weather can also give us
much-needed
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2020/02/why-adults-still-love-snow-days/606481/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">permission
to rest</a>.
</p>
<p>
While there are certain places further in the south, such as Atlanta,
where winter might genuinely become more pleasant as the planet warms,
‚Äúthere are far more places where the end of winter is just going to mean
places are dark and wet,‚Äù without the upsides that come with the snow
and freezing temperatures, Leibowitz stressed.
</p>
<p>
Michael Varnum, the head of the Culture and Ecology Laboratory at
Arizona State University and a specialist in
<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/17456916231178695" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">seasonal
psychology</a>, did find one positive. ‚ÄúNobody likes to feel down, or to
look at their waistline and see it‚Äôs grown,‚Äù he told me. ‚ÄúSo
potentially, there could be some upsides there.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Naturally, much of how you feel about winter will depend on the climate
where you live. In general, though, ‚Äúwe are somewhat more insulated from
the changes in temperature that come with the seasons than we were, say,
10,000 years ago or even a couple hundred years ago,‚Äù Varnum said.
Feelings of climate anxiety and distress tend to be highest in
Indigenous communities in or near the Arctic, where the cold weather is
a part of cultural identity and inheritance. Likewise, Davenport told
me, in ‚Äúplaces where there tends to be a lot of snow‚Äù like Japan or
Finland, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs talk about things like ‚Äòwinter grief,‚Äô‚Äù where a milder
winter makes it so that ‚Äúcertain rituals or holidays that have been
planned in the past can‚Äôt happen anymore or as consistently.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Many Americans, too,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/fifth-national-climate-assessment-america" target="_self">lose
a sense of themselves</a> when winter gets milder. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs what a lot of
us love about living here: our winters,‚Äù Erich Osterberg, a Dartmouth
climate scientist,
<a href="https://newhampshirebulletin.com/2022/01/06/losing-winter-and-big-chunks-of-new-hampshires-identity/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told
<em>The New Hampshire Bulletin</em></a> in 2022. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs more than changes
to the climate,‚Äù he added, ‚Äúit‚Äôs changes to our livelihood and our
culture.‚Äù I encountered similar comments from Minnesotans when I was
looking into how an unseasonably dry winter is imperiling this year‚Äôs
cross country ski season: ‚ÄúSpiritually, this is terrible,‚Äù Claire
Wilson, the executive director of Minneapolis‚Äô Loppet Foundation,
recently
<a href="https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-climate-change-warm-winter-december-2023-laura-yuen-sven-sundgaard-world-cup-loppet/600332632/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told
the <em>Star Tribune</em></a>.
</p>
<p>
Winter doesn‚Äôt have to be dreaded, Leibowitz said ‚Äî much of one‚Äôs
enjoyment of the season comes down to
<a href="https://www.karileibowitz.com/winter-mindset" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mindset</a>.
But it does seem to matter that winter is actually, well,
<em>wintery</em>, too. Whether that‚Äôs a question of our evolutionary
seasonal biology (winter appears to be an important trigger for
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/12/12/winter-mood-sex-concentration-diet/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the
human reproductive cycle</a>, for one thing), or a matter of our
cultural practices, or something as simple as snow being more fun than
rain, it‚Äôs hard to make the case that warming winters will leave us
better off.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIf you want me to find the psychological upside of anything, I could
maybe do it,‚Äù Leibowitz confessed. She added, though, that ‚Äúa lot of
people think, ‚ÄòI hate winter, I hate the cold, I would be happy if it
was warmer all year round.‚Äô But people underestimate how much there is
to be lost in losing winter.‚Äù

I assure you, an AI didn‚Äôt write a terrible ‚ÄúGeorge Carlin‚Äù routine (29
Jan 2024)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-29, from: Cory Doctorow‚Äôs blog</p>
<p>Today‚Äôs links I assure you, an AI didn‚Äôt write a terrible ‚ÄúGeorge
Carlin‚Äù routine: The Mechanical Turk would like to have a word with all
of us. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history:
2004, 2009, 2014, 2019, 2023 Colophon: Recent publications,
upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading I
assure you, an AI didn‚Äôt write a terrible ‚ÄúGeorge Carlin‚Äù routine
(permalink) On Hallowe‚Äôen 1974, Ronald Clark O‚ÄôBryan murdered his son
with poisoned candy. He needed the insurance money, and he knew that
Halloween poisonings were rampant, so he figured he‚Äôd get away with it.
He was wrong: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Clark_O%27Bryan The
stories of Hallowe‚Äôen poisonings were just that ‚Äì stories. No one was
poisoning kids on Hallowe‚Äôen ‚Äì except this monstrous murderer, who
mistook rampant scare stories for truth and assumed (incorrectly) that
his murder would blend in with the crowd. Last week, the dudes behind
the ‚Äúcomedy‚Äù podcast Dudesy released a ‚ÄúGeorge Carlin‚Äù comedy special
that they claimed had been created, holus bolus, by an AI trained on the
comedian‚Äôs routines. This was a lie. After the Carlin estate sued, the
dudes admitted that they had written the (remarkably unfunny) ‚Äúcomedy‚Äù
special:
https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/01/george-carlins-heirs-sue-comedy-podcast-over-ai-generated-impression/
As I‚Äôve written, we‚Äôre nowhere near the point where an AI can do your
job, but we‚Äôre well past the point where your boss can be suckered into
firing you and replacing you with a bot that fails at doing your job:
https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/15/passive-income-brainworms/#four-hour-work-week
AI systems can do some remarkable party tricks, but there‚Äôs a huge
difference between producing a plausible sentence and a good one. After
the initial rush of astonishment, the stench of botshit becomes
unmistakable:
https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/03/botshit-generative-ai-imminent-threat-democracy
Some of this botshit comes from people who are sold a bill of goods:
they‚Äôre convinced that they can make a George Carlin special without any
human intervention and when the bot fails, they manufacture their own
botshit, assuming they must be bad at prompting the AI. This is an old
technology story: I had a friend who was contracted to livestream a
Canadian awards show in the earliest days of the web. They booked in
multiple ISDN lines from Bell Canada and set up an impressive Mbone
encoding station on the wings of the stage. Only one problem: the ISDNs
flaked (this was a common problem with ISDNs!). There was no way to
livecast the show. Nevertheless, my friend‚Äôs boss‚Äôs ordered him to go on
pretending to livestream the show. They made a big deal of it, with all
kinds of cool visualizers showing the progress of this futuristic
marvel, which the cameras frequently lingered on, accompanied by
overheated narration from the show‚Äôs hosts. The weirdest part? The next
day, my friend ‚Äì and many others ‚Äì heard from satisfied viewers who
boasted about how amazing it had been to watch this show on their
computers, rather than their TVs. Remember: there had been no stream.
These people had just assumed that the problem was on their end ‚Äì that
they had failed to correctly install and configure the multiple browser
plugins required. Not wanting to admit their technical incompetence,
they instead boasted about how great the show had been. It was the
Emperor‚Äôs New Livestream. Perhaps that‚Äôs what happened to the Dudesy
bros. But there‚Äôs another possibility: maybe they were captured by their
own imaginations. In ‚ÄúGenesis,‚Äù an essay in the 2007 collection The
Creationists, EL Doctorow (no relation) describes how the ancient
Babylonians were so poleaxed by the strange wonder of the story they
made up about the origin of the universe that they assumed that it must
be true. They themselves weren‚Äôt nearly imaginative enough to have come
up with this super-cool tale, so God must have put it in their minds:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/29/gedankenexperimentwahn/#high-on-your-own-supply
That seems to have been what happened to the Air Force colonel who
falsely claimed that a ‚Äúrogue AI-powered drone‚Äù had spontaneously
evolved the strategy of killing its operator as a way of clearing the
obstacle to its main objective, which was killing the enemy:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/06/04/ayyyyyy-eyeeeee/ This never happened.
It was ‚Äì in the chagrined colonel‚Äôs words ‚Äì a ‚Äúthought experiment.‚Äù In
other words, this guy ‚Äì who is the USAF‚Äôs Chief of AI Test and
Operations ‚Äì was so excited about his own made up story that he forgot
it wasn‚Äôt true and told a whole conference-room full of people that it
had actually happened. Maybe that‚Äôs what happened with the George
Carlinbot 3000: the Dudesy dudes fell in love with their own vision for
a fully automated luxury Carlinbot and forgot that they had made it up,
so they just cheated, assuming they would eventually be able to make a
fully operational Battle Carlinbot. That‚Äôs basically the Theranos story:
a teenaged ‚Äúentrepreneur‚Äù was convinced that she was just about to
produce a seemingly impossible, revolutionary diagnostic machine, so she
faked its results, abetted by investors, customers and others who wanted
to believe: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos The thing about
stories of AI miracles is that they are peddled by both AI‚Äôs boosters
and its critics. For boosters, the value of these tall tales is obvious:
if normies can be convinced that AI is capable of performing miracles,
they‚Äôll invest in it. They‚Äôll even integrate it into their product
offerings and then quietly hire legions of humans to pick up the botshit
it leaves behind. These abettors can be relied upon to keep the defects
in these products a secret, because they‚Äôll assume that they‚Äôve
committed an operator error. After all, everyone knows that AI can do
anything, so if it‚Äôs not performing for them, the problem must exist
between the keyboard and the chair. But this would only take AI so far.
It‚Äôs one thing to hear implausible stories of AI‚Äôs triumph from the
people invested in it ‚Äì but what about when AI‚Äôs critics repeat those
stories? If your boss thinks an AI can do your job, and AI critics are
all running around with their hair on fire, shouting about the coming AI
jobpocalypse, then maybe the AI really can do your job?
https://locusmag.com/2020/07/cory-doctorow-full-employment/ There‚Äôs a
name for this kind of criticism: ‚Äúcriti-hype,‚Äù coined by Lee Vinsel, who
points to many reasons for its persistence, including the fact that it
constitutes an ‚Äúacademic business-model‚Äù:
https://sts-news.medium.com/youre-doing-it-wrong-notes-on-criticism-and-technology-hype-18b08b4307e5
That‚Äôs four reasons: for AI hype: I. to win investors and customers; II.
to cover customers‚Äô and users‚Äô embarrassment when the AI doesn‚Äôt
perform; III. AI dreamers so high on their own supply that they can‚Äôt
tell truth from fantasy; IV. A business-model for doomsayers who form an
unholy alliance with AI companies by parroting their silliest hype in
warning form. But there‚Äôs a fifth motivation for criti-hype: to simplify
otherwise tedious and complex situations. As Jamie Zawinski writes, this
is the motivation behind the obvious lie that the ‚Äúautonomous cars‚Äù on
the streets of San Francisco have no driver:
https://www.jwz.org/blog/2024/01/driverless-cars-always-have-a-driver/
GM‚Äôs Cruise division was forced to shutter its SF operations after one
of its ‚Äúself-driving‚Äù cars dragged an injured pedestrian for 20 feet:
https://www.wired.com/story/cruise-robotaxi-self-driving-permit-revoked-california/
One of the widely discussed revelations in the wake of the incident was
that Cruise employed 1.5 skilled technical remote overseers for every
one of its ‚Äúself-driving‚Äù cars. In other words, they had replaced a
single low-waged cab driver with 1.5 higher-paid remote operators. As
Zawinski writes, SFPD is well aware that there‚Äôs a human being (or more
than one human being) responsible for every one of these cars ‚Äì someone
who is formally at fault when the cars injure people or damage property.
Nevertheless, SFPD and SFMTA maintain that these cars can‚Äôt be cited for
moving violations because ‚Äúno one is driving them.‚Äù But figuring out who
which person is responsible for a moving violation is ‚Äúcomplicated and
annoying to deal with,‚Äù so the fiction persists. (Zawinski notes that
even when these people are held responsible, they‚Äôre a ‚Äúmoral crumple
zone‚Äù for the company that decided to enroll whole cities in
nonconsensual murderbot experiments.) Automation hype has always
involved hidden humans. The most famous of these was the ‚Äúmechanical
Turk‚Äù hoax: a supposed chess-playing robot that was just a puppet
operated by a concealed human operator wedged awkwardly into its
carapace. This pattern repeats itself through the ages. Thomas Jefferson
‚Äúreplaced his slaves‚Äù with dumbwaiters ‚Äì but of course, dumbwaiters
don‚Äôt replace slaves, they hide slaves:
https://www.stuartmcmillen.com/blog/behind-the-dumbwaiter/ The modern
Mechanical Turk ‚Äì a division of Amazon that employs low-waged
‚Äúclickworkers,‚Äù many of them overseas ‚Äì modernizes the dumbwaiter by
hiding low-waged workforces behind a veneer of automation. The MTurk is
an abstract ‚Äúcloud‚Äù of human intelligence (the tasks MTurks perform are
called ‚ÄúHITs,‚Äù which stands for ‚ÄúHuman Intelligence Tasks‚Äù). This is
such a truism that techies in India joke that ‚ÄúAI‚Äù stands for ‚Äúabsent
Indians.‚Äù Or, to use Jathan Sadowski‚Äôs wonderful term: ‚ÄúPotemkin AI‚Äù:
https://reallifemag.com/potemkin-ai/ This Potemkin AI is everywhere you
look. When Tesla unveiled its humanoid robot Optimus, they made a big
flashy show of it, promising a $20,000 automaton was just on the
horizon. They failed to mention that Optimus was just a person in a
robot suit:
https://www.siliconrepublic.com/machines/elon-musk-tesla-robot-optimus-ai
Likewise with the famous demo of a ‚Äúfull self-driving‚Äù Tesla, which
turned out to be a canned fake:
https://www.reuters.com/technology/tesla-video-promoting-self-driving-was-staged-engineer-testifies-2023-01-17/
The most shocking and terrifying and enraging AI demos keep turning out
to be ‚ÄúJust A Guy‚Äù (in Molly White‚Äôs excellent parlance):
https://twitter.com/molly0xFFF/status/1751670561606971895 And yet, we
keep falling for it. It‚Äôs no wonder, really: criti-hype rewards so many
different people in so many different ways that it truly offers
something for everyone. (Image: Cryteria, CC BY 3.0; Ross Breadmore, CC

There have been almost-daily drone and missile strikes on U.S. forces in
Iraq and Syria since the October 7 attack on Israel by Iran-backed
Hamas. The U.S. has blamed Iran-backed militant groups for the attack,

Election Officials to Consider Striking Trump‚Äôs Name off Primary
Ballot</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CHICAGO ‚Äî¬†Former President Donald Trump should be removed from
Illinois‚Äô primary ballot, but the decision should be left to the courts,
a retired judge recommended Sunday to the state‚Äôs election board,
arguing that it was clear Trump engaged in insurrection in the Jan.¬†6,
2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.</p>
<p>The Illinois State Board of Elections is expected to consider the
recommendation Tuesday. Attorneys for Trump and citizens seeking to keep
the Republican former president off the ballot presented their arguments
Friday before the hearing officer, Clark Erickson. The retired longtime
Kankakee County judge is a Republican.</p>
<p>The Illinois effort to keep Trump off the March ballot is similar to
those filed in several other states. The U.S. Supreme Court is set to
hear arguments next month in a historic Colorado Supreme Court ruling to
remove Trump from that state‚Äôs ballot. The case presents the high court
with its first look at a provision of the 14th Amendment barring some
people who ‚Äúengaged in insurrection‚Äù from holding public office.</p>
<p>Erickson‚Äôs 21-page recommendation concluded that a ‚Äúpreponderance of
the evidence‚Äù presented proves that Trump engaged in insurrection.</p>
<p>But he said the election board can‚Äôt engage in the ‚Äúsignificant and
sophisticated constitutional analysis‚Äù required to remove Trump‚Äôs name
before the March 19 primary.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAll in all, attempting to resolve a constitutional issue within the
expedited schedule of an election board hearing is somewhat akin to
scheduling a two-minute round between heavyweight boxers in a telephone
booth,‚Äù he wrote.</p>
<p>Still, Erickson noted that even if the board disagrees with his
reasoning, Trump‚Äôs name should be removed from the Illinois primary
ballot.</p>
<p>The election board is split evenly between four Democrats and four
Republicans.</p>
<p>Free Speech for People, which is leading the Illinois ballot effort,
praised the recommendation from the Republican retired judge as
‚Äúsignificant‚Äù but argued that Illinois law allows the board to make the
ballot decision.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe expect that the board and ultimately Illinois courts will uphold
Judge Erickson‚Äôs thoughtful analysis of why Trump is disqualified from
office, but ‚Äî with the greatest respect ‚Äî correct him on why Illinois
law authorizes that ruling,‚Äù Ron Fein, legal director for the group,
wrote in a Sunday statement.</p>
<p>Trump‚Äôs campaign did not immediately return a message left
Sunday.</p>

Republicans Release Impeachment Articles Against Homeland Security
Secretary Mayorkas</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington ‚Äî¬†House Republicans on Sunday released two articles of
impeachment against Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas as
they vowed to swiftly push forward with election-year efforts to oust
him over what they call his failure to manage the U.S.-Mexico border.
The rare step against a Cabinet member drew outrage from Democrats and
the agency as a politically motivated stunt lacking the constitutional
basis to remove Mayorkas from office.</p>
<p>Republicans contend Mayorkas is guilty of ‚Äúhigh crimes and
misdemeanors‚Äù that amount to a ‚Äúwillful and systemic refusal to comply
with the law‚Äù on immigration and a ‚Äúbreach of the public trust.‚Äù
Impeachment, they say, is ‚ÄúCongress‚Äôs only viable option.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúAlejandro N. Mayorkas willfully and systemically refused to comply
with the immigration laws, failed to control the border to the detriment
of national security, compromised public safety, and violated the rule
of law and separation of powers in the Constitution, to the manifest
injury of the people of the United States,‚Äù the impeachment resolution
says.</p>
<p>Only once in American history has a Cabinet secretary been impeached:
William Belknap, President Ulysses Grant‚Äôs war secretary, in 1876, over
kickbacks in government contracts. Going after an official for a policy
dispute, in this instance over the claim that Mayorkas is not upholding
immigration laws, is unprecedented.</p>
<p>Ever since taking control of the House in 2023, Republicans have
pushed to impeach Mayorkas. Sunday‚Äôs announcement comes as their other
impeachment drive ‚Äî to impeach Democratic President Joe Biden in
relation to his son Hunter‚Äôs business dealings ‚Äî has struggled to
advance.</p>
<p>But Republicans have moved with rapid speed against Mayorkas after a
series of hearings in recent weeks. It all comes at a time when border
security and immigration are key issues in the 2024 campaign and as
Donald Trump, the front-runner for the Republican presidential
nomination, is promising to launch the ‚Äúlargest deportation operation‚Äù
in U.S. history if he returns to the White House.</p>
<p>The Republican-controlled House Homeland Security Committee is set to
vote Tuesday on the articles of impeachment, aiming to send them to the
full House for consideration. Republican Speaker Mike Johnson has said
the House will move forward as soon as possible with a vote after
that.</p>
<p>Passage requires only a House majority. The Senate would hold a
trial, and a two-thirds vote is required for conviction, an exceedingly
unlikely outcome in the Democratic-run Senate.</p>
<p>The Republican push also comes at a curious time for Mayorkas.</p>
<p>Even as the House is taking steps to try to remove him from office,
Mayorkas has been engaged in arduous negotiations with senators seeking
to reach a bipartisan deal on border policy. He has won praise from
senators for his engagement in the process.</p>
<p>Democrats have lambasted the impeachment proceedings, calling them a
waste of time when lawmakers should be working together to solve the
problems. They also say Republicans are part of the problems at the
border, with Republicans attacking Mayorkas even as they have failed to
give his department the tools it needs to manage the situation.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt want to fix the problem; they want to campaign on it.
That‚Äôs why they have undermined efforts to achieve bipartisan solutions
and ignored the facts, legal scholars and experts, and even the
Constitution itself in their quest to baselessly impeach Secretary
Mayorkas,‚Äù the department said in a statement Sunday.</p>
<p>Rep.¬†Bennie Thompson, the top Democrat on the House committee, said
the Republican resolution did not have ‚Äúa shred of evidence of high
crimes or misdemeanors ‚Äî the Constitutional standard for
impeachment.‚Äù¬†</p>
<p>The two articles mark the culmination of a roughly yearlong
examination by Republicans of the secretary‚Äôs handling of the border and
what they describe as a crisis of the administration‚Äôs own making.
Republicans contend that the administration and Mayorkas specifically
either got rid of policies in place under Trump that had controlled
migration or enacted policies of their own that encouraged migrants from
around the world to come to the U.S. illegally via the southern border.
They also accused Mayorkas of lying to Congress, pointing to comments
about the border being secure or about vetting of Afghans airlifted to
the U.S.</p>
<p>They cite growing numbers of migrants who have at times overwhelmed
the capacity of Customs and Border Protection authorities to care for
and process them. Arrests for illegal crossings topped 2 million in each
of the U.S. government‚Äôs past two budget years. In December, arrests for
illegal border crossings from Mexico reached an all-time high since
figures have been released. The backlog of people in immigration court
has grown by 1 million over the past budget year.</p>
<p>In the articles, Republicans argue that Mayorkas is deliberately
violating immigration laws passed by Congress, such as those requiring
detention of migrants, and that through his policies, a crisis has
arisen at the border. They accuse him of releasing migrants without
effective ways to make sure they show up for court or are removed from
the country. They cited an Immigration and Customs Enforcement memo
written by Mayorkas that sets priorities for whom the agency should
target for enforcement proceedings as proof that he is letting people
stay in the country who don‚Äôt have the right to do so.</p>
<p>They also attacked the administration‚Äôs use of the humanitarian
parole authority, which allows the DHS secretary to admit certain
migrants into the country. Republicans said the Biden administration has
essentially created a mass parole program that bypasses Congress. They
cited cities such as New York that have struggled with high numbers of
migrants, taxing housing and education systems, as proof of the
financial costs immigration is taking.</p>
<p>Democrats, as well as Mayorkas, have argued that it‚Äôs not the
administration‚Äôs policies that are causing people to attempt to migrate
to America but that the movement is part of a global mass migration of
people fleeing wars, economic instability and political repression.</p>

waterfront this weekend as a flotilla of boats arrived for the city‚Äôs
annual Gasparilla Pirate Fest.</p>
<p>Led by Ye Mystic Krewe of Gasparilla, the invading pirates docked to
make a final demand for the key to the city. Once ashore, the
festivities celebrating their annual invasion included a Saturday
afternoon parade through downtown and live music and bead throwing that
lasted well into the night.</p>
<p>A fixture nearly every year since 1904, the Gasparilla Pirate Fest is
named for the mythical pirate Jose Gaspar. There‚Äôs not much evidence he
actually existed, but according to legend he plundered ships and
captured hostages in the Gulf of Mexico from the 1780s until around
1821.</p>
<p>The colorful account of his supposed life first surfaced in the early
1900s in an advertising brochure for the Gasparilla Inn, which was
located south of Tampa in Boca Grande at the end of a rail line and in
need of an exciting promotion to lure in guests.</p>
<p>Called the ‚ÄúLast of the Buccaneers,‚Äù Gaspar‚Äôs memory lives on in the
name of Tampa Bay‚Äôs NFL team.</p>

<h2 id="us-china-to-resume-stalled-fentanyl-talks-in-beijing">US, China
to Resume Stalled Fentanyl Talks in Beijing</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington ‚Äî¬†U.S. and Chinese officials will meet in Beijing Tuesday
for their first talks in years to stem the production of ingredients for
the drug fentanyl, senior Biden administration officials said.</p>
<p>The meeting of the counternarcotics working group comes after Chinese
President Xi Jinping pledged during a summit with U.S. President Joe
Biden in November to clamp down on the trade.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFor years bilateral cooperation between the United States and the
People‚Äôs Republic of China on counternarcotics has been suspended which
has hindered our progress,‚Äù a U.S. official said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBut that changed during the November 15 meeting,‚Äù the official told
reporters on the condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>Washington hopes to get China to cooperate on tackling companies that
manufacture the precursor chemicals to make fentanyl, a synthetic opioid
many times more powerful than heroin, and on cutting financing for the
trade.</p>
<p>Fentanyl has caused an epidemic of addiction in the United States,
with 100,000 overdose deaths a year, making it the leading cause of
death of people aged 18 to 49, the official said.</p>
<p>Since the summit China has shut down one company, blocked some
international payments and resumed sharing information on shipments and
trafficking, added the official.</p>
<p>The meeting, featuring U.S. justice, homeland security, diplomatic
and counternarcotics officials, will focus on ‚Äúongoing coordination to
support concrete enforcement actions.‚Äù</p>
<p>Xi said after meeting Biden in California in November that China
‚Äúdeeply sympathizes‚Äù with victims of fentanyl.</p>
<p>China and the United States have been trying to stabilize relations
after years of tensions with Beijing‚Äôs top diplomat Wang Yi and U.S.
national security adviser Jake Sullivan meeting in Bangkok this past
week.</p>
<p>Another senior U.S. official said after those talks that cooperation
on fentanyl between the two countries ‚Äúneeds to be continuous and
ongoing. It‚Äôs not just one snapshot in time.‚Äù</p>

Orleans Thief Steals 7 King Cakes From Bakery in Very Mardi Gras
Way</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New Orleans, Louisiana ‚Äî¬†With their purple, gold and green colors and
toy babies hidden inside, king cakes are staples of Mardi Gras
celebrations in New Orleans, but apparently they‚Äôre also valuable enough
to steal ‚Äî at least this time of year during the Carnival season.</p>
<p>A thief stole seven king cakes ‚Äî about as many as he could carry ‚Äî
during a break-in last week at a New Orleans bakery. The thief also took
cash and a case of vodka from Bittersweet Confections last Wednesday,
according to the New Orleans Police Department.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOur king cakes are just that good,‚Äù the bakery wrote on social
media. ‚ÄúBut please come and purchase one during our regular store
hours.‚Äù</p>
<p>While it‚Äôs a secular celebration, Carnival in New Orleans ‚Äî and
around the world ‚Äî is strongly linked to Christian and Roman Catholic
traditions. The season begins on Jan.¬†6, the 12th day after Christmas,
and continues until Mardi Gras, known as Fat Tuesday, which is the final
day of feasting, drinking and revelry before Ash Wednesday and the
fasting associated with Lent.</p>
<p>King cakes are among the foods most associated with Carnival in New
Orleans. The rings of pastry are adorned with purple, green and gold
sugar or icing, and they often have a tiny plastic baby hidden inside as
a prize.</p>
<p>One wisecracker responded to the bakery‚Äôs social media post with a
tongue-in-cheek false admission that he was the thief.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt was me. ‚Ä¶I‚Äôm holding all seven babies hostage until I get a
lifetime supply of King Cakes from you every year,‚Äù the man posted.</p>

Newspaper to Relaunch Print Edition After Theft Forced It to Lay Off Its
Staff</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Portland, Oregon ‚Äî¬†An Oregon weekly newspaper that had to lay off its
entire staff after its funds were embezzled by a former employee will
relaunch its print edition next month, its editor said, a move made
possible in large part by fundraising campaigns and community
contributions.</p>
<p>The Eugene Weekly will return to newsstands on Feb.¬†8 with roughly
25,000 copies, about six weeks after the embezzlement forced the
decades-old publication to halt its print edition, editor Camilla
Mortensen said Saturday.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt has been both terrifying and wonderful,‚Äù Mortensen told The
Associated Press, describing the emotional rollercoaster of the last few
weeks. ‚ÄúI thought it was hard to run a paper. It‚Äôs much harder to
resurrect a paper.‚Äù</p>
<p>The alternative weekly, founded in 1982 and distributed for free in
Eugene, one of the largest cities in Oregon, had to lay off its entire
10-person staff right before Christmas. It was around that time that the
paper became aware of at least $100,000 in unpaid bills and discovered
that a now-former employee who had been involved with the paper‚Äôs
finances had used its bank account to pay themselves around $90,000,
Mortensen said.</p>
<p>Additionally, multiple employees, including Mortensen, realized that
money from their paychecks that was supposed to be going into retirement
accounts was never deposited.</p>
<p>The accused employee was fired after the embezzlement came to
light.</p>
<p>The news was a devastating blow to a publication that serves as an
important source of information in a community that, like many others
nationwide, is struggling with growing gaps in local news coverage.</p>
<p>The Eugene police department‚Äôs investigation is still ongoing, and
forensic accountants hired by the paper are continuing to piece together
what happened.</p>
<p>Local Eugene news outlets KEZI and KLCC were among the first to
report the weekly‚Äôs return to print.</p>
<p>Since the layoffs, some former staff members have continued to
volunteer their time to help keep the paper‚Äôs website up and running.
Much of the online content published in recent weeks has been work from
journalism students at the University of Oregon, located in Eugene, and
from freelancers who offered to submit stories for free ‚Äî ‚Äúthe
journalistic equivalent of pro bono,‚Äù Mortensen said.</p>
<p>Some former employees had to find other jobs in order to make ends
meet. But Mortensen hopes to eventually rehire her staff once the paper
pays its outstanding bills and becomes more financially sustainable.</p>
<p>The paper has raised roughly $150,000 since December, Mortensen said.
The majority of the money came from an online GoFundMe campaign, but
financial support also came from local businesses, artists and readers.
The paper even received checks from people living as far away as Iowa
and New York after news outlets across the country picked up the
story.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPeople were so invested in helping us that it just really gives me
hope for journalism at a time where I think a lot of people don‚Äôt have
hope,‚Äù she told the AP. ‚ÄúWhen we saw how many people contributed and how
many people continue to offer to help, you can‚Äôt not try to print the
paper. You‚Äôve got to give it a shot.‚Äù</p>
<p>The paper aims to continue weekly printing beyond Feb.¬†8.</p>

<p><span
class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Resizing
macOS app windows for 16:9 screen capture</span></p>
<pre><code>        &lt;div class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I frequently need to capture a window of some Mac app for a recording (usually for my YouTube channel), and I&#39;ve used a little AppleScript I wrote years ago for the purpose.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
Somehow, that script (which I saved as a ‚Äòone shot‚Äô App
(<code>.app</code> extension) that just runs then quits) got deleted off
my Script Editor folder in my iCloud Drive, so I had to re-create it.
</p>
<p>
Luckily, the syntax for this operation is dead simple:
</p>
<pre><code>tell application "Safari"
    set bounds of front window to {0, 50, 1280, 770}
end tell
</code></pre>
<p>
You can adjust the <code>{X, Y, width, height}</code> parameters
accordingly‚Äînote that the width and height seem to be additive to the
X/Y. So I use 770 instead of 720 for the height (720 + 50).
</p>
<p>
In <code>Script Editor</code>, save the file as a <code>.app</code>,
with the option to keep it running unchecked. Now, whenever you want a
window sized perfectly for capture, just press Command + Spacebar, then
type in the name of the Script/App you saved, and hit enter. The
top-most window in Safari will scale to exactly 720p resolution.

<h2 id="morning-chatgpt-notes">Morning ChatGPT Notes</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-28, from: Dave Winer‚Äôs Scripting News</p>
<p>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2017/09/04/peterRojas.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I
spent a couple of days putting together a JSON text editor in a modal
dialog for a project I‚Äôm working on. I‚Äôm combining the
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/aceEditorDemo">Ace editor</a> with
the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap toolkit</a>. I‚Äôve used
both components before, but never together. And they‚Äôre always a bit
tricky to get working because I‚Äôm impatient and the docs are spread out,
and there are different versions. It‚Äôs all kind of a mess, so you just
get it working and move on, never quite sure why it works, and I rarely
end up with reusable code. But it‚Äôs certainly a lot better than starting
from scratch, which basically is impossible, given the depth of the two
components. After spinning my wheels a bit, I did what I always do in
2024, I turned to ChatGPT, outlined the problem, and asked if it knew of
any sample code, which it proceeded to write for me, in about two
seconds (not kidding about that). I copied their code and pasted it into
my editor and ran it. It worked. Then I went through a number of
iterations, restructuring the code to meet my needs, each time checking
with ChatGPT, asking what it thought of my code. And of course there
were problems, for example at one point there were two vertical
scrollbars, and each time we worked <i>together</i> to figure out the
problem and the fix. In the end, I have a solid editor that works
exactly as I want it to, and best of all, I understand how it works.
Here‚Äôs the
<a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/840e8159-9988-4159-8289-5167d6fb78c8">transcript
of the work</a> I did with it, over more than 24 hours, a few different
sessions.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôll try to remember when this code ships as part of a product, to link
to this perspective.
</p>
<p>
Next up, I‚Äôd like to get it to understand my coding conventions, so when
it shares code with me it can save me the step of having to convert its
conventions to mine. In other words, I‚Äôd like to return the favor. It‚Äôs
doing a great job of teaching and coaching me. I‚Äôd like to teach it how
to do that better, so we work better together over time. And perhaps it
can teach human programmers what I‚Äôve learned about programming in over
50 years of doing this work.
</p>
<p>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2017/09/05/enjoyEveryDay.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">A
bit of philosophy. People say these things aren‚Äôt intelligent, but
seriously, if I can engage with it as if it were intelligent, far more
intelligent in ways than I am, what‚Äôs the difference between that and
actually being intelligent? I know from a lifetime of dealing with
supposedly intelligent humans, and being one myself, how rarely we focus
on the idea that the person we‚Äôre conversing with has an inner life
that‚Äôs vastly different from ours and no less complex, and
contradictory. We tend to think of others as being like us, or like
someone who raised us. Always in a movie, never in the moment. So why is
it interesting that ChatGPT is a machine? These are questions thinkers
and writers have been pondering for decades if not centuries, but ‚Äì
<i>now we‚Äôre living it.</i> I‚Äôm so happy to have made it this far! An
amazing experience, so much learning in so little time. I don‚Äôt
understand how people can sit on the sidelines and not want to be the
first to try all this stuff out, to be part of its evolution. I feel so
lucky.
</p>
<p>
A puzzling thing, in the transcripts I‚Äôm identified as ‚Äúanonymous,‚Äù but
I am logged in. It must know my name. I bet this is some kind of setting
which defaults to anonymous, to play it safe.
</p>
<p>
One more thing. I copied and pasted the text above into ChatGPT.
<a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/5fe361cd-1fca-4e8d-82cc-920514e8c4b8">Here
are its comments</a>. A funny thing about ChatGPT is that you can‚Äôt ask
it how to use ChatGPT itself. It doesn‚Äôt know about the chat UI?
</p>
<p>
Yet another thing. I remember my father, when he was forced to retire by
illness, said how fortunate he was that the internet was there, so he
could be involved in the world even though he had stopped working. He
said his father would have loved it, and I don‚Äôt doubt that he would.
Same with ChatGPT. My parents and uncles were always looking up stuff,
wanting to understand how things worked. This is a whole new level. The
machines are now far better at collaborating over the net than humans
are. Where will that take us? Maybe this is something else we can learn
from the machines.

Seltos SX Turbo AWD subcompact SUV</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-28, from: San Jose Mercury News</p>
<p>What is a Seltos? A Seltos is a subcompact SUV built in the Gwangju,
Korea assembly plant and sold worldwide by Kia. This very popular
subcompact SUV class has many competitors and the Kia Seltos goes head
to head with crossovers like the Honda HR-V, Subaru Crosstrek and the
Toyota Corolla Cross. Small crossovers, also known as subcompact SUVs,
are a type of sport utility vehicle that are smaller in size and have a
more fuel efficient design that gets better gas mileage than all the
larger SUVs.</p>

<p>I was reminiscing recently about songs that are close to my heart. So

<p>date: 2024-01-28, from: Alex Schroeder‚Äôs Blog</p>
<h1>
Drivethru, I am unhappy!
</h1>
<p>
The DrivethruRPG website so depends on shit that it loads from other
domains that I cannot log in no matter how many exceptions I add to
uBlock Origin, Privacy Badger, or the Firefox content blocking
preferences. And with every second I spend doing this, I resent them
more. And when I finally start Chromium to try and connect, I‚Äôm already
ranting as I sit at my laptop. And then I get Connection timed out from
cloudflare and really‚Ä¶ I feel like they don‚Äôt want my money. Uuuugh.
</p>
<p>
I used their contact form. When I hit the submit button I was greeted by
a white page. I don‚Äôt know if they go an email. (I did try the next day
from a phone and that worked ‚Äì which sort of illustrates the point.)
</p>
<p>
Here‚Äôs what I wrote:
</p>
<p>
I think in a world where big tech is tracking us, where everybody and
their uncle is spying on us, it is only natural that people start
locking down their browser. I have uBlock Origin and Privacy Badger
installed and I tell all my browsers to do as much content blocking as
they can, I delete all cookies when I close the browser. It‚Äôs the right
thing to do. It is all the more galling when a website such as Drivethru
becomes practically unusable as a consequence of me trying to do the
right thing. It feels as if Drivethru is betraying me to the big tech
corporations, helping them spy on me. It‚Äôs a revolting feeling. These
days, I have it every time I remember to use an unprotected Chromium
browser just to log into Drivethru. Every single time I wish for an
alternative. Every single time I hope that itch.io and other competitors
end up replacing you.
</p>
<p>
If only you had a simple, straight forward website, served your own
Javascript, had no tracking, and allowed me to browse stuff and buy it.
I don‚Äôt really expect an answer to this email. It just feels unfair to
rant on social media about the situation without telling you about it.
</p>
<p>
I hope Drivethru improves. I really do. I believe that change is
possible and I hope that you do, too.

Sees Signs of Progress on Deal to Release Israeli Hostages, Pause
War</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON ‚Äî¬†U.S. negotiators are making progress on a potential
agreement under which Israel would pause military operations against
Hamas in Gaza for two months in exchange for the release of more than
100 hostages who were captured in the October 7 attack on Israel,
according to two senior administration officials.</p>
<p>The officials, who requested anonymity to discuss the sensitive
negotiations, said Saturday that emerging terms of the yet-to-be sealed
deal would play out over two phases.</p>
<p>In the first phase, fighting would stop to allow for the remaining
women, elderly and wounded hostages to be released by Hamas.</p>
<p>Israel and Hamas would then aim to work out details during the first
30 days of the pause for a second phase in which Israeli soldiers and
civilian men would be released. The emerging deal also calls for Israel
to allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza.</p>
<p>While the proposed deal would not end the war, U.S. officials are
hopeful that such an agreement could lay the groundwork for a durable
resolution to the conflict.</p>
<p>The New York Times first reported on Saturday that progress has been
made towards an agreement for a pause in fighting in exchange for the
remaining hostages.</p>
<p>CIA director Bill Burns is expected to discuss the contours of the
emerging agreement when he meets on Sunday in France with David Barnea,
the head of Israel‚Äôs Mossad intelligence agency, Qatari Prime Minister
Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, and Egyptian intelligence chief Abbas
Kamel for talks centered on the hostage negotiations, according to three
people familiar with the scheduled meeting who were not authorized to
comment publicly.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden on Friday spoke by phone with Egyptian President
Abdel Fattah el-Sissi and Qatar‚Äôs ruling emir, Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad
Al-Thani. Calls with both leaders focused on the hostage situation.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBoth leaders affirmed that a hostage deal is central to establishing
a prolonged humanitarian pause in the fighting and ensure additional
life-saving humanitarian assistance reaches civilians in need throughout
Gaza,‚Äù the White House said in a statement about Biden‚Äôs call with the
Qatari leader. ‚ÄúThey underscored the urgency of the situation, and
welcomed the close cooperation among their teams to advance recent
discussions.‚Äù</p>
<p>Burns heads to France for the high-level talks after White House
senior adviser Brett McGurk traveled to the Mideast this week for talks
on the hostage situation.</p>
<p>If Burns sees progress in his talks in France, Biden may dispatch
McGurk back to the Mideast quickly to try to complete an agreement.
McGurk during his talks this week was also laying the groundwork for
another trip to the region by Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who
next week could make his fifth trip to the Middle East since the start
of the Israel-Hamas war in October.</p>
<p>The White House and CIA have yet to publicly confirm Burns‚Äô meeting
in France and administration officials have been guarded that a deal can
quickly be brokered.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe should not expect any imminent developments,‚Äù National Security
Council spokesperson John Kirby told reporters on Friday.</p>
<p>Biden and his aides are keenly aware that the mounting Palestinian
death toll, and widespread suffering in Gaza, is frustrating some in his
Democratic base, who want to see him put more pressure on Israel to end
the war. Democrats in Michigan have warned the White House that Biden‚Äôs
handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict could cost him enough support
within the state‚Äôs sizable Arab American community to sway the outcome
of the 2024 election in a state that could be key to whether he wins a
second term.</p>
<p>Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly vowed to
continue the offensive until complete victory over Hamas is
achieved.</p>
<p>Netanyahu has faced increasing pressure from the families of many
hostages who are demanding a deal to win their loved ones‚Äô release.</p>
<p>The October 7 attack killed some 1,200 people in Israel, and Hamas
and other militants abducted around 250 people.</p>
<p>Around 100 hostages were freed under a weeklong cease-fire deal in
November in exchange for the release of Palestinians imprisoned by
Israel. Around 130 remain captive, but a number have since been
confirmed dead.</p>
<p>Hamas has previously said it will free more captives only in exchange
for an end to the war and the release of thousands of Palestinian
prisoners.</p>

Who Performed Nude Sues Museum Over Sexual Assault Claims</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>albany, new york ‚Äî¬†A performer who appeared naked in a show by
world-renowned performance artist Marina Abramovic at New York City‚Äôs
Museum of Modern Art is suing the museum, saying it failed to take
action after he was sexually assaulted multiple times by attendees
during the performances nearly 14 years ago.¬†</p>
<p>The suit was filed in Manhattan on Monday under the New York Adult
Survivors Act, a special state law that created a yearslong suspension
of the usual time limit for accusers to sue. Although the law expired
last year, the suit says the parties agreed to extend the window
closing.¬†</p>
<p>John Bonafede alleges in the suit he was sexually assaulted by five
public onlookers who attended a show he was hired by the museum to
perform in as part of Abramovic‚Äôs retrospective ‚ÄúThe Artist Is
Present.‚Äù¬†</p>
<p>Email messages sent to the museum this week were not returned.
Abramovic is not named as a defendant and did not immediately return a
request for comment.¬†</p>
<p>The work, titled ‚ÄúImponderabilia,‚Äù saw Bonafede and another performer
standing face-to-face with each other in a doorway about 18 inches (45.7
centimeters) apart, fully nude, silent, and still. The exhibition, which
ran from March 14, 2010, through May 31, 2010, was curated by the museum
in a way that encouraged visitors to pass in between the performers as
they went from one gallery to the next, the suit alleges.¬†</p>
<p>Mostly older men involved, says suit</p>
<p>The people who assaulted Bonafede were mostly older men, the suit
says. One of the perpetrators was a corporate member of the museum, who
was ultimately kicked out and revoked of his membership, according to
the suit.¬†</p>
<p>During the final weeks of the exhibition, another attendee
non-consensually groped Bonafede‚Äôs private areas three times before they
were finally stopped by security, the suit said.¬†</p>
<p>Bonafede reported four of the individuals to the museum staff and
security immediately, according to the suit, while the fifth was
witnessed personally by the museum security staff.¬†</p>
<p>Female performer also assaulted, suit says</p>
<p>At one point, Bonafede also witnessed a public attendee sexually
assault his female co-performer by kissing her on the mouth without her
consent, the suit said.¬†</p>
<p>Prior to the exhibition, the performers had voiced their concerns
about nude performers being subject to harassment in a letter to the
museum during contract negotiations, the suit said.¬†</p>
<p>Once it began, several news outlets including The New York Times
reported on the inappropriate behavior by visitors, and the sexual
assaults on ‚ÄúImponderabilia‚Äù were discussed within New York City‚Äôs art
and performance communities, the suit says.¬†</p>
<p>Despite the museum having knowledge of the issue, it failed to take
action to protect the performers and prevent further sexual assaults,
such as telling visitors ahead of time that touching was not allowed,
the lawsuit said.¬†</p>
<p>About a month into the exhibition, the museum created a handbook
outlining protocols for the performers to alert museum staff if they
felt unsafe or were inappropriately touched.¬†</p>
<p>Bonafede agreed to continue the performance after he was assaulted
because of the ‚Äútough it out‚Äù culture of the exhibition, the suit says,
but suffered for years from emotional distress, and his mental health,
body image and career were damaged as a result.¬†</p>
<p>The Associated Press generally does not name people who say they have
been sexually assaulted unless they come forward publicly. Bonafede gave
consent through his lawyer, Jordan Fletcher.¬†</p>
<p>Fletcher declined to comment further on the suit, but said they will
be seeking a jury trial and compensatory damages.</p>

<h2 id="avian-flu-outbreaks-roil-us-poultry-industry">Avian Flu
Outbreaks Roil US Poultry Industry</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PETALUMA, Calif. ‚Äî¬†Last month, Mike Weber got the news every poultry
farmer fears: His chickens tested positive for avian flu.</p>
<p>Following government rules, Weber‚Äôs company, Sunrise Farms, had to
slaughter its entire flock of egg-laying hens ‚Äî 550,000 birds ‚Äî to
prevent the disease from infecting other farms in Sonoma County north of
San Francisco.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a trauma. We‚Äôre all going through grief as a result of it,‚Äù
said Weber, standing in an empty hen house. ‚ÄúPetaluma is known as the
Egg Basket of the World. It‚Äôs devastating to see that egg basket go up
in flames.‚Äù</p>
<p>A year after the bird flu led to record egg prices and widespread
shortages, the disease known as highly pathogenic avian influenza is
wreaking havoc in California, which escaped the earlier wave of
outbreaks that devastated poultry farms in the Midwest.</p>
<p>The highly contagious virus has ravaged Sonoma County, where
officials have declared a state of emergency. During the past two
months, nearly a dozen commercial farms have had to destroy more than 1
million birds to control the outbreak, dealing an economic blow to
farmers, workers and their customers.</p>
<p>Merced County in Central California also has been hit hard, with
outbreaks at several large commercial egg-producing farms in recent
weeks.</p>
<p>Experts say bird flu is spread by ducks, geese and other migratory
birds. The waterfowl can carry the virus without getting sick and easily
spread it through their droppings to chicken and turkey farms and
backyard flocks through droppings and nasal discharges.</p>
<p>California poultry farms are implementing strict biosecurity measures
to curb the spread of the disease. State Veterinarian Annette Jones
urged farmers to keep their flocks indoors until June, including organic
chickens that are required to have outdoor access.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe still have migration going for another couple of months. So we‚Äôve
got to be as vigilant as possible to protect our birds,‚Äù said Bill
Mattos, president of the California Poultry Federation.</p>
<p>The loss of local hens led to a spike in egg prices in the San
Francisco Bay Area over the holidays before supermarkets and restaurants
found suppliers from outside the region.</p>
<p>While bird flu has been around for decades, the current outbreak of
the virus that began in early 2022 has prompted officials to slaughter
nearly 82 million birds, mostly egg-laying chickens, in 47 U.S. states,
according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Whenever the disease is
found the entire flock is slaughtered to help limit the spread of the
virus.</p>
<p>The price of a dozen eggs more than doubled to $4.82 at its peak in
January 2023. Egg prices returned to their normal range as egg producers
built up their flocks and outbreaks were controlled. Turkey and chicken
prices also spiked, partly due to the virus.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI think this is an existential issue for the commercial poultry
industry. The virus is on every continent, except for Australia at this
point,‚Äù said Maurice Pitesky, a poultry expert at the University of
California, Davis.</p>
<p>Climate change is increasing the risk of outbreaks as changing
weather patterns disrupt the migratory patterns of wild birds, Pitesky
said. For example, exceptional rainfall last year created new waterfowl
habitat throughout California, including areas close to poultry
farms.</p>
<p>In California, the outbreak has impacted more than 7 million chickens
in about 40 commercial flocks and 24 backyard flocks, with most of the
outbreaks occurring over the past two months on the North Coast and
Central Valley, according to the USDA.</p>
<p>Industry officials are worried about the growing number of backyard
chickens that could become infected and spread avian flu to commercial
farms.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe have wild birds that are are full of virus. And if you expose
your birds to these wild birds, they might get infected and ill,‚Äù said
Rodrigo Gallardo, a UC Davis researcher who studies avian influenza.</p>
<p>Gallardo advises the owners of backyard chickens to wear clean
clothes and shoes to protect their flocks from getting infected. If an
unusual number of chickens die, they should be tested for avian flu.</p>
<p>Ettamarie Peterson, a retired teacher in Petaluma, has a flock of
about 50 chickens that produce eggs she sells from her backyard barn for
50 cents each.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm very concerned because this avian flu is transmitted by wild
birds, and there‚Äôs no way I can stop the wild birds from coming through
and leaving the disease behind,‚Äù Peterson said. ‚ÄúIf your flock has any
cases of it, you have to destroy the whole flock.‚Äù</p>
<p>Sunrise Farms, which was started by Weber‚Äôs great-grandparents more
than a century ago, was infected despite putting in place strict
biosecurity measures to protect the flock.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe virus got to the birds so bad and so quickly you walked in and
the birds were just dead,‚Äù Weber said. ‚ÄúHeartbreaking doesn‚Äôt describe
how you feel when you walk in and perfectly healthy young birds have
been just laid out.‚Äù</p>
<p>After euthanizing more than half a million chickens at Sunrise Farms,
Weber and his employees spent the Christmas holiday discarding the
carcasses. Since then, they‚Äôve been cleaning out and disinfecting the
hen houses.</p>
<p>Weber hopes the farm will get approval from federal regulators to
bring chicks back to the farm this spring. Then it would take another
five months before the hens are mature enough to lay eggs.</p>
<p>He feels lucky that two farms his company co-owns have not been
infected and are still producing eggs for his customers. But recovering
from the outbreak won‚Äôt be easy.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe have a long road ahead,‚Äù Weber said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to make another
run of it and try to keep this family of employees together because
they‚Äôve worked so hard to build this into the company that it is.‚Äù</p>

Returns to South Carolina, Determined to Win Back Black Voters</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>COLUMBIA, South carolina ‚Äî¬†U.S. President Joe Biden doesn‚Äôt need to
worry about his prospects in South Carolina‚Äôs Democratic primary next
week. He‚Äôs got that locked up.¬†</p>
<p>He also knows he‚Äôs not likely to win the solidly red state come
November. South Carolina hasn‚Äôt voted for a Democrat since 1976.¬†</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Biden spent the weekend in the state, intent on driving
home two messages: He‚Äôs loyal to the state that saved his campaign in
2020 and he‚Äôs determined to win back Black voters here and elsewhere who
were central to his election last time but are less enthused this
go-round.¬†</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the reason I am president,‚Äù Biden told attendees at the state
party‚Äôs fundraising dinner ahead of its first ever ‚Äúfirst-in-the-nation‚Äù
Democratic primary on February 3. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the reason Kamala Harris is a
historic vice president. And you‚Äôre the reason Donald Trump is a
defeated former president. You‚Äôre the reason Donald Trump is a loser.
And you‚Äôre the reason we‚Äôre going to win and beat him again.‚Äù¬†</p>
<p>Biden received raved applause and chants of ‚Äúfour more years‚Äù from
attendees at the dinner, as he criticized his predecessor‚Äôs policies and
highlighted his efforts to support Black Americans. He was set to spend
Sunday in the state where politics and faith are intertwined at a
political event at St.¬†John Baptist Church.¬†</p>
<p>Deputy campaign manager Quentin Fulks said of the primary that
Biden‚Äôs team was working to ‚Äúblow this out of the water‚Äù by running up
the score against long shot challengers. The Biden campaign also wants
to learn lessons about activating Black voters ‚Äî the backbone of the
party ‚Äî ahead of an expected 2024 rematch with Republican front-runner
Donald Trump.¬†</p>
<p>Challenger invites Biden to pass torch</p>
<p>It was the first time Biden shared a stage with Representative Dean
Phillips, a long-shot challenger for the Democratic nomination, who
called on the president, 81, to step aside for a younger generation of
leaders to take on Trump.¬†</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe numbers do not say things are looking good,‚Äù Phillips said of
Biden‚Äôs poll numbers.¬†‚ÄúMy invitation to President Biden is to pass the
torch.‚Äù</p>
<p>Struggling to hold the attention of the crowd ‚Äî many of whom were
holding Biden campaign signs ahead of the president‚Äôs appearance ‚Äî
Phillips repeatedly asked the audience to quiet down and listen to
him.</p>
<p>Phillips told The Associated Press he did not interact with Biden at
the event, saying of Biden‚Äôs staff, ‚ÄúNo.¬†I don‚Äôt think they want him to
see me.‚Äù¬†</p>
<p>Supporters talk up accomplishments</p>
<p>Ahead of the dinner, Biden stopped into Regal Lounge Men‚Äôs Barber
&amp; Spa in Columbia, greeting, owners, employees and customers
mid-haircut at the barbershop.¬†</p>
<p>The president has been getting mixed reviews from some Black voters
in the state that came through for him in 2020, including discontent
over his failure to deliver on voting rights legislation and other
issues.¬†</p>
<p>Last year, at the outset of Biden‚Äôs reelection bid, conflicting views
among the same South Carolina Democratic voters whose support had been
so crucial to his nomination provided an early warning sign of the
challenges he faces as he tries to revive his diverse winning coalition
from 2020.¬†</p>
<p>Overall, just half of Black adults said they approved of Biden in a
December poll by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs.
That is compared with 86% in July 2021, a shift that is generating
concern about the president‚Äôs reelection prospects.¬†</p>
<p>APVoteCast, an extensive national survey of the electorate, also
found that support for Republican candidates ticked up slightly among
Black voters during the 2022 midterm elections, although Black voters
overwhelmingly supported Democrats.¬†</p>
<p>The Biden campaign is running TV ads in South Carolina highlighting
Biden initiatives that it hopes will boost enthusiasm among Black
voters.¬†</p>
<p>‚ÄúOn his first day in office with a country in crisis, President Biden
got to work ‚Äî for us,‚Äù the ad states. ‚ÄúCutting Black child poverty in
half, more money for Black entrepreneurs, millions of new good-paying
jobs and he lowered the cost of prescription drugs.‚Äù¬†</p>
<p>The campaign is spending more than $270,000 on the ads through the
primary, according to tracking data. The Democratic National Committee
also launched a six-figure ad campaign across South Carolina and Nevada,
which is next on the Democratic primary calendar, to boost enthusiasm
for Biden among Black and Latino voters. And first lady Jill Biden was
in the state on Friday evening to rally voters.¬†</p>
<p>Biden‚Äôs campaign has also hired staff in South Carolina to organize
ahead of the primary and through the general election, although for
nearly 50 years the state has picked a Republican for president.¬†</p>
<p>‚ÄòWe know Joe‚Ä¶Joe knows us‚Äô</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a pro-Biden super PAC, Unite the Country, is airing an ad
featuring Democratic Representative Jim Clyburn of South Carolina
ticking through what he says are major Biden accomplishments such as
reducing student loan debt and cutting insulin costs for older
people.¬†</p>
<p>It was Clyburn‚Äôs 2020 endorsement of his longtime friend Biden that
helped the then-candidate score a thundering win in South Carolina‚Äôs
presidential primary.¬†</p>
<p>In the new advertisement, Clyburn references his late wife, Emily,
who influenced his 2020 endorsement of Biden. She said that ‚Äúif we
wanted to win the presidency, we better nominate Joe Biden,‚Äù Clyburn
says in the ad. ‚ÄúShe was right then, and she‚Äôs still right today.‚Äù¬†</p>
<p>Clyburn greeted Biden at the airport and accompanied him throughout
his visit.¬†</p>
<p>While Trump has seen slightly improving levels of support among Black
and Latino voters, Biden‚Äôs team is more concerned that a lack of
enthusiasm for Biden will depress turnout among voters who are pivotal
to the Democratic coalition.¬†</p>
<p>Biden‚Äôs team is using South Carolina as a proving ground, tracking
which messages and platforms break through with voters.¬†</p>
<p>South Carolina, where Black voters make up a majority of the
Democratic electorate, is now the first meaningful contest in the
Democratic presidential race after the party reworked the party‚Äôs
nominating calendar at Biden‚Äôs call. Leading off with Iowa and New
Hampshire had long drawn criticism because the states are less diverse
than the rest of the country.¬†</p>
<p>A co-chairman of Biden‚Äôs reelection campaign, Clyburn has remained
one of the president‚Äôs most stalwart advocates in Congress, as well as
in his home state.¬†</p>
<p>Frequently, he reminds people of the same message he delivered in his
2020 endorsement: ‚ÄúWe know Joe, and Joe knows us.‚Äù¬†</p>
<p>Biden‚Äôs decision to campaign in the state ‚Äúhelps solidify South
Carolina‚Äôs place as the first in the nation primary moving forward,‚Äù
said Biden campaign communications director Michael Tyler.¬†</p>
<p>It also provides Biden an opportunity to re-engage with Black voters
who have connections that extend beyond South Carolina.¬†</p>
<p>‚ÄúObviously the diaspora is strong, familial ties are strong with
other key swing states in the area like Georgia and North Carolina,‚Äù
Tyler said.¬†</p>
<p>This is Biden‚Äôs second trip to South Carolina this month. He spoke
earlier in the month at the pulpit of Mother Emanuel AME Church in
Charleston, where nine Black parishioners were shot to death in 2015 by
a white stranger they had invited to join their Bible study.</p>

Appeals for Contributions to Haiti Security Mission</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington ‚Äî¬†The United States on Saturday appealed for urgent
support for a U.N.-backed law-and-order mission to Haiti, which has been
thrown into doubt after a Kenyan court ruled against Nairobi‚Äôs plan to
send its police to the gang-plagued nation.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe United States‚Äô commitment to the Haitian people remains
unwavering,‚Äù State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a
statement.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe reaffirm our support of ongoing international efforts to deploy a
Multinational Security Support mission for Haiti‚Ä¶ and renew our calls
for the international community to urgently provide support for this
mission.‚Äù</p>
<p>Kenya had been meant to lead the mission but a High Court judge on
Friday ruled that sending police to Haiti ‚Äúcontravenes the constitution
and the law and is therefore unconstitutional, illegal and invalid.‚Äù</p>
<p>The Kenyan government has vowed to challenge the decision, a move
noted by Miller in his statement.</p>
<p>Nairobi had previously said it was ready to provide up to 1,000
personnel ‚Äî an offer welcomed by the United States and other nations
that had ruled out putting their own forces on the ground.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt is urgent that the international community respond to the
unprecedented levels of gang violence and destabilizing forces preying
upon the Haitian people,‚Äù Miller said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAt the same time, we call for the restoration of democratic order
through an inclusive political process in Haiti,‚Äù he said, adding that
the ‚Äúonly legitimate path to long-term peace and stability is through
free and fair elections.‚Äù</p>
<p>Haiti, the Western hemisphere‚Äôs poorest nation, has been in turmoil
for years, with armed gangs taking over parts of the country and
unleashing brutal violence, leaving the economy and public health system
in tatters.</p>
<p>The 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moise plunged the country
further into chaos. No elections have taken place since 2016 and the
presidency remains vacant.</p>
<p>Haiti‚Äôs foreign minister pleaded Thursday for the deployment plans to
be accelerated, telling the U.N. Security Council that gang violence in
the country was as barbaric as the horrors experienced in war zones.</p>

creates a 100MB version of Windows 11 by axing the windows</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>If you know your Windows history, you‚Äôll know that the operating
system got that name when it moved away from using pure MS-DOS and
started using a graphical user interface to show things. As it turns
out, you can force Windows 11 back to its legacy roots and reduce it
back to a command-line interface. This is what the developer of Tiny11
has achieved, calling their new creation ‚ÄúMinwin.‚Äù The developer of
Win11, NTDev, posted a video on YouTube about their project. There‚Äôs
absolutely nothing flashy here; no Copilot, no Start menu, and
definitely no UI. It‚Äôs as graphically complex as the Command Prompt,
which meant that NTDev had to resort to fancy 00s-era ASCII logos to
announce that Minwin was working. ‚Ü´ Simon Batt at XDA Definitely a neat
proof-of-concept, and it shows just how modular Windows could be if only
Microsoft allowed its users to take out the parts they don‚Äôt need. I
wonder how close this is to Nano Server, an installation option for
Windows Server you‚Äôve probably never heard of. I also like the nod to
MinWin, the informal codename Microsoft used internally to refer to an
effort by a small number of expert Windows kernel engineers to untangle
the spaghetti ball of dependencies that had sprouted between the various
architectural layers of Windows. This project started around Vista, and
eventually made it possible to make broader, sweeping changes to Windows
without breaking things all over the place because the spaghetti ball of
internal, low-level dependencies wasn‚Äôt mapped out.</p>

months in Servo: better inline layout, stable Rust, and more</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>Another month, another pile of improvement to Servo, the rendering
engine written in Rust, originally a Mozilla project. This month the
proof-of-concept browser UI got forward and backward buttons, making
this bare-bones UI just a tiny bit more usable. Of course, the vast
majority of changes and improvements are all focused on the actual
rendering engine, which makes sense because Servo definitely isn‚Äôt ready
for any prime time use ‚Äì nor is anyone claiming it is. I‚Äôm incredibly
curious to see where Servo goes in the future.</p>
