<h2 id="us-regulators-urge-congress-to-look-into-grocery-profits">US
Regulators Urge Congress to Look Into Grocery Profits</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — The U.S. Federal Trade Commission recommended Thursday
that policymakers look further into profits at grocery stores that
remain elevated since the pandemic and promotions that consumer products
makers offer retailers.</p>
<p>The FTC also is suing to block Kroger’s acquisition of smaller
grocery store rival Albertsons, citing concerns the deal would hike
prices for millions of Americans.</p>
<p>The FTC launched the study in 2021 when it ordered Walmart, Kroger,
Procter &amp; Gamble, grocery wholesalers and others to turn over
detailed information relating to the supply chain crisis during the
pandemic, which contributed to double-digit price increases on household
necessities.</p>
<p>Big box and chain stores secured limited resources, leaving small
independent grocers at a disadvantage, FTC Chairperson Lina Khan said on
a public call to discuss the report. This harmed communities reliant on
these smaller retailers and could have also strengthened market
dominance of larger corporations, she added.</p>
<p>“If we end up finding that these types of practices violated any of
the antitrust laws including the [Robinson-] Patman act, I’ll be very
interested in making sure we take swift action,” she said without
providing details.</p>
<p>The Robinson-Patman Act of 1936 is a U.S. antitrust law preventing
large franchises and chains from engaging in price discrimination
against small businesses.</p>
<p>Several representatives of smaller grocery operators spoke on the
call saying that during the pandemic, they faced shortages of toilet
paper, cleaning products and pet supplies as manufacturers prioritized
their biggest clients.</p>
<p>“It was a true test of survival for a lot of our customers,” said
Brian Patterson, head buyer at Piggly Wiggly Alabama Distributing
Co.</p>
<p>Walmart and Kroger are among chains that have touted gaining U.S.
grocery market share. Kroger’s most recent quarterly statements said it
improved volume share consistently for the past five quarters. Walmart
said it gained market share in “virtually every category,” citing its
lower prices.</p>
<p>Walmart and Kroger did grow share from 2018 to 2022, but only
modestly, according to Coresight Research data.</p>
<p>The FTC said it will pass the report onto lawmakers, “where there has
been broad interest” from members of both parties.</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden has taken aim at grocery chains this
year.</p>
<p>“Today’s FTC report shows grocery retailers increased profits during
the pandemic and have maintained or increased those margins even as
their own costs have come down,” the White House said in an email to
Reuters on Thursday.</p>
<p>In Thursday’s report, the FTC found that a measure of annual profits
for food and beverage retailers “rose substantially and remains quite
elevated.” The commission said revenues for grocery retailers were 6%
over total costs in 2021, and 7% in the first nine months of 2023,
higher than a peak of 5.6% in 2015.</p>
<p>“This casts doubt on assertions that rising prices at the grocery
store are simply moving in lockstep with retailers’ own rising costs,”
the FTC said, adding that elevated profit levels “warrant further
inquiry” by both policymakers and the commission, which is tasked with
protecting the public from unfair business practices.</p>
<p>The FTC also said trade promotions, payments by consumer goods
companies to retailers for favorable product placement in stores and on
e-commerce websites, “may warrant further study.”</p>
<p>The reduction in spending harmed traditional grocers that use a
“high-low” pricing strategy with more frequent promotions, the FTC
found.</p>
<p>Retailers that offer “everyday low pricing” with fewer promotions,
like Walmart, benefited, according to the study.</p>
<p>Walmart did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>The FTC added that the report does not make claims of illegality.</p>
<p>“We’re shedding light on what we’re seeing in the market, which has
broader relevance to policymakers beyond law enforcement.”</p>

id="fafsa-delays-prompt-california-to-extend-deadline-for-financial-aid-applications">FAFSA
Delays Prompt California to Extend Deadline for Financial Aid
Applications</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Sacramento, California — The California Legislature on Thursday voted
to give prospective college students more time to apply for two of the
state’s largest financial aid programs after a glitch in the federal
government’s application system threatened to block up to 100,000 people
from getting help.</p>
<p>California had already extended the deadline for its financial aid
programs from March 2 to April 2. On Thursday, the state Senate gave
final approval to a bill that would extend it again until May 2. The
bill now heads to Governor Gavin Newsom.</p>
<p>“Clearly, our students need our help,” Assemblymember Sabrina
Cervantes, a Democrat from Riverside who authored the bill, told
lawmakers during a public hearing earlier this week.</p>
<p>California has multiple programs to help people pay for college. The
biggest is the Cal Grant program, which gives money to people who meet
certain income requirements. The state also has a Middle Class
Scholarship for people with slightly higher incomes.</p>
<p>Students can apply for these state aid programs only if they first
complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, commonly known as
FAFSA.</p>
<p>This year, a computer glitch prevented parents from filling out the
form if they did not have a Social Security number. That meant many
students who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents but whose parents
are not were blocked from completing the form and thus could not apply
for California’s aid programs.</p>
<p>California has a large population of adults who are living in the
country without legal permission. The California Student Aid Commission,
the state agency in charge of California’s financial aid programs,
estimates as many as 100,000 students could be affected by this
glitch.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Education says it fixed the problem last week,
but those families are now a step behind. Democrats in Congress raised
alarms last month, noting that the delay could particularly hurt
students in states where financial aid is awarded on a first-come,
first-served basis, including Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri, Oregon and
Texas.</p>
<p>Advocates fear that the chaos of this year’s process could deter
students from going to college at all, especially those for whom
finances are a key part of the decision.</p>
<p>The computer glitch is just one part of larger problems affecting
FAFSA.</p>
<p>The notoriously time-consuming form was overhauled in 2020 through a
bipartisan bill in Congress. It promised to simplify the form, going
from 100 questions to fewer than 40, and it also changed the underlying
formula for student aid, promising to expand it to more low-income
students.</p>
<p>But the update has been marred by delays, leaving families across the
country in limbo as they figure out how much college will cost.</p>
<p>The form is typically available to fill out in October, but the
Education Department didn’t have it ready until late December. Even
then, the agency wasn’t ready to begin processing the forms and sending
them to states and colleges, which only started to happen this
month.</p>
<p>The problems appear to have already reduced California’s application
numbers. Through March 8, the number of California students who had
completed FAFSA was 43% lower than it was at the same time last
year.</p>
<p>“The data most concerning me seems to suggest that these drops are
more acute at the schools that serve low-income students or large
populations of students of color,” Jake Brymner, deputy chief of policy
and public affairs for the California Student Aid Commission, told
lawmakers in a public hearing earlier this week.</p>
<p>The issue has caused problems for colleges and universities, too. The
University of California and California State University systems both
delayed their admissions deadlines because so many prospective students
were having trouble with FAFSA.</p>

nevertheless looming possibility of a second Trump administration.
</p>
<p>
Though climate advocates and environmental groups have celebrated the
EPA’s rules for pushing the country closer to its net zero goals (while
also
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/epa-rules-biden" target="_self">lamenting</a>
that the rules didn’t go as far as planned), threats have been mounting.
Perhaps none is more concerning than Trump’s potential return to the
White House with
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-climate-change-project-2025" target="_self">the
Project 2025 playbook</a> in hand. The Heritage Foundation-authored
blueprint for a Republican president explicitly describes dismantling
the EPA and singles out as a priority reviewing “the existing ‘ramp
rate’ for car standards to ensure that it is actually achievable.”
</p>
<p>
When Trump last took office, he replaced, eliminated, or otherwise undid
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/climate-environment/trump-climate-environment-protections/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more
than 100 environmental rules</a>, including
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/30/climate/trump-fuel-economy.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Obama-era
vehicle emissions standards</a>. When I spoke to environmental lawyers
at the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Environmental Defense
Fund, though, they stressed that the EPA’s regulations make it difficult
for an unfriendly executive branch to shake them off.
</p>
<p>
If a future administration were to want to change the rules finalized
this week, it would have to go through “a full rulemaking process,”
Peter Zalzal, a member of EDF’s Domestic Climate and Air legal team,
told me. That would include “a proposal that laid out the agency’s
rationale for making those choices, and the facts supporting that
rationale, and then hold a public comment process to incorporate
stakeholder feedback.” Only after going through all that would it be
able to take decisive action.
</p>
<p>
While it is possible that a Trump administration would attempt this, a
senior advisor to the NRDC action fund who spoke to me on the condition
of anonymity given the political nature of the question, stressed that
groups like theirs would fight tooth and nail to halt such a rollback.
There are plenty of stages in the EPA rulemaking process where
environmental groups could intervene, including by taking the
administration to court.
</p>
<p>
Trouble might start even sooner than January, though. By Thursday
morning, there were already multiple reports of Republican attorneys
general who had
“<a href="https://www.route-fifty.com/infrastructure/2024/03/automakers-get-some-breathing-room-epa-air-pollution-rules/395101/?oref=rf-today-nl&utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Route%20Fifty%20Today:%20March%2021%2C%202024&utm_term=newsletter_rf_today" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">warned
the EPA against</a> rolling out more aggressive tailpipe emissions
standards,” and opponents in Congress had filed a
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/gop-finds-democratic-allies-opposing-new-epa-tailpipe-rule/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bipartisan
resolution to undo the rule</a>. There’s even a world in which a
decision could be punted up to the Supreme Court, whose recent decisions
have been
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/is-water-wet-the-supreme-court-investigates" target="_self">hostile
toward the EPA’s regulatory powers</a>. Additionally, the American Fuel
and Petrochemical Manufacturers trade group is planning a seven-figure
ad spend across seven states “against the new rules heading into the
2024 election,”
<a href="https://www.kbb.com/car-news/epa-announces-tighter-tailpipe-emissions-rules/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Kelley
Blue Book</em> reports</a>, including an effort to brand them as a “gas
car ban.”
</p>
<p>
The rules are definitively not a ban, and automakers are generally
<a href="https://uaw.org/uaw-statement-on-the-epas-new-greenhouse-gas-emissions-rule/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on
board with them</a>. “It’s just not a case that these standards require
any kind of particular technologies,” Zalzal, from EDF, told me. “In
fact, we’ve done modeling to show that manufacturers could meet these by
selling very few battery electric vehicles.” (He added that, to be
clear, that isn’t the expectation). Generally, experts seem to agree
that the rules are on solid legal footing.
</p>
<p>
Still, it’s better to be safe than sorry. As my colleague Matthew
Zeitlin has reported, California has quietly been working behind the
scenes to get automakers to voluntarily comply with the regulations —
and, in that way,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/california-stellantis-trump-epa" target="_self">sneakily
“Trump-proof” the electrification push</a>.
</p>
<p>
After all, that’s the one thing you can count on with elephants: You can
see them coming.

<h2 id="at-un-nations-cooperate-toward-safe-trustworthy-ai-systems">At
UN, Nations Cooperate Toward Safe, Trustworthy AI Systems</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>United Nations — The U.N. General Assembly adopted by consensus
Thursday a first-of-its-kind resolution addressing the potential of
artificial intelligence to accelerate progress toward sustainable
development, while emphasizing the need for safe, secure and trustworthy
AI systems.</p>
<p>The initiative, led by the United States, seeks to manage AI’s risks
while utilizing its benefits.</p>
<p>“Today as the U.N. and AI finally intersect, we have the opportunity
and the responsibility to choose as one united global community to
govern this technology rather than to let it govern us,” said U.S.
Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield. “So let us reaffirm that AI will be
created and deployed through the lens of humanity and dignity, safety
and security, human rights and fundamental freedoms.”</p>
<p>The Biden administration said it took more than three months to
negotiate what it characterized as a “baseline set of principles” around
AI, engaging with 120 countries and incorporating feedback from many of
them, including China, which was one of the 123 co-sponsors of the
text.</p>
<p>While General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding, they
reflect the political consensus of the international community.</p>
<p>The resolution recognizes the disparities in technological
development between developed and developing countries and stresses the
need to bridge the digital divide so everyone can equitably access the
benefits of AI.</p>
<p>It also outlines measures for responsible AI governance, including
the development of regulatory frameworks, capacity building initiatives
and support for research and innovation. The resolution encourages
international collaboration to address the evolving challenges and
opportunities AI technologies pose, with a focus on advancing
sustainable development goals.</p>
<p>U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris welcomed adoption of the
resolution, saying all nations must be guided by a common set of
understandings on the use of AI systems.</p>
<p>“Too often, in past technological revolutions, the benefits have not
been shared equitably, and the harms have been felt by a
disproportionate few,” she said in a statement. “This resolution
establishes a path forward on AI where every country can both seize the
promise and manage the risks of AI.”</p>
<p>At the World Economic Forum meetings in Davos, Switzerland, in
January, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed concern about
the risk of unintended consequences with “every new iteration of
generative AI.” He said it has “enormous potential” for sustainable
development but also the potential to worsen inequality.</p>
<p>“And some powerful tech companies are already pursuing profits with a
clear disregard for human rights, personal privacy and social impact,”
he said at the time.</p>
<p>The U.N. chief created an AI advisory body last year, and it will
publish its final report ahead of the U.N.’s Summit of the Future in
September.</p>

id="nations-pledge-to-boost-nuclear-power-to-fight-climate-change">Nations
Pledge to Boost Nuclear Power to Fight Climate Change</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Paris — Representatives of 30 nations meeting in Brussels vowed to
beef up nuclear energy Thursday as one solution to meet climate-fighting
targets and guarantee reliable energy supplies. But the issue of nuclear
power is divisive, and critics say it shouldn’t be part of the world’s
approach to energy challenges.</p>
<p>The summit was the first of its kind, drawing leaders and delegates
from the United States, Brazil, China and France, among others. The
International Atomic Energy Agency, or IAEA, co-hosted the meeting and
is promoting nuclear energy as a key way to reduce skyrocketing climate
emissions.</p>
<p>IAEA chief Rafael Grossi said, “The heads of government, presidents,
they believe that in the current context energywise, securitywise,
nuclear has a very important contribution to make.”</p>
<p>Over 400 nuclear plants operate in about 30 countries, with another
500 planned or under construction. But overall, nuclear represents 10%
of global electricity generation. In a statement, countries attending
the meeting committed to increasing nuclear power’s potential, including
by building new plants.</p>
<p>White House climate advisor John Podesta said, “I think what this
summit will do, will put a marker down … that expansion of nuclear power
is critical for tackling the climate crisis that is really beginning to
disturb everyone across the globe.”</p>
<p>European Union countries such as France, which gets about 70% of its
electricity from nuclear power, believe it can help meet ambitious
European climate goals.</p>
<p>But the EU itself is divided. Some member states, including Germany,
Austria and Spain, have safety and environmental concerns about nuclear
energy, including the waste it generates.</p>
<p>So do groups such as Greenpeace, whose activists protested the
Brussels summit.</p>
<p>Lorelei Limousin, the climate and energy campaigner for Greenpeace EU
in Brussels, said, “Nuclear power is too slow to tackle the climate
emergency. Nuclear energy is also very expensive, and much more
expensive than renewables today. Finally nuclear power remains dangerous
today — with risks to health, environment, safety.”</p>
<p>Supporters say those risks can be managed — and they say that for
now, increasing nuclear’s share of the power mix is essential if the
world is to turn around a dangerous climate trajectory.</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
When visitors flock to the beach this summer in Duck, North Carolina, a
small, 6-mile long town on the Outer Banks, they may catch a glimpse of
a climate experiment happening among the waves.
</p>
<p>
About 1,500 feet offshore, a company called Vesta will be pouring 9,000
tons of sand into the sea and watching carefully to see what happens
next. This finely crushed rock will not be of the typical Outer Banks
variety. Instead, it will consist of a mineral called olivine, which
should enhance the ocean’s ability to absorb carbon from the atmosphere
— and lock it away for thousands of years.
</p>
<p>
That the experiment can go ahead at all marks a milestone for
ocean-based carbon removal, a category of climate solutions that prod
the ocean into sucking up more CO2. A big obstacle for the field has
been the lack of a legal framework for permitting real-world trials —
U.S. laws governing the ocean weren’t written with the prospect of
intentionally altering its chemistry to address an existential
environmental crisis in mind. But after an 18-month interagency review
process, Vesta is now the first company with a federal permit from the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to deploy a stand-alone carbon removal test
in U.S. waters.
</p>
<p>
Though 9,000 tons may sound like a lot, this is still a relatively
small-scale pilot designed to assess how effective the olivine is in
driving carbon removal, as well as observe any other changes in the
environment and develop methods for tracking the movement of the sand in
the water. These kinds of field trials are essential to establishing
which marine carbon removal methods have potential and which don’t.
</p>
<p>
“We want to measure everything very carefully at this stage and make
sure that we are fully understanding the safety profile and the carbon
removal data from this project,” Tom Green, Vesta’s CEO, told me. But
the company has big aspirations. If things go well, he said, maybe
olivine could be used for beach nourishment projects all over the
country, where sand is deposited along the shore to address erosion.
“Imagine the carbon removal possibilities if we did that with olivine
sand,” he said. “We could quickly become the largest technique for
permanent carbon removal that’s out there.”
</p>
<p>
Scientists generally agree that stopping global warming this century
will require both reducing emissions and taking carbon out of the
atmosphere. The sheer size of the ocean and its natural ability to store
vast amounts of carbon make it an enticing place to look for solutions.
</p>
<p>
Dumping thousands of tons of non-native sand into the ocean may not
sound like the most convincing option — especially since the ocean is
already “experiencing unprecedented destabilizing changes through
massive warming, acidification, deoxygenation, and a host of resulting
effects,” according to an
<a href="https://www.oceancdrscience.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">open
letter</a> published last year and signed by hundreds of scientists.
However, despite this — or perhaps because of it — the letter called for
accelerating research to find out whether any of the proposed
ocean-based carbon removal methods, including releasing large quantities
of ground olivine, are viable.
</p>
<p>
Olivine is an abundant mineral with special properties. When it comes
into contact with seawater, it drives a chemical reaction that converts
CO2 gas into more stable forms of carbon that can’t readily return to
the atmosphere. This in turn creates a deficit of CO2 in the surface
waters, which triggers the ocean to take up more from the atmosphere in
order to maintain equilibrium.
</p>
<p>
Reactions like this are happening constantly in the ocean already, but
on very slow timescales. Vesta’s innovation is to speed up the process
by crushing and deploying olivine strategically where the wind and waves
can most efficiently weather it away.

</p>
<p>
Olivine could address the harms of CO2 pollution in more ways than one.
The ocean already absorbs about 30% of the carbon released into the
atmosphere each year, which has made the water more acidic and less
hospitable to many of its inhabitants. But when olivine triggers these
reactions, it can act as a sort of antacid. This approach to carbon
removal is also known as
<a href="https://www.whoi.edu/know-your-ocean/ocean-topics/climate-weather/ocean-based-climate-solutions/ocean-alkalinity/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">enhancing
the ocean’s alkalinity</a> and olivine is just one of a number of
different ways to do it. Another company called Planetary is
experimenting with adding a different mineral, magnesium hydroxide, to
the ocean. Ebb Carbon, on the other hand, is sucking up seawater and
running it through a membrane to increase its alkalinity, before
returning it to the tides.
</p>
<p>
Both already have field trials up and running, but instead of trying to
conduct stand-alone experiments in the open ocean they’ve hitched onto
existing ocean dumping permits. Ebb, for example, has set up at the
Pacific Northwest National Laboratory’s facility in Sequim, Washington,
where it is releasing treated seawater into wastewater that flows into
the bay. Similarly, Planetary is conducting pilot projects at the
wastewater outflows of a water treatment facility and power plant in
Canada. Other ocean carbon removal companies, such as Los Angeles-based
Captura, have opted to
<a href="https://capturacorp.com/equinor-and-captura-partner-to-develop-ocean-carbon-removal/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">move
abroad for their early projects</a> and avoid the U.S. permitting puzzle
altogether.
</p>
<p>
Vesta went to Duck because it is among the most studied stretches of
coastline in the country. The town is home to an Army Corps coastal
field research center known for its long-term data set on the
surrounding waters. “Few locations on the globe provide a better archive
of wave, water, bathymetry and other forces that shape nearshore
conditions,”
<a href="https://www.erdc.usace.army.mil/Media/Fact-Sheets/Fact-Sheet-Article-View/Article/476710/field-research-facility/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according
to the Army Corps’ website</a>. (“Bathymetry” is the topography of the
seafloor.) That means Vesta will be able to get a more accurate picture
of any changes the olivine is responsible for.
</p>
<p>
When Drew Havens, the town manager in Duck, first heard about Vesta’s
plans, he was skeptical. “You’re dumping something into the ocean,
people automatically go to, well, is it going to harm humans? Is it
going to be harmful to wildlife or other living organisms?” he told me.
</p>
<p>
Though some in the town are still nervous, Havens said he has become
more comfortable with the idea as the project has been rigorously
reviewed by environmental protection regulators at the federal and state
level. Vesta’s scientists also engaged with the town council, did an
open house for members of the public, and have generally invited
questions and open dialogue.
</p>
<p>
Just because regulators have determined that the risks of this pilot
project are low, however, doesn’t mean using olivine for carbon removal
is risk-free. For one, the rock has to be mined — in this case, from a
quarry in Norway, although it is also found in the U.S. — and
transported to the project site. That’s likely to produce some
environmental impacts, though the company
<a href="https://www.vesta.earth/duck" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">estimates</a>
that the project will ultimately remove about 10 times more CO2 from the
atmosphere than the emissions associated with running the experiment,
including the mining and shipping of olivine.
</p>
<p>
But the biggest risk with mined olivine is that it
<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fclim.2019.00007/full" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">contains
nickel</a>, said Jaime Palter, an associate professor of oceanography at
the University of Rhode Island who has no affiliation with Vesta. Nickel
can act as both a nutrient and a toxin for phytoplankton, she told me,
so it’s important to study whether putting olivine in the ocean will
result in adverse effects.
</p>
<p>
Vesta has been closely examining that possibility. In fact, the project
in Duck will be the company’s second U.S. field trial. In the summer of
2022, Vesta got permission from the town of Southampton in Long Island
to spread olivine on the beach as part of a larger sand replenishment
project that was already in the works. Vesta’s scientists worked with
local academic partners at Cornell, SUNY Stony Brook, and Hamilton
College to do extensive monitoring both before and after the sand was
placed, collecting data on more than 20 indicators of the effects on the
water, sediment, and ecology.
</p>
<p>
The company has since published two annual reports on the project. It is
still awaiting analysis of many of the samples, but so far, the results
have been promising, Green said. There has been no sign of trace metal
accumulation in Eastern Oysters, a species known to accumulate
pollutants from their environment, for instance. There was also no
significant difference in water quality between control areas and the
sites with olivine, and trace metal concentrations were below the
relevant
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/wqc/national-recommended-water-quality-criteria-aquatic-life-criteria-table" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">EPA
water quality guidelines</a>. The area’s benthic macrofauna — critters
like clams and small crustaceans that live on or near the seafloor —
were as abundant and various as before.
</p>
<p>
Notably, the tests also showed evidence of an increase in alkalinity in
the waters of the olivine-treated area, which is the key reaction that
leads to carbon removal. But Green said there’s more work to be done in
terms of calculating where and when removal may have happened.

There’s also more work to be done to understand the effects of olivine
in different environments, which brings us back to Duck. There, it will
be deposited in 25-foot deep water instead of on the beach, helping
Vesta to further refine its data and measurement methods. The plan is to
continue testing and collecting data at the site for at least two years.
The company declined to comment on the budget for the project. Vesta is
funded primarily by venture capital investors but also raises money for
research through an affiliated nonprofit.
</p>
<p>
Vesta may have been the first to get a federal permit to run a marine
carbon removal test, but it definitely won’t be the last. Nikhil
Neelakantan, a senior project manager at Ocean Visions, which is a
nonprofit that advocates for ocean-based climate solutions, told me
there are a number of other domestic projects in the pipeline, including
<a href="https://oceanacidification.noaa.gov/fy23-nopp-mcdr-awards/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more
than a dozen government-funded research projects</a>. The White House
also recently set up a marine carbon removal
<a href="https://www.noaa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-10/mCDR_FTAC_charter_2023_09_19_approved.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fast
track action committee</a> with the mandate to create recommendations
for policy, permitting, and regulatory standards for both research and
implementation.
</p>
<p>
Neelakantan said there is work to do on clarifying the role of different
agencies in regulating ocean carbon removal, and which laws apply to
each method.
</p>
<p>
“This is an early first step, and it’s exciting to see that it’s finally
going to come to fruition,” he said, of Vesta’s project in Duck. “I
think there’s momentum with this federal task force. It’s going to be
the first of many others that will happen soon.”

<h2 id="united-states-files-antitrust-lawsuit-against-apple">United
States files antitrust lawsuit against Apple</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-21, from: OS News</p>
<p>For many years, Apple has built a dominant iPhone platform and
ecosystem that has driven the company’s astronomical valuation. At the
same time, it has long understood that disruptive technologies and
innovative apps, products, and services threatened that dominance by
making users less reliant on the iPhone or making it easier to switch to
a non-Apple smartphone. Rather than respond to competitive threats by
offering lower smartphone prices to consumers or better monetization for
developers, Apple would meet competitive threats by imposing a series of
shapeshifting rules and restrictions in its App Store guidelines and
developer agreements that would allow Apple to extract higher fees,
thwart innovation, offer a less secure or degraded user experience, and
throttle competitive alternatives. It has deployed this playbook across
many technologies, products, and services, including super apps, text
messaging, smartwatches, and digital wallets, among many others. Apple’s
conduct also stifles new paradigms that threaten Apple’s smartphone
dominance, including the cloud, which could make it easier for users to
enjoy high-end functionality on a lower priced smartphone—or make users
device-agnostic altogether. As one Apple manager recently observed,
“Imagine buying a Android for 25 bux at a garage sale and it works fine
… And you have a solid cloud computing device. Imagine how many cases
like that there are.” Simply put, Apple feared the disintermediation of
its iPhone platform and undertook a course of conduct that locked in
users and developers while protecting its profits. Critically, Apple’s
anticompetitive conduct not only limits competition in the smartphone
market, but also reverberates through the industries that are affected
by these restrictions, including financial services, fitness, gaming,
social media, news media, entertainment, and more. Unless Apple’s
anticompetitive and exclusionary conduct is stopped, it will likely
extend and entrench its iPhone monopoly to other markets and parts of
the economy. For example, Apple is rapidly expanding its influence and
growing its power in the automotive, content creation and entertainment,
and financial services industries–and often by doing so in exclusionary
ways that further reinforce and deepen the competitive moat around the
iPhone. ↫ DoJ antitrust lawsuit vs. Apple The United States Department
of Justice is filing an antitrust lawsuit against Apple.</p>

<h2 id="why-i-dont-write-dev-posts">Why I don’t write dev posts</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-21, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;There are some 400 or so blog posts on this site. I could be wrong but I think I wrote precisely 1 dev focused post. I wrote a few blog posts here and there that are tangentially work-related because they’re about projects I worked on but that’s about it.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
There’s a reason why I don’t write about dev stuff. And it’s not because
I find it boring or uninspiring. Quite the contrary. I love learning
about web stuff. I love reading Robin’s
<a href="https://robinrendle.com/the-cascade/">The Cascade</a> for
example. There’s always something new happening on the web, especially
in the frontend space. And as a—former?—designer I love learning about
front-end stuff.
</p>
<p>
The reason why I don’t write about dev stuff it’s because, like many
others, I suffer from
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome">impostor
syndrome</a>. I’ve been working on the web for more than 12 years. I’m
still convinced I don’t know shit. I scroll through
<a href="https://minimal.gallery/">minimal.gallery</a> or
<a href="https://onepagelove.com/">OPL</a>, see the work of all those
great designers and developers, and reinforce this idea that there are,
in fact, countless people out there who are better than me.
</p>
<p>
Don’t get me wrong, the rational part of me knows that’s not entirely
true. Of course there are people that are better than me. There will
always be people better than me at literally everything. Still, this
sensation of not knowing shit keep following me around and it’s the
reason why I don’t write about web stuff. This is also the reason why I
said no when I was offered the possibility to teach. I know, it’s
probably stupid but it is what it is. Dealing with my mind is a tough
job.

<h2 id="us-takes-on-apple-in-antitrust-lawsuit">US Takes On Apple in
Antitrust Lawsuit</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The U.S. Department of Justice on Thursday sued Apple,
the first major antitrust effort against the iPhone maker by the Biden
administration, alleging it monopolized smartphone markets.  </p>
<p>Apple joins a list of major tech companies sued by U.S. regulators,
including Alphabet’s  Google, Meta Platforms and Amazon.com across the
administrations of both former President Donald Trump and President Joe
Biden.</p>
<p>“Consumers should not have to pay higher prices because companies
violate the antitrust laws,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a
statement. “If left unchallenged, Apple will only continue to strengthen
its smartphone monopoly.”</p>
<p>The Justice Department alleges that Apple uses its market power to
get more money from consumers, developers, content creators, artists,
publishers, small businesses and merchants.</p>
<p>The civil lawsuit accuses Apple of an illegal monopoly on smartphones
maintained by imposing contractual restrictions on, and withholding
critical access from, developers.</p>
<p>Apple has already been subject to antitrust probes and orders in
Europe, Japan and Korea, as well as lawsuits from corporate rivals such
as Epic Games.  </p>
<p>One of Apple’s most lucrative businesses - its App Store, which
charges developers commissions of up to 30% - has already survived a
lengthy legal challenge under U.S. law by Epic. While the lawsuit found
that Apple did not violate antitrust laws, a federal judge ordered Apple
to allow links and buttons to pay for apps without using Apple’s in-app
payment commission.</p>
<p>In Europe, Apple’s App Store business model has been dismantled by a
new law called the Digital Markets Act that went into effect earlier
this month. Apple plans to let developers offer their own app stores -
and, importantly, pay no commissions - but rivals such as Spotify and
Epic argue Apple is still making it too hard to offer alternative app
stores.</p>
<p>The rulings on Apple’s App Store forced the Justice Department to
look at Apple’s other practices for the basis of a complaint, such as
how Apple allows outside firms to access the chips and sensors in the
iPhone.</p>
<p>Consumer hardware firms, such as smart-tracker maker Tile Inc, have
long complained that Apple has restricted the ways in which they can
work with the iPhone’s sensors while developing competing products that
have greater access.  </p>
<p>Apple began selling AirTags - which can be attached to items like car
keys to help users find them when they are lost - several years after
Tile had been selling a similar product.</p>
<p>Similarly, Apple has restricted access to a chip in the iPhone that
allows for contactless payments. Credit cards can only be added to the
iPhone by using Apple’s own Apple Pay service.  </p>
<p>And Apple has also faced criticism over its iMessage service, which
only works on Apple devices.</p>
<p>Apple has long argued that it restricts access to some user data and
some of the iPhone’s hardware by third-party developers for privacy and
security reasons.</p>

<h2 id="to-understand-the-epas-car-rules-look-to-china">To Understand
the EPA’s Car Rules, Look to China</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-21, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTc4NzA5Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1MzY2NDUzOX0.VMothbfMd5JtygJoFBWtei66rAWZ9TG9IZPza7nZTys/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
On Wednesday, the Biden administration finalized sweeping new rules that
will sharply limit how much carbon pollution new cars and trucks can
emit into the atmosphere. The rules — which rank as one of Biden’s most
important climate moves — are aimed at accelerating the country’s
transition to electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids, requiring most new
cars sold in 2032 to burn little gasoline or none at all.
</p>
<p>
My colleague Emily Pontecorvo has an
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/epa-auto-emissions-rule" target="_self">excellent
explainer</a> on how the new rules work. But I want to focus on one more
aspect: Why they are able to do so much more than previous tailpipe
regulations.
</p>
<p>
The new rules are not the Environmental Protection Agency’s first foray
into regulating climate-warming pollution from vehicle tailpipes. Since
2010, the EPA has periodically tightened new limits on the amount of
climate-warming pollution that cars and light-duty trucks can emit. The
new rules are in some ways merely the next evolution of that approach.
</p>
<p>
But they also go much further than the agency ever has before. Where
previous regulations essentially required automakers only to sell some
conventional hybrids and electric vehicles, by the beginning of next
decade, the lion’s share of cars sold in the United States must be
electric vehicles or hybrids, the EPA now says.
</p>
<p>
Why is that ambition possible? One reason is that the United States has
a more aggressive climate law on the books now than it has had during
past rulemakings. Biden’s climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act, will
subsidize the purchase, leasing, and manufacturing of electric vehicles.
Because of how the EPA calculates the costs and benefits of its
proposals, these subsidies will significantly cut the projected cost of
even an ambitious rule — in this case by as much as $65 billion. (The
agency calculates that consumers will save even more money — up to a
staggering $230 billion — by paying less gasoline tax because they will
be buying less fuel.)
</p>
<p>
Yet the IRA is not the only reason — or even the <em>main</em> reason —
these rules can go so much further than what was previously imagined. If
the United States can pursue such an ambitious standard now, that’s
because it’s following on the heels of electric vehicle policy passed in
other jurisdictions:
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/ford-gm-stellantis-byd" target="_self">China</a>,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/california-stellantis-trump-epa" target="_self">California</a>,
and the European Union. These state and national policies have set the
pace for the EV transition around the world, setting new market
expectations or significantly cutting the costs of building an electric
car.
</p>
<p>
They also created a sense of inevitability around electric vehicles.
“The future is electric. Automakers are committed to the EV transition,”
John Bozella, the president and CEO of the Alliance for Automotive
Innovation, a car-industry trade group in Washington,
<a href="https://www.autosinnovate.org/posts/press-release/epa-greenhouse-gas-emissions-and-criteria-pollutant-rules-statement" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>
in a statement Wednesday on the EPA rules.
</p>
<p>
Corey Cantor, an analyst at the market research firm BNEF, summed it all
up. “What is different this time — compared to say, where the world was
in 2016 — is that there is now a thriving global EV market, versus a
nascent one,” he said. There are also a handful of global companies
poised to profit from a global EV transition, regardless of what Ford,
Toyota, General Motors, and other legacy auto brands do.
</p>
<p>
Even before Biden asked the EPA to issue new regulations, in other
words, these policies had changed the metaphorical game board — and
changed how far the agency could push the rules.
</p>
<p>
These global policies don’t all take the same form.
<a href="https://rmi.org/understanding-californias-advanced-clean-cars-ii-regulation/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">California</a>
and
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/eu-countries-poised-approve-2035-phaseout-co2-emitting-cars-2023-03-28/#:~:text=The%20EU%20law%20will%20require,new%20car%20fleets%20in%20Europe." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the
European Union</a> already require that all new cars sold in 2035 must
be electric vehicles or plug-in hybrids, although the EU has carved out
an exception for a theoretical
<a href="https://heatmap.news/culture/f1-saudi-aramco-sportswashing-report" target="_self">zero-carbon
gasoline replacement</a>.
</p>
<p>
Due to a longstanding provision in the Clean Air Act, other U.S. states
can opt into California’s stricter air pollution laws. So far, 14 in
total — making up more than 40% of America’s light-duty car market —
<a href="https://www.c2es.org/document/us-state-clean-vehicle-policies-and-incentives/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">have
adopted</a> California’s 2035 zero-emissions vehicle mandate.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/china-aims-for-evs-to-account-for-50-of-all-car-sales-by-2035-60954964" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">China</a>,
meanwhile, has not set a requirement that all cars must plug in by a
certain year. Instead, it will require that “new energy vehicles” — a
category that can include EVs and plug-in hybrids, but also conventional
hybrids — must make up half of all car sales by 2035. But Chinese
companies have raced ahead of this target. Wang Chuanfu, the CEO of the
massive Chinese automaker BYD,
<a href="https://electrek.co/2024/03/19/byd-nev-share-50-next-3-months-china/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">estimated</a>
this weekend that 50% of China’s car sales could be new energy vehicles
as soon as June.
</p>
<p>
All together, these mandates added up to a strong market signal. By last
year, more than half of the global auto market was already covered by
some form of clean vehicle rule — even before the EPA did anything
final. Now, if the new EPA rules are enforced as written, then more than
60% of the world’s car market will be subject to some kind of emissions
mandate.
</p>
<p>
This reflects, at least in part, a recognition that the global car
market is changing beyond the ability of Washington politicians to
influence it. “If we’re talking 10 years from now, policy probably won’t
be needed, at least in leading markets. EVs will have just naturally
taken over the market,”
<a href="https://theicct.org/team-member/stephanie-searle/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Stephanie
Searle</a>, who leads research programs at the International Council on
Clean Transportation, told me.
</p>
<p>
Over the past year, a parade of cheap new EVs from Chinese automakers —
including
<a href="https://insideevs.com/news/663595/byd-seagull-ev-priced-11400-usd-gets-10000-orders-first-day/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the
BYD Seagull</a>, a sub-$10,000 hatchback that gets up to 251 miles of
range — have stunned the automotive industry. Jim Farley, the CEO of
Ford, told investors last month that the company
<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-ceo-worrying-china-ev-210427890.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAGOJfCq_b1u1o08P6QZ5YcCGmyejoRmynHI6aCv7gUBUnpzXAR9MpKfxsF6OrWhaE-sAQR3bDBHZqucJa2LeHI0w83iBU8dLPsgbrqSN8DXqdG8bym7vIKQgUeFVQnsEvltTcTbR-C6tt1B4Z7VuIBHCopGuhIbczH8q18VDpDEg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">was
reorienting</a> its strategy to combat the rise of Chinese electric-car
makers, such as BYD and Geely.
</p>
<p>
“If you cannot compete fair and square with the Chinese around the
world, then 20% to 30% of your revenue is at risk,” Farley
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/ford-ceo-open-working-with-rivals-compete-with-china-2024-02-15/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>
at an industry conference last month. He
<a href="https://www.autonews.com/cars-concepts/ford-shifts-3-row-evs-smaller-affordable-models#:~:text=It%20reported%20Ford%20is%20planning,to%20comment%20on%20future%20product." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">disclosed</a>
that Ford had set up a secret internal “skunkworks” engineering team to
make an affordable electric vehicle that could compete head-to-head with
Chinese models on cost. The company has delayed the release of a new
electric three-row SUV in order to produce three roughly $25,000 models,
according to a
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-18/chinese-ev-affordability-frightens-ford-gm-us-automakers" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Bloomberg</em>
report</a> last week.
</p>
<p>
“Automakers see the future is electrified, and they see that Chinese
companies will eat their lunch if they don’t get going,” Searle, the
clean transportation researcher, said. “There’s no putting the genie
back in the bottle.”
</p>
<p>
But China’s dominance was not inevitable — it was itself the result of
ambitious industrial policies. Roughly 15 years ago, China identified
the electric vehicle industry as a sector where it could eventually
become a global leader in export markets,
<a href="https://sociology.princeton.edu/people/benjamin-h-bradlow" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Benjamin
Bradlow</a>, a Princeton professor of sociology and international
affairs, told me.
</p>
<p>
Since then, the country’s leaders have targeted the EV sector with
generous subsidies far beyond what Americans lawmakers considered for
the IRA, he said. They have also encouraged the EV industry’s geographic
spread across China and
<a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/chinas-transition-electric-vehicles-0429" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">required</a>
automakers to sell a certain percentage of EVs across their vehicle
fleet.
</p>
<p>
“It’s a very different style of policymaking” from what America has done
with the IRA, Bradlow said, although like that law it also aimed to
lower the cost of technologies. “[China] is targeting a sector and it’s
being very specific about being at the technological and price frontier
— it’s very export-oriented.”
</p>
<p>
These policies have succeeded beyond imagining. China is now the world’s
largest exporter of cars, and it has become a goliath in the EV
industry. The country has achieved what hippies and renegades have long
claimed is possible: a thriving and cutthroat electric vehicle industry,
where consumers are willing to buy EVs without significant subsidies.
(Indeed, China’s electric-car makers have been locked in a price war
over the past year, driving even greater adoption as prices fall.)
</p>
<p>
These Chinese industrial policies — along with American and
European-funded R&amp;D — have cut tens of thousands of dollars from EV
prices. Over the past three decades, the cost of manufacturing a battery
<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/battery-price-decline" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has
fallen by 97%</a>, and by 2027 manufacturing a new EV battery
<a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/30112023/inside-clean-energy-battery-prices-are-falling/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">is
projected</a> to cost less than $100 a kilowatt-hour, a long-theorized
benchmark at which an electric vehicle will be competitive with a
gasoline vehicle.
</p>
<p>
In the United States, mandates and subsidies in achieving mass EV
adoption have not been quite as enthusiastically received. Some 7% of
new cars
<a href="https://www.coxautoinc.com/market-insights/q4-2023-ev-sales/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sold</a>
in the United States last year were EVs, an all-time high. Plug-in and
conventional hybrids made up an additional 8% of new car sales,
according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
</p>
<p>
Those sales shares will need to double repeatedly in the years ahead for
American automakers to meet the EPA’s new standards. And they point to
at least one form of success that has alluded American policymakers so
far: creating a robust, popular EV industry that can win over consumers
on its own terms.
</p>
<p>
“The ultimate success of the policy and transition overall is a mix
between policy, consumer adoption, and the automakers themselves,”
Cantor, the BNEF analyst, told me.
</p>
<p>
For the first time ever, in other words, “automakers who fall behind may
pay a far higher cost for failure to transition,” Cantor said. And that
— above anything else — is what makes these EPA rules different from any
that have come before.

previously thought, citing less government spending and more
immigration. And we look at why we may end up with higher interest rates
over the next few years.

<p>
The climate media startup Heatmap News is looking for a veteran,
ambitious reporter to lead its coverage of the intersection of renewable
energy projects and politics.<br/>
</p>
<p>
This writer will report to the editor-in-chief and be tasked with
reporting on how local and national politics are helping or hindering
clean energy projects across the country. They should be well-sourced,
deft at navigating data, and able to traverse government websites and
polls to extract insights. They should also be knowledgeable about tax
incentives and permitting issues — words like 45x and the
interconnection queue should mean something.

<p>
The salary minimum is $80,000 and the maximum is $110,000. Competitive
benefits, unlimited paid time off, and a generous equity plan, which
gives employees a real stake in the company, are also offered. This
position is remote.

<strong>Interested candidates should send a brief cover letter and
resume to editors@heatmap.news.</strong>

Hank Green posted
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W92bjv8fNTI">a video about four
lies he believed</a>. It’s a great video because it’s embarrassing to be
wrong on the internet and here is smart person™️ Hank Green admitting he
believed some bullshit. As you travel through the internet you’re
constantly working against a lot of personal biases, like confirmation
bias or the overconfidence bias, and it’s easy to slip up. It’s
(biologically) difficult to correct your understanding as new facts
invalidate what you believed true.
</p>
<p>
One simple question I’ve started asking a lot is: “How do you verify
that?”
</p>
<p>
I’ve seen some compelling demos where LLMs take a jumble of text and
spit out compelling artifacts like an image,
<a href="https://openai.com/sora">some b-roll</a>, a spreadsheet,
<a href="https://salt-nlp.github.io/Design2Code/">a website</a>, or
<a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/podcast">an entire daily news
podcast</a>. It’s incredible… until my buzzkill brain starts asking
questions. Images are easy to verify: does image look correct or does it
contain phantom limbs and have five rows of teeth? Text summary or
expansion, also within possibility to verify. A website? I mean… I can
tell you if it’s an okay website code-wise but I’m probably an outlier
here. Validating the accuracy of a larger corpus of data that got
summarized, keyworded, and categorized? Oof. This is where the scales
tip for me because it seems improbable. Or at least time consuming.
Perhaps as time consuming as it takes to do the work yourself?
</p>
<p>
To be fair to the robots (<em>why would I ever say this?</em>) I think
it’s worth pointing the question at myself. I’ve been thinking about my
“old world” method of verifying facts and determined I have the
following routine.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
I consume a lot
</li>
<li>
I experiment
</li>
<li>
I ask experts
</li>
</ol>
<p>
When I say “consume a lot”, I mean I read hundreds – sometimes thousands
– of articles and watch hundreds of videos each week (cf. novelty
seeking, information addiction) as well as
<a href="https://daverupert.com/bookshelf/">my book habit</a>. To make
that theoretical knowledge more practical, I prototype and experiment to
answer questions. With a basic understanding established, I often ask
experts for their perspective. For web tech, that’s lots of open
questions or DMs to people I know care about a specific technology. I’ll
then sometimes have those people on my podcast to prod them some
more.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Like loose change and shells rattling inside a coffee can, I collect all
those informational tidbits and filter them through my years of
experience and
<a href="https://media1.giphy.com/media/gW0cPZopjtpoA/giphy.gif">how my
brain works</a>. That produces an outcome I’m generally satisfied with,
informed yet potentially wrong. It’s not too different from an LLM where
the outputs are only as good as their inputs.
</p>
<p>
My inputs are sometimes flawed.
<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/if-books-could-kill/id1651876897">If
Books Could Kill…</a> is a podcast where the hosts do takedowns of my
favorite books: self-help pop-psychology airport books. They do an
incredible job at on-the-fly fact checking, reading criticisms,
scrutinizing every assertion, asking “Hey wait, is that true?” on every
page and have nearly ruined the entire genre for me. I assume you learn
this brand of skepticism in journalism school and the trade-off is that
you’ll never enjoy a book again in your life. But I need to remind
myself the goal of a book isn’t to get to the last page, it’s to expand
your thinking.
</p>
<p>
I wish I did better at this (so I don’t repeat falsehoods) but
collecting factoids makes me feel smart and I like feeling smart so now
they’re insulated inside a little blanket of my personal biases.
Fact-checking in realtime doesn’t tickle the ol’ grey matter. It doesn’t
have the same dopamine response.
</p>
<p>
One more story and I’ll let you go. In an effort to not be a total
fucking grandpa all the time I’m trying to use AI more while keeping an
open mind. It’s been… challenging. But the other day I needed a fact
checked – something one of my investors mentioned during our YCombinator
application process that was noodling around in my head – and a regular
search didn’t return any results, so I tried a trending AI search tool
that provides citations.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
First it told me “Yes, this was true” but cited the wrong reasons.
</li>
<li>
So I hit it with an “Are you sure?” and it changed its answer to “No,
it’s not true” but cited a random Hacker News comment that asserted the
opposite.
</li>
<li>
So I said “Your source says the opposite” and it KFC doubledown’d and
said “No, it’s not true.”
</li>
<li>
So I copy-pasted the text from their own source into the prompt and it
said “Yes, this was true.”
</li>
</ul>
<p>
That’s a… complex user journey. And it happens to me a lot. I wonder if
this tech falls victim to its own compelling demos. The
“<a href="https://indieweb.social/@johnallsopp/112050757204780359">Time
to First Demo</a>” is so short and often so profound, we fill in the
possibilities with our own projections and science fiction. It’s harder
to question the quality or veracity when our imaginations and our biases
get wrapped up in the idea because it might mean questioning ourselves…
which is not something humans are biologically engineered to do well.
</p>
<p>
Okay, this is the last bit I promise. There’s one line from that Hank
Green video that stands out to me in this whole self-fact-checking
debacle…
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I was fine with having the [mis]information put into my head, but when I
put it into someone else’s head, I felt a little weird about it so I
went to check just in case.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
That seems like a humane approach to sharing information. Be liberal in
what you accept, fact-check on the way out. I hope I can get better at
that.

<h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>EPA unveils final auto emission rules
</h3>
<p>
<strong></strong>The Biden administration announced final new emissions
standards for cars yesterday, significantly curtailing both the carbon
dioxide and the toxic soot and chemicals that spew from the tailpipes of
the nation’s light- and medium-duty vehicles. The rules tighten
pollution limits gradually over six years, and are slightly watered down
compared to the version released last April: While automakers will still
have to achieve the same emissions standard by 2032 as what was
originally proposed, they will now be able to transition more slowly,
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=f8ceb16b61&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">explained
Emily Pontecorvo and Robinson Meyer at Heatmap</a>. Administration
officials argue that giving automakers, dealers, and labor unions more
time in the near-term will make for a sturdier rule, and that the
cumulative emissions benefits of the final standard converge with the
original proposal. The EPA now estimates that EVs may make up anywhere
between 30% and 56% of new light-duty sales from model years 2030 to
2032, and by 2032, the light-duty fleet on offer from automakers will
emit half as much carbon as vehicles on the market in 2026.

a letter</a> to Fatih Birol, executive director of the International
Energy Agency, accusing the group of “undermining energy security” and
being a cheerleader for the “energy transition” (quotes theirs). The
letter suggests the IEA has lost its credibility as a reliable and
objective source of information on fossil fuel markets, and has focused
too heavily on clean energy developments and too little on “the things
that matter most to policymakers.” The letter is signed by House energy
committee chair Cathy McMorris-Rodgers and Sen. John Barrasso, the top
Republican on the Senate energy panel, among others.

IEA’s forecasts that oil demand could peak by 2030 have perturbed fossil

from the list of potential hurricane names because of their links to
devastating extreme weather events. The World Meteorological

different storm would be inappropriate for obvious reasons of

killing 51 people and causing $3 billion in damage. Dora played an
“indirect meteorological role” in Maui’s massive wildfires, which killed
more than 100 people and caused at least $4 billion in damages. Otis and

<h2 id="why-were-lucky-wordpress-is-here-and-other-topics">Why we’re
lucky WordPress is here and other topics</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-21, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I spent some time this week reviewing the UI of Radio UserLand, released
in 2002. It was both a feed reader and a writing tool.
</p>
<p>
One would have thought, btw, that from that start that all subsequent
blogging tools would have the same connections, even if the
functionality was not all in the same product. But then came Twitter and
Facebook, and they said they weren’t blogs, and presumably would start a
new tradition with new user expectations. And that worked. The new
blogging platforms were
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_silo">silos</a>.
</p>
<p>
So the integration opportunities were limited, something that took me 11
years to fully appreciate, and to
<a href="http://scripting.com/2017/05/05/iWantMyOldBlogBack.html">give
up</a> on. I was in a intellectual cloud, not thinking straight.
</p>
<p>
Meantime, the tradition of blogging was preserved by WordPress. As a
blogging tool, it supported the same connective features that Radio did.
There were some it couldn’t cover because Radio was a desktop app, not a
web app (though it looked like a web app, you installed a piece of
software on the desktop).
</p>
<p>
This was the
<a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1997/09/14/FractionalHorsepowerHTTPSe.html">Fractional
Horsepower HTTP Server</a> idea realized.
</p>
<p>
So for example, we had
<a href="http://radio.userland.com/userGuide/reference/howUpstreamingWorks">upstreaming</a>,
which was a one-way Dropbox, a number of years before Dropbox existed.
This meant that the link between the CMS and the server went through the
file system. The product didn’t live long enough to fulfill the
potential of that feature. The idea was that you could use any editor
you wanted to write something that was posted to the blog, you could
choose to have it rendered through the site template, or uploaded as-is.
</p>
<p>
The
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/21/radioEditorScreenshot.png">editor</a>
we supplied with Radio was one of those
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/01/14/031201.html">tiny little text
boxes</a>, but I hoped that better editors would emerge. I wanted to
make one myself, combining the outliner in Frontier with scripting, to
drop posts into the folder structure that Radio expected.
</p>
<p>
<div class="divInlineImage">
<center>
<img class="imgInline" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/21/radioEditorScreenshot.png">
</center>
Radio’s tiny little textbox circa 2002.
</div>
</p>
<p>
Years later I tried to do it with Dropbox itself, with a product called
<a href="http://fargo.io/docs/whatIsFargo.html">Fargo</a>. Dropbox was
so incredibly close to the ideal user-owned storage server system, but
they wouldn’t go the final step, in creating a class of content that
could be shared with two or more apps but not all apps. So the user
didn’t have enough control for it to work.
</p>
<p>
The idea of multiple apps working on the same data would be
revolutionary. How do I know? Because that’s how computers worked before
the web. So to make the thing I want to do work, now, in 2024, I’m going
to have to create my own storage system for the user, and I will pay for
it, at least to start.
</p>
<p>
Hopefully at some point I’ll be able to turn that over to Automattic and
have them run it, or if they don’t want to, maybe someone else will. But
it has to be there for the web as a runtime environment to support the
same diversity of software that the PC and Mac did in the generation
before the web.
</p>
<p>
Technology does go backwards, a lot – we lose valuable things without
any thought, when we could keep them.
</p>
<p>
BTW, that’s why it’s good to keep some old people around, we might
remember the things that were lost. I’m trying to make sure the really
good ideas, the keepers, get another chance.
</p>
<p>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/21/blogrollscreen.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Another
random morning bit – something subtle in the blogroll you might not have
noticed. It has no trouble dealing with titled or untitled posts. Blog
posts typically have titles, social media posts do not.
<a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> is opinionated
about this – it
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/21/rssIsOpinionatedAboutOptionalTitles.png">says</a>
you should support both views. But the feed reader folk ignored that
guidance. My little blogroll shows you how to do it, it’s pretty simple.
<span>If it doesn’t have a title use the description</span>.
</p>
<p>
Think of it this way. What if motorcycles, cars, trucks and bikes
couldn’t all use the same roads? What kind of way would that be to run a
civilization. Same thing with feeds.
</p>
<p>
There’s a screen shot of the blogroll to the right, with Scripting News
highlighted and expanded. Some of those posts have titles and some
don’t. You and I as developers care about that, but we shouldn’t show
that difference that in the user interface. The users don’t care and
rightly so. It’s confusing and takes their attention away from the
writing.
</p>
<p>
Another topic. Something I noticed in WordPress’s RSS feeds. If I start
a post out with an empty title, it uses the post ID to form the URL for
the post. That’s the right thing to do imho. But then if I add a title,
which can happen, it changes the URL to use the title. But URLs
shouldn’t change. It also changes the guid, so a feed reader will think
there were two posts when there was just one. Now I don’t know if they
can change it at this late date, I imagine there are workarounds out
there. But I noticed this the other day, and thought I should mention
it. Why not just use the post ID for the guid, esp since it says the
guid is not a permalink? And use it in forming the URL. I totally
understand the benefit of using the title in the URL. But you can’t
depend on the title being there.
</p>
<p>
Finally, to answer the question raised by the title of this piece –
WordPress is, among other things, a perfect time capsule of open
technologies from the early days of innovation on the web, and widely
deployed and able to deliver all their benefits, if we widen our view of
social media to be a <i>social web,</i> and simply create places where
posts with and without titles are equally supported. It’s that simple.
Without WordPress we would have to build all that, and wait for it to
deploy in numbers, to matter in the market. All we have to do now is
make the connections.

the Bitcoin network uses loads of energy. But so does mainstream
finance. So which system is more energy intensive? In this post, I do

Congress Releases $1.1 Trillion Spending Package to Avert Shutdown</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — After days of delay, U.S. congressional leaders unveiled
a $1.1 trillion bipartisan spending measure for defense, homeland
security and other programs early on Thursday, giving lawmakers less
than two days to avert a partial government shutdown.</p>
<p>The Republican-controlled House of Representatives will vote on the
sprawling package on Friday, leaving the Democratic-majority Senate only
hours to pass the package of six bills that covers about two-thirds of
the $1.66 trillion in discretionary government spending for the fiscal
year that began on Oct. 1.</p>
<p>“These final six bills represent a bipartisan and bicameral
compromise,” the two top Senate negotiators - Patty Murray, a Democrat,
and Susan Collins, a Republican - said in a statement.</p>
<p>“They will invest in the American people, build a stronger economy,
help keep our communities safe, and strengthen our national security and
global leadership.”</p>
<p>The Congressional Budget Office warned that U.S. deficits and debt
will grow considerably over the next 30 years, forecasting that the
nation’s $34.5 trillion national debt, which currently represents about
99% of GDP, could grow and rise to 166% of GDP by 2054.</p>
<p>Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he is “hopeful”
Congress can avert a shutdown if Democrats and Republicans in his
chamber work together.</p>
<p>The compressed schedule raised the risk of at least a brief partial
shutdown after a Friday midnight deadline, unless Schumer can reach
agreement with Senate Republicans to expedite the bill.</p>
<p>House Speaker Mike Johnson touted what he called a series of wins for
Republicans, from higher spending for U.S. defense and border security
to a cutoff of U.S. funding for the main United Nations relief agency
that provides humanitarian assistance to Palestinians in Gaza.</p>
<p>“This FY24 appropriations legislation is a serious commitment to
strengthening our national defense by moving the Pentagon toward a focus
on its core mission,” Johnson said in a statement released along with
the text of the legislation.</p>
<p>Democrats said they blocked some Republican cuts and policy measures
and touted funds aimed at lowering childcare costs, supporting small
businesses and fighting the flow of the opioid fentanyl.</p>
<p>“We defeated outlandish cuts that would have been a gut punch for
American families and our economy - and we fought off scores of extreme
policies that would have restricted Americans’ fundamental freedoms,
hurt consumers while giving giant corporations an unfair advantage, and
turned back the clock on historic climate action,” said Murray, the
Democratic chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, Congress narrowly avoided a shutdown that would have
affected agricultural, transportation and environmental programs.</p>
<p>The text unveiled on Thursday fills in the details of an agreement in
principle between Johnson and Schumer, which Democratic President Joe
Biden has pledged to sign into law.</p>
<p>With a slim 219-213 House Republican majority, Johnson will have to
rely on Democratic votes to get the spending bill to the Senate.</p>
<p>Many House Republicans are still expected to oppose the legislation,
including hardliners who want steeper spending cuts.</p>
<p>Besides the departments of Homeland Security and Defense, the bill
would fund agencies including the State Department and the Internal
Revenue Service as it girds for its April 15 taxpayer filing
deadline.</p>

<p>
As computer vision researchers, we believe that every pixel can tell a
story. However, there seems to be a writer’s block settling into the
field when it comes to dealing with large images. Large images are no
longer rare—the cameras we carry in our pockets and those orbiting our
planet snap pictures so big and detailed that they stretch our current
best models and hardware to their breaking points when handling them.
Generally, we face a quadratic increase in memory usage as a function of
image size.
</p>
<p>
Today, we make one of two sub-optimal choices when handling large
images: down-sampling or cropping. These two methods incur significant
losses in the amount of information and context present in an image. We
take another look at these approaches and introduce $x$T, a new
framework to model large images end-to-end on contemporary GPUs while
effectively aggregating global context with local details.

<h2 id="why-bother-with-big-images-anyway">
Why Bother with Big Images Anyway?
</h2>
<p>
Why bother handling large images anyways? Picture yourself in front of
your TV, watching your favorite football team. The field is dotted with
players all over with action occurring only on a small portion of the
screen at a time. Would you be satisified, however, if you could only
see a small region around where the ball currently was? Alternatively,
would you be satisified watching the game in low resolution? Every pixel
tells a story, no matter how far apart they are. This is true in all
domains from your TV screen to a pathologist viewing a gigapixel slide
to diagnose tiny patches of cancer. These images are treasure troves of
information. If we can’t fully explore the wealth because our tools
can’t handle the map, what’s the point?
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="https://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/xt/football.png" width="90%" />
<br /> <i>Sports are fun when you know what’s going on.</i>
</p>
<p>
That’s precisely where the frustration lies today. The bigger the image,
the more we need to simultaneously zoom out to see the whole picture and
zoom in for the nitty-gritty details, making it a challenge to grasp
both the forest and the trees simultaneously. Most current methods force
a choice between losing sight of the forest or missing the trees, and
neither option is great.
</p>
<h2 id="how-xt-tries-to-fix-this">
How $x$T Tries to Fix This
</h2>
<p>
Imagine trying to solve a massive jigsaw puzzle. Instead of tackling the
whole thing at once, which would be overwhelming, you start with smaller
sections, get a good look at each piece, and then figure out how they
fit into the bigger picture. That’s basically what we do with large
images with $x$T.
</p>
<p>
$x$T takes these gigantic images and chops them into smaller, more
digestible pieces hierarchically. This isn’t just about making things
smaller, though. It’s about understanding each piece in its own right
and then, using some clever techniques, figuring out how these pieces
connect on a larger scale. It’s like having a conversation with each
part of the image, learning its story, and then sharing those stories
with the other parts to get the full narrative.
</p>
<h2 id="nested-tokenization">
Nested Tokenization
</h2>
<p>
At the core of $x$T lies the concept of nested tokenization. In simple
terms, tokenization in the realm of computer vision is akin to chopping
up an image into pieces (tokens) that a model can digest and analyze.
However, $x$T takes this a step further by introducing a hierarchy into
the process—hence, <em>nested</em>.
</p>
<p>
Imagine you’re tasked with analyzing a detailed city map. Instead of
trying to take in the entire map at once, you break it down into
districts, then neighborhoods within those districts, and finally,
streets within those neighborhoods. This hierarchical breakdown makes it
easier to manage and understand the details of the map while keeping
track of where everything fits in the larger picture. That’s the essence
of nested tokenization—we split an image into regions, each which can be
split into further sub-regions depending on the input size expected by a
vision backbone (what we call a <em>region encoder</em>), before being
patchified to be processed by that region encoder. This nested approach
allows us to extract features at different scales on a local level.
</p>
<h2 id="coordinating-region-and-context-encoders">
Coordinating Region and Context Encoders
</h2>
<p>
Once an image is neatly divided into tokens, $x$T employs two types of
encoders to make sense of these pieces: the region encoder and the
context encoder. Each plays a distinct role in piecing together the
image’s full story.
</p>
<p>
The region encoder is a standalone “local expert” which converts
independent regions into detailed representations. However, since each
region is processed in isolation, no information is shared across the
image at large. The region encoder can be any state-of-the-art vision
backbone. In our experiments we have utilized hierarchical vision
transformers such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09883">Swin</a>
and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00989">Hiera</a> and also CNNs
such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03545">ConvNeXt</a>!
</p>
<p>
Enter the context encoder, the big-picture guru. Its job is to take the
detailed representations from the region encoders and stitch them
together, ensuring that the insights from one token are considered in
the context of the others. The context encoder is generally a
long-sequence model. We experiment with
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02860">Transformer-XL</a> (and our
variant of it called <em>Hyper</em>) and
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00752">Mamba</a>, though you could
use <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05150">Longformer</a> and other
new advances in this area. Even though these long-sequence models are
generally made for language, we demonstrate that it is possible to use
them effectively for vision tasks.
</p>
<p>
The magic of $x$T is in how these components—the nested tokenization,
region encoders, and context encoders—come together. By first breaking
down the image into manageable pieces and then systematically analyzing
these pieces both in isolation and in conjunction, $x$T manages to
maintain the fidelity of the original image’s details while also
integrating long-distance context the overarching context <strong>while
fitting massive images, end-to-end, on contemporary GPUs</strong>.
</p>
<h2 id="results">
Results
</h2>
<p>
We evaluate $x$T on challenging benchmark tasks that span
well-established computer vision baselines to rigorous large image
tasks. Particularly, we experiment with
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06642">iNaturalist 2018</a> for
fine-grained species classification,
<a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/file/f4d4a021f9051a6c18183b059117e8b5-Paper-Datasets_and_Benchmarks.pdf">xView3-SAR</a>

<br /> <i>Powerful vision models used with $x$T set a new frontier on
downstream tasks such as fine-grained species classification.</i>
</p>
<p>
Our experiments show that $x$T can achieve higher accuracy on all
downstream tasks with fewer parameters while using much less memory per
region than state-of-the-art baselines<sup>*</sup>. We are able to model
images as large as 29,000 x 25,000 pixels large on 40GB A100s while
comparable baselines run out of memory at only 2,800 x 2,800 pixels.

Why This Matters More Than You Think
</h2>
<p>
This approach isn’t just cool; it’s necessary. For scientists tracking
climate change or doctors diagnosing diseases, it’s a game-changer. It
means creating models which understand the full story, not just bits and
pieces. In environmental monitoring, for example, being able to see both
the broader changes over vast landscapes and the details of specific
areas can help in understanding the bigger picture of climate impact. In
healthcare, it could mean the difference between catching a disease
early or not.
</p>
<p>
We are not claiming to have solved all the world’s problems in one go.
We are hoping that with $x$T we have opened the door to what’s possible.
We’re stepping into a new era where we don’t have to compromise on the
clarity or breadth of our vision. $x$T is our big leap towards models
that can juggle the intricacies of large-scale images without breaking a
sweat.
</p>
<p>
There’s a lot more ground to cover. Research will evolve, and hopefully,
so will our ability to process even bigger and more complex images. In
fact, we are working on follow-ons to $x$T which will expand this
frontier further.

I would not have chosen Mr. Arthur Saginian, a self-proclaimed agnostic,
to provide Biblical interpretation. His letter (March 15) is based on
the premise that Pope Francis has allowed priests to bless same-sex
couples, which he mistakenly asserts allows priests to bless same-sex
marriage. He then proceeds to assert that Jesus set aside the Torah, […]

Mississippi Deputy Sentenced to 40 Years in Torture of 2 Black Men</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>jackson, mississippi — A fourth former Mississippi sheriff’s deputy
was sentenced Wednesday to 40 years in federal prison for his part in
the racist torture of two Black men by a group of white officers who
called themselves the “Goon Squad.”</p>
<p>Christian Dedmon, 29, did not look at the victims as he apologized
and said he’d never forgive himself for the pain he caused. </p>
<p>All six former officers charged in the case pleaded guilty last year,
admitting that they subjected Michael Corey Jenkins and Eddie Terrell
Parker to numerous acts of racist torture in January 2023 after a
neighbor complained the men were staying in a home with a white woman.
Prosecutors said Dedmon slapped the men with a sex toy and threatened to
brutalize them with it.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Tom Lee said Wednesday that Dedmon carried out
the most “shocking, brutal and cruel attacks imaginable” against Jenkins
and Parker and against a white man during a traffic stop weeks
earlier.</p>
<p>Jenkins, who still has trouble speaking because of his injuries, said
in a statement read by his lawyer that Dedmon’s actions were the most
depraved of any of those who attacked him.</p>
<p>“Deputy Dedmon is the worst example of a police officer in the United
States,” Jenkins said. “Deputy Dedmon was the most aggressive, sickest
and the most wicked.”</p>
<p>Hours before Dedmon’s sentencing, former Officer Daniel Opdyke, 28,
cried profusely as he spoke before the judge announced his sentence of
17.5 years. Turning to look at the two victims, Opdyke said isolation
behind bars has given him time to reflect on “how I transformed into the
monster I became that night.”</p>
<p>“The weight of my actions and the harm I’ve caused will haunt me
every day,” Opdyke told them. “I wish I could take away your
suffering.”</p>
<p>Parker rested his head in his hands and closed his eyes, then stood
and left the courtroom before Opdyke finished speaking. Jenkins said he
was “broken” and left “ashamed” by the cruel acts inflicted upon
him.</p>
<p>The judge said Opdyke might not have been fully aware of what being a
member of the Goon Squad entailed when Lieutenant Jeffrey Middleton
asked him to join, but he did know it involved using excessive
force.</p>
<p>“You were not a passive observer,” Lee said. “You actively
participated in that brutal attack.”</p>
<p>All six former officers pleaded guilty last year of breaking into a
home without a warrant and torturing the Black men with a stun gun, a
sex toy and other objects.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Lee gave a nearly 20-year prison sentence to Hunter
Elward, 31, and a 17.5-year sentence to Middleton, 46, calling their
actions “egregious and despicable.” They, like Opdyke and Dedmon, worked
as Rankin County sheriff’s deputies during the attack.</p>
<p>Another former deputy, Brett McAlpin, 53, and a former Richland
police officer, Joshua Hartfield, 32, are set for sentencing
Thursday.</p>
<p>Last March, months before federal prosecutors announced charges in
August, an investigation by The Associated Press linked some of the
deputies to at least four violent encounters with Black men since 2019
that left two dead and another with lasting injuries. </p>
<p>The former officers stuck to their cover story for months until
finally admitting that they tortured Michael Corey Jenkins and Parker.
Elward admitted to shoving a gun into Jenkins’ mouth and firing it in a
“mock execution” that went awry.</p>
<p>After Elward shot Jenkins in the mouth, lacerating his tongue and
breaking his jaw, the officers devised a cover-up that included planting
drugs and a gun. False charges stood against Jenkins and Parker for
months.</p>

MiniBook X (2023): a lot of laptop for very little money</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-20, from: OS News</p>
<p>What if the kind of laptop you’re looking for just isn’t available
from any of the major or even minor manufacturers? You know exactly what
you want out of a laptop, and while quite a few fulfill many of your
requirements, the requirement that matters most just isn’t being made.
It’s not a case of “too expensive” or “too cheap” – simply nobody will
sell it to you. From HP, Dell, Apple, down to smaller and local OEMs,
none of them can serve your particular set of needs. For me, that
particular requirement, that particular need is that of the laptop with
an 8″ to 10″ screen size. Even the most portable laptops sold by
well-known brands today stop at 13″, often even 14″, with nowhere to go
but up. I currently have a 13.3″ laptop – an otherwise excellent XPS 13
9370 with a gorgeous 4K display – but as much as I love it, it’s just
too big and heavy for me. I want something smaller, no bigger than
roughly 10″. Why? Well, I use my laptop in exactly two locations: on the
couch in one of our two living rooms, or in bed (okay that’s technically
three locations). That’s it. I work from home on my workstation, I play
games on my gaming PC, so I don’t need big performance on the road, nor
do I need a big portable display to make working on the go bearable. On
top of all this, I have two small kids running around the house, so a
laptop that is easier to quickly close and put out of harm’s way is very
welcome. And considering the most intensive workload it’ll ever have to
contend with is playing YouTube video, I don’t need the latest Core i7
or Apple M3 either. Why not a tablet, then? First and foremost, I want
to use a desktop operating system, not Android or iOS, since writing
OSNews posts or doing a quick translation for my job are not fun
experiences on mobile operating systems. On top of that, a tablet with a
keyboard accessory often makes use of a kickstand and flappy keyboard,
which are cumbersome to use on the couch, in bed, or on your lap. The
exception here would be the iPad with a Magic Keyboard, but that’s an
incredibly expensive affair and an Apple product, so obviously a no-go.
Luckily, while the kind of small laptop I’m looking for is not available
from one of the major OEMs, there are a small number of specialised OEMs
that do focus on making small laptops. Roughly, the devices they make
fall into one of three pricing categories. First, there’s the high-end –
these usually start at around €800 or so and get well over €1000, and
have a decent set of specs, often focused on gaming by opting for AMD
APUs. A major player in this market is GPD, who’ve been offering
products in this segment for years, and are actually a decently
well-known brand at this point, even being featured on major YouTube
channels like Linus Tech Tips. Then there’s the very low end, a market
segment drowning in the exact same 7″ laptop priced at €250 or so, sold
under a variety of brand names, sporting the same low-end Celeron chip
and rather crappy display. It’s also quite thick, made out of cheap
plastic, and every review I’ve seen of these are not particularly
positive. Unless you know what you’re getting into, do not buy these.
They’re e-waste trash. In recent times, however, a middle segment has
slowly started to take shape, coming in price points in between the low
and high end, with reasonable specifications and build quality, without
going overboard. This was exactly what I was looking for. Aside from
price and specifications, mini-laptops also come in a variety of
different input layouts. Being smaller than other laptops, some
compromises will have to be made, and it’s this particular aspect that
will most likely play a major role in which models appeal to you. The
gaming-focused mini laptops will often come with dual joysticks and face
buttons, while other models will come with a more traditional keyboard
and trackpad, and the smallest laptops in this category ditch the
trackpad in favour of a little sensor pad in the top-right of the
keyboard, or a ThinkPad-style nipple. Having kept and eye on this market
for years now, I knew exactly what I was looking for: I wanted a
traditional keyboard and touchpad layout, with medium specifications, a
capable display, and all-metal construction, for no more than roughly
€400-500. Clearly, the time to strike was now, as the small,
budget-oriented OEM Chuwi had just updated its 10″ mini laptop with
Intel’s latest low-power processor, the N100. The Chuwi Minibook X
(2023), as it’s called, has an all-aluminium construction, and comes
with quite decent specifications, and I managed to snag a new model
through their eBay store for a mere €320 (I asked them for a discount
down from €400 , and they gave it; I did not mention who I was or that I
run OSNews). It has the aforementioned Alder Lake Intel N100 – released
earlier this year, it’s an Intel 7 processor with 4 cores and 4 threads
(so no hyperthreading) with a maximum turbo frequency of 3.4 Ghz, with a
TDP of just 6 W. It’s not going to compare well to the various Core
i3/i5/i7 processors, of course, but considering the type of device, it
makes perfect sense to opt for something like the N100. Furthermore,
this device is packing 12 GB of LPDDR5 RAM running at 4800 Mhz, and my
model comes with a 512 GB SSD. The display is a 10.3″ panel with a
native resolution of 1920×1200, with a refresh rate of only 50Hz
(although some people managed to reach 60Hz and even 90Hz), and support
for touch. Ports-wise, it has two USB-C ports (one marked as compatible
with charging – I haven’t dared</p>

a proposal years in the making for a 31-acre property in Wiley Canyon,
alongside Interstate 5, between Hawkbryn Avenue and Calgrove Boulevard. 
Dubbed the Wiley Canyon Mixed Use Project — a name criticized for a mix
of 668,000 square feet of housing to 9,000 […]

Quietly Trump-Proofing Its EV Rules</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-20, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTc5NTAwOC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcxNjYyOTk5N30.eb9S1ytIhBhhTMlzic9aDVBhP0g9KoyJyQ2LAkI6wLU/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Even as the Environmental Protection Agency was preparing to release
federal
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/epa-auto-emissions-rule" target="_blank">tailpipe
emissions rules</a> that will steer more U.S. drivers into electric
vehicles, California was working in the background to harden its own,
more stringent emissions standards.
</p>
<p>
On Tuesday, the state announced an agreement with Stellantis, the
automaking conglomerate that contains the Chrysler, Jeep, Dodge, and Ram
brands to comply with more restrictive tailpipe emissions rules through
2026. California also said Stellantis would go along with its
electrification mandates through 2030 — regardless of whether either is
struck down by federal regulators or the courts.
</p>
<p>
The agreement is part of California’s effort to preserve its ability to
set emissions standards and mandate electrification even with a hostile
White House and judicial branch. By trying to get enough of the industry
to agree to its rules voluntarily and not join any effort that may arise
to throw them out, it hopes either to preserve its rule-making ability
or, in the worst case scenario, leverage the industry’s desire for
predictability to keep the rules themselves intact.
</p>
<p>
David Clegern, public information officer at the California Air
Resources Board, told me there was no connection between Tuesday’s
agreement and today’s EPA announcement. The deal “gives Stellantis
flexibility in how they meet California’s existing greenhouse gas
emissions vehicle requirements,” he said. In exchange, the state gets an
even deeper emissions cut than it would otherwise — some 10 million
extra tons of foregone greenhouse gas emissions.
</p>
<p>
<del>
</del>
Stellantis also agreed “not to oppose California’s authority under the
Clean Air Act for its greenhouse gas emissions and zero-emissions
vehicle standards,” the California Air Resources Board said in its
announcement of the agreement.
</p>
<p>
California has long had the ability to set its own emissions standards
thanks to the structure of the Clean Air Act and a waiver from the EPA.
California got some automakers to agree to a version of Obama-era
tailpipe emissions rules in the summer of 2019 that the Trump
administration had
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/25/climate/automakers-rejecting-trump-pollution-rule-strike-a-deal-with-california.html" target="_blank">planned
on scrapping</a>, after which Trump officials
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/17/climate/trump-california-emissions-waiver.html" target="_blank">revoked
California’s ability to set emissions rules</a>. California finalized
its agreement with the automakers the following year, then regained its
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/09/climate/biden-california-tailpipe-waiver.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">authority
to set emissions rules</a> in 2022.
</p>
<p>
The principle behind the Stellantis deal is similar to those earlier
agreements, Clegern said. Stellantis had been on the outside looking in
on California’s deals with automakers, and late last year initiated an
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-06/stellantis-petitions-to-void-california-auto-emissions-agreement" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">administrative
process</a> to try to get them thrown out. (It was unsuccessful.) Now,
the company has agreed not only to implement emissions and
electrification rules, but also to invest in electrification in the
state by spending $4 million on charging infrastructure in California
and $6 million in states that also adopt California’s emissions rules.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, the EPA is working on a new waiver process for California’s
electrification standards, which would need to be completed before the
end of this year to both avoid interference from a potential incoming
Republican administration and to make sure it applies on the
<a href="https://www.sierraclub.org/press-releases/2024/01/advocates-across-country-urge-epa-issue-clean-air-act-waiver-life-saving" target="_blank">schedule
the state has set out</a>, Kathy Harris, clean vehicles director at the
Natural Resources Defense Council, told me. The rules, known as the
Advanced Clean Car Standard II regulations, start with the
<a href="https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/our-work/programs/advanced-clean-cars-program/advanced-clean-cars-ii" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2026
model year and apply through 2035</a> and mandate that all new car sales
in the state be electric by the middle of the 2030s.
</p>
<p>
About a dozen other states so far have adopted the ACC II standards,
including Massachusetts, New York, and Oregon<strong>.</strong>
<strong><em></em></strong>
</p>
<p>
Many commenters on the EPA car emission proposal set out the California
rules as a model for what the agency should do. “Vehicle manufacturers
also commented that they had extensive collaboration with the California
Air Resources Board (CARB) during the development of CARB’s recently
finalized Advanced Clean Car II (ACC II) standards,” according to the
final rule, “and industry broadly recommended that EPA adopt the ACC II
program in lieu of our proposed standards.”
</p>
<p>
In the end, the EPA rules follow a different model than the California
standards, Harris said. Crucially, the EPA isn’t mandating
electrification. In remarks at a White House even on Wednesday, EPA
administrator Michael Regan emphasized that they were instead technology
neutral and performance based, meaning that they
<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/epa-issues-new-rules-aimed-cutting-carbon-emissions-108313335" target="_blank">leave
it up to the automakers</a> to figure out how to comply.
</p>
<p>
David Reichmuth, the senior engineer in the Union of Concerned
Scientists’ clean transportation program, told me that, compared to
California’s, the EPA rules “are distinct in what they regulate and how
they regulate vehicles,” he told me. Nevertheless, “they are pulling in
the same direction in trying to reduce emissions from transportation and
air pollution from vehicles.”
</p>
<p>
California’s ability to set its own emissions rules is not just likely
to be questioned by a Republican administration should Donald Trump win
in 2025, it also could be at risk in the courts. Ohio and other states
with Republican attorneys general
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/auto-week-at-d-c-circuit-raises-major-questions-for-epa/" target="_blank">sued
the EPA</a> in 2022 over the existence of the California waiver in a
case that was heard by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals last fall. The
ruling is still pending.<strong></strong>

<h2 id="gnome-46-released">GNOME 46 released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-20, from: OS News</p>
<p>GNOME 46 has been released, and its packs a ton of new features and
improvements. One of the headline improvements is the new global search
feature. Files comes with a new global search feature in GNOME 46. The
feature is simple: activate it by clicking the new search button, or by
using the Ctrl+Shift+F shortcut, then enter your query to search all
your configured search locations. Global search is a great way to jump
directly into search, without having to think about where the items you
want are located. The new feature also leverages GNOME’s existing file
search capabilities, including the ability to search the contents of
files, and filter by file type and modification date. ↫ GNOME 46 release
notes GNOME 46 also brings experimental support for variable refresh
rate in Mutter, GNOME’s window manager, the Files application has seen a
lot of work to drastically improve performance, the Settings application
has been reworked, OneDrive support has been added to online accounts,
and much more. Remote login has also been greatly improved. GNOME’s
remote desktop experience has been significantly enhanced for version
46, with the introduction of a new dedicated remote login option. This
allows remotely connecting to a GNOME system which is not already in
use. Connecting in this way means that the system’s display can be
configured from the remote side, resulting in a better experience for
the remote user. GNOME 46 will make it to your distribution of choice
over the coming weeks and months.</p>

<h2 id="i-was-a-hackintosher">I was a Hackintosher</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-20, from: Liam on Linux</p>
<p>
I can’t speak for anyone else but I can tell you why I did it.
</p>
<p>
I was broke, I know PCs and Macs and Mac OS X – I ran OS X 10.0, 10.1
and 10.2 on a PowerMac 7600 using
<a href="https://www.macintoshrepository.org/10291-xpostfacto" rel="ugc">XPostFacto</a>.
</p>
<p>
I got the carcase of a Core 2 Extreme PC on my local Freecycle group in
2012.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://twitter.com/lproven/status/257060672825851904" rel="ugc">https://twitter.com/lproven/status/257060672825851904</a>
</p>
<p>
RAM, no hard disks, no graphics, but case/mobo/CPU/PSU etc.
</p>
<p>
I took the nVidia card and hard disks from my old Athlon XP. I got the
machine running, and thought it was worth a try since it was mostly
Intel: Intel chipset, Intel CPU, etc.
</p>
<p>
I joined some fora, did some reading, used Clover and some tools from
<a href="https://www.tonymacx86.com/" rel="ugc">TonyMacX86</a> and so
on.
</p>
<p>
After two days’ work it booted. I got no sound from my SoundBlaster
card, so I pulled it, turned the motherboard sound back on, and
reinstalled.
</p>
<p>
It was a learning experience but it worked very well. I ran Snow Leopard
on it, as it was old enough to get no new updates that would break my
Hack, but new enough that all the modern browsers and things worked
fine. (2012 was the year Mountain Lion came out, so I was 2 versions
behind, which suited me fine – and it ran PowerPC apps, and I preferred
the UI of the PowerPC version of MS Word, my only non-freeware app.)
</p>
<p>
I had 4 CPU cores, it was maxed out with 8GB RAM, and it was nice and
quick. As it was a desktop, I disabled all support for sleep and
hibernation: I turn my desktops off at night to save power. It drove a
matched pair of 21” CRT monitors perfectly smoothly. I had an Apple
Extended keyboard on an ADB-to-USB convertor since my PS/2 ports weren’t
supported.
</p>
<p>
It wasn’t totally reliable – occasionally it failed to boot, but a power
cycle usually brought it back. It was fast and pretty stable, it ran all
the OS X FOSS apps I usually used, it was much quicker than my various
elderly PowerMacs and the hardware cost was essentially £0.
</p>
<p>
It was more pleasant to use than Linux – my other machines back then ran
the still-somewhat-new Ubuntu, using GNOME 2 because Unity hadn’t gone
mainstream yet.
</p>
<p>
Summary: why not? It worked, it gave me a very nice and perfectly usable
desktop PC for next to no cost except some time, it was quite
educational, and the machine served me well for years. I still have it
in a basement. Sadly its main HDD is not readable any more.
</p>
<p>
It was fun, interesting, and the end result was very usable. At that
time there was no way I could have afforded to buy an Intel Mac, but a
few years, one emigration and 2 new jobs later, I did so: a 2011 i5 Mac
mini which is now my TV-streaming box, but which I used as my main
machine until 2017 when I bought a 27” Retina iMac from a friend.
</p>
<p>
Cost, curiosity, learning. All good reasons in my book.
</p>
<p>
This year I Hacked an old Dell Latitude E7270, a Core i7 machine maxed
out with 16GB RAM – with Big Sur because its Intel GPU isn’t supported
in the Monterey I tried at first. It works, but its wifi doesn’t, and I
needed to buy a USB wifi dongle. But performance wasn’t great, it took
an age to boot with a lot of scary text going past, and it didn’t feel
like a smooth machine. So, I pulled its SSD and put a smaller one in,
put ChromeOS Flex on it, and it’s now my wife’s main computer. Fast,
simple, totally reliable, and now I have spare Wifi dongle. :-/ I may
try on one of my old Thinkpads next.
</p>
<p>
It is <em>much</em> easier to Hackintosh a PC today than it was 10-12
years ago, but Apple is making the experience less rewarding, as is
their right. They are a hardware company.<br /><br />(Repurposed from a

id="biden-administration-unveils-strict-auto-standards-to-speed-electric-shift">Biden
Administration Unveils Strict Auto Standards to Speed Electric
Shift</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — President Joe Biden’s administration announced Wednesday
revised pollution standards for cars and trucks meant to accelerate the
U.S. auto industry’s shift to electric to mitigate climate change.</p>
<p>The rules set ambitious emission reductions for 2032 but are
moderated somewhat compared with preliminary standards unveiled last
April. Following carmaker criticism, the final rules give manufacturers
greater flexibility and ease the benchmarks in the first three
years.</p>
<p>Those shifts were criticized as a sop to corporations from at least
one environmental group, even as the final rule won praise from other
leading NGOs focused on climate change.</p>
<p>The final rules — which were described by administration official as
“the strongest ever” and would likely be undone if Republican Donald
Trump defeats Biden in November — still require a nearly 50% drop in
fleet-wide emissions in 2032 compared with 2026 through increased sales
of electric vehicles (EVs) and low-emission autos.</p>
<p>The rules, which dovetail with other key Biden programs to build more
EV charging stations and manufacturing facilities and incentivize EV
sales, establish the environment as a significant point of difference in
the 2024 presidential election.</p>
<p>Trump has mocked climate change as a problem and cast the transition
to EVs as a job-killer that will benefit China at the expense of
American workers.</p>
<p>Biden argues that U.S. auto builders need to take the lead in the
expanding EV market.</p>
<p>“I brought together American automakers. I brought together American
autoworkers,” said Biden in a statement. “Together, we’ve made historic
progress.”</p>
<p>Alluding to his target set three years ago that 50% of new vehicles
in 2030 would be EVs, Biden predicted “we’ll meet my goal for 2030 and
race forward in the years ahead.”</p>
<p>EVs accounted for 7.6% in 2023 sales, up from 5.9% in 2022, according
to Cox Automotive.</p>
<p>The original proposal had envisioned the EV share surging to as much
as 67% of new vehicle sales by 2032.</p>
<p>Carmakers, which are midway through sweeping, multi-billion-dollar
investments to build more EV capacity, criticized the initial standards
as overly-stringent. They cited the limited state of charging capacity
in the United States that has dampened consumer demand, as well as
difficulties in supply of metals and other raw materials for EV
batteries.</p>
<p>Following input from the auto industry, organized labor and auto
dealerships, Biden administration officials decided to allow
manufacturers a “variety of pathways” to reaching the standard, a senior
Biden administration official said Tuesday.</p>
<p>This path could include a mix of EVs, conventional but more
fuel-efficient engines, and plug-in hybrid vehicles, which have seen a
rise in demand of late.</p>
<p>Biden administration officials opted to soften year-to-year emissions
improvements in the 2027-2030 period, while maintaining the same target
in 2032.</p>
<p>Moderating the targets in these first three years “was the right
call,” said John Bozzella, president of the Alliance for Automotive
Innovation, a Washington lobby representing carmakers.</p>
<p>“These adjusted EV targets — still a stretch goal — should give the
market and supply chains a chance to catch up,” said Bozzella, adding
that the extra time will allow more EV charging stations to come
on-line.</p>
<p>The final standards set a fleet-wide target of 85 grams of carbon
dioxide in 2032, down from 170 in 2027, according to an administration
fact sheet.</p>
<p>Wednesday’s initiative won praise from leading environmental groups
including the Sierra Club and NRDC, which said the new rules “take us in
the right direction,” according to a statement from the Natural
Resources Defense Council chief Manish Bapna.</p>
<p>But Dan Becker, director of the climate transport campaign at the
Center for Biological Diversity, slammed the adjusted rules as
“significantly weaker.”</p>
<p>“The EPA caved to pressure from Big Auto, Big Oil and car dealers and
riddled the plan with loopholes big enough to drive a Ford F150
through,” Becker said.</p>
<p>“The weaker rule means cars and pickups spew more pollution, oil
companies keep socking consumers at the pump, and automakers keep
wielding well-practiced delay tactics.”</p>

<h2 id="trusting-content-on-the-kde-store">Trusting content on the KDE
Store</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-20, from: OS News</p>
<p>A global theme on the KDE third party store had an issue where it
executed a script that removed user’s data. It wasn’t intended as
malicious, but a mistake in some shell parsing. It was promptly
identified and removed, but not before doing some damage to that user.
This has started a lot of discourse around the concept of the store,
security and upstream KDE. With the main question how can a theme have
access to do this? ↫ David Edmundson That ‘some damage’ was personal
data loss, which is quite something to happen after installing a theme.
KDE kind of shot itself in the foot here by having something called
‘global themes’, which is a combination of themes for various elements
of the desktop, like the application style, icon theme, cursor theme,
colour scheme, and so on, but also things like panel layout and even
widgets, applets, and other things that can run code. Some of these
global themes use shell scripts to implement the more advanced aspects
of their themes, and all these things combined means that global themes
installed through KDE’s own built-in theme installer can cause some
serious damage. The problem is getting some attention now, and I hope
they can find a way to make this process more transparent for end users,
so people know what they’re getting themselves into. I’m not advocating
for dumbing all this stuff down – this isn’t iOS or whatever – but

Get Window to US Chinese Exclusion Act Era</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Seattle — The National Archives at Seattle keeps 50,000 records from
the Chinese Exclusion Act era that banned Chinese laborers from
immigrating to the United States. Volunteers working on the documents
find stories of resilience and some find details of their family’s
past.</p>
<p>A group of volunteers has been gathering each week at the Seattle
archives to index thousands of documents from the Chinese Exclusion Act
years. Volunteers say they never know what kind of drama the files will
reveal. It may be an intrusive questioning of a woman about her
pregnancy, or a letter from a husband to the detention center
authorities, asking to transfer money to his wife.</p>
<p>“No, they’re not happy, but at least the story is there,” said
genealogist and historian Trish Hackett Nicola. She has been
volunteering with the National Archives project for more than 20 years,
sharing some of the stories on the project’s blog.</p>
<p>The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 suspended the immigration of
Chinese laborers to the United States and prevented those already in the
country from becoming naturalized citizens. It was repealed in 1943. The
National Archives at Seattle holds more than 50,000 files spanning over
60 years, documenting Chinese people entering or leaving the
country.</p>
<p>“Immigration did interrogations, which obviously changed over the
course of the exclusion period,” said Valerie Szwaya, director of
archival operations at the National Archives at Seattle. “And they got
substantially more detailed as the time period for exclusion went
on.”</p>
<p>Volunteer Rhonda Farrar was motivated to join the project to resolve
mysteries in her own family’s past. As she works with the files, she
discovers that sometimes the questions are intrusive, she said, and
sometimes they are mundane.</p>
<p>“They’ll ask you how many mirrors you have in the house back home in
China, where you sleep, and where do you keep your rice,” Farrar
said.</p>
<p>Sometimes, they are about family.</p>
<p>Farrar’s father, Edwin Law, died when she was a teenager. She found a
file on him as she was working on a file from the last years of the Act.
The file misspelled his name as “Low Yow Edwin.” He was interrogated at
the beginning of World War II as he left the U.S. to serve as a
fighter-pilot mechanic in China’s military. Finding his file came as a
surprise.</p>
<p>“My job that day was just to go through the file and input the name
that I saw on the header into the computer,” she said. “This file was
sitting on the very end of this box. I thought, ‘That looks kind of
close to my dad’s name.’ I opened it up and there was a picture of him,
at age 23, staring me in the face. I physically started shaking, I had
tears, it was just unbelievable. It really helped to bring everything
together for me.”</p>
<p>Lily Eng found the files of several family members, including her
great-grandfather, who went by the name of “Hop Lee.”</p>
<p>“We had no pictures; my grandfather never spoke about him,” Eng said.
“Only after I got the immigration files, I realized that my
great-grandfather had died in 1918, so my grandfather had never met him.
His father had returned to America before my grandfather was born.”</p>
<p>Joyce Liu, who joined the project as a volunteer a year ago, said the
stories revealed through the files made her appreciate the resilience of
the earlier generation of Chinese people who came to America.</p>
<p>“I look at the tidbits of their lives, and it looks tough,” she said.
“An arrival form of a mom who came back with her son from China that
says that her son died on board of the ship … I was shocked. I mean, the
mom must be devastated. It also dawned on me, how long was that voyage
from the southern China to Seattle?”</p>
<p>Liu sees the Chinese people who arrived in America during the Chinese
Exclusion Act period as pioneers.</p>
<p>“The history can really help us put things in perspective as a
Chinese American here, and I just hope that history doesn’t repeat
itself,” she said.</p>

<h2 id="us-sanctions-russian-firms-over-fake-websites">US Sanctions
Russian Firms Over ‘Fake Websites’</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The U.S. Treasury Department imposed sanctions Wednesday
against two people and their Russia-based companies it accused of
supporting a Kremlin-directed disinformation campaign involving the
impersonation of legitimate news websites.</p>
<p>The sanctions targeted Moscow-based company Social Design Agency and
its founder, Ilya Andreevich Gambashidze, as well as the Russian-based
Company Group Structura and its owner, Nikolai Aleksandrovich Tupikin,
according to a statement from the Treasury Department.</p>
<p>On behalf of the Russian government, they handled a network of more
than 60 websites that mimicked media organizations and used fake social
media accounts to amplify their content, the statement said.</p>
<p>“The fake websites appeared to have been built to carefully mimic the
appearance of legitimate news websites,” the Treasury Department
said.</p>
<p>“The fake websites included embedded images and working links to
legitimate sites.”</p>
<p>The sanctions come amid heightened tensions between Washington and
Moscow over Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, now in its third
year.</p>
<p>The United States has repeatedly accused Moscow of orchestrating what
it calls global “malign influence campaigns” aimed at sowing instability
in democratic countries.</p>
<p>Last October, a U.S. intelligence report said Russia was using its
spy network, state-run media and social media to undermine public trust
in elections around the world.</p>
<p>The United States shared the report with some 100 countries.</p>
<p>“We are committed to exposing Russia’s extensive campaigns of
government-directed deception, which are intended to mislead voters and
undermine trust in democratic institutions in the United States and
around the world,” Brian E. Nelson, under-secretary of the Treasury for
terrorism and financial intelligence, was quoted as saying in
Wednesday’s statement.</p>
<p>U.S.-based disinformation researchers say hundreds of sites mimicking
news outlets — powered by artificial intelligence — have cropped up in
recent months, fueling an explosion of false narratives, about subjects
ranging from war to politicians.</p>
<p>That includes several Russian-linked websites mimicking news outlets
and pushing Kremlin propaganda ahead of the U.S. presidential election
in November, according to researchers at Clemson University and the
watchdog organization NewsGuard.</p>

In the world of electric bikes, the words “carbon fiber” usually means
big bucks. Actually, it’s the same in the pedal bike industry, it’s just
that e-bikes already start out more expensive. That means carbon fiber
electric bikes have always commanded premium prices – at least, until
now. When Ride1Up rolled out the new

the electric gravel bike market with a reasonably priced

by US to Crack Down on TikTok Spark Backlash Against Israel</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The initial backlash came quickly.</p>
<p>Within hours of last week’s vote in the House of Representatives
approving legislation that could lead to a ban of the popular TikTok app
in the United States, anger and outrage poured onto multiple social
media platforms.</p>
<p>Some of the anger targeted U.S. lawmakers who supported the bill.
Some focused on China.</p>
<p>And a number of social media accounts, some with large followings,
put the blame on Israel and pro-Jewish groups in the United States.</p>
<p>“A foreign government is influencing the 2024 election,” Briahna Joy
Gray posted on X.</p>
<p>“I’m not talking about China, but Israel,” added the former national
press secretary for Senator Bernie Sanders’ 2020 presidential
campaign.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Jake Shields, a former mixed martial arts fighter who has used social
media in the past to share his views on transgender issues, blamed the
Anti-Defamation League and the American Israel Public Affairs Committee,
or AIPAC.</p>
<p>“The ADL said Tiktok Is a threat to Israel,” Shields posted on X.
“AIPAC the Israeli lobby gave Dan Crebsahaw [sic] millions of dollars
Now Crenshaw fights to ban TikTok.”</p>
<p>And journalist Glenn Greenwald said on X that the TikTok legislation
gained momentum only after “Bipartisan DC became enraged so many
Americans were allowed to criticize Israel” using the TikTok app.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Other posts and videos were quickly shared across other major
platforms, including TikTok and Facebook.</p>
<p>U.S. officials contacted by VOA said the rush by some social media
users to blame Israel or Jewish groups was not a surprise.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, there are antisemitic people in America who will
blame Israel and the Jewish people for anything, even Congress banning a
Chinese-controlled app,” Republican Senator Marco Rubio said in a
statement to VOA.</p>
<p>“Their love for TikTok is no coincidence; it’s a tool used by the
Chinese Communist Party to sow division and weaken our nation,” said
Rubio, the vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee and a
supporter of the legislation. “We can debate Middle East policy, but we
must not tolerate hate or allow Communist China to manipulate our
discourse.”</p>
<p>The FBI, which has warned repeatedly over the last several months
both about the danger of TikTok and about a rising tide of antisemitism
across the country, declined to comment, pointing to comments made by
Director Christopher Wray at congressional hearings earlier this
month.</p>
<p>“Americans need to ask themselves whether they want to give the
Chinese government the ability to control access to their data, whether
they want to give the Chinese government the ability to control the
information they get through their recommendation algorithm,” Wray told
House lawmakers during the annual Worldwide Threats hearing last
week.</p>
<p>“When it comes to the algorithm and the recommendation algorithm and
the ability to conduct influence operations, that is extraordinarily
difficult to detect,” Wray added.</p>
<p>Researchers who track influence operations on social media, while
wary, tell VOA that they have yet to see evidence that the spread of
conspiracy theories blaming Israel or Jewish groups for the TikTok
legislation is part of a concerted campaign.</p>
<p>“The period after 10/7 [Hamas terror attack on Israel] made clear
that antisemitic conspiracies can spread rapidly across TikTok just by
the nature of the platform’s algorithm, so no external coordination
would be required as an explanation,” said Ben Dubow, president of
Washington-based Omelas, which uses a combination of data collection,
artificial intelligence and experts to track and analyze online
disinformation and influence operations.</p>
<p>Dubow did not rule out the possibility that TikTok’s parent company,
ByteDance, could be giving the anti-Israel and antisemitic posts more
play if the Chinese government thought it might be helpful.</p>
<p>“The scant research available on TikTok’s algorithm often suggests
ByteDance privileges content favorable to CCP [Chinese Communist Party]
policy goals,” he said.</p>
<p>Omelas also found the conspiracy theories received some attention
from other media outlets, including Russia-controlled RT and Qatar-based
Al Jazeera.</p>
<p>“We’re seeing a few posts from RT and Al Jazeera tying the renewed
push for a ban to TikTok’s role in the spread of ‘anti-Zionism’ in
response to October 7,” Dubow said. “But none tying it explicitly to
AIPAC and ADL.”</p>
<p>Geoff Roth, a professor of practice and journalism at the University
of Houston, agreed the surge of social media posts echoing the
Israel-TikTok narrative appeared to be “more organic.”</p>
<p>“The Israel conspiracy theory, as I like to put it, just seems to be
coming from people who in general post stuff that is anti-Israeli and
pro-Palestinian,” he told VOA.</p>
<p>“It comes from different sides of the political spectrum,” Roth said.
“But I think there’s people on both sides of the political spectrum that
have a lot of anti-Israeli sentiment because of what’s going on in
Gaza.”</p>
<p>Roth also noted that the theory tying the TikTok legislation to
Israel and Jewish groups, while possibly the most prominent, is not the
only narrative that gained traction following the bill’s passage in the
House.</p>
<p>“There’s the narrative of security and concerns about the
[Chinese]Communist Party and whether or not that [the legislation] is
justified,” he said. “And then sort of the more far out things out there
like, this is a Republican plot to get younger voters to be against
Biden because if Biden signed it into law, he’s going to lose votes from
younger people.”</p>
<p>One account on X pushing the Republican plot theory called the TikTok
legislation “another trick.”</p>
<p>A second X account added, “I’d wager Republicans who just voted for a
TikTok Ban will rename it the ’Biden Ban the moment he signs it and
within weeks that will be the official name and all anyone
remembers.”</p>

Allows Trump to Appeal Ruling Keeping DA on Georgia Election Case</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ATLANTA, GEORGIA — The judge overseeing the Georgia election
interference case is allowing Donald Trump to appeal a ruling letting
Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis remain on the
prosecution. </p>
<p>Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee on Wednesday granted a request by
defense attorneys to ask the Georgia Court of Appeals to review the
judge’s decision. It’s now up to the appeals court to decide whether the
court will hear it. </p>
<p>McAfee in a ruling last week denied the defense’s request to
disqualify Willis from the case or dismiss the indictment over her
romantic relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade. The judge
said Willis can remain on the case if Wade resigns, which Wade did on
Friday. </p>
<p>But the judge also rebuked Willis for her “tremendous” lapse in
judgment and questioned the truthfulness of Wade’s and her testimony
about the timing of their relationship. </p>
<p>Wade’s resignation allowed Willis to remain on the most sprawling of
four criminal cases against the presumptive Republican nominee in the
2024 presidential election. </p>
<p>But the long-term damage to the public perception of the prosecution
remains unclear, particularly considering Trump’s relentless barrage of
attacks on the pair who pledged to hold Trump accountable but found
their own actions under a public microscope. </p>
<p>Wade offered his resignation in a letter to Willis, saying he was
doing so “in the interest of democracy, in dedication to the American
public and to move this case forward as quickly as possible.” </p>
<p>“I will always remember — and will remind everyone — that you were
brave enough to step forward and take on the investigation and
prosecution of the allegations that the defendants in this case engaged
in a conspiracy to overturn Georgia’s 2020 Presidential Election,”
Willis wrote. </p>
<p>Trump’s team felt differently. </p>
<p>In a social media post, Trump said the “Fani Willis lover” had
“resigned in disgrace,” and Trump repeated his assertion that the case
is an effort to hurt his campaign to reclaim the White House in
November. Trump has denied doing anything wrong and pleaded not
guilty. </p>
<p>Attorneys for Trump and the other defendants had said a failure to
remove Willis could imperil any convictions and force a retrial if an
appeals court later finds it was warranted. </p>
<p>“Neither the Court nor the Parties should run an unnecessary risk of
having to go through that process more than once,” they wrote.</p>

<h2 id="the-epas-final-auto-emission-rules-are-out">The EPA’s Final Auto
Emission Rules Are Out</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-20, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTc4MDk4Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1NDY3ODQ1OX0.kH9Q3K9socwxDcPz9_tACQ7D7YsCke4bJnWfgeTxFFU/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
The Biden administration announced final new emissions standards for
cars on Wednesday, significantly curtailing both the carbon dioxide and
the toxic soot and chemicals that spew from the tailpipes of the
nation’s light- and medium-duty vehicles.
</p>
<p>
With that, Biden is checking off one of the two most important pieces of
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/bidens-unfinished-climate-agenda" target="_self">unfinished
climate business</a> he has left on his first term to-do list. The rules
tighten pollution limits gradually over six years, beginning in 2027. In
concert with other Biden policies including consumer tax credits for
electric vehicles purchases, initiatives to build out charging
infrastructure, and support for domestic manufacturing, the standards
will help accelerate the transition to electric vehicles that is already
well underway.
</p>
<p>
Transportation is responsible for more planet-warming emissions than
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/americas-carbon-emissions-fell-for-the-first-time-since-covid" target="_self">any
other part</a> of the U.S. economy. To get the country on the path of
reaching net zero emissions by 2050, as Biden has set out to do, curbing
car emissions is unavoidable.
</p>
<p>
When the rules were originally proposed last year, we
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/epa-car-emissions-evs-takeaways" target="_self">wrote</a>
that they would “roughly halve carbon pollution from America’s massive
car and truck fleet, the world’s third largest, within a decade.” That’s
still broadly the case, even though the final version features one big
change: Automakers will now have more time to cut emissions from their
fleets. They will still have to achieve the same standard in 2032 as
what was originally proposed, but they can transition to it more slowly.
</p>
<p>
Ahead of the official release, senior administration officials
downplayed the significance of the slower rollout. They argued that
giving automakers, dealers, and labor unions more time in the near-term
would make for a sturdier rule, and that the cumulative emissions
benefits of the final standard converge with the original proposal. At a
White House event on Wednesday, members of the president’s climate team
built on that message, framing the new rules not as a government mandate
but rather as a tool to give consumers more of what they already want.
“We are witnessing a technological revolution driven by the markets,”
Environmental Protection Agency administrator Michael Regan proclaimed.
</p>
<p>
Also speaking at the event was John Bozzella, head of the Alliance for
Automotive Innovation, which represents most U.S. automakers, including
the Big Three. Bozzella praised the administration for heeding the
industry’s concerns over the original proposal’s rapid phase-in and said
the new rules were “much improved” from what had initially been
proposed. “Pace matters to automakers,” he said. “It certainly matters
to consumers.”
</p>
<p>
The full rule was released mid-day Wednesday, and we’re digging through
it to find out exactly what else has changed. But here’s what we know so
far.
</p>
<h3>
What do the rules say?
</h3>
<p>
The rules strengthen greenhouse gas emission limits, in terms of grams
of CO2 per mile, that automakers will have to adhere to, on average,
across their product lines. They also tighten limits on dangerous
pollutants, including particulate matter — the tiny bits that make up
soot — and nitrogen oxides.
</p>
<p>
This chart shows how the cuts in the final rule compare to those
proposed in the draft rule. The version released last April required
automakers to make steeper reductions to carbon emissions in the first
three years, while the final rule allows for a more gradual reduction.

</iframe>
</center>
<h3>
Will the rules ban gas-powered cars?
</h3>
<p>
No. They are what’s called technology-neutral standards, meaning that
automakers have options for how to comply with them. Since automakers
have to meet the emissions targets on average across their fleets,
rather than for each vehicle, it’s likely they’ll produce a range of
options in 2032, including plug-in hybrids, regular hybrids, and even
some gas cars with improved efficiency — though their fleets will
probably have a much higher proportion of EVs than they do now.
</p>
<p>
While that generally hasn’t changed from the preliminary rule, the Biden
administration’s messaging around it has.
</p>
<p>
When it released the initial proposal, the EPA emphasized that the
least-cost path to achieving the standards would be for about two-thirds
of new vehicles sold in 2032 to be electric. Although this was just one
potential scenario, it was widely interpreted as a target or even a
mandate — particularly by Biden’s
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-fact-check-climate-change#electric-vehicles" target="_self">political</a>
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/evs-trump-uaw-jobs-evidence" target="_self">opponents</a>.
</p>
<p>
On Tuesday, administration officials said that the two-thirds finding
had been based on limited data. The EPA now estimates that EVs may make
up anywhere between 30% and 56% of new light-duty sales from model years
2030 to 2032.
</p>
<h3>
How much carbon pollution will the rules avoid?
</h3>
<p>
By 2032, the light-duty fleet on offer from automakers will emit half as
much carbon as vehicles on the market in 2026.
</p>
<p>
The EPA estimates that these rules will avoid 7.2 billion metric tons of
carbon from 2027 to 2055, which accounts for the vehicles’ full lifetime
on the road. That’s slightly less than the 7.3 billion metric tons the
initial proposal would have avoided.
</p>
<h3>
How will the rules affect new car-buyers?
</h3>
<p>
The rules will change the mix of vehicles sold by automakers,
encouraging dealers to sell more hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and battery
electric vehicles. They’re also expected to save Americans roughly $62
billion in fuel costs and avoided maintenance costs, since the EPA
assumes that EVs are still cheaper to operate and maintain. On average,
a consumer will save about $6,000 over the lifetime of a 2032 vehicle
compared to one sold in 2026, according to the agency.
</p>
<p>
The tailpipe rule will likely increase the cost of building each
vehicle, which could translate into higher prices for consumers.
However, state and federal tax incentives — as well as the cheaper cost
of operating and fueling EVs — will offset that increase.
</p>
<h3>
How will the rules affect people who don’t own a car — or who don’t plan
to buy one soon?
</h3>
<p>
The rules are projected to deliver major health and environmental
benefits to the public. The EPA estimates they will produce $37 billion
in benefits from improved public health and climate mitigation,
including avoided hospitalizations and premature deaths.
</p>
<p>
This is what the EPA was created to do — use the best available science
to protect human health and the environment. But even after decades of
improvements in air quality, there is still a lot of room for
improvement. More than one third of the population still live in places
with unhealthy levels of ozone or particulate pollution, according to
The American Lung Association’s most recent “
<a href="https://www.lung.org/getmedia/338b0c3c-6bf8-480f-9e6e-b93868c6c476/SOTA-2023.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">state
of the air</a>” report. The risks are deeply unequal, with people of
color making up half of those exposed. The report also noted that
climate change is making it harder to protect people, as heat, drought,
and wildfires increasingly lead to spikes in these pollutants.
Altogether, ozone and particulate matter are responsible for more than
60,000 premature deaths annually,
<a href="https://www.stateofglobalair.org/data/#/health/plot" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according
to the Health Effects Institute</a>, a nonprofit, independent research
organization funded by the EPA and automakers.
</p>
<h3>
How is the Biden administration selling the rule?
</h3>
<p>
Officials stressed that EV sales are already
<a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-episode-3-inflation-reduction-act" target="_self">shattering
analyst predictions</a>, prices are dropping, and product availability
is growing. They see this rule as part of a larger ecosystem of policies
— including those in the Inflation Reduction Act, the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law, and the CHIPS and Science Act — that are
revitalizing American manufacturing and creating jobs while also
contributing to the global fight against climate change. The EPA’s press
release notes that companies have announced more than $160 billion in
domestic clean vehicle manufacturing, and that the auto manufacturing
sector as a whole has added more than 100,000 jobs since Biden took
office.
</p>
<p>
The administration is also, perhaps less loudly, selling the pollution
standards as a path to freedom from fossil fuels. During the press call
Tuesday, a senior administration official said the rules would enable
consumers to break loose from the oil industry’s grip on how we get
around and how much it costs us.
</p>
<h3>
What happens next?
</h3>
<p>
The new rules kick in for cars in model year 2027, which will go on sale
in 2026 and are being designed right now. Although the Biden
administration has
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/17/climate/biden-epa-auto-emissions.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">suggested</a>
that the new rules have won the support of the car industry — including
automakers, labor unions, and dealerships — it could still face a court
challenge from attorneys general in Republican-controlled states.
Republican officials
<a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/esg/republican-ags-pledge-to-sue-sec-over-emissions-disclosure-rules" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">have
repeatedly sued</a> to block the Biden administration’s climate
policies.
</p>
<p>
It’s unclear how the Supreme Court would respond to such a challenge.
Although the Court has long
<a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2006/05-1120" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">backed</a>
the EPA’s ability to limit climate pollution from cars and trucks, its
hard-right majority has recently rolled back what were once thought to
be bedrock environmental laws. In this term alone, the Court seems
likely to
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/02/21/emissions-states-epa-supreme-court/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">restrict</a>
the EPA’s ability to regulate toxic air pollution while
<a href="https://www.law.georgetown.edu/environmental-law-review/blog/what-overruling-chevron-could-mean-for-environmental-law/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sweeping
away</a> a central legal doctrine of environmental regulation.

The ice cream business is pretty chilly these days. Consumer goods giant
Unilever announced this week that it’s going to spin off its ice cream
business, which includes familiar names like Ben &amp; Jerry’s, Popsicle

it plan to defrost? Plus, the secret to using AI well at work may

id="west-eyes-new-measures-after-passage-of-hong-kong-security-law">West
Eyes New Measures After Passage of Hong Kong Security Law</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Taipei, Taiwan — Hong Kong’s adoption of a second national security
law Tuesday is being criticized by foreign governments, while some
business figures say the law will hasten foreign businesses’ departure
from the city.</p>
<p>The United Nations, the United States, the United Kingdom and the
European Union expressed concern about the ambiguous language in the law
and its speedy adoption, which was completed in less than two weeks.</p>
<p>U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk warned that the
vague provisions in the bill, also known as Article 23, could lead to
the criminalization of freedom of expression, freedom of peaceful
assembly and the right to receive and impart information, which are all
rights protected under international human rights law.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the U.S. State Department said passage of Article 23 could
accelerate the closing of a once-open society, adding that the U.S. is
analyzing the potential impact of the law.</p>
<p>British Foreign Secretary David Cameron said the law has failed to
“provide certainty for international organizations, including diplomatic
missions” operating in Hong Kong, and it will foster “the culture of
self-censorship” that is now dominating the social and political
landscape in the city.</p>
<p>Apart from reiterating concerns about the law’s potential impact on
Hong Kong people’s basic rights and freedom, the EU said the bill’s
increased penalties, extraterritorial reach and partial retroactive
applicability are “also deeply worrying.”</p>
<p>Despite the international criticism, Hong Kong Chief Executive John
Lee hailed the passage of Article 23 as “a historic moment for Hong
Kong,” while the Chinese government expressed “full support” of the
development.</p>
<p>Rights activists call for sanctions</p>
<p>While they welcome the concerns expressed by foreign governments,
some human rights activists urged democratic countries to respond with
more forceful measures.</p>
<p>“With the enactment of the Article 23 legislation, now is the time to
impose sanctions on officials like Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee,”
said Benedict Rogers, the CEO of U.K.-based nongovernmental organization
Hong Kong Watch.</p>
<p>Since Hong Kong implemented the controversial national security law
and detained dozens of pro-democracy activists and politicians in 2020,
the U.S. is the only country that has imposed sanctions on Hong Kong and
Chinese officials, 24 of them in all.</p>
<p>Rogers said since the U.K. doesn’t want to damage trade relations
with China, the British government remains reluctant to impose sanctions
on Chinese officials over the deteriorating conditions in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>“[While] they imposed sanctions on some Chinese officials over the
human rights violations in Xinjiang, they haven’t done anything similar
on Hong Kong,” he told VOA by phone.</p>
<p>While the U.S. has introduced some tools to counter China’s
tightening control over Hong Kong — including sanctions, new legislation
to ban the export of certain items to Hong Kong and the elimination of
Hong Kong’s special status — some observers urged Washington to roll out
more forceful measures following the passage of the Article 23.</p>
<p>“There’s a lot that Congress and the administration can do, including
issuing additional sanctions against people responsible for the
implementation of the two national security laws and advancing other
existing legislations related to Hong Kong,” Samuel Bickett, a
Washington-based human rights activist, told VOA by phone.</p>
<p>In a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken Thursday,
leaders of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China and the House
Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party urged him to consider
imposing new sanctions against officials responsible for undermining
freedom and rule of law in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>They also vowed to advance the Hong Kong Economic Trade Office
Certification Act and the Transnational Repression Policy Act through
Congress. Once passed, the two bills would require Hong Kong to shut
down its trade offices in the U.S. and allow the U.S. government to
impose sanctions against Chinese or Hong Kong officials responsible for
launching transnational repression against dissidents in the U.S. </p>
<p>Laws’ effect on immigration, business</p>
<p>Apart from adopting more forceful measures against the Hong Kong and
Chinese governments, Bickett and Rogers think democratic countries
should introduce new immigration measures to accommodate the growing
number of Hong Kong citizens leaving the city. According to statistics
from Bloomberg, around 500,000 people have left Hong Kong since
2021.</p>
<p>While the U.K. has introduced an immigration program for holders of
British Overseas Passports from Hong Kong, which was recently extended
to more young people, Rogers hopes other countries, including the U.S.
and those in Europe, can create similar programs tailored for Hong
Kongers.</p>
<p>“I would like to see the EU and the U.S. offer some options so Hong
Kongers who don’t qualify for the U.K.’s immigration scheme can have
alternative options,” he said.</p>
<p>Since the Article 23 legislation uses vague language to define
espionage and theft of state secrets, some analysts say foreign
businesses may face serious challenges when conducting due diligence
investigations or seeking information.</p>
<p>“This could be a big blow to banks and financial institutions, and it
will further discourage investors from coming to Hong Kong since access
to information is now further restricted,” Eric Lai, an expert on Hong
Kong’s legal system at Georgetown Center for Asian Law, told VOA by
phone.</p>
<p>Some analysts say the growing uncertainty in the business environment
would lead more foreign businesses to consider leaving Hong Kong.</p>
<p>“Article 23 will hasten the departure of international businesses
unless the Hong Kong government quickly establishes guard rails
constricting the operational boundaries of the new law,” Andrew Collier,
managing director of Orient Capital Research, told VOA in a written
response.</p>

Touts America’s ‘Future’ as Government Invests $8.5 Billion in Chipmaker
Intel</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Chandler, Arizona — President Joe Biden on Wednesday celebrated an
agreement to provide Intel with up to $8.5 billion in direct funding and
$11 billion in loans for computer chip plants around the country,
talking up the investment in the political battleground state of Arizona
and calling it a way of “bringing the future back to America.”</p>
<p>The Biden administration has predicted that the cash infusion should
help the U.S. boost its global share of advanced chip production from
zero to 20%. The Democratic president highlighted the investment while
visiting Intel’s Ocotillo campus in Chandler, Arizona, where he
inspected silicon wafers and expressed amazement at how thin the chips
were.</p>
<p>In remarks after the tour, Biden talked about the impact his policies
could have on the U.S. economy as he tries to translate his policy wins
into a political boost ahead of November’s election. Intel plans to
invest in facilities in Arizona, Ohio, Oregon and New Mexico, with some
of the government money helping to support workforce development.</p>
<p>“This isn’t just about investing in America,” Biden said. “It’s about
investing in the American people as well.”</p>
<p>Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said the deal reached through her
department would put the United States in a position to produce 20% of
the world’s most advanced chips by 2030, up from zero. The United States
designs advanced chips, but its inability to make them domestically has
emerged as a national security and economic risk.</p>
<p>“Failure is not an option — leading-edge chips are the core of our
innovation system, especially when it comes to advances in artificial
intelligence and our military systems,” Raimondo said on a call with
reporters. “We can’t just design chips. We have to make them in
America.”</p>
<p>The funding announcement came amid the heat of the 2024 presidential
campaign. Biden has been telling voters that his policies have led to a
resurgence in U.S. manufacturing and job growth. His message is a direct
challenge to former President Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican
nominee, who raised tariffs while in the White House and wants to do so
again on the promise of protecting U.S. factory jobs from China.</p>
<p>U.S. adults have dim views of Biden’s economic leadership, with just
34% approving, according to a February poll by The Associated Press-NORC
Center for Public Affairs. The lingering impact of inflation hitting a
four-decade high in 2022 has hurt the Democrat, who had a 52% approval
on the economy in July 2021.</p>
<p>Intel’s projects would be funded in part through the bipartisan 2022
CHIPS and Science Act, which the Biden administration helped shepherd
through Congress at a time of concerns after the pandemic that the loss
of access to chips made in Asia could plunge the U.S. economy into a
recession.</p>
<p>When pushing for the investment, lawmakers expressed concern about
efforts by China to control Taiwan, which accounts for more than 90% of
advanced computer chip production.</p>
<p>Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat up for reelection this year,
stressed that his state would become “a global leader in semiconductor
manufacturing” as Intel would be generating thousands of jobs. Ohio has
voted for Trump in the past two presidential elections, and Brown in
November will face Republican Bernie Moreno, a Trump-backed businessman
from Cleveland.</p>
<p>Wednesday’s announcement is the fourth and largest so far under the
chips law, with the government support expected to help enable Intel
Corp. to make $100 billion in capital investments over five years. About
25% of that total would involve building and land, while roughly 70%
would go to equipment, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said.</p>
<p>“We think of this as a defining moment for the United States, the
semiconductor industry and for Intel,” said Gelsinger, who called the
CHIPS Act “the most critical industrial policy legislation since World
War II.”</p>
<p>Biden administration officials say that computer chip companies would
not be investing domestically at their expected scale without government
support. Intel funding would lead to a combined 30,000 manufacturing and
construction jobs. The company also plans to claim tax credits from the
Treasury Department worth up to 25% on qualified investments.</p>
<p>The Santa Clara, California-based company will use the funding in
four states. In Chandler, Arizona, the money will help to build two new
chip plants and modernize an existing one. The funding will establish
two advanced plants in New Albany, Ohio, which is just outside the state
capital of Columbus.</p>
<p>The company will also turn two of its plants in Rio Rancho, New
Mexico, into advanced packaging facilities. And Intel will also
modernize facilities in Hillsboro, Oregon.</p>

Stellantis – the parent company of Jeep, Chrysler, Fiat, Dodge, and Ram
– says that it will comply with California’s stricter emissions policy
requiring two-thirds of new cars to be zero-emissions or all-electric by
2030 – and will commit to the deal even if former President Donald Trump
makes a return to office and tries to dismantle the policy.

Today, we’re bringing you a very ESG-focused podcast. First, Texas is
pulling $8.5 billion from the country’s biggest asset manager,
BlackRock, which the state’s school fund says is hostile to the fossil
fuel industry. It’s a pushback against ESG investing, in which
environmental, social and corporate governance issues factor into
decision-making. Then, a new paper says climate resilience is an
investment opportunity for big-time institutional investors. We delve
in.

Automatic Toll Booths by Obscuring License Plates</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-20, updated: 2024-03-14, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>

The <i>Wall Street Journal</i> is

on a variety of techniques drivers are using to obscure their license
plates so that automatic readers can’t identify them and charge tolls
properly.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Some drivers have power-washed paint off their plates or covered them
with a range of household items such as leaf-shaped magnets,
Bramwell-Stewart said. The Port Authority says officers in 2023 roughly
doubled the number of summonses issued for obstructed, missing or
fictitious license plates compared with the prior year.
</p>
<p>
Bramwell-Stewart said one driver from New Jersey repeatedly used what’s
known in the streets as a flipper, which lets you remotely swap out a
car’s real plate for a bogus one ahead of a toll area. In this instance,
the bogus plate corresponded to an actual one registered to a woman who
was mystified to receive the tolls. “Why do you keep billing me?”
Bramwell-Stewart recalled her asking…

These new Rivian models are sleek and important, but they won’t go on

Here is an excerpt from our conversation: <span></span>
</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Robinson Meyer:</strong> There’s this term called carcinization
in evolutionary biology. <br/> <br/> <strong>Jesse Jenkins:</strong>
Ooh.<br/> <br/> <strong>Meyer:</strong> People know this meme, which is
that things in the sea tend to evolve into crabs. There’s lots of
animals that look like crabs in the sea that are not true crabs, so to
speak, because the crab is like a very successful bottom dweller form
factor. And so animals that do not start as crabs, once they fill the
same ecological niche as crabs, will wind up looking like crabs after
you know 10 million, 15 million years.<br/><br/> To remember another
guy, I have been thinking also a lot of the — again, if you’re not
driving, Google this — the 1990s Toyota Previa, which was a kind of, it
was a minivan that was like a half oval. It was kind of pill shaped. And
again, the wheels were right at the front and right at the back. It was
a more successful car, you’ll see it, it was the iconic 90s Toyota
minivan. <br/> <br/> And I do feel like, to some degree, the whole car
market is undergoing this process of carcinization, where what is
actually the vehicle that people want the most, especially families want
the most, is a minivan. But minivans are not seen as cool or rugged, and
so the whole car market is like trying to generate a vehicle that is as
close to the Previa as possible but does not look like a mini— You know,
it’s not actually, but to some degree I feel like we keep evolving
minivans again and again. <br/> <br/> If you think about the history of
what the family car has been, where it was a station wagon in the 70s
and 80s, then it was a minivan. Now it’s this crossover SUV thing. <br/>
<br/> <strong>Jenkins: </strong>Yeah, because they make a lot of
sense.<br/> <br/> <strong>Meyer: </strong>Those are, broadly, very
similar cars. They’re very similar, right? They let you seat two to
three kids and they give you a lot of space in the back. But as fashion
changes and what’s cool, we have to keep redesigning that form factor
for just what’s trendy at the moment. But we’re just dancing around this
common design.<br/> <br/> <strong>Jenkins: </strong>Yeah, it’s really
interesting. There’s such a funny love hate relationship out there with
minivans. I mean, they are incredibly useful cars, right? But it’s so
hard culturally. It’s so hard to be like, <em>Oh, I got a minivan, I
gotta drive a minivan now</em>. I turned 40 this year, so I’m right
there. I grew up—<br/> <br/> <strong>Meyer: </strong>You’re closer to
your midlife crisis than I am here.<br/> <br/> <strong>Jenkins:</strong>
—in a household with, originally, when I was first born, they had two
Volkswagen bugs. And then as we, my sister and I grew up and we needed
more space, both my parents traded in their bugs for Volkswagen
minibuses. So we had the Volkswagen bus. And it was like the best family
car growing up, right? Because we could all camp in it. Like, you know,
we could throw the back seat down and put a mattress there. One of us
could sleep on the floor, the middle seats. All my friends would fit
inside it for trips to the beach. You know, it was just a super useful
vehicle. <br/> <br/> And of course that, you know, that sort of design
atrophied out in terms of the mass market. People still buy them to
convert for campers and things like that, like the Volkswagen California
and other kinds of models like that in the van segment. But it’s
interesting, the ID.4 Buzz is coming back to the market in the U.S. this
year, as well. It’s the sort of rebirth of theVolkswagen microbus, and
I’m really curious to see how it does because it’s a cool design. It’s a
very retro forward, right? Which is very similar to how the R3 looks,
I’d say. <br/> <br/> I’ll come back to that in a minute. But I’m really
curious to see how it sells. I know my family’s been really interested
in it, waiting for it to come out and see what it actually looks like in
real life, and maybe test drive it and see if it’s something we might
want in the future. But I would love to see more in that category,
right? The van.<br/> <br/> And you know, the SUV is really just trying
to imitate a van with rugged looks that you really don’t need. If you
just admit it, you just want a minivan.<span></span>

chose their presidential candidate today. The results highlight the
weaknesses former president Trump is bringing to the 2024 presidential
contest. Trump, who is the only person still in the Republican race, won
all five of today’s Republican races. But the results showed that his
support is soft. Results are still coming in, but as I write this,
former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, who has suspended her
campaign, received between 13% and 20% of the vote, Florida governor Ron
DeSantis—who has also suspended his campaign—picked up votes, and “none
of the names shown” got more than 5% in Kansas.</p>

<h2 id="how-texas-plans-to-arrest-migrants-would-work">How Texas’ Plans
to Arrest Migrants Would Work</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>McALLEN, Texas — A law that would allow Texas law enforcement to
arrest migrants suspected of illegally entering the U.S. is back on
hold.</p>
<p>The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals late Tuesday issued an order
preventing its enforcement, just hours after the Supreme Court allowed
the strict new immigration law to take effect.</p>
<p>The Justice Department is challenging the law, saying Texas is
overstepping the federal government’s immigration authority. Texas
argues it has a right to take action over what the governor has
described as an “invasion” of migrants on the border.</p>
<p>Here’s what to know:</p>
<p>Who can be arrested? </p>
<p>The law would allow any Texas law enforcement officer to arrest
people suspected of entering the country illegally. Once in custody,
migrants could either agree to a Texas judge’s order to leave the U.S.
or be prosecuted on misdemeanor charges of illegal entry. Migrants who
don’t leave could face arrest again under more serious felony
charges.</p>
<p>Arresting officers must have probable cause, which could include
witnessing the illegal entry or seeing it on video. </p>
<p>The law cannot be enforced against people lawfully present in the
U.S., including those who were granted asylum or who are enrolled in the
Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.</p>
<p>Critics, including Mexico President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, fear
the law could lead to racial profiling and family separation.</p>
<p>American Civil Liberties Union affiliates in Texas and some
neighboring states issued a travel advisory a day after Gov. Greg Abbott
signed the law. The advisory warns of a possible threat to civil and
constitutional rights when passing through Texas. </p>
<p>Abbott has rejected concerns over profiling. While signing the bill,
he said troopers and National Guard members at the border can see
migrants crossing illegally “with their own eyes.”</p>
<p>Where would the law be enforced? </p>
<p>The law can be enforced in any of Texas’ 254 counties, including
those hundreds of miles from the border. </p>
<p>But Republican state Rep. David Spiller, the law’s author, has said
he expects most arrests would occur within 80 kilometers of the
U.S.-Mexico border. Texas’ state police chief has expressed similar
expectations.</p>
<p>Some places are off-limits. Arrests cannot be made in public and
private schools, places of worship, or hospitals and other health care
facilities, including those where sexual assault forensic examinations
are conducted.</p>
<p>It is unclear where migrants ordered to leave might go. The law says
they are to be sent to ports of entry along the U.S.-Mexico border, even
if they are not Mexican citizens. However, Mexico’s government said
Tuesday it would not accept the return of any migrants to its territory
from the state of Texas.</p>
<p>Is the law constitutional? </p>
<p>The Supreme Court’s decision did not address the constitutionality of
the law.</p>
<p>The Justice Department, legal experts and immigrant rights groups
have said it is a clear conflict with the U.S. government’s authority to
regulate immigration.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge David Ezra, an appointee of former President
Ronald Reagan, agreed in a 114-page order. He added that the law could
hamper U.S. foreign relations and treaty obligations.</p>
<p>Opponents have called the measure the most dramatic attempt by a
state to police immigration since a 2010 Arizona law — denounced by
critics as the “Show Me Your Papers” bill — that was largely struck down
by the U.S. Supreme Court. Ezra cited the Supreme Court’s 2012 Arizona
ruling in his decision.</p>
<p>Texas has argued that the law mirrors federal law instead of
conflicting with it. </p>
<p>What is happening on the border? </p>
<p>Arrests for illegal crossings along the southern border fell by half
in January from record highs in December. Border Patrol officials
attributed the shift to seasonal declines and heightened enforcement by
the U.S. and its allies. The federal government has not yet released
numbers for February.</p>
<p>Texas has charged thousands of migrants with trespassing on private
property under a more limited operation that began in 2021.</p>
<p>Tensions remain between Texas and the Biden administration. In the
border city of Eagle Pass, Texas, National Guard members have prevented
Border Patrol agents from accessing a riverfront park.</p>
<p>Other Republican governors have expressed support for Abbott, who has
said the federal government is not doing enough to enforce immigration
laws. Other measures implemented by Texas include a floating barrier in
the Rio Grande and razor wire along the border.</p>

<h2 id="china-not-russia-still-tops-list-of-threats-to-us">China, Not
Russia, Still Tops List of Threats to US</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Russia’s war in Ukraine — portrayed by top U.S.
officials as posing a danger to the United States itself — still trails
China when it comes to long-term threats to America’s security,
according to a top Pentagon official.</p>
<p>The warning from Ely Ratner, the Defense Department’s assistant
secretary for Indo-Pacific security affairs, comes in testimony prepared
for a hearing Wednesday by the House Armed Services Committee on
security challenges in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
<p>“The PRC [People’s Republic of China] continues to present the most
comprehensive and serious challenge to our national security,” Ratner is
set to tell lawmakers, according to a copy his opening statement
obtained by VOA.</p>
<p>“The PRC remains the only country with the will and increasingly the
capability to dominate the Indo-Pacific region and displace the United
States,” Ratner warns, adding, “the PRC is pursuing its revisionist
goals with increasingly coercive activities in the Taiwan Strait, the
South and East China seas, along the Line of Actual Control with India,
and beyond.”</p>
<p>This is not the first time Ratner has addressed the growing threat
from Beijing.</p>
<p>In October he called out China’s military for what he described as a
“sharp increase” in risky behavior in the East and South China seas.</p>
<p>Ratner also cautioned, separately, that China’s leaders were
“increasingly turning to the PLA [People’s Liberation Army] as an
instrument of coercion.”</p>
<p>Additionally, the Pentagon’s annual China Military Power report said
that China’s nuclear arsenal has been growing faster than expected,
while Beijing is building out the infrastructure needed for a further
expansion of its nuclear forces.</p>
<p>China has responded to such allegations by accusing the U.S. of
“hyping up” the threat.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin issued a warning of
his own, emphasizing the threat from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>“The United States stands by Ukraine because it’s the right thing to
do,” Austin told a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group in
Ramstein, Germany. “But we also stand by Ukraine because it’s crucial to
our own security.”</p>
<p>“The United States would face grave new perils in a world where
aggression and autocracy are on the march and where tyrants are
emboldened and where dictators think that they can wipe out democracy
off the map,” he said.</p>
<p>U.S. intelligence officials argued recently that the threats from
Russia and China are linked, and that Russia’s war has served to
embolden China’s leadership.</p>
<p>Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines told lawmakers earlier
this month that Beijing has managed to get long-sought concessions from
Moscow in exchange for support for Russia’s war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>And CIA Director William Burns said Russian success in Ukraine could
“stoke the ambitions of the Chinese leadership in contingencies ranging
from Taiwan to the South China Sea.”</p>
<p>Ratner is set to tell U.S. lawmakers Wednesday that the Defense
Department is working to strengthen key alliances in the Indo-Pacific
and develop what he calls a “regional force posture” including Japan,
South Korea, the Philippines and Australia.</p>
<p>He is also set to testify that the Pentagon’s proposed 2025 budget is
placing a priority on investments in air, sea and undersea power, as
well as in modernizing U.S. nuclear forces with an eye toward Beijing’s
own military modernization efforts.</p>

id="biden-trump-notch-wins-other-races-offer-hints-on-national-politics">Biden,
Trump Notch Wins; Other Races Offer Hints on National Politics</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>COLUMBUS, Ohio — As Joe Biden and Donald Trump moved closer to a
November rematch, primary voters around the country on Tuesday urged
their favored candidate to keep up the fight and worried about what
might happen if their side loses this fall.</p>
<p>There was little suspense about Tuesday’s results as both candidates
are already their parties’ presumptive nominees. Trump easily won
Republican primaries in Arizona, Florida, Illinois, Kansas and Ohio.
Biden did the same except in Florida, where Democrats had canceled their
primary and opted to award all 224 of their delegates to Biden.</p>
<p>Instead, the primaries and key downballot races became a reflection
of the national political mood. With many Americans unenthusiastic about
2024’s choice for the White House, both Biden and Trump’s campaigns are
working to fire up their bases by tearing into each other and warning of
the perils of the opponent.</p>
<p>Those who did turn out to vote Tuesday seemed to hear that.</p>
<p>Pat Shackleford, an 84-year-old caregiver in Mesa, Arizona, said she
voted for Trump in Arizona’s primary to send the former president a
message.</p>
<p>“I wanted to encourage him that the fight has been worthwhile, that
more of us are behind him than maybe the media tells you,” Shackleford
said.</p>
<p>Jamie and Cassandra Neal, sisters who both live in Phoenix, said they
were unenthusiastic Biden supporters until they saw the vigor the
president brought to his State of the Union speech. It fired them up for
the coming election.</p>
<p>“Beforehand it was like, ‘Well, he’s the only decent one there,’”
said Cassandra Neal, 42. “After his address it was like, ‘OK, let’s do
it!’”</p>
<p>Jamie Neal, 45, said Biden had been “way too nice” before and needed
to match Trump, whom she described as “vicious.”</p>
<p>“I hate to say it, sometimes you need to equal the lowness to get the
person out,” she said. “Sometimes you have to fight fire with fire.”</p>
<p>In Ohio’s Republican Senate primary, Trump-backed businessman Bernie
Moreno defeated two challengers, Ohio Secretary of State Frank Frank
LaRose and Matt Dolan, whose family owns the Cleveland Guardians
baseball team.</p>
<p>Moreno and Trump appeared together Saturday at a rally where Trump
praised his endorsed candidate as a “warrior” and ramped up his dark
rhetoric, saying that were he not to be elected, “it’s going to be a
bloodbath for the country.” His campaign insists he was referring to the
auto industry and not the country as a whole.</p>
<p>In the final days of the campaign, The Associated Press reported on
Thursday that in 2008, someone with access to Moreno’s work email
account created a profile on an adult website seeking “Men for 1-on-1
sex.” The AP could not definitively confirm that it was created by
Moreno himself. Moreno’s lawyer said a former intern created the account
and provided a statement from the intern, Dan Ricci, who said he created
the account as “part of a juvenile prank.”</p>
<p>Questions about the profile have circulated in GOP circles for the
past month, sparking frustration among senior Republican operatives
about Moreno’s potential vulnerability in a general election, according
to seven people who are directly familiar with conversations about how
to address the matter. They requested anonymity to avoid running afoul
of Trump and his allies.</p>
<p>Trump and Biden have for weeks been focused on the general election,
aiming their campaigns lately on states that could be competitive in
November rather than merely those holding primaries.</p>
<p>Trump, a Florida voter, cast his ballot at a recreation center in
Palm Beach on Tuesday and told reporters, “I voted for Donald
Trump.”</p>
<p>Trump and Biden are running on their records in office and casting
the other as a threat to America. Trump, 77, portrays the 81-year-old
Biden as mentally unfit. The president has described his Republican
rival as a threat to democracy after his attempt to overturn the 2020
election results and his praise of foreign strongmen.</p>
<p>Those themes were evident Tuesday at some polling locations.</p>
<p>“President Biden, I don’t think he knows how to tie his shoes
anymore,” said Trump supporter Linda Bennet, a resident of Palm Beach
Gardens, Florida, not far from the former president’s Mar-a-Lago
resort.</p>
<p>Even as she echoed Trump’s arguments about Biden, she criticized
Trump’s rhetoric and “the way he composes himself” as “not presidential
at all.” But she said the former president is “a man of his word,” and
she said the country, especially the economy, felt stronger to her under
Trump’s leadership.</p>
<p>In Columbus, Ohio, Democrat Brenda Woodfolk voted for Biden and
shared the president’s framing of the choice this fall.</p>
<p>“It’s scary,” she said of the prospect that Trump could be in the
Oval Office again. “Trump wants to be a dictator, talking about making
America white again and all this kind of crap. There’s too much hate
going on.”</p>
<p>Bennet and Woodfolk agreed that immigration is one of their top
concerns, though they offered different takes on why.</p>
<p>“This border thing is out of control,” said Bennet, the Republican
voter. “I think it’s the government’s plot or plan to bring these people
in to change the whole dynamic for their benefit, so I’m pretty
peeved.”</p>
<p>Woodfolk, the Democrat, said she doesn’t mind immigrants “sharing”
opportunities in the U.S. but worried it comes at the expense of “people
who’ve been here all their lives.”</p>
<p>Trump and Republicans have hammered Biden on the influx of migrants
crossing the U.S.-Mexico border in recent years, seeking to capitalize
on the issue well beyond border states. Biden has ratcheted up a
counteroffensive in recent weeks after Senate Republicans killed a
migration compromise they had negotiated with the White House,
withholding their support only after Trump said he opposed the deal.
Biden has used the circumstances to argue that Trump and Republicans
have no interest in solving the issue but instead want to inflame voters
in an election year.</p>
<p>For the last year, Trump has coupled his campaign with his legal
challenges, including dozens of criminal counts and civil cases in which
he faces more than $500 million in fines.</p>
<p>His first criminal trial was scheduled to start Monday in New York on
allegations he falsified business records to cover up hush money
payments. But a judge delayed the trial for 30 days after the recent
disclosure of new evidence that Trump’s lawyers said they needed time to
review.</p>
<p>Speaking outside his polling place with a voter’s sticker affixed to
his lapel, Trump insisted the cases against him were political and
defended himself against criticism of his attacks a day earlier on
Jewish Democrats, in which he alleged they hate Israel and their own
religion. Democratic leaders on Tuesday criticized his comments as
promoting antisemitic tropes about having divided loyalties.</p>
<p>Standing next to him was former first lady Melania Trump, who didn’t
have on a sticker. She has rarely appeared in public with Trump since he
launched his third bid for the White House.</p>
<p>Asked if she would campaign with him, she replied: “Stay tuned.”</p>

Muslim Groups Plan to Boycott White House Ramadan</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — American Muslims outraged by President Joe Biden’s
support of Israel say they will not take part in White House Ramadan and
Eid celebrations this year as they continue to demand that the
administration push for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza.</p>
<p>Should an invitation come, it’s “widely understood” that American
Muslim community leaders and organizations will decline, said Robert
McCaw, director of the Government Affairs Department at the Council on
American-Islamic Relations, CAIR.</p>
<p>“This decision is due to the administration’s failure to address
Muslim community demands for an immediate and permanent cease-fire,”
McCaw told VOA. “And its refusal to stop supplying manufactured weapons
to Israel, which are being used in a genocide against our Palestinian
brothers and sisters in Gaza.”</p>
<p>Amid media reports that the administration is considering scaling
back Ramadan events at the White House, press secretary Karine
Jean-Pierre said no celebration related to the holy month has been
announced.</p>
<p>“We understand that it is a painful time for a number of
communities,” she told VOA during her press briefing Monday. Senior
White House officials have met with members of the Arab, Muslim and
Palestinian communities “to talk about their views, to voice their
concerns, and we welcome that,” she added.</p>
<p>The suffering of the Palestinian people “will be front of mind for
many” Muslims this Ramadan, President Joe Biden said in a statement
marking the beginning of the month. “It is front of mind for me.”</p>
<p>Since taking office, Biden has continued the decadeslong White House
tradition of hosting Muslim community leaders that began with President
Bill Clinton in 1996. Both Republican and Democratic presidents have
hosted iftar dinner during Ramadan or an Eid al Fitr reception to mark
the end of fasting after the month.</p>
<p>But this year, in addition to potentially facing the embarrassment of
a massive boycott, the White House would likely want to avoid scenes
where Biden is shouted at and heckled by pro-Palestinian protesters.
Several of them have disrupted his campaign events around the
country.</p>
<p>Outrage over Gaza is also affecting Nowruz, the Persian New Year
celebrated by diaspora groups of varying ethnicity and religious
affiliation from countries beyond Iran, including Iraq, Afghanistan,
India, Pakistan, Turkey, Tajikistan, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan and
Kazakhstan.</p>
<p>Nowruz this year overlaps with Ramadan. And instead of inviting
hundreds of people to a reception as the administration has done in the
past, this weekend the White House will be hosting a “Nowruz Open House
tour.”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure if the president himself would participate,” said
Jawaid Kotwal, board member of the Afghan American Foundation. “So it’s
way different. A watered-down, downgraded version of the typical Nowruz
celebrations that we had in the White House.”</p>
<p>Kotwal told VOA that he personally declined the invitation but his
organization will “look for any avenue to continue to have engagement
with any occupant of the White House.”</p>
<p>The White House has not responded to requests for further details on
its Nowruz or Ramadan plans.</p>
<p>In his statement marking Nowruz, Biden said the war has “inflicted
terrible suffering on the Palestinian people,” and vowed to “continue to
lead international efforts to get more humanitarian assistance to
them.”</p>
<p>Clouded by controversy</p>
<p>This year is not the first time Ramadan at the White House is clouded
with controversy. In his first year in office, President Donald Trump,
who campaigned on banning Muslims from entering the United States and
signed multiple executive orders restricting immigration from
Muslim-majority countries, did not host a Ramadan event.</p>
<p>In 2018 and 2019, Trump welcomed diplomats from Muslim-majority
nations to the White House for iftar, but American Muslim organizations
and lawmakers were not on the guest list. At the time, American Muslim
groups said they would have declined had they been invited.</p>
<p>Some American Muslims boycotted Biden’s virtual Eid celebrations in
May 2021 as hostilities escalated between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. More
than 260 Palestinians were killed in that round of violence, according
to the United Nations.</p>
<p>That death toll is a fraction of the more than 31,000 Palestinians
killed since Israel launched its military campaign in response to the
Hamas October 7 attacks that took at least 1,200 lives in Israel and
more than 240 people hostage. The level of anger felt now by American
Muslims, Arabs and wide swaths of Biden’s Democratic base is also
exponentially higher.</p>
<p>The community, including those who work in the administration, would
feel “gaslit” by a White House Ramadan event this year, said Tariq
Habash, a Palestinian American and former policy adviser at the
Department of Education who resigned in protest in January.</p>
<p>“You can’t in one hand try and show solidarity and understanding and
then in the other hand supply an unrestricted amount of weapons and
military funding to an extremist government that is intent on the
indiscriminate bombing and killing of civilians,” Habash told VOA.</p>
<p>The White House said it has actively engaged with Arab and Muslim
Americans since the October 7 Hamas attack. Some in the community have
refused to meet with administration officials.</p>

Africa Accuses US Congress of Adding it to a New ‘Axis of Evil’ Over
Israel Genocide Case</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — South Africa seeks to limit the damage to its relations
with Washington caused by its legal challenge to Israel’s assault on
Gaza, a South African official said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Naledi Pandor, who is South Africa’s minister of international
relations and cooperation, is in Washington seeking to sway members of
the U.S. Congress from a proposed law that would further strain U.S.
ties to Africa’s most vibrant democracy and a major mining, banking and
manufacturing hub.</p>
<p>“I think there’s an attempt to take up punitive action against South
Africa, this sort of axis of evil notion that’s very much part of the
political culture,” Pandor said in response to a question from VOA at
South Africa’s embassy in Washington.</p>
<p>In December, South Africa filed an application to institute
proceedings against Israel at the United Nations’ top court. Pretoria
argues that Israel’s actions in Gaza are “genocidal in character,” and
aim to “destroy Palestinians in Gaza.”</p>
<p>In March, South Africa requested further measures from the
International Court of Justice, accusing Israel of weaponizing
starvation by preventing humanitarian aid from reaching the sealed-off
exclave.</p>
<p>Israel’s government has denounced the case, and the White House told
VOA in January it considers it “meritless.”</p>
<p>The case has since inspired a bipartisan push in the U.S. Congress
for legislation mandating a full review of the bilateral relationship
with South Africa. The draft bill, filed by Republican Representative
John James and Democratic Representative Jared Moskowitz, claims that
the actions of South Africa’s long-ruling African National Congress “are
inconsistent with its publicly stated policy of nonalignment in
international affairs.”</p>
<p>“South Africa has been building ties to countries and actors that
undermine America’s national security and threaten our way of life
through its military and political cooperation with China and Russia and
its support of U.S.-designated terrorist organization Hamas,” James said
in a statement when he introduced the bill in February. “We must examine
our alliances and disentangle from those who remain willing to work with
our adversaries.”</p>
<p>Pandor, who also met with think tanks and spoke publicly while in
Washington, said she intended to remind members of Congress of the value
of South Africa, on its own and as a gateway to the continent.</p>
<p>“We believe that any action to diminish the relationship would be
most unwise,” she said, in response to another question from VOA.
“Because these are two key democracies in the regions in which we
exist.”</p>
<p>She said she believes the relationship between the United States and
South Africa can help to promote peace and democracy on the African
continent — and to support the agenda of development in Africa —
“because I can’t imagine how initiatives directed at greater trade and
development would become operational if the institutional capacity of
South Africa is not utilized.”</p>
<p>South Africa is also a major beneficiary of the African Growth and
Opportunity Act, which offers duty-free U.S. market access to 32 African
nations. Congress must vote on whether to extend the program beyond
2025.</p>
<p>VOA asked Pandor whether the high-stakes diplomatic pushback has been
worth it.</p>
<p>“What I do know is if there’s a struggle underway, the longer you
take to address the demands of a struggle, the more violent and vicious
the struggle becomes,” she replied. “So, the sooner you address peace
and negotiations, the greater the opportunity for everybody to enjoy
peace and security. This is the lesson of South Africa.”</p>
<p>And VOA asked analyst Jon Alterman, director of the Middle East
program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, if South
Africa’s case had done anything to stop the conflict between Israel and
Hamas.</p>
<p>“I don’t think South Africa has reframed this conflict. I don’t think
South Africa has really changed the direction at this point,” he said.
“But it’s a thread that runs through it — this concern that South Africa
has history which makes it especially sensitive to issues of
discrimination and genocide. … It certainly added an element to
conversation that wasn’t there until South Africa pushed it as
aggressively as it did.”</p>
<p>Pandor, a veteran member of the long-ruling African National
Congress, stressed that Pretoria’s problem is not with the White House.
She told VOA she had not sought meetings with President Joe Biden or
Secretary of State Antony Blinken during her Washington visit.</p>
<p>“The executive understands [South Africa] far more than Congress,”
she said.</p>
<p>When asked what she’d tell Biden, Pandor’s answer was short.</p>
<p>“Cease-fire,” she said. “Now.”</p>

to put more “I” in the new age of “AI” where it will increasingly
