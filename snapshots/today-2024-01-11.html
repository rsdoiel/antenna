<h2 id="joe-manchin-will-help-you-sue-the-biden-administration">Joe
Manchin Will Help You Sue the Biden Administration</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-11, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTA2MDY1MC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0OTMyMzg1Mn0.yramWa_F7ANyHbQunEktY9euLS8xaHS10NHg0UywKEU/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
It’s not often you hear a sitting U.S. senator invite the public to sue
the federal government — especially when the president is a member of
their own party. But most sitting senators aren’t Joe Manchin.
</p>
<p>
Manchin continued his
<a href="https://www.manchin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/manchin-statement-on-treasury-ev-tax-credit-guidance" target="_blank">crusade</a>
against the Biden administration’s implementation of the electric
vehicle subsidies in the Inflation Reduction Act on Thursday in a
hearing of the Senate Natural Resources Committee to discuss the EV
supply chain. Since the law’s passage, the Democrat from West Virginia
has become
<a href="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/4337855-joe-manchin-blasts-biden-administration-electric-vehicle-rule-foreign-parts-exceptions/" target="_blank">obsessed</a>
with the idea that President Biden is trying to weaken rules around
domestic content in order to allow more EVs to qualify for subsidies and
therefore speed adoption.
</p>
<p>
The law requires that the final assembly of EVs — as well as the
manufacture and processing of their components and critical minerals —
be done largely in the United States or any of its free trade partners
to qualify for subsidies.
</p>
<p>
Though the timelines for compliance are spelled out in the law, the
Treasury Department has been tasked with releasing guidance to clarify
certain aspects of the rules. For example, over the past year, the
department has proposed interpretations of what exactly is considered a
“battery component” and under what circumstances a component or mineral
will be considered to have been produced by a
“<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/ev-tax-credit-china-rule-2024" target="_blank">foreign
entity of concern</a>,” like China. Though those may both sound like
straightforward questions, the guidance clarifies myriad gray areas,
such as what happens when a U.S. company licenses Chinese technology.
</p>
<p>
But at the hearing on Thursday, Manchin used his opening remarks to
accuse Treasury officials of extending timelines for compliance with
certain aspects of the law and watering down domestic content
requirements.
</p>
<p>
“The administration is delaying deadlines we wrote into the law to
remove China completely from the battery supply chain,” he said.
“Vehicles that contain battery minerals and components from China and
other adversaries can qualify for years longer than the law allows.”
</p>
<p>
Manchin warned that the administration’s “unlawful rules are bound to
get struck down in court.” He then vowed to “support any entity that
goes to court to correct the illegal liberalization of this law with an
amicus brief.”
</p>
<p>
It’s true that the Treasury has taken some liberties. For one, it has
proposed temporarily exempting certain minerals that are currently very
hard to trace from the foreign entity of concern rules. But during the
hearing, Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyomo maintained that
the rules were strict. He noted that the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/ev-tax-credit-china-rule-2024" target="_self">list
of electric vehicles</a> that are eligible for the federal tax credit
has shrunk from more than 40 when the IRA was signed into law down to
just 13 as of the beginning of this year.
</p>
<p>
Automakers have largely supported Treasury’s rulemaking. For example,
the lobbying group the Alliance for Automotive Innovation
<a href="https://www.autosinnovate.org/posts/blog/foreign_entity_of_concern_finally_some_clarity" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">welcomed
the clarity</a> provided by the proposed foreign entity of concern rules
in December, saying that they struck a “pragmatic balance.” Autos Drive
America, another trade group that represents foreign automakers
operating in the country, also
<a href="https://www.autosdriveamerica.org/posts/press-release/statement-feoc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reacted
positively</a>.
</p>
<p>
Adeyomo testified that automakers have told Treasury the rules are tough
but achievable. In response to a question about the need to deploy more
electric vehicle chargers, he also noted that the administration will be
releasing guidance on a
<a href="https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/alternative-fuel-vehicle-refueling-property-credit" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tax
credit for charging stations</a> in the coming weeks.
</p>
<p>
To be clear: Manchin maintained that he was proud of passing the IRA and
stood by its goals. His problem wasn’t with EVs, but rather that the
Biden administration was “willing to bend and break the law” to
implement its “radical climate agenda.”
</p>
<p>
Republicans, meanwhile, used the hearing to raise concerns broader about
the risks EVs pose to the electric grid. Senator John Barasso of Wyoming
cited a
<a href="https://www.nerc.com/news/Headlines%20DL/2023%20LTRA%20Media%20Release.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recent
report</a> that warned of waning supply reliability over the next decade
due to a sharp rise in demand caused in part by electric vehicles, as
well as the retirement of fossil fuel generators.
</p>
<p>
But David Turk, the Deputy Secretary of Energy, responded that EVs can
actually be a solution for the grid because they add new energy storage
capacity and are a flexible source of demand. “The fact that we’re going
to have a whole bunch more batteries out there, that we can determine
when those batteries are charged,” he said, “that’s actually going to be
a more resilient grid if we incorporate that.”
</p>
<p>
This is unlikely to be the last we hear from Manchin about the EV tax
credit. In December, he
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/manchin-opens-new-front-in-war-on-biden-ev-policies/" target="_blank">asked</a>
the Government Accountability Office to issue a legal opinion on whether
Congress could overturn the Treasury’s guidance under the Congressional
Review Act.

id="asus-new-graphics-cards-and-motherboards-replace-12vhpwr-connector-with-a-600w-pcie">ASUS’
new graphics cards and motherboards replace 12VHPWR connector with a
600W PCIe</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-11, from: OS News</p>
<p>At CES 2024, ASUS unveiled a new standard for motherboards, graphics
cards, and cases. Called BTF (short for Back-to-The-Future), it offers
much cleaner cable management with power connectors at the back of a
motherboard. More importantly, it fully ditches the ill-fated 12VHPWR
plug in favor of a much tidier (and probably safer) 600W PCIe connector.
ASUS claims computers with BTF components are easier to assemble since
all plugs and connectors are located at the back side of the motherboard
tray without other components obstructing access to power, SATA, USB,
IO, and other connectors. Therefore, “you won’t have to reach as far
into the depth of your chassis to plug things in.” BTF should also make
cable management much more elegant, resulting in a tidy, showcase-ready
build. ↫ Taras Buria at NeoWin The interior of PCs effectively hasn’t
changed since the ’80s, and it feels like it, too. Many of the
connectors and plugs are unwieldy, in terrible places, hard to
connect/disconnect, difficult to route, and so on. A lot more needs to
be done than putting the connectors on the back of the motherboard and
integrating GPU power delivery into the PCIe slot, but even baby steps
like these are downright revolutionary in the conservative,
change-averse, anti-user world of PC building. I don’t say this very
often, but basically, look at the last Intel Mac Pro. That’s what a
modern PC should look and work like inside.</p>

FAA Investigating Boeing 737 Max 9 After Mid-Air Panel Incident</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Federal Aviation Administration is launching a
formal investigation into the Boeing 737 Max 9 after a cabin panel blew
off an Alaska Airlines ALK.N flight while in mid-air last week, forcing
an emergency landing, the regulator said Thursday. </p>
<p>The FAA grounded 171 Boeing jets installed with the same panel after
the landing, most of which are operated by U.S. carriers Alaska Airlines
and United Airlines, pending safety inspections.  </p>
<p>It is still unclear when the planes will be cleared to fly again, and
the incident is the latest in a series of events that have shaken the
industry’s confidence in the aircraft manufacturer. </p>
<p>The FAA said the Alaska Airlines Max 9 incident “should have never
happened and it cannot happen again.” It told Boeing of the
investigation in a letter on Wednesday “to determine if Boeing failed to
ensure completed products conformed to its approved design and were in a
condition for safe operation in compliance with FAA regulations” and
after learning of “additional discrepancies.”  </p>
<p>“We will cooperate fully and transparently with the FAA and the NTSB
on their investigations,” Boeing said in a statement about the
investigation.  </p>
<p>Boeing did not respond to a request for comment. Its shares were down
1.2% on Thursday. </p>
<p>Both Alaska and United said on Monday they had found loose parts on
multiple grounded aircraft during preliminary checks, raising new
concerns about how Boeing’s best-selling jet family is manufactured. The
two carriers have canceled numerous flights with the planes
grounded. </p>
<p>The carriers still need revised inspection and maintenance
instructions from Boeing that must be approved by the FAA before they
can begin flying the planes again.  </p>
<p>Boeing on Tuesday told staff the findings were being treated as a
“quality control issue” and checks were under way at Boeing and supplier
Spirit AeroSystems SPR.N, Reuters reported previously. </p>
<p>Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun told CNBC on Wednesday that a “quality
escape” was at issue in the Max 9 cabin blowout.  </p>
<p>The Alaska Airlines flight had taken off from Portland, Oregon, on
Friday and was flying at 16,000 feet (4,900 meters) when the panel tore
off the plane, which had been in service for only eight weeks. Pilots
returned the full jet to Portland, with only minor injuries suffered by
people on board. </p>
<p>Boeing’s manufacturing practices “need to comply with the high safety
standards they’re legally accountable to meet,” the FAA added. </p>
<p>U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg declined to say on
Wednesday when the FAA may allow the planes to resume flights but said
it would only be when safe. </p>
<p>“The only consideration on the timeline is safety,” Buttigieg told
reporters. “Until it is ready, it is not ready. Nobody can or should be
rushed in that process.” </p>
<p>In 2019, global authorities subjected all Max planes to a wider
grounding that lasted 20 months after crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia
linked to poorly designed cockpit software killed a total of 346
people. </p>
<p>Boeing ended 2023 in second place behind rival Airbus in aircraft
deliveries for the fifth year running, after seeing its roughly 50%
share of the market eroded by the earlier crisis. Airbus posted record
annual jet orders on Thursday, booking nearly 2,100 net new orders in
2023, while Boeing booked 1,314 net new orders.</p>

Patriots Part Ways with Coach Bill Belichick, Who Led Team to 6 Super
Bowl Championships</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>FOXBOROUGH, Mass. — Six-time National Football League champion Bill
Belichick agreed to part ways as the coach of the New England Patriots,
ending his 24-year tenure as the architect of the most decorated dynasty
of the league’s Super Bowl era.</p>
<p>Belichick and team owner Robert Kraft announced the move to the media
Thursday at Gillette Stadium. They didn’t take questions, though Kraft
scheduled an availability for later in the day.</p>
<p>Belichick, 71, is just the third coach in NFL history to reach 300
career regular-season victories earlier this season, joining Hall of
Famers Don Shula and George Halas. With 333 wins including the playoffs,
Belichick trails only Shula (347) for the record for victories by a
coach.</p>
<p>But the Patriots ended this season 4-13, Belichick’s worst record in
29 seasons as an NFL head coach. It supplanted the 5-11 mark he managed
in his last year in Cleveland in 1995 and again in his first year in New
England in 2000. Including the playoffs, he ends his Patriots tenure
with a 333-178 overall record.</p>
<p>With his cutoff hoodies and ever-present scowl, Belichick teamed with
quarterback Tom Brady to lead the Patriots to six Super Bowl victories,
nine AFC titles and 17 division championships in 19 years. During a less
successful — but also tumultuous — stint with the original Cleveland
Browns, Belichick earned 37 of his career victories.</p>
<p>It’s not immediately clear who Kraft will tap to replace the future
Hall of Famer.</p>
<p>Patriots linebackers coach Jerod Mayo won a Super Bowl ring playing
under Belichick and has interviewed for multiple head coaching vacancies
since becoming a New England assistant in 2019. Mayo turned down a few
interviews last offseason before signing a contract extension to remain
with the Patriots.</p>
<p>Mike Vrabel, who was fired earlier this week by the Tennessee Titans
and won three Super Bowls with the Patriots, is also expected to be a
candidate for the head coaching job.</p>
<p>Belichick had been grooming offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels to
replace him before McDaniels left following the 2021 season to become
the coach of the Raiders. He has since been fired by Las Vegas.
Belichick’s two sons, Steve and Brian, are also on the coaching
staff.</p>
<p>Belichick’s exit from the Patriots comes just a day after another
legendary coach and his longtime friend Nick Saban announced he’d retire
after winning seven college national championships. Saban worked for
Belichick’s father, Steve, in the 1980s as a coach at Navy, and Bill
Belichick hired Saban as his defensive coordinator when he became
Cleveland’s head coach in 1991.</p>
<p>The six Super Bowl wins tie Belichick with pre-merger mentors Halas
and Curly Lambeau for the most NFL championships. Belichick also won two
rings as Bill Parcells’ defensive coordinator with the New York
Giants.</p>
<p>But the Patriots have stumbled to a 29-38 record since Brady departed
following the 2019 season and missed the playoffs in three of those four
seasons. Beginning in 2001 when Brady became the starting quarterback,
the Patriots missed the playoffs only once (2008) when Brady was
injured. This marked New England’s fifth consecutive season without a
playoff victory.</p>
<p>Belichick’s subsequent solutions at quarterback haven’t panned
out.</p>
<p>Brady’s initial replacement, Cam Newton, didn’t resemble the player
who won the 2015 MVP award and was cut after a 7-9 finish in 2020.
Meanwhile Brady won his seventh Super Bowl ring with the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers that same season.</p>
<p>Potential long-term replacement Mac Jones, a 2021 first-round draft
choice, was a Pro Bowl selection as a rookie and led New England to the
playoffs. But he regressed in Year 2 when Belichick put longtime
defensive assistant Matt Patricia in charge of the offense. Jones didn’t
fare much better this season when Bill O’Brien returned as offensive
coordinator. He was benched four times before being replaced as starter
by backup Bailey Zappe for the final six games.</p>
<p>That left the Patriots looking at a lengthy rebuild, with no
candidate on the roster to bring stability to the sport’s most important
position.</p>
<p>Belichick, who also served as the de facto general manager with final
say on personnel decisions, was celebrated for his ingenuity managing
the salary cap during the run of Super Bowl success. It included getting
stars like Brady and others to accept cap-friendly contracts or adjust
their deals to accommodate the signing of other players.</p>
<p>But that acclaim has waned in the years since Brady left, as a run of
draft picks and high-priced free agents didn’t live up to expectations.
In addition, Belichick has seen several members of his personnel and
scouting departments leave for other jobs. The list includes his former
player personnel director, Nick Caserio, who was hired as Houston’s
general manager in 2021.</p>
<p>Now it won’t be Belichick making the decisions for the Patriots on or
off the field.</p>
<p>The only child of a World War II veteran who spent three decades as a
Navy assistant coach, Belichick is a football historian with an
encyclopedic knowledge of strategy from the sport’s early days to
current NFL trends. His players said his attention to detail never left
them unprepared.</p>
<p>Belichick has been a master of the NFL rule book, unearthing
loopholes in clock operations and offensive line formations that –
though entirely legal – cemented his reputation as a mad genius.</p>
<p>But his legacy in New England also includes two major cheating
investigations — and other, minor ones — that cost him and the team
draft picks and more than $1 million in fines. Opponents accused the
Patriots of everything from hacking their headsets to cutting corners on
injury reports.</p>
<p>His friendship with former President Donald Trump, which Belichick
insisted was not political, landed the coach on the list to receive a
Presidential Medal of Freedom in the waning days of the administration.
After the outcry against the U.S. Capitol siege, Belichick announced
“the decision has been made not to move forward.”</p>

<h2 id="albanys-afghan-americans-help-afghan-refugees-resettle">Albany’s
Afghan Americans Help Afghan Refugees Resettle</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Albany, New York — A group of Afghan Americans in Albany, New York,
have opened a community center to help resettle newly arrived Afghans in
the United States. </p>
<p>The Afghans, who fled their country after the Taliban seized power in
Afghanistan in 2021, received help navigating the U.S. immigration
system and starting a new life in the United States.  </p>
<p>“[When] the [Afghan] government collapsed and more Afghans came to
the U.S., the [U.S.] government could not handle [the cases], so we
considered it necessary to support them,” Yousaf Sherzad, vice president
of the Afghan American Community Center, told VOA. “We rented this
office to help the newly arrived Afghans begin their new life here [in
the U.S.].” </p>
<p>The center, which mostly serves families and single men, was launched
in 2021, the same year the United States and its allies left
Afghanistan, evacuating some 130,000 people from Kabul in the chaotic
last weeks of August.  </p>
<p>Through Operation Allies Welcome, about 88,500 Afghan nationals
arrived in the U.S. and resettled in communities across the country.
Operation Allies Welcome was a program that coordinated efforts to
resettle vulnerable Afghans.  </p>
<p>But those left behind are still making their way to the U.S., and
there are limited immigration paths available for those hoping to come
to the United States.</p>
<p>One way is to apply for a visa, but that requires them to travel to a
U.S. embassy for an interview. The closest U.S. embassies to Afghanistan
are in Qatar, Pakistan, or the United Arab Emirates. </p>
<p>Another way is to apply for humanitarian parole on the U.S.
Citizenship and Immigration Services website, but that is a lengthy
process. And although it approves only a few hundred people annually, it
does lead to permanent U.S. residency.  </p>
<p>The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services receives fewer than
2,000 requests for humanitarian parole overall from all nationalities
over the course of a typical year. Of those requests, approximately 500
to 700 are approved. </p>
<p>Since July 1, 2021, the USCIS has received more than 50,420 requests
for humanitarian parole for Afghan nationals, of which they have denied
about 11,020.  </p>
<p>“USCIS has conditionally approved humanitarian parole for
approximately 480 Afghan nationals outside the U.S.,” a Biden official
wrote to VOA in an email on last August.  </p>
<p>A third option for Afghans is to travel to the U.S.-Mexico border and
request asylum protection. The center also helps those who crossed the
U.S.-Mexico border without authorization and ended up in Albany.  </p>
<p>And that is what newly arrived Afghan, Shakor, who did not want to
give his last name for security reasons, decided to do. </p>
<p>“It has been 15 days since we came from Mexico,” Shakor said. “One of
my friends guided me and brought me to the Afghan community.” </p>
<p>Most people working at the center are volunteers who arrived in the
U.S. before August 2021. They went through immigration procedures
themselves and want to help refugees and asylum-seekers because of their
own experience. </p>
<p>“Based on what we have learned, listened and experienced, we want to
make things easier for them by providing them with addresses,
translation and filing their forms,” Sherzad said. </p>
<p>Volunteers at the center say that every day they see and help three
to five Afghans who entered the United States at the U.S.-Mexico
border. </p>

The REAL AI automation threat to workers (11 Jan 2024)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-11, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links The real AI automation threat to workers: The robot
can’t replace you, but it CAN replace your shitty boss. Hey look at
this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2009, 2014, 2019, 2023
Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current
writing projects, current reading The real AI automation threat to
workers (permalink) Long before the current wave of AI hype, we were
being groomed for automation panics with misleading stories. Remember
this one? “‘Truck driver’ is the most common job in America.
Self-driving trucks are just around the corner. How can we prevent
America’s army of truckers from turning into a howling mob when the
robots steal their jobs?”
https://futurism.com/millions-of-jobs-are-at-risk-but-their-loss-could-be-for-the-greater-good
It was absolute nonsense. First of all, “truck driver” isn’t a
particularly common job in America! The BLS lumps together all cargo
vehicle drivers under a single classification. The category error here
was thinking that every delivery van driver, furniture mover, and
courier is behind the wheel of a big rig, cracking wise on a CB radio as
they tear up the interstate. But what about automation threats? It’s
possible that if we redesigned the interstates to give 18 wheelers their
own separated lanes, and then set them to following one another, that
they could traverse long distances in that way. Congratulations, you’ve
just invented a shitty, failure-prone train. “Shitty train AI” does not
threaten the job of the vast number of people the BLS classifies as
“truck drivers.” For one thing, “shitty train AI” isn’t going to pilot a
UPS van around the streets of a busy city with other road users. Sure, a
few robotaxi companies have bamboozled city governments into
conscripting the city’s residents into an uncontrolled murderbot
experiment. These are not going well:
https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/9-key-leaders-depart-gms-cruise-amid-ongoing-investigation-into-san-francisco-incident/
More than $100b has been set on fire chasing the robotaxi dream, and the
result is most charitably described as a technological curiosity,
requiring 1.5 high-waged remote technicians to replace each low-waged
driver:
https://pluralistic.net/2022/10/09/herbies-revenge/#100-billion-here-100-billion-there-pretty-soon-youre-talking-real-money
But even if we could perfect this technology, robots still wouldn’t
replace all those “truckers” who drive delivery vans (to say nothing of
moving vans!). The hard part of driving a UPS van isn’t just getting it
from place to place – it’s getting the parcel into the place. The
robo-van would still need at least one person to get the parcel from the
back of the van and into the reception desk, porch, or other delivery
zone. It’s not going to fire those parcels at your door with a catapult.
It’s also not going to deliver them by drones. Drone delivery is another
one of those historical curiosities, capable of delivering a very narrow
range of parcels, under even narrower circumstances:
https://pluralistic.net/2021/08/05/comprehensive-sex-ed/#droned If all
UPS delivered was lightweight, non-fragile rectangular parcels ordered
by people with large, unobstructed back yards, then sure. Congrats,
you’ve just created the world’s least-useful parcel delivery service!
https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/06/amazon-drone-delivery-service-seeks-faa-approval-to-launch-in-2022/
All that said, the big rig drivers probably don’t need to worry about
robots stealing their jobs. It’s not even clear that “shitty train” is
within our technological grasp, but even if it is, there’s yet another
problem with the AI automation trucker jobpocalypse: “trucker” is
already one of the worst jobs in America:
https://www.usatoday.com/pages/interactives/news/rigged-forced-into-debt-worked-past-exhaustion-left-with-nothing/
It’s hard to overstate just how fucking terrible it is to be a trucker.
Truckers are trapped in abusive debt holes by their employers – who
misclassify their workforce as “contractors” in a bid to sidestep labor
law. Shriven of any labor rights, truckers are forced into the most
ghastly, body-destroying, family-wrcking, financially precarious
existence imaginable. You can drive a truck for years, give almost all
of the money you earn back to your employer (who denies that you’re
their employee) to pay back the usurious loan for your truck. Then, your
employer can underschedule for shifts so that you miss a loan payment,
and they can repo your truck and keep the six-figure repayment you’ve
already made to them, leaving you destitute. They can force you to work
for hours – days! – without pay while you wait for loading and dispatch.
They can make you drive long past the point of safety, then, if (when)
you get into a wreck, they can fine you for not taking the mandated rest
breaks. Now, these drivers aren’t about to be replaced by AI – but that
doesn’t mean that AI won’t affect their jobs. Commercial drivers are
among the most heavily surveilled workers in the country. Amazon’s
drivers (whom Amazon misclassifies as subcontractors) have their
eyeballs monitored by AI;
https://pluralistic.net/2022/04/17/revenge-of-the-chickenized-reverse-centaurs/
AIs monitor the voices of the (primarily Black, primarily female)
workforce at Arise – homeworkers who field customer service calls for
blue-chip companies like Carnival Cruises and Disney. They’re listening
for unruly children or pets in the background, and workers who fail to
muffle these dependents lose the contracts they have to pay to train
for: https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/22/paperback-writer/#toothless And
AI monitors the conduct of workers on temp-work apps. If a worker is
dispatched to a struck workplace and refuses to cross the picket-line,
the AI boss fires you and blacklists you from future jobs for refusing
to robo-scab:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/07/30/computer-says-scab/#instawork Writing
in The Guardian, Steven Greenhouse describes the AI-enabled workplace,
where precarious, often misclassified workers are monitored, judged, and
fined by algorithms:
https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/07/artificial-intelligence-surveillance-workers
Whether it’s the robot that gets you disciplined for sending an email
with the word “union” in it or the robot that takes money out of your
paycheck if you take a bathroom break, AI has come for the workplace
with a vengeance. Here’s a supreme irony: nearly all of the beneficial
applications for AI require that AI be used to help workers, not replace
them, which is absolutely not how AI is used in the workplace. An AI
that helps radiologists by giving them a second opinion might help them
find tumors on x-rays, but that’s a tool that reduces the number of
scans a radiologist processes in a shift, by making them go back and
reconsider the scans they’ve already processed:
https://locusmag.com/2023/12/commentary-cory-doctorow-what-kind-of-bubble-is-ai/
But AI’s sales pitch is not “Buy an AI tool and increase your costs
while increasing your accuracy.” The pitch for AI is “buy and AI and
save money by firing workers.” Given how bad AIs are at replacing
humans, this is a bad deal all around, both for the worker who loses
their job and the customer who gets the substandard product the AI
makes. There is a very limited slice of applications where an AI could
make a lot of money for a company that deploys it, without costing that
company anything when the AI screws up. For example, AI is a really good
tool for fraud! Rather than paying people to churn out millions of
variations on a phishing email, you can get an AI to do it. If the AI
writes a bad phishing email, it’s OK, since nearly all recipients of
even good phishing emails delete them. What’s more, no one will fine you
or publish an op-ed demanding that your board of directors fire you if
you buy an incompetent AI to commit fraud. Fraud is a high-value,
low-consequence environment for using AI. Another one of those
applications is managing precarious workers who don’t have labor rights.
If the AI unfairly docks your worker’s wages, or forces them to work
until they injure themselves or others, or decides that their eyeball
movements justify firing them, those workers have no recourse. That’s
the whole point of pretending that your employees are contractors: so
you can violate labor law with impunity! But that’s not the ironic part.
The ironic part is that “being a shitty boss” is the one AI application
that companies are willing to increase their net spending on. No one
buys an eyeball-monitoring AI so they can fire a manager. This is the
one place where AI is there to augment, rather than replace, an
employee. This makes AI-based bossware subtly different from other forms
of Taylorism, the “scientific management” fad of the early 20th century
that saw management consultants choreographing the postures and
movements of workers to satisfy the aesthetic fetishes of their
employers:
https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/24/gwb-rumsfeld-monsters/#bossware The
pseudoscientific cod-ergonomics of the 1900s was demeaning and even
dangerous, but it wasn’t automated, and if it increased worker output,
this was incidental to the real purpose of making workers move like the
machine-cogs their bosses reassured themselves they were:
https://pluralistic.net/2022/08/21/great-taylors-ghost/#solidarity-or-bust
Every AI panic is a way of deflecting attention from the real, grimy,
here-and-now ways that AI is destroying our lives by demanding that we
entertain nonsensical science fiction claims about large, shiny
existential risks that AI might present in the future. The “X-risk” of
the spicy autocomplete chatbot waking up and using its newfound
sentience to turn us all into paperclips is nonsense. Adding words to
the plausible sentence generator doesn’t turn it into a
superintelligence for the same reason that selectively breeding faster
horses leads to locomotives:
https://locusmag.com/2020/07/cory-doctorow-full-employment/ But there is
a way that AI could destroy the human race! The carbon footprint and
water consumption associated with training and operating large-scale
models are significant contributors to the climate emergency, which
threatens the habitability of the only planet in the known universe
capable of sustaining human life:
https://www.forbes.com/sites/federicoguerrini/2023/04/14/ais-unsustainable-water-use-how-tech-giants-contribute-to-global-water-shortages/
Likewise, AI isn’t going to replace you at work. But it’s already
augmenting your shitty boss’s ability to rip you off, torment you, maim
you and even kill you in order to eke out a few more basis points for
the next shareholder report. Science fiction is a fun and useful way to
tell parables about our current technologies. But it’s not a roadmap for
the future. The fact that sf writers like me found AIs as useful
measures to describe Earth’s dominant artificial life form – the limited
liability corporation – doesn’t mean that superhuman AIs should – or can
– be created. (Image: Cryteria, CC BY 3.0, modified) Hey look at this

<p>date: 2024-01-11, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
Overall inflation ticked up to 3.4% year over year in December, which is
higher than November’s inflation rate. But, if you take out food and
energy prices (which are notoriously volatile), inflation actually
slowed down slightly. We look at how to slice today’s inflation report.
Then, wage growth has been slowing, an IRS watchdog report shows mixed
grades, and the SEC approves a bitcoin ETF.

<p>
The consumer electronics show in Las Vegas formally known as CES has
evolved beyond a showcase for ever-larger screens, laptops, and niche
gadgets looking to make it into big box retailers. CES is now, among
other things, a full-fledged auto show, with the world’s largest
automakers announcing ambitious products alongside — and sometimes in
partnership with — their tech counterparts.
</p>
<p>
In recent years, new electric concepts from
<a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/gm-ces-2021-keynote-chevy-cadillac-flying-cars-concepts/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Chevrolet</a>,
<a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/ces-2022-car-roundup-bmw-cadillac-chevy-chrysler-hyundai-mercedes-sony/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BMW</a>,
and
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/5/23540709/ram-1500-revolution-concept-ev-truck-ces-photos-specs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ram</a>
have each captured attention. This year, it was Honda’s turn to make a
splash.
</p>
<p>
After two decades of dipping its toes into the electric vehicle market,
the Japanese carmaker announced the new 0 Series (as in zero emissions)
with two concepts that show what Honda wants to bring to the U.S. market
in 2026.
</p>
<p>
The flagship
<a href="https://www.roadandtrack.com/news/a46328379/hondas-saloon-concept-looks-right-out-of-cyberpunk/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Saloon</a>
sedan’s sleek, swept-back design is a material manifestation of what
Honda calls its man maximum/machine minimum packaging concept (in case
you’re looking for an acronym, it’s M/M*1), which boils down to making
the car’s footprint as small as possible while still keeping passengers
comfortable. On the other end of the svelte-practical spectrum is the
<a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/g46317582/honda-saloon-space-hub-concepts-revealed-gallery/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Space-Hub</a>,
which applies the venerable minivan concept in an EV format with extra
space and seating that swivels to create a rolling lounge.
</p>
<p>
Honda was also at CES in partnership with Sony, which showed the latest
iteration of its
<a href="https://www.shm-afeela.com/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Afeela</a>
prototype, the electronics company’s first foray into the automotive
world. Sony’s Playstation division clearly got its hands on the concept,
which means augmented reality displays built on the game development
platform Unreal Engine that feature eye-popping 3D graphics. If you
want, you can have a monster magically appear on the roadway as you’re
driving. You can also visualize yourself driving underwater. On stage at
least, the car could be steered with a Playstation controller.
</p>
<p>
Kia was back in Las Vegas to announce its hyper-modular,
commercial-focused
<a href="https://www.kiamedia.com/us/en/media/pressreleases/21668/kia-announces-platform-beyond-vehicle-business-at-ces-2024-to-go-beyond-mobility" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Platform
Beyond Vehicle</a> strategy. Showing five models in three sizes all
based on the platform, the new lineup will begin with the PV5 and focus
on delivery, ride-hailing, and smaller commercial work (think your local
electrician) thanks to its Lego-like “life modules” and powertrains.
</p>
<p>
This being 2024, AI is everywhere at CES, even in car world, with
Volkswagen incorporating ChatGPT into its Ida voice assistant, Mercedes
updating its MBUX Virtual Assistant with a new “empathetic” AI, and
Intel designing a new family of AI-infused systems-on-chips to monitor
drivers and passengers in an autonomous future.
</p>
<p>
While most CES concepts aren’t headed for roads anytime soon, one thing
you might be able to buy is the latest offering from Vietnamese EV maker
VinFast. While its U.S. launch is
<a href="https://jalopnik.com/vinfast-vf8-electric-car-first-drive-not-ready-for-u-s-1849892217" target="_blank">off
to a rocky start</a>, the ultra-compact VF3 might be cute enough to keep
the critics at bay, with its bulldog stance and incredibly diminutive
size. Measuring in at just a little under 10.5 feet, the VF3 is nearly
two feet shorter than
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/fiat-500e-morgan-xp-1-electric-cars" target="_self">the
new Fiat 500E</a> or about the same size as a Smart car. Coupled with
its off-roader looks and a claimed 125-mile range, the VF3 could be the
smallest, affordable, and most adorable EVs for sale in the U.S.

<h2 id="ecosia">Ecosia</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-11, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/ecosia.png" alt="screenshot of the ecosia homepage with a search bar in the middle and playful colors and illustrations at the borders" height="719" width="1200">
<p>
Last year I switched my default search engine twice. First from Bing to
Duck Duck Go. It felt different but during
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2023/01/shadow-banned-by-duckduckgo-and-bing/">my
Bing de-listing fiasco</a> I learned that Duck Duck Go and lots of other
smaller search engines use the Bing Index. One of the more interesting
engines I learned about was Ecosia, a green search engine that I
switched to a couple months ago.
</p>
<p>
Ecosia’s twist on the search engine game is that for every ~50 searches
you do, they plant 1 tree. They serve you ads and that revenue pays for
trees. It seems gimmicky or unbelievable, but Ecosia posts
<a href="https://blog.ecosia.org/ecosia-financial-reports-tree-planting-receipts/">all
their financials are on their website</a>. I find that to be a
refreshing amount of transparency from a search engine. According to the
website, in October they financed the planting of ~2.5 million trees in
12 different countries. That’s admirable.
</p>
<p>
Getting rewarded by a search engine for searching isn’t new to me. I
switched to Bing in 2015 as part of #davegoeswindows and one neat side
effect was that I got “Bing Bucks” for my searches which I could convert
into gift cards to use at real stores; paid to play. For years I ran a
grift of converting Bing Bucks into Robux for the kids. Now I’m doing
that same grift, but for trees for my children’s future. In a couple
months since switching I’ve funded 20 trees which feels nice.
</p>
<p>
How big of a difference can a “green” search engine make? Good question
and I spent a dumb amount of time looking into this.
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.02001.pdf">Based on some
research</a> Ecosia calculates that one search offsets 50kg of CO₂.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“The tree planting that we’re doing, with each search, you’re actually
removing around 50 kilograms of CO₂.” Source:
<a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/microsoft-rate-hikes-for-bing-use-may-put-this-google-alternative-out-of">PCMag</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Is 50kg a lot? It sounds like a lot, but I need that in terms I
understand. This summer I learned that
<a href="https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/contentincludes/co2_inc.htm">a
gallon of gas weighs 6.3lbs (2.8kg) yet produces 20lbs (9kg) of CO₂</a>.
Gas is a form of carbon emissions I understand, so let’s use that as a
baseline.
</p>
<p>
If my math is correct and every search removes 50kg of CO₂… that’s equal
to offsetting 5.5 gallons of gas… or about one jerrycan.
</p>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/search-jerry.svg" alt="illustration of a magnifying glass with 1x, two equals signs, and a crude jerry can" height="390" width="798">
<p>
<a href="(https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/byclass/Standard_SUV_2WD2023.shtml)">According
to FuelEconomy.gov, the average non-hybrid/non-electric SUV in 2024 gets
an average of ~20.6
MPG</a><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>.
One search then offsets ~113 miles of driving in an
SUV<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>.
Making that specific to my life, it takes three searches to offset a
tank of gas in my Volvo and seven for my F-150. Those numbers are good
enough to make me a bit skeptical.
</p>
<p>
Planting trees isn’t a climate silver
bullet<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>.
Trees take years to grow and a gallon of gas burns in less than an hour.
Trees will struggle to grow in hotter climates as well. There’s no
replacement for carbon reduction…but —as we say in Texas— it’s not
nothing? Tree planting is potentially

220 gigaton opportunity</a> and currently the only viable form of carbon
capture and storage.
</p>
<p>
I looked into how much planting a tree costs and the prices vary from $1
to $3 dollars. The
<a href="https://shop.arborday.org/campaign/reforestation-007/give">Arbor
Day Foundation</a> costs $1/tree,
<a href="https://preserve.nature.org/page/81927/donate/1?engrid_session=MTMxNDk0ZjEtOGEwYi00OWZhLTlkMzItN2I5ZWYzMTBlOGEyfDE3MDMxMjUwNDZ8MTcwMzEyNTA4OXwxfGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVjb3NpYS5vcmd8fGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVjb3NpYS5vcmd8">The
Nature Conservancy</a> and
<a href="https://treeswaterpeople.org/give-a-gift">Trees, Water,
People</a> both cost ~$2/tree. And Ecosia’s own
<a href="https://plant.ecosia.org/products/trees-for-climate-action?variant=37125904662702">Ecosia
Tree Store</a> comes in at the highest at $3/tree. That means by
searching I’ve planted anywhere from $20-$60 worth of trees. It might be
more effective if I donated a lump sum and installed an ad blocker; but
Ecosia’s trees are an entirely passive benefit and that makes it
sustainable for me. I think about it like putting a solar panel on my
air conditioner.
</p>
<p>
Ecosia’s use of the Bing Index might be a dealbreaker for some, but all
that might be changing! Due to a price hike in the Bing Index,
<a href="https://blog.ecosia.org/new-search-features/">Ecosia announced
that in certain locales they’re switching to the Google Index</a>. I’ve
used Bing’s Index for years so this isn’t a problem for me, but I
understand people are picky about their search results. I’d also call
out that <a href="https://xeiaso.net/blog/birth-death-seo/">the entire
SEO ecosystem is changing with the advent of AI</a> and the reliability
of search results will experience a tectonic shift. Speaking of AI… at
the end of that same announcement post, Ecosia says they’re piloting an
experimental AI Chat feature.
</p>
<p>
Ecosia is a feel-good search engine and I love the idea of a
benefit-corp style search engine. I want my “behavioral exhaust”
(<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Age-Surveillance-Capitalism-Future-Frontier/dp/1610395697">Zubhoff,
2019</a>) to replenish the environment rather than fund the
techno-monopoly war chest. Ecosia is a welcome change in my online life.
It’s well-designed compared to other search engines and planting 20
trees feels good. If we all pointed our search bars at Ecosia for a
while, what kind of difference could we make. Alone, we will never make
a dent in the climate but together we stand a chance.
</p>
<p>
And that’s where I wanted to end this review but…
</p>
<p>
I wanted this to be a review of a new’ish search engine that I enjoy,
but I need to address the LLM in the room. In short, the AI feature
seems off-brand for Ecosia –like Captain Planet getting into Bitcoin. At
<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/chatgpt-generative-ai-water-use-environmental-impact-study-2023-4">500ml
of water for every 20 prompts</a> or
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/chatgpt-gpt4-iowa-ai-water-consumption-microsoft-f551fde98083d17a7e8d904f8be822c4">1.7
billion gallons of water to train GPT</a>, LLMs use a lot of energy and
resources. Ecosia claims they are able to offset the carbon costs of
LLMs – I’d love to see more data on this – but when every search engine
is experimenting in this space, it’d be nice to have an option that’s
taking a different path.

Exclusive: Blinken to Meet Veteran Chinese Diplomat Liu Before Taiwan
Election</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken plans to meet
with veteran Chinese diplomat Liu Jianchao in Washington on Friday, a
day before Taiwan’s election, as the United States continues to caution
China against using the election as a pretext for instability.</p>
<p>Communication between the world’s two largest economies will continue
after Taiwan’s presidential and legislative elections on January 13, as
senior officials from the United States and China are slated to attend
next week’s World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.</p>
<p>On Friday, Blinken will hold talks at the U.S. State Department with
Liu, who heads the Chinese Communist Party’s international department
responsible for maintaining relations with foreign political
parties.</p>
<p>Daniel Kritenbrink, the State Department’s top diplomat on East Asian
and Pacific affairs, will join the hourlong meeting, according to people
familiar with the planning.</p>
<p>Next week, Blinken and Chinese Premier Li Qiang will attend the
annual economic meetings at the Swiss mountain resort.</p>
<p>The talks are described as ongoing efforts to maintain open lines of
communication, responsibly manage differences between the two nations
and address a host of issues.</p>
<p>These include combating the fentanyl crisis as well as global and
regional security concerns. Taiwan will also be among the topics.</p>
<p>Washington has voiced its opposition to “outside interference or
malign influence” in Taiwan’s elections.</p>
<p>The winner of Taiwan’s presidential election will be inaugurated on
May 20. The transition period in the upcoming months is seen as
sensitive in cross-strait relations.</p>
<p>A senior U.S. administration official told reporters late Wednesday
that Beijing would be “the provocateur” if it chooses to respond to
Taiwan’s election results with additional military pressure or
coercion.</p>
<p>“Throughout this election and transition period, we will ensure that
channels of communication remain open with Beijing, including diplomatic
and the recently reopened military-to-military channels, in keeping with
past precedent and our unofficial relationship with Taiwan,” said the
U.S. official.</p>
<p>A number of meetings</p>
<p>This week, U.S.-China officials are holding numerous meetings. The
U.S. principal deputy national security adviser, Jon Finer, held lengthy
talks with Liu on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The White House said the two sides discussed the ongoing
implementation of key outcomes from last November’s summit between U.S.
President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, challenges in the
Middle East and Russia’s war against Ukraine. Finer stressed the
importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and in the
South China Sea.</p>
<p>U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas held virtual
talks on Wednesday with Chinese Minister of Public Security Wang
Xiaohong, discussing the combatting of the illicit flow of synthetic
drugs.</p>
<p>Science and Technology Agreement</p>
<p>At the State Department, officials from the two countries discussed
the extension of the U.S.-China Science and Technology Agreement, or
STA, which is due to expire next month. Officials will meet again during
the week of January 22 to discuss the extension.</p>
<p>Late last August, Washington agreed to extend the agreement with
China for six months. The short-term extension comes as several
Republican congressional members voice concern that China has previously
leveraged the agreement to advance its military objectives and may
continue to do so.</p>
<p>At that time, the State Department stated the brief extension would
maintain the STA’s validity while the U.S. negotiates with China to
amend and strengthen the agreement.</p>
<p>A call for reciprocity</p>
<p>Some former U.S. officials are skeptical about whether frequent talks
can fundamentally change Beijing’s behaviors, which are deemed as
harming Washington’s national interests. They also advocate for
“reciprocity.”</p>
<p>“Every time a People’s Republic of China [PRC] emissary is allowed to
address the American people, an American emissary needs to be able to
directly address the Chinese people. If the PRC won’t accept this, then
we are foolish to keep giving people like Liu direct access,” said David
Stilwell, a former assistant secretary of state for East Asian and
Pacific affairs.</p>
<p>Liu delivered a speech on Tuesday during an event hosted by the
Council on Foreign Relations.</p>
<p>Liu is seen as a contender to be China’s next foreign minister,
according to some media reports and analysts.</p>
<p>“Liu has taken on a more active diplomatic role and has been
performing tasks typically handled by China’s foreign minister,” said
Chechuan Lee, a research fellow at the Taipei-based quasi-official
Institute for National Defense and Security Research.</p>

New York Civil Fraud Trial Heads to Closing Arguments After Bomb
Threat</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — Donald Trump ’s New York civil fraud trial is back in
session Thursday for closing arguments after authorities responded to a
bomb threat at the home of the judge who moved this week to prevent the
former president from delivering his own closing statements.</p>
<p>Authorities responded to the threat at Judge Arthur Engoron’s home on
Long Island, a court official said. The proceedings are not expected to
be delayed as a result.</p>
<p>Trump, the leading contender for the Republican presidential
nomination, had angled to deliver his own closing remarks in the
courtroom, in addition to summations from his legal team, but a judge
nixed that unusual plan Wednesday.</p>
<p>That will leave the last words to the lawyers in a trial over
allegations that Trump exaggerated his wealth on financial statements he
provided to banks, insurance companies and others.</p>
<p>“There was a threat. I can confirm a bomb threat,” said Al Baker, a
court spokesperson. “As of now we are going forward as scheduled and the
court proceedings and closing arguments are going ahead as planned.”</p>
<p>New York Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat, wants the judge
to impose $370 million in penalties. Trump says he did nothing wrong,
didn’t lie about his fortune and is the victim of political
persecution.</p>
<p>The former president had hoped to make that argument personally, but
the judge — initially open to the idea — said no after a Trump lawyer
missed a deadline for agreeing to ground rules. Among them, Judge
Engoron warned that Trump couldn’t use his closing remarks to “deliver a
campaign speech” or use the opportunity to impugn the judge and his
staff.</p>
<p>Trump is still expected to be in court as a spectator, despite the
death of his mother in-law, Amalija Knavs, and the launch of the
presidential primary season Monday with the Iowa caucus.</p>
<p>Since the trial began Oct. 2, Trump has gone to court nine times to
observe, testify and complain to TV cameras about the case, which he
called a “witch hunt and a disgrace.”</p>
<p>He clashed with Engoron and state lawyers during 3½ hours on the
witness stand in November and remains under a limited gag order after
making a disparaging and false social media post about the judge’s law
clerk.</p>
<p>Thursday’s arguments are part of a busy legal and political stretch
for Trump.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, he was in court in Washington, D.C., to watch appeals
court arguments over whether he is immune from prosecution on charges
that he plotted to overturn the 2020 election — one of four criminal
cases against him. Trump has pleaded not guilty.</p>
<p>James sued Trump in 2022 under a state law that gives the state
attorney general broad power to investigate allegations of persistent
fraud in business dealings.</p>
<p>Engoron decided some of the key issues before testimony began. In a
pretrial ruling, he found that Trump had committed years of fraud by
lying about his riches on financial statements with tricks like claiming
his Trump Tower penthouse was nearly three times its actual size, or
valuing his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida at more than $612 million based
on the idea that the property could be developed for residential use,
when he had signed an agreement surrendering rights to develop it for
any uses but a club.</p>
<p>The trial involves six undecided claims, including allegations of
conspiracy, insurance fraud and falsifying business records.</p>
<p>Trump’s company and two of his sons, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr.,
are also defendants.</p>
<p>Besides monetary damages, James wants Trump and his co-defendants
barred from doing business in New York.</p>
<p>State lawyers say that by making himself seem richer, Trump qualified
for better loan terms from banks, saving him at least $168 million.</p>
<p>Trump contends his financial statements actually understated his net
worth. He said the outside accountants that helped prepare the
statements should’ve flagged any discrepancies and that the documents
came with disclaimers that shield him from liability.</p>
<p>Engoron said he is deciding the case because neither side asked for a
jury and state law doesn’t allow for juries for this type of lawsuit. He
said he hopes to have a decision by the end of the month.</p>
<p>Last month, in a ruling denying a defense bid for an early verdict,
the judge signaled he’s inclined to find Trump and his co-defendants
liable on at least some claims.</p>
<p>“Valuations, as elucidated ad nauseam in this trial, can be based on
different criteria analyzed in different ways,” Engoron wrote in the
Dec. 18 ruling. “But a lie is still a lie.”</p>

finish line, the IEA concluded.

Renewable capacity hit almost 510 gigawatts (GW) in 2023, with China
seeing the most explosive growth, but the U.S., Europe, and Brazil also
hit all-time highs. Solar was the real workhorse, accounting for 75% of
the expansion. The report includes this quite astonishing statistic:<em>
<strong>“The world is on course to add more renewable capacity in the
next five years than has been installed since the first commercial
renewable energy power plant was built more than 100 years
ago.”</strong></em><br/><br/>The current growth rate puts the world on
course to increase renewable capacity by two-and-a-half times by 2030,
said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol. He calls on governments to
prioritize policy changes that speed up renewables development, and
highlights the need for more financing in developing countries to help
them with the energy transition. “Success in meeting the tripling goal
will hinge on this,” Birol

put the number at around 140,000 at the end of 2022, installed across
53,000 stations. Huge gaps in coverage remain across the country,
fueling range anxiety among would-be EV buyers. The new grants are split
between 22 states and Puerto Rico and will support 47 infrastructure
projects, including 7,500 charging ports. About half of the money will
go to “community” projects in urban and rural communities. The other
half will go to “corridor” projects along roadways that are expected to
“fill gaps in the core national charging and alternative-fueling
network,” according to the U.S. Department of Transportation’s press

presidential hopeful’s lips on Wednesday, both at CNN’s debate in Iowa
between Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and former UN Ambassador Nikki
Haley, and at former President Donald Trump’s competing town hall on Fox
News. DeSantis reiterated his promise to reverse President Biden’s clean
energy policy, facetiously calling it the “Green New Deal.” Haley took
her own stab at Biden’s “green subsidies” while answering a question
about funding Ukraine and Israel. And for his part, Trump said Biden
should “go into the energy business instead of this green new scam
business that they’re in.”<br/><br/>Sinha notes that “at no point during
the fifth Republican presidential debate or Trump’s town hall was the
Inflation Reduction Act mentioned by name.”

an alarming development that raises concerns about how easily the virus
can spread among mammals. The virus, which has killed millions of birds
across the world, was detected in elephant seals and fur seals on the
sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia. Researchers believe migrating
birds from South America brought the virus with them. Last week
officials in Alaska confirmed a polar bear had died from the disease.
“If a bird is weakened by avian influenza, or succumbs to it, polar
bears aren’t fussy about what eat,” Andrew Derocher, a polar bear
biologist at the University of Alberta,

There is a high likelihood of an interaction between climate change,
avian influenza, bird mortality, and polar bears.”

published in <em>Nature</em>. The researchers examined data from
hundreds of river basins across the U.S. and Europe and found that about
20% of them saw a decline in snowpack – which is the total mass of snow
that accumulates on the ground – over the last 40 years. “We see a
pattern of snow change that is only consistent with human emissions,”
Alex Gottlieb, a graduate student at Dartmouth College and lead author
on the new study,

<em>The Washington Post</em>. The researchers also seem to have
discovered a snow “cliff” – a tipping point temperature of 17 degrees
Fahrenheit – at which snow loss accelerates very quickly. They say more
than 2 billion people who rely on snow melt as a source of water are
near the cliffedge.

<h2 id="a-sublime-solution-to-climates-hardest-problem">A Sublime
Solution to Climate’s Hardest Problem</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-11, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTAyODA5My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2MjM2NDQwMX0.A05dIenVMfV3DZd2jiOYADOhSvJIhj6lWEfDdWtQCq8/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Over the past several months, in the sleepy city of Holyoke,
Massachusetts, bulldozers have been tearing down a former paper mill.
The newly leveled ground on the western banks of the Connecticut River
is on its way to becoming the home of a big, industrial bet. If it pays
off, what was once known as the Paper City could soon become the Clean
Cement Capital — of the country, at least. Sublime Systems, a startup
that has developed a process for producing the ubiquitous building
material without releasing any carbon emissions, has chosen the site for
its first commercial factory.
</p>
<p>
“It’s poetic justice,” Sublime’s CEO and co-founder, Leah Ellis, told
me. “We’re excited about bringing clean technology to this community
which has been damaged by a legacy of pollution from the old industry
that used to happen there.”
</p>
<p>
The word cement is often used interchangeably with concrete, but it’s
actually a key ingredient in the stuff that gets mixed and poured and
hardened into sidewalks, roads, buildings. It is the glue that binds
together sand, water, and gravel to form the fabric of our built
environment. It’s also a major source of carbon emissions — 8% of the
global total. And these aren’t like other kinds of emissions.
</p>
<p>
Scientists often split the climate problem into two categories. There’s
the carbon that we know how to eliminate, like from power generation,
home heating, and cars. And then there’s a group called the “hard to
decarbonize” stuff — mostly emissions from industrial activities where
clean solutions are still in early stages and not cost competitive.
Cement is the poster child.
</p>
<p>
That’s because more than half of the emissions from cement come from a
chemical reaction that’s intrinsic to its production. Cement consists of
lime, silica, and water. It’s made by first heating up limestone in a
kiln to more than 1,400 degrees Celsius (2,550 degrees Fahrenheit) — a
level of heat that can typically be achieved only by burning coal or
natural gas — to produce reactive lime. The bigger problem, though, is
that limestone contains carbon, and as it heats up, that carbon is
released as a gas. So even if you could heat the kiln with clean
electricity instead of coal, there would still be carbon emitted by the
process.
</p>
<p>
But Sublime has found another way. Ellis and her cofounder Yet-Ming
Chiang — a serial entrepreneur who is also behind the buzzy battery
startup Form Energy — developed a new way to make reactive lime that
does not require limestone. Instead of heating up rocks in a kiln, they
drive the chemical process with electric currents. This enables the
company to avoid limestone and use a variety of other raw materials that
do not contain carbon to produce lime.
</p>
<p>
When Ellis described her breakthrough to me, it sounded incredibly
simple, like it might be obvious to anyone with a background in
electrochemistry. “Why didn’t anyone else think of this?” I wanted to
know.
</p>
<p>
“I believe this way of making cement is going to be obvious in
retrospect, in a post-carbon world where you don’t use fossil fuels,
where you’re penalized for CO2 emissions,” she told me. But she said
there were three factors that led to this innovation in this moment.
</p>
<p>
First, we’ve reached a tipping point in figuring out how to decarbonize
the electric grid. “That is the one key enabler. Once you’ve got a clean
grid, that’s the tool to decarbonizing everything else.”
</p>
<p>
Second, Ellis happened to be in the right place at the right time. She
started her career as a battery scientist and founded Sublime while
completing a postdoc at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The
interdisciplinary nature of the school, where she could collaborate with
other departments, enabled her to expand the bounds of what she could do
with her expertise.
</p>
<p>
And third, the technology Sublime uses to drive its chemical process — a
device called an electrolyzer — has become much cheaper. Though
electrolyzers have been around for a long time, they’ve recently
benefited from increased economies of scale as interest in using them
for applications like clean hydrogen production has grown.
</p>
<p>
For the past year, Sublime has been honing its process at a small pilot
plant in Somerville, Massachusetts, a suburb of Boston. The new plant in
Holyoke is designed to be many times larger — producing up to 30,000
tons of cement per year — though still smaller than the million tons per
year that an average cement plant produces. The site is about half a
mile down the river from a hydroelectric dam — a key consideration for
the company, since it needs to power the plant with clean electricity.
</p>
<p>
The project is not yet fully financed, but Sublime has received $1
million in tax credits from the state of Massachusetts and is holding
out hope for a federal grant from the Department of Energy’s Office of
Clean Energy Demonstrations.
</p>
<p>
There are a number of other emerging methods to reduce emissions from
cement, including alternative chemical combinations and installing
carbon capture equipment on cement plants, but it’s far from being
removed from the “hard to decarbonize” club. The question, as always, is
whether Sublime and others will be able to produce a high-quality
product — one that passes the strength and durability tests required for
the construction industry — at scale, and at a competitive price.
</p>
<p>
Sublime’s product is certainly more expensive than conventional cement
today. But its solution is cheaper than using carbon capture, Ellis
said. Capturing the carbon from a cement plant generally requires a big
increase in energy use. And while the technology has been under
development for decades, it’s so far failed to be applied economically
outside the natural gas processing industry. In a world where builders
are required to use lower-carbon materials, or where there’s a price on
carbon, Ellis thinks Sublime will have an advantage. Governments at
various levels in the U.S. have already started to implement “buy clean”
programs that require the use of lower-carbon cement for state and
federal construction projects, so Sublime may have an edge in some
markets once its Holyoke plant is up and running.
</p>
<p>
“Our process is true zero,” she said. “It just doesn’t emit.”

Next Lite handheld announced with SteamOS Linux</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-11, from: OS News</p>
<p>inally we’re seeing another handheld vendor jump in with Linux. The
AYANEO NEXT LITE was announced today and much like the Steam Deck, they
plan to ship it with SteamOS! AYANEO are one of the top brands when it
comes to PC handhelds, so it’s really interesting to see them be one of
the first to jump in like this. If Linux is a success for them, no doubt
they will do more and other vendors will follow along. ↫ Liam Dawe It
was inevitable for SteamOS to spread beyond just the Steam Deck, but an
important note to make here is that Ayaneo is not working together with
Valve. Instead, they’re using HoloIso, one of the community-maintained
variants of SteamOS anyone can use and install. I’m a bit surprised by
this, since moving SteamOS beyond just Valve products in an official
capacity seems like a no-brainer for Valve; they’re not really in it for
the hardware money, after all, and instead earn their money from Steam
game sales. I’m fairly convinced this isn’t the last time we’re seeing a
non-Valve product with SteamOS, but I’d rather have Valve involved in
the process before spending any money on one of these.</p>

panels</a>. But our home state of Texas provides a more cautionary tale,
particularly when it comes to the generation of renewable energy itself.
</p>
<p>
At the University of Texas at Austin, we recently conducted a study that
investigated how unprecedented investment in the state’s clean energy
industry has affected legislation. To put it bluntly, the results were
the opposite of what renewable advocates would hope to see.
</p>
<p>
After winter storm Uri battered Texas in 2021, leading to major power
outages, Republicans in the Texas state legislature introduced numerous
bills to address what they claimed was the major culprit: renewable
energy. (Democrats blamed fossil fuels.) Wind and solar had grown
exponentially in recent years, turning Texas into the first and second
largest state for their provision respectively. Nevertheless, along with
bills to increase gas power production and reliability, Republicans
targeted renewable energy for increased regulation, higher fees, and
outright construction bans. Labeled the
<a href="https://www.texasmonthly.com/news-politics/texas-republican-war-on-renewable-energy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“War
on Renewables”,</a> some of these policies were called “industry
killers” by renewable energy advocates. The majority of these bills were
introduced in the Texas Senate.
</p>
<p>
Senate Bill 7 and Senate Bill 1287 both proposed new fees for wind and
solar projects. Senate Bill 2012 would lead to charges on renewable
projects to help fund the building of gas plants, and Senate Bill 2015
would require half of all generation in Texas to come from non-renewable
sources. Perhaps the most damaging of bills would have led to a new
permitting process that only applied to renewable energy generation (SB
624). Most of these bills passed the Texas Senate but didn’t receive a
vote in the Texas House.
</p>
<p>
We analyzed the relationship between voting on these Senate bills and
renewable energy investments in legislators’ districts. Of the 31 Texas
Senate districts, seven have considerable wind investments and 12 have
solar projects built or proposed.
</p>
<p>
Interestingly, many of the urban Democratic districts have little or no
renewable energy projects. That’s probably because utility-scale wind
and solar requires not only wind and sun, but available land. This land
is often found in rural areas that are the strongholds of the Republican
Party.
</p>
<p>
First, we present the major renewable energy bills and the partisan
voting on this legislation. The pattern is clear. SB 258, one of the few
pro-renewable bills, received full support from Democratic senators.
Anti-renewable bills were introduced by Republican senators and they
received overwhelming support from their party. Conversely, few
Democrats supported these bills in what amounts to extremely partisan
voting.
</p>

<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="a02ac56561362dcc584db63f0c23e5f4" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="3b085" loading="lazy" src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTAyOTU3OS9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0MDM1NDI2OH0.LNyK6eAnP9Qz_ls655ga0ExKEUvIwKYwrAAf82NRpdc/image.png?width=980"/>
</p>
<p>
This partisan pattern is unsurprising on the surface, but economic
interests can also drive voting on renewable energy policy. How did
renewable energy investment shape voting on these bills?
</p>
<p>
The Advanced Power Association, arguably the most powerful renewable
energy association in Texas, provides a
<a href="https://txrenewables.net/" target="_blank">map</a> on their
website of renewable energy investments by Senate and House district in
Texas. This underlying data, complied by IdeaSmiths and shared with us
by Josh Rhodes, is the same data that can be accessed by legislators on
the impact of renewable energy in their districts. This data includes
solar, wind, and renewable energy story investments, proposed
investments, and estimated local tax revenues from these projects. For
simplicity we present total megawatts of proposed, under construction,
and built wind and solar projects, but we note the patterns we identify
are consistent with different codings of this data.
</p>
<p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="0d3ccbe453327becc02dc2789e7db67e" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="a7569" loading="lazy" src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTAyOTU1OC9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcyNTEzMzMwNH0.etyX7ab7Ag1B7QE4pmW2zEuKBALk_nXVNQ_9AqUIGHk/image.png?width=980"/>
</p>
<p>
The lack of correlation between renewable energy investment and voting
on renewable legislation is striking. Politicians voting against
renewable energy here actually had more wind and solar investment and
greater estimated tax revenues from renewables in their districts. In
fact, many of the <em>authors</em> of the anti-renewable bills have some
of the largest renewable investments in the state. Meanwhile, SB 258,
one of the few pro-renewable bills, received greater support from
districts with fewer renewable energy projects. Our interpretation is
simply that renewable energy investment has no impact on renewable
energy voting.<br/>
</p>
<p>
How can that be? We offer three possible explanations.
</p>
<p>
The first, and most unlikely, is that fossil fuel interests are driving
this war on renewables. While plausible, this explanation is forced to
confront the fact that
<a target="_blank"></a><a href="https://theconversation.com/who-benefits-from-renewable-energy-subsidies-in-texas-its-often-fossil-fuel-companies-that-are-fighting-clean-energy-elsewhere-187832" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the
majority of renewable energy projects in these areas are actually owned
by fossil fuel owners.</a> In a
<a href="https://event.on24.com/wcc/r/4266894/003BBCA6C84D07EB1748BE72AD150E1A" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">roundtable</a>
recapping this previous legislative session, renewable energy advocates,
including the Advanced Power Alliance, directly stated that they didn’t
think this legislation was driven by fossil fuel interests.
</p>
<p>
The second, which feels more likely, is that renewable energy generation
isn’t leading to the kinds of jobs or government revenue that can
insulate it from danger. Most of these projects have received
considerable tax abatements from cities, counties, and local school
districts, limiting their positive fiscal impact.
<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"></a><a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">They
also employ
</a><a href="https://graham.umich.edu/media/pubs/Wind-Turbine-Economic-Impact-Local-Employment-46932.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">relatively
few workers</a> once construction is complete. For example, the most
recent Texas application for school tax abatements is Skull Creek
Solar’s $147-million solar energy project. In their
<a href="https://assets.comptroller.texas.gov/ch313/1963/1963-cayuga-skull-app.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">application
for school tax abatements</a>, they propose the creation of one job. If
these projects are generating little tax revenue and few jobs, of course
skeptical politicians might be indifferent to their fates. In contrast,
other green investments, such as electric vehicle assembly and supply
chains, can create thousands of jobs.
</p>
<p>
The third, and most likely of all, is that renewable energy has simply
become another front in America’s ever-widening culture war. And the
partisan passage of the IRA may have exacerbated the divide.
</p>
<p>
Now, our data analysis examines one state and alternative dynamics might
be at play in other places. But given the depth of renewable energy
investment in Texas and the waves of anti-renewable legislation in
renewable energy districts, our analysis suggests limits to the
relationship between renewable energy investment and politics.
</p>
<p>
Hopes that green energy investments in Republican districts will lead to
changes in voting on renewable energy are inconsistent with our findings
in Texas.

<p>date: 2024-01-11, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog</p>
<p>The Republican-dominated U.S. House of Representatives was back in
session for business today. The day’s events did not bode well for the
House’s managing to accomplish more in 2024 than it did in 2023. Top on
the list of things that must get done, and done fast, is funding the
government. The continuing resolution currently in place to fund the
government expires in two phases: one on January 19 and the other on
February 2. The far-right Freedom Caucus Republicans have refused to
agree to funding measures without far deeper cuts than former House
speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) agreed to in a long-ago deal with
President Joe Biden as part of a package to raise the debt ceiling until
2025. They also want to attach far-right cultural demands to the
measures, although traditionally appropriations are kept clean.</p>

id="blinken-wraps-up-latest-middle-east-tour-says-gaza-conflict-has-to-end">Blinken
Wraps Up Latest Middle East Tour; Says Gaza Conflict Has to End</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>STATE DEPARTMENT — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on
Thursday Israel working with Arab neighbors in the Middle East region to
pave the way for a Palestinian state is the most effective way to
isolate Iran. </p>
<p>Before leaving Cairo, where he held talks with Egyptian President
Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, Blinken said, “There’s a path that brings
Israel’s needs and desires for integration in the region and genuine
security with, as well, Palestinian aspirations for a state of their
own.”</p>
<p>“That’s the single best way – this integration, security, a
Palestinian state – to isolate and marginalize Iran and the kinds of
actions it’s taking through its proxies,” Blinken said. “I think that
vision is clear but for us to move on it, for it to really get started,
the conflict in Gaza has to end. That’s critical.”</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has firmly rejected the
two-state solution.</p>
<p>Cairo was the 10th and final stop on Blinken’s seven-day diplomatic
mission, focused on containing the Gaza war, increasing humanitarian
assistance, ensuring the protection of civilians, and securing the
release of the remaining hostages held by Hamas militants.</p>
<p>Earlier on Thursday, Blinken expressed appreciation for Egypt’s
partnership in assisting the delivery of humanitarian assistance to
Palestinians in Gaza. </p>
<p>“Secretary Blinken and President El Sissi discussed ongoing efforts
to secure the release of all remaining hostages.  The secretary
reiterated U.S. commitment to ensuring Palestinians in Gaza are not
forcibly displaced and to achieving regional peace that ensures Israel’s
security and advances the establishment of a Palestinian state,”
according to the State Department.</p>
<p>Egypt played a key role in mediating an earlier temporary cease-fire
during which Hamas released more than 100 hostages and Israel released
240 Palestinian prisoners. Egypt is trying to revive hostage
negotiations between Israel and Hamas.</p>
<p>Retired General Kenneth “Frank” McKenzie, former commander of U.S.
Central Command, expressed pessimism during a webinar on Wednesday.</p>
<p>“I think it’s going to be very hard to get the remaining hostages
back. … They’re the last thing Hamas has,” he said. “I am not optimistic
that we’re going to get a lot of these hostages back.”</p>
<p>Thursday’s talks in Cairo come a day after Blinken met with
Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in the West Bank, and
Abbas held subsequent talks with Sissi and Jordan’s King Abdullah
II.</p>
<p>The Jordanian, Egyptian and Palestinian leaders issued a joint
statement calling for the international community to maintain pressure
for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza and for the protection of
Palestinian civilians. The leaders also highlighted the need for
displaced Palestinians to be able to return to their homes in Gaza, and
they rejected any attempt by Israel to reoccupy parts of the territory
after the war.</p>
<p>Netanyahu said during televised remarks late Wednesday that Israel
“has no intention of permanently occupying Gaza or displacing its
civilian population.”</p>
<p>“Israel is fighting Hamas terrorists, not the Palestinian population,
and we are doing so in full compliance with international law,” he
said.</p>
<p>Israel has agreed to allow a United Nations mission to evaluate the
situation in war-ravaged northern Gaza for the safe return of displaced
Palestinians.</p>
<p>Stephane Dujarric, spokesperson for U.N. Secretary-General Antonio
Guterres, said Wednesday that the mission is “contingent on security
guarantees” from Israel.</p>
<p>The U.N. hopes to carry it out as soon as possible, as it is critical
to a planned increase in humanitarian aid for northern Gaza.</p>
<p>Diplomats said Israel has invited U.N. Security Council members to
visit the country later this month.</p>
<p>A U.N. special envoy is also set to conduct a mission to Israel and
the West Bank at the end of January to gather information on sexual
violence against hostages, reportedly committed by Hamas militants
during the October 7 attacks in southern Israel, and the aftermath.</p>
<p>More than 85% of Palestinians have been displaced across the Gaza
Strip since October 7, according to the United Nations Relief and Works
Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East.</p>
<p>Red Sea attacks</p>
<p>Blinken on Wednesday warned of “consequences” after Yemen-based
Houthi rebels launched their largest yet aerial attack on the Red
Sea.</p>
<p>“We had the biggest attack — UAVs [unmanned aerial vehicles] missiles
— just yesterday,” Blinken told reporters at Bahrain International
Airport in Manama on Wednesday. “These attacks have been aided and
abetted by Iran with technology, equipment, intelligence, information,
and they are having a real-life impact on people.”</p>
<p>More than 20 countries, including Bahrain, have pledged to preserve
freedom of navigation and freedom of shipping in the Red Sea, Blinken
said after holding talks with Bahraini King Hamad bin Isa Al
Khalifa.</p>
<p>“If these attacks continue as they did yesterday, there will be
consequences,” Blinken added. He urged Iran to stop its assistance to
Houthis but declined to elaborate on what specific consequences there
would be.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the U.N. Security Council adopted a U.S.-drafted
resolution condemning and demanding an end to Houthi attacks on ships in
the Red Sea.</p>
<p>The Iran-backed Houthis said the attacks target ships affiliated with
or bound for Israel, and that they are acting in solidarity with the
Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>Gaza health officials say more than 23,400 Palestinians, a large
percentage of them women and children, have been killed in Israel’s
military offensive in the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>Israel began its military campaign to wipe out Hamas after Hamas
fighters crossed into southern Israel in October. Israel said about
1,200 people were killed and about 240 captives taken in the terror
attack.</p>
<p>Some material for this report came from Reuters, Agence France-Presse
and The Associated Press.</p>

<h2 id="green-is-the-new-republican-dirty-word">‘Green’ Is the New
Republican Dirty Word</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-11, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTA1NzA2MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2NDYyNTA3NX0.8ajU4l0fti4GUekmxT_jLDptKkLgyVN5MChDdz6culQ/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
Our condolences to “woke.” It appears that Republicans have a new
favorite boogeyman buzzword this election season: “green.” The word was
on every Republican presidential hopeful’s lips on Wednesday, both at
CNN’s debate in Iowa between Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and former UN
Ambassador Nikki Haley, and at former President Donald Trump’s competing
town hall on Fox News.
</p>
<p>
To start, DeSantis reiterated his promise to reverse President Biden’s
clean energy policy – without, of course, actually calling it by its
real name. After explaining that energy independence is “good to reduce
inflation,” DeSantis continued, “So we’ll do that on day one and we’re
going to reverse Biden’s Green New Deal and the electric vehicle
mandates.” DeSantis is of course facetiously referring to the Inflation
Reduction Act here — Biden has
<a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/21498236/joe-biden-green-new-deal-debate" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">not
supported</a> the actual Green New Deal as
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/nov/01/climate-green-new-deal-tour-ed-markey" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">proposed</a>
in a resolution by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator
Edward Markey in 2019.
</p>
<p>
It’s also not the first time DeSantis has made this particular
reference. The Florida governor,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/ron-desantis-environment-climate-change" target="_self">who
once said</a> that “humans contribute to what goes on around us” while
running for governor in Florida in 2018, promised that he’d be “taking
all the Biden regulations, the Green New Deal, ripping it up and
throwing it in the trash can where it belongs,” at November’s
<a href="https://twitter.com/RonDeSantis/status/1722436851322036597" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">primary
debate</a>. DeSantis’s environmental flip-flopping has not gone
unnoticed by his opponents – least of all Haley, who called out
DeSantis’s pledge to ban fracking during Wednesday’s debate, as she did
in
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/ron-desantis-fracking-florida-debate-nikki-haley" target="_self">September</a>
and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/nikki-haley-ron-desantis-fracking-environmentalist-gop-debate" target="_self">November</a>
as well.
</p>
<p>
Haley took her own stab at Biden’s energy policy shortly after DeSantis
at Wednesday’s debate. Biden’s “green subsidies” caught a stray during
Haley’s answer to a question about funding Ukraine and Israel during
their respective ongoing wars. “Supporting Ukraine is 3.5% of our
budget,” Haley said. “If we support Ukraine and Israel, that’s only 5%
of our defense budget […] If we support Ukraine, Israel, and secure the
border, that’s less than 20% of Biden’s green subsidies. You do not have
to choose when it comes to national security.”
</p>
<p>
For his part, Trump trotted out a predictably insane “green” reference
during his live town hall on Fox News. While answering a question about
contributing to the national debt during his term, Trump said, “You had
to inject money. … If I didn’t do that, you would have had a depression
in this country.” He continued, “That was a very good investment. And
now what they should be doing instead of the kind of debt that they’re
building at record levels, they should be paying down their debt and
they ought to go into the energy business instead of this green new scam
business that they’re in.”
</p>
<p>
It’s perhaps redundant to note that at no point during the fifth
Republican presidential debate or Trump’s town hall was the Inflation
Reduction Act mentioned by name. We’ll have to tune into the next debate
(January 18 in New Hampshire) to find out if the green verbal tic holds
up.

<h2 id="house-republicans-aim-to-impeach-us-homeland-secretary">House
Republicans Aim to Impeach US Homeland Secretary</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — House Republicans held their first impeachment hearing
Wednesday against Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro
Mayorkas over his handling of what they called the crisis at the
U.S.-Mexico border.</p>
<p>In a 20-minute opening statement, Mark Green, the Republican chairman
of the House Homeland Security Committee, shared what he said was
evidence that supports impeaching a Cabinet secretary.</p>
<p>“Secretary Mayorkas has brazenly refused to enforce the laws passed
by Congress that knowingly made our country less safe,” he said.</p>
<p>Republicans blame Mayorkas for the high numbers of migrants at the
U.S.-Mexico border and said the Republican Party has undertaken a
yearlong investigation into the secretary’s work.</p>
<p>During the hearing, Green said Mayorkas’ failure to adhere to the law
provides ample justification for initiating impeachment proceedings. The
lawmaker said the framers of the constitution did not envision
impeachment solely for criminal acts but also for individuals displaying
significant incompetence, jeopardizing fellow Americans, breaching
public trust, or neglecting their duties.</p>
<p>“What we are seeing here is a willful violation of his oath of office
by Secretary Mayorkas,” Green said.</p>
<p>Democrats dismissed the impeachment efforts.</p>
<p>Representative Bennie Thompson, the top Democrat on the committee,
said Republicans want to “throw political red meat to their base,”
adding that Republicans have “absolutely no basis” to impeach
Mayorkas.</p>
<p>“You cannot impeach a Cabinet secretary because you don’t like a
president’s policies — that’s not what impeachment is for,” he said.</p>
<p>US-Mexico border</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mayorkas has carried on with his duties. On Monday, he
visited the border at Eagle Pass, Texas, to see Southwest border
enforcement efforts.</p>
<p>His visit came after federal border officials reported a record
11,000 apprehensions a day at the southern border in December alone.
These encounters dropped sharply with the beginning of the new year.</p>
<p>“It coincided with the time when Mexican enforcement was no longer
implemented. The immigration enforcement agency in Mexico was not
funded, which prompted President [Joe] Biden to reconnect with [Mexican]
President [Andres Manual Lopez] Obrador …” Mayorkas told reporters.</p>
<p>The high numbers of migrants encountered at the southern border is
one of the Republicans’ arguments to impeach the DHS secretary.</p>
<p>In year 2023, about 2.5 million migrants were encountered by border
patrol officers. Out of those, 564,380 were expelled under Title 42, a
public health code that expired on May 11, 2023. It was used during the
pandemic and allowed U.S. immigration officials to quickly expel
migrants to their country of origin or Mexican border towns and denied
them a chance at asylum.</p>
<p>But it did not ban them from trying again, and migrants were counted
multiple times under Title 42.</p>
<p>According to DHS, the department repatriated about 469,000 migrants
in fiscal 2023, while about 909,450 more were processed by border patrol
officials and received a document to present themselves at an
Immigration Customs Enforcement office. Some of those were paroled into
the U.S. and allowed to stay temporarily or paroled into the alternative
to detention program. And 311,343 more migrants were transferred to an
ICE detention facility.</p>
<p>Since the end of Title 42, everyone is again processed under Title 8,
the federal code of laws dealing with immigration. Those arriving at the
border without documents or trying to enter between ports of entry can
be removed without their case being decided by an immigration court
through a process known as expedited removal, and they are banned from
entering the U.S. for at least five years.</p>
<p>While in Texas, Mayorkas said that migrants encountered at the border
who do not have a legal basis to stay in the U.S. will be removed.</p>
<p>Next steps</p>
<p>Impeaching the Homeland Security secretary would be a rare
occurrence. In U.S. history, only one Cabinet official, Secretary of War
William Belknap in 1876, has been impeached.</p>
<p>The committee is expected to host more hearings as part of the
impeachment proceedings against Mayorkas. Once concluded, the panel is
expected to conduct a markup on articles of impeachment that will
culminate in a committee vote, setting the stage for the articles to be
subsequently forwarded to the full House for consideration.</p>
<p>Mayorkas, however, is not expected to be removed by the Senate.</p>

<p>Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday

to be the ideal American family with a small fridge</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-11, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
I’m coming to the realization when you’re a family with a small fridge
you cannot be all these platonic ideals at the same time:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The buy in bulk Costco family
</li>
<li>
The big weekly shopping trip family
</li>
<li>
The cook/order extra and eat leftovers family
</li>
<li>
The cook extra and freeze it family
</li>
<li>
The meal prep family
</li>
<li>
The freezer full of frozen smoothie ingredients family
</li>
<li>
The buy one-off condiments, sauces, or pickles family
</li>
<li>
The keep fresh fruits and veggies on hand family
</li>
<li>
The make my kids lunches family
</li>
</ul>
<p>
At best you can be one of these or buy a garage fridge. People with two
fridges seem content. Some industrious folks keep a whole deer or half a
cow in there. I’m not going that overboard, I need a home for a bag of
chicken nuggies, tamales from Arizona, and some ice cream.
</p>
<p>
Interesting predicament, small fridges. Instagram Reel-esque lifehacks
could save my family some real money, reduce waste, and make food
choices more healthy or interesting. I don’t want an extra fridge
humming in the garage getting slimy, but I also don’t want to go to the
store every other day. Good grief, Charlie Brown.

<h2 id="trump-critic-christie-says-hes-ending-presidential-bid">Trump
Critic Christie Says He’s Ending Presidential Bid</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WINDHAM, New Hampshire — Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie
said Wednesday that he was ending his Republican presidential bid just
days before Iowa’s leadoff caucuses. </p>
<p>“My goal has never been to be just a voice against the hate and
division and the selfishness of what our party has become under Donald
Trump,” Christie said at a town hall meeting in New Hampshire. </p>
<p>“I’ve always said that if there came a point in time in this race
where I couldn’t see a path to accomplishing that goal, that I would get
out,” he said. “And it’s clear to me tonight that there isn’t a path for
me to win the nomination, which is why I’m suspending my campaign
tonight for president of the United States.” </p>
<p>It wasn’t clear whether Christie would be immediately endorsing one
of his rivals, but he was overheard criticizing former U.N. Ambassador
Nikki Haley on a livestream set up by his campaign ahead of the
event. </p>
<p>“She’s going to get smoked,” he said. “She’s not up to this.”  </p>
<p>He said Florida Governor Ron DeSantis called him, petrified he would
endorse Haley, but the hot mic was cut before Christie finished
speaking. </p>
<p>Counting on New Hampshire</p>
<p>The dropout came as a surprise, given that Christie had staked the
success of his campaign on New Hampshire’s first-in-the-nation primary,
which is less than two weeks away. He had insisted as recently as
Tuesday night that he had no plans to leave the race, continuing to cast
himself as the only candidate willing to directly take on the former
president. </p>
<p>“I would be happy to get out of the way for someone who is actually
running against Donald Trump,” he said at a town hall session in
Rochester, New Hampshire, while arguing that none of his rivals had
taken on the former president.</p>
<p>But Christie faced a stark reality: While recent polls showed him
reaching the double digits in New Hampshire, Haley shows signs of
momentum. A CNN/University of New Hampshire poll conducted in the state
this week found Trump’s lead down to the single digits, with four in 10
likely Republican primary voters choosing Trump and about one-third
choosing Haley. </p>
<p>Allies of Haley, including New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu and
other anti-Trump Republicans, had been urging Christie to exit, hoping a
large portion of his supporters would flock to Haley, giving her a
chance to turn the race into a two-candidate contest with Trump, the
overwhelming favorite for the nomination. </p>
<p>The New Hampshire poll — which showed Christie at 12% — found about
two-thirds of his supporters would select Haley as their second
choice. </p>
<p>Christie had run as the race’s fiercest critic of the former
president. He warned voters against nominating a candidate who has been
criminally indicted four times and could very well be a convicted felon
by the November general election. And he argued Trump would lose in a
rematch with President Joe Biden, the likely Democratic nominee. </p>
<p>While his anti-Trump message attracted much media attention and
helped bring in waves of small-dollar donations that kept him in the
race — and on the debate stage — far longer than many expected, Christie
was plagued by high unfavorability ratings in a party that remains
deeply loyal to Trump. </p>
<p>He also remained mired in the single digits in national polling. </p>
<p>Frugal campaign</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Christie managed to outlast far better-known and
better-funded candidates, including former Vice President Mike Pence and
Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, in part because he ran a frugal
campaign. Instead of flying by private jet and hiring a litany of
expensive consultants, he relied on a tight-knit staff of just over a
dozen people and spent far lower per day than rivals like DeSantis. </p>
<p>And just as he did when he ran in 2016, Christie banked his campaign
on New Hampshire, believing his brash “tell it like it is” style would
resonate with the state’s more independent-leaning voters, including
those who are unaffiliated with a party and can vote in the Republican
primary. </p>
<p>He also campaigned in South Carolina and hoped to emerge as the last
man standing against Trump after the early state contests. </p>
<p>Christie had long insisted that he had no plans to leave the race
before New Hampshire’s primary on January 23 and appeared on track to
perform better than he had in 2016, when he finished in sixth place with
just 7% of the vote. </p>
<p>At the town hall Tuesday, he delivered a sharply worded rebuttal to
those calling on him to drop out to clear the path for Haley, arguing
that she wasn’t even trying to beat the front-runner. </p>
<p>“I have no interest in being a spoiler for someone who wants to beat
Donald Trump,” he said. “But if you’d be willing to be his vice
president? If you’d pardon him if you became president? If you’d vote
for him even if he’s a convicted felon … I mean, geez, really?” </p>
<p>Christie asked the crowd to imagine what would happen if he dropped
out to support Haley and then she agreed to serve as Trump’s running
mate. </p>
<p>“What will I look like? What will all the people who supported her at
my behest look like?” he asked. “You know, I made that mistake once
eight years ago. I made an endorsement decision based on politics eight
years ago when I supported Trump. I’m not going to make the same mistake
again. Can’t do it.” </p>
<p>Once a Trump asset</p>
<p>The campaign in many ways felt like a mission of redemption for the
former governor, who arguably did more than any other Republican to help
Trump win the presidency when they faced each other in 2016. </p>
<p>During that contest, Christie delivered a fatal blow to rival
candidate Marco Rubio during a debate that came just as the Republican
establishment appeared to be coalescing around the senator from Florida
as a Trump alternative. No other candidate ever emerged in his
place. </p>
<p>Then, after Christie dropped out, he became the first major
Republican figure to endorse Trump during a surprise press conference.
He went on to lead Trump’s White House transition operation — before he
was unceremoniously fired — and to serve as an on-again-off-again
adviser, including preparing Trump for the debates against Biden. </p>
<p>It was during one of their 2020 debate prep sessions that Christie
believes Trump gave him COVID-19, putting Christie in the hospital in
intensive care. </p>
<p>But it wasn’t until the night of the 2020 election that Christie, who
had been friends with Trump and his wife for 20 years, broke with the
then-president after Trump falsely claimed victory long before all the
votes had been counted. Christie later penned a book that was deeply
critical of the former president. </p>
<p>Beyond his focus on Trump, Christie had argued that abortion
restrictions should be left to the states until there is broader
consensus on the issue, and he had advocated for continued U.S. support
for Ukraine in its efforts to stave off Russia’s invasion. He visited
both Ukraine and Israel, where he toured a kibbutz that was ravaged in
the October 7 rampage by Hamas militants and said the U.S. must stand
“shoulder to shoulder” with Israel.</p>

effect and mechanism of Fushen Granule on gut microbiome in the
prevention and treatment of chronic renal failure</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-11, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Background
</title>
<p>
Fushen Granule is an improved granule based on the classic formula
Fushen Formula, which is used for the treatment of peritoneal
dialysis-related intestinal dysfunction in patients with end-stage renal
disease. However, the effect and mechanism of this granule on the
prevention and treatment of chronic renal failure have not been fully
elucidated.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
A 5/6 nephrectomy model of CRF was induced and Fushen Granule was
administered at low and high doses to observe its effects on renal
function, D-lactate, serum endotoxin, and intestinal-derived metabolic
toxins. The 16SrRNA sequencing method was used to analyze the abundance
and structure of the intestinal flora of CRF rats. A FMT assay was also
used to evaluate the effects of transplantation of Fushen Granule fecal
bacteria on renal-related functional parameters and metabolic toxins in
CRF rats.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
Gavage administration of Fushen Granule at low and high doses
down-regulated creatinine, urea nitrogen, 24-h urine microalbumin,
D-lactate, endotoxin, and the intestinal-derived toxins indophenol
sulphateand p-cresol sulphate in CRF rats. Compared with the
sham-operated group in the same period, CRF rats had a decreased
abundance of the firmicutes phylum and an increased abundance of the
bacteroidetes phylum at the phylum level, and a decreasing trend of the
lactobacillus genus at the genus level. Fushen Granule intervention
increased the abundance of the firmicutes phylum, decreased the
abundance of the bacteroidetes phylum, and increased the abundance of
the lactobacillus genus. The transplantation of Fushen Granule fecal
bacteria significantly reduced creatinine(Cr), blood urea nitrogen(Bun),
uric acid(UA), 24-h urinary microalbumin, D-lactate, serum endotoxin,
and enterogenic metabolic toxins in CRF rats. Compared with the
sham-operated group, the transplantation of Fushen Granule fecal
bacteria modulated the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phyla and the
Lactobacillus genus.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
Fushen Granule improved renal function and intestinal barrier function
by regulating intestinal flora, inhibiting renal fibrosis, and delaying
the progression of chronic renal failure.

previous antimicrobial therapy reduce the positivity rate of metagenomic
next-generation sequencing in periprosthetic joint infections? A
clinical study</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-11, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Background
</title>
<p>
Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) is a culture-independent
massively parallel DNA sequencing technology and it has been widely used
for rapid etiological diagnosis with significantly high positivity rate.
Currently, clinical studies on evaluating the influence of previous
antimicrobial therapy on positivity rate of mNGS in PJIs are rarely
reported. The present study aimed to investigate whether the positivity
rate of mNGS is susceptible to previous antimicrobial therapy.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
We performed a prospective trial among patients who undergone hip or
knee surgery due to periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) to compare the
positivity rate of culture and mNGS between cases with and without
previous antimicrobial therapy, and the positivity rates between cases
with different antimicrobial-free intervals were also analysed.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
Among 131 included PJIs, 91 (69.5%) had positive cultures and 115
(87.8%) had positive mNGS results. There was no significant difference
in the positivity rate of deep-tissue culture and synovial fluid mNGS
between cases with and without previous antimicrobial therapy. The
positivity rate of synovial fluid culture was higher in cases with
previous antimicrobial therapy. The positivity rates of mNGS in synovial
fluid decreased as the antimicrobial-free interval ranged from 4 to 14
days to 0 to 3 days.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
mNGS is more advantageous than culture with a higher pathogen detection
rate. However, our data suggested that antimicrobial agents may need to
be discontinued more than 3 days before sampling to further increase the
positivity rate of mNGS for PJIs.

of Klebsiella pneumoniae carrying the blaNDM-1 gene in IncX3 plasmids
and the rare In1765 in an IncFIB-IncHI1B plasmid</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-11, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Background
</title>
<p>
Today, the <italic>bla</italic><sub>NDM</sub> gene is widely distributed
on several plasmids from a variety of Gram-negative bacteria, primarily
in transposons and gene cassettes within their multidrug-resistant (MDR)
regions. This has led to the global dissemination of the
<italic>bla</italic><sub>NDM</sub> gene.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
The determination of class A beta-lactamase, class B and D
carbapenemases was performed according to the recommendations of the
Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). Antimicrobial
susceptibility testing was performed using both the BioMerieux VITEK2
system and antibiotic paper diffusion methods. Plasmid transfer was then
evaluated by conjugation experiments and plasmid electroporation assays.
To comprehensively analyze the complete genome of <italic>K.
pneumoniae</italic> strain F11 and to investigate the presence of mobile
genetic elements associated with antibiotic resistance and virulence
genes, Nanopore and Illumina sequencing platforms were used, and
bioinformatics methods were applied to analyze the obtained data.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
Our findings revealed that <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> strain F11
carried class A beta-lactamase and classes B+D carbapenemases, and
exhibited resistance to commonly used antibiotics, particularly
tigecycline and ceftazidime/avibactam, due to the presence of relevant
resistance genes. Plasmid transfer assays demonstrated successful
recovery of plasmids pA_F11 and pB_F11, with average conjugation
frequencies of 2.91×10<sup>-4</sup> and 1.56×10<sup>-4</sup>,
respectively. However, plasmids pC_F11 and pD_F11 failed in both
conjugation and electroporation experiments. The MDR region of plasmid
pA_F11 contained rare In1765, Tn<italic>As2</italic>, and
Tn<italic>As3</italic> elements. The MDR2 region of plasmid pB_F11
functioned as a mobile genetic “island” and lacked the
<italic>bla</italic><sub>NDM-1</sub> gene, serving as a “bridge”
connecting the early composite structure of
<italic>ble</italic><sub>MBL</sub> and
<italic>bla</italic><sub>NDM-1</sub> to the recent composite structure.
Additionally, the MDR1 region of plasmid pB_F11 comprised In27,
Tn<italic>As1</italic>, Tn<italic>As3</italic>, and
Tn<italic>2</italic>; and plasmid pC_F11 harbored the recent composite
structure of <italic>ble</italic><sub>MBL</sub> and
<italic>bla</italic><sub>NDM-1</sub> within Tn<italic>3000</italic>
which partially contained partial Tn<italic>125</italic>.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
This study demonstrated that complex combinations of transposons and
integron overlaps, along with the synergistic effects of different drug
resistance and virulence genes, led to a lack of effective therapeutic
agents for strain F11, therefore its dissemination and prevalence should
be strictly controlled.

profiling specifies the pathogen-specific human host response to
infectious keratitis</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-11, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Purpose
</title>
<p>
Corneal infections are a leading cause of visual impairment and
blindness worldwide. Here we applied high-resolution transcriptomic
profiling to assess the general and pathogen-specific molecular and
cellular mechanisms during human corneal infection.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
Clinical diagnoses of herpes simplex virus (HSV) (n=5) and
bacterial/fungal (n=5) keratitis were confirmed by histology. Healthy
corneas (n=7) and keratoconus (n=4) samples served as controls.
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) human corneal specimens were
analyzed using the 3’ RNA sequencing method Massive Analysis of cDNA
Ends (MACE RNA-seq). The cellular host response was investigated using
comprehensive bioinformatic deconvolution (xCell and CYBERSORTx)
analyses and by integration with published single cell RNA-seq data of
the human cornea.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
Our analysis identified 216 and 561 genes, that were specifically
overexpressed in viral or bacterial/fungal keratitis, respectively, and
allowed to distinguish the two etiologies. The virus-specific host
response was driven by adaptive immunity and associated molecular
signaling pathways, whereas the bacterial/fungal-specific host response
mainly involved innate immunity signaling pathways and cell types. We
identified several genes and pathways involved in the host response to
infectious keratitis, including CXCL9, CXCR3, and MMP9 for viral, and
S100A8/A9, MMP9, and the IL17 pathway for bacterial/fungal keratitis.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusions
</title>
<p>
High-resolution molecular profiling provides new insights into the human
corneal host response to viral and bacterial/fungal infection.
Pathogen-specific molecular profiles may provide the foundation for
novel diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic approaches that target
inflammation-induced damage to corneal host cells with the goal to
improve the outcome of infectious keratitis.

<sec>
<title>
Introduction
</title>
<p>
<italic>Culicoides</italic> plays a crucial role as an insect vector in
the field of veterinary medicine. The transmission of significant
viruses such as bluetongue virus (BTV) and African horse sickness virus
(AHSV) by this insect poses a substantial threat, leading to the
development of severe diseases in domestic animals. This study aimed to
explore the <italic>Culicoides</italic> species, identify their
blood-meal sources, and assess the presence of BTV and AHSV carried by
<italic>Culicoides</italic> in Yuanyang County, Yunnan Province. The aim
was to gain insights into the potential vectors of these two viruses and
elucidate their potential roles in the transmission of pathogens.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
The midges were collected from cattle (<italic>Bos indicus</italic>),
pig (<italic>Sus scrofa</italic>), and goat (<italic>Capra
hircus</italic>) pens in Yuanyang County, Yunnan Province in June 2020.
Initial identification of midges was conducted through morphological
characteristics, followed by molecular identification using the
cytochrome C oxidase subunit I (COI) gene. The determination of
<italic>Culicoides</italic> blood-meal sources was accomplished using
specific primers targeting the cytochrome <italic>b</italic> (Cyt
<italic>b</italic>) gene from potential hosts. BTV and AHSV RNA were
identified in <italic>Culicoides</italic> pools through the application
of reverse transcriptase PCR and quantitative real-time PCR. Nucleotide
homology and phylogenetic analysis were performed using MegAlign
(DNAStar) and Mega 6.0 software.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
A total of 6,300 <italic>Culicoides</italic>, consisting of <italic>C.
oxystoma, C. arakawai, C. imicola</italic>, and <italic>C.
innoxius</italic>, were collected from cattle, pigs, and goat pens. The
engorgement rates for these species were 30.2%, 54.6%, 75%, and 66.7%,
respectively. In the cattle pen, the prevailing species is <italic>C.
oxystoma</italic> (100%). In the pig pen, <italic>C. arakawai </italic>
dominates (70%), with <italic>C. oxystoma</italic> following at 30%. In
the goat pen, <italic>C. imicola</italic> holds the majority (45.45%),
trailed by <italic>C. oxystoma</italic> (25%), <italic>C.
innoxius</italic> (20.45%), and <italic>C. arakawai</italic> (9.09%).
These <italic>Culicoides</italic> species were identified as feeding on
cattle, pigs, goats, chickens (<italic>Gallus gallus</italic>), and
humans (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>). The positivity rates for BTV
were 20.00% and 11.54% in blood-fed specimens of <italic>C.
imicola</italic> and <italic>C. oxystoma</italic>, respectively.
Conversely, the positivity rates for BTV in non-blood-fed specimens were
0.00% and 6.67% for <italic>C. imicola</italic> and <italic>C.
oxystoma</italic>, respectively. BTV was not detected in <italic>C.
arakawai</italic> and <italic>C. innoxius</italic>. The specimens (YY86)
from <italic>C. imicola</italic> that tested positive for BTV had the
closest genetic relationship to YTS-4 isolated from Mangshi, Yunnan
Province in 1996. All test results for the nucleic acid of AHSV were
negative.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
The study reveals variations in the species distribution, community
composition, blood sucking rate, and blood-feeding sources of
<italic>Culicoides</italic> across different habitats. Notably,
<italic>C. imicola</italic> and <italic>C. oxystoma</italic> emerge as
potential vectors for the transmission of BTV in local animals.
Accordingly, this investigation provides crucial insights that can serve
as a valuable reference for the prevention and control of BTV in local
animals, particularly from the perspective of vector management.

retroviruses Suppressyn and Syncytin-2 as innovative prognostic
biomarkers in Acute Myeloid Leukemia</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-11, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Introduction
</title>
<p>
Emerging evidence has proven that human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs)
play a critical role in the pathogenesis of Acute Myeloid Leukemia
(AML), whereas the specific HERVs influencing the prognosis of AML
patients have yet to be fully understood.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
In this study, a systematic exploration was achieved to identify
potential prognostic HERVs for AML, sourced from TCGA and GTEx database.
Differential analysis and functional enrichment studies were conducted
using GO, KEGG, GSEA, and GSVA. The ESTIMATE algorithm was applied to
explore the immune infiltration of HERVs in AML. A prognostic risk-score
model was evaluated with predicted yearly accuracy using ROC analysis.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
Two HERVs Suppressyn and Syncytin-2, were identified as promising
prognostic biomarkers, with high discrimination ability based on ROC
analysis between AML and healthy cohorts from TCGA. Their expression was
notably higher in AML patients compared to those in healthy individuals
but correlates with favorable clinical outcomes in sub-groups such as
white race, lower WBC counts, favorable and intermediate risks, and NPM1
or IDH1 mutation. Suppressyn and Syncytin-2 participated in
immune-related pathways and exhibited correlations with multiple immune
infiltration cells, such as T cells, mast cells, and tumor-associated
macrophages. Finally, we developed a prognostic risk-scoring model
combining Suppressyn and Syncytin-2, where a high risk-score is
associated with better prognosis.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Discussion
</title>
<p>
Collectively, our findings revealed that Suppressyn and Syncytin-2 may
act as valuable diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for individuals
with AML, while highlighting links between HERV activation,
immunogenicity, and future therapeutic targets.

guide to Stenotrophomonas maltophilia virulence capabilities, as we
currently understand them</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-11, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
The Gram-negative pathogen <italic>Stenotrophomonas maltophilia</italic>
causes a wide range of human infections. It causes particularly serious
lung infections in individuals with cystic fibrosis, leading to high
mortality rates. This pathogen is resistant to most known antibiotics
and harbors a plethora of virulence factors, including lytic enzymes and
serine proteases, that cause acute infection in host organisms.
<italic>S. maltophilia</italic> also establishes chronic infections
through biofilm formation. The biofilm environment protects the bacteria
from external threats and harsh conditions and is therefore vital for
the long-term pathogenesis of the microbe. While studies have identified
several genes that mediate <italic>S. maltophilia’s</italic> initial
colonization and biofilm formation, the cascade of events initiated by
these factors is poorly understood. Consequently, understanding these
and other virulence factors can yield exciting new targets for novel
therapeutics.

damage response coregulator ddrR affects many cellular pathways and
processes in Acinetobacter baumannii 17978</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-11, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Introduction
</title>
<p>
<italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> strain 17978 is an
opportunistic pathogen possessing a DNA damage response (DDR) in which
multiple error-prone polymerase genes are co-repressed by a UmuD
homolog, UmuDAb, and the small <italic>Acinetobacter</italic>-specific
protein DdrR. Additionally, these regulators coactivate nine other
genes. We identified the DNA damage-inducible transcriptome for
wildtype, <italic>umuDAb</italic>, and <italic>recA</italic> strains,
and later established the <italic>ddrR</italic> DDR transcriptome.
However, the ATCC 17978 reference genome had several assembly errors and
lacked the 44 kb virulence locus, AbaAL44, that is present in the strain
17978 UN.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
For this project, we combined our earlier single-end read RNAseq data
with the <italic>ddrR</italic> paired-end reads and aligned these data
to the improved 17978 UN genome assembly that resembled our laboratory
strain, 17978 JH.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
New DESeq2 analyses verified previous differentially expressed genes
(DEGs) but also found 339 genes in 17978 JH that were not annotated or
physically present in the older genome assembly. Sixty-three were
differentially expressed after DNA damage, and 182 had differential
basal expression when comparing <italic>umuDAb</italic>,
<italic>ddrR</italic>, or <italic>recA</italic> strains to wildtype,
with 94 genes’ expression unchanged. This work identified and
characterized the 55 gene DNA damage-repressible transcriptome, 98% of
which required either <italic>umuDAb</italic> or <italic>ddrR</italic>
for repression. Two-thirds of these DEGs required both regulators. We
also identified 110 genes repressed only in the <italic>ddrR</italic>
strain, ~50% of which were due to increased basal expression levels.
Basal gene expression in the <italic>ddrR</italic> mutant was further
dysregulated independent of the DDR. Over 800 genes were upregulated,
and over 1200 genes were downregulated compared to wildtype expression.
Half of <italic>A. baumannii’s</italic> essential genes were upregulated
in the <italic>ddrR</italic> strain, including cell division genes, and
two-thirds of these were downregulated in the <italic>umuDAb</italic>
strain.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Discussion
</title>
<p>
The <italic>ddrR</italic> mutant upregulated genes enriched in
translation, RNA metabolism, protein metabolism, AA/FA/cell-structure
synthesis, and transport, while downregulating genes enriched in quorum
sensing, biofilm production, secretion systems, pilus production, cell
adhesion, and aromatics and chlorine degradation. Our data underscore
the need for accurate and appropriately matched genome assemblies and
indicate that <italic>ddrR</italic> affects approximately 60% of the
genome, rendering it a potential target for <italic>Acinetobacter
baumannii</italic> infection treatment.

microbiome in individuals with an impaired immune system</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-11, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
With the advent of next generation sequencing, it is now appreciated
that human urine is not sterile. Recent investigations of the urinary
microbiome (urobiome) have provided insights into several urological
diseases. Urobiome dysbiosis, defined as non-optimal urine microbiome
composition, has been observed in many disorders; however, it is not
clear whether this dysbiosis is the cause of urinary tract disorders or
a consequence. In addition, immunologically altered disorders are
associated with higher rates of urinary tract infections. These
disorders include immunoproliferative and immunodeficiency diseases,
cancer, and immunosuppressant therapy in transplant recipients. In this
review, we examine the current state of knowledge of the urobiome in
immunologically altered diseases, its composition and metabolomic
consequences. We conclude that more data are required to describe the
urobiome in immune altered states, knowledge that could facilitate
understanding the role of the urobiome and its pathophysiological
effects on urinary tract infections and other disorders of the urinary
tract.

<p>
<italic>Streptomyces</italic>, the largest genus in the

presented with progressive chest tightness and dyspnea.
<italic>Streptomyces albireticuli</italic> was isolated from his
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and identified through whole-genome

trafficking regulator restricts intracellular growth of Coxiella
burnetii by inhibiting the expansion of Coxiella-containing vacuole and
upregulating nos2 expression</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-11, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
<italic>Coxiella burnetii</italic> is an obligate intracellular
bacterium that causes Q fever, a zoonotic disease typically manifests as
a severe flu-illness. After invading into the host cells, <italic>C.
burnetii</italic> delivers effectors to regulate the vesicle trafficking
and fusion events to form a large and mature
<italic>Coxiella</italic>-containing vacuole (CCV), providing sufficient
space and nutrition for its intracellular growth and proliferation.
Lysosomal trafficking regulator (LYST) is a member of the Beige and
Chediak-Higashi syndrome (BEACH) family, which regulates the transport
of vesicles to lysosomes and regulates TLR signaling pathway, but the
effect of LYST on <italic>C. burnetii</italic> infection is unclear. In
this study, a series of experiments has been conducted to investigate
the influence of LYST on intracellular growth of <italic>C.
burnetii</italic>. Our results showed that <italic>lyst</italic>
transcription was up-regulated in the host cells after <italic>C.
burnetii</italic> infection, but there is no significant change in
<italic>lyst</italic> expression level after infection with the Dot/Icm
type IV secretion system (T4SS) mutant strain, while CCVs expansion and
significantly increasing load of <italic>C. burnetii</italic> appeared
in the host cells with a silenced <italic>lyst</italic> gene, suggesting
LYST inhibits the intracellular proliferation of <italic>C.
burnetii</italic> by reducing CCVs size. Then, the size of CCVs and the
load of <italic>C. burnetii</italic> in the HeLa cells pretreated with
E-64d were significantly decreased. In addition, the level of iNOS was
decreased significantly in LYST knockout THP-1 cells, which was
conducive to the intracellular replication of <italic>C.
burnetii</italic>. This data is consistent with the phenotype of
L-NMMA-treated THP-1 cells infected with <italic>C. burnetii</italic>.
Our results revealed that the upregulation of <italic>lyst</italic>
transcription after infection is due to effector secretion of <italic>C.
burnetii</italic> and LYST inhibit the intracellular replication of
<italic>C. burnetii</italic> by reducing the size of CCVs and inducing
<italic>nos2</italic> expression.

evidence on the causality between gut microbiota and various asthma
phenotypes: a two-sample Mendelian randomization study</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-11, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Introduction
</title>
<p>
Asthma is a multifarious disease that manifests in various phenotypes.
Among the various factors that contribute to the development of asthma,
the gut microbiota has recently emerged as a compelling area of
investigation. This study aims to investigate the causal relationships
between gut microbiota and distinct asthma phenotypes.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
The genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics for 211 gut
microbial taxa were used as study exposure. Five traits pertaining to
various asthma phenotypes (asthma, allergic asthma, childhood asthma,
suggestive for eosinophilic asthma and obesity-related asthma) were
included as study outcome. We conducted Mendelian randomization (MR)
analysis and sensitivity analysis for each bacterial taxa and asthma
phenotypes.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Result
</title>
<p>
We discovered a total of 58 associations that exhibited evidence of
causality. Out of these, 4 associations remained significant even after
applying multiple correction. An increased risk of asthma was causally
associated with higher abundance of genus <italic>Holdemanella</italic>
(OR = 1.11; CI: 1.05-1.17; p = 0.027), genus
<italic>Oxalobacter</italic> (OR = 1.09; CI: 1.04-1.15; p = 0.025) and
genus <italic>Butyricimonas</italic> (OR = 1.14; CI: 1.06-1.22; p =
0.027). Order <italic>NB1n</italic> was causally linked with an
increased risk of obesity-related asthma (OR = 1.17; CI: 1.07-1.29; p =
0.015). There was limited overlap among the taxa that exhibited
potential causal relationships with distinct asthma phenotypes.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
Our research has provided genetic evidence that establishes multiple
causal relationships between the gut microbiota and distinct asthma
phenotypes, supporting the role of the gut microbiota in various asthma
phenotypes. It is possible that different taxa play a role in the
development of distinct asthma phenotypes. The causal relationships
identified in this study require further investigation.

microbiome-based noninvasive diagnostic model to predict acute coronary
syndromes</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-11, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Background
</title>
<p>
Previous studies have shown that alterations in the gut microbiota are
closely associated with Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) development.
However, the value of gut microbiota for early diagnosis of ACS remains
understudied.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
We recruited 66 volunteers, including 29 patients with a first diagnosis
of ACS and 37 healthy volunteers during the same period, collected their
fecal samples, and sequenced the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene.
Functional prediction of the microbiota was performed using PICRUSt2.
Subsequently, we constructed a nomogram and corresponding webpage based
on microbial markers to assist in the diagnosis of ACS. The diagnostic
performance and usefulness of the model were analyzed using boostrap
internal validation, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis
(DCA).
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
Compared to that of healthy controls, the diversity and composition of
microbial community of patients with ACS was markedly abnormal.
Potentially pathogenic genera such as <italic>Streptococcus</italic> and
<italic>Acinetobacter</italic> were significantly increased in the ACS
group, whereas certain SCFA-producing genera such as
<italic>Blautia</italic> and <italic>Agathobacter</italic> were
depleted. In addition, in the correlation analysis with clinical
indicators, the microbiota was observed to be associated with the level
of inflammation and severity of coronary atherosclerosis. Finally, a
diagnostic model for ACS based on gut microbiota and clinical variables
was developed with an area under the receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.963 (95% CI: 0.925–1) and an AUC value of 0.948
(95% CI: 0.549–0.641) for bootstrap internal validation. The calibration
curves of the model show good consistency between the actual and
predicted probabilities. The DCA showed that the model had a high net
clinical benefit for clinical applications.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
Our study is the first to characterize the composition and function of
the gut microbiota in patients with ACS and healthy populations in
Southwest China and demonstrates the potential effect of the microbiota
as a non-invasive marker for the early diagnosis of ACS.

novel enemy of cancer: recent investigations into protozoan anti-tumor
properties</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-11, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
Cancer remains a significant global health issue, despite advances in
screening and treatment. While existing tumor treatment protocols such
as surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy, and
immunotherapy have proven effective in enhancing the prognosis for some
patients, these treatments do not benefit all patients. Consequently,
certain types of cancer continue to exhibit a relatively low 5-year
survival rate. Therefore, the pursuit of novel tumor intervention
strategies may help improve the current effectiveness of tumor
treatment. Over the past few decades, numerous species of protozoa and
their components have exhibited anti-tumor potential via immune and
non-immune mechanisms. This discovery introduces a new research
direction for the development of new and effective cancer treatments.
Through <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments and studies involving
tumor-bearing mice, the anti-tumor ability of <italic>Toxoplasma
gondii</italic>, <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, <italic>Trypanosoma
cruzi</italic>, and other protozoa have unveiled diverse mechanisms by
which protozoa combat cancer, demonstrating encouraging prospects for
their application. In this review, we summarize the anti-tumor ability
and anti-tumor mechanisms of various protozoa and explore the potential
for their clinical development and application.

<p>date: 2024-01-11, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
<strong>Zurich, Switzerland - January 10th, 2024</strong>
</p>
<h2>
pg_dumpbinary
</h2>
<p>
<code>pg_dumpbinary</code> dumps a PostgreSQL database to a binary
format. The resulting dump must be restored using
<code>pg_restorebinary</code>, which is provided.
</p>
<p>
pg_dumpbinary 2.14 was released today, it adds two new options and fixes
some bugs reported by users since last release.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Add new option <code>–with-child</code>, when <code>-t</code> or
<code>-T</code> options are used, to include or exclude child and
partition tables. pg_dump will be used instead with options
<code>–table-and-children</code> or
<code>–exclude-table-and-children</code>. It requires PostgreSQL &gt;=
16.
</li>
<li>
Add <code>-V, –verbose</code> option that lists tables included in the
dump.
</li>
<li>
Add <code>-A, –attach SNAPSHOT</code> to be able to attach pg_dumpbinary
to an existing snapshot instead of creating a dedicated one.
</li>
<li>
Fix dump failure when sequences name have spaces.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
A full list of changes and acknowledgments can be found
<a href="https://github.com/lzlabs/pg_dumpbinary/releases/tag/v2.14">here</a>
</p>
<p>
<code>pg_dumpbinary</code> is useful when:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
You have bytea that can not be exported by <code>pg_dump</code> because
the total size of the escape/hex output exceeds 1Gb.
</li>
<li>
You have custom type that stores <code>\0</code> internally in bytea but
data are exported by pg_dump as char/varchar/text. In this case pg_dump
truncates all data after the first ‘\0’, resulting in data loss.
</li>
<li>
Other cases where a binary output format is useful.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
In these kinds of cases <code>pg_dumpbinary</code> helps by dumping the
PostgreSQL database in a binary format. In all other cases the
pg_dump/pg_restore commands distributed with PostgreSQL are preferred.
</p>

<h2 id="greenmask-v0.1.0-release">Greenmask v0.1.0 Release</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-11, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<h2>
PostgreSQL Dump and Obfuscation Tool
</h2>
<p>
We are excited to announce the release of Greenmask v0.1.0, marking the
first production-ready version. This release addresses various bug
fixes, introduces improvements, and includes documentation refactoring
for enhanced clarity.
</p>
<h3>
Greenmask overview
</h3>
<h4>
Key Features
</h4>
<ul>
<li>
Cross-Platform Support: Developed in Go, Greenmask is free of platform
dependencies.
</li>
<li>
Type-Safe Database Operations: Ensures data validation and encoding,
maintaining integrity.
</li>
<li>
Transformation Validation: Guarantees correct and maintainable data
transformations.
</li>
<li>
Partitioned Table Support: Eases configuration for partitioned tables.
</li>
<li>
Stateless and Backward Compatible: Compatible with standard PostgreSQL
utilities.
</li>
<li>
Parallel Execution: Boosts efficiency in dumping and restoration
processes.
</li>
<li>
Multiple Storage Options: Offers support for both local and remote
storage solutions.
</li>
</ul>
<h4>
Use Cases
</h4>
<ul>
<li>
Perfect for routine backup and restoration tasks.
</li>
<li>
Aids in anonymization and data masking for staging environments and
analytics.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Release notes
</h3>
<h4>
Improvements
</h4>
<ul>
<li>
Improved verbosity in custom transformer interaction, accumulating
stderr data and forwarding it in batches instead of writing it one by
one.
</li>
<li>
Added positional arguments for the list-transformers command, allowing
specific transformer information retrieval (e.g., <code>greenmask
list-transformers RandomDate</code>).
</li>
<li>
Added version parameter –version that prints greenmask utility version
</li>
<li>
Added Numeric parameters support for Int and Float transformers, with
the caveat that in a few cases, it may lead to out-of-range errors.
</li>
</ul>
<h4>
Changes
</h4>
<ul>
<li>
Updated dependencies to newer versions.
</li>
<li>
Enhanced the stability of the JSON line interaction protocol by
utilizing the stdlib JSON encoder/decoder.
</li>
<li>
Modified the method for sending table metadata to custom transformers;
now, it is sent via stdin in the first line in JSON format instead of
providing it via command arguments.
</li>
<li>
Refactored template functions naming.
</li>
<li>
Rewritten NoiseDate transformer implementation for improved stability
and predictability.
</li>
<li>
Changed the default value for the Dict transformer fail_not_matched
parameter to true.
</li>
<li>
Rewritten Hash transformer, now providing a salt parameter and receiving
a base64 encoded salt. If a salt is not provided, it generates one
randomly.
</li>
<li>
Added validator for NoiseDate and RandomDate transformers for the
truncate parameter, issuing a warning if the provided value is invalid.
</li>
<li>
Increased verbosity of parameter validation warnings, now properly
forwarding warnings to stdout.
</li>
</ul>
<h4>
Fixes
</h4>
<ul>
<li>
Resolved pgx driver connection leakage issue.
</li>
<li>
Fixed deletion failure of dumps for S3 storage.
</li>
<li>
Corrected cobra autocompletion for the Greenmask utility.
</li>
<li>
Fixed NOT NULL constraint validation.
</li>
<li>
Addressed JSON API interaction issues that previously caused deadlocks
and timeouts.
</li>
<li>
Fixed encode-decoding for binary parameters, ensuring accurate
forwarding of values to custom transformers.
</li>
<li>
Fixed the RandomChoice transformer to correctly marshal and unmarshal
values during validation.
</li>
<li>
Introduced the Nullable property for the SetNull transformer to enhance
NOT NULL constraint validation.
</li>
<li>
Resolved text wrapping issues for the validate command.
</li>
<li>
Fixed build failures on Windows due to Linux platform dependencies.
</li>
<li>
Corrected stdout readline buffer reading during interaction with custom
transformers.
</li>
<li>
Fixed integration tests.
</li>
</ul>
<h4>
Ecosystem Changes
</h4>
<ul>
<li>
Implemented CI/CD for the entire project.
</li>
<li>
Established a user-friendly playground in Docker-compose, including:
</li>
<li>
Deployed Minio storage container.
</li>
<li>
PostgreSQL container containing both the original database (Adventure
Works) and the transformed (empty DB).
</li>
<li>
Greenmask container itself.
</li>
<li>
Refactored current readme files.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Community Participation

<p>Vcc – the Vulkan Clang Compiler, is a proof-of-concept C and C++
compiler for Vulkan leveraging Clang as a front-end, and Shady our own
research IR and compiler. Unlike other shading languages, Vcc aims to
stick closely to standard C/C++ languages and merely adds a few new
intrinsics to cover GPU features. Vcc is similar to CUDA or Metal in
this regard, and aims to bring the advantages of standard host languages
to Vulkan shaders. ↫ The Vcc website Note that this project is a work in
progress, and has several limitations the project’s open about.</p>

<h2 id="the-biggest-smallest-png">The biggest smallest PNG</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>A few days ago, my former coworker Evan Hahn posted “The world’s
smallest PNG”, an article walking through the minimum required elements
of the PNG image format. He gave away the answer in the very first line:
However (spoilers!) he later points out that there are several valid
67-byte PNGs, such as a 1×1 all-white image, or an 8×1 all-black image,
or a 1×1 gray image. All of these exploit the fact that you can’t have
less than one byte of pixel data, so you might as well use all eight
bits of it. Clever! However again…are we really limited to one byte of
pixel data? ↫ Jordan Rose You know where this is going.</p>

<p>date: 2024-01-10, from: Gary Marcus blog</p>
<p>Big news today, via Stephanie Palazzolo at The Information: the group
Public Citizen yesterday petitioned the state California to reevaluate
OpenAI’s nonprofit status. As Robert Weissman, the President of Public
Citizen put it to me on a phone call, the OpenAI drama seemed in part to
be a showdown between for profit and nonprofit aspects of the
organization; it is not clear that organization as whole has remained
true to its nonprofit mission. “I don’t think it’s a radical argument we
are making. There was a competition here and the faction that won wanted
to pursue profit.”</p>

Senator Menendez Seeks Dismissal of Criminal Charges</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Senator Bob Menendez on Wednesday sought dismissal of
charges, including bribery, as his lawyers told a judge that New York
federal prosecutors are making claims that are “outrageously false” and
“distort reality.”</p>
<p>The New Jersey Democrat and his wife pleaded not guilty after they
were charged last fall with accepting bribes of gold bars, cash and a
luxury car in return for help from the senator that would benefit three
New Jersey businessmen, who were also arrested and pleaded not
guilty.</p>
<p>The indictment has since been updated with charges alleging that
Menendez used his political influence to secretly advance Egypt’s
interests and that he acted favorably to Qatar’s government to aid a
businessman.</p>
<p>“The Senator stands behind all of his official actions and decisions,
and will be proud to defend them at trial,” the lawyers wrote.</p>
<p>A trial is scheduled for May 5. Menendez is free on $100,000
bail.</p>
<p>Menendez’s lawyers said in court papers that their client’s conduct
was “constitutionally immune,” and none of it could serve as the basis
for criminal charges.</p>
<p>“The government’s accusations in this case — that he sold his office
and even sold out his nation — are outrageously false, and indeed
distort reality,” the lawyers wrote.</p>
<p>They said the government is free to prosecute members of Congress for
agreeing to exchange legislative action for personal benefits, as long
as it doesn’t attack the integrity of the legislative acts
themselves.</p>
<p>“But here, the Indictment does not try to walk that line; it flouts
it entirely,” the lawyers said.</p>
<p>They said prosecutors were wrong to charge Menendez in connection
with his decision to contact local state prosecutors to advocate on
behalf of New Jersey constituents or to use his decision to invite
constituents to meetings with foreign dignitaries as evidence against
him.</p>
<p>“And the government goes so far as to impugn the Senator for
introducing constituents to investors abroad. None of this is illegal,
or even improper,” the lawyers wrote.</p>
<p>The indictment claims Menendez directly interfered in criminal
investigations, including by pushing to install a federal prosecutor in
New Jersey he believed could be influenced in a criminal case against a
businessman and associate of the senator. Prosecutors also alleged that
Menendez tried to use his position of power to meddle in a separate
criminal investigation by the New Jersey Attorney General’s office.</p>
<p>Menendez’s lawyers said the novel charge that Menendez conspired with
his wife and a businessman to act as an agent of the Egyptian government
“fundamentally disrupts the separation of powers.”</p>
<p>Menendez, 70, was forced to step down from his powerful post leading
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee after he was charged in
September. Prosecutors said the senator and his wife, Nadine Menendez,
accepted bribes over the past five years from the New Jersey businessmen
in exchange for a variety of corrupt acts.</p>
<p>In October, he was charged with conspiring to act as an agent of the
Egyptian government. As a member of Congress, Menendez is prohibited
from acting as an agent for a foreign government.</p>
<p>His lawyers said in their Manhattan federal court filing Wednesday
that the charge empowers the executive and judicial branches of
government to second-guess the way the senator chooses to engage with
foreign representatives as he carries out his duties.</p>
<p>As an example, the lawyers said that a future president might decide
to prosecute legislative enemies as agents of Ukraine for supporting aid
during its war with Russia or as agents of China for resisting a
proposed ban of TikTok, or as agents of Israel for supporting military
aid to fight Hamas.</p>
<p>“The Court should not permit this novel and dangerous encroachment on
legislative independence,” the lawyers said.</p>
<p>They said there was “overwhelming, indisputable evidence” that
Menendez was independent from any foreign official.</p>
<p>“As the government knows from its own investigation, far from doing
Egypt’s bidding during the life of the alleged conspiracy, the Senator
repeatedly held up military aid and took Egypt to task, challenging its
government’s record for imprisoning political dissidents, running
roughshod over the press, and other human rights abuses,” they said.</p>
<p>The lawyers said that their arguments Wednesday were just the start
of legal challenges to be filed in the next week, including claims that
the indictment was filed in the wrong courthouse and unjustly groups
separate schemes into single conspiracy counts.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for prosecutors declined to comment.</p>

id="snow-in-west-flooding-in-east-heres-how-us-is-coping-with-massive-storm">Snow
in West, Flooding in East — Here’s How US Is Coping With Massive
Storm</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CONCORD, New Hampshire — A major storm drenched the Northeast and
slammed it with fierce winds, knocking out power to hundreds of
thousands following a bout of violent weather that struck most of the
U.S. </p>
<p>The storm, which started Tuesday night and was moving out Wednesday,
washed out roads and took down trees and power lines. Wind gusts reached
72 kph to 88 kph and more windy weather was expected throughout
Wednesday. </p>
<p>It followed a day of tornadoes and deadly accidents in the South and
blizzards in the Midwest and Northwest. In some parts of the Pacific
Northwest and the Rockies, more than about 75 centimeters of snow
fell. </p>
<p>Here’s how various areas are being affected by the storms: </p>
<p>New Jersey</p>
<p>New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy declared a state of emergency ahead of
the storm. Many streets and roads were flooded, and rivers were rising
after some areas got up to 7.6 centimeters of rain since Tuesday night.
The rain fell on ground saturated by another storm a few weeks ago.
Another storm is forecast for the weekend. </p>
<p>Lou DeFazio, 65, of Manville, New Jersey, lives steps away from the
Millstone River that flooded disastrously in 2021 after the remnants of
Ida slammed into the state and swerved riverbanks. </p>
<p>“It’s getting worse and worse,” he said, as the river swelled
Wednesday. </p>
<p>Murphy said 56,000 homes were without power and several hundred
accidents and highway assists were reported, but no storm deaths. He
said people often ignore flood warnings, to their peril. </p>
<p>“And we saw in the storm Ida, people pay with their lives by driving
their cars into a street they shouldn’t have, or staying in their home
when they shouldn’t have,” Murphy said in an interview with CBS New
York. </p>
<p>New York</p>
<p>In Nassau County, video showed cars sloshing through water that had
collected on the streets of Freeport. Further east, near the Hamptons,
the National Weather Service reported major flooding out of Shinnecock
Bay. Several schools across Long Island were either canceling or
delaying classes as a result of the storm. </p>
<p>New York City officials evacuated nearly 2,000 migrants housed at a
sprawling tent complex before the storm hit amid fears that the facility
could collapse in heavy winds. </p>
<p>Photos showed the migrant families sleeping on the floor of a
Brooklyn high school, whose students were forced to go remote on
Wednesday as a result of the brief relocation. The migrants returned to
the tent facility at about 4:30 a.m. Wednesday after the winds had
subsided, officials said. </p>
<p>Pennsylvania </p>
<p>A couple of Pennsylvania communities got more than 10 centimeters of
rain and others received nearly that amount. Emergency responders
rescued some drivers from stranded vehicles as roads flooded in
low-lying areas, and downed trees and wires cut power to thousands of
customers. </p>
<p>Forecasters said several rivers in eastern Pennsylvania saw at least
moderate flooding. Another storm bringing as much as 3.8 centimeters of
rain Friday night through Saturday would exacerbate flooding and bring
very strong winds, officials said. </p>
<p>New England</p>
<p>A dam breach in Bozrah, Connecticut, prompted mandatory evacuation
orders Wednesday for several areas along the Yantic River, Norwich
officials said. A power company shut down a substation along the river
leaving about 5,000 homes and businesses without power. </p>
<p>The storm canceled events and government functions in Maine, where
some areas were still recovering from a snowstorm over the weekend and
flooding the previous month. </p>
<p>Winds gusted to 153 kph at Maine’s Isle au Haut, an island in
Penobscot Bay, said Jon Palmer from the National Weather Service in
Gray, Maine. At the state’s largest airport, high winds pushed an empty
passenger aircraft into a jet bridge, Portland Jetport officials said
Wednesday. No one was hurt. </p>
<p>At parking lot near Widgery Wharf on the Portland’s waterfront,
lobster fishermen attempted to turn back some of the flooding using
pumps. </p>
<p>Maine Gov. Janet Mills encouraged residents to stay off the roads
amid flash flood warnings. </p>
<p>“Please be sure to give plow trucks, utility crews, and emergency
first responders plenty of space as they work to keep us safe,” she
said. </p>
<p>In Vermont, the storm brought wind gusts of up to 70 miles per hour
and heaving wet snow, followed by rain, leaving nearly 30,000 homes
without power Wednesday morning. Many schools were closed or had delayed
openings. </p>
<p>Midwest </p>
<p>Slushy highways led to fatal collisions in Wisconsin and another in
Michigan. </p>
<p>The storm, which began Monday, buried cities across the Midwest in
snow, stranding people on highways. Some areas saw up to 30 centimeters
of snow on Monday, including Kansas, eastern Nebraska and South Dakota,
western Iowa, and southwestern Minnesota. </p>
<p>Madison, Wisconsin, was under a winter storm warning until early
Wednesday, with as much as 23 centimeters of snow and 64 kph winds on
tap. </p>
<p>The weather has already affected campaigning for Iowa’s January 15
precinct caucuses, where the snow is expected to be followed by frigid
temperatures that could drift below minus 18 Celsius. </p>
<p>Forecasters warned snow-struck regions of the Midwest and the Great
Plains that temperatures could plunge dangerously low because of wind
chill, dipping to around minus 29 Celsius and even far lower in Chicago,
Kansas City and some areas of Montana. </p>
<p>South </p>
<p>Several deaths have been blamed on storms that struck the area with
heavy rain, tornado reports, hail and wind. Survey teams were heading
out Wednesday in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina to
determine whether tornados struck, National Weather Service officials
said. </p>
<p>An 81-year-old woman in Alabama was killed when her mobile home was
tossed from its foundation by a suspected tornado. A man died south of
Atlanta when a tree fell on his car. Another person died in North
Carolina after a suspected tornado struck a mobile home park. </p>
<p>Roofs were blown off homes, furniture, fences and debris were strewn
about during the height of the storm in the South. </p>
<p>Many areas of Florida remained under flood watches, warnings and
advisories early Wednesday amid concerns that streams and rivers were
topping their banks. Gov. Ron DeSantis, who gave his State of the State
address Tuesday as tornado warnings were active outside the Capitol,
issued an executive order to include 49 counties in North Florida under
a state of emergency. </p>
<p>Rescuers in Virginia pulled two people from flood waters, where they
were clinging to branches after their vehicle flooded and they were then
swept from its roof, according to the Albemarle County Fire Rescue. They
weren’t injured but were in the water for at least 10 minutes, according
to spokesperson Abbey Stumpf. </p>
<p>West</p>
<p>Storms in the Pacific Northwest and Rocky Mountains dumped snow,
including 74 centimeters reported at Stevens Pass in Washington state
and 76 centimeters outside of Santa Fe, New Mexico, according to the
National Weather Service. </p>
<p>Authorities issued warnings for very dangerous avalanche conditions
in mountainous areas of Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Utah, Washington and
Oregon. Backcountry travelers were advised to stay off steep slopes and
away from the bottom of steep slopes. </p>
<p>In areas of northern Montana, temperatures could drop below minus 30
degrees (minus 34 Celsius) by Saturday morning. High temperatures were
expected to remain below freezing as far south as Oklahoma.</p>

Biden Makes Surprise Visit to Capitol Hill as GOP Takes First Step to
Hold Him in Contempt</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Hunter Biden made a surprise visit to a Capitol Hill
hearing Wednesday as Republicans were taking the first step toward
holding President Joe Biden’s son in contempt of Congress for defying a
congressional subpoena in a bitterly contested standoff.</p>
<p>The arrival of president’s son at the Oversight Committee, sitting in
the audience with his legal team, including attorney Abbe Lowell, sent
the panel that is working to impeach President Biden into a political
frenzy.</p>
<p>Republican Rep. Nancy Mace insisted that Hunter Biden be quickly
arrested. GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene called him a coward as he left
during her remarks. Democratic lawmakers argued that Biden, who has
refused to testify to the panel behind closed doors, should be allowed
to speak publicly.</p>
<p>Hunter Biden has defended his lack of compliance with the GOP-issued
subpoena, which ordered him to appear for closed-door testimony in
mid-December. Biden and his attorneys said information from private
interviews can be selectively leaked and manipulated by House
Republicans and insisted that he would only testify in public.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Committee Chairman James Comer struggled to regain
control. “Mr. Biden doesn’t make the rules, we make the rules,” he
said.</p>
<p>The House Oversight and Judiciary committees will each vote on
contempt resolutions that seem likely to result in the U.S. House
recommending criminal charges as Republicans move into the final stages
of their impeachment inquiry into the president himself.</p>
<p>It’s the latest step for the inquiry, which began in September, but
has so far failed to uncover evidence directly implicating the president
in wrongdoing involving his son’s business dealings.</p>
<p>If the committees approve the contempt resolutions as expected, they
will go to the full House for consideration. And if the House votes to
hold Hunter Biden in contempt, it will be up to the Justice Department
to decide whether to prosecute.</p>
<p>The contempt referral would be yet another headache for federal
prosecutors already under heavy scrutiny for their handling of charges
against Hunter Biden related to his taxes and gun use.</p>
<p>Shelving the contempt of Congress charges would likely further stoke
conservative criticism that the Justice Department is politicized —
especially given that two one-time advisers to former President Donald
Trump were prosecuted for contempt of Congress by the Biden
administration. But prosecuting contempt cases can be difficult.</p>
<p>“It’s clear the Republican chairmen aren’t interested in getting the
facts or they would allow Hunter to testify publicly,” Hunter Biden’s
attorney, Lowell, said in a statement Friday. “Instead, House
Republicans continue to play politics by seeking an unprecedented
contempt motion against someone who has from the first request offered
to answer all their proper questions.”</p>
<p>He added, “What are they afraid of?”</p>
<p>Further angering Republicans, Hunter Biden did come to the Capitol on
the day specified by the subpoena — but not to testify. Instead, he
stood behind microphones outside the U.S. Capitol complex — a couple
hundred feet away from the awaiting GOP investigators — and delivered a
rare public statement defending his business affairs and castigating the
yearslong investigations into him and his family.</p>
<p>“There is no evidence to support the allegations that my father was
financially involved in my business because it did not happen,” the
president’s son said in those remarks.</p>
<p>He added, “There is no fairness or decency in what these Republicans
are doing — they have lied over and over about every aspect of my
personal and professional life — so much so that their lies have become
the false facts believed by too many people.</p>
<p>After delivering the statement to the media, Hunter Biden left the
Capitol grounds.</p>
<p>The contempt resolution, released by Republicans on Monday, reads,
“Mr. Biden’s flagrant defiance of the Committees’ deposition subpoenas —
while choosing to appear nearby on the Capitol grounds to read a
prepared statement on the same matters — is contemptuous, and he must be
held accountable for his unlawful actions.”</p>
<p>While Republicans say their inquiry is ultimately focused on the
president, they have taken particular interest in Hunter Biden and his
overseas business dealings, questioning whether the president profited
from that work.</p>
<p>Republicans have also focused a large part of their investigation on
whistleblower allegations that there has been political interference in
the long-running Justice Department investigation into Hunter Biden.</p>
<p>The committees’ votes Wednesday on contempt of Congress come a day
before Hunter Biden is scheduled to make his first court appearance on
tax charges filed by a special counsel in Los Angeles. He is facing
three felony and six misdemeanor counts, including filing a false
return, tax evasion, failure to file and failure to pay.</p>
<p>His lawyer has accused David Weiss, the special counsel overseeing
the yearslong case, of “bowing to Republican pressure” by bringing the
charges.</p>

Rescinds Permission for Trump to Give His Own Closing Argument at His
Civil Fraud Trial</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — Donald Trump won’t make his own closing argument in his
New York civil business fraud trial after his lawyers objected to the
judge’s insistence that the former president would stick to “relevant”
matters.</p>
<p>Judge Arthur Engoron rescinded permission on Wednesday, a day ahead
of closing arguments in the trial.</p>
<p>The trial could cost Trump hundreds of millions of dollars in
penalties and strip him of his ability to do business in New York. His
lawyers had signaled Thursday that he planned to take the extraordinary
step of delivering a summation personally, in addition to arguments from
his legal team.</p>
<p>Trump is a defendant in the case, brought by New York Attorney
General Letitia James. She claims his net worth was inflated by billions
of dollars on financial statements that helped him secure business loans
and insurance.</p>
<p>The former president and current Republican 2024 front-runner denies
any wrongdoing, and he has lambasted the case as a “hoax” and a
political attack on him. James and the judge are Democrats.</p>
<p>It’s extremely unusual for people who have lawyers to give their own
closing arguments. In an email exchange that happened over recent days
and was filed in court Wednesday, Engoron initially approved the unusual
request, saying he was “including to let everyone have his or her
say.”</p>
<p>But he said Trump would have to limit his remarks to the boundaries
that cover attorneys’ closing arguments: “commentary on the relevant,
material facts that are in evidence, and application of the relevant law
to those facts.”</p>
<p>He would not be allowed to introduce new evidence, “comment on
irrelevant matters” or “deliver a campaign speech” — or impugn the
judge, his staff, the attorney general, her lawyers or the court system,
the judge wrote.</p>
<p>Trump attorney Christopher Kise responded that those limitations were
unfair and said Trump could not agree to them.</p>

<h2 id="accessible-fart-machines">Accessible Fart Machines</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-10, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>

<p>
I stumbled across this TED talk by Holly Cohen about building accessible
fart machines with Arduino. As someone who loves to tell jokes – and
particularly loves a good fart joke – the phrase “they were the ones
telling the jokes” makes me impossibly happy.
</p>
<p>
When I was a teacher in Japan I taught two young sisters with cerebral
palsy. Both girls could neither move nor talk but they loved to smile
and laugh at a good joke or goof about their teachers – like any other
junior high school kid. The highlight of my week was hanging out with
those girls, I know they would have loved their own fart machine.
</p>
<p>
In 2018 (two years after this talk), Microsoft launched their
revolutionary $99
<a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/accessories/controllers/xbox-adaptive-controller">Xbox
Adaptive Controller</a> which is helping kids with motor control
difficulties play video games. It’s like the adaptive tech shown at the
end of Cohen’s talk, but way more professional. It must have cost a
pretty penny to design, research, and productize this device. So what’s
the ROI on creating an accessible interface? It doesn’t fuckin’ matter.
That’s what. It’s about bringing people in on the fun.

including Europe, Japan, and China. Now it’s also available in the US.

a guy who likes to write, I am probably not a lot better about writing
docs than most other developers. We’re supposed to leave a good trail
behind us, but I’ve only managed to do that in certain ways. For
example, I have standardized on a
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/feedland/blob/main/worknotes.md">worknotes.md</a>
file for each of my projects and I’m pretty good about updating it. I
also publish the OPML source of my code, which contains a lot more in
the way of internal docs than the JavaScript files I publish alongside
them, simply because the outline format lends itself to inline docs, and
I have been doing that systematically for at least thirty years. And I
now include the OPML source in most projects in a file called
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/pagePark/blob/master/source.opml">source.opml</a>.
There’s a big comment at the top of each of the files at the top that
explains. If you’re interested, work backward through the

my repos.</p>

The rain is tapering off, but the worst may be yet to come. As National
Weather Service meteorologist Patrick Wilson
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/09/us/storm-east-coast-flooding.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a>
The New York Times: “The worst time for flooding is right after the rain
stops.” It takes time for the water dumped by a storm to travel down
from mountains and make its way into smaller streams and rivers, Wilson
said. But when it does, those waterways can flood.

moderate to major river flooding could inundate parts of the

with wind gusts that could exceed 60 mph increase the chances of coastal
flooding.

Isn’t climate change making winters warmer? Yes, the
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-01-08/winter-storm-aside-snow-is-disappearing-because-of-climate-change?leadSource=uverify%20wall" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">trend</a>
over time is for warmer winter temperatures with less snowfall. But
“‘less cold’ does not mean ‘never cold,’”
<a href="https://www.climaterealityproject.org/blog/winter-weather-and-climate-crisis-explained" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">explains</a>
the Climate Reality Project. And when winter storms do hit, they’re
likely to be more intense as global temperatures rise.

<p>
As Dr. Jennifer Francis, a senior scientist with the Woodwell Climate
Research Center,
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=fce17db1d2&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">explained
to the Union of Concerned Scientists</a> last year, warmer temperatures
give weather systems “more fuel to work with in the form of water vapor
and heat, more moisture, and as a result, these storms are dumping more
precipitation.”

<h2 id="overturn-an-election">“Overturn an election?”</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-10, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I spend a lot of time thinking about words, and when I hear a phrase
that seems wrong to me, I’ll work on it until I figure out why it seems
wrong and what would be a better way to express the actual idea.
</p>
<p>
That said, I don’t think Trump tried to “overturn an election.”
</p>
<p>
More accurately, he tried to “overthrow the government.”
</p>
<p>
Why I say that:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Overturn could be something you do legitimately. If you are convicted of
a crime, you could appeal it, be exonerated, and the correct verb would
be overturn. Overturn doesn’t convey the illegitimacy of what Trump
tried to do. The criminality of it. The abhorrence of it, by American
values. He tried to “overturn” our most sacred ritual, the transfer of
power from one person to another, based on the vote of the people.
Overthrow is a much better word for what was done.
</li>
<li>
When you commit a crime, say for example killing someone, we don’t say
they tried to illegally use a weapon, that’s too technical, we say
they’re “accused of murder.” We focus on the consequences. There are
lots of ways to illegally use a weapon, what matters is the intended
result.
</li>
<li>
There is always exactly one president, at all times, in all
circumstances. It’s spelled out in the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twentieth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution">20th
Amendment</a>.
</li>
<li>
On January 20, 2021, we had an actual peaceful transfer of power when
Joe Biden <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwvbQR887W0">took the
oath</a>, but the transfer actually took place before he took the oath,
at 12PM exactly.
</li>
<li>
You can also look at the government as a continuous thing, the only
difference is there is a new person occupying the office of president.
Same government, the one defined by the Constitution. Always on.
</li>
<li>
So on January 6, 2021, the then-president Donald Trump, tried to destroy
the government, replacing it with a new government, one that doesn’t
follow the Constitution.
</li>
</ul>

<li>America’s carbon emissions fell for the first time since the
pandemic
</h3>
<p>
<strong></strong>America’s greenhouse gas pollution from energy and
industrial activities fell by 1.9% in 2023 compared to the year before,
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=aa4d840a0e&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according
to</a> energy research firm the Rhodium Group. This marks the first time
since the pandemic that carbon emissions have dropped. But perhaps more
importantly, the reduction happened even as the broader American economy
grew. “It’s the first time this decade that the United States has hit
the important mark of growing its economy and cutting its climate
pollution at the same time,”
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=47aa5f11ff&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">says
<em>Heatmap</em>’s Robinson Meyer</a>. Climate pollution from the power
sector fell by 8% last year, a greater decline than in any other part of
the economy, driven partly by the death of the coal industry, partly by
an exceptionally warm winter. But there is still much work to be done:
America must roughly triple its pace of pollution reductions to meet its
Paris Agreement goal of cutting emissions in half by 2030. “Emissions
cuts of that magnitude are probably not feasible,” Meyer

its Arctic waters, a move that “paves the way for a new frontier in
mining,”

Adam Vaughan at the <em>Times</em> of London. Demand for critical
minerals that help power many of our technologies – including wind
turbines and electric cars – is expected to grow more than three times
by 2030, and companies have been eyeing the seabed as a source. Some
suggest seabed extraction could be less environmentally harmful than
traditional mineral mining, but environmentalists worry it could destroy
delicate ecosystems. More than 20 countries recently backed a moratorium
on deep-sea mining.

Kickstarting “The Bezzle” audiobook, sequel to Red Team Blues (10 Jan
2024)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-10, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links Kickstarting “The Bezzle” audiobook, sequel to Red Team
Blues: Another Wil Wheaton banger, necessitated by Amazon’s perfidy. Hey
look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2004, 2014,
2019, 2023 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances,
current writing projects, current reading Kickstarting “The Bezzle”
audiobook, sequel to Red Team Blues (permalink) I’m kickstarting the
audiobook for The Bezzle, the sequel to last year’s Red Team Blues,
featuring Marty Hench, a hard-charging, two-fisted forensic accountant
who spent 40 years in Silicon Valley, busting every finance scam hatched
by tech bros’ feverish imaginations: http://thebezzle.org Marty Hench is
a great character to write. His career in high-tech scambusting starts
in the early 1980s with the first PCs and stretches all the way to the
cryptocurrency era, the most target-rich environment for scamhunting
tech has ever seen. Hench is the Zelig of tech scams, and I’m having so
much fun using him to probe the seamy underbelly of the tech economy.
Enter The Bezzle, which will be published by Tor Books and Head of Zeus
on Feb 20: this adventure finds Marty in the company of Scott Warms, one
of the many bright technologists whose great startup was bought and
destroyed by Yahoo! (yes, they really used that asinine exclamation
mark). Scott is shackled to the Punctuation Factory by golden handcuffs,
and he’s determined to get fired without cause, so he can collect his
shares and move onto the next thing. That’s how Scott and Marty find
themselves on Catalina island, the redoubt of the Wrigley family, where
bison roam the hills, yachts bob in the habor and fast food is banned.
Scott invites Marty on a series of luxury vacations on Catalina, which
end abruptly when they discover – and implode – a hamburger-related
Ponzi scheme run by a real-estate millionaire who is destroying the
personal finances of the Island’s working-class townies out of sheer
sadism. Scott’s victory is bittersweet: sure, he blew up the Ponzi
scheme, but he’s also made powerful enemies – the kinds of enemies who
can pull strings with the notoriously corrupt LA County Sheriff’s
Deputies who are the only law on Catalina, and after taking a pair of
felony plea deals, Scott gets the message and never visits Catalina
Island again. That could have been the end of it, but California’s
three-strikes law – since rescinded – means that when Scott picks up one
more felony conviction for some drugs discovered during a traffic stop,
he’s facing life in prison. That’s where The Bezzle really gets into
gear. At its core, The Bezzle is a novel about the “shitty technology
adoption curve”: the idea that our worst technological schemes are
sanded smooth on the bodies of prisoners, mental patients, kids and
refugees before they work their way up the privilege gradient and are
inflicted on all of us:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/12/algorithmic-wage-discrimination/#fishers-of-men
America’s prisons are vicious, brutal places, and technology has only
made them worse. When Scott’s prison swaps out in-person visits, the
prison library, and phone calls for a “free” tablet that offers all
these services as janky apps that cost ten times more than they would on
the outside, the cruelty finds a business model. Working inside and
outside the prison Marty Hench and Scott Warms figure out the full
nature of the scam that the captive audience of prisoners are
involuntary beta-testers for, and they discover a sprawling web of
real-estate fraud, tech scams, and offshore finance that is extracting
fortunes from the hides of America’s prisoners and their families. The
criminals who run that kind of enterprise aren’t shy about fighting for
what they’ve got, and they’re more than happy to cut some of LA County’s
notorious deputy gangs in for a cut in exchange for providing some
kinetic support for the project. The Bezzle is exactly the kind of book
I was hoping I’d get to write when I kicked off the Hench series – one
that decodes the scam economy, from music royalties to prison
videoconferencing, real estate investment trusts to Big Four accounting
firm bogus audits. It’s both a fast-moving, two-fisted crime novel and a
masterclass on how the rich and powerful get away with both literal and
figurative murder. It’s getting a big push from both my publishers and
I’ll be touring western Canada and the US with it. The early reviews are
spectacular. But despite all of this, I had to make my own audiobook for
it, which I’m pre-selling on Kickstarter: http://thebezzle.org Why?
Because Audible – Amazon’s monopoly gatekeeper to the audiobook world,
with more than 90% of the market – refuses to carry my work. Audible
uses Digital Rights Management to lock every audiobook they sell to
their platform. Legally, only an Audible-authorized app can decrypt and
play the audiobooks they sell you. Distributing a tool that removes
Audible DRM is a felony under Section 1201 of the 1998 DMCA. That means
that if you break up with Audible – delete your Audible apps – you will
lose your entire audiobook library. And the fact that you’re Audible’s
hostage makes the writers you love into their hostages, too. Writers
understand that if they leave the Audible platform, their audience will
have to choose between following them, or losing all their audiobooks.
That’s how Audible gets away with abusing its performers and writers, up
to and including the $100m Audiblegate wage-theft scandal:
https://www.audiblegate.com/ Audible can steal $100m from its
writers…and the writers still continue to sell on the platform, because
leaving will cost them their audience. This is canonical
enshittification: lock in users, then screw suppliers. Lots of companies
abuse DRM to do this, but none can hold a candle to Amazon, who
understand that the DMCA is a copyright law that protects corporations
at the expense of creators. Under DMCA 1201 commercial distribution of a
“circumvention device” carries a five-year prison sentence and a
$500,000 fine. That means that if I write a book, pay to have it
recorded, and then sell it to you through Audible, I am criminally
prohibited from giving you the tool to take it from Audible to another
platform. Even though I hold the copyright to that work, I would face a
harsher sentence than you would if you simply pirated the audiobook from
some darknet site. Not only that: if you shoplifted the audiobook in CD
form, you’d get a lighter sentence than I, the copyright holder, would
receive for giving you a tool to unlock it from Amazon’s platform! Hell,
if you hijacked the truck that delivered the CD, you’d get off lighter
than I would. This is a scam straight out of a Marty Hench novel. This
is batshit. I won’t allow it. My books are licensed on the condition
that they must not be sold with DRM. Which means that Audible won’t sell
my books, which means that my publishers are thoroughly disinterested in
paying thousands of dollars to produce audiobooks of my titles. A book
that isn’t sold in the one store than accounts for 90% of all sales is
unlikely to do well. That’s where you come in. Since 2020, I’ve used
Kickstarter to pre-sell five of my audiobooks (I wrote nine books during
lockdown!). All told, I’ve raised over $750,000 (gross! but still!) on
these crowdfunders. More than 20,000 backers have pitched in! The last
two of these books – The Internet Con and The Lost Cause – were national
bestsellers. This isn’t just a way for me to pay off a lot of bills and
put away something for retirement – it’s proof that readers care about
supporting writers and don’t want to be locked in by a giant monopolist
that depends on its drivers pissing in bottles to make quota. It’s a
powerful message about the desire for something better than Amazon. It’s
part of the current that is driving the FTC to haul Amazon into court
for being a monopolist, and also part of the inspiration for other
authors to try treating Amazon as damage and routing around it, with
spectacular results:
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dragonsteel/surprise-four-secret-novels-by-brandon-sanderson
And I’m doing it again. Last December, I went into Skyboat Media’s
studios where Gabrielle De Cuir directed Wil Wheaton, who reprised his
role as Marty Hench for the audiobook of The Bezzle. It came out
amazing: https://archive.org/details/bezzle-sample Now I’m pre-selling
this audiobook, as well as the ebook and hardcover for The Bezzle. I’m
also offering bundles with the ebook and audiobook for Red Team Blues
(naturally these are all DRM-free). You can get your books signed and
personalized and shipped anywhere in the world, courtesy of Book Soup,
and I’ve partnered with Libro.fm to deliver DRM-free audiobooks with an
app for people who don’t want to mess around with sideloading. I’ve also
got some spendy options for high rollers. There’s three chances to name
a character in the next Hench novel (Picks and Shovels, Feb 2025).
There’s also five chances to commission a Hench short story about your
favorite tech scam, and get credited when the story is published. The
Kickstarter runs for the next three weeks, which should give me time to
get the hardcopy books signed and shipped to arrive around the on-sale
date. What’s more, I’ve finally worked out all the post-Brexit kinks
with shipping my UK publisher’s books to EU backers. I’m working with
Otherland Books to fulfill those EU orders, and it looks like I’m going
to be able to sign a giant stack of those when I’m in Berlin later this
month to give the annual Marshall McLuhan lecture at the Canadian
embassy: https://transmediale.de/en/2024/event/mcluhan-2024 Red Team
Blues and its sequels are some of the most fun – and informative – work
I’ve done in my quarter-century career. I love how they blend technical
explanations of the scam economy with high-intensity technothrillers.
That’s the the same mix as my bestselling YA series Little Brother
series – but these are firmly adult novels. The Bezzle came out great. I
hope you’ll give it a try – and that you’ll come out to see me in late
February when I hit the road with the book! Here’s that Kickstarter link

There are a lot of pressing risks around the globe this year. What poses
the biggest risk? According to an annual report from political risk
consultancy Eurasia Group, the U.S. presidential election — expected to
exacerbate political dysfunction — tops the list. (But don’t worry, we
hear an upbeat prediction too.) Plus, are you an independent contractor
or an employee? Regulators have a new litmus test.

De Facto Ambassador to US Meets US House Speaker, China Angered</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>TAIPEI/BEIJING — Taiwan’s de facto ambassador to the United States
met on Tuesday with U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson,
Taiwan’s foreign ministry said on Wednesday, drawing a stern rebuke from
Beijing.</p>
<p>The United States is Taiwan’s most important international backer and
arms supplier despite the lack of formal diplomatic ties with the
island, which China views as its own territory.</p>
<p>Alexander Yui took up his new post last month, replacing Hsiao
Bi-khim, who is now running to be vice president in Taiwan’s elections
on Saturday.</p>
<p>Taiwan’s foreign ministry said Yui thanked the U.S. Congress for its
long-term, cross-party support for Taiwan and commitment to
strengthening the island’s defenses.</p>
<p>It said this was the first time the two men had met.</p>
<p>China staged war games around Taiwan in August of 2022 after
then-House speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taipei, and in Beijing the
Chinese Foreign Ministry expressed anger at the Johnson-Yui meeting.</p>
<p>U.S. lawmakers should “stop sending wrong signals to Taiwan
independence separatist forces and must not intervene in the Taiwan
region’s elections in any form,” spokesperson Mao Ning told
reporters.</p>
<p>China routinely objects to any form of what it views as official
contacts between Taiwanese and U.S. officials, saying it is an
interference in internal Chinese affairs. Beijing says Taiwan is the
most sensitive and important issue in Sino-U.S. relations.</p>
<p>Taiwan’s government opposes China’s sovereignty claims, saying the
People’s Republic of China has never ruled the island and has no right
to speak for it or control it as only Taiwan’s people can do that.</p>

to blog about the whole experience.
</p>
<p>
Well, it’s January 10th, I am in charge of the site and I do plan to
post updates on this journey under the title <em>“The Mimo Diaries”</em>
and this is the first entry of the series.
</p>
<p>
So how is it going? I’d say so far so good. If you are a visitor of the
site you might have noticed that a first change is already in place:
posts no longer have short text content. Let me explain the reasoning
behind that decision.
</p>
<h2>
Writing on the web
</h2>
<p>
Minimalissimo started back in 2009 and the web was a very different
place. Content generation and content consumption were substantially
different than they are now and it made sense to have a “traditional”
blog/magazine with text and images.
</p>
<p>
But I believe that is no longer true in 2024. I’m not saying writing on
the web is pointless, quite the contrary. What I’m saying is that I
don’t think there’s much added value to the user in writing short posts
to go along with the images on the site. It’s probably useful from a SEO
perspective but, as you know, I don’t care about SEO all that much. I
care about users and user experience. And I think the value that Mimo
provides is in the visual curation, not in the written content.
</p>
<p>
Now, that is true for short posts but it’s definitely not true for the
newsletter. I do plan to keep that one going and make it a more
important part of the Mimo ecosystem. The newsletter is going to be the
place for longer content, focused on the topic of minimalism. That’s my
current plan and we’ll see how it goes. So,
<a href="https://buttondown.email/minimalissimo" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">make
sure you subscribe to the Minimalissimo newsletter</a> if you want to
get the full Minimalissimo experience.

Carbon Emissions Fell for the First Time Since Covid</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-10, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTAzNzgwMC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczMzQzNjg4M30.ogEGH17r01Kn2hiq5hTQ7TQrW_xmd2W_vTQEhrkSM5w/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
For the first time since the pandemic began, both America’s economy and
its carbon emissions moved in the right direction last year, according
to
<a href="https://rhg.com/research/us-greenhouse-gas-emissions-2023/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a
major annual estimate</a> of the country’s climate pollution.
</p>
<p>
America’s greenhouse gas pollution from energy and industrial activities
fell by 1.9% in 2023 compared to the year before, even as the broader
American economy grew, according to the Rhodium Group, an energy
research firm. It’s the first time this decade that the United States
has hit the important mark of growing its economy and cutting its
climate pollution at the same time.
</p>
<p>
Yet despite that progress, emissions probably aren’t falling fast enough
for the U.S. to hit its climate goals under the Paris Agreement.
</p>
<p>
The new report is the first to provide a sense of how America’s
greenhouse gas emissions changed last year, when the fuel economy of new
cars
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/fuel-economy-record-epa-evs-hybrids" target="_self">hit
an all-time high</a> and the Biden administration’s climate law
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/john-podesta-tax-credits-schedule-hydrogen-sustainable-aviation-fuel-manufacturing" target="_self">began
to go into effect</a>. The estimate is part of the Rhodium Group’s
<a href="https://rhg.com/research/taking-stock-2023/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">long-running</a>
<a href="https://rhg.com/research/taking-stock-2022/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">series</a>
<a href="https://rhg.com/research/taking-stock-2021/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">of</a>
<a href="https://rhg.com/research/taking-stock-2020/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">analyses</a>
of American emissions, which are regularly cited by experts and
government officials.
</p>
<p>
Here are five big takeaways from the new report:
</p>
<p>
<strong>1. The American economy is becoming less carbon-intensive — and
the rate of that change is accelerating.</strong>
</p>
<p>
America’s carbon emissions peaked in 2005, when the U.S. released
<a href="https://www.c2es.org/content/u-s-emissions/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">nearly
7.5 billion tons</a> of greenhouse gases. Since then, the economy has
kept growing, but climate pollution has slowly fallen. Last year,
America emitted as much carbon as it did in 1991, when the economy was
roughly a quarter of its current size.
</p>
<p>
This trend has picked up recently, according to the new report. Although
the American economy
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/economy/us-economy-china-europe/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has
mounted a vigorous recovery</a> from the pandemic recession, emissions
remain about 6% below their 2019 level. The U.S. also cut emissions
faster this year than it did during the 2010s.

</p>
<p>
<strong>2. The power grid is driving most of those emissions
reductions.</strong>
</p>
<p>
Last year, climate pollution from the power sector fell by 8%, a greater
decline than in any other part of the economy.
</p>
<p>
That’s partly because the coal industry is dying. Coal continues to
generate less and less power every year (even though it
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2022/07/us-carbon-emissions-russian-invasion/661493/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">blipped
back up briefly</a> in 2021) as the economics of natural gas, wind, and
solar drive it off the grid. Not only did the United States
<a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/chart-the-us-installed-more-solar-in-2023-than-ever-before#:~:text=This%20has%20been%20a%20record,Industries%20Association%20and%20Wood%20Mackenzie." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">install
a record amount</a> of solar in 2023, it also opened its
<a href="https://www.georgiapower.com/company/news-center/2023-articles/vogtle-unit-3-goes-into-operation.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first
new nuclear reactor in decades</a>. Last year, for only the second time
ever, nuclear power plants generated more electricity than coal plants
did.
</p>
<p>
<strong>3. A warm winter also helped.</strong>
</p>
<p>
About 10% of America’s greenhouse gas emissions are produced by
buildings, which mostly mean the furnaces in homes and offices. Space
heating is
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/pressroom/releases/press535.php#:~:text=Households%20that%20used%20fuel%20oil,their%20primary%20space%2Dheating%20fuel." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the
most energy-intensive thing</a> most Americans do in their homes, and
the overwhelming majority of American
<a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/6/20/17474124/electrification-natural-gas-furnace-heat-pump" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">private
residences</a> and
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=60301#:~:text=Natural%20gas%20is%20the%20predominant,for%20space%20heating%20in%202018." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">commercial
buildings</a> are heated with fossil fuels.
</p>
<p>
Thanks to climate change, 2023 was
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-67861954" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the
warmest year ever measured</a>, featuring
<a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/blogs/enso/verification-2022-2023-us-winter-outlook#:~:text=The%20winter%20temperature%20outlook%20for,Michigan%20to%20the%20West%20Coast." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an
especially mild winter</a> in the eastern and southern parts of the
country. That meant that — ironically — Americans had to burn less oil,
propane, and gas in their tens of millions of furnaces nationwide to
keep warm, causing building emissions to fall by about 4% compared to
the year before.
</p>
<p>
<strong>4. Transportation and industrial emissions are still
problems</strong>.
</p>
<h3>
U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions by Major Emitting Sector
</h3>
<p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="Chart of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="1df8f8564f8f99bcbf17fd2dbc0b46e1" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="4ebb5" loading="lazy" src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTAzODY0Ny9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0MDMzNDc2Nn0.ZgEEaffJyoRc9t81uco7UXrn9lspM9V326aaUYPoLFY/image.png?width=980"/>

Group</small>
</p>
<p>
Not every part of the economy saw emissions fall. In the transportation
sector, carbon pollution levels rose slightly, driven not by cars and
trucks as much as by an increase in air travel, which all but depends on
fossil fuels. Last year was
<a href="https://www.airport-technology.com/news/us-busiest-year-ever-air-travel/#:~:text=The%20US%20aviation%20industry%20celebrated,Department%20of%20Transportation%20(DOT)." target="_blank">the
busiest year for air travel</a> in American history, and demand for jet
fuel rose 5% compared to 2022.
</p>
<p>
The industrial sector — a catch-all term for dozens of heavy industries,
including steel, cement, mining, and chemicals-making — also increased
its emissions last year. Unlike in the power sector (and, for that
matter, ground-based transportation), engineers and experts
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/cop28-global-stocktake-climate-tech" target="_self">are
still figuring out</a> how to do many of the most carbon-intensive
industrial activities without releasing greenhouse gases into the
atmosphere.
</p>
<p>
But the industrial sector also includes the fossil-fuel industry, and
last year, America’s oil and gas production
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/us-oil-output-hits-record-producers-boost-drilling-efficiency-kemp-2023-11-01/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reached
an all-time high</a>. Oil and natural gas emit climate pollution not
just when they’re burned, but also when they’re extracted, and in 2023,
the country’s roaring oil and gas industry was the biggest contributor
to the industrial sector’s rising emissions.
</p>
<p>
Leaking, flaring, or venting natural gas — which is mostly comprised of
methane, a greenhouse gas more than 20 times as potent as carbon dioxide
over the long term — especially puts additional climate pollution in the
air. While the EPA will soon begin enforcing rules that crack down on
natural gas-related pollution, those aren’t in place yet.
</p>
<p>
<strong>5. The U.S. remains off its Paris Agreement track.</strong>
</p>
<p>
President Biden has pledged that the United States will cut its
emissions in half as compared to their all-time high by 2030. But with
six years left to meet that deadline, emissions are only 17.2% below
their high.
</p>
<p>
That means America must roughly triple its pace of pollution reductions
— cutting them by 6.9% each year — to meet its goal.
</p>
<p>
Although carbon pollution is likely to drop more quickly in the next few
years, especially as the Inflation Reduction Act and new Environmental
Protection Agency rules kick in, emissions cuts of that magnitude are
probably not feasible. That said, almost
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/11/08/climate/cop27-emissions-country-compare.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">no
other country</a> is on track to meet its Paris Agreement goals, either.
So at least there’s that.

Discusses Palestinian Authority Reforms in Abbas Talks</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>State Department — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken discussed
administrative reforms with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas during a
meeting Wednesday in the West Bank, along with efforts to boost
humanitarian aid to people in the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a statement that
Blinken “reaffirmed that the United States supports tangible steps
towards the creation of a Palestinian state alongside the State of
Israel, with both living in peace and security.”</p>
<p>Blinken also called for Israel to transfer all Palestinian tax
revenue it collects to the Palestinian authority in accordance with
existing agreements.</p>
<p>The Palestinian Authority governs part of the West Bank, while the
Hamas militant group has controlled the Gaza Strip where Israel is
fighting to eradicate the group.</p>
<p>The United States has envisioned a postwar roadmap that puts Gaza
under a Palestinian-led governance with no role for Hamas.</p>
<p>But some analysts are skeptical and play down the prospect.</p>
<p>“I don’t see how the Palestinian Authority will go back into Gaza and
assume any kind of meaningful control over what is left of Gaza. They’re
having a very hard time maintaining control, even in the West Bank,”
Khaled Elgindy, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, told VOA
Tuesday.</p>
<p>Blinken has stressed the potential for Israel to win acceptance from
Arab neighbors by seeking a path toward establishing a Palestinian state
as a means to resolve the longstanding conflict.</p>
<p>Netanyahu has firmly rejected the two-state solution.</p>
<p>Blinken said Tuesday that displaced Palestinians must be able to
return home as soon as conditions allow, and Israel has agreed to allow
a United Nations mission to evaluate the situation in war-ravaged
northern Gaza.</p>
<p>“As Israel’s campaign moves to a lower intensity phase in northern
Gaza and as the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] scales down its forces
there, we agreed today on a plan for the U.N. to carry out an assessment
mission. It will determine what needs to be done to allow displaced
Palestinians to return safely to homes in the north,” Blinken told
reporters during a Tuesday news conference in Tel Aviv.</p>
<p>The top diplomat also urged Israeli leaders to prevent further harm
to Palestinian civilians.</p>
<p>“The daily toll on civilians in Gaza, particularly on children, is
far too high,” he said.</p>
<p>International Court of Justice hearings</p>
<p>Later this week, the International Court of Justice will conduct
hearings on a case filed by South Africa accusing Israel of genocide
against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and seeking an emergency
suspension of its military campaign.</p>
<p>The United States believes the case is meritless and that it
distracts from Israel’s efforts to fight threats from Hamas militants
and other Iran proxies, including Hezbollah and the Houthis, according
to Blinken.</p>
<p>“We want this war to end as soon as possible,” he said. “But it’s
vital that Israel achieves its very legitimate objectives of ensuring
that October 7 can never happened again.”</p>
<p>Israeli President Isaac Herzog has rejected the genocide charge filed
at the International Court of Justice, calling the accusation “atrocious
and preposterous.”</p>
<p>Hostages held in Gaza</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Blinken held talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, President Herzog, Foreign Minister Israel Katz, and other
senior officials from Israel’s war Cabinet in Tel Aviv.</p>
<p>“The Secretary and Prime Minister discussed ongoing efforts to secure
the release of all remaining hostages and the importance of increasing
the level of humanitarian assistance reaching civilians in Gaza,”
according to a statement from the State Department.</p>
<p>“In this regard, the Secretary welcomed the appointment of Sigrid
Kaag as the UN’s Senior Humanitarian and Reconstruction Coordinator for
Gaza, pledging close cooperation with her in this new capacity,” the
statement added.</p>
<p>Blinken also met on Tuesday with the families of some of the hostages
held by Hamas militants in Gaza. And he relayed to Israeli leaders some
of what he heard from other leaders in the region during stops in
Turkey, Greece, Jordan, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi
Arabia.</p>
<p>Gaza health officials say more than 23,000 Palestinians, a large
percentage of them women and children, have been killed in Israel’s
military offensive in the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>Escalation in no one’s interest</p>
<p>After an Israeli airstrike killed a key Hezbollah commander in
southern Lebanon on Monday — the latest sign of a possibly widening
conflict in the Middle East — Blinken told reporters it is clearly not
in the interest of Israel, Lebanon or Hezbollah to see an escalation
outside Gaza.</p>
<p>Hezbollah has identified the commander as Wissam al-Tawil. Last week,
senior Hamas official Saleh al-Arouri was killed in a drone strike in
Beirut. Hamas and Hezbollah are both U.S. designated terrorist
organizations, and both are backed by Iran, whose militant allies in
Syria, Iraq and Yemen have been carrying out longer-range attacks
against Israel.</p>
<p>The United States has urged Israel to shift to smaller-scale military
operations in Gaza but has continued to support Israel in refusing Arab
demands for a cease-fire in the three-month war. Israel has vowed to
continue the war until it believes the threat of future Hamas attacks
has been eradicated and the militant group no longer controls Gaza, a
narrow strip of territory along the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
<p>Israel began its military campaign to wipe out Hamas after Hamas
fighters crossed into southern Israel on October 7. Israel said about
1,200 people were killed and about 240 captives taken in the terror
attack.</p>

Reuters, Agence France-Presse and The Associated Press.</p>

<h2 id="us-china-conclude-military-talks-in-washington">US, China
Conclude Military Talks in Washington</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The United States and China wrapped up two days of
military talks in Washington Tuesday, the Pentagon said, the latest
engagement since the two countries agreed to resume military-to-military
ties.</p>
<p>Washington and Beijing are at loggerheads over everything from the
future of democratically ruled Taiwan to territorial claims in the South
China Sea. Ties are still recovering after the U.S. downed an alleged
Chinese spy balloon in February.</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed late
last year to resume military ties, severed by Beijing after a visit in
August 2022 by then-House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi to
Taiwan.</p>
<p>The 17th round of the talks saw Michael Chase, the deputy assistant
secretary of defense for China, Taiwan, and Mongolia, meet China’s Major
General Song Yanchao, deputy director of the central military commission
office for international military co-operation, the Pentagon said.</p>
<p>“The two sides discussed U.S.-PRC defense relations, and Chase
highlighted the importance of maintaining open lines of
military-to-military communication in order to prevent competition from
veering into conflict,” the statement added, using an acronym for the
People’s Republic of China.</p>
<p>Pentagon officials say communication between the two militaries is
key to preventing a miscalculation from spiraling into conflict.</p>
<p>The top U.S. military officer, General Charles Q. Brown, the chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff held a virtual meeting last month with his
Chinese counterpart, General Liu Zhenli.</p>
<p>China is willing to develop healthy and stable military-to-military
relations with the U.S. “on the basis of equality and respect,” its
defense ministry said in a statement Wednesday, citing the meeting.</p>
<p>It urged the U.S. to cut military deployment and “provocative
actions” in the South China Sea, as well halt support for such actions
by “certain countries,” but did not identify them.</p>
<p>It asked the U.S. to abide by the one-China principle and stop arming
Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory, despite Taiwan’s strong
objections, and vowed never to compromise on the issue.</p>
<p>“The United States should fully understand the root causes of the
maritime and air security issues, strictly restrain its front-line
forces, and stop hyping up (the issues),” it added.</p>
<p>Taiwan is holding presidential and parliamentary polls this weekend
amid a ramped-up war of words between Taiwan and China.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>U.S. officials have cautioned that even with some restoration of
military communications, forging truly functional dialog between the two
sides could take time.</p>

<p>date: 2024-01-10, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog</p>
<p>On the docket today in front of three judges on the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the D.C. Circuit was the question of whether former
presidents can be prosecuted for things they did while in office. The
issue at hand is whether Trump can be tried for his attempt to overturn
the 2020 presidential election, but Trump has also been charged in three
other criminal cases: a national case over his mishandling of national
security documents, a state case in Georgia for interfering with the
2020 election there, and a state case in New York for paying hush money
to adult film actress Stormy Daniels. He is also facing a number of
civil cases.</p>

id="sec-chair-denies-bitcoin-etf-approved-says-x-account-was-hacked">SEC
Chair Denies Bitcoin ETF Approved, Says X Account Was Hacked</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>new york — The Securities and Exchange Commission said Tuesday that a
post sent from the agency’s account on the social platform X announcing
the approval of a long-awaited bitcoin exchange-traded fund was
“unauthorized,” and that the agency’s account was hacked. </p>
<p>The price of bitcoin briefly spiked more than $1,000 after the post
on X, formerly known as Twitter, claimed “The SEC grants approval for
#Bitcoin ETFs for listing on all registered national securities
exchanges.” Cryptocurrency investors had already driven bitcoin’s price
above $46,000 in anticipation of the approval. </p>
<p>An ETF would provide a way to invest in bitcoin without having to buy
the cryptocurrency outright on a crypto exchange such as Binance or
Coinbase. </p>
<p>But soon after the initial post appeared, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler
said on his personal account that the SEC’s account was compromised and,
“The SEC has not approved the listing and trading of spot bitcoin
exchange-traded products.” Gensler called the post unauthorized without
providing further explanation. </p>
<p>“Welp,” wrote Cory Klippsten, CEO of Swan Bitcoin, on X. Like many
bitcoin investors, Klippsten had been expecting the agency to approve
bitcoin ETFs potentially as soon as this week. </p>
<p>The price of bitcoin swung from about $46,730 to just below $48,000
after the unauthorized post hit, then dropped to around $45,200 after
the SEC’s denial. It was trading around $46,150 at 6:15 p.m. ET. </p>
<p>It was unclear how the SEC’s social media account was hacked. Shortly
after Gensler’s statement, it appeared that the SEC had gotten control
over the account. </p>
<p>Politicians, particularly Republicans who have long expressed
frustration at how Gensler operates the SEC, quickly expressed anger at
the SEC’s lax security controls over its accounts. </p>
<p>“Just like the SEC would demand accountability from a public company
if they made a colossal market-moving mistake, Congress needs answers on
what just happened,” said Senator Bill Hagerty, who sits on the Senate
Banking Committee. </p>
<p>This is not the first time there has been false market-moving
information about the future of bitcoin on regulated exchanges. A false
report in October implied that fund manager BlackRock had gotten
approval for bitcoin ETF, causing bitcoin prices to jump sharply. </p>
<p>Elon Musk gutted Twitter’s content moderation and security teams
after taking over the platform in late 2022. And while internet watchdog
groups have complained about a spike in toxic content, including
antisemitic and other hate speech on X, many also worry about account
integrity. </p>
<p>“The consequences of account takeovers could potentially be
significant, and especially during an election year,” said Brett Callow,
an analyst with the cybersecurity firm Emsisoft. </p>
<p>A spokesperson for X did not immediately respond to a request for
comment.</p>

Archive to shut down in three months</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>We’ve got some seriously bad news for the OS/2 community. Hobbes, the
massive software archive for OS/2 (and thus eComStation and ArcaOS),
which hosts both old software as well as more recent releases, is
shutting down in three months. After many years of service,
hobbes.nmsu.edu will be decommissioned and will no longer be available.
You the user are responsible for downloading any of the files found in
this archive if you want them. These files will no longer be available
for access or download as of the decommission date. As of April 15th,
2024 this site will no longer exist. No one will be able to access this
site or any information/files stored on this site as of April 15th,
2024. I don’t even know how old Hobbes is, but I feel like it’s been
around for decades. Seeing it being shut down is incredibly sad to read,
but also a sign of the times for whatever’s left of the OS/2 community.
Two of the four listed mirrors seem to be up, namely SunSITE Poland and
Infania Networks in Sweden. We’ll see how long those last, but my advice
to anyone interested in OS/2 – download the Hobbes archive and store it
locally.</p>

<p>It’s CES, and Google has made a number of disparate, small
announcements about upcoming Android features. 9To5Google has collected
them all, and it seems there’s not many things of interest here, nor are
there any big changes or improvements. The only thing that stands out to
me is that easy Bluetooth device pairing is coming to more scenarios.
First announced at CES 2022, Fast Pair support is rolling out to the
Chromecast with Google TV “in the next month.” This seamless Bluetooth
pairing with an onscreen “Connect now” prompt for headphones is coming
to “more Google TV devices later this year.” ↫ Abner Li for 9To5Google
Bluetooth pairing is an unpleasant experience, so seeing fast pairing
become more popular is good news.</p>

clues from nature: the impact of grass hay on suckling piglets’
gastrointestinal growth and colonic microbiota</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-10, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Introduction
</title>
<p>
The effect of dietary fiber on pig production has been extensively
evaluated. Inspired by observations of the diet of wild, young piglets,
this study aimed to examine the possibility of feeding grass hay to
suckling piglets besides concentrated creep feed.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
The sow-nursed piglets in this study were divided into two groups based
on balanced sow parities. The control group (CON, <italic>n</italic> = 7
sows) only received a regular, concentrated creep feed, while the
treatment piglets (GH, <italic>n</italic> = 8 sows) were also provided
with chopped grass hay from 2 days of age until weaning (28 days). At
weaning, one piglet with a median weight was selected from each litter
for post-mortem evaluation. Subsequently, six pigs around median weight
per sow were grouped into nursery pens and monitored for their feed
intake and body weight gain until 9 weeks of age.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results and discussion
</title>
<p>
Piglets in GH consumed, on average, 57 g of grass hay per piglet during
the entire lactation period. The emptied weight of the small and large
intestine was significantly greater in GH (280 vs. 228 g, 88.8 vs. 79.3
g, respectively, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), and the length of the
large intestine was stimulated by the grass hay (164 vs. 150 cm,
<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Morphologically, the villus height in the
jejunum was higher in GH (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). In the large
intestine, the crypt depth of the mid-colon was lower in GH. Moreover,
the short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) concentrations in the cecum were
increased in GH compared to CON (1,179 vs. 948 µmol/g dry matter,
<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), whereas in the colon, SCFA concentrations
were lower in CON (341 vs. 278 µmol/g dry matter, <italic>p</italic>
&lt; 0.05). There was no major impact of grass hay inclusion on the
colonic microbiota composition. Only a trend was observed for a lower
inverse of the classical Simpson (InvSimpon) index and a higher
abundance of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> genera in GH. After weaning,
no significant differences in feed intake and body weight gain were
observed. In conclusion, supplementing the grass hay to suckling piglets
led to alterations in intestinal morphology, increased SCFA fermentation
in proximal sections of large intestine, stimulation of gastrointestinal
tract growth, and subtle modifications in colonic microbiota.

vitro inhibition of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 biofilm formation by
DZ2002 through regulation of extracellular DNA and alginate
production</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-10, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Introduction
</title>
<p>
<italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (<italic>P. aeruginosa)</italic>
is a common pathogen associated with biofilm infections, which can lead
to persistent infections. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop
new anti-biofilm drugs. DZ2002 is a reversible inhibitor that targets
S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase and possesses anti-inflammatory and
immune-regulatory activities. However, its anti-biofilm activity has not
been reported yet.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods and results
</title>
<p>
Therefore, we investigated the effect of DZ2002 on <italic>P.
aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 biofilm formation by crystal violet staining
(CV), real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and
confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The results indicated that
although DZ2002 didn’t affect the growth of planktonic PAO1, it could
significantly inhibit the formation of mature biofilms. During the
inhibition of biofilm formation by DZ2002, there was a parallel decrease
in the synthesis of alginate and the expression level of alginate genes,
along with a weakening of swarming motility. However, these results were
unrelated to the expression of <italic>lasI, lasR, rhII, rhIR</italic>.
Additionally, we also found that after treatment with DZ2002, the
biofilms and extracellular DNA content of PAO1 were significantly
reduced. Molecular docking results further confirmed that DZ2002 had a
strong binding affinity with the active site of S-adenosylhomocysteine
hydrolase (SahH) of PAO1.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Discussion
</title>
<p>
In summary, our results indicated that DZ2002 may interact with SahH in
PAO1, inhibiting the formation of mature biofilms by downregulating
alginate synthesis, extracellular DNA production and swarming motility.
These findings demonstrate the potential value of DZ2002 in treating
biofilm infections associated with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>.

of OxyR regulator on oxidative stress, Apx toxin secretion and virulence
of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-10, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Introduction
</title>
<p>
<italic>Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae</italic>, the causative agent of
porcine pleuropneumonia, poses a significant threat to global swine
populations due to its high prevalence, mortality rates, and substantial
economic ramifications. Understanding the pathogen’s defense mechanisms
against host-produced reactive oxygen species is crucial for its
survival, with OxyR, a conserved bacterial transcription factor, being
pivotal in oxidative stress response.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
This study investigated the presence and role of OxyR in <italic>A.
pleuropneumoniae</italic> serovar 1-12 reference strains. Transcriptomic
analysis was conducted on an oxyR disruption mutant to delineate the
biological activities influenced by OxyR. Additionally, specific assays
were employed to assess urease activity, catalase expression, ApxI toxin
secretion, as well as adhesion and invasion abilities of the oxyR
disruption mutant on porcine 3D4/21 and PT cells. A mice challenge
experiment was also conducted to evaluate the impact of oxyR
inactivation on <italic>A. pleuropneumoniae</italic> virulence.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
OxyR was identified as a conserved regulator present in <italic>A.
pleuropneumoniae</italic> serovar 1-12 reference strains. Transcriptomic
analysis revealed the involvement of OxyR in multiple biological
activities. The oxyR disruption resulted in decreased urease activity,
elevated catalase expression, enhanced ApxI toxin secretion—attributed
to OxyR binding to the apxIBD promoter—and reduced adhesion and invasion
abilities on porcine cells. Furthermore, inactivation of oxyR reduced
the virulence of <italic>A. pleuropneumoniae</italic> in a mice
challenge experiment.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Discussion
</title>
<p>
The findings highlight the pivotal role of OxyR in influencing the
virulence mechanisms of <italic>A. pleuropneumoniae</italic>. The
observed effects on various biological activities underscore OxyR as an
essential factor contributing to the pathogenicity of this bacterium.

<title>
Background
</title>
<p>
PCV13 introduction in China has led to a significant reduction of
vaccine serotype <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>. However,
non-vaccine serotypes with highly resistance and invasiveness were often
reported in the post-pneumococcal conjugate vaccine era and there was
regional differences.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
A total of 669 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> strains were collected
from the respiratory tracts of hospitalized children at Shenzhen
Children’s Hospital in 2021 and 2022. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR)
characteristics were assessed through antibiotic susceptibility testing
performed with the VITEK 2 compact system. AMR genes and single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in pbp1a, pbp2b, and pbp2x were
identified via analysis of whole genome sequencing data. Statistical
examination of the data was conducted employing chi-square and Fisher’s
exact tests.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
We found that non-vaccine serotypes strains had accounted for 46.6% of
all the pneumococcal isolated strains. The most common non-vaccine
serotype is 23A, with a prevalence rate of 8.9%, followed by 15A (6.6%),
6E (5.7%), 34 (3.2%), and 15B (2.9%). The multidrug resistance rates
(MDR) of vaccine serotypes were 19F (99.36%), 19A (100%), 23F (98.08%),
6B (100%), and 6C (100%). Meanwhile, the MDR of non-vaccine serotypes
were 15B (100.00%), 6E (100%), 15C (100%), 34 (95.24%), and 23A
(98.31%). Resistance rates of 6E to more than six antibiotic classes
reached 89.47%, which is similar to 19F (83.33%) and 19A (90%). Unique
resistance profiles were also identified for non-vaccine serotypes,
including significantly higher resistance to chloramphenicol in 6E, 15B,
and 15C than in 19F and 19A. Furthermore, through genome sequencing, we
revealed strong correlation of <italic>cat-TC</italic> with
chloramphenicol resistance, <italic>patA/patB</italic> with tetracycline
resistance, <italic>ermB</italic> and <italic>pmrA</italic> with
erythromycin resistance.

Conclusion
</title>
<p>
The introduction of PCV13 into China from 2017 has led to a shift in the
dominant composition of pneumococcal strains. There has been a notable
rise and spread of multidrug-resistant non-vaccine serotypes among
children. Specifically, the non-vaccine serotype 6E, which was not
widely reported in China previously, has emerged. To comprehend the
resistance mechanisms, it is crucial to further investigate the
molecular and genetic characteristics of these non-vaccine serotypes.

report: Enhancing prognosis in severe COVID-19 through human herpes
virus coinfection treatment strategies</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-10, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Background
</title>
<p>
In the context of increasing reports of co-infection with coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19), particularly with human herpes viruses (HHVs),
it is important to consider the appropriate treatment options for HHVs
that have been reactivated by COVID-19.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Case presentation
</title>
<p>
This study presents two cases of severe COVID-19 with HHV co-infection.
The first case involved a critically ill patient with COVID-19
co-infected with herpes simplex virus type 1, confirmed using
metagenomic next-generation sequencing, and another patient with severe
COVID-19 experiencing Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation, as
evidenced by elevated EBV-DNA levels in the serum. Treatment included
high-dose glucocorticoids and sivelestat sodium, with notable
improvements observed after initiating ganciclovir anti-herpesvirus
therapy.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
This study underscores the significance of recognizing HHV co-infections
in severe COVID-19 cases and highlights the potential of combining
anti-HHV treatment, increased glucocorticoid dosages, and anti-cytokine
storm therapy to enhance prognosis.

maltophilia complex: insights into evolutionary relationships, global
distribution and pathogenicity</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-10, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Introduction
</title>
<p>
<italic>Stenotrophomonas maltophilia</italic> complex (Smc) comprises
opportunistic Gram-negative bacilli responsible for various nosocomial
infections. Limited data exists concerning its evolutionary lineage,
global prevalence and pathogenicity.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
We conducted an extensive genomic analysis on 734 Smc genomes, of which
90 were newly sequenced and isolated from different patients. The
species composition and evolutionary relationships of Smc were examined
using core protein sequence analysis. Pathogenicity evaluation was used
by assays for swimming motility, biofilm formation and identification of
virulence factors. The broth microdilution method was used to evaluate
the drug resistance spectrum of clinical isolates.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
Phylogenetic analyses delineated 24 species-level clades, dominated by
<italic>S. maltophilia</italic> (42.8%), <italic>S. sepilia</italic>
(13.6%) and <italic>S. geniculata</italic> (9.9%). Geographically,
strains were primarily distributed in Europe (34.2%), Asia (33.7%) and
North America (24.0%), with intricate global distribution patterns.
Meanwhile, 154 virulence-associated genes and 46 antimicrobial
resistance genes within Smc were identified. These genes encoded span
various functions, including motility, adherence, toxin, RND antibiotic
efflux pumps, beta-lactamases and aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes.
Moreover, significant variations were indicated in swimming motility and
biofilm-forming capability across the different species, with <italic>S.
sepilia</italic> exhibiting superior levels of both traits.
Additionally, no statistically significant discrepancy was detected
among Smc species to other antibiotics, despite the fact that all
<italic>S. geniculata</italic> isolates were resistant to Ceftazidime
and much higher than other species.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
Our findings indicate the need to pay increased attention to other
mainstream species of Smc besides <italic>S. maltophilia</italic> in
order to better manage Smc-related infections and tailor effective
treatment strategies.
