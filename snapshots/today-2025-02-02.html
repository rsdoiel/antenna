<p>
Part of the concept of ‘Disruption’ is that important new technologies
tend to be bad at the things that matter to the previous generation of
technology, but they do something else important instead. Asking if an
LLM can do very specific and precise information retrieval might be like
asking if an Apple II can match the uptime of a mainframe, or asking if
you can build Photoshop inside Netscape. No, they can’t really do that,
but that’s not the point and doesn’t mean they’re useless. They do
something else, and that ‘something else’ matters more and pulls in all
of the investment, innovation and company creation. Maybe, 20 years
later, they can do the old thing too - maybe you can run a bank on PCs
and build graphics software in a browser, eventually - but that’s not
what matters at the beginning. They unlock something else.
</p>
<p>
What is that ‘something else’ for generative AI, though? How do you
think conceptually about places where that error rate is a feature, not
a bug?

<h2 id="llm-anthropic">llm-anthropic</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-02, updated: 2025-02-02, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-anthropic">llm-anthropic</a></strong>
</p>
I’ve renamed my
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-claude-3">llm-claude-3</a> plugin
to <code>llm-anthropic</code>, on the basis that Claude 4 will probably
happen at some point so this is a better name for the plugin.
</p>
<p>
If you’re a previous user of <code>llm-claude-3</code> you can upgrade
to the new plugin like this:
</p>
<pre><code>llm install -U llm-claude-3
</code></pre>
<p>
This should remove the old plugin and install the new one, because the
latest <code>llm-claude-3</code> depends on <code>llm-anthropic</code>.
Just installing <code>llm-anthropic</code> may leave you with both
plugins installed at once.
</p>
<p>
There is one extra manual step you’ll need to take during this upgrade:
creating a new <code>anthropic</code> stored key with the same API token
you previously stored under <code>claude</code>. You can do that like
so:
</p>
<pre><code>llm keys set anthropic --value "$(llm keys get claude)"
</code></pre>
<p>
I released
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-anthropic/releases/tag/0.12">llm-anthropic
0.12</a> yesterday with new features not previously included in
<code>llm-claude-3</code>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
Support for Claude’s
<a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prefill-claudes-response">prefill</a>
feature, using the new <code>-o prefill ‘{’</code> option and the
accompanying <code>-o hide_prefill 1</code> option to prevent the
prefill from being included in the output text.
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-anthropic/issues/2">#2</a>
</li>
<li>
New <code>-o stop_sequences ‘```’</code> option for specifying one or
more stop sequences. To specify multiple stop sequences pass a JSON
array of strings :<code>-o stop_sequences ’[“end”, “stop”]</code>.
</li>
<li>
Model options are now documented in the README.
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
If you install or upgrade <code>llm-claude-3</code> you will now get
<code>llm-anthropic</code> instead, thanks to a tiny package on PyPI
which depends on the new plugin name. I created that with my
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/pypi-rename">pypi-rename</a>
cookiecutter template.
</p>
<p>
<p>Here’s the
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-claude-3/issues/31">issue for the
rename</a>. I archived the
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-claude-3">llm-claude-3 repository
on GitHub</a>, and got to use the brand new
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/30/pypi-now-supports-project-archival/">PyPI
archiving feature</a> to archive the
<a href="https://pypi.org/project/llm-claude-3/">llm-claude-3 project on
PyPI</a> as well.</p>

<h2 id="a-professional-workflow-for-translation-using-llms">A
professional workflow for translation using LLMs</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-02, updated: 2025-02-02, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42897856">A
professional workflow for translation using LLMs</a></strong>
</p>
Tom Gally is a <a href="https://gally.net/translation.html">professional
translator</a> who has been exploring the use of LLMs since the release
of GPT-4. In this Hacker News comment he shares a detailed workflow for
how he uses them to assist in that process.
</p>
<p>
Tom starts with the source text and custom instructions, including
context for how the translation will be used.
<a href="https://www.gally.net/temp/20250201sampletranslationprompt.html">Here’s
an imaginary example prompt</a>, which starts:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<code>The text below in Japanese is a product launch presentation for
Sony’s new gaming console, to be delivered by the CEO at Tokyo Game Show
2025. Please translate it into English. Your translation will be used in
the official press kit and live interpretation feed. When translating
this presentation, please follow these guidelines to create an accurate
and engaging English version that preserves both the meaning and energy
of the original: […]</code>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It then lists some tone, style and content guidelines custom to that
text.
</p>
<p>
Tom runs that prompt through several different LLMs and starts by
picking sentences and paragraphs from those that form a good basis for
the translation.
</p>
<p>
As he works on the full translation he uses Claude to help brainstorm
alternatives for tricky sentences:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
When I am unable to think of a good English version for a particular
sentence, I give the Japanese and English versions of the paragraph it
is contained in to an LLM (usually, these days, Claude) and ask for ten
suggestions for translations of the problematic sentence. Usually one or
two of the suggestions work fine; if not, I ask for ten more. (Using an
LLM as a sentence-level thesaurus on steroids is particularly
wonderful.)
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
He uses another LLM and prompt to check his translation against the
original and provide further suggestions, which he occasionally acts on.
Then as a final step he runs the finished document through a
text-to-speech engine to try and catch any “minor awkwardnesses” in the
result.
</p>
<p>
<p>I <em>love</em> this as an example of an expert using LLMs as tools
to help further elevate their work. I’d love to read more examples
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42897856">like this
one</a> from experts in other fields.</p>

<p>date: 2025-02-02, updated: 2025-02-02, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42899778#42900221">Hacker
News conversation on feature flags</a></strong>
</p>
I posted the following comment in a thread on Hacker News about feature
flags, in response to this article
<a href="https://code.mendhak.com/hardcode-feature-flags/">It’s OK to
hardcode feature flags</a>. This kicked off a <em>very</em> high quality
conversation on build-vs-buy and running feature flags at scale
involving a bunch of very experienced and knowledgeable people. I
recommend reading the comments.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The single biggest value add of feature flags is that they de-risk
deployment. They make it less frightening and difficult to turn features
on and off, which means you’ll do it more often. This means you can
build more confidently and learn faster from what you build. That’s
worth a lot.
</p>
<p>
I think there’s a reasonable middle ground-point between having feature
flags in a JSON file that you have to redeploy to change and using an
(often expensive) feature flags as a service platform: roll your own
simple system.
</p>
<p>
A relational database lookup against primary keys in a table with a
dozen records is effectively free. Heck, load the entire collection at
the start of each request - through a short lived cache if your
profiling says that would help.
</p>
<p>
Once you start getting more complicated (flags enabled for specific
users etc) you should consider build-vs-buy more seriously, but for the
most basic version you really can have no-deploy-changes at minimal cost
with minimal effort.
</p>
<p>
There are probably good open source libraries you can use here too,
though I haven’t gone looking for any in the last five years.

Basically any resource on a difficult subject—a colleague, Google, a
published paper—will be wrong or incomplete in various ways. Usefulness
isn’t only a matter of correctness.
</p>
<p>
For example, suppose a colleague has a question she thinks I might know
the answer to. Good news: I have some intuition and say something. Then
we realize it doesn’t quite make sense, and go back and forth until we
converge on something correct.
</p>
<p>
Such a conversation is full of BS but crucially we can interrogate it
and get something useful out of it in the end. Moreover this kind of
back and forth allows us to get to the key point in a way that might be
difficult when reading a difficult ~50-page paper.
</p>
<p>
To be clear o3-mini-high is orders of magnitude less useful for this
sort of thing than talking to an expert colleague. But still useful
along similar dimensions (and with a much broader knowledge base).

I’ve tried pixelfed 4 times now. 3 servers went away and my self hosted
one broke in an upgrade. I went to join a new instance and saw the
“login with mastodon” button. I used it, found 40+ accounts to import.
Did the import, and I’m looking at a blank new account. The mastodon
process did nothing.

This work for anyone else?

<p>We just had a GTK hackfest at FOSDEM. A good time for an update on
whats new and exciting in GTK, with an eye towards 4.18. Requirements
You can no longer call gdk_display_get_default() or gdk_display_open()
before gtk_init(). This was causing problems due to incomplete
initialization, so we made it fail with a (hopefully clear) error …

</ul>
<p>
Devine spent time improving the html5 Uxn emulator, and thanks to their
hard work it is now possible to play
<a href="https://hundredrabbits.itch.io/niju" target="_blank">Niju</a>,
<a href="https://hundredrabbits.itch.io/donsol" target="_blank">Donsol</a>,
and
<a href="https://hundredrabbits.itch.io/oquonie" target="_blank">Oquonie</a>
directly in the browser on itch.io, the same goes for projects like
<a href="https://hundredrabbits.itch.io/noodle" target="_blank">Noodle</a>
and
<a href="https://hundredrabbits.itch.io/tote" target="_blank">Tote</a>.
</p>
<p>
It’s been a long time coming, but
<a href='https://100r.co/site/oquonie.html' target='_blank'>Oquonie</a>
is now playable on &lt;a href=‘https://play.date/’’
target=’_blank’&gt;Playdate</a>. Rek spent the last week converting the
2-bit assets for Oquonie to 1-bit, because some of the characters and
tiles were too difficult to read, now all of the assets work perfectly
on monochromatic screens. As an amazing plus, Devine got the music and
sounds working perfectly, just like in the original iOS version.
</p>
<p>
From January 19-25th, we both participated in
<a href="https://www.tumblr.com/goblinweek" target="_blank">Goblin
Week</a>, an event in which you make goblins every day for a
week(whatever that means to you). See the goblin series made by

<a href="https://kokorobot.ca/site/goblins.html" target="_blank">here</a>
in higher rez also) and the one made by
<a href="https://merveilles.town/@neauoire/113858664512777630" target="_blank">Devine</a>(Mastodon).
</p>
<p>
Pino has earned
<a href="https://rabbits.srht.site/days/2025/01/23.html" target="_blank">two
new replacement solar panels</a> this month! We have not installed them
yet, it is still too cold outside in Victoria (we are expecting snow
this week).
</p>
<p>
We share photos often in our monthly updates, and so Devine spent time
building our very own
<a href="https://rabbits.srht.site/days/" target="_blank">custom photo
feed</a> named
<a href="https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/days" target="_blank">Days</a>. It
is possible to follow the feed with RSS.

<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Powers">Richard
Powers</a>’ <a
href="https://www.richardpowers.net/playground/">Playground</a> is a lot
of things, but for me it seemed to be very much a meditation on the
near-future (or perhaps present) of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model">Large Language
Models</a> like ChatGPT, and how they fit into our culture and politics.
I won’t give away any spoilers (it is worth a read!), but one moment in
the story has been stuck in my head, due to some things going on at
work, so I thought I’d make a note here to get it out of my head.
</p>
<p>
Near the end of the novel a group of people living on the island of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makatea">Makatea</a> are trying
to decide whether they want to accept a proposal from a consortium of
corporations to develop, and thus greatly transform, their island home.
Only 50 or so people live on the island, and they have decided to vote
on it.
</p>
<p>
In order to help the Makateans decide how to vote the consortium of
corporations provided the island’s inhabitants with exclusive access to
a 3rd generation Large Language Model called Profunda, which operates
much like ChatGPT does today. Users can engage with it in conversation
using their voice, and inquire about how the proposed development will
impact the island. Profunda has access to confidential materials related
to the consortium and its detailed plans. It was built on top of a
foundation model that was assembled from a massive harvest of content
from the World Wide Web.
</p>
<p>
In this short segment below some of the characters are discussing how to
vote based on the information they learned by “chatting” with Profunda:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“I don’t know how to vote. I don’t even know who this consortium is!
People always say, ‘Follow the money.’ I’m supposed to vote this up or
down, without even knowing who exactly is paying for this pilot program
or what they stand to gain by this . . . seasteading.”
</p>
<p>
Pockets of applause followed the comment, suggesting that the priest was
not the only one still at sea.
</p>
<p>
Manutahi Roa was baffled by the objection. He waved a dossier of
printouts in the air. “You should have asked Profunda. I did!”
</p>
<p>
“But how can I trust him?” the priest shouted back. “The consortium made
him!”
</p>
<p>
Neria Tepau, the postmistress, shot to her feet. “Exactly! We should
have been researching for ourselves, these last ten days. We have
phones. We have a cell tower. We can search every web page in the world.
Instead, we’re relying on this construction, this . . . thing to
spoon-feed us!”
</p>
<p>
“Neria!” Wen Lai’s objection sounded tired. “A search engine spoon-feeds
us, too.”
</p>
<p>
“So letting this thing do the work and making a biased summary is
somehow better than me going through the pages myself?”
</p>
<p>
Hone Amaru laughed. “This thing has read a hundred billion pages. How
many can you read, in ten days?”
</p>
<p>
“It’s the ten days that is the crime! We’re being railroaded!” The words
cracked in Puoro’s throat. Patrice put his arm around his partner’s
shoulders.
</p>
<p>
The Queen stood up and the room settled down. “People. Friends. Sisters.
Brothers. We’re letting the Popa’ā make us as crazy as they are!”
</p>
<p>
This observation was met by near-universal applause. Even the mayor
collected himself and clapped.
</p>
<p>
“It’s easy,” the Queen went on. “We ask who is paying. It tells us. And
then, as Madame Martin would say, we check its work” She looked to the
schoolteacher, who held both her thumbs high in the air. The assembly
broke into a new round of applause.
</p>
When the cheers settled, the mayor said, “Profunda. Please give us short
biographies for the five biggest investors in this seasteading
consortium.”
</blockquote>
<p>
This scene was striking to me, because The Queen’s statement seemed
kinda obvious, at least on the surface. How do we know if we can trust
generative AI? <em>We check its work.</em> Checking the work in this
case seems doable, I guess. They were asking who were the biggest
investors in the consortium. The assumption being that it was easy for
them to find sources to check for verification.
</p>
<p>
At some level, triangulating fact claims, and reproducibility are how
knowledge is built. But it requires work. It takes time. It can
sometimes require specialized expertise. As Generative AI tools get used
to accelerate “knowledge” generation the need to verify accelerates as
well. This is why we need to be thoughtful and <em>slow down</em> when
integrating these tools into our existing knowledge systems…if they are
integrated at all. It is a choice after all. Just because a generative
AI tool is offering you citations to back up its assertions does not
mean the citations refer to actual documents, or if the documents exist,
that the they back up the claims that are being made <span

Is it realistic for us to be checking the work of these systems?
Wouldn’t it be better if it was the other way around?
</p>

I’m reminded of the nudges my Subaru Outback will give me if I begin to
stray out of my lane. These nudges gently move the car back into the
lane, and prompt me to make additional corrections. They get me to pay
better attention. But the automated system doesn’t take full control of
the car. Subaru’s <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lane_departure_warning_system#Lane_keeping_and_next_technologies">lane
keeping</a> system is no doubt a machine learning model that has been
trained on many hour of driving video. But the complete system is
oriented around helping (not replacing) drivers, and reducing car
accidents, rather than trying to create a fully automated self driving
car. I’m always struck by how gentle, collaborative and helpful these
nudges are, and I can’t help but wonder what an equivalent would look
like in information seeking behavior, where rather than generating
complete answers to questions, or posing as an intelligent conversation
partner, the system collaborates <em>with</em> us.

At work we’ve been looking to integrate OpenAI’s <a
href="https://openai.com/index/whisper/">Whisper</a> into our
institutional repository, so that we can generate transcripts for video
and audio that lack them. There were some routine technical difficulties
involving <a
href="https://github.com/sul-dlss/speech-to-text#readme">integrating</a>
on-premises software with on-demand services in the cloud, where we
could have access to compute resources with GPUs. But from my
perspective it seemed that the primary problems we ran into were policy
questions around what types of review and correction needed to happen to
the generated transcripts, and how to make these checks part of our
workflow. This is all still a work in progress, but one small experiment
I got to try was helping to visualize the <em>confidence level</em> that
Whisper reports for words in its transcript:

<p>
<a
href="https://github.com/edsu/whisper-transcript/">whisper-transcript</a>
is a tiny piece of software, a Web Component you can drop into any web
page using Whisper’s JSON output (a demo is running <a
href="https://edsu.github.io/whisper-transcript/">here</a>). It’s
clearly not a complete system for correcting the transcript, but simply
a way of listening to the media, while seeing the transcription, and the
models confidence about its transcription. I’m mentioning it here
because it felt like a clumsy attempt at providing these kinds of nudges
to someone reviewing the transcript.
</p>
<p>
A novel, a car and a transcript make for a kind of unruly trio. This
post was just me expressing my hope that we see a move towards
specialized computer assisted interfaces that don’t create more work for
us, and that the promises of automated systems that replace people get
left behind in the dust (again).

PS. Powers’ <a
href="https://www.richardpowers.net/playground/">book</a>, like the
others I’ve read, is beautifully written. The life stories of his
characters really stick with you, and the descriptions of the ocean and
the natural world will transport you in the best way possible.
