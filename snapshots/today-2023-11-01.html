Think I’ve decided for sure that I’m sitting out NaNoWriMo this year,
but I have translated three more chapters of “Salute, Jonathan!” into
Ido over the past couple of days, after a long break. It’s nice to find
something I can focus on without difficulty for an extended period –
recently my brain’s been all over the place 😅 And it’s
writing-adjacent, too.
</p>
<p>
I also watched the last four eps of the 1964 Doctor Who serial “Marco
Polo” today. Some “of the time” iffiness imo but overall such a great
serial! Marco Polo makes for a great sympathetic antagonist and Tegana
works well as a more out-and-out (but sneaky) antagonist. Impressive
that it’s seven episodes long but doesn’t drag. It’s also refreshing
how, in many of these early stories, the team’s goal is just to get back
to (or repair) the TARDIS, and the adventures just kinda happen on the
way.

id="thousands-of-afghans-seek-asylum-in-us-congress-yet-to-pass-adjustment-act">Thousands
of Afghans Seek Asylum in US, Congress Yet to Pass Adjustment Act</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The number of Afghans seeking asylum in the United States has jumped
to 19,000 over the past two years, marking a sharp contrast to the
annual double- and triple-digit figures previously reported by the U.S.
Citizenship and Immigration Services.</p>
<p>From 2013 to 2021, the United States granted asylum to fewer than
1,000 Afghans in total.</p>
<p>The sharp rise in the number of Afghan asylum-seekers is directly
linked to the evacuation by the U.S. military of more than 124,000
individuals, mostly Afghan nationals, from Kabul International Airport
in August 2021. </p>
<p>After undergoing initial security and health screenings at U.S.
military bases in Qatar, Germany and other countries, the Afghan
evacuees subsequently entered the United States under a status known as
humanitarian parole.</p>
<p>In May 2022, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which oversees
USCIS, announced Temporary Protected Status registration for 72,500
Afghans, allowing them to work and live in the country until Nov. 20,
2023.</p>
<p>Last month, Homeland Security said it is extending the program until
May 2025 to cover previous and newly eligible individuals.</p>
<p>“The extension and redesignation of Afghanistan for TPS allows an
estimated 17,700 individuals to be granted TPS, if they apply for TPS
and are found eligible. This includes approximately 3,100 existing
beneficiaries currently receiving TPS benefits under Afghanistan’s
previous designation, plus an estimated 14,600 newly potentially
eligible individuals,” a USCIS spokesperson told VOA by email.</p>
<p>Congress has yet to approve the Afghan Adjustment Act, which would
create legal pathways for Afghans who entered the United States in 2021
under humanitarian parole and are seeking permanent residence and
naturalization.</p>
<p>“The administration has repeatedly put forward an adjustment act and
publicly called on Congress to support a bipartisan adjustment act that
would provide a durable, more streamlined immigration pathway for those
currently in parole,” the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>While dozens of Democratic and Republican lawmakers have publicly
supported the Afghan Adjustment Act, others have voiced concerns about
poor security vetting of the individuals who were airlifted from Kabul
amid a chaotic withdrawal operation.</p>
<p>Asylum challenges</p>
<p>Amid uncertainty about when and whether Congress will approve the
legislation, Homeland Security has encouraged Afghans in temporary
protected and parole statuses to apply for asylum, without offering
assurances that their cases will be approved.</p>
<p>Critics say the U.S. asylum system is already overwhelmed with
applications, and the addition of thousands of Afghan applicants will
further strain it.</p>
<p>“Our immigration court system has a massive backlog [of] hundreds of
thousands of cases, and many of which are asylum cases,” Laurence
Benenson, vice president of policy and advocacy at the National
Immigration Forum, told VOA. Benenson said adjudicating asylum cases
takes up to five years.</p>
<p>Last year, 1,438 Afghans were granted asylum by the USCIS, a
significant increase compared with 96 individuals in 2021 and only 37 in
2020.</p>
<p>In the rush to leave Afghanistan, some evacuees may have failed to
take with them the appropriate documents to support their asylum
petitions, which Benenson said “makes it much harder to pursue their
claims.”</p>
<p>Three Afghan asylum-seekers interviewed for this story said their
applications have been pending at USCIS for over a year.</p>
<p>“I don’t know how long we will remain in this limbo, but the
uncertainty pains every day,” said Qais Ahmad, who left Kabul on a U.S.
military flight in August 2021 and entered the U.S. in December 2021
with his wife and four children.</p>
<p>It is unclear how the Afghan Adjustment Act, if approved by Congress,
would handle the thousands of Afghans with pending asylum cases.</p>
<p>“It remains to be seen, is the answer,” said Daniel Salazar, a policy
analyst at the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants.</p>
<p>“There are different groups of Afghan nationals who will be affected
by the AAA in a variety of ways, but we won’t really know that until
federal agencies are actively implementing it,” Salazar told VOA.</p>
<p>Until Congress enacts the Afghan Adjustment Act, the many thousands
of Afghans who fall outside the requirements for a Special Immigration
Visa — a program that facilitates easy and swift residence for
individuals who worked for the U.S. military and programs in Iraq and
Afghanistan — will have to undergo the lengthy and cumbersome asylum
system.</p>

House Republicans’ Israel-only Aid Bill Opposed in Senate, by Biden</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. senators from both parties voiced doubts on Tuesday about House
Republicans’ plan to provide $14.3 billion in aid to Israel by cutting
Internal Revenue Service funding, without providing aid to Ukraine, and
Democratic President Joe Biden threatened to veto the bill were it to
pass.</p>
<p>In the first major legislative action under new Speaker Mike Johnson,
House of Representatives Republicans unveiled a standalone supplemental
spending bill only for Israel on Monday.</p>
<p>This is despite President Joe Biden’s request for a $106 billion
package that would include aid for Israel and Ukraine and funding to
boost competition with China in the Indo-Pacific as well as security
along the U.S. border with Mexico.</p>
<p>Republicans have a 221-212 majority in the House, but Biden’s fellow
Democrats control the Senate 51-49. To become law, the bill would have
to pass both the House and Senate and be signed by Biden.</p>
<p>The top Senate Democrat said the Republican bill would be dead on
arrival in the upper chamber, even if it passed the House.</p>
<p>“The bottom line is it’s not a serious proposal,” Senate Democratic
Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters.</p>
<p>The administration said Biden would veto such a bill were it to reach
his desk.</p>
<p>“This bill is bad for Israel, for the Middle East region, and for our
own national security,” the White House’s Office of Management and
Budget said.</p>
<p>Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate, said he
felt the four issues needed to be addressed.</p>
<p>“We need to treat all four of these areas, all four of them: Ukraine,
Israel, Taiwan and the border,” McConnell told reporters.</p>
<p>Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Johnson on Tuesday after
testifying in the Senate. At the hearing, Blinken and Secretary of
Defense Lloyd Austin said Ukraine needed continued U.S. assistance to
win its fight against Russian invaders.</p>
<p>Blinken told reporters: “It was a very good meeting. I appreciate the
opportunity. I’ll leave our conversation at that.”</p>
<p>State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said they had discussed
issues including Biden’s request for support for Ukraine and Israel.</p>
<p>Republicans are expected to pass the legislation in the House as soon
as this week.</p>

<h2 id="blinken-to-head-for-israel-elsewhere-in-region">Blinken to Head
for Israel, Elsewhere in Region</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will begin a new trip to the
Middle East on Friday, a spokesperson said, as Israel’s war against
Hamas in response to the Oct. 7 attack intensifies.</p>
<p>“Secretary Blinken will travel to Israel on Friday for meetings with
members of the Israeli government, and then will make other stops in the
region,” State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters
Tuesday.</p>
<p>Israeli media had previously reported the visit, citing Israeli
officials.</p>
<p>Days after the surprise attack by Hamas militants, Blinken traveled
to Israel as a show of U.S. support and to coordinate on a response.</p>
<p>A marathon session of shuttle diplomacy in the region ensued, with
the U.S. diplomat making over a dozen stops in Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the
UAE, Egypt and back in Israel.</p>
<p>He accompanied President Joe Biden to meetings with Israeli
government officials and victims during the U.S. leader’s one-day visit
to Tel Aviv on Oct. 18.</p>
<p>The surprise cross-border attack by Hamas militants killed more than
1,400 people according to Israeli officials, while more than 230 people,
some American citizens, were taken hostage.</p>
<p>Israel’s retaliatory bombardment has killed more than 8,500 people,
according to the Gaza health ministry, sparking widespread anger in the
region and around the world.</p>
<p>The United States is Israel’s biggest supporter, providing it with
substantial military aid.</p>
<p>Biden has requested Congress to pass additional funding for Israel as
well as Ukraine.</p>
<p>Blinken on Tuesday was at the U.S. Capitol to defend the funding
request, but the Senate hearing was repeatedly interrupted by
pro-Palestinian protesters, some of whom cried out “cease-fire now,”
“Palestinians are not animals” and “Shame on you all” before being
removed from the room.</p>
<p>During the hearing Blinken also discussed what might come after the
current conflict, saying the Palestinian Authority should retake control
of the Gaza Strip from Hamas, which has ruled the territory since
2007.</p>

Faces Competing Pressure from Arab, Muslim and Jewish Voters on War in
Gaza</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>President Joe Biden is facing internal revolt from some members of
his Democratic Party over his unwavering support for Israel as it
expands ground operations in Gaza and Palestinian civilian casualties
increase.</p>
<p>The National Muslim Democratic Council (NMDC) sent an open letter
demanding that Biden use his influence with Israel to broker a
cease-fire by 5 p.m. Tuesday. Without a cease-fire, the advocacy group
threatened to mobilize millions of Muslim voters to withhold donations
and votes toward Biden’s 2024 reelection campaign.</p>
<p>NMDC includes party leaders from hotly contested states likely to
decide the election, such as Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>“We know for a fact that our community will make a difference in the
battleground states,” said council chair Basim Elkarra to VOA.
“Democratic Party leaders are paying attention, and they are afraid of
what’s happening, and they are sending messages to the White House that
this is going to hurt our chances in 2024.”</p>
<p>Administration officials have advocated for “humanitarian pauses” to
allow aid to reach civilians in Gaza but say a cease-fire now will only
benefit Hamas.</p>
<p>Nearly 1.1 million Muslim voters cast ballots in the 2020 election,
turning out in numbers large enough to swing the presidential race in
key battleground states. Muslim Americans and Arab Americans have
traditionally voted for Democratic candidates, but with thousands of
Palestinians killed in Israeli retaliatory airstrikes and ground
operations in Gaza, a shift may be coming.</p>
<p>A new poll released Tuesday by the Arab American Institute showed
support for Biden has dropped among Arab American voters, from 59% in
the 2020 election to 17% ahead of 2024.</p>
<p>According to the poll, two-thirds of Arab Americans have a negative
view of Biden’s handling of the Israeli-Hamas war. The majority believe
the U.S. should not send weapons and military equipment to Israel and
should call for a cease-fire.</p>
<p>White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the White House
will continue to engage with the Arab American and Muslim community.</p>
<p>“We certainly want to continue to keep those lines of communication
open,” she told VOA during her briefing Tuesday.</p>
<p>However, while the White House provided an extensive readout of
Biden’s Oct. 11 meeting with Jewish leaders, they did not announce the
president’s meeting with Muslim leaders on Oct. 25.</p>
<p>An administration official told VOA that not every participant wanted
this meeting to be made public, an assessment disputed by three Muslim
community leaders with direct knowledge of the meeting. The leaders, who
spoke with VOA and asked not to be identified, said that it was the
White House that made confidentiality a requirement of the meeting.</p>
<p>Jewish voters ‘deeply appreciative’</p>
<p>In contrast, Jewish Americans are “deeply appreciative” of Biden’s
full-throated support of Israel, said Halie Soifer, who leads the Jewish
Democratic Council of America. About 41% of Jews worldwide - about 7
million people - live in the U.S., according to Pew Research, the same
number as in Israel.</p>
<p>Jews make up 2% of the U.S. population but about 3% of the
electorate. In the 2020 election, the total number of eligible voters
was 158.4 million, according to a Pew Research tabulation.</p>
<p>“The turnout for Jewish voters is on average 10% higher than the
average American voter, in some states we’ve seen as high as 15% to 20%
higher depending on the election,” Sofier told VOA, adding that Jewish
voters tend to live in swing districts or states.</p>
<p>Biden is also widely praised in Israel, where his words and actions,
including his brief wartime visit to Tel Aviv, made Israelis feel they
are not alone, said Jonathan Rynhold, head of the Department of
Political Studies at Bar-Ilan University.</p>
<p>Even those who were extremely critical of Biden and more sympathetic
to former President Donald Trump, have publicly said, “I was wrong. This
guy is a true friend of Israel,” Rynhold told VOA.</p>
<p>Since the Hamas attack, Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu have been in close communication, with Biden urging Netanyahu
to conduct the offensive against Hamas in Gaza “in a manner consistent
with international humanitarian law that prioritizes the protection of
civilians,” the White House said Sunday, following the Israeli
military’s expansion of its ground operations into Gaza late Friday.</p>
<p>“What he’s saying to Israel – to help me to help you,” Rynhold said.
“If you give maximum effort to fight in the right way, according to the
laws of war, then it makes it easier for me to support you, and get
support for you in the international community, and home in America and
in the Democratic Party.”</p>
<p>There’s growing pressure worldwide for a humanitarian cease-fire as
casualties mount.</p>
<p>More than 8,000 Palestinians, including at least 3,300 children, have
been killed in Israeli retaliatory attacks, according to the Hamas-run
health ministry in Gaza.</p>
<p>The Oct. 7 attack by Hamas, which the U.S. and EU have designated a
terrorist group, killed at least 1,400 people in Israel and took more
than 200 hostages. The militant group that controls the Gaza Strip cited
Israel’s decadeslong occupation of the West Bank among its motivations
for attacking Israeli civilians and soldiers.</p>
<p>Republican support</p>
<p>Support for Israel is also strong among Republicans. Rejecting
Biden’s call for a $106 billion international aid package with funding
for Ukraine, Israel and other needs, newly elected House Speaker Mike
Johnson, a Republican, has put forward a $14.3 billion package that only
includes money for Israel.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Trump, the leading contender for his party’s 2024
presidential nomination, faced an intense backlash over his criticism of
Netanyahu just days after the Hamas attack. He said Netanyahu was
unprepared and described Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group backing
Hamas, as “very smart.”</p>
<p>At the Republican Jewish Coalition leadership summit over the
weekend, Trump returned his focus on Biden.</p>
<p>“Four straight years, I kept America safe. I kept Israel safe, and I
kept the world safe,” he said at the gathering of influential Republican
donors. “If I were president, the attack on Israel would never, ever
have happened.”</p>
<p>Trump’s argument is unlikely to change voters’ perception of Biden’s
handling of the war, said Norman Ornstein, senior fellow emeritus at the
American Enterprise Institute.</p>
<p>“There isn’t a lot of room for Republicans here, whether it’s Trump
or the Republicans in Congress to outflank Biden on support for Israel,”
he told VOA.</p>
<p>While foreign policy is not usually a key driver of the American
electorate unless U.S. troops are deployed, the war in Gaza has elicited
highly emotional responses from Americans. Demonstrations both for and
against Israel have spread in various cities, while incidents of
antisemitism and Islamophobia are on the rise.</p>
<p>Overall, a majority of voters – 84% Republicans, 76% Democrats and
74% independents – think supporting Israel is in the national interest
of the United States, according to an Oct. 17 Quinnipiac University
national poll of registered voters. Most voters – 79% Republicans, 59%
Democrats, 61% independents – approve of sending weapons and military
equipment to Israel.</p>
<p>An overwhelming majority of voters (85%) are concerned that the
conflict will escalate into a wider war in the Middle East.</p>

software</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-01, from: OS News</p>
<p>In a world where constant change is the norm, finished software
provides a breath of fresh air. It’s a reminder that reliability,
consistency, and user satisfaction can coexist in the realm of software
development. So the next time you find yourself yearning for the latest
update, remember that sometimes, the best software is the one that
doesn’t change at all. While this is a nice sentiment, the reality is
that software has become so complex, competition to cutthroat, and
operating systems so changeful, that “finishing” software just doesn’t
seem like a realistic and attainable goal anymore. The example used in
the article, WordStar 4.0 for DOS, can only be “finished” because DOS
doesn’t change anymore.</p>

<h2 id="pentagon-27-attacks-target-us-forces-in-iraq-syria">Pentagon: 27
Attacks Target US Forces in Iraq, Syria</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria have been attacked with drones or
rockets at least 27 times in recent days, as more U.S. forces deploy to
the region, Pentagon press secretary Brigadier General Pat Ryder said
Tuesday.</p>
<p>At least seven of these attacks were launched after U.S. forces in
the early morning hours of Friday struck two facilities in eastern Syria
used by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and affiliated
groups.</p>
<p>The U.S. strikes were in response to earlier attacks on U.S. forces
and were “narrowly tailored … to protect and defend U.S. personnel in
Iraq and Syria,” Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said in a
statement.</p>
<p>None of the attacks carried out since the U.S. retaliatory strikes on
Friday has caused casualties or damage, according to defense
officials.</p>
<p>The latest attack occurred Monday and used multiple one-way attack
drones to target al-Asad Air Base in western Iraq, said a defense
official who spoke to VOA on condition of anonymity due to security
sensitivities.</p>
<p>Multiple rockets were used in another attack on al-Asad on Monday,
and rockets targeted U.S. and coalition forces at two locations in
eastern Syria as well, one at a base known as Green Village and another
at Mission Support Site Euphrates.</p>
<p>On Sunday, a one-way attack drone was used against U.S. forces at a
base near al-Shaddadi, according to U.S. officials.</p>
<p>Ryder said the Pentagon was deploying 300 more troops to the Middle
East region “to support regional deterrence efforts and further bolster
U.S. force protection capabilities.”</p>
<p>“They aren’t going to Israel,” Ryder said.</p>
<p>Ryder and other officials have blamed Iranian-backed proxies for the
near daily attacks on U.S. forces.</p>
<p>“We know that these are Iranian-backed militia groups that are
supported by Iran and, of course, we hold Iran responsible for these
groups,” Ryder said last week.</p>
<p>Austin told members of Congress on Tuesday that the United States
maintains the right to respond at a time and place it chooses.</p>
<p>“If this doesn’t stop, then we will respond.” Austin said.</p>
<p>Asked by VOA whether the recent attacks are a sign that U.S.
deterrence is not working, a senior defense official said earlier this
week that “Iran’s objective for a long time has been to force a
withdrawal of the U.S. military from the region. What I would observe is
that we’re still there.”</p>
<p>US strikes back in Syria</p>
<p>One American F-15 and two American F-16 fighter jets used precision
munitions against a weapons storage facility and an ammunition facility
near Abu Kamal early Friday local time, according to defense officials.
The Pentagon assesses the strikes successfully hit their targets, and it
is still looking into casualty numbers.</p>
<p>“These precision self-defense strikes are a response to a series of
ongoing and mostly unsuccessful attacks against U.S. personnel in Iraq
and Syria by Iranian-backed militia groups that began on Oct. 17,”
Austin said in a statement. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“The United States will not tolerate such attacks and will defend
itself, its personnel, and its interests,” he added.</p>
<p>Officials have raised concerns about the prospect of “more
significant escalation” in the region from Iranian proxy groups. </p>
<p>“Spillover into Syria is not just a risk; it has already begun,” Geir
Pedersen, U.N. special envoy for Syria, said on Monday.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The attacks since Oct. 17 on U.S. and coalition forces have resulted
in 17 minor injuries to Americans in Syria and four minor injuries to
American personnel in Iraq, with U.S. officials continuing to monitor
any potential traumatic brain injuries. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>One U.S. contractor at al-Asad Air Base in Iraq suffered a cardiac
episode while sheltering in place during a false alarm for an air attack
and died. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>At least 20 attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria occurred between
Oct. 17 and Oct. 26, according to the Pentagon.</p>
<p>US increasing protection in region</p>
<p>Approximately 1,200 troops have either deployed or are in the process
of deploying from the United States to the Middle East to increase force
protection. These units include a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense,
or THAAD, battery from Fort Bliss, Patriot batteries from Fort Sill, and
Patriot and Avenger batteries from Fort Liberty.</p>
<p>Austin placed more than 2,000 military personnel on heightened alert
earlier this month with a prepare-to-deploy order.</p>

Nations.</p>

id="hamas-attack-galvanizing-terror-groups-worldwide-warn-us-officials">Hamas
Attack Galvanizing Terror Groups Worldwide, Warn US Officials</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The Hamas terror attack on Israel that killed about 1,400 people,
mostly civilians, and sparked a now weeks-long war has shaken the global
terrorism landscape, breathing new life into a variety of groups,
according to three top U.S. officials.</p>
<p>Those terror groups — including al-Qaida and the Islamic State — are
using the attack, the imagery associated with it, and Israel’s response
as a rallying cry designed to grow their numbers and possibly inspire
attacks against the United States, said the officials.</p>
<p>FBI Director Christopher Wray, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro
Mayorkas, and National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) Director Christine
Abizaid shared the assessment Tuesday during testimony before a U.S.
Senate oversight committee, warning the Hamas attack on Israel is giving
foreign terror groups a sense of momentum at a time when the threat had
seemed to be waning.</p>
<p>“The ongoing war in the Middle East has raised the threat of an
attack against Americans in the United States to a whole ’nother level,”
the FBI’s Wray told the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs
Committee.</p>
<p>“We assess that the actions of Hamas and its allies will serve as an
inspiration the likes of which we haven’t seen since ISIS launched its
so-called caliphate several years ago,” Wray said, using an acronym for
the Islamic State group.</p>
<p>“In just the past few weeks, multiple foreign terrorist organizations
have called for attacks against Americans and the West,” he added,
noting al-Qaida “issued its most specific call to attack the United
States in the last five years.”</p>
<p>The NCTC’s Abizaid warned lawmakers the Hamas attack is now being
used as “a feature of messaging and propaganda” from multiple terror
organizations.</p>
<p>“We’ve seen it from al-Qaida affiliates, almost every single one.
We’ve also seen it from ISIS, which ideologically isn’t aligned with a
group like Hamas, but is still leveraging this current conflict,” she
said. “They are seeking to capitalize on this moment to galvanize
supporters and organize further attacks.”</p>
<p>Extremists see opportunity, say officials</p>
<p>Wray and Abizaid warned that the Hamas attack is also being leveraged
by extremist groups without ties to the Middle East but who see this as
a chance to further their own goals, while likewise threatening attacks
against U.S., Israeli and Jewish interests around the world.</p>
<p>“How this conflict unfolds in the coming days, weeks and months, and
the degree to which it helps renew otherwise declining terrorist actors
across the globe will require careful monitoring,” Abizaid said.</p>
<p>Just last week, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued an
advisory warning of a surge in threats to the Jewish, Arab and Muslim
communities in the U.S. Targeted incidents ranged from bomb scares to
the stabbing of a 6-year-old Palestinian American boy in Illinois.</p>
<p>For now, the U.S. officials emphasized that the greatest dangers
still come from individuals or small groups who are consuming the
imagery and propaganda and may then quickly escalate to violence.</p>
<p>And while the DHS, the FBI and NCTC have yet to see indications that
any established groups are plotting attacks on U.S. soil, they do not
rule it out.</p>
<p>“On top of the homegrown violent extremism and domestic violent
extremist threat, we also cannot and do not discount the possibility
that Hamas or another foreign terrorist organization may exploit the
current conflict to conduct attacks here on our own soil,” the FBI’s
Wray said.</p>
<p>“We’re continuing to scrutinize our intelligence to assess how the
threat may be evolving,” he said, adding that the bureau is conducting
multiple investigations into individuals associated with Hamas and other
groups.</p>
<p>U.S. keeps eye on Iran</p>
<p>There is also significant suspicion about one of Hamas’ key backers,
Iran, described by some U.S. officials as the “poster child” for
state-sponsored terrorism.</p>
<p>U.S. officials have previously accused Iran of what they describe as
brazen plots to target dissidents and assassinate former U.S. national
security adviser Ambassador John Bolton.</p>
<p>But since the October 7 Hamas attack in Israel, Tehran’s plotting in
the United States appears to have quieted.</p>
<p>“At this current moment I would not have any indication of an Iranian
threat inside the United States that should be a concern,” the NCTC’s
Abizaid told lawmakers.</p>
<p>In the Middle East and elsewhere, though, Iran has been bolder, she
said, taking note of the repeated attacks by Iranian-backed militias on
U.S. forces.</p>
<p>“We assess Iran, Hezbollah and their linked proxies are trying to
calibrate their activity, avoiding actions that would open up a
concerted second front with the United States or Israel while still
exacting costs in the midst of the current conflict,” Abizaid said.</p>
<p>“This is a very fine line to walk,” she added. “Their actions carry
the potential for miscalculation.”</p>
<p>And even in the U.S., Iran’s approach could change quickly.</p>
<p>“Iran has a significant escalatory capability,” warned Abizaid.</p>
<p>Iran’s mission to the United Nations has yet to respond to a request

Court Denies RFE/RL Journalist’s Pretrial Detention Appeal</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A Russian court on Tuesday denied the appeal filed by Radio Free
Europe/Radio Liberty journalist Alsu Kurmasheva against her pretrial
detention on charges of failing to register as a foreign agent.     </p>
<p>Kurmahseva’s lawyer had requested pretrial restrictions for the
journalist other than placement in pretrial detention, but the Supreme
Court of Russia’s Republic of Tatarstan denied the appeal. Last week, a
district court ordered her to be held in pretrial detention until at
least December 5.  </p>
<p>Kurmasheva participated in Tuesday’s closed-door hearing via video
link from a detention center in Kazan, Tatarstan’s capital. The
Prague-based journalist faces up to five years in prison for violating
the country’s “foreign agent” law, which Moscow typically uses to target
critical journalists and activists.  </p>
<p>Kurmasheva and RFE/RL deny the charges against her.  </p>
<p>A dual U.S.-Russian national who works with RFE/RL’s Tatar-Bashkir
Service, Kurmasheva traveled to Russia in May for a family emergency.
Her passports were confiscated when she tried to leave the country in
June.    </p>
<p>She was waiting for her passports to be returned when she was
detained on October 18.  </p>
<p>Jeffrey Gedmin, acting president of VOA’s sister outlet RFE/RL, has
condemned Kurmasheva’s arrest as politically motivated and retaliation
over her work.  </p>
<p>“Journalism is not a crime. She must be released to her family
immediately,” Gedmin said. </p>
<p>The Russian Embassy in Washington did not immediately reply to VOA’s
email requesting comment.    </p>
<p>Kurmasheva is the second American journalist to be jailed in Russia
this year.  </p>
<p>Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich has been held in a
Moscow prison since March on espionage charges that he, his employer and
the U.S. government deny.  </p>
<p>Human rights and press freedom groups and U.S. officials have widely
called for Kurmasheva and Gershkovich to be immediately released.</p>

and RISC-V: what you need to know to be ready</h2>
<p>date: 2023-10-31, from: OS News</p>
<p>Support for RISC-V in Android is taking another step forward. The
latest update that we have is that now not only are we accepting
patches, but we have begun to mature support for RISC-V in Android.
RISC-V is a modular ISA, meaning that there are a large number of
optional extensions. We have also determined an initial set that we feel
is critical to ensure that any CPU running RISC-V will have all of the
features we expect to achieve high performance. This set includes the
rva22 profile as well as the vector and vector crypto extensions.
Excellent news.</p>

Linux support now available for the the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</h2>
<p>date: 2023-10-31, from: OS News</p>
<p>The initial support was posted on October 25th 2023 on the Linux
kernel mailing lists for review by the Linux developers community. With
the set of patches released by Linaro engineers, it is also possible to
boot an AOSP image with Graphics Software Rendering using Google’s
SwiftShader. Since 2014, Linaro Engineers have been working closely with
Qualcomm Engineers to enable Snapdragon platforms to work with Mainline
Linux. Running a recent upstream Linux kernel immediately after the
announcement of a new SoC is a significant achievement, and is a
testimony to the close working partnership between Qualcomm and Linaro.
Interestingly enough, during the recent announcement of the PC-focused X
Elite SoC, Qualcomm also highlighted that Linux will be fully supported
by the platform, and to underline that point, the company showed off X
Elite laptops running both Windows and Linux. While it’ll take more to
convince me that Qualcomm now actually cares about properly supporting
its SoCs and the open source community, they’re at least positive
signs.</p>

<h2 id="on-subscriptions">On subscriptions</h2>
<p>date: 2023-10-31, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<p>
More than three years ago
<a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/subscriptions">I wrote a post about
subscriptions</a> and not a lot has changed since then. Subscriptions
are still here, more present than ever. And they’re getting a lot more
expensive. I was chatting with
<a href="http://carlbarenbrug.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Carl</a>
just the other day because I was curious to know his take on the current
streaming landscape where everything is getting more fragmented but also
a
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/28/23934629/streaming-price-hikes-netflix-hulu-disney-plus-expensive" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">lot
more expensive</a>.
</p>
<p>
The issue with streaming platforms—but also with subscriptions in
general—is that there’s a finite amount of people who are going to
subscribe to a specific service. Which is fine if the goal is to run a
sustainable business. As long as you’re pulling in more money that
you’re spending, you’re good to go.
</p>
<p>
But running a sustainable business is not the goal. Growth is the goal.
And you can’t grow endlessly. And so what do you do when you’re not
growing enough? You either start branching out in weird ways or you
increase prices. Or both.
</p>
<p>
There’s also another option, and it’s the one we’re seeing slowly
creeping in at the moment: subscriptions plus advertising. Because you
know what’s better than getting your money? Getting your money AND
advertisers’ money at the same time.
</p>
<p>
And that’s inevitable. If the goal is to make money, money-making people
will just use any tool at their disposal to get there. And that’s just
depressing.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
In my chat with Carl, I mentioned that one can easily rack up hundreds
of dollars a month just for entertainment services and he said I should
calculate how much I’m spending on subscriptions. I thought it was a
good idea so here’s a breakdown of my subscriptions:
</p>
<p>
On the entertainment side, I’m not paying all that much considering I
only have a Spotify family plan and I’m not subscribed to a single
streaming service. The only other entertainment-related subscription I
have going is Apple Arcade but that’s just because I’m currently playing
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/23878638/japanese-rural-life-adventure-apple-arcade-iphone-game" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Japanese
Rural Life Adventure</a>. I’ll cancel the sub as soon as I’m done with
it. I also have a 1<span class="math inline">$/month contribution to the
Sam Harris podcast that's been there for I don't even know how many
years and I recently picked up another yearly sub to &lt;a
href="https://craigmod.memberful.com/referral/vemx4mp" rel="noreferrer"
target="_blank"&gt;Craig Mod&amp;#039;s Special Projects&lt;/a&gt;
because he has a new book coming out and I want to support that since
the work he does is amazing. So on the entertainment side of things
we're looking at around 33$</span>/month.
</p>
<p>
Then we have all the tech subscriptions. I don’t have anything that’s
exclusively for work since most of the services I use are both for work
and for my various side projects. We have domains, a couple of VPS,
newsletter tools, and a few other things. We’re talking around 70<span

range which is honestly not bad at all. But I’d bet I’m the minority
here because I consume very little entertainment. I’d be curious to see
other people’s breakdowns so if you do end up writing about your
situation let me know.

<h2 id="microtcp-a-minimal-tcpip-stack">MicroTCP: a minimal TCP/IP
stack</h2>
<p>date: 2023-10-31, from: OS News</p>
<p>MicroTCP is a TCP/IP network stack I started building as a learning
exercise while attending the Computer Networking course at the
Università degli Studi di Napoli Federico II. It’s just a hobby project
and is intended to just be a minimal, yet complete, implementation. At
this moment MicroTCP implements ARP (RFC 826, complete), IPv4 (no
fragmentation), ICMP (minimum necessary to reply to pings) and TCP
(complete but not stress-tested). Note that “complete” should not be
intended as “fully compliant” but just as a measure of progress on all
of the major features. For instance, it’s complete enough to handle HTTP
traffic on a local network. People like this usually end up writing a
simple operating system, so it’s interesting to see a TCP/IP stack
instead. While clearly a hobby project, small, portable TCP/IP stacks
can potentially be useful for very specific use cases, like bringing
connectivity to ancient operating systems or other small hobby
projects.</p>

id="former-obama-official-confirmed-as-us-ambassador-to-israel">Former
Obama Official Confirmed as US Ambassador to Israel</h2>
<p>date: 2023-10-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The Senate has confirmed Jacob Lew as ambassador to Israel, filling
the key diplomatic post as the country fights a war with Hamas. </p>
<p>Lew, a Treasury secretary under President Barack Obama, was confirmed
53-43. </p>
<p>Lew has promised to stand side by side with Israel’s leaders as they
respond to the militant group’s October 7 attack, telling senators in
his confirmation hearing in mid-October that “at this moment, there is
no greater mission than to be asked to strengthen the ties between the
United States and the state of Israel.” </p>
<p>President Joe Biden nominated Lew, who goes by Jack, last month to
fill the post left vacant when Tom Nides left as ambassador in July.
Democrats say Lew’s wealth of government experience — he also was chief
of staff to Obama and White House budget director under Obama and
President Bill Clinton — makes him the right person to fill the post at
a a critical moment in the two countries’ relationship. </p>
<p>U.S. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said after Lew’s
confirmation that the administration is eager for him “to get on the
ground and start leading our efforts to support Israel and their fight
against Hamas, but also to help us integrate and continue to lead the
effort to get humanitarian assistance to the people of Gaza.” </p>
<p>Republicans criticized Lew for his role in the Obama White House when
it negotiated the Iran nuclear agreement in 2015, among other foreign
policy moves. The deal with Iran — the chief sponsor of Hamas — was
later scuttled by former President Donald Trump. </p>
<p>“This is the wrong person at the wrong time in the wrong place,”
Senator Jim Risch, the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, said just before the vote. “The last thing we need is
somebody who is very contrary to our view about how Iran should be
handled.” </p>
<p>Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Ben Cardin said Lew has
won praise from Israeli leaders and has the gravitas to “stand shoulder
to shoulder with Israel” as the United States partners with the
country. </p>
<p>“There’s to me no question about his qualifications, no question
about his presence being welcomed by our Israeli friends, no question
about his knowledge and commitment to these issues,” Cardin said. “We
could not have a more qualified individual to represent America as our
ambassador to Israel.” </p>
<p>At the hearing, Lew defended his work in the Obama White House and
called Iran an “evil, malign government.” </p>
<p>“I want to be clear — Iran is a threat to regional stability and to
Israel’s existence,” Lew said. </p>
<p>He also expressed sympathy for the civilians on both sides who have
been injured or killed in the fighting. It must end, Lew said, “but it
has to end with Israel’s security being guaranteed.” </p>
<p>Lew, who is Jewish, said at the hearing that he cannot remember a
time in his life “when Israel’s struggle for security was not at the
forefront of my mind.”</p>

an advisory dated Monday</a>, the Panama Canal Authority said it will
cut the number of ships allowed to pass through the waterway on a
typical day in half due to a drought afflicting the region. This year
has been the area’s second driest since 1950, according to the
authority, with no relief forecast for the rest of 2023.
</p>
<p style>
The authority said “unprecedented” levels at an artificial lake feeding
into the canal are forcing it to cut the number of ships making the
crossing every day from 32 in October to 25 at the beginning of
November. The authority will then continue to slash capacity every
month, all the way down to 18 ships on February 1. Typically,
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/panama-canal-trims-vessel-passage-quota-again-deal-with-severe-drought-2023-09-30/" target="_blank">36
crossings are allowed per day</a>. When lighter restrictions were first
imposed in August, the result was a pileup at the canal, with more than
160 boats waiting to go through, according to
the<a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=60842" target="_blank">
Energy Information Administration</a>.
</p>
<p style>
<strong></strong>The canal works by
<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/panama-canals-low-water-levels-become-headache-consumers/story?id=102674557" target="_blank">moving
ships up and down through a system of locks</a>, which require water
from nearby lakes. When there’s less water in the lakes, fewer of the
massive ships that navigate the canal can pass through. That causes
delays, which drives up the cost of shipping items through the canal.
</p>
<p style>
<span></span>Around 500 million tons of cargo pass through the canal
annually,

macOS Sonoma makes Macs with Asahi Linux unbootable</h2>
<p>date: 2023-10-31, from: OS News</p>
<p>About a year or so ago, the Asahi Linux people told me I was being
paranoid about Apple’s macOS or firmware updates bricking or otherwise
negatively affecting Asahi Linux installs, and that you shouldn’t rely
on Linux on Apple M devices for anything serious. They told me Apple
explicitly supports alternate operating systems on ARM Macs and that
Apple can be fully trusted and relied upon. …so anyway bugs in Sonoma
are making Macs with Asahi installed unbootable. macOS Sonoma and macOS
Ventura 13.6 were released with multiple serious bugs in their upgrade
and boot process. Combined, these bugs can create conditions where a
machine always boots to a black screen, no matter what power button
press combination is used. This leaves users stuck, and the only
solution is to use DFU recovery. Apple obviously doesn’t care about
anyone running anything but macOS on M Macs, and unsurprisingly nobody
at Apple even thought to test for this so of course this happened. I’d
say “I told you so” but I’m tired of warning people about Apple’s
behaviour because apparently people just love endlessly banging their
bloodied head against a wall.</p>

Supreme Court Weighs Whether Public Officials Can Block Critics on
Social Media</h2>
<p>date: 2023-10-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday grappled with a pair of cases from
California and Michigan involving public officials blocking critics on
social media, with the justices struggling to define when such conduct
runs into constitutional limits on the government’s ability to restrict
speech.</p>
<p>Lower courts reached different conclusions in the two cases,
reflecting the legal uncertainty over whether such social media activity
is bound by the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment, which protects
freedom of speech. Blocking users is a function often employed on social
media to stifle critics.</p>
<p>The justices, hearing about three hours of arguments, focused on
spelling out the circumstances for deciding whether public officials
were acting in their personal capacity when blocking critics or engaged
in a “state action.” The First Amendment constrains government actors
but not private individuals.</p>
<p>The first case involves two public school board trustees from Poway,
California, who appealed a lower court’s ruling in favor of parents who
sued them after being blocked from the personal accounts of the
officials on X, called Twitter at the time, and Facebook. The second
case involves a Michigan man’s appeal after a lower court rejected his
lawsuit against a Port Huron city official who blocked him on
Facebook.</p>
<p>Justice Samuel Alito cited a hypothetical town manager who puts a
municipal seal on his own social media page and tells citizens to
express their views. Alito told Hashim Mooppan, a lawyer for the school
board officials, that his argument could let this town manager “block
anybody who expresses criticism of what the town manager is doing, and
thereby create the impression that everybody in town thinks the town
manager is doing the right thing.”</p>
<p>Mooppan urged the justices to embrace the “duty or authority” legal
test that looks at whether officials operated their pages to fulfill
official duties or used governmental authority to maintain them. Under
this test, Mooppan argued, the social media activity of his clients was
not governmental.</p>
<p>Justice Elena Kagan cited former President Donald Trump as an
example, noting he did “a lot of government” on his Twitter account,
sometimes even announcing policies.</p>
<p>“It was an important part of how he wielded his authority — and to
cut a citizen off from that is to cut a citizen off from part of the way
that government works,” Kagan said.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court previously confronted the issue in 2021 in
litigation over Trump’s effort to block critics on Twitter. It declined
to decide the matter, deeming the case moot after Trump left office.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden’s administration sided with the officials in both
cases argued on Tuesday. A ruling is expected by the end of June.</p>
<p>The California case involves Michelle O’Connor-Ratcliff and T.J.
Zane, elected Poway Unified School District trustees. They blocked
Christopher and Kimberly Garnier, parents of three local students, after
they made hundreds of critical posts on issues including race and school
finances. A judge sided with the couple. The San Francisco-based 9th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed.</p>
<p>In the Michigan case, Port Huron resident Kevin Lindke sued after
City Manager James Freed blocked him from his public Facebook page
following critical posts involving the COVID-19 pandemic. A judge ruled
in favor of Freed. The Cincinnati-based 6th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals agreed.</p>
<p>Some justices asked whether requiring public officials to include
disclaimers on their personal pages making clear their social media
activity is not governmental would help disentangle their private and
public capacities.</p>
<p>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said she was struggling to understand
“why the onus isn’t on the government official to be clear about the
capacity in which they’re operating.”</p>
<p>Justice Brett Kavanaugh told Victoria Ferres, an attorney for Freed,
that considering everything an official post about their job to be state
action would be too broad, but he wondered if a narrower category of
postings such as announcing rules, directives or notices would suffice
as official acts.</p>
<p>Ferres agreed: “If you have a duty to announce a rule and the only
time that you ever do it is on the Facebook page, then there is going to
be state action.”</p>

Will Succeed in Ukraine Unless US Support Continues, Pentagon Chief
Says</h2>
<p>date: 2023-10-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said on Tuesday that Russia would
be successful in Ukraine unless the United States kept up its support
for Kyiv.</p>
<p>Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken testified to the Senate
Appropriations Committee on President Joe Biden’s request for $106
billion to fund ambitious plans for Ukraine, Israel and U.S. border
security.</p>
<p>“I can guarantee that without our support [Russian President
Vladimir] Putin will be successful,” Austin said during the hearing.</p>
<p>“If we pull the rug out from under them now, Putin will only get
stronger and he will be successful in doing what he wants to do.”</p>
<p>Arguing that supporting U.S. partners is vital to national security,
Biden requested $61.4 billion for Ukraine, about half of which would be
spent in the United States to replenish weapons stocks drained by
previous support.</p>
<p>Congress has already approved $113 billion for Ukraine since Russia
invaded in February 2022. The White House has said it has less than $5.5
billion in funds to continue transferring weapons from U.S. stockpiles
to Ukrainian forces fighting Russia.</p>
<p>The path forward for Biden’s latest funding plan looks uncertain.
Democrats solidly back Biden’s strategy of combining Ukraine aid with
support for Israel, as do many Republicans in both the Senate and House
of Representatives.</p>
<p>But Republicans who lead the House of Representatives object to
combining the two issues, joined by some party members in the
Senate.</p>
<p>Austin said the Biden administration wanted Ukraine to continue
operations through the winter, but Kyiv could not do that if they were
forced to pause because of a lack of U.S. support.</p>
<p>Kyiv military officials said on Monday that Russia has bulked up its
forces around the devastated city of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine and has
switched its troops from defense to offense, but Ukraine has been
preparing to repel the attacks.</p>

World’s Biggest Carbon Removal Plant Just Turned 2. So, Uh, Is It

<p class="drop-caps" style>
In the spring of 2021, the world’s leading authority on energy published
a “roadmap” for preventing the most catastrophic climate change
scenarios. One of its conclusions was particularly daunting. Getting
energy-related emissions down to net zero by 2050, the International
Energy Agency
<a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/net-zero-by-2050" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>,
would require “huge leaps in innovation.”
</p>
<p style>
Existing technologies would be mostly sufficient to carry us down the
carbon curve over the next decade. But after that, nearly half of the
remaining work would have to come from solutions that, for all intents
and purposes, did not exist yet. Some would only require retooling
existing industries, like developing electric long-haul trucks and
carbon-free steel. But others would have to be built from almost nothing
and brought to market in record time.
</p>
<p>
What will it take to rapidly develop new solutions, especially those
that involve costly physical infrastructure and which have essentially
no commercial value today?
</p>
<p style>
That’s the challenge facing Climeworks, the Swiss company developing
machines to wrest carbon dioxide molecules directly from the air. In
September 2021, a few months after the IEA’s landmark report came out,
Climeworks switched on its first commercial-scale “direct air capture”
facility, a feat of engineering it dubbed “Orca.”
</p>
<p style>
The technology behind Orca is one of the top candidates to clean up the
carbon already blanketing the Earth. It could also be used to balance
out any stubborn,
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-022-01592-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">residual
sources</a> of greenhouse gases in the future, such as from agriculture
or air travel, providing the “net” in net-zero. If we manage to scale up
technologies like Orca to the point where we remove more carbon than we
release, we could even begin cooling the planet.
</p>
<p>
As the largest carbon removal plant operating in the world, Orca is
either trivial or one of the most important climate projects built in
the last decade, depending on how you look at it. It was designed to
capture approximately 4,000 metric tons of carbon from the air per year,
which, as one climate scientist, David Ho, put it, is the equivalent of
rolling back the clock on just
<a href="https://x.com/_david_ho_/status/1489222062577172483?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">3
seconds of annual emissions</a>. But the learnings gleaned from Orca
could surpass any quantitative assessment of its impact. How well do
these “direct air capture” machines work in the real world? How much
does it really cost to run them? And can they get better?
</p>
<p>
The company — and its funders — are betting they can. Climeworks has
made major deals with
<a href="https://www.jpmorganchase.com/news-stories/jpmorgan-chase-seeks-to-scale-investment-in-emerging-carbon-removal-technologies" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">banks</a>,
<a href="https://www.swissre.com/media/press-release/nr-20210825-swiss-re-climeworks-partnership.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">insurers</a>,
and
<a href="https://climeworks.com/news/swarovski-signs-carbon-removal-agreement-with-climeworks" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">other
companies</a> trying to go green to eventually remove carbon from the
atmosphere on their behalf. Last year, the company
<a href="https://climeworks.com/news/equity-fundraising" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">raised
$650 million</a> in equity that will “unlock the next phase of its
growth,” scaling the technology “up to multi-million-ton capacity … as
carbon removal becomes a trillion-dollar market.” And just last month,
the U.S. Department of Energy selected Climeworks, along with another
carbon removal company, Heirloom, to receive up to $600 million to
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-announces-12-billion-nations-first-direct-air-capture" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">build
a direct air capture “hub”</a> in Louisiana, with the goal of removing
one million tons of carbon annually.
</p>
<p>
Two years after powering up Orca, Climeworks has yet to reveal how
effective the technology has proven to be. But in extensive interviews,
top executives painted a picture of innovation in progress.
</p>
<p style>
Chief marketing officer Julie Gosalves told me that Orca is small and
climatically insignificant on purpose. The goal is not to make a dent in
climate change — yet — but to maximize learning at minimal cost. “You
want to learn when you’re small, right?” Gosalves said. “It’s really
de-risking the technology. It’s not like Tesla doing EVs when we have
been building cars for 70 years and the margin of learning and risk is
much smaller. It’s completely new.”

From the ground, Orca looks sort of like a warehouse or a server farm
with a massive air conditioning system out back. The plant consists of
eight shipping container-sized boxes arranged in a U-shape around a
central building, each one equipped with an array of fans. When the
plant is running, which is more or less all the time, the fans suck air
into the containers where it makes contact with a porous filter known as
a “sorbent” which attracts CO2 molecules.
</p>
<p>
When the filters become totally saturated with CO2, the vents on the
containers snap shut, and the containers are heated to more than 212
degrees Fahrenheit. This releases the CO2, which is then delivered
through a pipe to a secondary process called “liquefaction,” where it is
compressed into a liquid. Finally, the liquid CO2 is piped into basalt
rock formations underground, where it slowly mineralizes into stone. The
process requires a little bit of electricity and a lot of heat, all of
which comes from a carbon-free source — a geothermal power plant nearby.
</p>
<p>
A day at Orca begins with the morning huddle. The total number on the
team is often in flux, but it typically has a staff of about 15 people,
Climeworks’ head of operations Benjamin Keusch told me. Ten work in a
virtual control room 1,600 miles away in Zurich, taking turns monitoring
the plant on a laptop and managing its operations remotely. The
remainder work on site, taking orders from the control room, repairing
equipment, and helping to run tests.
</p>
<p>
During the huddle, the team discusses any maintenance that needs to be
done. If there’s an issue, the control room will shut down part of the
plant while the on-site workers investigate. So far, they’ve dealt with
snow piling up around the plant that had to be shoveled, broken and
corroded equipment that had to be replaced, and sediment build-up that
had to be removed.
</p>
<p>
The air is more humid and sulfurous at the site in Iceland than in
Switzerland, where Climeworks had built an earlier, smaller-scale model,
so the team is also learning how to optimize the technology for
different weather. Within all this troubleshooting, there’s additional
trade-offs to explore and lessons to learn. If a part keeps breaking,
does it make more sense to plan to replace it periodically, or to
redesign it? How do supply chain constraints play into that calculus?
</p>
<p>
The company is also performing tests regularly, said Keusch. For
example, the team has tested new component designs at Orca that it now
plans to incorporate into Climeworks’ next project from the start. (Last
year, the company began construction on “Mammoth,” a new plant that will
be nine times larger than Orca, on a neighboring site.) At a summit that
Climeworks hosted in June, co-founder Jan Wurzbacher said the company
believes that over the next decade, it will be able to make its direct
air capture system twice as small and cut its energy consumption in
half.
</p>
<p style>
“In innovation lingo, the jargon is we haven’t converged on a dominant
design,” Gregory Nemet, a professor at the University of Wisconsin who
studies technological development, told me. For example, in the wind
industry, turbines with three blades, upwind design, and a horizontal
axis, are now standard. “There were lots of other experiments before
that convergence happened in the late 1980s,” he said. “So that’s kind
of where we are with direct air capture. There’s lots of different ways
that are being tried right now, even within a company like Climeworks.”
</p>
<p style>
<br/>
</p>
<p class="drop-caps" style>
Although Climeworks was willing to tell me about the goings-on at Orca
over the last two years, the company declined to share how much carbon
it has captured or how much energy, on average, the process has used.
</p>
<p>
Gosalves told me that the plant’s performance has improved month after
month, and that more detailed information was shared with investors. But
she was hesitant to make the data public, concerned that it could be
misinterpreted, because tests and maintenance at Orca require the plant
to shut down regularly.
</p>
<p>
“Expectations are not in line with the stage of the technology
development we are at. People expect this to be turnkey,” she said.
“What does success look like? Is it the absolute numbers, or the
learnings and ability to scale?”
</p>
<p style>
Danny Cullenward, a climate economist and consultant who has studied the
integrity of various carbon removal methods, did not find the company’s
reluctance to share data especially concerning. “For these earliest
demonstration facilities, you might expect people to hit roadblocks or
to have to shut the plant down for a couple of weeks, or do all sorts of
things that are going to make it hard to transparently report the
efficiency of your process, the number of tons you’re getting at
different times,” he told me.
</p>
<p>
But he acknowledged that there was an inherent tension to the stance,
because ultimately, Climeworks’ business model — and the technology’s
effectiveness as a climate solution — depend entirely on the ability to
make precise, transparent, carbon accounting claims.
</p>
<p>
Nemet was also of two minds about it. Carbon removal needs to go from
almost nothing today to something like a billion tons of carbon removed
per year in just three decades, he said. That’s a pace on the upper end
of what’s been observed historically with other technologies, like solar
panels. So it’s important to understand whether Climeworks’ tech has any
chance of meeting the moment. Especially since the company faces
competition from a number of others developing direct air capture
technologies, like
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/heirloom-carbon-microsoft-removal" target="_self">Heirloom</a>
and
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-15/occidental-to-buy-carbon-engineering-for-1-1-billion-in-cash-llcr78ou" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Occidental
Petroleum</a>, that may be able to do it cheaper, or faster.
</p>
<p style>
However, Nemet was also sympathetic to the position the company was in.
“It’s relatively incremental how these technologies develop,” he said.
“I have heard this criticism that this is not a real technology because
we haven’t built it at scale, so we shouldn’t depend on it. Or that one
of these plants not doing the removal that it said it would do shows
that it doesn’t work and that we therefore shouldn’t plan on having it
available. To me, that’s a pretty high bar to cross with a climate
mitigation technology that could be really useful.”
</p>
<p>
More data on Orca is coming. Climeworks recently announced that it will
work with the company
<a href="https://puro.earth/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Puro.Earth</a>
to certify every ton of CO2 that it removes from the atmosphere and
stores underground, in order to sell carbon credits based on this
service. The credits will be listed on a public registry.
</p>
<p>
But even if Orca eventually runs at full capacity, Climeworks will never
be able to sell 4,000 carbon credits per year from the plant. Gosalves
clarified that 4,000 tons is the amount of carbon the plant is designed
to suck up annually, but the more important number is the amount of
“net” carbon removal it can produce. “That might be the first bit of
education you need to get out there,” she said, “because it really
invites everyone to look at what are the key drivers to be paid
attention to.”
</p>
<p>
She walked me through a chart that illustrated the various ways in which
some of Orca’s potential to remove carbon can be lost. First, there’s
the question of availability — how often does the plant have to shut
down due to maintenance or power shortages? Climeworks aims to limit
those losses to 10%. Next, there’s the recovery stage, where the CO2 is
separated from the sorbent, purified, and liquified. Gosalves said it’s
basically impossible to do this without losing some CO2. At best, the
company hopes to limit that to 5%.
</p>
<p>
Finally, the company also takes into account “gray emissions,” or the
carbon footprint associated with the business, like the materials, the
construction, and the eventual decommissioning of the plant and
restoration of the site to its former state. If one of Climeworks’
plants ever uses energy from fossil fuels (which the company has said it
does not plan to do) it would incorporate any emissions from that
energy. Climeworks aims to limit gray emissions to 15%.
</p>
<p style>
In the end, Orca’s net annual carbon removal capacity — the amount
Climeworks can sell to customers — is really closer to 3,000 tons.
Gosalves hopes other carbon removal companies adopt the same approach.
“Ultimately what counts is your net impact on the planet and the
atmosphere,” she said.
</p>
<p style>
<br/>
</p>
<p class="drop-caps" style>
Despite being a first-of-its-kind demonstration plant — and an active
research site — Orca is also a commercial project. In fact, Gosalves
told me that Orca’s entire estimated capacity for carbon removal, over
the 12 years that the plant is expected to run, sold out shortly after
it began operating. The company is now selling carbon removal services
from its yet-to-be-built Mammoth plant.
</p>
<p>
In January, Climeworks announced that Orca had
<a href="https://climeworks.com/news/climeworks-delivers-third-party-verified-cdr-services" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">officially
fulfilled</a> orders from Microsoft, Stripe, and Shopify. Those
companies have collectively asked Climeworks to remove more than 16,000
tons of carbon, according to the deal-tracking site
<a href="http://cdr.fyi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cdr.fyi</a>,
but it’s unclear what portion of that was delivered. The achievement was
verified by a third party, but the total amount removed was not made
public.
</p>
<p>
Climeworks has also not disclosed how much it has charged companies per
ton of carbon, a metric that will eventually be an important indicator
of whether the technology can scale to a climate-relevant level. But it
has provided rough estimates of how much it expects each ton of carbon
removal to cost as the technology scales — expectations which seem to
have shifted after two years of operating Orca.
</p>
<p>
In 2021, Climeworks co-founder Jan Wurzbacher said the company aimed to
get the cost down to $200 to $300 per ton removed by the end of the
decade, with steeper declines in subsequent years. But at the summit in
June, he presented a new cost curve chart showing that the price was
currently more than $1,000, and that by the end of the decade, it would
fall to somewhere between $400 to $700. The range was so large because
the cost of labor, energy, and storing the CO2 varied widely by
location, he said. The company aims to get the price down to $100 to
$300 per ton by 2050, when the technology has significantly matured.
</p>
<p>
Critics of carbon removal technologies often point to the vast sums
flowing into direct air capture tech like Orca, which are unlikely to
make a meaningful difference in climate change for decades to come.
During a time when worsening disasters make action feel increasingly
urgent, many are skeptical of the value of investing limited funds and
political energy into these future solutions. Carbon removal won’t make
much of a difference if the world doesn’t deploy the tools already
available to reduce emissions as rapidly as possible — and there’s
certainly not enough money or effort going into that yet.
</p>
<p>
But we’ll never have the option to fully halt climate change, let alone
begin reversing it, if we don’t develop solutions like Orca. In
September, the International Energy Agency released an update to its
seminal net-zero report. The new analysis said that in the last two
years, the world had, in fact, made significant progress on innovation.
Now, some 65% of emission reductions after 2030 could be accounted for
with technologies that had reached market uptake. It even included a
line about the launch of Orca, noting that Climeworks’ direct air
capture technology had moved from the prototype to the demonstration
stage.
</p>
<p style>
But it cautioned that DAC needs “to be scaled up dramatically to play
the role envisaged,” in the net zero scenario. Climeworks’ experience
with Orca offers a glimpse of how much work is yet to be done.

The technology behind Orca is one of the top candidates to clean up the
carbon already blanketing the Earth. It could also be used to balance
out any stubborn,
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-022-01592-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">residual
sources</a> of greenhouse gases in the future, such as from agriculture
or air travel, providing the “net” in net-zero. If we manage to scale up
technologies like Orca to the point where we remove more carbon than we
release, we could even begin cooling the planet.
</p>
<p style>
As the largest carbon removal plant operating in the world, Orca is
either trivial or one of the most important climate projects built in
the last decade, depending on how you look at it. It was designed to
capture approximately 4,000 metric tons of carbon from the air per year,
which, as one climate scientist, David Ho, put it, is the equivalent of
rolling back the clock on just
<a href="https://x.com/_david_ho_/status/1489222062577172483?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">3
seconds of global emissions</a>. But the learnings gleaned from Orca
could surpass any quantitative assessment of its impact. How well do
these “direct air capture” machines work in the real world? How much
does it really cost to run them? And can they get better?
</p>
<p>
The company — and its funders — are betting they can. Climeworks has
made major deals with
<a href="https://www.jpmorganchase.com/news-stories/jpmorgan-chase-seeks-to-scale-investment-in-emerging-carbon-removal-technologies" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">banks</a>,
<a href="https://www.swissre.com/media/press-release/nr-20210825-swiss-re-climeworks-partnership.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">insurers</a>,
and
<a href="https://climeworks.com/news/swarovski-signs-carbon-removal-agreement-with-climeworks" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">other
companies</a> trying to go green to eventually remove carbon from the
atmosphere on their behalf. Last year, the company
<a href="https://climeworks.com/news/equity-fundraising" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">raised
$650 million</a> in equity that will “unlock the next phase of its
growth,” scaling the technology “up to multi-million-ton capacity … as
carbon removal becomes a trillion-dollar market.” And just last month,
the U.S. Department of Energy selected Climeworks, along with another
carbon removal company, Heirloom, to receive up to $600 million to
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-announces-12-billion-nations-first-direct-air-capture" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">build
a direct air capture “hub”</a> in Louisiana, with the goal of removing
one million tons of carbon annually.
</p>
<p style>
Two years after powering up Orca, Climeworks has yet to reveal how
effective the technology has proven to be. But in extensive interviews,
top executives painted a picture of innovation in progress.
</p>
<p style>
Chief marketing officer Julie Gosalvez told me that Orca is small and
climatically insignificant on purpose. The goal is not to make a dent in
climate change — yet — but to maximize learning at minimal cost. “You
want to learn when you’re small, right?” Gosalvez said. “It’s really
de-risking the technology. It’s not like Tesla doing EVs when we have
been building cars for 70 years and the margin of learning and risk is
much smaller. It’s completely new.”
</p>
<p style>
<br/>
</p>
<p class="drop-caps" style>
From the ground, Orca looks sort of like a warehouse or a server farm
with a massive air conditioning system out back. The plant consists of
eight shipping container-sized boxes arranged in a U-shape around a
central building, each one equipped with an array of fans. When the
plant is running, which is more or less all the time, the fans suck air
into the containers where it makes contact with a porous filter known as
a “sorbent” which attracts CO2 molecules.
</p>

</p>
<p>
When the filters become totally saturated with CO2, the vents on the
containers snap shut, and the containers are heated to more than 212
degrees Fahrenheit. This releases the CO2, which is then delivered
through a pipe to a secondary process called “liquefaction,” where it is
compressed into a liquid. Finally, the liquid CO2 is piped into basalt
rock formations underground, where it slowly mineralizes into stone. The
process requires a little bit of electricity and a lot of heat, all of
which comes from a carbon-free source — a geothermal power plant nearby.
</p>
<p>
A day at Orca begins with the morning huddle. The total number on the
team is often in flux, but it typically has a staff of about 15 people,
Climeworks’ head of operations Benjamin Keusch told me. Ten work in a
virtual control room 1,600 miles away in Zurich, taking turns monitoring
the plant on a laptop and managing its operations remotely. The
remainder work on site, taking orders from the control room, repairing
equipment, and helping to run tests.
</p>
<p style>
During the huddle, the team discusses any maintenance that needs to be
done. If there’s an issue, the control room will shut down part of the
plant while the on-site workers investigate. So far, they’ve dealt with
snow piling up around the plant that had to be shoveled, broken and
corroded equipment that had to be replaced, and sediment build-up that
had to be removed.

</p>
<p>
The air is more humid and sulfurous at the site in Iceland than in
Switzerland, where Climeworks had built an earlier, smaller-scale model,
so the team is also learning how to optimize the technology for
different weather. Within all this troubleshooting, there’s additional
trade-offs to explore and lessons to learn. If a part keeps breaking,
does it make more sense to plan to replace it periodically, or to
redesign it? How do supply chain constraints play into that calculus?
</p>
<p>
The company is also performing tests regularly, said Keusch. For
example, the team has tested new component designs at Orca that it now
plans to incorporate into Climeworks’ next project from the start. (Last
year, the company began construction on “Mammoth,” a new plant that will
be nine times larger than Orca, on a neighboring site.) At a summit that
Climeworks hosted in June, co-founder Jan Wurzbacher said the company
believes that over the next decade, it will be able to make its direct
air capture system twice as small and cut its energy consumption in
half.
</p>
<p style>
“In innovation lingo, the jargon is we haven’t converged on a dominant
design,” Gregory Nemet, a professor at the University of Wisconsin who
studies technological development, told me. For example, in the wind
industry, turbines with three blades, upwind design, and a horizontal
axis, are now standard. “There were lots of other experiments before
that convergence happened in the late 1980s,” he said. “So that’s kind
of where we are with direct air capture. There’s lots of different ways
that are being tried right now, even within a company like Climeworks.”
</p>
<p style>
<br/>
</p>
<p class="drop-caps" style>
Although Climeworks was willing to tell me about the goings-on at Orca
over the last two years, the company declined to share how much carbon
it has captured or how much energy, on average, the process has used.
</p>
<p>
Gosalvez told me that the plant’s performance has improved month after
month, and that more detailed information was shared with investors. But
she was hesitant to make the data public, concerned that it could be
misinterpreted, because tests and maintenance at Orca require the plant
to shut down regularly.
</p>
<p>
“Expectations are not in line with the stage of the technology
development we are at. People expect this to be turnkey,” she said.
“What does success look like? Is it the absolute numbers, or the
learnings and ability to scale?”
</p>
<p style>
Danny Cullenward, a climate economist and consultant who has studied the
integrity of various carbon removal methods, did not find the company’s
reluctance to share data especially concerning. “For these earliest
demonstration facilities, you might expect people to hit roadblocks or
to have to shut the plant down for a couple of weeks, or do all sorts of
things that are going to make it hard to transparently report the
efficiency of your process, the number of tons you’re getting at
different times,” he told me.
</p>
<p>
But he acknowledged that there was an inherent tension to the stance,
because ultimately, Climeworks’ business model — and the technology’s
effectiveness as a climate solution — depend entirely on the ability to
make precise, transparent, carbon accounting claims.
</p>
<p>
Nemet was also of two minds about it. Carbon removal needs to go from
almost nothing today to something like a billion tons of carbon removed
per year in just three decades, he said. That’s a pace on the upper end
of what’s been observed historically with other technologies, like solar
panels. So it’s important to understand whether Climeworks’ tech has any
chance of meeting the moment. Especially since the company faces
competition from a number of others developing direct air capture
technologies, like
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/heirloom-carbon-microsoft-removal" target="_self">Heirloom</a>
and
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-15/occidental-to-buy-carbon-engineering-for-1-1-billion-in-cash-llcr78ou" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Occidental
Petroleum</a>, that may be able to do it cheaper, or faster.
</p>
<p style>
However, Nemet was also sympathetic to the position the company was in.
“It’s relatively incremental how these technologies develop,” he said.
“I have heard this criticism that this is not a real technology because
we haven’t built it at scale, so we shouldn’t depend on it. Or that one
of these plants not doing the removal that it said it would do shows
that it doesn’t work and that we therefore shouldn’t plan on having it
available. To me, that’s a pretty high bar to cross with a climate
mitigation technology that could be really useful.”
</p>
<p>
More data on Orca is coming. Climeworks recently announced that it will
work with the company
<a href="https://puro.earth/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Puro.Earth</a>
to certify every ton of CO2 that it removes from the atmosphere and
stores underground, in order to sell carbon credits based on this
service. The credits will be listed on a public registry.
</p>
<p>
But even if Orca eventually runs at full capacity, Climeworks will never
be able to sell 4,000 carbon credits per year from the plant. Gosalvez
clarified that 4,000 tons is the amount of carbon the plant is designed
to suck up annually, but the more important number is the amount of
“net” carbon removal it can produce. “That might be the first bit of
education you need to get out there,” she said, “because it really
invites everyone to look at what are the key drivers to be paid
attention to.”
</p>
<p>
She walked me through a chart that illustrated the various ways in which
some of Orca’s potential to remove carbon can be lost. First, there’s
the question of availability — how often does the plant have to shut
down due to maintenance or power shortages? Climeworks aims to limit
those losses to 10%. Next, there’s the recovery stage, where the CO2 is
separated from the sorbent, purified, and liquified. Gosalvez said it’s
basically impossible to do this without losing some CO2. At best, the
company hopes to limit that to 5%.
</p>
<p>
Finally, the company also takes into account “gray emissions,” or the
carbon footprint associated with the business, like the materials, the
construction, and the eventual decommissioning of the plant and
restoration of the site to its former state. If one of Climeworks’
plants ever uses energy from fossil fuels (which the company has said it
does not plan to do) it would incorporate any emissions from that
energy. Climeworks aims to limit gray emissions to 15%.
</p>
<p style>
In the end, Orca’s net annual carbon removal capacity — the amount
Climeworks can sell to customers — is really closer to 3,000 tons.
Gosalvez hopes other carbon removal companies adopt the same approach.
“Ultimately what counts is your net impact on the planet and the
atmosphere,” she said.

Despite being a first-of-its-kind demonstration plant — and an active
research site — Orca is also a commercial project. In fact, Gosalvez
told me that Orca’s entire estimated capacity for carbon removal, over
the 12 years that the plant is expected to run, sold out shortly after
it began operating. The company is now selling carbon removal services
from its yet-to-be-built Mammoth plant.
</p>
<p>
In January, Climeworks announced that Orca had
<a href="https://climeworks.com/news/climeworks-delivers-third-party-verified-cdr-services" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">officially
fulfilled</a> orders from Microsoft, Stripe, and Shopify. Those
companies have collectively asked Climeworks to remove more than 16,000
tons of carbon, according to the deal-tracking site
<a href="http://cdr.fyi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cdr.fyi</a>,
but it’s unclear what portion of that was delivered. The achievement was
verified by a third party, but the total amount removed was not made
public.
</p>
<p>
Climeworks has also not disclosed how much it has charged companies per
ton of carbon, a metric that will eventually be an important indicator
of whether the technology can scale to a climate-relevant level. But it
has provided rough estimates of how much it expects each ton of carbon
removal to cost as the technology scales — expectations which seem to
have shifted after two years of operating Orca.
</p>
<p>
In 2021, Climeworks co-founder Jan Wurzbacher said the company aimed to
get the cost down to $200 to $300 per ton removed by the end of the
decade, with steeper declines in subsequent years. But at the summit in
June, he presented a new cost curve chart showing that the price was
currently more than $1,000, and that by the end of the decade, it would
fall to somewhere between $400 to $700. The range was so large because
the cost of labor, energy, and storing the CO2 varied widely by
location, he said. The company aims to get the price down to $100 to
$300 per ton by 2050, when the technology has significantly matured.
</p>
<p>
Critics of carbon removal technologies often point to the vast sums
flowing into direct air capture tech like Orca, which are unlikely to
make a meaningful difference in climate change for decades to come.
During a time when worsening disasters make action feel increasingly
urgent, many are skeptical of the value of investing limited funds and
political energy into these future solutions. Carbon removal won’t make
much of a difference if the world doesn’t deploy the tools already
available to reduce emissions as rapidly as possible — and there’s
certainly not enough money or effort going into that yet.
</p>
<p>
But we’ll never have the option to fully halt climate change, let alone
begin reversing it, if we don’t develop solutions like Orca. In
September, the International Energy Agency released an update to its
seminal net-zero report. The new analysis said that in the last two
years, the world had, in fact, made significant progress on innovation.
Now, some 65% of emission reductions after 2030 could be accounted for
with technologies that had reached market uptake. It even included a
line about the launch of Orca, noting that Climeworks’ direct air
capture technology had moved from the prototype to the demonstration
stage.
</p>
<p style>
But it cautioned that DAC needs “to be scaled up dramatically to play
the role envisaged,” in the net zero scenario. Climeworks’ experience
with Orca offers a glimpse of how much work is yet to be done.

The impoverished imagination of neoliberal climate “solutions” (31 Oct
2023)</h2>
<p>date: 2023-10-31, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links The impoverished imagination of neoliberal climate
“solutions”: “All of the above” is a highly selective proposition. Hey
look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2003, 2008,
2013, 2018 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances,
current writing projects, current reading The impoverished imagination
of neoliberal climate “solutions” (permalink) There is only one planet
in the known universe capable of sustaining human life, and it is
rapidly becoming uninhabitable by humans. Clearly, this warrants bold
action – but which bold action should we take? After half a century of
denial and disinformation, the business lobby has seemingly found
climate religion and has joined the choir, but they have their own
unique hymn: this crisis is so dire, they say, that we don’t have the
luxury of choosing between different ways of addressing the emergency.
We have to do “all of the above” – every possible solution must be
tried. In his new book Dark PR, Grant Ennis explains that this “all of
the above” strategy doesn’t represent a change of heart by big business.
Rather, it’s part of the denial playbook that’s been used to sell
tobacco-cancer doubt and climate disinformation:
https://darajapress.com/publication/dark-pr-how-corporate-disinformation-harms-our-health-and-the-environment
The point of “all of the above” isn’t muscular, immediate action –
rather, it’s a delaying tactic that creates space for “solutions” that
won’t work, but will generate profits. Think of how the tobacco industry
used “all of the above” to sell “light” cigarettes, snuff, snus, and
vaping – and delay tobacco bans, sin taxes, and business-euthanizing
litigation. Today, the same playbook is used to sell EVs as an answer to
the destructive legacy of the personal automobile – to the exclusion of
mass transit, bikes, and 15-minute cities:
https://thewaroncars.org/2023/10/24/113-dark-pr-with-grant-ennis/ As the
tobacco and car examples show, “all of the above” is never really all of
the above. Pursuing “light” cigarettes to reduce cancer is incompatible
with simply banning tobacco; giving everyone a personal EV is
incompatible with remaking our cities for transit, cycling and walking.
When it comes to the climate emergency, “all of the above” means trying
“market-based” solutions to the exclusion of directly regulating
emissions, despite the poor performance of these “solutions.” The big
one here is carbon offsets, which allows companies to make money by
promising not to emit carbon that they would otherwise emit. The idea
here is that creating a new asset class will unleash the incredible
creativity of markets by harnessing the greed of elite sociopaths to the
project of decarbonization, rather than to the prudence of
democratically accountable lawmakers. Carbon offsets have not worked:
they have been plagued by absolutely foreseeable problems that have not
lessened, despite repeated attempts to mitigate them. For starters,
carbon offsets are a classic market for lemons. The cheapest way to make
a carbon offset is to promise not to emit carbon you were never going to
emit anyway, as when fake charities like the Nature Conservancy make
millions by promising not to log forests that can’t be logged because
they are wildlife preserves:
https://pluralistic.net/2022/03/18/greshams-carbon-law/#papal-indulgences
Then there’s the problem of monitoring carbon offsetting activity. Like,
what happens when the forest you promise not to log burns down? If
you’re a carbon trader, the answer is “nothing.” That burned-down forest
can still be sold as if it were sequestering carbon, rather than venting
it to the atmosphere in an out-of-control blaze:
https://pluralistic.net/2021/07/26/aggregate-demand/#murder-offsets When
you bought a plane ticket and ticked the “offset the carbon on my
flight” box and paid an extra $10, I bet you thought that you were
contributing to a market that incentivized a reduction in discretionary,
socially useless carbon-intensive activity. But without those carbon
offsets, SUVs would have all but disappeared from American roads. Carbon
offsets for Tesla cars generated billions in carbon offsets for Elon
Musk, and allowed SUVs to escape regulations that would otherwise have
seen them pulled from the market:
https://pluralistic.net/2021/11/24/no-puedo-pagar-no-pagara/#Rat What’s
more, Tesla figured out how to get double the offsets they were entitled
to by pretending that they had a working battery-swap technology. This
directly translated to even more SUVs on the road:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Tesla,_Inc.#Misuse_of_government_subsidies
Harnessing the profit motive to the planet’s survivability might sound
like a good idea, but it assumes that corporations can self-regulate
their way to a better climate future. They cannot. Think of how Canada’s
logging industry was allowed to clearcut old-growth forests and replace
them with “pines in lines” – evenly spaced, highly flammable,
commercially useful tree-farms that now turn into raging forest fires
every year:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/16/murder-offsets/#pulped-and-papered
The idea of “market-based” climate solutions is that certain harmful
conduct should be disincentivized through taxes, rather than banned.
This makes carbon offsets into a kind of modern Papal indulgence, which
let you continue to sin, for a price. As the outstanding short video
Murder Offsets so ably demonstrates, this is an inadequate, unserious
and immoral response to the urgency of the issue:
https://pluralistic.net/2021/04/14/for-sale-green-indulgences/#killer-analogy
Offsets and other market-based climate measures aren’t “all of the
above” – they exclude other measures that have better track-records and
lower costs, because those measures cut against the interests of the
business lobby. Writing for the Law and Political Economy Project, Yale
Law’s Douglas Kysar gives some pointed examples:
https://lpeproject.org/blog/climate-change-and-the-neoliberal-imagination/
For example: carbon offsets rely on a notion called “counterfactual
carbon,” this being the imaginary carbon that might be emitted by a
company if it wasn’t participating in offsets. The number of credits a
company gets is determined by the difference between its counterfactual
emissions and its actual emissions. But the “counterfactual” here comes
from a business-as-usual world, one where the only limit on carbon
emissions comes from corporate executives’ voluntary actions – and not
from regulation, direct action, or other limits on corporate conduct.
Kysar asks us to imagine a counterfactual that depends on “carbon
upsets,” rather than offsets – one where the limits on carbon come from
“lawsuits, referenda, protests, boycotts, civil disobedience”:
https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cif-green/2010/aug/29/carbon-upsets-offsets-cap-and-trade
If we’re really committed to “all of the above” as baseline for
calculating offsets, why not imagine a carbon world grounded in
foreseeable, evidence-based reality, like the situation in Louisiana,
where a planned petrochemical plant was canceled after a lawsuit over
its 13.6m tons of annual carbon emissions?
https://earthjustice.org/press/2022/louisiana-court-vacates-air-permits-for-formosas-massive-petrochemical-complex-in-cancer-alley
Rather than a tradeable market in carbon offsets, we could harness the
market to reward upsets. If your group wins a lawsuit that prevents
13.6m tons of carbon emissions every year, it will get 13.6 million
credits for every year that plant would have run. That would certainly
drive the commercial imaginations of many otherwise disinterested
parties to find carbon-reduction measures. If we’re going to revive
dubious medieval practices like indulgences, why not champerty, too?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champerty_and_maintenance That is, if
every path to a survivable planet must run through Goldman-Sachs, why
not turn their devious minds to figuring out ways to make billions in
tradeable credits by suing the pants off oil companies? There are any
number of measures that rise to the flimsy standards of evidence in
support of offsets. Like, we’re giving away $85/ton in free public money
for carbon capture technologies, despite the lack of any credible path
to these making a serious dent in the climate situation:
https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/market-insights/latest-news/energy-transition/072523-ira-turbocharged-carbon-capture-tax-credit-but-challenges-persist-experts
If we’re willing to fund untested longshots like carbon capture, why not
measures that have far better track-records? For example, there’s a
pretty solid correlation between the presence of women in legislatures
and on corporate boards and overall reductions in carbon. I’m the last
person to suggest that the problems of capitalism can be replaced by
replacing half of the old white men who run the world with women, PoCs
and queers – but if we’re willing to hand billions to ferkakte scheme
like carbon capture, why not subsidize companies that pack their boards
with women, or provide campaign subsidies to women running for office?
It’s quite a longshot (putting Liz Truss or Marjorie Taylor-Greene on
your board or in your legislature is no way to save the planet), but
it’s got a better evidentiary basis than carbon capture. There’s also
good evidence that correlates inequality with carbon emissions, though
the causal relationship is unclear. Maybe inequality lets the wealthy
control policy outcomes and tilt them towards permitting
high-emission/high-profit activities. Maybe inequality reduces the
social cohesion needed to make decarbonization work. Maybe inequality
makes it harder for green tech to find customers. Maybe inequality leads
to rich people chasing status-enhancing goods (think: private jet rides)
that are extremely carbon-intensive. Whatever the reason, there’s a
pretty good case that radical wealth redistribution would speed up
decarbonization – any “all of the above” strategy should certainly
consider this one. Kysar’s written a paper on this, entitled “Ways Not
to Think About Climate Change”:
https://political-theory.org/resources/Documents/Kysar.Ways%20Not%20to%20Think%20About%20Climate%20Change.pdf
It’s been accepted for the upcoming American Society for Political and
Legal Philosophy conference on climate change:
https://political-theory.org/13257256 It’s quite a bracing read! The
next time someone tells you we should hand Elon Musk billions to in
exchange for making it possible to legally manufacture vast fleets of
SUVs because we need to try “all of the above,” send them a copy of this
paper. Hey look at this (permalink) Mastodon’s latest update makes it

What caught my eye in Olga Kharif’s
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-24/cryptocurrency-delistings-from-exchanges-are-running-at-a-record-pace-this-year"><i>Crypto
Delistings From Exchanges Are Already Running at a Record Pace This
Year</i></a> was this:<br />
<blockquote>
Trading volume on most exchanges has plummeted in the past year, even as
the number of coins has continued to multiply, with more than 1.8
million tokens listed on centralized and decentralized exchanges.
</blockquote>
Kharif reported on the collapse of trading volume earlier in
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-11/coinbase-coin-trading-volume-is-likely-lowest-since-before-public-debut"><i>Coinbase’s
Quarterly Crypto Trading Volume Likely Lowest Since Before Public
Debut</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The largest US digital-asset platform registered about $76 billion in
spot trading volume, a drop of 52% from the year-ago period, according
to data compiled by researcher CCData. The tally is also likely the
least since before the company’s much ballyhooed direct listing on the
Nasdaq Stock Market in April 2021, or just months before prices of
cryptocurrencies peaked.
</blockquote>
Thus what caught my eye wasn’t the drop in trading volume, it was
“<i>more than 1.8 million tokens</i>”! Below the fold I ask how this
could possibly make sense.<br /> <span><a name='more'></a></span> <br />
The thing is that, like the
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2018/10/gini-coefficients-of-cryptocurrencies.html">Gini
coefficients of cryptocurrency holdings</a>, the “more than 1.8 million
tokens” have an incredibly
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_tail">long-tailed
distribution</a>. Almost all the 1.8M tokens are completely irrelevant,
and are very likely to be scams.<br /> <br /> According to
coinmarketcap.com, the top 10 tokens have a combined “market cap” of
about $1.1T, with #10 TRON at $8.2B and a daily volume of $386M. They
represent about 88% of the total “market cap”. The next 10 have a
combined “market cap” of $52B, with #20 Avalanche at $3.7B and a daily
volume of $365M. The top 20 represent about 92% of the total.<br />
<br /> For contrast, tokens from 101 to 110 have a combined “market cap”
of $2.7B with #110 NEM at $254M and a daily volume of $7M. Past #100 we
are deep into shitcoin territory, but there is a long way yet to
go.<br /> <br /> The 1000<sup>th</sup> biggest token is currently
<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/?page=10">Vesper</a>. Its “market
cap” is $3.7M with a daily volume of $67K. This means that there are
more than 1.799M tokens with “market caps” less than $3.7M, or that at
least 99.9% of all tokens have “market caps” of less than $3.7M, and
derisory daily volume.<br /> <br /> Nearly 0.5% of the way to the 1.8M
mark we find things like #8767 XPRO, whose “market cap” is $5K. So it is
likely that 99.5% of all tokens have “market caps” of less than $5K.
Imagine how easily a token with a “market cap” of less than $5K could be
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2023/10/the-invisible-hand-of-market.html">manipulated!</a><br />
<br /> Another way to look at this is to compare “more than 1.8 million
tokens” with 4 million, the number of listed companies in the US. Do you
think that 99.5% of all listed companies in the US have “market caps” of
less than $5K?<br /> <br />

This incredibly skewed distribution is typical of most aspects of
cryptocurrencies. For example, Vildana Hajric writes in
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-08/just-eight-exchanges-handle-90-of-all-crypto-btc-trading-volume-says-kaiko"><i>Just
Eight Exchanges Handle 90% of All Crypto Trading Volume</i></a>
that:<br />
<blockquote>
The top eight platforms account for nearly 92% of depth — a measure of
all bids and asks within 10% of the mid price — and 90% of volume,
according to Kaiko. Binance, the largest crypto exchange, has this year
accounted for more than 30% of global market depth and more than 60% of
worldwide trade volumes. Besides Binance, the list also includes
Coinbase, OKX and Huobi, among others. For context, there are hundreds
of crypto exchanges, according to data from CoinGecko, though many of
them see negligible or no trading at all.

id="anti-war-protest-at-us-congress-hearing-as-biden-officials-ask-for-israel-ukraine-aid">Anti-War
Protest at US Congress Hearing As Biden Officials Ask for Israel,
Ukraine Aid</h2>
<p>date: 2023-10-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Two of President Joe Biden’s top advisers asked U.S. lawmakers to
provide billions more dollars to Israel on Tuesday at a congressional
hearing interrupted repeatedly by protesters accusing American officials
of backing “genocide” against Palestinians in Gaza.</p>
<p>Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd
Austin testified to the Senate Appropriations Committee on Biden’s
request for $106 billion to fund ambitious plans for Ukraine, Israel and
U.S. border security.</p>
<p>Arguing that supporting U.S. partners is vital to national security,
Biden requested $61.4 billion for Ukraine, about half of which would be
spent in the United States to replenish weapons stocks drained by
previous support for Kyiv.</p>
<p>Biden also asked for $14.3 billion for Israel, $9 billion for
humanitarian relief — including for Israel and Gaza — $13.6 billion for
U.S. border security, $4 billion in military assistance and government
financing to counter China’s regional efforts in Asia.</p>
<p>As the hearing began, a line of protesters raised red-stained hands
in the air as an anti-war protest. Capitol police later removed them
from the hearing room after they shouted protests including, “Ceasefire
now!” and “Protect the children of Gaza!”</p>
<p>Blinken said U.S. support for Ukraine has made Russia’s invasion of
Ukraine “a strategic debacle” and stressed the importance of both
security assistance for Israel and humanitarian aid for Palestinians in
Gaza.</p>
<p>“Without swift and sustained humanitarian relief, the conflict is
much more likely to spread, suffering will grow, and Hamas and its
sponsors will benefit by fashioning themselves as the saviors of the
very desperation they created,” Blinken said.</p>
<p>Congress has already approved $113 billion for Ukraine since Russia
invaded in February 2022, but Biden’s $24 billion request for more funds
in August never moved ahead. The White House has said it has less than
$5.5 billion in funds to continue transferring weapons from U.S.
stockpiles to Ukrainian forces fighting Russia.</p>
<p>Republicans divided</p>
<p>The path forward for Biden’s latest funding plan looks uncertain.
Democrats solidly back Biden’s strategy of combining Ukraine aid with
support for Israel, as do many Republicans in both the Senate and House
of Representatives.</p>
<p>“We need to address all of these priorities as part of one package -
because the reality is these issues are all connected, and they are all
urgent,” Senate Appropriations Committee Chairperson Patty Murray
said.</p>
<p>Senator Susan Collins, the committee’s top Republican said she would
judge the funding request on whether it makes the United States more
secure.</p>
<p>But Republicans who lead the House of Representatives object to
combining the two issues, joined by a smaller number of party members in
the Senate. Opinion polls show public support for Ukraine aid declining
and many Republicans, particularly those most closely aligned with
former President Donald Trump, have come out against it.</p>
<p>With federal spending fueled by $31.4 trillion in debt, they question
whether Washington should be funding Ukraine’s war with Russia, rather
than backing Israel or boosting efforts to push back against a rising
China.</p>
<p>Newly elected House Speaker Mike Johnson has voted in the past
against assistance for Kyiv. On Monday, he introduced a bill to provide
$14.3 billion in aid to Israel by cutting funding for the Internal
Revenue Service, setting up a showdown with Senate Democrats.</p>
<p>Johnson became speaker after a three-week stalemate in the House
after former Speaker Kevin McCarthy was ousted partly because he worked
with Democrats to pass a government funding bill.</p>
<p>Biden’s support for Israel, which already receives $3.8 billion in
annual U.S. military assistance, has drawn criticism amid international
appeals for Gaza civilians to be protected.</p>
<p>Palestinian authorities say that Israel’s “total siege” of Gaza since
that rampage has killed more than 8,300 people, more than 3,400 of them
minors, and left a dire need for fuel, food and clean water.</p>
<p>Israel this week launched a ground offensive in the Gaza Strip as it
strikes back at Islamist Hamas militants who killed 1,400 people and

<h2 id="trying-to-use-sway-as-my-window-manager">Trying to use Sway as
my window manager</h2>
<p>date: 2023-10-31, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
Trying to use Sway as my window manager
</h1>
<p>
I’m hoping to get a MNT Pocket Reform at some point and I heard that it
comes with Sway as the default window manager. No problem, I can get
into that. Years ago I was a fan of ratpoison and i3. Today, I’m trying
to use sway. I think my biggest problem right now is that the
pipe/backslash key works like a &lt; and &gt; key. How weird is that.
Maybe some weird key binding that is coming back to haunt me.
</p>
<p>
In order to get started, I copied <code>/etc/sway/config</code> to
<code>~/.config/sway/config</code> and started making some changes.
</p>
<p>
Scrolling with the touch pad was weird. Somehow inverted! The answer was
to have <code>natural_scroll enabled</code> for the touchpad input.
</p>
<pre><code>input &#34;2:14:ETPS/2_Elantech_Touchpad&#34; {
    dwt enabled
    tap enabled
    natural_scroll enabled
    middle_emulation enabled
}
</code></pre>
<p>
Caps Lock is no longer the Compose Key and that makes me sad. The answer
was to specify <code>xkb_options compose:caps</code> for the keyboard
input.
</p>
<pre><code>input &#34;1:1:AT_Translated_Set_2_keyboard&#34; {
    xkb_layout us
    xkb_variant altgr-intl
    xkb_options compose:caps
}
</code></pre>
<p>
Getting the less key instead of the backslash key remained a problem.
There are so many variants in
<code>/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/us</code>. After a while I realised
that I needed a variant with LSGT (less/greater) being mapped to
<code>backslash</code> and <code>bar</code>, like this:
</p>
<pre><code>key &lt;LSGT&gt; {   [ backslash,         bar    ]   };
</code></pre>
<p>
The options I had seemed to be: <code>euro</code>, <code>ibm2381</code>,
<code>intl</code>, and so on. But also anything that contained dead keys
was no good:
</p>
<pre><code>    key &lt;TLDE&gt; { [dead_grave, dead_tilde,         grave,       asciitilde ] };
</code></pre>
<p>
In these variants, I have to type every back-quote, single-quote,
double-quote and circumflex twice.
<a class="account" href="https://social.sdfeu.org/@bkhl" title="@bkhl@social.sdfeu.org" rel="nofollow"><span
class="citation" data-cites="bkhl">@bkhl</span></a> pointed me to
<code>altgr-intl</code>. Thanks!
</p>
<p>
Now I’m wondering about suspending the laptop. With Gnome, I’d hit the
GUI key and type “suspend”, Enter, done. But there is no “suspend”
command. I ended up installing <code>wlogout</code> which gives me huge
buttons to lock, logout, suspend, hibernate, shutdown and reboot. But,
surprisingly, when it suspends, and it comes back, no password is
required. That’s weird!
</p>
<p>
I installed <code>cryptsetup-suspend</code> which adds something the old
setup did not have: returning from a suspend now asks for the disk
decryption password but still does not ask for the account password.
Well, on a single user system like mine, one of the two is good enough,
I guess. But still.

Time has passed and today I added keybindings for lowering and raising
the volume.
</p>
<pre><code>bindsym XF86AudioLowerVolume exec amixer set Master &#39;10%-&#39;
bindsym XF86AudioRaiseVolume exec amixer set Master &#39;10%+&#39;
</code></pre>
<p>
So proud of myself. 😁
</p>
<p>
As for playback from the command-line, right now I’m using
<code>mpv</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>mpv &#34;https://somafm.com/secretagent.pls&#34;
</code></pre>
<h2>
Status bar
</h2>
<p>
OK, time for fiddling with stuff. Every minute, the script called to
produce the status bar.
</p>
<pre><code>bar {
    position top
    status_command while ~/.config/sway/status.fish; do sleep 60; done
    colors {
        statusline #ffffff
        background #323232
        inactive_workspace #32323200 #32323200 #5c5c5c
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>
The script prints something like this:
</p>
<pre><code>Bandu 65% 🟡 100% 🔊 fully-charged🔋 2023-10-31 15:40
</code></pre>
<p>
This is the code. As you can see it calls <code>awk</code>,
<code>perl</code> and tons of other stuff. Yikes!
</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/fish
# The Sway configuration file in ~/.config/sway/config calls this script.
# You should see changes to the status bar after saving this script.
# If not, do &#34;killall swaybar&#34; and $mod+Shift+c to reload the configuration.

<p>
More colleges are offering early decision admissions, where students
signal that a particular university is their top choice but have to
commit before seeing their financial aid package. Early decision is not
without controversy. Students who apply early tend to be wealthier, and
critics say the practice undermines fairness. Plus, child care costs
continue to climb, and the UAW hopes its contract wins will encourage
other car manufacturers to unionize.

Mayfield</a>: “The reason Threads doesn’t have an API or the promised
Fediverse coupling is organizational inertia for the fear of another
Cambridge Analytica.” I think that’s very likely true. I was using
Facebook’s API when they quietly turned it off, and I didn’t blame them
for it, given the way journalism was treating them. Everyone knew they
had an API, and what it could do was openly published, and promoted by
the same journalists who were now blaming them. So while FB has few
scruples to admire them for, as a company – in this case I believe
Ross’s explanation of why they are treading very carefully here.</p>

id="uaw-strike-won-things-no-one-thought-possible-from-automakers">UAW:
Strike ‘Won Things No One Thought Possible’ from Automakers</h2>
<p>date: 2023-10-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The United Auto Workers won at least partial victories on many of the
key demands that led to the six-week strike against Ford, General Motors
and Jeep maker Stellantis.</p>
<p>The union has given some details of the deals, including a detailed
explanation of the agreement it reached with Ford. The agreement is
expected to become the model for later settlements with GM and
Stellantis. Rank-and-file UAW members must ratify each contract before
it takes effect.</p>
<p>“We won things no one thought possible,” UAW President Shawn Fain
said when he announced the tentative agreement last week.</p>
<p>The union represents 57,000 workers at the company, and about 16,600
of them were on strike. Here are the key terms of the agreements, as
detailed by the union:</p>
<p>Pay</p>
<p>The tentative agreements call for 25% increases in pay by April 2028,
raising top pay to about $42 an hour, according to the union. That
starts with an 11% boost upon ratification, three annual raises of 3%
each, and a final increase of 5%. The UAW said restoration of
cost-of-living increases, which were suspended in 2009, could boost the
total increases to more than 30%.</p>
<p>The union initially asked for 40% increases, but scaled that back to
36% before the strike started Sept. 15. Ford’s last offer before the
strike was 9% more pay over four years. More recently, Ford, GM and
Stellantis were all offering 23% total pay increases.</p>
<p>For historical comparison, the union said its workers saw pay
increases of 23% for all the years from 2001 through 2022. </p>
<p>Bonuses</p>
<p>The deals include $5,000 ratification bonuses. </p>
<p>Temporary workers</p>
<p>The union said Ford’s temporary workers will get pay raises totaling
150% over the life of the deal, and workers at certain facilities will
also get outsized raises. The temporary workers will also get the
ratification bonuses and will get profit-sharing starting next year,
officials said.</p>
<p>Benefits</p>
<p>The companies did not agree to bring back traditional defined-benefit
pension plans or retiree health care for workers hired since 2007. But
they agreed to increase 401(k) contributions to about 9.5%.</p>
<p>Shorter work week</p>
<p>The UAW asked for a shorter work week — 40 hours of pay for 32 hours
of work. It did not get that concession.</p>
<p>Worker tiers</p>
<p>The union said Ford and GM agreed to end most divisive wage tiers, a
system under which new hires were put on a less attractive pay scale.
Fain and union members had highlighted the issue, saying it was unfair
for people doing the same work to be paid less than co-workers.</p>
<p>Climbing the ladder</p>
<p>The agreement shortens the time it will take workers to reach top
scale, to three years. It took eight years under the contract that
expired in September. </p>
<p>Right to strike</p>
<p>The union said it won the right to strike against any of the three
companies over plant closures. The automakers had rejected the proposal
at the start of talks.</p>
<p>Union organizing</p>
<p>The agreements with Ford, GM and Stellantis could give the UAW a
boost as it seeks to represent workers at nonunion plants in the U.S.
that are operated by foreign carmakers and Tesla, as well as future
plants that will make batteries for electric vehicles.</p>
<p>The union said Ford agreed to put workers at a future battery plant
in Michigan under the UAW’s master contract, and GM agreed to do so with
work at Ultium Cells, a joint venture between the company and LG Energy
Solution of South Korea.</p>
<p>Fain vowed Sunday that the union will “organize like we’ve never
organized before” at nonunion plants.</p>
<p>“When we return to the bargaining table in 2028, it won’t just be
with the Big Three but with the Big Five or the Big Six,” he said in an
online message to union members.</p>

California Wildfire Prompts Evacuation Order for Thousands as Santa Ana
Winds Fuel Flames</h2>
<p>date: 2023-10-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A wildfire fueled by gusty Santa Ana winds ripped through rural land
southeast of Los Angeles on Monday, forcing about 4,000 people from
their homes, fire authorities said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The so-called Highland Fire erupted at about 12:45 p.m. in dry,
brushy hills near the unincorporated Riverside County hamlet of
Aguanga.</p>
<p>As of late Monday night, it had spread over about 2 square miles (5
square kilometers) of land, fire spokesman Jeff LaRusso said.</p>
<p>About 1,300 homes and 4,000 residents were under evacuation orders,
he said.</p>
<p>The fire had destroyed three buildings and damaged six others but it
wasn’t clear whether any were homes. The region is sparsely populated
but there are horse ranches and a large mobile home site, LaRusso
said.</p>
<p>No injuries were reported.</p>
<p>Winds of 20 to 25 miles per hour (32 to 40 kph) with some higher
gusts drove the flames and embers through grass and brush that were
dried out by recent winds and low humidity so that it was “almost like
kindling” for the blaze, LaRusso said.</p>
<p>The winds were expected to ease somewhat overnight and fire crews
would attempt to box in the blaze, LaRusso said.</p>
<p>But, he added: “Wind trumps everything. Hopefully the forecast
holds.”</p>
<p>A large air tanker, bulldozers and other resources were called in to
fight the fire, one of the few large and active blazes to have erupted
so far in California’s year-round fire season, LaRusso said.</p>
<p>Southern California was seeing its first significant Santa Ana wind
condition. The strong, hot, dry, dust-bearing winds typically descend to
the Pacific Coast from inland desert regions during the fall. They have
fueled some of the largest and most damaging fires in recent California
history.</p>
<p>The National Weather Service said Riverside County could see winds of
15 to 25 mph (24 to 40 kph) through Tuesday with gusts as high as 40
miles per hour (64 kph). The weather service issued a red flag warning
of extreme fire danger through Tuesday afternoon for parts of Los
Angeles and Riverside counties.</p>

<p>date: 2023-10-31, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
Bought some tea for 2024
</h1>
<p>
We went to visit Bern, walked through the botanical gardens, saw the
bears, drank hot chocolate and finally went to see friends for dinner.
</p>
<p>
But before going there, we had set aside an hour to buy tea at
<a href="https://www.laenggasstee.ch/index.php" rel="nofollow">Länggass
Tee</a>. We drank three different kinds of pu-ehr tea and I ended up
buying a cake.
</p>
<p>
It is only now as we’re sitting in the train home that I see on their
homepage that they got some Dongpian Oolong from Taiwan: A Li Shan Dong
Pian 阿里山冬片 and Gu Keng Dong Pian 古坑冬. Should have bought some!
Oh, and they bought some Korean tea, too! Ha Dong Dae Jak 河东大雀
하동대작, Ha Dong Se Jak 河东细雀 하동세작 and Jirisan Wu Jeon
智异山雨前 지리산우전.
</p>
<p>
Next time I really should read the website <em>before</em> we go visit,
not on the way home.
</p>
<p>
Here’s what I bought:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Sencha Uji Special (100g)
</li>
<li>
Gang Kou Cha Meer Oolong (100g) 港口茶
</li>
<li>
Bai Hao Wu Long, Oriental Beauty (50g) 东方美人 白毫鸟龙
</li>
<li>
Ye Lai Xiang, Phoenix Single Bush (50g) 凤凰单丛 夜来香
</li>
<li>
Pu Er Sheng Bing Gu Shu Cha, Manzhuang 2013 (375g) 普洱生饼古树茶 曼庄
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I still have three bags of tea open, but I also don’t come often to Bern
too often, so this is what I’ll be drinking in the coming year. 🍵
</p>
<p>
I also had to explain to my wife how little I knew and that I knew true
tea nerds on fedi like

id="uaw-reaches-deal-with-gm-ending-strike-against-detroit-automakers">UAW
Reaches Deal With GM, Ending Strike Against Detroit Automakers</h2>
<p>date: 2023-10-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>General Motors and the United Auto Workers (UAW) struck a tentative
deal on Monday, ending the union’s unprecedented six-week campaign of
coordinated strikes that won record pay increases for workers at the
Detroit Three automakers.</p>
<p>The accord follows deals the union reached in recent days with Ford
and Chrysler-owner Stellantis— significant victories for auto workers
after years of stagnant wages and painful concessions following the 2008
financial crisis.</p>
<p>“We wholeheartedly believe our strike squeezed every last dime out of
General Motors,” UAW President Shawn Fain said in a video address. “They
underestimated us. They underestimated you.”</p>
<p>The union officially suspended its strike against the Detroit Three.
UAW local leaders will come to Detroit on Friday to consider the deal
with GM, before taking terms to all union workers for ratification.</p>
<p>“We are looking forward to having everyone back to work across all of
our operations,” said GM CEO Mary Barra.</p>
<p>The new contracts will significantly raise costs for the automakers.
The companies and some analysts have said the deals will make it harder
for the Detroit Three to compete with electric-vehicle leader Tesla and
nonunion foreign brands such as Toyota Motor.</p>
<p>The UAW won from GM roughly the same package of wage increases agreed
with the other two automakers. Pay for veteran workers will rise by 33%
and GM will give $2,500 in five payments to retirees through 2028.</p>
<p>Sources have said pension benefits were a sticking point in the UAW’s
negotiations with GM, which has more retirees than Ford or
Stellantis.</p>
<p>Fain said the union’s move on Saturday to strike a key GM engine
factory in Spring Hill, Tennessee, “landed the knockout blow” that got
the deal.</p>
<p>The contract reverses years of efforts by GM to create lower-paid
groups of UAW workers at units such as component plants, parts
warehouses and electric vehicle battery operations. It puts workers at
GM’s battery joint-venture with South Korea’s LG Energy under the
national agreement.</p>
<p>Fain said some workers at GM’s component operations will get pay
increases of as much as 89%.</p>
<p>The contract also restricts use of lower paid temporary workers. “We
have slammed the door on having a permanent underclass of temporary
workers at GM,” Fain said.</p>
<p>The UAW also gained more sway over the companies’ investment
decisions by securing the right to strike over future plant
closures.</p>
<p>All three companies have said they do not plan to close existing
factories as they shift to EVs. Yet the contract could force them to
keep unprofitable plants open during a recession or period of slow sales
for new models.</p>
<p>Higher costs</p>
<p>A series of walkouts began on Sept. 15, and nearly 50,000 workers out
of nearly 150,000 UAW members at the Detroit automakers eventually
joined. The strategy of escalating strikes cost the Detroit Three and
suppliers billions of dollars.</p>
<p>UAW leaders called their contract fight part of a larger movement to
reverse decades of economic setbacks for working-class Americans. Some
analysts agreed.</p>
<p>“This is more than an auto industry story; it is a signal to the
entire country that unionized workers can demand and get big wage
increases,” said Patrick Anderson of the Anderson Economic Group.</p>
<p>The new contract will cost GM $7 billion over 4.5 years in higher
labor costs, two sources told Reuters. Ford said last week it would add
$850 to $900 per vehicle in labor costs.</p>
<p>“Consumers will bear some of the cost burden over time … automakers
will not have an easy time passing along all of the costs … and will
have to seek efficiencies in other ways, or further limit production to
more expensive vehicles that can absorb higher labor costs,” Cox
Automotive’s chief economist, Jonathan Smoke, said.</p>
<p>Praise from Biden</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden and politicians from both parties weighed in
to support the UAW as the union’s fight gained popularity with voters.
Michigan will again be a crucial swing state in the 2024 presidential
election, and Fain made support for the union’s fight a condition of
winning his endorsement. The UAW still has not formally endorsed Biden’s
re-election.</p>
<p>“This historic contract is a testament to the power of unions and
collective bargaining to build strong middle-class jobs while helping
our most iconic American companies thrive,” Biden said in a statement.
His aides had worried that a prolonged strike would damage the U.S.
economy and the Democratic president’s chances of re-election in
2024.</p>
<p>The UAW has said it is committed to organizing workforces at other
carmakers, making negotiations in 2028 between the union and the “Big
Five or Big Six.”</p>
<p>Momentum toward deals accelerated over the past two weeks after UAW
workers walked out at three of the most profitable factories in the
world. The UAW eventually struck against nine plants.</p>
<p>“We have shown the companies, the American public and the whole world
that the working class is not done fighting” Fain said. “In fact, we’re

House Welcomes Restoration of Telecommunications, Some Aid Into
Gaza</h2>
<p>date: 2023-10-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The White House welcomed on Monday the limited flow of humanitarian
aid and the restoration of telecommunications in Gaza as Israel
continues its ground offensive on the enclave in response to the Hamas
militant group’s stunning Oct. 7 attack.</p>
<p>It also repeated its warning to regional actors to stay out of the
fight.</p>
<p>“Our message to any actor seeking to exploit this conflict is: don’t
do it,” said John Kirby, director of strategic communications for the
National Security Council. “And as you all know, we have strengthened
our force posture in the region. We’re continually watching to make sure
that any actor who might be tempted to jump in here knows that we will
take very seriously our national security interests in the region, not
to mention our obligation to protect our troops in our facilities that
are going after ISIS in places like Iraq and Syria.”</p>
<p>But this conflict is also exploding in the court of public opinion.
Hundreds of people stormed an airport in Russia’s Dagestan region over
the weekend, shouting antisemitic slurs over the arrival of a flight
from Tel Aviv.</p>
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin blamed the events on foreign
interference, saying they “were inspired, including through social
networks, not least from the territory of Ukraine by the agents of
Western intelligence services.”</p>
<p>Kirby dismissed that.</p>
<p>“It’s classic Russian rhetoric, when something goes bad in your
country: blame somebody else, blame it on outside influences. The West
had nothing to do with this. This is just hate, bigotry and
intimidation. Pure and simple,” he said.</p>
<p>“And a good leader, a decent leader will call it out for what it is
the way President [Joe] Biden has called it out here in this country,
instead of blaming the West for something and pushing it off to somebody
else,” Kirby said.</p>
<p>Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has dug in on his disagreement
with the U.S.’ classification of Hamas as a terror group and shifted
blame elsewhere.</p>
<p>“The West has the biggest responsibility for the massacre in Gaza,”
Erdogan said.</p>
<p>Iranian officials have piled on as well, with Iranian Foreign
Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian taking to the rostrum at the United
Nations last week to outline their view. Iranians have also protested on
the streets.</p>
<p>“It has been three weeks that we have been witness to the war crimes
and genocide of the occupying Israeli regime in Gaza and the West Bank
of Palestine,” Amirabdollahian said during an emergency United Nations
assembly earlier this month.</p>
<p>“The United States and several European countries have sided with the
occupying regime of Israel without observing the U.N. charter and
international law,” he said.</p>
<p>Kirby said the White House believes there is a fine line between
disagreement and discord, adding the administration is vigilant over
outbreaks of antisemitism.</p>
<p>“We believe in the right of peaceful protest, even if it’s, you know,
espousing ideas we don’t agree with,” he said. “But we don’t – nobody
wants – to see peaceful protests turn violent or turn dangerous the way
that this mob activity did in Dagestan yesterday. So it’s of concern and
it’s something that we’ll continue to talk about with our allies and
partners.”</p>
<p>The U.S. is also seeing such protests – many supportive of
Palestinians and critical of Israel – bubbling up at major U.S.
universities in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Spelman College, a historically Black institution in Georgia,
recently held a rally that drew hundreds of attendees in support of
Palestinians. Attendees carried signs with messages like “Free
Palestine” and “End all U.S. aid to Israel.”</p>
<p>Dr. Helene Gayle pointed to her institution’s main mission when VOA
asked how the school tries to frame debates like these.</p>
<p>“What I really hope and believe is that we are teaching young people
to be critical thinkers, teaching young people to go beyond sometimes
the simple messages that they’re hearing sometimes misinformation that
they may be getting – and really understand in a critical, analytic way
what the what the issues are so that they can take positions that are
well informed,” Gayle told VOA at the White House on Monday.</p>
<p>”You know, on Spelman’s campus, we are having opportunities to do
teach-ins and learn about the situation between Israel and Palestine and
thinking about how do we look at this in as balanced a way as we
possibly can,” she said. “So that’s what I really hope, is that we’re
continuing to teach a generation of young people who can be critical
thinkers who can look at information and think about it in balanced ways
so that they can be true spokespersons, but with a base of knowledge and
information that informs their opinions.”</p>

short but interesting look back at the history of this undeservedly
unloved operating system. It was a proto-netbook, it was a palmtop, it
was a PDA, it was Windows Phone 7 but not Windows Phone 8, and then it
was an embedded ghost. It parents never seemed to know what to do with
it after it grew up, beyond offer it up for anybody to shape in their
own image. And then, earlier this month, with little notice, Windows CE
was no more, at least as a supported operating system. I will never
forget Windows CE.</p>

<h2 id="swift-meet-winrt">Swift, meet WinRT</h2>
<p>date: 2023-10-31, from: OS News</p>
<p>The goal of this post is to share how we, at the Browser Company,
have made it possible to use Swift to build a modern Windows
application. There is no UI framework for Windows written in Swift, and
Windows itself is written in C++ – so that may leave you wondering, “how
can I build my app on Windows”?  Modern Windows applications use WinRT,
a technology built on top of COM, which can interop really well with
Swift, as we presented in our previous post. To be able to build
idiomatic UI for Windows in Swift, we have built a language projection
tool which creates idiomatic Swift language bindings for WinRT, and
today we are open sourcing it at
https://github.com/thebrowsercompany/swift-winrt. Swift/Winrt is based
on Microsoft’s code generators for C++ (github.com/microsoft/cppwinrt)
and C# (github.com/microsoft/cswinrt), and thus is written in C++. Cool
stuff.</p>

<p>Since May, uBO has been in a cat-and-mouse game with YouTube. And
they’ve shown incredible resilience, especially when you consider that
there are only two people on the uBO team dealing with YouTube. The uBO
team members are all volunteers. They’ve gone above and beyond to meet
every little request from their users. But there’s a limit to how much
they can take. At some point, the constant demands become too much, and
they will leave uBO for good. It’s one thing to play cat and mouse with
YouTube. It’s quite another to deal with a wave of angry users. Maybe
that’s how YouTube will win this war of attrition. If you use YouTube
enough, YouTube Premium is a great deal – albeit it a deal that’s
steadily getting worse as Google increases its price.</p>

<u>AI writing detection tool</u>
</h3>
<p>
Many of you have been concerned about the use of AI writing in the
research papers you’ve received since the launch of ChatGPT last
November and have been in touch to enquire about the availability of an
AI writing detection tool for Crossref members.
</p>
<p>
You will also have read that Turnitin have developed an AI writing
detector tool and have made it available to their education sector
customers since April. Turnitin have published
<a href="https://www.turnitin.com/blog/ai-writing-detection-update-from-turnitins-chief-product-officer" target="_blank">an
update</a> in May,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zy-aH1pcbKk" target="_blank">a
helpful video</a> and
<a href="https://www.turnitin.com/blog/understanding-the-false-positive-rate-for-sentences-of-our-ai-writing-detection-capability" target="_blank">further
information on the false positive rates</a> in June based on the
feedback they’ve received from the education community.
</p>
<p>
I am pleased to announce that Turnitin’s AI writing detection tool will
be available <strong>as a free preview</strong> to iThenticate v2 users,
via the new version of the similarity report, <strong>from Wednesday 1 
November until the end of December 2023.</strong>
</p>
<h3 id="enabling-ai-writing-detection">
Enabling AI writing detection
</h3>
<p>
Our preference was to have the new AI writing detection tool turned
‘off’ as a default, however this hasn’t been possible. Account
administrators can turn this feature off by going to
<strong>Settings</strong> and selecting the <strong>Crossref
Web</strong> tab and scrolling down to the <strong>AI Writing</strong>
section at the very bottom of the page. The feature is applied to all
submissions when it is enabled.

<p>
Please note that AI Writing detection is only available in the new
similarity report.
</p>
<h3 id="integrations">
Integrations
</h3>
<p>
There is currently no integration between manuscript tracking systems
and the AI writing detection tool. However the AI score will be
available via the similarity report. If the AI writing detection tool
has been set as ‘off’ by the account administrator, there will be no
score and the ‘AI Writing’ heading will not be visible on the similarity
report:

<h3 id="file-requirements">
File requirements
</h3>
<p>
Turnitin have made some important file requirements available for the
tool to run a report:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Must be written <strong>in English</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
A minimum 300 words
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
A maximum of 15,000 words
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The file size must be less than 100 MB
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Accepted file types are .docx, .pdf, .rtf and .txt
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
If your file does not meet the above requirements, iThenticate v2 will
display the following message:

<p>
Turnitin’s AI writing detection tool has been developed to detect GPT 3,
3.5, 4 and other variants. More information on this is available on
their
<a href="https://www.turnitin.com/products/features/ai-writing-detection/faq" target="_blank"><strong>FAQs
page.</strong></a>
</p>
<p>
Turnitin have provided the following guidance regarding the AI scores:
</p>
<p>
<em><strong>“Blue with a percentage between 0 and 100: The submission
has processed successfully. The displayed percentage indicates the
amount of qualifying text within the submission that Turnitin’s AI
writing detection model determines was generated by AI. As noted
previously, this percentage is not necessarily the percentage of the
entire submission. If text within the submission was not considered
long-form prose text, it will not be included.</strong></em>
</p>
<p>
<em><strong>Our testing has found that there is a higher incidence of
false positives when the percentage is between 1 and 20. In order to
reduce the likelihood of misinterpretation, the AI indicator will
display an asterisk (*) for percentages between 1 and 20 to call
attention to the fact that the score is less reliable.</strong></em>
</p>
<p>
<em><strong>To explore the results of the AI writing detection
capabilities, select the indicator to open the AI writing report. The AI
writing report opens in a new tab of the window used to launch the
Similarity Report. If you have a pop-up blocker installed, ensure it
allows Turnitin pop-ups.”</strong></em>
</p>
<p>
Please note that unlike the similarity report, the AI writing report
will only provide a score and highlight the blocks of texts likely to
have been written by an AI tool and will not list source matches.
</p>
<p>
We encourage you to test the writing detection tool as much as possible
during the free preview period (1 November-31 December 2023).

<u>Next</u>
</h3>
<p>
Turnitin are planning to release a beta version of their new paraphrase
detection tool at the end of this year/Q1, 2024. It will be initially
available as a free preview for a short period of time. 
</p>
<h3 id="ai-and-paraphrase-detection-bundle">
AI and paraphrase detection bundle
</h3>
<p>
Once the free preview period ends, Turnitin would like to offer Crossref
members an AI and paraphrase detection bundle from 2024 - this means
that if you choose to subscribe to this new service, you will be charged
an additional fee each time you upload a manuscript. 
</p>
<h3 id="fixes">
Fixes
</h3>
<p>
Many of you have been waiting for fixes to the aggregation of URLs
issues in the matched sources of the similarity report and to the
doc-to-doc PDF report in iThenticate v2. Turnitin are planning to
release fixes for these before the end of 2023.
