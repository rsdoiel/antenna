24.04 supports easy installation of OpenZFS root file-system with
encryption</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-16, from: OS News</p>
<p>So with Ubuntu 24.04 LTS is the ability to continue with a standard
EXT4 file-system install, an encrypted file-system using LVM, or using
OpenZFS with/without encryption. Ubuntu 24.04 LTS also has the ability
to enjoy hardware-backed full-disk encryption with TPM as another new
experimental option. Or, of course, the Ubuntu desktop installer
continues supporting manual (custom) partitioning as well. ↫ Michael
Larabel I just use whatever Btrfs setup Fedora automatically recommends
when I let it take over a disk – file systems for desktops seems a bit
like a solved problem to me personally – but I’m still curious what
benefits, for instance, an OpenZFS setup could bring to a desktop user
compared to Btrfs or a basic Ext4 setup. Why should a desktop user use
OpenZFS?</p>

<h2 id="theyre-looting-the-internet">They’re looting the internet</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-16, from: OS News</p>
<p>This is the state of the modern internet — ultra-profitable platforms
outright abdicating any responsibility toward the customer, offering not
a “service” or a “portal,” but cramming as many ways to interrupt the
user and push them into doing things that make the company money. The
greatest lie in tech is that Facebook and Instagram are for “catching up
with your friends,” because that’s no longer what they do. These
platforms are now pathways for the nebulous concept of “content
discovery,” a barely-personalized entertainment network that
occasionally drizzles people or things you choose to see on top of
sponsored content and groups that a relational database has decided are
“good for you.” ↫ Edward Zitron Corporate social media has gotten so
bad, they’re basically unusable. The rare times I open Facebook to like
a picture my mother posted or whatever, I’m just gobsmacked by how
utterly unusable it has become. I’ve never used Instagram, but whenever
I accidentally end up there, I have no idea how to navigate that place.
YouTube is more ads than video if you don’t pay for Premium (which I do,
because I use YouTube a lot so I get enough value out of it). Twitter is
barely worth a mention – it’s no surprise that a social network bought
and run by a nazi is now even fuller of nazis than it already was. It’s
not just social networks, either. The web as a whole feels like it’s
been looted and plundered, and turned into a flyover state strip mall.
Browsing the web is, for me at least, virtually impossible without
autoplay blockers, my Pi-Hole, Consent-O-Matic, and settings to
permanently block requests for location and notification access. The
rise of “AI” has only made everything even worse, especially now that
the big, wealthy content networks that, yes, own all your favourite
technology news websites are also looking into it. Luckily, there’s also
a countermovement brewing. I’ve focused OSNews’ entire “social” strategy
on Mastodon (and the various other ActivityPub tools), as it’s the only
social medium that’s usable and enjoyable. With the nazis remaining on
Twitter, and all the brands and influencers on Facebook (or Threads or
whatever), everyone else interested in technology coalesced around the
Fediverse, and it’s been a massive boon for a small website like OSNews
trying to steer clear from all the SEO enshittification. There’s no
spam, only relatively small, approachable brands, no influencers, no
algorithms – just real, ordinary people, who also care about a usable,
fair, and equitable web. I hope that OSNews can eventually be run
without any ads at all, but that’s going to take a lot more consistent
work from me to convince more and more people to support us through
Patreon or Ko-Fi, or for companies to become sponsors. However, I am
convinced it’s a better route to take than trying to chase the SEO
dragon, because we all know where that leads to.</p>

<h2 id="elon-musk-is-self-driving-tesla-into-the-ground">Elon Musk Is
Self-Driving Tesla Into the Ground</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-16, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjAwNzM4Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0MjgzNTAyMH0.EK8FZhi6C3-cCRX1-qICoiYe9m9H994Cju6j4w7zmzk/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Five years ago, the world met the Model Y. Tesla officially unveiled its
smaller crossover in March 2019 and, the next year, began to sell the
car in staggering numbers. The Model Y helped Tesla tighten its grip on
the electric vehicle market. By 2023 it had displaced the Toyota Corolla
as the world’s best-selling car of any kind.
</p>
<p>
It’s not easy to follow up a massive success. What’s worse is having no
plan at all — or being chronically unable to stick to one. That’s where
Tesla seems to be amid yet another shakeup at the company.
</p>
<p>
This week, Tesla announced it would
<a href="https://electrek.co/2024/04/15/tesla-lays-off-more-than-10-of-its-global-workforce/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>lay
off</u></a> 10% of its worldwide staff, while some influential leaders
are
<a href="https://twitter.com/EdLudlow/status/1779863496198664195" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>leaving</u></a>
of their own accord. The news comes as Tesla has just announced a sales
dip and prognosticators wonder whether we’re entering an “EV winter”
where more buyers choose hybrids instead. Now, this is neither the first
time Tesla has run into difficulty nor the first time the EV maker has
commenced mass layoffs to cut costs. Somehow, though, this time feels
different.
</p>
<p>
During the Model’s Y’s ascendance over the past half-decade, Tesla’s
path forward to the next thing has turned into a mess of distractions
and left turns. Musk became obsessed with and then purchased Twitter, a
boondoggle of a deal that clearly distracted him from his car company.
The oft-touted Roadster supercar has yet to materialize.
</p>
<p>
More importantly, the long-promised
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/redwood-is-exactly-what-tesla-needs" target="_self"><u>$25,000
car</u></a> appears to be dead (or at least
<a href="https://electrek.co/2024/04/15/tesla-puts-electric-car-codenamed-nv9-back-burner-despite-elon-musk-said/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>tabled</u></a>
indefinitely). Musk had initially indicated the affordable Tesla would
finally arrive next year, leaving the company to endure a single gap
year without a new vehicle. But <em><em>Reuters</em></em> reported that
Tesla has killed the idea in part because of competition overseas from
ultra-cheap Chinese EVs, and while Musk responded to the report by
saying <em><em>Reuters</em></em> was
“<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-lay-off-more-than-10-its-staff-electrek-reports-2024-04-15/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>lying</u></a>,”
he’s done nothing to indicate the “Model 2” is anything but dead.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, the only new-ish vehicle in the Tesla lineup, the Cybertruck,
is stuck. Tesla stopped deliveries of the steel beast for an unknown
issue,
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/04/tesla-stops-cybertruck-deliveries-accelerator-pedal-may-be-to-blame/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>rumored</u></a>
to be related to sticky accelerator problems, and shortened production
shifts at the factory. And while it’s possible to squint and see a
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/tesla-cybertruck-pickup-gmc-hummer" target="_self"><u>case
for the Cybertruck</u></a>, I’ve written here numerous times that
Tesla’s big
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/cybertruck-tesla-elon-musk" target="_self"><u>mistake</u></a>
wasn’t putting that eyesore on the road. Instead, it was focusing the
company’s attention on something so adolescent and absurd at a moment
when it could have tightened its grip on the EV market, and given
American EV drivers some interesting new options, by rolling out new
cars that look more like something the average American would want to
buy.
</p>
<p>
So what <em><em>is</em></em> Tesla up to? In a follow-up tweet after he
attacked <em><em>Reuters</em></em>, Musk suddenly announced that he
would reveal the company’s
“<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/5/24122384/tesla-robotaxi-reveal-date-elon-musk-august-8" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>robotaxi</u></a>”
on August 8. This would be Tesla’s completely self-driven vehicle.
Musk’s favorite claim about the car is that it would earn its owners
passive income by driving itself around, picking up and dropping off
passengers as a kind of dystopian Uber.
</p>
<p>
The dream certainly fits in with Musk’s oeuvre. The CEO clearly still
sees Tesla as a lean startup that moves fast and breaks things, not an
established car company that would do something so expected and bland as
building a perfectly acceptable three-row family crossover to compete
with the Kia EV9. Compare that to the way other companies born of
Silicon Valley began to act once they got big. Apple may have engaged in
a long, fruitless
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-03-10/what-did-the-apple-car-look-like-inside-apple-s-planned-self-driving-vehicle-ltlic8vt" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>dalliance</u></a>
with the self-driving car, but ultimately, it knows its bread is
buttered by iterating on everything in the iPhone ecosystem. Facebook
may have changed its name to Meta to highlight its mission to create the
metaverse, but it still leaned into the revenue engines it built or
acquired, like Instagram or Whatsapp.
</p>
<p>
It’s fine to tell yourself a story about who you want to be. And to give
Tesla the benefit of the doubt for a moment: sure, maybe it will be the
one to crack full autonomous driving. But in practical terms, that tech
is not close to reality, and Tesla’s version of it has encountered its
fair share of bugs and been
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/11/24097480/tesla-walter-huang-crash-lawsuit-court-autopilot" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>sued</u></a>
over crashes.
</p>
<p>
(In the spirit of “robotaxi,” the company just offered a month-long free
trial of Full Self Driving to Tesla drivers. I will certainly not be
using it with a young child in the car. The brand has also mandated that
potential drivers be given a demo of FSD during test-drives, seemingly
to hammer home the idea that Tesla is just a few steps away from having
the car drive you home while you take a nap.)
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, you have to wonder just what Tesla is going to sell to
humans who want a plain old electric car. It recently completed a
refresh for the Model 3, and while the new one looks a little like next
year’s iPhone — the same product with a facelift and a couple new
features — you’d expect to see a similar update coming to the Model Y.
</p>
<p>
It’s important to remember: Despite the ill wishes from his online
haters, Musk isn’t exactly dead in the water. Tesla sold 220,000 Model
3s in America last year and nearly 400,000 Model Ys, a huge lead over
competitor EV from legacy car brands. Those companies are hitting the
same EV headwinds as Tesla this year, while golden child Rivian is still
at least a couple of years away from selling its exciting smaller SUVs.
Tesla is the established giant in electric cars, even as it looks in the
mirror and sees an upstart.
</p>
<p>
Yet with Cybertruck landing with a thud, and no obvious follow-up in the
works, Tesla is in danger of blowing that huge lead. It may
<em>want</em> to transform into a software company, and to earn back
some of Musk’s <em>Iron Man</em> sci-fi cred by realizing the
self-driving car. But at this moment, it feels a little like an electric
car company that forgot it makes cars.

id="house-republicans-send-mayorkas-impeachment-articles-to-senate-forcing-trial">House
Republicans send Mayorkas impeachment articles to Senate, forcing
trial</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — House impeachment managers walked two articles of
impeachment against Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas
across the Capitol to the Senate on Tuesday, forcing senators to convene
a trial on the allegations that he has “willfully and systematically”
refused to enforce immigration laws.</p>
<p>While the Senate is obligated to hold a trial under the rules of
impeachment once the charges are walked across the Capitol, the
proceedings may not last long. Democrats are expected to try to dismiss
or table the charges later this week before the full arguments get
underway.</p>
<p>Republicans have argued there should be a full trial. As Speaker Mike
Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, signed the articles Monday in
preparation for sending them across the Capitol, he said Senate Majority
Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, should convene a trial to
“hold those who engineered this crisis to full account.” </p>
<p>Schumer “is the only impediment to delivering accountability for the
American people,” Johnson said. “Pursuant to the Constitution, the House
demands a trial.”</p>
<p>Majority Democrats have said the Republicans’ case against Mayorkas
doesn’t rise to the “high crimes and misdemeanors” laid out as a bar for
impeachment in the Constitution, and Schumer likely has enough votes to
end the trial immediately if he decides to do so. The proceedings will
not begin until Wednesday.</p>
<p>Schumer has said he wants to “address this issue as expeditiously as
possible.”</p>
<p>“Impeachment should never be used to settle a policy disagreement,”
Schumer said. “That would set a horrible precedent for the
Congress.”</p>
<p>Senators will be sworn in Wednesday as jurors, turning the chamber
into the court of impeachment. The Senate will then issue a summons to
Mayorkas to inform him of the charges and ask for a written answer. He
will not have to appear in the Senate at any point.</p>
<p>What happens after that is unclear. Impeachment rules generally allow
the Senate to decide how to proceed.</p>
<p>The House narrowly voted in February to impeach Mayorkas for his
handling of the border. House Republicans charged in two articles of
impeachment that Mayorkas has not only refused to enforce existing law
but also breached the public trust by lying to Congress and saying the
border was secure. It was the first time in nearly 150 years a Cabinet
secretary was impeached.</p>
<p>Since then, Johnson has delayed sending the articles to the Senate
for weeks while both chambers finished work on government funding
legislation and took a two-week recess. Johnson had said he would send
them to the Senate last week, but punted again after Senate Republicans
said they wanted more time to prepare.</p>
<p>South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the Senate’s No. 2 Republican, has said
the Senate needs to hold a full trial where it can examine the evidence
against Mayorkas and come to a final conclusion.</p>
<p>“This is an absolute debacle at the southern border,” Thune said. “It
is a national security crisis. There needs to be accountability.”</p>
<p>House impeachment managers — members who act as prosecutors and are
appointed by the speaker — previewed some of their arguments at a
hearing with Mayorkas on Tuesday morning on President Joe Biden’s budget
request for the department.</p>
<p>House Homeland Security Chairman Mark Green, a Tennessee Republican
who is one of the managers, told the secretary that he has a duty under
the law to control and guard U.S. borders, and “during your three years
as secretary, you have failed to fulfill this oath. You have refused to
comply with the laws passed by Congress and you have breached the public
trust.”</p>
<p>Mayorkas defended the department’s efforts but said the nation’s
immigration system is “fundamentally broken, and only Congress can fix
it.”</p>
<p>Other impeachment managers are Michael McCaul of Texas, Andy Biggs of
Arizona, Ben Cline of Virginia, Andrew Garbarino of New York, Michael
Guest of Mississippi, Harriet Hageman of Wyoming, Clay Higgins of
Louisiana, Laurel Lee of Florida, August Pfluger of Texas and Marjorie
Taylor Greene of Georgia.</p>
<p>After the jurors are sworn in, Senate Republicans are likely to try
to raise a series of objections if Schumer calls a vote to dismiss or
table, an effort to both protest and delay the move. But ultimately they
cannot block a dismissal if majority Democrats have the votes.</p>
<p>Some Republicans have said they would like time to debate whether
Mayorkas should be impeached, even though debate time is usually not
included in impeachment proceedings. Negotiations were underway between
the two parties over whether Schumer may allow that time and give
senators in both parties a chance to discuss the impeachment before it
is dismissed. </p>
<p>While most Republicans oppose quick dismissal, some have hinted they
could vote with Democrats</p>
<p>Sen. Mitt Romney, a Republican representing Utah, said last week he
wasn’t sure what he would do if there were a move to dismiss the trial.
“I think it’s virtually certain that there will not be the conviction of
someone when the constitutional test has not been met,” he said.</p>
<p>At the same time, Romney said he wants to at least express his view
that “Mayorkas has done a terrible job, but he’s following the direction
of the president and has not met the constitutional test of a high crime
or misdemeanor.”</p>
<p>In any case, Republicans would not be able to win the support of the
two-thirds of the Senate that is needed to convict and remove Mayorkas
from office. Democrats control the Senate, 51-49, and they appear to be
united against the impeachment effort. Not a single House Democrat
supported it, either.</p>
<p>Sen. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat who is facing a tough reelection bid
in Ohio, called the impeachment trial a “distraction,” arguing that
Republicans should instead support a bipartisan border compromise they
scuttled earlier this year.</p>
<p>“Instead of doing this impeachment — the first one in 100 years — why
are we not doing a bipartisan border deal?” he said.</p>
<p>If Democrats are not able to dismiss or table the articles, they
could follow the precedent of several impeachment trials for federal
judges over the last century and hold a vote to create a trial committee
that would investigate the charges. While there is sufficient precedent
for this approach, Democrats may prefer to end the process completely,
especially in a presidential election year when immigration and border
security are top issues.</p>
<p>If the Senate were to proceed to an impeachment trial, it would be
the third in five years. Democrats impeached former President Donald
Trump twice, once over his dealings with Ukraine and a second time in
the days after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. The Senate
acquitted Trump both times.</p>
<p>At a trial, senators would be forced to sit in their seats for the
duration, maybe weeks, while the House impeachment managers and lawyers
representing Mayorkas make their cases. The Senate is allowed to call
witnesses, as well, if it so decides, and can ask questions of both
sides after the opening arguments are finished.</p>

id="facing-republican-revolt-house-speaker-johnson-pushes-ahead-on-us-aid-for-ukraine-israel">Facing
Republican revolt, House Speaker Johnson pushes ahead on US aid for
Ukraine, Israel</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Defiant and determined, House Speaker Mike Johnson
pushed back Tuesday against mounting Republican anger over his proposed
U.S. aid package for Ukraine, Israel and other allies, and rejected a
call to step aside or risk a vote to oust him from office.</p>
<p>“I am not resigning,” Johnson said after a testy morning meeting of
fellow House Republicans at the Capitol</p>
<p>Johnson referred to himself as a “wartime speaker” of the House and
indicated in his strongest self-defense yet he would press forward with
a U.S. national security aid package, a situation that would force him
to rely on Democrats to help pass it, over objections from his weakened
majority.</p>
<p>“We are simply here trying to do our jobs,” Johnson said, calling the
motion to oust him “absurd … not helpful.”</p>
<p>Tuesday brought a definitive shift in tone from both the House
Republicans and the speaker himself at a pivotal moment as the embattled
leader tries, against the wishes of his majority, to marshal the votes
needed to send the stalled national security aid for Israel, Ukraine and
other overseas allies to passage.</p>
<p>Johnson appeared emboldened by his meeting late last week with Donald
Trump when the Republican former president threw him a political
lifeline with a nod of support after their private talk at Trump’s
Mar-A-Lago resort in Florida. At his own press conference Tuesday,
Johnson spoke of the importance of ensuring Trump, who is now at his
criminal trial in New York, is re-elected to the White House.</p>
<p>Johnson also spoke over the weekend with President Joe Biden as well
as other congressional leaders about the emerging U.S. aid package,
which the speaker plans to move in separate votes for each section —
with bills for Ukraine, Israel, the Indo-Pacific region. He spoke about
it with Biden again late Monday.</p>
<p>It’s a complicated approach that breaks apart the Senate’s $95
billion aid package for separate votes, and then stitches it back
together for the president’s signature.</p>
<p>The approach will require the speaker to cobble together bipartisan
majorities with different factions of House Republicans and Democrats on
each measure. Additionally, Johnson is preparing a fourth measure that
would include various Republican-preferred national security priorities,
such as a plan to seize some Russian assets in U.S. banks to help fund
Ukraine and another to turn the economic aid for Ukraine into loans.</p>
<p>The plan is not an automatic deal-braker for Democrats in the House
and Senate, with leaders refraining from comment until they see the
actual text of the measure, due out later Tuesday.</p>
<p>House Republicans, however, were livid that Johnson will be leaving
their top priority — efforts to impose more security at the U.S.-Mexico
border — on the sidelines. Some predicted Johnson will not be able to
push ahead with voting on the package this week, as planned..</p>
<p>Rep. Debbie Lesko, a Republican representing Arizona, called the
morning meeting an “argument fest.”</p>
<p>She said Johnson was “most definitely’’ losing support for the plan,
but he seemed undeterred in trying to move forward despite”what the
majority of the Conference” of Republicans wanted.</p>
<p>When the speaker said the House Republicans’ priority border security
bill H.R. 2 would not be considered germane to the package, Rep. Chip
Roy, a Republican representing Texas and a chief sponsor, said it’s for
the House to determine which provisions and amendments are relevant.</p>
<p>“Things are very unresolved,” Roy said.</p>
<p>Roy said said Republicans want “to be united. They just have to be
able to figure out how to do it.”</p>
<p>The speaker faces a threat of ouster from Rep. Marjorie Taylor
Greene, a Republican representing Georgia and the top Trump ally who has
filed a motion to vacate the speaker from office in a snap vote — much
the way Republicans ousted their former speaker, Kevin McCarthy, last
fall.</p>
<p>While Greene has not said if or when she will force the issue, and
has not found much support for her plan after last year’s turmoil over
McCarthy’s exit, she drew at least one key supporter Tuesday.</p>
<p>Rep. Thomas Massie, a Republican representing Kentucky, rose in the
meeting and suggested Johnson should step aside, pointing to the example
of John Boehner, an even earlier House speaker who announced an early
resignation in 2015 rather than risk a vote to oust him, according to
Republicans in the room.</p>
<p>Johnson did not respond, according to Republicans in the room, but
told the lawmakers they have a “binary” choice” before them.</p>
<p>The speaker explained they either try to pass the package as he is
proposing or risk facing a discharge petition from Democrats that would
force a vote on their preferred package — the Senate approved measure.
But that would leave behind the extra Republican priorities.</p>

<h2 id="us-china-defense-chiefs-hold-first-call-since-2022">US, China
defense chiefs hold first call since 2022</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Pentagon — U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke with his Chinese
counterpart on Tuesday, the first dialogue between the two countries’
defense chiefs in nearly 17 months.</p>
<p>The Pentagon said Austin and Chinese Admiral Dong Jun discussed
“defense relations” and global security issues from Russia’s unprovoked
war in Ukraine to recent provocations from North Korea. A press release
said Austin stressed the importance of “respect for high seas freedom of
navigation as guaranteed under international law, especially in the
South China Sea.”</p>
<p>Beijing has asserted its desire to control access to the South China
Sea and bring Taiwan under its control, by force if necessary. President
Joe Biden has said U.S. troops would defend the democratically-run
island from attack.</p>
<p>Tensions have risen between China and U.S. ally the Philippines in
the South China Sea as well, with China’s coast guard using water
cannons this month to threaten Filipino fishing ships. China has also
used collision and ramming tactics, undersea barriers and a
military-grade laser to stop Philippine resupply and patrol
missions.</p>
<p>A senior defense official, speaking to reporters on condition of
anonymity ahead of the talks, said the call between Austin and Dong was
an “important step” in keeping lines of communication open between the
two military powers.</p>
<p>“These engagements provide us with opportunities to prevent
competition from veering into conflict by speaking candidly about our
concerns. That includes the PRC’s behavior in the South China Sea, as
well as the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait,”
said the senior defense official. PRC is the acronym for the People’s
Republic of China, the country’s official name.</p>
<p>The call marked the first time Austin has ever spoken to Dong, who
has served as China’s minister of national defense since December. It
also marked the first time that Austin has spoken at length with a PRC
counterpart since November 2022, when he met with then-Minister of
National Defense General Wei Fenghe in Cambodia.</p>
<p>China’s previous defense minister, General Li Shangfu, was subjected
to U.S. sanctions that China deemed an obstacle to having him
communicate directly with Austin. The only engagement Austin had with
General Li was a handshake at the Shangri-la dialogue in Singapore last
year.</p>
<p>The senior defense official said conversations between U.S. and
Chinese defense leaders “ensure that the PRC has a clear understanding
of our positions on all of the regional and global security issues.”</p>
<p>The talks come as the Pentagon said it had indications that a Chinese
surge of weapons technology sales to Russia is helping ramp up Moscow’s
defense production as it continues to attack its neighbor, Ukraine.</p>
<p>Pentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder told reporters in
response to a question from VOA Monday that China had sold “significant
quantities” of machine tools, microelectronics, optics, drones and
cruise missile technology to Russia, which Moscow is using to make
propellants for weapons.</p>
<p>“So this support is actively enabling Russia’s war in Ukraine and
poses a significant threat to security — international security,” Ryder
added.</p>
<p>The Associated Press reported on Friday that two senior Biden
administration officials said that about 90% of Russia’s
microelectronics in 2023 and nearly 70% of Russia’s machine tool imports
in the last quarter of 2023 came from China. Russia used that technology
to make missiles, tanks and aircraft.</p>
<p>Chinese and Russian entities have jointly produced drones inside
Russia, and China-based companies are providing optical components for
use in Russian tanks and armored vehicles, the officials also told
AP.</p>
<p>The call between Austin and Dong is the latest in a series of recent
conversations between U.S. and Chinese defense leaders. The top U.S.
general, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. C.Q. Brown, spoke
with his Chinese military counterpart in December.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the U.S. and Chinese militaries held
working-level Military Maritime Consultative Agreement talks in Hawaii
for the first time since 2021.</p>

id="under-biden-us-reimagines-asian-alliances-as-lattice-fence">Under
Biden, US reimagines Asian alliances as ‘lattice’ fence</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Seoul, South Korea — For decades, U.S. policy in Asia has relied on
what was informally known as the “hub and spokes” system of bilateral
alliances. But lately, U.S. officials have used another analogy to
describe their vision for the region: a lattice fence.</p>
<p>It may sound like only a metaphorical tweak, but officials in the
administration of U.S. President Joe Biden say it could have big
implications, as they try to create a durable plan to respond to China’s
growing power.</p>
<p>Under the old framework, the United States, the global military
superpower, acted as the hub and its Asian allies, such as Japan, South
Korea, and the Philippines, served as spokes.</p>
<p>Spokes are not linked to each other. But that dynamic is changing, as
several major U.S. allies and partners coalesce around what they have
come to call a “free and open Indo-Pacific.”</p>
<p>What U.S. officials envision is not a multilateral treaty alliance
like NATO. Analysts have long said such a security framework is
impossible in Asia, given competing interests and deep historical
animosities, even among U.S. allies.</p>
<p>Instead, the goal is to help create an expanding number of mutually
reinforcing links between like-minded countries, which together form a
barrier – or in other words, a lattice.</p>
<p>Trilateral summit</p>
<p>The lattice strategy was on display last week, when Biden hosted
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Philippine President Ferdinand
Marcos Jr. for their countries’ first ever trilateral summit.</p>
<p>The meeting had important symbolic value. A joint statement expressed
“serious concerns” about China’s behavior in the East and South China
Seas, where China is trying to push its territorial claims over those of
Japan and the Philippines.</p>
<p>The United States and Japan also pledged further assistance for the
Philippines’ military modernization efforts and vowed to continue
expanding joint military drills in the region, which have involved a
growing number of partners in recent years.</p>
<p>At a separate meeting between Biden and Kishida, the United States
and Japan announced dozens of bilateral deals related to defense
cooperation, including plans to allow U.S. and Japanese forces to work
more closely during a potential conflict.</p>
<p>According to a U.S. administration official who spoke to reporters
during a background briefing, the meetings are evidence that Biden’s
Asia plan is working.</p>
<p>“(Biden’s) theory of case was that if the United States reinvested in
its alliances and partnerships in the Indo-Pacific … those allies and
partners would step up alongside in ways that made us much better
equipped to accomplish our objectives,” the U.S. official said.</p>
<p>Nowhere is this theory better proven, the official added, than in the
U.S. alliance with Japan, where Kishida “has stepped up and stepped out
into the world more than anyone really could have imagined.”</p>
<p>Japan a key player</p>
<p>As Japan loosens its self-imposed pacifist restraints, the country
has become a major player in regional security. Japan has dramatically
increased defense spending, moved to acquire missiles that can hit other
countries, and enacted legal changes allowing it to more easily export
weapons.</p>
<p>Japan is now heavily involved in many U.S.-led forums, including the
Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, an informal coalition that also
includes Australia and India, and the Group of Seven advanced economies,
which has increasingly focused on China.</p>
<p>Last week, Britain, the United States, and Australia announced they
are considering cooperation with Japan through their AUKUS security
pact. NATO, the European military alliance, has also expanded
cooperation with Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand.</p>
<p>“Today’s Japan is no longer the timid and inward-looking nation that
counted on its embrace of pacifism and on American muscle to insulate it
from external threats,” said Daniel Russel, a vice president at the Asia
Society and a former top Asia official at the State Department. </p>
<p>One of the most crucial regional developments is the improvement of
Japan-South Korea relations, which have long been strained because of
issues related to Japan’s colonial occupation of Korea. Under South
Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, the two countries now regularly
participate in military drills with the United States. Last year, the
three countries unveiled a new system for sharing North Korean missile
warning data in real-time.</p>
<p>But will it work?</p>
<p>Few observers deny that big changes are occurring, as countries
respond to a more powerful China. But the strategic shift toward the
United States is far from unanimous.</p>
<p>“Most governments in the region are hedging, recognizing the reality
that China is a permanent and central feature of (the) Asian political
economy,” said Van Jackson, who teaches at New Zealand’s Victoria
University of Wellington.</p>
<p>According to a survey released this month by the Singapore-based
ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, Southeast Asian perceptions of the United
States have worsened over the past year.</p>
<p>The State of Southeast Asia survey asks the same questions every year
to a group of experts and government officials.</p>
<p>More than half, 51%, of Southeast Asian respondents said they would
side with China over the United States if they were forced to choose. It
is the first time that the survey has shown a preference for China. </p>
<p>One of the key complaints, according to the poll, is skepticism about
U.S. economic engagement. Following then-President Donald Trump’s 2017
withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade agreement, many
in Asia have questioned whether the United States is as committed as it
once was to free trade.  </p>
<p>Biden officials dispute that notion, touting the Indo-Pacific
Economic Framework or IPEF, as a counterweight to China’s economic
clout. But IPEF differs from traditional free trade deals in that it
does not provide greater market access or reduce tariffs — areas no
longer seen as safe in a U.S. domestic political context. Regardless,
Trump has vowed to kill IPEF if he defeats Biden in November’s
presidential election.</p>
<p>In the opinion of Philip Turner, a former New Zealand diplomat, IPEF
appears to have largely failed.</p>
<p>“Many Asian countries and regional players like Australia and New
Zealand have pointed out that the U.S. failure to commit economically to
the region undercuts its claims to regional leadership,” said Turner,
who most recently served as New Zealand’s ambassador to South Korea.</p>
<p>While there are increasing regional worries about China’s rise and
behavior, few if any Asian countries support efforts to contain China’s
growth, Turner added.</p>
<p>“They would prefer the U.S. climb down from its high horse of
economic coercion against China and find ways of getting on with each
other short of conflict,” he said.</p>

id="from-titanic-travelers-to-textile-tycoons-arab-americans-have-long-been-part-of-the-american-story">From
Titanic travelers to textile tycoons, Arab Americans have long been part
of the American story</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Dearborn, Michigan — All About America explores American culture,
politics, trends, history, ideals and places of interest.</p>
<p>The term slacks, meaning pants worn during relaxation activities, was
coined by an Arab American. Joseph Haggar, a Lebanese immigrant, founded
the iconic Haggar men’s clothing brand in 1926.</p>
<p>“He settled in Texas, and he started this pant company that was
extremely successful in the 20th century,” says Diana Abouali, director
of the Arab American National Museum in Dearborn, Michigan. “He also
revolutionized the way that pants and clothing were mass produced.”</p>
<p>An exhibit at the museum is dedicated to Haggar, whose pants were
worn by U.S. President Lyndon Johnson. Stories like Haggar’s are
integral to the museum’s mission to demonstrate how Arab Americans have
been part of the American fabric since the late 19th century.</p>
<p>“We communicate the American narrative in the voices of Arab
Americans. They express their experiences in their own words,” Abouali
says. “This provides people with a more authentic and real
representation of what it means to be Arab American.”</p>
<p>The museum attempts to share the full range of the Arab American
experience, including the journey to America, home and work life, and
service in the U.S. Armed Forces.</p>
<p>The diverse offerings include an exhibit about the hundreds of Syrian
and Lebanese immigrants who owned homesteads in North Dakota between
1890 and World War I. Thousands of descendants of those pioneers still
live in North Dakota. Another exhibit includes lists of Arab American
passengers on the doomed Titanic, which sank in 1912.</p>
<p>The museum also challenges religious misconceptions.</p>
<p>“Half of the Arab American community is Christian,” Abouali says.
“And in fact, the earlier immigrants, who came in the late 19th century,
early 20th century, were predominantly Christian.”</p>
<p>A wall of fame highlights prominent Arab Americans like journalist
Helen Thomas, actress Kathy Najimy, politicians like former U.S.
Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala, and Candace
Lightner, who founded Mothers Against Drunk Driving in 1980.</p>
<p>Arab immigrant stories aren’t well-known among mainstream America.
And what little Americans do know about Arabs is often informed by
negative stereotypes.</p>
<p>“The obvious one would be the angry Arab, the terrorist Arab, the
being afraid of the Arab that comes from abroad. I think that’s the very
obvious one, but it’s a bit overplayed,” says Jasmine Hawamdeh, director
of arts and culture at the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee,
a civil rights advocacy group. “And I think one of the more harmful
stereotypes that currently exists in American media is the oppressed
Arab woman.”</p>
<p>The museum tries to correct false narratives about Arab
Americans.</p>
<p>“We’re not always responding to misconceptions and narrative,
although that’s a major part of our work and a major sort of impetus for
creating a museum like this,” Abouali says, “but also we’re sort of
presenting ourselves, as we are, unapologetically.”</p>
<p>Arab Americans are a diverse community that come from 22 Arab
countries stretching from northern Africa to western Asia. But once they
settle in the U.S., the museum director says, they become as American as
they are Arab.</p>

against Trump and January 6 rioters at stake as Supreme Court hears
debate over obstruction law</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Tuesday is taking up the first of
two cases that could affect the criminal prosecution of former President
Donald Trump for his efforts to overturn his election loss in 2020.
Hundreds of charges stemming from the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot are
also at stake. </p>
<p>The justices are hearing arguments over the charge of obstruction of
an official proceeding. That charge, stemming from a law passed in the
aftermath of the Enron financial scandal more than two decades ago, has
been brought against 330 people, according to the Justice Department.
The court will consider whether it can be used against those who
disrupted Congress’ certification of Joe Biden’s 2020 presidential
election victory over Trump. </p>
<p>The former president and presumptive nominee for the 2024 Republican
nomination is facing two charges in the case brought by special counsel
Jack Smith in Washington that could be knocked out with a favorable
ruling from the nation’s highest court. Next week, the justices will
hear arguments over whether Trump has “absolute immunity” from
prosecution in the case, a proposition that has so far been rejected by
two lower courts. </p>
<p>The first former U.S. president under indictment, Trump is on trial
on hush money charges in New York and also has been charged with
election interference in Georgia and with mishandling classified
documents in Florida. </p>
<p>In Tuesday’s case, the court is hearing an appeal from Joseph
Fischer, a former Pennsylvania police officer who has been indicted on
seven counts, including obstruction, for his actions on Jan. 6, 2021,
when a mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol in a bid to keep
Biden, a Democrat, from taking the White House. Lawyers for Fischer
argue that the charge doesn’t cover his conduct. </p>
<p>The obstruction charge, which carries up to 20 years behind bars, is
among the most widely used felony charges brought in the massive federal
prosecution following the deadly insurrection. </p>
<p>Roughly 170 January 6 defendants have been convicted of obstructing
or conspiring to obstruct the January 6 joint session of Congress,
including the leaders of two far-right extremist groups, the Proud Boys
and Oath Keepers. A number of defendants have had their sentencings
delayed until after the justices rule on the matter. </p>
<p>Some rioters have even won early release from prison while the appeal
is pending over concerns that they might end up serving longer than they
should have if the Supreme Court rules against the Justice Department.
That includes Kevin Seefried, a Delaware man who threatened a Black
police officer with a pole attached to a Confederate battle flag as he
stormed the Capitol. Seefried was sentenced last year to three years
behind bars, but a judge recently ordered that he be released one year
into his prison term while awaiting the Supreme Court’s ruling. </p>
<p>The high court case focuses on whether the anti-obstruction provision
of a law that was enacted in 2002 in response to the financial scandal
that brought down Enron Corp. can be used against January 6
defendants. </p>
<p>Fischer’s lawyers argue that the provision was meant to close a
loophole in criminal law and discourage the destruction of records in
response to an investigation. Until the Capitol riot, they told the
court, every criminal case using the provision had involved allegations
of destroying or otherwise manipulating records. </p>
<p>But the administration says the other side is reading the law too
narrowly, arguing it serves “as a catchall offense designed to ensure
complete coverage of all forms of corrupt obstruction of an official
proceeding,” including Fischer’s “alleged conduct in joining a violent
riot to disrupt the joint session of Congress certifying the
presidential election results.” </p>
<p>Smith has argued separately in the immunity case that the obstruction
charges against Trump are valid, no matter the outcome of Fischer’s
case. </p>
<p>Most lower court judges who have weighed in have allowed the charge
to stand. Among them, U.S. District Judge Dabney Friedrich, a Trump
appointee, wrote that “statutes often reach beyond the principal evil
that animated them.” </p>
<p>But U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols, another Trump appointee,
dismissed the charge against Fischer and two other defendants, writing
that prosecutors went too far. A divided panel of the federal appeals
court in Washington reinstated the charge before the Supreme Court
agreed to take up the case. </p>
<p>While it’s not important to the Supreme Court case, the two sides
present starkly differing accounts of Fischer’s actions on January 6.
Fischer’s lawyers say he “was not part of the mob” that forced lawmakers
to flee the House and Senate chambers, noting that he entered the
Capitol after Congress had recessed. The weight of the crowd pushed
Fischer into a line of police inside, they said in a court filing. </p>
<p>Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Representatives Jim Jordan of
Ohio, Lauren Boebert of Colorado, Matt Gaetz of Florida and Marjorie
Taylor Greene of Georgia are among 23 Republican members of Congress who
say the administration’s use of the obstruction charge “presents an
intolerable risk of politicized prosecutions. Only a clear rebuke from
this Court will stop the madness.” </p>
<p>The Justice Department says Fischer can be heard on a video yelling
“Charge!” before he pushed through a crowd and “crashed into the police
line.” Prosecutors also cite text messages Fischer sent before January 6
saying things might turn violent and social media posts after the riot
in which he wrote, “we pushed police back about 25 feet.” </p>
<p>More than 1,350 people have been charged with Capitol riot-related
federal crimes. Approximately 1,000 of them have pleaded guilty or been
convicted by a jury or judge after a trial.</p>

printer hack of Windows 95</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-16, from: OS News</p>
<p>During my daily web crawl I encountered a very interesting gif that I
haven’t seen in a long time. It was a hack of an unspecified version of
Windows 95, which showed how to bypass the login screen with the help of
the menu and printing dialog. However, after a brief check, I found a
fair amount of people stating that “just hitting the cancel” button
would do the same. Sharp-eyed viewers would notice that it was the very
first action taken in the picture. In order to find out if the hack is
real at all, I decided to reproduce it and document it for the good of
the internet. ↫ David Polakovic So this hack is actually a lot more
involved than I thought it was going to be, and yet, it still feels
utterly insane that operating systems were this easy to get into,
passwords were this easy to decrypt, and security settings were this
trivial to disable. Anyway, the gif is sort-of real, in that yes, you
can ‘hack’ Windows 95’s login security through the printing and help
subsystems. Things were different back then, man. I vaguely remember
that my high school used to lock us out of the desktop, File Explorer,
the Control Panel, and so on, making it impossible for us to access DOS
or the games built into Windows 9x. I don’t remember the exact things we
used to do, but most of us were aware and used several different methods
of bypassing the school lockdowns just to mess around. We never did
anything malicious – this is pre-internet, and we just wanted to play
some Solitaire or Pinball – but anybody with malicious intent surely
could’ve.</p>

<p>New TVs that launch with Android TV 14 or later on Linux kernel 5.15
or higher will be required to meet Google’s Generic Kernel Image (GKI)
requirements in order to pass certification! This means that GKI is now
enforced on all major Android form factors with AArch64 chipsets:
handhelds, watches, automotive, &amp; televisions. ↫ Mishaal Rahman What
this means is that all the major Android form factors will be running
kernels that adhere to the GKI requirements, which means SoC and board
support is not part of the core kernel, but instead achieved through
loadable modules. This should, in theory, make it easier to provide
long-term support.</p>

<li>Life cycle analysis will ‘jeopardize global climate goals,’
researcher warns
</h3>
<p>
Life cycle analysis — the process of measuring all emissions related to
a given product or service throughout every phase of its life — has long
been the foundation of the climate economy. But in a new paper, Arizona
State University climate scientist Stephanie Arcusa claims we’re
“kid[ding] ourselves thinking that we’re going to have numbers that we
can hang our hats on.”
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/life-cycle-analysis-study" target="_self"><u>Speaking
with Heatmap’s Emily Pontecorvo</u></a>, Arcusa elaborated that the
impossibility of collecting all the data necessary for life cycle
analysis leads us to get “so far away from reality that we can’t
actually tell if something is positive or negative in the end.” As she
explains:
</p>
<blockquote>
<em><em>[…It’s] almost entirely subjective, which makes one LCA
incomparable to another LCA depending on the context, depending on the
technology. And yes, there are some standardization efforts that have
been going on for decades. But if you have a ruler, no matter how much
you try, it’s not going to become a screwdriver. We’re trying to use
this tool to quantify things and make them the same for comparison, and
we can’t because of that subjectivity.<br/> </em></em>

<li>Frontrunner in Mexico’s presidential election plans nearly $14
billion in energy projects
</h3>
<p>
Former Mexico City mayor and leading Mexican presidential nominee
Claudia Sheinbaum on Monday outlined a plan to invest $13.57 billion in
new energy infrastructure and modernization through 2030,
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mexico-presidential-frontrunner-pledges-136-billion-energy-investments-2024-04-16/?utm_source=cbnewsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_term=2024-04-16&utm_campaign=Daily+Briefing+16+04+2024" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>Reuters</em></em></u><u>

solar generation, updating hydroelectric plants, and adding miles of new
transmission lines, and notably sets her apart from current President
Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who has been criticized for
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mexico-presidents-ex-finance-minister-slams-government-energy-policies-2023-10-27/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>pouring
billions</u></a> into propping up the state oil and gas company,
Petroleos Mexicanos.
</p>
<p>
Sheinbaum’s proposal would not completely abandon fossil fuels, calling
for new gas-burning plants as well. But she described it as “the
possibility and potential to develop Mexico in a way that generates
investment with well-being” and “at the same time … does not have to
negatively impact the environment.” Sheinbaum said the proposal would
add 13.7 gigawatts of electricity to the grid by 2030.

You’ve probably already heard about
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/why-is-the-atlantic-ocean-so-hot" target="_self"><u>the
ocean’s crazy heat</u></a>. However, cold water “killer events” are
causing mass mortality for marine life, too,
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-024-01966-8" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a

found.
</p>
<p>
The researchers report that “climate-change-driven shifts in ocean
currents and pressure systems” are increasing and intensifying instances
of “upwelling,” when deep, frigid water is pushed to the surface. Such
events imperil migratory species like bull sharks, which attempt to
avoid colder areas by swimming outside their normal routes or closer to
the ocean’s surface. “You’d think they would have swum away but they got
squeezed” by the upwellings, Ryan Daly, one of the authors,

<p>
Quilt, a climate tech startup banking on the appeal of sleeker, smarter
electric heat pumps, announced today that its products will be available
to order in the Bay Area starting May 15.<br/>
</p>
<p>
I first
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/heat-pump-gradient-quilt-electric-air" target="_self"><u>wrote
about Quilt</u></a> a year ago after the company raised a $9 million
seed round. Its founders told me they wanted to create the Tesla of heat
pumps — a climate-friendly product that prevails because of its superior
design and performance, with sustainability as a bonus.
</p>
<p>
“That’s the only way you win, right?” Paul Lambert, Quilt’s CEO said
when I visited the company’s office in Redwood City, California, last
summer. “You almost need, like, this Trojan horse. You need to be able
to convince people who are skeptical. It needs to be better on its own
merits.”
</p>
<p>
Conventional heaters generate warmth by burning fuel, whereas heat pumps
transfer it using electricity. They come in two main form factors: a
central system, which conditions the air throughout a building via ducts
and vents, with machinery that can be hidden away in the attic or
basement; and a mini-split, a room-by-room solution that typically looks
like a white, oblong, plastic box mounted on the wall. Quilt is
redesigning the latter.
</p>
<p>
The company won’t release full product images until the launch in May,
but a new teaser released today shows a mini-split peeking from the edge
of the frame with blonde wood paneling to match the wood of other
furniture in the room.

The company also revamped the outdoor component of the mini-split, which
typically looks like an industrial metal fan.

<p>
Quilt just closed a $33 million series A funding round led by climate
venture heavyweights Energy Impact Partners and Galvanize Climate
Solutions, which will help get it through its launch and initial
expansion.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The company is promising a lot — not just a more customizable and
aesthetically pleasing product, but also improvements on efficiency and
comfort, smarter software, and a better customer experience beginning
with the point of purchase. Quilt is limiting its launch to the Bay Area
because that’s “where the bulk of our team is on the ground to support
homeowners through the purchase, install, and rebate process,” Lambert
told me in an email this week. “Los Angeles will follow soon after and
then we’ll use our waitlist to guide our expansion.” He said there were
already thousands of interested homeowners on the waitlist.
</p>
<p>
Though there’s certainly evidence that homeowners want a nicer looking
product and an
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/heat-pumps-green-bank" target="_self"><u>easier
installation experience</u></a>, the biggest hurdle to heat pump
adoption is that they are far more expensive than natural gas heating
systems. Lambert wasn’t ready to share how much the system would cost,
but promised it would be “priced competitively and transparently.”
</p>
<p>
At such a small scale, it’s likely that Quilt will join the ranks of
other luxury decarb products, like the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/impulse-labs-cooktop-sam-damico-induction-stove" target="_self"><u>Impulse
Labs induction stove</u></a> — at least to start. But the company has
high hopes. “Our goal is to get Quilt into as many homes as possible to
supercharge the clean energy transition and to meet rising demand for a
smart, intuitive, design-forward heat pump,” Lambert said.

id="pro-palestinian-demonstrators-shut-down-highways-and-bridges-in-major-us-cities">Pro-Palestinian
demonstrators shut down highways and bridges in major US cities</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CHICAGO — Pro-Palestinian demonstrators blocked roadways in Illinois,
California, New York and the Pacific Northwest on Monday, temporarily
shutting down travel into some of the nation’s most heavily used
airports, onto the Golden Gate and Brooklyn bridges and on a busy West
Coast highway.</p>
<p>In Chicago, protesters linked arms and blocked lanes of Interstate
190 leading into O’Hare International Airport around 7 a.m. in a
demonstration they said was part of a global “economic blockade to free
Palestine,” according to Rifqa Falaneh, one of the organizers.</p>
<p>Traffic in the San Francisco Bay Area was snarled for hours as
demonstrators shut down all vehicle, pedestrian and bike traffic on the
Golden Gate Bridge and chained themselves to 55-gallon drums filled with
cement across Interstate 880 in Oakland. Protesters marching into
Brooklyn blocked Manhattan-bound traffic on the Brooklyn Bridge. In
Eugene, Oregon, protesters blocked Interstate 5, shutting down traffic
on the major highway for about 45 minutes.</p>
<p>Protesters say they chose O’Hare in part because it is one of the
largest airports. Among other things, they’ve called for an immediate
cease-fire in the war between Israel and Hamas.</p>
<p>Anti- war protesters have demonstrated in Chicago near daily since
Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel that killed around 1,200 people.
Israeli warplanes and ground troops have since conducted a
scorched-earth campaign on the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>The Israeli offensive has killed more than 33,700 Palestinians,
according to the Gaza health ministry. The ministry does not
differentiate between civilians and combatants in its count but says
women and children make up two-thirds of the dead.</p>
<p>O’Hare warned travelers on the social platform X to take alternative
forms of transportation with car travel “substantially delayed this
morning due to protest activity.”</p>
<p>Some travelers stuck in standstill traffic left their cars and walked
the final leg to the airport along the freeway, trailing their luggage
behind them.</p>
<p>Among them was Madeline Hannan from suburban Chicago. She was headed
to O’Hare for a work trip to Florida when her and her husband’s car
ended up stalled for 20 minutes. She got out and “both ran and speed
walked” more than 1.6 kilometers (1 mile). She said she made it to the
gate on time, but barely.</p>
<p>“This was an inconvenience,” she said in a telephone interview from
Florida. “But in the grand scheme of things going on overseas, it’s a
minor inconvenience.”</p>
<p>While individual travelers may have been affected, operations at the
airport appeared near normal with delays of under 15 minutes, according
to the Chicago Department of Aviation.</p>
<p>Inbound traffic toward O’Hare resumed around 9 a.m.</p>
<p>Near Seattle, the Washington State Department of Transportation said
a demonstration closed the main road to Seattle-Tacoma International
Airport. Social media posts showed people holding a banner and waving
Palestinian flags while standing on the highway, which reopened about
three hours later.</p>
<p>About 20 protesters were arrested at the Golden Gate Bridge
demonstration and traffic resumed shortly after noon, according to the
California Highway Patrol. The agency said officers were making arrests
at two points on the interstate, including one spot where roughly 300
protesters refused orders to disperse,</p>
<p>“Attempting to block or shut down a freeway or state highway to
protest is unlawful, dangerous, and prevents motorists from safely
reaching their destinations,” the agency said in a statement.</p>
<p>Oregon State Police said 52 protestors were were arrested for
disorderly conduct following the Interstate 5 protest in Eugene, Oregon,
about 177 kilometers (110 miles) south of Portland. Six vehicles were
towed from the scene.</p>
<p>New York Police made numerous arrests, saying 150 protesters were
initially involved in the march around 3:15 p.m., but that number
quickly grew. The bridge was fully reopened by 5 p.m.</p>
<p>In Chicago, dozens of protesters were arrested, according to Falaneh.
Chicago police said Monday that “multiple people” were taken into
custody after a protest where people obstructed traffic, but they did
not have a detailed count.</p>

id="maui-fire-department-to-release-after-action-report-on-deadly-hawaii-wildfires">Maui
Fire Department to release after-action report on deadly Hawaii
wildfires</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>HONOLULU — The Maui Fire Department is expected to release a report
Tuesday detailing how the agency responded to a series of wildfires that
burned on the island during a windstorm last August — including one that
killed 101 people in the historic town of Lahaina and became the
deadliest U.S. wildfire in more than a century.</p>
<p>The release comes one day before the Hawaii Attorney General is
expected to release the first phase of a separate comprehensive
investigation about the events before, during and after the Aug. 8
fires.</p>
<p>The reports could help officials understand exactly what happened
when the wind-whipped fire overtook the historic Maui town of Lahaina,
destroying roughly 3,000 properties and causing more than $5.5 billion
in estimated damage, according to state officials.</p>
<p>The Western Fire Chiefs Association produced the after-action report
for the Maui Fire Department. After-action reports are frequently used
by military organizations, emergency response agencies, government
entities and even companies to help identify the strengths and
weaknesses of the organization’s response to an emergency.</p>
<p>A similar after-action report was released by the Maui Police
Department in February. It included 32 recommendations to improve the
law enforcement agency’s response to future tragedies, including that
the department obtain better equipment and that it station a
high-ranking officer in the island’s communications center during
emergencies.</p>
<p>Hawaiian Electric has acknowledged that one of its power lines fell
and caused a fire in Lahaina the morning of Aug. 8, but the utility
company denies that the morning fire caused the flames that burned
through the town later that day. But dozens of lawsuits filed by
survivors and victims’ families claim otherwise, saying entities like
Hawaiian Electric, Maui County, large property owners or others should
be held responsible for the damage caused by the inferno.</p>
<p>Many of the factors that contributed to the disaster are already
known: Strong winds from a hurricane passing far offshore had downed
power lines and blown off parts of rooftops, and debris blocked roads
throughout Lahaina. Later those same winds rained embers and whipped
flames through the heart of the town.</p>
<p>The vast majority of the county’s fire crews were already tied up
fighting other wildfires on a different part of the island, their
efforts sometimes hindered by a critical loss of water pressure after
the winds knocked out electricity for the water pumps normally used to
load firefighting tanks and reservoirs. County officials have
acknowledged that a lack of backup power for critical pumps made it
significantly harder for crews to battle the Upcountry fires.</p>
<p>A small firefighting team was tasked with handling any outbreaks in
Lahaina. That crew brought the morning fire under control and even
declared it extinguished, then broke for lunch. By the time they
returned, flames had erupted in the same area and were quickly moving
into a major subdivision. The fire in Lahaina burned so hot that
thousands of water pipes melted, making it unlikely that backup power
for pumps would have made a significant impact.</p>
<p>Cellphone and internet service was also down in the area, so it was
difficult for some to call for help or to get information about the
spreading fire — including any evacuation announcements. And emergency
officials did not use Hawaii’s extensive network of emergency sirens to
warn Lahaina residents.</p>
<p>The high winds made it hard at times for first responders to
communicate on their radios, and 911 operators and emergency dispatchers
were overwhelmed with hundreds of calls.</p>
<p>Police and electricity crews tried to direct people away from roads
that were partially or completely blocked by downed power lines.
Meanwhile, people trying to flee burning neighborhoods packed the few
thoroughfares leading in and out of town.</p>
<p>The traffic jam left some trapped in their cars when the fire
overtook them. Others who were close to the ocean jumped into the choppy
waters to escape the flames.</p>

<h2
id="ukraine-israel-aid-to-hit-us-house-floor-as-separate-bills-soon">Ukraine,
Israel aid to hit US House floor as separate bills soon</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. House of Representatives will consider aid to
Israel and Ukraine as separate legislation this week, Republican Speaker
Mike Johnson said on Monday, more than two months after the Senate
passed a bill combining the two.</p>
<p>Leaving a meeting of House Republicans on Monday evening, Johnson
said the narrowly divided chamber would consider four bills altogether
that would also include aid to Taiwan, U.S. allies in the Indo-Pacific
and U.S. national security priorities.</p>
<p>“We know that the world is watching us to see how we react,” Johnson
told reporters. “They’re watching to see if America will stand up for
its allies and in our own interest around the globe. And we will.”</p>
<p>U.S. aid has been delayed by Johnson’s unwillingness to consider a
$95 billion bipartisan bill the Senate passed in February, including $14
billion for Israel as well as $60 billion for Ukraine.</p>
<p>Also included were billions to strengthen allies in the Indo-Pacific,
where China is becoming more assertive, and for international
humanitarian aid.</p>
<p>Johnson said the new House bills provide roughly the same amount of
foreign aid as the Senate bill but would include differences including
some aid in the form of a loan.</p>
<p>Republicans aim to release legislative text as early as Tuesday
morning but will observe a 72-hour review period before voting. Johnson
said votes on passage could come late on Friday.</p>
<p>The push to pass the aid gained urgency after Iran’s weekend missile
and drone attack on Israel despite fierce opposition in the deeply
divided Congress.</p>
<p>Three of the four bills Johnson suggested would cover Ukraine, Israel
and the Indo-Pacific. The makeup of the fourth was not immediately
clear.</p>
<p>Backers had insisted the broad foreign aid measure passed with 70%
support in the Senate would have received similar support in the House.
However, Johnson had given a variety of reasons to delay, among them the
need to focus taxpayer dollars on domestic issues and reluctance to take
up a Senate measure without more information.</p>
<p>Johnson also faces a threat from a hard-right Republicans to oust him
as speaker if he allows the Ukraine aid to move ahead. Many on the
right, especially those closely allied with former President Donald
Trump, who has been skeptical of assisting Kyiv in its fight against
Russia, fiercely oppose sending billions more dollars to Ukraine.</p>
<p>The House Freedom Caucus - a group of Republican hardliners with
about three dozen members - released a statement on Monday calling for
aid to Israel, but not to Ukraine, and rejecting as “bogus” any
suggestion that the attack on Israel should help ease the path toward
more funds for Kyiv.</p>
<p>Representative Andy Biggs, a Freedom Caucus member, told reporters he
liked the idea of separate bills, but had to see them before committing
to voting for them.</p>
<p>Defense industry watching</p>
<p>The issue is closely watched by industry. U.S. defense contractors
could be in line for huge contracts to supply equipment for Ukraine and
other U.S. partners if the additional funding passes. Aid supporters
stress that approving the Ukraine bill would create many American
jobs.</p>
<p>The White House has been pushing Johnson to allow a vote, as have
Senate Republicans and Democrats. “If House Republicans put the Senate
supplemental (spending bill) on the floor, I believe it would pass
today, reach the president’s desk tonight and Israel would get the aid
it needs by tomorrow,” Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said in
the Senate on Monday.</p>
<p>Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell told his fellow lawmakers:
“It’s also time for Congress to deliver the urgent investments that our
industrial base, our forces, and our partners will need to meet and
out-compete the growing and linked threats we face.”</p>
<p>The top House Democrat, Representative Hakeem Jeffries, sent a letter
to his caucus on Monday spelling out the need to support Ukraine as well
as Israel.</p>
<p>“The gravely serious events of this past weekend in the Middle East
and Eastern Europe underscore the need for Congress to act immediately.
We must take up the bipartisan and comprehensive national security bill
passed by the Senate forthwith,” Jeffries wrote.</p>
<p>Ukraine appealed again to allies on Monday for “extraordinary and
bold steps” to supply air defenses to help defend against waves of
Russian airstrikes that have targeted its energy system in recent
weeks.</p>

<h2 id="biden-meets-iraqi-pm-amid-escalating-mideast-tensions-1">Biden
meets Iraqi PM amid escalating Mideast tensions</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>White House — As U.S. President Joe Biden hosted Iraq’s prime
minister Monday, all eyes were on Iran, which over the weekend made a
historic first strike on Israel.</p>
<p>That attack has inflamed concerns of a wider regional war — a
situation that effectively eclipsed the leaders’ already-planned Oval
Office meeting, where they wanted to discuss their mutual fight against
Islamic State, economic issues and Iraq’s progress toward energy
independence and modernization.</p>
<p>“The two leaders reaffirmed their commitment to the enduring
strategic partnership between Iraq and the United States, and discussed
their visions for comprehensive bilateral cooperation under the 2008
U.S.-Iraq Strategic Framework Agreement,” the two leaders said in a
joint statement after Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani met with
Biden.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, White House officials disputed reports that Iran delivered
a clear warning before the strike. White House national security
spokesperson John Kirby called such reports “nonsense.”</p>
<p>“Can you imagine a world in which Iran would pick up the phone and
say, ‘Hey, we’re about to try to schwack Israel with 300 cruise missiles
and drones. We just wanted to let you know it’s coming. And oh, by the
way, here’s what we’re going to hit.’”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” he said. “It just didn’t happen.”</p>
<p>He stressed that Israel’s response is “an Israeli decision to make,”
and “we’re going to leave it squarely with them.”</p>
<p>Even though the United States is describing Iran’s aerial assault as
a failure, Iraq’s leader acknowledged that the conflict between Israel
and Hamas is of major concern in the region.</p>
<p>“We are actually very eager about stopping this war, which claimed
the lives of thousands of civilians, women and children,” Sudani said,
sitting beside Biden in the Oval Office. “And we encourage all the
efforts about stopping the expansion of the area of conflict.”</p>
<p>The two nations have a delicate relationship after decades of U.S.
military involvement in Iraq. U.S. anti-aircraft assets in northern Iraq
were used to shoot down some of the Iranian missiles.</p>
<p>Biden said Iraq has a role to play in maintaining peace.</p>
<p>“Simply put, our partnership is pivotal for our nations, for the
Middle East, and I believe, for the world,” he said.</p>
<p>Earlier Monday, Sudani’s deputy met with U.S. Secretary of State
Antony Blinken, where both men hailed the regional cooperation that
thwarted the attack and urged de-escalation.</p>
<p>“I think what this weekend demonstrated is that Israel did not have
to and does not have to defend itself alone when it is the victim of an
aggression, the victim of an attack,” Blinken said.</p>
<p>“In the 36 hours since, we have been coordinating a diplomatic
response to seek to prevent escalation.”</p>
<p>“We call on all parties for self-restraint and respect the rules and
also international norms that we set,” said Muhammad Ali Tamim, Iraq’s
deputy prime minister.</p>
<p>The two leaders announced a raft of bilateral measures Monday, but
none directly referenced Iran.</p>
<p>“The President and Prime Minister agreed on the importance of working
together to advance regional stability and reinforce and respect Iraqi
sovereignty, stability, and security,” their joint statement said.</p>
<p>The other agreements centered on the priorities the Biden
administration outlined in March ahead of the visit: energy
independence, regional security and the “lasting defeat of ISIS.”</p>
<p>But analysts say Baghdad should seize every diplomatic opportunity to
seek peace.</p>
<p>“Iraq needs to make its preference for reduced escalation clear,”
Daniel Byman, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, told VOA on Zoom. “And that’s both talking to the
Iranians, but also talking to other Arab states and talking to the
United States, that this is negative from Iraq’s point of view, and that
it wants all the powers to take responsible action to try to reduce
escalation.”</p>
<p>As Israel mulls its response, regional actors are not sitting still.
On Monday, Iraq’s president met with King Abdullah II of Jordan.
According to Jordan’s royal court, they spoke about the dangers of this
conflict escalating further.</p>

GHC 9.6.5 is now available
</h1>
<h4 class="text-muted">
Zubin Duggal - 2024-04-16
</h4>
<p>
The GHC developers are happy to announce the availability of GHC 9.6.5.
Binary distributions, source distributions, and documentation are
available on the <a href="/download_ghc_9_6_5.html">release page</a>.
</p>
<p>
This release is primarily a bugfix release addressing some issues found
in the 9.6 series. These include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Bumping the bundled <code>process</code> library to 1.6.19.0 to avoid a
potential
<a href="https://github.com/haskell/security-advisories/blob/main/advisories/hackage/process/HSEC-2024-0003.md">command
injection vulnerability</a> on Windows for clients of this library. This
isn’t known to affect GHC itself, but allows users who depend on the
installed version of the <code>process</code> to avoid the issue.
</li>
<li>
Fixing a bug resulting in the distributed <code>hsc2hs</code> wrapper
using flags from the compiler build environment
(<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/24050">#24050</a>).
</li>
<li>
Disabling the <code>-fasm-shortcutting</code> optimisation with
<code>-O2</code> as it is known to result in unsoundess and incorrect
runtime results in some cases
(<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/24507">#24507</a>).
</li>
<li>
Ensuring we take <code>LDFLAGS</code> into account when configuring a
linker
(<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/24565">#24565</a>).
</li>
<li>
Fixing a bug arising from incorrect parsing of paths containing spaces
in the settings file
(<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/24265">#24265</a>).
</li>
<li>
And many more fixes
</li>
</ul>
<p>
A full accounting of changes can be found in the
<a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/9.6.5/docs/users_guide/9.6.5-notes.html">release
notes</a>. As some of the fixed issues do affect correctness users are
encouraged to upgrade promptly.
</p>
<p>
We would like to thank Microsoft Azure, GitHub, IOG, the Zw3rk stake
pool, Well-Typed, Tweag I/O, Serokell, Equinix, SimSpace, Haskell
Foundation, and other anonymous contributors whose on-going financial
and in-kind support has facilitated GHC maintenance and release
management over the years. Finally, this release would not have been
possible without the hundreds of open-source contributors whose work
comprise this release.
</p>
<p>
As always, do give this release a try and open a
<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/new">ticket</a> if
you see anything amiss.

<p>
Enjoy!

hosts Czech leader to promote Ukraine aid amid delay in Congress</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — President Joe Biden urged the U.S. House to immediately
take up Senate-passed supplemental funding for Ukraine and Israel on
Monday as he hosted Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala in the Oval
Office. </p>
<p>The visit came as Biden aimed to highlight the efforts other nations
are making to support Ukraine. It followed the Czech government’s
announcement that it is sending 1 million rounds of artillery ammunition
to Ukraine, which Kyiv says is badly needed on the battlefield against
Russia’s invasion. </p>
<p>“As the Czech Republic remembers, Russia won’t stop at Ukraine,”
Biden said. He appealed to Congress to pass the supplemental funding so
the U.S. could do its part to help Ukraine. “They have to do it now,” he
said. </p>
<p>Fiala praised the U.S. president for his leadership in support of
Ukraine, adding, “We are also doing our best.” </p>
<p>He said, “In 1968 I saw Russian tanks in the streets of my town, and
I don’t want to see this again.” </p>
<p>Biden called the Czech Republic a “great ally” in NATO, as Fiala said
his country’s decision to purchase F-35 fighter jets from the U.S. will
“make our cooperation and security much stronger.” </p>
<p>Fiala told reporters following his meeting with Biden that he would
meet with lawmakers on Capitol Hill on Tuesday to further discuss
Ukraine aid. </p>
<p>“The support from U.S., the help from U.S., is very important,” Fiala
said.</p>

<p>date: 2024-04-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Abortion is one of the central issues of the 2024 U.S. presidential
campaign. President Joe Biden says access to abortion is an issue of
personal freedom, while Republican candidate Donald Trump says states
should continue to decide their own abortion laws. VOA Correspondent

id="fedora-intends-to-fully-embrace-ai-but-doesnt-address-sourcing-or-its-environmental-impact">Fedora
intends to fully embrace “AI”, but doesn’t address sourcing or its
environmental impact</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>All weekend, I’ve been mulling over a recent blog post by Fedora
Project Leader Matthew Miller, which he wrote and published on behalf of
the Fedora Council. Fedora (the KDE version) is my distribution of
choice, I love using it, and I consider it the best distribution for
desktop use, and not by a close margin either. As such, reading a blog
post in which Fedora is announcing plans to make extensive use of “AI”
was bound to make me a feel a little uneasy. Miller states – correctly –
that the “AI” space as it stands right now is dominated so much by
hyperbole and over-the-top nonsense that it’s hard to judge the various
technologies underpinning “AI” on merit alone. He continues that he
believes that stripped of all the hyperbole and techbro bullshit,
there’s “something significant, powerful”, and he wants to make “Fedora
Linux the best community platform for AI”. So, what exactly does that
look like? In addition to the big showy LLM-based tools for chat and
code generation, these advances have brought big jumps for more tailored
tasks: for translation, file search, home automation, and especially for
accessibility (already a key part of our strategy). For example, open
source speech synthesis has long lagged behind proprietary options. Now,
what we have in Fedora is not even close to the realism, nuance, and
flexibility of AI-generated speech. ↫ Matthew Miller Some of these are
things we can all agree are important and worthwhile, but lacking on the
Linux desktop. If we can make use of technologies labelled as “AI” to
improve, say, text-to-speech on Linux for those who require it for
accessibility reasons, that’s universally a great thing. Translation,
too, is, at its core, a form of accessibility, and if we can improve
machine translations so that people who, for instance, don’t speak
English gain more access to English content, or if we can make the vast
libraries of knowledge locked into foreign languages accessible to more
people, that’s all good news. However, Fedora aims to take its use of
“AI” even further, and wants to start using it in the process of
developing, making, and distributing Fedora. This is where more and more
red flags are starting to pop up for me, because I don’t feel like the
processes and tasks they want to inject “AI” into are the kinds of
processes and tasks where you want humans taken out of the equation. We
can use AI/ML as part of making the Fedora Linux OS. New tools could
help with package automation and bug triage. They could note anomalies
in test results and logs, maybe even help identify potential security
issues. We can also create infrastructure-level features for our users.
For example, package update descriptions aren’t usually very meaningful.
We could automatically generate concise summaries of what’s new in each
system update — not just for each package, but highlighting what’s
important in the whole set, including upstream change information as
well. ↫ Matthew Miller Even the tools built atop billions and billions
of euros of investments by Microsoft, Google, OpenAI, Facebook, and
similar juggernauts are not exactly good at what they’re supposed to do,
and suck at even the most basic of tasks of providing answers to simple
questions. They lie, they make stuff up, they bug out and produce
nonsense, they’re racist, and so on. I don’t want any of that garbage
near the process of making and updating the operating system I rely on
every day. Miller laments how “AI” is currently a closed-source, black
box affair, which obviously doesn’t align with Fedora’s values and
goals. He doesn’t actually explain how Fedora’s use of “AI” is going to
address this. They’re going to have to find ethical, open source models
that are also of high quality, and that’s a lot easier said than done.
Sourcing doesn’t even get a single mention in this blog post, even
though I’m fairly sure that’s one of the two major issues many of us
have with the current crop of “AI” tools. The blog post also completely
neglects to mention the environmental cost of training these “AI” tools.
It costs an insane amount of electricity to train these new tools, and
with climate change ever accelerating and the destruction of our
environment visible all around us, not mentioning this problem when
you’re leading a project like Fedora seems disingenuous at best, and
malicious at worst. While using “AI” to improve accessibility tools in
Fedora and the wider Linux world is laudable, some of the other intended
targets seem more worrisome, especially when you take into account that
the blog post makes no mention of the two single biggest problems with
“AI”: sourcing, and its environmental impact. If Fedora truly intends to
fully embrace “AI”, it’s going to have to address these two problems
first, because otherwise they’re just trying to latch onto the hype
without really understanding the cost. And that’s not something I want
to hear from the leaders of my Linux distribution.</p>

software and firmware have been a mess, but it’s working on them</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>Framework puts a lot of effort into making its hardware easy to fix
and upgrade and into making sure that hardware can stay useful down the
line when it’s been replaced by something newer. But supporting that
kind of reuse and recycling works best when paired with long-term
software and firmware support, and on that front, Framework has been
falling short. Framework will need to step up its game, especially if it
wants to sell more laptops to businesses—a lucrative slice of the PC
industry that Framework is actively courting. By this summer or fall,
we’ll have some idea of whether its efforts are succeeding. ↫ Andrew
Cunningham at Ars Technica A very painful read, and I’m disappointed to
learn that the software support from Framework has been so lacklustre –
or non-existent, to be more accurate. Leaving severel security
vulnerabilities in firmware unpatched is a disgrace, and puts users at
risk, while promising but not delivering updates that will unlock faster
Thunderbolt speeds is just shitty. They have to do better, especially
since their pitch is all about repairability and longevity. This article
has made me more weary of spending any money on Framework – not that I
have the money for a new laptop, because reasons – and I feel more
people will feel this way after reading this.</p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago I wrote about the ROCK 5 ITX coming soon and
since then, samples of the Rockchip RK3588-based Radxa ROCK 5 ITX have
been landing on doorsteps (or service points, screw you, UPS) of a lucky
group of people and somehow I was one of those, so here’s a first look
at Radxa’s latest Single Board Computer in a Mini ITX form-factor! It’s
going to be a photo-heavy post and I make no apologies for that, it’s a
very nice-looking PCB, with the black and gold colour scheme looking
very stylish. I imagine that was a very conscious decision seeing as, as
expected, they’re marketing this as a low-power desktop option and you
probably don’t want a plain Jane motherboard taking pride of place in
your new system, right? ↫ Bret Weber Now this – this, my friends, is
exactly what the doctor ordered. I can’t wait for standard, ATX
motherboard sporting ARM processors to become more common and readily
available, hopefully standardised better than what we’re used to from
the ARM world. I want my next (non-gaming) machines to be ARM-powered,
and that means we’re going to need more of these ATX ARM boards,
spanning wider performance levels.</p>

the Most Widely Used Climate Tool Doesn’t Work?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-15, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
About six months ago, a climate scientist from Arizona State University,
Stephanie Arcusa, emailed me a
<a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2023/ee/d3ee01138k" target="_blank">provocative
new paper</a> she had published that warned against our growing reliance
on life cycle analysis. This practice of measuring all of the emissions
related to a given product or service throughout every phase of its life
— from the time raw materials are extracted to eventual disposal — was
going to hinder our ability to achieve net-zero emissions, she wrote. It
was a busy time, and I let the message drift to the bottom of my inbox.
But I couldn’t stop thinking about it.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Life cycle analysis permeates the climate economy. Businesses rely on it
to understand their emissions so they can work toward reducing them. The
<a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/sec-climate-disclosure-rule" target="_self"><u>Securities
and Exchange Commission’s climate risk disclosure rule</u></a>, which
requires companies to report their emissions to investors, hinges on it.
The clean hydrogen tax credit requires hydrogen producers to do
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/green-hydrogen-tax-credit-treasury" target="_self"><u>a
version of life cycle analysis</u></a> to prove their eligibility. It is
central to carbon markets, and carbon removal companies are now
developing standards based on life cycle analysis to “certify” their
services as carbon offset developers did before them.
</p>
<p>
At the same time, many of the fiercest debates in climate change are
really debates about life cycle analysis. Should companies be held
responsible for the emissions that are indirectly related to their
businesses, and if so then which ones? Are carbon offsets a sham? Does
using corn ethanol as a gasoline substitute reduce emissions or increase
them? Scientists have repeatedly reached opposite conclusions on that
one
<a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/16022022/corn-ethanol-gasoline-climate-change/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>depending
on how they accounted for the land required to grow corn</u></a> and
what it might have been used for had ethanol not been an option. Though
the debate plays out in calculations, it’s really a philosophical brawl.
</p>
<p>
Everybody, for the most part, knows that life cycle analysis is
difficult and thorny and imprecise. But over and over, experts and
critics alike assert that it can be improved. Arcusa disagrees. Life
cycle analysis, she says, is fundamentally broken. “It’s a problematic
and uncomfortable conclusion to arrive at,” Arcusa wrote in her email.
“On the one hand, it has been the only tool we have had to make any
progress on climate. On the other, carbon accounting is captured by
academia and vested interests and will jeopardize global climate goals.”
</p>
<p>
When I recently revisited the paper, I learned that Arcusa and her
co-authors didn’t just critique life cycle analysis, they proposed a
bold alternative. Their idea is not economically or politically easy,
but it also doesn’t suffer from the problems of trying to track carbon
throughout the supply chain. I recently called her up to talk through
it. Our conversation has been edited for clarity.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Can you walk me through what the biggest issues with life cycle
analysis are?</strong>
</p>
<p>
So, life cycle analysis is a qualitative tool —
</p>
<p>
<strong>It seems kind of counterintuitive or even controversial to call
it a qualitative tool because it’s specifically trying to quantify
something.</strong>
</p>
<p>
I think the best analogy for LCA is that it’s a back-of-the-envelope
tool. If you really could measure everything, then sure, LCA is this
wonderful idea. The problem is in the practicality of being able to
collect all of that data. We can’t, and that leads us to use emissions
factors and average numbers, and we model this and we model that, and we
get so far away from reality that we actually can’t tell if something is
positive or negative in the end.
</p>
<p>
The other problem is that it’s almost entirely subjective, which makes
one LCA incomparable to another LCA depending on the context, depending
on the technology. And yes, there are some standardization efforts that
have been going on for decades. But if you have a ruler, no matter how
much you try, it’s not going to become a screwdriver. We’re trying to
use this tool to quantify things and make them the same for comparison,
and we can’t because of that subjectivity.
</p>
<p>
In this space where there is a lot of money to be made, it’s very easy
to manipulate things one way or another to make it look a little bit
better because the method is not robust. That’s really the gist of the
problems here.
</p>
<p>
<strong>One of the things you talk about in the paper is the way life
cycle analysis is subject to different worldviews. Can you explain that?
</strong>
</p>
<p>
It’s mostly seen in what to include or exclude in the LCA — it can have
enormous impacts on the results. I think corn ethanol is the perfect
example of how tedious this can be because we still don’t have an
answer, precisely for that reason. The uncertainty range of the results
has shrunk and gotten bigger and shrunk and gotten bigger, and it’s
like, well, we still don’t know. And now, this exact same worldview
debate is playing into what should be included and not included in
certification for things [like carbon removal] that are going to be sold
under the guise of climate action, and that just can’t be. We’ll be
forever debating whether something is true.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Is this one of those things that scientists have been debating
for ever, or is this argument that we should stop using life cycle
analysis more of a fringe idea?</strong>
</p>
<p>
I guess I would call it a fringe idea today. There’s been plenty of
criticism throughout the years, even from the very beginning when it was
first created. What I have seen is that there is criticism, and then
there is, “But here’s how we can solve it and continue using
LCA!<em><em>”</em></em> I’ve only come across one other publication that
specifically said, “This is not working. This is not the right
tool,”<em><em> a</em></em>nd that’s from Michael Gillenwater. He’s at
the Greenhouse Gas Management Institute. He was like, “What are we
doing?” There might be other folks, I just haven’t come across them.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Okay, so what is the alternative to LCA that you’ve proposed in
this paper?</strong>
</p>
<p>
LCA targets the middle of the supply chain, and tries to attribute
responsibility there. But if you think about where on the supply chain
the carbon is the most well-known, it is actually at the source, at the
point of origin, before it becomes an emission. At the point where it is
created out of the ground is where we know how much carbon there is. If
we focus on that source through a policy that requires mandatory
sequestration — for every ton of carbon that is now produced, there is a
ton of carbon that’s been put away through carbon removal, and the
accounting happens there, before it is sold to anybody —<strong>
</strong>anybody who’s now downstream of that supply chain is already
carbon neutral. There is no need to track carbon all the way down to the
consumer.
</p>
<p>
We know this is accurate because that is where governments already
collect royalties and taxes — they want to know exactly how much is
being sold. So we already do this. The big difference is that the policy
would be required there instead of taxing everybody downstream.
</p>
<p>
<strong>You’re saying that fossil fuel producers should be required to
remove a ton of carbon from the atmosphere for every ton of carbon in
the fuels they sell?</strong>
</p>
<p>
Yeah, and maybe I should be more specific. They should
<em><em>pay</em></em> for an equal amount of carbon to be removed from
the atmosphere. In no way are we implying that a fossil carbon producer
needs to also be doing the sequestration themselves.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What would be the biggest challenges of implementing something
like this?</strong>
</p>
<p>
The ultimate challenge is convincing people that we need to be managing
carbon and that this is a waste management type of system. Nobody really
wants to pay for waste management, and so it needs to be regulated and
demanded by some authority.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What about the fact that we don’t really have the ability to
remove carbon or store carbon at scale today, and may not for some
time?</strong>
</p>
<p>
Yes, we need to build capacity so that eventually we can match the
carbon production to the carbon removal, which is why we also proposed
that the liability needs to start today, not in the future. That
liability is as good as a credit card debt — you actually have to pay
it. It can be paid little by little every year, but the liability is
here now, and not in the future.
</p>
<p>
The risk in the system that I’m describing, or even the system that is
currently being deployed, is that you have counterproductive
technologies that are being developed. And by counterproductive, I mean
[carbon removal] technologies that are producing more emissions than
they are storing, and so they’re net-positive. You can create a
technology that has no intention of removing more carbon than its
sequesters. The intention is just to earn money.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Do you mean, like, the things that are supposed to be removing
carbon from the atmosphere and sequestering it, they are using fossil
fuels to do that, and end up releasing more carbon in the
process?</strong>
</p>
<p>
Yeah, so basically, what we show in the paper is that when we get to
full carbon neutrality, the market forces alone will eliminate those
kinds of technologies that are counterproductive. The problem is during
the transition, these technologies can be economically viable because
they are cheaper than they would be if 100% of the fossil fuel they used
was carbon neutral through carbon removal. And so in order to prevent
those technologies from gaming the system, we need a way to artificially
make the price of fossil carbon as expensive as it would be if 100% of
that fossil carbon was covered by carbon removal.
</p>
<p>
That’s where the idea of permits comes in. For every amount that I
produce, I now have an instant liability, which is a permit. Each of
those permits has to be matched by carbon removal. And since we don’t
have enough carbon removal, we have futures and these futures represent
the promise of actually doing carbon removal.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What if we burn through the remaining carbon budget and we still
don’t have the capacity to sequester enough carbon? </strong>
</p>
<p>
Well, then we’re going into very unchartered territory. Right now we’re
just mindlessly going through this thinking that if we just reduce
emissions it will be good. It won’t be good.
</p>
<p>
<strong>In the paper, you also argue against mitigating greenhouse gases
other than carbon, and that seems pretty controversial to me. Why is
that?</strong>
</p>
<p>
We’re not arguing against mitigating, per se. We’re arguing against
lumping everything under the same carbon accounting framework because
lumping hides the difficulty in actually doing something about it. It’s
not that we shouldn’t mitigate other greenhouse gases — we must. It’s
just that if we separate the problem of carbon away from the problem of
methane, away from the problem of nitrous oxide, or CFCs, we can tackle
them more effectively. Because right now, we’re trying to do everything
under the same umbrella, and that doesn’t work. We don’t tackle drinking
and driving by sponsoring better tires. That’s just silly, right? We
wouldn’t do that. We would tackle drinking and driving on its own, and
then we would tackle better tires in a different policy.
</p>
<p>
So the argument is: Most of climate change is caused by carbon; let’s
tackle that separately from the others and leave tackling methane and
nitrous oxide to purposefully created programs to tackle those things.
Let’s not lump the calculations altogether, hiding all the differences
and hiding meaningful action.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Is there still a role for life cycle analysis?</strong>
</p>
<p>
You don’t want to be regulating carbon using life cycle analysis. So you
can use the life cycle analysis for qualitative purposes, but we’re
pretending that it is a tool that can deliver accurate results, and it
just doesn’t.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What has the response been like to this paper? What kind of
feedback have you gotten?</strong>
</p>
<p>
Stunned silence!
</p>
<p>
<strong>Nobody has said anything?</strong>
</p>
<p>
In private, they have. Not in public. In private, it’s been a little bit
like, “I’ve always thought this, but it seemed like there was no other
way.” But then in public, think about it. Everything is built on LCA.
It’s now in every single climate bill out there. Every single standard.
Every single consulting company is doing LCA and doing carbon
footprinting for companies. It’s a huge industry, so I guess I shouldn’t
have been surprised to hear nothing publicly.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Yeah, I was gonna ask — I’ve been writing about the SEC rules
and this idea that companies should start reporting their emissions to
their investors, and that would all be based on LCA. There’s a lot of
buy-in for that idea across the climate movement.</strong>
</p>
<p>
Yeah, but there’s definitely a fine line with make-believe. I think in
many instances, we kid ourselves thinking that we’re going to have
numbers that we can hang our hats on. In many instances we will not, and
they will be challenged. And so at that point, what’s the point?
</p>
<p>
<strong>One thing I hear when I talk to people about this is, well,
having an estimate is better than not having anything, or, don’t let the
perfect be the enemy of the good, or, we can just keep working to make
them better and better. Why not?</strong>
</p>
<p>
I mean, I wouldn’t say don’t try. But when it comes to actually
enforcing anything, it’s going to be extremely hard to prove a number.
You could just be stuck in litigation for a long time and still not have
an answer.
</p>
<p>
I don’t know, to me it just seems like an endless debate while time is
ticking and we will just feel good because we’ll have thought we
measured everything. But we’re still not doing anything.

supervisor gets 18 months in prison for fatal movie set shooting by Alec
Baldwin</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>santa fe, new mexico — A movie weapons supervisor was sentenced to 18
months in prison in the fatal shooting of a cinematographer by Alec
Baldwin on the set of the Western film “Rust,” during a hearing Monday
in which tearful family members and friends gave testimonials that
included calls for justice and a punishment that would instill greater
accountability for safety on film sets.</p>
<p>Movie armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed was convicted in March by a jury
on a charge of involuntary manslaughter in the death of cinematographer
Halyna Hutchins and has been held for more than a month at a county jail
on the outskirts of Santa Fe.</p>
<p>Prosecutors blamed Gutierrez-Reed for unwittingly bringing live
ammunition onto the set of “Rust” where it was expressly prohibited and
for failing to follow basic gun safety protocols.</p>
<p>Gutierrez-Reed was unsuccessful in her plea for a lesser sentencing,
telling the judge she was not the monster that people have made her out
to be and that she had tried to do her best on the set despite not
having “proper time, resources and staffing.”</p>
<p>Baldwin, the lead actor and co-producer for “Rust,” was pointing a
gun at Hutchins during a rehearsal on a movie set outside Santa Fe in
October 2021 when the revolver went off, killing Hutchins and wounding
director Joel Souza.</p>
<p>Baldwin has pleaded not guilty to a charge of involuntary
manslaughter. He is scheduled for trial in July at a courthouse in Santa
Fe.</p>
<p>The sentence against Gutierrez-Reed was delivered by New Mexico Judge
Mary Marlowe Summer, who is overseeing proceedings against Baldwin. The
judge said anything less than the maximum sentence would not be
appropriate given that Gutierrez-Reed’s recklessness amounted to a
serious violent offense.</p>
<p>“You were the armorer, the one that stood between a safe weapon and a
weapon that could kill someone,” the judge told Gutierrez-Reed. “You
alone turned a safe weapon into a lethal weapon. But for you,
Ms. Hutchins would be alive, a husband would have his partner and a
little boy would have his mother.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Gutierrez-Reed teared up as Hutchins’ agent, Craig Mizrahi, spoke
about the cinematographer’s creativity and described her as a rising
star in Hollywood. He said it was a chain of events that led to
Hutchins’ death and that had the armorer been doing her job, that chain
would have been broken.</p>
<p>Los Angeles-based attorney Gloria Allred read a statement by
Hutchins’ mother, Olga Solovey, who said her life had been split in two
and that time didn’t heal, rather it only prolonged her pain and
suffering. A video of a tearful Solovey, who lives in Ukraine, also was
played for the court.</p>
<p>“It’s the hardest thing to lose a child. There’s no words to
describe,” Solovey said in her native language.</p>
<p>Defense attorneys for Gutierrez-Reed requested leniency in sentencing
— including a possible conditional discharge that would avoid further
jail time and leave an adjudication of guilt off her record if certain
conditions are met.</p>
<p>Gutierrez-Reed was acquitted at trial of allegations she tampered
with evidence in the “Rust” investigation. She also has pleaded not
guilty to a separate felony charge that she allegedly carried a gun into
a bar in Santa Fe where firearms are prohibited.</p>
<p>Defense attorneys have highlighted Gutierrez-Reed’s relatively young
age “and the devastating effect a felony will have on her life going
forward.”</p>
<p>They said the 26-year-old will forever be affected negatively by
intense publicity associated with her prosecution in parallel with an
A-list actor, and has suffered from anxiety, fear and depression as a
result.</p>
<p>Special prosecutor Kari Morrissey urged the judge to impose the
maximum prison sentence and designate Gutierrez-Reed as a “serious
violent offender” to limit her eligibility for a sentence reduction
later, describing the defendant’s behavior on the set of “Rust” as
exceptionally reckless.</p>
<p>Defense attorneys argued Monday that Gutierrez-Reed was remorseful
and had breakdowns over Hutchins’ death. They also pointed to systemic
problems that led to the shooting.</p>
<p>“Rust” assistant director and safety coordinator Dave Halls last year
pleaded no contest to negligent handling of a firearm and completed a
sentence of six months unsupervised probation. “Rust” props master Sarah
Zachry, who shared some responsibilities over firearms on the set of
“Rust,” signed an agreement with prosecutors to avoid prosecution in
return with her cooperation.</p>

id="ethiopias-sisay-lemma-kenyas-hellen-obiri-win-boston-marathon">Ethiopia’s
Sisay Lemma, Kenya’s Hellen Obiri win Boston Marathon</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BOSTON — Sisay Lemma scorched the first half of the Boston Marathon
course on Monday, setting a record pace to build a lead of more than
half of a mile. </p>
<p>Then the weather heated up, and the 34-year-old Ethiopian slowed
down. </p>
<p>After running alone for most of the morning, Lemma held on down
Boylston Street to finish in 2 hours, 6 minutes, 17 seconds — the 10th
fastest time in the race’s 128-year history. Lemma dropped to the
pavement and rolled onto his back, smiling, after crossing the finish
line. </p>
<p>“Until halfway through I was running very hard and very good. But
after that it was getting harder and harder,” said Lemma, who failed to
finish twice and came in 30th in three previous Boston attempts.
“Several times I’ve dropped out of the race before. But today I won, so
I’ve redeemed myself.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hellen Obiri defended her title, outkicking Sharon Lokedi on Boylston
Street to finish in 2:27:37 and win by eight seconds; two-time Boston
champion Edna Kiplagat completed the Kenyan sweep, finishing another 36
seconds back. </p>
<p>Obiri also won New York last fall and is among the favorites for the
Paris Olympics. She is the sixth woman to win back-to-back in Boston and
the first since Catherine “the Great” Ndereba won four in six years from
2000 to ’05. </p>
<p>“Defending the title was not easy. Since Boston started, it’s only
six women. So I said, ‘Can I be one of them? If you want to be one of
them, you have to work extra hard,’” she said. “And I’m so happy because
I’m now one of them. I’m now in the history books in Boston.” </p>
<p>Lemma, the 2021 London champion, arrived in Boston with the fastest
time in the field — just the fourth person ever to break 2:02:00 when he
won in Valencia last year. And he showed it on the course Monday,
separating himself from the pack in Ashland and opening a lead of more
than half of a mile. </p>
<p>Lemma ran the first half in 1:00:19 — 99 seconds faster than Geoffrey
Mutai’s course record pace in 2011, when his 2:03:02 was the fastest
marathon in history. Fellow Ethiopian Mohamed Esa closed the gap through
the last few miles, finishing second by 41 seconds; two-time defending
champion Evans Chebet was third. </p>
<p>Each winner collected a gilded olive wreath and $150,000 from a total
prize purse that topped $1 million for the first time. </p>
<p>On a day when sunshine and temperatures rising into the mid-60s left
the runners reaching for water — to drink, and to dump over their heads
— Obiri ran with an unusually large lead pack of 15 through Brookline
before breaking away in the final few miles. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Emma Bates of Boulder, Colorado, finished 12th — her second straight
year as the top American. Again, she found herself leading the race
through the 30-kilometer mark, slapping hands as she ran past the
Wellesley College students chanting her name before fading on the way
out of Heartbreak Hill. </p>
<p>“I thought last year was crazy loud, but this year surpassed that
completely,” Bates said. “It was such a nice day for the spectators. Not
so nice for the runners; it was pretty hot.” </p>
<p>CJ Albertson of Fresno, California, was the top American man in
seventh, his second top-10 finish. </p>
<p>Switzerland’s Marcel Hug righted himself after crashing into a
barrier when he took a turn too fast and still coasted to a course
record in the men’s wheelchair race. It was his seventh Boston win and
his 14th straight major marathon victory. </p>
<p>Hug already had a four-minute lead about 18 miles in when he reached
the landmark firehouse turn in Newton, where the course heads onto
Commonwealth Avenue on its way to Heartbreak Hill. He spilled into the
fence, flipping sideways onto his left wheel, but quickly restored
himself. </p>
<p>“It was my fault,” Hug said. “I had too much weight, too much
pressure from above to my steering, so I couldn’t steer.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hug finished in 1:15:33, winning by 5:04 and breaking his previous
course record by 1:33. Britain’s Eden Rainbow-Cooper, 22, won the
women’s wheelchair race in 1:35:11 for her first major marathon victory;
she is the third-youngest woman to win the Boston wheelchair race. </p>
<p>The otherwise sleepy New England town of Hopkinton celebrated its
100th anniversary as the starting line for the world’s oldest and most
prestigious marathon, sending off a field of 17 former champions and
nearly 30,000 other runners on its way. Near the finish on Boylston
Street 26.2 miles (42.2 kilometers) away, officials observed the
anniversary of the 2013 bombing that killed three and wounded hundreds
more. </p>
<p>Sunny skies and minimal wind greeted the runners, with temperatures
in the 40s as they gathered in Hopkinton rising to 69 as the stragglers
crossed the finish line in the afternoon. As the field went through
Natick, the fourth of eight cities and towns on the route, athletes
splashed water on themselves to cool off. </p>
<p>“We couldn’t ask for a better day,” former New England Patriots tight
end Rob Gronkowski, the grand marshal, said before climbing into an
electric car that would carry him along the course. “The city of Boston
always comes out to support, no matter the event. The weather is
perfection, the energy is popping.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The festivities began around 6 a.m., when race director Dave
McGillivray sent about 30 Massachusetts National Guard members off. Lt.
Col. Paula Reichert Karsten, one of the marchers, said she wanted to be
part of a “quintessential Massachusetts event.” </p>
<p>The start line was painted to say “100 years in Hopkinton,”
commemorating the 1924 move from Ashland to Hopkinton to conform to the
official Olympic Marathon distance. The announcer welcomed the gathering
crowds to the “sleepy little town of Hopkinton, 364 days of the
year.” </p>
<p>“In Hopkinton, it’s probably the coolest thing about the town,” said
Maggie Agosto, a 16-year-old resident who went to the start line with a
friend to watch the race. </p>
<p>The annual race on Patriots’ Day, the state holiday that commemorates
the start of the Revolutionary War, also fell on One Boston Day, when
the city remembers the victims of the 2013 finish line bombings. Before
the race, bagpipes accompanied Gov. Maura Healey, Boston Mayor Michelle
Wu and members of the victims’ families as they laid a pair of wreaths
at the sites of the explosions.</p>

<h2 id="apples-mysterious-fisheye-projection">Apple’s mysterious fisheye
projection</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>If you’ve read my first post about Spatial Video, the second
about Encoding Spatial Video, or if you’ve used my command-line tool,
you may recall a mention of Apple’s mysterious “fisheye” projection
format. Mysterious because they’ve documented
a CMProjectionType.fisheye enumeration with no elaboration, they stream
their immersive Apple TV+ videos in this format, yet they’ve provided no
method to produce or playback third-party content using this projection
type. Additionally, the format is undocumented, they haven’t responded
to an open question on the Apple Discussion Forums asking for more
detail, and they didn’t cover it in their WWDC23 sessions. As someone
who has experience in this area – and a relentless curiosity – I’ve
spent time digging-in to Apple’s fisheye projection format, and this
post shares what I’ve learned. ↫ Mike Swanson There is just so much cool
technology crammed into the Vision Pro, from the crazy displays down to,
apparently, the encoding format for spatial video. Too bad Apple seems
to have forgotten that a technology is not a product, as even the most
ardent Apple supporterts – like John Gruber, or the hosts of ATP – have
stated their Vision Pro devices are lying unused, collecting dust, just
months after launch.</p>

<p>
The ongoing tensions between Italy and Alfa Romeo’s parent company
Stellantis reached a head last week when the Italian government told the
automaker that naming its upcoming Alfa Romeo EV the Milano was against
the law because the car will be built in Poland. So now Alfa Romeo has
decided to change the name to something that won’t evoke any feelings of
<em>la dolce vita</em> or desire for delicious Pepperidge Farm cookies,
or any emotions at all for that matter. Besides total blandness.

citizen arrested in Moscow on drug charges appears in court</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Moscow — A U.S. citizen arrested on drug charges in Moscow amid
soaring Russia-U.S. tensions over Ukraine appeared in court on
Monday.</p>
<p>Robert Woodland Romanov is facing charges of trafficking large
amounts of illegal drugs as part of an organized group — a criminal
offense punishable by up to 20 years in prison. He was remanded into
custody in January, and the trial began in the Ostankino District Court
in late March. A new court hearing is scheduled for next week.</p>
<p>In January, the U.S. State Department said it was aware of reports of
the recent detention of a U.S. citizen and noted that it “has no greater
priority than the safety and security of U.S. citizens overseas,” but
refrained from further comment, citing privacy considerations. The U.S.
Embassy in Moscow issued a similar statement at the time.</p>
<p>Russian media noted that the name of the accused matches that of a
U.S. citizen interviewed by the popular daily Komsomolskaya Pravda in
2020.</p>
<p>In the interview, the man said that he was born in the Perm region in
the Ural Mountains in 1991 and was adopted by an American couple when he
was two. He said that he traveled to Russia to find his Russian mother
and eventually met her in a TV show in Moscow.</p>
<p>The man told Komsomolskaya Pravda that he liked living in Russia and
decided to move there. The newspaper reported that he settled in the
town of Dolgoprudny just outside Moscow and was working as an English
teacher at a local school.</p>
<p>Arrests of Americans in Russia have become increasingly common as
relations between Moscow and Washington sink to Cold War lows.
Washington accuses Moscow of targeting its citizens and using them as
political bargaining chips, but Russian officials insist they all broke
the law.</p>
<p>Some have been exchanged for Russians held in the U.S., while for
others, the prospects of being released in a swap are less clear.</p>

<p>
Iran and Israel’s proxy conflict escalated into direct strikes over the
weekend and oil prices have hardly budged. So far on Monday, the Brent
crude oil benchmark is hovering around $89.50 a barrel, a 1-ish% dip for
the day.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>This has been the story of the conflict so far: While oil
prices rose following Hamas’s October 7 attack on Southern Israel and
the beginning of Israel’s invasion of Gaza, they’re now back to where
they were for much of September, and are down substantially from their
summer 2022 highs.
</p>
<p>
It remains to be seen how, exactly, Israel will respond to the
<a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/04/15/israel-iran-attack-missiles-retaliation" target="_blank">attack
by Iranian drones</a>, but oil markets are still largely relaxed. By the
end of last week, explained Eurasia Group analyst Greg Brew, the markets
had already “priced in” an Iranian attack, pushing prices above $90.
</p>
<p>
Brew pointed to both the
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/14/politics/biden-netanyahu-israel-iran-response/index.html" target="_blank"><u>United
States</u></a> and
<a href="https://newyork.mfa.ir/portal/NewsView/743409/Ambassadors-Statement-Before-UNSC-Regarding-Irans-Legitimate-Right-to-Self-Defense-against-Israeli-Regime" target="_blank"><u>Iran</u></a>
indicating that “further escalation is being actively discouraged” as
one cause for the market’s relative relaxation so far today.
</p>
<p>
“The market is down a bit, though there is still a lot of anxiety
regarding whether Israel’s response to the attack creates more
escalatory pressure,” he told me. “So we’re still in a wait-and-see
pattern.”
</p>
<p>
Despite the escalation, oil markets apparently still don’t see the
conflict spinning out of control. “Crude essentially unchanged to start
the week,” oil analyst Rory Johnston tweeted Sunday. “Iran’s reaction
perfectly priced in.”

How to add a <a href="https://blogroll.social/">FeedLand blogroll</a> to
a <a href="http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml">Drummer
blog</a>.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
You must have a Drummer blog and a FeedLand account.
</li>
<li>
You can specify that all the feeds you’re subscribed to are in your
blogroll or use a category and only feeds in that category will be in
the blogroll.
</li>
<li>
The blogroll updates automatically, when one of the feeds has a new
post, it goes to the top of the list.
</li>
<li>
You can expand a feed to see the five most recent items. Click on the
pubdate to go to the full item on the web.
</li>
<li>
It supports keyboard navigation. Up and down arrows move through the
list, Return to expand/collapse.
</li>
<li>
We’re working on WordPress plugin.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Four head-level attributes in your blog.opml file. Only one required.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
blogrollUsername – required
</li>
<li>
blogrollServer – optional, if not specified it’s feedland.com
</li>
<li>
blogrollCategory – optional
</li>
<li>
blogrollTitle – optional, but you really should provide a title,
otherwise we invent a silly one for you. <span

to ask questions offer kudos, etc. <span
class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>

<p>
PS: I’m not trying to sell you on using Drummer to run a blog. Rather I
needed a place to figure out how this works, so we know how to set up
and document the WordPress plugin.

external SSDs are faster with Apple silicon</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>After several days testing the latest Express 1M2 enclosure from OWC,
I have changed my recommendations for the best external SSDs. Previously
I had chosen the relatively reliable Thunderbolt 3 up to 3 GB/s, even
though few drives ever seemed capable of achieving that up to. If you’re
still needing good performance with an Intel Mac, that makes sense. But
if you need best performance with an Apple silicon Mac, you’re far
better off with a high-quality USB 40Gbps enclosure such as OWC’s
Express 1M2, which should reliably return over 3 GB/s even through a
compatible hub. I much prefer the word over to up to. ↫ Howard Oakley If
you have an Apple Silicon Mac, and you’re looking for an external drive
– this is some good advice to follow.</p>

<h2 id="busting-the-immigrants-as-job-takers-myth">Busting the
“immigrants as job takers” myth</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-15, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
On today’s program, we’re taking a closer look at immigration and
entrepreneurship. Immigrants are more likely to start a new company than
U.S.-born citizens, studies show. And those new businesses need to make
hires — turns out, immigrant entrepreneurs are associated with a net
gain in jobs. We’ll discuss. Also, a boost in the Internal Revenue
Service budget seems to be making a difference, and investors respond to
rising tensions in the Middle East.

Tesla has reportedly laid off “more than 10%” of its global workforce,

to Jameson Dow</a> at <em><em>Electrek</em></em>. In an internal
company-wide email, CEO Elon Musk said “this will enable us to be lean,
innovative and hungry for the next growth phase cycle.” The exact
headcount isn’t clear but Dow calculates a 10% cut would bring the
number of workers newly out of a job to about 14,000. The news wasn’t
unexpected – employees had been whispering about potential layoffs for a
few weeks, and their angst was fueled by the announcement last Thursday
that Cybertruck production shifts at Tesla’s Gigafactory in Texas would
be shortened, starting today. Dow notes the layoffs will hurt morale,
“which is a shame, because we do need Tesla to keep pushing things
forward, and to keep attracting the best and brightest.”

it nicely: “The nation’s largest property owner, the federal government,
effectively charges rent to oil and gas companies that exploit public
land for private profit.” Now it is hiking its rates. The new rules,
which could take effect in 60 days, raise royalty rates, lease rents,
minimum auction bids, as well as “bonding rates,” which are upfront
payments “to cover the cost of plugging abandoned oil and gas wells,”

The new minimum lease bonds will be $150,000 per lease, up from $10,000.
Royalty rates will rise from 12.5% to 16.67%. The government estimates
the rules would increase costs for fossil fuel companies by about $1.5

Flooding is common for the region in the spring, but this year has been
particularly bad. Experts say the soil was already saturated before
winter, and higher-than usual snowfall followed by a burst of warm
weather made for ideal flood conditions. Maria Shahgedanova, a professor

extreme flooding is likely to become more common because climate change

Tesla has reportedly laid off “more than 10%” of its global workforce,

to Jameson Dow</a> at <em><em>Electrek</em></em>. In an internal
company-wide email, CEO Elon Musk said “this will enable us to be lean,
innovative and hungry for the next growth phase cycle.” The exact
headcount isn’t clear but Dow calculates a 10% cut would bring the
number of workers newly out of a job to about 14,000. The news wasn’t
unexpected – employees had been whispering about potential layoffs for a
few weeks, and their angst was fueled by the announcement last Thursday
that Cybertruck production shifts at Tesla’s Gigafactory in Texas would
be shortened, starting today. Dow notes the layoffs will hurt morale,
“which is a shame, because we do need Tesla to keep pushing things
forward, and to keep attracting the best and brightest.”

Flooding is common for the region in the spring, but this year has been

<p>
<em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Tensions continue to run high in
the Middle East after Iran’s recent drone and missile attacks against
Israel. We’ll delve into how this weekend’s events could make a bad
situation worse for Iran’s heavily sanctioned economy and the people
living there. Plus, we’ll hear how the ongoing war in Ukraine could
provide another big hit to energy prices, and we’ll preview the outlook
for Zimbabwe’s new gold-backed currency.

<p>date: 2024-04-15, updated: 2024-04-14, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
A <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/555">new paper</a> presents a
polynomial-time quantum algorithm for solving certain hard lattice
problems. This could be a big deal for post-quantum cryptographic
algorithms, since many of them base their security on hard lattice
problems.
</p>
<p>
A few things to note. One, this paper has not yet been peer reviewed. As
<a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/111385/polynomial-time-quantum-algorithms-for-lattice-problems">this
comment</a> points out: “We had already some cases where efficient
quantum algorithms for lattice problems were discovered, but they turned
out
<a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/41731/new-quantum-attack-on-lattices-or-shor-strikes-again?rq=1">not
being correct</a> or only worked for
<a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/95187/what-does-the-work-an-efficient-quantum-algorithm-for-lattice-problems-achievin">simple
special cases</a>.”
</p>
<p>
Two, this is a quantum algorithm, which means that it has not been
tested. There is a wide gulf between quantum algorithms in theory and in
practice. And until we can actually code and test these algorithms, we
should be suspicious of their speed and complexity claims…

York Will Soon Get Congestion Pricing — After a 150,000-Year Wait</h2>

<p class="drop-caps">
In late March, the board that oversees New York’s Metropolitan
Transportation Authority
<a href="https://hellgatenyc.com/the-winners-losers-of-nycs-congestion-pricing-plan" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>cast
a final vote</u></a> to implement congestion pricing. If the plan
survives some
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/03/nyregion/nj-congestion-pricing-federal-court.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>last-ditch
lawsuits</u></a>, drivers will soon have to cough up $15 to travel into
Lower Manhattan during rush hours. The MTA will get
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-27/congestion-pricing-in-new-york-city-how-the-new-system-would-work" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>billions
every year</u></a> to make capital improvements, the air will be
markedly cleaner, the streets notably less congested, and a proposal
that was
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/22/nyregion/23mayorcnd.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>first
pitched</u></a> by former Mayor Michael Bloomberg 17 years ago will have
finally been realized.
</p>
<p>
“I often wonder what our system would have been like if we passed it
back in 2008,” MTA board member Haeda Mihaltses, a veteran of the
Bloomberg administration, mused just before she cast her vote in favor.
</p>
<p>
The price of nearly two decades of procrastination over doing something
to alleviate the most densely-populated,
<a href="https://nypost.com/2023/03/13/nyc-drivers-travel-just-12-mph-during-rush-hour/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>traffic-snarled
place</u></a> in North America is, indeed, unfathomably high. There’s
the billions of dollars of mass transit infrastructure we missed out on,
the billions
<a href="https://leading.business.columbia.edu/main-pillar-climate-change-sustainability/economy-policy/congestion-pricing-new-york" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>spent
on health care</u></a> from breathing in dirty air.
</p>
<p>
And then there’s the most precious resource of all. According to
<a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/12/01/komanoff-imho-tmrb-is-a-ok" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>one
calculation</u></a> from transport economist and congestion pricing
advocate Charles Komanoff, the plan the MTA adopted last month will save
drivers, bus passengers, and subway riders a combined 225,000 hours
every single day. Here’s a fun thought experiment: If New York had
adopted this plan back in 2008, we could have saved ourselves a combined
1,314,000,000 hours, or 150,000 years.
</p>
<p>
How could implementing something so obviously necessary and routine —
anyone who has paid to camp in a National Park or drive on the New
Jersey Turnpike understands the concept — take so long? What does it say
about how we govern? And what can we learn from it?
</p>
<p>
“I think it is fair to say that whatever roadblock congestion pricing
could have hit, it hit,” Rachael Fauss, a policy director and MTA
researcher for the good government group
<a href="https://reinventalbany.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Reinvent
Albany</u>, told me</a>. “It was the worst case scenario of timelines if
you were to project out: What are the things that could delay this?”
</p>
<p>
Some of the delays were deliberate: It’s hard enough for lawmakers to
summon the courage to raise taxes on millionaires and billionaires, so
charging drivers money for something that used to be “free,” to fund a
transit agency that often conjures delayed trains and
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-23/in-nyc-subway-a-case-study-in-runaway-transit-construction-costs?embedded-checkout=true" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>decades-long
boondoggles</u></a> in the public’s imagination, was always going to
require a fortitude that is in chronically short supply in
Albany.<strong> </strong>When then-New York Governor Andrew Cuomo pushed
to pass congestion pricing in 2019, he and his fellow lawmakers wrote
into the actual bill that the tolling scheme
<a href="https://nypost.com/2019/04/02/politicians-put-off-setting-congestion-pricing-fee-until-after-2020-election/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>couldn’t
be announced</u></a> for a year and a half — until after the 2020
election. The same politicians who were supposedly brave enough to vote
congestion pricing into law didn’t want anything to do with putting that
law into practice.
</p>
<p>
Then there were the bureaucratic delays. The COVID pandemic, of course,
redirected much of the government and forced the MTA into survival mode
as subway ridership
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/03/08/climate/nyc-transit-covid.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>dropped
90%</u></a>; suddenly the agency’s most important work was to
<a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2020/09/13/railing-over-mta-one-track-mind-on-federal-bailout-hope/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>coordinate</u></a>
lifesaving bailouts from the
<a href="https://gothamist.com/news/feds-send-mta-6-billion-keep-secret-sauce-flowing" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>federal</u></a>
and
<a href="https://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/politics/2023/02/01/hochul-proposes-mta-bailout-with-payroll-tax-hike--casino-revenue" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>state
governments</u></a>. Then the Trump administration
<a href="https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-congestion-pricing-cuomo-trump" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>slow-walked</u></a>
the answer to a key question: Because the congestion pricing plan
involved placing tolls on roads built with federal funding, the state
needed a sign-off from the federal Department of Transportation. But was
congestion pricing the kind of massive infrastructure project that,
under the
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/nepa/national-environmental-policy-act-review-process" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>National
Environmental Policy Act</u></a> of 1969, required an exhaustive
Environmental Impact Statement? Could it pass NEPA review with a less
thorough Environmental Assessment? Or, given that nothing was actually
being built up or torn down, could it be exempt from these reviews
altogether?
</p>
<p>
Two years after the congestion pricing law passed, and months after the
plan was supposed to go into effect in early 2021, the newly installed
Biden administration finally
<a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2021/03/30/this-is-happening-feds-lets-mta-do-simpler-environmental-review-of-congestion-pricing" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>asked</u></a>
for the middle option, an Environmental Assessment, which the MTA
<a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2020/11/19/congestion-pricing-can-still-happen-in-2021-but-there-are-a-lot-of-ifs-including-president-biden/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>initially
said</u></a> could be done in a matter of months. In actuality, that
timeline stretched to 16 months and produced a
<a href="https://new.mta.info/project/CBDTP/environmental-assessment-2022" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>4,000-page
behemoth</u></a> that some
<a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/03/28/the-toll-of-history-mta-board-approves-15-congestion-pricing-fee" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>experts
noted</u></a> was more comprehensive than the average EIS.
</p>
<p>
Seemingly nothing escaped the MTA’s scrutiny — it even looked at how
congestion pricing would
<a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/06/10/opinion-pete-buttigieg-is-failing-new-york-and-the-country-on-congestion-pricing/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>affect
traffic in the Philadelphia suburbs</u></a> (not all that much). The
results were
<a href="https://www.masstransitmag.com/management/article/21277061/environmental-assessment-for-new-york-mtas-proposed-congestion-pricing-program-released" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>not
exactly shocking</u></a>: Tolling vehicles entering Lower Manhattan
below 60th Street would result in up to 20% fewer vehicles in the
Central Business District, improving air quality while also generating
$1 billion in revenue for public transit, which could then be used to
secure up to $15 billion in bonds. After more than 50 public meetings
and 25,000 written comments
(<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/03/nyregion/nj-congestion-pricing-federal-court.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>60%
in favor</u></a> of the plan), the Biden administration
<a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/05/05/federal-government-gives-mta-final-blessing-to-congestion-pricing" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>produced</u></a>
a “finding of no significant impact,” meaning that congestion pricing
wouldn’t negatively affect the economy, the environment, or the roads.
</p>
<p>
There was at least one notable benefit that came from doing such a
comprehensive, time-intensive review: The MTA found that congestion
pricing
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/12/nyregion/nyc-congestion-pricing-manhattan-bronx.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>could
cause an increase</u></a> in truck traffic to the South Bronx for
drivers looking to toll shop, which in turn prompted the agency to
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/28/nyregion/mta-congestion-pricing-pollution-bronx.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>allocate
$200 million to alleviate pollution</u></a> in some of New York City’s
poorest neighborhoods, which have
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/04/new-york-south-bronx-minorities-pollution-inequity" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>shamefully
high asthma rates</u></a> that
<a href="https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/research/centers/columbia-center-childrens-environmental-health/our-research/health-effects/asthma" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>mostly
affect Black and Latine New Yorkers</u></a>.<strong> </strong>“Is it
congestion pricing’s job to remedy those problems? Maybe not,” Fauss, of
Reinvent Albany, said. “But is it a really important way to correct some
past wrongs? Yeah, absolutely.”
</p>
<p>
The MTA’s thoroughness may help protect it from the
<a href="https://hellgatenyc.com/nj-sues-congestion-pricing-wah-wah" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>bad
faith lawsuits</u></a> that have been
<a href="https://hellgatenyc.com/lawsuit-congestion-pricing-teachers" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>filed</u></a>
to try and shut down the license plate readers before they go live on
June 15. But we’re in the midst of a climate crisis. Why should a
54-year-old law designed to prevent overeager developers from doing
things like demolishing neighborhoods to build highways discourage
cities and states from enacting dynamic, flexible solutions to cut
pollution created by those highways — <em><em>and</em></em> fund public
transit at the same time? And why should a review of a plan that
requires no concrete, no demolition — no actual infrastructure — take
three years?
</p>
<p>
The biggest hurdle congestion pricing had to overcome might have been
psychological. Let’s call it “car brain”: Even though
<a href="https://new.mta.info/document/110766" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>85%</u></a>
of commuters who travel into the Central Business District take mass
transit, for years, lawmakers and congestion pricing opponents have
argued (and in the case of the current New York City Mayor Eric Adams,
<em><em>still</em></em>
<a href="https://nypost.com/2024/02/06/metro/eric-adams-adrienne-adams-distance-themselves-from-mtas-15-congestion-toll/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>argue</u></a>)
that charging people to drive into Lower Manhattan was a kind of attack
on the middle class. In a city where valuable street real estate
<a href="https://hellgatenyc.com/nyc-might-charge-for-parking" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has
been converted into free parking</u></a>, congestion pricing was
portrayed as profaning the sacred rights of “regular” New Yorkers —
never mind the fact that just
<a href="https://www.cssny.org/news/entry/congestion-pricing-outer-borough-new-yorkers-poverty-data-analysis" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>2%
of New York’s working poor</u></a> will end up paying the tolls. Driving
your car wherever you please, it turns out, is
<a href="https://blog.tstc.org/2017/04/21/car-free-new-york-city/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>quite
expensive</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
“Elected officials are facing the world from the front seat of a car,
whether they’re driving or being driven,” Danny Pearlstein, the policy
and communications director at
<a href="https://www.ridersalliance.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Riders
Alliance</u></a>, one of the most forceful proponents of congestion
pricing, told me. Pearlstein added that “bureaucrats who drive to work”
probably contributed to the Biden administration’s slow-walking of the
approval process, or so he suspects. “They were very cautious about
doing something that alters not just, you know, air patterns, or
patterns of inequity, but actual commutes,” Pearlstein said.
</p>
<p>
As a reporter who has covered congestion pricing for nearly a decade, I
have learned never to underestimate the power of “car brain” on public
policy. As a New Yorker who lives steps from the entrance of the
Williamsburg Bridge on the Lower East Side, who watches mothers push
strollers through oceans of hot, heavy steel boxes belching poisonous
gasses driven by people on a hair trigger, and who has seen our leaders
pretend that this is New York, that we are too exceptional to change, I
cannot help but go about my day, doing my best to tune out the incessant
honking, feeling like the dog engulfed in flames:
“<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/this-is-fine" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>This
is fine</u></a>.”
</p>
<p>
That it took transportation advocates, regional planners, and
forward-looking politicians nearly 20 years to enact congestion pricing
in New York City — the U.S. municipality perhaps most amenable to it
because of its housing density and excellent mass transit system —
reveals the daunting task of weaning Americans off the automobile. More
than three-quarters of us
<a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/05/commute-america-sustainability-cars/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>drive
our own personal cars</u></a> to our jobs.
</p>
<p>
“The only thing that’s going to change the fact that the overwhelming
majority of Americans drive to work is not permitting reforms to
programs like congestion pricing. It’s permitting reforms to allow dense
housing development in metropolitan areas across the country,”
Pearlstein said.
</p>
<p>
“It’s a little bit like a Marxian analysis,” he mused. The crisis must
come to a head in order to overthrow the status quo. “In order to adopt
congestion pricing, you first have to exacerbate congestion
significantly by condensing your built environment.”

Day reveals a major split in how Joe Biden and Donald Trump would
govern</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Tax Day reveals a major split in how Joe Biden and
Donald Trump would govern: The presidential candidates have conflicting
ideas about how much to reveal about their own finances and the best
ways to boost the economy through tax policy.</p>
<p>Biden, the sitting Democratic president, plans to release his income
tax returns on Monday, the IRS filing deadline. And on Tuesday, he is
scheduled to deliver a speech in Scranton, Pennsylvania, about why the
wealthy should pay more in taxes to reduce the federal deficit and help
fund programs for the poor and middle class.</p>
<p>Biden is proud to say that he was largely without money for much of
his decades-long career in public service, unlike Trump, who inherited
hundreds of millions of dollars from his father and used his billionaire
status to launch a TV show and later a presidential campaign.</p>
<p>“For 36 years, I was listed as the poorest man in Congress,” Biden
told donors in California in February. “Not a joke.”</p>
<p>In 2015, Trump declared as part of his candidacy, “I’m really
rich.”</p>
<p>The Republican former president has argued that voters have no need
to see his tax data and that past financial disclosures are more than
sufficient. He maintains that keeping taxes low for the wealthy will
supercharge investment and lead to more jobs, while tax hikes would
crush an economy still recovering from inflation that hit a four-decade
peak in 2022.</p>
<p>“Biden wants to give the IRS even more cash by proposing the largest
tax hike on the American people in history when they are already being
robbed by his record-high inflation crisis,” said Karoline Leavitt,
press secretary for the Trump campaign.</p>
<p>The split goes beyond an ideological difference to a very real
challenge for whoever triumphs in the November election. At the end of
2025, many of the tax cuts that Trump signed into law in 2017 will
expire — setting up an avalanche of choices about how much people across
the income spectrum should pay as the national debt is expected to climb
to unprecedented levels.</p>
<p>Including interest costs, extending all the tax breaks could add
another $3.8 trillion to the national debt through 2033, according to an
analysis last year by the Committee for a Responsible Federal
Budget.</p>
<p>Biden would like to keep the majority of the tax breaks, based on his
pledge that no one earning less than $400,000 will have to pay more. But
he released a budget proposal this year with tax increases on the
wealthy and corporations that would raise $4.9 trillion in revenues and
trim forecasted deficits by $3.2 trillion over 10 years.</p>
<p>Still, he’s telling voters that he’s all for letting the Trump-era
tax cuts lapse.</p>
<p>“Does anyone here think the tax code is fair? Raise your hand,” Biden
said Tuesday at a speech in Washington’s Union Station to a crowd
predisposed to dislike Trump’s broad tax cuts that helped many in the
middle class but disproportionately favored wealthier households.</p>
<p>“It added more to the national debt than any presidential term in
history,” Biden continued. “And it’s due to expire next year. And guess
what? I hope to be president because it expires — it’s going to stay
expired.”</p>
<p>Trump has called for higher tariffs on foreign-made goods, which are
taxes that could hit consumers in the form of higher prices. But his
campaign is committed to tax cuts while promising that a Trump
presidency would reduce a national debt that has risen for decades,
including during his Oval Office tenure.</p>
<p>“When President Trump is back in the White House, he will advocate
for more tax cuts for all Americans and reinvigorate America’s energy
industry to bring down inflation, lower the cost of living, and pay down
our debt,” Leavitt said.</p>
<p>Most economists say Trump’s tax cuts could not generate enough growth
to pay down the national debt. An analysis released Friday by Oxford
Economics found that a “full-blown Trump” policy with tax cuts, higher
tariffs and blocking immigration would slow growth and increase
inflation.</p>
<p>Among Biden’s proposals is a “billionaire minimum income tax” that
would apply a minimum rate of 25% on households with a net worth of at
least $100 million.</p>
<p>The tax would directly target billionaires such as Trump, who refused
to release his personal taxes as presidents have traditionally done. But
six years of his tax returns were released in 2022 by Democrats on the
House Ways and Means Committee.</p>
<p>In 2018, Trump earned more than $24 million and paid about 4% of that
in federal income taxes. The congressional panel also found that the IRS
delayed legally mandated audits of Trump during his presidency, with the
panel concluding the audit process was “dormant, at best.”</p>
<p>Biden has publicly released more than two decades of his tax returns.
In 2022, he and his wife, Jill, made $579,514 and paid nearly 24% of
that in federal income taxes, more than double the rate paid by
Trump.</p>
<p>Trump has maintained that his tax records are complicated because of
his use of various tax credits and past business losses, which in some
cases have allowed him to avoid taxes. He also previously declined to
release his tax returns under the claim that the IRS was auditing him
for pre-presidential filings.</p>
<p>His finances recently received a boost from the stock market debut of
Trump Media, which controls Trump’s preferred social media outlet, Truth
Social. Share prices initially surged, adding billions of dollars to
Trump’s net worth, but investors have since soured on the company and
shares by Friday were down more than 50% from their peak.</p>
<p>The former president is also on the hook for $542 million due to
legal judgments in a civil fraud case and penalties owed to the writer
E. Jean Carroll because of statements made by Trump that damaged her
reputation after she accused him of sexual assault.</p>
<p>In the civil fraud case, New York Judge Arthur Engoron looked at the
financial records of the Trump Organization and concluded after looking
at the inflated assets that “the frauds found here leap off the page and
shock the conscience.”</p>

occurred to me watching a Martin Scorcese
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Harrison:_Living_in_the_Material_World">documentary</a>
about the life of George Harrison, how much people in music seek out
opportunities to create with other musicians. In technology, it doesn’t
happen, we don’t even look at each others software. After waiting a
whole lifetime for a culture of collaboration, we have had it for short
periods, but it’s most of the time it’s been people trying to
deconstruct and reinvent other people’s work, not build on it. I’m still
open to this changing. I hope to be a catalyst for it, one more

don’t like how betting has invaded sports broadcasting. I don’t like
that it breaks the bond among people who root for one team their whole
lives, as I have with the Knicks and the Mets. I think of people who
love the same teams as I do as family. I like that there are Knicks fans
who also like the Yankees even though I totally despise the Yankees and
everything they (don’t) stand for, but we all love the freaking Knicks
(and ignore the Nets, btw). Before long there won’t be any of us left,
everyone will see sports as a business, an obsession, or their downfall,
because you can’t win at gambling, we all know that. The whole tribal
thing about sports is broken by integrated gambling, it suggests many of
us, maybe eventually most of us, are here not for love of team, rather
they’re feeding an addiction.</p>

<h2 id="us-suggests-israel-need-not-retaliate-against-iran">US suggests
Israel need not retaliate against Iran</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Top officials in Washington are attempting to avoid a
widening war in the Middle East after Iran launched an unprecedented
attack on Israel with explosive drones and missiles.</p>
<p>“There need to be some consequences here,” said a senior U.S.
official briefing reporters Sunday afternoon on the condition of not
being named.</p>
<p>But U.S. President Joe Biden, in his latest conversation with Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, “made very clear to the prime
minister last night that we do have to think carefully and strategically
about risks of escalation,” especially in view of the attack causing
only light damage and no significant casualties, the official said.</p>
<p>Israeli officials insist there will be a response, but the country’s
war Cabinet appears divided on how and when.</p>
<p>If Israel retaliates, it would be doing it alone.</p>
<p>“We would not envision ourselves participating in such a thing,”
replied the senior administration official when asked whether the United
States would participate in any military response to the Iranian
attack.</p>
<p>It was an “incredible military achievement” by Israel, the United
States and other partners in repelling “more than 300 drones and
missiles” launched by Iran, according to White House national security
spokesperson John Kirby.</p>
<p>US Central Command says its forces, supported by US European Command
destroyers, on Saturday and on Sunday morning “successfully engaged and
destroyed more than 80 one-way attack uncrewed aerial vehicles (OWA UAV)
and at least six ballistic missiles intended to strike Israel from Iran
and Yemen. This includes a ballistic missile on its launcher vehicle and
seven UAVs destroyed on the ground in Iranian-backed Houthi controlled
areas of Yemen prior to their launch.”</p>
<p>U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, in a statement late Saturday,
said the explosive aircraft and missiles were launched from the
territories of Iran, Iraq, Syria and Yemen.</p>
<p>“We call on Iran to immediately halt any further attacks, including
from its proxy forces, and to deescalate tensions,” Austin said. “We do
not seek conflict with Iran, but we will not hesitate to act to protect
our forces and support the defense of Israel.”</p>
<p>He spoke by phone Sunday for the third time during the weekend with
Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant.</p>
<p>Biden convened a hastily arranged video conference Sunday of leaders
of the Group of Seven nations to coordinate a united diplomatic response
to the Iranian attack.</p>
<p>“With its actions, Iran has further stepped toward the
destabilization of the region and risks provoking an uncontrollable
regional escalation. This must be avoided,” the G7 leaders said in a
group statement issued after their meeting. “We will continue to work to
stabilize the situation and avoid further escalation. In this spirit, we
demand that Iran and its proxies cease their attacks, and we stand ready
to take further measures now and in response to further destabilizing
initiatives.”</p>
<p>Biden spoke by phone with Netanyahu on Saturday evening to “reaffirm
America’s ironclad commitment to the security of Israel.”</p>
<p>Biden told Netanyahu, according to media reports, that since the
Iranian attack caused only minimal casualties and damage, Israel should
not retaliate against Iran.</p>
<p>Both Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken have been calling
leaders in the region to make it clear that while Washington does not
seek a direct military confrontation with Tehran, the United States will
not hesitate to continue to defend Israel.</p>
<p>Biden had rushed back to Washington from a visit to Delaware earlier
Saturday and convened a meeting in the White House Situation Room with
key officials of his Cabinet as Iran launched the unprecedented attack
after vowing to retaliate over an April 1 suspected Israeli airstrike on
Iran’s consulate in Damascus.</p>
<p>Israel has neither confirmed nor denied responsibility for the
strike.</p>
<p>The U.S. military began moving extra troops and equipment to sites in
the Middle East, defense officials confirmed Friday. It has about 40,000
troops in the region.</p>
<p>The U.S. Navy moved two guided-missile destroyers capable of
intercepting drones and incoming missiles closer to Israel in
anticipation of the Iranian attack, The Wall Street Journal
reported.</p>
<p>U.S. Navy Red Sea forces have previously intercepted long-range
missiles launched toward Israel from Yemen by the Iranian-allied Houthi
forces.</p>
<p>The Biden administration’s response to the Iranian attack will be
closely watched by his political opponents, coming less than seven
months before a general election rematch between the Democratic Party
incumbent and his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Trump, speaking Saturday at a rally in Schnecksville, Pennsylvania,
claimed the attack “would not have happened if we were in office.” He
did not elaborate on how.</p>
<p>“God bless the people of Israel,” he said. “They are under attack
right now. That’s because we show great weakness.”</p>
<p>House Speaker Mike Johnson, who has failed to permit a floor vote on
bipartisan legislation passed by the Senate providing security aid to
Israel and Ukraine, is accusing Biden’s administration of undermining
Israel and appeasing Iran and that “contributed to these terrible
developments.”</p>
<p>A Republican congressman, Mike Turner of the state of Ohio, is
calling for a more robust response from Biden.</p>
<p>“I think the administration needs to take seriously that this attack
has happened. It’s unprecedented and certainly it needs to be viewed as
an escalation. This is an escalating conflict,” Turner, who chairs the
intelligence committee in the House, said on NBC’s “Meet the Press”
program Sunday.</p>
<p>Democrat Chris Coons, of Biden’s home state of Delaware, is urging
lawmakers to pass Biden’s request for military aid to Israel.</p>
<p>“The House should promptly pass this coming week the long-delayed
national security supplemental to ensure that our Israeli allies have
everything they need to defend themselves from attacks by Iran and its
proxies,” he said.</p>
