Class Action Against McGraw Hill: the Importance of Publishing
Contracts</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-15, from: Authors Union blogs</p>
<p>At the heart of the Flynn v. McGraw Hill case is a breach of contract
claim. The plaintiffs argue that McGraw Hill’s royalty deductions for
maintaining its online system violated the terms of the agreement.
Central to the argument is the publisher’s promise to ‘publish at its
own expense.’ This case serves as a prime example of how important it is
to scrutinize the details of a publishing agreement, where the devil
often lies.</p>
