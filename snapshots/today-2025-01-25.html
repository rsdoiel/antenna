<h2 id="openai-canvas-gets-a-huge-upgrade">OpenAI Canvas gets a huge
upgrade</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-25, updated: 2025-01-25, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://twitter.com/openai/status/1882876172339757392">OpenAI
Canvas gets a huge upgrade</a></strong>
</p>
<a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-canvas/">Canvas</a> is the
ChatGPT feature where ChatGPT can open up a shared editing environment
and collaborate with the user on creating a document or piece of code.
Today it got a very significant upgrade, which as far as I can tell was
announced exclusively by tweet:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Canvas update: today we’re rolling out a few highly-requested updates to
canvas in ChatGPT.
</p>
<p>
✅ Canvas now works with OpenAI o1—Select o1 from the model picker and
use the toolbox icon or the “/canvas” command
</p>
<p>
✅ Canvas can render HTML &amp; React code
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Here’s
<a href="https://twitter.com/openaidevs/status/1882876844208472339">a
follow-up tweet</a> with a video demo.
</p>
<p>
Talk about burying the lede! The ability to render HTML leapfrogs Canvas
into being a direct competitor to Claude Artifacts, previously
Anthropic’s single most valuable exclusive consumer-facing feature.
</p>
<p>
Also similar to Artifacts: the HTML rendering feature in Canvas is
almost entirely undocumented. It appears to be able to import additional
libraries from a CDN - but which libraries? There’s clearly some kind of
optional build step used to compile React JSX to working code, but the
details are opaque.
</p>
<p>
I got an error message, <code>Build failed with 1 error:
internal:user-component.js:10:17: ERROR: Expected “}” but found
“:”</code> - which I couldn’t figure out how to fix, and neither could
the Canvas “fix this bug” helper feature.
</p>
<p>
<p>This feature has so much potential. I use Artifacts on an almost
daily basis to
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/21/claude-artifacts/">build
useful interactive tools</a> on demand to solve small problems for me -
but it took quite some work for me to find the edges of that tool and
figure out how best to apply it.</p>

<h2 id="a-selfish-personal-argument-for-releasing-code-as-open-source">A
selfish personal argument for releasing code as Open Source</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-24, updated: 2025-01-24, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
I’m the guest for the most recent episode of the Real Python podcast
with Christopher Bailey, talking about
<a href="https://realpython.com/podcasts/rpp/236/">Using LLMs for Python
Development</a>. We covered a <em>lot</em> of other topics as well -
most notably my relationship with Open Source development over the
years.
</p>
<p>
At <a href="https://realpython.com/podcasts/rpp/236/#t=332">5m32s</a> I
presented what I think is the best version yet of my selfish personal
argument for why it makes sense to default to releasing code as Open
Source:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I didn’t really get heavily back into open source until about maybe six
years ago when I’d been working for a big company in the US, and I got
frustrated that all of the code I was writing, I’d never get to use
again.
</p>
<p>
I realized that one of the best things about open source software is
that you can solve a problem once and then you can slap an open source
license on that solution and you will <em>never</em> have to solve that
problem ever again, no matter who’s employing you in the future.
</p>
<p>
It’s a sneaky way of solving a problem permanently.
</p>
<p>
Once I realized that I started open sourcing everything, like pretty
much every piece of code I’ve written in the past six years, I’ve open
sourced purely as a defense against me losing access to that code in the
future.
</p>
<p>
Because I’ve written loads of code for employers that I don’t get to use
anymore - and how many times do you want to reinvent things?
</p>
<p>
I like to say that my interest in open source is actually really
selfish. I figured something out. I never want to have to do this work
ever again.
</p>
<p>
If I slap a license on it, write documentation for it so that I can
remember what it does and write unit tests for it so it’s easy for me to
keep it working in the future, that’s entirely beneficial to me.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The rest of the episode was a really great conversation - other topics
we covered included:
</p>

<li>
<a href="https://realpython.com/podcasts/rpp/236/#t=244">4m40s</a>: My

<h2 id="our-customers-demand-terrible-ai-systems">Our Customers Demand
Terrible AI Systems</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-24, from: McSweeney’s Internet Tendency</p>
<p>
We’ve been banging our heads against the wall, trying to think of the
new “it” thing our customers want. At one point, somebody suggested
improving our product, but then we thought of something better—something
totally groundbreaking, something absolutely huge. We should implement a
terrible AI system.
</p>
<p>
Customers only care about one thing: barely functioning AI crammed into
every facet of their lives. We all know this. That’s why anybody who’s
anybody has slapped AI onto their product. AI phone, AI refrigerator, AI
stick. If it doesn’t have AI, what the fuck are we even doing?
</p>
<p>
Up until recently, the industry was pretty stagnant. We had been relying
on outdated ideas like “ready for market,” “finished product,” and
“works reasonably well.” We were all stuck selling products that broke
only after a few years. Now, we’re finally innovating by cutting to the
chase and selling products that are already broken.
</p>
<p>
I know I’m personally tired of products pretending like they work for a
bit, then getting hit with a surprise “This device is not compatible
with the newest update,” or “You need a subscription service to continue
using this product,” or “Nobody said it was waterproof.” Just give me my
broken garbage and quit playing games.
</p>
<p>
Before anybody states the obvious, I understand that terrible AI systems
are technically terrible, but I’ll be damned if they’re not confident.
Like yeah, it may be wrong when I ask it a question, but it
<i>sounds</i> right. What naysayers don’t seem to realize is that people
respond better to a confident liar shouting out answers than a polite
expert. Women can back me up on this.
</p>
<p>
Plus, isn’t it kind of exciting? For instance, maybe you looked up how
to change your oil, and now your brakes don’t work. Doesn’t that sound
fun? Just living in a constant state of fear that all of the information
you have access to is anywhere from a little to very wrong?
</p>
<p>
The only people who don’t like terrible AI don’t understand it. So, let
me break it down for you. The “A” stands for “artificial,” and the “I”
also stands for something, but I can never remember what it is. I want
to say the internet? I just checked with AI, and it confirmed it stands
for “artificial internet.” Anyway, AI means futuristic and better. And
this better future not only has extra fingers but is also illiterate.
</p>
<p>
If you’re still not convinced, it’s probably because you think AI is a
feature that adds value. That’s all wrong. It’s not a feature; it’s more
of an idea. Obviously, everyone can tell that AI isn’t working
correctly, but you can see what it’s going for, and wouldn’t it be
pretty amazing if it <i>did</i> work? Man, that would be pretty
impressive. The value added is a feeling that you’re on the cutting edge
of technology even though you’re using a product that is now actively
worse.
</p>
<p>
And if we’re not ready to take the plunge into AI, we at least need to
call one of our preexisting systems “AI.” Lots of companies do this.
Just rename things to AI. Chatbot: AI. Automated voice messaging system:
AI. Outsourced customer service rep in Myanmar: AI. If companies aren’t
even pretending to have AI, they will lose their customers’ trust.
</p>
<p>
At the end of the day, we have to add AI to our product. We don’t really
have a choice. It’s best to think of terrible AI as if it’s your
deadbeat brother-in-law. Sure, nobody asked Michael to stay on your
couch for six months, but there he is, making bad music, hallucinating,
and teaching the kids how to make bombs. He’s forced his way into your
home in the same way AI has forced itself into our products. There’s
really no use in fighting it, because, like it or not, artificial
internet isn’t going anywhere anytime soon.

<i>With stable employment exceedingly difficult to come by,
intellectually disabled adults have another, occasionally lucrative, way
of participating in American society: they can become artists.</i>
</p>
<div class="break">

<p>
On a Monday morning in early June, Nicole Storm arrived at the Creative
Growth Art Center in downtown Oakland, California. Light poured in
through broad windows that faced the street. Nicole put her jacket and
lunch away in the closet and then selected a large piece of cardboard
from a stack in a hallway. A staff member helped her secure the
makeshift canvas to an easel and set out her paints and markers. She
chatted with some fellow artists and then explained to me that she is
starting a new project, after having finished a few paintings last week.
Nicole refers to her artistic process as “taking notes.” It is a way for
her to organize the events of a day, although the results never look
like a typical archive or journal. She creates bright washes of color
that provide a glowing background for lines and shapes that appear like
an indeterminate form of writing. Nicole records what is going on around
her with marks that may initially seem impulsive and spontaneous. But
they are the culmination of a well-honed practice, undeniable
creativity, and decades of sustained work.
</p>
<p>
Nicole was born in 1967, during what her mother, Diane, refers to as
“the tail end of the Dark Ages,” when someone like Nicole, who has Down
syndrome, would almost certainly have lived her entire life in an
institution. At that time, Diane recalls, “I sent away for some
information about Down syndrome and what I got was bleak. The life
expectancy was twelve years. Fifty percent of people were dead before
their fifth birthday. So I threw that stuff in the trash and decided to
do it my way.”
</p>
<p>
Diane and Nicole are closer than most mothers and their adult daughters.
They live together, and Diane volunteers once a week at Creative Growth
when Nicole is there. Nicole inherited Diane’s round face and direct
stare. They both speak with a great deal of confidence. Diane attributes
Nicole’s confidence to how she “ran with the pack” as a kid; she was
thrown into the deep end of progressive schools that included her with
the rest of the students. Diane’s confidence developed out of her fierce
advocacy for Nicole and a lifetime of fighting with bureaucratic systems
that did little more than tell her what her daughter would not be able
to do. I mentioned to Diane that my daughter, like Nicole, has Down
syndrome. “You know how it goes then,” she said. “We had no support when
she was growing up, but I’m sure your daughter has a bright future.”
</p>
<p>
Diane is right. My daughter is part of a generation with more
opportunities to attend school with her peers, although she still faces
plenty of challenges. I hope she might be able to find a job and work in
a supportive community. But historically our society has expected very
little of people with intellectual disabilities, which makes Nicole’s
success as an artist all the more remarkable.
</p>
<p>
When Nicole was in her twenties, Diane searched for a day program that
Nicole could attend while she worked full-time. But they struggled to
find a suitable situation that met Nicole’s need for routine and
predictability. She spent most of her days on public transportation.
Diane recalled a time when Nicole traveled with a group to an event at a
library in Berkeley, only to have to catch another bus fifteen minutes
later to come back home. Eventually Nicole moved into a group home for
people with disabilities, where she lived in an apartment with the help
of support staff. Both Nicole and Diane believed this was the
independence Nicole deserved. But after two and a half years, she wasn’t
thriving. Nicole wasn’t developing much of a life outside her apartment,
and the support staff wasn’t as attentive as Diane had expected. After
Nicole became seriously ill with pneumonia, they decided they had had
enough. Nicole went back to living with Diane. An artist friend told
them about Creative Growth, and Nicole started attending the program
regularly. The new sense of routine and purpose transformed her almost
overnight.
</p>
<p>
“It was the most wonderful moment,” Nicole remembered.
</p>
<p>
“You’re right,” said Diane. “That’s when the magic started to happen.”

<p>date: 2025-01-24, from: Blog by Fabrizio Ferri-Benedetti</p>
<p>
Writing for LLMs is the new SEO obsession. Not a day passes without
seeing some question popping up in tech writing communities about how to
best compose content for AI scrapers. Folks even wonder if a different
style guide should be necessary, or whether tables should be avoided
because they’ve seen
<a href="https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/WSL/pull/2021#issuecomment-2546627586">a
pull request</a> rejected in a Microsoft repository on the silliest
grounds.

<h2 id="anthropics-new-citations-api">Anthropic’s new Citations API</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-24, updated: 2025-01-24, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
Here’s a new API-only feature from Anthropic that requires quite a bit
of assembly in order to unlock the value:

<h4 id="citations-for-rag">
Citations for Retrieval Augmented Generation
</h4>
<p>
The core of the <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/rag/">Retrieval
Augmented Generation</a> (RAG) pattern is to take a user’s question,
retrieve portions of documents that might be relevant to that question
and then answer the question by including those text fragments in the
context provided to the LLM.
</p>
<p>
This usually works well, but there is still a risk that the model may
answer based on other information from its training data (sometimes OK)
or hallucinate entirely incorrect details (definitely bad).
</p>
<p>
The <em>best</em> way to help mitigate these risks is to support the
answer with citations that incorporate direct quotations from the
underlying source documents. This even acts as a form of fact-checking:
the user can confirm that the quoted text did indeed come from those
documents, helping provide relatively robust protection against
hallucinated details resulting in incorrect answers.
</p>
<p>
Actually building a system that does this can be quite tricky. Matt
Yeung described a pattern for this he called
<a href="https://mattyyeung.github.io/deterministic-quoting">Deterministic
Quoting</a> last April, where answers are accompanied by direct
quotations from the source documents that are guaranteed to be copied
across and not lossily transformed by the model.
</p>
<p>
This is a great idea, but actually building it requires some quite
sophisticated prompt engineering and complex implementation code.
</p>
<p>
Claude’s new
<a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/citations">Citations
API</a> mechanism handles the difficult parts of this for you. You still
need to implement most of RAG - identifying potentially relevant
documents, then feeding that content in as part of the prompt - but
Claude’s API will then do the difficult work of extracting relevant
citations and including them in the response that it sends back to you.
</p>
<h4 id="trying-out-the-new-api-with-uv-run">
Trying out the new API with uv run
</h4>
<p>
I tried the API out using Anthropic’s Python client library, which was
<a href="https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python/commit/67aa83e5d589f6afad5fbc8bd2e616cc71a80a29">just
updated</a> to support the citations API.
</p>
<p>
I ran a scratch Python 3.13 interpreter with that package using
<a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/">uv run</a> like this (after first
setting the necessary <code>ANTHROPIC_API_KEY</code> environment
variable using
<a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/help.html#llm-keys-get-help">llm
keys get</a>):
</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell">
<pre><span class="pl-k">export</span> ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span><span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">$(</span>llm keys get claude<span class="pl-pds">)</span></span><span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>
uv run --with anthropic --python 3.13 python</pre>
</div>
<p>
Python 3.13 has
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.13.html#a-better-interactive-interpreter">a
nicer interactive interpreter</a> which you can more easily paste code
into. Using <code>uv run</code> like this gives me an environment with
that package pre-installed without me needing to setup a virtual
environment as a separate step.
</p>
<p>
Then I ran the following code, adapted from
<a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/citations">Anthropic’s
example</a>. The
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/9fbb3c2e2c40c181727e497e358fd7ce">text.txt

Here’s

full response</a>.
</p>
<p>
This format is pretty interesting! It’s the standard Claude format but
those <code>“content”</code> blocks now include an optional additional
<code>“citations”</code> key which contains a list of relevant citation
extracts that support the claim in the <code>“text”</code> block.

<p>
Eyeballing the JSON output wasn’t particularly fun. I wanted a very
quick tool to help me see that output in a more visual way.
</p>
<p>
A trick I’ve been using a lot recently is that LLMs like Claude are
<em>really</em> good at writing code to turn arbitrary JSON shapes like
this into a more human-readable format.
</p>
<p>
I fired up my
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/19/one-shot-python-tools/#custom-instructions">Artifacts
project</a>, pasted in the above JSON and prompted it like this:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Build a tool where I can paste JSON like this into a textarea and the
result will be rendered in a neat way - it should should intersperse
text with citations, where each citation has the cited_text rendered in
a blockquote
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It helped me
<a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/render-claude-citations">build
this tool</a>
(<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/85bd050908486de36b078c8c7d01e903">follow-up
prompt here</a>), which lets you paste in JSON and produces a rendered
version of the text:

</p>
<h4 id="now-i-need-to-design-an-abstraction-layer-for-llm">
Now I need to design an abstraction layer for LLM
</h4>
<p>
I’d like to upgrade my <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a> tool
and <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-claude-3">llm-claude-3</a>
plugin to include support for this new feature… but doing so is going to
be relatively non-trivial.
</p>
<p>
The problem is that LLM currently bakes in an assumption that all LLMs
respond with a stream of text.
</p>
<p>
With citations, this is no longer true! Claude is now returning chunks
of text that aren’t just a plain string - they are annotated with
citations, which need to be stored and processed somehow by the LLM
library.
</p>
<p>
This isn’t the only edge-case of this type. DeepSeek recently released
their Reasoner API which has a similar problem: it can return two
different types of text, one showing reasoning text and one showing
final content. I
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/a5ca117dd0325c93a5b1f5a18c4a9e34">described
those differences here</a>.
</p>
<p>
I’ve opened a design issue to tackle this challenge in the LLM
repository: <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/716">Design an
abstraction for responses that are not just a stream of text</a>.
</p>
<h4 id="anthropic-s-strategy-contrasted-with-openai">
Anthropic’s strategy contrasted with OpenAI
</h4>
<p>
Another interesting aspect of this release is how it helps illustrate a
strategic difference between Anthropic and OpenAI.
</p>
<p>
OpenAI are increasingly behaving like a consumer products company. They
just made a big splash with their
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/23/introducing-operator/">Operator</a>
browser-automation agent system - a much more polished, consumer-product
version of Anthropic’s own
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/23/introducing-operator/">Computer
Use</a> demo from a few months ago.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, Anthropic are clearly focused much more on the developer /
“enterprise” market. This Citations feature is API-only and directly
addresses a specific need that developers trying to build reliable RAG
systems on top of their platform may not even have realized they had.

<blockquote cite="https://dustinewers.com/ignore-the-grifters/">
<p>
AI tools create a significant productivity boost for developers.
Different folks report different gains, but most people who try AI code
generation recognize its ability to increase velocity. Many people think
that means we’re going to need fewer developers, and our industry is
going to slowly circle the drain.
</p>
<p>
This view is based on a misunderstanding of why people pay for software.
A business creates software because they think that it will give them
some sort of economic advantage. The investment needs to pay for itself
with interest. There are many software projects that would help a
business, but businesses aren’t going to do them because the return on
investment doesn’t make sense.
</p>
<p>
When software development becomes more efficient, the ROI of any given
software project increases, which unlocks more projects. […] Cheaper
software means people are going to want more of it. More software means
more jobs for increasingly efficient software developers.

How did a Russian spy manage to infiltrate the upper echelons of London

honeytrap or was she underestimated by the world’s press? What was life
like for wealthy Russians in “Londongrad” in the early 21st century?
