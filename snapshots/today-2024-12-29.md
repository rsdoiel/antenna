## Google search hallucinates Encanto 2

date: 2024-12-29, updated: 2024-12-29, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3leezrzlvrk2m">Google search hallucinates Encanto 2</a></strong></p>
Jason Schreier on Bluesky:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was excited to tell my kids that there's a sequel to Encanto, only to scroll down and learn that Google's AI just completely made this up</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I just replicated the same result by <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=encanto+2&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en-us&amp;client=safari">searching Google for encanto 2</a>. Here's what the "AI overview" at the top of the page looked like:</p>
<p><img alt="Search Labs | Al Overview. Encanto 2: A New Generation is an animated musical fantasy comedy film that is scheduled for release in the United States on August 25, 2024. lt is the sequel to the 2021 Disney film Encanto. Here are some details about the film: Plot: The film takes place years after the original and centers on a new generation of the Madrigal family, led by an older Mirabel and her grandson, José. Directors: Byron Howard and Jared Bush are directing the film. Show more..." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/encanto-2.jpg" /></p>
<p>Only when I clicked the "Show more" link did it become clear what had happened:</p>
<p><img alt="Writers: Jared Bush and Charise Castro Smith are writing the film. Music: Lin-Manuel Miranda will write original songs for the film, as he did for the
original. Some say that a sequel to Encanto is logical because of the film's huge  investment in the franchise. Jared Bush, who co-directed the original Encanto, has hinted that a sequel may be in the works. He said, &quot;I would love to spend more time in the Madrigal House and return to Encanto.” Generative Al is experimental" src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/encanto-2-2.jpg" /></p>
<p>The link in that first snippet was to the <a href="https://ideas.fandom.com/wiki/Encanto_2:_A_New_Generation">Encanto 2: A New Generation</a> page on <a href="https://ideas.fandom.com/">Idea Wiki</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a fanon wiki, and just like fan-fiction wikis, this one has a variety of fan created ideas on here! These include potential sequels and new series that have yet to exist.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other cited links included <a href="https://screenrant.com/encanto-movie-live-action-images-mirabel-madrigal-family/">this article about Instagram fan art</a> and <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/entertainment/news/encantos-sequel-chances-addressed-by-disney-director/ar-AA1u7ZJB">Encanto's Sequel Chances Addressed by Disney Director</a>, a very thin article built around a short quote from Encanto's director at D23 Brazil.</p>
<p>And that August 2024 release date (which the AI summary weirdly lists as "scheduled for release" despite that date being five months in the past)? It's from the Idea Wiki imaginary info box for the film.</p>
<p>This is a particularly clear example of how badly wrong AI summarization can go. LLMs are gullible: they believe what you tell them, and the web is full of misleading information - some of which is completely innocent.</p>
<p id="hallucination"><strong>Update</strong>: I've had some pushback over my use of the term "hallucination" here, on the basis that the LLM itself is doing what it's meant to: summarizing the RAG content that has been provided to it by the host system.</p>

<p>That's fair: this is not a classic LLM hallucination, where the LLM produces incorrect data purely from knowledge partially encoded in its weights.</p>
<p>I classify this a bug in Google's larger LLM-powered AI overview system. That system should be able to take the existence of invalid data sources into account - given how common searches for non-existent movie sequels (or TV seasons) are, I would hope that AI overviews could classify such searches and take extra steps to avoid serving misleading answers.</p>
<p>So think this is a "hallucination" bug in the AI overview system itself: it's making statements about the world that are not true.

## Ads After You Do a Thing

date: 2024-12-28, from: Chris Coyier blog

I&#8217;ve been noticing a certain type of ad placement lately I have no better name for than &#8220;ads after you do a thing&#8221;. I&#8217;m sure they aren&#8217;t new, they just feel new to me as I&#8217;ve been thinking about it. Examples: What distinguishes these to me is that: they aren&#8217;t terribly annoying. I&#8217;ve already done [&#8230;]

## My Approach to Building Large Technical Projects

date: 2024-12-28, updated: 2024-12-28, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://mitchellh.com/writing/building-large-technical-projects">My Approach to Building Large Technical Projects</a></strong></p>
Mitchell Hashimoto wrote this piece about taking on large projects back in June 2023. The project he described in the post is a terminal emulator written in Zig called <a href="https://ghostty.org/">Ghostty</a> which just reached its <a href="https://mitchellh.com/writing/ghostty-1-0-reflection">1.0 release</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've learned that when I break down my large tasks in chunks that result in seeing tangible forward progress, I tend to finish my work and retain my excitement throughout the project. People are all motivated and driven in different ways, so this may not work for you, but as a broad generalization I've not found an engineer who doesn't get excited by a good demo. And the goal is to always give yourself a good demo.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For backend-heavy projects the lack of an initial UI is a challenge here, so Mitchell advocates for early automated tests as a way to start exercising code and seeing progress right from the start. Don't let tests get in the way of demos though:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No matter what I'm working on, I try to build one or two demos per week intermixed with automated test feedback as explained in the previous section.</p>
<p>Building a demo also provides you with invaluable product feedback. You can quickly intuit whether something <em>feels good</em>, even if it isn't fully functional.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For more on the development of Ghostty see <a href="https://mitchellh.com/writing/ghostty-and-useful-zig-patterns">this talk</a> Mitchell gave at Zig Showtime last year:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I want the terminal to be a modern platform for text application development, analogous to the browser being a modern platform for GUI application development (for better or worse).</p>

## Quoting Jo Kristian Bergum

date: 2024-12-28, updated: 2024-12-28, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<blockquote cite="https://twitter.com/jobergum/status/1872923872007217309"><p>Looking back, it's clear we overcomplicated things. While embeddings fundamentally changed how we can represent and compare content, they didn't need an entirely new infrastructure category. What we label as "vector databases" are, in reality, search engines with vector capabilities. The market is already correcting this categorization—vector search providers rapidly add traditional search features while established search engines incorporate vector search capabilities. This category convergence isn't surprising: building a good retrieval engine has always been about combining multiple retrieval and ranking strategies. Vector search is just another powerful tool in that toolbox, not a category of its own.</p></blockquote>
