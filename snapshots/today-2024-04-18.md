## 23 Apr 2024

date: 2024-04-24, from: Miguel de Icaza's blog

<h1 id="embeddable-game-engine">Embeddable Game Engine</h1>
<p><img
src="https://migueldeicaza.github.io/SwiftGodotDocs/images/SwiftGodot%20Header.png"
align="right" width=240>
Many years ago, when working at Xamarin, where we were building cross-platform
libraries for mobile developers, we wanted to offer both 2D and 3D gaming
capabilities for our users in the form of adding 2D or 3D content to their
mobile applications.</p>
<p>For 2D, we contributed and developed assorted Cocos2D-inspired libraries.</p>
<p>For 3D, the situation was more complex. We funded a few over the years, and we
contributed to others over the years, but nothing panned out (the
history of this is worth a dedicated post).</p>
<p>Around 2013, we looked around, and there were two contenders at the
time, one was an embeddable engine with many cute features but not great UI
support called Urho, and the other one was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godot_(game_engine)">Godot</a>, which had a great IDE, but
did not support being embedded.</p>
<p>I reached out to Juan at the time to discuss whether Godot could be turned into
such engine.   While I tend to take copious notes of all my meetings, those
notes sadly were gone as part of the Microsoft acquisition, but from what I can
remember Juan told me, &quot;Godot is not what you are looking for&quot; in two dimensions,
there were no immediate plans to turn it into an embeddable library, and it was
not as advanced as Urho, so he recommended that I go with Urho.</p>
<p>We invested heavily in binding Urho and created
<a href="https://github.com/xamarin/urho">UrhoSharp</a> that would go into becoming a <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/xamarin/bring-3d-models-life-augmented-reality-urhosharp/">great
3D library for our C# users</a> and worked not only on every desktop and mobile
platform, but we did a ton of work to make it great for AR and VR headsets.
Sadly, Microsoft's management left UrhoSharp to die.</p>
<p>Then, the maintainer of Urho stepped down, and Godot became one of the most
popular open-source projects in the world.</p>
<p>Last year, @Faolan-Rad <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/72883">contributed a patch to Godot</a> to turn it into a library
that could be embedded into applications.   I used this library to build
<a href="https://github.com/migueldeicaza/SwiftGodotKit">SwiftGodotKit</a> and have been
very happy with it ever since - allowing people to embed Godot content into
their application.</p>
<p>However, the patch had severe limitations; it could only ever run one Godot game as
an embedded system and could not do much more.   The folks at <a href="https://www.smirk.gg">Smirk
Software</a> wanted to take this further. They wanted to host
independent Godot scenes in their app and have more control over those so
they could sprinkle Godot content at their heart's content on their mobile app (<a href="https://x.com/JoshBromberg1/status/1721564103859114132">demo</a>)</p>
<p>They funded some initial work to do this and hired <a href="https://migeran.com">Gergely
Kis's company</a> to do this work.</p>
<p>Gergely demoed this work at GodotCon last year.   I came back very excited from
GodotCon and I decided to turn my <a href="https://x.com/migueldeicaza/status/1723765594653167892">prototype Godot on iPad</a> into a <a href="https://blog.la-terminal.net/igodot/">complete
product</a>.</p>
<p>One of the features that I needed was the ability to embed chunks of Godot in
discrete components in my iPad UI, so we worked with Gergely to productize and
polish this patch for general consumption.</p>
<p>Now, there is a <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/90510">complete patch under review</a> to allow people to embed arbitrary
Godot scenes into their apps.   For SwiftUI users, this means that you can embed a Godot scene into a <code>View</code> and display and control it at will.</p>
<p>Hopefully, the team will accept this change into Godot, and once this is done, I will
update SwiftGodotKit to get these new capabilities to Swift users (bindings for
other platforms and languages are left as an exercise to the reader).</p>
<p>It only took a decade after talking to Juan, but I am back firmly in Godot land.</p>

## 25 years after Columbine, trauma shadows survivors of school shooting

date: 2024-04-18, from: VOA News USA

Denver, Colo. — Hours after she escaped the Columbine High School shooting, 14-year-old Missy Mendo slept between her parents in bed, still wearing the shoes she had on when she fled her math class. She wanted to be ready to run.


Twenty-five years later, and with Mendo now a mother herself, the trauma from that horrific day remains close on her heels. 


It caught up to her when 60 people were shot dead in 2017 at a country music festival in Las Vegas, a city she had visited a lot while working in the casino industry. Then again in 2022, when 19 students and two teachers were shot and killed in Uvalde, Texas. 


Mendo had been filling out her daughter's pre-kindergarten application when news of the elementary school shooting broke. She read a few lines of a news story about Uvalde, then put her head down and cried. 


"It felt like nothing changed," she recalls thinking. 




In the quarter-century since two gunmen at Columbine shot and killed 12 fellow students and a teacher in suburban Denver — an attack that played out on live television and ushered in the modern era of school shootings — the traumas of that day have continued to shadow Mendo and others who were there. 


Some needed years to view themselves as Columbine survivors since they were not physically wounded. Yet things like fireworks could still trigger disturbing memories. The aftershocks — often unacknowledged in the years before mental health struggles were more widely recognized — led to some survivors suffering insomnia, dropping out of school, or disengaging from their spouses or families. 


Survivors and other members of the community plan to attend a candlelight vigil on the steps of the state's capitol Friday night, the eve of the shooting's anniversary. 


April is particularly hard for Mendo, 39, whose "brain turns to mashed potatoes" each year. She shows up at dentist appointments early, misplaces her keys, forgets to close the refrigerator door. 




She leans on therapy and the understanding of an expanding group of shooting survivors she has met through The Rebels Project, a support group founded by other Columbine survivors following a 2012 shooting when a gunman killed 12 people at a movie theater in the nearby suburb of Aurora. Mendo started seeing a therapist after her child's first birthday, at the urging of fellow survivor moms. 


After she broke down over Uvalde, Mendo, a single parent, said she talked to her mom, took a walk to get some fresh air, then finished her daughter's pre-kindergarten application. 


"Was I afraid of her going into the public school system? Absolutely," Mendo said of her daughter. "I wanted her to have as normal of a life as possible." 


Researchers who've studied the long-term effects of gun violence in schools have quantified protracted struggles among survivors, including long-term academic effects like absenteeism and reduced college enrollment, and lower earnings later in life. 


"Just counting lives lost is kind of an incorrect way to capture the full cost of these tragedies," said Maya Rossin-Slater, an associate professor in the Stanford University School of Medicine's Department of Health Policy. 


Mass killings have recurred with numbing frequency in the years since Columbine, with almost 600 attacks in which four or more people have died, not including the perpetrator, since 2006, according to data compiled by The Associated Press. 




More than 80% of the 3,045 victims in those attacks were killed by a firearm. 


Nationwide hundreds of thousands of people have been exposed to school shootings that are often not mass-casualty events but still traumatic, Rossin-Slater said. The impacts can last a lifetime, she added, resulting in "kind of a persistent, reduced potential" for survivors. 


Those who were present at Columbine say the years since have given them time to learn more about what happened to them and how to cope with it. 


Heather Martin, now 42, was a Columbine senior in 1999. In college, she began crying during a fire drill, realizing later that a fire alarm had gone off for three hours when she and 60 other students hid in a barricaded office during the high school shooting. She couldn't return to that class and was marked absent each time, and says she failed it after refusing to write a final paper on school violence, despite telling her professor of her experience at Columbine. 




It took 10 years for her to see herself as a survivor, after she was invited back with the rest of the class of 1999 for an anniversary event. She saw fellow classmates having similar struggles and almost immediately decided to go back to college to become a teacher. 


Martin, a co-founder of The Rebels Project, named after Columbine's mascot, said 25 years has given her time to struggle and figure out how to work out of those struggles. 


"I just know myself so well now and know how I respond to things and what might activate me and how I can bounce back and be OK. And most importantly I think I can recognize when I am not OK and when I do need to seek help," she said. 


Kiki Leyba, a first-year teacher at Columbine in 1999, was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder soon after the shooting. He felt a strong sense of commitment to return to the school, where he threw himself into his work. But he continued to have panic attacks. 


To help him cope, he had sleeping pills and some Xanax for anxiety, Leyba said. One therapist recommended chamomile tea. 


Things got harder for him after the 2002 graduation of Mendo's class, the last cohort of students who lived through the shooting since they had been through so much together. 


By 2005, after years of not taking care of himself and suffering from lack of sleep, Leyba said he would often check out from family life, sleeping in on the weekends and turning into a "blob on the couch." Finally, his wife Kallie enrolled him in a one-week trauma treatment program, arranging for him to take the time off from work without telling him. 


"Thankfully that really gave me a kind of a foothold ... to do the work to climb out of that," said Leyba, who said breathing exercises, journaling, meditation and anti-depressants have helped him. 


Like Mendo and Martin, he has traveled around the country to work with survivors of shootings. 


"That worst day has transformed into something I can offer to others," said Leyba, who is in Washington, D.C. this week meeting with officials about gun violence and promoting a new film about his trauma journey. 


Mendo still lives in the area, and her 5-year-old daughter attends school near Columbine. When her daughter's school locked down last year as police swarmed the neighborhood during a hostage situation, Mendo recalled worrying things like: What if my child is in danger? What if there is another school shooting like Columbine? 


When Mendo picked up her daughter, she seemed a little scared, and she hugged her mom a little tighter. Mendo breathed deeply to stay calm, a technique she had learned in therapy, and put on a brave face. 


"If I was putting down some fear, she would pick it up," she said. "I didn't want that for her."

The researchers from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research also said the losses will be six times more expensive than it would be to cut emissions and limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius. “Protecting our climate is much cheaper than not doing so,” said Leonie Wenz, who led the study. Lower-latitude areas and countries least responsible for man-made climate change will be hit the hardest, but everyone will be affected.

Temperatures soared above 113 degrees Fahrenheit in late March and early April, at one point reaching 119 degrees in Mali. At least 102 heat-related deaths were recorded in the first four days of April. The researchers analyzed weather data and climate models and concluded that such extremes wouldn’t have occurred without increased global temperatures from burning fossil fuels. “Events like these will become much more common, and even more dangerous, unless the world moves away from fossil fuels and countries rapidly reduce emissions to net zero,” the report said. “If global warming reaches 2°C, as is expected to occur in the 2040s or 2050s unless emissions are rapidly halted, similar events will occur 10 times more frequently.”

## Reflections on Baltimore’s bridge collapse from the workers who built it

date: 2024-04-18, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>When the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore was built in the &#8217;70s, it was a chance for workers to prove themselves on a massive construction project. Following its collapse, those workers look back on what many considered to be a monument to their work — and what happens when that monument is gone. Also: foreign aid could be bundled with a forced sale of TikTok, and European Union leaders agree to tighten sanctions on Iran.</p>

## COSMIC continues march towards alpha release

date: 2024-04-18, from: OS News

COSMIC, System76&#8217;s Rust-based desktop that&#8217;s going to replace GNOME in Pop!_OS, is nearing its alpha release, and the Linux OEM has published another blog post detailing the latest progress it&#8217;s made. First and foremost, theming support has been further refined by adding support for theming GTK applications (both GTK3 and 4) and flatpak applications. If the user has enabled global themes, these themes will be applied automatically whenever selecting a theme to apply. Support for custom icon packs has also been added. COSMIC now also has an application store, much like GNOME Software and KDE&#8217;s Discover, which also takes care of updating installed applications. You can now also drag windows from anywhere inside the window by holding down the super key, which is both a nice addition in general as well as a usability feature. The Settings application has also seen work, and gets a new keyboard settings panel, as well as various other smaller additions. COSMIC also now implements on-screen display toasts for things like changing volume and brightness, and plugging in power. System76 isn&#8217;t the only one working on COSMIC &#8211; community members have implemented things like window snapping, touchpad gestures, thumbnail previews in the dock, and more. The community is also working on things like an emoi picker, and a fan control graphical user interface. There&#8217;s a lot more in the blog post, so be sure to give it a read. I&#8217;m genuinely excited for COSMIC to hit the shelves, because I&#8217;m dying to try it out.

## Broadcom says “many” VMware perpetual licenses got support extensions

date: 2024-04-18, from: OS News

Broadcom CEO Hock Tan this week publicized some concessions aimed at helping customers and partners ease into VMware’s recent business model changes. Tan reiterated that the controversial changes, like the end of perpetual licensing, aren&#8217;t going away. But amid questioning from antitrust officials in the European Union (EU), Tan announced that the company has already given support extensions for some VMware perpetual license holders. ↫ Scharon Harding at Ars Technica I&#8217;m linking to the Ars Technica writeup here, because the original blog post from Broadcom&#8217;s CEO is effectively unreadable to me, as steeped in corpospeak as it is. The basic gist is that the storm of criticism that&#8217;s been hovering around Broadcom ever since the changes it announced to VMware&#8217;s licensing strategy isn&#8217;t going away, and even attracted the attention of the European Union. As such, Broadcom is giving existing perpetual VMware license holders some breathing room, but not much, and their plans will be executed as-is regardless. I doubt Broadcom and VMware are big and crucial enough for the full might of the EU to come down on them, so I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll see any sudden turnarounds like we did with Apple and Facebook, for instance, but at least some cracks are clearly starting to show. If the aforementioned storm keeps up, pressure from customers might actually force more concessions out of Broadcom.

## Security agencies warn election officials to brace for attacks on US presidential race

date: 2024-04-18, from: VOA News USA

washington — U.S. intelligence and security agencies are trying to prepare election officials for a wave of new attacks aiming to destroy voter confidence in November's presidential election, just as a series of reports warn some familiar adversaries are starting to ramp up their efforts.


The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), along with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) and the FBI, issued a new warning on Wednesday that "the usual suspects" — Russia, China and Iran — are looking for ways to stoke tensions and divide American voters.


All three countries, the guidance said, are "leveraging influence operations exploiting perceived sociopolitical divisions to undermine confidence in U.S. democratic institutions."


The new guidance warned that the three countries are using fake online accounts and various proxies, including state-sponsored media organizations, to spread disinformation and sow doubt.


It also cautioned that Russia, China and Iran are using real people, including social media influencers, "to wittingly or unwittingly promote their narratives."


"The elections process is the golden thread of American democracy, which is why our foreign adversaries deliberately target our elections infrastructure with their influence operations," CISA senior adviser Cait Conley said in a statement to reporters. "CISA is committed to doing its part to ensure these [state and local] officials — and the American public — don't have to fight this battle alone."


Agency warns of new tactics


The latest guidance, posted on CISA's website, warns that in addition to resorting to familiar tactics, Russia, China and Iran are likely to employ new tricks to try to  confuse U.S. voters and erode confidence in the election process.


One such technique is voice cloning — using a fake recording of a public official or figure to try to cause confusion. The agencies cited an example from last year's election in the Slovak Republic, when a fake recording of a key party leader purported to show him discussing how to rig the vote.


The guidance also warned that Iran could try to employ "hack and leak" cyberattacks in the U.S., using lessons learned from similar operations against Israel in recent months.


And it said Russia and China have separately sought to spark alarm among voters by spreading fake documents alleging to show evidence of security incidents impacting physical buildings or computer systems.


China denied the allegations.


"China has always adhered to noninterference in other countries' internal affairs," Liu Pengyu, the spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, said in an email to VOA.


"Speculating or accusing China of using social media to interfere in the U.S. politics is completely groundless and malicious," Liu added.


VOA also contacted representatives for the Russian and Iranian governments, who have yet to respond.




For now, CISA, ODNI and the FBI are advising U.S. election officials that they can try to mitigate the impact of election meddling attempts by creating trusted portals for information, such as official U.S. government websites, and by proactively debunking false information.


But the challenge is likely to grow.


Russia already interfering, says Microsoft


Tech giant Microsoft warned on Wednesday it is seeing signs that Russia, at least, is already ramping up its election interference efforts.


"The usual Russian election influence actors kicked into gear over the last 45 days," according to a report by Microsoft's Threat Analysis Center.


The Russian effort so far, the report said, "employs a mix of themes from 2020 with a renewed focus on undermining U.S. support for Ukraine."


Microsoft further warned that Russia, China and Iran have "leveraged some form of generative AI [artificial intelligence] to create content since last summer."


"We anticipate that election influence campaigns will include fakes — some will be deep, most shallow — and the simplest manipulations, not the most complex employment of AI, will likely be the pieces of content that have the most impact," the report added.


At the same time, there is concern about domestic extremists impacting the presidential election.


"There is a serious risk of extremist violence," the Council on Foreign Relations wrote in a report issued Wednesday.


"While the risk of far-right election-related violence is greater, the possibility of far-left extremist violence cannot be dismissed," it said, pointing to the possibility of attacks on pre-election political events or gatherings, on polling places during Election Day, and against election offices in the days following the election.


Such warnings are consistent with those issued by U.S. officials in recent months.


"Some DVEs [domestic violent extremists], particularly those motivated by conspiracy theories and anti-government or partisan grievances, may seek to disrupt electoral processes," the U.S. Department of Homeland Security warned in a threat assessment issued this past September.


"Violence or threats could be directed at government officials, voters, and elections‑related personnel and infrastructure, including polling places, ballot drop box locations, voter registration sites, campaign events, political party offices and vote-counting sites," it said.

## US prepared to 'take further steps' as it warns China against enabling Russia

date: 2024-04-18, from: VOA News USA

state department — The United States warned China on Wednesday against helping Russia in its war on Ukraine and said it is "prepared to take further steps as necessary." In Italy, foreign ministers from the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations gathered to reaffirm their support for Ukraine's defense.


"We believe that the PRC is supporting Russia's war effort and is doing so by helping ramp up its defense production," State Department principal deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel told reporters during a briefing in Washington.


"Specifically," he said, "the PRC is providing Russia with significant quantities of machine tools, microelectronics, optics, UAVs [unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones] and cruise missile technology, and nitrocellulose, which Russia uses to make propellants for weapons."


Patel said the United States believes these materials "are filling critical gaps in Russia's defense production cycle" and helping to revitalize Russia's defense industrial base.


"China's support is actively enabling Russia's war in Ukraine, and it poses a significant threat to European security," he added. "We've sanctioned relevant firms in the PRC and are prepared to take further steps as necessary."


Blinken, G7 leaders talk


In Capri, Italy, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is holding talks this week with foreign ministers from the other G7 countries — Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom — as well as representatives from the European Union. Topics include Ukraine support, the Middle East crisis, Haitian instability and global partnerships.


German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock on Wednesday said the G7 ministers would discuss how to get more air defense to Ukraine as Kyiv faces increasing pressure from Russia.


"We and our partners around the world must now be just as resolute in our defense against Russian terror from the air," Baerbock said in a statement.


Blinken will later visit China, where he is expected to bring up Washington's concerns about China's support for Russia's defense industrial base.




On the margins of the G7 meeting Wednesday, Blinken and Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani signed a memorandum of understanding to counter the manipulation of information by other countries.


Blinken said the two nations are collaborating on "all of the most critical issues," including aiding Ukraine in defending itself against Russian aggression, addressing challenges in the Middle East and sharing approaches to challenges posed by China.




Beijing rejected what Chinese officials described as Washington's "smear."


"China regulates the export of dual-use articles in accordance with laws and regulations. Relevant countries should not smear or attack the normal relations between China and Russia and should not harm the legitimate rights and interests of China and Chinese companies," Mao Ning, a spokeswoman for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said during a briefing.


China continues supporting Russia


After Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov's visit to Beijing last week, Chinese officials said China would "continue to support Russia in pursuing development and revitalization under the leadership of President Vladimir Putin."


They said the two nations "have committed themselves to lasting friendship" and a deepened comprehensive strategic partnership.


Russian missile kills at least 17


In Washington, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo met with Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal. The two discussed the U.S. Commerce Department's work with partners to coordinate export controls and restrict sales of advanced technologies to Russia.


Deputy U.S. Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo said G7 finance leaders have been working toward a plan to unlock the value of frozen Russian sovereign assets to aid Ukraine in the near term. But he noted the talks are still a work in progress.


In Ukraine, officials said earlier Wednesday that a Russian missile attack hit the northern city of Chernihiv, killing at least 17 people and injuring 61 others.


Denise Brown, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Ukraine, condemned the latest wave of strikes. She also emphasized that under international humanitarian law, civilians and hospitals must be protected.


In Chernihiv, aid workers provided on-the-ground support to those affected by the strikes, including psychosocial and legal assistance. Their efforts complement the work of first responders and rescue services.


Some information for this report came from Reuters.

## Arizona Republicans fend off Democrats’ attempts to repeal 1864 abortion ban

date: 2024-04-17, from: VOA News USA

phoenix, arizona — Democrats in the Arizona House of Representatives on Wednesday tried repeatedly to repeal an 1864 ban on abortion but failed to get the Republican support they needed against the Civil War-era measure poised to become state law again. 


In four votes, the chamber deadlocked 30-30 on a procedural motion that would have allowed a repeal bill to come to the floor, with one Republican joining the 29 Democrats. 


One more Republican vote was needed to enable a vote on repealing a law that was written when Arizona was not yet a state and women lacked the right to vote. 


Democratic leaders later told reporters they did not anticipate another vote on Wednesday but would try again in future sessions.  


"I will continue to call on the legislature to do its job and repeal this law," Democratic Governor Katie Hobbs said in a statement. "A law from 1864 written by 27 men cannot be allowed to govern the lives of millions of Arizona women." 


Before Hobbs could sign any repeal bill, it would need to pass both chambers of the state legislature.  


A similar repeal attempt is taking place in the state Senate, where Republicans hold a 16-14 edge. Two Senate Republicans joined the Democrats on Wednesday and voted to advance the bill, but it needs two more such readings before it can reach the Senate floor. 


Opposing abortion rights is seen as sacrosanct to many Republican voters, and crossing party lines on such a touchstone issue would be rare in highly partisan times. 


But repealing the 1864 law would still leave in place a law passed by Republicans in 2022 that bans abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy. And some Republicans have softened their hard-line stance on abortion, mindful of the same polling that has emboldened Democrats. 


Confident that public opinion is on their side in supporting abortion rights, Democrats have sought to elevate the issue since the U.S. Supreme Court rescinded the constitutional right to abortion in 2022 and Republican-led states went about setting new severe restrictions.  


With or without repealing the 1864 law, Arizona Democrats are also attempting to place a ballot measure before voters in November that would restore abortion rights. 


Democrats are hoping the ballot measure energizes their voters in a closely divided state that could swing toward either party, possibly determining the outcome of the U.S. presidential election, the balance of power in the U.S. Senate, and control of both houses of the state legislature.  


The old law was revived by a state Supreme Court ruling on April 9, and unless the legislature intervenes it could take effect within 60 days.  


It imposes a prison sentence of two to five years for anyone found guilty of inducing an abortion except for a doctor who deems it necessary to save the life of the mother. 


Arizona House Democrats sought to repeal the ban a week ago but were thwarted by the narrow Republican majority of 31-29. On Wednesday, Republican Representative Matt Gress joined the Democrats, but one more vote was needed. 


Democrat Stephanie Stahl Hamilton, sponsor of the repeal bill, said that Democrats would persist and that she was confident it would eventually receive a vote.

## Linus Torvalds really prefers tabs

date: 2024-04-17, from: OS News

Linus Torvalds really doesn&#8217;t like spaces &#8211; as in, tabs vs. spaces &#8211; and got a little annoyed that a commit removed a hidden tab because it &#8220;apparently showed breakage in some third-party kernel config parsing tool&#8221;. So, Torvalds decided to add some hidden tabs to trigger breakages like this, and is threatening to add more hidden tabs if necessary. It wasn&#8217;t clear what tool it was, but let&#8217;s make sure it gets fixed. Because if you can&#8217;t parse tabs as whitespace, you should not be parsing the kernel Kconfig files. In fact, let&#8217;s make such breakage more obvious than some esoteric ftrace record size option. If you can&#8217;t parse tabs, you can&#8217;t have page sizes. ↫ Linus Torvalds I&#8217;m not a programmer so I&#8217;m not going to wade into this debate &#8211; I have a personal Mastodon account to state it&#8217;s obviously tabs &#8211; but I did note that it seems like, at least in this commit message, Torvalds uses a double space after a period. Which is objectively the worst thing, right before Fahrenheit.

## American RFE/RL reporter marks 6 months jailed in Russia

date: 2024-04-17, from: VOA News USA

washington — An American journalist jailed in Russia will mark six months behind bars on Thursday over charges that press freedom groups have condemned as bogus and politically motivated.


Alsu Kurmasheva, an editor at the Tatar-Bashkir Service of VOA’s sister outlet Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, was arrested on October 18, 2023, and has been held in pretrial detention since then.


The dual U.S.-Russian national stands accused of failing to register as a “foreign agent” and spreading what Moscow views as false information about the Russian military.


Kurmasheva and her employer reject the charges against her, which carry a combined sentence of 15 years in prison.


U.S. Ambassador to Russia Lynne Tracy told VOA in an emailed statement that cases of all U.S. citizens detained in Russia have her full attention.


“Six months in, we remain deeply concerned by Alsu’s continued detention,” Tracy said. “We have been outspoken in condemning the Kremlin’s continued attempts to silence, intimidate and punish journalists, civil society voices and ordinary Russians who speak out against the Kremlin’s war in Ukraine.”


International press freedom groups have widely called for Kurmasheva’s immediate release.


“The six-month anniversary of Alsu’s detention is important because she shouldn’t have been jailed even for a single day. It’s an absolutely unjust, absurd case with fabricated charges,” said Gulnoza Said, Europe and Central Asia program coordinator at the Committee to Protect Journalists, or CPJ.


“Alsu should be freed from jail immediately and be able to travel back to Prague and see her family,” she told VOA from New York.


Russia’s embassy in Washington did not reply to VOA’s email requesting comment.


Emergency visit


Based in Prague, Kurmasheva traveled to Russia in May 2023 for a family emergency. Her passports were confiscated when she tried to leave the country in June, and she was waiting for them to be returned when she was arrested about four months later.


Earlier in April, Kurmasheva’s pretrial detention was again extended, this time until June.


“It’s not a legal process, it’s a political ploy, and Alsu and her family are unjustifiably paying a terrible price. Russia must end this sham and immediately release Alsu without condition,” RFE/RL President Stephen Capus said in a statement about the latest extension.


The Russian government labeled RFE/RL as an “undesirable organization” in February.




At her recent court hearing, Kurmasheva told reporters she was “not very well physically” and that she was receiving “minimal” medical care. The living conditions in the prison “are very bad,” she said, adding that a hole in the floor of her cell functions as the toilet.


That description has press freedom advocates concerned.


“The living conditions are quite bad, and we’re worried about the deterioration of her health,” said Jeanne Cavelier, the Paris-based head of the Eastern Europe and Central Asia desk at Reporters Without Borders, or RSF.


To date, the Russian government has denied the U.S. Embassy’s requests for consular access to Kurmasheva.


“We are deeply concerned about Alsu Kurmasheva’s detention in Russia,” a State Department spokesperson said in a statement. “The charges against Ms. Kurmasheva are another sign of the weakness of [Russian President Vladimir] Putin’s regime.”


RFE/RL’s parent organization, the U.S. Agency for Global Media, or USAGM, has also advocated for Kurmasheva’s immediate release.


“Alsu’s time in detention is unlike anything anyone could imagine,” USAGM CEO Amanda Bennett told VOA in an emailed statement. “Russia’s delaying and obfuscating shows this is purely a political stunt to advance the Kremlin’s agenda. She is being treated like a bargaining chip as opposed to a human being.”


First to be targeted


Kurmasheva is the first person to be targeted by Russia for not self-registering as a foreign agent, according to press freedom experts. Her arrest has had a chilling effect on other journalists in Russia who fear they could be targeted next.


“Russian laws, and Russian repressive legislation more specifically, is broad by nature. It’s conceptualized as something intentionally broad and vague,” said Karol Luczka, who leads the International Press Institute’s work on Eastern Europe. He cited Russia’s foreign agent law as an example.


“Most anyone these days in Russia can be considered a foreign agent because of any past activity. So, it’s very significant that they weaponize this legislation, because it shows that even when they have no real charges against anyone, they will always be able to find something,” said Luczka, who is based in Vienna.


For months, press freedom groups have called on the State Department to declare Kurmasheva wrongfully detained, which would open up additional resources to help secure her release.


Earlier this month, Roger Carstens, the U.S. special presidential envoy for hostage affairs, told VOA that U.S. officials were still deciding whether to declare Kurmasheva wrongfully detained.


"We’ve been looking at her case very closely. It’s not yet been decided that she’s wrongfully detained,” Carstens said. “But it’s something that we’re still sussing out.”


“The Department of State continuously reviews the circumstances surrounding the detentions of U.S. nationals overseas, including those in Russia, for indicators that they are wrongful,” a State Department spokesperson said in response to a detailed list of questions, in a statement identical to ones previously sent to VOA.


“When making assessments, the department conducts a legal, fact-based review that looks into the totality of the circumstances for each case individually,” the statement said.


Kurmasheva is one of two American journalists jailed in Russia. The second, The Wall Street Journal’s Evan Gershkovich, has been declared wrongfully detained by the State Department.


That determination came less than two weeks after Russian authorities arrested Gershkovich and accused him of espionage in late March 2023. Like Kurmasheva, the 32-year-old is still being held in pretrial detention.


Gershkovich, his employer and the U.S. government deny the charges against him. The reporter marked one year behind bars last month.




In November 2023, Washington made a prisoner swap offer to the Russian government to secure the release of Gershkovich and Paul Whelan, another U.S. citizen jailed in Russia and declared wrongfully detained. Moscow rejected that offer.


Carstens told reporters earlier this month that the U.S. government was putting together a new offer.


“We are working exceedingly hard and creatively to cobble together that offer,” he said.


Kurmasheva and Gershkovich count themselves among 22 journalists jailed in Russia, according to CPJ data from the end of 2023.


Russia ranks fourth in the world in terms of journalist jailings, but it has the most jailed foreign journalists. Of the 22 journalists imprisoned in Russia, 12 are foreign nationals. Beyond Kurmasheva and Gershkovich, Moscow has jailed 10 Ukrainian reporters, according to the CPJ.


Pressure stepped up


Tracy said Moscow’s repression has only intensified since the Russian army invaded Ukraine in February 2022.


“Authorities have shuttered dozens of outlets using fines and repressive legislation, censored thousands of websites and continue to persecute journalists,” she said. 


“This trend is deeply concerning, and the U.S. will continue to call for respect for Russians' fundamental freedoms — including freedom of speech — that are guaranteed in Russia’s own constitution.”


One of the main factors that unites the cases of Gershkovich and Kurmasheva is that trials won’t be what ultimately gets them free, according to Said.


“There is no way for their lawyers to prove their innocence through court, because courts are not independent in Russia. Political solutions and diplomatic solutions are the only way to get them free,” she said.


“That’s why it’s important that the U.S. uses all it has to put pressure on the Russian authorities and to get them free,” she said.

## LXQt 2.0.0 released, completes move to Qt 6

date: 2024-04-17, from: OS News

LXQt, the lightweight Qt desktop environment, has released a major new version, which brings with it a whole slew of very important changes and upgrades, with two main focal point. First and foremost, the desktop environment is now using Qt 6 across the board, meaning the transition from Qt 5 to Qt 6 is now complete. To support themes and the LXQt File Dialog for Qt5-based apps you can install libqtxdg-3.12.0, lxqt-qtplugin-1.4.1, and libfm-qt-1.4.0 alongside the new Qt 6 variants for backwards compatibility. One exception here is QTerminal, whose Qt 6 port ran into some issues, so a separate Qt 6 release will come later. The second major upgrade that&#8217;s still in progress is support for Wayland. LXQt 2.0.0 brings Wayland support for PCManFM-Qt, LXQt Runner, and LXQt Desktop Notifications, and for LXQt 2.1.0 they plan to make everything else available under Wayland as well. This means that more popular desktop environment like Cinnamon and Xfce are starting to feel a little out of step when it comes to Wayland. One of the major user-facing new features is a new default menu for the panel which supports favourites, a new and improved search feature, and more.

date: 2024-04-17, from: VOA News USA

Washington — China is bolstering its space capabilities and is using its civilian program to mask its military objectives, the head of the U.S. space agency said Wednesday, warning that Washington must remain vigilant.


"China has made extraordinary strides especially in the last 10 years, but they are very, very secretive," NASA administrator Bill Nelson told lawmakers on Capitol Hill.


"We believe that a lot of their so-called civilian space program is a military program. And I think, in effect, we are in a race," Nelson said.


He said he hoped Beijing would "come to its senses and understand that civilian space is for peaceful uses," but added: "We have not seen that demonstrated by China."


Nelson's comment came as he testified before the House Appropriations Committee on NASA's budget for fiscal 2025.


He said the United States should land on the moon again before China does, as both nations pursue lunar missions, but he expressed concern that were Beijing to arrive first, it could say: "'OK, this is our territory, you stay out.'"


The United States is planning to put astronauts back on the moon in 2026 with its Artemis 3 mission. China says it hopes to send humans to the moon by 2030.


Nelson said he was confident the United States would not lose its "global edge" in space exploration.


"But you got to be realistic," he said. "China has really thrown a lot of money at it and they've got a lot of room in their budget to grow. I think that we just better not let down our guard."

## US Senate dismisses articles of impeachment against homeland security secretary

date: 2024-04-17, from: VOA News USA

Washington — The Senate on Wednesday dismissed all impeachment charges against Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, ending the House Republican push to remove the Cabinet secretary from office over his handling of the U.S.-Mexico border.  


The two votes ended the trial before arguments began. Senators voted separately to dismiss the two articles of impeachment, arguing that they were unconstitutional. 


The votes were 51-48 and 51-49, both along party lines. 


The first article charged Mayorkas with “willful and systemic refusal to comply with the law." The second article charged Mayorkas with a "breach of trust" for saying the border was secure. The Senate then adjourned the impeachment trial. 


Republicans had argued for a full impeachment trial against Mayorkas. 


"For the sake of the Senate's integrity and to protect impeachment for those rare cases we truly need it, senators should dismiss today's charges," Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said as he opened Wednesday's session. 


The House narrowly voted in February to impeach Mayorkas for his handling of the border, arguing in the two articles that he "willfully and systematically" refused to enforce immigration laws. House impeachment managers delivered the charges to the Senate on Tuesday, standing in the well of the Senate and reading them aloud to a captive audience of senators.


The outright dismissal of House Republicans' prosecution of Mayorkas, with no chance to argue the case, was an embarrassing defeat for House Republicans and House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, who made the impeachment a priority. And it is likely to resonate politically for both Republicans and Democrats in a presidential election year when border security has been a top issue. 


Republicans argue that President Joe Biden has been weak on the border as arrests for illegal crossings skyrocketed to more than 2 million people during the past two years, though they have fallen from a record of 250,000 in December amid heightened enforcement in Mexico. Democrats say that instead of impeaching Mayorkas, Republicans should have accepted a bipartisan Senate compromise aimed at reducing the number of migrants who come into the U.S. illegally. 




Once the senators were sworn in on Wednesday, the chamber turned into the court of impeachment, with Democratic Senator Patty Murray of Washington presiding. Murray is the president pro tempore of the Senate, or the most senior member of the majority party who sits in for the vice president. Senators approached the front of the Senate in groups of four to sign an oath book that is stored in the National Archives. 


Schumer then called for the votes to dismiss the trial after Republicans rejected a proposed agreement for Senate debate time and several votes on GOP objections. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell called for a delay in the proceedings while Republican senators huddled on the floor to discuss how to proceed and called for several votes to delay the final outcome. All the votes were along party lines. 


While most Republicans opposed quick dismissal, some hinted they could vote with Democrats. 


Mayorkas, who was in New York on Wednesday to launch a campaign for children's online safety, reiterated that he's focused on the work of his department. 




"The Senate is going to do what the Senate considers to be appropriate as that proceeds," he said. "I am here in New York City on Wednesday morning fighting online sexual exploitation and abuse. I'm focused on our mission." 


The two articles argued that Mayorkas not only refused to enforce existing law but also breached the public trust by lying to Congress and saying the border was secure. The House vote was the first time in nearly 150 years that a Cabinet secretary had been impeached.

## Microsoft finds Russian influence operations targeting US election have begun

date: 2024-04-17, from: VOA News USA

SAN FRANCISCO — Microsoft said on Wednesday that Russian online campaigns to influence the upcoming U.S. presidential election kicked into gear over the past 45 days, but at a slower pace than in past elections. 


Russia-linked accounts are disseminating divisive content aimed at U.S. audiences, including criticizing American support of Ukraine in its war with Russia, researchers at the tech giant said in a report. 


The Russian embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment, but the Kremlin said last month it would not meddle in the November U.S. election. It also dismissed U.S. allegations that it orchestrated campaigns to sway the 2016 and 2020 U.S. presidential elections. 


While the Russian activity Microsoft observed is not as intense as around the previous elections, it could increase in the coming months, the researchers said.  


"Messaging regarding Ukraine — via traditional media and social media — picked up steam over the last two months with a mix of covert and overt campaigns from at least 70 Russia-affiliated activity sets we track," Microsoft said. 


The most prolific of such Russian campaigns is linked to Russia's Presidential Administration, they added. Another one is aimed at posting disinformation online in various languages, with posts typically starting with an apparent whistleblower or citizen journalist posting content on a video channel. That content is then covered by a network of websites that include DC Weekly, Miami Chronical and The Intel Drop. 


"Ultimately, after the narrative has circulated online for a series of days or weeks, U.S. audiences repeat and repost this disinformation, likely unaware of its original source," Microsoft said. 


A "notable uptick" has been seen in hacking by a Russian group Microsoft calls Star Blizzard, or Cold River, which is focused on targeting western think tanks, the company said. 


"Star Blizzard's current focus on U.S. political figures and policy circles may be the first in a series of hacking campaigns meant to drive Kremlin outcomes headed into November." 


Malicious use of artificial intelligence by foreign rivals targeting the U.S. election is a key concern cited by American political observers, but Microsoft said it found that simpler digital forgeries were more common than deepfakes. Audio manipulations have a bigger impact than video, it added. 


"Rarely have nation-states' employments of generative AI-enabled content achieved much reach across social media, and in only a few cases have we seen any genuine audience deception from such content," the researchers said.  


"The simplest manipulations, not the most complex employment of AI, will likely be the pieces of content that have the most impact."

## We Can’t Drill These Holes Fast Enough

The Bureau of Land Management approves leasing for geothermal projects on some <a href="https://www.blm.gov/programs/energy-and-minerals/renewable-energy/geothermal-energy" target="_blank"><u>245 million acres of land</u></a>. This also means that geothermal projects often have to run the <a href="https://ifp.org/hot-rocks-part-three-barriers-to-next-gen-geothermal/" target="_blank"><u>full gamut of federal environmental review</u></a> at each stage of development. Over the decade or so that a geothermal project can take from start to finish, there may be as many six reviews mandated by the National Environmental Policy Act, according to the Institute for Progress, a technology policy think tank.</p><p>This week, the BLM alleviated part of that burden, saying Monday that it would apply two existing “categorical exclusions” – i.e. permissions to skip environmental review for certain actions — to geothermal exploration projects. This authority to adopt other agencies’ categorical exclusions (in this case from the Forest Service and the Navy) <a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/fiscal-responsibility-act-permit-reform/" target="_blank"><u>was included in the 2022 debt limit deal</u></a>.</p><p>And yet, all the industry advocates I talked to expressed measured enthusiasm at best. “I think this is a very good step in the right direction,” Aidan Mackenzie, a fellow at the Institute for Progress, told me. On top of saving companies time, it also saves the government time. Creating a new categorical exclusion “requires notice and comment, which is more challenging for an agency,” Mackenzie said. “Adopting an existing categorical exclusion is a much easier process.”</p><p>This move comes as a bipartisan effort to clear away bureaucratic barriers for geothermal companies to operate on public lands appears to be cresting in Congress. Last month, four senators — two Democrats and two Republicans — <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/geothermal-energy-bill-new-mexico" target="_self"><u>co-sponsored a bill</u></a>, the Geothermal Energy Optimization Act that would establish a categorical exclusion for <em>all</em> exploration activities, modeled on the existing one for oil and gas that’s been in place since 2005.</p><p>Two prominent geothermal startups, Eavor and Fervo, both welcomed the BLM’s decision while pushing gently but insistently for the full legislative solution.<br/></p><p>Jeanine Vany, Eavor’s executive vice president of corporate affairs, told me the BLM’s action would “move the needle slightly in the right direction,” but that a legislative solution — specifically the GEO Act — would be “much more comprehensive and would be longer lasting.”<br/><br/>In an emailed statement, Fervo CEO Tim Latimer said essentially the same thing, calling the BLM's move “a commonsense approach to enabling development.” </p><p>“While the actions here cover only a small portion of activities in the geophysical exploration process,” he wrote, ”we are optimistic that both agency and legislative updates in the future that encompass some routine development and drilling activities will continue to unlock the potential of this important 24/7 carbon-free energy resource.”</p><p>One of the authors of the GEO Act, New Mexico Senator Martin Heinrich, also emailed to say that “BLM is right to scale up geothermal production,” but that now, “Congress should pass my GEO Act to take us a step further in fully harnessing the power of geothermal.”</p><p>At the same time, the BLM is working to carve out its own exclusions specific to the work it does on geothermal permitting. A BLM spokesperson told me the agency is “currently working on two categorical exclusions related to geothermal permitting,” one for exploration and another for “resource confirmation,” the process of drilling to show <a href="https://www.energy.senate.gov/services/files/9E245C4D-2082-48E6-9AB2-934362585FC0" target="_blank">more definitively</a> that the necessary hot rocks or (hot fluids) are there and can be drilled for heat.</p><p><span></span>Still, “there’s a strong case for Congress, especially, to do more,” Mackenzie said. The GEO Act, he explained, would “derisk” the exploration process for geothermal. “Right now, there’s a big cost to messing it up," he said. "If you have to do a full [Environmental Assessment], it takes or year or two — you might get sued. If you finally do the exploration and the resource isn’t what you think it would be, you have to go back and wait years to try again.”</p><p>Shortening the timeline for geothermal will be key to achieving what the industry, energy buyers, and the federal government all seem to want for next-generation projects, in terms of both cost and production. The Department of Energy has said that it wants to see <a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-launches-new-energy-earthshot-slash-cost-geothermal-power" target="_blank">costs fall by some 90%</a> by the middle of the next decade, and that the sector could grow 20-fold by 2050, to <a href="https://liftoff.energy.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/LIFTOFF_DOE_NextGen_Geothermal_v14.pdf" target="_blank">90 gigawatts of capacity</a>, which would be slightly greater than the capacity of hydropower today. </p>

Well, it turns out that Microsoft installed this application alongside an update to the Edge browser &#8211; but the company claims this is in error, and the application will be removed in a future update. Updates to Edge browser version 123.0.2420.65, released on March 28, 2024 and later, might incorrectly install a new package (MSIX) called ‘Microsoft chat provider for Copilot in Windows’ on Windows devices. Resulting from this, the Microsoft Copilot app might appear in the Installed apps in Settings menu. It is important to note that the Microsoft chat provider for Copilot in Windows does not execute any code or process, and does not acquire, analyze, or transmit device or environment data in any capacity. ↫ Windows 11 known issues and notifications The company claims this was an enablement package to prepare some Windows devices for the arrival of Copilot, and that it was unintentionally installed on devices. While it doesn&#8217;t mean Copilot was actually installed on your PC or server, it&#8217;s still a chilling reminder of who really controls your PC or server.

## New effort tackles drug overdose epidemic in US

date: 2024-04-17, from: VOA News USA

The Biden Administration has launched a new effort to tackle the drug overdose epidemic in the United States, which in 2022 took more than 100,000 lives, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But as VOA’s Veronica Balderas Iglesias reports, some critics say there are some gaps in the government’s strategy to save lives.

## Framework lays out plan to improve its firmware and software development cycle

date: 2024-04-17, from: OS News

Only two days ago we were talking about the software and firmware issues at Framework, and today the company&#8217;s CEO has announced they&#8217;re taking some pretty big steps to address these problems. When building products to last, it’s not enough to design the hardware to be repairable, upgradeable, and customizable.&#160;The overall longevity of devices as complex as modern notebooks also depends on how long the software and firmware continues to be useful. That includes compatibility updates to support newer generations hardware modules, fixes for bugs or compatibility issues found by end users, and especially patches for security vulnerabilities.&#160;We recognize that we have fallen short of where we need to be on software updates, and we are making the needed investments to resolve this. We now have a dedicated team of engineers at our manufacturing partner and a set of internal stakeholders focused on ongoing software updates for all of our products, going back to our original Framework Laptop with 11th Gen Intel Core. In the past, we were reliant on ad-hoc availability of engineering time from our suppliers (basically borrowing staffing from whichever new product development we had ongoing). This was inconsistent and resulted in slow progress. With a dedicated team, there is no longer resource contention, and we are able deliver shorter turnaround times from discovering issues to resolving them. ↫ Nirav Patel They&#8217;ve also shared exactly how the development, testing, and release process new firmware releases will work, from identifying any issues to the final release to consumers, and they&#8217;re hiring new employees focused entirely on expediting this process. They also promise to support each device for as long as their upstream silicon vendors will, but they can&#8217;t give any guarantees on how long that will be since those upstream vendors aren&#8217;t sharing details like that. All in all, I think this is about as good a response as you can get from an OEM, but as they themselves note, they&#8217;ll have to show their customers these aren&#8217;t just mere words. Assuming it pans out the way Framework is promising here, I think it&#8217;s a fair and customer-friendly process.

## US bars 4 former Malawi officials over corruption, State Department says

date: 2024-04-17, from: VOA News USA

Washington — The United States has barred four former officials of the Malawi government from entry because of their involvement in significant corruption, the State Department said on Wednesday.


The officials designated are former solicitor general and secretary of justice Reyneck Matemba, former director of public procurement and disposal of assets John Suzi-Banda, former Malawi Police Service attorney Mwabi Kaluba, and former Inspector General of the Malawi Police Service George Kainja, the department said.


The four were cited by the State Department as having "abused their public positions by accepting bribes and other articles of value" from a private business person in exchange for a government police contract.


"The United States stands with Malawians working towards a more just and prosperous nation by promoting accountability for corrupt officials, including advocating for transparency and integrity in government procurement processes," department spokesman Matthew Miller said in a statement.


Matemba expressed surprise when contacted by Reuters.


"I am still in Malawi and have never traveled outside the country since 2021. I am on bail, therefore I can't travel because my passport is technically with the police," Matemba said.


Malawi President Lazarus Chakwera has waged a crackdown on corruption in recent years. In January 2022, he dissolved the country's entire Cabinet on charges of corruption against three serving ministers.




Later that year, Malawi's Anti-Corruption Bureau arrested and charged the country's vice president, Saulos Klaus Chilima, over graft allegations.


The group has been investigating public officers in Malawi over alleged plundering of state resources by influencing awarding of contracts through the country's public procurement system.


Malawi is one of the world's poorest countries, with nearly three-quarters of the population living on less than $2 a day. Though small in size, it features in the top 10 in Africa in terms of population density.

## NPR suspends editor who criticized employer for what he calls an unquestioned liberal worldview

date: 2024-04-17, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — National Public Radio has suspended a veteran editor who wrote an outside essay criticizing his employer for, in his view, journalism that reflects a liberal viewpoint with little tolerance for contrary opinions.


Uri Berliner, a senior editor on NPR's business desk, was suspended five days without pay, according to an article posted Tuesday by NPR's media correspondent, David Folkenflik. He wrote that Berliner was told he violated the company's policy that it must approve work done for outside news organizations.


Berliner told NPR that he was not appealing the suspension. An NPR spokeswoman said the company would not comment on individual personnel matters.


He wrote his essay last week for The Free Press. Berliner wrote that NPR has always had a liberal bent, but for most of his 25-year tenure had an open-minded, curious culture.


"In recent years, however, that has changed," he wrote. "Today, those who listen to NPR or read its coverage online find something different: the distilled worldview of a very small segment of the U.S. population."


His commentary became an instant hit with outside conservative activists who have made similar criticisms of NPR. He specifically criticized his employer for its coverage of former President Donald Trump, of accusations against the president's son, Hunter Biden, and of the COVID-19 pandemic.


Following publication, NPR's top editor, Edith Chapin, said she strongly disagrees with Berliner's conclusions and is proud to stand behind NPR's work.


One of his NPR colleagues, "Morning Edition" co-host Steve Inskeep, wrote on Substack Tuesday that Berliner's essay in The Free Press was filled with errors and assumptions.


"If Uri's 'larger point' is that journalists should seek wider perspectives, and not just write stories that confirm their prior opinions, his article is useful as an example of what to avoid," Inskeep wrote.

## Editor who criticized NPR resigns after being suspended

date: 2024-04-17, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — A National Public Radio editor who wrote an essay criticizing his employer for promoting liberal views resigned on Wednesday, attacking NPR's new chief executive on the way out. 


Uri Berliner, a senior editor on NPR's business desk, posted his resignation letter on X, formerly Twitter, a day after it was revealed that he had been suspended for five days for violating company rules about outside work done without permission. 


"I cannot work in a newsroom where I am disparaged by a new CEO whose divisive views confirm the very problems" written about in his essay, Berliner said in his resignation letter. 


Katherine Maher, a former tech executive appointed in January as NPR's chief executive, has been criticized by conservative activists for social media messages that disparaged former President Donald Trump. The messages predated her hiring at NPR. 


NPR's public relations chief said the organization does not comment on individual personnel matters. 


The suspension and subsequent resignation highlight the delicate balance that many U.S. news organizations and their editorial employees face. On one hand, as journalists striving to produce unbiased news, they're not supposed to comment on contentious public issues; on the other, many journalists consider it their duty to critique their own organizations' approaches to journalism when needed. 


In his essay, written for the online Free Press site, Berliner said NPR is dominated by liberals and no longer has an open-minded spirit. He traced the change to coverage of Trump's presidency. 


"There's an unspoken consensus about the stories we should pursue and how they should be framed," he wrote. "It's frictionless — one story after another about instances of supposed racism, transphobia, signs of the climate apocalypse, Israel doing something bad and the dire threat of Republican policies. It's almost like an assembly line." 


He said he'd brought up his concerns internally and no changes had been made, making him "a visible wrong-thinker at a place I love." 


In the essay's wake, NPR top editorial executive, Edith Chapin, said leadership strongly disagreed with Berliner's assessment of the outlet's journalism and the way it went about its work. 


It's not clear what Berliner was referring to when he talked about disparagement by Maher. In a lengthy memo to staff members last week, she wrote: "Asking a question about whether we're living up to our mission should always be fair game: after all, journalism is nothing if not hard questions. Questioning whether our people are serving their mission with integrity, based on little more than the recognition of their identity, is profoundly disrespectful, hurtful and demeaning." 


Conservative activist Christopher Rufo revealed some of Maher's past tweets after the essay was published. In one tweet, dated January 2018, Maher wrote that "Donald Trump is a racist." A post just before the 2020 election pictured her in a Biden campaign hat. 


In response, an NPR spokeswoman said Maher, years before she joined the radio network, was exercising her right to express herself. She is not involved in editorial decisions at NPR, the network said. 


Maher is the former head of the Wikimedia Foundation. NPR's own story about the 40-year-old executive's appointment in January noted that she "has never worked directly in journalism or at a news organization." 


In his resignation letter, Berliner said that he did not support any efforts to strip NPR of public funding. "I respect the integrity of my colleagues and wish for NPR to thrive and do important journalism," he wrote.

## Biden to triple tariffs on Chinese steel ahead of reelection bid

date: 2024-04-17, from: VOA News USA

Washington — In response to mounting pressure from labor unions anxious about the impact of cheap Chinese exports on the U.S steel industry, President Joe Biden is poised to triple tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from China. 


“They're not competing. They're cheating,” Biden said Wednesday in remarks to the United Steelworkers union in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. “They're cheating. And we've seen the damage here in America.” 


Pennsylvania is one of a few battleground states that could determine the success of the president’s reelection bid against former President Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee. 


“Under my predecessor, who's busy right now, Pennsylvania lost 275,000 jobs,” Biden said in a jab at Trump, who is on trial in New York on charges of falsifying business accounts to disguise hush money payments related to his 2016 election campaign. 


Biden boasted of creating 800,000 new manufacturing jobs since taking office, including 28,000 in Pennsylvania. 




He accused Beijing of “heavily” subsidizing Chinese steel companies that dump their products on the global markets at “unfairly low” prices. China is responsible for almost half of global steel production. 


The tariff hike proposal by Biden, who calls himself the “most pro-union president in American history,” echoed Trump’s “America First” trade approach against China.  


In 2018, the former president announced a 25% tariff on some imported steel products and a 10 percent tariff on some imported aluminum products, under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act. 


However, Trump’s action did not increase tariffs for some other steel and aluminum products, which are currently levied at a much lower 7.5% rate. Biden is directing U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai to explore tripling the tariff rate on those products under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, the White House said in a statement. 


Rachel Ziemba, an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, or CNAS, said the Biden administration is reviewing why some Chinese steel derivatives currently have a 25% tariff and some have a 7.5% tariff. 


“Arguably, what they're proposing to do now might normalize the level of steel tariffs across almost all sorts of steel products that are coming in from China,” she told VOA. 


In a statement to VOA, the Trump campaign dismissed Biden’s proposal. 


“The Biden campaign is attacking President Trump's effective tariffs on China – while the Biden White House is planning to implement similar tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum,” said Trump’s national press secretary, Karoline Leavitt. “Biden's team is either run by hypocrites or people who don't know what they're doing.”


Protectionist sentiment 


The proposed tariffs reflect the resurging protectionist sentiment now embraced by politicians on both sides of the aisle. 


“Rather astonishingly, trade tariffs have entered the political mainstream,” said William Howell, Sydney Stein professor in American politics at the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy.  


“After decades of bipartisan agreement on the benefits of open international markets, Republican and Democratic presidents now are looking for ways to protect select domestic industries from international competition,” he told VOA. 




The shift, Howell added, involves a rethinking of the costs and benefits of free trade as well as political considerations of the two presidential candidates as they try to shore up union support in key battleground states. 


The White House denies political motivation. A senior administration official said the move is not aimed at courting union workers, a powerful voting bloc. 


“It has nothing to do with elections,” the official told reporters during Wednesday’s briefing. “We're actually acting from a place of self-confidence and strength because our economy is growing and manufacturing is rebounding.” 


China was the seventh-largest exporter of steel to the United States in 2023 with 598,000 net tons total shipments of all steel products, according to Census Bureau data compiled by the American Iron and Steel Institute, an industry trade group that welcomed Biden’s proposal. 


The economic effect of tripling the tariffs against such small volumes of Chinese steel and aluminum imports will be minor, said Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. 


“But the announcement may shift some votes,” he told VOA. 


While Biden has signaled that the Section 301 review is a high priority, the timeline of his proposed tariff increase, and its potential impact, are not clear. 


“There are a lot of details to come out that won't be clear until the final rule and judgment is revealed,” Ziemba of CNAS said. 


Working with Mexico 


Since Section 232 is related to national security rather than dumping or import surges, exemptions were allowed on certain derivatives of aluminum and steel from partner countries beginning in 2020. 


Full or partial exemptions apply to steel derivatives from Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan, the European Union, Mexico, South Korea and the United Kingdom. The same applies to aluminum derivatives from Argentina, Australia, Canada, the EU, Mexico and the U.K. 


Biden said he recently sent a delegation to meet with Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, to ensure that Chinese companies can’t circumvent the tariffs by shipping steel there for subsequent export to the U.S.  


“Mexico and the United States are going to work together to solve this, I promise you,” he said. 


He said his administration will unveil a probe into “unfair practices” in the Chinese shipbuilding industry, following a petition from United Steelworkers and four other unions. 


In a statement to VOA, Chinese Embassy Spokesperson Liu Pengyu said U.S. tariffs against China are “the embodiment of unilateralism and protectionism.” He pointed out that in 2020, the World Trade Organization ruled that Trump-era tariffs imposed on China in 2018 breached international trade rules. 


“The U.S. is making the same mistake again and again by seeking to triple the tariff rate on Chinese steel and aluminum products and launching Section 301 investigations targeting China's maritime, logistics and shipbuilding sectors,” he said. 


Liu added his government hopes the administration will “implement the important consensus and spirit” agreed by Biden and President Xi Jinping during their 2023 meeting in San Francisco and cancel tariffs through the Section 301 review. 


Asked Wednesday if he was concerned his tariff hike plans would impact relations with Xi, Biden said, "No," without elaborating. 


Increasingly, steel has become an election issue particularly in the so-called “Rust Belt,” the country’s manufacturing, steelmaking, and coal-producing heartland that went through industrial decline, resulting in high unemployment. 


During a visit earlier this month by Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, a staunch U.S. ally, Biden repeated his opposition to the proposed acquisition of U.S. Steel by Japanese group Nippon Steel.  


"U.S. Steel has been an iconic American company for more than a century. And it should remain totally American,” Biden underscored Wednesday. 


The USW endorsed Biden for reelection in March, shortly after he announced his opposition to the takeover deal. 


Trump has also pledged that he would block the $14.9 billion offer for U.S. Steel.

	Climeworks, the Swiss startup that became the first company to launch a commercial-scale facility that sucks carbon out of the air and buries it deep underground, is getting into carbon trading with the launch of an offshoot called Climeworks Solutions, <a href="https://d2qwfv04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/X+113/d2QWfV04/VWgxG_5t1hZHW4BYJkF3JZPcqW1RGk9h5c_MhMN8GDX783qn9gW8wLKSR6lZ3lmN59wvY6TdlKjVymysl1X-3FyW4ly7fV6VWH-cVnVJm258_NNqW2YWN9G2y7hnMW8jKtRL6NkD1fW9h7NY82qT4BZW2ZDpzD5GFmnkN5WmdP6yJtg1W7-0MtB2l_Y74W8HfZb295P5rdW45LlYS8LR8HVW2XC9FW3CKsH3W7Vvn-J1ZSSQjW3Mq_461HHY_KW8DgT4h88GXTbW8ZhMBJ6R71R0W4nWL6v8ksfsVN6tLsqGRzvkNW1xv8VP6vwrqNN91sg-Pd8P9LN66ZSTZrcmvBW3gxYY82j4mSdW6Hr6-Q12D303W7XQlJF3xq-HlW3z6sfs8NHnknW7cTqgm7xLrfvW2BG5Vl2z86jYf5dBn3604" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported Heatmap’s Emily Pontecorvo</a>. Under the new banner, Climeworks will purchase carbon removal credits from other providers, package them into portfolios that include its own direct air capture credits, and sell the bundles to buyers looking for “high quality” carbon removal. Adrian Siegrist, the company’s vice president of climate solutions, said the credits will have “the stamp of Climeworks quality.”
</p><p>
	There are already more than half a dozen companies promising to source only the highest quality carbon removal credits for buyers, and Climeworks is relying on its name as a trusted brand to set itself apart. Siegrist said Climeworks is already in talks with more than 50 other companies interested in working with them. “But it’s unclear where all of this carbon removal is going to come from,” Pontecorvo <a href="https://d2qwfv04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/X+113/d2QWfV04/VWgxG_5t1hZHW4BYJkF3JZPcqW1RGk9h5c_MhMN8GDX783qn9gW8wLKSR6lZ3p5W8bKsNx41fRjqN26cTms-Wdc3W6Yrw4B4pbQrLF6vhKln6g9TW5KwnMq3SFSn1W29-Dhp63tVKwN2pWBs0lxw85W2NpvgB4twbq5W7tk5cW2GzdZmW91mjXK7bSk0xW8dtN0P17l7QBW52YYY01lsgF7W8T4CXj7LmHzRW3ycvxj4Dxx28F8j0nH_htKhW7_vRKs2sLdCHW4hCSgF5BXgQSW1DVDBL87lXNNN40q-MbmQ8BfW2JFtrh1b6kt2W4NB88B74ZN8pW3fNlQJ2s3tksW241zQ55pVGYJVnYSYp9jkVnJW7cnqzV1zMdsNW3zGtN675NWzKW2vNx044PMS3xW4klvW43KyXbzf5qPTNY04" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a>. “The company’s direct air capture credits are already sold out through 2027.”

Speaking at the Columbia Global Energy Summit in New York, White House climate adviser John Podesta said the lack of widespread standards for tracking embodied emissions from traded goods – aka the emissions that come from their production – has led to a global “race to the bottom” to set up supply chains in countries with low emissions standards. “If the global trade of goods was its own country, it would be the second-largest carbon polluter in the world after [China],” Podesta said. The new task force will focus on developing a policy toolkit on climate and trade, measuring emissions to help inform and enforce climate-smart trade policies, and supporting producers to clean up their manufacturing processes.

## Bike crash 2023 anniversary

(Not really update 22.)<br /><br />Huh. Missed the anniversary of the latest bike crash – it was on Monday. <br /><br />Today, the ever-helpful Google showed me a selfie I took from my hospital bed a year ago. (Thanks *so* much for the reminder, Googs.)<br /><br />So, a year ago today I had more or less got some kind of alertness back and was hoping to get transferred over to Liverpool for my arm to be reassembled. Little did I know it would take another 4 days, because they were hoping to put me in an ordinary airline seat...<br /><br /><img src="https://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=lproven&ditemid=309377" width="30" height="12" alt="comment count unavailable" style="vertical-align: middle;"/> comments

## Climeworks Is Becoming a Carbon Trader

date: 2024-04-17, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjAxODM2MC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcyMDY0MTY2M30.yCtKo9ANhGZCBn-vIF7CkTPzt9JYkF7t5qtjVJfxpUM/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">Climeworks made a name for itself as the first company to launch a commercial-scale facility that sucks carbon out of the air and buries it deep underground. The Swiss startup is widely recognized as a global leader in direct air capture technology.</p><p>But on Wednesday, Climeworks made a surprising move away from hard tech and into carbon trading with the launch of an offshoot called Climeworks Solutions. Under the new banner, it will purchase carbon removal credits from other providers, package them into portfolios that include its own direct air capture credits, and sell the bundles to buyers looking for “high quality” carbon removal.</p><p>The credits will have “the stamp of Climeworks quality,” Adrian Siegrist, the company’s vice president of climate solutions, told reporters this week. “It is a very, very selective vetting process.”</p><p>Corporate demand for carbon removal is growing. In the past, companies primarily bought a different kind of carbon credit to support their sustainability strategies. These credits came from projects that prevented emissions by protecting forests or distributing cleaner cookstoves, and they were cheap. But they came under fire after countless investigations into the projects turned up flimsy methodologies and inflated claims. </p><p>Meanwhile, there’s been a growing consensus in the world of corporate sustainability that even if these credits were based on real emission reductions, they shouldn’t be part of a net-zero strategy. For example, the Science Based Targets Initiative, the leading arbiter of corporate net-zero plans, only allows companies to apply carbon removal credits — and not conventional carbon avoidance credits — toward their goals. The only way to zero-out the climate impact of putting carbon in the atmosphere, SBTI says, is to take out an equal amount. </p><p>These two factors, along with a view that supporting the nascent carbon removal industry is the “right thing to do,” have fueled a <a href="https://www.cdr.fyi/blog/2023-year-in-review" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>carbon removal credit market</u></a> that grew from at least 105,000 tons sold to 50 buyers in 2021 to more than 4 million tons sold to nearly 200 buyers last year.</p><p>Siegrist said Climeworks Solutions is responding to a gap in the market. Companies face barriers to purchasing carbon removal, he said. They don’t want to put their reputations at risk and buy dubious credits, but they lack the time and expertise to do careful sourcing. They also want to sign simple one-and-done contracts, but they don’t want to purchase credits from a single supplier — especially not just from Climeworks, which sells top-shelf credits for upwards of $600 per ton.</p><p>“Companies asked us, in your opinion, can you tell us what is the best in X and the best in Y?” he said. “That made us realize there's a real need for clarity and for guidance.”</p><p>But Climeworks is entering a crowded field. There are already more than half a dozen companies — Patch, Supercritical, Ceezer, Carbon Direct, Watershed, Cur8, Lune — promising to source only the highest quality carbon removal credits for buyers. Each one has a slightly different model, with some acting more as an open marketplace, others more as a brokerage.</p><p>Climeworks is relying on its name as a trusted brand to set itself apart. But part of the reason it is a trusted brand is that it has focused on direct air capture — the form of carbon removal that is the most permanent and easy to measure and verify. Now the company will be venturing into the thornier science of other approaches like tree planting schemes and bioenergy with carbon capture. It also plans to source credits from biochar projects, which involve turning plants into a carbon-rich, durable, form of charcoal, and enhanced rock weathering, which speeds up the natural ability of rocks to absorb carbon from the environment.</p><p>“If you're saying that companies can come to you and use that trusted brand, what are the standards?” Erin Burns, the executive director of the carbon removal advocacy group Carbon 180, told me she wanted to know. “High quality doesn't mean anything. How transparent are they going to be about what those standards are?”</p><p>I asked Siegrist about how Climeworks defines high quality, especially when it comes to nature-based solutions like reforestation, and he said there were “various elements” that signaled quality, such as the use of remote sensing technologies that can more accurately track forest growth. He said they would publish their standards at some point in the future.</p><p>But he did share some general principles the company would use to tailor its portfolios for buyers: Fossil fuel emissions should be neutralized with carbon removed and stored for thousands of years, on par with how long carbon stays in the atmosphere. Meanwhile, a company’s emissions from land use could be offset using nature-based approaches that are still effective but inherently less enduring.</p><p>Climeworks Solutions’ first customer is Breitling, the Swiss luxury watchmaker, which signed a 12-year contract. It is purchasing a mix of direct air capture credits, to offset emissions from fossil fuel combustion in its factories, and enhanced rock weathering credits, to address emissions in its mineral supply chains. Breitling’s global director of sustainability Aurelia Figueroa said that focusing on high-cost direct air capture credits to compensate for direct emissions created an incentive to prioritize reducing emissions, summing up the strategy as “we do our best and remove the rest.” </p><p>Siegrist said Climeworks was already in talks with more than 50 other companies interested in working with them. But it’s unclear where all of this carbon removal is going to come from. The company’s direct air capture credits are already sold out through 2027. </p><p>“There's not a lot of high quality CDR happening, and in general, people are buying carbon removal years out,” said Burns. “Depending on how many tons they're being asked to put together for other companies to purchase, they're gonna run up against limits pretty quickly if they've got really high standards.”</p><p>Siegrist declined to name any companies or projects that Climeworks was sourcing carbon credits from. But in terms of supply, he said it was a chicken and egg scenario — that the only way to increase supply was to bring in more demand, and that the bigger constraint was limited buyer bandwidth. </p><p>I reached out to a carbon removal company called Charm Industrial to ask how developers feel about the rise of all of these brokerage services. Like Climeworks, Charm is another startup that scrupulous corporate buyers with big science teams, like Microsoft and Shopify, have deemed “high quality.” Charm’s head of sales, Harris Cohn, said the fees these services charge matter and vary widely. “There's a risk these services make the market worse if they make transactions harder or feel more expensive to buyers,” he said. But he noted that they have, indeed, already accelerated demand.</p><p>Peter Reinhardt, the CEO of Charm, agreed that there was no downside to having more players in the game. “We’ll break the supply constraint fairly soon :)” he added in an email. </p>

## The U.S. Has a Tesla Problem

date: 2024-04-17, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjAwMzQ0MC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcxNjc4MTk3OX0.kRwO9pwTV76X5sHfSLC-qpq0p6-4LuLNI-G9TSTK1vQ/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">
	It isn’t just bad vibes: Electric vehicle sales are slumping in the United States. Fewer than 300,000 EVs were sold nationwide during the first three months of 2024 — although it could be more than 350,000, depending on how you count and whose data you trust. That’s a slight decline from last quarter at a time when EV sales need to be accelerating.
</p><p>
	What caused the slump, and what can be done about it? And could hybrids or plug-in hybrids help solve the problem? In this week’s episode, Rob and Jesse chat with Corey Cantor, an EV analyst at BloombergNEF. They talk about Tesla’s spiraling problems, whether Detroit can pull its EV strategy together, and whether plug-in hybrids can co-exist with a climate strategy. Shift Key is hosted by Robinson Meyer, executive editor of Heatmap, and Jesse Jenkins, a Princeton professor of energy systems engineering.

	Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p><blockquote>
<strong>Robinson Meyer: </strong>The PHEV story is really interesting here, and the hybrid story is interesting here, because three years ago, four years ago, Toyota was talking about how hybrids and plug-in hybrids were going to be the bridge for consumers.
	And what we have seen is that plug-in hybrid and hybrid sales have increased. 
	<br/>
<br/>
	Now, what’s funny is that Toyota has actually not really been selling those plug-in hybrids. It’s like a Stellantis story, right? It’s Jeep. Ford sells a very expensive plug-in hybrid. Toyota actually doesn’t sell plug-in hybrids. In fact, if Toyota made more plug-in hybrids, if they made more Prius Primes, this amazing-looking recent car for them — it’s a plug-in hybrid — then they would sell them. But they don’t make enough. So Toyota has kind of won this discursive cycle, but not actually made the plug-in hybrids that they were advocating for, you know, two or three years ago.
	<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Jesse Jenkins: </strong>Yeah. I mean, if you look at the numbers, about half of all the plug-in hybrids sold are Stellantis vehicles, right? Across the Jeep, Chrysler, Dodge, and Alfa Romeo brands, they don’t sell hybrids. They only sell plug-in hybrids. And they also don’t sell any, BEVs yet, either. They’re coming, later than the end of this year, probably, their first U.S. battery electric vehicle. <br/>
<br/>
	So, you know, Stellantis’ only offerings right now are a set of plug-in hybrids, and they’ve been selling them very effectively, partly because I think the tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act make them very competitively priced relative to the conventional Jeep or, Chrysler Pacifica minivan, or whatever else you’re looking at in the market. Why not get the plug-in hybrid, even if you don’t plug it in? 
	<br/>
<br/>
	But if you look at it, so they’ve sold about 46,000 plug-in hybrids in the first quarter of the year. Toyota, who talks about it more than anybody, only sold 11,600. So they sold like a quarter as many as Stellantis did —
	<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>Which is so crazy because also, the Toyota plug-in hybrids are great. They’re awesome cars. They should be making more of them!<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Jenkins: </strong>Yes, they should be selling 50,000 of them a quarter.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>Yeah, exactly. But they treat them — it’s so funny. The Toyota plug-in hybrids are central to the Toyota argument, and then they treat them like compliance cars. They don't make enough, even though they’re like, this is what consumers want. <br/>
<br/>
	And it’s funny: They were right. That is seemingly what consumers want. And it does seem like the availability of BEVs has like defanged plug-in hybrids and hybrids for consumers in a way that maybe we didn’t expect. Toyota’s not making them. It’s like they won the discourse cycle, but they’re not actually selling vehicles.
	<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Jenkins: </strong>Yeah. I mean, Toyota Group and Honda are really the undisputed kings or queens of hybrid electric vehicles. They sell far more than anybody else. But on the plug-in side, Stellantis is the No. 1 by far. They’re like half of the market, just themselves.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Corey Cantor:</strong> I was just going to say, to Rob’s point on just how much better the Toyota plug-in hybrids are, they’re getting 40-mile electric range between the Prius Prime and the RAV4 Prime — which by the way: RAV4, Model Y, you could have a RAV4 Prime-Model Y-off every quarter if Toyota was selling enough of those. <br/>
<br/>
	For those Stellantis PHEVs, the other one that’s big is the Chrysler Pacifica minivan, which, I know how much you guys love your minivans, here. Those are in the low 20-mileage. So what you’ve seen policymakers in California advocate for is really going towards a 50-mile minimum to begin to count PHEVs in what's called Advanced Clean Cars II. Which, in the kind of conventional popular media is often referred to as California’s ban of gas cars, which actually isn’t a ban of gas cars because even in 2035, you could sell 20% PHEVs if they meet a 50-mile electric range minimum.
	<br/>
<br/>
	My hope, from a climate standpoint, is if PHEVs are going to be a part of the story — and again, data-wise, they’re just not in the U.S. In some European countries ... or BYD, for example, you see 50-50 split between BEV and PHEV. Here, it’s remained 80-20. 
	<br/>
<br/>
	Just better PHEVs — just automakers delivering better PHEVs with 40[-mile] all-electric range, or 50[-mile]. I do think Hyundai and Kia might move in that direction, where they’re delivering those better PHEVs over time. But not to just take the, kind of, spin on them, and just say, wow, because Toyota or whatever automaker says PHEVs are great, that consumers should buy them. The PHEVs now just aren’t as good as they should be, and they can be better, and automakers can still make a profit off of it.
	<br/>
<br/>
	It’s one of those big myths, where it’s like, you see so many people say, “Have you considered a PHEV?” And it’s like, which PHEV? Because it’s really just the Jeep Wrangler and the Pacifica.

## Bob Graham, ex-US senator and Florida governor, dies at 87

date: 2024-04-17, from: VOA News USA

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Former U.S. Sen. and two-term Florida Gov. Bob Graham, who gained national prominence as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee in the aftermath of the 2001 terrorist attacks and as an early critic of the Iraq war, has died. He was 87.


Graham's family announced the death Tuesday in a statement posted on X by his daughter Gwen Graham.


“We are deeply saddened to report the passing of a visionary leader, dedicated public servant, and even more importantly, a loving husband, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather,” the family said.


Graham, who served three terms in the Senate, made an unsuccessful bid for the 2004 Democratic presidential nomination, emphasizing his opposition to the Iraq invasion.


But his bid was delayed by heart surgery in January 2003, and he was never able to gain enough traction with voters to catch up, bowing out that October. He didn’t seek reelection in 2004 and was replaced by Republican Mel Martinez.


Graham was a man of many quirks. He perfected the “workdays” political gimmick of spending a day doing various jobs from horse stall mucker to FBI agent and kept a meticulous diary, noting almost everyone he spoke with, everything he ate, the TV shows he watched and even his golf scores.


Graham said the notebooks were a working tool for him and he was reluctant to describe his emotions or personal feelings in them.


“I review them for calls to be made, memos to be dictated, meetings I want to follow up on and things people promise to do,” he said.


Graham was among the earliest opponents of the Iraq war, saying it diverted America’s focus on the battle against terrorism centered in Afghanistan. He was also critical of President George W. Bush for failing to have an occupation plan in Iraq after the U.S. military threw out Saddam Hussein in 2003.


Graham said Bush took the United States into the war by exaggerating claims of the danger presented by the Iraqi weapons of destruction that were never found. He said Bush distorted intelligence data and argued it was more serious than the sexual misconduct issues that led the House to impeach President Bill Clinton in the late 1990s. It led him to launch his short, abortive presidential bid.


“The quagmire in Iraq is a distraction that the Bush administration, and the Bush administration alone, has created,” Graham said in 2003.


During his 18 years in Washington, Graham worked well with colleagues from both parties, particularly Florida Republican Connie Mack during their dozen years together in the Senate.


Florida voters hardly considered Graham the wealthy Harvard-educated attorney that he was.


Graham’s political career spanned five decades, beginning with his election to the Florida House of Representatives in 1966.


He won a state Senate seat in 1970 and then was elected governor in 1978. He was re-elected in 1982. Four years later, he won the first of three terms in the U.S. Senate when he ousted incumbent Republican Paula Hawkins.

## A better, more compact UI for Firefox

date: 2024-04-17, from: OS News

Proton is Firefox’s new design, starting from Firefox 89. Photon is the old design of Firefox which was used until version 88. Proton’s overall feel is good, but there were a few things I didn’t like and wanted to improve.That’s why this project was born, and Lepton to denote light theme layer. Lepton’s photon styled is preserve Photon’s feeling while keep Original Lepton’s strengths. ↫ Firefox UI Fix GitHub page I do not like the current Firefox user interface, because even with the &#8216;compact&#8217; layout re-enabled in about:config, I find it just too bulky and wasteful of my screen real estate. I&#8217;ve been using the above Firefox user interface mod for ages now, and I can&#8217;t imagine using Firefox without it. The GitHub pages and guides are a bit of a mess and difficult to follow due to the project consisting of several overlapping different styles, but I just use the script listed here, selecting the style &#8220;2&#8221; when running the script. It won&#8217;t be for everyone, but for me, it makes Firefox nice and compact, turning it into a mouse-first interface without trying to accommodate touch. This is also by far not the only project with this goal, so if you&#8217;re using something else &#8211; feel free to list them.

## US Navy flies aircraft through Taiwan Strait a day after US-China defense talks

date: 2024-04-17, from: VOA News USA

TAIPEI, Taiwan — The U.S. 7th Fleet said a Navy P-8A Poseidon flew through the Taiwan Strait on Wednesday, a day after U.S. and Chinese defense chiefs held their first talks since Nov. 2022 in an effort to reduce regional tensions.


The patrol and reconaissance plane “transited the Taiwan Strait in international airspace,” the 7th Fleet said in a news release.


“By operating within the Taiwan Strait in accordance with international law, the United States upholds the navigational rights and freedoms of all nations,” the release said.




Although the critical 160 kilometer- (100 mile-) wide strait that divides China from the self-governing island democracy is international waters, China considers the passage of foreign military aircraft and ships through it a challenge to its sovereignty. China claims the island of Taiwan, threatening to defend by force if necessary despite U.S. military support for the island.


China had no immediate response to the report, but has in past issued stern protests and activated defenses in response to the passage of ships and military planes through the strait, particularly those from the U.S.


China also regularly sends navy ships and warplanes into the strait and other areas around the island.


“The aircraft’s transit of the Taiwan Strait demonstrates the United States’ commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific. The United States military flies, sails and operates anywhere international law allows," the 7th Fleet statement said.


Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke with his Chinese counterpart Adm. Dong Jun on Tuesday in the latest U.S. effort to improve communications with the Chinese military and reduce the chances of a clash in the region.


It was the first time Austin has talked to Dong and the first time he has spoken at length with any Chinese counterpart since November 2022. The call, which lasted a bit more than an hour, came as Secretary of State Antony Blinken is expected to travel to China this month for talks.


Military-to-military contact stalled in August 2022, when Beijing suspended all such communication after then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan. China responded by firing missiles over Taiwan and staging a surge in military maneuvers, including what appeared to be a rehearsal of a naval and aerial blockade of the island.

## LAMENT FOR THE PLEAT

The above is not a photograph of me, even as I was in my hey-day. But those are my trousers. Pleated. Pleated, reader! Pleated as trousers used to be, prior to plebeian flat-fronts which are to trousers what pug noses are to dogs. They are in a museum now, as soon will I be. We both belong to a more elegant, grander, more spacious epoch, before the advent of casual wear. Imagine Sebastian Flyte pacing the terraces of Brideshead pleatless. Or Gatsby - The Not So Great Gatsby - in crowded-crotch chinos.

## April 16, 2024 

date: 2024-04-17, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog

On Sunday, April 14, 2024, Iran fired about 170 drones, more than 120 ballistic missiles, and more than 30 cruise missiles from Iran, Iraq, Yemen, and areas controlled by Hezbollah in Lebanon toward Israel. The strike was in retaliation for a strike on Iran&#8217;s diplomatic complex in Damascus, Syria, on April 1, which killed two top commanders in Iran&#8217;s elite Revolutionary Guards, along with other officials. Israel has not claimed responsibility for the Syrian strike, but officials from other countries believe Israel is responsible. Iran warned its attack was coming, and Israel and the U.S., along with Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, and France, shot the missiles down. Israel sustained almost no damage. One Arab-Israeli girl was critically injured.

## US works on 'comprehensive response' on Iran, urges Israel to exercise restraint

date: 2024-04-17, from: VOA News USA

Washington — The United States said it is working with allies on a coordinated response to Iran's drone and missile strikes on Israeli soil over the weekend. At the same time, it continues to urge Israel to exercise restraint and avoid igniting a wider regional conflict.   


President Joe Biden is "coordinating with allies and partners, including the Group of Seven, and with bipartisan leaders in Congress, on a comprehensive response," national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in a statement 


The U.S. will impose new sanctions targeting Iran in the coming days, Sullivan said, including its missile and drone program and against entities supporting the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Iran’s Defense Ministry. 


The U.S. will bolster the integration of air and missile defense and early warning systems across the Middle East, he added.




Biden aides have repeatedly called for de-escalation. The president "does not want to see a war with Iran. Don't want to see the conflict widen or deepen," White House national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters Tuesday.  


Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to retaliate, but Israeli officials have not said how or when they might strike. 


"We will choose our response accordingly," said Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi, Israel's military chief. 


A direct Israeli strike on Iranian soil would amount to another significant escalation, with Tehran already pledging a much harsher response to such a counterattack.


Tehran launched more than 300 drones, ballistic missiles and cruise missiles, most of them intercepted by the Israeli military with the help of the U.S. and regional allies, causing only minor damage to an Israeli base. That suggests Iran may have calibrated the strikes to limit casualties or telegraphed advanced notice, which the White House denies.


Israel's counterstrike will likely target Iranian soil without killing civilians, said Jonathan Rynhold, head of the Political Studies Department at Israel's Bar-Ilan University. 


"And it would not seek to publicly hit any very obvious public symbolic buildings of the regime," he told VOA. "That could embarrass the regime and make them feel that they need to escalate it further."


Rynhold said that the Iranian strikes were "very, very carefully calculated," and predicted that a potential Israeli counterattack would be similarly calibrated. Still, they could easily lead to dangerous miscalculation, he said.


Israel could opt for covert operations targeting Iranian officials. Or it could launch a cyberattack, said Gregory Hatcher of White Knight Labs, a cybersecurity consultancy firm.


"If I was Israel, I would stick with the normal cyber warfare playbook that they've been using for the better part of the last 15 years, starting with Stuxnet in 2010," he told VOA.


Under a joint operation, Israel and the U.S. created Stuxnet malware and injected it into an Iranian nuclear facility that "made the centrifuges spin uncontrollably and destroyed millions of dollars and slowed down the nuclear capabilities of Iran," Hatcher said.


Iran said its Saturday strikes were in retaliation for an Israeli airstrike earlier this month on its diplomatic building in Damascus, Syria, that killed seven Iranian military advisers, including two generals.


Pressure on Netanyahu 


Netanyahu is facing intense international pressure to bring Israel's war in Gaza to an end and immense domestic pressure to free the hostages held by Hamas. 


Israel's war with Hamas began when the militant Palestinian group attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 240 hostage. Israel's response has killed nearly 34,000 Palestinians, according to the Health Ministry in Gaza. Many humanitarian organizations have warned of famine.


Some international leaders are accusing Netanyahu of intentionally escalating tensions with Iran. This includes Ayman Safadi, the foreign minister of Jordan, a U.S. ally that helped protect Israel from Tehran's attacks.


"It's no secret that Netanyahu's policy aims to expand the conflict to relieve the growing pressure on him globally as a result of the killing, war and destruction he is doing in Gaza," Safadi said Tuesday. 


Turkey, a NATO member, has also placed blame on Israel.


"The main one responsible for the tension that gripped our hearts on the evening of April 13 is Netanyahu and his bloody administration," Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Tuesday, echoing de-escalation calls by regional and Western leaders.


Israel has neither confirmed nor denied the Damascus attack and has not responded to the accusations from Jordan and Turkey.


It's unclear whether Netanyahu will heed calls to de-escalate as he calculates a response that satisfies far-right members of his government and his own political instincts, said Barbara Slavin, distinguished fellow at the Stimson Center.


"He has always wanted to attack Iran, in particular to go after the Iranian nuclear sites. He may see this as his last opportunity to defeat all of Israel's enemies — Hezbollah, Iran, you name it," she told VOA. "And who will stop him? I'm very, very worried about that."


Whatever option Netanyahu decides on, Biden has told him the U.S. will not participate in Israel's counterattack.


Begum Erzos of VOA's Turkish Service contributed to this report.

## Whitey Herzog, Hall of Fame baseball manager in US, dies at 92

date: 2024-04-17, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — Whitey Herzog, the gruff and ingenious Hall of Fame manager who guided the St. Louis Cardinals to three pennants and a World Series title in the 1980s, and perfected an intricate, nail-biting strategy known as "Whiteyball," has died. He was 92. 


Cardinals spokesman Brian Bartow said Tuesday that the team, based in the U.S. state of Missouri, was informed of Herzog's death by his family. Herzog, who had been at Busch Stadium on April 4 for the Cardinals' home opener, died on Monday, according to Bartow. 


"Whitey Herzog devoted his lifetime to the game he loved, excelling as a leader on and off the field," Jane Forbes Clark, chair of the Hall of Fame's board of directors, said in a statement. "Whitey always brought the best out of every player he managed with a forthright style that won him respect throughout the game." 


A crew-cut, pot-bellied tobacco chewer who had no patience for the "buddy-buddy" school of management, Herzog joined the Cardinals in 1980 and helped end the team's decade-plus pennant drought by adapting it to the artificial surface and distant fences of Busch Memorial Stadium. A typical Cardinals victory under Herzog was a low-scoring, 1-run game, sealed in the final innings by a "bullpen by committee," relievers who might be replaced after a single pitch, or temporarily shifted to the outfield, then brought back to the mound. 




The Cardinals had power hitters in George Hendrick and Jack Clark, but they mostly relied on the speed and resourcefulness of switch-hitters Vince Coleman and Willie McGee, the acrobatic fielding of shortstop and future Hall of Famer Ozzie Smith, and the effective pitching of starters such as John Tudor and Danny Cox and relievers Todd Worrell, Ken Dayley and Jeff Lahti. For the '82 champions, Herzog didn't bother rotating relievers, but simply brought in future Hall of Famer Bruce Sutter to finish the job. 


Under Herzog, the Cards won pennants in 1982, 1985 and 1987, and the World Series in 1982, when they edged the Milwaukee Brewers in seven games. Herzog managed the Kansas City Royals to division titles in 1976-78, but they lost each time in the league championship to the New York Yankees. 


Overall, Herzog was a manager for 18 seasons, compiling a record of 1,281 wins and 1,125 losses. He was named Manager of the Year in 1985 and voted into the Hall by the Veterans Committee in 2010, his plaque noting his "stern, yet good-natured style," and his emphasis on speed, pitching and defense. Just before he formally entered the Hall, the Cardinals retired his uniform number, 24. 


Dorrel Norman Elvert Herzog was born in New Athens, Illinois, a blue-collar community that would shape him long after he left. He excelled in baseball and basketball and was open to skipping the occasional class to take in a Cardinals game. Signed up by the Yankees, he was a center fielder who discovered that he had competition from a prospect born just weeks before him, Mickey Mantle. 


Herzog never played for the Yankees, but he did get to know manager Casey Stengel, another master shuffler of players who became a key influence.  


Like so many successful managers, Herzog was a mediocre player, batting just .257 over eight seasons and playing several positions. His best year was with Baltimore in 1961, when he hit .291. He also played for the Washington Senators, Kansas City Athletics and Detroit Tigers, with whom he ended his playing career, in 1963. 


"Baseball has been good to me since I quit trying to play it," he liked to say. 


Herzog is survived by his wife of 71 years, Mary Lou Herzog; their three children, Debra, David and Jim, and their spouses; nine grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren.

## South Korea cautiously optimistic about US-Japan military upgrades

date: 2024-04-17, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — South Korea is cautiously optimistic about alliance upgrades that the U.S. and Japan have planned to bolster security in East Asia and the Indo-Pacific region.


A South Korean Foreign Ministry spokesperson said the ministry “noted” that the U.S. and Japan, at their summit in Washington last week, spoke of “the defensive nature of the U.S.-Japan alliance” and emphasized “peace and stability” in the region.


The spokesperson continued via email to VOA’s Korean Service on Friday that “South Korea, the U.S. and Japan are making efforts to institutionalize expanded trilateral cooperation through agreements made at Camp David last year” and “to strengthen rules-based international order.”




The three countries held a trilateral summit at Camp David in August after Seoul and Tokyo mended ties frayed by disputes rooted in Japan’s colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula from 1910 to 1945.


At their bilateral summit held in Washington on April 10, Washington and Tokyo announced wide-ranging plans to revamp their military ties. 


The plans include preparations for Japan to develop and produce with the U.S. military hardware, including hypersonic missile interceptors.


U.S. Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel toured a Mitsubishi Heavy Industries F-35 fighter jet factory near Nagoya on Tuesday. He underlined the importance of Japan’s role in manufacturing weapons as U.S. supplies run thin amid crises in Europe and the Middle East.


The plans announced at the summit also call for Japan’s possible involvement in the AUKUS Pillar II security pact, enabling it to develop quantum computing, hypersonic, undersea and other advanced technologies. 


AUKUS is a defense and security group of Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States. AUKUS Pillar 2 refers to a suite of cooperative activities conducted by the three nations to develop and field “advanced capabilities.” 


Japan will hold trilateral exercises with the U.S. and the U.K. starting in 2025 as the Indo-Pacific and Euro-Atlantic regions become “ever-more linked,” according to the joint statement. 




The plans call for Japan to expand its security role and arms buildup in tandem with efforts to implement a national security strategy issued in 2022. That called for an increase in Japan’s defense budget and a shift from a defense-only policy to one that includes counterstrike capabilities amid threats from North Korea and China. 


In December, Japan eased its arms export control regime that had allowed it to sell components but not completed weapons. 


Cho Han-Bum, a senior research fellow at the Korea Institute for National Unification, said “Japan’s arms reinforcement can be viewed as a double-edged sword.”  


In an interview Monday with VOA’s Korean Service, he said the arms buildup significantly helps to deter threats from the Chinese military and North Korean nuclear weapons, but that it concerns South Korea.


Due to unresolved historical disputes from Japan’s colonization of Korea from 1910 to 1945, “trust” between the militaries of the two countries “is not restored fully,” even as they cooperate together now, he said.


South Korea, Japan, and the U.S. conducted a two-day joint naval exercise in the East China Sea from April 11 to 12. The exercise included anti-submarine warfare drills to counter North Korea’s underwater threats and interdiction drills aimed at blocking the North’s weapons shipments. 


South Korea, under President Yoon Suk Yeol, has been pursuing a policy of rapprochement with Tokyo, and has aligned itself closely with Washington in countering Beijing’s economic and military coercion.  


Under the previous administration of Moon Jae-in, Seoul relied for its security on the U.S. while bolstering economic relations with China. Ties with Tokyo remained tense. 


Much of the anti-Japanese sentiment still runs high in South Korea, despite Yoon’s outreach to Tokyo, especially among progressives who increased their majority in an April 10 parliamentary election. 


South Korea’s Foreign Ministry lodged a protest on Tuesday against Japan’s claim over a disputed island that sits midway between the two countries, called Dokdo by South Korea and Takeshima by Japan. 


Won Gon Park, an adjunct professor of North Korean studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul, said South Korea now has to “make a choice” whether to work more closely with Japan to counter threats from North Korea and China.


He said in an interview with VOA’s Korean Service that this might be necessary, as the U.S. builds a regional security structure to bolster defenses against China. 




At their summit, the U.S. and Japan also announced a planned revision of the command structure of U.S. forces in Japan. This will complement Japan’s plan to establish a joint operations command to improve coordination of its air, ground, maritime forces by 2025. 


Bruce Bennett, a senior defense analyst at the RAND Corporation, said Washington “is increasingly anxious to have global partners” step up their arms manufacturing because the U.S. is not producing enough military hardware to counter all the threats from Russia, China, North Korea and Iran.


Speaking with VOA by telephone on Friday, Bennett said what was announced at the summit was that “Japan would be a global partner,” enabling the U.S. to share highly sensitive “information, technology and other capabilities in exchange for taking responsibility with security and stability in the regions that go outside Northeast Asia.”


He added, “The U.S. recognizes South Korea can’t afford to send multiple divisions to other areas around the world because of the North Korean threats” but is “anxious” to have South Korea play a deeper global role, especially in the Indo-Pacific. 


Kim Hyungjin contributed to the report.

## Query Parsing and Understanding

date: 2024-04-17, from: Marginallia log

Been working on improving Marginalia Search query parsing and understanding. This is going to be a pretty long update, as it&rsquo;s a few months&rsquo; work.
Apart from cleaning up the somewhat messy query parsing code, a problem I&rsquo;m trying to address is that the search engine is currently only good at dealing with fairly focused queries, they don&rsquo;t need to be short, but if you try to qualify a search that is too broad by adding more terms, it often doesn&rsquo;t produce anything useful. 

<https://www.marginalia.nu/log/a_103_query_parsing/>
