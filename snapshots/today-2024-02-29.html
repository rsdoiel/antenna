<p>If we want to see even a modest reboot of blogging, as a community
thing, we’re going to have to start with something like blogrolls. I
wrote a bit yesterday about how blogrolls came about, and weblogs.com
and how that led to RSS and feed readers. This time, we don’t have to
wait for feeds to show up, they’re already there. It should happen more
quickly.</p>

<p>date: 2024-02-29, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
This week, Disney announced that it’s joining forces with India’s
Reliance Industries to create a streaming platform that will serve up
everything from live sports — notably cricket — to Disney films to TV
dramas. It’s a strategic move from Disney in the world’s most populous
country. Plus, goods prices receded, but services inflation is getting
sticky. And: the economics (and tunes) of an HBCU marching band.

<p>
Commuter electric bikes are a key segment helping
<a href="https://electrek.co/2022/05/20/electric-bikes-instead-of-cars/">reduce
America’s dependence on cars </a>for navigating cities. The
<a href="https://bit.ly/Propella-9S-Pro">Propella 9S Pro V2</a> is
designed squarely to get people to work, school, the coffee shop, or
just navigating town on their own schedule. But compared to many other
electric commuter bikes on the market, Propella does it with some
outstanding value and several features we rarely see at this price
level.

id="federal-reserves-preferred-inflation-gauge-picked-up-last-month-in-sign-of-still-elevated-prices">Federal
Reserve’s Preferred Inflation Gauge Picked Up Last Month in Sign of
Still-Elevated Prices</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — An inflation gauge favored by the Federal Reserve
increased in January, the latest sign that the slowdown in U.S. consumer
price increases is occurring unevenly from month to month.</p>
<p>The government reported Thursday that prices rose 0.3% from December
to January, up from 0.1% in the previous month. But in a more
encouraging sign, prices were up just 2.4% from a year earlier, down
from a 2.6% annual pace in December and the smallest such increase in
nearly three years.</p>
<p>The year-over-year cooldown in inflation is sure to be welcomed by
the White House as President Joe Biden seeks re-election. Still, even
though average paychecks have outpaced inflation over the past year,
many Americans remain frustrated that overall prices are still well
above where they were before inflation erupted three years ago. That
sentiment, evident in many public opinion polls, could pose a threat to
Biden’s re-election bid.</p>
<p>Inflation, as measured by the Fed’s preferred gauge, fell steadily
last year after having peaked at 7.1% in the summer of 2022. Supply
chain snarls have eased, reducing costs of parts and raw materials, and
a steady flow of job seekers has made it easier for employers to limit
wage increases, one of the drivers of inflation. Still, inflation
remains above the central bank’s 2% annual target.</p>
<p>Excluding volatile food and energy costs, prices rose 0.4% from
December to January, up from 0.1% in the previous month. And compared
with a year earlier, such so-called “core” prices rose 2.8%, down from
2.9% in December. Economists consider core prices a better gauge of the
likely path of future inflation.</p>
<p>Some of January’s inflation reflects the fact that companies often
raise prices in the first two months of the year, leaving January and
February price data high compared with the rest of the year. But the
costs of hospital and doctors’ services are also rising to offset the
sizable pay raises commanded by nurses and other in-demand health care
workers.</p>
<p>That trend could help keep inflation elevated in the coming months.
But by early spring, most analysts expect prices to settle back to the
milder pace of increases that occurred in the second half of 2023, when
inflation eased to a 2% annual rate.</p>
<p>January’s uptick in inflation helps explain the concern expressed by
many Fed officials, including Chair Jerome Powell, about potentially
cutting interest rates too soon this year. One influential official,
Christopher Waller of the Fed’s Board of Governors, said this month that
he would want to see two more months of inflation data after January’s
to determine whether prices were cooling sustainably toward the Fed’s
target level.</p>
<p>Beginning in March 2022, the Fed raised its benchmark rate 11 times
to attack the worst bout of inflation in 40 years. Those rate hikes have
helped cool inflation drastically. But they have also made borrowing
much more expensive for consumers and businesses. In particular, high
loan rates have throttled sales in the economy’s crucial homebuying
sector. Conversely, rate cuts by the Fed, whenever they happen, would
eventually lead to lower borrowing costs across the economy.</p>
<p>Thursday’s inflation data mirrors figures released earlier this month
that showed that the government’s more widely followed consumer price
index also rose faster in January than it had in previous months. The
Fed prefers the measure reported Thursday, in part because it accounts
for changes in how people shop when inflation jumps — when, for example,
consumers shift away from pricey national brands in favor of cheaper
store brands.</p>
<p>Several Fed officials have said they’re optimistic that inflation
will continue to fall back toward the Fed’s target level, with some
downplaying the recent pickup in prices as a one-time jump.</p>
<p>“The path will continue to be bumpy, and we should not overreact to
individual data readings,” Susan Collins, president of the Federal
Reserve Bank of Boston, said Wednesday. “I remain what I call a
‘realistic optimist’ in thinking that the economy is on a path to 2%
inflation on a sustained basis while maintaining a healthy labor
market.”</p>
<p>Some other officials sound more uncertain. Jeffrey Schmid, the new
president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, said this week
that “when it comes to too-high inflation, I believe we are not out of
the woods yet.”</p>
<p>Outside the Fed, most economists envision a steady, if fitful,
slowdown of inflation in the coming months. Economists at Goldman Sachs
project that core inflation, as measured by the Fed’s preferred gauge,
will drop rapidly to just 2.2% by May — low enough for the Fed to
initiate rate cuts in June.</p>

<h2 id="pluralistic-lies-damned-lies-and-uber-29-feb-2024">Pluralistic:
Lies, damned lies, and Uber (29 Feb 2024)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-29, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links Lies, damned lies, and Uber: Uber wants to pay its
Toronto drivers $2.50/hour (eh). Hey look at this: Delights to
delectate. This day in history: 2009, 2014, 2019 Colophon: Recent
publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects,
current reading Lies, damned lies, and Uber (permalink) Uber lies about
everything, especially money. Oh, and labour. Especially labour. And
geometry. Especially geometry! But especially especially money. They
constantly lie about money. Uber are virtuosos of mendacity, but in
Toronto, the company has attained a heretofore unseen hat-trick: they
told a single lie that is dramatically, materially untruthful about
money, labour and geometry! It’s an achievement for the ages. Here’s how
they did it. For several decades, Toronto has been clobbered by the
misrule of a series of far-right, clownish mayors. This was the result
of former Ontario Premier Mike Harris’s great gerrymander of 1998, when
the city of Toronto was amalgamated with its car-dependent suburbs. This
set the tone for the next quarter-century, as these outlying regions –
utterly dependent on Toronto for core economic activity and massive
subsidies to pay the unsustainable utility and infrastructure bills for
sprawling neighborhoods of single-family homes – proceeded to gut the
city they relied on. These “conservative” mayors – the philanderer, the
crackhead, the sexual predator – turned the city into a corporate
playground, swapping public housing and rent controls for out-of-control
real-estate speculation and trading out some of the world’s best transit
for total car-dependency. As part of that decay, the city rolled out the
red carpet for Uber, allowing the company to put as many unlicensed
taxis as they wanted on the city’s streets. Now, it’s hard to overstate
the dire traffic situation in Toronto. Years of neglect and
underinvestment in both the roads and the transit system have left both
in a state of near collapse and it’s not uncommon for multiple,
consecutive main arteries to shut down without notice for weeks, months,
or, in a few cases, years. The proliferation of Ubers on the road –
driven by desperate people trying to survive the city’s cost-of-living
catastrophe – has only exacerbated this problem. Uber, of course, would
dispute this. The company insists – despite all common sense and
peer-reviewed research – that adding more cars to the streets alleviates
traffic. This is easily disproved: there just isn’t any way to swap
buses, streetcars, and subways for cars. The road space needed for all
those single-occupancy cars pushes everything further apart, which means
we need more cars, which means more roads, which means more distance
between things, and so on. It is an undeniable fact that geometry hates
cars. But geometry loathes Uber. Because Ubers have all the problems of
single-occupancy vehicles, and then they have the separate problem that
they just end up circling idly around the city’s streets, waiting for a
rider. The more Ubers there are on the road, the longer each car ends up
waiting for a passenger:
https://www.sfgate.com/technology/article/Uber-Lyft-San-Francisco-pros-cons-ride-hailing-13841277.php
Anything that can’t go on forever eventually stops. After years of
bumbling-to-sinister municipal rule, Toronto finally reclaimed its
political power and voted in a new mayor, Olivia Chow, a progressive of
long tenure and great standing (I used to ring doorbells for her when
she was campaigning for her city council seat). Mayor Chow announced
that she was going to reclaim the city’s prerogative to limit the number
of Ubers on the road, ending the period of Uber’s “self-regulation.”
Uber, naturally, lost its shit. The company claims to be more than a
(geometrically impossible) provider of convenient transportation for
Torontonians, but also a provider of good jobs for working people. And
to prove it, the company has promised to pay its drivers “120% of
minimum wage.” As I write for Ricochet, that’s a whopper, even by Uber’s
standards:
https://ricochet.media/en/4039/uber-is-lying-again-the-company-has-no-intention-of-paying-drivers-a-living-wage
Here’s the thing: Uber is only proposing to pay 120% of the minimum wage
while drivers have a passenger in the vehicle. And with the number of
vehicles Uber wants on the road, most drivers will be earning nothing
most of the time. Factor in that unpaid time, as well as expenses for
vehicles, and the average Toronto Uber driver stands to make $2.50 per
hour (Canadian):
https://ridefair.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Legislated-Poverty.pdf
Now, Uber’s told a lot of lies over the years. Right from the start, the
company implicitly lied about what it cost to provide an Uber. For its
first 12 years, Uber lost $0.41 on every dollar it brought in, lighting
tens of billions in investment capital provided by the Saudi royals on
fire in an effort to bankrupt rival transportation firms and
disinvestment in municipal transit. Uber then lied to retail investors
about the business-case for buying its stock so that the House of Saud
and other early investors could unload their stock. Uber claimed that
they were on the verge of producing a self-driving car that would allow
them to get rid of drivers, zero out their wage bill, and finally turn a
profit. The company spent $2.5b on this, making it the most expensive
Big Store in the history of cons:
https://www.theinformation.com/articles/infighting-busywork-missed-warnings-how-uber-wasted-2-5-billion-on-self-driving-cars
After years, Uber produced a “self-driving car” that could travel one
half of one American mile before experiencing a potentially lethal
collision. Uber quietly paid another company $400m to take this disaster
off its hands:
https://www.economist.com/business/2020/12/10/why-is-uber-selling-its-autonomous-vehicle-division
The self-driving car lie was tied up in another lie – that somehow,
automation could triumph over geometry. Robocabs, we were told, would
travel in formations so tight that they would finally end the Red
Queen’s Race of more cars – more roads – more distance – more cars. That
lie wormed its way into the company’s IPO prospectus, which promised
retail investors that profitability lay in replacing every journey – by
car, cab, bike, bus, tram or train – with an Uber ride:
https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN1RN2SK/ The company has been
bleeding out money ever since – though you wouldn’t know it by looking
at its investor disclosures. Every quarter, Uber trumpets that it has
finally become profitable, and every quarter, Hubert Horan dissects its
balance sheets to find the accounting trick the company thought of this
time. There was one quarter where Uber declared profitability by marking
up the value of stock it held in Uber-like companies in other countries.
How did it get this stock? Well, Uber tried to run a business in those
countries and it was such a total disaster that they had to flee the
country, selling their business to a failing domestic competitor in
exchange for stock in its collapsing business. Naturally, there’s no
market for this stock, which, in Uber-land, means you can assign any
value you want to it. So that one quarter, Uber just asserted that the
stock had shot up in value and voila, profit!
https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2022/02/hubert-horan-can-uber-ever-deliver-part-twenty-nine-despite-massive-price-increases-uber-losses-top-31-billion.html
But all of those lies are as nothing to the whopper that Uber is trying
to sell to Torontonians by blanketing the city in ads: the lie that by
paying drivers $2.50/hour to fill the streets with more single-occupancy
cars, they will turn a profit, reduce the city’s traffic, and provide
good jobs. Uber says it can vanquish geometry, economics and working
poverty with the awesome power of narrative. In other words, it’s taking
Toronto for a bunch of suckers. (Image: Rob Sinclair, CC BY 2.0&lt;) Hey

<li>Apple workers reportedly nicknamed doomed EV ‘the Titanic disaster’
</h3>
<p>
More details are emerging about Apple’s ill-fated self-driving electric
vehicle, which was reportedly scrapped this week. The secret car –
codenamed “Project Titan” – had been in the works since 2014, and was
the company’s attempt to protect itself from an anticipated slow-down in
iPhone sales. Entering the car market seemed an obvious next step for
the company. “Apple would do to cars what it did to phones,”
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=b1e3b4e3ff&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>
Tim Higgins at <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>.
</p>
<p>
But after several starts and stops and at least four project leaders,
most employees knew it was going to fail. They even nicknamed it “the
Titanic disaster,”
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=d2c1001ab1&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">according
to</a> <em>The New York Times</em>. The project lacked clarity and
identity. Was it a Tesla rival? A self-driving car? All of the above?
“Project Titan’s ambitions became diminished, less compelling — from an
electric, robot car, then just about perfecting autonomy, then just
about an EV,” Higgins said.
</p>
<p>
One thing’s for sure, Project Titan was expensive, costing the company
$10 billion in the end. “Developing the software and algorithms for a
car with autonomous driving features proved too difficult,” the
<em>Times</em> reported. With that car crash in its rear-view mirror,
Apple plans to accelerate its work on generative AI.

<li>New York sues world’s top meatpacker over net zero claims
</h3>
<p>
<strong></strong>New York state has filed a lawsuit against the world’s
biggest meat producer, JBS USA, alleging the Brazil-based company has
misled the public about its environmental impact,
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=f75ff09d9a&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">according
to</a> <em>Bloomberg</em>. JBS has promised to be net zero by 2040, but
the filing claims the company cannot possibly reach this goal and has no
plan to do so. Food production accounts for one third of global
greenhouse gases, and livestock alone produces nearly 15% of all
emissions. JBS has annual revenues of more than $50 billion and its
supply chain relies on thousands of farms in the Amazon, many of which
overlap on Indigenous land and conservation areas,
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=bbf191b7f6&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>
<em>The New York Times</em>. Last year JBS was found to have one of the
lowest integrity scores among major companies that have made climate
pledges. It is currently trying to get its shares listed on the New York
Stock Exchange, but has faced fierce opposition from environmentalists,
U.S.-based beef producers, and both Democrats and Republicans.

<li>Oil and gas giants eye geothermal projects

<p>
<strong></strong>Major fossil fuel companies are investing big money in
geothermal energy startups and projects, <em>The Wall Street Journal
</em><a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=5d344e7ba3&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">reported</a>.
“Many of these companies are using the same technology employed by
frackers, but instead of searching for oil and gas, they are looking for
underground heat,” the <em>Journal</em> adds. That heat can be harnessed
to provide constant carbon-free electricity, and startups like Fervo
Energy are finding new ways to make drilling for geothermal energy much
cheaper, as
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=b7b2b359ca&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Heatmap</em>’s
Matthew Zeitlin recently reported</a>. Fervo is raising $244 million in
new funding, including $100 million from fossil fuel company Devon
Energy. “Once the industry is proven, I would not be surprised for
today’s oil-and-gas industry to either buy or build their way to be
significant players in advanced geothermal,” said billionaire former
Enron trader John Arnold.

<p>date: 2024-02-29, updated: 2024-02-29, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Artificial intelligence (AI) has been billed as the next frontier of
humanity: the newly available expanse whose exploration will drive the
next era of growth, wealth, and human flourishing. It’s a scary
metaphor. Throughout American history, the drive for expansion and the
very concept of terrain up for grabs—land grabs, gold rushes, new
frontiers—have provided a permission structure for imperialism and
exploitation. This could easily hold true for AI.
</p>
<p>
This isn’t the first time the concept of a frontier has been used as a
metaphor for AI, or technology in general. As early as 2018, the
powerful foundation models powering cutting-edge applications like

The Republican Party is dying as Trump and his supporters take it over,
but there is a larger story behind that crash. This moment looks much
like the other times in our history when a formerly stable two-party
system has fallen apart and Americans reevaluated what they want out of
their government.</p>

Deemed ‘Healthy, Active, Robust’ During Annual Physical Exam</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — U.S. President Joe Biden’s is a “healthy, active, robust
81-year-old male who remains fit to successfully execute the duties of
the presidency,” his physician, Dr. Kevin O’Connor, said in a statement
released by the White House on Wednesday, following Biden’s annual
physical examination. </p>
<p>“The president feels well, and this year’s physical identified no new
concerns. He continues to be fit for duty and fully executes all of his
responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations,” O’Connor
said following Biden’s visit to Walter Reed National Military Medical
Center in Bethesda, Maryland, earlier Wednesday.  </p>
<p>The checkup included consultations with optometry, dentistry,
orthopedics, physical therapy, neurology, sleep medicine, cardiology,
radiology and dermatology specialists, O’Connor said.  </p>
<p>It’s Biden’s third physical since taking office, amid concerns about
his age as he seeks a second term.  </p>
<p>“They think I look too young,” Biden joked to reporters at the White
House after his checkup. “There is nothing different than last year,” he
said.</p>
<p>According to the summary, Biden is currently being treated for
several conditions, including obstructive sleep apnea, gastroesophageal
reflux, seasonal allergies, arthritis and sensory peripheral neuropathy
of the feet. He also has atrial fibrillation with normal ventricular
response, a type of asymptomatic irregularity of the heartbeat.  </p>
<p>His doctor pronounced his conditions as “stable and well-controlled,”
with “three common prescription medications and three common
over-the-counter medications.”  </p>
<p>The symptoms were similar to those described in Biden’s 2023 physical
exam report that noted the president’s “stiff gait,” due to “a
combination of significant spinal arthritis, mild post-fracture foot
arthritis and a mild sensory peripheral neuropathy of the feet,” and
“occasional symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux,” that made him have to
clear his throat often.     </p>
<p>President didn’t undergo cognitive test </p>
<p>Recent events have highlighted Biden’s potential age-related issues,
including the president being described in a special counsel report as
an “elderly man with a poor memory.”      </p>
<p>In pushing back on reporters’ questions about his age, Biden insisted
that his “memory is fine” but shortly after mistakenly referred to
Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi as the president of Mexico.
That and two other mistaken references to world leaders’ names in recent
weeks fueled further attacks by his rivals.     </p>
<p>Responding to reporters’ questions during her briefing on Wednesday,
White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Biden did not
undergo a cognitive test as part of his physical because the president’s
physician, “doesn’t believe that he needs one.” </p>
<p>As president, Biden passes a cognitive test “every day,” Jean-Pierre
underscored. </p>
<p>A poll by the George Washington University shows 35% of respondents
say Biden was in good enough physical health to serve effectively as
president, and 38% said he has the mental soundness to serve effectively
as president.  </p>
<p>This is lower that what respondents say about the leading candidate
for the Republican presidential nomination, Donald Trump, who is four
years younger. For Trump, the numbers are 54% and 46%,
respectively. </p>
<p>“These figures indicate that this is a big problem for Biden,” Todd
Belt, professor of politics at George Washington University, told VOA.
“The campaign has changed course to attack Trump on his vulnerabilities
on the mental soundness issue.” </p>
<p>Biden did exactly that during an appearance on a late-night
television show earlier this week, by referencing a video in which Trump
appeared to forget his wife’s name.  </p>
<p>Americans concerned about Biden’s age</p>
<p>Trump was 70 when he took office in 2017, which made him the oldest
American president to be inaugurated until Biden broke his record at 78
in 2021. The former president has also made blunders, including praising
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban for his leadership of Turkey, and
confusing his Republican rival, Nikki Haley, with former U.S. House
Speaker Nancy Pelosi.   </p>
<p>A February ABC News/Ipsos poll conducted after the release of the
special counsel report indicated concerns among 59% of Americans
regarding the age and capability for a second term for both candidates,
although more Americans are worried about Biden compared with Trump,
said Clifford Young, president of Ipsos Public Affairs.   </p>
<p>“Age is an Achilles’ heel, is an anchor for Biden,” Young told VOA.
“It was four years ago. Without a doubt, it will be this year.”   </p>
<p>Though not publicly announced in advance, the timing of Biden’s
physical was anticipated, given the increasing focus on his age and
health in the context of his reelection campaign ahead of the November
election.</p>

Find Shelter at Washington State Church</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Tukwila, Washington — Though the number of migrants crossing daily
into the United States has fallen since December, local communities are
still scrambling to provide them with resources.</p>
<p>In the Pacific Northwest, Riverton Park United Methodist Church in
Tukwila, Washington, has become a shelter for hundreds of asylum-seekers
from Africa and Latin America.</p>
<p>At the church entrance is a hum of conversations in Portuguese,
French and Spanish, as asylum-seekers from countries such as Angola,
Congo and Venezuela gather to discuss their immigration claims.</p>
<p>Eurice, a bespectacled woman in her 50s, came from Venezuela. She
asked that her last name not be used.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to be a burden to the United States,” she said. “I
didn’t come here for a dream. Because of my work at the Colombian
consulate, I was labeled a traitor. I’ve worked all my life, and instead
of a peaceful retirement, I had to flee my country, walking through the
jungle, crossing seven countries.”</p>
<p>She said she is grateful to find shelter at this church.</p>
<p>“I thank God and the lady pastor for providing a roof over my head, a
bed to sleep in, and a plate of food. I am blessed already,” she
said.</p>
<p>Pastor Jan Bolerjack said that over the past year, Riverton has
helped find shelter, food and basic necessities for about 1,000
asylum-seekers of various ages, including pregnant women and toddlers.
Some of them arrived on their own. Others were brought in by the
police.</p>
<p>“The police department in Seattle found them on the streets in tents
and realized they were a different population from our usual homeless
individuals,” Bolerjack told VOA. “And so, they started bringing them
here. We went from zero to 100 by March 2023, and then 400 by July. In
October, the mayor of Tukwila declared a humanitarian emergency here.
And this is where we are now — continuing with this humanitarian
emergency.”</p>
<p>Unlike refugees who are eligible for resettlement services,
asylum-seekers are unable to work legally before their work permit
application is approved in a process that may last many months.</p>
<p>Bolerjack said her church has always had an open door for the most
vulnerable members of the community, but with limited resources, staff
and volunteers are overwhelmed.</p>
<p>“We have to provide everything, from food to laundry to bathrooms,
showers, tents, sleeping bags, mattresses. Everything has to come from
our friends and sources in the neighborhood,” she explained, walking
through the church hall where piles of donated mattresses, suitcases and
bags line the walls, and past a tiny kitchen, where several young
African women are cooking, and through an area where volunteers sort
donated clothes.</p>
<p>“Somehow, this place has been advertised across the country and at
the border as the place to go,” Bolerjack explained. “And you know, I
can take great pride in that. And yet, I’m kind of embarrassed when they
arrive after a long, traumatic journey and we have to say, ‘You have to
sleep in a wet, soggy tent.’”</p>
<p>In winter, when temperatures in the area dropped below zero, hundreds
of asylum-seekers were temporarily moved from tents to local hotels.
Some refused to return to the encampment, asking lawmakers for help.</p>
<p>State Representative Mia Gregerson is working to improve the state’s
response to the crisis with legislation to better coordinate migrant
services. Speaking with VOA at her office in the state capital, Olympia,
she said that despite Tukwila’s tradition of welcoming newcomers, the
community of fewer than 22,000 people shouldn’t be pushed to shoulder
the crisis on its own.</p>
<p>“I think they’re really rolling up their sleeves well and making a go
of it,” Gregerson said. “But there is a lot of uncertainty. What are we
going to do when the funds run out?”</p>
<p>She said processing asylum cases is often complicated by different
immigration statuses within a family. The bill she introduced with 18
co-sponsors seeks to empower the state’s Office of Refugee and Immigrant
Assistance.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“The idea is that the office is able to be nimble and utilize
resources quickly to not only put them into the system for legal advice
that’s correct and factual, or quickly get them the education resources,
transportation needs, and housing vouchers,” Gregerson said. “And we
need to maintain that contact with them so we can help them through the
system. Otherwise, they may fall victim to other types of issues.”</p>
<p>Washington Governor Jay Inslee’s current budget includes $5 million
in new funding for the Office of Refugee and Immigrant Assistance to
expand support services for newly arriving people who do not qualify for
federal refugee resettlement program services. A separate request for
$3.4 million is meant to help provide transitional and long-term housing
support to asylum-seekers in the county around Seattle.</p>
<p>Volunteers at Riverton help asylum-seekers complete the required
paperwork in English. In the past year, Bolerjack said just one person
won their asylum case and obtained a work permit.</p>
<p>That has not diminished the optimism of Jeremiah Lefau, who said he
left Angola with his wife and three children in December 2022 because of
insecurity in his country. They lived at Riverton for four months before
they were approved for family shelter. The children are enrolled in
local schools along with more than 100 young asylum-seekers. Lefau is
taking English classes and volunteers at the church.</p>
<p>“I feel good about the future,” he said. “Now, we need to help others
as the church helped us.”</p>
<p>Eurice, from Venezuela, hopes to return to her country someday.</p>
<p>“My family is still there. I miss them,” she said. “I hope to stay
here as long as necessary to be safe, and I thank the United States for
this opportunity they are giving us. But I have faith that one day my
country will be able to repair itself so I can return.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Biden administration is advancing measures making it
more challenging for asylum-seekers to stay in the U.S.</p>

<h2 id="biden-hails-crime-drop-pushes-for-more-reforms">Biden Hails
Crime Drop, Pushes for More Reforms</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — President Joe Biden brought law enforcement officials
from key swing states into the White House on Wednesday as he touted
declines in crime in major cities and pressed Congress for more action
on policing and gun control.</p>
<p>“Murder, rape, aggravated assault, robbery — all dropped sharply,
along with burglary, property crime and theft. And it matters,” Biden
said, speaking to a gathering that included law enforcement officials
from Chicago, Philadelphia, Miami, Detroit and Milwaukee.</p>
<p>Data from the nation’s top law enforcement entity, the Federal Bureau
of Investigation, show a clear decline in violent crime since 2020.
 </p>
<p>Detroit Police Chief James White, speaking at the White House on
Wednesday, said funding from Biden’s 2021 American Rescue Plan was “a
tremendous game changer for Detroit. It’s helped us reach these historic
lows in crime.”</p>
<p>White said Detroit’s police department has used those funds not just
for traditional law enforcement but also to expand the force’s mental
health services.</p>
<p>Floyd legislation</p>
<p>Biden on Wednesday also renewed his call for lawmakers to pass the
George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. That act, named after a Black
Minneapolis resident who was killed by a police officer in 2020, aims to
increase police accountability, transparency and data collection, and to
improve police practices and training. </p>
<p>He also called for further action on gun control, which has been
stridently opposed by powerful industry players like the National Rifle
Association.</p>
<p>“I’ve taken more executive actions to stop the flow of illegal guns
than any other administration in history,” Biden said. “And we beat the
NRA when I signed the most significant gun safety law in nearly 30
years. And we’re going to finish the job. We’re going to ban assault
weapons and high-capacity magazines next time around because it has to
be done.”</p>
<p>On the issue of gun ownership, a Pew Research Center poll found that
Americans are split. About one-third of Americans say they own a
gun.</p>
<p>Gun safety advocates on Wednesday praised the Biden administration’s
moves on gun safety. Monisha Henley, senior vice president of government
affairs at Everytown for Gun Safety, described Biden’s White House as
“the strongest gun safety administration in history.”</p>
<p>“Our top priority is getting the Biden-Harris administration to
implement the ATF’s lifesaving rule to close deadly loopholes in our
background check system as written,” she said in a statement provided to
VOA. ATF refers to the federal the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms
and Explosives.</p>
<p>“We plan to work closely with the administration this year as they
continue to advance their ambitious gun violence prevention agenda,”
Henley said.</p>
<p>But Biden faces harsh criticism over his public safety policies from
his main political challenger, Donald Trump. On Wednesday, Trump’s
campaign described Biden’s plan as a “pro-crime, anti-police
agenda.”</p>
<p>“President Donald Trump stands with police,” the campaign said in a
statement. “[Trump] is promising to indemnify all police officers and
law enforcement officials throughout the United States.”</p>
<p>Biden, on Wednesday, defined the challenge of public safety through a
different lens.</p>
<p>“There is no greater responsibility than to ensure the safety of
families, children, communities and our nation,” he said.</p>

<h2
id="iran-backed-attacks-slow-since-3-us-service-members-killed">Iran-backed
Attacks Slow Since 3 US Service Members Killed</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Capitol Hill — Attacks by Iranian-backed proxies have slowed since
the drone attack in January that killed three U.S. service members in
Jordan near the Syrian border.</p>
<p>There have been only two minor attacks in Syria since Feb. 2, when
the United States launched retaliatory attacks on targets in Syria and
Iraq.</p>
<p>But U.S. lawmakers warned Wednesday that the lull does not
de-escalate the risks of a regional conflict.</p>
<p>“Iran doesn’t have complete command and control of their operations,”
Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Ben Cardin said Wednesday.
“That makes this a very precarious situation, one that requires careful
clear-eyed American leadership. The risks of miscalculation would not
only lead to another deadly attack against U.S. service members, it
could lead to a full-scale regional war.”</p>
<p>The U.S. military said U.S. and coalition forces shot down five
Houthi drones late Tuesday in the Red Sea.</p>
<p>U.S. Central Command said the drones were launched from areas of
Yemen controlled by the Iran-backed Houthi rebels and that the drones
“presented an imminent threat to merchant vessels and to the U.S. Navy
and coalition ships in the region.”</p>
<p>The strikes were the latest in months of actions seeking to counter
attacks by the Houthis against vessels in the Red Sea.</p>
<p>The Houthis have said they are acting in solidarity with Palestinians
amid the war in Gaza.</p>
<p>“Iran thrives on chaos and suffering. The best way to undermine
threat in the long term is to offer an alternative — a comprehensive and
lasting peace that allows for real regional integration. I realize this
is no easy task, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t make our efforts,”
Cardin said.</p>
<p>The White House called the January attack “despicable and wholly
unjust,” and killed the leader of the Kataib Hezbollah group in a
targeted airstrike on Feb. 8 in retaliation.</p>
<p>Senate Republicans characterized the Biden administration’s overall
approach to dealing with Iran as weak.</p>
<p>Senator Jim Risch, the ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, called on the administration to do a better job of
denying Iran the resources it uses to commit acts of terrorism.</p>
<p>“The Biden administration has still not articulated a coherent Iran
policy outside of the nuclear negotiations. It’s time to change course,”
Risch said Wednesday. “We must adopt a policy of containment. Iran does
not think like the West, and it cannot be taught or turned into a change
in conduct.”</p>
<p>Brian Hook, the former U.S. special representative for Iran during
the Trump administration, told senators, “I believe that Iran knows that
it can safely expand its Axis of Resistance because of the Biden
administration’s deep aversion to defensive military action. The Biden
administration de-escalates to de-escalate. The Iranian regime thrives
under this strategy. American troops do not.”</p>
<p>The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is considering Risch’s
legislation to better enforce U.S. sanctions on Iranian oil.</p>
<p>“Iran is always going to make sure that Hezbollah gets what it
needs,” Democratic Senator Chris Murphy told VOA. “Their support for
proxies is a very low-cost means of provoking the United States. I mean,
we would be foolish to think that an oil sanction here, there, is going
to change Iran’s decision to fund a group like Hezbollah.”</p>

<h2 id="us-schools-wrestle-with-cellphones-in-classrooms">US Schools
Wrestle with Cellphones in Classrooms</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SAN FRANCISCO — In California, a high school teacher complains that
students watch Netflix on their phones during class. In Maryland, a
chemistry teacher says students use gambling apps to place bets during
the school day.</p>
<p>Around the country, educators say students routinely send Snapchat
messages in class, listen to music and shop online, among countless
other examples of how smartphones distract from teaching and
learning.</p>
<p>The hold that phones have on adolescents in America today is
well-documented, but teachers say parents are often not aware to what
extent students use them inside the classroom. And increasingly,
educators and experts are speaking with one voice on the question of how
to handle it: Ban phones during classes.</p>
<p>“Students used to have an understanding that you aren’t supposed to
be on your phone in class. Those days are gone,” said James Granger, who
requires students in his science classes at a Los Angeles-area high
school to place their phones in “a cellphone cubby” with numbered slots.
“The only solution that works is to physically remove the cellphone from
the student.”</p>
<p>Most schools already have rules regulating student phone use, but
they are enforced sporadically. A growing number of leaders at the state
and federal levels have begun endorsing school cellphone bans and
suggesting new ways to curb access to the devices.</p>
<p>The latest state intervention came in Utah, where Gov. Spencer Cox, a
Republican, last month urged all school districts and the state Board of
Education to remove cellphones from classrooms. He cited studies that
show learning improves, distractions are decreased and students are more
likely to talk to each other if phones are taken away.</p>
<p>“We just need a space for six or seven hours a day where kids are not
tethered to these devices,” Cox told reporters this month. He said his
initiative, which is not binding, is part of a legislative push to
protect kids in Utah from the harms of social media.</p>
<p>Last year, Florida became the first state to crack down on phones in
school. A law that took effect in July requires all Florida public
schools to ban student cellphone use during class time and block access
to social media on district Wi-Fi. Some districts, including Orange
County Public Schools, went further and banned phones the entire school
day.</p>
<p>Oklahoma, Vermont and Kansas have also recently introduced what is
becoming known as “phone-free schools” legislation.</p>
<p>And two U.S. senators — Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, and Tim
Kaine, a Virginia Democrat — introduced legislation in December that
would require a federal study on the effects of cellphone use in schools
on students’ mental health and academic performance. Theirs is one of
several bipartisan alliances calling for stiffer rules for social media
companies and greater online safety for kids.</p>
<p>Nationally, 77% of U.S. schools say they prohibit cellphones at
school for non-academic use, according to the National Center for
Education Statistics.</p>
<p>But that number is misleading. It does not mean students are
following those bans or all those schools are enforcing them.</p>
<p>Just ask teachers.</p>
<p>“Cellphone use is out of control. By that, I mean that I cannot
control it, even in my own classroom,” said Patrick Truman, who teaches
at a Maryland high school that forbids student use of cellphones during
class. It is up to each teacher to enforce the policy, so Truman bought
a 36-slot caddy for storing student phones. Still, every day, students
hide phones in their laps or under books as they play video games and
check social media.</p>
<p>Tired of being the phone police, he has come to a reluctant
conclusion: “Students who are on their phones are at least quiet. They
are not a behavior issue.”</p>
<p>A study last year from Common Sense Media found that 97% of kids use
their phones during school hours, and that kids say school cellphone
policies vary — often from one classroom to another — and aren’t always
enforced.</p>
<p>For a school cellphone ban to work, educators and experts say the
school administration must be the one to enforce it and not leave that
task to teachers. The Phone-Free Schools Movement, an advocacy group
formed last year by concerned mothers, says policies that allow students
to keep phones in their backpacks, as many schools do, are
ineffective.</p>
<p>“If the bookbag is on the floor next to them, it’s buzzing and
distracting, and they have the temptation to want to check it,” said Kim
Whitman, a co-founder of the group, which advises schools to require
phones be turned off and locked away all day.</p>
<p>Some students say such policies take away their autonomy and cut off
their main mode of communication with family and friends. Pushback also
has come from parents who fear being cut off from their kids if there is
a school emergency. Whitman advises schools to make exceptions for
students with special educational and medical needs, and to inform
parents on expert guidance that phones can be a dangerous distraction
for students during an emergency.</p>
<p>Jaden Willoughey, 14, shares the concern about being out of contact
with his parents if there’s a crisis. But he also sees the upsides of
turning in his phone at school.</p>
<p>At Delta High School in rural Utah, where Jaden is a freshman,
students are required to check their phones at the door when entering
every class. Each of the school’s 30 or so classrooms has a cellphone
storage unit that looks like an over-the-door shoe bag with three dozen
smartphone-sized slots.</p>
<p>“It helps you focus on your work, and it’s easier to pay attention in
class,” Jaden said.</p>
<p>A classmate, Mackenzie Stanworth, 14, said it would be hard to ignore
her phone if it was within reach. It’s a relief, she said, to “take a
break from the screen and the social life on your phone and actually
talk to people in person.”</p>
<p>It took a few years to tweak the cellphone policy and find a system
that worked, said Jared Christensen, the school’s vice principal.</p>
<p>“At first it was a battle. But it has been so worth it,” he said.
“Students are more attentive and engaged during class time. Teachers are
able to teach without competing with cellphones. And student learning
has increased,” he said, citing test scores that are at or above state
averages for the first time in years. “I can’t definitively say it’s
because of this policy. But I know it’s helping.”</p>
<p>The next battle will be against earbuds and smartwatches, he said.
Even with phones stashed in pouches, students get caught listening to
music on air pods hidden under their hair or hoodies. “We haven’t
included earbuds in our policy yet. But we’re almost there.”</p>

Seeks to Block Stormy Daniels, Cohen Testimony at Hush Money Trial</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Donald Trump is seeking to block porn star Stormy Daniels
and his former lawyer Michael Cohen from testifying at the former U.S.
president’s upcoming criminal trial on charges stemming from hush money
paid to Daniels before the 2016 election.</p>
<p>The case is the first of four indictments Trump faces to reach trial
as he campaigns to regain the presidency. New York state prosecutors in
Manhattan say Trump falsified business records to cover up Cohen’s
$130,000 payment to Daniels for her silence about a 2006 sexual liaison
she says she had with Trump.</p>
<p>Trump denies having had sex with Daniels and has pleaded not
guilty.</p>
<p>In a February 22 court filing made public this week, Trump lawyer
Todd Blanche said Cohen had a history of lying and that he would lie
again at the trial, which starts on March 25. Blanche said Daniels,
whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, would seek to use the trial to
promote and monetize her story.</p>
<p>“Similar to Cohen, she seeks to tell contrived stories with salacious
details of events she claimed occurred nearly 20 years ago,” Blanche
wrote.</p>
<p>Cohen’s lawyer declined to comment. A lawyer for Daniels did not
immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Cohen in 2018 pleaded guilty to violating federal campaign finance
laws with the payment to Daniels, which exceeded contribution limits,
and to lying before Congress. In testimony at a separate civil trial
last year, he said he lied during his 2018 guilty plea by admitting to
tax evasion. </p>
<p>In a February 15 court hearing, a prosecutor with the Manhattan
District Attorney’s Office said Trump would have the chance to
cross-examine Cohen at trial.</p>
<p>Cohen is expected to be a key witness against Trump. Prosecutors say
his payment to Daniels was part of a broader “catch-and-kill” scheme to
prevent allegations that Trump had extramarital affairs from coming to
light ahead of the 2016 election.</p>
<p>They said the scheme also included a $150,0000 payment a tabloid
publisher made on Trump’s behalf to Karen McDougal, a former Playboy
model who says she had sexual encounters with Trump, who denies the
affair.</p>
<p>Prosecutors are also asking Justice Juan Merchan to impose a gag
order restricting Trump from disparaging witnesses and others involved
in the case.</p>
<p>Trump faces 34 felony falsification of business records counts over
his 2017 reimbursements to Cohen for the Daniels payment. Prosecutors
say his New York-based family real estate company falsely recorded the
reimbursement as legal expenses.</p>
<p>Blanche said prosecutors should be barred from arguing that the
payments to Daniels and McDougal were part of an effort by Trump to
influence the 2016 election.</p>
<p>“Accounts of alleged interactions posed the risk of significant
reputational damage to President Trump, his family, and business
interests, separate and apart from his candidacy,” Blanche wrote.</p>
<p>Merchan will decide on the requests ahead of the trial, which is
expected to last up to six weeks.</p>
<p>Trump, the frontrunner for the 2024 Republican nomination, also faces
state and federal charges over his efforts to overturn his 2020 election
loss and a federal case over his handling of government documents after
leaving office. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges.</p>

id="older-us-adults-should-get-another-covid-shot-say-health-officials">Older
US Adults Should Get Another COVID Shot, Say Health Officials</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>new york — Older U.S. adults should roll up their sleeves for another
COVID-19 shot, even if they got a booster in the fall, U.S. health
officials said Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Americans 65 and
older should get another dose of the updated vaccine that became
available in September — if at least four months has passed since their
last shot. In making the recommendation, the agency endorsed guidance
proposed by an expert advisory panel earlier in the day.</p>
<p>“Most COVID-19 deaths and hospitalizations last year were among
people 65 years and older. An additional vaccine dose can provide added
protection … for those at highest risk,” CDC Director Dr. Mandy Cohen
said in a statement.</p>
<p>The advisory panel’s decision came after a lengthy discussion about
whether to say older people “may” get the shots or if they “should” do
so. That reflects a debate among experts about how necessary another
booster is and whether yet another recommendation would add to the
public’s growing vaccine fatigue.</p>
<p>Some doctors say most older adults are adequately protected by the
fall shot, which built on immunity derived from earlier vaccinations and
exposure to the virus itself. And preliminary studies so far have shown
no substantial waning in vaccine effectiveness over six months.</p>
<p>However, the body’s vaccine-induced defenses tend to fade over time,
and that happens faster in seniors than in other adults. The committee
had recommended COVID-19 booster doses for older adults in 2022 and
2023.</p>
<p>Virus still a threat</p>
<p>COVID-19 remains a danger, especially to older people and those with
underlying medical conditions. There are still more than 20,000
hospitalizations and more than 2,000 deaths each week due to the
coronavirus, according to the CDC. And people 65 and older have the
highest hospitalization and death rates.</p>
<p>Some members of the advisory panel said a “should” recommendation is
meant to more clearly prod doctors and pharmacists to offer the
shots.</p>
<p>Dr. Jamie Loehr, a committee member and family doctor in Ithaca, New
York, said that with the “should” recommendation, “I am trying to make
it easier for providers to say, ‘Yes, we recommend this.’”</p>
<p>In September, the government recommended a new COVID-19 shot recipe
built against a version of the coronavirus called XBB.1.5. That
single-target vaccine replaced combination shots that had been targeting
both the original coronavirus strain and a much earlier omicron
version.</p>
<p>Vaccine uptake has declined</p>
<p>The CDC recommended the new shots for everyone 6 months and older and
allowed that people with weak immune systems could get a second dose as
early as two months after the first.</p>
<p>Most Americans haven’t listened. According to the latest CDC data,
13% of U.S. children have gotten the shots and about 22% of U.S. adults
have. The vaccination rate is higher for adults 65 and older, at nearly
42%.</p>
<p>“In each successive vaccine, the uptake has gone down,” said
Dr. David Canaday, a Case Western Reserve University infectious-diseases
expert who studies COVID-19 in older people.</p>
<p>“People are tired of getting all these shots all the time,” said
Canaday, who does not serve on the committee. “We have to be careful
about over-recommending the vaccine.”</p>
<p>But there is a subset of Americans — those at higher danger of severe
illness and death — who have been asking if another dose is permissible,
said Dr. William Schaffner, a Vanderbilt University vaccines expert who
serves on a committee workgroup that has been debating the booster
question.</p>
<p>Indeed, CDC survey data suggest that group’s biggest worry about the
vaccine is whether it’s effective enough.</p>
<p>Agency officials say that among those who got the latest version of
the COVID-19 vaccine, 50% fewer will get sick after they come into
contact with the virus compared with those who didn’t get the fall
shot.</p>

Senate Republicans Block Democrats’ Bill Assuring Right to IVF</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Democrats on Wednesday failed in an attempt to rush
legislation through the U.S. Senate guaranteeing Americans’ access to in
vitro fertilization and other assisted reproductive technologies, after
an Alabama court designated frozen embryos as children.</p>
<p>The state Supreme Court ruling on February 16 that frozen embryos
should be considered children prompted at least three Alabama providers
to halt the IVF procedure that involves combining eggs and sperm in a
laboratory dish for couples having difficulty conceiving.</p>
<p>Alabama’s court ruling has raised concerns that those involved in IVF
could face prosecution because embryos that are found to be nonviable
are sometimes disposed of or used for research, and that it could
encourage other states to follow suit.</p>
<p>Democratic Senator Tammy Duckworth, an Iraq War veteran who suffered
grave injuries in combat in 2004, sought an immediate vote by the Senate
on Wednesday on passage of her “Access to Family Building Act”
legislation.</p>
<p>Her move for a vote, which required the consent of all 100 senators,
was promptly blocked by Republican Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith.</p>
<p>“The bill before us today is a vast overreach that is full of poison
pills that goes way too far, far beyond ensuring legal access to IVF,”
Hyde-Smith said.</p>
<p>Duckworth countered that her bill simply would guarantee access to
IVF treatments and facilities “without fear of being prosecuted,” while
also shielding IVF providers and health insurance companies.</p>
<p>While many Republican officeholders have expressed discomfort with
the Alabama court ruling, the party was not ready to fall in line with
Democrats on this hot-button issue that is linked to the national debate
over women’s right to abortion.</p>
<p>Duckworth told reporters on Tuesday that she struggled for a decade
with infertility following her military service in Iraq, which prompted
her and her husband to turn to IVF. They now have two children.</p>
<p>“I have five embryos that were created (using IVF); three that were
deemed to be nonviable, would not survive,” Duckworth said.</p>
<p>She said that at the time, in 2013, her doctor told her that if
“personhood laws” regarding embryos were to be enacted, “I could be
convicted of manslaughter or murder for discarding these three eggs that
were nonviable.”</p>
<p>Reproductive rights are expected to be a major issue in this year’s
presidential and congressional campaigns, with Democrats lashing out at
both the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 ruling overturning its landmark Roe
v. Wade case establishing a national right to abortion, as well as
subsequent state reproductive rights actions such as the one on IVF.</p>
<p>In a statement Wednesday, White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre
said the Republican blocking of Duckworth’s measure was
“outrageous.”</p>
<p>Jean-Pierre added that President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala
Harris “will continue to fight to protect access to reproductive health
care, including IVF, and call on Congress to restore the protections of

Mexico, Guatemala Boost Cooperation to Control Migrant Arrivals at
Southern Border</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken hosted a meeting
Wednesday in Washington with top Mexican and Guatemalan officials to
discuss managing irregular migration, displacement, and expanding lawful
immigration pathways in the Western Hemisphere.</p>
<p>Blinken, joined by Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas
and other high-level U.S. officials, met with Guatemalan Foreign Affairs
Minister Carlos Ramiro Martínez, Guatemalan Minister of the Interior
Francisco José Jiménez Irungaray, and Mexican Foreign Affairs Secretary
Alicia Bárcena Ibarra. </p>
<p>The three delegations agreed on the urgency of addressing the root
causes of irregular migration, expanding more legal pathways to the
U.S., and the creation of a U.S., Mexico, and Guatemala “operational
cell” to jointly tackle migration issues.</p>
<p>“We are really here to double down on the collaboration that we have
in dealing with migration flows. We know that all of us are living in
what is genuinely a historic time.  Around the world, more people are on
the move than at any time in recorded history, and the same is true, of
course, in our own hemisphere,” Blinken said. </p>
<p>Guatemala will also host the next Los Angeles Declaration on
Migration and Protection ministerial meeting in April. Martínez said
they do not see the migration issue as a problem, but a phenomenon. </p>
<p>“And we believe that behind this, of course, there is a fundamental
task for the Guatemalan state. We are the first who must manage the
needs of our population. We must create and provide opportunities so
that our people do not migrate, so that these flows of Guatemalans
seeking opportunities do not continue to grow. So, the first task is a
task for the Guatemalan state,” Martinez said. </p>
<p>During a background call with reporters on Tuesday, a U.S. official
said Mexican and Guatemalan nationals represent the largest number of
migrants that border officers currently encounter at the Southwest
border. </p>
<p>The official added that the United States is looking forward to
deepening trilateral efforts to expand legal pathways, including for
labor migration.</p>
<p>“One of our most successful lawful pathway initiatives — in 2023, we
issued over 442,000 visas to temporary and seasonal workers. Those who
work here through labor pathways contribute to the U.S. economy and send
money back home to support friends and family and invest in their
futures,” the U.S. official said.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, officials from the United States and Mexico met
and set goals to make migration numbers consistent, fight human
smuggling and create a plan to discourage migrants from crossing through
the dangerous Darién Gap in Panama.</p>
<p>The meetings come as the Biden administration considers cracking down
on asylum-seekers after a record number of migrants arrived at the
U.S.-Mexico border in December. The number fell by 41% in January. </p>
<p>“The difficult paths that migrants in our continent take towards the
North to seek better and more opportunities in life is transcendental. …
These geographical circumstances mean that as countries, we face most of
the cycles of the migration process. Guatemala and Mexico are origin,
transit, destination and return,” Barcena said.</p>
<p>Immigration has become one of the leading issues in this year’s
presidential election. Former President Donald Trump, who is likely to
face President Joe Biden in November, promises to take stronger action
on it. </p>
<p>For now, Biden is going to Brownsville, Texas, on Thursday. At the
same time, Trump will be going to Eagle Pass, Texas, which is also on
the border with Mexico.</p>

Congressional Leaders Reach Deal to Avert Government Shutdown</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — Democratic and Republican leaders in the U.S. Congress
on Wednesday announced they had reached a deal for advancing the 12
annual bills that fund an array of federal programs for the fiscal year
ending on Sept. 30 and could also avert government shutdowns on
Saturday. </p>
<p>The pact approved by House of Representatives and Senate leaders
would pave the way for votes on a stopgap funding bill to keep the
government operating normally through newly set March 8 and March 22
deadlines, giving lawmakers time to examine and debate the full-year
funding bills. </p>
<p>The temporary measure will be “voted on by the House and Senate this
week,” said the joint statement by House Speaker Mike Johnson, Senate
Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell,
House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries and the leaders of the two
chambers’ appropriations panels. </p>
<p>Republican Representative Kevin Hern told reporters the temporary
funding bill, which would be the fourth of the fiscal year that began
last Oct. 1, would be put to a House vote on Thursday. </p>
<p>If it were to fail, it would bring the federal government to the
brink of partial shutdowns early Saturday. </p>
<p>Both parties’ leaders will now work on explaining the deal to their
rank-and-file with the goal of persuading enough of them to back the
arrangement. </p>
<p>The deal would put six of the 12 funding bills on a path to passage
by March 8 with the remainder by March 22.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-we-know-about-dois">What do we know about DOIs</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-29, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<p>
Crossref holds metadata for approximately 150 million scholarly
artifacts. These range from peer reviewed journal articles through to
scholarly books through to scientific blog posts. In fact, amid such
heterogeneity, the only singular factor that unites such items is that
they have been assigned a document object identifier (DOI); a unique
identification string that can be used to resolve to a resource
pertaining to said metadata (often, but not always, a copy of the work
identified by the metadata).
</p>
<p>
What, though, do we actually know about the state of persistence of
these links? How many DOIs resolve correctly? How many landing pages, at
the other end of the DOI resolution, contain the information that is
supposed to be there, including the title and the DOI itself? How can we
find out?
</p>
<p>
The first and seemingly most obvious way that we can obtain some of
these data is by working through the most recent sample of DOIs and
attempting to fetch metadata from each of them using a standard python
script. This involves using the httpx library to attempt to resolve each
of the DOIs to a resource, visiting that resource and seeing what the
landing page yields.
</p>
<p>
Even this is not straightforward. Landing pages can be HTML resources or
they can be PDF files, among other things. In the case of PDF files, to
detect a run of text is not simple as a single line break can be enough
to foil our search. Nonetheless, when using this strategy we find the
following statistics:
</p>
<p>
Total DOI count in sample: 5000<br> Number of HTTP 200 response:
3301*<br> Percentage of HTTP 200 responses: 66.02%<br> Number of titles
found on landing page: 1580<br> Percentage of titles found on landing
page: 31.60%<br> Number of DOIs in recommended format found on landing
page: 1410<br> Percentage of DOIs in recommended format found on landing
page: 28.20%<br> Number of titles and DOIs found on landing page:
929<br> Percentage of titles and DOIs found on landing page: 18.58%<br>
Number of PDFs found on landing page: 1469<br> Percentage of PDFs found
on landing page: 29.38%<br> Percent of PDFs found on landing pages that
loaded: 44.50%
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>an HTTP 200 response means that the web page loaded correctly
</p>
<p>
While these numbers look quite low, the problem here is that a large
number of scholarly publishers use Digital Rights Management techniques
on their sites that block a crawl of this type. We can use systems like
Playwright to remote control browsers to do the crawling, so that the
request looks as much like a genuine user as possible and to evade such
detection systems. However, lots of these sites detect headless browsers
(where the browser is invisible and running on a server) and block them
with a 403 Permission Denied error.
</p>
<p>
There’s
<a href="https://github.com/infosimples/detect-headless" target="_blank">a
great Github javascript suite</a> that aims to help evade headless
detection. The tests it uses are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
User Agent: in a browser running with puppeteer in headless mode, user
agent includes Headless.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
App Version: same as User Agent above.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Plugins: headless browsers don’t have any plugins. So we can say that if
it has plugin it’s headful, but not otherwise since some browsers, like
Firefox, don’t have default plugins.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Plugins Prototype: check if the Plugin and PluginsArray prototype are
correct.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Mime Type: similar to Plugins test, where headless browsers don’t have
any mime type
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Mime Type Prototype: check if the MimeType and MimeTypeArrayprototype
are correct.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Languages: all headful browser has at least one language. So we can say
that if it has no language it’s headless.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Webdriver: this property is true when running in a headless browser.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Time elapse: it pops an alert() on page and if it’s closed too fast,
means that it’s headless.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Chrome element: it’s specific for chrome browser that has an element
window.chrome.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Permission: in headless mode Notification.permission and
navigator.permissions.query report contradictory values.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Devtool: puppeteer works on devtools protocol, this test checks if
devtool is present or not.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Broken Image: all browser has a default nonzero broken image size, and
this may not happen on a headless browser.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Outer Dimension: the attributes outerHeight and outerWidth have value 0
on headless browser.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Connection Rtt: The attribute navigator.connection.rtt,if present, has
value 0 on headless browser.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Mouse Move: The attributes movementX and movementY on every MouseEvent
have value 0 on headless browser.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Using the stealth plugin for Playwright also allows us to evade most of
these checks. This just leaves Mouse Move and Broken Image detection,
which I thought would not outweigh all the other factors. We can also
jitter the connection with arbitrary delays so that it should appear to
be coming at random intervals, rather than a robotic crawl.
</p>
<p>
Yet the basic fact is that we are still blocked from crawling many
sites. This does not happen when we put the browser into headful mode,
so current detection techniques have clearly evolved in the past half
decade (since Detect Headless) was designed.
</p>
<p>
If, however, we run the browser in a headful mode, the results are
somewhat stunningly different:
</p>
<p>
Total DOI count in sample: 5000<br> Number of HTTP 200 response:
4852<br> Percent of HTTP 200 responses: 97.04%<br> Number of titles
found on landing page: 2547<br> Percentage of titles found on landing
page: 50.94%<br> Number of DOIs in recommended format found on landing
page: 2424<br> Percentage of DOIs in recommended format found on landing
page: 48.48%<br> Number of titles and DOIs found on landing page:
1574<br> Percentage of titles and DOIs found on landing page: 31.48%<br>
Number of PDFs found on landing page: 2085<br> Percentage of PDFs found
on landing page: 41.70%<br> Percentage of PDFs found on landing pages
that loaded: 42.97%
</p>
<p>
Let’s talk about the resolution statistics. Other studies, looking at
general links on the web, have found a link-rot rate of about 60%-70%
over a ten-year period
<a href="https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?jyT6HY" target="_blank">(Lessig,
Zittrain, and Albert 2014; Stox 2022)</a>. The DOI resolution rate that
we have, with 97% of links resolving (or a 3% link-rot rate), is far
better and more robust than a web link in general.
</p>
<p>
Is 3% a good or a bad number? It’s more robust than the web in general,
but it still means that for every 100 DOIs, just under 3 will fail to
resolve. We also cannot tell whether these DOIs are resolving to the
correct target, except by using the metadata detection metrics (are the
title and DOI on the landing page, which we could only detect at a far
lower rate). It is entirely possible for a website to resolve with an
HTTP 200 (OK) response, but for the page in question to be something
very different to what the user expected, a phenomenon dubbed content
drift. A good example is domain hijacking, where a domain name expires
and spam companies buy them up. These still resolve to a web page, but
instead of an article on RNA, for a hypothetical example, the user gets
adverts for rubber welding hose. That said, other studies are also prone
to this and there is no guarantee that content drift doesn’t affect a
huge proportion of supposedly good links in the other studies, too.
</p>
<p>
Of course, one of the most frustrating elements of this exercise is
having to work around publisher blocks on content when visiting using a
server-only robot script. It’s important for us periodically to monitor
the uptime rate of the DOI system. We also recognise, though, that
publishers want to block malicious traffic. However, we can’t perform
our monitoring in an easy, automatic way if headless scripts are blocked
from resolving DOIs and visiting their respective landing pages. This is
not even a call for open access; it’s just saying that current anti-bot
techniques, sometimes implemented for legitimate reasons, stifle our
ability to know the landscape. Even if the bot resolved a DOI to just a
paywall, it would be easier for us to monitor this than it is now.
Similarly, CAPTCHA systems such as Cloudflare that would seem to offer
an easy way to distinguish between humans (good) and robots (bad) can
make life very difficult at the monitoring end. We would certainly be
grateful for any proposed solution that could help us to work around
these mechanisms.
</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">
Conclusion
</h2>
<p>
The context in which I wanted to know this information was so that we
can take a snapshot of a page and then, at a later stage, determine
whether it is down or has changed substantially. To do this, we are
developing
<a href="https://gitlab.com/crossref/labs/shelob/" target="_blank">Shelob</a>,
an experimental content drift spider system; that’s what we’ve used so
far to conduct this analysis. Over time, Shelob will evolve, we hope, to
give us a way to detect when content has drifted or gone offline. If,
however, we can’t detect whether an endpoint is good in the first place,
then we likewise cannot detect when things have gone wrong. On the other
hand, if, when we first visit, we find the DOI and title on the landing
page, but at some future point this degrades, we might be able to say
with some confidence that the original has died. I, personally, would
encourage publishers not to block automated crawlers, because it’s good
when we can determine these types of figures.

id="electricity-demand-is-surging-for-the-first-time-since-the-1990s">Electricity
Demand Is Surging for the First Time Since the 1990s</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-28, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTU4OTU4Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcyNzgzMzY2NX0.2Bgcnh4DFv19rA47X09Q5IIDVZ_Ojow2Y6Frz-LSB8c/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Think of all the stuff you use electricity for that you didn’t 20 or 25
years ago — all those devices, maybe even your car — and yet electricity
use has barely budged this century. In 2000, the country used about 4
million gigawatt-hours of electricity, according to the International
Energy Agency; in 2022, it used about 4.5 million GWh, a
<a href="https://www.iea.org/countries/united-states" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">growth
rate</a> of about 0.5%.
</p>
<p>
In some ways, the purpose of current U.S. <em>climate</em> policy is to
reverse this trend.
<a href="https://ifp.org/how-to-save-americas-transmission-system/#hard-and-soft-paths-revisited" target="_blank">Only
about a fifth</a> of all energy produced in the United States is
electrical. Removing carbon emissions from transportation, heating and
industry will require first converting all of those industries from
running on combusted hydrocarbons to running on electricity — while at
the same time, of course, working to make electricity generation
carbon-free.
</p>
<p>
All that is to say, we’re definitely going to be using more electricity.
Today, if you ask any utility, electricity market organization, or
anyone working on energy generation and transmission, they’ll tell you
we’re in for an era of load growth.
</p>
<p>
“For a long period of time, we could balance out additional demand with
efficiency improvements,” Xan Fishman, energy policy director at the
Bipartisan Policy Center, told me. “Recent forecast are showing we’re
going to need a lot more electricity.”
</p>
<p>
When GridStrategies LLC looked at
<a href="https://gridstrategiesllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/National-Load-Growth-Report-2023.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">documents
grid planners filed</a> with federal regulators, it found that their
aggregate five-year load growth forecasts had gone up from 2.6% in 2022
to 4.7% last year, while their forecast for peak demand, i.e. the
maximum amount grids plan on having to be able to provide, had shot up
by 18 GW. That’s the equivalent of about 35 gas-fired power plants
running on full blast.
</p>
<p>
In New England, for example, ISO-NE is forecasting
<a href="https://www.iso-ne.com/about/key-stats/electricity-use" target="_blank">2.4%
annual growth</a> over the next 10 years, while its winter peak demand
will grow by 3% per year thanks largely to electrifying transportation
and heating; that, in turn, is largely thanks to aggressive
decarbonization mandates in the region’s constituent states.
</p>
<p>
<del>
</del>
Not all of the demand growth we’re currently seeing comes from
electrifying our existing energy consumption. New sources of demand are
popping up all over the grid — which, especially where they’re generated
by new industrial uses, shows how the Biden administration’s combined
climate and industrial policy raises the bar for itself. As a result of
domestic content requirements for tax subsidies and explicit subsidies
for certain kinds of non-energy manufacturing (namely semiconductors),
manufacturing construction has shot up in the past few years. And these
new plants require huge amounts of electricity.
</p>
<p>
When PJM Interconnection, the 13-state East Coast and Midwest
electricity market,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/pjm-interconnection-forecast-electricity-data-centers-evs" target="_blank">was
making its load forecast</a>, it specifically called out Intel’s CHIPS
Act-funded facility under construction outside Columbus, Ohio; the
electrification of New Jersey ports funded by the Inflation Reduction
Act; and planned data centers in Maryland and Virginia as notable
examples of increased load generation. For AEP, the utility serving
Columbus,
<a href="https://www.pjm.com/-/media/library/reports-notices/load-forecast/2024-load-report.ashx" target="_blank">the
forecast peak summer load in 2030</a> has gone from about 23.5 GW to 26
GW, compared to around 21 GW in 2023. Dominion, the utility serving
Virginia and the booming Loudon County datacenter complex, forecast
annual load growth of around 5% over the next decade.
</p>
<p>
To get a sense of how tremendous that is, when the energy system
researchers with Princeton University’s REPEAT project wanted to project
how much electricity consumption would have to increase annually to
reach
<a href="https://repeatproject.org/docs/REPEAT_Climate_Progress_and_the_117th_Congress.pdf" target="_blank">net
zero by 2050</a>, it turned out to be “only” 2.4%. Virginia is planning
load growth at twice that rate just to feed electrons to its data
centers.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>“When you’re talking about a data center or a three-shift,
seven-day-a-week manufacturing process, that’s far less manageable”
than, say, electric cars, David Porter, vice president of
electrification and sustainable energy strategy at the Electric Power
Research Institute, told me. EVs can be powered at specific times based
on demand for electricity across the grid, or by a distributed energy
resource like residential solar and batteries. To power energy-hungry
manufacturing processes, though, requires the kind of consistency that
only fossil fuels and nuclear (or naturally limited renewables like
hydropower) have historically been able to provide.
</p>
<p>
There’s no better example of the tension between electrification and
emission reductions than in Georgia, where the state’s main utility
Georgia Power has said that its estimates for load growth between 2023
and 2031 had jumped up from less than 400 megawatts to 6,600, a 17-times
increase. The utility
<a href="https://www.georgiapower.com/content/dam/georgia-power/pdfs/company-pdfs/2023-irp-update-main-document.pdf" target="_blank">attributed
this forecasting</a> hike to “rapid economic expansion and an
unprecedented increase in the demand for energy to the state,” including
electric vehicle and battery manufacturing facilities, which the Biden
administration has done so much to boost demand for and encourage their
construction in the United States.
</p>
<p>
The utility also said that to serve this load growth, it would have to
add new renewable resources, acquire power from other utilities and
generators, <em>and</em> build new gas power plants, which immediately
raised the ire and suspicion of green groups. The Sierra Club
<a href="https://www.sierraclub.org/press-releases/2023/11/georgia-power-submits-shocking-plans-increase-fossil-fuel-spending" target="_blank">described</a>
the request as “shocking.”
</p>
<p>
But proponents of climate action shouldn’t necessarily despair at this
new load, Fishman told me. “It’s really easy to decarbonize if you stop
building stuff,” he said. “But [Americans] would likely keep buying
stuff, and that stuff would be built elsewhere, quite likely with
greater emissions intensity.”
</p>
<p>
In other words, “a resurgence of American manufacturing might lead to
more U.S. emissions than in a scenario where we aren’t increasing our
manufacturing base,” Fishman told me, but it’s “highly likely to reduce
global emissions.” That’s because even now, U.S. electricity is cleaner
than electricity in, for example,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/chinas-wildly-complex-energy-transition-explained-in-8-charts" target="_blank">China</a>,
which is still heavily reliant on coal. (According to the IEA, 63% of
China’s electricity comes from coal burning, compared to 20% in the
United States.)
</p>
<p>
Data centers, meanwhile, are expected to account for 6% of total
electricity demand in the U.S. by 2026, according to the IEA, up from
about 4% in 2022. And the AI ones will eat up even more: A ChatGPT query
is about nine times as energy intensive as a Google search,
<a href="https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/6b2fd954-2017-408e-bf08-952fdd62118a/Electricity2024-Analysisandforecastto2026.pdf" target="_blank">according
to the IEA</a>. If generative artificial intelligence grows at anywhere
near the rate that its proponents expect, it will lead to hefty
increases in electricity demand, both from manufacturing the chips
needed to power the systems and the electricity to power them. One
example is Silicon Valley Power, a utility serving, well, Silicon
Valley, which forecast load to double by 2035, “primarily” due to data
centers’ demand for electricity.
</p>
<p>
But there may be some reason for skepticism about these load growth
projections from data centers, Jon Koomey, a veteran information
technology and energy researcher, told me. The particularly energy
intensive large language models may not win out as a business, which
would slow the growth in data center electricity demand, he said. And
even if data centers continue to grow, they could also get far more
efficient in how they use electricity — and might just end up using less
than what they ask for from utilities.
</p>
<p>
“You don’t want to get caught short,” Koomey said, explaining why
requests for power will be biased on the high end. “There’s an incentive
for everyone to request more.”
</p>
<p>
But still, it’s no surprise that the companies at the heart of the data
center boom — Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI — have shown an interest in
finding ways to match that constant electricity demand with
non-carbon-emitting power. Their facilities need to be powered 24/7,
which existing renewable sources largely struggle to provide. (It’s
neither windy nor sunny 100% of the time.) This has led to a flurry of
investment and dealmaking by these companies to develop and procure
“clean firm” resources. Google
<a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/google-fervo-geothermal-energy-partnership/" target="_blank">has
a deal with Fervo</a>, the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/fervo-energy-tim-latimer-drilling-costs" target="_blank">enhanced
geothermal startup</a>, to purchase power generated by its operation in
Nevada, while Microsoft signed an agreement with Constellation to
purchase nuclear-generated electricity for its Virginia data centers to
<a href="https://www.constellationenergy.com/newsroom/2023/Constellation-signs-hourly-carbon-free-energy-matching-agreement-with-Microsoft-to-support-a-clean-powered-data-center.html" target="_blank">complement
its existing renewable power</a>. Silicon Valley Power also said in its
planning documents that it’s looking to acquire more geothermal
resources. And OpenAI’s Sam Altman has
<a href="https://www.helionenergy.com/articles/announcing-500-million-fundraise/" target="_blank">invested
in a fusion company</a>.<strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong></strong>“If we want to grow our manufacturing base we need the
energy to make that work, we need to get that energy to those new
manufacturing plants,” Fishman said. “It would be bad if we had a bunch
of companies who said, ‘We want to build a factory,’ and can’t because
they don’t get enough electricity.”

<h2 id="kde-plasma-6-released">KDE Plasma 6 released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>KDE Plasma 6 has been released – and this is an important release
with two massive low-level stack upgrades. With Plasma 6, our technology
stack has undergone two major upgrades: a transition to the latest
version of our application framework, Qt, and a migration to the modern
Linux graphics platform, Wayland. We have done our best to ensure that
these changes are as smooth and unnoticeable to the users as possible,
so when you install this update, you will see the same familiar desktop
environment that you know and love. But these under-the-hood upgrades
benefit Plasma’s security, efficiency, and performance, and improve
support for modern hardware. Thus Plasma delivers an overall more
reliable user experience, while paving the way for many more
improvements in the future. Aside from this, there’s so much in this
release it’s hard to know where to begin. My favourite is the overhaul
of KDE’s default Breeze theme, which now uses far, far fewer frames,
meaning there’s fewer borders-on-borders. Spacing has also been made
more consistent within Breeze. Both of these efforts make KDE
applications and UI elements look a bit less cluttered and busy, which,
while easily missed if you don’t look for it, certainly cleans things up
nicely. Another important improvements is the addition of support for
HDR displays and colour management. Plasma on Wayland now has partial
support for High Dynamic Range (HDR). On supported monitors and
software, this will provide you with richer and deeper colors for your
games, videos, and visual creations. Set an ICC profile for each screen
individually and Plasma will adjust the colors accordingly. Applications
are still limited to the sRGB color space, but we are working on
increasing the number of supported color spaces soon. To improve
Plasma’s accessibility, we added support for color blindness correction
filters. This helps with protanopia, deuteranopia or tritanopia. Of
course, this release is accompanied by updates to a large number of KDE
applications, and several default settings in KDE have been changed as
well to better suit what most users would expect. Plasma Search has been
overhauled as well, making it faster and less resource-intensive, and
giving users the ability to better control how search results are
displayed. There’s a lot more here, so be sure to dive into the release
announcement, KDE Plasma 6 will find its way to your distribution or
operating system of choice over the coming weeks and months.</p>

<h2 id="use-of-a-calendar">2024-02-28 Use of a calendar</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-28, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
2024-02-28 Use of a calendar
</h1>
<p>
In the last millennium, I used the
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Diary.html">Emacs
Diary</a> for my calendar. I mean, why not? The
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Calendar_002fDiary.html">Emacs
Calendar</a> is great. Better than the <code>cal</code> command-line
utility, in any case. But eventually the world got mobile phones and I
wanted an online calendar.
</p>
<p>
The example from the Emacs Diary documentation:
</p>
<pre><code>12/22/2015  Twentieth wedding anniversary!
10/22       Ruth's birthday.
* 21, *:    Payday
Tuesday--weekly meeting with grad students at 10am
         Supowit, Shen, Bitner, and Kapoor to attend.
1/13/89     Friday the thirteenth!!
thu 4pm     squash game with Lloyd.
mar 16      Dad's birthday
April 15, 2016 Income tax due.
* 15        time cards due.
</code></pre>
<p>
Back then, Google didn’t want to be evil and I used Google Calendar.
When Google changed its mind, so did I. I switched to
<a href="2020-06-10_Radicale_for_Calendar_and_Contacts">Radicale</a>.
</p>
<p>
And yet, I sort of missed those diary file entries.
</p>
<p>
Today,
<a class="account" href="https://social.tadzik.net/users/tadzik" title="@tadzik@social.tadzik.net"><span
class="citation" data-cites="tadzik">@tadzik</span></a> posted a link to
<a href="https://codeberg.org/tadzik/caleb">caleb</a>.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<code>caleb</code> will do its best to interpret a calendar event
description, create a valid iCalendar event for it and optionally upload
it to a CalDAV server.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Nice!
</p>
<p>
Example usage, from the README:
</p>
<pre><code>$ caleb friday 5pm beer
</code></pre>
<p>
My main problem was that it took me a while to figure out what the
correct <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CalDAV">CalDAV</a> URL
is. I looked into my iPhone accounts (my first mistake) and tried
<code>https://example.org/radicale/alex</code>, then
<code>https://example.org/radicale/alex/</code>, then
<code>https://example.org/radicale/alex/Alex</code> – some of these URLs
failed silently, some of them created new collections with the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar">iCalendar</a> filename
as the collection name… and I didn’t get an warnings or error messages.
I mean, it makes sense. It’s like a filesystem, you can save whatever
you want. But it’s not what the calendar apps expect.
</p>
<p>
So, how do I discover the correct URL? Using a command-line
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV">WebDAV</a> explorer like
<code>cadaver</code>. The following example shows how I log into
Radicale and list the contents of the two directory I found. One of them
is full of <code>.vcf</code> files (contacts), the other is full of
<code>.ics</code> files (calendar entries). That’s the one!
</p>
<pre>

<p>
Now I’m finally ready to go back to <code>caleb</code> and create the
config file, <code>~/.config/caleb.conf</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>[caldav]
url = &quot;https://example.org/radicale/alex/cae8e041-61d9-b51a-57db-294b07e8dc1e&quot;

password = &quot;*secret*&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>
Enjoy!

<h2 id="new-wear-os-devices-run-two-operating-systems">New Wear OS
devices run two operating systems</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>Wear OS smartwatches have a dual-chipset architecture inclusive of a
powerful application processor (AP) and ultra low-power co-processor
microcontroller unit (MCU). The architecture has a powerful AP capable
of handling complex operations en-masse, and is seamlessly coupled with
a low power MCU. The Wear OS hybrid interface enables intelligent
switching between the MCU or the AP, allowing the AP to be suspended
when not needed to preserve battery life. It helps, for instance,
achieve more power-efficient experiences, like sensor data processing on
the MCU while the AP is asleep. At the same time, the hybrid interface
provides a seamless transition between these states, keeping a rich and
premium user experience without jarring transitions between power modes.
↫ Kseniia Shumelchyk on the Android Developers Blog The new OnePlus
Watch 2 is the first to use this new architecture, and the most
interesting part is that it runs not one, but two operating systems:
Wear OS, which is Android, running on the “AP”, and a smaller RTOS that
runs on the “MCU”. In the case of the OnePlus Watch 2, the “AP” is a
Snapdragon W5, while the “MCU” is a BES 2700, an ultra low power
microcontroller. I can’t seem to find any information on this “RTOS”,
but I’d really love to know what it’s based on.</p>

and WordPress owner is striking deals with OpenAI and Midjourney for
training data, says report</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>Speaking of collecting data, here’s another major content player
signing a deal to sell your content to “AI” companies. The owner of
Tumblr and WordPress.com is in talks with AI companies Midjourney and
OpenAI to provide training data scraped from users’ posts, a report from
404 Media alleges. The report, based on an anonymous source inside the
company, says that deals between Automattic and the two AI companies are
“imminent.” It follows nebulous rumors that have spread on Tumblr over
the past week, suggesting a deal with Midjourney could provide a new
revenue stream for the site. ↫ Adi Robertson at The Verge We use

<p>Meta will soon begin “collecting anonymized data” from users of its
Quest headsets, a move that could see the company aggregating
information about hand, body, and eye tracking; camera information;
“information about your physical environment”; and information about
“the virtual reality events you attend.” In an email sent to Quest users
Monday, Meta notes that it currently collects “the data required for
your Meta Quest to work properly.” Starting with the next software
update, though, the company will begin collecting and aggregating
“anonymized data about… device usage” from Quest users. That anonymized
data will be used “for things like building better experiences and
improving Meta Quest products for everyone,” the company writes. ↫ Kyle
Orland at Ars Technica Is it just me, or is the idea of Facebook
collecting this type of data in particular just exceptionally creepy? I
mean, browsing history or whatever is one thing – already bad enough –
but hand, body, and eye movements, and camera information? Of course,
this was the only expected course for Quest owners, but now that the
time is here, it still feels just as creepy as when we first imagined it
when Facebook bought Oculus.</p>

covering tailpipe and power sector emissions before they become

priorities.

paper</a> from the National Bureau of Economic Research shows (among
other things) just how key those regulations are. The paper considers
various future policy scenarios beginning in 2025, including one in
which the Inflation Reduction Act is fully repealed and another in which
the IRA stays <em>and</em> we get a carbon tax.

The heavy black line in the middle represents the Biden administration’s
current goal to reduce emissions 50% compared to 2005 levels by 2030.
Although none of the scenarios quite achieves that goal, IRA-plus-carbon
fee gets the closest. Notice, though, the gap in the timeline between
the current policy scenario and one without those two sets of emissions
rules. With them, the U.S. gets almost to a 50% cut by 2035. Without
them, it takes another five years at least.

Not only that, each ton of carbon will be much more expensive to remove.
With the proposed emissions standards, eliminating one metric ton of
U.S. carbon emissions would cost $43 in 2023 dollars. Without them, it
would cost $69.
</p>
<p>
Why do these scenarios start in 2025? Not only will the U.S. be
welcoming a new Congress (and, potentially, a new President) next year,
it’s also when large chunks of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
<a href="https://www.hamiltonproject.org/publication/paper/climate-tax-policy-reform-options-in-2025/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">expire</a>.
As one of the paper’s authors, University of California, Los Angeles law
professor Kimberly Clausing,
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/11/14/trump-tax-cuts-federal-budget-outlook/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a>
in the Washington Post last year alongside Yale University law professor
Natasha Sarin,
“<a href="https://waysandmeans.house.gov/buchanan-introduces-legislation-to-make-republican-tax-cuts-permanent/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Since
Republicans</a> and
<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/budget_fy2024.pdf#page=51" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Democrats
both</a> want to extend at least some of the expiring provisions, the
tax code is likely to be reopened. That’s a forcing mechanism” — though,
they add, “it also presents a serious risk.” While it might give
policymakers leverage to push through desired reforms — like, say, a
carbon tax — it could also “make things worse — for example, by simply
extending these unaffordable tax cuts.”
</p>
<p>
A carbon price has long been economists’ favored solution to the problem
of carbon emissions. But in the U.S. at least, it has also historically
been a
<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/10/11/as-the-world-burns" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">losing
argument</a>. Meanwhile, the Biden administration is expected to
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/17/climate/biden-epa-auto-emissions.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">soften
its final tailpipe emission rules</a>, giving automakers more time to go
electric in the face of
(<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/are-ev-sales-really-slowing-data" target="_self">perceived</a>,
if not actual) slumping consumer demand.
</p>
<p>
As these two charts make clear, that, too, is a risk — a gamble that
Biden will be able to win the support of the auto industry, hang onto
the White House, and keep the U.S. on track to meet his climate goals.
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/epa-car-emissions-evs-takeaways" target="_blank">Regulating
emissions from cars and power</a>, it turns out, is a major part of
that. Without those standards — and especially without the IRA — the
emissions picture gets grim.

After promising what would be the “world’s most thrilling and highly

back its plan to launch its first BEV by a year due to what it says is

<p>I use Safari on my iPad. The software just updated, and they widened
the width of icons in the browser chrome. This knocked three of my links
over into the menu, out of easy reach. Why did they feel they could
change something so basic? After using the iPad for 14 freaking years,
why shake up this tiny little corner of the system? What’s the possible
benefit. Or maybe this is just a bug and they’ll fix it? This is the
kind of thing that makes me put off updating. Yeah I know it sounds
small, but I really use my freaking iPad. It isn’t just for watching
movies. I can’t tell you how many iPads I’ve bought. It’s ridiculous.
Come on Apple, I’m a customer not a slave.</p>

<p>Another way to think about it. What if, say in California or New
York, 15% of the Democrats voted uncommitted to make sure Biden knows
he’s expected to stand up strong for reproductive rights. That helps
clear the way with any Democrats who feel they should go slowly. Voters
expressing their political strength. Again, that’s pure democracy. It’s
the best.</p>

that way. So give him an excuse to kick Netanyahu in the ass, and he’ll
be happy to do it. But he can’t openly threaten Israel now, not with
Trump over there saying he’d cut NATO, and thanks to him we’re ditching
Ukraine, even though Trump isn’t in office. All of our alliances are
fragile now, and getting worse every time Trump says or does something
awful. Biden has to take it steady. I listened to the interviews with

When private equity destroys your hospital (28 Feb 2024)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-28, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links When private equity destroys your hospital: Looters
literally want to kill you. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate.
This day in history: 2009, 2014, 2019, 2022 Colophon: Recent
publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects,
current reading When private equity destroys your hospital (permalink)
As someone who writes a lot of fiction about corporate crime, I
naturally end up spending a lot of time being angry about corporate
crime. It’s pretty goddamned enraging. But the fiction writer in me is
especially upset at how cartoonishly evil the perps are – routinely
doing things that I couldn’t ever get away with putting in a novel.
Beyond a doubt, the most cartoonishly evil characters are the private
equity looters. And the most cartoonishly evil private equity looters
are the ones who get involved in health care. (Buckle up.) Writing for
The American Prospect, Maureen Tcacik details a national scandal: the
collapse of PE-backed hospital chain Steward Health, a company that
bought and looted hospitals up and down the country, starving them of
everything from heart valves to prescription paper, ripping off
suppliers, doctors and nurses, and callously exposing patients to deadly
risk:
https://prospect.org/health/2024-02-27-scenes-from-bat-cave-steward-health-florida/
Steward occupies a very special place in the private equity looting
cycle. Private equity companies arrange themselves on a continuum of
indiscriminate depravity. At the start of the continuum are PE funds
that buy productive and useful firms (everything from hospitals to
car-washes) using “leveraged buyouts.” That means that they borrow money
to buy the company and use the company itself as collateral: it’s like
you getting a bank-loan to buy your neighbor’s mortgage out from under
them, and using your neighbor’s house as collateral for that loan. Once
the buyout is done, the PE fund pays itself a “special dividend”
(stealing money the business needs to survive) and then starts charging
the business a “management fee” for the PE fund’s expertise. To pay for
all this, the PE bosses start to hack away at the company. Quality
declines. So do wages. Prices go up. The company changes suppliers,
opting for cheaper alternatives, often stiffing the old company. There
are mass layoffs. The remaining employees end up doing three peoples’
jobs, for lower wages, with fewer materials of lower quality.
Eventually, that top-feeding PE company finds a more desperate, more
ham-fisted PE company to unload the business onto. That middle-feeding
company also does a leveraged buyout, pays itself another special
dividend, cuts wages, staffing and quality even further. They switch to
even worse suppliers and stiff the last batch. Prices go up even higher.
Then – you guessed it – the middle-feeding PE company finds an even more
awful PE bottom-feeder to unload the company onto. That bottom feeder
does it all again, without even pretending to leave the business in
condition to do its job. The company is a shambling zombie at this
point, often producing literal garbage in place of the products that
made its reputation. Employees’ paychecks bounce, or don’t show up at
all. The company stops bothering to pay the lawyers that have been
fending off its creditors. Those lawyers sue the company, too. That’s
the kind of PE company Steward Health was, and, as the name suggests,
Steward Health is in the business of stripping away the very last
residue of value from community hospitals. As you might imagine, this
gets pretty fucking ugly. Steward owns 32 hospitals up and down the
country, though its holdings are dwindling as the company walks away
from its debt-burdened holdings, after years of neglect that have
rendered them unfit for use as health facilities – or for any other
purpose. Tcacik’s piece offers a snapshot of one such hospital:
Florida’s Rockledge Regional Medical Center, just eight miles from Cape
Canaveral. Rockledge is a disaster. The fifth floor was, at one point,
home to 5,000 bats. Five. Thousand. Bats. (Rockledge stiffed the
exterminators.) The bats were just the beginning. One of the internal
sewage pipes ruptured. Whole sections of the hospital were literally
full of shit, oozing out of the walls and ceiling, slopping over medical
equipment. That’s an urgent situation for any hospital, but for
Rockledge, it’s catastrophic, because Rockledge is a hospital without
any hospital supplies. Steward has stiffed the companies that supply
“heart valves, urology lasers, Impella catheters, cardiac
catheterization balloons, slings for lifting heavier patients, blood and
urine test reagents, and most recently, prescription paper.” Key medical
equipment has been repossessed. So have the Pepsi machines. The hospital
cafeteria had its supply of cold cuts repossessed:
https://www.reddit.com/r/massachusetts/comments/1agc1j4/comment/kolicqo/
It’s not just Steward’s nonpayments that reek of impending doom. Its
payments also bear the hallmarks of a scam artist on the brink of
blowing off the con. The company recently paid off a vendor with five
separate checks for $1m, each drawn on “a random hospital in Utah”
(Steward recently walked away from its Utah hospitals; its partners
there are suing it for stealing $18m on their way out the door). This
company – which owns 32 hospitals! – has resorted to gambits like
sending photos of fake checks to doctors it hasn’t paid in months as
“proof” that the money was coming (the checks arrived 22 days later).
Steward owes so much money to its employees – $1.66m to just one
doctors’ group. But the medical staff keep doing their jobs, and are
reluctant to speak on the record, thanks to Steward’s reputation for
vicious retaliation. Those health workers keep showing up to take care
of patients, even as the hospital crumbles around them. One clinician
told Tcacik: “I watched a bed collapse underneath a [patient] who had
just undergone hip surgery.” Rockledge has nine elevators, but only five
of them work – the other four have been broken for a year. The
hospital’s fourth floor has been converted to “a graveyard of broken
beds.” The sinks are clogged, or filled with foul gunk. There’s black
mold. Nurses have noted on the maintenance tags that the repair service
refuses to attend the hospital until their overdue bills are paid. The
fifteen-person on-site maintenance team was cut to just two workers.
Steward is just the latest looting owner of Rockledge. After the Great
Financial Crisis, private equity consultants helped sell it to Health
Management Associates. The hospital’s CEO took home a $10m bonus for
that sale and exited; Health Management Associates then quickly became
embroiled in a Medicare fraud and kickback scandal. Soon after,
Rockledge was passed on to Community Health Systems, who then sold it on
to Rockledge. Steward, meanwhile, was at that time owned by an even
bigger private equity giant, Cerberus, which then sold Steward off. That
deal was performatively complex and hid all kinds of mischief. Prior to
Cerberus’s sell-off of Steward, they sold off Steward’s real-estate. The
buyer was Medical Properties Trust, who gave Cerberus $1.25b for the
real-estate: three hospitals in Florida and three more in Ohio. Steward
then contracted to operate these hospitals on MPT’s behalf, and pay MPT
rent for the real-estate. This complex arrangement was key to siphoning
value out of the hospital and to keeping angry creditors at bay – if you
can’t figure out who owes you money, it’s a lot harder to collect on the
debt. The scheme was masterminded by Steward founder/CEO Ralph de la
Torre. De la Torre is notorious for taking a massive dividend out of the
company while it owed $1.4b to its creditors. He bought a $40m yacht
with the money. De la Torre was once feted as a business genius who
would “disrupt” healthcare. But as Steward’s private jet hops around
“Corfu, Santorini, St. Maarten and Antigua” as its hospitals literally
crumble, he’s becoming less popular. In Massachusetts, politicians have
railed against Steward and de la Torre (Governor Healey wants the
company to leave the state “as soon as possible”). Florida, by contrast,
is much more friendly to Steward. The state Health and Human Services
Committee chair Randy Fine is an ardent admirer of hospital
privatization and is currently campaigning to sell off the last
community hospital in Brevard County. The state inspectors are likewise
remarkably tolerant of Steward’s little peccadillos. The
quasi-governmental agency that inspects hospitals has awarded this
shit-and-bat-filled, elevator-free, understaffed rotting hulk “A” grades
for quality. These inspectors jointly represent a mismatched assortment
of private and public agencies, dominated by a nonprofit called
Leapfrog, the brainchild of Harvard public-health prof Lucian Leape, who
founded it in 2000. Leapfrog likes to tout its “transparent” assessment
criteria, and Steward are experts at hitting those criteria, spending
the exact minimum to tick every box that Leapfrog inspectors use as
proxies for overall quality and safety. This is a pretty great example
of Goodhart’s Law: “every measurement eventually becomes a target,
whereupon it ceases to be a good measurement”: https://xkcd.com/2899/
But despite Steward’s increasingly furious creditors and its decaying
facilities, the company remains bullish on its ability to continue
operations. Medical Properties Trust – the real estate investment trust
that is nominally a separate company from Steward – recently hosted a
conference call to reassure Wall Street investors that it would be a
going concern. When a Bank of America analyst asked MPT’s CFO how this
could possibly be, given the facility’s dire condition and Steward’s
degraded state, the CFO blithely assured him that the company would get
bailouts: “We own hospitals no one wants to see closed.” That’s the
thing about PE and health-care. The looters who buy out every
health-care facility in a region understand that this makes them too big
to fail: no matter how dangerous the companies they drain become, local
governments will continue to prop them up. Look at dialysis, a market
that’s been cornered by private equity rollups. Today, if you need this
lifesaving therapy, there’s a good chance that every accessible facility
is owned by a private equity fund that has fired all its qualified staff
and ceased sterilizing its needles. Otherwise healthy people who visit
these clinics sometimes die due to operator error. But they chug along,
because no dialysis clinics is worse that “dialysis clinics where
unqualified sadists sometimes kill you with dirty needles”:
https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/the-dirty-business-of-clean-blood The
bad news is that private equity has thoroughly colonized the entire
medical system. They took hospitals, fired the doctors, then took over
the doctors’ groups that provided outsource staff to the hospital:
https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/04/a-mind-forever-voyaging/#prop-bets
It’s illegal for private equity companies to own doctors’ practices
(doctors have to own these), but they obfuscated the crime with a
paper-thin pretext that they got away with despite its obvious
bullshittery:
https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/21/profitable-butchers/#looted The
financier who decides whether you live or die depends on an algorithm
that literally sets a tolerable level of preventable deaths for the
patients trapped in the practice:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/08/05/any-metric-becomes-a-target/#hca
Private equity also took over emergency rooms and boobytrapped them with
“surprise billing” – junk fees that ran to thousands of dollars that you
had to pay even if the hospital was in network with your insurer. They
made billions from this, and spent a many millions from that booty
keeping the scam alive with scare ads:
https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/21/all-in-it-together/#doctor-patient-unity
The whole health stack is colonized by private equity-backed monopolies.
Even your hospital bed!
https://pluralistic.net/2022/01/05/hillrom/#baxter-international Then
there’s residential care. Private equity cornered many regional markets
on nursing homes and turned them into slaughterhouses, places where you
go to die, not live:
https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/23/acceptable-losses/#disposable-olds
The palliative care sector is also captured by private equity. PE bosses
hire vast teams of fast-talking salespeople who con vulnerable older
people into entering an end-of-life system before they are ready to die.
Thanks to loose regulation, the nation is filled with fake hospices that
can rake in millions from Medicare while denying all care to their
patients (hospice patients don’t get life-extending medication or
procedures, by definition):
https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/26/death-panels/#what-the-heck-is-going-on-with-CMS
If you survive this long enough, Medicare eventually tells the hospice
that you’re clearly not dying and you get kicked off their rolls. Now
you have to go through the lengthy bureaucratic nightmare of convincing
the system – which was previously informed that you were at death’s door
– that you are actually viable and need to start getting care again
(good luck with that). If that kills you, guess what? Private equity has
rolled up funeral homes up and down the country, and they will scam your
survivors just as hard as the medical system that killed you did:
https://pluralistic.net/2022/09/09/high-cost-of-dying/#memento-mori The
PE sector spent more than a trillion dollars over the past decade buying
up healthcare companies, and it has trillions more in “dry powder”
allocated for further medical acquisitions. Why not? As the CFO of
Medical Properties Trust told that Bank of America analyst last week,
when you “own hospitals no one wants to see closed.” you literally can’t
fail, no matter how many people you murder. The PE sector is a reminder
that the crimes people commit for money far outstrip the crimes they
commit for ideology. Even the most ideological killers are horrified by
the murders their profit-motivated colleagues commit. Last year, Tkacic
wrote about the history of IG Farben, the German company that built
Monowitz, a private slave-labor camp up the road from Auschwitz to make
the materiel it was gouging Hitler’s Wehrmacht on:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/06/02/plunderers/#farben Farben bought the
cheapest possible slaves from Auschwitz, preferentially sourcing women
and children. These slaves were worked to death at a rate that put
Auschwitz’s wholesale murder in the shade. Farben’s slaves died an
average of just three months after starting work at Monowitz. The
situation was so abominable, so unconscionable, that the SS officers who
provided outsource guard-labor to Monowitz actually wrote to Berlin to
complain about the cruelty. The Nuremberg trials are famous for the Nazi
officers who insisted that they were “just following order” but were
nonetheless executed for their crimes. 24 Farben executives were also
tried at Nuremberg, where they offered a very different defense: “We had
a fiduciary duty to our shareholders to maximize our profits.” 19 of the
24 were acquitted on that basis. PE is committed to an ideology that is
far worse than any form of racial animus or other bias. As a sector, it
is committed to profit above all other values. As a result, its

<p>date: 2024-02-28, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>

2024 is a leap year, and tomorrow, Feb. 29, is a regular ol’ work day.
So what does that additional day mean for your paycheck? It’s pretty
straightforward for hourly workers but gets a little more complicated
for salaried employees. We’ll also take a look at how recalls impact
carmakers, hear about hope for averting a partial government shutdown,
and look at why markets aren’t looking at revised GDP figures.

are a lot of blogging communities out there in 2024, but we don’t think
of them that way. But they totally behave like a blogging community. I
remember when I was starting
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000621103057/http://www.weblogs.com/">weblogs.com</a>,
I wanted to get an idea of when sites were updating, so I didn’t have to
go hunting through a blogroll, clicking on links to find out if there
was anything new. So I wrote a script that worked off a list of blogs,
read each one in turn, and compared it with the last version we read,
and if there was a change, it would move it to the top of the list. I
didn’t just make it for myself, I shared it with everyone. There was a
mail list where people were freaking out about this. The server that
would read their blog every so often was called
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+subhonker">subhonker</a>.
This was something new and they were scared. I couldn’t show them the
benefit until the script had been running for a while. Everyone got
upset. I remember being confused and scared, but I guess from their
point of view it looked scary. I don’t know. In the end weblogs.com
became really popular, it became the central place to find out what’s
new with blogs, and then
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123225500/http://weblogs.com/stories/">evolved</a>
to use <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> so we
could find changes in even more detail. I guess the thing is people
should see the benefit before they see the price? And as an innovator,
we have to be aware of this, people may not see the benefit until they
can <i>use</i> it.</p>

<p>While politically challenging, a holistic update to U.S. immigration
laws based on a better understanding of American immigration needs and
the factors that are driving people to make the dangerous trek to cross
the border would help reduce the numbers of migrants arriving daily to
the U.S.-Mexico border and the challenges migration poses to receiving

The world’s top-selling EV maker apparently has no interest in bringing
its cars to the U.S. In an
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=52c4a73c70&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview</a>
with <em>Yahoo! Finance</em>, Stella Li, CEO of BYD Americas, called the
U.S. market “interesting,” but said it was too messy to be worth a great
investment from the Chinese carmaker. “U.S. market is a little bit slow
down on electrification and a lot of confusing,” Li said, adding:
“Everything is complicated. Politics are complicated … and it’s
confusing for the consumer, and then they don’t know which to choose.”
Meanwhile, in China, “the message is strong. If you are not investing
for electric car, you are out. You will die. You have no future.”<br/>

The news dovetails nicely with an opinion

penned by <em>Heatmap</em>’s Robinson Meyer yesterday in <em>The New
York Times</em>, in which he says American automakers need to recognize
that “Chinese companies now understand aspects of EV manufacturing
better than their American counterparts.” Even if BYD stays out of the
U.S. for now, Meyer notes Chinese automaker Geely is preparing to sell
the small, all-electric Volvo EX30 SUV in the U.S. for $35,000, and
BYD’s cheap EVs still threaten global sales of American cars. “In the
short term, American automakers — even the homegrown electric-only
carmakers like Tesla and Rivian — must be shielded from a wave of cheap
cars,” Robinson wrote. “But in the long term, Mr. Biden must be careful
not to cordon off the American car market from the rest of the world,
turning the United States into an automotive backwater of bloated,
expensive, gas-guzzling vehicles.”

that 21% of Navajo Nation homes and 35% of Hopi Indian Tribe homes
remain unelectrified, and even if homes do have electricity, they
frequently experience outages. The projects vary in cost and scope: Some
aim to install solar panels and battery storage and microgrids, others
focus on new hydroelectric facilities. There are heat pump initiatives
and EV charging stations. The projects have to submit a plan
demonstrating how they will benefit the local community and will undergo
negotiations with the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations before
they’re given the green light. The funding was made available through
the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.

id="biden-issues-executive-order-to-better-shield-americans-sensitive-data-from-foreign-foes">Biden
Issues Executive Order to Better Shield Americans’ Sensitive Data From
Foreign Foes</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — President Joe Biden on Wednesday is signing an executive
order aimed at better protecting Americans’ personal data on everything
from biometrics and health records to finances and geolocation from
foreign adversaries like China and Russia.</p>
<p>The attorney general and other federal agencies are to prevent the
large-scale transfer of Americans’ personal data to what the White House
calls “countries of concern,” while erecting safeguards around other
activities that can give those countries access to people’s sensitive
data.</p>
<p>The goal is to do so without limiting legitimate commerce around
data, senior Biden administration officials said on a call with
reporters. </p>
<p>Biden’s move targets commercial data brokers, the sometimes shadowy
companies that traffic in personal data and that officials say may sell
information to foreign adversaries or U.S. entities controlled by those
countries.</p>
<p>Most eventual enforcement mechanisms still have to clear complicated
and often monthslong rulemaking processes. Still, the administration
hopes eventually to limit foreign entities, as well as
foreign-controlled companies operating in the U.S., that might otherwise
improperly collect sensitive data, the senior officials said.</p>
<p>Data brokers are legal in the U.S. and collect and categorize
personal information, usually to build profiles on millions of Americans
that the brokers then rent or sell.</p>
<p>The officials said activities like computer hacking are already
prohibited in the U.S., but that buying potentially sensitive data
through brokers is legal. That can represent a key gap in the nation’s
national security protections when data is sold to a broker knowing it
could end up in the hands of an adversary — one the administration now
aims to close with the president’s executive action.</p>
<p>“Bad actors can use this data to track Americans, including military
service members, pry into their personal lives, and pass that data on to
other data brokers and foreign intelligence services,” the White House
wrote in a fact sheet announcing the move. “This data can enable
intrusive surveillance, scams, blackmail, and other violations of
privacy.”</p>
<p>The order directs the Department of Justice to issue regulations that
establish protections for Americans’ sensitive personal data, as well as
sensitive government-related data — including geolocation information on
sensitive government sites and members of the military. </p>
<p>The Justice Department also plans to work with Homeland Security
officials to build safety standards to prevent foreign adversaries from
collecting data. It will further attempt better checks to ensure that
federal grants going to various other agencies, including the
departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs, aren’t used to facilitate
Americans’ sensitive data flowing to foreign adversaries or U.S.
companies aligned with them.</p>
<p>The senior administration officials listed potential countries of
concern as China, Russia, North Korea, Iran, Cuba and Venezuela. But it
is China — and TikTok, which has over 150 million American users and is
a wholly owned subsidiary of Chinese technology firm ByteDance Ltd. —
that U.S. leaders have been most vocal about.</p>
<p>Rep. Mike Gallagher, a Wisconsin Republican who chairs the House
Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, recently noted,
“There’s no such thing as a private business in China.”</p>
<p>The senior administration officials stressed that the executive
action was designed to work in conjunction with legislative action. So
far, however, numerous bills seeking to establish federal privacy
protections have failed to advance in Congress.</p>
<p>Wednesday’s move follows Biden’s executive order on artificial
intelligence last fall that seeks to balance the needs of cutting-edge
technology companies with national security and consumer rights.</p>
<p>That sought to steer how AI is developed so that companies can profit
without putting public safety in jeopardy, creating early guardrails
meant to ensure that AI is trustworthy and helpful, rather than
deceptive and destructive.</p>

In the first week of January, the pharmaceutical giant Merck quietly
<a href="https://therecord.media/merck-insurance-settlement-notpetya">settled
its years-long lawsuit</a> over whether or not its property and casualty
insurers would cover a $700 million claim filed after the devastating
<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world/">NotPetya
cyberattack</a> in 2017. The malware ultimately infected more than
40,000 of Merck’s computers, which significantly disrupted the company’s
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1AD1AO/">drug and
vaccine production</a>. After Merck filed its $700 million claim, the
pharmaceutical giant’s insurers argued that they were not required to
cover the malware’s damage because the cyberattack was widely attributed
to the Russian government and therefore was excluded from standard
property and casualty insurance coverage as a “hostile or warlike act.”…

out of being indexed by search engines). This prompted me to, once
again, do the old mental dance of “Ugh, I haven’t even used this account
in years, should I just delete it?” followed by “But I’d want a backup

<h2 id="what-might-happen-without-a-leap-day-more-than-you-think">What
Might Happen Without a Leap Day? More Than You Think</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Leap year. It’s a delight for the calendar and math nerds
among us. So how did it all begin and why?</p>
<p>Have a look at some of the numbers, history and lore behind the (not
quite) every four-year phenom that adds a 29th day to February.</p>
<p>By the numbers</p>
<p>The math is mind-boggling in a layperson sort of way and down to
fractions of days and minutes. There’s even a leap second occasionally,
but there’s no hullabaloo when that happens.</p>
<p>The thing to know is that leap year exists, in large part, to keep
the months in sync with annual events, including equinoxes and
solstices, according to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at the California
Institute of Technology.</p>
<p>It’s a correction to counter the fact that Earth’s orbit isn’t
precisely 365 days a year. The trip takes about six hours longer than
that, NASA says.</p>
<p>Contrary to what some might believe, however, not every four years is
a leaper. Adding a leap day every four years would make the calendar
longer by more than 44 minutes, according to the National Air &amp;
Space Museum.</p>
<p>Later, on a calendar yet to come (we’ll get to it), it was decreed
that years divisible by 100 not follow the four-year leap day rule
unless they are also divisible by 400, the JPL notes. In the past 500
years, there was no leap day in 1700, 1800 and 1900, but 2000 had one.
In the next 500 years, if the practice is followed, there will be no
leap day in 2100, 2200, 2300 and 2500.</p>
<p>Still with us?</p>
<p>The next leap years are 2028, 2032 and 2036.</p>
<p>What would happen without a leap day?</p>
<p>Eventually, nothing good in terms of when major events fall, when
farmers plant and how seasons align with the sun and the moon.</p>
<p>“Without the leap years, after a few hundred years we will have
summer in November,” said Younas Khan, a physics instructor at the
University of Alabama at Birmingham. “Christmas will be in summer. There
will be no snow. There will be no feeling of Christmas.”</p>
<p>Who came up with leap year?</p>
<p>The short answer: It evolved.</p>
<p>Ancient civilizations used the cosmos to plan their lives, and there
are calendars dating back to the Bronze Age. They were based on either
the phases of the moon or the sun, as various calendars are today.
Usually they were “lunisolar,” using both.</p>
<p>Now hop on over to the Roman Empire and Julius Caesar. He was dealing
with major seasonal drift on calendars used in his neck of the woods.
They dealt badly with drift by adding months. He was also navigating
many calendars starting in many ways in the vast Roman Empire.</p>
<p>He introduced his Julian calendar in 46 BCE. It was purely solar and
counted a year at 365.25 days, so once every four years an extra day was
added. Before that, the Romans counted a year at 355 days, at least for
a time.</p>
<p>But still, under Julius, there was drift. There were too many leap
years! The solar year isn’t precisely 365.25 days! It’s 365.242 days,
said Nick Eakes, an astronomy educator at the Morehead Planetarium and
Science Center at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill.</p>
<p>Thomas Palaima, a classics professor at the University of Texas at
Austin, said adding periods of time to a year to reflect variations in
the lunar and solar cycles was done by the ancients. The Athenian
calendar, he said, was used in the fourth, fifth and sixth centuries
with 12 lunar months.</p>
<p>That didn’t work for seasonal religious rites. The drift problem led
to “intercalating” an extra month periodically to realign with lunar and
solar cycles, Palaima said.</p>
<p>The Julian calendar was 0.0078 days (11 minutes and 14 seconds)
longer than the tropical year, so errors in timekeeping still gradually
accumulated, according to NASA. But stability increased, Palaima
said.</p>
<p>The Julian calendar was the model used by the Western world for
hundreds of years. Enter Pope Gregory XIII, who calibrated further. His
Gregorian calendar took effect in the late 16th century. It remains in
use today and, clearly, isn’t perfect or there would be no need for leap
year. But it was a big improvement, reducing drift to mere seconds.</p>
<p>Why did he step in? Well, Easter. It was coming later in the year
over time, and he fretted that events related to Easter like the
Pentecost might bump up against pagan festivals. The pope wanted Easter
to remain in the spring.</p>
<p>He eliminated some extra days accumulated on the Julian calendar and
tweaked the rules on leap day. It’s Pope Gregory and his advisers who
came up with the really gnarly math on when there should or shouldn’t be
a leap year.</p>
<p>“If the solar year was a perfect 365.25 then we wouldn’t have to
worry about the tricky math involved,” Eakes said.</p>
<p>What’s the deal with leap year and marriage?</p>
<p>Bizarrely, leap day comes with lore about women popping the marriage
question to men. It was mostly benign fun, but it came with a bite that
reinforced gender roles.</p>
<p>There’s distant European folklore. One story places the idea of women
proposing in fifth century Ireland, with St. Bridget appealing to
St. Patrick to offer women the chance to ask men to marry them,
according to historian Katherine Parkin in a 2012 paper in the Journal
of Family History.</p>
<p>Nobody really knows where it all began.</p>
<p>In 1904, syndicated columnist Elizabeth Meriwether Gilmer, aka
Dorothy Dix, summed up the tradition this way: “Of course people will
say … that a woman’s leap year prerogative, like most of her liberties,
is merely a glittering mockery.”</p>
<p>The pre-Sadie Hawkins tradition, however serious or tongue-in-cheek,
could have empowered women but merely perpetuated stereotypes. The
proposals were to happen via postcard, but many such cards turned the
tables and poked fun at women instead.</p>
<p>Advertising perpetuated the leap year marriage game. A 1916 ad by the
American Industrial Bank and Trust Co. read thusly: “This being Leap
Year day, we suggest to every girl that she propose to her father to
open a savings account in her name in our own bank.”</p>
<p>There was no breath of independence for women due to leap day.</p>
<p>Should we pity the leaplings?</p>
<p>Being born in a leap year on a leap day certainly is a talking point.
But it can be kind of a pain from a paperwork perspective. Some
governments and others requiring forms to be filled out and birthdays to
be stated stepped in to declare what date was used by leaplings for such
things as drivers’ licenses, whether Feb. 28 or March 1.</p>
<p>Technology has made it far easier for leap babies to jot down their
Feb. 29 milestones, though there can be glitches in terms of health
systems, insurance policies and with other businesses and organizations
that don’t have that date built in.</p>
<p>There are about 5 million people worldwide who share the leap
birthday out of about 8 billion people on the planet. Shelley Dean, 23,
in Seattle, Washington, chooses a rosy attitude about being a leapling.
Growing up, she had normal birthday parties each year, but an extra
special one when leap years rolled around. Since, as an adult, she marks
that non-leap period between Feb. 28 and March 1 with a low-key
“whew.”</p>
<p>This year is different.</p>
<p>“It will be the first birthday that I’m going to celebrate with my
family in eight years, which is super exciting, because the last leap
day I was on the other side of the country in New York for college,” she
said. “It’s a very big year.”</p>

When we talk about carbon removal, we often focus on “direct air
capture” facilities — big factories that suck carbon dioxide out of the
ambient air.
</p>
<p>
But a simpler and easier way to remove carbon from the atmosphere may
exist. It’s called
“<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2022/04/big-tech-investment-carbon-removal/629545/">enhanced
rock weathering</a>” — grinding up rocks, spreading them out, and
exposing them to the ambient air — and it works, essentially, by
speeding up the Earth’s carbon cycle. Enhanced rock weathering recently
got a major vote of confidence from Frontier, a consortium of tech and
finance companies who have teamed up to support new and experimental
carbon removal technologies.
</p>
<p>
Frontier’s members include Stripe, Meta, Alphabet, Shopify, and McKinsey
&amp; Company. It aims to buy nearly $1 billion of various forms of
carbon removal in the next few years — an intervention meant to spur
commercial and investor interest in the sector.
</p>
<p>
In this episode, Jesse Jenkins, an energy systems expert and professor
at Princeton University, and I talk with Jane Flegal, a former Biden
White House climate adviser and now the market development and policy
lead at Frontier, about the
<a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2319436121">promise of
enhanced rock weathering</a> and why Frontier just
<a href="https://frontierclimate.com/portfolio/lithos">spent $57
million</a> to do it.

Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Jane Flegal: </strong>So enhanced weathering is a carbon removal
process that speeds up a natural process which is weathering of alkaline
materials. And so weathering happens naturally, it actually drives what
makes the earth habitable in the first place. It just happens over very,
very long periods. So essentially what happens is that rocks slowly
erode when they come into contact with acid rain essentially and —<br/>
<br/> <strong>Robinson Meyer: </strong>Naturally acidic rain?<br/> <br/>
<strong>Flegal: </strong>Yeah, not like acid rain the way we think of
it, rain that is acidic because it has some dissolved CO2. And so that
acidic rainwater interacts with rocks and erodes them, and it results in
CO2 being stored either as a solid carbonate or as a bicarbonate. So
that happens naturally, again, on very long time periods. <br/> <br/>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>And I just want to interrupt before we go any
further. What then happens, right, is that the CO2 winds up being
dissolved as a bicarbonate. It goes into the ocean.<br/> <br/>
<strong>Flegal: </strong>Into the ocean.<br/> <br/> <strong>Meyer:
</strong>And then what happens? It’s turned into …<br/> <br/>
<strong>Flegal: </strong>It sinks and becomes part of the Earth’s
crust.<br/> <br/> <strong>Meyer: </strong>Right. Or it gets turned into
a shell, a creature’s shell, and then it sinks again.<br/> <br/>
<strong>Flegal:</strong> It is functionally stable. It is
thermodynamically pretty much impossible to reverse.<br/> <br/>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>And you kind of said this, but I do want to draw
it out: This is the carbon cycle. This is a central Earth science
process. There’s nothing fancy about this.<br/> <br/> <strong>Jesse
Jenkins: </strong>The problem is it takes centuries to play out. It’s
just moving on geologic time. But this idea of enhanced weathering means
we can potentially speed that up, right?<br/> <br/> <strong>Meyer:
</strong>Sorry, I just want to — this is, like, the whole problem of
climate change, right? The problem of climate change is that we take
fossil fuels and carbon that’s stored in geological storage out of the
ground on historic time scales, on decadal … you know, every year we
take millions of tons of it out of the ground, and then it would only be
restored back to the ground by this extremely slow process. <br/> <br/>
<strong>Flegal: </strong>One way to think about carbon removal is, like,
taking stuff out of the fast cycle and putting it into the slow cycle,
basically. And essentially, you either inject CO2 underground, where
it’s where it’s stable, or you turn it into salt. These are kind of the
options. <br/> <br/> And so enhanced weathering, to exactly this point,
it’s enhanced for a reason, right? There’s regular old weathering, and
then there’s the enhanced kind, which aims to speed up this process that
typically takes millennia to years or days by either using more reactive
materials than the normal rocks that would just weather naturally or
increasing the surface area of the material that is exposed to CO2. So
grinding up rocks into very, very fine fine powder and exposing that
material to more favorable environments.

Biden?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-28, from: Robert Reich on Substack</p>
<p>Friends, The question was never whether Joe Biden would win the
Michigan primary. It was how successful would be a homegrown campaign to
persuade Michiganders to vote “uncommitted.” Well, we now have the
results, and they should serve as a wakeup call to Biden. With most
votes counted on Wednesday morning, 13% of Michigan’s Democratic primary
voters had chosen “uncommitted” — a share that represented more than
100,000 people in Michigan who made the effort to lodge their
disapproval of the president.</p>

<h2 id="us-army-slashing-thousands-of-posts-in-major-revamp">US Army
Slashing Thousands of Posts in Major Revamp</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Army is slashing the size of its force by about
24,000, or almost 5%, and restructuring to be better able to fight the
next major war, as the service struggles with recruiting shortfalls that
made it impossible to bring in enough soldiers to fill all the jobs.</p>
<p>The cuts will mainly be in already-empty posts — not actual soldiers
— including in jobs related to counterinsurgency that swelled during the
Iraq and Afghanistan wars but are not needed as much today. About 3,000
of the cuts would come from Army special operations forces.</p>
<p>At the same time, however, the plan will add about 7,500 troops in
other critical missions, including air-defense and counter-drone units
and five new task forces around the world with enhanced cyber,
intelligence and long-range strike capabilities.</p>
<p>Army Secretary Christine Wormuth said she and Gen. Randy George, the
Army chief, worked to thin out the number of places where they had empty
or excess slots.</p>
<p>“We’re moving away from counterterrorism and counterinsurgency. We
want to be postured for large-scale combat operations,” Wormuth told
reporters on Tuesday. “So we looked at where were there pieces of force
structure that were probably more associated with counterinsurgency, for
example, that we don’t need anymore.”</p>
<p>George added that Army leaders did a lot of analysis to choose the
places to cut.</p>
<p>“The things that we want to not have in our formation are actually
things that we don’t think are going to make us successful on the
battlefield going forward,” he said.</p>
<p>According to an Army document, the service is “significantly
overstructured” and there aren’t enough soldiers to fill existing units.
The cuts, it said, are “spaces” not “faces” and the Army will not be
asking soldiers to leave the force.</p>
<p>Instead, the decision reflects the reality that for years the Army
hasn’t been able to fill thousands of empty posts. While the Army as
it’s currently structured can have up to 494,000 soldiers, the total
number of active-duty soldiers right now is about 445,000. Under the new
plan, the goal is to bring in enough troops over the next five years to
reach a level of 470,000.</p>
<p>The planned overhaul comes after two decades of war in Iraq and
Afghanistan that forced the Army to quickly and dramatically expand in
order to fill the brigades sent to the battlefront. That included a
massive counterinsurgency mission to battle al-Qaida, the Taliban and
the Islamic State group.</p>
<p>Over time the military’s focus has shifted to great power competition
from adversaries such as China and Russia, and threats from Iran and
North Korea. And the war in Ukraine has shown the need for greater
emphasis on air-defense systems and high-tech abilities both to use and
counter airborne and sea-based drones.</p>
<p>Army leaders said they looked carefully across the board at all the
service’s job specialties in search of places to trim. And they examined
the ongoing effort to modernize the Army, with new high-tech weapons, to
determine where additional forces should be focused.</p>
<p>According to the plan, the Army will cut about 10,000 spaces for
engineers and similar jobs that were tied to counter-insurgency
missions. An additional 2,700 cuts will come from units that don’t
deploy often and can be trimmed, and 6,500 will come from various
training and other posts.</p>
<p>There also will be about 10,000 posts cut from cavalry squadrons,
Stryker brigade combat teams, infantry brigade combat teams and security
force assistance brigades, which are used to train foreign forces.</p>
<p>The changes represent a significant shift for the Army to prepare for
large-scale combat operations against more sophisticated enemies. But
they also underscore the steep recruiting challenges that all of the
military services are facing.</p>
<p>In the last fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, the Navy, Army and Air
Force all failed to meet their recruitment goals, while the Marine Corps
and the tiny Space Force met their targets. The Army brought in a bit
more than 50,000 recruits, falling well short of the publicly stated
“stretch goal” of 65,000.</p>
<p>The previous fiscal year, the Army also missed its enlistment goal by
15,000. That year the goal was 60,000.</p>
<p>In response, the service launched a sweeping overhaul of its
recruiting last fall to focus more on young people who have spent time
in college or are job hunting early in their careers. And it is forming
a new professional force of recruiters, rather than relying on soldiers
randomly assigned to the task.</p>
<p>In discussing the changes at the time, Wormuth acknowledged that the
service hasn’t been recruiting well “for many more years than one would
think from just looking at the headlines in the last 18 months.” The
service, she said, hasn’t met its annual goal for new enlistment
contracts since 2014.</p>

id="killing-of-georgia-nursing-student-at-center-of-us-immigration-debate">Killing
of Georgia Nursing Student at Center of US Immigration Debate</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Athens, Georgia — Laken Riley was a 22-year-old nursing student out
on her morning run at the University of Georgia when authorities say a
stranger dragged her into a secluded area and killed her, sending
shockwaves through campus as police searched for a suspect.</p>
<p>The arrest of a Venezuelan man who entered the U.S. illegally and was
allowed to stay to pursue his immigration case put the tragedy at the
center of the 2024 presidential campaign.</p>
<p>Former President Donald Trump blamed President Joe Biden and his
border policies for the Augusta University student’s fatal beating. A
conservative news site blasted “open-border elites” for accepting the
deaths of women such as Riley as “collateral damage.”</p>
<p>It is familiar ground for Trump, who launched his 2016 White House
bid by saying Mexicans were “bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some,
I assume, are good people.”</p>
<p>As president, he created an office for families whose loved ones were
victims of violent crimes committed by immigrants, which was quickly
dismantled under Biden.</p>
<p>The debate over the nation’s broken immigration system has emerged as
a major campaign issue amid an unprecedented migration surge that has
strained budgets in cities including New York, Chicago and Denver and
divided some Democrats.</p>
<p>Trump has dialed up his anti-immigrant rhetoric to say migrants are
“poisoning the blood” of the country. And he and other Republicans have
suggested migrants are committing crimes more often than U.S. citizens,
even though the evidence does not back up those claims.</p>
<p>Biden has criticized Republicans for turning against a bipartisan
border security deal after Trump decried it. He will visit the Texas
border city of Brownsville on Thursday, while Trump will be in another
Texas border city, Eagle Pass.</p>
<p>On his social media site, Trump posted, “Crooked Joe Biden’s Border
INVASION is destroying our country and killing our citizens! The
horrible murder of 22-year-old Laken Riley at the University of Georgia
should have NEVER happened!”</p>
<p>“He’s an animal that came in,” Trump said Tuesday on Michigan’s WFDF
radio station.</p>
<p>Democrats have been more muted, with many expressing sorrow for
Riley’s death and some accusing Trump of exploiting a tragedy and using
xenophobic rhetoric for political gain.</p>
<p>The White House extended “deepest condolences” to Riley’s family.
“People should be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law if
they are found to be guilty,” said spokesperson Angelo Fernández
Hernández.</p>
<p>U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Trump ally, predicted Riley’s death is
“gonna change this election as much as anything.”</p>
<p>“That’s a parent’s worst nightmare,” the South Carolina Republican
said.</p>
<p>Many studies have found immigrants are less drawn to violent crime
than native-born citizens. One published by the National Academy of
Sciences, based on Texas Department of Public Safety data from 2012 to
2018, reported native-born U.S. residents were more than twice as likely
to be arrested for violent crimes than people in the country
illegally.</p>
<p>Another in the journal Criminology analyzed multiple data sources
from 1990 to 2014 to conclude that increases in illegal immigration were
generally in sync with reductions in violent crime or had no significant
correlation.</p>
<p>A study published last year by the National Bureau of Economic
Research, a private group, found immigrants have been incarcerated at a
lower rate than U.S.-born white men since 1960.</p>
<p>“Whereas Democrats are increasingly more positive when talking about
immigrants and pointing to their contributions to the U.S., Republicans
remain negative and increasingly focus on crime and legality issues when
they talk about immigrants,” said Ran Abramitzky, a Stanford University
economics professor who has studied links between immigration and crime,
referring to analyses of congressional statements going back
decades.</p>
<p>Jon Feere, a former U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement
official in the Trump administration who now is director of
investigations at the Center for Immigration Studies, dismissed the
research. He pointed to migrants who don’t have legal permission to be
in the U.S., saying they are committing crimes just by being here.</p>
<p>“This type of fallout’s going to continue for many years to come,
even beyond this administration,” Feere said. “And they can continue to
ignore it, but the American people are paying attention.”</p>
<p>Families of victims have heartbreaking stories.</p>
<p>Don Rosenberg, a retired entertainment and publishing executive, lost
his 25-year-old son, Drew, in 2010, when a Honduran man who was in the
country illegally repeatedly struck him with his car in San Francisco
and tried to flee. As he spoke with families whose loved ones were
killed by immigrants, he concluded authorities were ignoring them, even
protecting perpetrators.</p>
<p>“I thought my case was an anomaly. No, my case was the rule,” said
Rosenberg, president of Advocates for Victims of Illegal Alien
Crime.</p>
<p>Rosenberg says the high-profile cases won’t resonate with voters
until news organizations give them more exposure “because Trump only
talks to people who support Trump.”</p>
<p>The man accused of killing Riley, Jose Ibarra, was arrested for
illegal entry in September 2022 near El Paso, Texas, amid an
unprecedented surge in migration and released to pursue his case in
immigration court.</p>
<p>At the time, the Border Patrol was releasing migrants with orders to
appear at an immigration office, not even scheduling court appearances.
That practice, which added years to how long it takes to resolve an
immigration case, largely ceased in February 2023.</p>
<p>It is unclear if Ibarra, 26, followed those instructions or applied
for asylum. Federal officials say he was arrested by New York police in
August for child endangerment and released, though New York officials
said Sunday they had no record of the arrest.</p>
<p>Iberra was living in Athens, Georgia, when Riley was killed last
week. His attorney has not responded to requests for comment.</p>
<p>Trump first mentioned the killing on Friday, calling it part of what
he has labeled “Biden migrant crime.” It comes after a group of migrants
brawling with police in New York touched off a political furor and
renewed debate over policies that limit cooperation with federal
immigration authorities.</p>
<p>The influential conservative site Breitbart News linked Riley’s death
to other women who were killed by people in the country illegally,
including Kate Steinle, who was shot at a crowded San Francisco pier in
2015. “Their deaths were all 100% preventable,” the site said.</p>

<p><strong><span class="citation" data-cites="Jessica">@Jessica</span>
Smith’s blog</strong> (date: 2024-02-28, from: Jessica Smith’s blog)</p>
<p>
Last night I was cooking a chicken stew, and I had to double-check my
recipe to remember which herbs I put in it (rosemary, thyme, basil, sage
and a bay leaf). As I was grabbing the little jars out of the cupboard,
it occurred to me that this list is pretty similar to that famous lyric
– <q>parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme</q> – and wondered, “Hmm, why is
it I never put parsley in this? Or, actually, into anything?” So I
pulled out my little jar of parsley, gave the contents a sniff (parsley
really doesn’t have a very appealing smell, hey) and read the
description on the jar’s side:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
A popular herb used to garnish or add a touch of colour to your
favourite meal. Great with sauces and egg dishes.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
“Oh yeah!” I remembered. “Parsley is so crap that even the parsley jar
can only suggest adding it to anything for cosmetic reasons. That’s why
I never use it.”
</p>
<p>
Clearly, it’s time we change the line in that song to “basil, sage,
rosemary and thyme”. And a bay leaf.

Marginalia Search, primarily to reduce its dependence on docker. I would
like it to be able to run on bare metal as well, which poses a problem
since configuring the application manually is a bit of a headache with
dozens of ports that need to be set up. It would also be desirable to be
able to run multiple instances of important services in order elliminate
downtime during upgrades.</p>
