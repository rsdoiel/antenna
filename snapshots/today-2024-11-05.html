Not that long ago it was hard to find a tablet priced under $100 that
was actually worth using. These days there are plenty of cheap tablets
that are good enough for basic tasks like reading web pages and
streaming movies – especially when you can find a mid-range model that’s
on sale for a […]

<h2 id="ghc-9.12.1-alpha2-is-now-available">GHC 9.12.1-alpha2 is now
available</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-05, from: Glasgow Haskell Compiler</p>
<h1>
GHC 9.12.1-alpha2 is now available
</h1>
<h4 class="text-muted">
Zubin Duggal - 2024-11-05
</h4>
<p>
The GHC developers are very pleased to announce the availability of the
second alpha release of GHC 9.12.1. Binary distributions, source
distributions, and documentation are available at
<a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/9.12.1-alpha2">downloads.haskell.org</a>.
</p>
<p>
We hope to have this release available via ghcup shortly.
</p>
<p>
GHC 9.12 will bring a number of new features and improvements,
including:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
The new language extension
<a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0522-or-patterns.rst">OrPatterns</a>
allowing you to combine multiple pattern clauses into one.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The
<a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0569-multiline-strings.rst">MultilineStrings</a>
language extension to allow you to more easily write strings spanning
multiple lines in your source code.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Improvements to the OverloadedRecordDot extension, allowing the built-in
<code>HasField</code> class to be used for records with fields of non
lifted representations.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The
<a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0409-exportable-named-default.rst">NamedDefaults</a>
language extension has been introduced allowing you to define defaults
for typeclasses other than <code>Num</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
More deterministic object code output, controlled by the
<code>-fobject-determinism</code> flag, which improves determinism of
builds a lot (though does not fully do so) at the cost of some compiler
performance (1-2%). See
<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/12935">#12935</a> for
the details
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
GHC now accepts type syntax in expressions as part of
<a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0281-visible-forall.rst">GHC
Proposal <span>#281</span></a>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The WASM backend now has support for TemplateHaskell.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
… and many more
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
A full accounting of changes can be found in the
<a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/9.12.1-alpha2/docs/users_guide/9.12.1-notes.html">release
notes</a>. As always, GHC’s release status, including planned future
releases, can be found on the GHC Wiki
<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/GHC-status">status</a>.
</p>
<p>
We would like to thank GitHub, IOG, the Zw3rk stake pool, Well-Typed,
Tweag I/O, Serokell, Equinix, SimSpace, the Haskell Foundation, and
other anonymous contributors whose on-going financial and in-kind
support has facilitated GHC maintenance and release management over the
years. Finally, this release would not have been possible without the
hundreds of open-source contributors whose work comprise this release.
</p>
<p>
As always, do give this release a try and open a
<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/new">ticket</a> if
you see anything amiss.

<p>date: 2024-11-05, from: Marginallia log</p>
<p>I recently put together a small library called Slop, for intermediate
on-disk data representation for the search engine, replacing a few
ad-hoc formats I had in place before. This post isn’t so much an attempt
to convince anyone else to use this library, as it makes trade-offs
catering to a fairly niche use case, but to explore some of its design
ideas, as it all came together very nicely, in the hopes that other
libraries can draw ideas from it.</p>

<p>I don't like being labeled as liberal or leftist. If I were a
conservative who believed in the rule of law I would be equally appalled
at the NYT coverage of this election. Our constitutional house is on
fire, and our supposed leading news org treats this as a normal
election. That's the problem.</p>

<h2 id="gsoc-2024-out-of-process-execution-for-clang-repl">GSoC 2024:
Out-Of-Process Execution For Clang-Repl</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-04, from: LLVM Blog</p>
<p>
Hello! I’m Sahil Patidar, and this summer I had the exciting opportunity
toparticipate in Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2024. My project revolved
aroundenhancing Clang-Repl by introducing Out-Of-Process Execution.
</p>
<p>
Mentors: Vassil Vassilev and Matheus Izvekov
</p>
<h2 id="project-background">
Project Background
</h2>
<p>
Clang-Repl, part of the LLVM project, is a powerful interactive C++
interpreter using Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation. However, it faced two
major issues: high resource consumption and instability. Running both
Clang-Repl and JIT in the same process consumed excessive system
resources, and any crash in user code would shut down the entire
session.
</p>
<p>
To address these problems, <strong>Out-Of-Process Execution</strong> was
introduced. By executing user code in a separate process, resource usage
is reduced and crashes no longer affect the main session. This solution
significantly enhances both the efficiency and stability of Clang-Repl,
making it more reliable and suitable for a broader range of use cases,
especially on resource-constrained systems.
</p>
<h2 id="what-we-accomplished">
What We Accomplished
</h2>
<p>
As part of my GSoC project, I’ve been focused on implementing
out-of-process execution in Clang-Repl and enhancing the ORC JIT
infrastructure to support this feature. Here is a breakdown of the key
tasks and improvements I worked on:
</p>
<h3 id="out-of-process-execution-support-for-clang-repl">
Out-Of-Process Execution Support for Clang-Repl
</h3>
<p>
<strong>PR</strong>:
<a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/110418">#110418</a>
</p>
<p>
One of the primary objectives of my project was to implement
<strong>out-of-process (OOP) execution</strong> capabilities within
Clang-Repl, enabling it to execute code in a separate, isolated process.
This feature leverages <strong>ORC JIT’s remote execution
capabilities</strong> to enhance code execution flexibility by isolating
runtime environments.
</p>
<p>
To enable OOP execution in Clang-Repl, I utilized the
<code>llvm-jitlink-executor</code>, allowing Clang-Repl to offload code
execution to a dedicated executor process. This setup introduces a layer
of isolation between Clang-Repl’s main process and the code execution
environment.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<strong>New Command-Line Flags</strong>:
</p>
<p>
To facilitate the out-of-process execution, I added two key command-line
flags:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<strong><code>–oop-executor</code></strong>This flag starts a separate
JIT executor process. The executor handles the actual code execution
independently of the main Clang-Repl process.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong><code>–oop-executor-connect</code></strong>This flag establishes
a communication link between Clang-Repl and the out-of-process executor.
It allows Clang-Repl to transmit code to the executor and retrieve the
results from the execution.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
With these flags in place, Clang-Repl can utilize
<code>llvm-jitlink-executor</code> to execute code in an isolated
environment. This approach significantly enhances separation between the
compilation and execution stages, increasing flexibility and ensuring a
more secure and manageable execution process.

</div>
<p>
During my work on <code>clang-repl</code>, I encountered an issue where
the JIT session would crash during incremental compilation. The root
cause was a bug in
<code>ObjectLinkingLayer::computeBlockNonLocalDeps</code>. The problem
arose from the way the worklist was built: it was being populated within
the same loop that records immediate dependencies and dependants, which
caused some blocks to be missed from the worklist. This bug was fixed by
<strong>Lang Hames</strong>.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="orc-jit-enhancements">
ORC JIT Enhancements
</h3>
<p>
As part of the OOP execution work, several improvements were made to ORC
JIT, the underlying framework responsible for dynamic compilation and
execution of code in Clang-Repl. These improvements target better
handling of incremental execution, especially for Mach-O and ELF
platforms, and ensuring that initializers are properly managed across
different execution environments.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Incremental Initializer Execution for Mach-O and
ELF</strong><strong>PRs</strong>:
<a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/97441">#97441</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/110406">#110406</a>
</p>
<p>
In a typical JIT execution environment, the <code>dlopen</code> function
is used to handle code mapping, reference counting, and initializer
execution for dynamically loaded libraries. However, this approach is
often too broad for interactive environments like Clang-Repl, where we
only need to execute newly introduced initializers rather than
reinitializing everything. To address this, I introduced the
<strong><code>dlupdate</code></strong> function in the ORC runtime.
</p>
<p>
The <code>dlupdate</code> function is a targeted solution that focuses
solely on running new initializers added during a REPL session. Unlike
<code>dlopen</code>, which handles a variety of tasks and can lead to
unnecessary overhead, <code>dlupdate</code> only triggers the execution
of newly registered initializers, avoiding redundant operations. This
improvement is particularly beneficial in interactive settings like
Clang-Repl, where code is frequently updated in small increments.
</p>
<p>
By streamlining the execution of initializers, this change significantly
improves the efficiency of Clang-Repl.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Push-Request Model for ELF
Initializers</strong><strong>PR</strong>:
<a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/102846">#102846</a>
</p>
<p>
A push-request model has been introduced to manage ELF initializers
within the runtime state for each <code>JITDylib</code>, similar to how
initializers are handled for Mach-O and COFF. Previously, ELF required a
fresh request for initializers with each invocation of
<code>dlopen</code>, but lacked mechanisms to register, deregister, or
retain these initializers. This created issues during subsequent
<code>dlopen</code> calls, as initializers were erased after the
<code>rt_getInitializers</code> function was invoked, making further
executions impossible.
</p>
<p>
To resolve these issues, the following functions were introduced:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong><code>__orc_rt_elfnix_register_init_sections</code></strong>:
Registers ELF initializers for the <code>JITDylib</code>.
</li>
<li>
<strong><code>__orc_rt_elfnix_register_jitdylib</code></strong>:
Registers the <code>JITDylib</code> with the ELF runtime state.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
With the new push-request model, the management and tracking of
initializers for each <code>JITDylib</code> state are now more
efficient. By leveraging Mach-O’s <code>RecordSectionsTracker</code>,
only newly registered initializers are executed, greatly improving
efficiency and reliability when working with ELF targets in
<code>clang-repl</code>.
</p>
<p>
This update is crucial for enabling out-of-process execution in
<code>clang-repl</code> on ELF platforms, offering a more effective
approach to managing incremental execution.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="additional-improvements">
Additional Improvements
</h3>
<p>
Beyond the main enhancements to Clang-Repl and ORC JIT, I also worked on
several other improvements:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Auto-loading Dynamic Libraries in ORC JIT.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>PR</strong>:
<a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/109913">#109913</a>
(On-going)
</p>
<p>
With this update, we’ve introduced a new feature to the ORC executor and
controller: <strong>automatic loading of dynamic libraries in the ORC
JIT</strong>. This enhancement enables efficient resolution of symbols
from both loaded and unloaded libraries.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
How It Works:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Symbol Lookup:</strong>When a lookup request is made, the system
first attempts to resolve the symbol from already loaded libraries.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Unloaded Libraries Scan:</strong>If the symbol is not found in
any loaded library, the system then scans the unloaded dynamic libraries
to locate it.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Key Addition: <strong>Global Bloom Filter</strong>A significant
improvement in this update is the introduction of a <strong>Global Bloom
Filter</strong>. When a symbol cannot be resolved in the loaded
libraries, the symbol tables from the scanned libraries are incorporated
into this filter. If the symbol is still not found, the bloom filter’s
result is returned to the controller, allowing it to skip checking for
symbols that do not exist in the global table during future lookups.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Additionally, the system tracks symbols that were previously thought to
be present but are actually absent in both loaded and unloaded
libraries. With these enhancements, symbol resolution is significantly
faster, as the bloom filter helps prevent unnecessary lookups, thereby
improving efficiency for both loaded and unloaded dynamic libraries.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Refactor of <code>dlupdate</code>
Function</strong><strong>PR</strong>:
<a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/110491">#110491</a>
</p>
<p>
This update simplifies the <code>dlupdate</code> function by removing
the <code>mode</code> argument, streamlining the function’s interface.
The change enhances the clarity and usability of <code>dlupdate</code>
by reducing unnecessary parameters, improving the overall
maintainability of the code.

involves exploring options for an automatic process to restart the
executor in the event of a crash.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Finalize Auto Library Loading in ORC JIT :</strong>Wrap up the
feature that automatically loads libraries in ORC JIT. This will
streamline symbol resolution for both loaded and unloaded dynamic

definitions are loaded as needed.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">
Conclusion
</h2>
<p>
With this project, <strong>Clang-Repl</strong> now supports
<strong>out-of-process execution</strong> for both <code>ELF</code> and
<code>Mach-O</code>, making it much more efficient and stable,
especially on devices with limited resources.
</p>
<p>
In the future, I plan to work on automating library loading and
improving ORC-JIT to make Clang-Repl’s out-of-process execution even
better.
