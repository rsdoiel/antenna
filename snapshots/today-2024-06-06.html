The Milk-V Meles is a Raspberry Pi-like single-board computer with a
similar credit card-sized design featuring a decent number of full-sized
ports as well as a 40-pin GPIO connector and MIPI-CSI and MIPI-DSIC
connectors. But while Raspberry Pi’s little computers feature ARM-based
processors, the Milk-V Meles is powered by a quad-core RISC-V processor.

id="jurors-in-hunter-biden-trial-hear-more-from-clerk-who-sold-him-gun-at-center-of-case">Jurors
in Hunter Biden trial hear more from clerk who sold him gun at center of
case</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WILMINGTON, Delaware — Jurors at Hunter Biden’s criminal trial heard
more Thursday from the former gun store clerk who sold him the
.38-caliber Colt revolver at the center of the case. </p>
<p>The clerk testified Wednesday that he watched as President Joe
Biden’s son checked off “no” to the question of whether he was “an
unlawful user of or addicted to” marijuana, stimulants, narcotics or any
other controlled substance. </p>
<p>Federal prosecutors have argued Hunter Biden was in the throes of a
heavy crack addiction when he bought the gun, and they’ve accused him of
lying on the form. He’s been charged with three felonies: lying to a
federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application
by saying he was not a drug user, and illegally having the gun for 11
days. </p>
<p>The Democratic president’s son arrived at court Thursday with a copy
of his memoir, “Beautiful Things,” tucked under his arm. The book,
written after he got sober in 2021, figures heavily into prosecutors’
case: They’ve played audio excerpts for jurors in which he details his
descent into drugs and alcohol following the death of his brother, Beau,
in 2015. </p>
<p>Hunter Biden, who has pleaded not guilty, has said the Justice
Department is bending to political pressure from Republicans and that
he’s being wrongly targeted. </p>
<p>Jurors have been shown as evidence Form 4473, the firearms
transaction record in question, and on Wednesday, they saw the gun that
was purchased. </p>
<p>Gordon Cleveland, the former clerk at StarQuest Shooters &amp;
Survival Supply, told jurors he walked Hunter Biden through a few
options before he settled on the $900 gun, and he watched Biden sign the
form, which includes a warning about the consequences of submitting
false information. </p>
<p>“Everything he bought, he ultimately decided on,” he told
jurors. </p>
<p>In his cross-examination Thursday, defense attorney Abbe Lowell
pointed out that some of the questions on the form are in the present
tense, such as “are you an unlawful user of or addicted to” drugs. He
has suggested Hunter Biden did not believe he had an active drug
problem. </p>
<p>Other questions are in the past tense, such as asking the potential
gun buyer whether he or she has ever been discharged from the military
or been adjudicated as a mental defective. </p>
<p>Much of the prosecution’s case so far has been dedicated to
highlighting the seriousness of his crack addiction and showcasing to
jurors bare-chested moments with ex-girlfriends, infidelity, crack pipes
— judgment lapses they believe prove he was actively using when he
checked off no. Prosecutors argue it’s necessary evidence to show his
state of mind when he bought the gun. </p>
<p>The proceedings are unfolding after the collapse of a plea deal that
would have resolved the gun charge and a separate tax case, and spared
the Biden family the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election.
First lady Jill Biden spent several days in court before joining
President Joe Biden in France for the D-Day anniversary. Allies worry
about the toll the proceedings will take on the president, who is deeply
concerned about the health and sustained sobriety of his only living
son. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Hunter Biden’s friends and family are being called to
testify. </p>
<p>Kathleen Buhle, who was married to Hunter Biden for 20 years, told
jurors Wednesday that she discovered her husband was using drugs when
she found a crack pipe in an ashtray on their porch on July 3, 2015, a
day after their anniversary. When she confronted him, “he acknowledged
smoking crack,” she said. </p>
<p>Buhle testified that even before she found the drugs, she suspected
he was using. He had been kicked out of the Navy after testing positive
for cocaine. </p>
<p>“I was definitely worried, scared,” she said. They have three
children and divorced in 2016 after his infidelity and drug abuse became
too much, according to her memoir, “If We Break,” about the dissolution
of their marriage. </p>
<p>Buhle, who was subpoenaed, was on the stand for a brief 20 minutes.
She remained composed but seemed upset as she recounted how she searched
his car about a dozen times for drugs, whenever the children were
driving it. </p>
<p>“Did you ever see Hunter using drugs?” Lowell asked Buhle. </p>
<p>“No,” she replied. </p>
<p>Then prosecutor Leo Wise asked Buhle how she knew Hunter Biden was
using drugs. </p>
<p>“He told me,” she said. </p>
<p>Prosecutors also called Zoe Kestan, who testified under immunity
about meeting Hunter Biden in December 2017 at a strip club in New York
where she worked. During a private session, he pulled out a pipe and
began smoking what she assumed was crack. </p>
<p>“He was incredibly charming and charismatic and friendly, and I felt
really safe around him,” she said. “I remember after he had smoked it,
nothing had changed. He was the same charming person.” </p>
<p>Kestan detailed for jurors when she saw him use drugs, buy drugs,
talk about drugs or possess drug paraphernalia. Prosecutors asked her
where he stored his drugs and pipes, and she testified he kept them in
pouches and other places, such as sunglasses cases. </p>
<p>On cross-examination, Kestan acknowledged that she had no contact
with him in October 2018, the period when he bought the gun. </p>
<p>Prosecutors have also used his own words as evidence through his
memoir and text messages he sent to friends and family. The memoir
covers the period he bought the gun, though it doesn’t mention the
weapon specifically. </p>
<p>Lowell has said Hunter Biden’s state of mind was different when he
wrote the book than when he purchased the gun, when he didn’t believe he
had an addiction. And he’s suggested Hunter Biden might have felt he had
a drinking problem at the time, but not a drug problem. Alcohol abuse
doesn’t preclude a gun purchase. </p>
<p>If convicted, Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison, though
first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it’s
unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars. </p>
<p>He’s also facing a separate trial in September on charges of failing
to pay $1.4 million in taxes. </p>
<p>In Congress, Republicans have for months pursued an impeachment
inquiry seeking to tie President Biden to his son’s business dealings.
So far, GOP lawmakers have failed to uncover evidence directly
implicating President Biden in any wrongdoing. But on Wednesday, House
Republicans accused Hunter Biden and the president’s brother James Biden
of making false statements to Congress as part of the inquiry. </p>
<p>The trial is unfolding shortly after Donald Trump, the presumptive
Republican presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New
York City. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity
underscores how the courts have taken center stage during the 2024
campaign.</p>

<p>date: 2024-06-06, from: OS News</p>
<p>As some of you will know, I recently started working on OSNews as my
full-time job, and that means I sometimes need to be annoying and remind
you all that I need your help in keeping the website going. Ad income
has been going down the drain for years and years now, so your support
is crucial in keeping OSNews online. We’ve been providing you with the
latest technology news for over 25 years now, and I’d really like to
keep things going for another 25 years. So, how can you help? You can
become an OSNews Patreon, which will remove ads from OSNews, and give
you a little bit of flair on every comment you post to show off that you
support us. We offer three pricing tiers with an increasing level of
prominence for your flair, with the highest tier giving you the option
of choosing your own flair to really show off to your fellow readers and
commenters that you are just a little bit more equal than everyone else.
You can also make individual donations through Ko-Fi. Since I really
need to replace the monitor of my OSNews workstation – after eight years
of loyal use, the cheap monitor is started to show ghosting and
flickering, and I feel like it could give out at any moment – I’ve set a
goal on Ko-Fi for this very purpose. I don’t expect this goal to be met
any time soon, but it’s a nice target to aim for and look forward to. I
intend to replace the old 4K display with the cheapest 4K/144Hz panel I
can find here in Sweden, but since that will most likely be unrealistic
price-wise, the goal is rooted more in aspiration than reality. There
are other ways to support us too – you can make a donation through
Liberapay, or go to our merch store and buy T-shirts, mugs, and other
cool items. The ultimate goal that I’m working towards is to eventually
be able to offer ad-free by default, fully supported by you, our
generous readers. This is a long-term goal and not something we’ll
achieve overnight, but I want to maintain OSNews’ independence at all
costs. Virtually every other technology news site you visit is part of a
major media empire, such as The Verge or Ars Technica, with huge amounts
of staff and massive funds backing them – and all the questionable
relationships between writers and the technology companies that entails.
Add to it the rise of artificial intelligence and the negative
consequences that’s going to have, and the need for independent,
reader-funded technology websites is greater than ever. That being said,
we will not be gating content behind paywalls, so even if you cannot or
are unwilling to support us, you will still get all the same content as
everyone else. As such, supporting OSNews financially is entirely
optional, and will not degrade your experience in any way. Still,
OSNews’ continued existence is entirely dependent on me being able to
generate enough income through it, so while you do not have to support
us, it’s definitely needed.</p>

<h2 id="biden-on-d-day-west-wont-abandon-ukraine">Biden on D-Day: West
won’t abandon Ukraine</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>COLLEVILLE-SUR-MER, FRANCE — U.S. President Joe Biden on Thursday
marked the solemnity of the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landing of
Allied troops on the shores of Normandy by vowing that the United States
and NATO would not abandon support for Ukraine in its fight against
Russia’s two-year invasion.</p>
<p>Speaking in Colleville-sur-Mer, France, Biden said “we will not walk
away” from Ukraine’s defense and “surrender to bullies.”</p>
<p>The U.S. leader said Ukraine was invaded by Russian President
Vladimir Putin, a “tyrant intent on domination,” and that democracy is
now more at risk than at any point since World War II.</p>
<p>“Make no mistake, we will not bow down, we cannot surrender to the
bullies, it is simply unthinkable. If we do, freedom will be subjugated,
all Europe will be threatened,” he said in offering wide support for the
global world order that emerged in the aftermath of World War II.</p>
<p>“To surrender to bullies, to bow down to dictators, is simply
unthinkable,” he said during a ceremony at the American cemetery in
Normandy. “If we were to do that, it means we’d be forgetting what
happened here on these hallowed beaches.”</p>
<p>D-Day was the largest amphibious assault in history, and Biden called
it a “powerful illustration of how alliances, real alliances make us
stronger.”</p>
<p>He said that was “a lesson that I pray we Americans never
forget.”</p>
<p>Biden greeted World War II veterans who participated in the D-Day
landings, including many in wheelchairs and some who are more than 100
years old.</p>
<p>“You saved the world,” Biden told one veteran. He greeted each
veteran one by one, offering a salute or a handshake, and handing them a
special coin he had designed for the occasion.</p>
<p>Biden’s appearance came in the midst of his 2024 reelection campaign
for the presidency against Republican Donald Trump, who spoke at the
75th anniversary of D-Day five years ago.</p>
<p>Trump, who has often questioned the necessity of the U.S. commitment
to NATO, the West’s main military alliance, hailed the soldiers who
stormed the beaches of Normandy in his 2019 speech but did not praise
the global alliances that emerged after the war.</p>
<p>Trump has often attacked European members of NATO who do not spend
the equivalent of 2% of their national economic output on defense, a
NATO-suggested level for defense of their own countries.</p>
<p>Biden has cited his administration’s record of building global
alliances as a key accomplishment. He recently told Time magazine that
Trump “wanted to just abandon” U.S. allies and suggested the former
president would ultimately pull the country out of NATO if he is
elected.</p>

id="spacexs-mega-rocket-completes-its-fourth-test-flight-from-texas-without-exploding">SpaceX’s
mega rocket completes its fourth test flight from Texas without
exploding</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Boca Chica, Texas — SpaceX’s mega Starship rocket completed its first
full test flight Thursday, returning to Earth without exploding after
blasting off from Texas. </p>
<p>The previous three test flights ended in explosions of the rocket and
the spacecraft. This time, both managed to splash down in a controlled
fashion. </p>
<p>The world’s largest and most powerful rocket — almost 121 meters tall
— was empty as it soared above the Gulf of Mexico and headed east on a
flight to the Indian Ocean. </p>
<p>Minutes after Thursday morning’s liftoff, the first-stage booster
separated from the spacecraft and splashed into the gulf precisely as
planned, after firing its engines. </p>
<p>An hour later, live views showed parts of the spacecraft breaking
away during the intense heat of reentry, but it remained intact enough
to transmit data all the way to its targeted splashdown site in the
Indian Ocean. </p>
<p>“And we have splashdown!” SpaceX launch commentator Kate Tice
announced from Mission Control at company headquarters in
California. </p>
<p>It was a critical milestone in the company’s plan to eventually
return Starship’s Super Heavy booster to its launch site for reuse. </p>
<p>SpaceX came close to avoiding explosion in March, but lost contact
with the spacecraft as it careened out of space and blew up short of its
goal. The booster also ruptured in flight, a quarter-mile above the
gulf. </p>
<p>Last year’s two test flights ended in explosions shortly after
blasting off from the southern tip of Texas near the Mexican border. The
first one cratered the pad at Boca Chica Beach and hurled debris for
thousands of feet (meters). </p>
<p>SpaceX upgraded the software and made some rocket-flyback changes to
improve the odds. The Federal Aviation Administration signed off Tuesday
on this fourth demo, saying all safety requirements had been met. </p>
<p>Starship is designed to be fully reusable. That’s why SpaceX wants to
control the booster’s entry into the gulf and the spacecraft’s descent
into the Indian Ocean — it’s intended as practice for planned future
landings. Nothing is being recovered from Thursday’s flight. </p>
<p>NASA has ordered a pair of Starships for two moon-landing missions by
astronauts, on tap for later this decade. Each moon crew will rely on
NASA’s own rocket and capsule to leave Earth, but meet up with Starship
in lunar orbit for the ride down to the surface. </p>
<p>SpaceX already is selling tourist trips around the moon. The first
private lunar customer, a Japanese tycoon, pulled out of the trip with
his entourage last week, citing the oft-delayed schedule. </p>
<p>SpaceX’s founder and CEO has grander plans: Musk envisions fleets of
Starships launching people and the infrastructure necessary to build a
city on Mars.</p>

<h2 id="theyre-putting-ai-in-your-bios">They’re putting “AI” in your
BIOS</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-06, from: OS News</p>
<p>You know what could really use a dose of “AI”? Your BIOS. aiBIOS
leverages an LLM to integrate AI capabilities into Insyde Software’s
flagship firmware solution, InsydeH2O® UEFI BIOS. It provides the
ability to interpret the PC user’s request, analyze their specific
hardware, and parse through the LLM’s extensive knowledge base of BIOS
and computer terminology to make the appropriate changes to the BIOS
Setup. This breakthrough technology helps address a major hurdle for PC
users that require or desire changes to their BIOS Setup for their
personal computers but do not fully understand the meaning of the
settings available to them. ↫ Insyde press release Google told users to
put glue on pizzas and eat rocks, so I’m sure the combined efforts of a
BIOS maker will surely not pose any problems when automatically changing
BIOS settings based on the requests of users who do not really
understand what they’re doing. This surely is a recipe for success, and
I can’t wait to tell my BIOS to enable XMP, only for it to disable
hyperthreading, change the boot order to only allow booting from the
non-existent floppy drive, and to force the use of the integrated GPU
when I’m actually using a dedicated one. This is going to be just
fine.</p>

id="windows-recall-demands-an-extraordinary-level-of-trust-that-microsoft-hasnt-earned">Windows
Recall demands an extraordinary level of trust that Microsoft hasn’t
earned</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-06, from: OS News</p>
<p>The short version is this: In its current form, Recall takes
screenshots and uses OCR to grab the information on your screen; it then
writes the contents of windows plus records of different user
interactions in a locally stored SQLite database to track your activity.
Data is stored on a per-app basis, presumably to make it easier for
Microsoft’s app-exclusion feature to work. Beaumont says “several days”
of data amounted to a database around 90KB in size. In our usage,
screenshots taken by Recall on a PC with a 2560×1440 screen come in at
500KB or 600KB apiece (Recall saves screenshots at your PC’s native
resolution, minus the taskbar area). Recall works locally thanks to
Azure AI code that runs on your device, and it works without Internet
connectivity and without a Microsoft account. Data is encrypted at rest,
sort of, at least insofar as your entire drive is generally encrypted
when your PC is either signed into a Microsoft account or has Bitlocker
turned on. But in its current form, Beaumont says Recall has “gaps you
can drive a plane through” that make it trivially easy to grab and scan
through a user’s Recall database if you either (1) have local access to
the machine and can log into any account (not just the account of the
user whose database you’re trying to see), or (2) are using a PC
infected with some kind of info-stealer virus that can quickly transfer
the SQLite database to another system. ↫ Andrew Cunningham at Ars
Technica It really does seem Recall is kind of a mess in the security
department, and it has a certain rushed quality about it. All the
screenshots are saved in an AppData folder, and data pulled from those
screenshots is stored in a local SQLite database that happens to be
entirely unencrypted. TotalRecall, a tool developed by Alexander
Hagenah, will neatly pull the data from Recall for you without any
hassle or issues. This truly is a security nightmare. Aside from all the
obvious issues this presents, such as making it even easier for law
enforcement to gain access to pretty much everything you do online,
something especially troubling for minorities or in countries with
less-than-stellar police departments, Recall also presents a whole host
of other problems. Imagine being in an abusive relationship, and the
abusive partner demanding Recall be left on at all times to exert even
more control. Imagine an unscrupulous employee abusing Recall to steal
sensitive information from a company for a competitor. Imagine living in
some backwards part of a country with controlling religious parents, and
you happen to be gay. The problems here are endless. The fact you can
turn Recall off doesn’t mean much, since in the above examples, turning
it off is not an option since there are controlling people involved who
will demand you keep it on. Browser history and other forms of history
in your computer exist as well, of course, but they’re not always as
easy to parse, they’re easier to manipulate, sanitise, and temporarily
hide. Recall just combines all of this and puts a neat little bow on it,
ready to be abused by anyone with bad intentions. Recall is
ill-conceived, badly implemented, and a solution looking for a problem,
that in an of itself creates tons of other problems. I hope Microsoft
reconsiders, but in a world where “AI” makes investors go nuts, I doubt
we’ll see a sudden sense of clarity coming out of Redmond.</p>

pause”</a> the long-awaited NYC congestion pricing program that was set
to start on June 30. The policy would have charged drivers for entering
some of the city’s busiest areas, raising $1 billion annually for the
transit authority, cutting pollution, and easing traffic congestion. It
would have been the first such program in the nation. But, no more.
Hochul said it risked “too many unintended consequences.”
</p>
<p>
Environmental groups, state budget hawks, and transit advocates are
outraged by the u-turn. Her decision “will be a generational setback for
climate policy in the United States,”

an incensed Robinson Meyer for Heatmap</a>. “New York was bushwhacking a
trail for everyone else to follow: If congestion policy was a success
there, then other American cities could experiment with it in some form.
By pausing that trial before it has even begun, Hochul has essentially
frozen our ability to experiment with congestion pricing anywhere else
in the country.”

<span></span>2. IEA: Clean energy investment set to double fossil fuels

Global investment in clean energy is on track to reach $2 trillion in
2024, double the $1 trillion expected to be invested in fossil fuels,
according to the International Energy Agency. In its new

renewables surpassed the amount invested in fossil fuels last year for
the first time. Most of the money is going toward solar power. Here’s a
look at recent annual investment in solar PV (light blue) compared to

<p>
China accounts for the largest share of clean energy investment by a
long shot, and China, the U.S., and Europe make up more than two thirds
of the world’s clean energy investment. “More must be done to ensure
that investment reaches the places where it is needed most, in
particular the developing economies where access to affordable,
sustainable and secure energy is severely lacking today,” said IEA
Executive Director Fatih Birol. Even as clean energy funds are flowing,
spending on oil and gas is set to rise this year and remains far too
high to meet the world’s climate goals, the report said. Just 4% of oil
and gas companies’ 2023 investments went toward clean energy.

speech</a> at the American Museum of Natural History. The UN
secretary-general called the fossil fuel industry “the Godfathers of
climate chaos,” and said advertising and PR agencies that take Big Oil
on as clients are “enablers to planetary destruction.” He said the end
of the fossil fuel age was an economic inevitability, but that global
emissions need to fall 9% every year until 2030 to keep the goal of
limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius alive. The next 18 months
will be key to deciding our future, he said. “I call on leaders in the
fossil fuel industry to understand that if you are not in the fast lane
to clean energy transformation, you are driving your business into a
dead end – and taking us all with you,” Guterres said.

<p>
The speech coincided with a new

80% chance that the global annual average temperature will exceed the
1.5C degree increase in one (or more) of the next five years. That’s up
from a 66% chance last year, and as Guterres noted, “in 2015, the chance
of such a breach was near zero.”

<p class="drop-caps">
The urgent need to build transmission infrastructure at dramatic pace,
scale, and geographic scope is clear. To decarbonize the power sector,
we’ll have to physically rebuild the grid once-over in the coming
decades to connect and facilitate a hopeful explosion in new renewable
generation capacity across our continental country. We will have to
accomplish this as electricity demand grows, including on account of
decarbonizing sectors such as buildings, transportation, and industrial
production through electrification. Given the stakes of grid balancing,
this task is akin to building and starting to operate a new beating
heart and wider cardiovascular system, all while keeping the old one
from failing amid surgery. Coordination and proactive planning of grid
buildout will be key.
</p>
<p>
Despite the undeniable public benefits, investment in the grid has been
stagnating, if not declining. A Department of Energy
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/gdo/national-transmission-needs-study" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>study</u></a>
found that annual net investment in the grid, as measured by new miles
of line, was actually negative on average between 2016 and 2020. Some
have faulted the National Environmental Policy Act for this
underinvestment, while others have blamed anti-social NIMBYs, both of
which, but especially combined, can thwart projects at the permitting
stage.
</p>
<p>
The reality is more complicated and implicates the basic governance of
the transmission system. The grid in the United States is owned,
operated, and planned largely by a highly fragmented set of privately
owned utilities and, in some places, their
<a href="https://www.ferc.gov/electric-power-markets" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>nonprofit
associations</u></a>, which are regulated at the federal and state
level. Transmission owners do not propose and build transmission lines
unless they are profitable for their business, which is not guaranteed
most of the time. Indeed, new lines can cost transmission owners profits
by creating a larger pool of power supply and reducing the energy sales
and pricing power of their generation affiliates.
</p>
<p>
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has repeatedly attempted to
prod utilities to do more by mandating regional planning procedures.
FERC announced its latest regulatory initiative, called
<a href="https://ferc.gov/news-events/news/fact-sheet-building-future-through-electric-regional-transmission-planning-and" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Order
1920</u></a>, last month, and it requires transmission owners to
undertake long-range regional planning that considers an array of public
benefits, including lower energy prices and enhanced system reliability.
In particular, the rule alleviates disputes over investment cost
allocation. But stronger planning procedures can hardly ensure that
private utilities will actually invest in needed lines. Indeed, FERC’s
<a href="https://www.ferc.gov/sites/default/files/2020-06/OrderNo.890.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>serial</u></a>
<a href="https://www.ferc.gov/electric-transmission/order-no-1000-transmission-planning-and-cost-allocation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>attempts</u></a>
on this front have so far been a failure.
</p>
<p>
As this FERC activity suggests, the grid is already subject to great
public regulation, but this regulatory architecture still falls well
short of the public control necessary to treat the grid as a vital
common resource whose transformation must be proactively planned and
precisely delivered at the system-level. Through public planning and
development, we can overcome this structural fragmentation and
counteract private utilities’ low propensity to investment across the
transmission system. We need a centralized system of public planning,
funding, and construction of transmission facilities. We need to
nationalize the grid.
</p>
<p>
The benefits of grid expansion are manifold and go well beyond just the
functionality of decarbonization. More connections between states and
regions can lower the price of electricity and improve reliability,
which will become an increasingly pressing issue in the face of further
climate destabilization. And yet our transmission system consists of
regional and subregional grids “that operate like jealous petty
potentates, resisting stronger links that would allow renewable energy
to flow across regional boundaries,” in the words of the <em><em>New
York Times</em></em>
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/04/opinion/nepa-permitting-reform.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>editorial
board</u></a>. Projects founder over disputes between utilities over how
to distribute costs, while other necessary new additions are never
proposed in the first place. This is a structural problem that leads to
quantitative underinvestment and qualitative poor coordination of
investment across the balkanized system.
</p>
<p>
The public pays for investments in the electricity system, whether
through taxes or consumer electricity bills in monopoly serviced systems
down the line. Public investment in critical infrastructure is cheaper
for the public than private investment due to the lower costs of debt
financing or direct access to the U.S. Treasury for public agencies.
These entities are also free from the imperative to maximize shareholder
returns and pay dividends. Public investment is more flexible and can
adopt a system-wide approach, as opposed to one blinkered at the level
of the project. Instead of piecemeal line extensions, the grid can be
expanded in a methodical and holistic fashion in accordance with social
need.
</p>
<p>
Public power is firmly established in the United States. Public agencies
such as the federal
<a href="https://www.tva.com/energy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Tennessee
Valley Authority</u></a> and state-owned
<a href="https://www.nypa.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>New
York Power Authority</u></a> generate and transmit power. In nearly the
entire contiguous United States west of the Mississippi River, three
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=11651" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>federal
power administrations</u></a> own transmission lines and
<a href="https://usc-cdn.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title16/chapter12B&edition=prelim" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>can</u></a>
<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/16421" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>construct</u></a>
new ones. Congress should set up and fund federal authorities across the
country to build the power grid we desperately need, coordinating with
each other and through federal level planning, and working with, and
when needed against, the current assemblage of private utilities.
</p>
<p>
The Bonneville Power Administration in the Pacific Northwest offers a
good model of governance. It is led by a single administrator appointed
by the Secretary of Energy. This official has the broad authority to set
rates on wholesale power and transmission and develop the regional grid.
But these important decisions can only be made after
<a href="https://usc-cdn.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title16/chapter12H&edition=prelim" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>close
consultation</u></a> with retail and wholesale customers, Native
American tribes, elected officials, and environmental groups and are
reviewed by FERC. This system ensures efficient, publicly accountable
management of the grid.
</p>
<p>
Given the tight timeline we face to deliver on critical decarbonization
pillars, one might ask, why experiment with a publicly led approach? We
might stoke private utility backlash and weaken or slow the broader
project of cleaning up the power supply. But private utilities have had
decades to deliver a modern grid and failed. Because of the pressing
need to decarbonize and fortify resilience against entrenched climate
instability, the necessity of building state capacity is a sober
reality. We cannot begin to build necessary state capacity without first
acknowledging this necessity and acting in light of it.
</p>
<p>
North America’s power grid is called the
“<a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262537407/the-grid/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">world’s
largest machine</a>” because it is a complex physical infrastructure
that must be in perfect balance every second. Our homes, places of work
and leisure, and increasingly vehicles are all plugged into the grid.
Preserving modern living standards—and an inhabitable planet—requires
expanding and rationally operating this common resource. This social
undertaking is too important to be entrusted to private corporations.

id="costs-of-world-war-ii-ukraine-war-fuse-as-allies-remember-d-day-without-russia">Costs
of World War II, Ukraine war fuse as Allies remember D-Day without
Russia</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>UTAH BEACH, France — As the sun sets on the D-Day generation, it will
rise again Thursday over the Normandy beaches where the waves long ago
washed away the blood and boot-steps of its soldiers, but where their
exploits that helped end Adolf Hitler’s tyranny are being remembered by
the next generations, seeing war again in Europe, in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Ever-dwindling numbers of World War II veterans who have pilgrimaged
back to France, and Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine that has
dashed hopes that lives and cities wouldn’t again be laid to waste in
Europe, are making the always poignant anniversaries of the June 6,
1944, Allied landings even more so 80 years on.</p>
<p>As now-centenarian veterans revisit old memories and fallen comrades
buried in Normandy graves, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s
presence at D-Day commemorations with world leaders — including U.S.
President Joe Biden — who are supporting his country’s fight against
Russia’s invasion will inevitably fuse together World War II’s awful
past with the fraught present on Thursday.</p>
<p>The break of dawn almost eight decades exactly after Allied troops
waded ashore under hails of gunfire on five code-named beaches — Utah,
Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword — will kick off a day of remembrance by
Allied nations now standing together again behind Ukraine — and with
World War II ally Russia not invited by host France. It cited Russia’s
“war of aggression against Ukraine that has intensified in recent weeks”
for the snub.</p>
<p>With the dead and wounded on both sides in Ukraine estimated in the
hundreds of thousands, commemorations for the more than 4,400 Allied
dead on D-Day and many tens of thousands more, including French
civilians, killed in the ensuing Battle of Normandy are tinged with
concerns that World War II lessons are being lost.</p>
<p>“There are things worth fighting for,” said World War II veteran
Walter Stitt, who fought in tanks and turns 100 in July, as he visited
Omaha Beach this week. “Although I wish there was another way to do it
than to try to kill each other.”</p>
<p>“We’ll learn one of these days, but I won’t be around for that,” he
said.</p>
<p>Conscious of the inevitability that major D-Day anniversaries will
soon take place without World War II veterans, huge throngs of
aficionados in uniforms and riding vehicles of the time, and tourists
soaking up the spectacle, have flooded Normandy for the 80th
anniversary.</p>
<p>The fair-like atmosphere fueled by World War II-era jeeps and trucks
tearing down hedge-rowed lanes so deadly for Allied troops who fought
dug-in German defenders, and of reenactors playing at war on sands where
D-Day soldiers fell, leave open the question of what meaning
anniversaries will have once the veterans are gone.</p>
<p>But at the 80th, they’re the VIPs of commemorations across the
Normandy coast where the largest-ever land, sea and air armada punctured
Hitler’s defenses in Western Europe and helped precipitate his downfall
11 months later.</p>
<p>Those who traveled to Normandy include women who were among the
millions who built bombers, tanks and other weaponry and played other
vital World War II roles that were long overshadowed by the combat
exploits of men.</p>
<p>“We weren’t doing it for honors and awards. We were doing it to save
our country. And we ended up helping save the world,” said 98-year-old
Anna Mae Krier, who worked as a riveter building B-17 and B-29
bombers.</p>
<p>Feted wherever they go in wheelchairs and walking with canes,
veterans are using their voices to repeat their message they hope will
live eternal: Never forget.</p>
<p>“To know the amount of people who were killed here, just amazing,”
98-year-old Allan Chatwin, who served with the U.S. Navy in the Pacific,
said as he visited Omaha, the deadliest of the Allied beaches on
D-Day.</p>
<p>He quickly added: “I don’t know that amazing is the word.”</p>

id="democratic-contraception-access-bill-fails-in-us-senate">Democratic
contraception access bill fails in US Senate</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — A bill to safeguard access to contraceptives failed to
advance in a U.S. Senate vote on Wednesday, after congressional
Democrats forced the vote in a bid to focus public attention on
reproductive rights ahead of the November election. </p>
<p>The Right to Contraception Act, which would protect birth control
access nationwide, got 51 votes in support and 39 against, but fell
short of the chamber’s 60-vote threshold for advancing to a full
debate. </p>
<p>The fight over reproductive rights is a flashpoint in U.S. politics,
especially since the Supreme Court’s 2022 decision to overturn Roe v.
Wade, the decision that had recognized a national right to abortion
access.  </p>
<p>Last month, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump came under
fire after comments that political rivals said suggested he would
consider banning birth control, leading him to respond publicly that he
would not support such a move. </p>
<p>Top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer on Wednesday pointed to several
states, including Nevada and Virginia, where Republican governors have
vetoed efforts to protect legal access to contraception, saying that
showed a need for federal legislation. </p>
<p>“We are kidding ourselves if we think the hard right will stop at
overturning Roe,” he said. </p>
<p>Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives said they would
attempt a legislative maneuver to force a vote on the same bill, though
they faced slim chance of success in the Republican-controlled
chamber. </p>
<p>“Republicans have a choice to make: They can put aside their MAGA
ideology and join us [to] get this bill passed, or they can triple down
on their anti-freedom extremism in full view of the American people,”
House Democrat Katherine Clark said on Tuesday. </p>
<p>Republican Representative Marc Molinaro, who won his district in 2022
by just 1.6%, said on Wednesday that he would cosponsor the legislation,
the first Republican to do so. </p>
<p>Some Senate Republicans criticized the push. </p>
<p>“It’s an election year in which a Democratic incumbent president is
running behind, so a decision has been made to raise abortion to a high
profile,” said Republican Senator Bill Cassidy, referring to President
Joe Biden. “You can’t normalize a procedure where the intent is to end a
life.” </p>
<p>In a May Reuters/Ipsos survey of 3,934 U.S. residents 18 and older,
37% said Biden has a better approach to abortion, compared to 27% who
said the same about Trump. </p>
<p>Schumer said Democrats would also vote on a bill next week to protect
in vitro fertilization, which Senate Republicans previously voted
against after an Alabama court made the fertility treatment used by
millions of Americans to conceive effectively illegal in the state.</p>

House Republicans issue criminal referrals against Biden’s son,
brother</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — U.S. House Republicans issued criminal referrals
Wednesday against President Joe Biden’s son and brother, accusing them
of making false statements to Congress as part of the Republicans’
yearlong impeachment inquiry. </p>
<p>The Republican leaders of the House Oversight and Accountability,
Judiciary and Ways and Means committees sent a letter to the Justice
Department recommending the prosecution of Hunter Biden and James Biden
and accusing them of making a “conscious effort” to undermine the
House’s investigation. </p>
<p>Abbe Lowell, Hunter Biden’s attorney, said in a statement that the
referrals are “nothing more than a desperate attempt by Republicans to
twist Hunter’s testimony so they can distract from their failed
impeachment inquiry and interfere with his trial.” </p>
<p>James Biden ’s lawyer, Paul Fishman, echoed that sentiment, calling
it a “baseless partisan action,” and reiterated that his client has
“always maintained that Joe Biden never had any involvement in his
business dealings.” </p>
<p>Accused of lying to gun dealer</p>
<p>The referrals to Attorney General Merrick Garland and special counsel
David Weiss add to the legal challenges facing Hunter Biden, who is now
on trial in a federal court in Delaware for three felony charges
stemming from the purchase of a gun in October 2018. The 54-year-old has
been accused by prosecutors of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer,
making a false claim on the application by saying he was not a drug user
and illegally having the gun for 11 days. </p>
<p>On Capitol Hill, the Republicans pursued their wide-ranging
investigation into Hunter Biden, separate from that federal case, are
trying to tie the Democratic president to his son’s business dealings.
Both Hunter and James Biden sat for hourslong interviews with lawmakers
even as they failed to uncover evidence directly implicating Joe Biden
in any wrongdoing. </p>
<p>Representative Jason Smith, chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee, said testimony from IRS whistleblowers shows that Hunter
Biden lied to Congress at least three times in his February 28
deposition. </p>
<p>“I think the Justice Department needs to look at that and act
accordingly. When you lie to Congress, that is a serious violation of
the law. It’s a felony,” said Smith. “The president’s son should not be
treated any differently than any other American.” </p>
<p>The Justice Department, which will ultimately decide whether to take
up the criminal referrals, declined to comment. </p>
<p>Inquiry becomes political liability</p>
<p>The focus on the Biden family resulting from Hunter Biden’s federal
trial and the impeachment inquiry has proved to be a political and
personal liability for the president. The proceedings are unfolding as
the 2024 White House election looms, and allies of Joe Biden worry about
the toll it will take on him. He is deeply concerned about the health
and sustained sobriety of his only living son. </p>
<p>Since former President Donald Trump’s conviction on charges in New
York, Republican leaders have assailed the Justice Department for what
they claim is a “two-tiered” system of justice that targets
conservatives. They play down the department’s current prosecution of
Hunter Biden and the fact that other prominent Democrats have faced
federal investigation during Joe Biden’s presidency. </p>
<p>House Speaker Mike Johnson said Wednesday that if Garland “wishes to
demonstrate he is not running a two-tiered system of justice and
targeting the president’s political opponents, he will open criminal
investigations into James and Hunter Biden,” under the false statements
and perjury statutes. </p>
<p>The false statements in question, according to the House committee
chairmen, include references Hunter Biden made about what position he
held at a corporate entity that received millions of dollars from

fictitious account” about text messages between him and his Chinese
business partner in which Hunter Biden allegedly invoked his father’s
presence with him as part of a negotiation tactic, according to the
Republican investigation. </p>
<p>There is also a focus on statements James Biden made about whether
the president, while a private citizen, met with a former Biden family
business partner. </p>
<p>House Democrats said Republicans are resorting to criminal referrals
because their impeachment push has effectively flamed out despite 17
months of investigating the Biden family. </p>
<p>“This agonizingly protracted and completely fruitless investigation
has proven only that President Biden was not part of, did not profit
from, and took no official actions to benefit his family members’
business ventures,” Representative Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the
Oversight Committee, said in a statement Wednesday.</p>

congratulates India’s Modi as US looks forward to more Indo-Pacific
cooperation</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — U.S. President Joe Biden on Wednesday congratulated
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his election victory, and
Washington said it looked forward to further cooperation with New Delhi
to ensure a free Indo-Pacific region.</p>
<p>“The friendship between our nations is only growing as we unlock a
shared future of unlimited potential,” Biden said in a posting on social
media platform X.</p>
<p>Modi, whose National Democratic Alliance retained power with a
surprisingly slim majority in voting results announced on Tuesday, said
he had received a call from Biden.</p>
<p>“[I] Conveyed that India-U.S. comprehensive global partnership is
poised to witness many new landmarks in the years to come. Our
partnership will continue to be a force for global good for the benefit
of humanity,” Modi said on X.</p>
<p>The United States and India have deepened ties in recent years given
shared concerns about China’s growing power, even though New Delhi has
maintained its long-standing relationship with Russia despite the war in
Ukraine, and human rights issues.</p>
<p>In a statement issued shortly after Biden’s congratulatory message,
the U.S. State Department said Washington looked forward “to continuing
to further our partnership with the Indian government to promote
prosperity and innovation, address the climate crisis, and ensure a free
and open Indo-Pacific region.”</p>
<p>State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller on Tuesday called the
U.S.-Indian relationship “a great partnership,” although the U.S. had
concerns about human rights, which it would continue to raise openly
with New Delhi.</p>
<p>Ties have been tested by the discovery of assassination plots against
Sikh nationalists in Canada and the United States. In November, U.S.
authorities said an Indian government official had directed the plot in
the attempted murder of Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a Sikh separatist and
dual citizen of the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>Last month, the U.S. ambassador to India said Washington was
satisfied so far with India’s moves to ensure accountability in the
alleged plots, but many steps were still needed and there must be
consequences for what was a “red line for America.”</p>
<p>Political analysts say Washington has been restrained in public
criticism of Modi because it hopes India will act as a counterweight to
an expansionist China.</p>

halts Trump’s Georgia election interference case while on appeal</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Atlanta — An appeals court has halted the Georgia election
interference case against former President Donald Trump and others while
it reviews the lower court judge’s ruling allowing Fulton County
District Attorney Fani Willis to remain on the case.</p>
<p>The Georgia Court of Appeals’ order on Wednesday prevents Fulton
County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee from moving forward with
pretrial motions as he had planned while the appeal is pending. While it
was already unlikely that the case would go to trial before the November
general election, when Trump is expected to be the Republican nominee
for president, this makes that even more certain.</p>
<p>The appeals court on Monday docketed the appeals filed by Trump and
eight others and said that “if oral argument is requested and granted”
it is tentatively scheduled for Oct. 4. The court will then have until
mid-March to rule, and the losing side will be able to appeal to the
Georgia Supreme Court.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Willis declined to comment on the appeals court
ruling.</p>
<p>A Fulton County grand jury in August indicted Trump and 18 others,
accusing them of participating in a sprawling scheme to illegally try to
overturn the 2020 presidential election in Georgia. Four defendants have
pleaded guilty after reaching deals with prosecutors, but Trump and the
others have pleaded not guilty. It is one of four criminal cases against
Trump.</p>
<p>Trump and eight other defendants had tried to get Willis and her
office removed from the case, arguing that a romantic relationship she
had with special prosecutor Nathan Wade created a conflict of interest.
McAfee in March found that no conflict of interest existed that should
force Willis off the case, but he granted a request from Trump and the
other defendants to seek an appeal of his ruling from the state Court of
Appeals.</p>
<p>McAfee wrote that “an odor of mendacity remains.” He said “reasonable
questions” over whether Willis and Wade had testified truthfully about
the timing of their relationship “further underpin the finding of an
appearance of impropriety and the need to make proportional efforts to
cure it.” He said Willis could remain on the case only if Wade left, and
the special prosecutor submitted his resignation hours later.</p>
<p>The allegations that Willis had improperly benefited from her romance
with Wade resulted in a tumultuous couple of months in the case as
intimate details of Willis and Wade’s personal lives were aired in court
in mid-February.</p>

Ideally it wouldn’t be an opt-in - I think this kind of bridge is

optional modern keybindings</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>GNU Nano, by far my favourite text editor when using the command
line, released version 8.0 recently – and by recently I mean a month ago
– and in it, there’s a pretty interesting additional feature that should
make using Nano a little bit more straightforward for those not used to
its key combinations. Command-line option –modernbindings (-/) makes ^Q
quit, ^X cut, ^C copy, ^V paste, ^Z undo, ^Y redo, ^O open a file, ^W
write a file, ^R replace, ^G find again, ^D find again backwards, ^A set
the mark, ^T jump to a line, ^P show the position, and ^E execute. ↫ GNU
Nano’s news page Basically, this option makes Nano’s key bindings a bit
more in line with what you might expect as someone coming from a
graphical environment. Of course, Nano’s keybindings are listed at the
bottom of its user interface, but it’s still nice to have the option of
making them more in line with the wider computing world. Instead of
using the command-line option, you can also change the name of Nano’s
executable, or a symlink to it, to start with “e”.</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
If it holds, then Governor Kathy Hochul’s decision today to delay
congestion pricing indefinitely in New York will be a generational
setback for climate policy in the United States.
</p>
<p>
It is one of the worst climate policy decisions made by a Democrat at
any level of government in recent memory.
</p>
<p>
It is worse than the Mountain Valley pipeline, the 300-mile gas pipeline
that Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia got approved in 2022 in
exchange for supporting the Inflation Reduction Act.
</p>
<p>
And it is worse than the Willow project in Alaska, the oil mega-project
that President Joe Biden
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/14/politics/willow-project-oil-alaska-explained-climate/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>okayed</u></a>
last year under pressure from that state’s local and indigenous leaders.
</p>
<p>
It is so bad because it will set back the development of
climate-friendly cities and rapid transit infrastructure in the United
States for years if not decades. And it will deter other American cities
from implementing the kind of time-saving, pollution-averting,
anti-gridlock measure that the country desperately needs.
</p>
<p>
There is nothing good to be said for this decision. It is bad politics,
bad economics, bad governance, and bad for the climate.
</p>
<p>
Let us briefly count the ways that it is destructive.
</p>
<p>
It is stupid coalition politics. Hochul has alienated her allies,
including environmental groups, state budget hawks, and transit
advocates. Bill McKibben, the longtime <em><em>New Yorker
</em></em>writer who has become one of the country’s most famous climate
activists,
<a href="https://x.com/billmckibben/status/1798422935570677816" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>called</u></a>
Hochul’s decision “one of the most aggressive anti-environmental actions
ever undertaken by a Democratic governor.”
</p>
<p>
In exchange, Hochul has delighted her Republican adversaries, who can
praise her wise decision-making in the weeks to come — and therefore
brandish their own bipartisan bonafides — but continue to campaign
against congestion pricing through November. Congestion pricing is
unpopular now, but in her fecklessness, Hochul has <em><em>guaranteed
</em></em>that it will be a live issue in November.
</p>
<p>
It is nonsense budget politics. Hochul says that she has delayed
congestion pricing because she is worried about the city’s recovery from
the pandemic, but regardless of her reasons, she has now left a $1
billion hole in the transit authority’s budget. <em><em>The New York
Times
</em></em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/nyregion/congestion-pricing-hochul-delayed.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reports</u></a>
that she wants to fill that hole by raising taxes on the state’s
businesses.
</p>
<p>
But that means that she has taken a tax formerly charged to <em><em>some
</em></em>New York residents and businesses — but which would also fall
on New Jersey and Connecticut residents and businesses — and shifted it
<em><em>entirely </em></em>to in-state entities. She has, in essence,
cut taxes on out-of-state residents and raised taxes on New York
businesses and consumers.
</p>
<p>
And instead of taxing
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/11/city-traffic-congestion-pricing-costs/675923/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
right to use roads in downtown Manhattan</u></a>, which are a limited
public resource, she will instead tax all business activity in the
state. What good will that do for New York’s economy?
</p>
<p>
Those political and financial flaws might be forgiven if her decision
was good for the planet. But don’t worry: It’s also bad climate
politics.
</p>
<p>
Cars, SUVs, and trucks belch more climate pollution into the atmosphere
than any other single economic activity in the U.S. Nearly 20% of
America’s annual carbon pollution
<a href="https://uh.edu/uh-energy/research/white-papers/white-papers-files/ghg-emissions-white-paper-draft-8.pdf#:~:text=The%20transportation%20sector%20as%20a%20whole%20comprises,approximately%2017%%20of%20total%20U.S.%20GHG%20emissions." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>comes
from</u></a> individuals and families driving their private vehicles
around on roads and highways. This is a far <em><em>larger</em></em>
share of national pollution than is generated by more famous climate
villains, such as air travel.
</p>
<p>
We have good ways of dealing with all that carbon pollution. In suburbs,
small towns, and rural America, the best way to deal with that tailpipe
pollution is to gradually transition from gasoline-burning cars to
electric vehicles. In some places, the country can also experiment with
using experimental, climate-friendly liquid fuels.
</p>
<p>
But in cities, people have better and cheaper options than getting EVs.
We can stop requiring people to drive everywhere and encourage them to
walk, bike, and take public transit instead. That will require, at
times, treating the use of <em><em>roads</em></em> in city centers as
the limited public resource that it is — which means charging cars and
trucks to enter the most crowded downtown areas of certain cities at
certain times of the day.
</p>
<p>
That’s what congestion pricing is: a way of encouraging cities to grow
in pro-climate, pro-environmental ways. Such a policy has already been
successfully implemented in London, Singapore, and other congested
cities. Even as a city-dwelling car owner, I long wanted the city where
I lived for a decade — Washington, D.C. — to adopt a similar policy.
After all, when Stockholm started its congestion fee, the rate of asthma
attacks among its children
<a href="https://hub.jhu.edu/2017/03/02/health-effects-for-children-sweden-traffic-tax/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>dropped
by half</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
So I looked forward to the start of congestion pricing in New York City,
America’s biggest, densest, and most transit-friendly city. New York was
bushwhacking a trail for everyone else to follow: If congestion policy
was a success there, then other American cities could experiment with it
in some form.
</p>
<p>
By pausing that trial before it has even begun, Hochul has essentially
frozen our ability to experiment with congestion pricing anywhere else
in the country. By shuttering the policy in New York, she has poisoned
pro-climate urban politics everywhere. Now people will say: <em><em>You
saw what happened when New York tried to do congestion pricing. Do you
really want to try that here? </em></em>
</p>
<p>
In the past, when national Democrats have approved new pipelines or oil
projects, they have argued that those projects will not affect the
country’s carbon pollution because only <em><em>demand </em></em>for
fossil fuels, and not the supply of them, drives carbon emissions. But
what makes congestion pricing so powerful is that demand is precisely
what it targets. Congestion pricing makes buses run faster, pays for the
subway system, and pushes people and businesses to consider the social
cost of their driving before they get in the car.
</p>
<p>
Congestion pricing, if implemented widely, can actually conserve fossil
fuels and cut carbon emissions. Now Hochul has halted its progress
everywhere.
</p>
<p>
She has made, in other words, a local mistake with national and even
global consequences. It is such a foolhardy error that it instantly
recasts Kathy Hochul’s climate record as governor.
</p>
<p>
Hochul has previously been seen as a center-left governor playing a
difficult but moderate environmental hand. But is that really her
record? She
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/new-yorks-offshore-wind-future-is-being-dragged-down-by-its-past" target="_self"><u>has</u></a>
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/new-york-offshore-wind-canceled" target="_self"><u>struggled</u></a>

counted. Hochul is just a loser.

Betrayal</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-05, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
If it holds, then Governor Kathy Hochul’s decision today to delay
congestion pricing indefinitely in New York will be a generational
setback for climate policy in the United States.
</p>
<p>
It is one of the worst climate policy decisions made by a Democrat at
any level of government in recent memory.
</p>
<p>
It is worse than the Mountain Valley pipeline, the 300-mile gas pipeline
that Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia got approved in 2022 in
exchange for supporting the Inflation Reduction Act.
</p>
<p>
And it is worse than the Willow project in Alaska, the oil mega-project
that President Joe Biden
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/14/politics/willow-project-oil-alaska-explained-climate/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>okayed</u></a>
last year under pressure from that state’s local and indigenous leaders.
</p>
<p>
It is so bad because it will set back the development of
climate-friendly cities and rapid transit infrastructure in the United
States for years if not decades. And it will deter other American cities
from implementing the kind of time-saving, pollution-averting,
anti-gridlock measure that the country desperately needs.
</p>
<p>
There is nothing good to be said for this decision. It is bad politics,
bad economics, bad governance, and bad for the climate.
</p>
<p>
Let us briefly count the ways that it is destructive.
</p>
<p>
It is stupid coalition politics. Hochul has alienated her allies,
including environmental groups, state budget hawks, and transit
advocates. Bill McKibben, the longtime <em><em>New Yorker
</em></em>writer who has become one of the country’s most famous climate
activists,
<a href="https://x.com/billmckibben/status/1798422935570677816" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>called</u></a>
Hochul’s decision “one of the most aggressive anti-environmental actions
ever undertaken by a Democratic governor.”
</p>
<p>
In exchange, Hochul has delighted her Republican adversaries, who can
praise her wise decision-making in the weeks to come — and therefore
brandish their own bipartisan bonafides — but continue to campaign
against congestion pricing through November. Congestion pricing is
unpopular now, but in her fecklessness, Hochul has <em><em>guaranteed
</em></em>that it will be a live issue in November.
</p>
<p>
It is nonsense budget politics. Hochul says that she has delayed
congestion pricing because she is worried about the city’s recovery from
the pandemic, but regardless of her reasons, she has now left a $1
billion hole in the transit authority’s budget. <em><em>The New York
Times
</em></em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/nyregion/congestion-pricing-hochul-delayed.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reports</u></a>
that she wants to fill that hole by raising taxes on the state’s
businesses.
</p>
<p>
But that means that she has taken a tax formerly charged to <em><em>some
</em></em>New York residents and businesses — but which would also fall
on New Jersey and Connecticut residents and businesses — and shifted it
<em><em>entirely </em></em>to in-state entities. She has, in essence,
cut taxes on out-of-state residents and raised taxes on New York
businesses and consumers.
</p>
<p>
And instead of taxing
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/11/city-traffic-congestion-pricing-costs/675923/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
right to use roads in downtown Manhattan</u></a>, which are a limited
public resource, she will instead tax all business activity in the
state. What good will that do for New York’s economy?
</p>
<p>
Those political and financial flaws might be forgiven if her decision
was good for the planet. But don’t worry: It’s also bad climate
politics.
</p>
<p>
Cars, SUVs, and trucks belch more climate pollution into the atmosphere
than any other single economic activity in the U.S. Nearly 20% of
America’s annual carbon pollution
<a href="https://uh.edu/uh-energy/research/white-papers/white-papers-files/ghg-emissions-white-paper-draft-8.pdf#:~:text=The%20transportation%20sector%20as%20a%20whole%20comprises,approximately%2017%%20of%20total%20U.S.%20GHG%20emissions." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>comes
from</u></a> individuals and families driving their private vehicles
around on roads and highways. This is a far <em><em>larger</em></em>
share of national pollution than is generated by more famous climate
villains, such as air travel.
</p>
<p>
We have good ways of dealing with all that carbon pollution. In suburbs,
small towns, and rural America, the best way to deal with that tailpipe
pollution is to gradually transition from gasoline-burning cars to
electric vehicles. In some places, the country can also experiment with
using experimental, climate-friendly liquid fuels.
</p>
<p>
But in cities, people have better and cheaper options than getting EVs.
We can stop requiring people to drive everywhere and encourage them to
walk, bike, and take public transit instead. That will require, at
times, treating the use of <em><em>roads</em></em> in city centers as
the limited public resource that it is — which means charging cars and
trucks to enter the most crowded downtown areas of certain cities at
certain times of the day.
</p>
<p>
That’s what congestion pricing is: a way of encouraging cities to grow
in pro-climate, pro-environmental ways. Such a policy has already been
successfully implemented in London, Singapore, and other congested
cities. Even as an urban car owner, I long wanted the city where I lived
for a decade — Washington, D.C. — to adopt a similar policy. After all,
when Stockholm started its congestion fee, the rate of asthma attacks
among its children
<a href="https://hub.jhu.edu/2017/03/02/health-effects-for-children-sweden-traffic-tax/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>dropped
by half</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
So I looked forward to the start of congestion pricing in New York City,
America’s biggest, densest, and most transit-friendly city. New York was
bushwhacking a trail for everyone else to follow: If congestion policy
was a success there, then other American cities could experiment with it
in some form.
</p>
<p>
By pausing that trial before it has even begun, Hochul has essentially
frozen our ability to experiment with congestion pricing anywhere else
in the country. By shuttering the policy in New York, she has poisoned
pro-climate urban politics everywhere. Now people will say: <em><em>You
saw what happened when New York tried to do congestion pricing. Do you
really want to try that here? </em></em>
</p>
<p>
In the past, when national Democrats have approved new pipelines or oil
projects, they have argued that those projects will not affect the
country’s carbon pollution because only <em><em>demand </em></em>for
fossil fuels, and not the supply of them, drives carbon emissions. But
what makes congestion pricing so powerful is that demand is precisely
what it targets. Congestion pricing makes buses run faster, pays for the
subway system, and pushes people and businesses to consider the social
cost of their driving before they get in the car.
</p>
<p>
Congestion pricing, if implemented widely, can actually conserve fossil
fuels and cut carbon emissions. Now Hochul has halted its progress
everywhere.
</p>
<p>
She has made, in other words, a local mistake with national and even
global consequences. It is such a foolhardy error that it instantly
recasts Kathy Hochul’s climate record as governor.
</p>
<p>
Hochul has previously been seen as a center-left governor playing a
difficult but moderate environmental hand. But is that really her
record? She
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/new-yorks-offshore-wind-future-is-being-dragged-down-by-its-past" target="_self"><u>has</u></a>
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/new-york-offshore-wind-canceled" target="_self"><u>struggled</u></a>
to build wind farms off the coast of New York, even though it is
essential to decarbonizing the state’s power grid. She
<a href="https://nysfocus.com/2024/04/19/new-york-heat-act-state-budget" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has
so far failed</u></a> to pass the NY HEAT Act, which would help the

climate goals.
</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
Almost every day, Donald Trump attacks clean energy and climate action.
He assails
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-fact-check-climate-change#electric-vehicles" target="_blank">electric
vehicles</a>,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-fact-check-climate-change#wind" target="_blank">offshore
wind</a>, and calls
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-fact-check-climate-change#climate-weather" target="_blank">climate
change a hoax</a>. He’s also
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-climate-change-project-2025" target="_blank">up
a little bit</a> in the polls.
</p>
<p>
Everyone in and out of the clean energy and environmental movement knows
this. So why, over two days at a conference hosted by the American
Council on Renewable Energy this week, did clean energy bankers,
investors, lawyers, and operators seem pretty optimistic about much of
the Inflation Reduction Act and other Biden energy policies surviving
into 2025 and beyond?
</p>
<p>
Pretty simply: Because there’s a lot of money being made — including in
Republican-controlled states.
</p>
<p>
“Money is money,” Gina McCarthy, the former Environmental Protection
Agency director and White House climate advisor, said during an on-stage
interview. “Honestly, who is going to pull the plug on the investments
from the Inflation Reduction Act without huge blowback from each of the
individual states and governors?”
</p>
<p>
“I’ve been telling my clients that it’s very unlikely that we’re going
to see substantial changes,” Mona Dajani, a partner at Baker Botts, told
me. “There’s a lot of clean energy in traditionally Republican states.
So do I see anything very material happening? No, I don’t. I think it’d
be very unlikely”
</p>
<p>
It’s not surprising that lawyers and investment bankers would be
optimistic about the Inflation Reduction Act. Much of the bill’s
spending is channeled through tax credits, which require lawyers and
investment bankers to arrange and write up deals between developers and
investors.
</p>
<p>
Whether this optimistic consensus will bear out in 2025 remains to be
seen (obviously), but that it exists at all in the present is a
testament to a
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/biden-climate-policy" target="_blank">deliberate
strategy</a>. The legislation, along with the Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law, gave a wide cross section of industries, and regions a stake in the
energy transition.
</p>
<p>
Even if it wouldn’t make these various elected officials and business
leaders Democrats — Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, for instance, seems to
be opening a new battery plant every week and is not supporting Biden’s
reelection — it may turn them into supporters of climate policy, or at
least give them a second thought about killing it.
</p>
<p>
At the core of the IRA are tax credits that, while they will soon be
“<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/clean-electricity-tax-credit" target="_blank">technology
neutral</a>,” will still largely benefit and are modeled on tax credits
for wind and solar. Those credits, the Production Tax Credit and the
Investment Tax Credit, are decades old, and have historically been
affirmatively extended under both Democratic and Republican presidents
when the status quo would have meant their demise. To undo them under a
second Trump administration would require Congress and the White House
to agree affirmatively to toss them out.
</p>
<p>
“When I look at the composition of Congress, even with a new
administration, I think it will be difficult to repeal it,” said Mit
Buchanan, managing director of energy investment at JPMorgan Chase,
speaking of the IRA during a panel at the conference. “There’s been good
support on both sides of aisle in respect to renewable energy in red and
blue states.
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/climate-change-voting-elections" target="_self">Job
creation</a> means a lot.”
</p>
<p>
Texas and Florida are two of the standouts in clean energy investment,
with Texas surpassing California in
<a href="https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/podcasts/how-texas-topped-california-for-utility-scale-solar-this-week-in-cleantech/#gref" target="_blank"><u>deploying
utility-scale solar</u></a> and leading the
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/state/analysis.php?sid=TX#4" target="_blank">leading
the country</a> in wind generation. Florida, meanwhile, has the
third-most solar installed among U.S. states.
</p>
<p>
Between the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law, though, there’s spending that goes beyond wind and solar, including
subsidies for oil industry darlings like carbon capture and
sequestration, as well as hydrogen energy development.
</p>
<p>
“Carbon sequestration and hydrogen brings in industries that were
traditionally hostile to renewables,” said Jordan Newman, a managing
director and renewables investment banker at Wells Fargo, at the
conference. A number of carbon sequestration infrastructure projects
have popped up in Republican-voting states, including a carbon dioxide
pipeline project in Iowa, while the sizable planned investments in
hydrogen include a
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/hydrogen-hubs-biden-pennsylvania-california-texas" target="_self"><u>hub
in Houston</u></a>, of which Chevron and ExxonMobil are partners.
</p>
<p>
But the Biden administration and regulatory agencies run by Biden
appointees are certainly acting as if large swaths of the
administration’s climate policy are at risk. The Treasury Department,
the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission have put out a flurry of rules and guidance before
self-imposed deadlines at the end of this year and to attempt to
front-run the ability of a Republican Congress and White House to undo
regulations through the Congressional Review Act.
</p>
<p>
“Our mission and what we continue to do is seek to get as much of the
guidance done right and done effectively on the most reasonable
timeframe that we can, and we’ll continue to do that all the way through
the end of this year,” Ethan Zindler, climate counselor at the Treasury
Department, told the audience.
</p>
<p>
Even if much of the energy tax credits and subsidies for specific
technologies like hydrogen and carbon sequestration could survive a
change in administration, other parts of the IRA may be at greater risk,
especially wind and <em>especially</em> especially offshore wind, for
which Trump
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-fact-check-climate-change" target="_self"><u>seems
to have a special distaste</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
“Offshore wind is challenging,” Meghan Schultz, the chief financial
officer of Invenergy, which won a contract for an offshore wind project
off the coast of New Jersey earlier this year, said on a panel.
</p>
<p>
She previewed a message for a potential second Trump administration,
focusing on the industrial and job benefits of offshore wind: “If he
were to be elected, it will be important that we’re working as an
industry to educate this administration on the value these projects will
bring, in clean energy and job creation and infrastructure.”
</p>
<p>
No matter what happens, business people tend towards the optimistic.
Said Thomas de Swardt, chief commercial officer at D.E. Shaw Renewable
Investments: “If it happens, we’ll sit around table and talk about how
we restructure and reprice deals.”

id="biden-dispatches-top-aides-to-press-hamas-as-israel-grapples-with-cease-fire-plan">Biden
dispatches top aides to press Hamas as Israel grapples with cease-fire
plan</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>White House  — President Joe Biden’s top aides are in the Middle East
to push for a three-phase Gaza cease-fire plan that the U.S. leader
announced last week as the latest offer from the Israeli war cabinet.
The deal would see an initial six-week pause of fighting and secure the
release of some hostages held by Hamas and some Palestinians detained in
Israeli jails.</p>
<p>CIA director Bill Burns arrived in Doha Tuesday, and Brett McGurk,
Biden’s top Middle East adviser, is in Cairo Wednesday, administration
officials confirmed to VOA. The pair is expected to convey Biden’s
message that Hamas should sign the deal, via key mediators Qatar and
Egypt.</p>
<p>Earlier in the week, Biden spoke with the Emir of Qatar Amir Sheikh
Tamim Bin Hamad Al-Thani, reiterating that the plan “offers a concrete
roadmap for ending the crisis in Gaza.”</p>
<p>The deal is structured toward a permanent cease-fire in exchange for
the release of all hostages and the reconstruction of Gaza. But neither
party appears close to agreement.</p>
<p>Despite the Israeli war cabinet signing off on the proposal, shortly
after Biden’s announcement Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed there
will be no permanent cease-fire without “the destruction of Hamas’s
military and governing capabilities.”</p>
<p>In response, Hamas official Osama Hamdan declared Tuesday it could
not agree without a clear Israeli position on a permanent cease-fire and
complete withdrawal from Gaza.</p>
<p>“You’re going to hear a lot of things in the media, a lot of
statements from a lot of different voices and a lot of different
people,” National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said. He spoke aboard
Air Force One Tuesday evening enroute to France where Biden is scheduled
to commemorate the anniversary of D-Day on Thursday.</p>
<p>Hamdan’s declaration aside, Sullivan said the administration would
only consider the group’s formal response as conveyed to the Qataris,
who transmitted the proposal from Israeli negotiators to Hamas.</p>
<p>“We have not gotten that yet,” Sullivan said, noting that the U.S. is
in “hourly contact” with Qatar.</p>
<p>What happens next?</p>
<p>The plan’s three-phase outline appears fundamentally similar to a
proposal that Hamas said it had accepted in early May. But given the
world’s condemnation of Israel’s actions on Rafah paired with a ruling
by the top U.N. court ordering the government to halt its military
offensive there, the group may seek to leverage its advantage on the
negotiation table.</p>
<p>“There is no guarantee that Hamas won’t come back with additional
conditions,” said Aaron David Miller, a former U.S. negotiator on Middle
East peace talks who is now a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment
for Peace.</p>
<p>Once Hamas provides its formal response, Netanyahu must present it to
his entire coalition, Miller told VOA. “And that’s where things get to
be very complicated.”</p>
<p>With far-right ministers of the coalition threatening to leave the
government if Netanyahu agrees to a cease-fire, and his war cabinet
members saying they would quit if he does not agree, the prime minister
faces the risk of a collapsed coalition no matter what he decides. That
could trigger early elections, potentially sending Netanyahu into the
opposition and making him more vulnerable to a conviction in his
corruption trial.</p>
<p>Biden’s announcement of the cease-fire plan has brought those
pressures on Netanyahu to a head.</p>
<p>“I think Netanyahu is trying to buy his time and stretch this out and
hope maybe that Hamas will actually be the one to say no more
definitively,” said Mairav Zonszein, a senior analyst on
Israel-Palestine at the International Crisis Group.</p>
<p>The prime minister could also find alternative opposition parties to
enter a temporary government, she told VOA. “It could be that Netanyahu
has something up his sleeve to be able to go with the deal and still
remain in power for a while.”</p>
<p>In an interview this week with Time magazine, Biden said “there is
every reason” for people to conclude that Netanyahu is prolonging the
conflict for his own political self-preservation.</p>
<p>He appeared to walk back the statement Tuesday when asked whether
Netanyahu is playing politics with the war.</p>
<p>“I don’t think so. He’s trying to work out the serious problem that
he has,” Biden said.</p>
<p>Biden under pressure</p>
<p>With polls suggesting Biden losing support from progressives and
young voters over his support for Israel, securing a cease-fire ahead of
the November election would appeal to swaths of Biden’s
constituents.</p>
<p>“The Democrats would like to avoid the ugly optics of ‘Genocide Joe’
demonstrations at their August convention,” said Laura Blumenfeld, a
senior fellow at Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International
Studies. Biden is set to be formally nominated as the party’s
presidential nominee during the convention.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Arab and Muslim Americans are having “difficult
discussions” over whether to support Biden or his Republican opponent,
said Muslim Public Affairs Council founder Salam Al-Marayati.</p>
<p>“On the one hand, no Republican has supported a cease-fire,”
Al-Marayati told VOA. “On the other hand, the president himself has
enabled genocide, has financed the genocide, has been a part,
complicitly, of this genocide.”</p>
<p>Biden and his aides have rejected the characterization that Israel’s
offensive in Gaza amounts to genocide.</p>
<p>From a domestic political point of view, Blumenfeld noted that
Biden’s timing of the announcement on the cease-fire was “spot on.”</p>
<p>“It is one of multiple gestures meant to highlight his leadership,”
she told VOA, noting a series of international engagements Biden is
embarking on as the White House sought to highlight his global
leadership.</p>
<p>Biden announced an executive order Tuesday on the migrant crisis
along the U.S. southern border with Mexico. He is set to deliver a
speech defending democracy on the beach of Normandy, France, on the 80th
anniversary of D-Day. He’ll meet leaders of the world’s leading
economies at the G7 summit in Italy later this month and host a NATO
summit in July.</p>
<p>“We are mobilizing common action to solve the great challenges of our
time,” Sullivan said in response to VOA’s question. “In these next six
weeks, the president will try to put all that on display.”</p>
<p>Biden has invested much on his cease-fire strategy. But neither of
the warring parties are in a hurry to end their conflict, Miller
said.</p>
<p>“The Biden administration is clearly under the most pressure and the
most urgency to see something happen,” he said, not just for domestic
political aims but also the goal of advancing a historic agreement to
normalize ties between Israel and Saudi Arabia that could only happen
with peace in Gaza.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with Saudi
Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud and reiterated that
Hamas should agree “without further delay,” State Department spokesman
Matthew Miller said.</p>
<p>The U.S. is also keen to keep in check Israel’s conflict with
Hezbollah near the northern Israeli border with Lebanon, which has been
fought in parallel to the Gaza war.</p>
<p>On this front, Biden is again dependent on Netanyahu. The prime
minister said Wednesday Israel is prepared for “very strong action”
against Hezbollah, saying he would restore security “one way or
another.”</p>
<p>VOA’s Virginia Gunawan and Anita Powell contributed to this
report.</p>

<p>date: 2024-06-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — China’s military appears to be intensifying its efforts
to recruit current and former Western fighter pilots, employing new and
more intricate tactics to snare Western expertise.</p>
<p>The United States and some of its closest intelligence partners
issued a new warning Wednesday, cautioning the People’s Liberation Army
(PLA) is using private companies, including corporate headhunters, so
that Western pilots are unaware of links to the Chinese military until
it is too late.</p>
<p>The goal, according to a bulletin issued by the U.S., Britain,
Canada, Australia and New Zealand — known as Five Eyes — is for China to
better train its own fighter pilots while gaining better insights into
how Western air forces operate, something that could erode Western
advantages or even give Chinese fighter jets a boost in case of a
conflict. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The bulletin said the PLA is recruiting through private companies
based in South Africa and China, trying to lure Western pilots with
lucrative salaries.</p>
<p>Other recruitment efforts include leveraging personal acquaintances,
professional networking sites and online job platforms, which similarly
obscure any links to the Chinese government or military. </p>
<p>“We’re issuing this joint bulletin today because this is a persistent
threat that continues to evolve in response to Western
countermeasures,” an official with the U.S. National Counterintelligence
and Security Center told VOA. </p>
<p>“Like any illicit enterprise that seeks to conceal its activities,
there have been efforts to incorporate entities [companies] in different
locations under different names,” the official said, speaking on the
condition of anonymity in order to discuss the rationale behind
Wednesday’s bulletin.</p>
<p>“There have also been variations in recruitment pitches and
approaches,” the official added. “It’s critical that we keep our current
and former service members informed about this threat, which is directly
targeting them.”</p>
<p>The Five Eyes bulletin said the Chinese recruitment efforts appear to
be targeting current and former military pilots from Five Eyes countries
as well as those from France, Germany and other Western nations.</p>
<p>The Chinese Embassy in Washington declined to comment on the
allegations in the Five Eyes bulletin about efforts by the PLA to hire
Western fighter pilots.</p>
<p>But it pushed back against the accusations that private companies
with links to China are engaged in improper behavior.</p>
<p>“Countries should not generalize and abuse the concept of national
security and smear relevant companies,” the embassy said in an email to
VOA. </p>
<p>“The companies’ normal business activities should be respected,” the
embassy added, saying that U.S. accusations are “not conducive to the
healthy development of China-U.S. relations.”</p>
<p>VOA has contacted the Chinese Embassy in Washington for comment.</p>
<p>Concerns about Beijing’s pursuit of Western pilots and aviation
expertise are not new.</p>
<p>British defense officials were sounding alarms about Chinese efforts
to recruit retired members of the British Royal Air Force through
companies in South Africa as far back as October 2022.</p>
<p>Australian defense officials raised similar concerns a month later,
warning that retired Australian military personnel had an “enduring
obligation” to protect state secrets and “to reveal any of those secrets
is a crime.”</p>
<p>Britain, Australia and the other Five Eyes members have also taken
action to curtail Beijing’s efforts.</p>
<p>The U.S. last year, for example, placed restrictions on 43 entities
tied to Chinese efforts to recruit and hire Western fighter pilots.</p>
<p>The targeted companies included a flight school in South Africa, a
security and an aviation company founded by a former U.S. Navy SEAL with
operations in the United Arab Emirates, Kenya and Laos.</p>
<p>While such work may have diminished Beijing’s efforts, the U.S. and
its intelligence partners warn China has responded aggressively, rolling
out new recruitment efforts aimed not only at hiring former Western
fighter pilots but hiring engineers and flight operation center
personnel who also could give the PLA insights into the operations and
tactics of Western air forces.</p>
<p>Wednesday’s bulletin advises current and former U.S. military
personnel approached with suspicious recruitment pitches to contact
their individual military services or the FBI.</p>
<p>Military personnel from other countries are encouraged to contact the
appropriate defense agencies.</p>
<p>“PLA recruitment efforts continue to evolve,” U.S. NCSC Director
Michael Casey said in a statement Wednesday.</p>
<p>The new warning “seeks to highlight this persistent threat and deter
any current or former Western service members from actions that put
their military colleagues at risk and erode our national security,” he
added.</p>

Democracy is having a big year — heck, it’s having a big
<em><em>month</em></em>. More people will vote in 2024 than in any other
year in human history, and many of those elections are happening right
now: In just the past four days, Mexicans elected
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/mexico-president-claudia-sheinbaum" target="_self"><u>a
climate scientist</u></a> to the presidency; Indians braved
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/climate/modi-climate-india-election.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>extreme
heat</u></a> to reelect Prime Minister Narendra Modi; and Donald Trump’s
pal Nigel Farage announced his return to the scrum of British politics
in the hopes of holding off
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uks-labour-party-set-194-seat-majority-general-election-yougov-poll-2024-06-03/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>an
historic win by the Labour Party</u></a> on July 4.
</p>
<p>
Americans still have another few months of suspense before their own
general election, but voting is well underway stateside, too. In
Tuesday’s primaries, voters cast ballots for local offices in Iowa,
Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, and South Dakota — including in several
races with significant implications for the climate.
</p>
<p>
While the results were a mixed bag, they also speak to the fact that
climate change is increasingly unignorable by politicians, and it
signals where campaigners and activists should focus their attention as
the November election approaches. Here are six of the major takeaways:
</p>
<h3>
Republican climate leaders can (probably?) win elections …
</h3>
<p>
<em>What happened:</em> Mariannette Miller-Meeks won the First District
Republican primary in Iowa
</p>
<p>
<em><em>Why it matters: </em></em>Miller-Meeks is the head of the
House’s Conservative Climate Caucus and has
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/climate-caucus-chair-faces-primary-challenge-this-week/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>championed</u></a>
wind, solar, and nuclear energy; her opponent, David Pautsch, attacked
her for
<a href="https://www.ourquadcities.com/news/4-the-record/pautsch-challenging-miller-meeks-in-gop-primary-from-right-wing-of-party/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>not
being conservative enough</u></a> on issues like abortion, the national
debt, and her support of tax credits for carbon pipelines. Though
Miller-Meeks’ history isn’t likely to impress too many climate activists
— she’s been particularly sympathetic to the liquified natural gas
industry, claiming, “If you want a cleaner, healthier planet, the best
thing you could do is to export American oil and gas” — her victory over
Pautsch in deep-red Iowa proves that
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/donald-trump-nikki-haley-ron-desantis-green-fox-news-cnn-debate" target="_self"><u>being
associated with the word “climate”</u></a> isn’t an automatic black mark
against a Republican in 2024. Still, it wasn’t a comfortable victory:
Early Tuesday evening, the returns
<a href="https://x.com/JacobRubashkin/status/1798167831865127033" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>had
looked pretty worrying</u></a> for Miller-Meeks, and
<a href="https://x.com/tencor_7144/status/1798178274922881320" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
slim margin</u></a> in some areas suggested the risk of breaking with
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-climate-change-project-2025" target="_self"><u>the
party line</u></a>.
</p>
<h3>
… but that doesn’t mean they’ve broken the climate curse
</h3>
<p>
<em><em>What happened: </em></em>Democratic voters in New Jersey weren’t
convinced by Hoboken Mayor Ravi Bhalla, who lost the Eighth
Congressional District primary to Rep. Rob Menendez, Jr.
</p>
<p>
<em><em>Why it matters: </em></em>Of all the candidates who ran in
contested primaries on Tuesday, none seemed to position themselves more
overtly as a climate candidate than Bhalla. As mayor of Hoboken, Bhalla
created a Department of Climate Action &amp; Innovation in part to adapt
to a future of
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/vermont-rain-storm-flooding-climate" target="_self"><u>extreme
flooding</u></a> in the city, has
<a href="https://climatecasechart.com/case/city-of-hoboken-v-exxon-mobil-corp/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>sued
Exxon Mobil</u></a> for climate-related damages, and centered climate as
a campaign priority, earning endorsements from environmental groups like
the New Jersey League of Conservation Voters and Food &amp; Water
Action. While many different factors go into winning — and losing — a
campaign (especially
<a href="https://prospect.org/politics/2024-06-03-end-of-the-line-new-jersey-machine-menendez/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>in
a state like New Jersey</u></a>), one lesson of the night is that
“climate,”
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/climate-change-voting-elections" target="_self"><u>at
least in so many words</u></a>, might not be the selling point that
progressives sometimes think it is. Case in point: Bhalla’s campaign
page on climate framed electrification as a means of reducing the
state’s “carbon footprint”; Menendez’s focused mainly
<a href="https://www.robmenendez.com/issues/climate-change/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>on
the economy and jobs</u></a>.
</p>
<h3>
Montana gets a front-row seat to the climate culture war
</h3>
<p>
<em><em>What happened: </em></em>Tim Sheehy won the Republican Senate
primary, setting him up to take on Democrat Jon Tester in one of the
most nail-biting races of November
</p>
<p>
<em><em>Why it matters: </em></em>Retired Navy SEAL and aerial
firefighter Tim Sheehy overcame a scandal involving
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/17/sheehy-gunshot-montana-senate/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
lie about his gunshot wound</u></a> to take on Tester in a race that
could decide the balance of the U.S. Senate — and, by extension, Biden’s
climate agenda — in five months’ time. A Trump endorsee, Sheehy is not
afraid of a good old-fashioned culture war, as evidenced by Bridger
Aerospace, his aerial firefighting company,
<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/tim-sheehys-company-website-removed-language-climate-change/story?id=101524874" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>quietly
removing references</u></a> to environmental, social, and governance
issues from its website after Sheehy entered the race. Any mention of
climate change? That was gone, too. But Sheehy’s rhetoric during his
primary campaign also reeked of the green boogeyman, with the candidate
repeatedly
<a href="https://dailymontanan.com/2024/04/25/sheehys-firefighting-companys-annual-report-shows-business-faces-financial-challenges/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>using
the term “climate cult”</u></a> to dismiss Tester, Biden, and other
perceived enemies. Though Tester, a working farmer, has championed
climate-related causes in a way that has
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/03/24/senate-only-farmer-is-an-unlikely-champion-climate-action/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>resonated
even with many Republicans</u></a>, Sheehy hasn’t yet appeared
interested in debating the finer points of things like federal subsidies
for going electric. Expect the attacks to get more colorful in the
coming months; polls show Sheehy and Tester neck-and-neck.
</p>
<h3>
The left really needs to start winning utility board elections
</h3>
<p>
<em><em>What happened: </em></em>Voters in Montana winnowed down<em>
</em><a href="https://montanafreepress.org/2024/05/21/the-gop-heavy-primary-for-montanas-utility-regulating-psc/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
crowded field</u></a> of six Republican utility board candidates to
three finalists
</p>
<p>
<em><em>Why it matters: </em></em>Utility boards are some of the most
influential elected bodies that almost nobody pays attention to, and
Republicans in red and red-leaning states like Arizona and Alaska tend
to hold the edge even in bluer urban areas. In Montana, the Public
Service Commission decides the energy mix of the region in and around
Billings, Missoula, Bozeman, Helena, and Butte, and has been in
Republican hands for two decades. That explains the high level of
Republican interest in the primary races on Tuesday, where five
candidates played musical chairs for two available seats. The apparent
winners — Brad Molnar in District 2 and Jeff Welborn in District 3 (in
addition to incumbent commissioner Jennifer Fielder, who ran unopposed)
— have hit-and-miss records when it comes to renewable energy. Molnar,
who was reelected to the seat he held from 2005 to 2012,
<a href="https://montanafreepress.org/2024/05/21/the-gop-heavy-primary-for-montanas-utility-regulating-psc/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>told
the </u><u><em><em>Montana Free Press</em></em></u></a> he’s concerned
about the “xenophobia” of conservatives in his state and has been known
to break from party lines in his votes, in addition to voicing

<h3>
‘Climate’ might be a dirty word, but ‘environmental justice’ doesn’t
have to be
</h3>
<p>
<em><em>What happened: </em></em>Angel Charley easily won the New Mexico
Democratic primary in Senate District 30, to the west of Albuquerque, on
an environmental justice platform
</p>
<p>
<em><em>Why it matters: </em></em>With around 63% of the vote as of
Wednesday morning, first-time candidate Angel Charley appeared to be the
clear winner in her race against former state Senator Clemente Sanchez.
Charley, the former director of the Coalition to Stop Violence Against
Native Women, convinced voters in the recently redrawn district that
climate goals aren’t different from popular policies like
<a href="https://nmpoliticalreport.com/issues/women/native-groups-protest-fossil-fuel-to-bring-attention-to-violence-against-native-women/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>protecting
vulnerable women living near extractive industries</u></a> in their
area, and can be pursued with projects like
<a href="https://sourcenm.com/2023/09/11/inupiaq-woman-focuses-on-indigenous-led-renewable-energy-efforts-in-new-mexico/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>community
solar development</u></a>. As the experts I’ve spoken with have told me,
sometimes the best way to move emissions-abating policies forward is by
focusing on what climate activists might view more as
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/climate-change-voting-elections" target="_self"><u>positive
externalities</u></a>, but are more immediate to the communities in
question. Charley’s victory on environmental justice grounds seems like
further proof of concept. A Native American activist, Charley’s campaign
focused largely on “lessening dependence on oil and gas and extractive
industries, because there’s a correlation with violence against Native
women when extractive industries are present.” Meanwhile, Sanchez’s
campaign was
<a href="https://nmindepth.com/2024/large-special-interests-square-off-in-district-30-democratic-primary/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>heavily
financed</u></a> by corporate interests, including donations from an oil
company, an auto dealer trade group, lobbyists, and utilities.
</p>
<h3>
There’s one pipeline South Dakotans can’t get behind
</h3>
<p>
<em><em>What happened: </em></em>17 out of 19 Republican and Democratic
sponsors of a
<a href="https://sdlegislature.gov/Session/Bill/25214" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>recent
bill</u></a> attempting to block a CO2 pipeline in the state who were up
for reelection won their primaries
</p>
<p>
<em><em>Why it matters:</em></em><em> </em>Located between the shale oil
fields of North Dakota and the storage terminals of Texas, South Dakota
is no stranger to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakota_Access_Pipeline" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>pipeline</u></a>
proposals. Plans for a new pipeline that would funnel carbon dioxide
produced by the local ethanol industry to North Dakota
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/politics-carbon-capture-weird" target="_self"><u>to
be stored underground</u></a>, however, have become a contentious wedge
issue in the state and appeared to be behind some of the primary results
on Tuesday night. Of the more than a dozen sponsors of a recent failed
bill that would have prohibited the use of eminent domain for the
construction of pipelines carrying carbon oxide, all but two who ran
appeared to have been reelected as of Wednesday morning; some of the
state’s losing incumbents, on the other hand, were behind a compromise
bill that attempted to split the difference between protecting
landowners and allowing the pipeline project to proceed. The slim
margins in some races —
<a href="https://southdakotasearchlight.com/2024/06/05/incumbent-legislators-suffer-losses-as-pipelines-and-property-rights-surge-to-the-fore/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>The
South Dakota Searchlight</em></em></u><u> points to</u></a> Mykala
Voita, a landowner rights candidate who beat incumbent Republican
Sen. Erin Tobin by 48 votes, within the margin to trigger a recount —
speak to the deep divides and disagreements in the state. That also goes
for divisions within the major parties about the use of eminent domain
and
<a href="https://www.dakotarural.org/our-work/carbon-pipelines/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>suspicions</u></a>
about the technology of carbon capture and storage more largely.

Biden gun trial hears from FBI agent as first lady looks on</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Wilmington, United States — Jurors at Hunter Biden’s trial heard
testimony Wednesday from an FBI agent who investigated the U.S
president’s son for allegedly buying a handgun while using crack
cocaine.</p>
<p>On Tuesday the court heard that Hunter Biden — the first child of a
sitting U.S. president to be prosecuted — was a heavy drug user and
allegedly lied about this on the paperwork when purchasing the
firearm.</p>
<p>He is also on trial in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware — his
family’s political heartland — for illegal possession of the firearm,
which he had for just 11 days in October 2018.</p>
<p>FBI Special Agent Erika Jensen testified how investigators retrieved
evidence, including photographs apparently showing drugs, from a now
infamous abandoned laptop that has been at the heart of Republican
efforts to discredit the Biden family.</p>
<p>Hunter Biden’s ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle, could take the stand after
Jensen according to the outline of the case given by the prosecution on
Tuesday.</p>
<p>First Lady Jill Biden, was again in court Wednesday, as she has been
for every day of the trial, while President Joe Biden has issued a
statement saying he is “proud” of his son.</p>
<p>The case has been a distraction for Biden’s reelection campaign
against Donald Trump. The president was in France on Wednesday to attend
World War II D-Day commemorations and is in the midst of rolling out
major initiatives on illegal migration into the United States and a
proposed truce for Gaza.</p>
<p>The trial comes just days after Trump was convicted in a New York
court on business fraud charges.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the prosecutor in Wilmington played extracts from an
audio version of Hunter Biden’s memoir “Beautiful Things,” recorded by
Biden himself, in which he recalled his descent into addiction, when he
would desperately seek out crack cocaine.</p>
<p>“I cooked [crack] and smoked. I cooked and smoked,” said the extract
played to the court, taken from his audiobook.</p>
<p>But Hunter Biden’s lawyer said that he “was not using drugs when he
bought that gun” and that it “was never loaded, never carried, never
used” during the 11 days he owned it.</p>
<p>Biden, a Yale-trained lawyer and lobbyist-turned-artist, has stated
that he has been sober since 2019.</p>
<p>The legal woes have reopened painful emotional wounds for the Biden
family, stemming from his time as a drug addict and well before.</p>
<p>His brother Beau died from cancer in 2015, and his sister Naomi died
as an infant in a 1972 car crash that also killed their mother, Neilia,
Joe Biden’s first wife. Hunter and Beau were the only survivors of the
accident.</p>
<p>If found guilty, Hunter Biden could face 25 years in prison, although
as a first-time offender, jail time is unlikely.</p>
<p>The president’s son has long been the target of hard-right
Republicans trying to embarrass Joe Biden, and Trump allies have
investigated him at length in Congress on allegations of corruption and
influence-peddling. No charges have ever been brought.</p>
<p>Hunter Biden’s business dealings in China and Ukraine have also
formed the basis for attempts by Republican lawmakers to initiate
impeachment proceedings against his father. Those efforts too have gone
nowhere.</p>
<p>The White House said last year that there would be no presidential
pardon for Hunter Biden in case of a conviction.</p>

id="amd-drops-windows-10-support-for-new-chipsets-and-processors-while-microsoft-expands-testing-efforts-for-new-windows-10-features">AMD
drops Windows 10 support for new chipsets and processors, while
Microsoft expands testing efforts for new Windows 10 features</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>Remember when I said the honeymoon with AMD’s consumer-friendly
chipset and socket support policy would eventually end? Well, while this
is not exactly that, it will make a lot of people very unhappy. While
AMD, as does any other company, was boastful about its product touting
the 16% IPC boost on Zen 5 and the big AI performance leap delivering up
to 50 TOPS on the NPU side, an interesting drawback of the Ryzen AI 300
series that has managed to avoid getting media attention is the lack of
support for Windows 10. While this was just an unconfirmed rumour last
month even though it was suggested by a supposed Lenovo China manager,
we have now got confirmation from AMD itself that the report, that Strix
point and newer CPUs and APUs will not support Windows 10 is true. ↫
Sayan Sen at NeoWin Official support for Windows 10 is ending next year,
so there is some reason to AMD’s madness, but at the same time, almost
70% of Windows users are currently using Windows 10, and leaving those
users behind might not be the best idea AMD ever had. There is an
argument to be made that at least a reasonable number of these people
are still using Windows 10 not out of their own volition, but because of
Microsoft’s strict hardware requirements, and as such, anyone buying a
new AMD machine will just opt for the latest version of Windows out of
habit, but I still think there’s a sizable contingent of people who
actively choose Windows 10 over 11 for a whole host of reasons. On a
strongly related note, despite 2025 marking the end of regular support
for Windows 10, Microsoft yesterday announced it’s expanding the the
number of Insider channels for new Windows 10 features from one to two,
adding a Beta tier below the existing Release Preview tier. Microsoft,
too, will have to come to terms with the fact that with 70% of Windows
users using Windows 10, they might not even be able to drop support for
the operating system as early as next year. While this 70% number will
surely slowly decrease over the next 12 months, with many people simply
being unable to upgrade due to hardware limitations, I have a suspicion
we might see an extension on that 2025 date.</p>

<p>
Purely hypothetically, I wonder what it would take to raise enough money
to build another first-class fediverse platform for the mass market.
</p>
<p>
Not because there’s anything wrong with Mastodon (or Threads or
Flipboard), but I think the fediverse would be healthier with another
big platform in the mix.

<h2 id="a-jab-back-at-brexit-or-a-kick-in-the-teeth">A jab back at
Brexit (or a kick in the teeth)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-05, from: Ben Werdmuller’s blog</p>
<div class="e-content aside-content">
<p>
<img src="https://werd.io/file/66606ed88fc52215850ac692/thumb.jpg" alt="Nigel bloody Farage" width="1024" height="683">
</p>
<p>
I grew up in Britain, but I was able to be there because of my European
citizenship. When I moved to the US it was because my mother was
terminally ill; I’d always assumed that I would go back. When the Brexit
vote happened, I took it extremely personally: in lots of ways, the
British public voted to throw people like me out.
</p>
<p>
In the interim, some people have assured me that, no, it’s not people
<em>like me</em>. After all, I have a British accent, and if you didn’t
actually know, you’d be forgiven for assuming that I <em>was</em>
British. Of course, that’s a hugely xenophobic reflex: my British accent
makes me okay, but someone else’s Polish accent means that they’re not.
I stand with the people who more obviously come from somewhere else; I
do, too. All of us are (or, I suppose, <em>were</em>) an active part of
British society, integral parts of communities, and so on.
</p>
<p>
Brexit was offensive, stupid, counterproductive, and xenophobic. I’m not
glad that Britain has been suffering the consequences of this own-goal,
because so many of my friends still live there, and so many communities
are suffering. Spitefully wishing ill on people who are hurting isn’t a
good look. But I certainly have no love for the people who voted for
this travesty.
</p>
<p>
It’s not fun to be barred from living in the place I called home. It
happened at a time in my life when it was becoming apparent that there
was a terminal, genetic disease that runs in my family; multiple family
members had it, and I hadn’t yet had the genetic test that suggested my
sister and I weren’t going to get it. It was the same year that Trump
became President on a similarly anti-immigrant platform. Overall, it was
A Bad Time.
</p>
<p>
Oddly, then, I’m not unhappy to see Nigel Farage run for Prime Minister.
Obviously, he’s among the worst people alive, as if the worst impulses
of British society had been congealed, <em>Doctor Who</em> style, into a
comic book villain with an angry toad for a face. Two of his children
are even dual European citizens, because the hypocrisy is part of the
schtick for these people. But because he’s running, he’s going to split
the Conservative vote, with the hard right voting for Farage and the
people who claim they’re not hard right voting for whoever the
Conservative leader of the week will be on — who picked this day?! —
July 4th. (It’ll be Rishi Sunak or a slowly-decomposing head of iceberg
lettuce. Let’s see.)
</p>
<p>
Keir Starmer is not a giant leap of an improvement: a John Major
impersonator who would have comfortably been a Tory candidate in 1995.
But at least he’s not one of the guys who brought about Brexit and all
of the ludicrous policies that followed. It’s <em>something</em>. A jab
back for all the people who have been hurt over the last 14 years since
hog aficionado David Cameron was first elected with the help of a
last-minute coalition assist from Nick Clegg, who, of course, now leads
international face-saving for Meta.
</p>
<p>
A Conservative loss is the foothills of the foothills of the foothills
of the work to be done to rebuild. But it would, at least, be a baby
step forward. And even then, I’m ready to be disappointed, because,
really, <em>nothing</em> in this arena has gone well since forever, and
I, for one, have lost the ability to be really optimistic.

Microsoft’s Recall software seems like a horrible idea:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“Surprise! It turns out that the unencrypted database and the stored
images may contain your user credentials and passwords. And other stuff.
Got a porn habit? Congratulations, anyone with access to your user
account can see what you’ve been seeing. Use a password manager like
1Password? Sorry, your 1Password passwords are probably visible via
Recall, now.”

<p>
Worse, it’s going to be built into Windows 11 for all compatible
hardware, in a way that will make it hard or impossible to disable. This
doesn’t make sense to me: which privacy-conscious CIO (just for example,
one working in a well-regulated industry where privacy is a legal
requirement) would allow this to roll out? This is yet another reason
for Windows 10 to remain the most popular version.
</p>
<p>
It also seems like nobody at Microsoft (or nobody at Microsoft with
power) has considered the potentially serious social implications of
what they’re building:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“Victims of domestic abuse are at risk of their abuser trawling their PC
for any signs that they’re looking for help. Anyone who’s fallen for a
scam that gave criminals access to their PC is also completely at risk.”

I’m increasingly concerned about what Apple will be rolling out on
Monday. We’re hearing quite believable rumors that it’ll be AI-based,
but is it going to be Apple’s take on the same thing? That, too, has the
potential to be a disaster.
</p>
<p>
Once again, I can’t believe that the only way to get away from this
stuff will be to run Linux on the desktop.

<blockquote>
<p>
“The pervasive nature of modern technology makes surveillance easier
than ever before, while each successive generation of the public is
accustomed to the privacy status quo of their youth.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The key, as Bruce Schneier argues here, is not to compare with our own
baselines, but to take a step back and consider what a healthy ecosystem
would look like in its own right.
</p>
<p>
The underlying story here is that Microsoft caught state-backed hackers
using its generative AI tools to help with their attacks, and people
were less worried about the attacks themselves than about how Microsoft
found out about them. It’s a reasonable worry, and I thought the same
thing: if Microsoft found this, then they’re likely more aware of the
contextual uses of their platform than we might assume.
</p>
<p>
This is certainly less private than computing was twenty or thirty years
ago. But it’s not a major iteration on where we were five years ago, and
without intervention we’re likely to see more erosion of user privacy
over the next five years.
</p>
<p>
So what should our standards for privacy be overall? How should we
expect a company like Microsoft to treat our potentially sensitive data?
Should we pay more for more security, or should it just be a blanket
expectation? These are all valid questions - although I also have ready,
opinionated answers.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps the more important question is: who has the right to come to a
conclusion about these questions, and how will they be enforced? As of
now, it’s still open.

<ol type="1">
<li>Report: Global carbon dioxide removal must quadruple
</h3>
<p>
A team of international researchers this week published
<a href="https://www.stateofcdr.org/resources?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_4MaXQYcNJMd_QZm0mrP0FeBKDAEg3ouTc2gAfCnwoWTurW_SpFyhyDFcpIrM61zMNOhnN" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a
new report</a> on the state of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) as it
relates to global climate goals. The top-line takeaway is that CDR must
quadruple if we want to stay in line with the goal of limiting global
warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. While stopping <em><em>new</em></em>
greenhouse gas emissions is the top priority in curbing global warming,
experts agree CDR will be needed to address legacy emissions, which can
remain in the atmosphere for decades.
</p>
<p>
Current CDR efforts – from reforestation to direct air capture
technology – remove about 2 billion metric tons of CO2 from the
atmosphere every year. That’s far short of the 7-9 billion metric tons
that will need to be removed annually by 2050. But the report’s authors
say there are signs that CDR development is slowing down. They call for
more investment to support the “high ambitions” of CDR companies, and
want countries to weave CDR policies into their national climate action
plans to spark demand and help CDR scale. Currently just 1.1% of
investment in climate-tech startups goes toward CDR. In April,

report found</a> that the U.S. will need to spend $100 billion per year
by 2050 to make CDR a viable climate solution.
</p>
<p>
One really interesting insight from the report is that grant money is
flowing steadily toward CDR research and development, especially in the
U.S. and Canada: There were fewer than 50 third-party research grants
for CDR in the year 2000, compared to 1,160 in 2022.

published in the journal <em><em>Nature Geoscience</em></em> finds that
the Earth’s groundwater is warming up due to climate change. For the
study, researchers created a model to estimate changes in groundwater
temperatures in varying global warming scenarios. Their model shows that
by the end of the century, groundwater could be between 2.1 and 3.5
degrees Celsius (or between 3.8 and 6.3 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer on
average than it is today. This would be bad news for ecosystems that
rely on groundwater, as well as for humans: “As groundwater warms, there
is increased risk of pathogen growth which impacts drinking water
quality – potentially affecting the lives of many people,”

<li>California city votes to cancel contentious geoengineering study
</h3>
<p>
A first-of-its-kind geoengineering research project in California has
been officially canceled. The research, conducted by a team from the
University of Washington, involved spraying sea salt aerosol particles
into the air using an instrument situated on a decommissioned aircraft
carrier in Alameda, California. This process has been pitched as a way
to brighten clouds and reflect the sun’s rays to cool the planet.
Because studies on manipulating the climate are so controversial, the
researchers kept the project on the downlow until it was up and running,
and this lack of transparency – rather than any safety concerns – seems
to have really rubbed city officials the wrong way. The Alameda City
Council voted this morning to reject the experiment. “You didn’t start
out on the right foot,” Alameda Mayor Marilyn Ezzy Ashcraft

The dispute may be a little preview of things to come. “There’s a fair
number of people who think there shouldn’t be research [on

battleground for this larger question about how to think about the
development of these technologies,” David Keith, director of the Climate

At the height of pandemic lockdowns, folks stayed in yet also
desperately wanted to get out. Enter the open streets movement, which
advocates for roads being temporarily closed off to cars and expanded
for pedestrians and public space. Now, advocates in Brooklyn are pushing
to make some of those changes more permanent. Plus, manufacturing and
construction appear to lose steam, and the Amazon Labor Union will link
up with Teamsters.

with France visit, looks to past and future of global conflicts</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The White House; Paris — U.S. President Joe Biden landed Wednesday in
France to mark the 80th anniversary of the Normandy invasion — and plans
to use the occasion to underscore the need for a strong transatlantic
alliance in the face of Russian aggression in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Biden will meet Ukraine’s president, and with surviving American
veterans of the 1944 beach invasion, said national security adviser Jake
Sullivan. Biden will use the events, Sullivan said, to “talk about,
against the backdrop of war in Europe today, the sacrifices that those
heroes and those veterans made 80 years ago and how it’s our obligation
to continue their mission to fight for freedom.”</p>
<p>Sullivan, who spoke to reporters aboard Air Force One en route to
Paris, said Biden will also deliver a speech on Friday at Normandy that
will cover “the existential fight between dictatorship and freedom” —
all while overlooking a 30-meter tall cliff that Army Rangers had to
scale under enemy gunfire to win the battle that eventually led to
France’s liberation and the demise of Nazi Germany.</p>
<p>“And he’ll talk about the dangers of isolationism and how, if we bow
to dictators, fail to stand up to them, they keep going and ultimately
America and the world pays a greater price,” he said.</p>
<p>Biden will also attend a state visit hosted by French President
Emmanuel Macron, in addition to face-to-face talks with Ukrainian
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has been invited to the somber
ceremonies marking this decisive battle that led to the end of World War
II.</p>
<p>American presidents have regularly made the journey for this critical
anniversary, and Biden is no exception.</p>
<p>“The president is very much looking forward to going to Normandy over
the course of the next two days of this week to commemorate the service
and the sacrifice, the bravery of the soldiers, Allied and American
alike, who fought in D-Day in that invasion, conducted Operation
Overlord and really spelled through that operation, the beginning of the
end of Nazi Germany, and the beginning of something even more impactful,
and that’s this rules-based international order that we all still
continue to enjoy today,” John Kirby, White House national security
communications adviser, told VOA at the White House.</p>
<p>Here, analysts say, history offers lessons.</p>
<p>“The D-Day landings were the Western Allies’ military statement that
authoritarian regimes could not change boundaries by force,” said Mark
Cancian, a retired Marine colonel and a senior advisor at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies. ”That countries could not just be
invaded, and that authoritarian regimes of the type that Nazi Germany
constituted — particularly with its terrible oppression of subjugated
peoples, particularly the Jews — were not acceptable and not just not
acceptable, but would be destroyed.”</p>
<p>Analysts say Biden’s Ukraine goals will be overshadowed by his
increasingly unpopular support of another conflict.</p>
<p>“Even though obviously Ukraine is the top priority for the Europeans,
they are seeing how the Biden administration’s policy on Gaza is
undermining European security in two different ways,” said Trita Parsi,
executive vice president of the Quincy Institute.</p>
<p>“First of all, it is really destroying Western credibility in the
broader international community and in the Global South — any talk about
the rules-based international order at this point, will get laughed at,
given what the Biden administration has done.”</p>
<p>This trip to France, a close ally, comes at the start of six weeks of
high-level U.S. involvement in high-stakes summits — including a peace
summit on Ukraine, a summit of leaders of the Group of Seven, or G7,
leading industrialized countries, and a summit of NATO members.</p>
<p>VOA asked Sullivan what this set of diplomatic events could mean for
peace in Europe, and beyond.</p>
<p>“I think we need to send a clear message to [Russian President
Vladimir] Putin that he cannot outlast us, and that he cannot divide
us,” he replied. “And we have been very good at holding the line on
those two messages, and this is going to be a great opportunity over the
coming weeks to not just put a period at the end of that sentence, but
an exclamation point.”</p>

id="italian-court-re-convicts-amanda-knox-of-slander-for-wrongly-accusing-man-of-killing">Italian
court re-convicts Amanda Knox of slander for wrongly accusing man of
killing</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>FLORENCE — An Italian court re-convicted Amanda Knox of slander on
Wednesday, even after she was exonerated in the brutal 2007 murder of
her British roommate while the two were exchange students in Italy.</p>
<p>The court found that Knox had wrongly accused an innocent man, the
Congolese owner of the bar where she worked part time, of the killing.
But she will not serve any more jail time, given the three-year sentence
counts as time already served.</p>
<p>Knox, who had returned to Italy for only the second time since she
was freed in 2011 to participate in the trial, showed no visible emotion
as the verdict was read aloud.</p>
<p>But her lawyer, Carlo della Vedova, said shortly afterward that
“Amanda is very embittered.”</p>
<p>Knox had written on social media ahead of the hearing that she hoped
to “clear my name once and for all of the false charges against me. Wish
me luck.”</p>
<p>The slaying of 21-year-old Meredith Kercher in the idyllic hilltop
town of Perugia fueled global headlines as suspicion fell on Knox, a
20-year-old exchange student from Seattle, and her new Italian boyfriend
of just a week, Raffaele Sollecito.</p>
<p>Flip-flop verdicts over nearly eight years of legal proceedings
polarized trial watchers on both sides of the Atlantic as the case was
vociferously argued on social media, then in its infancy.</p>
<p>Knox’s retrial was set by a European court ruling that Italy violated
her human rights during a long night of questioning days after Kercher’s
murder, deprived of both a lawyer and a competent translator. </p>
<p>Earlier in the hearing, Knox had asked the eight Italian judges and
civil jury members to clear her of the slander charge.</p>
<p>In a soft and sometimes breaking voice, Knox had told the court that
she wrongly accused Patrick Lumumba under intense police pressure. </p>
<p>“I am very sorry that I was not strong enough to resist the pressure
of police,’’ Knox told the panel in a 9-minute prepared statement,
sitting alongside them on the jury bench. She told them:”I didn’t know
who the murderer was. I had no way to know.”</p>
<p>The case continues to draw intense media attention, with
photographers massing around Knox, her husband Christopher Robinson and
their legal team as they entered the courtroom about an hour before the
hearing. A camera knocked her on the left temple, her lawyer Luca
Luparia Donati said. Knox’s husband examined a small bump on her head as
they sat in the front row of the court.</p>
<p>Despite Knox’s exoneration and the conviction of an Ivorian man whose
footprints and DNA were found at the scene, doubts about her role
persisted, particularly in Italy. That is largely due to the accusation
she made against Lumumba.</p>
<p>Knox is now a 36-year-old mother of two small children. She returned
to Italy for only the second time since she was freed in October 2011,
after four years in jail, by a Perugia appeals court that overturned the
initial guilty verdict in the murder case against both Knox and
Sollecito.</p>
<p>She remained in the United States through two more flip-flop verdicts
before Italy’s highest court definitively exonerated the pair of the
murder in March 2015, stating flatly that they had not committed the
crime.</p>
<p>In the fall, Italy’s highest Cassation Court threw out the slander
conviction that had withstood five trials, ordering a new trial, thanks
to a 2022 Italian judicial reform allowing cases that have reached a
definitive verdict to be reopened if human rights violations are
found. </p>
<p>This time, the court has been ordered to disregard two damaging
statements typed by police and signed by Knox at 1:45 a.m. and 5:45 a.m.
as she was held for questioning overnight into the small hours of
Nov. 6, 2007. In the statements, Knox said she remembered hearing
Kercher scream, and pointed to Lumumba for the killing.</p>
<p>Hours later, still in custody at about 1 p.m., she asked for pen and
paper and wrote her own statement in English, questioning the version
that she had signed.</p>
<p>“In regards to this ‘confession’ that I made last night, I want to
make clear that I’m very doubtful of the verity of my statements because
they were made under the pressure of stress, shock and extreme
exhaustion,” she wrote.</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
Rooftop solar is four times more expensive in America than it is in
other countries. It’s also good for the climate. Should we even care
about its high cost?
</p>
<p>
Yes, says Severin Borenstein, an economist and the director of the
Energy Policy Institute at the University of California, Berkeley’s Haas
School of Business. In a recent blog post, he argued that the high cost
of rooftop solar will shift nearly $4 billion onto the bills of low- and
middle-income Californians who <em><em>don’t </em></em>have rooftop
solar. Similar forces could soon spread the cost-shift problem across
the country.
</p>
<p>
On this week’s episode of Shift Key, Rob and Jesse talk with Borenstein
about who pays for rooftop solar, why power bills are going up
everywhere, and about whether the government should take over electric
utilities. Shift Key is hosted by Robinson Meyer, the founding executive
editor of Heatmap, and Jesse Jenkins, a professor of energy systems
engineering at Princeton University.

Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Severin Borenstein:</strong> Let me start by saying, there are
two big problems with the way we do this. One is the equity issue, which
I’m sure we’ll get back to, which is that it turns out this extra money,
when you get it by charging people for kilowatt-hours, takes a
disproportionate share of the income from low-income people. <br/> <br/>
The other is, when you set a price for electricity that is way above the
actual cost of providing that electricity, it’s going to discourage
people from electrifying things. Now, it’s also going to discourage
people from just using more electricity, and people who love
conservation say, well, we should have higher rates to encourage
conservation. I think that’s misguided beyond some point, and we are way
beyond that point in many areas. <br/> <br/> But setting that aside for
a moment, we need people to electrify. If we’re going to reduce
greenhouse gases, the way we’re going to electrify […] is by people
switching to electric transportation instead of burning gasoline, and
people switching to electrification for heating, hot-water heating,
cooking, clothes drying, all the things where you have a choice of using
natural gas. In both of those cases, if you overcharge for electricity,
you are discouraging people from doing that sort of electrification.
<br/> <br/> I will give you the extreme example — again, in California.
Right now, even with California’s well known very high gasoline prices,
gasoline and electricity are about at parity. That is, you don’t save
money fueling your car with electricity. If you compare a Prius to a
Tesla Model 3, which are about the same interior size, you don’t save
money when you switch to a Tesla Model 3, for fueling. That’s nuts. You
should be saving three-quarters of the cost of fueling by switching to
electricity. <br/> <br/> Likewise, when we start talking about heat
pumps, now, there’s one other aspect of this which is often not
appreciated. Not only are we overcharging for electricity, we are
undercharging for gasoline. So even with all the taxes — and I’ve done a
bunch of work on this — if you look at the price of gasoline almost
everywhere in the country … Actually, if you believe the social cost of
carbon is over $100 a ton, everywhere in the country, gasoline is
underpriced. We’re not charging enough to reflect the full cost. <br/>
<br/> So it’s even worse than just the overpricing of electricity. We’re
really putting our thumb on the scale in the wrong direction when it
comes to getting people to electrify transportation. And it’s also true
with natural gas, though to a lesser extent. If we’re going to consider
the social cost of carbon over $100 a ton, natural gas is also
underpriced pretty much everywhere in the country. <br/> <br/> So we
want people to adopt heat pumps. We want people to put in heat pump
water heaters. But we’re really sending economic signals to tell them
not to.

Kim wins Democratic Senate primary in New Jersey</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Trenton, New Jersey — Representative Andy Kim won the Democratic
Senate primary in the U.S. state of New Jersey on Tuesday, putting him
in a strong position for the general election in the blue-leaning state.
The win comes a day after Democratic Senator Bob Menendez filed to run
as an independent amid his federal corruption trial. </p>
<p>Kim, a three-term congressman who launched his campaign after charges
against Menendez were announced last year, rose to the top in the
state’s dominant political party over a relatively short period. A
former Obama national security official, he defeated an incumbent
Republican in a 2018 House race and won a court ruling that toppled a
unique-to-New Jersey system widely viewed as giving political bosses
influence over who wins primaries. </p>
<p>“Our win today is a stunning victory for a people-powered movement
that mobilized against corruption and stood up to the machine politics
of New Jersey,” Kim said in a statement. </p>
<p>Kim’s victory comes after a bruising start to the primary, when a
battle between him and New Jersey first lady Tammy Murphy began to take
shape. Murphy, a first-time candidate and the spouse of Governor Phil
Murphy, bowed out of the contest, saying she did not want to engage in a
negative campaign against a fellow Democrat. On Tuesday, Kim defeated
labor leader Patricia Campos-Medina and longtime grassroots organizer
Lawrence Hamm, who remained on the ballot. </p>
<p>Menendez, a three-term incumbent senator, declined this year to seek
re-election as a Democrat but filed Monday in Trenton to run as an
independent. He has said he hopes to be cleared of the charges this
summer. </p>
<p>Democrats’ tight hold on control of the Senate means they can hardly
afford a competitive race in a state widely viewed as safe for the
party. It’s unclear how the trial of Menendez will end and how his
candidacy could affect the race. Republicans are eager to exploit his
run as a wedge to divide the Democratic vote.</p>

id="china-us-nuclear-weapons-in-south-korea-would-undermine-its-security">China:
US nuclear weapons in South Korea would undermine its security</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — China said it opposes a deployment of nuclear weapons to
South Korea as it would pose danger to regional countries. Beijing was
reacting to a report suggesting the United States should take such a
measure to enhance deterrence against threats from North Korea. </p>
<p>“If the U.S. deploys tactical nuclear weapons in Asia-Pacific region,
it will be a dangerous move that will seriously threaten the security of
regional countries and undermine regional peace and stability,” said Liu
Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington. </p>
<p>“We will continue to handle Korean Peninsula affairs based on their
merits and our own position,” he said in a statement sent to VOA on
Monday. The embassy spokesperson described China’s position on the
Korean Peninsula as ensuring peace and stability and advancing political
settlement that suits the common interests of all parties. </p>
<p>The remarks were made in response to a report released May 29 by U.S.
Senator Roger Wicker, the highest-ranking Republican on the Senate Armed
Services Committee, calling for a major boost to U.S. military buildup
and readiness against countries such as North Korea and China.</p>
<p>In the report, “Peace Through Strength,” Wicker suggested the U.S.
explore new options, such as a “nuclear sharing agreement in the
Indo-Pacific and re-deployment of U.S. tactical nuclear weapons in the
Korean Peninsula.”    </p>
<p>He said these would “bolster deterrence on the Korean peninsula” as
North Korea “continues to build more nuclear weapons and ballistic
missiles capable of striking the United States and our allies in the
Indo-Pacific.” </p>
<p>In response to Wicker’s report, a U.S. State Department spokesperson
told VOA’s Korean Service on Friday that “the United States does not
assess returning nuclear weapons to the Indo-Pacific as necessary at
this time” and “has no plans to forward deploy nuclear weapons to the
Korean peninsula.” </p>
<p>The spokesperson continued, “U.S. security commitments to allies and
partners in the Indo-Pacific region are steadfast and U.S. extended
deterrence commitments to the Republic of Korea, Japan, and Australia
remain ironclad.”  </p>
<p>In 1991, the U.S. withdrew from South Korea its nuclear weapons,
which had been stationed there since the late 1950s. The U.S. has been
providing extended deterrence commitment to South Korea and Japan, which
means the U.S. military would use its full range of capabilities,
including nuclear weapons, to defend its allies.  </p>
<p>Washington and Seoul will hold their third Nuclear Consultative Group
(NCG) meeting next week in Seoul to discuss ways to enhance extended
deterrence, South Korea’s Defense Ministry said Tuesday.   </p>
<p>The NCG was set up under the Washington Declaration announced in
April last year when U.S. President Joe Biden and South Korean President
Yoon Suk Yeol held a bilateral summit in Washington.   </p>
<p>On Sunday, after the U.S., South Korean and Japanese defense chiefs
met in Singapore, the three countries announced they will conduct their
first trilateral, multi-domain exercises, dubbed Freedom Edge, this
summer.   </p>
<p>Robert Peters, a research fellow for Nuclear Deterrence and Missile
Defense at the Heritage Foundation, told VOA via email, “The United
States should seriously consider redeploying nonstrategic nuclear
weapons to [South] Korea” as they would help strengthen deterrence. </p>
<p>Nonstrategic nuclear weapons refers to low-yield tactical nuclear
weapons designed to be used on the battlefield. </p>
<p>However, Thomas Countryman, who recently served as acting
undersecretary of arms control and international security under the
Biden administration, said “such a deployment would draw [South Korea’s]
attention away from building conventional capabilities that are more
essential to continued deterrence.” </p>
<p>Out of 200 tactical nuclear weapons the U.S. has in its active
inventory, 100 are located in Europe and the other 100 are stored as a
strategic reserve in the U.S, according to Bruce Bennett, a senior
defense analyst at the RAND Corporation. </p>
<p>“With the Russian aggression over Ukraine, it is hard to imagine the
United States taking any significant number of weapons out of Europe,”
said Bennett.   </p>
<p>“With China on the rise, the United States will be inclined to leave
its strategic reserve in the United States and certainly not deploy it
in South Korea where it could potentially be vulnerable to Chinese or
North Korean interdiction,” he continued. </p>
<p>Gary Samore, former White House coordinator for arms control and
weapons of mass destruction during the Obama administration, said, “The
U.S. military opposes the deployment of tactical nuclear weapons or any
nuclear weapons to [South] Korea, because they would be vulnerable to a
North Korean attack.” </p>
<p>Japan would not object to the U.S. deployment of nuclear weapons in
South Korea “as long as they remain under U.S. control,” said David
Maxwell, vice president of the Center for Asia Pacific Strategy. “It is
only when South Korea develops its own nuclear weapons, would it
potentially kick off an arms race in the region.”</p>

id="white-house-pushes-cease-fire-deal-despite-lack-of-enthusiasm-from-israel-hamas">White
House pushes cease-fire deal despite lack of enthusiasm from Israel,
Hamas</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>white house — Despite Israeli leaders pledging to continue military
operations until Hamas is destroyed and Hamas saying it cannot accept a
deal without Israeli commitment to a permanent cease-fire, mediators
from the United States, Egypt and Qatar continue to push through a
cease-fire proposal that President Joe Biden said last week had been
agreed to by Israel.</p>
<p>VOA White House Bureau Chief Patsy Widakuswara spoke with National
Security Council spokesperson John Kirby about why Biden chose to
announce the proposal instead of the Israelis, and what the challenges
are to reaching a truce in Gaza.</p>
<p>The following interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.</p>
<p>VOA: President Joe Biden announced the cease-fire proposal on behalf
of the Israelis, and then he rallied the G7 and the U.N. Security
Council to support it. Can you explain the thinking behind his
strategy?</p>
<p>National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby: It was important
to lay bare to the public what this proposal said, especially right
after it was transmitted to Hamas, so that everybody can see how
impactful this can be, so everybody can see what the eventual outcome
might be, which is a permanent cessation of hostilities as a possibility
from Phase Two. Also, because we want to make sure that Hamas knows that
the world now knows what’s in this proposal and what’s at stake.</p>
<p>VOA: Is the strategy partly to empower Prime Minister [Benjamin]
Netanyahu not to buckle under pressure from his right-wing governing
partners? How confident is the president that the Israelis will go
through with this?</p>
<p>Kirby: The Israelis have said it themselves – it’s their proposal,
they’re signing up to it, they’re acknowledging it, they’re owning it,
as they should. And we have every expectation that they’ll continue to
back this proposal because it is theirs and it is in their interest.
It’s also in Hamas’ interest. They say they want the war to end; this is
a path to end that war.</p>
<p>VOA: I understand what happens now is we’ll wait for the formal
response from Hamas, however …</p>
<p>Kirby: Well, look, there could be some bartering and negotiations
going forward. We’ll see what Hamas comes back with.</p>
<p>VOA: The U.S. has said that it supports Israel’s goal to destroy
Hamas’ governing and military capabilities. Are the administration and
Israel aligned in terms of the parameters of what that means?</p>
<p>Kirby: We believe that we are aligned, that we both want to see the
hostages home. Certainly, the Israelis want that. We want to see a Gaza
that is not governed by Hamas. We want to see a Hamas that can’t
threaten Israel the way they did on Oct. 7. And we believe through our
conversations with our Israeli counterparts that they too want to see
the suffering in Gaza alleviated. Now, that said, they have a right and
responsibility to continue to go after Hamas. And we’re going to
continue to help them do that. How they do that matters, and we’re still
having conversations with them about what’s going on in Rafah.</p>
<p>VOA: We have the experience of Iraq, to understand what the
implications of rooting out the Baath Party means. Does our
understanding of that inform our strategy toward what Israel should do
with Hamas?</p>
<p>Kirby: We’re not trying to compare this to the Baath Party in Iraq in
that situation. These are totally two different situations. Look, we
agree with Israel, not on everything, certainly. But we agree with them
on the big things: They shouldn’t have to live next door to a terrorist
threat. They shouldn’t have to be victimized the way they were on the
7th of October. They shouldn’t have to see Gaza governed by Hamas. All
of those things are true. And we’re going to continue to work with them
to defeat that threat. At the same time, it’s important for this war to
come to an end, as the president said, and the best way to do that is to
get those hostages out because that leads to a temporary cease-fire,
which can lead to a more permanent cessation of hostilities.</p>
<p>VOA: Phase One is a six-week full and complete cease-fire, according
to the president. Can Israel target Hamas leaders during this time?</p>
<p>Kirby: They are allowed to continue, of course, their operations in
Rafah unless or until we get a cease-fire in place. If we can get this
hostage deal inked, if Hamas agrees to it, then an immediate cease-fire
takes place for six weeks. And that means that there will be no military
operations in Rafah or anywhere else in Gaza.</p>
<p>VOA: Including targeting of Hamas leaders?</p>
<p>Kirby: The fighting comes to an end for the period of the
cease-fire.</p>
<p>VOA: Including on targets?</p>
<p>Kirby: The fighting comes to an end.</p>
<p>VOA: You said the Israel Defense Forces’ recent actions in Rafah have
not reached your definition of a major ground operation, which the U.S.
does not support without credible Israeli plans to protect civilians.
But hundreds have been killed just in recent days, and a million people
have fled from Rafah. Isn’t this, in effect, the same result that the
U.S. wants Israel to avoid?</p>
<p>Kirby: Look, we don’t want any civilian casualties, whether it’s from
a targeted operation, an airstrike or something bigger than that. The
right number of civilian casualties is zero. None of them are
acceptable, nor should they be acceptable. But we have not seen Israel
go into Rafah in a large, concerted, concentrated way. We have not seen
major ground operations in Rafah. They are doing what they said they
were going to do –going after Hamas leaders in a targeted, precise way.
We’re going to continue to watch this, obviously, and watch it
closely.</p>
<p>VOA: Why is a major ground operation the criteria for the U.S. red
line when most of the civilians have been killed in airstrikes? Why not
the number of civilian deaths as the red line, if you say that the
correct number is zero?</p>
<p>Kirby: The correct number is zero. And again, what we’ve told the
Israelis is what the president said: that if they go in a heavy-handed
way, major ground operations in Rafah in the population centers, that’s
going to cause us to have to relook at our own Gaza policy and the
support that we’re providing them. We have not seen them take that sort
of a step right now. And again, we’re watching it closely.</p>
