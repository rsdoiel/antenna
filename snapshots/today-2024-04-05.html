<p>I just heard about GitButler from a Discord friend. I’m kind of ripe

I don’t regret the switch, but I don’t love GitHub Desktop so much I

businesses want to use AI to cut staff</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-05, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
A survey of corporate executives in the U.S. and elsewhere finds that
nearly half expect to employ fewer people because of new artificial
intelligence tools — and they expect that change to happen in the next
five years. We’ll hear more. Plus, hiring was stronger than expected
last month, continuing the Fed’s predicament. And later on the show, an
immigrant family in Waterloo, Iowa, reflects on multigenerational
living.

<p>
Yes, they did: A
<a href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/at00sbh3yv/executive" target="_blank">4.8
magnitude earthquake</a> struck about 1 kilometer below Central New
Jersey Friday morning — not strong enough to cause severe damage in most
cases, and smaller than the

Earlier this year, a tiny,
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/02/nyregion/nyc-earthquake-roosevelt-island.html#:~:text=Across%20Roosevelt%20Island%20and%20in,a%20deep%20sleep%2C%E2%80%9D%20Ms." target="_blank">1.7
magnitude quake</a> hit in New York’s Astoria neighborhood, causing
little to no destruction. (Reports of a transformer explosion due to the
quake turned out to be unfounded.) Thomas Pratt, a research geophysicist
for the U.S. Geological Survey, told The New York Times that actually,
New York gets lots of tiny earthquakes each year. Earthquakes of this
magnitude, however, are decidedly less common.
</p>
<p>
By contrast, a 7.4 magnitude
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/strong-72-magnitude-earthquake-hits-taipei-2024-04-03/" target="_blank">earthquake
hit Taiwan</a> on Wednesday, causing at least nine deaths and more than
1,000 reported injuries. The insurance damages are still being assessed
but will no doubt reach into the billions. That quake also sent major
shockwaves through the global computing chip supply chain, as the
world’s largest chipmaker, TSMC, was forced to halt production and
evacuate.
</p>
<p>
The immediate aftermath of the New Jersey quake produced no reports of
severe damage, and New York Metro Weather reported that there was
<a href="https://twitter.com/nymetrowx/status/1776258143841906810" target="_blank">no
tsunami risk</a> anticipated. Airports in the region grounded flights to
evaluate safety conditions. The event seemed mainly to have given
Northeasterners an excuse to log into Twitter again for the first time
in months.

report: 68,000 guns illegally trafficked by unlicensed dealers over 5
years</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — More than 68,000 illegally trafficked firearms in the
United States over a five-year period came through unlicensed dealers
who aren’t required to perform background checks, according to new data
released Thursday by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and
Explosives. </p>
<p>That represents 54% of the illegally trafficked firearms in the U.S.
between 2017 and 2021, Justice Department officials said. The guns were
used in 368 shooting cases, which are harder to investigate because
unlicensed dealers aren’t required to keep records of their sales that
could allow federal agents to trace the weapon back to the original
buyer, said ATF Director Steve Dettelbach. </p>
<p>The report, ordered by Attorney General Merrick Garland, is the first
in-depth analysis of firearm trafficking investigations in more than 20
years. It examined more than 9,700 closed ATF firearm trafficking
investigations that began between 2017 and 2021. Firearms trafficking is
when guns are purposely moved into the illegal market for a criminal
purpose or possession. </p>
<p>The second-highest share of firearm-trafficking cases investigated by
ATF was from straw purchases, when someone buys a gun for a person who
can’t get it legally themselves. </p>
<p>The report also shows that the recipients of trafficked firearms were
people who had previously been convicted of a felony in almost 60% of
the cases in which investigators were able to identify the background of
the recipient. Furthermore, trafficked firearms were used to commit
additional crimes in almost 25% of the cases, Dettelbach said. That
includes more than 260 murders and more than 220 attempted murders,
according to the report. </p>
<p>“The data shows, therefore, that those who illegally traffic
firearms, whether it’s out of a trunk, at a gun show or online, are
responsible for real violence in this nation,” Dettelbach said. “In
short, you can’t illegally help to arm violent people and not be
responsible for the violence that follows.” </p>
<p>The report found the average number of guns trafficked per case was
16. People who got them through unlicensed dealers bought 20 weapons on
average, compared with 11 guns for straw buyers, according to the
report. </p>
<p>The Biden administration has separately proposed a rule that would
require thousands more gun sellers to be licensed and run background
checks. The Justice Department says it’s aimed at sellers who are in the
business of firearm sales, but the proposal quickly drew protest from
gun-rights groups who contend it could ensnare regular people who
sometimes sell their own guns. </p>
<p>The rule, which has not yet been finalized, is estimated to affect
24,500 to 328,000 sellers. During the five years documented in the
report, 3,400 unlicensed dealers were investigated by the ATF.</p>

id="us-employers-added-303000-jobs-in-march-in-sign-of-economic-strength">US
employers added 303,000 jobs in March in sign of economic strength</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — America’s employers delivered another outpouring of jobs
in March, adding a sizzling 303,000 workers to their payrolls and
bolstering hopes that the economy can vanquish inflation without
succumbing to a recession in the face of high interest rates. </p>
<p>Last month’s job growth was up from a revised 270,000 in February and
was far above the 200,000 economists had forecast. By any measure, it
amounted to a strong month of hiring, and it reflected the economy’s
ability to withstand the pressure of high borrowing costs resulting from
the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes. With the nation’s consumers
continuing to spend, many employers have kept hiring to meet steady
customer demand. </p>
<p>Friday’s report from the Labor Department also showed that the
unemployment rate dipped to 3.8% from 3.9% in February. That rate has
now come in below 4% for 26 straight months, the longest such streak
since the 1960s. </p>
<p>Normally, a blockbuster bounty of new jobs would fan worries that the
additional spending from those new workers could accelerate inflation.
But the March jobs report showed that wage growth was mild last month,
which might allay any such fears. Average hourly wages were up 4.1% from
a year earlier, the smallest year-over-year increase since mid-2021. But
hourly pay rose 0.3% from February to March after increasing 0.2% the
month before. </p>
<p>The economy is sure to weigh on Americans’ minds as the November
presidential vote nears and they assess President Joe Biden’s reelection
bid. Many people still feel squeezed by the inflation surge that erupted
in the spring of 2021. Eleven rate increases by the Fed have helped send
inflation tumbling from its peak over the past year and a half. But
average prices are still about 18% higher than they were in February
2021 — a fact for which Biden might pay a political price. </p>
<p>The Fed’s policymakers are tracking the state of the economy, the job
market and inflation to determine when to begin cutting interest rates
from their multidecade highs — a move eagerly awaited by Wall Street
traders, businesses, homebuyers and people in need of cars, household
appliances and other major purchases that are typically financed. Rate
cuts by the Fed would likely lead, over time, to lower borrowing rates
across the economy. </p>
<p>The central bank’s policymakers started raising rates two years ago
to try to tame inflation, which by mid-2022 was running at a four-decade
high. Those rate hikes — 11 of them from March 2022 through July 2023 —
helped drastically slow inflation. Consumer prices were up 3.2% in
February from a year earlier, far below a year-over-year peak of 9.1% in
June 2022. </p>
<p>Yet the sharply higher borrowing costs for individuals and companies
that resulted from the Fed’s rate hikes were widely expected to trigger
a recession, with waves of layoffs and a painful rise in unemployment.
Yet to the surprise of just about everyone, the economy has kept growing
steadily and employers have kept hiring at a healthy pace. Layoffs
remain low. </p>
<p>Some economists believe that a rise in productivity — the amount of
output that workers produce per hour — made it easier for companies to
hire, raise pay and post bigger profits without having to raise prices.
In addition, an influx of immigrants into the job market is believed to
have addressed labor shortages and slowed upward pressure on wage
growth. This helped allow inflation to cool even as the economy kept
growing. </p>
<p>In the meantime, the Fed has signaled that it expects to cut rates
three times this year. But it is awaiting more inflation data to gain
further confidence that annual price increases are heading toward its 2%
target. Some economists have begun to question whether the Fed will need
to cut rates anytime soon considering the consistently durable U.S.
economy.</p>

thing Twitter is good for — getting support from your cable ISP.
Spectrum’s other ways of providing support are designed to get you to
give up without using too much of their employees’ time. On Twitter,
they pretty much always stay with it to resolution. And on Twitter, they
have real people who have access to network tools, so they can see the
problem from their end, and can give you a clue of what if anything you
can do to fix it.
</p>
<p>
I’m pretty good at bug reports, and that appears to work with the online
support people they have on Twitter. If you try to chat with them or
call them on the phone they read from a script which has you completely
tear down and rebuild your system before they’ll consider thinking about
the data you have. And all this after keeping you on hold listening to
their insidious advertising for 15 or more minutes.
</p>
<p>
I don’t think the other twitter-like systems have any critical mass with
support people from ISPs. Not like Twitter.
</p>
<p>
BTW, support is one place ChatGPT would excel, btw. All kinds. And I
don’t think too many people will lose their jobs, because their support
systems are so bad because they don’t hire enough people, or give them
enough time with customers, or training, to actually help them very
much. I know how to completely tear down the network without them
instructing me how to do it.

extended range forecast</a> for the region. They estimate there will be
more named hurricanes than usual (11 compared with the 30-year average
of 7.2) and that five of them could be major storms. There’s an
above-normal chance (62% compared with 43% historical averages) that at
least one of these major hurricanes will make landfall somewhere along
the continental U.S. coastline. While these are just predictions, the
team says they are more confident than in past years in their forecast
“given how hurricane-favorable the large-scale conditions appear to be.”

They’re referring to two factors: Unusually warm sea surface
temperatures in the Atlantic, and an expected transition out of El Niño
and into La Niña. Warmer waters provide more energy for storms, and La
Niña “typically increases Atlantic hurricane activity through decreases
in vertical wind shear.” Ocean temperatures last year were the hottest
ever recorded, driven by both El Niño and climate change from burning
fossil fuels. “A key area of the Atlantic Ocean where hurricanes form is
already abnormally warm,”

<li>Disneyland’s Autopia ride will get rid of gas-powered cars

<p>
<span></span>Disneyland’s Autopia ride is ditching its gas-powered cars
and going electric as part of its plan to reach net-zero emissions by
2030. The attraction, which lets visitors drive around a miniature
motorway in small cars, is located at Disneyland’s Tomorrowland in
Anaheim, California. When Tomorrowland opened in 1955, Walt Disney
called it “a step into the future, with predictions of constructive
things to come.” But Autopia’s existing cars are loud and produce
noxious fumes, prompting complaints from visitors and climate activists
alike. This week Disney announced it will swap them out for electric
versions “in the next few years,” though it didn’t say whether the new
cars would be fully electric or hybrid. Bob Gurr, who helped Walt design

<p>OpenBSD 7.5 has hit the streets (or servers and workstations), and it
comes with a metric ton of improvements and new features. Of course, the
kernel has been improved in countless ways, from symmetric
multiprocessing improvements to a new font usable as a console font. The
graphics drivers have been updated to match Linux 6.6.19, and drivers
for the Apple display coprocessor were added. Furthermore, a whole slew
of additional ARM boards and SoC are now supported, and new drivers for
a variety of networking chips, both wired and wireless, were added as
well. Of course, that’s just a selection of the changes, and the full
changelog lists them all for those of you with specific wishes.</p>

<p>
<strong>Let's start from the basics: can you introduce
yourself?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I’m Matt Stein. I live with my wife and cat-sized dog in Bend, Oregon.
Grew up in Ohio, studied graphic design in upstate New York, and I’ve
been bouncing around the U.S. ever since.
</p>
<p>
My design degree led me to a small interactive agency in Seattle where I
worked with HTML, CSS, Flash, and a CMS called ExpressionEngine. I
taught intro-level HTML and Flash workshops in the design school we
shared a building with—a former hat factory downtown built in 1920 that
was later swallowed by Amazon expansion. I learned an amazing amount in
those few years, and in that environment.
</p>
<p>
I left with my youthful enthusiasm and surprise knack for coordinating
agency work to run a solo gig for twelve years, and learned a lot more
about people, technology, business, and unfortunately the minutia of
taxes and accounting. Having complete responsibility for my workload and
decisions—from triumphant to cringey—was extremely satisfying.
</p>
<p>
I left that to work as a technical writer with the team behind Craft
CMS, a successor to ExpressionEngine I was proficient with and fond of.
I moved to Bend, Oregon with that job, lived my first spectacular
burnout adventure, and left that in 2022.
</p>
<p>
I just turned forty and I’m working on whatever act two looks like. I
want it to involve using my generalist bag of skills to make the world
better in some way that’s focused more on human beings than investors or
shareholders.
</p>
<p>
I tinker with things for work and for fun. Lately it’s been a parade of
Astro, Eleventy, Kirby, creative writing, reacquainting myself with the
piano, and playing high-adrenaline video games as a thought break. I
spend a lot of time reading despite being a fairly slow reader, and
that’s ramped up as I’ve started following newsletters and RSS feeds in
an attempt to distance myself from algorithms and hype.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>What's the story behind your blog?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I got to tech-nerding as soon as my uncle booted up our family’s first
MS-DOS computer, so having my own site was more nature running its
course than a careful decision. I lucked out and beat a surprising
number of Matt Steins to mattstein.com, and the first site I remember
having on it was college portfolio. It was an oppressively blue Flash
site that heavily relied on a barcode as a design element as if that
wasn’t a cliché. I don’t remember if it had a blog, but let’s hope not.
</p>
<p>
I’ve changed platforms a few times over the years, mostly writing brief
notes about books or minor technical breakthroughs and migrating
everything from Statamic to Craft CMS to Gatsby and now to Astro. I’ve
used it as a place to experiment, always with a custom front end I
intend to someday finish. I used Procreate to hand draw favicons for my
current site until I finally got to one I liked, and I regularly build
little features and ideas I don’t launch. Send help!
</p>
<p>
My old company’s blog got more attention for a long time, but it’s a
retired Gatsby site and I’m back to mattstein.com again with stronger
feelings that I need a personal site and I need to be writing more.
</p>
<p>
I’ve always felt like an internet outsider, I think because I was always
an okay visual designer in the midst of either “real” developers and
software engineers, or designers that could make you a really kickass
band poster. I was quiet in forums, didn’t go to conferences, and
offered all the fun and personality of a cardboard cutout. This started
to change with the <a href="http://peersconf.com">Peers conference</a>
and meeting people in the Craft CMS community, which is a wonderful
place full of professionals and design agencies that do really cool
work.
</p>
<p>
Writing’s always been a tool for me to sharpen my thinking, and I spent
years shortchanging myself being sort of aloof—so I’m working on writing
and publishing more and participating in the kind of internet I badly
want to thrive. I’m inspired by what so many people choose to write and
share, and I want to be part of that. I want to write something that
matters to someone, and I need to be publishing for that to have a
chance.
</p>
<p>
So that’s what my blog is to me right now. And I love that if I wake up
tomorrow with some other idea, it can support that.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>What does your creative process look like when it comes to
blogging?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
It’s generous to call it a “process,” because for me it’s the
spontaneous choice to corral half-thoughts, impulses, and rambling into
a Markdown file with a title and a publish date.
</p>
<p>
I rewrite and edit heavily to try and find what I want to say. I wrote
obscenely long answers to these questions and had to start over, and I’m
one of those serial Discord+Slack edit-after-sending people. I would go
broke as a stone engraver.
</p>
<p>
If we visualized my thought process, it might be a tornado moving
through a junkyard while I cling to a lamppost and catalog the various
tires and scraps of siding. I use notes, journaling, and outlining to
sort things out and pat my hair back down and build something with
whatever I’ve collected.
</p>
<p>
I squirrel bookmarks and notes in Raindrop and Obsidian, and keep a long
list of writing ideas in an Obsidian (Markdown) file. Some ideas are
just bullets, some link to impossibly cryptic notes, and some link to
long drafts too weird or uninteresting to publish. The ones that seem
faintly coherent graduate to a Markdown file in my Astro repository
where they’ll probably turn into posts. Rare ones hop into Scrivener
books because it seems like they want more structure and may go on for a
while.
</p>
<p>
If I get stuck or bored with something, I’ll rewrite it from scratch to
approach it from a different angle. If I can’t manage to get words out,
I’ll use a mind map to free-associate ideas as fast as I can and then
look for opportunities to explore.
</p>
<p>
Trying to summarize my years as a technical writer was really important
to me, for example, and I wrote about it a lot without ever feeling like
I said what I wanted. I laughed out loud when I stumbled on
<a href="https://ianthehenry.com">Ian Henry’s writing</a>, and I tried
channeling that style in
<a href="https://mattstein.com/thoughts/documentation-is-hard/">another
rewrite</a> that I finally liked. (I told Ian I ripped him off and he
was fine with it.) I want you to like it too, but the little miracle for
me is that I don’t need you to. I rarely get something to that point.
</p>
<p>
I’m trying to also be better at not reply-guying Mastodon posts, but
turning strong feelings or tangents into blog posts. Better thinking for
me, one less notification for somebody else rationing finite attention.
</p>
<p>
I’ll ask specific people to read drafts if I know they’ll be inclined to
spot any sketchy or inaccurate details, but usually it’s me going it
alone and re-reading with specific people in mind as a way to pretend at
a fresh perspective.
</p>
<p>
If this answer isn’t long enough, I wrote
<a href="https://mattstein.com/thoughts/how-i-write/">a post about how I
write</a>.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe
the physical space influences your creativity?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I’m a sensitive creature and absolutely believe spaces influence my
creativity, both physical and psychological.
</p>
<p>
I process and reflect best in stillness. That means visual and auditory
quiet as much as putting away any extraneous thoughts. God forbid I need
to write a coherent sentence but I forgot to flip the “clean” magnet on
the dishwasher. I write best at my desk in my little cave of a bedroom
office, or on the couch piled with blankets and a cup of coffee.
</p>
<p>
I find new ideas outside the cave, whether that’s reading or talking
with people or physically exploring new places.
</p>
<p>
Taking an idea on a walk or into the shower is usually a good way to
clarify it. I keep wondering what a walking shower desk would look like
but it all falls apart with conference calls.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your
tech stack?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
mattstein.com is an Astro site hosted on
<a href="https://pages.cloudflare.com">Cloudflare Pages</a>. My domain
registrations are split between
<a href="https://porkbun.com">Porkbun</a> and Cloudflare Registrar, and
this one’s with Cloudflare.
</p>
<p>
I use Cloudflare R2 (which is like Amazon S3) to store a handful of
images, and a self-hosted imgproxy instance that resizes them on the
fly. This probably sounds fancier than it is—mostly an experiment
related to work projects.
</p>
<p>
I don’t use a CMS because in this case it might overcomplicate things,
but as a chronic replatformer I’ve been looking at Payload CMS and Kirby
because what if I overcomplicated it?
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would
you do anything differently?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
What I admire most about bloggers and newsletter writers I follow is
that they manage to write.
</p>
<p>
Anything from interesting blurbs to deep, moving essays. I’ll be
impressed or entertained by the format sometimes, but ultimately the
magic is the writing. The number of people with crusty, dated-looking
blogs still publishing incredible posts is a testament to that.
</p>
<p>
So I’d liberate myself from my greatest constraints: the fear of putting
dumb words next to my name, and excessive platform puttering. I’d pick a
low-key domain name that’s not literally the one I was born with, and
I’d pick a platform like <a href="https://blot.im">Blot</a> that lets me
tailor the look without rebuilding the whole machine every two years and
finding new ways to break my RSS feed. That way I could focus on the
writing, or at least have fewer distractions to blame when I’m not
writing.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Financial question since the web is obsessed with money: how
much does it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost or does it
generate some revenue? And what's your position on people monetising
personal blogs?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
As hobbies go, I’d probably lose less money maintaining an old boat.
</p>
<p>
The operating costs are $9.15/year for the domain name, and $22/year for
a cheap VPS to run that imgproxy thing I mentioned. Astro is free, as is
Cloudflare Pages with my meager traffic. I spend heaps of time on the
site that I can’t justify financially.
</p>
<p>
I have no problem with people monetizing their personal blogs and admire
anyone taking it seriously enough to try and make it a sustainable
endeavor.
</p>
<p>
But that’s not what it’s about for me.
</p>
<p>
I’m anxious about the effect big companies and commerce have had on the
internet, and my blog is my little personal space—a tiny world as I’d
like it to exist. No ads, no tracking, no referral links, no pressure to
subscribe. I want to tell you about some things I’ve bought that I
really like, but I don’t want it to even <em>seem</em> like that kind of
blog.
</p>
<p>
I don’t even have a rough idea how many people subscribe to my RSS feed,
and I like that. The feed isn’t for me.
</p>
<p>
The winds of income shifted for me recently, and as I re-evaluated
expenses I suddenly noticed how many independent writers and developers
and artists seem to put their work before their income. I think that’s a
courageous thing to do, and my usually-free-tier patronage didn’t square
with that. So now I keep a list of projects and resources and try to do
a better job of supporting them when they offer a way to do it. (It’s
never enough and I have a lot more to go!)
</p>
<p>
I know our priorities and circumstances are all different, but I wonder
what the internet would look like if we collectively did more of that.
</p>
<p>
Career-wise I need to figure out what I’m selling and do that, but I’ll
keep the selling to some other place because mattstein.com is my place
to be a person more than a product.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth
checking out? And also, who do you think I should be interviewing
next?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I’d like to answer this three times.
</p>
<p>
Answer 1: <a href="https://daverupert.com">Dave Rupert</a>.
</p>
<p>
I’m still working up the confidence to not have a side blog for weirder
posts I’m self-conscious about, and Dave’s been over there this whole
time, regularly publishing interesting, entertaining, and useful things,
but now he’s added self-described
<a href="https://daverupert.com/stories/">shitty science fiction</a>
complete with covers! From my point of view this is some wizardly
next-level blog stuff.
</p>
<p>
Answer 2: <a href="https://sarajoy.dev">Sara Joy</a>, who’s playful and
inventive and always mentioning parts of the internet where fun is still
served. As far as I know, she also invented the term “short thorts”
which is endlessly amusing to me.
<em>(<a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/pb-sara-joy">Sara was the 29th
P&amp;B guest</a>)</em>
</p>
<p>
Answer 3: the folks at <a href="https://goodenough.us">Good Enough</a>.
I’m only a new fan, but they make and share fun internet projects
together that to me epitomize playful, stylish, inventiveness that’s
cheerful and not overly commercial.
</p>
<p>
I’d like to find my inner versions of all these people. And there are
many more, because I’m instantly enamored with anyone that chooses to
write their own blog and build things for fun.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Final question: is there anything you want to share with
us?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I’d say “watch this space” while I figure out what I’m doing, but
there’s a nonzero chance I’ll end up pivoting away from tech to work
maintenance at a horse therapy ranch or something. But surely I’d write
about that.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for publishing this series and having me as a guest here! And
thanks to anyone reading!

<h2 id="ffmpeg-7.0-released">FFmpeg 7.0 released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>A new major release, FFmpeg 7.0 “Dijkstra”, is now available for
download. The most noteworthy changes for most users are a native VVC
decoder (currently experimental, until more fuzzing is done), IAMF
support, or a multi-threaded ffmpeg CLI tool. This release is not
backwards compatible, removing APIs deprecated before 6.0. The biggest
change for most library callers will be the removal of the old
bitmask-based channel layout API, replaced by the AVChannelLayout API
allowing such features as custom channel ordering, or Ambisonics.
Certain deprecated ffmpeg CLI options were also removed, and a
C11-compliant compiler is now required to build the code. ↫ FFmpeg
website I don’t think many of directly interface with FFmpeg, but we’re
most likely all using it one way or another. Even Microsoft (here‘s the
referenced bug report).</p>

<p>date: 2024-04-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>PCIe 7.0 is is the next generation interconnect technology for
computers that is set to increase data transfer speeds to 128 GT/s per
pin, doubling the 64 GT/s of PCIe 6.0 and quadrupling the 32 GT/s of
PCIe 5.0. This would allow a 16-lane (x16) connection to support 256
GB/sec of bandwidth in each direction simultaneously, excluding encoding
overhead. Such speeds will be handy for future datacenters as well as
artificial intelligence and high-performance computing applications that
will need even faster data transfer rates, including network data
transfer rates. ↫ Anton Shilov at AnandTech PCIe 7.0 won’t hit devices

newspaper publisher files lawsuit over police raid</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The publisher of a small Kansas newspaper that police
raided in August is suing officials involved in the act, accusing them
of violating the newspaper’s First Amendment rights.</p>
<p>When police in Marion, Kansas, raided the newsroom of the Marion
County Record and the home of its publisher, Eric Meyer, the move was
met with widespread condemnation from press freedom groups.</p>
<p>Meyer said he wanted to file the lawsuit because the raid on his
weekly newspaper has major implications for press freedom across the
United States.</p>
<p>“We’re the plaintiffs in this, but really, the plaintiff is American
democracy,” Meyer told VOA. “They’re trying to silence criticism —
silence anything other than the voice they want to hear. And we just
can’t let that stand. We wouldn’t be doing our duty as Americans.”</p>
<p>During the August 11 raid, security footage showed police seizing
computers, cell phones, hard drives and other devices from the newsroom.
And in the Meyer household, footage reveals Eric’s 98-year-old mother,
Joan, co-owner of the newspaper, confronting police during the raid on
their home.</p>
<p>The lawsuit, which Meyer filed Monday in the U.S. District Court for
Kansas, also alleges that the stress of the raid caused his mother’s
death the day after.</p>
<p>After the raid, Joan “repeatedly told her son that her entire life
was meaningless if this is what Marion had become,” the lawsuit
said.</p>
<p>The nearly 130-page lawsuit, which Meyer said took some time to put
together, is the fourth filed by current and former newspaper staffers
over the incident.</p>
<p>Police defended the raid, saying they were responding to an identity
theft complaint.</p>
<p>Meyer disagrees.</p>
<p>“This was an attempt by people to weaponize the criminal justice
system for personal gains,” he said.</p>
<p>The newspaper was investigating the police chief who led the raid.
Gideon Cody eventually resigned in October after body camera footage
revealed him rifling through files about himself.</p>
<p>“It’s clear as anything that we didn’t do anything wrong,” said
Meyer, who estimates the case won’t be resolved until 2026.</p>

<p>date: 2024-04-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell has
suggested that the U.S.-U.K.-Australia trilateral security partnership
known as AUKUS may soon be expanded to include other Indo-Pacific
nations.</p>
<p>AUKUS was established in 2021 in the face of China’s increasingly
assertive presence in the Indo-Pacific. Talks about other countries
joining the group or participating in what is called Pillar 2 have been
circulating for more than a year.</p>
<p>“It was always believed when AUKUS was launched that, at some point,
we would welcome new countries to participate, particularly in Pillar
2,” Campbell said while speaking Wednesday at an event hosted by the
Center for a New American Security (CNAS).</p>
<p>The first pillar of AUKUS was to provide Australia with a
conventionally armed, nuclear-powered submarine fleet, and the second
pillar is to collaborate on advanced capabilities such as artificial
intelligence, quantum technology, advanced network capabilities,
hypersonic capabilities, electronic warfare and underwater
capabilities.</p>
<p>Campbell added that other countries have expressed interest in
participating in AUKUS when the time was right.</p>
<p>“I think you’ll hear that we have something to say about that next
week,” he said.</p>
<p>Trilateral summit next</p>
<p>Next week, U.S. President Joe Biden will host a trilateral summit
with Japan and the Philippines. Biden will also have a bilateral summit
with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.</p>
<p>Campbell said the summit with Japan is expected to “historically”
upgrade security cooperation relations, including the joint development
of defense supplies.</p>
<p>According to Nikkei Asia, Campbell revealed on March 21 that the
U.S.-Japan talks are expected to discuss technical cooperation between
Japan and AUKUS.</p>
<p>According to the report, Campbell said Japan had made it “very clear”
that it had no interest in participating in the AUKUS nuclear-powered
submarine project. But, he said, “there are clearly areas that Japan
could bring substantial capacity to bear in security and technological
pursuits that advance common goals in the Indo-Pacific.”</p>
<p>Campbell told Nikkei Asia that those areas include advanced robotics,
cyber initiatives and some work in anti-submarine warfare.</p>
<p>At Wednesday’s event, Campbell noted that several countries in the
Indo-Pacific region are undertaking critical research and development in
areas Pillar 2 focuses on, including hypersonic capabilities, long-range
strikes, undersea capabilities and cyber.</p>
<p>AUKUS to JAUKUS?</p>
<p>As China’s provocative actions have escalated in recent years, AUKUS
has begun to set its sights on more countries.</p>
<p>During a “2+2” meeting between Japan and Australia in December 2022,
Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles said that AUKUS could involve
Japan.</p>
<p>In August 2023, the Foreign Affairs Committee of the British House of
Commons stated that AUKUS should invite Japan and South Korea to
join.</p>
<p>Last November, former Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso suggested
during a visit to Australia that Japan join the group, which could be
named JAUKUS. He said that would help send a unified signal on the
Taiwan issue.</p>
<p>Australia and New Zealand also raised the possibility of New Zealand
joining the second pillar of AUKUS after a ministerial meeting between
the two countries in February.</p>
<p>Malcolm Davis, a senior analyst in defense strategy and capability at
the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, or ASPI, said the second
pillar of AUKUS could draw on the strengths of Japan, New Zealand,
Canada and even South Korea, but not necessarily as full members.</p>
<p>“Rather than bringing in these states as full AUKUS members, it’s
better to bring them in on a project-by-project basis within pillar two
areas of priority — for example, robotics and A.I., autonomous systems,
advanced undersea warfare, electronic warfare, quantum technologies, and
hypersonics,” Davis told VOA via email.</p>
<p>“It also opens up opportunities to add in some new priority areas —
for example, space-related areas, where these states can make a great
contribution.”</p>
<p>Bronte Munro, an analyst in the ASPI office in Washington, told VOA
that Japan is an increasingly suitable candidate for joining AUKUS,
noting major changes in its defense policy in response to the perceived
Chinese threat. These include amendments to laws prohibiting the export
of lethal weapons.</p>
<p>Munro said Japan’s manufacturing of advance semiconductors is
critical for technology leadership, and the inclusion of Japan can help
“secure semiconductor supply chains more explicitly for AUKUS
partners.”</p>
<p>However, there are doubts in some circles about the wisdom of
expanding AUKUS in view of the risks involved in sharing and
transferring advanced technologies.</p>
<p>Andrew Hastie, the shadow defense minister of the Australian
opposition party, told the U.S. media outlet Breaking Defense on March
28 that AUKUS’ focus should remain with the three countries already
involved to ensure a seamless “transfer of the very sensitive secrets
and intellectual property that’s involved with the heart of Pillar 1 and
Pillar 2.”</p>
<p>When asked at the CNAS event whether Japan has established a security
architecture to integrate into the second pillar of AUKUS, Campbell
pointed out that the U.S. has been involved in “a series of engagements
with Japan both on the intelligence side and in security spheres to
encourage Japan to take on increasingly more strenuous activities that
protect their intellectual property, that hold government officials
accountable for the secrets they are trusted with.”</p>
<p>“It’s fair to say that Japan has taken some of those steps, but not
all of them,” he said. “And we believe that ultimately, it is in our
interest to share as much information and other technologies … with
close partners like Japan to allow for a deeper, more fundamental
alliance,” said Campbell.</p>
<p>He announced that “One of the things that I think you’ll see next
week are steps, for the first time, that will allow the United States
and Japan to work more collaboratively on joint development and
potentially co-production of vital military and defense equipment.</p>
<p>“The U.S.-Japan Alliance is the cornerstone of our engagement in the
Indo-Pacific.”</p>

<h2 id="us-japan-philippines-eye-cooperation-on-south-china-sea">US,
Japan, Philippines eye cooperation on South China Sea</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — Planning is already underway for three-nation naval
patrols in the South China Sea ahead of a high-profile summit next week
among the leaders of the United States, Japan and the Philippines,
senior officials have said.</p>
<p>Philippine ambassador to the U.S. Jose Manuel Romualdez was quoted by
the Financial Times on Wednesday saying that Washington, Tokyo and
Manila are finalizing details of an agreement on the patrols, including
when to begin and how often they will take place.</p>
<p>The U.S. and the Philippines have conducted joint patrols in the
past, but this will be the first time Japan has participated. Both Japan
and the Philippines are treaty allies of the United States.</p>
<p>Asked about the plan, Pentagon spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Martin
Meiners told VOA’s Korean Service via email this week that the U.S. has
been concerned about “dangerous and destabilizing” actions in the region
and is “committed to maintaining deterrence, peace, and stability” with
its allies and partners.</p>
<p>Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell said the April 11 summit will
be an occasion for “an unprecedented trilateral engagement” among the
three countries that will lead to closer cooperation in the South China
Sea and elsewhere.</p>
<p>He made the remark Wednesday at an event hosted by the Center for a
New American Security in Washington.</p>
<p>A senior U.S. official said the three leaders will discuss what was
described as China’s “increasingly risky behavior” in the South China
Sea.</p>
<p>“We are increasingly concerned that the PRC’s [People’s Republic of
China’s] behavior in this space could lead us closer to really,
unintended consequences,” the official said at a background White House
press briefing this week.</p>
<p>“U.S. alliances and partnerships are not about China. … But
oftentimes, Chinese action motivates a lot — much of what we talk
about,” continued the official.</p>
<p>The most recent flare-up came on March 26 when the Chinese Coast
Guard used water cannon to prevent a Philippine vessel from conducting a
resupply mission to an outpost on a reef in waters within Manila’s
200-mile exclusive economic zone.</p>
<p>  White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told his
Philippine counterpart Eduardo Año on Monday that the U.S. supports the
Philippines against China’s “dangerous actions on March 26 obstructing a
lawful Philippine resupply mission to Second Thomas Shoal.”</p>
<p>Manila claims the shoal in the Spratly Islands as its own territory
and has been keeping the BRP Sierra Madre, a World War II-era navy
transport ship, grounded on the reef since late 1999.</p>
<p>Patrick Cronin, the Hudson Institute’s Asia-Pacific Security Chair,
told VOA via email on Tuesday that the trilateral maritime patrols can
provide “both a level of deterrence and a way of blocking Beijing’s
efforts to create de facto control over disputed waters and some areas
that clearly belong to the Philippines.”</p>
<p>He continued, “China will not desist from its ‘sovereignty
enforcement’ efforts, use of white hulls and maritime militia to impose
its domestic law on international waters, but it may have to shelve
staking further claims in the face of concerted opposition from the
three democracies.”</p>
<p>Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington,
told VOA via email on Wednesday that “the military cooperation between
the relevant countries must not interfere in South China Sea disputes,”
and called for the three allies to avoid actions that would “harm
China’s territorial sovereignty, maritime rights and interests and
security interests.”</p>
<p>Liu continued, “The South China Sea issue is a matter between China
and some ASEAN countries.”</p>
<p>Among ASEAN member states, the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and
Brunei are official claimants against China, whose claims to virtually
all of the resource-rich waters have been rejected by an international
tribunal.</p>
<p>  Prashanth Parameswaran, a fellow at the Wilson Center and founder
of the weekly ASEAN Wonk newsletter, told VOA on Tuesday, that “more
patrols by more countries is one of many ways to reinforce presence and
prevent the nightmare scenario of the South China Sea becoming a Chinese
lake.”</p>
<p>He continued, “In addition to alliance networking, the United States
and its partners will have to find ways to work with Southeast Asian
states which are not formal allies but are nonetheless critical in
addressing China’s assertiveness as well.”</p>

<h2 id="the-2-billion-plan-to-electrify-american-homes">The $2 Billion
Plan to Electrify American Homes</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-04, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTkyMTk2OC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczMjIyOTY4OH0.4eLLO9zXQiP34zMU72QyaVJe0ToPTKTuEcsMCRIZYjI/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Getting fossil fuels out of your home is really hard. You have to find a
contractor, ideally one who supports electrification and doesn’t ask why
you won’t just stick with natural gas. You have to coordinate between
multiple trades — electricians, plumbers, HVAC professionals — as well
as lenders and utilities and permitting authorities, most of whom don’t
talk to each other. You have to navigate a confusing array of finance
options and incentives. You might be left feeling defeated, unable to
afford the high up-front costs and unable to secure low-cost loans. And
if you’re a renter, all you can do is dream.
</p>
<p>
These are not easy problems to solve. But a new initiative called Power
Forward Communities has a pioneering plan to simplify the process all
over the country — and it just got $2 billion to get started.
</p>
<p>
The money is part of the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/the-biden-administration-is-unleashing-20-billion-for-green-banks" target="_self">$20
billion the Biden administration awarded on Thursday</a> via the
Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, a program approved as part of the
Inflation Reduction Act to provide low-cost financing options for
consumers, communities, and businesses to transition to clean energy and
adapt to climate change.
</p>
<p>
Power Forward Communities is made up of five core partner organizations
— Rewiring America, Enterprise Community Partners, Local Initiatives
Support Corporation, Habitat for Humanity, and United Way Worldwide —
who will work with communities, government agencies, unions, and housing
developers to decarbonize hundreds of thousands of homes and apartments
between now and 2031. The coalition has committed to invest at least 75%
of the financing in projects in low-income and disadvantaged
communities.
</p>
<p>
That all starts with a four point plan.
</p>
<p>
First, reduce friction by creating online tools and providing
community-level assistance to help homeowners navigate the
decarbonization process. Rewiring America is already part of the way
there with its
“<a href="https://homes.rewiringamerica.org/personal-electrification-planner" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">personal
electrification planner</a>,” which provides a rough estimate of the
upfront cost, annual bill savings, and expected emissions reductions for
any given project. Soon, the group will pair that with another,
first-of-its-kind tool: a
<a href="https://www.nodecollective.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dataset
of every electrification incentive in the country</a>. Eventually you’ll
be able to plug in your address and income and get a list of all of the
programs available to help you pay for your project.
</p>
<p>
Second, invest in workforce development and create a “contractor
marketplace” where building owners can go to find vetted partners for
their project.
</p>
<p>
Third, create new low-cost financial products to help bridge the gap
between existing incentives and project costs. Notably, Power Forward
plans to allocate more than half of its loans to projects in multifamily
buildings, as these buildings tend to serve renters with lower incomes,
and decarbonizing them is much more capital-intensive.
</p>
<p>
The details of the finance aspect of the program are subject to change,
but the group’s
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2024-04/pfc_narrative_proposal1.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">application
for the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund</a> proposes an energy efficiency
loan for apartment building owners who want to make minor upgrades,
which would offer an average of $30,000 per building with a 10- to
20-year term and 1% to 3% interest rate. As part of this program, Power
Forward would also work with the building owner to make a plan to fully
decarbonize the building down the line, and issue grants to fund the
planning process. A proposed “net-zero rehab permanent loan,” meanwhile,
would provide financing for full retrofits at an average of $120,000 per
building.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, the finance options for single-family homes could be tied to
predetermined “packages” of decarbonization measures that homeowners can
choose from. This brings me to the fourth, and what I see as the most
interesting and innovative part of the plan: the aggregation of demand.
</p>
<p>
Part of why electrification is so difficult and expensive is that it’s a
bespoke process. Some buildings might need insulation, others might need
electrical upgrades. Some might require new ductwork for central heat
pumps, while others might be better off installing mini-split heat pumps
in every zone of the house. There’s no one-size-fits-all solution.
</p>
<p>
“How do we unlock economies of scale and create an offering that could
serve as many households at once?,” Nicole Staple, the head of market
partnerships at Rewiring America, posed rhetorically to me in February.
“That has historically been incredibly challenging given there’s so much
customization to heat pump design.”
</p>
<p>
But there <em>are</em> buildings with similar needs. If there were a way
to identify them and then group the jobs together, you could start to
solve a surprising number of other challenges. “That’s where I think you
unlock a lot of speed in [electrifying] full communities,” said Staple.
</p>
<p>
The most obvious benefit would be lowering the cost of equipment by
buying in bulk. You could give suppliers better visibility into demand
so they could stock up accordingly. You could help contractors plan
ahead and space out jobs so that they have guaranteed work during the
shoulder seasons. You could create new markets for union labor, which
have historically been shut out from residential work due to the small
size of the contracts and high customer acquisition costs. You could
pool loans to diversify risk. You could design more effective policies
to wind down the natural gas system.
</p>
<p>
The standardized packages Power Forward plans to offer will enable the
group to “pre-define pricing and financial product offers, streamline
underwriting and installation, and reduce financing costs,” according to
its funding application. It estimates that by aggregating demand, it can
reduce the remaining costs of electrification after incentives by as
much as 50%.
</p>
<p>
The application also said the group has obtained letters of commitment
from supply chain participants, including Home Depot and Mitsubishi, to
lower equipment costs. In return, the coalition will reserve an initial
$125 million over the first three years of the program as an insurance
pool to guarantee $1 billion in sales volume for select partners.
</p>
<p>
To unlock all this magical potential, Rewiring America has been working
on a large-scale data model to identify homes with similar
characteristics, which will in turn help it figure out where there is
opportunity to bundle projects in different parts of the country.
</p>
<p>
The group has also been gathering information and testing out
assumptions on what will ultimately lower the costs of equipment and
installation in a series of pilot projects, starting with one in the
rural, mostly Black community of DeSoto, Georgia, where “107 households
survive on a median income of $20,375, grapple with repeated house fires
linked to propane gas usage, and strain to pay utility bills,” according
to Power Forward’s application.
</p>
<p>
When I spoke to Staple a couple of months ago, she told me that about 75
households in DeSoto had expressed interest in the program thus far.
Each participant would get at least one piece of equipment — a heat pump
space heating system or a water heater, for example — fully subsidized.
They would also be eligible for electrical upgrades or weatherization
improvements as needed.
</p>

Power Forward had initially requested $9.5 billion to implement its
plans, so it will have to go back to the drawing board over the next few
months to map out what it can achieve with the $2 billion it was given.
What could it have accomplished with that additional $7.5 billion?

id="blinken-urges-more-aid-for-ukraine-as-nato-increases-resourcing-efforts">Blinken
urges more aid for Ukraine as NATO increases resourcing efforts</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>state department — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on
Thursday that more aid is urgently needed for Ukraine following meetings
with NATO foreign ministers, amid growing concerns that Russia is
building up its defense industrial base with support from China, North
Korea and Iran.</p>
<p>“Based on what I heard today … everyone, including the United States,
is going to double back and, as necessary, double down on finding the
resources that Ukraine continues to need,” Blinken told reporters after
meetings with NATO foreign ministers at the alliance headquarters in
Brussels.</p>
<p>While individual NATO members have been providing arms to Ukraine,
the organization as a whole has concentrated on providing nonlethal aid
for fear of escalating tensions with Russia through a more direct
involvement.</p>
<p>“More than 30 countries now have signed or are in the process of
negotiating signing bilateral agreements with Ukraine, and we’re
ourselves, the United States, working on our own bilateral agreement,”
he said.</p>
<p>Earlier on Thursday, Blinken met with Ukrainian Foreign Minister
Dmytro Kuleba in Brussels, where the two discussed the situation on the
battlefield and ways to bolster Ukraine’s energy sector in light of
continued attacks from Russia.</p>
<p>The United States will host a NATO summit in Washington from July 9
to July 11. Blinken discussed priorities for the meeting with Kuleba as
NATO celebrates its 75th anniversary.</p>
<p>“Ukraine will become a member of NATO,” Blinken said. “Our purpose of
the summit is to help build a bridge to that membership and to create a
clear pathway for Ukraine moving forward.”</p>
<p>During Thursday’s press conference, Blinken also underlined the
urgency of the U.S. congressional action to vote on aid for Ukraine.</p>
<p>Congress has yet to approve the Biden administration’s supplementary
budget request that would resupply Ukraine’s armed forces and help the
country fend off Russian offensives.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden has called on the Republican-led U.S. House of
Representatives to approve the military and financial aid package. House
Republicans have delayed action on it for months, prioritizing domestic
issues.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the top U.S. diplomat held talks with NATO
Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on how to bolster the alliance’s
long-term military support for Ukraine.</p>
<p>This week, NATO foreign ministers met in Brussels to discuss a
proposal for creating a five-year fund, totaling about $108 billion, to
support Ukraine’s military.</p>
<p>The plan, put forward by Stoltenberg, includes making NATO more
directly involved in coordinating military assistance provided by member
countries — a role that has been filled by a U.S.-led coalition of more
than 50 countries.</p>
<p>A final decision on the proposal would not come until the NATO summit
in July. It requires consensus among its 32 members.</p>
<p>On Thursday, foreign ministers from the security bloc also met with
its partners from the Indo-Pacific.</p>
<p>“North Korea, China, Iran are supporting Russia’s war of aggression
in different ways, so this demonstrates that security is not regional
security, it’s truly global, and therefore it’s important that we work
together with our Asia-Pacific partners,” Stoltenberg said on
Wednesday.</p>

<h2 id="qt-6.7-qt-creator-13-released">Qt 6.7, Qt Creator 13
released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-04, from: OS News</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Qt 6.7 was released with a whole slew of new
features and improvements. Reading through the various highlights,
there’s further improvements to Qt Graphs, first released with Qt 6.6
and still under active development, better SVG support, variable fonts
and icon font support, and much more. There’s also a variety of new
examples and demo applications, and of course, Qt 6.7 supports all the
latest operating system releases. One feature that truly stood out to me
as something that I’m assuming will make Qt developers happy is improved
support for embedding native controls into Qt applications. On both
desktop and mobile platforms, applications often need to combine UI
elements from different technologies and frameworks. Qt uses and
integrates tightly with the native technologies on each platform to
create basic UI elements such as windows, and it has for a long time
been possible to use UI elements from other frameworks within a Qt
Widgets application. With Qt 6.7, we are now adding support
for embedding native windows into a Qt Quick scene as well. This allows
use of native controls such as AppKit’s MapView or a Windows media
player inside a Qt Quick UI, with correct positioning and stacking. By
layering windows, Qt Quick UI elements can be overlaid on top of the
native components as well. ↫ Volker Hilsheimer Alongside Qt 6.7, Qt
Creator 13 has also been released, which comes with its own set of
improvements and new features.</p>

<p>date: 2024-04-04, from: OS News</p>
<p>One area of AMD’s product portfolio that doesn’t get as much
attention as the desktop and server parts is their Embedded platform.
AMD’s Embedded series has been important for on-the-edge devices,
including industrial, automotive, healthcare, digital gaming machines,
and thin client systems. Today, AMD has unveiled their latest Embedded
architecture, Embedded+, which combines their Ryzen Embedded processors
based on the Zen+ architecture with their Versal adaptive SoCs onto a
single board. ↫ Gavin Bonshor at AnandTech Machines with these chips
will flood the used market a few years from now, and they’re going to be
great buys for all kinds of fun projects – and because the corporate
world buys these machines by the truckload, they show up on eBay at
impulse prices within years. Sometimes, you can even buy cheap whole
lots of these kinds of boxes. They often tend to be a little weird, and
come with features and trinkets normal computers don’t come with, which
is always good for some weekend fun. Cathode Ray Dude is currently doing
a series on these little things on YouTube, and there’s always something
weird to discover about what kind of odd features and design choices
these machines possess. If there’s interest from you, our lovely
readers, I can see if I can snatch up a few weird ones from eBay and
write about what kind of fun projects you can do with these. You can
usually run Linux on these, the embedded versions of Windows, and if
they’re not too weird, they could probably serve as a cheap Haiku box,
too.</p>

<p>
Americans might remain tepid on electric vehicles. But they are snapping
up conventional hybrids.
</p>
<p>
More than half of the Ford Maverick compact pickup trucks sold last
quarter had conventional hybrid engines, the automaker said on
Wednesday, a sign of how rapidly hybrids and plug-in hybrids are
ascending in the American car market.
</p>
<p>
Ford sold nearly 20,000 Maverick hybrids during the first three months
of 2024, 77% more than during the first quarter of 2023, the automaker
said. Those Mavericks made up the majority of the 38,421 hybrids that
Ford sold across its line-up last quarter.
</p>
<p>
“We listened to our customers and want to offer them freedom of choice,”
<a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/people/jim-baumbick.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jim
Baumbick</a>, the vice president of product development and operations
at Ford, told me in an exclusive interview. “Customers can do the math —
a lot of Maverick customers are very focused on value for money.”
</p>
<p>
The sales success comes as Ford, the domestic automaker that has been
most enthusiastic about EVs, has intensified its focus on conventional
and plug-in hybrids. On Thursday, Ford
<a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2024/04/04/ford-updates-timing-for-next-gen-evs--readies-manufacturing-plan.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a>
that it plans to offer a hybrid version of each of its gasoline-burning
vehicles by the end of the decade. The company recently added
<a href="https://fordauthority.com/2023/01/ford-maverick-assembly-plant-to-add-third-shift-this-july/amp/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an
additional shift</a> at its Hermosillo, Mexico, factory that makes
Maverick trucks, and it
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/12/hybrid-car-demand-ev-production/676266/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">doubled
the production</a> of full-size F-150 hybrid pickups.
</p>
<p>
In the same announcement, however, Ford also said it would push back the
launch of its next-generation electric vehicle, a new three-row electric
SUV, from 2025 to 2027. That suggests that the automaker’s current EV
offerings — the Ford Mustang Mach-E, F-150 Lightning, and Ford E-Transit
delivery van — will remain its flagship electric vehicles for much of
the rest of the decade.
</p>
<p>
“We know the destination: EVs are going to be a much bigger part of our
product portfolio in the future,” Baumbick said a day before the
announcement. “But we also know the tail on internal combustion-based
products is going to be much longer.”
</p>
<p>
On the one hand, Ford’s sudden success with hybrids is unsurprising.
Hybrids are a 20-year-old technology that cuts air pollution, saves on
gas costs, and can improve a car’s performance. While hybrids aren’t
nearly as good for the climate as purely electric vehicles, they can cut
carbon emissions without forcing customers to seek out or install
charging stations.
</p>
<p>
<br/>For those reasons, auto experts once predicted that hybrids would
percolate across the marketplace like, say, automatic transmission or
power steering — they were general-purpose features that would improve
any car. But instead they are only now catching on, <em>after </em>the
initial electric vehicle boom. Perhaps that’s because hybrids were long
seen as the green or environmentally premium choice, and only the
arrival of mainstream EVs has defanged hybrids as an option for more
drivers.
</p>
<p>
In the interview, Baumbick noted that adding a hybrid powertrain to a
Maverick or F-150 now adds only an extra $1,500 or so to a truck’s
suggested retail price. “Our goal from the getgo on Maverick was to take
a different approach, and it was all about the value. When we launched,
we were really trying to lean into attracting more customers to hybrids,
because we knew from all the research we had done that they were looking
for value. It was a bit of a departure from how we approached it before
as a premium offering.”
</p>
<p>
That idea of hybrids as premium persists elsewhere in the automaker’s
line-up. A conventional gas-burning Ford Escape plug-in hybrid can be
bought for as little as $29,495, for instance, while a plug-in hybrid
Escape has a suggested retail price of $40,500.
</p>
<p>
For what it’s worth, Ford also reported strong EV growth in the year’s
first quarter, but its raw EV sales totals are lower than its hybrid
sales. The company sold 20,223 electric vehicles during the year’s first
three months, an increase of 86% over the same period a year earlier.
</p>
<p>
The Mustang Mach-E, a family-friendly crossover that has emerged as the
automaker’s best-performing EV, made up about half of those deliveries;
its sales were up 77% over the year prior. The company also sold 7,743
F-150 Lightning models, 80% more than a year earlier. What’s not yet
clear is whether these better sales translated into financial returns.
The automaker lost tens of thousands of dollars for every EV that it
sold last year, and it
<a href="https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/ford/2024/01/03/2024-f150-lightning-ford-price-increase/72091023007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">slashed
the price of its most premium EVs</a> further at the beginning of 2024.
Ford will announce its quarterly earnings at the end of April.
</p>
<p>
Even as it has slowed its rollout of EVs, Ford has insisted that it
believes they represent its future. The very first line of its press
release on Thursday was: “Ford continues to invest in a broad set of EV
programs as it works to build a full EV line-up.” But in our
conversation, Baumbick compared the reasons a customer might buy a fully
electric versus a hybrid full-size F-150 pickup. “If their usage is best
suited to an EV, we’ve got an F-150 Lightning,” he said. But “if you’re
towing for higher distances or longer weights, it increases demand on
charging. That’s where a hybrid can be a perfect tool for the job.”
</p>
<p>
Here at Heatmap, we’ve
<a href="https://heatmap.news/plugin-ford-maverick-electric" target="_self">argued</a>
that Ford should add a plug-in hybrid Maverick to its lineup, too —
after all, the Maverick is built on the same underlying platform as the
Escape. A semi-electric compact pickup could be the “forever truck” for
many Millennials. So I asked Baumbick: With Ford now expanding its
hybrid offerings, is there any chance we’ll see a plug-in hybrid
Maverick anytime soon? He told me that the company doesn’t comment on
rumors or speculation. Hey — that’s better than a straight-up “no.”

<h2 id="us-must-care-for-migrant-children-in-camps-judge-says">US must
care for migrant children in camps, judge says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Migrant children who wait in makeshift camps along the
U.S.-Mexico border for Customs and Border Protection officers to process
them are in the agency’s custody and are subject to a long-standing
court-supervised agreement that set standards for their treatment, a
judge ruled.</p>
<p>The issue of when the children are officially in CPB custody is
particularly important because of the 1997 court settlement on how
migrant children in U.S. government custody must be treated. Those
standards include a time limit on how long the children can be held and
services such as toilets, sinks and temperature controls.</p>
<p>Wednesday’s ruling means the Department of Homeland Security must
quickly process the children and place them in facilities that are “safe
and sanitary.”</p>
<p>The border camps have become a flashpoint between immigrant advocates
and the federal government. The U.S. has said smugglers send migrants to
the camps and argued that the children are not yet in CPB custody
because they haven’t been arrested. Advocates say the U.S. government
has a responsibility for the children and that CBP often directs
migrants to the camps, sometimes even driving them there.</p>
<p>Children traveling alone must be turned over within 72 hours to the
U.S. Health and Human Services Department. That agency generally
releases them to family in the United States while an immigration judge
considers asylum. Asylum-seeking families are typically released in the
U.S. while their cases wind through courts.</p>
<p>“This is a tremendous victory for children at open air detention
sites, but it remains a tragedy that a court had to direct the
government to do what basic human decency and the law clearly require,”
Neha Desai, senior director of immigration at the National Center for
Youth Law, said in a statement. “We expect CBP to comply with the
court’s order swiftly, and we remain committed to holding CBP
accountable for meeting the most rudimentary needs of children in their
legal custody, including food, shelter, and basic medical care.”</p>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a
request for comment.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee’s decision could have far-reaching
implications because of the changing face of who is coming to the United
States. Decades ago, the typical person attempting to enter the U.S. was
an adult male from Mexico seeking work. Now, families with children are
increasingly making perilous journeys to the border seeking a new life.
Caring for children puts different stresses on federal agencies more
historically more geared toward adults.</p>
<p>The legal challenge focuses on two areas in California: one between
two border fences in San Diego and another in a remote mountainous
region east of San Diego. Migrants who cross the border illegally wait
under open skies or sometimes in tents or structures made of tree
branches while short on food and water. When the number of migrants was
particularly high last year, they waited for several days for CBP agents
to arrest and process them.</p>
<p>Gee ruled that the Customs and Border Protection’s juvenile
coordinator must maintain records on minors held in the agency’s custody
for more than 72 hours and that includes any time the minors spend in
the camps. The agency must make sure that the treatment of minors at
open-air sites complies with the 1997 agreement, Gee wrote.</p>
<p>Gee set a May 10 deadline for the juvenile coordinator to file an
interim report about the number of minors held in open-air sites and how
the agency was complying with the judge’s order.</p>

Republic of China R. Nicholas Burns, and Congressman Don Bacon. The
Board finds that this intrusion was preventable and should never have
occurred. The Board also concludes that Microsoft’s security culture was
inadequate and requires an overhaul, particularly in light of the
company’s centrality in the technology ecosystem and the level of trust
customers place in the company to protect their data and operations. ↫
Cyber Safety Review Board’s report The Cyber Safety Review Board
reviewed the attack on Microsoft Exchange from last year, with
Microsoft’s cooperation, and it turns out it was kind of a complete and
utter shitshow inside Microsoft – a cascade of failures, as the report
calls it – and concludes that it was an entirely preventable attack. The
report is not kind to Microsoft, and it’s a very interesting read if
you’re into this sort of post mortems of security breaches.</p>

rejects Trump free speech challenge to Georgia 2020 election case</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — A Georgia judge on Thursday rejected Donald Trump’s bid
to dismiss criminal charges in the state’s 2020 election interference
case against him, which the Republican former U.S. president argued
violate his free speech rights.</p>
<p>Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee found that the
indictment alleges statements by Trump and 14 others charged in the case
were made “in furtherance of criminal activity” and are not protected by
the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.</p>
<p>Trump and the other defendants have been charged with racketeering
and other offenses over their effort to overturn Trump’s defeat in
Georgia to Democratic President Joe Biden. They have pleaded not
guilty.</p>
<p>The case is one of four criminal prosecutions Trump faces as the
November 5 election nears. His first trial, related to hush money
payments to a porn star, is due to get underway in New York later this
month.</p>
<p>“President Trump and other defendants respectfully disagree with
Judge McAfee’s order and will continue to evaluate their options
regarding the First Amendment challenges,” Steve Sadow, Trump’s lead
lawyer on the Georgia case, said in a statement.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office,
which is prosecuting the case, declined to comment.</p>
<p>The Georgia charges focus on attempts to assemble an alternate slate
of presidential electors pledged to vote for Trump despite Biden’s win
in the state, and Trump’s January 2021 phone call urging the state’s top
election official to “find” enough votes to overturn his narrow
defeat.</p>
<p>McAfee’s ruling is a signal he will continue moving the case toward
trial even as Trump and eight co-defendants continue their efforts to
disqualify Fani Willis, the prosecutor overseeing the case. A Georgia
appeals court is set to decide whether to take up that issue in the
coming weeks.</p>
<p>McAfee said it will be up to a jury to determine if Trump and other
defendants, which include his former personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and
former Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, acted with criminal intent.  </p>
<p>He said the defendants may be able to revive their challenge as
additional evidence is revealed.  </p>
<p>Trump has other pending challenges to the case, including a claim
that he is immune from charges tied to official actions he took as
president.</p>

<h2 id="biden-heralds-75th-anniversary-of-natos-founding">Biden heralds
75th anniversary of NATO’s founding</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>White House — President Joe Biden welcomed NATO’s 75th anniversary
Thursday, as the security alliance hosted new member Sweden for the
first time at a major meeting — and as Ukraine eagerly hopes for an
invitation to join the group at an upcoming Washington summit.</p>
<p>In a statement, Biden welcomed the recent addition of new members
Finland and Sweden, saying “we must choose to protect this progress and
build on it.”</p>
<p>“This is the greatest military alliance in the history of the world,”
Biden said. “But it didn’t happen by accident, nor was it inevitable.
Generation after generation, the United States and our fellow Allies
have chosen to come together to stand up for freedom and push back
against aggression — knowing we are stronger, and the world is safer,
when we do.”</p>
<p>Biden’s Democratic allies agreed.</p>
<p>“Despite [Russian President Vladimir] Putin’s attempts to splinter
our alliance with his war against Ukraine, the transatlantic partnership
is more united than ever before, thanks to the determined leadership of
Joe Biden,” said former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. “On this monumental
anniversary, we reaffirm that America’s commitment to NATO remains
bipartisan and ironclad — and that we will never waver in our defense of
democracy.”</p>
<p>NATO allies have been increasingly unnerved by the prospect of former
Republican President Donald Trump returning to the White House if he
defeats Biden in the November 5 U.S. presidential election.</p>
<p>As president, Trump frequently complained that numerous NATO
countries were not meeting NATO’s recommendation that they spend 2% of
their country’s economic output on defense.</p>
<p>In February, at a campaign rally, Trump recounted what he said was a
conversation he had when he was the U.S. leader with the “president of a
big country.”</p>
<p>“Well sir, if we don’t pay, and we’re attacked by Russia — will you
protect us?” Trump quoted the unnamed leader as saying.</p>
<p>“I said: ‘You didn’t pay? You’re delinquent.’</p>
<p>He said: ‘Yes, let’s say that happened.’</p>
<p>’No, I would not protect you.,” said Trump. “In fact, I would
encourage them [Russia] to do whatever the hell they want. You got to
pay.’”</p>
<p>The NATO countries’ pledge to defend each other has been invoked only
once, when al-Qaida terrorists attacked the U.S. in 2001, killing nearly
3,000 people.</p>
<p>The U.S. and its allies responded with a two-decade fight against the
militants’ training sites and encampments in Afghanistan although
Taliban rulers remained in power as Biden pulled out the last U.S.
troops in 2021.</p>
<p>Some analysts argue that the alliance remains relevant, citing
Russia’s aggression in Ukraine.</p>
<p>“Nearly a billion people sleep more soundly at night under NATO’s
protective umbrella,” said Robert Benson, a senior policy analyst at the
Center for American Progress, in a message sent to VOA.</p>
<p>“Yet a small but vocal minority views the alliance as a relic of the
past, an albatross, or a distraction — all this in a world where Russian
imperial ambition has once again threatened international peace and
security,” he said. “The United States must continue to support Ukraine
and to strengthen NATO, not out of charity or moral obligation, but
because it makes us safer here at home.”</p>
<p>Sean Monaghan, a foreign affairs analyst at the Center for Strategic
and International Studies in Washington, told VOA that he does not
expect NATO to offer Ukraine a formal invitation to join the military
alliance when it holds its 75th anniversary summit in Washington in
July.</p>
<p>The allies agreed last year at NATO’s summit in Vilnius, Lithuania,
not to invite Ukraine until its war with Russia has ended.</p>
<p>“When the time is right,” Monaghan said, “NATO allies and Ukraine
will want to move quickly from invitation to membership to avoid a
drawn-out period where Ukraine is at risk of coercion but not protected”
by the NATO treaty provision that all countries must defend each other
if they are attacked.</p>
<p>“The summit is likely to focus on boosting long-term support for
Ukraine, including through NATO auspices,” Monaghan said.</p>

If you survey Americans who are considering an electric vehicle, some of
their opinions are perfectly predictable. New
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/03/ev-buyers-want-suvs-and-sedans-not-minivans-or-trucks-survey-says/" target="_blank">polling</a>
released last week by the car publication Edmunds found that U.S. car
shoppers want more range, they want more affordable options, and they
want lots of SUVs and crossovers. Few respondents were excited about
electric pickup trucks. Hardly anybody — just 5% — wanted a minivan

posting thirsty #MinivanLife pics of a Chrysler Town &amp; Country.
People are importing

Japanese microvans</a> and embracing other oddball shapes to stand out
against a world full of Toyota RAV4s. Yet, despite ongoing rumblings
about a
<a href="https://www.carscoops.com/2023/08/opinion-the-minivan-comeback-makes-total-sense/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">comeback</a>,
the true minivan remains mired in tired stereotypes: It is the dorky
dadmobile that appears in your driveway the day you buy a white pair of
New Balance sneakers.
</p>
<p>
The thing is, a minivan is exactly what people want. And in the EV age,
it could get even better.
</p>
<p>
Heatmap’s Shift Key podcast recently
<a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-episode-8-rivian-minivans" target="_self">compared</a>
the biological concept of carcinization — the way
<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-do-animals-keep-evolving-into-crabs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">everything
wants to become a crab</a> — to the convergent evolution of cars. In
Robinson Meyer’s metaphor, automotive designs keep coming back to the
minivan. After all, it has the primary features most families seek,
namely three-row seating and lots of cargo space for kid stuff. But
because the minivan is a loathed emblem of domesticity, carmakers
continue to disguise its function in other forms.
</p>
<p>
This has been going on for generations. The bulbous station wagon,
effectively a shorter minivan,
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/04/heres-why-its-high-time-for-a-minivan-renaissance/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">was
once</a> the country’s de facto family car. Its parental uncoolness led
to the rise of the minivan — which then became loaded with its own
“soccer mom” cultural baggage and fell out of favor. In the 1990s,
parents in search of a hipper, rugged alternative embraced the
squared-off SUV instead. Three decades later, those boxes on wheels have
mostly morphed into the rounded crossovers that dominate the roads today
— vehicles that are, fundamentally, just minivans stretched into a shape
that shouts, “I am anything but.”
</p>
<p>
Tastes change, of course. And if Americans are going to switch to
electric cars, then it’s imperative the car companies electrify the
vehicles they want. The problem with the never-ending SUV-crossover
craze is that minivans are objectively better for the lives we actually
lead.
</p>
<p>
A minivan handles better because it generally has a lower center of
gravity than high-riding SUVs, which were built as if their owners were
going to ford a riverbed on the way to their middle child’s
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=451489140488780" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">xylophone
recital</a>. This is one reason car journalists have continued to praise
the minivan over the years even as car buyers have spurned them.
</p>

that make them better family cars than crossovers are. They’re roomy.
They’re easy to get into and out of, especially when you’re loading or
unloading children or car seats. The sliding doors prevent your
offspring from dinging the next car over in the parking lot.

But because minivans have only a cult following these days and don’t
sell big numbers, the electrified options are few. Online discussions
about the best EV family car often come back to the plug-in hybrid
Chrysler Pacifica because three-row EV crossovers are still rare and the

It’s too bad, because vans are great and could get even better via
electrification. A long, heavy battery slung along the bottom of a van
will add to its low center of gravity while providing a large number of
kilowatt-hours. The voluminous cargo space inside EV minivans (and
full-size vans like the electric
<a href="https://insideevs.com/reviews/707294/mercedes-esprinter-first-drive-review/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sprinter</a>)
will give small businesses a way to decarbonize. A fun bonus of EV life
is being able to use the battery’s electricity to power the climate
control and other accessories without having to run a combustion engine
the whole time. That makes it easier to keep the whole family happy even
if you’re waiting in the parking lot, and it will make the cabin an
enjoyable place to kill time once AI starts doing all the driving.
(There is one big problem still to be solved: making a minivan’s
fold-flat seats, a game-changing feature, work when there’s a big
battery down there.)
</p>
<p>
As we recently noted, the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/best-ev-family-tesla-model-y-kia-ev9" target="_self">family-car-sized
hole</a> in the EV market is starting to be filled in. The Kia EV9 has
introduced a true three-row crossover EV to the U.S., and more like it
will soon follow. It stands to reason that, eventually, today’s minivan
standards like the Toyota Sienna and Honda Odyssey will electrify
alongside everything else, creating a battery-powered offering for the
small but growing
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/02/success/minivans-cool-again/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">niche</a>
populated by van people.
</p>
<p>
Still, the minivan deserves better. Perhaps when its EV version finally
arrives, drivers will get bored of the conformist crossover and realize
that the electric van can.

<h2 id="marine-protected-areas-boost-local-economies-study-finds">Marine
protected areas boost local economies, study finds</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Banning fishing and other human activity in marine
protected areas (MPAs) has long pitted environmentalists against fishing
interests, but a new study shows that nearby fisheries benefit from
these areas.</p>
<p>The study comes as the United States considers establishing the
world’s largest MPA in the Pacific Ocean southwest of Hawaii, waters
where “fishing remains a major contributor to food security … and income
generation,” according to a review by the science journal BMC Public
Health. </p>
<p>Mark Costello, a professor of biosciences and aquaculture at Norway’s
Nord University and the study’s author, reviewed 51 studies of MPAs. He
found that 39 of them showed increased catch in adjacent fisheries since
their MPA designation. </p>
<p>The National Geographic Society estimates that approximately 5,000
MPAs exist worldwide, covering 0.8% of the world’s oceans. </p>
<p>Costello says the study’s data provides economic incentives for the
Conference of Parties Global Biodiversity Framework goal set in 2022 of
preserving 30% of the ocean by 2030.  </p>
<p>“If we think of [MPAs] as a benefit to fisheries, this completely
changes the conversation from setting aside 30% that nobody can do
anything with to actually 30% that is like having money in the bank,”
Costello said in an interview with VOA via Zoom on March 27.</p>
<p>He said traditional Indigenous communities often protect certain
areas so fish can spawn because they want to be sure that fish are
available “in a time of maybe crisis due to other food supplies not
being available.” </p>
<p>Fish in protected areas “grow older, they’ll have more eggs, and
they’ll spill over to the adjacent areas. So, you get those benefits,”
Costello added.</p>
<p>Last year, the United States took a big step in trying to meet that
30% goal.</p>
<p>In March 2023, U.S. President Joe Biden proposed a marine sanctuary
in the remote Pacific islands of nearly 2 million square kilometers,
saying it would be “the largest protected ocean area on the planet.”</p>
<p>The Marine Conservation Institute’s Marine Protection Atlas shows the
Ross Sea Region MPA as the largest MPA covering 1.9 million square
kilometers.</p>
<p>Biden’s proposed MPA is bigger than the 1.5 million-square-kilometer
reserve President Barack Obama established in 2016, a sanctuary that
dwarfed and included the 300,000-square-kilometer sanctuary established
by President George W. Bush in 2009 to protect parts of three remote
Pacific island chains that are U.S. possessions.</p>
<p>Biden’s proposal has met with pushback in the Pacific Islands, where
residents felt there wasn’t enough time for public input on a permanent
change to their fishery access. </p>
<p>“When you are trying to create something in perpetuity … 45 days to
take that away from a people is not enough,” said J.D. Tenorio, a
resident of Saipan who spoke at a May 18, 2023, public meeting held in
the Northern Mariana Islands, a U.S. territory. </p>
<p>According to the Marine Protection Atlas, two of the three largest
MPAs are in the Pacific. They include fishing grounds off the coast of
Hawaii, as well as the U.S. territories of Guam, the Northern Mariana
Islands and the Marshall Islands. </p>
<p>Costello says not all MPAs are permanent, adding it is important to
consider the idea of reviewing the MPA designations.</p>
<p>“Maybe everything should be relooked at in 20 years’ time,” he said.
“The next generation should have a say.”</p>
<p>Ray Hilborn is a University of Washington professor in the School of
Aquatic and Fishery Sciences who serves on the Western Pacific Regional
Fishery Management Council, which covers Hawaii, the territories of
American Samoa and Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana
Islands, and several Pacific Remote Island Areas. </p>
<p>The council opposes Biden’s proposed sanctuary, and Hilborn says MPAs
are not a “silver bullet” for conservation in the Pacific region.</p>
<p>“Most of the MPAs in the world are being created in countries that
have good fisheries management, like the United States, like Australia,
like New Zealand, like Canada, and those benefits are not going to
happen in those places,” he said in a Zoom interview with VOA on March
27.</p>
<p>Hilborn also said MPAs can hurt the fishing industry, especially when
implemented in areas where overfishing is not an issue, as is the case
for the Biden administration’s sanctuary proposal.</p>
<p>He cites a study published in the May 2020 edition of Marine Policy
on the expansion of the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument in
2016. It concludes that the MPA designation triggered a drop of 7% in
catch per unit of effort and a decrease of revenue per fishing trip by
9%, or $3.5 million during the first 16 months after it was enacted in
June 2006.</p>
<p>Hilborn said the Costello study supports an “illusion that you’re
really protecting” the ocean, but “the real protection comes by action.
And those actions are regulating fisheries [and] reducing bycatch” — the
fish caught by fleets that crews can’t sell, don’t want or are not
allowed to keep.</p>

<p>date: 2024-04-04, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
What does ActivityPub does that RSS doesn’t?
</p>
<p>
Off the top of my head, it’s not the ability to syndicate, RSS already
does that. I can follow anyone on any server.
</p>
<p>
I think it’s the timeline? And the ability to delete posts. Keeping all
that in sync is a lot of work, and presumably a lot of traffic?
</p>
<p>
Also replies. If I reply to a post when viewing it on another server,
the reply should show up under any other view of that post.
</p>
<p>
What else??
</p>
<p>
PS: Only thinking about features that are used by Mastodon to federate,
not potential future features. If that were the rule, then RSS could do
anything AP could do, right – because you can always add the feature.
So, just the features that are in use.

Bolivia’s losses came mainly from fires that were initially set by
humans but that grew out of control in exceptionally hot and dry
conditions. Agriculture expansion is another major driver of losses.
Overall, tropical forest loss last year hit 3.7 million hectares, which
is like losing 10 soccer fields per minute. This deforestation resulted
in 2.4 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide being released into the atmosphere.
For comparison, that’s about half the total annual emissions produced by
the entire United States. The report also looks at tree cover outside
the tropics, and finds that Canada’s devastating wildfires increased
global tree cover loss by 24%.

Another justification included the alleged connection between the regime

terrorist attacks. –

thousands more … –

<p>
300,000 dead after the original incident killed 2,977 is more than
100:1.

<p>
The two seem somehow related, I just can’t put it into words. High tech
weapons against civilians, drones, city warfare, a population that hates
the invader, news so terrible I can’t even finish reading the Wikipedia
articles.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and out of curiosity, I had to look up the situation in Ukraine,
too.

<p>
Ukrainian forces: ~70,000 killed, 100,000–120,000 wounded (US estimates)
… Russian forces: ~120,000 killed, 170,000–180,000 wounded (US
estimates) … the United Nations confirmed that by 31 January 2024,
10,378 civilians had been killed and 19,632 had been injured, but said

<p>
Vice President Kamala Harris and EPA administrator Michael Regan are in
Charlotte, North Carolina this morning to announce the award of … wait
for it … <em>$20 billion</em> <em>dollars</em> for climate mitigation
and adaptation projects. This is the official launch of the Greenhouse
Gas Reduction Fund, a $27 billion program that was part of the Inflation
Reduction Act — in fact, it is the single largest and most flexible
program in the IRA. (The remaining $7 billion is earmarked for
“<a href="https://www.epa.gov/greenhouse-gas-reduction-fund/solar-all" target="_blank">Solar
for All</a>,” a separate initiative that will launch later this
year.)<br/>
</p>
<p>
The money will go to eight organizations and help “create a national
clean financing network for clean energy and climate solutions.” The
awardees include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The Coalition for Green Capital, a nonprofit that got $5 billion to help
leverage a network of green lenders. More than 50% of its work under the
grant will be aimed at low-income communities.
</li>
<li>
Rewiring America, which will share a $2 billion award with four other
housing and community-building groups, including Enterprise Community
Partners, LISC (Local Initiatives Support Corporation), Habitat for
Humanity, and United Way to create a national financing program to
decarbonize housing. The initiative will focus 75% of its investments in
low-income and disadvantaged communities.
</li>
<li>
Community Preservation Corporation, a U.S. Treasury Department-certified
community development financial institution and part of an umbrella
coalition known as the Climate United Fund. Together with other
nonprofit financial institutions, it will receive nearly $7 billion to
lend to traditionally underserved populations, including rural and
Tribal communities.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The general idea is to funnel the money into green lending programs,
colloquially known as “green banks,” that will offer low-cost loans and
other financing options for consumers, community organizations,
businesses, and local governments. Projects financed through the fund
could do everything from residential electrification, to green public
transit, to solar on schools, to storm water management.
</p>
<p>
EPA anticipates the awardees will mobilize $7 of private capital for
every $1 of federal funds — a total investment of nearly $150 billion.
Each of the winners will get access to their share of the funding in the
next six months, and will have until 2031 to use it.

House shows no indication of restricting weapons for Israel</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — U.S. weapons sales to Israel have been under increased
scrutiny amid outrage over the reported deaths of tens of thousands of
people in Gaza since the start of the war, including seven aid workers
killed in an Israeli airstrike this week.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden said in a statement on Tuesday that he was
“outraged and heartbroken” by the deaths, his latest stern rebuke of
Israel’s war conduct.</p>
<p>Israel said the strike was “unintentional” and promised an
investigation.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Biden ignored questions about whether he would put
conditions on U.S. military aid. His aides suggest the administration is
unlikely to do so, citing U.S. support for Israel’s right to defend
itself against the “still viable threat” from Hamas.</p>
<p>The administration will wait for results of Israel’s investigation,
National Security Council communications adviser John Kirby told
reporters Wednesday. “I’m not going to get ahead of decisions that
haven’t been made yet,” he said.</p>
<p>In an interview with Reuters on Wednesday, World Central Kitchen
founder Jose Andres accused Israel of targeting the group’s food convoy
“systematically, car by car.” He said he had established clear
communication with the Israeli military about his aid workers’
movements.</p>
<p>Andres is a celebrity chef who is well-known in Washington. That and
the fact that the victims included U.S.-Canadian citizen Jacob
Flickinger has added a new level of outrage, including among lawmakers
of Biden’s own Democratic Party, and renewed demands that the president
condition military aid to Israel.</p>
<p>“Israel has killed more than 200 aid workers in 6 months. That’s not
an accident. No more aid for Netanyahu’s war machine,” Democratic
Senator Bernie Sanders said in a social media post Tuesday.</p>
<p>Weapons transfer</p>
<p>Israel is the largest recipient of U.S. aid, nearly $4 billion a
year, most of it in the form of military assistance.</p>
<p>Under U.S. law, the administration must notify Congress of weapons
transfers to Israel that are worth more than $25 million.</p>
<p>In December, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken approved two
emergency weapons transfers to Israel, bypassing the congressional
review requirement for foreign military sales.</p>
<p>Since the October 7 Hamas attack, two additional transfers have been
made public, said Josh Paul, former director at the State Department
agency that handles weapons transfers, who resigned in October in
protest over the U.S.’s “continued lethal assistance to Israel.”</p>
<p>Those two were made under the direct commercial sales process and
Congress was notified, Paul told VOA. “But with less visibility, because
there is less information that is provided to the public on direct
commercial sales,” he said.</p>
<p>In addition to the four that were made public, since October 7 more
than 100 arms transfers to Israel have taken place without informing
Congress, mainly because the packages were structured to fall below the
notification threshold, according to reporting by The Washington Post,
which VOA confirmed with a Department of Defense official who spoke on
condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>Ari Tolany, director of security assistance, arms trade and
technology at the Center for International Policy, said the moves amount
to a “deliberate dodge of transparency” by the administration.</p>
<p>“When they are publicly saying that Israel needs to take more steps
to protect civilians but privately pushing through hundreds of millions
of dollars’ worth of weapons, there’s really no credibility,” she told
VOA.</p>
<p>The Biden administration refuses to use the most significant source
of leverage it has, she said, which is “the massive amount of arms
provided to Israel.”</p>
<p>The Post reported that the transfers included billions of dollars in
bombs and fighter jets in recent weeks, even as the administration
publicly criticized Israel’s intention for a ground invasion of Rafah,
where 1.5 million displaced Palestinians seek safety.</p>
<p>Unconditional support</p>
<p>Since Harry Truman recognized Israel minutes after its founding in
1948, American presidents have supported the country.</p>
<p>Almost all have done so unconditionally, with the exception of
President George H.W. Bush, who in 1991 gave Israel an ultimatum to
freeze settlements on Palestinian land in exchange for $10 billion in
loan guarantees.</p>
<p>That approach worked. But not all agree that restricting aid will
effect change.</p>
<p>“The emotive issue of providing for a country’s means for their own
defense can sometimes trigger different responses in different theaters.
It’s just been a sort of inexact tool for the U.S in the past,” said
Grant Rumley, a senior fellow specializing in military and security
affairs at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.</p>
<p>“I think that’s internalized within this administration right now,”
he told VOA. “That, coupled with the president’s long-standing
commitment to Israel, is why you haven’t seen any real steps taken on
this route.”</p>
<p>There is also the fear that putting conditions on aid may send the
wrong signal to Hezbollah and other Iranian proxies, increasing the
prospects of opening a second front to the conflict at Israel’s northern
border with Lebanon.</p>
<p>In March, to meet the Biden administration’s requirement set out in
February, Israel provided assurances that American weapons are used in
accordance with international and humanitarian law, which the
administration accepted.</p>
<p>Those assurances are “not credible,” said Human Rights Watch and
Oxfam. The rights groups submitted examples of what they call Israeli
violations of international humanitarian law, including “deprivation of
services critical to the survival of the civilian population, and
arbitrary denial and restrictions of humanitarian aid.”</p>
<p>Eighty Muslim and Arab American organizations sent a similar letter
to Biden on Wednesday, objecting to his “administration’s decisions to
falsely declare that Israel’s war on Gaza complies with U.S. legal
requirements and authorize the continued transfer of U.S.-manufactured
weapons.”</p>
<p>The groups cited the attacks on the World Central Kitchen aid workers
as the latest example of Israel’s violation of the laws of war.</p>

federal report rips Microsoft for response to Chinese hack</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BOSTON — In a scathing indictment of Microsoft corporate security and
transparency, a Biden administration-appointed review board issued a
report Tuesday saying “a cascade of errors” by the tech giant let
state-backed Chinese cyber operators break into email accounts of senior
U.S. officials including Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo.</p>
<p>The Cyber Safety Review Board, created in 2021 by executive order,
describes shoddy cybersecurity practices, a lax corporate culture and a
lack of sincerity about the company’s knowledge of the targeted breach,
which affected multiple U.S. agencies that deal with China.</p>
<p>It concluded that “Microsoft’s security culture was inadequate and
requires an overhaul” given the company’s ubiquity and critical role in
the global technology ecosystem. Microsoft products “underpin essential
services that support national security, the foundations of our economy,
and public health and safety.”</p>
<p>The panel said the intrusion, discovered in June by the State
Department and dating to May, “was preventable and should never have
occurred,” and it blamed its success on “a cascade of avoidable errors.”
What’s more, the board said, Microsoft still doesn’t know how the
hackers got in.</p>
<p>The panel made sweeping recommendations, including urging Microsoft
to put on hold adding features to its cloud computing environment until
“substantial security improvements have been made.”</p>
<p>It said Microsoft’s CEO and board should institute “rapid cultural
change,” including publicly sharing “a plan with specific timelines to
make fundamental, security-focused reforms across the company and its
full suite of products.”</p>
<p>In a statement, Microsoft said it appreciated the board’s
investigation and would “continue to harden all our systems against
attack and implement even more robust sensors and logs to help us detect
and repel the cyber-armies of our adversaries.”</p>
<p>In all, the state-backed Chinese hackers broke into the Microsoft
Exchange Online email of 22 organizations and more than 500 individuals
around the world — including the U.S. ambassador to China, Nicholas
Burns — accessing some cloud-based email boxes for at least six weeks
and downloading some 60,000 emails from the State Department alone, the
34-page report said. Three think tanks and foreign government entities,
including a number of British organizations, were among those
compromised, it said.</p>
<p>The board, convened by Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas
in August, accused Microsoft of making inaccurate public statements
about the incident — including issuing a statement saying it believed it
had determined the likely root cause of the intrusion “when, in fact, it
still has not.” Microsoft did not update that misleading blog post,
published in September, until mid-March, after the board repeatedly
asked if it planned to issue a correction, it said.</p>
<p>Separately, the board expressed concern about a separate hack
disclosed by the Redmond, Washington, company in January, this one of
email accounts — including those of an undisclosed number of senior
Microsoft executives and an undisclosed number of Microsoft customers —
and attributed to state-backed Russian hackers.</p>
<p>The board lamented “a corporate culture that deprioritized both
enterprise security investments and rigorous risk management.”</p>
<p>The Chinese hack was initially disclosed in July by Microsoft in a
blog post and carried out by a group the company calls Storm-0558. That
same group, the panel noted, has been engaged in similar intrusions —
compromising cloud providers or stealing authentication keys so it can
break into accounts — since at least 2009, targeting companies including
Google, Yahoo, Adobe, Dow Chemical and Morgan Stanley.</p>
<p>Microsoft noted in its statement that the hackers involved are
“well-resourced nation state threat actors who operate continuously and
without meaningful deterrence.”</p>
<p>The company said that it recognized that recent events “have
demonstrated a need to adopt a new culture of engineering security in
our own networks,” and added that it had “mobilized our engineering
teams to identify and mitigate legacy infrastructure, improve processes,
and enforce security benchmarks.”</p>

<p>date: 2024-04-04, from: Max Halford Blog</p>
<p>Last night I went to a Toulouse Data Science meetup. The talks were
about generative AI and information retrieval, which aren’t topics I’m
knowledgeable about. However, one of the speakers was a friend of mine,
so I went to support him. Toulouse is my hometown, so I bumped into a
few people I knew. It was a nice evening. I chatted with an old office
mate from when I interned at INSA Toulouse.</p>
