<h2 id="faqs-are-not-the-answer">FAQs are not the answer</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-30, from: Blog by Fabrizio Ferri-Benedetti</p>
<p>
Everybody loves to hate Frequently Asked Questions, or FAQs. More often
than not, technical writers pale and stagger at the sight of hefty,
unsorted FAQs, as if they were beholding a writhing mass of primal
chaos. Others value their pragmatic qualities: FAQs, they say, lower the
bar to contribution and are good fuel for LLMs and search engines. My
opinion is that FAQs pose a problem only when there’s no strategy around
their usage.

<p>I wasn't clear enough yesterday. We're losing the word "podcast" very
quickly. It's coming to mean video interviews on YouTube. Our only hope
is upgrading the open platform in a way that stimulates the imagination
of creators, and there's no time to waste.</p>

Our website has a new look! The illustrated algae-eared rabbit nav
helped solve the problem of navigating on mobile. We added a lot of
information to this wiki over the years, creating separate portals for
its evergrowing content was inevitable, we hope you like the re-design.
Some of the content has shifted, and we’ve simplified many of the pages.

<p>
A couple of folks on
<a href="https://merveilles.town" target="_blank">Merveilles</a> got
together recently and made a Diablo Tribute tape. A limited run of
physical cassettes are currently in production, but in the meantime the

<p>date: 2024-11-29, from: Liliputing</p>
<p>
Mini PCs can serve a variety of purposes. There are high-performance
models that you can use as a full-fledged desktop or even gaming PC.
There are fanless models that can be used as silent media players,
digital signage systems, file servers, or network utilities. And there
are pocket-sized models that you can easily hide behind […]

<p>date: 2024-11-29, from: Liliputing</p>
<p>
Amazon’s Fire tablets offer a lot of bang for the buck. With list prices
starting as low as $60, they’re far cheaper than any iPad, and more
affordable than most tablets from companies like Samsung, Google, or
Lenovo. Amazon’s tablets also go on sale for even lower prices at least
a few times a year […]

<p>date: 2024-11-29, from: Liliputing</p>
<p>
The first MSI Claw handheld gaming PC wasn’t very well received when it
launched earlier this year as the first (and only) model in the space to
feature an Intel Meteor Lake processor and Intel Arc integrated
graphics. But MSI has promised that the company’s next-gen models would

<p>date: 2024-11-29, from: Liliputing</p>
<p>
The Lenovo Legion Go has proven to be a relatively popular handheld
gaming PC since shortly after it first launched a year ago. But with
list prices starting at $700, it’s not exactly the most affordable
option around. So it’s unsurprising that Lenovo is not only planning a
next-gen model that will bring improved performance, […]

<p>Die umstrittene großflächige Videoüberwachung in Köln muss nach
jahrelangem juristischen Kampf der Initiative „Kameras stoppen“ und
einem Urteil des Verwaltungsgerichts rückgebaut werden. Es bleibt die
Frage: Ist bei den Datenschutzbehörden noch jemand wach?</p>

available</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-29, from: Glasgow Haskell Compiler</p>
<h1>
GHC 9.12.1-rc1 is now available
</h1>
<h4 class="text-muted">
Zubin Duggal - 2024-11-29
</h4>
<p>
The GHC developers are very pleased to announce the availability of the
release candidate for GHC 9.12.1. Binary distributions, source
distributions, and documentation are available at
<a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/9.12.1-rc1">downloads.haskell.org</a>.
</p>
<p>
We hope to have this release available via ghcup shortly.
</p>
<p>
GHC 9.12 will bring a number of new features and improvements,
including:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
The new language extension
<a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0522-or-patterns.rst">OrPatterns</a>
allowing you to combine multiple pattern clauses into one.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The
<a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0569-multiline-strings.rst">MultilineStrings</a>
language extension to allow you to more easily write strings spanning
multiple lines in your source code.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Improvements to the OverloadedRecordDot extension, allowing the built-in
<code>HasField</code> class to be used for records with fields of non
lifted representations.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The
<a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0409-exportable-named-default.rst">NamedDefaults</a>
language extension has been introduced allowing you to define defaults
for typeclasses other than <code>Num</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
More deterministic object code output, controlled by the
<code>-fobject-determinism</code> flag, which improves determinism of
builds a lot (though does not fully do so) at the cost of some compiler
performance (1-2%). See
<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/12935">#12935</a> for
the details
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
GHC now accepts type syntax in expressions as part of
<a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0281-visible-forall.rst">GHC
Proposal <span>#281</span></a>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The WASM backend now has support for TemplateHaskell.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
… and many more
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
A full accounting of changes can be found in the
<a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/9.12.1-rc1/docs/users_guide/9.12.1-notes.html">release
notes</a>. As always, GHC’s release status, including planned future
releases, can be found on the GHC Wiki
<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/GHC-status">status</a>.
</p>
<p>
We would like to thank GitHub, IOG, the Zw3rk stake pool, Well-Typed,
Tweag I/O, Serokell, Equinix, SimSpace, the Haskell Foundation, and
other anonymous contributors whose on-going financial and in-kind
support has facilitated GHC maintenance and release management over the
years. Finally, this release would not have been possible without the
hundreds of open-source contributors whose work comprise this release.
</p>
<p>
As always, do give this release a try and open a
<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/new">ticket</a> if
you see anything amiss.

<p>There is a crisis in technical education. The golden road to a career
has always been through a college education. However, this “golden road”
has developed deep cracks and is badly in need of maintenance.
Postsecondary education is rapidly becoming unaffordable, even at public
colleges and universities. Tuition has risen at a rate 50% greater

I recently was a guest on The Stack Overflow’s Podcast today, talking
about docs (of course), the Vale prose linter, job titles, automation,
LLMs, and much more. You can listen to the entire episode here or

personal goals this year, and I think these kind of appearances might
help. We need to be where developers are.

The Z4, completed by Konrad Zuse in 1945, is a computer with a wild
story. It was made from scrounged parts, survived years of bombing
raids, moved all around Berlin, and eventually took refuge in basements
and stables. In this episode we will follow the Z4’s early days, and
look at how it fits into the larger picture of Zuse’s work. Along the
way there is looting, rumors, and even… IBM!

I became a Documentation Engineer (and what that even means)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-24, from: Blog by Fabrizio Ferri-Benedetti</p>
<p>
A reader asked me how they’d become a Documentation Engineer, because
they saw I got hired as one and felt curious about what it takes to get
there. This inevitably got me thinking about job titles and the
evolution of tech writing, two topics that are quite central to this
blog. Let me begin with the short answer: As a tech writer you’ll have
to wear many hats, but you’ll always be a technical writer. Depending on
your preferences, some hats will be more comfortable than others. Docs
Engineer is one of those.
