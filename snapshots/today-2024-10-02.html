from the coast</a> the weekend before the debate. Vance refused to say
with certainty that the climate crisis was caused by fossil fuel
emissions, but said that if it were, the U.S. president would want to
“reshore as much American manufacturing as possible, and produce as much
energy as possible in the United States of America, because we’re the
cleanest economy in the entire world.” What Vance is describing sounds
suspiciously like the rationale behind the Inflation Reduction Act,
which

aims</a> to build a green economy at home in the U.S. Walz more or less
pointed that out in his response: “We’ve seen massive investments — the
biggest in global history,” he said. “We’ve seen that the Inflation
Reduction Act has created jobs all across the country,” including in
manufacturing electric cars and solar panels. “It goes to show: Climate
jobs and domestic manufacturing are popular ideas with the American
public,”

EXCLUSIVE: AFRICOM Chief on threats, way forward for US military in
Africa</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Pentagon — U.S. Africa Command chief Gen. Michael Langley is starting
to reshape the U.S. military presence on the continent following the
U.S. military withdrawal from Niger.</p>
<p>Uncertainty about the next phase of the counter-terror fight in West
Africa stems from America’s lost access to two critical counter-terror
bases in Niger. In the east, international participants and troop
numbers for the new African Union Mission in Somalia (AUSSOM) have yet
to be finalized less than three months before the African Union
Transition Mission in Somalia (ATMIS) ends on December 31.</p>
<p>In an exclusive interview at the VOA on Thursday, Langley said the
Islamic State in Somalia had grown about twofold and explained how
al-Qaida affiliate al-Shabab had taken advantage of tensions between
Ethiopia and Somalia to increase recruitment.</p>
<p>Below are highlights from his discussion with VOA Pentagon
correspondent Carla Babb, edited for brevity and clarity:</p>
<p>On the growing U.S. partnership with Angola:</p>
<p>AFRICOM Chief General Michael Langley: Angola has displayed their
leadership across southern Africa … I’m very encouraged by the actions
of Angola.</p>
<p>With Angola and all the countries across the periphery, you have over
38 countries in Africa that have a shoreline. Economic viability is
heavily dependent upon their economic exclusive zones … In the maritime
and maritime awareness of some of these countries, we have a number of
engagements, whether it be Exercise Obangame Express in Gabon this past
summer … We have shared type objectives. They want to be able to
stabilize and grow their economy through their fishing industries, but
it’s hampered by other countries that are going across their economic
exclusive economic zones.</p>
<p>On Chinese aspirations for a second military base in Africa:</p>
<p>Langley: I think they do have, in my best military opinion,
aspirations for another military base… We’re actively watching.</p>
<p>On Russia’s Africa Corps:</p>
<p>Langley: As you can see, they’re already in Mali. They’re already in
Burkina Faso and, to some degree, in Niger. They’ve been in CAR for a
while, Central African Republic, and also in Libya. … (Wagner) has
transitioned to the Russian MOD and the introduction of the Africa
Corps, trying to replicate what we do best in partnering with these
countries and trying to say that their security construct is better. It
has proven not to be … I don’t have particular numbers that they’ve
introduced to Mali, limited numbers in Burkina Faso and also in Libya.
It’s in the hundreds. I’ll just put it that way. It’s not extensive just
yet.</p>
<p>On how the disputes between Ethiopia, Somalia and others in east
Africa are affecting the war against al-Shabab:</p>
<p>Langley: Well, it comes down to troop-contributing countries: who’s
going to play and who’s going to be a troop contributing country in the
transition from ATMIS to AUSSOM, and that starts at the end of the year.
The sunset of ATMIS is 31 December, and then AUSSOM is supposed to take
effect. The unknowns are who are going to be the troop-contributing
countries to the AUSSOM construct…It is not finalized yet. That’s the
UN, that’s the AU and that’s the government of Somalia doing that. We’re
not in those discussions, but it’s going to be revealed soon. I hope so.
So, in the ATMIS construct, one of the anchor and frontline countries
was Ethiopia. So that’s what has me concerned. Ethiopia, especially in
the South West State and their contributions to the liberation and
stabilization, has been valuable … So time will tell if they can settle
their differences and coalesce into a force that’s very effective,
because when they do work together, they’re very, very effective at
clearing out al-Shabab … There’re limited operations with the Ethiopians
at this time.…Al-Shabaab leadership will try to exploit those
disagreements and use that as a recruiting mechanism.</p>
<p>VOA: We’ve heard that they’ve had a stronger recruitment because of
that situation. Would you agree with that?</p>
<p>Langley: Yes, I will agree with that. They have used that to their
advantage.</p>
<p>On whether U.S. forces may be needed during that transition from
ATMIS to AUSSOM to try to supplement security:</p>
<p>Langley: That’s not what we’re there for. We’re there … helping
President Hassan Mohamud be able to build his army. He’s going through
the force generation … all of our initiatives and our approach on the
African continent, with our African partners, will be Africa-led and
U.S.-enabled. So our piece of enabling is not our boots on the ground.
We’re there to advise and assist, and assist in the training, but the
fight is theirs… That’s not my mission… President Sheik Mohammed does
not ask for our boots on the ground.</p>
<p>On June comments from senior U.S. defense officials who told VOA that
al-Shabab had reversed Somali National Army gains in central
Somalia:</p>
<p>Langley: I will say it ebbs and flows…They’re still building the
Somali National Army. So as they go on offensive operations, it is
stress on the force. As they clear and liberate a region, you have to
have a credible holding force there so stabilization activities and
efforts can initiate and turn the populace and faith in the federal
government of Somalia with the services they provide. So that’s a very,
that’s a very fragile period. And if they can’t sustain that, because
they’re moving to the next region or next district, it ebbs.</p>
<p>VOA: So that was what was happening in this instance. They couldn’t
hold the territory that they had gained?</p>
<p>Langley: Right.</p>
<p>VOA: And that’s where your training is coming in, to try to get them
ready to be able to hold that territory?</p>
<p>Langley: Exactly. It takes time. It’s an investment to build an army
… so they have staying power, and they can also close the military and
civilian divide, where the local populace will have faith in the federal
government of Somalia and the national army that is there trying to
hold.</p>
<p>On why he’s “cautiously optimistic” the Somali forces will be
successful against al-Shabab:</p>
<p>Langley: We are at an inflection point. This is unknown territory …
However, when I say I’m consciously optimistic, I’m looking at the
whole-of-government effort. … Every time I go there, stabilization
activities are increasing…Yes, we need a credible holding force because
sometimes the shadow governments of al-Shabab try to re-insert
themselves back in that region and try to influence some of the local
leaders … So it goes back and forth to some of these regions, but
they’re being overridden by some of the stabilization activities that
USAID, the biggest contributor, has put forth.</p>
<p>On the collaboration between Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi militants and
al-Shabab:</p>
<p>Langley: There’s probably aspirations. That’s something that we’re
watching closely but, you know, I will stay tight lipped on …</p>
<p>We’re concerned, and we’re closely watching that, because this can
turn into a bad neighborhood real quick. This is a strategic choke point
on the globe…That’s where a lot of our commerce goes through. It could
affect our global economy if those waters don’t have free flow of
commerce…</p>
<p>With the Houthis and their actions, and al-Shabab and their actions
and (Somali President) HSM trying to keep them from coalescing, that can
interdict the free flow of commerce across those waters of the Gulf of
Aden, Bab-el-Mandeb, the Red Sea, and through the Suez Canal.</p>
<p>On reports Islamic State in Somalia leader Abdulqadir Mumin is now
the leader of Islamic State:</p>
<p>Langley: We have to take it as credible … As far as who is the
overall leader–and ISIS professes that–sometimes you’ve got to take that
seriously, because that person may have an act or aspirations or put
forth operations that can affect our homeland. So yes, we’ve got to take
that seriously.</p>
<p>On Islamic State in Somalia’s growth:</p>
<p>Langley: I am concerned about the northern part of Somalia and ISIS
growing in numbers, and also the possibility of foreign fighters growing
there.</p>
<p>Oh, wow … In the past year, it’s probably grown, probably twofold.
Now, I won’t give numbers, but I’d say it’s probably, it’s more than
what it was last year.</p>
<p>On whether France, the U.S. and Germany have failed the Sahel:</p>
<p>Langley: If we look at the numbers of the global index for terrorism
across the Sahel … 40% of those killed across the globe came from the
Sahel. So that’s concerning. It emanated from, the ideology, I would
say, emanated down through Syria, through the Maghreb. Arab Spring
contributed to it. The fall of Libya contributed to it. That’s how that
has grown and metastasized to the numbers you have today…that jihad-type
ideology is preying upon the civil society, preying upon the
military-aged males.</p>
<p>We are engaging with coastal West African countries because as we
look at what direction it’s metastasized, it’s on the northern regions
of Cote D’Ivoire, Ghana and Togo and Benin. …They understand the
enduring solution for terrorism …. it’s not about kinetics. So that’s
why I don’t just go see the militaries. I get with USAID, and we sit
down with these, with these administrators that go out in the field.</p>
<p>On the possibility of southern Libya providing a solution to the U.S.
bases challenge in the fight against terror in the Sahel:</p>
<p>Langley: We’ve affected the conversation… I went in and talked to
both sides, the GNU and the LNA leadership, but also I want to say that
this is very much in the diplomatic realm. …We need to affect unity to
move forward. They are at an impasse, a political impasse, because, for
us to fully be able to support building their capacity to fight
terrorism, anything emanating from the Sahel, we do need them in
agreement, in concert, working together as a joint force.</p>
<p>But I will tell you, you know, there is another elephant in the
room–elephant in that country–and it’s the Russian Federation. And so
their activities are irrespective of the law of armed conflict,
irrespective of rules-based order, irrespective to human rights. So we
want to be the preferred partner. We don’t tell them to choose. We don’t
give them ultimatums, but through our actions and whatever we offer in a
value proposition that protects human rights, that’s mindful of the laws
of armed conflict, protects the civil society … both the GNU and LNA
understand that, and they have made overtures that they do want to work
with us. So we’re in the nascent stages, but they need to address the
political impasse that they have between the east and the west. And so
our State Department is working that effort.</p>

Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Caroline Spears: </strong>One of the races that is critically
important for climate this year is elected utility commissions. They’re
not elected in every state, but in about 10 states across the country,
voters show up to their ballot box, and they elect the electricity
regulatory body for their state.<br/> <br/> Should that be an elected
position? Listen, it’s not for me to decide. Democracy has decided that
electricity regulatory bodies are elected in many states, so here we
are. In a bunch of other states, they’re appointed and then confirmed by
the state legislature. So there’s this interesting mix of when democracy
shows up in these races, in these offices. There are a few public
utility commission districts up this November. I really want to
highlight the ones happening in Arizona and Montana this year — we’re
really watching those, we’re excited to see where those go. <br/> <br/>
In both cases, climate champions are one and four or zero and five in
those states, which means — literally, we are so far from a climate
majority in either of those states. And this has real world impacts. So,
for example, let’s talk about Montana really quick. That solar company
that I used to work for: The Montana Public Service Commission unfairly
changed the avoided cost rate, the rate at which we would get
compensated, when solar started entering the market. And there’s this
hot mic moment where an elected Montana Public Service Commissioner
says, “Well, this will kill solar in the state,” and then voted for it.
So that’s the power that these public service commissions have, and
they’re up for election. They’re up for election this November. So
they’re really important. <br/> <br/> In Arizona, we’re supporting all
three climate champions running. The one person I really want to
highlight today is Ylenia Aguilar. She served on the water commission in
Arizona, so she has a great knowledge of that intersection between
climate and water issues in the state, and just last month she made
national news for her work trying to cool down classrooms in Arizona
from heating. So she’s someone who can bring together climate, knowledge
of what it takes to be on an electricity regulatory commission, and the
personal impact of how it actually shows up in people’s lives. So this
is the exact type of person you want running for the seat. I’m really
excited about those races, but those will be tough. <br/> <br/>
<strong>Jesse Jenkins: </strong>And I’ll just add, so these commissions
are often in charge of effectively approving the investments and plans
of the regulated utilities in the state. In some states, those are only
network utilities. So they’re the ones investing in transmission and
distribution lines, deciding how to make sure those are resilient to
climate damages as we’re seeing from wildfires and floods and hurricanes
and everything else.<br/> <br/> In other states, like Arizona and
Montana, they also oversee utilities that control power generation, as
well. So should they be investing in new natural gas plants? Or should
they be investing in batteries and solar? For example. Those kinds of
decisions go before the utility commission for approval or disapproval
before the utilities can earn returns on the investments they make in
those areas — or make investments. And as you mentioned, they also set
rates both for retail customers — so, you know, what’s the net metering
policy? How are we incentivizing flexible EV charging? — and then the
rates for, in some cases, avoided costs for larger-scale generators that
are connecting to the grid in partial competition frameworks. Lots and
lots of other rules. <br/> <br/> They’ll be the ones in charge of
implementing, usually, clean electricity standards — and in some states,
like Arizona, they even have the authority to establish one themselves.
So really, really influential bodies.

Vance Makes the Case for the Inflation Reduction Act</h2>

<p class="drop-caps">
It was always going to be the case that the vice presidential debate
would have the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/biden-trump-debate-paris-agreement" target="_self"><u>most
substantive</u></a> climate exchange of the 2024 election cycle. For one
(big) thing: Neither candidate was
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-fact-check-intro" target="_self"><u>Donald
Trump</u></a>. For another, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Ohio Senator
JD Vance both have, at least at some point, professed
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/walz-harris-vp" target="_self"><u>concern</u></a>
about
“<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/15/climate/jd-vance-climate-change.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
climate problem</u></a>.” But a question from the moderators was all but
guaranteed after
<a href="https://www.inc.com/reuters/hurricane-helene-damages-range-between-95-110-billion.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>one
of the costliest hurricanes</u></a> in recent U.S. history devastated
communities
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/hurricane-helene-appalachia-tennessee" target="_self"><u>far
from the coast</u></a> the weekend before the debate.
</p>
<p>
Rather than get just a few meager sentences about
“<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/biden-trump-debate-climate-change" target="_self"><u>immaculate
clean water</u></a>,” then, Americans who bothered to tune into the
debate were treated to a lengthy back-and-forth about clean energy
investment and the Inflation Reduction Act by the presidential
candidates’ seconds. The exchange touched off when Vance was asked what
responsibility the Trump administration would have “to try and reduce
the impact of climate change,” especially given the scenes out of
Western North Carolina.
</p>
<p>
“A lot of people are justifiably worried about all these crazy weather
patterns,” Vance said to start (though lest we forget, those “crazy
weather patterns” just left 100 dead in six U.S. states and are expected
to result in
<a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/downloads/outreach/IPCC_AR6_WGII_FactSheet_Health.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>250,000
excess deaths per year</u></a> by 2050, according to the IPCC). He added
that “Donald Trump and I support clean air, clean water” but that “one
of the things that I’ve noticed some of our Democratic friends talking a
lot about is a concern about carbon emissions — this idea that carbon
emissions drive all the climate change.”
</p>
<p>
Who had on their Bingo card that Vance would be the first to mention
carbon emissions during a debate in 2024? But he quickly turned the
moment around to cast doubt on
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/15/climate/jd-vance-climate-change.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
human causes</u></a>: “Let’s just say that’s true,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/vance-debate-climate" target="_blank">for
the sake of argument</a>, so we’re not arguing about weird science,” he
added, though he proceeded to structure his remarks <em><em>as
if</em></em> we live in a world where greenhouse gases are warming the
atmosphere
(<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/this-is-the-end-of-climate-science" target="_blank">what
a thought</a>!):
</p>
<blockquote>
If you believe that, what would you want to do?<br/> <br/> The answer is
that you want to reshore as much American manufacturing as possible, and
you want to produce as much energy as possible in the United States of
America, because we’re the cleanest economy in the entire world. <br/>
<br/>Kamala Harris’ policies actually led to more energy production in
China, more manufacturing overseas, more doing business in some of the
dirtiest parts of the entire world — when I say that, I mean the amount
of carbon emissions they’re doing per unit of economic output. <br/>
<br/>So if we actually care about getting cleaner air and cleaner water,
the best thing to do is to double down and invest in American workers
and the American people.
</blockquote>
<p>
Of course, what Vance is describing sounds
<em><em>suspiciously</em></em> like the rationale behind the Inflation
Reduction Act, which
<a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/what-the-inflation-reduction-act-does-for-green-energy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>explicitly
aims</u></a> to build a green economy at home in the U.S. Walz more or
less pointed that out in his response: “We’ve seen massive investments —
the biggest in global history,” he said. “We’ve seen that the Inflation
Reduction Act has created jobs all across the country,” including in
manufacturing electric cars and solar panels.
</p>
<p>
Walz also noted that Trump has called climate change a hoax, which
earned Vance a chance to respond. “If the Democrats — in particular,
Kamala Harris and her leadership — if they really believe that climate
change is serious, what they would be doing is more manufacturing and
more energy production in the United States of America,” he
reemphasized, then added: “If you really want to make the environment
cleaner, you’ve got to invest in more energy production. We’ve built a
nuclear facility — I think one in the past 40 years. Natural gas, we’ve
got to invest more in it.”
</p>
<p>
The ball then returned to Walz. “We’re producing more natural gas than
we ever had,” he correctly pointed out (and, though he didn’t mention
it, Biden recently signed
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/advance-act-nuclear" target="_self"><u>a
big bill</u></a> advancing nuclear, too). But while Trump hosted oil
executives at Mar-a-Lago when he was
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-clean-energy" target="_self"><u>courting
campaign donations</u></a>, “we can be smarter about that and an
all-above energy policy,” the governor went on. “That’s exactly what
this administration has done. We are seeing us becoming an energy
superpower for the future, not just the current.”
</p>
<p>
Was it a <em><em>perfect</em></em> climate exchange? Not really. It’s
easy to see why the oil industry
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/15/climate/jd-vance-climate-change.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>is
sweet on Vance</u></a> and Walz’s citation of an “all-above energy
policy” will likely leave some in the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/rnc-energy-all-of-the-above" target="_self"><u>more
progressive</u></a> wings of the climate movement
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/climate-policy-harris-walz" target="_self"><u>feeling
cold</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
But it will be described as an amicable exchange, particularly for
moments like Walz telling Vance, “Well, we got <em><em>close
</em></em>to an agreement” on recognizing so-called crazy weather
patterns. In truth, they also got close to an agreement on a little
something called the IRA — yet another case of a Republican
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/01/us/politics/vance-ohio-ira.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>trying
to have it both ways</u></a>. It goes to show:
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/climate-change-voting-elections" target="_self"><u>Climate
jobs</u></a> and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/bidens-climate-agenda-is-actually-popular" target="_self"><u>domestic
manufacturing</u></a> are popular ideas with the American public. Just
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-fact-check-intro" target="_self"><u>don’t
tell your boss</u></a>, JD.

<p>
We didn’t have to wait long for climate to come up during tonight’s vice
presidential debate between VP hopefuls Republican JD Vance and Democrat
Tim Walz — the night’s second question was about the devastation caused
by
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/hurricane-helene-florida-size" target="_blank">Hurricane
Helene</a> and fueled by warmer air and waters due to climate pollution.
</p>
<p>
Vance started off his answer innocuously enough, extending his thoughts
and prayers to those affected by the hurricane and then proceeding to
some campaign boilerplate. “I think it’s important for us, first of all,
to say Donald Trump and I support clean air and clean water,” Vance said
up top, echoing Trump’s claim that he wants “absolutely immaculate clean
water and … absolutely clean air,” from the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/trump-debate-best-environmental-numbers" target="_self"><u>presidential
debate back in June</u></a>. (It’s worth noting, of course, that his
policy choices
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-climate-change-project-2025" target="_self"><u>tell
a different story</u></a>.)
</p>
<p>
Vance then proceeded to hedge the climate change question in a way that
wound up backing him right into it. “One of the things that I’ve noticed
some of our Democratic friends talking a lot about is a concern about
carbon emissions, this idea that carbon emissions drives all of the
climate change,” Vance said. “Well, let’s just say that’s true — just
for the sake of argument, so we’re not arguing about weird science.
Let’s just say that’s true.”
</p>
<p>
He then went on to describe an America-first
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/rnc-energy-all-of-the-above" target="_self"><u>all-of-the-above</u></a>
energy and manufacturing policy that sounded
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/the-inflation-reduction-act-remains-astonishing" target="_self"><u>more
than a little familiar</u></a>.

Department launches first federal review of 1921 Tulsa race
massacre</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Justice has launched a review and
evaluation of the 1921 race massacre in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Assistant
Attorney General Kristen Clarke said.</p>
<p>The massacre started on May 31, 1921, when white attackers killed as
many as 300 people, most of them Black, in Tulsa’s prosperous Greenwood
neighborhood, which had gained the nickname “Black Wall Street.”</p>
<p>In announcing the review on Monday, Clarke said the department aims
to have it finalized by the end of the year.</p>
<p>“When we have finished our federal review, we will issue a report
analyzing the massacre in light of both modern and then-existing civil
rights law,” said Clarke, who oversees the Justice Department’s civil
rights enforcement efforts.</p>
<p>The review will be conducted under the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil
Rights Crime Act, which allows the Department of Justice to investigate
death-resulting civil rights crimes that occurred on or before Dec. 31,
1979.</p>
<p>The massacre started after a Black man was accused of assaulting a
white woman.</p>
<p>“We have no expectation that there are living perpetrators who could
be criminally prosecuted by us or by the state,” Clarke said. “Although
a commission, historians, lawyers and others have conducted prior
examinations of the Tulsa Massacre, we, the Justice Department, never
have.”</p>
<p>Clarke said the department is examining available documents, witness
accounts, scholarly and historical research and other information
related to the massacre.</p>

declines to be interviewed for ‘60 Minutes’ election special</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — CBS News said Tuesday that Republican presidential nominee
Donald Trump has declined to participate in an interview with “60
Minutes” for its election special, which will go forward next Monday
with Democratic opponent Kamala Harris alone.</p>
<p>Television’s top-rated news program regularly invites the two
presidential contenders for separate interviews that air back-to-back on
a show near the election. This year, it is scheduled for Monday instead
of its usual Sunday time slot.</p>
<p>Asked for comment, the former president’s campaign spokesperson
Steven Cheung said, “Fake news,” adding that there were discussions, but
nothing was ever locked in.</p>
<p>“60 Minutes” said Trump’s campaign had initially agreed to an
interview before telling CBS that the former president would not appear.
The network said its invitation to sit for an interview still stands,
and correspondent Scott Pelley will explain Trump’s absence to
viewers.</p>
<p>Vice President Harris will appear in a pretaped interviewed with Bill
Whitaker.</p>
<p>There are currently no other scheduled opportunities for voters to
compare the two candidates together. Harris and Trump previously debated
on Sept. 10. Although Harris has accepted an invitation from CNN for a
second debate later this month, Trump has not accepted.</p>
<p>The interview special is scheduled to air Monday instead of the usual
“60 Minutes” time slot because CBS is showing the American Music Awards
on Sunday.</p>
<p>Trump’s interview with “60 Minutes” correspondent Lesley Stahl prior
to the 2020 election proved contentious, with the former president
ending the session early and his campaign posting an unedited transcript
of the session.</p>
<p>CBS News was hosting Tuesday’s vice presidential debate between
Republican Ohio Sen. JD Vance and Tim Walz, Minnesota’s Democratic
governor.</p>

id="wildfires-in-california-have-burned-1-million-hectares-so-far-this-year">Wildfires
in California have burned 1 million hectares so far this year</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — The total hectares burned in California this year
surpassed 1 million as spiking temperatures Tuesday added to the
challenges facing firefighters struggling to contain a stubborn blaze in
the mountains northeast of Los Angeles that flared up over the
weekend.</p>
<p>Evacuation orders were expanded again Monday for remote communities
northeast of Los Angeles as the Line Fire that has been burning for
nearly a month spread over nearly 176 square kilometers (68 square
miles) of the San Bernardino Mountains, and containment dropped from 83%
to 76%.</p>
<p>“The dry vegetation, steep slopes and wind aligned … to create
conditions for the rapid fire spread,” according to a statement late
Monday from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection,
or Cal Fire.</p>
<p>The risk of wildfires increased across California as an autumn heat
wave scorched much of the state. Some inland areas could see
temperatures up to 20 degrees above average for this time of year,
according to the National Weather Service.</p>
<p>San Francisco, where residents typically break out the sweaters in
October, could hit 32 degrees Celsius (90 degrees Fahrenheit), while
triple digits 38 C were predicted for Sacramento. The weather service
office in the state’s capital urged residents to stay indoors during the
heat of the day on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Dry, hot winds in the northern part of the state prompted Pacific Gas
&amp; Electric to preemptively cut power to small clusters of customers
in high-risk areas. The utility routinely stops electricity service in
counties where weather conditions increase the probability of fires.</p>
<p>In Southern California, the Line Fire’s surge pushed the total
hectares burned across the state in 2024 to 405,492 (1,001,993 acres) as
of Tuesday morning, according to Cal Fire. The milestone surpasses the
total scorched during the same time last year — 118,719 hectares
(293,362 acres) — but is roughly on par with the five-year average for
the period, the Los Angeles Times reported.</p>
<p>A 34-year-old man has pleaded not guilty to starting the Line Fire on
September 5. Justin Wayne Halstenberg of Norco, California, was charged
with 11 arson-related crimes, according to court records.</p>
<p>At its height, the blaze threatened more than 65,000 homes in and
around the Big Bear Lake area.</p>

<p>date: 2024-10-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD — The United States has reassigned its special
representative for Afghanistan, leaving vacant a key position in its
efforts to engage with the Taliban-ruled country.</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced the decision Tuesday
to reassign Tom West, while emphasizing that Washington’s commitment to
the South Asian nation “remains an enduring priority.”</p>
<p>Blinken said West would serve in a new role as the acting head of the
Office of Sanctions Coordination at the U.S. State Department and
commended him for working “tirelessly to ensure [that] both our national
interests and the welfare of the Afghan people guided our policy in
Afghanistan.”</p>
<p>West was appointed as the special representative to Afghanistan in
October 2021, two months after the Taliban regained power and all
U.S.-led NATO troops withdrew from the country, ending 20 years of
involvement in the war.</p>
<p>“Tom has skillfully led diplomacy on Afghanistan during a complex
period,” Blinken said. “Today’s global challenges are equally as
complex, and I look forward to working with him on coordinating economic
sanctions strategies across the U.S. government with our partners and
stakeholders to achieve U.S. foreign policy priorities,” he said without
elaborating.</p>
<p>The Taliban takeover compelled Washington and other Western capitals
to relocate their diplomatic missions from Kabul to Doha, Qatar, where
Karen Decker serves as the chief of the U.S. Embassy. Blinken said
Decker has been asked to lead Afghan diplomacy.</p>
<p>The de facto Afghan leaders have imposed their strict interpretation
of Islamic law, known as Shariah, banning girls’ education beyond the
sixth grade, prohibiting women from most workplaces and access to public
life at large across the impoverished country.</p>
<p>Taliban leaders reject international criticism and calls for
reversing bans on Afghan women’s rights to work and education as
interference in the country’s internal matters.</p>
<p>Blinken said that Rina Amiri, the U.S. special envoy for Afghan
women’s and girls’ rights, would continue to lead her mission to ensure
that “human rights, and particularly women’s rights, are
prioritized.”</p>
<p>Asif Durrani, who served as Pakistan’s special representative to
Afghanistan until last month, said that many countries, including the
U.S., are frustrated with the Taliban due to their treatment of women
and their lack of an inclusive government in Kabul.</p>
<p>“Issues such as inclusivity or human rights, particularly girls’
right to education and women’s right to work, are issues that the
American administration cannot afford to overlook and engage the Taliban
in a meaningful way,” Durrani said.</p>
<p>But he suggested the wars in Ukraine and Gaza have diverted
Washington’s attention from the Afghan situation.</p>
<p>“It’s quite obvious that Afghanistan is not on the United States’
priority list, at least for the time being,” Durrani said.</p>
<p>State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller rejected that view when
asked by reporters Tuesday whether Afghanistan is still a U.S. foreign
policy priority.</p>
<p>“Of course it is,” he said. “And we will continue to stay engaged in
Afghanistan. It remains an enduring priority.”</p>
<p>Durrani said the U.S. cannot be blamed alone for the lack of
improvement in Afghanistan. “The Taliban’s rigid attitude towards
women’s education and their ban on women’s work is not winning them any
friends or sympathy.”</p>
<p>No country has officially recognized the men-only Taliban government
in Kabul, mainly due to human rights issues and their sweeping
restrictions on women’s freedoms.</p>
<p>The United States and allied nations have imposed financial and
banking sector sanctions on Afghanistan since the Taliban takeover.
Donors have cut economic development assistance, citing
terrorism-related sanctions on several key leaders of the de facto
government.</p>
<p>State Department Bureau Chief Nike Ching contributed to this

id="dockworkers-may-have-negotiating-advantage-in-their-strike-against-us-ports">Dockworkers
may have negotiating advantage in their strike against US ports</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>philadelphia — The 45,000 dockworkers who went on strike Tuesday for
the first time in decades at 36 U.S. ports from Maine to Texas may wield
the upper hand in their standoff with port operators over wages and the
use of automation.</p>
<p>Organized labor enjoys rising public support and has had a string of
recent victories in other industries, in addition to the backing of the
pro-union administration of President Joe Biden. The dockworkers’
negotiating stand is likely further strengthened by the nation’s supply
chain of goods being under pressure in the aftermath of Hurricane
Helene, which has coincided with the peak shipping season for holiday
goods.</p>
<p>The union is also pointing to shipping companies’ record profits,
which have come in part because of shortages resulting from the
pandemic, and to a more generous contract that West Coast dockworkers
achieved last year. The longshoremen’s workloads also have increased,
and the effects of inflation have eroded their pay in recent years.</p>
<p>The dockworkers’ strike, their first since 1977, could snarl supply
chains and cause shortages and higher prices if it stretches on for more
than a few weeks. Beginning after midnight, the workers walked picket
lines Tuesday and carried signs calling for more money and a ban on
automation that could cost workers their jobs.</p>
<p>Major retailers prepared</p>
<p>Experts say consumers won’t likely notice shortages for at least a
few weeks, if the strike lasts that long, though some perishable items
such as bananas could disappear from grocery stores — although at this
time of year, most other fruits and vegetables are domestically grown
and not processed at ports, according to Alan Siger, president of the
Produce Distributors Association.</p>
<p>In anticipation of a strike, most major retailers also stocked up on
goods, moving ahead shipments of holiday gift items.</p>
<p>The strike, coming weeks before a tight presidential election, could
also become a factor in the race if shortages begin to affect many
voters. Pressure could eventually grow for the Biden administration to
intervene to force a temporary suspension of the strike.</p>
<p>Little progress was reported in the talks until just hours before the
strike began at 12:01 a.m. The U.S. Maritime Alliance, the group
negotiating for the ports, said both sides did budge from their initial
positions. The alliance offered 50% raises over the six-year life of the
contract. Comments from the union’s leadership had briefly suggested a
move to 61.5%, but the union has since signaled that it’s sticking with
its initial demand for a 77% pay increase over six years.</p>
<p>In early picketing, workers outside the Port of Philadelphia walked
in a circle, chanting, “No work without a fair contract.” The union
posted message boards on the side of a truck reading: “Automation Hurts
Families: ILA Stands for Job Protection.”</p>
<p>Boise Butler, president of the union local, asserted that the workers
want a contract that doesn’t allow for the automation of their jobs. The
shipping companies, he argued, made billions during the pandemic by
charging high prices.</p>
<p>“Now,” Butler said, “we want them to pay back. They’re going to pay
back.”</p>
<p>And in New Orleans, Henry Glover Jr., a fourth-generation dockworker
who is president of the union local, says he can recall the days when
longshoremen unloaded 150-pound sacks of sugar by hand. He acknowledges
that machinery has made the job easier, but he worries that the ports
need fewer people to handle the equipment.</p>
<p>“Automation could be good, but they’re using it to kill jobs,” Glover
said. “We don’t want them to implement anything that would take our jobs
out.”</p>
<p>William Brucher, an assistant professor of labor studies and
employment relations at Rutgers University, noted that “this is a very
opportune time” for striking workers.</p>
<p>The contract agreement reached last year with West Coast dockworkers,
who are represented by a different union, shows that “higher wages are
definitely possible” for the longshoremen and has enhanced their
bargaining power, Brucher said.</p>
<p>Biden’s options</p>
<p>Under the Taft-Hartley Act, Biden could seek a court order for an
80-day cooling-off period that would end the strike at least
temporarily, but he has told reporters that he wouldn’t take that step.
The administration could risk losing union support if it exercised such
power, which experts say could be particularly detrimental for Democrats
ahead of next month’s election.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the White House continued to ask the alliance to
negotiate a fair contract that reflects the longshoremen’s contribution
to the economy.</p>
<p>“As our nation climbs out of the aftermath of Hurricane Helene,”
Biden said in a statement, “dockworkers will play an essential role in
getting communities the resources they need. Now is not the time for
ocean carriers to refuse to negotiate a fair wage for these essential
workers while raking in record profits.”</p>

id="trump-rallies-in-battleground-state-of-wisconsin-before-vp-debate">Trump
rallies in battleground state of Wisconsin before VP debate</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WAUNAKEE, Wisconsin — Former President Donald Trump spent more than
an hour ahead of Tuesday night’s vice presidential debate campaigning in
a Democratic county crucial to Kamala Harris’ hopes for winning the key
battleground state of Wisconsin. </p>
<p>Republican Trump appeared at a manufacturing facility in Waunakee, a
suburb of Wisconsin’s capital city of Madison in the Democratic
stronghold of Dane County. Trump had never campaigned in Dane County nor
visited as president. </p>
<p>In an event advertised as economic-themed, Trump bounced from subject
to subject, also taking on Democratic nominee Harris on issues,
including foreign policy, crime and immigration, while intermittently
pivoting to criticism of outgoing President Joe Biden. </p>
<p>“I’m asking every citizen to join me in launching sort of a new
golden age for America,” Trump told hundreds inside Dane Manufacturing,
a metal fabricator that has a long history of hosting Republican
candidates and officeholders. </p>
<p>Trump also could not pass up a jab at former President Jimmy Carter
on the Georgia Democrat’s 100th birthday. </p>
<p>With hollow praise, Trump declared the one-term Carter “the happiest
man” because he “is considered a brilliant president” compared with
Biden. Trump did not note Carter’s birthday, nor his status as the
longest-living former president. </p>
<p>Later Tuesday, Trump was to hold an event at a museum in Milwaukee,
Wisconsin’s largest city and home to the state’s largest number of
Democratic voters and second-largest number of Republicans. His
appearance there was also meant to give him reach into the city’s
conservative suburbs, a part of Wisconsin where his support has softened
but where he must do well to win. </p>
<p>In Milwaukee, Trump was slated to speak in a small auditorium at
Discovery World, a science museum along Lake Michigan’s lakefront. His
event was not open to the public and his audience was to consist only of
news media. </p>
<p>Last Saturday, he held a rally in western Wisconsin where he blamed
Harris for crimes committed by people in the country illegally. </p>
<p>Both of his planned stops were ahead of Tuesday’s debate in New York
between Trump’s running mate JD Vance, a senator from Ohio, and
Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz, the governor of
Minnesota. </p>
<p>Dane County, the location of Trump’s first stop, is Wisconsin’s
fastest-growing county and an economic engine for the state, fueled by
jobs in the health care and tech industries. It is also home to the
University of Wisconsin. </p>
<p>Dane County’s population grew by about 30,000 people between 2016 and
2020. It has gone up by an additional 13,000 since then, based on the
most recent U.S. Census Bureau estimate. </p>
<p>That presents a challenge for Republicans, especially given that
nearly 90% of registered voters in the county cast ballots in 2020.
Biden won 75% of the vote that year in Dane County, beating Trump by
181,000 votes in the county while carrying the state by fewer than
21,000. Hillary Clinton beat Trump in Dane County in 2016 by 47 points,
and Trump won the state by less than one point. </p>
<p>It’s a point former Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson said he made to
Trump. In remarks to the crowd before Trump arrived, Thompson said the
former president should “go where the opposition is.” </p>
<p>“And, the retort was, ‘Isn’t Madison very liberal?’” Thompson said.
“Yes, but Dane County has the third-most Republican votes in the state
of Wisconsin, and all we have to do is increase them.” </p>
<p>Democratic presidential candidates have long come to Dane County to
hold massive rallies to fire up the base. Harris campaigned there on
September 20, holding a rally in Madison that attracted more than 10,000
people. </p>
<p>Waunakee, which bills itself as the “only Waunakee in the world,” is
slightly more Republican than the county as a whole. In 2020, Trump got
36% of the vote there compared to less than 23% countywide.</p>

id="hurricane-damage-creates-uncertainty-about-how-voters-will-cast-ballots-in-swing-state">Hurricane
damage creates uncertainty about how voters will cast ballots in swing
state</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ASHEVILLE, North Carolina — North Carolina election officials say
they will do everything in their power to ensure that voters in the
crucial presidential swing state will be able to cast their ballots
despite the devastation of Hurricane Helene and the destruction of basic
infrastructure only about a month before the November election.</p>
<p>Karen Brinson Bell, the executive director of the state’s election
board, said Tuesday that 12 county election offices in the hard-hit
western part of the state remain closed after the storm unleashed
“unprecedented” damage. Absentee ballots, some of which already have
been mailed to voters who requested them, also face obstacles, from U.S.
Postal Service delays to road and residential damage that could render
them undeliverable. The viability of early and Election Day voting sites
remains unknown, she said.</p>
<p>She described the storm as causing a “daunting” level of uncertainty,
with early in-person voting scheduled to start in just over two weeks,
on October 17. Still, she said the state is prepared to help voters
navigate the emergency.</p>
<p>“We’ve battled through hurricanes and tropical storms and still held
safe and secure elections, and we will do everything in our power to do
so again,” Brinson Bell told reporters during a media call. “Mountain
people are strong, and the election people who serve them are resilient
and tough, too.”</p>
<p>Helene, which battered large swaths of the Southeast late last week
with torrential rain and strong winds and massive storm surges along the
Gulf Coast, caused devastation “beyond belief” in the popular mountain
city of Asheville and other parts of western North Carolina, Governor
Roy Cooper said during a media briefing Tuesday.</p>
<p>“This disaster is unlike anything our state has ever experienced,” he
said.</p>
<p>The level of destruction could have far-reaching implications beyond
the immediate damage to the flooded communities, especially if it has
any impact on voting. North Carolina is among seven swing states being
hotly contested by Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee,
and former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee. Trump barely
defeated Democrat Joe Biden in the state four years ago, winning by
about 74,500 votes out of 5.5 million cast.</p>
<p>Asheville is the most populous city in the 25-county region under a
disaster declaration and sits in the one county — Buncombe — where
registered Democrats outnumber Republicans. Michael Bitzer, a politics
professor at Catawba College in Salisbury, North Carolina, said the
disaster area includes “significant blue dots in a very red sea,” making
it difficult to predict how the storm might affect voter turnout and
election results.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, emergency workers were still engaged in rescue efforts
across the broad swath of the Southeastern U.S. that bore the brunt of
the storm. Election officials in Florida, Tennessee and Georgia were
assessing the damage and the potential impacts to mail balloting, early
voting and Election Day operations.</p>
<p>Georgia election workers have returned to work even as some offices
face power outages, limited internet and infrastructure damage. Absentee
ballots are scheduled to go out on October 7 as planned, said Robert
Sinners, communications director for Georgia’s secretary of state.</p>
<p>In Tennessee, two county election offices had water damage, and at
least six polling locations in the northeastern part of the state have
been damaged or are inaccessible, said Doug Kufner, spokesman for the
secretary of state’s office.</p>
<p>North Carolina officials said they are considering moving or
combining voting locations if some are unusable or inaccessible.</p>
<p>More urgently, state officials are offering guidance and some special
accommodations for absentee voters, who may not receive their ballots
because of evacuations, suspended Postal Service operations or
residential mailboxes swept away in the storm.</p>
<p>Paul Cox, general counsel for the North Carolina State Board of
Elections, said displaced voters can contact their county election
office to request that their absentee ballot be spoiled and sent to a
different location.</p>
<p>Those voters also have the option of waiting to cast a ballot in
person, either during the early voting period of October 17 to November
2 or on Election Day, November 5, Cox said. State law requires all
voters to show voter ID, but those who are from a county under a
disaster declaration and have lost their ID can fill out an exception
form so they can cast a ballot.</p>
<p>Officials are still weighing whether to take further steps to
accommodate voters, such as extending the absentee ballot deadline or
allowing more people to cast ballots through an online portal already
used by military, overseas and visually impaired voters, Brinson Bell
said.</p>
<p>Some of the county boards whose offices remain closed or are dealing
with outages have been given special emergency kits from the state,
which were initially intended for use in case of a ransomware attack,
Brinson Bell said. The kits are equipped with laptops, cellphones, Wi-Fi
hotspots and other essentials to allow election operations to continue
even without power, phone or internet service.</p>
<p>Kelly Godfrey, who has lived in Asheville for more than three years,
is one of the few voters who returned their absentee ballot before the
storm hit. In Buncombe County, which includes Asheville, nearly 9,990
voters had requested absentee ballots as of Tuesday — 85% of them
Democrats or voters who are not affiliated with any party, according to
Associated Press election research. Only about 170 had been
returned.</p>
<p>Godfrey said she hopes rules and procedures will be adjusted to make
it easier for voters who were displaced by the storm. But she also
worries that any changes could lead to misinformation and false claims
of voter fraud after the election.</p>
<p>“It’s going to be spun a lot of different ways,” she said.</p>
<p>For now, though, voting feels “so far out in the distance,” Godfrey
said. “Right now, people are thinking food and water.”</p>

<h2 id="us-press-freedom-under-unprecedented-pressure-report-finds">US
press freedom under unprecedented pressure, report finds</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — As a tight presidential election looms in the United
States, journalist safety in the home of the First Amendment is no
longer guaranteed, according to a report published Tuesday.</p>
<p>Journalists in the United States are facing a slew of threats,
including attacks by police, online harassment, violence and legal
challenges, according to the report by the New York-based Committee to
Protect Journalists (CPJ). The report primarily analyzes developments
since 2020.</p>
<p>“There was a hope at the beginning of the Biden administration that
things would get better for journalists. And what we’ve seen, actually,
is that things haven’t really gotten better. They’ve stayed the same or
worsened in some situations,” Katherine Jacobsen, CPJ’s U.S., Canada and
Caribbean program coordinator, told VOA.</p>
<p>The numbers paint a concerning picture. As of September 2024,
assaults on journalists in the United States in relation to their work
have risen by more than 50% compared to last year — from 45 to 68
assaults — according to data from the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker.</p>
<p>‘Enemies of the people’</p>
<p>Even though former President Donald Trump lost the 2020 presidential
election, the report points to his legacy as a driving factor behind the
hostile environment continuing to face journalists around the
country.</p>
<p>During Trump’s presidency, he regularly referred to journalists as
“corrupt,” “dishonest” and “enemies of the people.” Those kinds of
attacks took place — and continue to take place — within the context of
record-low trust in the media in the United States, according to a 2023
Gallup poll.</p>
<p>“Donald Trump’s treatment of the media still matters because it’s
very much still an issue,” said Jacobsen, who authored the report. “It’s
a really effective political tactic for changing the narrative and
undermining the credibility of the media.”</p>
<p>Trump’s administration also escalated prosecution of news sources,
interfered in the business of media owners, and harassed journalists
crossing U.S. borders, according to a 2020 CPJ report.</p>
<p>Trump’s office and presidential campaign did not immediately reply to
VOA’s emails requesting comment for this story. Karoline Leavitt, the
Trump campaign’s national press secretary, also did not immediately
reply to VOA’s request for comment.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, CPJ reached out to both the Trump and Kamala Harris
campaigns, asking them to sign the organization’s pledge to affirm their
support for press freedom. Trump’s campaign did not reply, and Harris’
campaign acknowledged receipt but did not sign the pledge.</p>
<p>Consequences continue</p>
<p>Trump hasn’t been in office for nearly four years, but his tenure in
the White House continues to have consequences for journalists in the
United States, according to Jacobsen.</p>
<p>“If Donald Trump’s anti-media rhetoric did not find resonance among
the broader American public, then we wouldn’t even be talking about it,”
Jacobsen said.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden’s administration has been markedly friendlier to
the press, according to the report, but Jacobsen said that hasn’t
translated to an improved media environment around the country.</p>
<p>A top threat facing journalists is violence, which has steadily
increased against the media over the past decade in the United States,
the report said.</p>
<p>Among the most prominent recent cases is the 2022 killing of Las
Vegas Review-Journal reporter Jeff German, who was found stabbed to
death outside his home. Robert Telles, a former local Nevada official,
was found guilty of murdering German in late August.</p>
<p>Although journalist killings are rare in the United States, they can
have a chilling effect on the media community, according to Jacobsen.
Reporters told CPJ that hostility toward journalists makes them feel
less safe working in their home environments.</p>
<p>“The killing of journalists, especially local journalists where the
reporters are working in the community, going to the same grocery stores
as the people that they’re writing about, creates this sense that
nowhere is safe,” Jacobsen said.</p>
<p>Incidents involving police are another issue for journalists.</p>
<p>In a recent case, Chicago police arrested three photojournalists
while they covered a pro-Palestinian protest during the Democratic
National Convention in August.</p>
<p>And four years ago, at least 459 journalists were assaulted while
covering the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests, including at least 273
cases in which police targeted journalists, according to the
Tracker.</p>
<p>“The press serves as the public’s eyes and ears, and if the press is
removed completely from the scene, the public’s blind to what’s
happening on the ground,” Gabe Rottman, a senior attorney at the
Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, said in the CPJ
report.</p>
<p>Physical threats against journalists are exacerbated by online
harassment against them, according to the report. A 2022 survey by Pew
Research Center found that one-third of journalists surveyed reported
being harassed on social media in the previous year.</p>
<p>With the election just over a month away, Jacobsen said it’s also
important to remember the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection on the Capitol in
Washington.</p>
<p>Journalists were among the targets during the riots, with at least 18
journalists assaulted that day, according to the Tracker. But there
hasn’t been much accountability in those cases, according to Jacobsen,
and large swaths of the American public still don’t agree on what
happened that day.</p>
<p>Some journalists who were present during the insurrection say
grappling with the subsequent trauma has been difficult, according to
the report.</p>
<p>“I really do think that January 6th was a warning shot,” Amanda
Andrade-Rhoades, a freelance photojournalist who was on assignment at
the Capitol during the riots, said in the CPJ report. “It was a wake-up
call to the fragility of our democracy and trust in institutions — like
journalism, like the government — that’s been eroding for a very long
time.”</p>
<p>Jacobsen said she’s worried about ramifications for the media
landscape if the results of the presidential election are contested.
Trump has previously said that Democrats will cheat in the election and
suggested that any election in which he does not win is likely to be
fraudulent.</p>
<p>“It’s really important for journalists across the country to prepare
themselves for the worst-case scenario and hope for the best,” Jacobsen

US ‘China House’ official: Taiwan conflict not inevitable</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — China has been one of the most-discussed international
topics during the U.S. presidential campaign.</p>
<p>VOA spoke with Rick Waters, former head of the Office of China
Coordination at the State Department and deputy assistant secretary of
state for China and Taiwan, about the Biden administration’s China
policy.</p>
<p>Waters spoke about his experience dealing with his Chinese
counterparts, and how he thinks Vice President Kamala Harris or former
President Donald Trump would handle China, if elected.</p>
<p>This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.</p>
<p>VOA: How do you evaluate the progress made in U.S.-China relations
after U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping met in
California last year, and do you see real, meaningful results coming
from the meeting?</p>
<p>Rick Waters: I think we have to look at this Woodside summit as the
culmination of a number of things that happened in the
administration.</p>
<p>The first is that for the first period, Biden was focused on
rebuilding the U.S. domestic strength and reinvigorating partnerships
and alliances globally, and then from that position, dealing with China
from a position of relative strength. So during that first two-year
period, the U.S. China relationship was, in some ways, arguably, not the
priority. It was important, but it was managed largely through leader
level diplomacy, which, in China’s current political configuration is
the most important channel.</p>
<p>And then we know what happened in 2022 circumstances around the visit
of former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi [to Taiwan] led to a
downward spiral, and Biden and Xi made an initial effort to stabilize
relations that fall at their summit in Bali, but it only made it a few
months, and then the surveillance balloon knocked things sideways
again.</p>
<p>So, I think what we have now is a little bit more stable floor built
around the leader level channels, a few modest areas where there is some
common work underway, and a web of senior, empowered channels at the
Cabinet level, including Jake Sullivan, who try to manage conflict and
competition rather within bounds, within guardrails, to avoid the
scenario of unmitigated downward spiral we saw in 2022.</p>
<p>VOA: Do you think a Chinese invasion of Taiwan is inevitable, or what
should the U.S. do to deter that invasion?</p>
<p>Waters:  Well, nothing’s inevitable, but I think we should start when
we look at the Taiwan issue by recognizing that the U.S. and China have
had a difference of views on this issue for longer than you and I have
been alive, and it hasn’t resulted in war. So, while neither side is
perfectly happy with the issue, China objecting to US armed transfers
the U.S., objecting to, most recently, this extraordinary PLA
modernization effort and rhetoric that implies that the leadership has a
greater sense of urgency on the issue. </p>
<p>I don’t think that conflict is inevitable, and I think at its core
the U.S.’s interest is peace and stability. That’s what’s anchored the
prosperity in the Indo-Pacific over the past couple of decades. The
ability for commerce, for trade, for people-to-people flows regionally
to thrive in an environment where there is no war.</p>
<p>And so, I think if we take that as our starting point, I don’t think
that conflict is inevitable, but I do think that the U.S. and Taiwan are
focused very much on the question of how to ensure that the leadership
in Beijing never believe they have a viable military option and an
acceptable cost. And if that condition holds, then I think it will fall
to the diplomats and to the channels that exist between the parties to
manage this issue carefully.</p>
<p>VOA: During your career as a U.S. diplomat, what’s your experience
dealing with your Chinese counterparts? What are some striking and most
challenging aspects or moments that left an impression on you?</p>
<p>Waters: I’ve been fortunate to deal with Chinese diplomats for the
better part of 30 years. And what I will say is irrespective of what you
think of China’s policy or political system, they do have a very
professional diplomatic corps. They’ve got very talented people in the
system. What I think has changed over the past few decades is it’s a
much more disciplined system. So, it’s very difficult, especially in
official meetings, for Chinese diplomats to move too far off of the
established line.</p>
<p>So, I don’t think that we should misunderstand the level of talent in
the system when we look at it through its structural constraints. But I
do think that as China’s overall foreign policy has become more
assertive, as you know, the leadership has talked about China playing a
greater role on the international stage. It has gone through periods
where the wolf warriorism, the change in tone from the podium, has
characterized a different era of Chinese diplomacy than what we saw
before.</p>
<p>But I actually think, in some ways, there are plenty in the system
who understand the counterproductive nature of those tactics, and I’ve
seen a little bit of a tactical recalibration over recent years in how
they express their foreign policy views publicly.</p>
<p>VOA: In this election season, the Biden administration’s China policy
has often been criticized by the Republican campaign for being too weak.
What is your take on that?</p>
<p>Waters: We’re in an election campaign, so obviously you’re never
going to hear anyone say that someone’s policy is too tough. I think
that the honest reality is that this election is not really, in my view,
about China. It’s about other issues. China is present, but if you look
at how much it’s featured in the speeches at the Republican and
Democratic conventions, there are issues related to China that are
important, but I think we have to maintain that perspective.</p>
<p>Second, I think that the issues that, in my view, matter most to
voters center around trade and a perception of unfairness, a lack of
reciprocity, and fentanyl, which for a number of years is a problem that
has had a direct relationship to the producers of these precursor
chemicals in China, and so I think those types of issues do matter on
the margins, but they’re not central to U.S. voters, particularly in the
swing states that will decide this election.</p>
<p>VOA: For the observers in China who are looking at this election, how
is Harris’ China policy going to be different than President Biden’s,
and what awaits China if Trump regains power?</p>
<p>Waters: I think how this is playing in China is a very different
story. But I think what we have to say at this point is that we’re in
the midst of a campaign. So, to be fair to both candidates, what we
should judge is, once they form their Cabinets next spring, how will
they translate political positions into new policy? I think Harris’s
team has expressed a general view that her policy will be consistent
with Biden’s. The Trump team and President Trump himself have talked
about aspects of the relationship, particularly trade, where they feel
that things are out of balance.</p>
<p>VOA: Biden and Xi are likely to meet and sit down again later this
year. So, what are the prospects and expectations for this meeting?</p>
<p>Waters: It’ll be a critical moment, because this meeting — which will
be either on the margins of the G20 [Group of 20 largest economies]
summit in Brazil [November 18-19], or the APEC [Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation] summit in Lima, Peru [November 10-16], depending on where
it takes place — these meetings on the margins of summits are
consequential during a presidential transition. I think they can use it
as a chance to help bridge between the two administrations. That will be
easier if it’s a Biden-to-Harris transition, because
Democrat-to-Democrat is more likely to be able to talk about how the
bridging will work. But if it’s, you know, Biden-to-Trump, I still think
it’s consequential.</p>
<p>President Biden can give his advice about how to avoid returning to
the events of 2022 [and] how they can reflect on the lessons of what has
been achieved since the Woodside [California] Summit [in November 2023].
And I think you probably go into it with fairly modest expectations.</p>

Amos, patriarch on ‘Good Times’ and Emmy nominee for blockbuster
‘Roots,’ dies at 84</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — American actor John Amos, who starred as the family
patriarch on the hit 1970’s sitcom Good Times and earned an Emmy
nomination for his role in the seminal 1977 miniseries Roots, has died.
He was 84. </p>
<p>Amos’ publicist, Belinda Foster, confirmed the news of his death
Tuesday. No other details were immediately available. </p>
<p>He played James Evans Sr. on Good Times, which featured one of
television’s first Black two-parent families. Produced by Norman Lear
and co-created by actor Mike Evans, who co-starred on All in the Family
and The Jeffersons, it ran from 1974-79 on CBS. </p>
<p>“That show was the closest depiction in reality to life as an African
American family living in those circumstances as it could be,” Amos told
Time magazine in 2021. </p>
<p>His character, along with wife Florida, played by Esther Rolle,
originated on another Lear show, Maude. James Evans often worked two
manual labor jobs to support his family that included three children,
with Jimmie Walker becoming a breakout star as oldest son J.J. </p>
<p>Such was the show’s impact that Alicia Keys, Rick Ross, the Wu-Tang
Clan are among the musicians who name-checked Amos or his character in
their lyrics. </p>
<p>Amos and Rolle were eager to portray a positive image of a Black
family, struggling against the odds in a public housing project in
Chicago. But they grew frustrated at seeing Walker’s character being
made foolish and his role expanded. </p>
<p>“The fact is that Esther’s criticism, and also that of John and
others — some of it very pointed and personal — seriously damaged my
appeal in the Black community,” Walker wrote in his 2012 memoir
Dyn-O-Mite! Good Times, Bad Times, Our Times. </p>
<p>After three seasons of critical acclaim and high ratings, Amos was
fired. He had become critical of the show’s white writing staff creating
storylines that he felt were inauthentic to the Black characters. </p>
<p>“There were several examples where I said, ‘No, you don’t do these
things. It’s anathema to Black society. I’ll be the expert on that, if
you don’t mind,’” he told Time magazine. “And it got confrontational and
heated enough that ultimately my being killed off the show was the best
solution for everybody concerned, myself included.” </p>
<p>Amos’ character was killed in a car accident. Walker lamented the
situation. “If the decision had been up to me, I would have preferred
that John stay and the show remain more of an ensemble,” he wrote in his
memoir. “Nobody wanted me up front all the time, including me.” </p>
<p>Amos and Lear later reconciled and they shared a hug at a Good Times
live TV reunion special in 2019. </p>
<p>Amos quickly bounced back, landing the role of an adult Kunta Kinte,
the centerpiece of Roots, based on Alex Haley’s novel set during and
after the era of slavery in the U.S. The miniseries was a critical and
ratings blockbuster, and Amos earned one of its 37 Emmy
nominations. </p>
<p>“I knew that it was a life-changing role for me, as an actor and just
from a humanistic standpoint,” he told Time magazine. “It was the
culmination of all of the misconceptions and stereotypical roles that I
had lived and seen being offered to me. It was like a reward for having
suffered those indignities.” </p>
<p>Early years</p>
<p>Born John Allen Amos Jr. on Dec. 27, 1939, in Newark, New Jersey, he
was the son of an auto mechanic. He graduated from Colorado State
University with a sociology degree and played on the school’s football
team. </p>
<p>Before pursuing acting, he moved to New York and was a social worker
at the Vera Institute of Justice, working with defendants at the
Brooklyn House of Detention. </p>
<p>He had a brief professional football career, playing in various minor
leagues. He signed a free-agent contract in 1967 with the Kansas City
Chiefs, but coach Hank Stram encouraged Amos to pursue his interest in
writing instead. He had jobs as an advertising and comedy writer before
moving in front of the camera. </p>
<p>Amos’ first major TV role was as Gordy Howard, the weatherman on The
Mary Tyler Moore Show from 1970-73. As the show’s only Black character,
he played straight man to bombastic anchor Ted Baxter. </p>
<p>Among Amos’ film credits were Let’s Do It Again with Bill Cosby and
Sidney Poitier, Coming to America with Eddie Murphy and its 2021 sequel,
Die Hard 2, Madea’s Witness Protection and Uncut Gems with Adam Sandler.
He was in Ice Cube and Dr. Dre’s 1994 video “Natural Born Killaz.” </p>
<p>He was a frequent guest star on The West Wing, and his other TV
appearances included Hunter, The District, Men in Trees, All About the
Andersons, Two and a Half Men, and The Ranch. </p>
<p>In 2020, Amos was inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame. He
served in the New Jersey National Guard.</p>

sanctions West Bank settler group for violence against Palestinians</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The United States on Tuesday imposed sanctions on
Hilltop Youth, a group of extremist settlers in the Israeli -occupied
West Bank who attack Palestinians and their property.</p>
<p>In addition, the State Department placed diplomatic sanctions on two
men — Israeli settler Eitan Yardeni, for his connection to violence
targeting West Bank civilians, and Avichai Suissa, the leader of
Hashomer Yosh, a sanctioned group that brings young volunteers to
settler farms across the territory, including small farming outposts
that rights groups say are the primary drivers of settler violence
across the territory.</p>
<p>The sanctions, which expose people to asset freezes and travel and
visa bans, come as violence against Palestinians in the West Bank has
exploded since the start of the Israel-Hamas war following the deadly
terrorist attacks of October 7.</p>
<p>Palestinians report verbal and physical harassment and restriction of
movement, and they face intimidation by settlers circling their
properties on motorbikes, cars or horses and spying via drones.</p>
<p>The Treasury Department said Hilltop Youth has carried out killings
and mass arson, while rights groups and Palestinians say the group is
behind “price tag” attacks — attacks on Palestinian villages in
retaliation for perceived efforts to hamper settlement construction.</p>
<p>The group may prove difficult to effectively sanction, as it is
loosely organized and decentralized. In addition, Israel’s finance
minister has previously vowed to intervene on sanctioned settlers’
behalf.</p>
<p>In the past, sanctioned settlers said that the measures had little
impact on their finances.</p>
<p>Hilltop Youth has already faced sanctions from the EU and U.K.</p>
<p>The Biden administration has been criticized for imposing relatively
few sanctions on Israeli extremists. According to the Office of Foreign
Assets Control, 27 extremists and entities have been sanctioned by the
U.S. under President Joe Biden ’s February 2024 Executive Order related
to maintaining West Bank stability.</p>
<p>Treasury Acting Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial
Intelligence Bradley T. Smith said that the U.S. “will continue to hold
accountable the individuals, groups and organizations that facilitate
these hateful and destabilizing acts.”</p>
<p>State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said, “The actions of
these individuals have contributed to creating an environment where
violence and instability thrive. Their actions, collectively and
individually, undermine peace, security and stability in the West
Bank.”</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
Pakistan has long had a severely troubled economy, and a central part of
the problem is
<a href="https://thediplomat.com/2024/08/pakistans-power-crisis-a-perfect-storm-of-policy-failures/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>its
electric grid</u></a>. Much of it was constructed back in the 1960s and
has not been maintained or updated regularly. In the 1990s, the
government enticed foreign companies (mostly from China, ironically, in
light of current events) to build more power plants by promising to
subsidize them even if they were not running at full capacity. But it
did not invest sufficiently in transmission capacity, leading to
inflated electric bills to pay for idle plants while power went
undelivered. Conditions on a recent loan from the International Monetary
Fund and rising fuel prices led to even further increases.
</p>
<p>
As a result, despite electricity that now costs 23 cents per
kilowatt-hour — or close to twice the
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm_table_grapher.php?t=epmt_5_6_a" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>U.S.
average</u></a> in a country less than one-tenth as rich per person,
where half the population subsists on $4 per day or less — rolling
blackouts are common, and even the occasional country-wide grid
collapse, as happened in January 2023. The power bill
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-13/it-can-cost-more-to-power-a-house-than-rent-it-in-pakistan?embedded-checkout=true" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>costs
more than rent</u></a> for some Pakistanis, and about anyone who can
afford it has a diesel generator backup. A
<a href="https://www.sustainable-carbon.org/pakistan-coal-consumption-to-double-by-2030-report/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>recent
report</u></a> from the Pakistan Credit Rating Agency estimated that the
country’s coal consumption would double by 2030, in line with the
<a href="https://thediplomat.com/2023/09/pakistans-energy-crossroads-coal-dependency-the-climate-crisis-and-a-quest-for-sustainability/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>government’s
strategy</u></a> to reduce fuel imports by boosting domestic production.
</p>
<p>
But things are changing, and fast. Pakistan imported a whopping
<a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/commodities/2024/08/09/pakistan-sees-solar-boom-as-chinese-imports-surge-bnef-says/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>13
gigawatts</em></em></u></a> of solar panels, mostly from China, in just
the first half of 2024, mostly for rooftop installations for homes and
businesses. That’s a mind-boggling amount of new solar for a country
that only had about 50 gigawatts of installed generation capacity
<em><em>in total</em></em> in 2023.
</p>
<p>
In the short term, solar imports are likely to cause some problems,
particularly for the poorest Pakistanis. But past that, things might get
a lot better.
</p>
<p>
As the <em><em>Financial Times</em></em>
<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/69e4cb33-3615-4424-996d-5aee9d1afe19?sharetype=gift" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reports</u></a>,
the solar boom is leading to slashed utility payments, further
threatening the rickety and debt-laden grid system. Poorer Pakistanis
who can’t afford to buy panels are increasingly left holding the
ever-more-expensive bag. Many will likely refuse to pay their power bill
or simply not be able to afford to. Some provinces have resorted to
handing out panels for free to poor folks. If I had to guess, I would
imagine sooner or later the extant utility system will go bankrupt, and
most or all of Pakistan’s investment in fossil-fuel generation will be
written off. That will no doubt cause all manner of painful and
lingering side effects.
</p>
<p>
But there is a promising potential future visible, should Pakistan
manage to get clear of its entanglement with fossil fuel power. As noted
above, for decades it has been trapped in a sandpit of underinvestment,
policy mistakes, corruption, economic chaos, and austerity. The
government couldn’t get it together to build and maintain a traditional
power grid, leading to slanted foreign investments and IMF bailouts with
stringent conditions, leading in turn to eye-watering prices for
unreliable power. Meanwhile, economic problems
<a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/01/29/1152428444/pakistans-nationwide-blackout-is-part-of-an-escalating-crisis" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>caused
in part</u></a> by unreliable electricity fueled inflation and a
collapsing currency that drastically increased the price of imports.
</p>
<p>
Fuel imports are one of the largest expenses for even prosperous
countries. For places like Pakistan, they are a punishing economic
drain. Paying for vast amounts of imported coal, gas, and oil in scarce
foreign currency is hard enough in good times, but it’s disastrous when
one’s currency has depreciated by about
<a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/PKR-USD?window=5Y" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>40%</u></a>
over two years.
</p>
<p>
Dirt cheap solar power could ameliorate or solve many of these problems
at a stroke. Panels are now so cheap, even Pakistan can afford to import
them by the millions — an expense, yes, but a one-time one. And while
solar is inherently intermittent, and therefore not a solution to
Pakistan’s reliability problems, batteries are also plummeting in price
— down
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-26/battery-prices-are-falling-again-as-raw-material-costs-drop" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>about
90%</u></a> between 2010 and 2023 — and can help balance out supply.
Cheaper batteries also mean cheaper EVs, with (as usual) Chinese models
coming out at bewilderingly low prices. And because Pakistanis
<a href="https://humenglish.com/latest/switching-to-electric-motorcycles-opportunities-and-challenges-in-pakistan/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>mostly
drive motorcycles</u></a> (often manufactured domestically) over
relatively short distances, electrifying the personal vehicle fleet
there will be far cheaper than in America or Europe; vastly smaller
batteries require vastly simpler charging infrastructure.
</p>
<p>
If all goes well, this will free up vast amounts of economic capacity
for Pakistan to invest in domestic development. Businesses will have
stable, reliable power supplies that will justify more investment.
Households will be able to upgrade their insulation, install heat pumps,
and generally spend more on things other than energy. The government
will be able to upgrade legacy transmission lines to accommodate solar
production from the remaining hydro and nuclear plants.
</p>
<p>
Finally, of course, there is the climate benefit. Pakistan is one of the
countries most threatened by climate change. Summer heat waves are
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/28/asia/pakistan-heat-wave-sindh-climate-intl-hnk/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>bad
and getting worse</u></a>, to the point where murderous wet bulb events
are increasingly likely. Catastrophic warming-fueled storms in 2022
caused the
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/02/asia/pakistan-floods-climate-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>worst
flooding in the country’s history</u></a>, inundating about a third of
Pakistan’s land area, killing nearly 2,000 people and causing billions
of dollars in damages.
</p>
<p>
In short, a path to economic development will be opened. It is by no
means guaranteed, but it will be a heck of a lot easier than trying to
dig out from under the debt mountain of the collapsing coal-powered
system. Look around the developing world and you’ll find there are a
great many nations in similar situations.
</p>
<p>
Ethiopia, for instance, has abundant solar and hydro potential, but much
of its rural population is not connected to the grid. Researchers there
expect both grid-connected and off-grid solar projects to
<a href="https://sciencepublishinggroup.com/article/10.11648/j.ajasr.20230903.13" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>proliferate</u></a>
over the next five years, and modest government subsidies have already
catalyzed a
<a href="https://cleantechnica.com/2024/05/13/ethiopia-shows-us-just-how-fast-the-transition-to-electric-mobility-can-happen-in-africa/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>rapid
switch to electric vehicles</u></a>. On the other side of the continent,
solar installations in the region are projected to grow at a compound
annual rate of about
<a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/west-africa-solar-pv-panels-market-report" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>30%</u></a>
through 2030. In Nicaragua, which has historically generated much of its
power from imported oil, both rooftop solar and utility-scale solar are
increasing, with President Daniel Ortega
<a href="https://solarquarter.com/2024/04/30/nicaragua-president-daniel-ortega-greenlights-major-solar-power-project/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>signing
an agreement</u></a> with a Chinese firm for a major new project earlier
this year.
</p>
<p>
Developing nations still face innumerable obstacles, from unfavorable
trade deals to political instability to corruption. But for many,
dependence on imported carbon fuels and their wildly gyrating prices has
been a shackle on their economies. Those that can shake it off will find
it much easier to climb up the development ladder.

“Megalopolis” flop and Hollywood’s reluctance to take risks</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-01, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
Legendary filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola’s latest work flopped at the
box office over the weekend. Coppola self-funded the film,
“Megalopolis,” to the tune of $120 million. Yet it made just $4 million
in its opening weekend. It’s the latest original film — one that’s not a
sequel or remake — to struggle to attract audiences to the theater.
Then, remittances to India top $100 billion a year.

<h2 id="freebsd-to-invest-in-laptop-support">FreeBSD to invest in laptop
support</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-01, from: OS News</p>
<p>FreeBSD is going to take its desktop use quite a bit more seriously
going forward. FreeBSD has long been a top choice for IT professionals
and organizations focused on servers and networking, and it is known for
its unmatched stability, performance, and security. However, as
technology evolves, FreeBSD faces a significant challenge: supporting
modern laptops. To address this, the FreeBSD Foundation and Quantum Leap
Research has committed $750,000 to improve laptop support, a strategic
investment that will be pivotal in FreeBSD’s future. ↫ FreeBSD
Foundation blog So, what are they going to spend this big bag of money
on? Well, exactly the kind of things you expect. They want to improve
and broaden support for various wireless chipsets, add support for
modern powersaving processor states, and make sure laptop-specific
features like touchpad gestures, specialty buttons, and so on, work
properly. On top of that, they want to invest in better graphics driver
support for Intel and AMD, as well as make it more seamless to switch
between various audio devices, which is especially crucial on laptops
where people might reasonably be expected to use headphones. In
addition, while not specifically related to laptops, FreeBSD also
intends to invest in support for heterogeneous cores in its scheduler
and improvements to the bhyve hypervisor. Virtualisation is, of course,
not just something for large desktops and servers, but also laptop users
might turn to for certain tasks and workloads. The FreeBSD project will
be working not just with Quantum Leap Research, but also various
hardware makers to assist in bringing FreeBSD’s laptop support to a more
modern, plug-and-play state. Additionally, the mentioned cash injection
is not set in stone; additional contributions from both individuals and
larger organisations are obviously welcome, and of course if you can
contribute code, bug reports, documentation, and so on, you’re also more
than welcome to jump in.</p>

<li>Treasury: Hydrogen tax credit rules will be done by the end of the

<p>
The Treasury Department will finalize the long-awaited rules governing
the new clean hydrogen tax credit before the end of the year, Deputy
Secretary Wally Adeyemo

clean power</a> tax credits by that time, he said. That means that the
Treasury Department will have finished the rules governing most — but
not all — of the 18 tax credits created or remade by the Inflation
Reduction Act, President Joe Biden’s signature climate package, by the
end of his term. More than two years after that law’s passage, many of
the potential beneficiaries — including electric utilities, battery
manufacturers, and more — are still waiting to find out exactly how to
collect its incentives.
</p>
<p>
The uncertainty has been especially paralyzing for the nascent clean
hydrogen industry, as the final guidance for the hydrogen tax credit,
section 45V of the tax code, could determine which multimillion dollar
projects ultimately get developed. Chief among the Treasury Department’s
concerns: It must decide how hydrogen producers who use electrolysis —
sending electricity through water to split its molecules — should deal
with the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/green-hydrogen-tax-credit-treasury?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-83PRuVhXY2NBnmwd1PxtOOnYHFbcuGWRhdMlckHToWrQ_2t5JKwIsUIdrW3KfSZ_Ao6_cz" rel="noopener" target="_self">indirect
carbon emissions</a> associated with drawing power from the grid. The
Treasury received more than 30,000 comments on the initial draft of the
hydrogen rules.
</p>
<p>
Though Adeyemo did not comment on the final rules’ substance, he called
those comments “quite helpful” and asserted multiple times during the
interview that the Treasury has found middle ground between the scheme
favored by climate advocates and a proposal more favored by the
industry. “Congress has provided a strong enough incentive here that
allows us to do two things at once, which is one, make sure that we’re
watching for significant indirect missions, but at the same time
creating pathways to do exactly what industry is talking about, which is
accelerating the development of the industry here,” he said.

<p>
The death toll from Hurricane Helene has risen to 130 and hundreds of
people remain missing in cut-off mountain areas in western North
Carolina, where flooding and landslides swept away homes. Nearly
one-third of those missing are from areas surrounding Asheville. “The

the state’s governor, Roy Cooper. “This is something that’s never
happened before in western North Carolina.” More than 1.5 million
customers across six states remain without electricity and many in
Asheville do not have running water. President Biden is expected to
visit the state on Wednesday.

Researchers at the Berkeley Lab put together a provisional attribution

Tax Credit Rules Will Be Done by the End of the Year</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-01, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzcwODY3NS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1ODIzODM5Nn0.n9eGjc5UIDOfPMudqbFYMvu0VbjnKv__QZemagiNpZ8/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
The Treasury Department will finalize the long-awaited rules governing
the new clean hydrogen tax credit before the end of the year, Deputy
Secretary Wally Adeyemo told Heatmap in an exclusive interview Monday.
</p>
<p>
It will also publish the final guidance for the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/biden-ira-tax-credit-45x" target="_self"><u>advanced
manufacturing</u></a> and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/clean-electricity-tax-credit" target="_self"><u>technology-neutral
clean power</u></a> tax credits by that time, he said.
</p>
<p>
That means that the Treasury Department will have finished the rules
governing most — but not all — of the 18 tax credits created or remade
by the Inflation Reduction Act, President Joe Biden’s signature climate
package, by the end of his term. More than two years after that law’s
passage, many of the potential beneficiaries — including electric
utilities, battery manufacturers, and more — are still waiting to find
out exactly how to collect its incentives.
</p>
<p>
The Treasury hasn’t just been sitting on its hands. Adeyemo told us the
department has completed 75 guidance “projects” related to the IRA, a
category that includes proposed and final rules as well as some
non-binding FAQs and other documents. Citing
<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/inflation-reduction-act/impact-and-stories" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>an
analysis</u></a> from the Rhodium Group, an energy research firm, and
MIT, he said that the Inflation Reduction Act has already spurred some
$380 billion of private investment in 1,600 clean energy projects
nationwide, potentially creating 270,000 jobs.
</p>
<p>
“This is far out-performing what I think the initial expectations for
the law were at this stage,” Adeyemo said. “But as you also know, lots
of people want us to finish additional rulemaking.”
</p>
<p>
The uncertainty has been especially paralyzing for the nascent clean
hydrogen industry, as the final guidance for the hydrogen tax credit,
section 45V of the tax code, could determine which multimillion dollar
projects ultimately get developed. Chief among the Treasury Department’s
concerns: It must decide how hydrogen producers who use electrolysis —
sending electricity through water to split its molecules — should deal
with
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/green-hydrogen-tax-credit-treasury" target="_self"><u>the
indirect carbon emissions</u></a> associated with drawing power from the
grid.
</p>
<p>
Under the scheme favored by climate advocates, would-be hydrogen makers
will have to build enough new renewable capacity to satisfy their energy
needs in close to real time. Under a proposal more favored by the
industry, producers could buy power from existing nuclear or
hydroelectric power plants that currently serve other customers, or
simply offset their emissions with solar energy certificates even if
they continue to operate when the sun goes down. Draft rules published
in December took a strict approach to emissions — and faced
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/hydrogen-tax-credit-rules" target="_self"><u>fierce
pushback</u></a> not just from industry, but also from Democratic
members of Congress and the Department of Energy. Leaders of
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/hydrogen-hubs-biden-pennsylvania-california-texas" target="_self"><u>regional
clean hydrogen hubs</u></a> — which have been awarded grants by a
separate $7 billion federal program — argued that strict rules would be
fatal to their cause.
</p>
<p>
There is a lot of money at stake — up to $3 per kilogram of hydrogen
produced, equaling many billions over the lifetime of the program — to
build a new industry from near-scratch. Some energy modelers fear that
if the program is designed poorly, that windfall could subsidize a lot
of carbon emissions. Projects that are supposed to help the U.S. cut
emissions could end up creating them instead, these groups have
predicted,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/hydrogen-tax-credit-rules" target="_self"><u>setting
the country back two to three percentage points</u></a> on its
greenhouse gas targets.
</p>
<p>
There are many other open questions about the hydrogen credit, including
requirements for
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/hydrogen-tax-credit-final-methane-offsets" target="_self"><u>producers
that make hydrogen from natural gas</u></a>, instead of from water and
electricity. Although hydrogen companies made a flurry of new project
announcements right after the Inflation Reduction Act first passed, many
have since put those plans on hold as the industry awaits the final
rules.
</p>
<p>
The Treasury received more than 30,000 comments on the initial draft of
the hydrogen rules. Though Adeyemo did not comment on the final rules’
substance final rules, he called those comments “quite helpful” and
asserted multiple times during our interview that the Treasury has found
middle ground.
</p>
<p>
“Congress has provided a strong enough incentive here that allows us to
do two things at once, which is one, make sure that we’re watching for
significant indirect emissions, but at the same time creating pathways
to do exactly what industry is talking about, which is accelerating the
development of the industry here,” he said.
</p>
<p>
Looming over these decisions is the upcoming election, when a change in
control of the White House or Congress could open up the rules to
review. Adeyemo acknowledged that the final rules were unlikely to
please everyone. But he said that he was “less concerned” about pushback
from Congress. He argued that the tax credit was lucrative enough that
companies could afford to abide by the requirements Treasury ultimately
sets, and that what the industry really wants is “clarity, certainty,
and flexibility.”
</p>
<p>
Companies and environmental groups on both sides of the hydrogen fight —
including the energy company Constellation, which operates more than a
dozen nuclear plants, and the Natural Resources Defense Council — have
already threatened lawsuits if the rules do not align with their
priorities.
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/supreme-court-loper-corner-post" target="_self"><u>Recent
Supreme Court decisions</u></a> have weakened federal agencies’ ability
to defend their own rules in court. But Adeyemo said the department was
working hard to design the rules “in a way that is in keeping with
congressional intent,” to protect them from such attacks. “We’re now
going through the process of making sure that we show our work and how
we’ve done that.”
</p>
<p>
The other tax credit rules the Treasury plans to finalize, while still
consequential, have not left such foundational questions up in the air.
Companies have already begun building battery factories, for example,
under the expectation that they will be able to claim the advanced
manufacturing tax credit. The technology-neutral clean power credits
don’t even go into effect until next year, and the biggest uncertainty
is whether facilities that burn biomass or methane captured from
landfills for energy will qualify.
</p>
<p>
The news also leaves a few industries in the dark. Adeyemo said he
couldn’t commit to a timeline for finalizing a tax credit for low-carbon
aviation fuel, for example. Final rules for a tax credit for electric
vehicle charging equipment are also on the to-do list.
</p>
<p>
“The challenge, of course, is there’s only so many people here at the
Treasury Department who are doing all this work,” Adeyemo said, “so
getting through all the 30,000 comments on clean hydrogen and focusing
on that means that there’s going to be clear trade-offs.”

id="biden-plans-survey-of-devastation-in-north-carolina-as-helenes-death-toll-tops-130">Biden
plans survey of devastation in North Carolina as Helene’s death toll
tops 130</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ASHEVILLE, N.C. — President Joe Biden was set to survey the
devastation in the mountains of Western North Carolina on Wednesday,
where exhausted emergency workers continued to work around-the-clock to
clear roads, restore power and cellphone service, and reach people left
stranded by Hurricane Helene. The storm killed at least 133 people and
hundreds more were still unaccounted for on Monday night, four days
after Helene initially made landfall.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, election officials across the South were making emergency
preparations to ensure displaced residents would be able to vote in the
upcoming presidential election.</p>
<p>Officials in the hard-hit tourism hub of Asheville said their water
system suffered “catastrophic” damage that could take weeks to fully
repair. Government officials, aid groups and volunteers were working to
deliver supplies by air, truck and even mule to the town and surrounding
mountain communities. At least 40 people died in the county that
includes Asheville.</p>
<p>The North Carolina death toll included one horrific story after
another of people who were trapped by floodwaters in their homes and
vehicles or were killed by falling trees. A courthouse security officer
died after being submerged inside his truck. A couple and a 6-year-old
boy waiting to be rescued on a rooftop drowned when part of their home
collapsed.</p>
<p>Rescuers did manage to save dozens, including an infant and two
others stuck on the top of a car in Atlanta. More than 50 hospital
patients and staff in Tennessee were plucked by helicopter from the
hospital rooftop in a daring rescue operation.</p>
<p>How some of the worst-hit areas are coping</p>
<p>The storm unleashed the worst flooding in a century in North
Carolina. Rainfall estimates in some areas topped more than 2 feet (61
centimeters) since Wednesday, and several main routes into Asheville
were washed away or blocked by mudslides. That includes a 6.4-kilometer
section of Interstate 40 that was heavily damaged.</p>
<p>Joey Hopkins, North Carolina’s secretary of transportation, asked
people on Monday to stay off the roads.</p>
<p>“The damage is severe, and we’re continuing to tell folks if you
don’t have a reason to be in North Carolina, do not travel on the roads
of western North Carolina,” Hopkins said at a news conference. “We do
not want you here if you don’t live here and you’re not helping with the
storm.”</p>
<p>At an Ingles grocery store in Asheville, Elizabeth Teall-Fleming was
standing in line with dozens of others waiting to get inside and hoping
to find some non-perishable food, since they have no power. She planned
to heat up some canned food over a camping stove for her family.</p>
<p>“I’m just glad that they’re open and that they’re able to let us in,”
she said.</p>
<p>Teall-Fleming said she was surprised by the ferocity of the
storm.</p>
<p>“Just seeing the little bit of news that we’ve been able to see has
been shocking and really sad.”</p>
<p>In one neighborhood, residents were collecting creek water in buckets
to flush their toilets.</p>
<p>Others waited in a line for more than a block at Mountain Valley
Water to fill up milk jugs and whatever other containers they could find
with drinking water.</p>
<p>Derek Farmer, who brought three gallon-sized apple juice containers,
said he had been prepared for the storm but now was nervous after three
days without water. “I just didn’t know how bad it was going to be,”
Farmer said.</p>
<p>Helene roared ashore in northern Florida late Thursday as a Category
4 hurricane and quickly moved north. The storm upended life throughout
the Southeast, where deaths were also reported in Florida, Georgia,
South Carolina and Virginia. Officials warned that rebuilding would be
lengthy and difficult.</p>
<p>Federal Emergency Management Agency officials said Monday that
shelters were housing more than 1,000 people.</p>
<p>North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper took an aerial tour of the Asheville
area and later met with workers distributing meals.</p>
<p>“This has been an unprecedented storm that has hit western North
Carolina,” he said afterward. “It’s requiring an unprecedented
response.”</p>
<p>Worries about the presidential election</p>
<p>Karen Brinson Bell, executive director of the North Carolina State
Board of Elections, said during an emergency board meeting on Monday
that they are looking at options for voters in the hardest-hit counties.
She planned to provide more information at a Tuesday news conference,
including how someone could declare “natural disaster” as their reason
for not being able to provide a photo ID.</p>
<p>Election employees across Georgia returned to work even as some
offices faced power outages, limited internet and infrastructure
damage.</p>
<p>In Lowndes County, staff at the local board of elections were working
off of two computers instead of the usual eight, said election
supervisor Deb Cox. The office is also without wifi.</p>
<p>“We’re fully up and running as of this morning,” said Cox. “It’s just
slower than normal because we have less resources.”</p>
<p>In Columbia County, poll worker training will still begin this week,
said Nancy Gay, the county’s elections director, but she may have to
change the location because of the power outage.</p>
<p>“Our poll workers are being affected,” Gay said. “They don’t have
power. They don’t have gas. You’ve got to allow the workers time to
process everything and try and get a plan in place before I can really
expect them to come and show up for training.”</p>
<p>Mark Ard at the Florida Secretary of State’s office said the Division
of Elections is recommending that local elections supervisors reach out
to U.S. Post Office officials to discuss a mitigation plan for ballot
mailing, delivery, and return.</p>
<p>Why western North Carolina was hit so hard</p>
<p>Western North Carolina suffered relatively more devastation because
that’s where the remnants of Helene encountered the higher elevations
and cooler air of the Appalachian Mountains, causing even more rain to
fall.</p>
<p>Asheville and many surrounding mountain towns were built in valleys,
leaving them especially vulnerable to devastating rain and flooding.
Plus, the ground already was saturated before Helene arrived, said
Christiaan Patterson, a meteorologist with the National Weather
Service.</p>
<p>“By the time Helene came into the Carolinas, we already had that rain
on top of more rain,” Patterson said.</p>
<p>Climate change has exacerbated conditions that allow such storms to
thrive, rapidly intensifying in warming waters and turning into powerful
cyclones, sometimes within hours.</p>
<p>Destruction from Florida to Virginia</p>
<p>Along Florida’s Gulf Coast, several feet of water swamped the
Clearwater Marine Aquarium, forcing workers to move two manatees and sea
turtles. All of the animals were safe but much of the aquarium’s vital
equipment was damaged or destroyed, said James Powell, the aquarium’s
executive director.</p>
<p>Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said the storm “literally spared no one.”
Most people in and around Augusta, a city of about 200,000 near the
South Carolina border, were still without power Monday.</p>
<p>With at least 30 killed in South Carolina, Helene was the deadliest
tropical cyclone to hit the state since Hurricane Hugo made landfall
north of Charleston in 1989, killing 35 people.</p>
<p>Tropical Storm Kirk forms and could become a powerful hurricane</p>
<p>Tropical Storm Kirk formed Monday in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and
is expected to become a “large and powerful hurricane” by Tuesday night
or Wednesday, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said. The storm was
located about 1,285 kilometers west of the Cabo Verde Islands with
maximum sustained winds of 95 kph. There were no coastal watches or
warnings in effect, and the storm system was not a threat to land.</p>

<h2 id="ibm-pc-5150-model-numbers">IBM PC 5150 model numbers</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-01, from: OS News</p>
<p>Recently I came across a minor mystery—the model numbers of the
original IBM PC. For such a pivotal product, there is remarkably little
detailed original information from the early days. ↫ Michal Necasek
Count me surprised. When I think IBM, I think meticulously documented
and detailed bureaucracy, where every screw, nut, and bolt is numbered,
documented, and tracked, so much so in fact this all-American company
even managed to impress the Germans. You’d expect IBM, of all companies,
to have overly detailed lists of every IBM PC it ever designed,
manufactured, and sold, but as it turns out, it’s actually quite hard to
assemble a complete list of the early IBM PCs the company sold. The
biggest problem are the models from before 1983, since before that year,
the IBM PC does not appear in IBM’s detailed archive of announcements.
As such, Michal Necasek had to dig into random bits of IBM documentation
to assemble references to those earlier models, and while he certainly
didn’t find every single one of them, it’s a great start, and others can
surely pick up the search from here.</p>

id="dockworkers-from-maine-to-texas-go-on-strike-risking-new-shortages">Dockworkers
from Maine to Texas go on strike, risking new shortages</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PHILADELPHIA — Dockworkers at ports from Maine to Texas began walking
picket lines early Tuesday in a strike over wages and automation that
could reignite inflation and cause shortages of goods if it goes on more
than a few weeks.</p>
<p>The contract between the ports and about 45,000 members of the
International Longshoremen’s Association expired at midnight, and even
though progress was reported in talks on Monday, the workers went on
strike. The strike affecting 36 ports is the first by the union since
1977.</p>
<p>Workers began picketing at the Port of Philadelphia shortly after
midnight, walking in a circle at a rail crossing outside the port and
chanting “No work without a fair contract.”</p>
<p>The union had message boards on the side of a truck reading:
“Automation Hurts Families: ILA Stands For Job Protection.”</p>
<p>At Port Houston, which is in the Central time zone an hour behind the
East Coast, at least 50 workers gathered outside the port with signs
saying “No Work Without a Fair Contract.” They appeared poised to begin
picketing. Workers showed a statement from the ILA on the strike saying
that employers have refused to compensate workers fairly.</p>
<p>“The ILA is fighting for respect, appreciation and fairness in a
world in which corporations are dead set on replacing hard-working
people with automation,” the statement said. “Robots do not pay taxes
and they do not spend money in their communities.”</p>
<p>The U.S. Maritime Alliance, which represents the ports, said Monday
evening that both sides had moved off of their previous wage offers, but
when picket lines went up just after midnight, it was apparent that no
deal had been reached.</p>
<p>The union’s opening offer in the talks was for a 77% pay raise over
the six-year life of the contract, with President Harold Daggett saying
it’s necessary to make up for inflation and years of small raises. ILA
members make a base salary of about $81,000 per year, but some can pull
in over $200,000 annually with large amounts of overtime.</p>
<p>But Monday evening, the alliance said it had increased its offer to
50% raises over six years, and it pledged to keep limits on automation
in place from the old contract. The union wants a complete ban on
automation. It wasn’t clear just how far apart both sides are.</p>
<p>“We are hopeful that this could allow us to fully resume collective
bargaining around the other outstanding issues in an effort to reach an
agreement,” the alliance statement said.</p>
<p>The union didn’t answer requests for comment on the talks Monday
night, but said earlier in the day that the ports had refused demands
for a fair contract and the alliance seemed intent on a strike. The two
sides had not held formal negotiations since June.</p>
<p>The alliance said its offer tripled employer contributions to
retirement plans and strengthened health care options.</p>
<p>During the day Monday, some ports already were preparing for a
strike. The Port of Virginia, for instance, was in the process of
ceasing operations. It accepted the last inbound train for delivery at 8
a.m., closed its gates to inbound trucks at noon and required ships to
leave by 1 p.m. Cargo operations halted at 6 p.m.</p>
<p>“We are handling this just like we would during the ramp up to a
possible hurricane,” Joe Harris, the port’s spokesperson, told The
Associated Press. “And we will bring it back online just as we would
recovering from a hurricane. We have an experienced team. We’ve done
this in the past.”</p>
<p>Supply chain experts say consumers won’t see an immediate impact from
the strike because most retailers stocked up on goods, moving ahead
shipments of holiday gift items.</p>
<p>But if it goes more than a few weeks, a work stoppage would
significantly snarl the nation’s supply chain, potentially leading to
higher prices and delays in goods reaching households and
businesses.</p>
<p>If drawn out, the strike will force businesses to pay shippers for
delays and cause some goods to arrive late for peak holiday shopping
season — potentially impacting delivery of anything from toys or
artificial Christmas trees to cars, coffee and fruit.</p>
<p>The strike will likely have an almost immediate impact on supplies of
perishable imports like bananas, for example. The ports affected by the
strike handle 3.8 million metric tons of bananas each year, or 75% of
the nation’s supply, according to the American Farm Bureau
Federation.</p>
<p>It also could snarl exports from East Coast ports and create traffic
jams at ports on the West Coast, where workers are represented by a
different union. Railroads say they can ramp up to carry more freight
from the West Coast, but analysts say they can’t make up the cargo
handled to the east.</p>
<p>“If the strikes go ahead, they will cause enormous delays across the
supply chain, a ripple effect which will no doubt roll into 2025 and
cause chaos across the industry,” noted Jay Dhokia, founder of supply
chain management and logistics firm Pro3PL.</p>
<p>J.P. Morgan estimated that a strike that shuts down East and Gulf
coast ports could cost the economy $3.8 billion to $4.5 billion per day,
with some of that recovered over time after normal operations
resume.</p>
<p>The strike comes just weeks before the presidential election and
could become a factor if there are shortages. Retailers, auto parts
suppliers and produce importers had hoped for a settlement or that
President Joe Biden would intervene and end the strike using the
Taft-Hartley Act, which allows him to seek an 80-day cooling off
period.</p>
<p>But during an exchange with reporters on Sunday, Biden, who has
worked to court union votes for Democrats, said “no” when asked if he
planned to intervene in the potential work stoppage.</p>
<p>A White House official said Monday that at Biden’s direction, the
administration has been in regular communication with the ILA and the
alliance to keep the negotiations moving forward. The president directed
Chief of Staff Jeff Zients and National Economic Council Director Lael
Brainard to convene the alliance’s board members Monday afternoon and
urge them to resolve the dispute fairly and quickly — in a way that
accounts for the success of shipping companies in recent years and
contributions of union workers.</p>

id="exclusive-africom-chief-says-islamic-state-doubles-size-in-north-somalia">Exclusive:
AFRICOM Chief says Islamic State doubles size in north Somalia</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PENTAGON — Islamic State in Somalia has approximately doubled in size
over the past year, the chief of U.S. Africa Command told VOA.</p>
<p>“I am concerned about the northern part of Somalia and ISIS growing
in numbers,” AFRICOM commander Gen. Michael Langley said in an exclusive
interview, using an acronym for the terror group.</p>
<p>Langley declined to provide the United States’ estimate of how many
Islamic State fighters are in Somalia, other than to say that the
group’s had grown about “twofold” in the past year. Previous estimates
have put the number of Islamic State fighters in north Somalia at about
200 fighters.</p>
<p>The AFRICOM commander also warned about the possibility of Islamic
State increasing its foreign fighter presence in Somalia. </p>
<p>Somali Brigadier General Abdi Hassan Hussein, the former intelligence
and police commander of Puntland, where Islamic State is located in the
north, told VOA earlier this year that the number of Islamic State
foreign fighters there alone is estimated in the hundreds. This figure
has yet to be confirmed by local authorities.</p>
<p>A U.S. official told VOA in June that Abdulqadir Mumin, the leader of
Islamic State in Somalia, had been targeted in an American airstrike in
May. Mumin appears to have survived the strike. </p>
<p>Asked whether Mumin was now the global leader of IS, Langley said the
U.S. must take those reports as “credible.”</p>
<p>“ISIS professes that. Sometimes you’ve got to take that seriously,”
he said.</p>
<p>Al-Shabab </p>
<p>The increase in Islamic State fighters in northern Somalia comes as
the al-Qaida affiliate al-Shabab has exploited diplomatic disagreements
between Somalia and Ethiopia to raise its recruitment numbers. </p>
<p>Landlocked Ethiopia and Somalia’s breakaway Somaliland region signed
a memorandum of understanding earlier this year to use its Red Sea port
of Berbera, a deal that Somalia has rejected. Somali Prime Minister
Hamza Abdi Barre on Friday accused Ethiopia, before the U.N. General
Assembly, of actions that “flagrantly violate” Somalia’s territorial
integrity.</p>
<p>“The have used that (dispute) to their advantage,” Langley told
VOA.</p>
<p>Al-Shabab has been back at high numbers of between 12,000 to 13,000
fighters due to strong financing and heavy recruitment efforts, senior
defense officials told VOA in June.</p>
<p>The political rift has bled into counter-terror cooperation between
Addis Ababa and Mogadishu, with Langley telling VOA that Somali
operations with Ethiopia have been “limited.”</p>
<p>“Time will tell if they can settle their differences and coalesce
into a force that’s very effective, because when they do work together,
they’re very, very effective at clearing out al-Shabab.’’</p>
<p>Al-Shabab has continued attacks on civilians, including in the
Mogadishu area. The terror group claimed responsibility for a gun attack
and suicide bombing that killed at least 32 people in August on a
popular beach in the Somalia’s capital. The group is also suspected to
have carried out two deadly bombings on Saturday, one in Middle Shabelle
region and another about one kilometer from the president’s office.</p>
<p>Al-Shabab has suffered defeats from the South West State of Somalia
down to the Juba River Valley and has sought to reset and counter-attack
in those areas.</p>
<p>However, in central Somalia, al-Shabab has reversed gains made by
Somali forces over the last two years as government forces failed to
hold the terrain they had retaken, according to senior U.S. defense
officials. </p>
<p>“We need a credible holding force, because sometimes shadow
governments of al-Shabaab try to re-insert themselves back in that
region and try to influence some of the local leaders,” Langley
said. </p>
<p>He said the time following the clearing and liberating of a region is
a “very fragile period” where Somalia and partners like the U.S. Agency
for International Development can initiate local services that will
increase the population’s faith in the federal government.</p>
<p>“If they can’t sustain that because they’re moving to the next region
or next district, it ebbs,” he said, adding that U.S. training was
currently focused on helping Somali forces hold liberated terrain.</p>
<p>The Somali government has pointed to the El Dheer and Harardhere
areas as evidence that some liberated terrain in central Somalia remains
under government control.</p>
<p>ATMIS transition</p>
<p>Later this year, the African Union Transition Mission in Somalia will
leave the country after nearly two years of helping Somalia fight
al-Shabab terrorists and will be replaced in 2025 by a new African Union
Support and Stabilization Mission in Somalia. Which forces will be
comprised in the mission is still being worked out by the African Union
and the United Nations.</p>
<p>Langley ruled out any U.S. role in the transition, saying American
forces would maintain only their advise-and-assist mission.</p>
<p>“Our piece of enabling is not our boots on the ground. We’re there to
advise and assist, and assist in their training, but the fight is
theirs,” he told VOA.</p>
<p>Houthis</p>
<p>In addition to Islamic State and al-Shabab, Somalia also must worry
about Iranian-backed Houthi militants in Yemen, just north of Somalia
across the Gulf of Aden, whom Langley says have “aspirations” to
collaborate with al-Shabab.</p>
<p>“We’re concerned, and we’re closely watching that, because this can
turn into a bad neighborhood real quick,” he said.</p>
<p>Should the Houthis and al-Shabab put pressure on the Gulf of Aden
from opposite sides, Langley worries that squeezing this strategic choke
point could further hinder the free flow of commerce and affect the
global economy. And analysts fear that Houthis could insert more
sophisticated weapons into the fight for Somalia.</p>
<p>Houthi militants have targeted more than 80 merchant vessels with
missiles and drones since the war in Gaza started in October, seizing
one, sinking two and killing at least four sailors. Other missiles and
drones have either been intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red
Sea or failed to reach their targets.</p>
<p>The Houthi militant campaign began after Israel launched a
retaliatory attack against Hamas in Gaza following Hamas’ October 7
terror attack, and the Houthis claim they are acting in solidarity with
Palestinians during the war.</p>

to pay $22M to settle claims of sexual discrimination at training
academy</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The FBI agreed Monday to pay more than $22 million to
settle a class-action lawsuit alleging female recruits were singled out
for dismissal in training and routinely harassed by instructors with
sexually charged comments about their breast size, false allegations of
infidelity and the need to take contraception “to control their
moods.”</p>
<p>The payout to 34 women dismissed from the FBI’s training academy in
Quantico, Virginia — still subject to approval by a federal judge —
would rank among the biggest lawsuit settlements in the history of the
bureau.</p>
<p>“These problems are pervasive within the FBI and the attitudes that
created them were learned at the academy,” said David J. Shaffer, the
lawyer for the women. “This case will make important major changes in
these attitudes.”</p>
<p>Filed in 2019, the lawsuit contends that female recruits had been
subjected to a hostile working environment in which they were judged
more harshly than their male peers and “excessively targeted for
correction and dismissal in tactical situations for perceived lack of
judgment” and subjective “suitability.”</p>
<p>One of the women said she was admonished to “smile more” and
subjected to repeated sexual advances. Another said an instructor leered
at her and stared at her chest, “sometimes while licking his lips.”</p>
<p>“Through passive tolerance,” the lawsuit said, “the FBI has
intentionally allowed the Good Old Boy Network to flourish unrestrained
at the FBI Academy.”</p>
<p>The FBI said in a statement Monday that the bureau has “taken
significant steps over the past five years to further ensure gender
equity in the training and development of all our trainees.”</p>
<p>Many of the allegations in the lawsuit were confirmed in a 2022
internal watchdog report. Men still make up some three-quarters of the
bureau’s special agents despite efforts to diversify in recent
years.</p>
<p>Among the provisions of the settlement was that the FBI would offer
the plaintiffs a chance to continue training toward becoming agents,
with “guaranteed placement” for those who pass in one of their top three
preferred field offices. The bureau also has agreed to a review by
outside experts who will work to ensure that female recruits face a fair
evaluation process.</p>
<p>Some of the women have moved on to other careers, Shaffer said,
adding “the FBI has deprived itself of some genuinely exceptional
talent.”</p>
<p>Paula Bird, a lead plaintiff in the case who is now a lawyer, said
that while the experience has been “disillusioning,” she was “pleased
that this settlement will bring a measure of justice to the women who
were unfairly dismissed.”</p>
<p>The lawsuit came amid a flurry of sexual misconduct claims within the
bureau that included several against senior FBI officials identified in
an Associated Press investigation who quietly left the bureau with full
benefits even after allegations against them were substantiated. Those
claims ranged from unwanted touching and advances to coercion. In one
case, an FBI assistant director retired after the inspector general’s
office concluded he harassed a female subordinate and sought an improper
relationship with her.</p>
<p>In response to AP’s reporting, the FBI announced a series of reforms,
including a 24/7 tip line, intended to take a tougher stand against
agents found to have committed misconduct and help accusers.</p>
<p>The latest settlement comes less than six months after the Justice
Department announced a $138.7 million settlement with more than 100
people who accused the FBI of grossly mishandling allegations of sexual
assault against the sports doctor Larry Nassar.</p>

<h2 id="pete-rose-baseballs-banned-hits-leader-has-died-at-age-83">Pete
Rose, baseball’s banned hits leader, has died at age 83</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Pete Rose, baseball’s career hits leader and fallen idol
who undermined his historic achievements and Hall of Fame dreams by
gambling on the game he loved and once embodied, has died. He was
83.</p>
<p>Stephanie Wheatley, a spokesperson for Clark County in Nevada,
confirmed on behalf of the medical examiner that Rose died Monday.
Wheatley said the cause and manner of death had not yet been
determined.</p>
<p>For fans who came of age in the 1960s and ‘70s, no player was more
exciting than the Cincinnati Reds’ No. 14, “Charlie Hustle,” the brash
superstar with the shaggy hair, puggish nose and muscular forearms. At
the dawn of artificial surfaces, divisional play and free agency, Rose
was old school, a conscious throwback to baseball’s early days. Millions
could never forget him crouched and scowling at the plate, running full
speed to first even after drawing a walk, or sprinting for the next base
and diving headfirst into the bag.</p>
<p>A 17-time All-Star, the switch-hitting Rose played on three World
Series winners. He was the National League MVP in 1973 and World Series
MVP two years later. He holds the major league record for games played
(3,562) and plate appearances (15,890) and the NL record for the longest
hitting streak (44). He was the leadoff man for one of baseball’s most
formidable lineups with the Reds’ championship teams of 1975 and 1976,
with teammates that included Hall of Famers Johnny Bench, Tony Perez and
Joe Morgan.</p>
<p>But no milestone approached his 4,256 hits, breaking his hero Ty
Cobb’s 4,191 and signifying his excellence no matter the notoriety that
followed. It was a total so extraordinary that you could average 200
hits for 20 years and still come up short. Rose’s secret was
consistency, and longevity. Over 24 seasons, all but six played entirely
with the Reds, Rose had 200 hits or more 10 times, and more than 180
four other times. He batted .303 overall, even while switching from
second base to outfield to third to first, and he led the league in hits
seven times.</p>
<p>“Every summer, three things are going to happen,” Rose liked to say,
“the grass is going to get green, the weather is going to get hot, and
Pete Rose is going to get 200 hits and bat .300.”</p>
<p>Rose was Rookie of the Year in 1963, but he started off 0 for 12 with
three walks and a hit by pitch before getting his first major league
hit, an eighth-inning triple off Pittsburgh’s Bob Friend. It came in
Cincinnati on April 13, 1963, the day before Rose’s 22nd birthday. He
reached 1,000 in 1968, 2,000 just five years later and 3,000 just five
years after that.</p>
<p>He moved into second place, ahead of Hank Aaron, with hit No. 3,772,
in 1982. No. 4,000 was off the Phillies’ Jerry Koosman in 1984, exactly
21 years to the day after his first hit. He caught up with Cobb on
Sept. 8, 1985, and surpassed him three days later, in Cincinnati, with
Rose’s mother and teenage son, Pete Jr., among those in attendance.</p>
<p>Rose was 44 and the team’s player-manager. Batting left-handed
against the San Diego Padres’ Eric Show in the first inning, he smacked
a 2-1 slider into left field, a clean single. The crowd of 47,000-plus
stood and yelled. The game was halted to celebrate. Rose was given the
ball and the first base bag, then wept openly on the shoulder of first
base coach and former teammate, Tommy Helms.</p>
<p>Baseball Commissioner Peter Ueberroth, watching from New York,
declared that Rose had “reserved a prominent spot in Cooperstown.” After
the game, a 2-0 win for the Reds in which Rose scored both runs, he
received a phone call from President Ronald Reagan.</p>
<p>“Your reputation and legacy are secure,” Reagan told him. “It will be
a long time before anyone is standing in the spot where you’re standing
now.”</p>
<p>Four years later, he was gone.</p>
<p>On March 20, 1989, Ueberroth (who would soon be succeeded by A.
Bartlett Giamatti) announced that his office was conducting a “full
inquiry into serious allegations” about Rose. Reports emerged that he
had been relying on a network of bookies and friends and others in the
gambling world to place bets on baseball games, including some with the
Reds. Rose denied any wrongdoing, but the investigation found that the
“accumulated testimony of witnesses, together with the documentary
evidence and telephone records reveal extensive betting activity by Pete
Rose in connection with professional baseball and, in particular,
Cincinnati Reds games, during the 1985, 1986, and 1987 baseball
seasons.”</p>
<p>Betting on baseball had been a primal sin since 1920, when several
members of the Chicago White Sox were expelled for throwing the 1919
World Series — to the Cincinnati Reds. Baseball’s Rule 21, posted in
every professional clubhouse, proclaims that “Any player, umpire or club
or league official or employee who shall bet any sum whatsoever upon any
baseball game in connection with which the bettor has a duty to perform
shall be declared permanently ineligible.’’</p>
<p>As far back as the 1970s, Bench and others had worried about Rose. By
all accounts, he never bet against his own team, but even betting on the
Reds left himself open to blackmail and raised questions about whether a
given managerial decision was based on his own financial interest.</p>
<p>In August 1989, at a New York press conference, Giamatti spoke some
of the saddest words in baseball history: “One of the game’s greatest
players has engaged in a variety of acts which have stained the game,
and he must now live with the consequences of those acts.” Giamatti
announced that Rose had agreed to a lifetime ban from baseball, a
decision that in 1991 the Hall of Fame would rule left him ineligible
for induction. Rose attempted to downplay the news, insisting that he
had never bet on baseball and that he would eventually be
reinstated.</p>
<p>Within weeks of his announcement, Giamatti was dead from a heart
attack. But the ban remained in place and Rose never made it to the Hall
in his lifetime, although he did receive 41 votes in 1992 (when 323
votes were needed), around the time the Hall formally ruled that those
banned from the game could never be elected. His status was long
debated. Rose’s supporters including Donald Trump, who in 2015, the year
before he was elected president, tweeted: “Can’t believe Major League
Baseball just rejected <span class="citation"
data-cites="PeteRose_14">@PeteRose_14</span> for the Hall of Fame. He’s
paid the price. So ridiculous — let him in!”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, his story changed. In a November 1989 memoir, written with
“The Boys of Summer” author Roger Kahn, Rose again claimed innocence,
only to reverse himself in 2004. He desperately wanted to come back, and
effectively destroyed his chances. He would continue to spend time at
casinos, insisting he was there for promotion, not gambling. He believed
he had “messed up” and that his father would have been ashamed, but he
still bet on baseball, albeit legally.</p>
<p>“I don’t think betting is morally wrong. I don’t even think betting
on baseball is morally wrong,” he wrote in “Play Hungry,” a memoir
released in 2019. “There are legal ways, and there are illegal ways, and
betting on baseball the way I did was against the rules of
baseball.”</p>
