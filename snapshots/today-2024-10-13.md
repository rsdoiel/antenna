## Internet Archive hacked and victim of DDoS attacks

date: 2024-10-13, from: OS News

Internet Archive&#8217;s &#8220;The Wayback Machine&#8221; has suffered a data breach after a threat actor compromised the website and stole a user authentication database containing 31 million unique records. News of the breach began circulating Wednesday afternoon after visitors to archive.org began seeing a JavaScript alert created by the hacker,&#160;stating that the Internet Archive was breached. &#8220;Have you ever felt like the Internet Archive runs on sticks and is constantly on the verge of suffering a catastrophic security breach? It just happened. See 31 million of you on HIBP!,&#8221; reads a JavaScript alert shown on the compromised archive.org site. ↫ Lawrence Abrams at Bleeping Computer To make matters worse, the Internet Archive was also suffering from waves of distributed denial-of-service attacks, forcing the IA to take down the site while strengthening everything up. It seems the attackers have no real motivation, other than the fact they can, but it&#8217;s interesting, shall we say, that the Internet Archive has been under legal assault by big publishers for years now, too. I highly doubt the two are related in any way, but it&#8217;s an interesting note nonetheless. I&#8217;m still catching up on all the various tech news stories, but this one was hard to miss. A lot of people are rightfully angry and dismayed about this, since attacking the Internet Archive like this kind of feels like throwing Molotov cocktails at a local library &#8211; there&#8217;s literally not a single reason to do so, and the only people you&#8217;re going to hurt are underpaid librarians and chill people who just want to read some books. Whomever is behind this are just assholes, no ifs and buts about it.

## Goodbye Windows 7

date: 2024-10-13, from: OS News

I finally seem to be recovering from a nasty flu that is now wreaking havoc all across my tiny Arctic town &#8211; better now than when we hit -40 I guess &#8211; so let&#8217;s talk about something that&#8217;s not going to recover because it actually just fucking died: Windows 7. For nearly everyone, support for Windows 7 ended on January 14th, 2020. However, if you were a business who needed more time to migrate off of it because your CEO didn’t listen to the begging and pleading IT department until a week before the deadline, Microsoft did have an option for you. Businesses could pay to get up to 3 years of extra security updates. This pushes the EOL date for Windows 7 to January 10th, 2023. Okay but that’s still nearly 2 years earlier than October 8th, 2024? ↫ The Cool Blog I&#8217;d like to solve the puzzle! It&#8217;s POSReady, isn&#8217;t it? Of course it is! Windows Embedded POSReady&#8217;s support finally ended a few days ago, and this means that for all intents and purposes, Windows 7 is well and truly dead. In case you happen to be a paleontologist, think of Windows Embedded POSReady adding an extra two years of support to Windows 7 as the mammoths who managed to survive on Wrangel until as late as only 4000 years ago. Windows 7 was one of the good ones, for sure, and all else being equal, I&#8217;d choose it over any of the releases that cam after. It feels like Windows 7 was the last release designed primarily for users of the Windows platform, whereas later releases were designed more to nickle and dime people with services, ads, and upsells that greatly cheapened the operating system. I doubt we&#8217;ll ever see such a return to form again, so Windows 7 might as well be the last truly beloved Windows release. If you&#8217;re still using Windows 7 &#8211; please don&#8217;t, unless you&#8217;re doing it for the retrocomputing thrill. I know Windows 8, 10, and 11 are scary, and as much as it pains me to say this, you&#8217;re better off with 10 or 11 at this point, if only for security concerns.

The reason I’m having so much fun with this mofo is that I have most of the features of textcasting now, and it’s all flowing out through Masto, and I’m not typing into a freaking tiny little text box!

## Hackers Advertise Stolen Verizon Push-to-Talk ‘Call Logs’

The breach does not appear to impact the main consumer Verizon network, and instead involves the company’s push to talk (PTT) product, marketed to public sector agencies and enterprises.

Why does American television and press “both-sides” our politics?  Why are such different presidential candidates presented as equally flawed?  Why do the outrages of Trump, for example at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, lead to the humiliation of Biden?

Trump&#39;s top general calls former president &quot;fascist&quot; and &quot;dangerous&quot; threat. (Not exactly news, but it’s nice to see one pub report it, even if it is just a quote.)

<p>One of the features of using a custom email address with every service or website is that it's easy to see when information gets sold to third parties. Today's inbox let me know it's time to shut down my Macy's alias, and also that Macy's as a company is in some trouble. </p><p>Selling off customer data for reasons other than partnering or targeted advertisements is a short term cash grab move. Interestingly their stock price isn't showing this despiration yet. If I were a market gambler this might be something I'd try to capitalize on.</p>
