## US Supreme Court boosts NRA in free speech fight with New York official

date: 2024-05-30, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court gave a boost on Thursday to the National Rifle Association in its free speech dispute with a New York state official it accused of coercing banks and insurers to avoid doing business with the influential gun rights advocacy group. 


The justices, in a 9-0 decision authored by liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor, threw out a lower court's ruling that dismissed the NRA's 2018 lawsuit against Maria Vullo, a former superintendent of New York's Department of Financial Services. The NRA has claimed that Vullo unlawfully retaliated against it following a mass shooting in which 17 people were killed at a high school in Parkland, Florida. 


At issue in the dispute is whether Vullo had wielded her regulatory power to coerce New York financial institutions into cutting ties with the NRA in violation of protections under the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment against government restrictions on free speech. 


"Ultimately, the critical takeaway is that the First Amendment prohibits government officials from wielding their power selectively to punish or suppress speech, directly or, as alleged here, through private intermediaries," Sotomayor wrote. 


The case will now return to the lower courts for further analysis of the NRA's allegations under the standard articulated in the Supreme Court's ruling. 


Vullo called upon banks and insurers to consider the "reputational risks" of doing business with gun rights groups following the February 2018 Parkland shootings. In the aftermath of the Parkland rampage by a 19-year-old former student armed with an AR-15 rifle, NRA officials lashed out at gun control advocates, arguing that Democratic elites were politicizing the shootings to erode gun rights. 


Vullo later fined Lloyd's of London and two other insurers more than $13 million for offering an NRA-endorsed product called "Carry Guard" that Vullo's office found was in violation of New York insurance law. The product provided liability coverage for policyholders who caused injuries from gunfire, even in cases involving the wrongful use of a firearm.  


The insurers agreed to stop selling NRA-endorsed products that New York considered illegal. 


The NRA's lawsuit, seeking unspecified monetary damages, accused Vullo of unlawfully retaliating against the group for its constitutionally protected gun rights advocacy by targeting it with an "implicit censorship regime." Its suit alleged that New York's "blacklisting" campaign sought to deprive the NRA of basic financial services and threatened its advocacy work. 


The case did not involve the Constitution's Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. 


The Supreme Court heard arguments in the case in March. 


The NRA is the largest and most powerful gun rights organization in the United States and has been instrumental in thwarting Democratic-backed gun restrictions in the U.S. Congress. The nonprofit group is organized under the laws of New York state, with its main offices in Virginia. 


A federal judge in 2021 dismissed all of the NRA's claims apart from two free speech counts against Vullo. The Manhattan-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2022 said those also should have been dismissed, prompting the NRA's Supreme Court appeal. 


The NRA found an unlikely ally in the case in President Joe Biden's administration. Even though Biden has called gun violence a national embarrassment, his administration had urged the justices to let the NRA pursue its lawsuit.  


The administration argued that a lower court should determine whether Vullo's actions crossed the line between permissible criticism of the NRA and coercion aimed at suppressing a disfavored viewpoint in violation of the First Amendment protections. 


The case was the latest to come before the Supreme Court involving the NRA, a group closely aligned with Republicans that has opposed gun control measures and backed pivotal lawsuits that have widened U.S. gun rights.  


Americans remain deeply divided over how to address firearms violence including mass shootings even as the Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has taken an expansive view of gun rights. 


Vullo was sued in both her official and personal capacities. But the 2nd Circuit found that Vullo would be protected from suit under the legal defense of qualified immunity that shields officials from civil litigation in certain circumstances. 


The Supreme Court by the end of June is expected to issue rulings in two gun rights cases. One involves a challenge to the legality of a federal ban on "bump stock" devices that enable semiautomatic weapons to fire rapidly like machine guns. The other involves a challenge to the legality of a federal law that makes it a crime for people under domestic violence restraining orders to have guns.

## US sanctions Ugandan officials over graft, rights abuse claims

date: 2024-05-30, from: VOA News USA

Nairobi — The United States said on Thursday it was imposing sanctions on five senior Ugandan officials over accusations of involvement in corruption or human rights abuses.


Ugandan parliament speaker Anita Among was one of four officials the US State Department said would face travel bans because of "significant corruption", following similar action by Britain last month.


Mary Goretti Kitutu and Agnes Nandutu -- previously ministers responsible for Uganda's isolated and impoverished border region of Karamoja -- and former state minister for finance Amos Lugolobi were also named.


State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said in a statement the three had "misused public resources and diverted materials from Uganda's neediest communities".


"All four officials abused their public positions for their personal benefit at the expense of Ugandans," he added.


In addition, Peter Elwelu, former deputy chief of the Ugandan Peoples' Defense Forces (UPDF), has been sanctioned "due to his involvement in gross violations of human rights", he said.


While commanding defense forces, Elwelu was involved in extrajudicial killings committed by UPDF members, Miller said, without giving further information.


"As a result of these actions, the designated Ugandan officials are generally ineligible for entry into the United States."


Miller said Washington is also planning to impose visa restrictions on multiple other Ugandan officials for "undermining the democratic process and repressing members of marginalized or vulnerable populations in Uganda".


In April, the British government imposed travel bans and asset freezes on Among, Kitutu and Nandutu over claims of corruption.


At the time the Ugandan parliament said the sanctions on Among were based on a "false premise" and imposed because of her stance on the East African country's controversial anti-gay legislation adopted last year.


Kitutu and Nandutu are accused of stealing roofing materials destined for the poor under a government-funded project and redirecting them to politicians and their families.

Several major pension funds said ahead of the meeting that they would vote to remove most of Exxon’s board after the company sued activist shareholders pushing for stronger emissions reduction targets. Though most of its petrochemical peers have similar targets, the company argued that the activists’ true goal was to “interfere with ExxonMobil’s business and to promote their own interests over those of ExxonMobil’s shareholders.” </p><p>The resistance effort “amounted to a test of whether top fund firms would rally to defend the small shareholders whose resolutions have put topics like the environment and workforce diversity at the center of many corporate annual meetings,” <em>Reuters</em> said. “Wednesday’s results suggested the answer was no.” All 12 of Exxon’s director nominees received between 87% and 98% support at the meeting, the company reported. The activists, meanwhile, withdrew their proposal in February, but Exxon is still <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-27/exxon-xom-investor-sued-for-climate-proposal-promises-to-back-off?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9gJ_DIPUbYqw6sXhacTKpnisetIEAskAdY7ePtjJPDCN-nXVgztEZO2X-RhIbyBXhqbSsB" target="_blank">pursuing the matter</a> in court.</p><h3>2. EV charging companies hire former Tesla employees</h3><p>The U.S. electric vehicle sector is <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/how-charging-rivals-plan-to-thrive-on-teslas-chaos/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9gJ_DIPUbYqw6sXhacTKpnisetIEAskAdY7ePtjJPDCN-nXVgztEZO2X-RhIbyBXhqbSsB" target="_blank">snapping up</a> Tesla employees who were laid off when the company gutted its charging team last month. Atlanta-based charging provider EnviroSpark Energy Solutions has hired a dozen of them, <em>E&E News</em> reported, while other charging companies have landed high-profile hires let go by Tesla or are in talks to do so. “It does present an awesome opportunity for other charging operators like us to fill in the gap,” David Jankowsky, CEO of Francis Energy, told <em>E&E News</em>. There is still some trepidation, however, over how Tesla’s tribulations could affect the broader industry’s future. Despite its poor recent performance, Tesla still dominates the U.S. EV market, so a dip in consumer confidence could have negative ripple effects on EV uptake.</p><h3>3. Rich countries meet $100 billion aid target two years late</h3><p>The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development announced Wednesday that the world’s rich countries had <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b9f24e37-9154-4fc4-b410-25f45782b8ba?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9gJ_DIPUbYqw6sXhacTKpnisetIEAskAdY7ePtjJPDCN-nXVgztEZO2X-RhIbyBXhqbSsB" target="_blank">met their goal</a> of delivering $100 billion in annual climate finance to poorer countries in 2022 — two years after their self-imposed deadline, the group said. The 2020 target was first set at the 2009 United Nations climate change conference in Copenhagen, and the delay in meeting it had strained recent climate talks. Developed countries came up with $115.9 billion in climate finance in 2022, <a href="https://www.oecd.org/newsroom/developed-countries-materially-surpassed-their-usd-100-billion-climate-finance-commitment-in-2022-oecd.htm?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9gJ_DIPUbYqw6sXhacTKpnisetIEAskAdY7ePtjJPDCN-nXVgztEZO2X-RhIbyBXhqbSsB" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">OECD data shows</a>, an increase of 30% from 2021. That’s the biggest year-on-year jump so far. “Exceeding this annual commitment materially by more than 15% is an important and symbolic achievement which goes some way towards making up for the two-year delay, which should help build trust,” OECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann said in a statement.</p><p>Climate advocates warned, however, that achieving this aim is not an end point in itself. Transitioning to clean energy and adapting to new climate realities are both expensive processes. “While domestic finance, strong policies and private finance are important, for these countries, international public finance needs to play a lynchpin role,” Melanie Robinson, global climate, economics and finance director at the World Resources Institute, said in a statement. Discussions about setting a new climate finance goal will be a centerpiece of COP29 in Azerbaijan.</p><h3>4. An IRA rebate roll-out</h3><p>New York will be the first state to launch home energy rebates created by the Inflation Reduction Act, the Biden administration announced Thursday. The initial phase of New York’s $158 million rebate program will be aimed at single-family homes and multifamily properties with up to four units, while later phases will expand to larger buildings and retailers. It will provide up to $14,000 per housing unit for upgrades such as better insulation, heat pumps, and heat pump water heaters. A separate, $159 million IRA home efficiency rebate program is expected to follow. Massachusetts, Michigan and Rhode Island have all applied for the funding to establish their own home energy rebate programs under the IRA — a process that’s turned out to be <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/biden-heat-pump-rebates?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9gJ_DIPUbYqw6sXhacTKpnisetIEAskAdY7ePtjJPDCN-nXVgztEZO2X-RhIbyBXhqbSsB" target="_self">messier</a> than some had hoped, according to Heatmap’s Emily Pontecorvo. </p><h3>5.

Globally, the average person experienced 26 more extra-hot days due to climate change, while in a few countries, that number exceeded 120, according to the report by Climate Central, the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre, and World Weather Attribution. The researchers considered temperatures abnormal when they exceeded 90% of a location’s daily readings recorded between 1991 and 2020. Americans experienced 39 such days in total over the last 12 months. Almost 80% of the world’s population experienced 31 or more.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

## Help identify these obscure operating systems and vendors

date: 2024-05-30, from: OS News

Over on the GNU config-patches mailing list, Zack Weinberg is looking for help identifying a number of ancient operating systems and vendors. These are probably all either vendor or OS names from the late 1980s or early 1990s. Can anyone help me fill out the following list of things that ought to appear in testsuite/config-sub.data, if I knew what to put in place of the question marks? ???-pc533 ???-pc533-??????-sim ???-sim-??????-ultra ???-ultra-??????-unicom ???-unicom-??????-acis ???-???-aos???-triton ???-???-sysv3???-oss ???-???-sysv3???-storm-chaos ???-???-??? ↫ Zack Weinberg One of them has already been identified &#8211; &#8220;storm-chaos&#8221; turns out to have been added to binutils and/or maybe GCC in 2000, and after some digging around, John Marshall found what it&#8217;s referring to: chaos, a hobby operating system for x86 written in C. It has a long history, and after a period of inactivity came back in 2015 with a new website. Some new releases followed, with the last one being version 0.3.0 in 2019. It&#8217;s been silence since then. The others are still up for grabs to be discovered. There is some talk that the pc533 one might be a misspelling of pc532, which would refer to the &#8220;NS32K-based PC532 board running NetBSD&#8221;. This is an incredibly obscure complete system built around the NS32532, of which only around 150 were built in the early &#8217;90s. However, Weinberg is hesitant to accept this theory without more information, since there is already code to handle the pc532, and he wants to be sure before making any changes. If there is one place on the internet outside of the GNU mailing lists that might be able to help Weinberg, it&#8217;s the OSNews audience. We have so many older people reading OSNews who have been working or otherwise active in this field for many decades, and I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if these cryptic names make some bells ring for some of you. If one of you does e-mail a reply, be sure to mention this article &#8211; organic marketing to help keep us going!

## AI and the English language

## US official, Chinese counterpart holds talks amid effort to avert unintended conflict

date: 2024-05-30, from: VOA News USA

STATE DEPARTMENT — Deputy U.S. Secretary of State Kurt Campbell is hosting China’s Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu in Washington on Thursday. The talks are aimed at maintaining open communication channels to prevent miscalculations and unintended conflicts, especially during times of tension.


Following two hours of face-to-face discussions, officials from the United States and the People's Republic of China will have a working lunch at the State Department. Later in the afternoon, U.S. Deputy National Security Adviser Jon Finer will continue discussions with Ma.


The visit by Ma Zhaoxu follows U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s trip to Shanghai and Beijing in April. Officials said it builds on U.S.’s intensive diplomacy with the PRC to responsibly manage competition in the relationship, even in areas where the two countries disagree.  


“As we continue to take actions to protect our interests and values and those of our allies and partners, we are also using face-to-face diplomacy with the PRC to clearly and directly communicate our positions and intentions, and make progress on bilateral, regional, and global issues that matter to the American people and the world,” a State Department spokesperson told VOA.  


A spokesperson from PRC’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Ma will also “interact and communicate with representatives from various sectors in the U.S.” during his visit to the U.S. from May 30 to June 2.


While in Beijing last month, Blinken voiced "serious concern" regarding China's support for Russia's defense industry, warning Chinese leaders that Washington could impose sanctions over the matter.


China has defended its approach to Russia, saying it is only engaged in normal economic exchanges with a major trading partner. 


Wednesday, Campbell renewed the U.S. warnings. He said Chinese support was helping to revitalize Russia's military capabilities, including long-range missiles, artillery, drones and battlefield tracking.


During his visit to Brussels, the State Department's second-highest diplomat emphasized the urgent need for European and NATO countries "to send a collective message of concern to China about its actions, which we view are destabilizing in the heart of Europe."


The latest U.S.-China talks occur just days after China conducted a large-scale, two-day military exercise involving 111 aircraft and 46 naval vessels around Taiwan. Washington has strongly urged Beijing to exercise restraint and has reaffirmed the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.


U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for China and Taiwan Mark Lambert met virtually with PRC’s Director-General for Boundary and Ocean Affairs Hong Liang on May 23.  During this meeting, Lambert expressed profound concerns regarding People’s Liberation Army joint military drills in the Taiwan Strait and around Taiwan.

## First Ukrainian pilots graduate from F-16 training in US

date: 2024-05-30, from: VOA News USA

the Pentagon   — The first Ukrainian pilots have completed F-16 fighter jet training at a military base in Arizona, with others soon to follow this summer.


"The first batch has graduated, and other Ukrainian pilots are finishing their training here by the end of August," Arizona National Guard spokesperson Capt. Erin Hannigan told VOA.


The graduates include a handful of Ukrainian pilots who had trained at Morris Air National Guard Base in Tucson, according to a U.S. official who spoke to VOA on condition of anonymity because of security sensitivities.


Out of an abundance of caution for the pilots’ safety, officials declined to provide an exact number of how many had graduated or the number of those who remain in F-16 training.


The 162nd Wing at Morris is considered the Air National Guard’s premier F-16 training unit and houses the Air Force’s only school dedicated to training pilots from more than 20 countries on the fighter.


Kyiv pleaded for Western aircraft when Russia launched its full-scale invasion of their country in February 2022. In August 2023, U.S. President Joe Biden approved a plan for Western allies to send F-16s to Ukraine once pilot training was complete.


Last August, Ukraine was gaining momentum in the conflict against Russia, but that was before a monthslong delay by Congress to approve new military assistance for Kyiv.


Since then, Ukrainian officials reported that troops were forced to ration supplies as ammunition ran low. Analysts say Russia has capitalized on Kyiv’s disadvantage to make gains on the battlefield.


Last month, Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo said his country's promised jets would be delivered to Kyiv by the end of the year.

<p>The ability of LLMs to execute commands through plain language (e.g. English) has enabled agentic systems that can complete a user query by orchestrating the right set of tools (e.g. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.04761">ToolFormer</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15334">Gorilla</a>). This, along with the recent multi-modal efforts such as the GPT-4o or Gemini-1.5 model, has expanded the realm of possibilities with AI agents. While this is quite exciting, the large model size and computational requirements of these models often requires their inference to be performed on the cloud. This can create several challenges for their widespread adoption. First and foremost, uploading data such as video, audio, or text documents to a third party vendor on the cloud, can result in privacy issues. Second, this requires cloud/Wi-Fi connectivity which is not always possible. For instance, a robot deployed in the real world may not always have a stable connection. Besides that, latency could also be an issue as uploading large amounts of data to the cloud and waiting for the response could slow down response time, resulting in unacceptable time-to-solution. These challenges could be solved if we deploy the LLM models locally at the edge.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>However, current LLMs like GPT-4o or Gemini-1.5 are too large for local deployment. One contributing factor is that a lot of the model size ends up memorizing general information about the world into its parametric memory which may not be necessary for a specialized downstream application. For instance, if you ask a general factual question from these models like a historical event or well-known figures, they can produce the results using their parametric memory, even without having additional context in their prompt. However, it seems like this implicit memorization of training data into the parametric memory is correlated with “emergent” phenomena in LLMs such as in-context learning and complex reasoning, which has been the driving force behind scaling the model size.</p>

<p>However, this leads to an intriguing research question: 
<br /></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <strong>Can a smaller language model with significantly less parametric memory emulate such emergent ability of these larger language models?</strong>
</div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>Achieving this would significantly reduce the computational footprint of agentic systems and thus enable efficient and privacy-preserving edge deployment. Our study demonstrates that this is feasible for small language models through training with specialized, high-quality data that does not require recalling generic world knowledge.</p>

<p>Such a system could particularly be useful for semantic systems where the AI agent’s role is to understand the user query in natural language and, instead of responding with a ChatGPT-type question answer response, orchestrate the right set of tools and APIs to accomplish the user’s command. For example, in a Siri-like application, a user may ask a language model to create a calendar invite with particular attendees. If a predefined script for creating calendar items already exists, the LLM simply needs to learn how to invoke this script with the correct input arguments (such as attendees’ email addresses, event title, and time). This process does not require recalling/memorization of world knowledge from sources like Wikipedia, but rather requires reasoning and learning to call the right functions and to correctly orchestrate them.</p>

<p>Our goal is to develop Small Language Models (SLM) that are capable of complex reasoning that could be deployed securely and privately at the edge. Here we will discuss the research directions that we are pursuing to that end. First, we discuss how we can enable small open-source models to perform accurate function calling, which is a key component of agentic systems. It turns out that off-the-shelf small models have very low function calling capabilities. We discuss how we address this by systematically curating high-quality data for function calling, using a specialized Mac assistant agent as our driving application. We then show that fine-tuning the model on this high quality curated dataset, can enable SLMs to even exceed GPT-4-Turbo’s function calling performance. We then show that this could be further improved and made efficient through a new Tool RAG method. Finally, we show how the final models could be deployed efficiently at the edge with real time responses.</p>

<i>Figure 1: Overview of the LLMCompiler Function Calling Planner. The Planner understands the user query and generates a sequence of tasks with their inter-dependencies. These tasks are then dispatched by the LLMCompiler framework to accomplish the user command. In this example, Task \$1 and \$2 are fetched together to retrieve the email addresses of Sid and Lutfi independently. After each task is performed, the results are forwarded to Task \$3 which creates the calendar event. Before executing Task \$3, LLMCompiler replaces the placeholder variables (e.g., the variable \$1 and \$2 in Task \$3) with actual values. 
</i>
</p>

<p>As mentioned above, our main interest is applications where the AI agent translates the user query into a sequence of function calls to complete the tasks. In such applications, the model doesn’t need to write the function definition itself since the functions (or APIs) are mostly pre-defined and already available. Therefore, what the model needs to do is to determine (i) which functions to call, (ii) the corresponding input arguments, and (iii) the right order of calling these functions (i.e. function orchestration) based on the required interdependency across the function calls.</p>

<p>The first question is to find an effective way to equip SLMs to perform function calling. Large models such as GPT-4 are able to perform function calling, but how can this be achieved with open source models? <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.04511">LLMCompiler</a> is a recent framework from our group that enables this by instructing the LLM to output a <strong>function calling plan</strong> that includes the set of functions that it needs to call along with the input arguments and their dependencies (see the example in Figure 1). Once this function calling plan is generated, we can parse it and call each function based on the dependencies.</p>

<p>The critical part here is to teach the model to create this function calling plan with the right syntax and dependency. The original LLMCompiler paper only considered large models, such as LLaMA-2 70B, which have complex reasoning capabilities to create the plan when provided with sufficient instructions in their prompts. However, can smaller models be prompted the same way to output the correct function calling plan? Unfortunately, our experiments showed that off-the-shelf small models such as TinyLLaMA-1.1B (or even the larger Wizard-2-7B model) are not able to output the correct plans. The errors ranged from problems such as using the wrong set of functions, hallucinated names, wrong dependencies, inconsistent syntax, etc.</p>

<p>This is rather expected because these small models have been trained on generic datasets and primarily targeted to achieve good accuracy on general benchmarks which mostly test the model’s world knowledge and general reasoning or basic instruction following capability. To address this, we explored if fine-tuning these models on a high-quality dataset specially curated for function calling and planning can improve the accuracy of these small language models for a targeted task, potentially outperforming larger models. Next, we first discuss how we generated such a dataset, and then discuss the fine tuning approach.</p>

<h1 id="dataset-generation">Dataset Generation</h1>

<i>Figure 2: TinyAgent is an assistant that can interact with various MacOS applications to assist the user. The commands can be given to it through either text through a spotlight input, or through voice. 
</i>
</p>

<p>As a driving application, we consider a local agentic system for Apple’s Macbook that solves user’s day-to-day tasks, as shown in Figure 2. Particularly, the agent is equipped with 16 different functions that can interact with different applications on Mac, which includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Email</strong>: Compose a new email or reply to/forward emails</li>
  <li><strong>Contacts</strong>: Retrieve phone numbers or email addresses from the contacts database</li>
  <li><strong>SMS</strong>: Send text messages to contact(s)</li>
  <li><strong>Calendar</strong>: Create calendar events with details such as title, time, attendees, etc.</li>
  <li><strong>Notes</strong>: Create, open, or append content to notes in various folders</li>
  <li><strong>Reminder</strong>: Set reminders for various activities and tasks</li>
  <li><strong>File management</strong>: Open, read, or summarize documents in various file paths</li>
  <li><strong>Zoom meetings</strong>: Schedule and organize Zoom meetings</li>
</ul>

<p>Predefined Apple scripts exist for each of these functions/tools, and all that the model needs to do is to take advantage of the predefined APIs and determine the right function calling plan to accomplish a given task, such as in Figure 1. But as discussed previously, we need some data for evaluating and training small language models since their off-the-shelf function calling capability is subpar.</p>

<p>Creating handcrafted data with diverse function calling plans is both challenging and not scalable. However, we can curate synthetic data using an LLM like GPT-4-Turbo. Such an approach is becoming a common method where a capable LLM is instructed to generate data similar to a given set of sample examples or templates (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.15042">LLM2LLM</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10560">Self-Instruct</a>). In our work, we used a similar approach, but instead of providing the LLM with generic user queries as templates, we provide it with various sets of functions and instruct it to generate realistic user queries that require those functions to accomplish the task, along with the associated function calling plan and input arguments, like the example shown in Figure 1. To verify the validity of the generated data, we incorporated sanity checks on the function calling plan to make sure that they form a feasible graph, and that the function names and input argument types are correct. With this approach, we created 80K training data, 1K validation data, and 1K testing data, with a total cost of only ~$500.</p>

<br />
<i>Figure 3: Graph Isomorphism Success Rate. The model scores a success rate of 1 only if the DAG of its generated plan is isomorphic to the DAG of the ground truth plan; and 0 otherwise. In above example, for the top case, although the order of the get_email_address calls are different from the ground truth plan (the ground truth plan gets the email address of Lutfi before Sid, and the generated plan gets the email address of Sid before Lutfi), since the two DAGs are isomorphic to each other, the plan gets 1 success rate. For the bottom case, since the predicted DAG contains a wrong node, corresponding to a wrong function call, the plan gets 0 success rate.
</i>
</p>

<p>With our dataset in place, we can now proceed to fine-tune off-the-shelf SLMs to enhance their function calling capability. We started with two base small models: TinyLlama-1.1B (instruct-32k version) and Wizard-2-7B. For fine-tuning these models, we first need to define a metric to evaluate their performance. Our objective is for these models to accurately generate the right plan, which involves not only selecting the right set of functions, but also correctly orchestrating them in the right order. Therefore, we define a success rate metric that assigns 1 if both criteria are met, and 0 otherwise. Checking whether the model has selected the right set function calls is straightforward. To additionally ensure that the orchestration of these functions is correct, we construct a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of the function calls based on the dependencies, as shown in Figure 3, where each node represents a function call and a directed edge from node A to B represents their interdependency (i.e. function B can only be executed after the execution of function A). Then we compare if this DAG is identical to that of the ground truth plan to verify the accuracy of the dependencies.</p>

<p>After defining our evaluation metric, we applied LoRA to fine-tune the models for 3 epochs using a learning rate of 7e-5 over the 80K training examples, and selected the best checkpoint based on validation performance. For fine-tuning, our prompt included not only the descriptions of the ground truth functions (i.e. functions used in the ground truth plan) but also other irrelevant functions as negative samples. We found the negative samples to be particularly effective for teaching the model how to select appropriate tools for a given query, hence improving the post-training performance. Furthermore, we also include several in-context examples demonstrating how queries are translated into a function calling plans. These in-context examples are selected through a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) process based on the user query from the data in the training dataset.</p>

<p>Using the above settings, we fine-tuned TinyLlama-1.1B/Wizard-2-7B models. After fine-tuning, the 1.1B model improved the success rate from 12.71% to 78.89%, and the 7B model performance improved from 41.25% to 83.09%, which is ~4% higher than GPT-4-Turbo.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="https://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/tiny-agent/Figure4.png" width="75%" />
<br />
<i>Figure 4: Efficient Tool Selection Based on User Input. Not all user inputs require all available tools; hence, it is imperative to select the right set of tools to minimize the prompt size and increase performance. In this case, the LLM only needs the functions that get email addresses and create a calendar event in its prompt to accomplish its task.
</i>
</p>

<p>Our primary goal is to be able to deploy the TinyAgent model locally on a Macbook, which has limited computational and memory resources available as compared to the GPUs that closed-source models like GPT are deployed on. To achieve efficient performance with low latency we need to ensure that not only the model size is small, but that the input prompt is as concise as possible. The latter is an important contributor to latency and computational resource consumption due to the quadratic complexity of attention on sequence length.</p>

<p>The fine-tuned TinyAgent model discussed previously was fine-tuned with the description of all available tools in its prompt. However, this is pretty inefficient. We can significantly reduce the prompt size by only including the description of relevant tools based on the user query. For instance, consider the example shown in Figure 4 above, where the user is asking to create a calendar invite with two people. In this case, the LLM only needs the functions that get email addresses and create a calendar event in its prompt.</p>

<p>To take advantage of this observation, we need to determine which functions are required to accomplish the user’s command, which we refer to as Tool RAG given its similarity with how Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) works. However, there is an important subtlety. If we use a basic RAG method where we compute the embedding of the user query and use that to retrieve the relevant tools, we get very low performance. This is because completing a user’s query often requires using several auxiliary tools which may be missed with a simple RAG method if the embedding of the auxiliary tool is not similar to the user query. For instance, the example shown in Figure 4 requires calling get_email_address function even though the user query is just asking about creating a calendar invitation.</p>

<p>This can be addressed by treating the problem as a classification of which tools are needed. To that end, we fine-tuned a DeBERTa-v3-small model on the training data to perform a 16-way classification as shown in Figure 5. The user query is given as an input to this model, and then we pass the CLS token at the end through a simple fully connected layer of size 768x16 to transform it into a 16 dimensional vector (which is the total size of our tools). The output of this layer is passed through a sigmoid layer to produce the probability of selecting each tool. During inference, we select the tools that have probably higher than 50%, and if so, we include their description in the prompt. On average we noticed that only 3.97 tools are retrieved with a recall of 0.998, whereas the basic RAG requires using the top 6 tools to achieve a tool recall of 0.968.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">

<br />
<i>Figure 5: Overview of our Tool RAG scheme. We formulate tool retrieval as a multi-label classification problem. The user query is given as input to the fine-tuned DeBERTa-v3-small model, which outputs a 16-dimensional vector indicating tool probabilities. Tools with probabilities higher than 50% are selected, averaging 3.97 tools per query compared to 6 tools in basic RAG.
</i>
</p>

<p>We evaluated the model performance after incorporating Tool RAG. The results are shown in Table 1 below, where we report the performance of the simple RAG system along with the fine-tuned DeBERTa approach. As one can see, the DeBERTa based Tool RAG method achieves almost perfect recall performance, improves the baseline accuracy, while reducing the prompt size by ~2x tokens.</p>

<h1 id="fast-edge-deployment-with-quantization">Fast Edge Deployment with Quantization</h1>
<p>Deploying models at the edge, such as on consumer MacBooks, can still be challenging even for small models of O(1B) parameters, since loading the model parameters can consume a large portion of the available memory. A solution to these issues is quantization, which allows us to store the model at a reduced bit precision. Quantization not only reduces the storage requirements and model footprint, but also cuts down the time and resources needed to load model weights into memory, thereby reducing the overall inference latency as well (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.13630">this</a> for more information on quantization).</p>

<p>For more efficient deployment of the models, we quantized the models into 4-bit with a group size of 32, which is supported by the llama.cpp framework with quantization aware training. As shown in Table 2, the 4-bit models result in 30% better latency, along with a 4x reduction in the model size. We also notice slight accuracy improvement which is due to the additional fine-tuning with simulated quantization.</p>

<p>Below is the demo of the final TinyAgent-1.1B model deployed on a Macbook Pro M3 which you can actually download and install on your Mac and test as well. It not only runs all of the model inference locally on your computer, but it also allows you to provide commands through audio. We process the audio locally as well using the Whisper-v3 model from OpenAI deployed locally using the whisper.cpp framework. The greatest surprise for us was that the accuracy of the 1.1B model exceeds that of GPT-4-Turbo, and is markedly fast while deployed locally and privately on device.</p>

<p>To summarize, we introduced TinyAgent and showed that it is indeed possible to train a small language model and use it to power a semantic system that processes user queries. In particular, we considered a Siri-like assistant for Mac as a driving application. The key components for enabling it is to (i) teach off-the-shelf SLMs to perform function calling through LLMCompiler framework, (ii) curate high quality function calling data for the task at hand, (iii) fine-tune the off-the-shelf model on the generated data, and (iv) enable efficient deployment by optimizing the prompt size through only retrieving the necessary tools based on the user query through a method called ToolRAG, as well as quantized model deployment to reduce inference resource consumption. After these steps, our final models achieved 80.06% and 84.95% for the TinyAgent1.1.B and 7B models which exceed GPT-4-Turbo’s success rate of 79.08% on this task.</p>

## Google is killing off the messaging service inside Google Maps

date: 2024-05-29, from: OS News

Google is killing off a messaging service! This one is the odd &#8220;Google Business Messaging&#8221; service—basically an instant messaging client that is built into Google Maps. If you looked up a participating business in Google Maps or Google Search on a phone, the main row of buttons in the place card would read something like &#8220;Call,&#8221; &#8220;Chat,&#8221; &#8220;Directions,&#8221; and &#8220;Website.&#8221; That &#8220;Chat&#8221; button is the service we&#8217;re talking about. It would launch a full messaging interface inside the Google Maps app, and businesses were expected to use it for customer service purposes. Google&#8217;s deeply dysfunctional messaging strategy might lead people to joke about a theoretical &#8220;Google Maps Messaging&#8221; service, but it already exists and has existed for years, and now it&#8217;s being shut down. ↫ Ron Amadeo at Ars Technica When it comes to Google, it&#8217;s often hard to distinguish meme from reality.

## Vox Media and The Atlantic sign content deals with OpenAI

date: 2024-05-29, from: OS News

Speaking of The Verge, its parent company Vox Media, along with The Atlantic, have signed a deal with OpenAI. Two more media companies have signed licensing agreements with OpenAI, allowing their content to be used to train its AI models and be shared inside of ChatGPT. The Atlantic and Vox Media — The Verge’s parent company — both announced deals with OpenAI on Wednesday. ↫ Emilia David at The Verge In the case of Vox Media, the deal was made and announced without informing their staff, which obviously doesn&#8217;t sit well with especially Vox&#8217; writers. By making deals like this, upper management gets to double-dip on the fruits of their workers&#8217; labour &#8211; first, the published content generates ad revenues, and second, OpenAI pays them to use said content for training and other purposes. And once the &#8220;AI&#8221; gets good enough, more and more of the writers will be fired, leaving only a skeleton crew of lower-paid workers to clean up the &#8220;AI&#8221; output. With this deal, the writing is on the wall for every journalist at Vox Media &#8211; you&#8217;re currently contributing to your own obsolescence, and your bosses are getting paid for it.

Regardless, I&#8217;ll sell the past 20-odd years of my terrible takes for 69 million euros, after deducting Swedish taxes. And since OpenAI is run by billionaires: taxes are this thing where normal people pay a portion of their income to the government in return for various government services. It&#8217;s wild, I know.

## The Swiss Army Knife of Clean Energy Tax Credits Goes Into Effect Next Year

(The actual eligibility for each tax credit for each technology has changed <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/solar-production-tax-credit-inflation-reduction-act/703078/" style="" target="_blank">various times</a> over the years, but that’s the gist.)</p><p>Starting in 2025, however, and lasting (absent any change in the law) through at least 2032, that tax credit regime will be made “technology neutral.” Goodbye, existing credits with their limited applicability. Hello, new tax credits that apply to “any clean energy facility that achieves net-zero greenhouse gas emissions,” according to a <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2376" style="" target="_blank">release</a> issued Wednesday by the Treasury Department.<br/><br/>“For too long, the U.S. solar and wind markets have been hampered by uncertainty due to the on-again-off-again nature of key tax credits,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on a call with reporters. “Periods of indecision and the credits being repeatedly allowed to elect to lapse made it too difficult for companies to plan and invest in clean energy projects.”</p><p>About that “at least”: The tax credits only start to phase out when Treasury determines that electricity-related greenhouse gas emissions have been reduced 75% from their 2022 levels <em style="">or </em>in 2032, whichever comes later, making this the rare tax code provision with an outcome-based timeline.<strong><em></em></strong></p><p>In preparation for the new Clean Electricity Production Credit and Clean Electricity Investment Credit, a.k.a. sections 45Y and 48E of the U.S. tax code, to go into effect, Treasury proposed guidance outlining what would qualify for the tax credits and soliciting comments on forms of power generation whose true carbon abatement potentials are more in doubt. The notice and subsequent publication in the Federal Register kicks off a 60-day public comment period, after which Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service will write the final rules. </p><p>The new list of eligible technologies includes “hydropower, marine and hydrokinetic, nuclear fission and fusion, geothermal,” along with “certain types of waste energy recovery property” as among the technologies that will be “categorically” eligible for the new tax credits. The point here isn’t to create more exclusivity, but rather to “provide clarity and certainty to developers,” Treasury said in the release. Yellen added that, “for the first time, these incentives are tied explicitly to electricity generation with zero emissions instead of specific technologies.”</p><p>What this announcement does not clarify, however, is what to do about energy sources that involve combustion, such as biomass or harnessing methane emitted from landfills. Here is where the Treasury Department is asking for help from outside — many of the questions included in the proposed rulemaking are devoted to figuring out exactly how these forms of energy might or might not be made zero-emission.</p><p>Many environmental groups <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/press-releases/biogas-and-synthetic-gas-not-solution-polluting-natural-gas-todays-us-energy-system" target="_blank"><u>are skeptical of any combustion-based energy sources</u></a>, and Treasury said that generation methods which “rely on combustion or gasification to produce electricity” will have to “undergo a <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/life-cycle-analysis-study" target="_blank">lifecycle greenhouse gas analysis</a> to demonstrate net-zero emissions.” </p>

## Blinken pledges US support for Moldova amid rising Russian threats

date: 2024-05-29, from: VOA News USA

State Department  — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to Moldova, pledging $135 million to enhance energy security and counter Russian disinformation during his visit to Chisinau.


During Wednesday’s visit, Blinken announced that up to $85 million in USAID funding will subsidize equipment to strengthen Moldova’s national power grid and facilitate greater electricity trade with Romania, Ukraine, and the broader European market. He also unveiled additional aid for Moldova, a pro-Western country facing renewed threats from Russia.


“Today, I'm announcing that we'll be working with our Congress to provide an additional $50 million to further advance these efforts from reforming the energy and agricultural sectors to pushing back and further against disinformation,” said Blinken during a joint press conference with Moldova President Maia Sandu.


“That in turn will bolster the ability of Moldova to resist Russian interference, to hold free and fair elections to continue down the path to the European Union and Western integration to create more economic opportunity,” he said.


Watch related report by Veronica Balderas Iglesias: 




Blinken’s trip comes amid concerns over Russia's military presence in Moldova's breakaway Transnistria region. Moldova has accused Russia of waging a hybrid war through election interference and disinformation campaigns aimed at toppling the government and hindering its EU aspirations. Russia denies these accusations.


Sandu welcomed Blinken’s second visit in two years as "a strong sign of support."


"Through unity and with the support of our partners, we will stand by our people and move forward," Sandu said during the press conference.


She also expressed gratitude for U.S. support to both Moldova and Ukraine. Since Russia's 2022 invasion, the Biden administration has directed billions of dollars in weapons assistance to Ukraine, which Sandu said "also makes Moldova safer and more resilient."




Historically, Moldova’s heavy reliance on outside energy resources has made the country vulnerable to external disruptions and price fluctuations, delaying its progress toward sustainable economic development. Russia’s aggression against Ukraine has further exacerbated Moldova’s energy challenges by driving up electricity and gas prices and creating sector instability.


Since Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the United States has provided Moldova with $774 million in assistance, including $300 million through USAID, to support energy security.


NATO, Ukraine


After Chisinau, Blinken is heading to Prague for NATO foreign ministers’ meetings, where “a substantial show of support for Ukraine” is expected, according to U.S. officials.


On Wednesday, Blinken said the U.S. is working hard to deliver more air defenses to Ukraine as it defends itself against intensifying Russian attacks.




But Blinken, along with other officials from the Biden administration, said Washington does not encourage or enable the use of U.S.-supplied weapons to strike inside Russia.


“Ukraine has to make its own decisions about the best way to effectively defend itself,” Blinken said. ‘’We're going to make sure that it has the equipment it needs.”


This week, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg urged the alliance's members to lift some of the restrictions on Ukraine's use of Western weapons, potentially enabling their use for strikes directly on Russian soil.


“The right to self-defense includes hitting legitimate targets outside Ukraine,” Stoltenberg said Monday at a NATO meeting in Sofia, Bulgaria.


The United States will host a NATO summit in Washington from July 9 to July 11.


Blinken said there will be “very strong deliverables” in terms of Ukraine’s further integration with the Atlantic alliance.


Thirty-two countries have either completed or will soon complete bilateral security agreements with Ukraine.

## Technical writing is not a dead-end job, it's a landing pad

date: 2024-05-29, from: Blog by Fabrizio Ferri-Benedetti

With the job market getting tougher by the day, there&rsquo;s a rising belief among tech writers that their role is &ldquo;too niche&rdquo; and a &ldquo;dead-end job&rdquo;. I think that&rsquo;s the wrong way of looking at our profession — at any profession. Let me cast aside that dark veil of pessimism and offer an alternative viewpoint, that of tech writing as a platform to other professions, one that lets you move laterally with just a bit of curiosity and courage.

## Microsoft’s ‘Auto Super Resolution’ DLSS competitor isn’t exclusive to Qualcomm

date: 2024-05-29, from: OS News

When you launch a game on a Snapdragon on a Windows laptop, you might get an AI frame rate boost from Microsoft’s mysterious Auto Super Resolution (Auto SR) feature. But while Microsoft hasn’t fully explained how the feature works, The Verge can now confirm it’s not Qualcomm technology, not exclusive to Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon X chips, and not exclusive to specific games, either. ↫ Sean Hollister at The Verge These resolution enhancer technologies from NVIDIA, AMD, and apparently Microsoft are another great use of what we today call &#8220;AI&#8221; technologies. Of course, I wish we didn&#8217;t have to deal with several proprietary offerings but instead enjoyed several open source versions and possibly a standard to work off of, but give it some time, and we may still get there. Like I&#8217;ve said before &#8211; there&#8217;s nothing inherently wrong with &#8220;AI&#8221; technologies, as long as they&#8217;re used in ways that make sense, run locally, and most importantly, aren&#8217;t based on the wholesale theft of artists&#8217; and programmers&#8217; works. Unsurprisingly, the tech bros at companies like OpenAI don&#8217;t really understand the concept of &#8220;consent&#8221;, and until they do, their offerings should be deemed illegal.

## Alito rejects calls to quit US Supreme Court cases on Trump and Jan. 6 because of flag controversies

date: 2024-05-29, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Justice Samuel Alito is rejecting calls to step aside from Supreme Court cases involving former President Donald Trump and Jan. 6 defendants because of the controversy over flags that flew over his homes.


In letters to members of Congress on Wednesday, Alito said his wife was responsible for flying an upside-down U.S. flag over his home in 2021 and an "Appeal to Heaven" flag at his New Jersey beach house last year.


Neither incident merits his recusal, he wrote.


"I am therefore duty-bound to reject your recusal request," he wrote.


The court is considering two major cases related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack by a mob of Trump supporters on the Capitol, including charges faced by the rioters and whether Trump has immunity from prosecution on election interference charges.


Alito has rejected calls from Democrats in the past to recuse on other issues.


The New York Times reported that an inverted American flag was seen at Alito's home in Alexandria, Virginia, less than two weeks after the attack on the Capitol. The paper also reported that an "Appeal to Heaven" flag was flown outside of the justice's beach home in New Jersey last summer. Both flags were carried by rioters who violently stormed the Capitol in January 2021 echoing Trump's false claims of election fraud.


Alito said he was unaware that the upside-down flag was flying above his house until it was called to his attention. "As soon as I saw it, I asked my wife to take it down, but for several days, she refused," he wrote in nearly identical letters to Democrats in the House and Senate.

The startup is a Bitcoin miner and data center operator. It’s a “high-performance” and “carbon-negative” cloud platform provider. It’s a darling of the clean tech world that’s raised nearly $750 million in funding. The company has historically powered its operations with natural gas, but its overall business model actually reduces emissions. Confused yet? </p><p>Here are the basics. The company was founded in 2018 to address the problem of natural gas flaring. Natural gas is a byproduct of oil extraction, and if oil field operators have no economical use case for the gas or are unable to transfer it elsewhere, it’s often simply burned. If you, like me, have spent time <a href="https://www.gettyimages.com/search/2/image?phrase=natural%20gas%20flaring&sort=mostpopular&license=rf%2Crm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>sourcing stock images</u></a> of air pollution, you’ve probably seen the pictures of giant flames coming out of tall smokestacks near oil pump jacks and other drilling infrastructure. That’s what flaring natural gas looks like, and it is indeed terrible for the environment. That’s largely because the process fails to fully combust methane, which is the primary component of natural gas and 84 times more potent than carbon dioxide over a 20-year period.</p><p>That’s where Crusoe comes in. The company’s co-founder, president, and chief operating officer, Cully Cavness was working in the oil and gas industry when he realized that stranded natural gas could be harnessed to power Bitcoin-mining data centers if they were sited directly next to the oil field infrastructure. Burning natural gas for electricity production fully combusts methane, producing CO2 as a byproduct. Still bad, you might say! But it’s definitely not as bad as methane leaking into the atmosphere via flaring, the status quo where Crusoe operates. </p><p>So regardless of what one might think of the utility of Bitcoin mining overall, “if you were to delete what we’re doing you would just have a big ball of fire and that would be worse,” Cavness told me.</p><p>Plus, it’s dirt cheap. “It is the lowest cost way to generate power that we’ve ever seen,” Cavness said, though he wouldn’t disclose exactly how much Crusoe pays the oil companies for their natural gas. “This is truly a waste product. I mean, there is no value being ascribed to it.”</p><p>According to Crusoe’s <a href="https://crusoe.ai/_astro/Crusoe_ESG_Report_2023.05.10.b68a7533.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>most recent ESG report</u></a>, for every ton of CO2 equivalent that the company produced in 2022, it reduced over 1.6 tons through avoided methane emissions. And the opportunity for growth is enormous. “There is a huge amount of flared gas around the world,” Cavness said. “If you captured it all, it would power like two thirds of all of Europe’s electricity and it would power the entire data center industry many times over.”</p><p>Of course, in an ideal world, flared gas wouldn’t even be an option. There have been some state level-efforts to ban “routine flaring” in Colorado, New Mexico, and Alaska, but <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/12032023/new-mexico-methane-gas-flaring/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>enforcement has often fallen short</u></a>. “Nothing about flaring should be routine,” Deborah Gordon, a methane expert at the think tank RMI, told me. “It should be an emergency piece of equipment. It’s there to handle a burst of gas that would otherwise present a safety problem to the people on the ground.”</p><p>But in the places where Crusoe operates, Cavness said flare gas is available 98% to 99% of the time. Today, the company has about 30 sites located throughout all the major oil fields in the U.S., plus one facility in Argentina.</p><p>Gordon views circumstances like this, where gas is being perpetually flared, as “opportunities to decommission” oil wells. But given sheer demand, that may not be an economically or politically feasible solution in the short term. Last year was a record-setting one for oil production, as the U.S. pumped more than any country had in history.</p><p>So given that oil isn’t going to disappear overnight, this particular fossil-fuel powered Bitcoin miner has been wildly successful with climate-focused investors. Two years ago, Crusoe closed its $350 million Series C round, led by clean tech investor G2 Venture Partners with participation by existing climate tech venture firms Lowercarbon Capital and MCJ Collective, among others. </p><p>“It’s not just the lowest hash rate for Bitcoin mining, or the cheapest cost of compute. It’s also the greenest and when those two things are true, you’ve got an amazing business on your hands,” Clay Dumas, a partner at Lowercarbon Capital, told me. He views shutting down oil fields that flare natural gas as simply “not tractable” given today’s energy environment.</p><p>But now Crusoe is shifting its focus on multiple fronts. Cavness told me the company never planned to build its long-term business solely around Bitcoin mining, though historically nearly all of its revenue has come from the famously volatile world of cryptocurrencies. His co-founder, Chase Lochmiller, has a masters in computer science with a focus on artificial intelligence and has long understood AI’s energy demands. </p><p>“And so since way before ChatGPT, we’d had a view that GPU computing was going to be actually the bigger opportunity and the bigger driver of data center power demand. And if we could align that with wasted energy sources and other curtailed energy sources, it could be a really effective approach to reduce costs and also reduce emissions,” Cavness told me. </p><p>Last year the company expanded its Crusoe Cloud service, which is essentially its version of Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure. It works like this: Crusoe builds the data centers (or co-locates with existing facilities), buys the GPU servers, and operates a software layer on top of it all. Then, companies looking to train AI models or synthesize large datasets pay to access Crusoe Cloud over the internet, remotely spinning up Crusoe’s GPU clusters to do the hard lifting.</p><p>Last month, Cavness said that the majority of the company’s revenue came from its AI data centers, outpacing Bitcoin revenue for the first time. If all goes according to plan, AI will comprise more than 75% of the company’s revenue by year’s end. “You couldn’t really have timed the launch of a cloud business focused on generative AI much better than they did,” Dumas told me.</p><p>Then, as the world (potentially and eventually) moves away from oil, Crusoe is also shifting its focus towards stranded renewable assets. That means sourcing power from areas where there’s excess wind, solar, hydropower, or geothermal on the grid, which leads to curtailment or negative pricing for these resources. “So that’s how we think about operating on the other side of the energy transition,” Cavness told me. This business model, he said, creates an incentive for renewable operators to build even more capacity, since they know they’ll have customers for their excess energy. </p><p>Of course, Crusoe isn’t the only company and data centers aren’t the only industry looking to access the cheap power that standed renewables can supply. Excess clean energy could be used to make green hydrogen, provide heating and cooling for buildings, operate direct air capture facilities, or power microgrids. If renewables are used to mine speculative cryptocurrencies, many would likely argue there are worthier opportunities. </p><p>But high compute data centers — whether they’re mining Bitcoin or training AI models — do have one major advantage. “You can talk about highest use from a CO2 avoidance standpoint. But generally, the market is going to treat highest use as the greatest willingness to pay,” Dumas told me. “At this particular moment, it’s hard for me to imagine any application that has a higher willingness to pay, and that is more deployable than data centers.” </p><p>Crusoe wouldn’t reveal what portion of its operations run on renewables vs. natural gas. The company’s current focus is expanding its Crusoe Cloud service in Iceland, partnering with an existing data center that’s powered by the country’s abundant hydropower and geothermal energy. Crusoe also says it’s working to develop domestic behind-the-meter wind and solar projects, which would be separate from the main grid and directly supply their data centers with power, though none have been formally announced yet. </p><p>Ultimately though, whether Crusoe uses renewables or flare gas, whether it mines Bitcoin or trains AI models, investors have decided that it’s undeniably better than business as usual. “You can complain all you want about the carbon emissions of Bitcoin and compute, but they’re not going anywhere except for up,” Dumas told me, saying it’s incumbent upon us to bring this new computational power to market as cleanly as possible. “And that’s really what Crusoe’s in a position to do.”</p>

## US optimistic a deal to lessen threats of future pandemics is in sight

date: 2024-05-29, from: VOA News USA

Geneva — Despite the failure of negotiators to reach a pandemic accord ahead of this week’s World Health Assembly, a senior U.S. official remains optimistic that an agreement to lessen the threats of global killer disease outbreaks is in sight.


“We think the elements of a good deal are already on the table and that is why we feel optimistic because those are pretty good deals. It is just a matter now of fine-tuning it to make sure everybody says we are ready to sign on the dotted line,” Xavier Becerra, U.S. secretary of health and human services, told journalists at a briefing in Geneva Wednesday.


While disappointing, Becerra indicated that it was not surprising that an accord was not reached after two-and-a-half years of negotiations.




“Negotiations go on forever,” he said. “I think we have to put this in perspective. You do not build a nation overnight. You do not build an Empire State Building overnight. It takes a long time. Name me a major international achievement that came overnight.


“I think there is clear consensus that we cannot let the status quo be upon us if another pandemic comes,” he said.


His view reflects that of World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who, in his opening remarks at the World Health Assembly on Monday, assured delegates that the negotiations were on track and were not a failure.


“Of course, we all wish that we had been able to reach a consensus on the agreement in time for this health assembly and cross the finish line,” he said. “But I remain confident that you still will—because where there is a will, there is a way.”




WHO says 7,010,681 people have died from the COVID-19 outbreak as of April 13 and that a total of 704,753,890 cases have been confirmed in 229 countries and territories.


Becerra noted that threats against global health have an outsized influence on broader global political and economic interests.


“There is no stability without health. There is no security without health. Our nations cannot be strong unless they are healthy.


“Getting out of COVID is our main health priority,” Becerra said, noting that U.S. President Joe Biden was committed to achieving a pandemic treaty.


“When the president came in, we were experiencing two or three 9/11s every day in America in terms of loss of life. That is where we started. Today, we are walking around without masks. We are treating COVID the way we treat the flu,” he said, indicating that now is not the time to become complacent.


“I think we realize that another pandemic could be upon us. I mean, we are dealing with avian flu in the U.S. right now. We do not know how long it is going to be before we get another type of COVID kind of tragedy. We do not want to wait,” he said.




Sticking points to a pandemic treaty include disagreements over sharing information about pathogens that cause pandemics, a formula for global sharing of vaccines and medicine during international health emergencies, and financing to set up surveillance systems.


The WHO says that member states have agreed to continue to work during the World Health Assembly “to develop the world’s first pandemic accord” to prevent a repeat of the “global health, economic and social impacts” of the COVID-19 pandemic.


“We really have an incredible opportunity this week,” Loyce Pace, assistant secretary for global affairs at HHS, said.


“We have spent so long trying to come together and finding compromise and consensus. I think we talk about what is left to do, but I do not know if we talk enough about what has been done toward reaching an agreement.”


“So, whatever happens this week, we need some deliverable, if only to keep this momentum on towards any other work that should continue. We shouldn’t be leaving Geneva and go home without an accord, not after all that has been done,” Pace said.


Secretary Becerra agrees, saying that he does not think there are substantive disagreements about the essential elements of a pandemic treaty.


“It is more how they are packaged, how they are defined. People generally agree with what we have to do in order to be ready to take on any pandemic that may come across our path,” Becerra said.


“I am the son of immigrants. Optimism is in my DNA and so, I believe we are going to get this done because it would be tragic, especially given how far we have come and not get it done.


“We have to be ready,” he said. “Who knows what is coming around the corner. Something is going to broadside us. We just have to be ready.”

## Bearblog is fun

date: 2024-05-29, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>If you’re into blogging and the blogging world, chances are you might have heard about <a href="https://bearblog.dev">bearblog.dev</a>. And if you’re a reader of this blog you might have also <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/pb-herman-martinus">read the interview with Herman</a>, Bearblog’s creator.</p>
<p>I never used Bearblog, mainly because I’m happy with my setup and I have no reason to look for another blog solution.</p>
<p>That said, a few weeks back I started toying with the idea of porting the design of this site over to Bear, just for fun. And to my surprise, creating a bear version of my site was surprisingly simple.</p>
<p>Which is why <a download href="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/bearblog-is-fun/8994e049c2-1717000249/bearblog_manu_theme.zip">I&rsquo;m happy to release a V0.1 of this experiment</a>. The demo site I’m using it’s currently up at <a href="https://css.bearblog.dev">css.bearblog.dev</a>. This is a very quick and dirty version. There's some leftover code in there but it should mostly work.</p>
<hr />
<p>Quick note: I might use that test site in the future to code other themes so depending on when you’re reading this post, the live preview might not actually show the correct theme.</p>
<hr />
<p>To install it just head over to the “Themes” section in your dashboard, delete everything inside the “Edit theme CSS” section and paste in the code of my theme. Hit “Publish” and you’re done.</p>
<p>I’m sure there will be bugs because there are always bugs. If you need help with anything <a href="mailto:hello@manuelmoreale.com">send me an email</a>. The theme is free, if you want to contribute the best way to do it is to <a href="https://ko-fi.com/manuelmoreale">become a member of my “One a Month” club.</a></p>                <hr>
                <p>Thank you for keeping RSS alive. You're awesome.</p>

## NASA Stennis Helps Family Build a Generational Legacy

## Brazil’s Displacement Fears

Biden administration invests in carbon removal</h3><p>The Department of Energy on Tuesday <a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/doe-purchase-prize-carbon-removal" target="_self">gave $1.2 million</a> to companies competing for a chance to sell carbon removal credits to the federal government. These 24 semifinalists, which were each awarded $50,000, include nine direct air capture projects, seven biomass projects, five enhanced rock weathering projects, and three marine-based projects. Up to 10 of them will be offered federal contracts amounting to $30 million. “The Department of Energy hopes that by selecting 24 companies that have been vetted by government scientists, it’s sending a signal to the private sector that there are at least some projects that are legitimate,” <a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/doe-purchase-prize-carbon-removal" rel="noopener" target="_self">Heatmap’s Emily Pontecorvo writes</a>, referencing struggles in the broader carbon credits marketplace.</p><h3>2. Brazil floods leave some permanently displaced</h3><p>Weeks of deadly flooding in Brazil displaced hundreds of thousands of people. Many of them now are — or will become — <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/05/28/brazil-floods-climate-refugees/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>climate refugees</u></a>. Residents of the cities devastated by the floodwaters are now rethinking how to live alongside the increasingly unpredictable rains. As climate refugees, they join the survivors of other climate disasters in recent years and the millions more who are expected to follow in their footsteps over the coming decades. “Brazil is not going to be a one-off,” Andrew Harper, a senior official at the U.N. High Commission for Refugees, told <em><em>The Washington Post</em></em>. “What we are seeing is the start of something that will become more frequent and more extreme and lead to more people left vulnerable, with no choice but to move to a safer location.”</p><h3>3. New satellite will study clouds and climate</h3><p>SpaceX launched the EarthCARE (Earth Cloud, Aerosol, and Radiation Explorer) satellite, a joint project between the European Space Agency and the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency, on Tuesday in a mission that will <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cyddezqrlmvo" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>study the impact</u></a> that clouds have on the climate. The satellite, which has been 20 years in the making, will use four instruments, including radar and imaging systems, to measure clouds’ altitude, structure, and movement. The mission will take place at a relatively low orbit and is expected to last at least three years. Researchers hope the data it collects will lead to improvements both in long-term climate modeling and short-term weather forecasting.</p><h3>4. Supreme Court to hear San Francisco’s case against the EPA</h3><p>The Supreme Court will <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/4689715-supreme-court-san-francisco-challenge-clean-water-act/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>hear a lawsuit</u></a> brought by the city and county of San Francisco against EPA Clean Water Act discharge regulations. Lawyers representing San Francisco argued in their petition that the federal regulations — which prohibit violations “of any applicable water quality standard” rather than setting numerical pollution limits — are too vague. “These prohibitions effectively tell permit holders nothing more than not to cause ‘too much’ pollution,” the <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/23/23-753/290765/20240108152337022_2024-01-08%20SF%20Petition%20for%20Writ%20of%20Certiorari.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>petition said</u></a>. The EPA argued in response that the requirements are meant to keep permits in line with regional and state discharge standards. “Those standards, in turn, establish specific limits to which petitioner’s discharges must conform,” the EPA’s brief said. In recent years, the conservative Supreme Court has ruled against the EPA in high-profile cases. </p><h3>5. Poll: Voters favor climate accountability</h3><p>Almost two-thirds of U.S. voters want oil companies to ”be held legally accountable for their contributions to climate change,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/28/poll-climate-change-lawsuit-oil-industry" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>The Guardian</em></em></u><u> reported</u></a> Tuesday. A poll conducted by consumer advocacy nonprofit Public Citizen and progressive polling firm Data for Progress found that 62% of voters — including 84% of Democrats, 59% of independents and 40% of Republicans — supported the idea. Asked about their stance on “criminal charges being filed against oil and gas companies to hold them accountable for deaths caused by their contributions to climate change,” 49% expressed support and 38% said they were opposed. A growing number of states, counties, and cities are suing major oil companies for climate damages. “These national findings show these cases may be able to earn popular support, particularly in blue jurisdictions,” Grace Adcox, senior climate strategist at Data for Progress, told <em><em>The Guardian</em></em>.</p><h3>THE KICKER</h3><p>A five-bedroom house in Rodanthe, North Carolina, has become the sixth house along its stretch of seashore to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/05/28/rodanthe-home-collapse/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>fall into the ocean</u></a> in the past four years as coastal erosion increasingly threatens homes built near the water.</p>

date: 2024-05-29, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>Despite cooling inflation, many Americans still say higher prices make it difficult to make ends meet. That&#8217;s especially the case for parents. The cost of child care has far outpaced overall inflation for the past few decades, to the point that it&#8217;s affecting the labor force. We discuss. But first: Tensions between Exxon-Mobil and some of its shareholders may well boil over this morning when the company holds its annual shareholder meeting.</p>

## Turbo9: a pipelined 6809 microprocessor IP

date: 2024-05-29, from: OS News

The Turbo9 is a pipelined microprocessor IP written in Verilog that executes a superset of the Motorola 6809 instruction set. It is a new modern microarchitecture with 16-bit internal datapaths that balances high performance vs small area / low power. The Turbo9R with a 16-bit memory interface achieves 0.69 DMIPS/MHz which is 3.8 times faster than Motorola&#8217;s original 8-bit MC6809 implementation. It is an active graduate research project at the Department of Electrical &#38; Computer Engineering at the University of Florida. ↫ Turbo9 GitHub page The Turbo9 is aimed at SoC sub-blocks and small mixed-signal ASIC, so it&#8217;s definitely not intended to be some sort of general purpose CPU. The reason for opting for the 6809 instead of, say, RISC-V or ARM, is that the 6809 enables a far smaller footprint due to being 16bit, which is all the target market really needs from the Turbo9. The current version of the Turbo9 is thoroughly verified and is capable of running C code. However, we still consider this version v0.9 because we are missing a few items. All the 6809 instructions and addressing modes have been implemented and tested except SYNC and CWAI. The signed versions of the Turbo9&#8217;s 16-bit divide and multiply need to be completed. Interrupts are partially implemented including SWI and Reset. ↫ Turbo9 GitHub page This is the kind of riveting content you&#8217;ll only really find on OSNews.

With five months until the November election and no diplomatic solution in sight for wars in Ukraine and Gaza, President Joe Biden, who in 2020 ran on a campaign to end "forever wars," is shifting voters’ attention away from American entanglements abroad by focusing on domestic priorities. White House Bureau Chief Patsy Widakuswara has the story.

## Can we at least agree that killing is wrong?

date: 2024-05-29, from: Ben Werdmuller's blog


<div class="e-content aside-content">
<p>I don’t think it’s possible to morally support the ongoing bombardment of Gaza, but that’s too weak a statement. What’s happening there seems to be — based on what I’ve read through the news, what I’ve seen in video, the stories that have been sent back to us — an atrocity. The latest story, from Rafah, is of an airstrike on a civilian evacuation zone where displaced families <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/israeli-tanks-enter-central-rafah-palestinians-tent-camp-blaze-rcna154235">were sheltering in tents</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Images showed the area engulfed in flames as screaming Palestinians fled for safety, with some video shared on social media showing disturbing images, including severely burned corpses and a man holding what appeared to be the headless body of a small child.</p></blockquote><p>There’s nothing flippant to say about this. This isn’t sports, where you root for a team. It’s not a theoretical debate: certainly not for the families who have no way to escape, kettled as they are into a small strip of land under constant military bombardment.</p><p>The bombardment on Gaza is disproportionate and indefensible. <a href="https://www.unicefusa.org/stories/more-13000-children-reported-dead-gaza-famine-nears">Thirteen thousand children alone</a> have been killed. A quarter of surviving children have acute malnutrition. There’s nowhere for them to go, and nowhere for them to get the care they need. In the face of these conditions, there must be a ceasefire. <em>Obviously</em> there must be a ceasefire.</p><p>Making statements like this is fraught. It sometimes seems like we’re being asked to fall into weird ideological lines that have little to do with the humanity of the people involved. Following the events of October 7, I unfollowed multiple progressive Instagram accounts that not only described the attack and kidnappings as the necessary work of de-colonization, but applauded the action. It’s clear to me that Palestine has been annexed, its land <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_settlement">illegally settled</a>, and its people made to suffer at the hands of increasingly-conservative Israeli policy. Protest and resistance are inevitable and justifiable. Regardless, I can’t support the killing and kidnapping of civilians, let alone accept <em>cheerleading</em> for it. Not ever.</p><p>By the same token, I see some people online call for an end to the state of Israel. What would that entail, exactly? Assuming it was a desirable goal, how might one go about achieving that? Dismantling it would involve unthinkable bloodshed.</p><p>Some people talk about how Hamas is the local government, and how the people there voted for them, so they deserve what’s happening to them. That it’s okay to bomb hospitals <a href="https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2024/01/middleeast/gaza-hospitals-destruction-investigation-intl-cmd/">because Hamas is hiding out in them</a> — regardless of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_shield">international law related to protecting the lives of human shields</a>.</p><p>The history, today’s political issues, and the road to a solution are far more complicated than can be conveyed by memes and soundbites. I have no solutions to the problems in this region or how to get to a lasting peace.</p><p>But some things are not complicated at all.</p><p>Don’t kill. Don’t subjugate. Don’t dehumanize. Don’t reduce lives, in all their complexity and beauty, to points and sides.</p><p>The core of this issue right now is — or should be — concern for human life. Everyone, regardless of nationality or political affiliation, should be appalled when children burn to death or are decapitated (whether they’re in an evacuation zone or not). The ruining of cities should never yield applause.</p><p>The protests on university campuses are the latest in a long line of campus anti-war protests, and I’m strongly in favor of them. Except, because of course this is true, there are people there who conflate the protest over policy with protests of anyone who is Israeli, or even anyone who is a Jew. I’ve personally heard stories of at least one person being spat on, not because of any rhetoric they were espousing, but simply because of who they were.</p><p>This all has the potential to escalate. I worry that it will. This is all already so horrific.</p><p>These are human beings. The Palestinian people are human beings. The Israeli people are human beings. Arabs are human beings. Jews are human beings. They are not their leaders; they are not their circumstances. They all - like all people - deserve to live, and live well. The death of any human being is never something to celebrate or to praise as a strategy. It’s all just endless tragedy.</p><p>Stop the killing. Find another way.</p></div>
