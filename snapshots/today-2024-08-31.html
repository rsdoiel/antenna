calls on Trump to debate with mics ‘on the whole time’</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee in
the November 5 U.S. presidential election, on Saturday called on her
Republican rival, Donald Trump, to debate her with their microphones
switched on throughout the event.</p>
<p>Harris and the former president have agreed to a debate, hosted by
ABC News, on September 10.</p>
<p>“Donald Trump is surrendering to his advisors who won’t allow him to
debate with a live microphone. If his own team doesn’t have confidence
in him, the American people definitely can’t,” Harris said in a post on
social media platform X.</p>
<p>“We are running for President of the United States. Let’s debate in a
transparent way with the microphones on the whole time.”</p>
<p>Trump has said that he preferred to have his microphone kept on and
that he did not like it muted during the last debate against
then-contender President Joe Biden.</p>
<p>So-called “hot mics” can help or hurt political candidates, catching
off-hand comments that sometimes were not meant for the public. Muted
microphones also prevent the debaters from interrupting their
opponent.</p>
<p>A representative for ABC did not immediately respond to a request for
comment.</p>
<p>The debate would be the first time Harris and Trump face off since
Biden dropped out of the presidential race following a poor performance
at a CNN debate in June that raised doubts about his mental acuity.</p>
<p>Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz and Republican vice
presidential nominee JD Vance have agreed to an October 1 debate on CBS
News.</p>

id="high-rents-are-forcing-small-businesses-in-into-tough-choices">High
rents are forcing small businesses in into tough choices</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — While many costs have come down for small businesses,
rents remain high and in some cases are still rising, forcing many
owners into some uncomfortable decisions.</p>
<p>“Every time the rent goes up, we have to raise prices, to keep up
with the cost,” said Adelita Valentine, owner of HairFreek Barbers in
Los Angeles. “But with the cost of living, it makes it difficult on our
customers.”</p>
<p>Other owners are choosing to be late on payments or seeking out new
locations where the rent is lower. A few are pushing back against their
landlord.</p>
<p>Although inflation is easing, it remains a top concern for small
businesses. According to Bank of America internal data, rent payments
per small business client rose 11% year-over-year in July. That’s more
than twice the increase for renting and owning a residence, a metric
known as shelter, according to the government’s monthly Consumer Price
Index. That figure rose 5.1% in July.</p>
<p>And although the situation has improved since the height of the
pandemic, a survey by business networking platform Alignable of more
than 6,000 small business owners found that 41% could not pay their July
rent on time and in full. And 52% said they’ve encountered rent spikes
in the past six months.</p>
<p>The rent for Valentine’s barbershop rose to $4,000 in January from
$3,600 in December, the fifth increase in the past eight years. She had
to raise the price for her cuts from $35 to $40.</p>
<p>Two months ago, she moved locations for a cheaper $3,200 rent, but
her space is smaller now and she sees fewer families coming in.</p>
<p>“A lot of people can’t afford to take a whole family to get
haircuts,” after the price increase, she said.</p>
<p>Peter Yu has owned iPAC Automotive, an auto repair and detailing shop
in Ontario, Canada, for six years. He said the rent on the shop
typically went up about 4% a year. But when his landlord sold the
property to a new owner, Yu’s rent jumped from about $1,800 (2,500
Canadian dollars) to about $2,700 (3,700 Canadian dollars) after three
months.</p>
<p>He contemplated moving but decided that the cost of a move would be
more than just paying the extra rent.</p>
<p>Yu tried to raise prices a month ago, but customers would come in and
say “Oh, its too expensive,” and leave, he said. So, he had to drop the
price increase in order to get those customers back.</p>
<p>“When we do try to raise our prices, consumers don’t have the money
to pay for it. They’re looking for financing options,” he said. Yu’s
services run the gamut from paint correction that costs a few hundred
dollars to troubleshooting problematic EV battery and electric drive
units for out-of-warranty Teslas that can cost up to $15,000.</p>
<p>So instead, he’s going to try to improve his marketing, close more
sales, and find a way to offer more financing.</p>
<p>Standing firm against a landlord sometimes works. Janna Rodriguez has
run her home-based The Innovative Daycare Corp. in Freeport, New York,
since 2018. When she first signed her lease, she paid $3,500, plus costs
including landscaping and maintenance. In 2020, the pandemic began, and
her landlord raised her rent to $3,800 and also made her start paying
half of the homeowner’s insurance. Last year, the landlord raised her
rent to $4,100, plus the additional expenses.</p>
<p>Rodriguez raised her prices for the first time, by $10 per child per
week, to help offset the rising rent.</p>
<p>This year she successfully pushed back when the landlord wanted to
raise the rent yet again.</p>
<p>“I said to them, if you do that, then I’m going to find another
property to move my business to, because at this point now you’re trying
to bankrupt a business, right?” </p>
<p>It’s worked – so far. But Rodriguez is worried about the future.</p>
<p>For others, negotiating a late payment is an option. Nicole Pomije
owner of Minneapolis-based The Cookie Cups, which makes cookie kits for
kids, has a 372-square-meter office space along with a warehouse where
she develops her line of baking kits. Her rent rose 10% this year to
$4,000 monthly. Then there are unanticipated bills, such as $1,500 for
snow plowing.</p>
<p>“There’s so much stuff that pops up that you just you never expect,”
she said. “And it’s always when you never expect it.”</p>
<p>Pomije hasn’t raised prices, but instead tried to mitigate the higher
rent costs by buying materials in bulk – like ordering 5,000 boxes
instead of 1,000 boxes for a 40% discount – and finding cost savings
elsewhere.</p>
<p>Still, there have been several months over the past couple of years
where she couldn’t pay rent on time. So, far the landlord has been
amenable.</p>
<p>“If we have a conversation like hey, we don’t know if we’re going to
make it for the first this month. It might be closer to the tenth,” she
said.</p>
<p>Asked if she thinks costs might ease in the future, Pomije said she
is focused on the present.</p>
<p>“It’s weird, but I’m trying not to think about the future too much
and I’m trying to just do what we have to do, and get ready for a
holiday season and just, like, get everything paid on time now,” she
said. “And then we’ll kind of reevaluate everything in January.”</p>

id="heres-what-harris-and-trump-have-said-about-easing-costs-for-families">Here’s
what Harris and Trump have said about easing costs for families</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The high cost of caring for children and the elderly has
forced women out of the workforce, devastated family finances, and left
professional caretakers in low-wage jobs — all while slowing economic
growth. </p>
<p>That families are suffering is not up for debate. As the economy
emerges as a theme in this presidential election, the Democratic and
Republican candidates have sketched out ideas for easing costs that
reveal their divergent views about family. </p>
<p>On this topic, the two tickets have one main commonality: Both of the
presidential candidates — and their running mates — have, at one point
or another, backed an expanded child tax credit. </p>
<p>Vice President Kamala Harris, who accepted the Democratic Party’s
nomination last week, has signaled that she plans to build on the
ambitions of outgoing President Joe Biden’s administration, which sought
to pour billions in taxpayer dollars into making child care and home
care for elderly and disabled adults more affordable. She has not etched
any of those plans into a formal policy platform. But in a speech
earlier this month, she said her vision included raising the child tax
credit. </p>
<p>Former President Donald Trump, the Republican, has declined to answer
questions about how he would make child care more affordable, even
though it was an issue he tackled during his own administration. His
running mate, Senator JD Vance of Ohio, has a long history of pushing
policies that would encourage Americans to have families, floating ideas
like giving parents votes for their children. Just this month, Vance
said he wants to raise the child tax credit to $5,000. But Vance has
opposed government spending on child care, arguing that many children
benefit from having one parent at home as caretaker. </p>
<p>The candidates’ care agendas could figure prominently into their
appeal to suburban women in swing states, a coveted demographic seen as
key to victory in November. Women provide two-thirds of unpaid care work
— valued at $1 trillion annually — and are disproportionately impacted
when families can’t find affordable care for their children or aging
parents. And the cost of care is an urgent problem: Child care prices
are rising faster than inflation. </p>
<p>Kamala Harris: Increase child tax credit </p>
<p>When Harris addressed the Democratic National Convention, she talked
first about her own experience with child care. She was raised mostly by
a single mother, Shyamala Gopalan, who worked long hours as a breast
cancer researcher. Among the people who formed her family’s support
network was “Mrs. Shelton, who ran the day care below us and became a
second mother.” </p>
<p>As vice president, Harris worked behind the scenes in Congress on
Biden’s proposals to establish national paid family leave, make
prekindergarten universal, and invest billions in child care so families
wouldn’t pay more than 7% of their income. She announced, too, the
administration’s actions to lower copays for families using federal
child care vouchers, and to raise wages for Medicaid-funded home health
aides. Before that, her track record as a senator included pressing for
greater labor rights for domestic workers, including nannies and home
health aides who may be vulnerable to exploitation. </p>
<p>This month at a community college in North Carolina, Harris outlined
her campaign’s economic agenda, which includes raising the child tax
credit to as much as $3,600 and giving families of newborns even more —
$6,000 for the child’s first year. </p>
<p>“That is a vital — vital year of critical development of a child, and
the costs can really add up, especially for young parents who need to
buy diapers and clothes and a car seat and so much else,” she told the
audience. Her running mate selection of Tim Walz, who established paid
leave and a child tax credit as governor of Minnesota, has also buoyed
optimism among supporters. </p>
<p>Donald Trump: Few specifics, but some past support </p>
<p>For voters grappling with the high cost of child care, Trump has
offered little in the way of solutions. During the June presidential
debate, CNN moderator Jake Tapper twice asked Trump what he would do to
lower child care costs. Both times, he failed to answer, instead
pivoting to other topics. His campaign platform is similarly silent. It
does tackle the cost of long-term care for the elderly, writing that
Republicans would “support unpaid Family Caregivers through Tax Credits
and reduced red tape.” </p>
<p>The silence marks a shift from his first campaign, when he pitched
paid parental leave, though it was panned by critics because his
proposal excluded fathers. When he reached the White House, the former
president sought $1 billion for child care, plus a parental leave policy
at the urging of his daughter and policy adviser, Ivanka Trump. Congress
rejected both proposals, but Trump succeeded in doubling the child tax
credit and establishing paid leave for federal employees. </p>
<p>In his 2019 State of the Union address, Trump said he was “proud to
be the first president to include in my budget a plan for nationwide
paid family leave, so that every new parent has the chance to bond with
their newborn child.” </p>
<p>This year, there are signs that his administration might not pursue
the same agenda, including his selection of Vance as a running mate. In
2021, before he joined the Senate, Vance co-authored an op-ed for The
Wall Street Journal opposing a proposal to invest billions in child care
to make it more affordable for families. He and his co-author said
expanding child care subsidies would lead to “unhappier, unhealthier
children” and that having fewer mothers contributing to the economy
might be a worthwhile trade-off. </p>
<p>Vance has floated policies that would make it easier for a family to
live off of a single income, making it possible for some parents to stay
home while their partners work. Along with his embrace of policies he
calls pro-family, he has tagged people who do not have or want children
as “sociopaths.” He once derided Harris and other rising Democratic
stars as “childless cat ladies,” even though Harris has two stepchildren
— they call her “Momala” — and no cats. </p>
<p>Even without details about new care policies, Trump believes that
families would ultimately get a better deal under his
administration. </p>
<p>The Trump-Vance campaign has attacked Harris’ record on the economy
and said the Biden administration’s policies have only made things
tougher for families, pointing to recent inflation. </p>
<p>“Harris … has proudly and repeatedly celebrated her role as Joe
Biden’s co-pilot on Bidenomics,” said Karoline Leavitt, a campaign
spokeswoman. “The basic necessities of food, gas and housing are less
affordable, unemployment is rising, and Kamala doesn’t seem to
care.”</p>

id="x-platform-suspended-in-brazil-amid-brazilian-judges-feud-with-musk">X
platform suspended in Brazil amid Brazilian judge’s feud with Musk</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SAO PAULO — A Brazilian Supreme Court justice on Friday ordered the
suspension of Elon Musk’s social media giant X in Brazil after the tech
billionaire refused to name a legal representative in the country,
according to a copy of the decision seen by The Associated Press.</p>
<p>The move further escalates the monthslong feud between the two men
over free speech, far-right accounts and misinformation. </p>
<p>Justice Alexandre de Moraes had warned Musk on Wednesday night that X
could be blocked in Brazil if he failed to comply with his order to name
a representative. He set a 24-hour deadline. The company hasn’t had a
representative in the country since earlier this month. </p>
<p>In his decision, de Moraes gave internet service providers and app
stores five days to block access to X, and said the platform will remain
blocked until it complies with his orders. He also said people or
companies who use virtual private networks, or VPNs, to access X will be
subject to daily fines of 50,000 reais ($8,900). </p>
<p>“Elon Musk showed his total disrespect for Brazilian sovereignty and,
in particular, for the judiciary, setting himself up as a true
supranational entity and immune to the laws of each country,” de Moraes
wrote. </p>
<p>Brazil is an important market for X, which has struggled with the
loss of advertisers since Musk purchased the platform, formerly Twitter,
in 2022. Market research group Emarketer says about 40 million
Brazilians, roughly one-fifth of the population, access X at least once
per month. </p>
<p>X had posted on its official Global Government Affairs page late
Thursday that it expected X to be shut down by de Moraes, “simply
because we would not comply with his illegal orders to censor his
political opponents.” </p>
<p>“When we attempted to defend ourselves in court, Judge de Moraes
threatened our Brazilian legal representative with imprisonment. Even
after she resigned, he froze all of her bank accounts,” the company
wrote. “Our challenges against his manifestly illegal actions were
either dismissed or ignored. Judge de Moraes’ colleagues on the Supreme
Court are either unwilling or unable to stand up to him.”</p>
<p>Musk characterizes judge as tyrant </p>
<p>X has clashed with de Moraes over its reluctance to comply with
orders to block users. </p>
<p>Accounts that the platform previously has shut down on Brazilian
orders include lawmakers affiliated with former President Jair
Bolsonaro’s right-wing party and activists accused of undermining
Brazilian democracy. </p>
<p>Musk, a self-proclaimed “free speech absolutist,” has repeatedly
claimed the justice’s actions amount to censorship, and his argument has
been echoed by Brazil’s political right. He has often insulted de Moraes
on his platform, characterizing him as a dictator and tyrant. </p>
<p>De Moraes’ defenders have said his actions aimed at X have been
lawful, supported by most of the court’s full bench and have served to
protect democracy at a time in which it is imperiled. His order Friday
is based on Brazilian law requiring foreign companies to have
representation in the country so they can be notified when there are
legal cases against them. </p>
<p>Given that operators are aware of the widely publicized standoff and
their obligation to comply with an order from de Moraes, plus the fact
doing so isn’t complicated, X could be offline as early as 12 hours
after receiving their instructions, said Luca Belli, coordinator of the
Technology and Society Center at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a
university in Rio de Janeiro. </p>
<p>Other apps suspended in past</p>
<p>The shutdown is not unprecedented in Brazil. </p>
<p>Lone Brazilian judges shut down Meta’s WhatsApp, the nation’s most
widely used messaging app, several times in 2015 and 2016 when the
company’s refused to comply with police requests for user data. In 2022,
de Moraes threatened the messaging app Telegram with a nationwide
shutdown, arguing it had repeatedly ignored Brazilian authorities’
requests to block profiles and provide information. He ordered Telegram
to appoint a local representative; the company ultimately complied and
stayed online. </p>
<p>X and its former incarnation, Twitter, have been banned in several
countries — mostly authoritarian regimes such as Russia, China, Iran,
Myanmar, North Korea, Venezuela and Turkmenistan. Other countries, such
as Pakistan, Turkey and Egypt, have also temporarily suspended X before,
usually to quell dissent and unrest. Twitter was banned in Egypt after
the Arab Spring uprisings, which some dubbed the “Twitter revolution,”
but it has since been restored.</p>

id="microsoft-quietly-makes-controversial-recall-feature-uninstallable">Microsoft
quietly makes controversial Recall feature uninstallable</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-30, from: OS News</p>
<p>After spending a few months in complete radio silence about Recall,
Microsoft finally emerged with a statement that its controversial
feature will make a comeback later this year, in October, to be more
precise. In preparation for the release, Microsoft quietly made a big
change in Windows 11 version 24H2 on Copilot+ PCs, namely, adding the
ability to uninstall Recall (via Deskmodder). ↫ Taras Buria Recall, a
half-baked security nightmare of a feature trying to catch the AI hype
train, uninstallable using a Windows 95-era Windows Features dialog, is
a better summary of the current state of Windows than anything anyone
could put into words. Nobody cares about Windows, least of all
Microsoft, and I have the sneaking suspicion that could Microsoft get
away with it, they would put the source code to large parts of the
Windows platform on GitHub to “outsource” its development to the
community and fire even more employees. Is anyone excited about new
Windows releases? Is anyone looking forward to new features? Because it
feels like every new releases, every new feature, just causes more
dread, more exasperation, more what is it this time? than genuine
excitement and happiness. Everything coming out of Microsoft when it
comes to Windows ever since the release of Windows 11 is just…
Sadness.</p>

releases copy of internal lecture delivered by computing giant Rear Adm.
Grace Hopper</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-30, from: OS News</p>
<p>In one of the more unique public proactive transparency record
releases for the National Security Agency (NSA) to date, NSA has
released a digital copy of a lecture that then-Capt. Grace Hopper gave
agency employees on August 19, 1982. The lecture, “Future Possibilities:
Data, Hardware, Software, and People,” features Capt. Hopper discussing
some of the potential future challenges of protecting information. She
also provided valuable insight on leadership and her experiences
breaking barriers in the fields of computer science and mathematics. ↫
NSA press release Digital preservation is about more than just code –
it’s also about invaluable content like this. It seems rather uncouth to
spend only a few lines on who Grace Hopper really is, since it’s your
duty to know already, and she deserves a hell of a lot more than a few
lines. If you don’t yet know who she is, her Wikipedia page is a good
place to start. The speech in question has an interesting history, in
that the only medium on which it was stored were 1-inch AMPEX tapes. The
speech was originally given to NSA employees, but not even the damn NSA
had the ability to access the recordings of the speech, and had to call
in the National Archives and Records Administration’s help. The NARA
managed to retrieve the footage from the tapes, and now here we are.
This will make for some great weekend viewing.</p>

<h2 id="end-of-the-road-an-anandtech-farewell">End of the road: an
AnandTech farewell</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-30, from: OS News</p>
<p>I hate this timeline. It is with great sadness that I find myself
penning the hardest news post I’ve ever needed to write here at
AnandTech. After over 27 years of covering the wide – and wild – word of
computing hardware, today is AnandTech’s final day of publication. For
better or worse, we’ve reached the end of a long journey – one that
started with a review of an AMD processor, and has ended with the review
of an AMD processor. It’s fittingly poetic, but it is also a testament
to the fact that we’ve spent the last 27 years doing what we love,
covering the chips that are the lifeblood of the computing industry. ↫
Ryan Smith at AnandTech This sudden loss is sending shockwaves through
the industry, and rightfully so. AnandTech is a pillar, a cornerstone of
hardware reporting, and one of the very few – possibly only – tech news
outlet out there with such depth, quality, integrity, and restraint. I
can’t think of any other outlet being as dedicated to proper
benchmarking and hardware reviews as AnandTech was, and losing them is a
huge loss for all of us. The cause is exactly what you’d expect, sadly.
It’s simply not really possible to remain profitable writing in-depth
hardware reviews and benchmarks, as the world has shifted to video, and
advertising income has cratered. There’s tons of hints about AnandTech
not wanting to embrace sensationalism and clickbaiting to increase
revenue – they’d rather go out with class, and I admire and appreciate
that greatly. It just goes to show how hard it is to keep your head
above water in the current online publishing world without rampant
clickbaiting and flashy videos. In a better, less monopolised world,
AnandTech could thrive. Sadly, that’s not the timeline we’re in. As far
as housekeeping goes, the site will remain up for now, but there’s no
guarantee it’ll stay up forever. I’m sure countless people are already
archiving the invaluable content AnandTech has produced over its 27 year
run, including the forums. We shan’t lose what AnandTech has
created.</p>

Western Solar Plan.</a> The idea is to “drive responsible solar
development to locations with fewer potential conflicts while helping
the nation transition to a clean energy economy,” BLM Director Tracy
Stone-Manning said in a statement.
</p>
<p>
To speed up the approval process of solar projects, the Western Solar
Plan identifies 31 million acres of public lands across 11 western
states as available for potential development, singling out regions that
would bring solar “closer to transmission lines or to previously
disturbed lands” and avoid “protected lands, sensitive cultural
resources, and important wildlife habitat,” according to the BLM.
Individual projects would still need to be authorized through
site-specific environmental reviews and public comment periods.

Just over half of Americans (52%) would support a bipartisan law that

and gas development, a new poll by Heatmap has found. “That’s good news
for one of the last remaining pieces of environmental policy that

largely in favor, including 58% of GOP voters, who were a little more
amenable to the compromise than Democrats. “This all suggests that the
permitting reform deal could remain largely depoliticized as Congress
continues to debate it through the fall,” adds Meyer. “If you were to
summarize respondents’ reactions to the survey, it might look like,
‘Sure, whatever, sounds good.’”

Convective Capital in the beginning of 2022, he said, “we’ve identified
about 500 of what we call fire tech companies.” They run the gamut from
startups that work on wildfire suppression to those dealing with
identification, prevention, mitigation, and insurance against damages.
</p>
<p>
Rhizome, a company making an AI-powered wildfire risk mitigation
platform for utilities, is one of the firm’s most recent investments.
“Think of it as Sim City for the grid,” Mishal Thadani, CEO of the
Washington, D.C.-based startup, told me. “You obviously need to know, as
extreme weather events hit, how this is going to affect your assets,” he
explained.
</p>
<p>
Rhizome’s platform gives utilities insight into, “if there is an asset
failure, given the asset type, the type of failure, and the burn
probability given the vegetation makeup and the dryness conditions,
what’s going to be the likelihood of a wildfire ignition?” This
information helps utilities decide where to put their money, whether
that means replacing a power line or pole, insulating conductors,
undergrounding power lines, or trimming back a bush. Last month, Rhizome
announced a $1 million investment from Convective Capital, not tied to a
particular funding round. The company raised
<a href="https://www.rhizomedata.com/news/rhizome-grid-resilience-launch" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$2.5
million</u></a> in its pre-seed round last year.
</p>
<p>
The problem is not simply a lack of data, Thadani told me — utilities
often know things about their assets such as last inspection date and
outage history, and have systems that can render the surrounding
landscape and other infrastructural features. The problem is that data
is not part of a holistic system that can provide comprehensive
insights. If risk analysis is being performed, Thadani said, “it’s being
done on a super scrappy spreadsheet basis.”
</p>
<p>
Rhizome aims to build the “connective tissue” between a utility’s
disparate data systems, then combine that with other geographic datasets
on climate, weather, and vegetation. From there, the company uses its
machine learning models to assess the likelihood of extreme weather
events and their subsequent impacts. Ultimately, this allows utilities
to provide regulators with more quantifiable information on their plans
to improve grid resiliency and prevent wildfires, beyond just citing a
figure for how much money they want to spend.
</p>
<p>
Utilities are not exactly known for their technical prowess, but are
hungry nevertheless for solutions to their wildfire woes. Pacific Gas
&amp; Electric, the nation’s largest utility, was driven into bankruptcy
after being found liable for a spate of enormous California wildfires in
2017 and 2018. After reemerging from bankruptcy in 2020, it now has a
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-27/pg-e-pledges-18-billion-to-cut-wildfire-risk-in-california" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>plan
to spend $18 billion</u></a> on wildfire mitigation through 2025. Other
utilities such as
<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/hawaiian-electric-nears-wildfire-settlement-aiming-to-avoid-pg-es-bankruptcy-fate-513a3846" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Hawaii
Electric</u></a> and
<a href="https://newsletter.rationalwalk.com/p/berkshire-hathaway-energys-uncertain" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Berkshire
Hathaway Energy</u></a> face billions in potential liabilities for
wildfires in their service areas.
</p>
<p>
The most common customers for companies in Convective Capital’s
portfolio are utilities, governments, and insurance companies. “These
are tremendously deep-pocketed institutions, but they are not, you know,
necessarily the most fast-moving or innovative,” he told me. “And so
that is the fundamental challenge of building a wildfire technology
company.”
</p>
<p>
So far, Rhizome has announced partnerships with two utilities, Seattle
City Light and Vermont Electric Power Company. But Clerico acknowledges
that getting traditional institutions onboard is no easy task, even when
the benefits seem clear. The magnitude of the destruction in recent
years <em><em>has</em></em> served as an accelerant, though — something
the vegetation management platform provider AiDash has seen first hand.
Abhishek Singh, cofounder and CEO of the startup (which is not in
Convective’s portfolio), said that when he founded the company in 2019,
“Every investor warned us not to do this because utilities don’t buy and
they won’t invest.” But that’s not what he’s experienced.
</p>
<p>
AiDash
<a href="https://www.aidash.com/news/aidash-closes-its-oversubscribed-series-c-funding-round-at-58-5-million/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>raised
$58.5 million</u></a> in an oversubscribed Series C round earlier this
year, led by the impact investor Lightrock, and has five utility
partnerships, including Southern California Edison’s holding company,
Edison International, as well as Duke Energy. The company uses satellite
data and AI analytics to assess vegetation near utility infrastructure
for wildfire risk. It can also detect faults by fusing satellite data
with other sources such as thermal or LiDAR-based imagery. (Convective
Capital sees the value proposition in using satellites for vegetation
management, too — it’s invested in one of AiDash’s direct competitors,
an Amsterdam-based startup called Overstory.)
</p>
<p>
When Singh founded AiDash in 2019, both the size and cost of satellites
were plummeting, leading to far more launches and thus far more data. .
“Since the history of the first satellite until 2018, there were
2,200-odd satellites launched,” he told me. “From 2019 onwards, each
year close to 1,000 satellites are getting launched.” The company
purchases mounds of that data to conduct its vegetation analyses.
</p>
<p>
Vegetation management is typically the largest line item in a utility’s
operations and maintenance budgets, Singh told me, costing the entire
sector around $6 billion or $7 billion annually. “It’s also the single
largest cause of utility-caused wildfires, as well as the cause of most
outages,” he said, as power lines coming into contact with trees,
grasses, and shrubs can easily spark a fire. Anything that can help them
trim that budget and preempt the need for costly equipment repairs is
worth a lot. “These are all million dollar contracts,” Singh told me.
</p>
<p>
But big data platforms alone are just one tool in the vast toolbox that
comprises a holistic approach to wildfire management. “There’s no
panacea, where you just do one thing and then it solves the problem,”
Clerico told me. “It’s going to get solved as a combination of
consistent and repeated forest management, building towns and cities
that are fire adapted, building great infrastructure, and then having
the ability to detect and respond quickly. All of these things are huge,
multi decade, multi billion dollar investments.”
</p>
<p>
So for the foreseeable future, Convective Capital will have its work cut
out for it. But when I asked Clerico if one day, in a beautiful, far-off
dreamland, there might not be the need for a dedicated wildfire tech VC,
he said he hopes so.

and reduce the flow of mostly U.S.-bound migration.</p>
<p>The flight carrying 30 Ecuadoreans departed on Thursday evening en

said, adding the migrants were deported for evading a migration
checkpoint on the popular Darien Gap route.</p>
<p>Thousands of people every year cross the dangerous Darien Gap jungle

<p>The flight on Thursday followed a maiden journey financed by

nonprofit reclaims centuries-old cemetery for enslaved people</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>KINGSTON, New York — On a residential block in upstate New York,
college students dug and sifted backyard dirt as part of an
archeological exploration this summer of a centuries-old cemetery for
African Americans.</p>
<p>Now covered with green lawns in the city of Kingston, this spot in
1750 was part of a burial ground for people who were enslaved. It was
located on what was then the outskirts of town. An unknown number of
people who were denied church burials were interred here until the late
19th century, when the cemetery was covered over as the city grew.</p>
<p>The site is now being reclaimed as the Pine Street African Burial
Ground, one of many forgotten or neglected cemeteries for African
Americans getting fresh attention. In the last three summers, the
remains of up to 27 people have been located here.</p>
<p>Advocates in this Hudson River city purchased a residential property
covering about half the old cemetery several years ago and now use the
house there as a visitor center. Money is being raised to turn the urban
backyard into a respectful resting place. And while the names of people
buried here may be lost, tests are planned on their remains to shed
light on their lives and identify their descendants.</p>
<p>“The hardships of those buried here cannot just go down in vain,”
said Tyrone Wilson, founder of Harambee Kingston, the nonprofit
community group behind the project. “We have a responsibility to make
sure that we fix that disrespect.”</p>
<p>While the more-than-0.2 hectares site was designated as a cemetery
for people who were enslaved in 1750, it might have been in use before
then. Burials continued through about 1878, more than 50 years after New
York fully abolished slavery. Researchers say people were buried with
their feet to the east, so when they rise on Judgment Day they would
face the rising sun.</p>
<p>Remains found on the Harambee property are covered with patterned
African cloths and kept where they are. Remains found on adjoining land
are exhumed for later burial on the Harambee property.</p>
<p>Students from the State University of New York at New Paltz recently
finished a third summer of supervised backyard excavations in this city
129 kilometers upriver from Manhattan. The students get course credit,
though anthropology major Maddy Thomas said there’s an overriding sense
of mission.</p>
<p>“I don’t like when people feel upset or forgotten,” Thomas said on a
break. “And that is what’s happened here. So we’ve got to fix it.”</p>
<p>Harambee is trying to raise $1 million to transform the modest
backyard into resting spot that reflects the African heritage of the
people buried there. Plans include a tall marker in the middle of the
yard.</p>
<p>While some graves were apparently marked, it’s still hard to say who
was buried there.</p>
<p>“Some of them, it’s obvious, were marked with just a stone with no
writing on it,” said Joseph Diamond, associate professor of anthropology
at New Paltz.</p>
<p>The only intact headstone recovered with a name visible was for
Caezar Smith, who was born enslaved and died a free man in 1839 at age
41. A researcher mined historical records and came up with two more
people potentially buried there in 1803: a man identified as Sam and a
16-year-old girl named Deyon who was publicly hanged after being
convicted of murdering the 6-year-old daughter of her enslavers.</p>
<p>The cemetery was at first covered by a lumberyard by 1880, even
though some gravestones were apparently still standing by that date.</p>
<p>In 1990, Diamond was doing an archaeological survey for the city and
noticed the cemetery was marked on a map from 1870. He and the city
historian went out to find it.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, Pine Street building owner Andrew Kirschner had just
discovered buried bone chips while digging in front of the building in
search of a sewer pipe. He put the pieces in a box. Kirschner said he
was still digging when Diamond told him what they were looking for.</p>
<p>“The conversation begins and then I go, ‘Well, let me show you what I
found.’ Of course, they were amazed,” said Kirschner, who had owned the
building next to the current Harambee property.</p>
<p>Even after the discovery, Diamond said it was difficult to convince
people there were graves on Pine Street. There were even plans in 1996
to build a parking lot over much of the site. Advocates purchased the
property in 2019.</p>
<p>Similar stories of disregard and rediscovery have played out
elsewhere.</p>
<p>In Manhattan, the African Burial Ground National Monument marks the
site where an estimated 15,000 free and enslaved Africans were buried
until the 1790s. It was discovered in 1991 during excavations for a
federal building. Farther up the Hudson River, the renovation in
Newburgh of a century-old school into a courthouse in 2008 led to the
discovery of more than 100 sets of remains.</p>
<p>Antoinette Jackson, founder of The Black Cemetery Network, said many
of the 169 sites listed in their online archive had been erased.</p>
<p>“A good deal of them represent sites that have been built over — by
parking lots, schools, stadiums, highways. Others have been
under-resourced,” said Jackson, a professor of anthropology at the
University of Southern Florida.</p>
<p>She added that the cemeteries listed on the archive are just the “tip
of the iceberg.”</p>
<p>Given the meager historical record in Kingston, advocates hope tests
on the remains will help fill in some gaps. Isotopic analyses could
provide information on whether individuals grew up elsewhere — like
South Carolina or Africa — and then moved to the region. DNA analyses
could provide information on where in Africa their ancestors came from.
The DNA tests also might be able to link them to living descendants.</p>
<p>Wilson said local families have committed to providing DNA samples.
He sees the tests as another way to connect people to heritage.</p>
<p>“One of the biggest issues that we have in African culture is that we
don’t know our history,” he said. “We don’t have a lot of information of
who we are.”</p>

<h2 id="trump-asks-federal-court-to-intervene-in-hush-money-case">Trump
asks federal court to intervene in hush money case</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>new york — Donald Trump asked a federal court late Thursday to
intervene in his New York hush money criminal case, seeking a pathway to
overturn his felony conviction and indefinitely delay his sentencing
scheduled for next month.</p>
<p>Lawyers for the former president and current Republican nominee asked
the federal court in Manhattan to seize the case from the state court
where it was brought and tried, arguing that the historic prosecution
violated Trump’s constitutional rights and ran afoul of the U.S. Supreme
Court’s recent ruling on presidential immunity.</p>
<p>Trump’s lawyers said moving the case to federal court following his
May 30 conviction will give him an “unbiased forum, free from local
hostilities” to address those issues. If the case is moved to federal
court, Trump lawyers wrote, they will then seek to have the verdict
overturned and the case dismissed. If it remains in state court, with
sentencing proceeding as scheduled, it could amount to election
interference, they said.</p>
<p>“The ongoing proceedings will continue to cause direct and
irreparable harm to President Trump — the leading candidate in the 2024
Presidential election — and voters located far beyond Manhattan,” Trump
lawyers Todd Blanche and Emil Bove wrote in a 64-page U.S. District
Court filing.</p>
<p>Trump was convicted in state court in Manhattan of 34 counts of
falsifying business records related to a payment to bury affair
allegations that threatened to cloud his 2016 presidential run. Even if
the case isn’t moved to federal court, the potential delay caused by
litigation surrounding Trump’s effort could give him a critical reprieve
as he navigates the aftermath of his criminal conviction and the
homestretch of his presidential campaign.</p>
<p>Separately, the state court judge who presided over the trial, Juan
M. Merchan, is weighing Trump’s requests to postpone sentencing until
after Election Day, November 5, and to overturn the verdict and dismiss
the case in the wake of the Supreme Court’s immunity decision.</p>
<p>The high court’s July 1 ruling reins in prosecutions of ex-presidents
for official acts and restricts prosecutors in pointing to official acts
as evidence that a president’s unofficial actions were illegal.</p>
<p>Trump’s lawyers argue that in light of the ruling, jurors in the hush
money case should not have heard such evidence as former White House
staffers describing how the then-president reacted to news coverage of
the deal to pay hush money to porn actor Stormy Daniels.</p>
<p>Trump’s lawyers had previously invoked presidential immunity in a
failed bid last year to get the hush money case moved from state court
to federal court. A federal judge rejected that request, clearing the
way for Trump’s historic trial in state court.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein rejected Trump’s claim that
allegations in the hush money indictment involved official duties,
writing in July 2023, “The evidence overwhelmingly suggests that the
matter was a purely a personal item of the president — a cover-up of an
embarrassing event.”</p>
<p>“Hush money paid to an adult film star is not related to a
president’s official acts. It does not reflect in any way the color of
the president’s official duties,” Hellerstein added.</p>
<p>A message seeking comment was left with the Manhattan district
attorney’s office, which prosecuted the case.</p>

id="harris-vows-tougher-approach-on-migration-supports-weapons-for-israel">Harris
vows tougher approach on migration, supports weapons for Israel</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>savannah, georgia/washington — Kamala Harris vowed a tougher approach
to migration along the U.S. southern border and said she would not
withhold weapons to Israel, in her first interview with a major news
organization since becoming the Democratic nominee for president.</p>
<p>In the interview with CNN anchor Dana Bash, Harris sought to show she
is in command of the issues and give Americans a sense of her policy
positions with little more than two months until Election Day on
November 5.</p>
<p>Harris said she would renew a push for comprehensive border
legislation that would tighten migration into the United States and
vowed to “enforce our laws” against border crossings.</p>
<p>“We have laws that have to be followed and enforced, that address and
deal with people who cross our border illegally, and there should be
consequence,” Harris said.</p>
<p>She also hewed closely to President Joe Biden’s strong support of
Israel and rejected calls from some in the Democratic Party that
Washington should rethink sending weapons to Israel because of the heavy
Palestinian death toll in Gaza.</p>
<p>She said she supports a strong Israel but “we must get a deal done”
to get a cease-fire in the Gaza conflict.</p>
<p>“No, we have to get a (cease-fire and hostage) deal done,” Harris
said when asked if she would withhold weapons to Israel. She has been
Biden’s vice president since the start of his administration.</p>
<p>Abbas Alawieh, a co-founder of the Uncommitted National Movement that
has protested against Biden’s policy, expressed frustration over Harris’
response on Gaza.</p>
<p>“If the vice president is interested in a cease-fire, she must
support an immediate stop to sending the fire,” Alawieh said.</p>
<p>Harris, joined by her vice presidential running mate, Minnesota
Governor Tim Walz, also said she would like to add a Republican to her
cabinet if she wins the election.</p>
<p>“I think it’s important to have people at the table when some of the
most important decisions are being made that have different views,
different experiences. And I think it would be to the benefit of the
American public to have a member of my cabinet who was a Republican,”
she said. </p>
<p>Surging in polls</p>
<p>Since becoming the Democratic candidate for president last month,
Harris has surged in the polls, brought in hundreds of millions of
dollars in campaign donations, and had a series of forceful campaign
speeches.</p>
<p>She leads Trump 45% to 41% in a Reuters/Ipsos poll published on
Thursday that showed the vice president sparking new enthusiasm among
voters.</p>
<p>Some critics suggested she might be less polished in unscripted
settings like a TV interview, but she appeared to make no major mistakes
on Thursday.</p>
<p>Harris defended her and Biden’s handling of inflation, saying they
inherited a pandemic-ravaged economy that she said Trump had mismanaged.
She said much work had been done to lower prices but that “prices are
still too high.”</p>
<p>Jeremi Suri, history and public affairs professor at the University
of Texas at Austin, said Harris came across as knowledgeable and a
“consensus builder” in the interview but she could have had “more
concrete and specific answers” on what she would do on her first day as
president.</p>
<p>Harris has moved more toward the center on some issues from the time
she ran for president in 2020 until she took over from Biden last month
as the Democrats’ choice to face Republican former President Donald
Trump in the election.</p>
<p>She has toughened her position on migration along the southern U.S.
border with Mexico. She also no longer wants a ban on fracking, an
energy production method that employs many people in Pennsylvania, one
of a handful of swing states that could decide the election.</p>
<p>When asked about her policy shifts, Harris said: “My values have not
changed.”</p>
<p>Harris dismissed a comment from Trump in which he questioned whether
she was a Black American. “Same old tired playbook,” she said. “Next
question, please.”</p>
<p>Trump, in a post on Truth Social, responded to the interview by
saying: “I look so forward to Debating Comrade Kamala Harris and
exposing her for the fraud she is.” Trump often falsely refers to Harris
as a Marxist.</p>
<p>Though she has taken questions from journalists on the campaign trail
and been interviewed on TikTok in recent days, she had, until Thursday,
not done a one-on-one interview with a major network or print journalist
since Biden ended his reelection campaign on July 21 and endorsed
her.</p>
<p>Bash, who co-moderated the June 27 debate between Trump and Biden
that ultimately led to the president’s departure from the race,
conducted the interview in Savannah, Georgia, as Harris and Walz were on
a campaign bus tour.</p>
<p>Harris widens lead over Trump with boost from women, Hispanics,
Reuters/Ipsos poll finds.</p>

<h2 id="pg_hint_plan-v1.7.0-released">pg_hint_plan v1.7.0 Released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-30, from: PostgreSQL News</p>

pg_hint_plan is a PostgreSQL extension that offers the possibility to
tweak PostgreSQL execution plans using so-called “hints” in SQL
comments. For more information, see
<a href="https://github.com/ossc-db/pg_hint_plan/">the project page</a>.
</p>
<p>
