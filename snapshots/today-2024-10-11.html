racial disparities in stock market investments persist</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-11, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
Stocks are increasingly an important source of household wealth. Thanks
to the booming stock market, U.S. household wealth surged to a record
high last year, per Federal Reserve data. But there are continued racial
differences in stock ownership, which has big implications for the
racial wealth gap. We’ll learn more. Also on the show: producer prices
remain tame, and business travel spending rebounds.

<h2 id="blinken-warns-china-against-provocations-toward-taiwan">Blinken
warns China against provocations toward Taiwan</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>VIENTIANE, LAOS — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken Friday
warned China against military provocations toward Taiwan, following
Beijing’s strong reaction to an annual speech by the leader of the
self-ruled democracy.</p>
<p>“I can tell you that with regard to the so-called Ten Ten speech,
which is a regular exercise, China should not use it in any fashion as a
pretext for provocative actions,” Blinken told reporters during a press
conference in Vientiane, Laos. </p>
<p>He was referring to October 10, known as Double Ten Day, when Taiwan
celebrates the founding of the Republic of China in 1912, just months
after an uprising that began on October 10, 1911.</p>
<p>The People’s Republic of China celebrates its national day on October
1, marking the founding of the country in 1949. </p>
<p>China has continued to ramp up its military threats against Taiwan,
following President Lai Ching-te’s Thursday speech, which rejected
China’s claim of sovereignty over the island.</p>
<p>Blinken was in Vientiane for meetings with leaders from the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations and participated in the East Asia
Summit. </p>
<p>He said there is a strong desire among all ASEAN countries, along
with others present, to maintain peace and stability across the Taiwan
Strait, with neither side taking actions that undermine the status
quo.</p>
<p>Earlier on Friday, Taiwan detected 20 Chinese military aircraft and
10 naval vessels around Taiwan. Thirteen of the aircraft crossed the
median line and entered Taiwan’s northern and southwestern Air Defense
Identification Zone, according to a posting on social media platform X
by Taiwan’s defense ministry.</p>
<p>Between Wednesday and Thursday, Taiwan also detected 27 Chinese
military aircraft, nine naval vessels, and five official ships.</p>
<p>In Beijing, Chinese officials said Taiwan “has no so-called
sovereignty.”</p>
<p>Mao Ning, a spokesperson for China’s Foreign Affairs Ministry,
slammed Lai, accusing him of having “the ill intention of heightening
tensions in the Taiwan Strait for his selfish political interest.”</p>
<p>Taiwan has been self-ruled since 1949, when Mao Zedong’s communists
took power in Beijing after defeating Chiang Kai-shek’s Kuomintang
nationalists in a civil war, prompting the nationalists’ relocation to
the island.</p>
<p>Washington switched its diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing
to counter the then-Soviet Union in 1979.  </p>
<p>Since then, relations between the U.S. and Taiwan have been governed
by the Taiwan Relations Act that Congress passed in April 1979, under
which the U.S. provides defense equipment to Taiwan.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In September, Taiwan President Lai said if China’s claims over Taiwan
are truly based on concerns about territorial integrity, it should also
seek to reclaim the 600,000 square kilometers of land it ceded to Russia
in the 19th century — an area almost the size of Ukraine.</p>

<p>The final outcome of the case: the plaintiff was ordered to cover
$102,404 in fees and $165.72 in costs for the defendant. This should
serve as a cautionary tale for would-be plaintiffs: copyright lawsuits,
like any other type of litigation, are primarily meant to address the
damages plaintiffs actually suffered, and the final settlement should
make plaintiffs whole again—that is, as if no infringement has ever
occurred. Copyright lawsuits (or the threat to sue) should not be
undertaken as a way to create brand new income streams. </p>

“We’ve just softened the boundaries a little bit and allowed politics to
creep into the workplace,” says Sean Westwood, director of the
Polarization Research Lab at Dartmouth. As part of
<a href="https://www.marketplace.org/collection/office-politics/">our

focusing on how companies intensify or ease political divides. Today:
the argument for just not talking about politics or other divisive

id="us-still-believes-iran-has-not-decided-to-build-a-nuclear-weapon-us-officials-say">US
still believes Iran has not decided to build a nuclear weapon, US
officials say</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The United States still believes that Iran has not
decided to build a nuclear weapon despite Tehran’s recent strategic
setbacks, including Israel’s killing of Hezbollah leaders and two
largely unsuccessful attempts to attack Israel, two U.S. officials told
Reuters.</p>
<p>The comments from a senior Biden administration official and a
spokesperson for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence
(ODNI) added to public remarks earlier this week by CIA Director William
Burns, who said the United States had not seen any evidence Iran’s
leader had reversed his 2003 decision to suspend the weaponization
program.</p>
<p>“We assess that the Supreme Leader has not made a decision to resume
the nuclear weapons program that Iran suspended in 2003,” said the ODNI
spokesperson, referring to Iran’s leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.</p>
<p>The intelligence assessment could help explain U.S. opposition to any
Israeli strike on Iran’s nuclear program in retaliation for a ballistic
missile attack that Tehran carried out last week.</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden said after that attack he would not support
an Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear sites, but did not explain why he
had reached that conclusion. His remarks drew fierce criticism from
Republicans, including former President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>U.S. officials have long acknowledged that an attempt to destroy
Iran’s nuclear weapons program might only delay the country’s efforts to
develop a nuclear bomb and could even strengthen Tehran’s resolve to do
so.</p>
<p>“We’re all watching this space very carefully,” the Biden
administration official said.</p>
<p>Iran’s mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately
respond to a request for comment but Tehran has repeatedly denied ever
having had a nuclear weapons program.</p>
<p>Key Iran ally weakened</p>
<p>In the past weeks, Israel’s military has inflicted heavy losses on
Hezbollah, the most powerful member of the Iran-backed network known as
the Axis of Resistance. The group’s setbacks have included the killing
of its leader Hassan Nasrallah in an Israeli airstrike last month.</p>
<p>The weakening of a key Iranian ally has prompted some experts to
speculate that Tehran may restart its efforts to acquire a nuclear bomb
to protect itself.</p>
<p>Beth Sanner, a former U.S deputy director of national intelligence,
said the risk of Khamenei reversing his 2003 religious dictum against
nuclear weapons is “higher now than it has been” and that if Israel were
to strike nuclear facilities Tehran would likely move ahead with
building a nuclear weapon.</p>
<p>That would still take time, however.</p>
<p>“They can’t get a weapon in a day. It will take months and months and
months,” said Sanner, now a fellow with the German Marshall Fund.</p>
<p>Iran is now enriching uranium to up to 60% fissile purity, close to
the 90% of weapons grade, at two sites, and in theory it has enough
material enriched to that level, if enriched further, for almost four
bombs, according to a yardstick of the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA), the U.N. watchdog.</p>
<p>The expansion in Iran’s enrichment program has reduced the so-called
breakout time it would need to produce enough weapons-grade uranium for
a nuclear bomb to “a week or a little more,” according to Burns, from
more than a year under a 2015 accord that Trump pulled out of when
president. Actually making a bomb with that material would take longer.
How long is less clear and the subject of debate.</p>
<p>Possible Israeli attack</p>
<p>Israel has not yet disclosed what it will target in retaliation for
Iran’s attack last week with more than 180 ballistic missiles, which
largely failed thanks to interceptions by Israeli air defenses as well
as by the U.S. military.</p>
<p>The United States has been privately urging Israel to calibrate its
response to avoid triggering a broader war in the Middle East, officials
say, with Biden publicly voicing his opposition to a nuclear attack and
concerns about a strike on Iran’s energy infrastructure.</p>
<p>Israel, however, views Iran’s nuclear program as an existential
threat.</p>
<p>The conflicts in the Middle East between Israel and Iran and
Iran-backed groups in Lebanon, Gaza and Yemen have become campaign
issues ahead of the November 5 presidential election, with Trump and his
Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, positioning themselves
as pro-Israel.</p>
<p>Speaking at a campaign event last week, Trump mocked Biden for
opposing an attack on Iran’s nuclear sites, saying: “That’s the thing
you wanna hit, right?”</p>
<p>Avi Melamed, a former Israeli intelligence officer and government
official, said Iran still had space to compensate for setbacks dealt to
its proxies and missile force without having to resort to developing a
nuclear warhead.</p>
<p>“The Iranians have to recalculate what’s next. I don’t think at this
point they will rush to either develop or boost the (nuclear) program
toward military capacity,” he said.</p>
<p>“They will look around to find what maneuvering space they can move
around in.”</p>

id="blinken-tells-asean-the-us-is-worried-about-chinas-actions-in-south-china-sea">Blinken
tells ASEAN the US is worried about China’s actions in South China
Sea</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>VIENTIANE, Laos — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told
Southeast Asian leaders Friday that the U.S. is concerned about China’s
“increasingly dangerous and unlawful” activities in the disputed South
China Sea during an annual summit meeting and pledged the U.S. will
continue to uphold freedom of navigation in the vital sea trade
route.</p>
<p>The 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations’ meeting with
Blinken followed a series of violent confrontations at sea between China
and ASEAN members Philippines and Vietnam, which have fueled concerns
that China’s increasingly assertive actions in the waterways could
spiral into a full-scale conflict.</p>
<p>China, which claims almost the entire sea, has overlapping claims
with ASEAN members Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei, as
well as Taiwan. About a third of global trade transits through the sea,
which is also rich in fishing stocks, gas and oil.</p>
<p>Beijing has refused to recognize a 2016 international arbitration
ruling by a U.N.-affiliated court in the Hague that invalidated its
expansive claims and has built up and militarized islands it
controls.</p>
<p>“We are very concerned about China’s increasingly dangerous and
unlawful activities in the South China Sea which have injured people,
harm vessels from ASEAN nations and contradict commitments to peaceful
resolutions of disputes,” said Blinken, who is filling in for President
Joe Biden, in his opening speech at the U.S.-ASEAN summit. “The United
States will continue to support freedom of navigation, and freedom of
overflight in the Indo Pacific.”</p>
<p>The United States has no claims in the South China Sea but has
deployed navy ships and fighter jets to patrol the waters in a challenge
to China’s claims.</p>
<p>Chinese and Philippine vessels have clashed repeatedly this year, and
Vietnam said last week that Chinese forces assaulted its fishermen in
the disputed sea. China has also sent patrol vessels to areas that
Indonesia and Malaysia claim as exclusive economic zones.</p>
<p>The United States has warned repeatedly that it’s obligated to defend
the Philippines — its oldest treaty ally in Asia — if Filipino forces,
ships or aircraft come under armed attack, including in the South China
Sea.</p>
<p>Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. complained to summit
leaders on Thursday that his country “continues to be subject to
harassment and intimidation” by China. He said it was “regrettable that
the overall situation in the South China Sea remains tense and
unchanged” due to China’s actions, which he said violated international
law. He has called for more urgency in ASEAN-China negotiations on a
code of conduct to govern the South China Sea.</p>
<p>Singaporean leader Lawrence Wong earlier this week warned of “real
risks of an accident spiraling into conflict” if the sea dispute isn’t
addressed.</p>
<p>Malaysia, who takes over the rotating ASEAN chair next year, is
expected to push to accelerate talks on the code of conduct. Officials
have agreed to try and complete the code by 2026, but talks have been
hampered by sticky issues including disagreements over whether the pact
should be binding.</p>
<p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang was defiant during talks on Thursday. He
called South China Sea a “shared home” but repeated China’s assertion
that it was merely protecting its sovereign rights, officials said. Li
also blamed meddling by “external forces” who sought to “introduce bloc
confrontation and geopolitical conflicts into Asia.” Li didn’t name the
foreign forces, but China has previously warned the U.S. not to meddle
in the region’s territorial disputes.</p>
<p>In another firm message to China, Blinken said the United States
believed “it is also important to maintain our shared commitment to
protect stability across the Taiwan Strait.” China claims the self-ruled
island of Taiwan as its own territory and bristles at other countries’
patrolling the body of water separating it from the island.</p>
<p>Blinken also attended an 18-nation East Asia Summit, along with the
Chinese premier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, and leaders
from Japan, South Korea, India, Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p>ASEAN has treaded carefully on the sea dispute with China, which is
the bloc’s largest trading partner and its third largest investor. It
hasn’t marred trade relations, with the two sides focusing on expanding
a free trade area covering a market of 2 billion people.</p>
<p>Blinken said the annual ASEAN summit talks were a platform to address
other shared challenges including the civil war in Myanmar, North
Korea’s “destabilizing behavior” and Russia’s war aggression in Ukraine.
He said the U.S. remained the top foreign investor in the region and
aims to strengthen its partnership with ASEAN.</p>

Milton disrupts Yom Kippur plans for Jews in Florida</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WINTER PARK, Florida — Many Jews worldwide will mark Yom Kippur in
fasting and prayer at their synagogues this weekend.</p>
<p>But for the faithful in Florida, destructive Hurricane Milton has
disrupted plans for observing the Day of Atonement — the holiest day of
the year in the Jewish faith — that begins Friday evening and caps off
the High Holy Days that began with Rosh Hashana on October 2.</p>
<p>Across the storm-threatened areas, rabbis and their congregants spent
part of the Days of Awe — the span between Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur —
protecting their homes and synagogues as Milton churned off the coast,
spiraling into a Category 5 storm. Many — though not all — evacuated,
heeding the voluntary and mandatory orders, and found safekeeping for
their synagogues’ Torah scrolls and themselves.</p>
<p>Milton hit Florida’s Gulf Coast on Wednesday as a Category 3 cyclone,
with damaging winds, heavy rains and tornadoes. By Thursday, the storm
had moved eastward into the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>Why this rabbi decided against evacuating before storm</p>
<p>Rabbi Yitzchok Minkowicz evacuated most of his family ahead of the
storm, but chose to ride it out with his son, also a rabbi, at Chabad
Lubavitch of Southwest Florida near Fort Myers. The center is hosting
people displaced by the storm, including doctors, first responders and
elderly who cannot evacuate.</p>
<p>It’s important to be “with the people and for the people,” and
provide emotional and spiritual support, he said as the storm
approached.</p>
<p>Near midnight Thursday, the Chabad center and the rest of the
neighborhood lost power, said Minkowicz, making them among the millions
without it. The center was spared from the storm surge, but homes and
other buildings in the area were not, he said.</p>
<p>“Our pressing need is for Power so that we can help our community
&amp; hold Yom Kippur services,” Minkowicz told The Associated Press via
email Thursday. “We’re praying for this to be resolved asap.”</p>
<p>The center planned to host Yom Kippur observances regardless of the
storm. He said it was similar two years ago, when the holy day followed
the major hurricane, Ian.</p>
<p>“Yom Kippur is a day that you open up your soul to God and you
totally connect with God,” Minkowicz said. “When you go through a
hurricane, anything materialistic is not important. They’re already in
that zone where they’re totally focused on God.”</p>
<p>Congregation Beth Am in the Tampa Bay area also lost power and plans
to hold Yom Kippur services online, said Rabbi Jason Rosenberg of the
Reform synagogue.</p>
<p>“It’s important to keep perspective. Having a service online is not
what anybody wants, but it could’ve been a lot worse,” he said. “This
feels like a blessing.”</p>
<p>The storm underscored one of Yom Kippur’s annual reflections.</p>
<p>An implicit question, he said before Milton’s landfall, is “If this
was going to be your last year on earth, how would you want to act
differently? … When you’ve got a historical storm, a potentially
life-threatening and life-altering storm bearing down on you, that
message is really present.”</p>
<p>Milton disrupts Yom Kippur and October 7 commemoration</p>
<p>Like most of her congregants, Rabbi Nicole Luna had evacuated after
helping secure Temple Beth El in Fort Myers, and entrusting several
Torah scrolls to congregants should the threatened surge devastate the
synagogue.</p>
<p>While the congregation braved Hurricanes Irma in 2017 and Ian in
2022, Milton’s timing hit especially hard, having already forced the
postponement of community-wide commemoration of Hamas attacking Israel
on October 7, 2023. The war that followed is ongoing.</p>
<p>“It just feels like too much for our hearts to carry right now,” Luna
said from Miami ahead of the storm. “It’s all very heavy.”</p>
<p>After the storm passed through, Luna told her congregation that their
synagogue had emerged undamaged, though it lost power.</p>
<p>She announced plans for a service via Zoom on Friday evening, and
in-person services Saturday.</p>
<p>“We hope by Saturday more traffic lights will be restored but please
only come if you can safely navigate the roads,” she said in her
message.</p>
<p>Luna said she was grateful for the “big outpouring of support” she
received from fellow rabbis across the East Coast of Florida, who were
opening their temples for the holidays to evacuees and have emphasized
they can come as they are since few grabbed “holiday-appropriate
clothing” in the rush to escape Milton’s fury.</p>
<p>The Chabad of Southwest Broward near Fort Lauderdale is hosting
several evacuees from areas most affected by the storm, ranging from a
mother with her newborn to an elderly couple, said director Rabbi Pinny
Andrusier. They are invited to spend Yom Kippur with the Cooper
City-based group, including sharing kosher meals before and after the
day of fasting.</p>
<p>“We were spared, thank God,” Andrusier said of the storm. “We’ve been
able to open up our doors” for those in the hurricane zone.</p>
<p>Synagogue skips holding Yom Kippur services</p>
<p>Hundreds of Jewish families on Longboat Key, a barrier island off
Sarasota Bay, won’t be able to observe Yom Kippur in their synagogue for
the very first time in their 45-year history, said Shepard Englander,
CEO of The Jewish Federation of Sarasota-Manatee.</p>
<p>Access to the island, specifically the John Ringling Causeway, was
closed ahead of the storm. The congregation decided it wasn’t worth
risking Milton’s might for Day of Atonement services. They had
celebrated Rosh Hashana in their building despite a number of nearby
homes being damaged by Hurricane Helene, which made landfall last
month.</p>
<p>Englander said he and his family evacuated from their home on a
riverbank outside Sarasota and were hunkered down at a friend’s home
inland. From there, he was trying to make sure community members from
Longboat Key and other temples that won’t have services can say their
prayers and break their daylong Yom Kippur fast at a newly constructed
conference center in Sarasota with food items like blintzes, bagels,
cream cheese and smoked salmon.</p>
<p>Ahead of the storm, people were scattered in the region at emergency
shelters or staying with family or friends, Englander said.</p>
<p>“It’s in difficult times that you really understand the power of
community,” he said. “And this is a caring, tight-knit, generous Jewish
community.”</p>

rescued from Colorado gold mine where elevator mishap killed 1
person</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>denver — Twelve people were rescued Thursday night after being
trapped for about six hours at the bottom of a former Colorado gold mine
when an elevator malfunctioned at the tourist site, authorities said.
One person died in the accident.</p>
<p>The elevator was descending into the Mollie Kathleen Gold Mine near
the town of Cripple Creek when it had a mechanical problem around 150
meters beneath the surface, creating a “severe danger for the
participants,” and one person was killed, Teller County Sheriff Jason
Mikesell said.</p>
<p>The 12 adults who were trapped were about 305 meters below ground,
but they had access to water and the atmosphere was considered good.
They were safe and in communication with authorities with radios while
waiting, Mikesell said.</p>
<p>They were in good spirits after they were rescued, and authorities
gave them pizza once they were out and told them everything that had
happened, he said. While at the bottom, authorities had told them only
that there was an elevator issue.</p>
<p>Mikesell said during a nighttime briefing that authorities do not
know yet what caused the malfunction and an investigation is underway.
Engineers worked to make sure the elevator was working safely again
before bringing the stranded visitors back up on it. They had been
prepared to bring them up by rope if necessary, had they not been able
to get the elevator fixed.</p>
<p>Mikesell declined to reveal the identification of the victim.</p>
<p>The incident, which was reported to authorities at about noon,
happened during the final week of the Mollie Kathleen Gold Mine season
before it shuts down for the winter, Mikesell said.</p>
<p>Earlier in the afternoon — while the 12 were stuck at the bottom — 11
other people who were riding the elevator were rescued. Four had minor
injuries. The sheriff did not elaborate on how they were injured.</p>
<p>The elevator ride typically takes about two minutes, travelling about
152 meters per minute, according to the mine’s website.</p>
<p>Mikesell said the last time there was an incident was in the 1980s
when a couple of people were trapped on the elevator. Nobody died in
that incident.</p>
<p>Mines that operate as tourist attractions in Colorado must designate
someone to inspect the mines and the transportation systems daily,
according to the state Division of Reclamation, Mining and Safety.
Mikesell said he didn’t know the date of the last inspection. Records of
the inspections weren’t immediately available online.</p>
<p>Gov. Jared Polis sent state resources including a mine rescue
team.</p>
<p>Cripple Creek is a town of about 1,100 in the Rocky Mountains
southwest of Colorado Springs.</p>
<p>The mine opened in the 1800s and closed in 1961, but still operates
tours. Its website describes a one-hour tour in which visitors descend
304 meters. It says they can see veins of gold in the rock and ride an
underground tram.</p>
<p>A woman named Mollie Kathleen Gortner discovered the site of the mine
in 1891 when she saw quartz laced with gold, according to the company’s
website.</p>

id="afghan-charged-in-election-day-terror-plot-passed-multiple-screenings">Afghan
charged in Election Day terror plot passed multiple screenings</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The Afghan national charged in a plot to carry out an
Election Day terror attack in the United States passed multiple
background checks before being allowed to enter the country, U.S.
officials told VOA.</p>
<p>FBI agents arrested Nasir Ahmad Tawhedi, 27, in Oklahoma City,
Oklahoma, on Monday, alleging he and a juvenile co-conspirator had been
in contact with a recruiter for the Islamic State terror group and had
been planning to die in a mass shooting.</p>
<p>Court documents also stated that Tawhedi hoped to relocate most of
his family, including his wife and 1-year-old daughter, back to
Afghanistan to live according to what he described as “pure Islam.”</p>
<p>However, U.S. officials, speaking to VOA on the condition of
anonymity to discuss details of a case still under investigation, said
Thursday that there were no indications Tawhedi was sympathetic to the
Islamic State, also known as IS, ISIS or Daesh, either when he worked
for the United States in Afghanistan or when he was screened immediately
before to coming to the U.S. three years ago.</p>
<p>“Every Afghan being resettled in the United States undergoes a
rigorous screening and vetting process, no matter which [U.S.] agency
they worked with,” the official said.</p>
<p>“That process includes checking against a full range of relevant U.S.
records and holdings,” the official added. “Tawhedi would not have been
admitted to the United States had information of concern surfaced.”</p>
<p>Kinds of data</p>
<p>A second U.S. official told VOA that Tawhedi’s vetting included
checks that involved both biometric data collected by the U.S.
Department of Defense and the FBI, and classified information held by
U.S. intelligence agencies.</p>
<p>Subsequent screenings that allowed him to be approved for a Special
Immigrant Visa after he entered the U.S. also came up clean.</p>
<p>“Vetting is a point-in-time check that evaluates information
available to the U.S. government at that time,” the official said.</p>
<p>The second official also said the government can take additional
actions “if individuals who have entered the country are later found to
be associated with information indicating a potential national security
or public safety concern.”</p>
<p>NBC News, which first reported that Tawhedi’s background checks
failed to detect any red flags, quoted sources as saying he had worked
as a security guard for the CIA before being resettled in the U.S.</p>
<p>When reached by VOA, the CIA declined comment.</p>
<p>But the arrest has raised concerns among some U.S. lawmakers.</p>
<p>The chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, Republican
Representative Mark Green, sent a letter Wednesday to the FBI and the
Department of Homeland Security demanding more information.</p>
<p>“These recent arrests raise serious concerns about the ongoing threat
that ISIS and its fanatical supporters pose to U.S. national security,
as well as the shortfall in the Biden-Harris administration’s screening
and vetting capabilities,” Green wrote.</p>
<p>“Additionally, news of these potential Afghan terrorists comes when
only months ago, it was widely reported that eight Tajikistanis with
ties to ISIS were arrested in Los Angeles, New York and Philadelphia
after they had illegally crossed the border,” Green added.</p>
<p>The FBI confirmed receipt of Green’s letter but declined further
comment.</p>
<p>A Homeland Security spokesperson did not comment on the letter but
described the vetting process for Afghans fleeing Taliban rule as
“multilayered.”</p>
<p>“Afghan evacuees who sought to enter the United States were subject
to multilayered screening and vetting against intelligence, law
enforcement and counterterrorism information,” the spokesperson told VOA
in an email. “If new information emerges after arrival, appropriate
action is taken.”</p>
<p>When was he radicalized?</p>
<p>But in the case of Tawhedi, questions remain.</p>
<p>“What’s not clear from the information currently available is exactly
when Tawhedi was radicalized to the Islamic State ideology,” said Austin
Doctor, the director of counterterrorism research initiatives at the
National Counterterrorism Innovation, Technology and Education Center
(NCITE).</p>
<p>“We don’t know yet whether he radicalized after arriving to the
United States or if he already held pro-ISIS beliefs prior to leaving
Afghanistan,” Doctor told VOA. “This matters.”</p>
<p>According to court documents, a search of Tawhedi’s phone and social
media accounts showed he had been doing internet searches to find and
consume IS propaganda, though when that started is not clear.</p>
<p>The earliest date for any involvement with IS, according to the
criminal complaint filed Monday, is sometime around March of this year,
when Tawhedi made two cryptocurrency transfers worth at least $540 to
what prosecutors described as a charity that fronts for IS.</p>
<p>About four months later, in July, someone made a video recording –
saved to Tawhedi’s phone – of Tawhedi reading to a nephew and his
daughter about the rewards waiting for martyrs in the afterlife.</p>
<p>The first indications of a possible terror plot emerged that same
month, when the FBI said Tawhedi did online searches about webcams for
the White House and the Washington Monument, as well as about procuring
guns.</p>
<p>It also remains unclear whether Tawhedi’s Islamic State contact was
working for the group’s Afghan affiliate, known as IS-Khorasan or
ISIS-K.</p>
<p>“We’ve seen ISIS-K make a concerted effort to recruit from diaspora
communities,” NCITE’s Doctor told VOA. “And facilitating external
operations and inspiring homegrown violent extremist attacks are both
prominent elements of the group’s playbook.”</p>

Forces Storm-Wrecked Homeowners to Choose: Build Up or Move Out?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-10, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzgwMDM2NC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2OTQ0OTMyMX0.Tj1Z5dbJjVvQd1fziiA-uKZ00NAmrqLgXsQ1lw6niC4/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
After the storm, we rebuild. That’s the mantra repeated by residents,
businesses and elected officials after any big storm. Hurricane Milton
may have avoided the worst case scenario of a direct hit on the Tampa
Bay area, but communities south of Tampa experienced heavy flooding just
a couple weeks after being hit by Hurricane Helene.
</p>
<p>
While the damage is still being assessed in Sarasota County’s barrier
islands, homes that require extensive renovations will almost certainly
run up against what is known as the 50% rule — or, in Southwest Florida,
the
“<a href="https://www.swflappraisals.com/fema-fifty-percent-rule/#:~:text=And%20the%2050%25%20rule%20states,most%20recent%20flood%20prevention%20regulations." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>dreaded</u></a>
50% rule.”
</p>
<p>
In flood zone-situated communities eligible to receive insurance from
the National Flood Insurance Program, any renovations to repair
“substantial damage” — defined as repairs whose cost exceeds 50% of the
value of the structure (not the land, which can often be quite valuable
due to its proximity to the water) — must bring the entire structure
“into compliance with current local floodplain management standards.” In
practice, this typically means elevating the home above what FEMA
defines as the area’s
“<a href="https://www.fema.gov/about/glossary/base-flood-elevation-bfe#:~:text=The%20elevation%20of%20surface%20water,%2C%20V1%E2%80%93V30%20and%20VE." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>base
flood elevation</u></a>,” which is the level that a “100-year-flood”
would reach, plus some amount determined by the building code.
</p>
<p>
The rule almost invites conflict. Because just as much as local
communities and homeowners want to restore things to the way they were,
the federal government doesn’t want to insure structures that are simply
going to get destroyed. On Siesta Key, where Milton made landfall, the
base flood elevation ranges from 7 feet to 9 feet, meaning that
elevating a home to comply with flood codes could be beyond the means —
or at least the insurance payouts — of some homeowners.
</p>
<p>
“You got a 1952 house that’s 1,400 square feet, and you get 4 feet of
water,” Jeff Brandes, a former state legislator and president of the
Florida Policy Project, told me on Wednesday, explaining how the rule
could have played out in Tampa. “That means new kitchens and new
bathrooms, all new flooring and baseboards and drywall to 4 or 5 feet.”
That kind of claim could easily run to $150,000, which might well
surpass the FEMA threshold. “Now all of the sudden you get into the 50%
rule that you have the entire house up to current code levels. But then
you have to do another half-a-million above what [insurance] paid you.”
</p>
<p>
Simple probability calculations show that a 100-year flood (which is
really a flood elevation that has a 1-in-100 chance of occurring every
year) has a more than 25% chance of occurring during the lifetime of a
mortgage. If you browse Siesta Key real estate on Zillow, much of it is
given a 100% chance of flooding sometime over the course of a 30-year
mortgage, according to data analysis by First Street.
</p>
<p>
Sarasota County as a whole has around 62,000 NFIP policies with some
$16.6 billion in total coverage (although more than 80% percent of
households have
<a href="https://www.harrisinsurance.com/sarasota-fl-flood-insurance-coverage/#:~:text=Not%20acquiring%20flood%20insurance%20in,do%20not%20have%20flood%20insurance." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>no
flood insurance at all)</u></a>. Considering that flood insurance is
<a href="https://www.floodsmart.gov/am-i-required-have-flood-insurance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>required</u></a>
in high-risk areas for federally-backed mortgages and for new homeowners
insurance policies
<a href="https://www.pnj.com/story/money/2024/03/15/citizens-mandatory-flood-insurance/72978182007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>written
by Florida’s state backed property insurer of last resort</u></a>,
Citizens, FEMA is likely to take a close interest in whether communities
affected by Milton and Helene are complying with its rules.<br/>
</p>
<p>
If 2022’s Hurricane Ian is any indication, squabbles over the 50% rule
are almost certain to emerge — and soon.
</p>
<p>
Earlier this year,
<a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/04/lee-county-fema-flood-zone-construction-50-percent-rule/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>FEMA
told Lee County</u></a>, which includes Fort Myers and Cape Coral, that
it was rescinding the discount its residents and a handful of towns
within it receive on flood insurance because, the agency claimed, more
than 600 homeowners had violated the 50% rule after Hurricane Ian.
Following an outcry from local officials and congressional
representatives,
<a href="https://winknews.com/2024/07/19/cape-coral-keeps-fema-flood-discount/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>FEMA
restored the discount</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
In their efforts to avoid triggering the rule, homeowners are hardly
rogue actors. Local governments often actively assist them.
</p>
<p>
FEMA had initiated a similar procedure in Lee County the year before,
threatening to drop homeowners from the flood insurance program for
using possibly inaccurate appraisals to avoid the 50% rule before
<a href="https://www.news-press.com/story/news/local/2023/02/22/fema-50-percent-rule-lee-county-florida-appraiser-property-values-allowed-hurricane-ian/69933389007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>eventually
relenting</u></a>. The <em><em>Fort Myers News Press</em></em> reported
that the appraisals were provided by the county, which was deliberately
“lowering the amount that residents could use to calculate their repairs
or rebuilds” to avoid triggering the rule.
</p>
<p>
Less than a month after Ian swept through Southwest Florida, Cape Coral
advised residents to
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/CityofCapeCoral/posts/pfbid0213LAr9too6BDBe24yDiDhdMiKPU3z9Eehk99eLPGQLpcco58oXeN8DinvYFzRG3Sl" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>delay
and slow down repairs</u></a> for the same reason, as the rule there
applied to money spent on repairs over the course of a year. Some
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=treasury+island+lookback+period&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS940US940&oq=treasury+island+lookback+period&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIJCAEQIRgKGKABMgkIAhAhGAoYoAEyCQgDECEYChigATIJCAQQIRgKGKABMgcIBRAhGKsCMgcIBhAhGKsCMgcIBxAhGKsC0gEINTE2OGowajeoAgCwAgA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#:~:text=Belleair%20Beach%20homeowners,news%20%E2%80%BA%20local%20%E2%80%BA%20pinellascounty" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>highly
exposed coastal communities</u></a> in Pinellas County have been
adjusting their “lookback rules” — the period over which repairs are
totaled to see if they hit the 50% rule — to make them shorter so
homeowners are less likely to have to make the substantive repairs
<a href="https://www.wtsp.com/article/news/local/pinellascounty/homes-lookback-period-repair/67-15fadaa0-bf77-4399-9a1c-f65f285b3b49" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>required</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
This followed similar actions by local governments in Charlotte County.
As the <em><em>Punta Gordon Sun</em></em> put it, “City Council members
learned the federal regulation impacts its homeowners — and they decided
to do something about it.” In the Sarasota County community of North
Port, local officials
<a href="https://www.heraldtribune.com/story/news/local/venice/2022/11/23/hurricane-ian-recovery-north-port-eases-rules-rebuild-floods/10761279002/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>scrapped
a rule</u></a> that added up repair costs over a five-year period to
make it possible for homeowners to rebuild without triggering elevation
requirements.
</p>
<p>
When the 50% rule “works,” it can lead to the communities most affected
by big storms being fundamentally changed, both in terms of the
structures that are built and who occupies them.The end result of the
rebuilding following Helene and Milton — or the next big storm to hit
Florida’s Gulf Coast — or the one after that, and so on — may be
wealthier homeowners in more resilient homes essentially serving as a
flood barrier for everyone else, and picking up more of the bill if the
waters rise too high again.
</p>
<p>
Florida’s Gulf Coast has long been seen as a place where the middle
class can afford beachfront property. Elected officials’ resistance to
the FEMA rule only goes to show just how important keeping a lid on the
cost of living — quite literally, the cost of legally inhabiting a
structure — is to the voters and residents they represent.
</p>
<p>
Still, said Brandes, “There’s the right way to come out of this thing.
The wrong way is to build exactly back what you built before.”

<h2 id="what-happens-to-a-landfill-in-a-hurricane">What Happens to a
Landfill in a Hurricane?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-10, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzgwMDIxMi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1NjQ2OTkyN30.2B4I1U8C-uMyLHuj5ZYyPuRmBDBztHHT_wPNFkCoTPc/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
In the coming days and weeks, as Floridians and others in storm-ravaged
communities clean up from Hurricane Milton, trucks will carry all manner
of storm-related detritus — chunks of buildings, fences, furniture, even
cars — to the same place all their other waste goes: the local landfill.
But what about the landfill itself? Does this gigantic trash pile take
to the air and scatter Dorito bags and car parts alike around the
surrounding region?
</p>
<p>
No, thankfully. As Richard Meyers, the director of land management
services at the Solid Waste Authority of Palm Beach County, assured me,
all landfill waste is covered with soil on “at least a weekly basis,”
and certainly right before a hurricane, preventing the waste from being
kicked up. “Aerodynamically, [the storm is] rolling over that covered
waste. It’s not able to blow six inches of cover soil from the top of
the waste.”
</p>
<p>
But just because a landfill won’t turn into a mass of airborne dirt and
half-decomposed projectiles doesn’t mean there’s nothing to worry about.
Because landfills — especially large ones — often contain more advanced
infrastructure such as gas collection systems, which prevent methane
from being vented into the atmosphere, and drainage systems, which
collect contaminated liquid that’s pooled at the bottom of the waste
pile and send it off for treatment. Meyers told me that getting these
systems back online after a storm if they’ve been damaged is “the most
critical part, from our standpoint.”
</p>
<p>
A flood-inundated gas collection system can mean more methane escaping
into the air, and storm-damaged drainage pipes can lead to waste liquids
leaking into the ground and potentially polluting water sources. The
latter was a
<a href="https://www.rd.usda.gov/newsroom/news-release/usda-rural-development-awards-municipality-juncos-grant-23693000-repair-landfill" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>major
concern in Puerto Rico</u></a> after Hurricane Maria destroyed a
landfill’s waste liquid collection system in the Municipality of Juncos
in 2017.
</p>
<p>
As for methane, calculating exactly how much could be released as a
result of a dysfunctional landfill gas collection system requires
accounting for myriad factors such as the composition of the waste and
the climate that it’s in, but the back of the envelope calculations
don’t look promising. The
<a href="https://ghgdata.epa.gov/ghgp/service/facilityDetail/2022?id=1003560&ds=E&et=&popup=true" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Southeast
County Landfill near Tampa</u></a>, for instance, emitted about 100,000
metric tons of CO2 equivalent in 2022, according to the Environmental
Protection Agency (although a Harvard engineering study from earlier
this year suggests that this may be a
<a href="https://seas.harvard.edu/news/2024/05/epa-underestimates-methane-emissions-landfills-urban-areas#:~:text=Research%20highlights%20importance%20of%20high%2Dresolution%20methane%20accounting&text=The%20Environmental%20Protection%20Agency%20(EPA,27%25%20higher%20than%20EPA%20estimates" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>significant
underestimate</u></a>). The EPA estimates that gas collection systems
are about 75% effective, which means that the landfill generates a total
of about 400,000 metric tons of CO2-worth of methane. If Southeast
County Landfill’s gas collection system were to go down completely for
even a day, that would mean extra methane emissions of roughly 822
metric tons of CO2 equivalent. That difference amounts to the daily
emissions of more than 65,000 cars.
</p>
<p>
That’s a lot of math. But the takeaway is: Big landfills in the pathway
of a destructive storm could end up spewing a lot of methane into the
atmosphere. And keep in mind that these numbers are just for
<em><em>one</em></em> hypothetical landfill with a gas collection system
that goes down for <em><em>one</em></em> day. The emissions numbers, you
can imagine, start to look much worse if you consider the possibility
that floodwaters could impede access to infrastructure for even longer.
</p>
<p>
So stay strong out there, landfills of Florida. You may not be the star
of this show, but you’ve got our attention.

<h2 id="hurricane-disinformation-leads-to-danger-experts-say">Hurricane
disinformation leads to danger, experts say</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Disinformation and conspiracy theories have spread
quickly in response to natural disasters in the southeastern United
States, creating distrust in the government response, according to the
head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.</p>
<p>“It is absolutely the worst I have ever seen,” FEMA Administrator
Deanne Criswell told reporters on a Tuesday call.</p>
<p>The spread of lies surrounding the natural disasters comes at a time
when social media infrastructure will allow “virtually any claim” to
amplify and spread, experts say.</p>
<p>Hurricane Helene left more than 200 people dead and many more injured
or without power, and Hurricane Milton has left at least four dead after
ravaging Florida, according to the Associated Press.</p>
<p>Some frequently spread falsehoods include accusations that FEMA
prevented Florida evacuations and claims that funding for storm victims
was instead given to undocumented migrants.</p>
<p>Such misinformation is “demoralizing” to first responders, Criswell
said in the press call.</p>
<p>Additionally, the fabrications could put first responders and
residents of impacted areas in even more danger, according to Matthew
Baum, a Harvard University professor who focuses on fake news and
misinformation.</p>
<p>“When you’re talking about life-and-death situations,
[misinformation] can cause people not to take advantage of help that’s
available to them, and it can also be dangerous for first responders who
are being accused of all sorts of badness,” Baum told VOA. “And if first
responders start to worry about their own safety, that’s going to
undermine how they do their jobs.”</p>
<p>Many of the other falsehoods stem from former President Donald
Trump’s campaign and allies.</p>
<p>In an October 3 rally, the former president falsely claimed that the
Biden-Harris administration was diverting FEMA funding to house illegal
migrants.</p>
<p>Last week, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican from
Georgia, claimed that “they control the weather” in a post on social
media platform X, formerly Twitter. She did not specify who “they”
are.</p>
<p>To combat popular conspiracies surrounding hurricane relief efforts,
FEMA launched a “Hurricane Rumor Response” webpage to “help correct
rumors and provide accurate information,” according to a press
release.</p>
<p>Baum, however, told VOA that those who believe the false claims may
not be swayed by the government-funded website, as they are already
“deep down the rabbit hole of conspiratorial thinking.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think the website will have a significant effect, but it’s
still worth doing because journalists read it and having that
information out there gets it into the news ecosystem,” Baum said. “But
fundamentally, it’s not likely to reach many of the people that are at
risk of being harmed by this disinformation.”</p>
<p>FEMA put up a similar rumor response webpage during the 2020
coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>On social media platforms such as X, misinformation tends to spread
faster than true stories, a 2018 MIT study found. False news stories are
70% more likely to be reposted than true ones are.</p>
<p>Media scholar Matt Jordan told VOA the vast amount of disinformation
circulating is part of a “firehose of falsehood” strategy, in which bad
actors publish so much “garbage” that people don’t know what to
believe.</p>
<p>“It’s a way of eliminating the capacity for the press to help
generate democratic consensus by just putting so much garbage into the
zone,” the Penn State professor said.</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden said during a Tuesday morning briefing that
this misinformation “misleads” the public.</p>
<p>“It’s un-American, it really is,” he said in his remarks. “People are
scared to death; people know their lives are at stake.”</p>

id="blinken-builds-ties-with-thailand-malaysia-after-turbulence">Blinken
builds ties with Thailand, Malaysia after turbulence</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>VIENTIANE, LAOS — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken voiced hope
Thursday for cooperation with Thailand and Malaysia after recent
turbulence as he met their prime ministers at an Asia summit.</p>
<p>In a shift of focus after exhaustive diplomacy on the Middle East
crisis, Blinken is representing the United States in Laos at the annual
East Asia Summit, which President Joe Biden is skipping for the second
straight year.</p>
<p>Blinken met Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra, the
38-year-old heir of a political dynasty who took over a month ago after
her predecessor was ousted and the main opposition party dissolved.</p>
<p>Blinken said the United States hoped to work with Shinawatra to
“focus on things that we can do to better the lives of our people,”
including on the economy, security and climate change.</p>
<p>“The two countries have such an extraordinary history together, and
we simply want to build on it,” Blinken told her.</p>
<p>Shinawatra told Blinken of northern Thailand’s recent deadly floods
and voiced support for long-term relations with the United States.</p>
<p>Thailand is the oldest U.S. ally in Asia, but Washington has
repeatedly criticized its record on democracy, although usually
gently.</p>
<p>The State Department voiced alarm in August after a Thai court
dissolved the reformist Move Forward Party and banned from politics the
kingdom’s most popular politician, Pita Limjaroenrat.</p>
<p>Blinken, wearing a dark blue, traditional Laotian jacket, later met
separately with Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who has been a
vocal critic of U.S. support for Israel.</p>
<p>Neither mentioned the Middle East in brief remarks in the presence of
reporters, with Blinken instead noting that the United States is the top
foreign investor in Malaysia.</p>
<p>“I think this is a tremendous sign of both trust and confidence,
because the investments don’t happen unless there’s tremendous
confidence in the country,” Blinken told Anwar.</p>
<p>U.S. officials privately say that they understand the political
pressure in the Muslim-majority country and that they seek a cooperative
relationship with Anwar, who enjoyed strong advocacy from Washington
when he was controversially imprisoned.</p>
<p>Thailand has taken a lead at the Laos summit in seeking diplomatic
progress on the crisis engulfing its neighbor Myanmar, whose military
junta sent a representative to a top-level Southeast Asian gathering for
the first time in more than three years.</p>
<p>The United States, while backing diplomatic efforts, said it would
press for sustained pressure on the junta, seeing no progress on key
concerns such as freeing political prisoners and reducing violence.</p>
<p>Blinken, who met two weeks ago with his Chinese counterpart in New
York, will also back efforts by Southeast Asia to raise concerns with
Beijing about its actions in the South China Sea.</p>
<p>The summit marks a rare occasion in which Blinken is in the same room
as Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, but no talks between the two
are expected.</p>
<p>The Biden administration, including presidential nominee Vice
President Kamala Harris, has ruled out talks with Russia on its invasion
of Ukraine without involving Kyiv.</p>

Kennedy, social activist and widow of Robert F. Kennedy, dies at 96</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Boston, Massachusetts — Ethel Kennedy, the widow of Sen. Robert F.
Kennedy who raised their 11 children after he was assassinated and
remained dedicated to social causes and the family’s legacy for decades
thereafter, died on Thursday, her family said. She was 96.</p>
<p>Kennedy had been hospitalized after suffering a stroke in her sleep
on Oct. 3, her family said.</p>
<p>“It is with our hearts full of love that we announce the passing of
our amazing grandmother,” Joe Kennedy III posted on X. “She died this
morning from complications related to a stroke suffered last week.”</p>
<p>“Along with a lifetime’s work in social justice and human rights, our
mother leaves behind nine children, 34 grandchildren and 24 great-great
grandchildren along with numerous nieces and nephews, all of whom love
her dearly,” the family statement said.</p>
<p>The Kennedy matriarch, whose children were Kathleen, Joseph II,
Robert Jr., David, Courtney, Michael, Kerry, Christopher, Max, Douglas
and Rory, was one of the last remaining members of a generation that
included President John F. Kennedy. Her family said she had recently
enjoyed seeing many of her relatives, before falling ill.</p>
<p>A millionaire’s daughter who married the future senator and attorney
general in 1950, Ethel Kennedy had endured more death by the age of 40,
for the whole world to see, than most would in a lifetime.</p>
<p>She was by Robert F. Kennedy’s side when he was fatally shot in the
kitchen of the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles on June 5, 1968, just
after winning the Democratic presidential primary in California. Her
brother-in-law, President John F. Kennedy, had been assassinated in
Dallas less than five years earlier.</p>
<p>Her parents were killed in a plane crash in 1955, and her brother
died in a 1966 crash. Her son David Kennedy later died of a drug
overdose, son Michael Kennedy in a skiing accident and nephew John F.
Kennedy Jr. in a plane crash. Another nephew, Michael Skakel, was found
guilty of murder in 2002, although a judge in 2013 ordered a new trial
and the Connecticut Supreme Court vacated his conviction in 2018.</p>
<p>In 2019, she was grieving again after granddaughter Saoirse Kennedy
Hill died of an apparent drug overdose.</p>
<p>“One wonders how much this family must be expected to absorb,” family
friend Philip Johnson, founder of the Robert F. Kennedy Foundation, told
the Boston Herald after Michael Kennedy’s death.</p>
<p>Ethel Kennedy sustained herself through her faith and devotion to
family.</p>
<p>“She was a devout Catholic and a daily communicant, and we are
comforted in knowing she is reunited with the love of her life, our
father, Robert. F. Kennedy; her children David and Michael; her
daughter-in-law Mary; her grandchildren Maeve and Saorise and her
great-grandchildren Gideon and Josie. Please keep our mother in your
hearts and prayers,” the family statement said.</p>
<p>Ethel’s mother-in-law, Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy, initially worried
about how she would handle so much tragedy.</p>
<p>“I knew how difficult it was going to be for her to raise that big
family without the guiding role and influence that Bobby would have
provided,” Rose recalled in her memoir, “Times to Remember.” “And, of
course, she realized this too, fully and keenly. Yet she did not give
way.”</p>
<p>She founded the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights
soon after husband’s death and advocated for causes including gun
control and human rights. She rarely spoke about her husband’s
assassination. When her filmmaker daughter, Rory, brought it up in the
2012 HBO documentary, “Ethel,” she couldn’t share her grief.</p>
<p>“When we lost Daddy …” she began, then teared up and asked that her
youngest daughter “talk about something else.”</p>
<p>Presidential Medal of Freedom</p>
<p>In 2008, she joined brother-in-law Ted Kennedy and niece Caroline
Kennedy in endorsing Sen. Barack Obama for president, likening him to
her late husband. She made several trips to the White House during the
Obama years, receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2014 and
meeting Pope Francis in 2015.</p>
<p>Many of her progeny became well known. Daughter Kathleen became
lieutenant governor of Maryland; Joseph represented Massachusetts in
Congress; Courtney married Paul Hill, who had been wrongfully convicted
of an IRA bombing; Kerry became a human rights activist and president of
the RFK center; Christopher ran for governor of Illinois; Max served as
a prosecutor in Philadelphia and Douglas reported for Fox News
Channel.</p>
<p>Her son Robert F. Kennedy Jr., also became a national figure,
although not as a liberal in the family tradition. First known as an
environmental lawyer, he evolved into a conspiracy theorist who spread
false theories about vaccines. He ran for president as an independent
after briefly challenging President Joe Biden, and his name remained on
ballots in multiple states after he suspended his campaign and endorsed
Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Ethel Kennedy did not comment publicly on her son’s actions, although
several other family members denounced him.</p>
<p>Decades earlier, she seemed to thrive on her in-laws’ rising power.
She was an enthusiastic backer of JFK’s 1960 run and during the Kennedy
administration hosted some of the era’s most well-attended parties at
their Hickory Hill estate in McLean, Virginia, including one where
historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. was pushed fully clothed into the
swimming pool. In the Kennedy spirit, she also was known as an avid and
highly competitive tennis player and a compulsive planner.</p>
<p>“Petite and peppy Ethel, who doesn’t look one bit the outdoorsy type,
considers outdoor activity so important for the children that she has
arranged her busy Cabinet-wife schedule so she can personally take them
on two daily outings,” The Washington Post reported in 1962.</p>
<p>In February of that year, she accompanied her husband on a
round-the-world goodwill tour, stopping in Japan, Hong Kong, Italy and
other countries. She said it was important for Americans to meet
ordinary people overseas.</p>
<p>“People have a distinct liking for Americans,” she told the Post.
“But the Communists have been so vocal, it was a surprise for some
Asians to hear America’s point of view. It is good for Americans to
travel and get our viewpoint across.”</p>
<p>Kennedy was born Ethel Skakel on April 11, 1928, in Chicago, the
sixth of seven children of coal magnate George Skakel and Ann Brannack
Skakel, a devout Roman Catholic. She grew up in a 31-room English
country manor house in Greenwich, Connecticut, and attended Greenwich
Academy before graduating from the Convent of the Sacred Heart in the
Bronx in 1945.</p>
<p>She met Robert Kennedy through his sister Jean, her roommate at
Manhattanville College in New York. They moved to Charlottesville,
Virginia, where he finished his last year of law school at the
University of Virginia, and then in 1957, they bought Hickory Hill from
by John and Jacqueline Kennedy, who had bought it in 1953.</p>
<p>Robert Kennedy became chief counsel to the Senate Select Committee in
1957. He later was appointed attorney general by his brother, the newly
elected President Kennedy.</p>
<p>She had supported her husband in his successful 1964 campaign for the
U.S. Senate in New York and his subsequent presidential bid. Pregnant
with their 11th child when he was gunned down by Sirhan Sirhan, her look
of shock and horror was captured by photographers in images that
remained indelible decades later.</p>
<p>The assassination traumatized the family, especially son David
Kennedy, who watched the news in a hotel room. He was just days before
his 13th birthday and never recovered, struggling with addiction
problems for years and overdosing in 1984.</p>
<p>In 2021, she said Sirhan Sirhan should not be released from prison, a
view not shared by some others in her family. Two years later, a
California panel denied him parole.</p>
<p>Although Ethel Kennedy was linked to several men after her husband’s
death, most notably singer Andy Williams, she never remarried.</p>
<p>In April 2008, Ethel Kennedy visited Indianapolis on the 40th
anniversary of the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. A
monument there commemorated King’s death and the speech her husband had
given that night in 1968, which was credited with averting rioting in
the city.</p>
<p>“Of all the Kennedy women, she was the one I would end up admiring
the most,” Harry Belafonte would write of her. “She wasn’t playacting.
She looked at you and immediately got what you were about. Often in the
coming years, when Bobby was balking at something we wanted him to do
for the movement, I’d take my case to Ethel. ‘We have to talk to him,’
she’d say, and she would.”</p>
<p>Ethel Kennedy joined President Obama and former President Bill
Clinton — each held one of her hands — as they climbed stairs to lay a
wreath at President Kennedy’s gravesite during a November 2013
observance of the 50th anniversary of JFK’s death.</p>
<p>The nonprofit center she founded remains dedicated to advancing human
rights through litigation, advocacy, education and inspiration, giving
annual awards to journalists, authors and others who have made
significant contributions to human rights.</p>
<p>She also was active in the Coalition of Gun Control, Special
Olympics, and the Earth Conservation Corps. And she showed up in person,
participating in a 2016 demonstration in support of higher pay for
farmworkers in Florida and a 2018 hunger strike against the Trump
administration’s immigration policies.</p>
<p>Hickory Hill was sold in 2009 for $8.25 million, and Ethel Kennedy
divided her time between homes in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, and Palm
Beach, Florida.</p>

id="us-inflation-reaches-lowest-point-since-february-2021-though-price-pressures-remain">US
inflation reaches lowest point since February 2021, though price
pressures remain</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Inflation in the United States dropped last month to its
lowest point since it first began surging more than three years ago,
adding to a spate of encouraging economic news in the closing weeks of
the presidential race. </p>
<p>Consumer prices rose 2.4% in September from a year earlier, down from
2.5% in August, and the smallest annual rise since February 2021.
Measured from month to month, prices increased 0.2% from August to
September, the Labor Department reported Thursday, the same as in the
previous month. </p>
<p>But excluding volatile food and energy costs, “core” prices, a gauge
of underlying inflation, remained elevated in September, driven higher
by rising costs for medical care, clothing, auto insurance and airline
fares. Core prices in September were up 3.3% from a year earlier and
0.3% from August. Economists closely watch core prices, which typically
provide a better hint of future inflation. </p>
<p>Taken as a whole, the September figures show that inflation is
steadily easing back to the Fed’s 2% target, even if in a gradual and
uneven pattern. Apartment rental costs grew more slowly last month, a
sign that housing inflation is finally cooling, a long-awaited
development that would provide relief to many consumers. </p>
<p>Overall inflation last month was held down by a big drop in gas
prices, which fell 4.1% from August to September. Grocery prices jumped
0.4% last month, after roughly a year of mild increases, though they’re
1.3% higher than a year earlier. </p>
<p>Restaurant food prices increased 0.3% last month and are up 3.9% in
the past year. And clothing prices rose 1.1% from August to September
and are up 1.8% from a year ago. </p>
<p>The improving inflation picture follows a mostly healthy jobs report
released last week, which showed that hiring accelerated in September
and that the unemployment rate dropped from 4.2% to 4.1%. The government
has also reported that the economy expanded at a solid 3% annual rate in
the April-June quarter. Growth likely continued at roughly that pace in
the just-completed July-September quarter. </p>
<p>Cooling inflation, solid hiring and healthy growth could erode former
President Donald Trump’s advantage on the economy in the presidential
campaign as measured by public opinion polls. In some surveys, Vice
President Kamala Harris has pulled even with Trump on the issue of who
would best handle the economy, after Trump had decisively led President
Joe Biden on the issue. </p>
<p>At the same time, most voters still give the economy relatively poor
marks, mostly because of the cumulative rise in prices over the past
three years. </p>
<p>For the Fed, last week’s much-stronger-than-expected jobs report
fueled some concern that the economy might not be cooling enough to slow
inflation sufficiently. The central bank reduced its key rate by an
outsized half-point last month, its first rate cut of any size in four
years. The Fed’s policymakers also signaled that they envisioned two
additional quarter-point rate cuts in November and December. </p>
<p>In remarks this week, a slew of Fed officials have said they’re still
willing to keep cutting their key rate but at a deliberate pace, a
signal that any further half-point cuts are unlikely. </p>
<p>The Fed “should not rush to reduce” its benchmark rate “but rather
should proceed gradually,” Lorie Logan, president of the Federal
Reserve’s Dallas branch, said in a speech Wednesday. </p>
<p>Inflation in the United States and many countries in Europe and Latin
America surged in the economic recovery from the pandemic, as COVID
closed factories and clogged supply chains. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine
worsened energy and food shortages, pushing inflation higher. It peaked
at 9.1% in the U.S. in June 2022. </p>
<p>Economists at Goldman Sachs projected earlier this week that core
inflation will drop to 3% by December 2024. And few analysts expect
inflation to surge again unless conflicts in the Middle East worsen
dramatically. </p>
<p>Though higher prices have soured many Americans on the economy, wages
and incomes are now rising faster than costs and should make it easier
for households to adapt. Last month, the Census Bureau reported that
inflation-adjusted median household incomes — the level at which half of
households are above and half below — rose 4% in 2023, enough to return
incomes back to their pre-pandemic peak. </p>
<p>In response to higher food prices, many consumers have shifted their
spending from name brands to private labels or have started shopping
more at discount stores. Those changes have put more pressure on
packaged foods companies, for example, to slow their price hikes. </p>
<p>This week, PepsiCo reported that its sales volumes fell after it
imposed steep price increases on its drinks and snacks.</p>

Latin America, which is home to some of the most biodiverse regions in

the greatest decline at 85%. There are some success stories, such as a
3% increase in the mountain gorilla population, and the incredible

The head of the International Maritime Organization this week called on

Shipping accounts for about 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions. The
IMO recently set a new industry-wide target of a 20% emissions reduction
by 2030, and net-zero by 2050. But the IMO’s Arsenio Dominguez said
there is more to be done to hit these goals. That includes “low hanging
fruit” like reducing ship speed, charting routes according to the
weather, and cleaning the hulls of ships to reduce friction, <em><em>The
