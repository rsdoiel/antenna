## California Storm Causes $11 Billion in Damage

date: 2024-02-06, from: Heatmap News

California storm causes $11 billion in damage</h3><p>The storm that dropped huge amounts of rain on Southern California Sunday and Monday caused at least $11 billion in damages and economic losses, according to Accuweather. Dangerous winds, flooding, and landslides pummeled the region, hitting Los Angeles and its surrounding neighborhoods particularly hard. The University of California at Los Angeles recorded an incredible 12 inches of rain over 24 hours. Landslides swept through high-income communities including Beverly Hills, burying cars and forcing residents to evacuate. <em>Bloomberg</em> <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=c165716566&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">noted</a> that insurance policies rarely cover damages from floods or mudslides. President Biden has promised to provide federal aid.</p><h3>2. Researchers say world already surpassed 1.5 degrees in warming</h3><p>A new <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=35002dfdd7&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">study</a> suggests the planet has already warmed by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. In fact, the researchers say humans have raised the global temperature by 1.7 degrees Celsius, or about 3.1 degrees Fahrenheit. Much of the scientific community puts current warming at about 1.2 degrees Celsius, so this new calculation has climate experts in a tizzy.<br/><br/>The research hinges on observations from six sea sponges in the Caribbean Sea. These sponges are very old, and their skeletons contain what <em>The New York Times</em> <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=b7cba0c62f&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">calls</a> “chemical fingerprints” of the ocean temperatures going back to 1700, long before we started measuring in the 1850s. The findings suggest global warming began about 40 years earlier than previously thought, which means the preindustrial base line level to which we compare temperatures today is flawed. The authors say current warming is half a degree Celsius higher than the most common estimates.<br/><br/>Not everyone agrees. Some critics say data from a single location should not upend global temperature assessments. Others slam the authors for confusing the public. “It is the date of the reference period that matters rather than whether it is labelled pre-industrial or not,” <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=0545ef2454&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> Yadvinder Malhi FRS, professor of ecosystem science at the University of Oxford. “The period 1850-1900 is a period of relatively reliable global data when industrial era human-caused climate change was likely negligible.” Climate scientist Michael Mann <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=c51c0cd1e6&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> the research doesn’t “pass the smell test.”</p><h3>3. EU reportedly backs down on farming emissions cuts</h3><p>Farmers across the European Union have been protesting for weeks against a plan to curb greenhouse gas emissions from the agricultural sector, and it looks like their efforts paid off: A new plan for cutting the bloc’s emissions by 90% by 2040, set to be unveiled today, nixes the call for a 30% reduction in gases like methane and nitrogen, which are linked to farming, the <em>Financial Times </em><a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=1ca7a86678&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>. The conflict stems from farmers’ concerns that policymakers are ignoring them, and with European Parliament elections just a few months away, center-right politicians are trying to win over every vote they can. But there will be consequences: The agricultural sector is projected to be “the biggest emitter by 2040 unless the EU takes action,” <em>Bloomberg</em> <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=b4b866c9f8&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>. The uproar demonstrates the challenges politicians face in rolling out new green policies without losing support from key demographics.</p><h3>4.

## Why it’s important to turn on Apple’s new Stolen Device Protection

date: 2024-02-06, from: San Jose Mercury News

Apple has rolled out an update to its operating system this week with a feature called Stolen Device Protection. It makes it a lot harder for phone thieves to access key functions and settings, and users are being urged to turn it on immediately. The software update for iPhones and iPads addresses a vulnerability that thieves have discovered and exploited: allowing them to lock victims out of their Apple accounts, delete their photos and other files from their iCloud accounts and empty their bank accounts by accessing passwords kept in the Keychain password manager.

Negotiators were working on adding a border component to an urgent measure to fund aid to Ukraine, Israel, and Gaza, since extremist House Republicans said they would not pass such a measure until Congress also addressed what they insisted was a crisis at the U.S. border.

During years  I noticed a strange  phenomena: if I have  became used to something  then it  suddenly changes  or ceases  to exist.  The obvious examples are  the Psion PDA (they  decided to quit teh  PDA market just after I  bought the  Series 5),  the PowerPC at  the Apple  (well, they released the OS Tiger just  after I finally familiarised withthe Jaguar and they announced their switch to the  Intel just a feew weeks after I finally  decided to  get the  iMac), then  Palm (I  so much  wanted the WebPad!), the  Linux version of the  Intel Compute stick or  the nVidia Shield tablets (I'm sorry but I had two).

## CoraQuest

<p><a href="https://www.coraquest.com/">CoraQuest</a> is a “family cooperative dungeon crawler” created by adorable dad-daughter duo Dan and Cora Hughes from Huddersfield, UK. Feeling the boredom of pandemic lockdown, Dan and Cora (8yo) decided to design a board game and <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cabbagedan/coraquest/description">put it on Kickstarter</a>. I’ve wanted an easy “Dungeons and Dragons for Kids” game for a long time and this hits all the marks. It’s imaginative, tactile, visual, and it has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzLi8IWmLKU">a simple ruleset</a> that kids can easily grok. I backed it the minute I saw it.</p>
<p>CoraQuest comes with ~9 or so premade adventures so parents can run a one-shot without much preparation. The dungeon is a stack of 9x9 tiles with special story cards mixed in that map to story beats in the premade adventure. I embellish a bit and give the bad guys names like “Gerald” and “Geoffrey”. Add some funny voices and it’s a guaranteed good time for kids. My son and his friends played for two hours the other day and the kids didn’t even think about devices. That is worth the price of admission alone.</p>
<p>There’s other aspects that make this game great like how you can upload drawings to <a href="https://www.coraquest.com/cc/creator.html">design your own heroes and enemies</a>, there’s <a href="https://www.coraquest.com/hoodez-hidden-door/">narrated quests</a> to offload that responsibility, but to me the best part is my kids love it and ask for it. The infectious laughter of Dan and Cora has infected our house and young Cora is a role model that I often point to and tell my kids they can make a cool game everyone loves if you set your mind to it. I love the game so much I’ve <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cabbagedan/coraquest-keep-on-questing-expansion/description">bought the expansion</a> as well as a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CK9WNG57">short story book</a> that takes place in the CoraQuest fantasy universe.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a game to play with your kids and their friends, I highly recommend CoraQuest.</p>

<p>The <strong>CloudNativePG Community</strong> The CloudNativePG Community is excited to
announce a new update for the *<em>CloudNativePG Operator</em>, now available for the
supported 1.22, 1.21, and 1.20 versions.</p>
<p>Key enhancements in all supported minor releases are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Customize ephemeral volume storage for a PostgreSQL cluster using a claim
  template</li>
<li>Introduce the <code>pgadmin4</code> command in the <code>cnpg</code> plugin for <code>kubectl</code> to
  swiftly set up a demonstration-only interface for PgAdmin4. This is the most

  Postgres Cluster</li>
<li>Add support for PostgreSQL's ident map file configuration</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Versions 1.22.1, 1.21.3 and 1.20.6</strong> are <em>patch releases</em> that include
essential bug fixes, addressing issues such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prevention of an unrecoverable problem with <code>pg_rewind</code> caused by
  <code>postgresql.auto.conf</code> being read-only due to the disabled alter system
  option</li>
<li>Reduction of the risk of disk space shortage when using the import facility
  of the <code>initdb</code> bootstrap method</li>
</ul>
<p>With this update, version 1.20 has reached End-of-Life (EOL). Version 1.20.6

## Opposition to Senate Border Bill Jeopardizes Help for Afghans Who Aided US Troops

date: 2024-02-05, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON  — The massive $118 billion Senate border bill not only contains once-in-a-decade border security legislation and wartime aid to Israel and Ukraine, but also offers a chance for the U.S. to keep its promise to Afghans who worked alongside U.S. soldiers in America's longest war. 


Tucked inside the sprawling package is a measure that would provide a long-awaited pathway to residency for tens of thousands of Afghan refugees who arrived in the U.S. on military planes after the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021. 


But the measure may fail if members can't agree on the bill's larger, unrelated provisions. Democrats, especially members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, have voiced opposition for what they call the extreme, far-right border policies in the legislation that they say do nothing to help fix the country's broken immigration system. 


Conservatives have said the package does not go far enough in limiting the number of daily migrant crossings at the southern border. 


If it fails, it will represent yet another disappointment for the more than 76,000 Afghans currently living in the U.S. who remain in immigration limbo as a result of years of congressional inaction. 


A small group of bipartisan lawmakers and advocacy groups have worked for nearly three years to get a House or Senate vote on a standalone bill, the Afghan Adjustment Act, that would prevent Afghans from becoming stranded without legal residency status when their humanitarian parole expires. But advocates have repeatedly faced strong opposition from some Republican lawmakers to vetting requirements for the refugees who were brought here and their family members still stranded in Kabul. 


The bipartisan border deal offered a long-awaited breakthrough. Both Republican and Democratic senators and their staff worked to bridge the divide and produce legislative text that both sides could support. The new proposal would couple measures enabling qualified Afghans to eventually apply for U.S. citizenship, as was done for refugees in the past, including those from Cuba, Vietnam and Iraq, with stricter and more expedited vetting processes. 


"I think the most gracious thing would be to say there's been a lot of twists and turns, but I'm very happy with the result," Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, one of the lead sponsors of the effort, told The Associated Press on Monday. "And I'm very glad that it's included because this is an important signal that the United States stands by those who stand by us." 


The U.S. government admitted the refugees on a temporary parole status as part of Operation Allies Welcome, the largest resettlement effort in the country in decades, with the promise of a pathway to life in the U.S. for their service. 


"Our position is that Afghans stood by us for 20 years and over the past three years, they've been asked to take a backseat to every other bill," said Shawn VanDiver, a Navy veteran and head of #AfghanEvac, a coalition supporting Afghan resettlement efforts. "And so it is really nice to see that they're included in this one." 


But hopes for fulfilling that promise to longtime allies of America's mission in Kabul could be short-lived. Republican leaders in the House have declared the bill a non-starter, and even passage through the Senate, where the deal was negotiated, is an uphill climb. 


As proponents of the Afghan provision await the fate of the package, they are trying to remain cautiously optimistic that their campaign is making headway. 


VanDiver, who has worked with the State Department on this issue since the U.S. withdrawal, said he has heard a lot of excitement from Afghan allies and their family members in the last 12 hours about the inclusion in the package. 


"The worst part about it is that it is now on us to manage expectations," he said. "These folks have already been through so much and it's frankly embarrassing that we can't figure out how to give them the permanency that they've earned."

## Well-known secrets of AmigaDOS

date: 2024-02-05, from: OS News

In keeping with the Commodore tradition of cost cutting, most consumer models of their Amiga line of computers came with severely watered down documentation. The Amiga 500 was an exception from this rule, but owners of later machines &#8211; such as the A1200 &#8211; may not have gotten any documentation for the command line part of AmigaOS at all. And, of course, even if this documentation had shipped with the machines, it wouldn&#8217;t have revealed features that were hidden to anyone without access to official developer documentation or even left completely undocumented or unfinished. This is a quick look at a few of these interesting features, some more obscure than others, but all of them decidedly useful. Most of them only apply to versions 2.x and/or 3.x of the OS. With that said, let&#8217;s dive right in! ↫ Carl Svensson Exactly what it says on the tin.

## Microsoft sneaks ads into the new Outlook for Windows

date: 2024-02-05, from: OS News

The migration from the classic Mail and Calendar app to the new Outlook app is in full swing already. Microsoft announced the deprecation of the classic apps in favor of a new Outlook app in June 2023. It introduced the new Outlook app to Insider builds a month later and announced that it would enforce the migration in early 2024. Not all users are migrated at this point. Those who have been migrated already or installed the Outlook app directly, may notice several differences between the new Outlook app and the classic Mail app. One of the main differences turns an ad-free email experience into one with ads. You may see ads in the inbox in the new Outlook. ↫ Martin Brinkmann Ads disguised as emails in your inbox. Microsoft will not rest until Windows resembles Times Square.

## Thoughts on a Global Design System

date: 2024-02-05, from: Chris Coyier blog

Dave and I just had Brad on ShopTalk Show to talk about his idea for a Global Design System. I love Brad&#8217;s optimism on all this. From Brad&#8217;s perspective, he&#8217;s seen, and helped build, the same set of components over and over over (and over) for design systems. On a very professional level! While design [&#8230;]

## US to Impose Visa Limits on Spyware Abusers Targeting Journalists, Activists

date: 2024-02-05, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The Biden administration announced Monday it is rolling out a new policy that will allow it to impose visa restrictions on foreign individuals involved in the misuse of commercial spyware.


The administration's policy will apply to people who’ve been involved in the misuse of commercial spyware to target individuals including journalists, activists, perceived dissidents, members of marginalized communities, or the family members of those who are targeted. The visa restrictions could also apply to people who facilitate or get financial benefit from the misuse of commercial spyware, officials said.


“The United States remains concerned with the growing misuse of commercial spyware around the world to facilitate repression, restrict the free flow of information, and enable human rights abuses,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement


announcing the new policy. “The misuse of commercial spyware threatens privacy and freedoms of expression, peaceful assembly, and association. Such targeting has been linked to arbitrary detentions, forced disappearances, and extrajudicial killings in the most egregious of cases.”




Biden issued an executive order nearly a year ago restricting the U.S. government's use of commercial spyware “that poses risks to national security."


That order required the head of any U.S. agency using commercial programs to certify that they don't pose a significant counterintelligence or other security risk, a senior administration official said. It was issued as the White House acknowledged a surge in hacks of U.S. government employees, across 10 countries, that had been compromised or targeted by commercial spyware.


A senior administration official who briefed reporters ahead of Monday's announcement would not say if any particular individuals were in line to immediately be impacted by the visa restrictions. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the White House.


Officials said the visa restriction policy can apply to citizens of any country found to have misused or facilitated the malign use of spyware, even if they are from countries whose citizens are allowed entry into the U.S. without first applying for a visa.




Perhaps the best-known example of spyware, the Pegasus software from Israel’s NSO Group, was used to target more than 1,000 people across 50 countries, according to security researchers and a July 2021 global media investigation, citing a list of more than 50,000 cellphone numbers.


The U.S. has already placed export limits on NSO Group, restricting the company’s access to U.S. components and technology.


Pegasus spyware was used in Jordan to hack the cellphones of at least 30 people, including journalists, lawyers, human rights and political activists, the digital rights group Access Now announced last week.


The hacking with spyware made by Israel’s NSO Group occurred from 2019 until last September, according to Access Now. It did not accuse Jordan’s government of the hacking.


Amnesty International also reported that its forensic researchers had determined that Pegasus spyware was installed on the phone of The Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi’s fiancée, Hatice Cengiz, just four days after he was killed in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul in 2018. The company had previously been implicated in other spying on Khashoggi.

## Iran-Backed Militias Resume Attacks on US Positions

date: 2024-02-05, from: VOA News USA

Pentagon   — Iran-backed militias in Syria are again targeting the United States and its allies, launching at least three attacks on American positions following a U.S. bombardment aimed at disrupting the ability of the militias to pose a threat.


U.S. military officials told VOA the most recent attack came early Monday, when a single rocket was lobbed at U.S. and coalition forces at the Mission Support Site Euphrates base in eastern Syria. 


The official said there were no injuries or damage as a result of the attack.


But an earlier attack, targeting the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces on Sunday, did hit its mark. The official said a one-way attack drone hit the base at the Omar Oil Field, near Deir el-Zour, causing multiple SDF casualties. 


SDF spokesman Farhad Shami said on social media that the drone attack killed six SDF fighters. 




The SDF base is located near the U.S. position known as Green Village.


The U.S. also confirmed an attack by Iran-backed militias on Friday, when multiple rockets targeted Mission Support Site Euphrates base. No injuries or damage were reported.


The three latest attacks are the first since the U.S. unleashed a series of airstrikes that hit 85 targets at seven locations in Iraq and Syria late Friday, dropping more than 125 precision munitions in about half-an-hour.


U.S. officials have said Friday's strikes were aimed at disrupting the militia's logistical capabilities by striking targets "critical to their supply chain," including command-and-control centers, drone and missile storage sites, and other key facilities.


Washington has also warned more strikes are coming.


U.S. President Joe Biden "will do what he thinks needs to be done," White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told CNN's "State of the Union" Sunday, refusing to rule out strikes inside Iran itself.


"There will be additional action that we will take — all designed to put an end to these attacks," White House National Security Council spokesperson, John Kirby, told reporters following Friday's strikes.


Iranian officials have condemned the U.S. strikes, calling them a violation of Syrian and Iraqi sovereignty. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani further described the U.S. strikes as "a serious strategic mistake."


U.S. officials, so far, have declined to share estimates on how many militias members were killed in Friday's strikes, but Syrian opposition activists said at least 29 fighters were killed in Syria while Iraqi officials said at least 16 militia members were killed with another 36 wounded.


The renewed attacks by Iran-backed militias in Syria come as Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen continue to threaten international shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, despite a new wave of airstrikes Saturday by an international coalition led by the U.S. and Britain.


The U.S. military said it carried out a "self-defense" strike late Sunday against cruise missiles in an area of Yemen controlled by Houthi militants. 


U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), which oversees U.S. forces in the region, said the strike hit four anti-ship missiles that were being readied to launch at ships in the Red Sea.


CENTCOM said it also carried out self-defense strikes against a Houthi land attack cruise missile in a separate incident on Sunday.


Sunday's preemptive strikes come after the U.S. and Britain hit at least 36 Houthi targets in Yemen on Saturday.


The Houthis, though, said they will not be backing down.


"Military operations against Israel will continue until the crimes of genocide in Gaza are stopped and the siege on its residents is lifted, no matter the sacrifices it costs us," Mohammed al-Bukhaiti, a Houthi official, wrote on X. "American-British aggression against Yemen will not go unanswered, and we will meet escalation with escalation."    




Still, the White House has defended its approach to both the militias in Iraq and Syria and Yemen's Houthis, recently designated as a terror group.


"Each attack we undertake helps degrade capabilities" of the Iranian-backed militias in the region, the White House's Sullivan said Sunday. "The U.S. will step up when it's attacked," but at the same time make sure the U.S. is "not pulled into a war in the Middle East. We will defend our troops."

## T? and Optional<T> Are Not the Same in Swift

date: 2024-02-05, from: Michael Tsai

Nick Lockwood: I once again got bitten by the fact that T? properties in a Swift struct become optional parameters in the synthesized initializer, making it easy to accidentally omit a property that you meant to set.

## A holy communion

date: 2024-02-05, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>You and I are partaking in something magical.</p>
<p>The electric meat inside my cranium told my fingers to punch mechanical keys to send signals through an electric rock and encode these thoughts on a magnetic rock. Then through radio waves, beacons, and wires I create a copy of this magnetically encoded text on another rock in another town, in another state. That rock copies itself to another town (possibly in another country) closer to you. Then through another relay of wires and radio waves that text replicates itself on the electric rock in your palm. Your rock renders those words with light through stained glass. You read rendered words and glyphs and the electric meat in your own head decodes the text.</p>
<p>Our thoughts, words, and images transfigured through time and space as ones and zeroes. Circumnavigating the globe in milliseconds. An immaculate relay. A holy exchange.</p>
<p>That is powerful. It is precious. We would do well to preserve its sanctity.</p>

## How Google Maps Is (Subtly!) Trying to Persuade You to Make Better Choices

date: 2024-02-05, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTM2MTE5MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1NjQwODE4MH0.FEUtF_fCkDlUe04vkfX8nO2MV5778ZoAm2-jt7JP0u4/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">While browsing Google Flights for an escape from the <a href="https://heatmap.news/lifestyle/warm-winters-mental-health-depression" target="_self">winter doldrums</a>, I recently encountered a notification I hadn’t seen before. One particular return flight from Phoenix to New York was highlighted in light green as avoiding “as much CO2 as 1,400 trees absorb a day.”</p><p>I’d seen Google Flights’ emissions estimates before, of course — they’ve been around since 2021 — but this was the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/9/23825771/google-american-airlines-ai-flights-contrails-climate-change" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first time</a> I’d seen it translate a number like “265 kg CO2e” into something I could actually understand. Suddenly, <em>not</em> picking the flight felt like it would have made me, well, kind of bad.</p><p>Yael Maguire, the vice president and general manager of the sustainability team at Google Geo — which includes Maps, Earth, and <a href="https://sunroof.withgoogle.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Project Sunroof</a>, the company’s solar calculator — stressed that Google isn’t trying to take people’s agency away with these kinds of light-green guilt trips. “We want to make the sustainable choice the easy choice,” he told me, in reference to a slew of new tools the company has been rolling out, from fuel-efficient routing in Maps (which Google <a href="https://youtu.be/yv_C-0E2yL0?feature=shared&t=1003" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">estimates</a> has eliminated the emissions equivalent of 500,000 internal combustion cars from the road since 2021), to suggesting train routes to flight-shoppers, to nudging Europeans to ditch their cars when public transportation could get them to their destinations in a comparable amount of time.</p><p>Last week, I spoke to Maguire about the sustainability projects at Google Geo, including the team’s <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/solar/overview" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Solar API</a>, which provides solar-planning data for millions of buildings worldwide. Our conversation has been lightly condensed for clarity and brevity. </p><p><strong>Do you see your job at Google Geo as passively presenting sustainability information to users, or do you see it as actively nudging people toward making better choices for the planet?</strong></p><p>We’re not trying to take agency away from anybody. We want to make sure — whether you’re a consumer choosing an eco-friendly route, or you’re a developer who’s thinking about trying to build more sustainably, or you’re a solar developer who wants to help with that — we want the choices to be in their hands. But we want to make it the easiest choice possible because, while it’s ultimately their decision, it will lead to carbon reductions over time. </p><p><strong>That’s the idea behind fuel efficiency suggestions in Google Maps, where a route is prominently displayed with the little leaf, right?</strong></p><p>Exactly. We launched a capability in Google Earth last year to help real estate developers do high-level planning and building development to make the sustainable choice the easy choice. As they’re saying, “We’re trying to get this many units with these kinds of amenities, etc., etc.,” we give them the tools to optimize for all the things they want to optimize for. But we can also say, “Hey, if you also care about sustainability, you can use different materials, we can get more sunlight in the area, and you have this much potential for solar.” And that just comes bundled with the tool itself. </p><p>We always try to find the co-benefits. I know for me personally, I always try to make the sustainable choice as much as I can. But I know that other people may not be as motivated by that, and having those co-benefits — like, it saves money, or it saves time, or it saves fuel, whatever it might be. We want to try to bring those together as much as possible.</p><p><strong>When I was in Tbilisi, Georgia, a few months ago, I was using the ride-share app Bolt, and <a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/bolt-adds-zero-emission-no-cost-travel-option-walking" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">at the time</a> it had a feature where if you tried to book a car to a location less than a 15-minute walk away, it would suggest you walk instead. I saw in a <a href="https://youtu.be/yv_C-0E2yL0?feature=shared" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video</a> from Google’s sustainability summit last fall that you’re rolling out something similar in some locations in Europe — France was one. Do you find these sorts of rollouts in the U.S. are stymied at all by how un-walkable most American cities are?</strong> </p><p>We are trying to make the most of cities as they are. They’re hard to change. But one of the things I find really encouraging is there’s definitely a long timeframe for this. Mayors and the folks in their departments of transportation recognize that they have to make more options available for people to commute and move around. They’re not necessarily going to be able to change things overnight. But there are major changes that are happening — for example, in the city of London, we were able to announce <a href="https://pagely.traffictechnologytoday.com/news/safety/transport-for-london-and%E2%80%AFgoogle%E2%80%AFmaps-collaborate-to-make-cycling-safer-in-cities.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hundreds of miles of new bike lanes</a>. So a lot of changes are happening over a relatively short amount of time, too. </p><p>Sometimes it’s hard to know what is going to be the impact of those decisions, though. And so, again, with these tools, city planners have the opportunity to scenario plan and say, “Okay, we’re thinking of trying to put bike lanes in this corridor in the city, what is going to be the impact on carbon?” </p><p><strong>I wanted to ask a similar question in the context of a new feature that suggests train routes to Europeans looking for short-haul flights. How is Google thinking about promoting low-emissions transportation options like trains to Americans, eventually, when our infrastructure often isn’t there yet? Is this a challenge you talk about internally?</strong></p><p>It is definitely something that is top of mind. But I do think even in the U.S., there are times when taking a train is actually faster. There are actually a lot of instances where walking, cycling, and public transportation are the most effective ways to get somewhere — and that’s not even considering the cost side of it, which is also something people might want to consider. I’m actually fairly optimistic — when I worked in San Francisco, I took public transportation, and I tried to walk as much as I can in all the cities that I’ve lived in, so I feel like I have lived experience in what the reality [in the U.S.] is. And some of these alternative options can be very effective. There’s more work to do, though, to make sure that we’re doing this globally.</p><p><strong>Arguably, Google Maps could have a significant role to play in the success of the larger EV transition in terms of making charging stations and trip planning easy and handy for drivers. I’ve been working on planning my first EV road trip this summer and have been pretty intimidated, to be honest. Can you tell me what is in Google’s pipeline to help make this process easier for drivers?</strong></p><p>I can’t talk about things that haven’t been announced yet, but I will say that, just as an overarching goal, we want to make that as easy as possible. I’m an EV owner, I have been for a number of years, and I know sometimes it can be a cognitive task to think about, “How am I going to charge and what is that experience going to be like?” So I would just say that we are really aware and trying to deeply understand the problem as much as possible, and our goal is to really address it.</p><p>Even when someone is thinking about purchasing a car, oftentimes people go to Google Search to look for vehicles, and we can help people understand what the potential is of a particular vehicle they’re considering. What typically concerns people is a long-distance trip. So we’ve made a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/wheels/news/news-google-search-ev-shopping/#:~:text=Battery%20Range%20Explorer,and%20the%20fuel%20efficiency%2C%20MPGe." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tool</a> where you can plug in a familiar destination — like for me, I live in San Francisco, it might be going to Tahoe— and for a given car you can see how many charges would you have to do on the way. Being able to make that info a little bit easier for people to see before they even buy the car is a thing that we’ve tried to do. </p><p>We’re also trying to make charging experiences as positive as possible. The first thing is, honestly, just getting as many chargers on the map as possible. There are a number of different providers who have charging infrastructure and sometimes all the data isn’t widely available so we’ve tried really, really hard to work with those partners. We have information on, I believe, 360,000 chargers worldwide and we’re constantly trying to grow that. On top of that — and I hope you don’t experience this — but not all the chargers work. You’ve probably seen on Google Maps, there are reviews, right? So there’s all kinds of work happening there. </p><p>My EV doesn’t have Google Maps integrated, unfortunately, but I’m really looking forward to one day having this feature where I can search for a charger along the route. We’d like to get to that point where you don’t actually have to do all this planning in advance and you can just get in your car and plan along the way like you would if it was another type of vehicle. </p><p><strong>It’s one thing to have a tool like the <a href="https://insights.sustainability.google/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google Tree Canopy</a> available for cities and organizers, and it’s another thing for people to actually use that tool and act on the information. How are you measuring your success?</strong></p><p>We measure our success ultimately by what people do with our tools. So it’s not just about putting the tool out there. We actually try to understand what people are doing. In the case of what we did with eco-friendly routing, we worked with the <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/news/features/2023/nrel-innovations-help-consumers-invest-in-our-planet.html#:~:text=To%20help%20travelers%20decide%20on,that%20rolled%20out%20in%202022." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">National Renewable Energy Laboratory</a> in the U.S., for example, to help validate our carbon emissions model. We’re going through that process for everything we do, whether it’s Project Sunroof or the Solar API, or other things like that.</p><p><strong>You preempted my next question, but maybe you can talk about it in a more macro sense — Google has the <a href="https://blog.google/products/maps/google-maps-apis-environment-sustainability/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">goal</a> of “collectively reducing 1 gigaton of carbon equivalent emissions annually by 2030” with tools like Solar API. Can you give me any sort of progress update?</strong></p><p>This is a project that’s been going on for some time. We’ve been working with solar developers for a while, but we’ve been pleasantly surprised not only by the solar developer community engagement, but there’s actually other industries that have shown interest. So <a href="https://cloud.google.com/customers/myheat" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MyHEAT</a> — they’re not a typical solar installer, but they’re finding this data really useful to go to cities and help them with the plans that they have. </p><p>So the gigaton goal itself, there is nothing to share now other than the progress on eco-friendly routing, but it is something that we hope we’ll be able to share progress on over time. But so far, we’re quite happy.</p><p><strong>At a time when there’s a lot of nervousness around AI — and often for good reason — you’ve been pretty vocal in your excitement about how such tools can be used for the positive purposes of sustainability. Tell me why you’re an optimist.</strong></p><p>Here’s why I’m an optimist: Because it’s where I put all of Google’s public goals in context. We talked about the gigaton goal, we talked about the Solar API — but I think this is also a question about energy usage and carbon intensity. We will continue to invest in the infrastructure that we need — and we need that infrastructure to be able to actually help solve some of these problems, by providing information to people — but at the same time, the company has been really focused on trying to minimize the carbon intensity of the energy we produce. So, since 2017, we’ve been operating off of 100% renewable energy; this is on an annualized basis. We also have an initiative to use carbon-free energy — so the source of the energy that ultimately goes where electrons are going to our data centers, we’re actively measuring what percentage of that is carbon-free on a 24/7 basis.</p><p>With our net-zero commitments, to be on a net basis by 2030, that includes all of our AI infrastructure. That’s where I would try to separate the energy use that’s required to operate AI from the carbon intensity, which I think is very different. Our data centers, we estimate, are one-and-a-half times more efficient than your average data center. And with AI workloads themselves, in some instances, we’ve been able to get the energy usage down by 100x, and the corresponding amount of carbon intensity down by 1,000x. </p><p>But to your point, at the same time, it is very much on our minds that the carbon intensity to run all of these AI workloads — how does that compare to the benefits that they’re able to provide? I think that’s where I am. I do have a lot of optimism about the efficiency work, about the trajectory of carbon-free energy and net zero. The upsides in terms of what it does for solar, what it does for transportation — yeah, I am a big believer. </p><p>The big reason why I’m so excited about this opportunity in the Maps and Geo space is I just think there’s so much opportunity for all kinds of organizations, including individual citizens, to make these choices and changes to their environment. And I think the role that AI has is enormous — obviously not the whole thing, because it doesn’t build cycling lanes. People have to go do that. People have to change policies around how buildings are going to have less carbon intensity when they’re built. There’s tons and tons of other work that is required to actually build the future that we want, that is lower carbon intensity — ideally zero. But I do think that AI plays an enormous role as decision support for all those choices that are needed in the future. </p>

## Introducing Shift Key, a New Climate Podcast from Heatmap News

date: 2024-02-05, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTI3NTg2OC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2NTE2NTM0NX0.fukOiQoql4_Ns5cC1-Qm0frwpz9X9Qt0ugiwTthBkC8/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p>
	I have some exciting news this morning: Heatmap is launching its first podcast.
	<br/>
</p><p>
	It’s called Shift Key, and it’s hosted by me and Professor Jesse Jenkins, an expert on energy systems engineering at Princeton University.
</p><p>
	Here’s the idea of Shift Key: It’s going to be like listening in on a call between Jesse and me every week. We want to bring you the most interesting conversation about climate change and decarbonization that you’ll hear each week.
</p><p>
<strong>Follow us right now at 
	<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/shift-key-with-robinson-meyer-and-jesse-jenkins/id1728932037?i=1000643995810" target="_blank">Apple Podcasts</a> or on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/0war1dXXCEEZNpZ3H7kRid" target="_blank">Spotify</a>.</strong>
</p><p>
	You’ve almost certainly 
	<a href="https://heatmap.news/u/jessed-jenkins" target="_self">seen Jesse’s work on Heatmap</a> or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/20/podcasts/transcript-ezra-klein-interviews-jesse-jenkins.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">heard him on another podcast</a> before. He’s one of the country’s most important experts on decarbonization and his research helped inform the Inflation Reduction Act.
</p><p>
	And while you are probably familiar with 
	<a href="https://heatmap.news/u/robinsonmeyer" target="_self">my work here at Heatmap</a>, you may not know I’ve been covering climate change since 2015.
</p><p>
	The founding idea of Shift Key — and something that Jesse and I agree on — is that the energy transition and climate change are not niche topics, and they’re not something happening hypothetically in the future.
</p><p>
	Decarbonization and the shift away from fossil fuels are happening now — and it impacts everything from Main Street to Wall Street, from domestic politics to geopolitics. It is profoundly reordering the economy, public health, and consumer decisions.
</p><p>
	So subscribe to Shift Key now at 
	<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/shift-key-with-robinson-meyer-and-jesse-jenkins/id1728932037" target="_blank">Apple Podcasts</a> and listen to our teaser below. Our first episode will come out later this week.
</p><p>
	Thanks as always for your support — and thank you for listening.

<p>Barnes &#38; Noble stopped making its own Android tablets years ago, and has instead been partnering with third-party tablet makers like Samsung and Lenovo. So it&#8217;s unsurprising that the company&#8217;s newest tablet is the NOOK 9&#8243; Lenovo Tablet, or that it looks pretty familiar. That&#8217;s because it&#8217;s basically the same tablet as the Lenovo Tab [&#8230;]</p>

If you're creating something new, definitely create it on feedland.com. If you're already using feedland.org, for now you're welcome to continue, but in the back of your mind think about creating a new account on Com and importing your subscription list. Org is proving useful to have around, so I don't imagine it'll go away, it's much easier for me to work on a DO server than on the big cloud-based server.

feedland.org runs on a small <a href="https://cloud.digitalocean.com/droplets/new">Digital Ocean server</a>, and Com runs in a data center. The first is a fixed-size relatively small scale server that can't expand, and the latter is designed to scale automatically according to demand.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-02-05, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

BTW, while we're doing this transition in FeedLand, I also have a small crisis happening on my main static server, which depends on a combination of software that suddenly aren't getting along with each other. Obviously something changed. I'm running it in a somewhat crippled state, I may be figuring how to dig out of this hole. One of the downsides of having fun with server software.

More than 550,000 customers were <a href="https://poweroutage.us/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">without power</a> as of Monday morning. Here are some numbers that may help put this historic storm in context</p><ul>
<li>More than 11 million people in the state were at risk of “life-threatening flooding.”</li>
<li>States of emergency were issued in eight counties, covering some 20 million people.</li>
<li>The National Weather Service issued a hurricane force wind warning in San Francisco for the first time in decades.</li>

Paris votes to make SUV drivers pay more for parking</h3><p><strong></strong>Parisians <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/bike-friendly-paris-votes-raising-parking-fees-suvs-2024-02-03/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">voted</a> in favor of tripling parking fees for “bulky, polluting” SUVs to 18 euros ($19) per hour on Sunday. The fees won't apply to city residents or taxis but instead target out-of-towners. The new rule, which could come into place in September, is part of an ongoing effort to make the city’s streets friendlier for pedestrians and cyclists. It’s also an attempt to improve air quality, but hybrid and electric vehicles aren’t exempt: Combustion-engine and hybrid SUVs weighing more than 1.6 tons will be subject to the fee, and so will EVs over 2 tons. Last year, the city voted to get rid of e-scooters. “Parisians have made a clear choice … other cities will follow,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/04/parisians-vote-in-favour-of-tripling-parking-costs-for-suvs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo. While 54.5% of voters approved the measure, turnout was very low, at just 5.7%. </p><h3>3.

There may be ‘no right answer’ to LNG climate question </h3><p><strong></strong>Just how bad is liquified natural gas (LNG) for the climate? That's the question of the hour. President Biden recently paused new LNG export terminals until the Energy Department can provide some insight. But in the meantime, <em>Heatmap</em>’s Matthew Zeitlin did his own <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/lng-exports-pause-biden-emissions" target="_self">investigation</a> into the quandary and found that the answer is complicated and dependent on a number of ever-evolving factors, including the global energy mix and emissions levels. “The climate impact of U.S. LNG depends on what it replaces in countries — whether those alternatives have more or less emissions than U.S. LNG,” Arvind Ravikumar, a leading scholar on natural gas and energy policy, told Zeitlin. Indeed, in some cases, natural gas can replace coal and help reduce emissions. “There’s no right answer,” Ravikumar said. “It depends on who buys, what time frame, which country, and how are they using LNG.”<br/><br/>In a world that comes in under 1.5 degrees of warming, the emissions reductions from coal-to-gas switching peter out after 2035, Zeitlin said. If we don’t hit our Paris Agreement targets, or if developing countries prioritize cheap, available energy, then LNG export capacity turns from a potential “stranded asset” into an insurance policy. The DoE certainly has its work cut out.</p><h3>5. What if a heat wave strikes the Paris Olympics? </h3><p><strong></strong>The organizers behind the 2024 Paris Olympics are accounting for the possibility of a heat wave coinciding with the event, according to a report from <em>AFP</em>. "Heat waves and extreme weather events are factors that we take into account and that we are preparing for as much as possible, in order to take necessary action," a spokesperson said. Options include adjusting the times for some sporting events to avoid the hottest hours of the day. The athletes’ village is not air-conditioned, but organizers will offer portable A/C units. A recent <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-023-00500-5" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study</a> published in the journal <em>Npj Climate and Atmospheric Science </em>warned that there’s a decent chance Paris could experience a two-week summer heatwave worse than the one that killed 15,000 people in 2003. The city has seen blistering temperatures in recent years, and set a record high of 108.7 degrees Fahrenheit in 2019.</p><h2>THE KICKER</h2><p>Faced with lackluster customer demand, some plant-based meat companies are considering adding a surprising ingredient to their products: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2024/02/05/plant-based-meat-animal-fat/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">animal fat</a>. </p>

## Pluralistic: How I got scammed (05 Feb 2024)

date: 2024-02-05, from: Cory Doctorow's blog

Today's links How I got scammed: And why AI will make it worse. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2004, 2009, 2014, 2019, 2023 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading How I got scammed (permalink) I wuz robbed. More specifically, I was tricked by a phone-phisher pretending to be from my bank, and he convinced me to hand over my credit-card number, then did $8,000+ worth of fraud with it before I figured out what happened. And then he tried to do it again, a week later! Here's what happened. Over the Christmas holiday, I traveled to New Orleans. The day we landed, I hit a Chase ATM in the French Quarter for some cash, but the machine declined the transaction. Later in the day, we passed a little credit-union's ATM and I used that one instead (I bank with a one-branch credit union and generally there's no fee to use another CU's ATM). A couple days later, I got a call from my credit union. It was a weekend, during the holiday, and the guy who called was obviously working for my little CU's after-hours fraud contractor. I'd dealt with these folks before &#8211; they service a ton of little credit unions, and generally the call quality isn't great and the staff will often make mistakes like mispronouncing my credit union's name. That's what happened here &#8211; the guy was on a terrible VOIP line and I had to ask him to readjust his mic before I could even understand him. He mispronounced my bank's name and then asked if I'd attempted to spend $1,000 at an Apple Store in NYC that day. No, I said, and groaned inwardly. What a pain in the ass. Obviously, I'd had my ATM card skimmed &#8211; either at the Chase ATM (maybe that was why the transaction failed), or at the other credit union's ATM (it had been a very cheap looking system). I told the guy to block my card and we started going through the tedious business of running through recent transactions, verifying my identity, and so on. It dragged on and on. These were my last hours in New Orleans, and I'd left my family at home and gone out to see some of the pre-Mardi Gras krewe celebrations and get a muffalata, and I could tell that I was going to run out of time before I finished talking to this guy. "Look," I said, "you've got all my details, you've frozen the card. I gotta go home and meet my family and head to the airport. I'll call you back on the after-hours number once I'm through security, all right?" He was frustrated, but that was his problem. I hung up, got my sandwich, went to the airport, and we checked in. It was total chaos: an Alaska Air 737 Max had just lost its door-plug in mid-air and every Max in every airline's fleet had been grounded, so the check in was crammed with people trying to rebook. We got through to the gate and I sat down to call the CU's after-hours line. The person on the other end told me that she could only handle lost and stolen cards, not fraud, and given that I'd already frozen the card, I should just drop by the branch on Monday to get a new card. We flew home, and later the next day, I logged into my account and made a list of all the fraudulent transactions and printed them out, and on Monday morning, I drove to the bank to deal with all the paperwork. The folks at the CU were even more pissed than I was. The fraud that run up to more than $8,000, and if Visa refused to take out it of the merchants where the card had been used, my little credit union would have to eat the loss. I agreed and commiserated. I also pointed out that their outsource, after-hours fraud center bore some blame here: I'd canceled the card on Saturday but most of the fraud had taken place on Sunday. Something had gone wrong. One cool thing about banking at a tiny credit-union is that you end up talking to people who have actual authority, responsibility and agency. It turned out the the woman who was processing my fraud paperwork was a VP, and she decided to look into it. A few minutes later she came back and told me that the fraud center had no record of having called me on Saturday. "That was the fraudster," she said. Oh, shit. I frantically rewound my conversation, trying to figure out if this could possibly be true. I hadn't given him anything apart from some very anodyne info, like what city I live in (which is in my Wikipedia entry), my date of birth (ditto), and the last four digits of my card. Wait a sec. He hadn't asked for the last four digits. He'd asked for the last seven digits. At the time, I'd found that very frustrating, but now &#8211; "The first nine digits are the same for every card you issue, right?" I asked the VP. I'd given him my entire card number. Goddammit. The thing is, I know a lot about fraud. I'm writing an entire series of novels about this kind of scam: https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250865878/thebezzle And most summers, I go to Defcon, and I always go to the "social engineering" competitions where an audience listens as a hacker in a soundproof booth cold-calls merchants (with the owner's permission) and tries to con whoever answers the phone into giving up important information. But I'd been conned. Now look, I knew I could be conned. I'd been conned before, 13 years ago, by a Twitter worm that successfully phished out of my password via DM: https://locusmag.com/2010/05/cory-doctorow-persistence-pays-parasites/ That scam had required a miracle of timing. It started the day before, when I'd reset my phone to factory defaults and reinstalled all my apps. That same day, I'd published two big online features that a lot of people were talking about. The next morning, we were late getting out of the house, so by the time my wife and I dropped the kid at daycare and went to the coffee shop, it had a long line. Rather than wait in line with me, my wife sat down to read a newspaper, and so I pulled out my phone and found a Twitter DM from a friend asking "is this you?" with a URL. Assuming this was something to do with those articles I'd published the day before, I clicked the link and got prompted for my Twitter login again. This had been happening all day because I'd done that mobile reinstall the day before and all my stored passwords had been wiped. I entered it but the page timed out. By that time, the coffees were ready. We sat and chatted for a bit, then went our own ways. I was on my way to the office when I checked my phone again. I had a whole string of DMs from other friends. Each one read "is this you?" and had a URL. Oh, shit, I'd been phished. If I hadn't reinstalled my mobile OS the day before. If I hadn't published a pair of big articles the day before. If we hadn't been late getting out the door. If we had been a little more late getting out the door (so that I'd have seen the multiple DMs, which would have tipped me off). There's a name for this in security circles: "Swiss-cheese security." Imagine multiple slices of Swiss cheese all stacked up, the holes in one slice blocked by the slice below it. All the slices move around and every now and again, a hole opens up that goes all the way through the stack. Zap! The fraudster who tricked me out of my credit card number had Swiss cheese security on his side. Yes, he spoofed my bank's caller ID, but that wouldn't have been enough to fool me if I hadn't been on vacation, having just used a pair of dodgy ATMs, in a hurry and distracted. If the 737 Max disaster hadn't happened that day and I'd had more time at the gate, I'd have called my bank back. If my bank didn't use a slightly crappy outsource/out-of-hours fraud center that I'd already had sub-par experiences with. If, if, if. The next Friday night, at 5:30PM, the fraudster called me back, pretending to be the bank's after-hours center. He told me my card had been compromised again. But: I hadn't removed my card from my wallet since I'd had it replaced. Also, it was half an hour after the bank closed for the long weekend, a very fraud-friendly time. And when I told him I'd call him back and asked for the after-hours fraud number, he got very threatening and warned me that because I'd now been notified about the fraud that any losses the bank suffered after I hung up the phone without completing the fraud protocol would be billed to me. I hung up on him. He called me back immediately. I hung up on him again and put my phone into do-not-disturb. The following Tuesday, I called my bank and spoke to their head of risk-management. I went through everything I'd figured out about the fraudsters, and she told me that credit unions across America were being hit by this scam, by fraudsters who somehow knew CU customers' phone numbers and names, and which CU they banked at. This was key: my phone number is a reasonably well-kept secret. You can get it by spending money with Equifax or another nonconsensual doxing giant, but you can't just google it or get it at any of the free services. The fact that the fraudsters knew where I banked, knew my name, and had my phone number had really caused me to let down my guard. The risk management person and I talked about how the credit union could mitigate this attack: for example, by better-training the after-hours card-loss staff to be on the alert for calls from people who had been contacted about supposed card fraud. We also went through the confusing phone-menu that had funneled me to the wrong department when I called in, and worked through alternate wording for the menu system that would be clearer (this is the best part about banking with a small CU &#8211; you can talk directly to the responsible person and have a productive discussion!). I even convinced her to buy a ticket to next summer's Defcon to attend the social engineering competitions. There's a leak somewhere in the CU systems' supply chain. Maybe it's Zelle, or the small number of corresponding banks that CUs rely on for SWIFT transaction forwarding. Maybe it's even those after-hours fraud/card-loss centers. But all across the USA, CU customers are getting calls with spoofed caller IDs from fraudsters who know their registered phone numbers and where they bank. I've been mulling this over for most of a month now, and one thing has really been eating at me: the way that AI is going to make this kind of problem much worse. Not because AI is going to commit fraud, though. One of the truest things I know about AI is: "we're nowhere near a place where bots can steal your job, we're certainly at the point where your boss can be suckered into firing you and replacing you with a bot that fails at doing your job": https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/15/passive-income-brainworms/#four-hour-work-week I trusted this fraudster specifically because I knew that the outsource, out-of-hours contractors my bank uses have crummy headsets, don't know how to pronounce my bank's name, and have long-ass, tedious, and pointless standardized questionnaires they run through when taking fraud reports. All of this created cover for the fraudster, whose plausibility was enhanced by the rough edges in his pitch &#8211; they didn't raise red flags. As this kind of fraud reporting and fraud contacting is increasingly outsourced to AI, bank customers will be conditioned to dealing with semi-automated systems that make stupid mistakes, force you to repeat yourself, ask you questions they should already know the answers to, and so on. In other words, AI will groom bank customers to be phishing victims. This is a mistake the finance sector keeps making. 15 years ago, Ben Laurie excoriated the UK banks for their "Verified By Visa" system, which validated credit card transactions by taking users to a third party site and requiring them to re-enter parts of their password there: https://web.archive.org/web/20090331094020/http://www.links.org/?p=591 This is exactly how a phishing attack works. As Laurie pointed out, this was the banks training their customers to be phished. I came close to getting phished again today, as it happens. I got back from Berlin on Friday and my suitcase was damaged in transit. I've been dealing with the airline, which means I've really been dealing with their third-party, outsource luggage-damage service. They have a terrible website, their emails are incoherent, and they officiously demand the same information over and over again. This morning, I got a scam email asking me for more information to complete my damaged luggage claim. It was a terrible email, from a noreply@ email address, and it was vague, officious, and dishearteningly bureaucratic. For just a moment, my finger hovered over the phishing link, and then I looked a little closer. On any other day, it wouldn't have had a chance. Today &#8211; right after I had my luggage wrecked, while I'm still jetlagged, and after days of dealing with my airline's terrible outsource partner &#8211; it almost worked. So much fraud is a Swiss-cheese attack, and while companies can't close all the holes, they can stop creating new ones. Meanwhile, I'll continue to post about it whenever I get scammed. I find the inner workings of scams to be fascinating, and it's also important to remind people that everyone is vulnerable sometimes, and scammers are willing to try endless variations until an attack lands at just the right place, at just the right time, in just the right way. If you think you can't get scammed, that makes you especially vulnerable: https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/24/passive-income/#swiss-cheese-security (Image: Cryteria, CC BY 3.0, modified) Hey look at

## How Bad Is LNG for the Climate, Really?

date: 2024-02-05, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTI0ODE1Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0ODM4MTc3NX0.PYiAM7dQm1rgbcgsYZQtuj3jSOL4ubUMAP9hFXtmBsQ/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">
	President Biden’s <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/biden-lng-exports-pause-young-voters-climate" target="_self">decision</a> to pause approving liquified natural gas export terminals until it can better study their climate effects — functionally delaying or even outright preventing their construction — got real political, real fast. Almost immediately, West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin called for a <a href="https://www.energy.senate.gov/hearings/2024/2/full-committee-hearing-to-examine" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hearing</a> on the president’s decision-making.
</p><p>
	“If the Administration has the facts to prove that additional LNG export capacity would hurt Americans, they must make that information public and clear,” he said in a statement last week. “But if this pause is just another political ploy to pander to keep-it-in-the-ground climate activists at the expense of American workers, businesses and our allies in need, I will do everything in my power to end this pause immediately.”
</p><p>
	While Senator Manchin is not exactly the administration’s <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/manchin-ev-tax-credit-rules" target="_self">biggest fan lately</a>, he’s also asking some pretty interesting questions. One of the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/a-smoking-gun-for-bidens-big-climate-decision" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">animating ideas</a> of the past few months in climate politics has been the argument that LNG (and maybe even pipeline gas) are in fact far worse than the global climate even than coal, which has long been assumed to be the dirtiest, most carbon-intensive fossil fuel around. That view is based on research by Cornell University scientist <a href="https://www.research.howarthlab.org/publications/Howarth_LNG_assessment_preprint_archived_2023-1103.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Robert Howarth</a> and has been expounded by <a href="https://twitter.com/jamieclimate/status/1750848936112206285" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">climate</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/EvergreenAction/status/1750940668791296454?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">advocates</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/SenWarren/status/1750931831308927262" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">elected</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/SenJeffMerkley/status/1750617991526359264" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">officials</a> alike.
</p><p>
	But that research has not yet passed through peer review. Even if it had, Howarth’s past research has gotten <a href="https://thebreakthrough.org/issues/energy/howarth-natural-gas" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">criticism</a> from other climate scientists for using some idiosyncratic assumptions that yield more dramatic results.
</p><p>
	Make no mistake, meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement and holding global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels requires winding down our use of fossil fuels as quickly as possible. If we meet those goals, the natural gas export terminals delayed by the Biden administration’s decision will likely go dormant well before the end of their expected lifespans. But it’s not the case that in all possible worlds, continuing or even expanding natural gas production and exports would actually be <em>worse</em> for the climate.
</p><p>
	The basic physics of coal emissions versus LNG emissions are just part of the equation. When it’s burned, natural gas releases carbon dioxide, the primary source of human-caused climate change, albeit less carbon dioxide than coal. But natural gas is itself mostly methane, CH4, which traps far more heat than CO2 when it leaks from wells, pipelines, and production facilities. (LNG is also much more energy-intensive to extract, produce, and store than regular natural gas, since it has to be cooled to -260 degrees Fahrenheit, sailed across the ocean and then “regasified” and shipped via pipeline on the other side.) While CH4 is more potent than CO2 from a warming perspective, it also breaks down much more quickly in the atmosphere, which means the warming effect doesn’t last as long.
</p><p>
	How to think about LNG’s effect on overall emissions, then, largely depends on how much you think each of these factors matters. “Only if we assume high methane leakage rates and a 20-year global warming potential is natural gas worse than coal, and such assumptions are likely unrealistic,” wrote Carnegie Mellon energy systems researcher Paulina Jaramillo in an essay titled, <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/energy/key-initiatives/open-energy-outlook/navigating-the-lng-dilemma.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">aptly</a>, “Navigating the LNG Dilemma.”
</p><p>
	Absolute emissions aren’t even what we should be asking about, Arvind Ravikumar, a professor at the University of Texas and a leading scholar on natural gas and energy policy, told me. “The climate impact of U.S. LNG depends on what it replaces in countries — whether those alternatives have more or less emissions than U.S. LNG.”
</p><p>
	When the United States stepped in to replace much of the gas the European Union would otherwise buy from Russia with LNG, Ravikumar explained, it likely reduced overall emissions because of lower methane emissions from the U.S. gas industry. Before the invasion of Ukraine, Russia supplied about 155 billion cubic meters of natural gas to Europe; by 2022, that was down to around 80 billion cubic meters. That’s a lot of energy to replace. In that time, the U.S. more than doubled its LNG exports to Europe, which has guaranteed demand of at least 50 billion cubic meters from the U.S. through 2030.
</p><p>
	Had the U.S. not ramped up its LNG exports, boosters argue, these countries might not have had a viable alternative and might have turned to coal, instead. But that won’t be the case in every single possible future scenario. “There’s no right answer,” Ravikumar told me. “It depends on who buys, what time frame, which country, and how are they using LNG.”
</p><p>
	There’s at least one clear case study of the coal-to-gas switch working to lower emissions: the United States itself.
</p><p>
	In 2007, the U.S. <a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/coal/use-of-coal.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">was consuming</a> just over 1 billion tons of coal for electricity; by 2016 that had declined to 679 million, and by 2022 to just under 500 million — in other words, by more than half. <a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/natural-gas/use-of-natural-gas.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">In that same time</a>, natural gas use for electricity grew from 7 trillion cubic feet in 2007 to 10 trillion cubic feet in 2016 to 12 trillion cubic feet in 2022.
</p><p>
	U.S. greenhouse gas emissions have dropped more than 15% since 2007 to even below their 1992 levels, <a href="https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the Environmental Protection Agency</a><a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/americas-carbon-emissions-fell-for-the-first-time-since-covid" target="_self"> and the Rhodium Group</a>. The drop in emissions has been going on since 2010, which the EPA attributes, in part, to "the growing use of natural gas and renewables to generate electricity in place of more carbon-intensive fuels.”
</p><p>
	As climatologist Zeke Hausfather put it in an <a href="https://thebreakthrough.org/issues/energy/howarth-natural-gas" target="_blank">earlier commentary</a> on an earlier Howarth paper, “While it isn’t responsible for the majority of emissions reductions, natural gas replacing coal is the largest single driver.”
</p><p><br/></p><p class="drop-caps">
	Much of the conceptual infrastructure on which climate policy operates relies on estimating what the world will be like in the future — not just figuring out the effects of different levels of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, but also figuring out different likely pathways for the evolution of those emissions over time.
</p><p>
	This works in both directions — asking how specific projects either reduce or lower emissions, and asking about what an energy system would look like in a world where emissions have been reduced enough to avoid certain levels of temperature increases. And that’s really where the rubber meets the road.
</p><p>
	In a scenario where the world hits its Paris Agreement goals, there would not be the coal-to-gas switching envisioned by LNG advocates precisely because there would be very little coal still being used to generate electricity. The fear, then, is that LNG terminals would either become stranded assets, capital investments that wind up becoming liabilities; or that, once they’re in operation, the companies behind them would use their political and economic leverage — not to mention just the power of inertia — to keep enough natural gas in the global energy system to be profitable.
</p><p>
	“Either you’re building and planning to shut it down early,” Hausfather told me, “or you’re building something that’s going to be inconsistent with the world we’re aiming to have under our climate targets.”
</p><p>
	In a Paris-compliant world, almost 90% of the world’s coal reserves and over half of the natural gas and oil reserves will stay in the ground, according to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03821-8" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">researchers</a> from University College London. They estimate that in order to meet the Paris targets, gas production would “see rapid decline” from 2020 to 2050 and would be eliminated as a fuel for electricity generation by 2040, with accompanying “low utilization rates of infrastructure, and limited prospect for future additional liquefaction capacity” for exports.
</p><p>
	In other words, in a world that comes in under 1.5 degrees of warming, the emissions reductions from coal-to-gas switching peter out after 2035; with 2 degrees of warming it’s around 2040 to 2045 — in any case, beyond the planned life of the export terminals that the Biden administration’s decision affects.
</p><p>
	But how much LNG export capacity the United States builds up in the next decade is only a tiny part of the overall emissions picture now, in 2035, or in 2050. “This is the issue with regulating at a project level in general,” energy consultant Sean Smillie told me. “The decision of any given project in the scheme of global emissions is small. For me, that points to the fact that we’re trying to regulate climate change — which is a systemic issue — at the project level, and that’s a very hard thing to do.”
</p><p>
	The biggest question is just how energy systems overseas evolve — and what role LNG exports play in that determination. The European Union is about to <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/ursula-von-der-leyen-faces-rebellion-party-2040-climate-eu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">decide</a> whether to reduce its net collective emissions 90% from 1990 levels by 2040, on their way to zero by 2050, which would signal a sharp reduction in demand coming from that part of the world. Meanwhile, for U.S. LNG export projects currently in the permitting pipeline, Asian countries are contracted to receive a much bigger share, according to a Public Citizen <a href="https://www.citizen.org/news/fossil-fuel-speculators-benefit-most-from-pending-lng-terminals-sticking-u-s-consumers-with-higher-bills-analysis-shows/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">analysis</a>. <em>Bloomberg</em> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-30/asian-buyers-of-lng-from-us-projects-frozen-by-biden-are-studying-alternatives" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reports</a> that those buyers have started looking elsewhere — including to Russia.
</p><p>
	But what if we don’t hit our Paris Agreement targets, as the <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/paris-agreement-goals-failed-climate-change-global-warming-united-nations-climate-review/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">United Nations</a> and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-03/cop28-bill-gates-says-world-probably-won-t-meet-2c-climate-warming-goal" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bill Gates</a> agree we’re increasingly unlikely to do? What if developing countries prioritize cheap, available energy (<a href="https://coal.nic.in/sites/default/files/2023-12/PIB1987774.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">like India’s growing coal production</a>) over climate goals? In that case, Ravikumar argues, then LNG export capacity turns from a potential “stranded asset” into an insurance policy.
</p><p>
	“The way to think about LNG in the longer term is the insurance against a 3 [degrees of warming] world,” Ravikumar told me. If we fail at taking quick action to change our systems from carbon-polluting to zero-carbon energy, we might still be doing some coal-to-gas switching by 2050.
</p><p>
	“It’s hard to say for certain that we will or not need the LNG export terminals by 2050 and 2060,” Elan Sykes, an energy policy analyst at the Progressive Policy Institute and an <a href="https://themessenger.com/opinion/climate-change-uncompromising-activism-threat-environment-geopolitics-biden" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">opponent of the Biden administration’s decision</a>, told me. “Absent aggressive foreign policy measures [like] a Green Marshall Plan for worldwide clean energy, it’s hard to imagine a world where LNG doesn’t provide” some value, whether from continuing to help reduce emissions or simply maintaining a reliable supply of energy, he said.
</p><p>
	Modelers are good at figuring out what the energy mix of a 1.5, 2, or 3-degree world would look like. They’re less good at predicting how that energy mix will evolve over time in the world we actually live in — and it’s in that world that the Biden administration will have to decide whether more LNG exports will serve the public interest.
</p><p>
	The job isn’t just to make decisions for an ideal world. As Hausfather told me, it’s “aiming at the best versus mitigating the worst.”

## Taylor Swift Wins Album of the Year at Grammy Awards for 4th Time

date: 2024-02-05, from: VOA News USA

LOS ANGELES — Taylor Swift won album of the year at the Grammy Awards for “Midnights,” breaking the record for most wins in the category with four. 


She began her speech by thanking her producer and friend Jack Antonoff and added, “I would love to tell you this is the happiest moment of my life,” she told the crowd, but said she feels this happy when she creates music and plays shows.


Earlier in the night, Taylor Swift used her 13th Grammy win on Sunday to announce her new album, “Tortured Poets Department,” will arrive April 19.


“I know that the way that the Recording Academy voted is a direct reflection of the passion of the fans,” she said while accepting the best pop vocal album award. “So, I want to say thank you to the fans by telling you a secret that I’ve been keeping from you for the last two years which is that my brand-new album comes out April 19. It’s called ‘The Tortured Poets Department.’ I'm gonna go and post the cover right now backstage.”


One of the night’s biggest awards, record of the year, went to Miley Cyrus for “Flowers,” her second-ever Grammy and second of the night. 


“This award is amazing. But I really hope that it doesn’t change anything because my life was beautiful yesterday,” she said in her speech.


Victoria Monét won best new artist.


“Thank you to the champagne-servers tonight," Monét started her acceptance speech. “Thanks to my mom, a single mom raising this really bad girl." Then she started to cry, telling the room that this award was “15 years in the making.”


Billie Eilish won song of the year for writing the “Barbie” hit, “What Was I Made For?”


“Thank you to Greta Gerwig for making the best movie of the year,” Eilish said during her acceptance speech.


It was just one of several standout moments from Sunday's show, broadcast live from Cypto.com Arena in downtown Los Angeles.


Karol G made Grammy history Sunday by becoming the first female performer to win best música urbana album for her blockbuster “Mañana Será Bonito” record.


“This is my first time at the Grammys,” she told the audience in English. “And this is my first time holding my own Grammy.”


Performances were many. Olivia Rodrigo brought her bloodsucking ballad “vampire” – or in this case, bloodletting, as red liquid dripped from the walls behind her. Joni Mitchell, 80, made Grammy history by performing “Both Sides Now” from her 1969 album “Clouds”; Travis Scott did a medley of “My Eyes,” “I Know?,” and “Fein.” Burna Boy was joined by Brandy and 21 Savage and did “On Form,” “City Boys,” and “Sittin’ on Top of the World."


A long and touching In Memoriam segment celebrated many of the musical greats lost in the year. Stevie Wonder performed “For Once in My Life” and “The Best Is Yet To Come” in honor of Tony Bennett; Annie Lennox delivered “Nothing Compares 2 U” for Sinéad O’Connor. “Artists for ceasefire, peace in the world,” Lennox said at the end of the song, her fist extended in the air.


Jon Batiste did a medley of “Ain’t No Sunshine,” “Lean On Me,” and finally “Optimistic” with Ann Nesby for the late great music exec Clarence Avant. Oprah introduced a fiery Tina Turner tribute of “Proud Mary” by Fantasia Barrino and Adam Blackstone.


SZA also took the stage – performing a medley of her larger-than-life hits “Snooze” and “Kill Bill," joined by dancers wielding katanas.


Later, she'd take home the trophy for best R&B song — for “Snooze,” handed to her by Lizzo. SZA ran to the stage and gave a charming, out of breath speech because she was “changing, and then I took a shot,” before starting to tear up and saying, “Hi Taylor... I'm not an attractive crier. Have a good evening.”


Mariah Carey presented the night's first award, for best pop solo performance, to Miley Cyrus for “Flowers." It was also the singer's first-ever Grammy.


Afterward, Luke Combs’ delivered a heartfelt rendition of “Fast Car” with Tracy Chapman – his cover of the Chapman classic has dominated country radio and won him song of the year at the 2023 CMAs. In 1989, Chapman won best pop vocal performance, female for the song.


Dua Lipa opened the show with a high-octane medley: first, a tease of her forthcoming single, “Training Season,” then, her most recent single, “Houdini," and finally, her disco-pop “Barbie” hit “Dance the Night."


Eilish and Finneas brought their “Barbie” ballad to the Grammys stage with live string accompaniment, the second of two songs from the blockbuster film in one hour. They were followed by Cyrus, who performed “Flowers” for the first time live on television – moments after receiving her first Grammy. 


“Why are you acting like you don't know this song?” she teased the crowd — John Legend and wife Chrissy Teigen were among those in the audience who got up to dance — and later cheered mid-song, “I just won my first Grammy!”


Four-time Grammy host — and two time nominee — Trevor Noah greeted an excited crowd, starting things off with a kiss on the cheek from Meryl Streep. “The Grammys are gonna win as Oscar,” he joked about the moment.


Best country album went to Lainey Wilson for “Bell Bottom Country,” — her very first Grammy — as presented by Kacey Musgraves. “I’m a fifth-generation farmer’s daughter,” she told the crowd, adding that she’s a “songwriting farmer,” and that’s where the musical magic came from.


Jay-Z was awarded the Dr. Dre Global Impact Award and used his speech to talk about the hip-hop greats that came before him – and heavily suggesting at the Grammys history of placing rap on the backburner – or at the very least, not in the televised version of the show. (This year, there were no rap categories on screen, but two pop, one Latin, one country and one R&B.)


“We want you all to get it right,” he said. “At least get it close to right,” before switching focus to Beyoncé. “Most Grammys, never won album of the year. How does that work?”


Bridgers took an early lead at the Grammys, quickly winning four trophies ahead of the main telecast, with her and her boygenius bandmates bringing an infectious energy to the Premiere Ceremony.


Songwriter Justin Tranter gave her the first award Sunday, best pop duo/group performance, which went to SZA and Bridgers for “Ghost in the Machine."


Jack Antonoff took home producer of the year, non-classical for a third year in a row, tying Babyface as the only other producer to do so consecutively. “You need the door kicked open for you,” he said in his acceptance speech. “Taylor Swift kicked that (expletive) door open for me," referencing their work together.


The first of three new categories in 2024, best pop dance recording, was given out shortly afterward and went to Kylie Minogue for “Padam Padam" — her first win in 18 years.


About 80 Grammys were handed out pre-broadcast. Regional Mexican star Peso Pluma won his first Grammy for his first and only nomination, for best música Mexicana album for his “Genesis.”

## Routines

date: 2024-02-05, from: Manu - I write blog

<p>They say the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. I found the inverse of that to also be true for my life. Doing things differently day after day and expecting the same–positive–outcome.</p>
<p>I’m the product of two terrible traits: I’m a morning person but I also lack self-discipline. And that means keeping a morning routine is incredibly hard for me. And yet, every time I manage to do that I feel really well. My mind is in a much better place when I wake up at 6 am or even 5 am. I feel a lot better when I’m out in nature with the sun rising. I know it. I’m aware of all this. And yet keeping a morning routine is incredibly hard. I’m getting better at it though so I’m pleased with that.</p>
<p>Learning how my mind works is a fun process. You’re tempted to think you just know yourself and yet there’s always a new discovery waiting behind the corner. Thankfully I have my whole life to figure this stuff out.</p>
