## Amazon says AI features are available now for all compatible Fire tablets

date: 2024-11-15, from: Liliputing

<p>The new Amazon Fire HD 8 tablet that launched in October features the same processor as the previous-generation model. But it has more memory, a higher-resolution rear camera, and support for wireless charging. It&#8217;s a pretty modest update when it comes to hardware, which probably helps explain why it&#8217;s already on sale for $55 during [&#8230;]</p>

## Introduction to Mehdi Mohammadi

date: 2024-11-15, from: Digital Humanities Quarterly News

I&#8217;ve been captivated by digital technology ever since computers began making their mark in Iran in the late &#8217;90s. Back then, owning a computer was a luxury, but I finally got my hands on one when I started college in 1999, starting my undergrad studies in English Literature. By that time, major search engines like [...]

## Introduction to Thais Rodrigues Cons

date: 2024-11-15, from: Digital Humanities Quarterly News

Writing and technology—either together or separately—have always played a big role in my identity. I was a middle-class Brazilian kid in the early 1990s. So I would write about my feelings in a journal, read and replicate poems, play the synthesizer, and eventually type on our family Windows 98 computer.  As a teenager, some of [...]

## Why Speech to Intent is so Vital for Voice

date: 2024-11-14, from: Peter Warden

When I first tried ChatGPT, it blew my mind. Its ability to respond intelligently to almost any prompt I gave it was astonishing, it was obvious to me it was the future. It seemed like we&#8217;d finally built the kind of AI we&#8217;ve all seen in the movies. Over time though, one big limitation became [&#8230;]

## GHC 9.12.1-alpha3 is now available

date: 2024-11-14, from: Glasgow Haskell Compiler

<h1>GHC 9.12.1-alpha3 is now available</h1>
<h4 class="text-muted">Zubin Duggal - 2024-11-14</h4>

<p>The GHC developers are very pleased to announce the availability
of the third alpha release of GHC 9.12.1. Binary distributions, source
distributions, and documentation are available at <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/9.12.1-alpha3">downloads.haskell.org</a>.</p>
<p>We hope to have this release available via ghcup shortly.</p>
<p>GHC 9.12 will bring a number of new features and improvements, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The new language extension <a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0522-or-patterns.rst">OrPatterns</a> allowing you to combine multiple
pattern clauses into one.</p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0569-multiline-strings.rst">MultilineStrings</a> language extension to allow you to more easily write
strings spanning multiple lines in your source code.</p></li>
<li><p>Improvements to the OverloadedRecordDot extension, allowing the built-in
<code>HasField</code> class to be used for records with fields of non lifted representations.</p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0409-exportable-named-default.rst">NamedDefaults</a> language extension has been introduced allowing you to
define defaults for typeclasses other than <code>Num</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>More deterministic object code output, controlled by the <code>-fobject-determinism</code>
flag, which improves determinism of builds a lot (though does not fully do so)
at the cost of some compiler performance (1-2%). See <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/12935">#12935</a> for the details</p></li>
<li><p>GHC now accepts type syntax in expressions as part of <a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0281-visible-forall.rst">GHC Proposal <span>#281</span></a>.</p></li>
<li><p>The WASM backend now has support for TemplateHaskell.</p></li>
<li><p>… and many more</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A full accounting of changes can be found in the <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/9.12.1-alpha3/docs/users_guide/9.12.1-notes.html">release notes</a>.
As always, GHC’s release status, including planned future releases, can
be found on the GHC Wiki <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/GHC-status">status</a>.</p>
<p>We would like to thank GitHub, IOG, the Zw3rk stake pool,
Well-Typed, Tweag I/O, Serokell, Equinix, SimSpace, the Haskell
Foundation, and other anonymous contributors whose on-going financial
and in-kind support has facilitated GHC maintenance and release
management over the years. Finally, this release would not have been
possible without the hundreds of open-source contributors whose work
comprise this release.</p>
<p>As always, do give this release a try and open a <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/new">ticket</a> if you see
anything amiss.</p>
