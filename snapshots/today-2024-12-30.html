Thus, effectively, OpenAI is to this decade’s generative-AI revolution
what Netscape was to the 1990s’ internet revolution. The revolution is
real, but it’s ultimately going to be a commodity technology layer, not
the foundation of a defensible proprietary moat. In 1995 investors
mistakenly thought investing in Netscape was a good way to bet on the
future of the open internet and the World Wide Web in particular.
Investing in OpenAI today is a bit like that — generative AI technology
has a bright future and is transforming the world, but it’s wishful
thinking that the breakthrough client implementation is going to form
the basis of a lasting industry titan.

<h2 id="how-we-think-about-threads-ios-performance">How we think about
Threads’ iOS performance</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-29, updated: 2024-12-29, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2024/12/18/ios/how-we-think-about-threads-ios-performance/">How
we think about Threads’ iOS performance</a></strong>
</p>
This article by Dave LaMacchia and Jason Patterson provides an
incredibly deep insight into what effective performance engineering
looks like for an app with 100s of millions of users.
</p>
<p>
I always like hearing about custom performance metrics with their own
acronyms. Here we are introduced to <strong>%FIRE</strong> - the portion
of people who experience a <em>frustrating image-render experience</em>
(based on how long an image takes to load after the user scrolls it into
the viewport), <strong>TTNC</strong> (<em>time-to-network content</em>)
measuring time from app launch to fresh content visible in the feed and
<strong>cPSR</strong> (<em>creation-publish success rate</em>) for how
often a user manages to post content that they started to create.
</p>
<p>
This article introduced me to the concept of a <strong>boundary
test</strong>, described like this:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
A boundary test is one where we measure extreme ends of a boundary to
learn what the effect is. In our case, we introduced a slight bit of
latency when a small percentage of our users would navigate to a user
profile, to the conversion view for a post, or to their activity feed.
</p>
<p>
This latency would allow us to extrapolate what the effect would be if
we similarly <em>improved</em> how we delivered content to those views.
</p>
<p>
[…]
</p>
<p>
We learned that iOS users don’t tolerate a lot of latency. The more we
added, the less often they would launch the app and the less time they
would stay in it. With the smallest latency injection, the impact was
small or negligible for some views, but the largest injections had
negative effects across the board. People would read fewer posts, post
less often themselves, and in general interact less with the app.
Remember, we weren’t injecting latency into the core feed, either; just
into the profile, permalink, and activity.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<p>There’s a whole lot more in there, including details of their custom
internal performance logger (SLATE, the “Systemic LATEncy” logger) and
several case studies of surprising performance improvements made with
the assistance of their metrics and tools, plus some closing notes on
how Swift concurrency is being adopted throughout Meta.</p>

And that August 2024 release date (which the AI summary weirdly lists as
“scheduled for release” despite that date being five months in the
past)? It’s from the Idea Wiki imaginary info box for the film.
</p>
<p>
This is a particularly clear example of how badly wrong AI summarization
can go. LLMs are gullible: they believe what you tell them, and the web
is full of misleading information - some of which is completely
innocent.
</p>
<p id="hallucination">
<strong>Update</strong>: I’ve had some pushback over my use of the term
“hallucination” here, on the basis that the LLM itself is doing what
it’s meant to: summarizing the RAG content that has been provided to it
by the host system.
</p>
<p>
That’s fair: this is not a classic LLM hallucination, where the LLM
produces incorrect data purely from knowledge partially encoded in its
weights.
</p>
<p>
I classify this as a bug in Google’s larger LLM-powered AI overview
system. That system should be able to take the existence of invalid data
sources into account - given how common searches for non-existent movie
sequels (or TV seasons) are, I would hope that AI overviews could
classify such searches and take extra steps to avoid serving misleading
answers.
</p>
<p>
<p>So think this is a “hallucination” bug in the AI overview system
itself: it’s making statements about the world that are not true.</p>
