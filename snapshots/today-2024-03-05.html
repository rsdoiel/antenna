id="facing-reality-whether-its-about-apple-or-the-eu-is-a-core-requirement-for-good-management">Facing
reality, whether it’s about Apple or the EU, is a core requirement for
good management</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>Baldur Bjarnason has written an excellent piece to explain why,
exactly, companies like Apple seem wholly incapable of working with the
EU, instead of against it. He argues – quite effectively – that Apple,
and US tech punditry in general, simply do not understand the EU, nor
are they willing to spend even 10 minutes to understand it, which is
really all you need. The core premise of the EU, its very primary
function, is to enable and protect the single market. A great example of
this is the ban on roaming charges – mobile phone carriers in EU are not
allowed to charge extra for using mobile voice and data services in
another EU country. From the EU’s perspective, taking action to prevent
private parties from fragmenting and taking private control over the
single market simultaneously grew the economy and increased consumer
surplus. This is the operating theory behind much of the actions the EU
takes regarding market regulation and product standardisation: a single
market built on standards is more profitable for both businesses and
consumers. ↫ Baldur Bjarnason And because Apple and its tech punditry
refuse to try and understand the party they are dealing with, they get
caught looking like childish idiots every time they open their mouths
about it. Normally when the EU regulates a given sector, it does so with
ample lead time and works with industry to make sure that they
understand their obligations. Apple instead thought that the regulatory
contact from the EU during the lead time to the DMA was an opportunity
for it to lecture the EU on its right to exist. Then its executives made
up some fiction in their own minds as to what the regulation meant,
announced their changes, only to discover later that they were full of
bullshit. This was entirely Apple’s own fault. For months, we’ve been
hearing leaks about Apple’s talks with the EU about the Digital Market
Act. Those talks were not negotiations even though Apple seems to have
thought they were. Talks like those are to help companies implement
incoming regulations, with some leeway for interpretation on the EU’s
side to accommodate business interests. Remember what I wrote about
electrical plugs? The EU is pro-business – often criticised for being
essentially a pro-business entity – and not in favour of regulation for
regulation’s sake. If Apple had faced reality and tried to understand
the facts as they are, they would have used the talks to clarify all of
these issues and more well in advance of the DMA taking effect. But they
didn’t because they have caught the tech industry management disease of
demanding that reality bend to their ideas and wishes. ↫ Baldur
Bjarnason What a lot of people – both inside and outside the EU – do not
grasp is that while we all know the EU has shortcomings and issues, in
general, the EU is uncharacteristically (for a government agency)
popular among EU citizens, no matter the country of origin. That’s
because we, as EU citizens, and especially as EU citizens who do
anything international, know just how ridiculously beneficial the EU has
been for trade, business, the economy, travel, and so much more. Apple
can keep acting like a whiny trust fund boy who thinks the world owes
them everything, but they’ll have to deal with the consequences.
Continued violation of the DMA can lead to fines of up to 10% of
revenue. That’s 38 billion dollars. I secretly hope Apple keeps this
childish behaviour up. It’s deeply entertaining.</p>

Six years ago I wrote
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2018/03/archival-media-not-good-business.html"><i>Archival
Media: Not a Good Business</i></a> and included this
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5007621">table</a>. The argument went
as follows:<br />
<ul>
<li>
The value that can be extracted from data decays rapidly with time.
</li>
<li>
Thus companies would rather invest in current than archival data.
</li>
<li>
Thus archival media and systems are a niche market.
</li>
<li>
Thus archival media and systems lack the manufacturing volume to drive
down prices.
</li>
<li>
Thus although quasi-immortal media have low opex (running cost), they
have high capex (purchase cost).
</li>
<li>
Especially now interest rates are non-zero, the high capex makes the net
present value of their lifetime cost high.
</li>
<li>
Archival media compete with legacy generic media, which have mass-market
volumes and have already amortized their R&amp;D, so have low capex but
higher opex through their shorter service lives.
</li>
<li>
Because they have much higher volumes and thus much more R&amp;D,
generic media have much higher Kryder rates, meaning that although they
need to be replaced over time, each new unit at approximately equal cost
replaces several old units, reducing opex.
</li>
<li>
Especially now interest rates are non-zero, the net present value of the
lower capex but higher opex is likely very competitive.
</li>
</ul>
Below the fold I look into why, despite this, Microsoft has been pouring
money into archival system R&amp;D for about a decade.<br />

<h3>
Background
</h3>
Eleven years ago Facebook announced they were building entire
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2013/02/facebooks-cold-storage.html">data
centers for cold storage</a>. They expected the major reason for reads
accessing this data would be subpoenas. Eighteen months later I was
finally able to report on Kestutis Patiejunas’ talk explaining the
technology and why it made sense in
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/09/more-on-facebooks-cold-storage.html"><i>More
on Facebook’s “Cold Storage”</i></a>. They used two different
technologies, the first exploiting legacy generic media in the form of
mostly-powered-down hard drives. Facebook’s
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/09/more-on-facebooks-cold-storage.html">design
for this was</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
aimed at limiting the worst-case power draw. It exploits the fact that
this storage is at the bottom of the storage hierarchy and can tolerate
significant access latency. Disks are assigned to groups in equal
numbers. One group of disks is spun up at a time in rotation, so the
worst-case access latency is the time needed to cycle through all the
disk groups. But the worst-case power draw is only that for a single
group of disks and enough compute to handle a single group.<br /> <br />
Why is this important? Because of the synergistic effects knowing the
maximum power draw enables. The power supplies can be much smaller, and
because the access time is not critical, need not be duplicated. Because
Facebook builds entire data centers for cold storage, the data center
needs much less power and cooling. It can be more like cheap warehouse
space than expensive data center space. Aggregating these synergistic
cost savings at data center scale leads to really significant savings.
</blockquote>
Patiejunas figured out that, only at cloud scale, the economics of
archival storage could be made to work by reducing the non-media,
non-system costs. This insight led to the second technology,
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/09/more-on-facebooks-cold-storage.html">robots
full of long-lived optical media</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
It has 12 Blu-ray drives for an entire rack of cartridges holding 10,000
100TB Blu-ray disks managed by a robot. When the robot loads a group of
12 fresh Blu-ray disks into the drives, the appropriate amount of data
to fill them is read from the currently active hard disk group and
written to them. This scheduling of the writes allows for effective use
of the limited write capacity of the Blu-ray drives. If the data are
ever read, a specific group has to be loaded into the drives,
interrupting the flow of writes, but this is a rare occurrence. Once all
10,000 disks in a rack have been written, the disks will be loaded for
reads infrequently. Most of the time the entire Petabyte rack will sit
there idle.
</blockquote>
In theory Blu-ray disks have a 50-year life, but this is
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/09/more-on-facebooks-cold-storage.html">irrelevant</a>:
<blockquote>
No-one expects the racks to sit in the data center for 50 years, at some
point before then they will be obsoleted by some unknown new, much
denser and more power-efficient cold storage medium
</blockquote>
Eight years ago in
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2016/05/the-future-of-storage.html"><i>The
Future Of Storage</i></a> I explained:<br />
<blockquote>
Every few months there is another press release announcing that some
new,
<a href="http://blog.dshr.org/2014/06/more-on-long-lived-media.html">quasi-immortal
medium</a> such as 5D quartz or stone DVDs has solved the problem of
long-term storage. But the problem stays resolutely unsolved. Why is
this? Very long-lived media are inherently more expensive, and are a
niche market, so they lack economies of scale. Seagate could easily make
<a href="http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/news/events/other_meetings/storage09/docs/5-4_Anderson-seagate-v3_archive_study.pdf">disks
with archival life</a>, but they did a study of the market for them, and
discovered that no-one would pay the relatively small additional cost.
The drives currently marketed for “archival” use have a shorter warranty
and a shorter MTBF than the enterprise drives, so they’re not expected
to have long service lives.<br /> <br /> The fundamental problem is that
long-lived media only make sense at very low Kryder rates. Even if the
rate is only 10%/yr, after 10 years you could store the same data in 1/3
the space. Since space in the data center racks or even at Iron Mountain
isn’t free, this is a powerful incentive to move old media out. If you
believe that Kryder rates will get back to 30%/yr, after a decade you
could store 30 times as much data in the same space.
</blockquote>
The key parameter of these archival storage systems isn’t the media
life, it is the write bandwidth needed to keep up with the massive flow
of
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/09/more-on-facebooks-cold-storage.html">data
to be archived</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
While a group of disks is spun up, any reads queued up for that group
are performed. But almost all the I/O operations to this design are
writes. Writes are erasure-coded, and the shards all written to
different disks in the same group. In this way, while a group is spun
up, all disks in the group are writing simultaneously providing huge
write bandwidth. When the group is spun down, the disks in the next
group take over, and the high write bandwidth is only briefly
interrupted.
</blockquote>
The lesson Facebook taught a decade ago was that the keys to
cost-effective archival storage were first, massive scale, and second,
high write bandwidth. Microsoft has learned the lesson and has been
working to develop cloud-scale, high write bandwidth systems using two
quasi-immortal media, DNA and silica.<br />

Rob Carlson’s
<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/dna-data-storage"><i>The Quest for a
DNA Data Drive</i></a> provides a useful overview of the current state
of the art. Alas he starts by using one of my pet hates, the graph
showing an immense gap between the “requirements” for data storage and
the production of storage media. Carlson
<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/dna-data-storage">captions the
graph</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Prior projections for data storage requirements estimated a global need
for about 12 million petabytes of capacity by 2030. The research firm
Gartner recently issued new projections, raising that estimate by 20
million petabytes. The world is not on track to produce enough of
today’s storage technologies to fill that gap.
</blockquote>
<b>&lt;rant&gt;</b> Carlson’s point is to suggest that there is a huge
market for DNA storage. But this ignores economics. There will always be
a “requirement” to store more data than the production of storage media,
because some data is not valuable enough to justify the cost of storing
it. The “gap” could only be filled if media were free. Customers will
buy the storage systems they can afford and prioritize the data in them
according to the value that can be extracted from it.
<b>&lt;/rant&gt;</b>.<br /> <br /> The size of the market for DNA
storage systems depends upon their cost. In 2018’s
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2018/02/dnas-niche-in-storage-market.html"><i>DNA’s
Niche in the Storage Market</i></a> I imagined myself as the marketing
person for a DNA storage system and posed these challenges:<br />
<blockquote>
Engineers, your challenge is to increase the speed of synthesis by a
factor of a quarter of a trillion, while reducing the cost by a factor
of fifty trillion, in less than 10 years while spending no more than
$24M/yr.<br /> <br /> Finance team, your challenge is to persuade the
company to spend $24M a year for the next 10 years for a product that
can then earn about $216M a year for 10 years.
</blockquote>
Carlson is realistic about the
<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/dna-data-storage">engineering
challenges</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
For a DNA drive to compete with today’s archival tape drives, it must be
able to write about 2 gigabits per second, which at demonstrated DNA
data storage densities is about 2 billion bases per second. To put that
in context, I estimate that the total global market for synthetic DNA
today is no more than about 10 terabases per year, which is the
equivalent of about 300,000 bases per second over a year. The entire DNA
synthesis industry would need to grow by approximately 4 orders of
magnitude just to compete with a single tape drive.
</blockquote>
One of the speed-ups that is needed is
<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/dna-data-storage">chip-based massive
parallelism</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
One of our goals was to build a semiconductor chip to enable
high-density, high-throughput DNA synthesis.
<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abi6714">That
chip</a>, which we completed in 2021, demonstrated that it is possible
to digitally control electrochemical processes in millions of
650-nanometer-diameter wells.
</blockquote>
It was faster, but it’s chemistry had
<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/dna-data-storage">problems</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The main problem is that it employs a volatile, corrosive, and toxic
organic solvent
(<a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Acetonitrile">acetonitrile</a>),
which no engineer wants anywhere near the electronics of a working data
center.<br /> <br /> Moreover, based on a sustainability analysis of a
theoretical DNA data center performed my colleagues at Microsoft, I
conclude that the volume of acetonitrile required for just one large
data center, never mind many large data centers, would become
logistically and economically prohibitive.
</blockquote>
Although it is the industry standard, this isn’t the only way to
<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/dna-data-storage">write
DNA</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Fortunately, there is a different emerging technology for constructing
DNA that does not require such solvents, but instead uses a benign salt
solution. Companies like <a href="https://www.dnascript.com/">DNA
Script</a> and <a href="https://molecularassemblies.com/">Molecular
Assemblies</a> are commercializing automated systems that use enzymes to
synthesize DNA. These techniques are replacing traditional chemical DNA
synthesis for some applications in the biotechnology industry. The
current generation of systems use either simple plumbing or light to
control synthesis reactions. But it’s difficult to envision how they can
be scaled to achieve a high enough throughput to enable a DNA
data-storage device operating at even a fraction of 2 gigabases per
second.
</blockquote>
The Microsft/UW chip is an
<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/dna-data-storage">alternative way to
control enzymatic synthesis</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The University of Washington and Microsoft team, collaborating with the
enzymatic synthesis company Ansa Biotechnologies, recently took the
first step toward this device. Using our high-density chip, we
successfully demonstrated
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acssynbio.3c00044">electrochemical
control of single-base enzymatic additions</a>.
</blockquote>

<a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acssynbio.3c00044"><i>Spatially
Selective Electrochemical Cleavage of a Polymerase-Nucleotide
Conjugate</i></a> by jake A. Smith <i>et akl</i>:<br />
<blockquote>
Novel enzymatic methods are poised to become the dominant processes for
de novo synthesis of DNA, promising functional, economic, and
environmental advantages over the longstanding approach of
phosphoramidite synthesis. Before this can occur, however, enzymatic
synthesis methods must be parallelized to enable production of multiple
DNA sequences simultaneously. As a means to this parallelization, we
report a polymerase-nucleotide conjugate that is cleaved using
electrochemical oxidation on a microelectrode array. The developed
conjugate maintains polymerase activity toward surface-bound substrates
with single-base control and detaches from the surface at mild oxidative
voltages, leaving an extendable oligonucleotide behind. Our approach
readies the way for enzymatic DNA synthesis on the scale necessary for
DNA-intensive applications such as DNA data storage or gene synthesis.
</blockquote>
This has, as the article points out, potential for dramatically reducing
the current cost of writing DNA, but it is still many orders of
magnitude away from being competitive with a tape drive. The

<h3>
Silica
</h3>
The idea of writing data into fused silica with a femtosecond laser is
at least a
<a href="https://www.storagenewsletter.com/2014/10/31/rd-hitachi-rw-of-digital-data-in-fused-silica-glass/">decade
and a half old</a><br />
<blockquote>
In 2009, Hitachi focused on fused silica known for its excellent heat
and water resistance as a recording medium for long-term digital
storage. After proposing the use of computed tomography to read data
recorded with a femtosecond pulse laser, fused silica glass was
confirmed as an effective storage medium. Applying this technology, it
is possible to achieve multi-layer recording by changing the laser’s
focal point to form microscopic regions (dots) with differing refractive
indices. In 2012, a method was developed with Kyoto University to read
the recorded dots in 4 layers using an optical microscope (recording
density equivalent to a CD), and in 2013, 26 layer recording was
achieved (recording density equivalent to a DVD). In order to increase
recording density for practical applications, one means is to increase
the number of recording layers. At the 100-layer level of recording
density equivalent to a Blu-ray disc however issues arose in dot quality
degradation and read errors resulting from crosstalk of data recorded in
other layers.
</blockquote>
But in the last few years Microsoft Research has taken this idea and run
with it, as they report in a 68-author paper at SOSP entitled
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3600006.3613208"><i>Project Silica:
Towards Sustainable Cloud Archival Storage in Glass</i></a>. It is a
fascinating paper that should be read by anyone interest in archival
storage. Like
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2018/02/dnas-niche-in-storage-market.html">me</a>,
the authors are skeptical of the near-term prospects for
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3600006.3613208">DNA storage</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Technologies like DNA storage offer the promise of an extremely dense
media for long-term data storage. However, the high costs and low
throughputs of oligonucleotide synthesis and sequencing continue to
hamper the technology’s feasibility. The total amount of data
demonstrably stored in DNA remains on the order of MBs, and building a
functional storage system that can offer reasonable SLAs underpinned by
DNA is a substantial challenge. Alternative DNA-based technologies like
dNAM attempt to bypass costly sequencing and synthesis steps,
sacrificing density down to densities comparable with magnetic tape.
</blockquote>
Hence their focus on a medium with, in theory, a somewhat lower
volumetric density. From their
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3600006.3613208">abstract</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
This paper presents Silica: the first cloud storage system for archival
data underpinned by quartz glass, an extremely resilient media that
allows data to be left in situ indefinitely. The hardware and software
of Silica have been co-designed and co-optimized from the media up to
the service level with sustainability as a primary objective. The design
follows a cloud-first, data-driven methodology underpinned by principles
derived from analyzing the archival workload of a large public cloud
service.
</blockquote>
Their analysis of the workload of a tape-based cloud archival storage
system in Section 2
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3600006.3613208">shows that</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
on average for every MB read there are 47 MBs written, and for every
read operation there are 174 writes. We can see some variation across
months, but writes always dominate by over an order of magnitude.<br />
…<br /> Small files dominate the workload, with 58.7% of the reads for
files of 4 MiB or smaller. However, these reads only contribute 1.2% of
the volume of data read. Files larger than 256 MiB comprise around 85%
of bytes read but less than 2% of total read requests. Additionally,
there is a long tail of request sizes: there is ∼ 10 orders of magnitude
between the smallest and largest requested file sizes.<br /> …<br /> We
observe a variability in the workload within data centers, with up to 7
orders of magnitude difference between the median and the tail, as well
as large variability across different data centers.<br /> …<br /> At the
granularity of a day, the peak daily [ingress] rate is ∼16x higher than
the mean daily rate. As the aggregation time increases beyond 30 days,
the peak over mean ratio decreases significantly down to only ∼2,
indicating that the average write rate is similar across different
30-day windows.<br /> …<br /> To summarize, as expected for archival
storage, the workload is <i>heavily write-dominated</i>. However,
unexpectedly, the IO operations are dominated by <i>small file
accesses</i>.

Subramanian Muralidhar and a team from Facebook, USC and Princeton had a

archival layers. I explained in
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/10/facebooks-warm-storage.html"><i>Facebook’s
Warm Storage</i></a> that:<br />
<blockquote>
A BLOB is a Binary Large OBject. Each type of BLOB contains a single
type of immutable binary content, such as photos, videos, documents,
etc.<br /> …<br /> Figure 3 shows that the rate of I/O requests to BLOBs
drops rapidly through time. The rates for different types of BLOB drop
differently, but all 9 types have dropped by 2 orders of magnitude
within 8 months, and all but 1 (profile photos) have dropped by an order
of magnitude within the first week.<br /> <br /> The vast majority of
Facebook’s BLOBs are warm, as shown in Figure 5 - notice the scale goes
from 80-100%. Thus the vast majority of the BLOBs generate I/O rates at
least 2 orders of magnitude less than recently generated BLOBs.

Note these important differences between Microsoft’s and Facebook’s
storage hierarchies:<br />
<ul>
<li>
Microsoft stores generic data and depends upon user action to migrate it
down the hierarchy to the archive layer, whereas Facebook stores 9
specific types of application data which is migrated automatically based
upon detailed knowledge of the workload for each of the types.
</li>
<li>
Because Facebook can migrate data automatically, it can interpose a warm
layer above the archive layer of the hierarchy, and because it has
detailed knowledge about the behavior of each of the data types it can
make good decision about when to move each type down the hierarchy.
</li>
<li>
Because the warm layer responds to the vast majority of the read
requests and schedules the downward migrations, Facebook’s archive
layer’s IOPS are a steady flow of large writes with very few reads,
making efficient use of the hardware.

Contrast Facebook’s scheduled ingest flow with the bursty ingest rate
shown in Figure 2 of the Silica paper,
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3600006.3613208">which finds
that</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
At the granularity of a day, the peak daily rate is ∼16x higher than the
mean daily rate.
</blockquote>
Another interesting aspect of the Silica design is that the
technologies, and thus the hardware, used for writing and reading are
completely different. The authors point out the
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3600006.3613208">implications for the
design</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
As different technologies are used to read and write, after a platter is
written it must be fully read using the same technology that will be
used to read it subsequently. This happens before a platter is stored in
the library and any staged write data is deleted.<br /> <br /> This
design has an interesting consequence: during the period when user data
is being written into the library, the workload is going to become
<i>read</i>-dominated. Every byte written must be read to be verified,
in addition to the user reads. The read bandwidth has to be provisioned
for peak user read rate, however the read workloads are very bursty, so
read drive utilization is extremely low on average. Thus, the
verification workload simply utilizes what would otherwise be idle read
drives.
</blockquote>
Using separate write and read drives has
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3600006.3613208">two
advantages</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
This allows independent scaling of read and write throughput.
Additionally, this design allows us to create the first storage system
that offers true <i>air-gap-by-design</i>: the robotics are unable to
insert a glass platter into a write drive once the glass media has been
written.
</blockquote>
Since the majority of reads are for verification, the design needs to
make specific provision for
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3600006.3613208">user reads</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
To enable high drive efficiency, two platters can be mounted
simultaneously in a read drive: one undergoing verification, and one
servicing a customer read. Customer traffic is prioritized over
verification, with the read drive switching away when a platter is
mounted for a customer read. As soon as the customer platter stops being
accessed, the read drive has the ability to quickly switch to the other
platter and continue verification. This is similar to avoiding
head-of-line blocking of mice flows by elephant flows in networked
systems.
</blockquote>
Like Facebook’s, the prototype Silica systems are
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3600006.3613208">data-center
size</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
A <i>Silica library</i> is a sequence of contiguous write, read, and
storage racks interconnected by a platter delivery system. Along all
racks there are parallel horizontal rails that span the entire library.
We refer to a side of the library (spanning all racks) as a
<i>panel</i>. A set of <i>free roaming</i> robots called <i>shuttles</i>
are used to move platters between locations.<br /> …<br /> A read rack
contains multiple read drives. Each read drive is independent and has
slots into which platters are inserted and removed. The number of
shuttles active on a panel is limited to twice the number of read drives
in the panel. The write drive is full-rack-sized and writes multiple
platters concurrently.
</blockquote>
Their performance evaluation focuses on the ability to respond to read
requests within 15 hours. Their cost evaluation, like Facebook’s,
focuses on the savings from using warehouse-type space to house the
equipment, although is isn’t clear that they have actually done so. The
rest of their cost evaluation is somewhat hand-wavy, as is natural for a
system that <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3600006.3613208">isn’t yet
in production</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The Silica read drives use polarization microscopy, which is a
commoditized technique widely used in many applications and is low-cost.
Currently, system cost in Silica is dominated by the write drives, as
they use femtosecond lasers which are currently expensive and used in
niche applications. This highlights the importance of resource
proportionality in the system, as write drive utilization needs to be
maximized in order to minimize costs. As the Silica technology
proliferates, it will drive up the demand for femtosecond lasers,
commoditizing the technology.
</blockquote>
I’m skeptical of this last point. Archival systems are a niche in the IT
market, and one on which companies are loath to spend money, The only
customers for systems like Silica are the large cloud providers, who
will be reluctant to commit their archives to technology owned by a
competitor. Unless a mass-market application for femtosecond lasers
emerges, the scope for cost reduction is limited.<br />

There’s news this morning that UnitedHealth paid $22 million to recover
systems from a ransomeware gang. The attack impacted a number of
doctor’s clinics, especially in rural areas, and some pharmacies
struggled to fill prescriptions as a result. Also on the program, we
hear more about the state of Japan’s economy, a new satellite that
detects methane gas leaks and club closures across the U.K. amid
fizzling weeknight business.

crash tester says carmakers must bring back physical controls</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>The European organisation for crash testing and car safety, Euro NCAP
has announced that starting in 2026, cars will need physical controls in
their interiors to gain the highest safety ratings. “The overuse of
touchscreens is an industry-wide problem, with almost every
vehicle-maker moving key controls onto central touchscreens, obliging
drivers to take their eyes off the road and raising the risk of
distraction crashes,” said Matthew Avery, Euro NCAP’s director of
strategic development. “New Euro NCAP tests due in 2026 will encourage
manufacturers to use separate, physical controls for basic functions in
an intuitive manner, limiting eyes-off-road time and therefore promoting
safer driving,” he said. ↫ Jonathan M. Gitlin at Ars Technica Excellent
news, and it’s taken regulators and safety organisations way too long to
long to adapt to the growing menace of touch screens in cars.</p>

<h2 id="why-are-there-so-many-methane-satellites">Why Are There So Many
Methane Satellites?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-05, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTQ3MTg1NC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2NTM0ODYxM30.UBPNBLWGUZId7rH3kzmGRfufyZCFqMpTCed9ISu7NQY/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
On Monday afternoon, a satellite the size of a washing machine hitched a
ride on a SpaceX rocket and was launched into orbit. MethaneSAT, as the
new satellite is called, is the latest to join more than a dozen other
instruments currently circling the Earth monitoring emissions of the
ultra-powerful greenhouse gas methane. But it won’t be the last. Over
the next several months, at least two additional methane-detecting
satellites from the U.S. and Japan are scheduled to join the fleet.
</p>
<p>
There’s a joke among scientists that there are so many methane-detecting
satellites in space that they are reducing global warming — not just by
providing essential data about emissions, but by blocking radiation from
the sun.
</p>
<p>
So why do we keep launching more?
</p>
<p>
Despite the small army of probes in orbit, and an increasingly large
fleet of methane-detecting planes and drones closer to the ground, our
ability to identify where methane is leaking into the atmosphere is
still far too limited. Like carbon dioxide, sources of methane around
the world are numerous and diffuse. They can be natural, like wetlands
and oceans, or man-made, like decomposing manure on farms, rotting waste
in landfills, and leaks from oil and gas operations.
</p>
<p>
There are big, unanswered questions about methane, about which sources
are driving the most emissions, and consequently, about tackling climate
change, that scientists say MethaneSAT will help solve. But even then,
some say we’ll need to launch even more instruments into space to really
get to the bottom of it all.
</p>
<p>
Measuring methane from space only began in 2009 with the launch of the
Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite, or GOSAT, by Japan’s Aerospace
Exploration Agency. Previously, most of the world’s methane detectors
were on the ground in North America. GOSAT enabled scientists to develop
a more geographically diverse understanding of major sources of methane
to the atmosphere.
</p>
<p>
Soon after, the Environmental Defense Fund, which led the development of
MethaneSAT, began campaigning for better data on methane emissions.
Through its own, on-the-ground measurements,
<a href="https://www.edf.org/climate-impacts-methane-emissions" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the
group discovered</a> that the Environmental Protection Agency’s
estimates of leaks from U.S. oil and gas operations were totally off.
EDF took this as a call to action. Because methane has such a strong
warming effect, but also breaks down after about a decade in the
atmosphere, curbing methane emissions can slow warming in the near-term.
</p>
<p>
“Some call it the low hanging fruit,” Steven Hamburg, the chief
scientist at EDF leading the MethaneSAT project, said during a press
conference on Friday. “I like to call it the fruit lying on the ground.
We can really reduce those emissions and we can do it rapidly and see
the benefits.”
</p>
<p>
But in order to do that, we need a much better picture than what GOSAT
or other satellites like it can provide.
</p>
<p>
In the years since GOSAT launched, the field of methane monitoring has
exploded. Today, there are two broad categories of methane instruments
in space. Area flux mappers, like GOSAT, take global snapshots. They can
show where methane concentrations are generally higher, and even
identify exceptionally large leaks — so-called
<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abj4351" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“ultra-emitters.”</a>
But the vast majority of leaks, big and small, are invisible to these
instruments. Each pixel in a GOSAT image is 10 kilometers wide. Most of
the time, there’s no way to zoom into the picture and see which
facilities are responsible.

</p>
<p>
Point source imagers, on the other hand, take much smaller photos that
have much finer resolution, with pixel sizes down to just a few meters
wide. That means they provide geographically limited data — they have to
be programmed to aim their lenses at very specific targets. But within
each image is much more actionable data.
</p>
<p>
For example, GHGSat, a private company based in Canada, operates a
constellation of 12 point-source satellites, each one about the size of
a microwave oven. Oil and gas companies and government agencies pay
GHGSat to help them identify facilities that are leaking. Jean-Francois
Gauthier, the director of business development at GHGSat, told me that
each image taken by one of their satellites is 12 kilometers wide, but
the resolution for each pixel is 25 meters. A snapshot of the Permian
Basin, a major oil and gas producing region in Texas, might contain
hundreds of oil and gas wells, owned by a multitude of companies, but
GHGSat can tell them apart and assign responsibility.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll see five, 10, 15, 20 different sites emitting at the same time
and you can differentiate between them,” said Gauthier. “You can see
them very distinctly on the map and be able to say, alright, that’s an
unlit flare, and you can tell which company it is, too.” Similarly,
GHGSat can look at a sprawling petrochemical complex and identify the
exact tank or pipe that has sprung a leak.
</p>
<p>
But between this extremely wide-angle lens, and the many finely-tuned
instruments pointing at specific targets, there’s a gap. “It might seem
like there’s a lot of instruments in space, but we don’t have the kind
of coverage that we need yet, believe it or not,” Andrew Thorpe, a
research technologist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory told me. He
has been working with the nonprofit Carbon Mapper on a new constellation
of point source imagers, the first of which is supposed to launch later
this year.
</p>
<p>
The reason why we don’t have enough coverage has to do with the size of
the existing images, their resolution, and the amount of time it takes
to get them. One of the challenges, Thorpe said, is that it’s very hard
to get a continuous picture of any given leak. Oil and gas equipment can
spring leaks at random. They can leak continuously or intermittently. If
you’re just getting a snapshot every few weeks, you may not be able to
tell how long a leak lasted, or you might miss a short but significant
plume. Meanwhile, oil and gas fields are also changing on a weekly
basis, Joost de Guow, an atmospheric chemist at the University of
Colorado, Boulder, told me. New wells are being drilled in new places —
places those point-source imagers may not be looking at.
</p>
<p>
“There’s a lot of potential to miss emissions because we’re not
looking,” he said. “If you combine that with clouds — clouds can obscure
a lot of our observations — there are still going to be a lot of times
when we’re not actually seeing the methane emissions.”
</p>
<p>
De Guow hopes MethaneSAT will help resolve one of the big debates about
methane leaks. Between the millions of sites that release small amounts
of methane all the time, and the handful of sites that exhale massive
plumes infrequently, which is worse? What fraction of the total do those
bigger emitters represent?
</p>
<p>
Paul Palmer, a professor at the University of Edinburgh who studies the
Earth’s atmospheric composition, is hopeful that it will help pull
together a more comprehensive picture of what’s driving changes in the
atmosphere. Around the turn of the century, methane levels pretty much
leveled off, he said. But then, around 2007, they started to grow again,
and have since accelerated. Scientists have reached different
conclusions about why.
</p>
<p>
“There’s lots of controversy about what the big drivers are,” Palmer
told me. Some think it’s related to oil and gas production increasing.
Others — and he’s in this camp — think it’s related to warming wetlands.
“Anything that helps us would be great.”
</p>
<p>
MethaneSAT sits somewhere between the global mappers and point source
imagers. It will take larger images than GHGSat, each one 200 kilometers
wide, which means it will be able to cover more ground in a single day.
Those images will also contain finer detail about leaks than GOSAT, but
they won’t necessarily be able to identify exactly which facilities the
smaller leaks are coming from. Also, unlike with GHGSat, MethaneSAT’s
data will be freely available to the public.
</p>
<p>
EDF, which raised $88 million for the project and spent nearly a decade
working on it, says that one of MethaneSAT’s main strengths will be to
provide much more accurate basin-level emissions estimates. That means
it will enable researchers to track the emissions of the entire Permian
Basin over time, and compare it with other oil and gas fields in the
U.S. and abroad. Many countries and companies are
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/cop28-methane-limits-warming" target="_self">making
pledges to reduce their emissions</a>, and MethaneSAT will provide data
on a relevant scale that can help track progress, Maryann Sargent, a
senior project scientist at Harvard University who has been working with
EDF on MethaneSAT, told me.

</p>
<p>
It could also help the Environmental Protection Agency understand
whether its
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/biden-epa-methane-rules" target="_self">new
methane regulations</a> are working. It could help with the
<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_23_5776" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">development
of new standards</a> for natural gas being imported into Europe. At the
very least, it will help oil and gas buyers differentiate between
products associated with higher or lower methane intensities. It will
also enable fossil fuel companies who measure their own methane
emissions to compare their performance to regional averages.
</p>
<p>
MethaneSAT won’t be able to look at every source of methane emissions
around the world. The project is limited by how much data it can send
back to Earth, so it has to be strategic. Sargent said they are limiting
data collection to 30 targets per day, and in the near term, those will
mostly be oil and gas producing regions. They aim to map emissions from
80% of global oil and gas production in the first year. The outcome
could be revolutionary.
</p>
<p>
“We can look at the entire sector with high precision and track those
emissions, quantify them and track them over time. That’s a first for
empirical data for any sector, for any greenhouse gas, full stop,”
Hamburg told reporters on Friday.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>But this still won’t be enough, said Thorpe of NASA. He
wants to see the next generation of instruments start to look more
closely at natural sources of emissions, like wetlands. “These types of
emissions are really, really important and very poorly understood,” he
said. So I think there’s a heck of a lot of potential to work towards
the sectors that have been really hard to do with current technologies.”

<p class="drop-caps">
The Department of Treasury
<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1379" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">published</a>
<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/public-inspection/2023-06822/section-30d-new-clean-vehicle-credit" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new
rules</a> last year that will determine which new electric vehicles,
purchased for personal use, will qualify for
<a href="https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/credits-for-new-clean-vehicles-purchased-in-2023-or-after" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a
$7,500 tax credit</a>. They went into effect on April 18, 2023, and last
for the next decade or so.
</p>
<p>
These new tax credit rules are complicated. The list of cars that
qualify for the new tax credit can change from year to year — and even
month to month. Many buyers in the EV market might have a few questions,
including: Should I buy that new car now, or should I wait? Which cars
qualify for the current tax credit, and which ones will earn the new
one?
</p>
<p>
This is Heatmap’s guide to the new tax credit, why it matters, and what
to keep in mind as you go EV shopping.
</p>
<h3>
Who is affected by these new rules?
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
If you’re an ordinary American buying a brand-new EV to run errands and
pick up the kids, these new rules apply to you. They will determine
which cars you can get a federally funded discount on.
</p>
<p>
If you’re not buying a <em>new</em> car for <em>personal</em> use —
because you’re getting it for your business, say, or because you’re
buying a used EV — these new rules don’t apply to you. But you may
qualify for other new subsidies. We get into those below.
</p>
<p>
And even if you <em>are </em>in that first category, you may discover
it’s much cheaper to lease a new EV instead of buying it outright. We
get into why below, too.
</p>
<h3>
Why are these new rules important?
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
They completely change how the United States approaches the EV industry.
</p>
<p>
During the Bush and Obama administrations, the U.S. was focused mostly
on getting automakers to begin to experiment with EVs. So it discounted
<a href="https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/409#vehicles-purchased-before-august-17-2022" target="_blank">the
first 200,000 or so electric vehicles</a> that each manufacturer sold by
up to $7,500. If a company had cumulatively sold more than that number
over time, as Tesla and General Motors eventually did, then the discount
expired. By 2022, that had led to a peculiar situation where foreign
automakers, such as Hyundai, could use the subsidy, while some of the
largest American automakers couldn’t.
</p>
<p>
Now, U.S. policy is focused on two goals: (1) building up a domestic
supply chain for EVs and (2) getting more EVs on the road. So the tax
break is completely uncapped — any automaker can use it as many times as
possible if they meet the criteria.
</p>
<p>
But many new requirements apply: Only cars that undergo final assembly
in North America will qualify for <em>any </em>of the tax credit. Then,
cars with a battery that was more than 50% made in North America will
qualify for a $3,750 subsidy. And cars where at least 40% of the
“critical minerals” used come from the U.S. or a country with whom we
have a free-trade agreement will qualify for another $3,750 subsidy.
</p>
<p>
Those percentage-based requirements will ramp up over time. By 2029, for
instance, 100% of a car’s battery and battery components must be made in
North America.
</p>
<h3>
Why is this change happening now?
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
Because Congress said so. The Inflation Reduction Act, which Democratic
majorities in the House and Senate passed last year, mandated this
change to the EV tax credit as part of its broad expansion of American
climate policy.<span></span><br/>
</p>
<h3>
Will more EVs or fewer EVs qualify for a subsidy under those new rules?
</h3>
<br>
<p>
Initially, fewer EVs will receive a subsidy under the new rules, Biden
officials say. On a press call with reporters, a senior Treasury
official argued that more cars will eventually qualify under the new
rules than qualified under the old ones.
</p>
<h3>
Which EVs will qualify under the new rules in 2024?
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
This year, at least 15 car or light trucks will receive some or all of
the credit. Only some of those vehicles will qualify for the full $7,500
tax credit; some will qualify for a partial $3,750 tax credit. Here is
the full list of qualifying models, along with the amount of the tax
credit that they will earn:
</p>
<p>
• Audi Q5 TFSI e Quattro PHEV ($3,750)<br/> • Cadillac LYRIQ ($7,500) •
Chevrolet Bolt ($7,500)<br/> • Chevrolet Bolt EUV ($7,500)<br/> •
Chrysler Pacifica PHEV ($7,500)<br/> • Ford Escape Plug-in Hybrid
($3,750)<br/> • Ford F-150 Lightning, Standard &amp; Extended Range
($7,500)<br/> • Jeep Wrangler PHEV 4xe ($3,750)<br/> • Jeep Grand
Cherokee PHEV 4xe ($3,750)<br/> • Lincoln Corsair Grand Touring
($3,750)<br/> • Rivian R1S, Dual Large &amp; Quad Large ($3,750)<br/> •
Rivian R1T, Dual Large, Dual Max, &amp; Quad Large ($3,750)<br/> • Tesla
Model X Long Range ($7,500)<br/> • Tesla Model 3 Performance
($7,500)<br/> • Tesla Model 3 Long Range AWD ($3,500)<br/> • Tesla Model
Y AWD, Rear-Wheel Drive, &amp; Performance ($7,500)<br/> • Volkswagen
ID.4 AWD PRO, PRO, S, &amp; Standard ($7,500)<br/>
</p>
<p>
Some vehicles that earned the full tax credit in 2023, such as the Ford
Mustang Mach E, don’t qualify for any benefit as of January 2, 2024.
</p>
<h3>
Are there any EVs that definitely do not qualify for either tax credit?
</h3>
<br>
<p>
Yes. A few examples: The Hummer EV, which costs more than $110,000 a
piece, won’t qualify for either the new or old tax credit — it’s too
expensive. And the Polestar 2 won’t qualify because it’s
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/americans-are-willing-to-pay-more-to-reject-chinese-evs?draft=1" target="_self">assembled
in China</a>.
</p>
<h3>
Have there been any other recent changes to the EV tax credit? 
</h3>
<br>
<p>
Yes. Starting this year, the U.S. is preventing cars
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/ev-tax-credit-china-rule-2024" target="_blank">that
receive too much manufacturing input</a> from a “foreign entity of
concern” — that is, China — from qualifying for <em></em>any<em> </em>of
the tax credit. This has reduced the number of vehicles that qualify for
the $7,500 bonus.
</p>
<p>
This year, the government will also allow buyers
<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/EV-Tax-Credit-FAQs.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to
refund their EV tax credit at the dealership</a>. That means buyers can
now get up to a $7,500 discount at the moment when they buy their car
instead of waiting until they file their taxes in the following year.
</p>
<h3>
Are there any income caps on the $7,500 tax credit?
</h3>
<br>
<p>
Yes. A married couple must have an adjusted gross income of less than
$300,000 a year, and a single filer must have an AGI of less than
$150,000 a year, to qualify for any aspect of the subsidy. A
head-of-household must have an income of less than $225,000 a year.
</p>
<h3>
Lots of rules! Is there a price limit on the EVs that can qualify for
this new subsidy?
</h3>
<br>
<p>
Yes. Under the proposed rule, cars must have an MSRP below $55,000 to
qualify for the credit. Vans, pickup trucks, and SUVs must have an MSRP
below $80,000.
</p>
<h3>
If my household makes more than that, do I have any other options?
</h3>
<br>
<p>
Yes. The Inflation Reduction Act also included a new $7,500 tax credit
for EVs used for any commercial purpose. The Treasury Department is
<em>expected </em>to interpret that provision to cover leasing, but it
hasn’t announced the guidelines for that rule yet, so we don’t know for
sure.
</p>
<p>
But the provision will probably tilt new EV drivers toward leasing their
car rather than buying it outright, because the dealer should — emphasis
on <em>should —</em> offer relative discounts on leasing vehicles as
compared to buying them.
</p>
<h3>
There’s no way I can afford a new EV. Does the IRA contain any subsidies
for buying a used EV?
</h3>
<br>
<p>
Yes. There’s also
<a href="https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/used-clean-vehicle-credit" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a
new $4,000 tax credit</a> for buying a used EV that costs $25,000 or
less. It went into effect on January 1, 2023, so you can go ahead and
use it today.
</p>
<p>
But note that it has even stricter income limits: Married couples can
only take advantage of it if they make $150,000 or less, and other
filers if they make $75,000 or less.
</p>
<h3>
Out of the curiosity, what models qualified for the $7,500 credit before
April 18?
</h3>

<p>

You can’t shop your way out of a monopoly (05 Mar 2024)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-05, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links You can’t shop your way out of a monopoly: Any election
where you vote with your wallet will be won by the people with the
thickest wallets. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in
history: 2009, 2014, 2019 Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent
appearances: Podcasts, events and more. Latest books: You keep readin’
em, I’ll keep writin’ ‘em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I’ll keep
writin’ ‘em. Colophon: All the rest. You can’t shop your way out of a
monopoly (permalink) If you’re running a business, you can either invest
at being good at your business, or good at Google SEO. Choose the former
and your customers will love you – but they won’t be able to find you,
thanks to the people who choose the latter. And if you’re going to
invest in top-notch SEO, why bother investing in quality at all? For
more than a decade, Google has promised that it would do something about
“lead gens” – services that spoof Google into thinking that they are
local businesses, pushing down legit firms on both regular search and
Google Maps (these downranked businesses invested in quality, not SEO,
remember). Search for a roofer, a plumber, an electrician, or a
locksmith (especially a locksmith), and most or all of the results will
be lead-gens. They’ll take your call, pretend to be a local business,
and then call up some half-qualified bozo to come out and charge you
four times the going rate for substandard work:
https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/31/business/fake-online-locksmiths-may-be-out-to-pick-your-pocket-too.html
Some of them just take your money and they “go back to the shop for a
tool” and never return:
https://www.riverfronttimes.com/news/when-a-fake-business-used-a-real-st-louis-address-things-got-weird-32087998
Google has been promising to fix this since the late aughts, and to be
fair, it’s a little better. There was once a time when a map of
Manhattan showed more locksmiths than taxis:
https://blumenthals.com/blog/2009/02/18/google-maps-proves-more-locksmiths-in-nyc-than-cabs/
But GMaps is trapped in the enshittification squeeze. On the one hand,
the company wants to provide a good and reliable map. On the other hand,
the company makes money selling “ads” that are actually payola, where a
business can pay to get to the top of the listings or get displayed on
the map itself. Zoom out of Google’s map of central London and the
highlighted landmarks are a hilarious mix of “organic” and paid
listings: the British Museum, Buckingham Palace, the Barbican, the
London Eye…and a random oral and maxillofacial clinic in the financial
district: https://twitter.com/dylanbeattie/status/1764711667663831455
Hell of a job “organizing the world’s information and making it
universally accessible and useful,” Big G. Doubtless the average
Londoner finds the presence of this clinic super helpful in orienting
themselves relative to the map on their phone screens, and it’s a real
service to tourists hoping to hit all the major landmarks. It’s not just
Maps users who’d noticed the rampant enshittification. Even the original
design team is so horrified they’re moved to speak out about the moral
injury they experience seeing the product they worked so hard on turned
into a giant pile of shit:
https://twitter.com/elizlaraki/status/1727351922254852182 Now, when it
comes to locksmiths, I’m lucky. My neighborhood in Burbank includes the
wonderful Golden State Lock and Safe, which has been in business since
1942: https://www.goldenstatelock.com/ But you wouldn’t know it from
searching GMaps for a locksmith near me. That search turns up a long
list of scams: https://www.google.com/maps/search/locksmith/<span
class="citation"
data-cites="34.1750451">@34.1750451</span>,-118.369948,14z/data=!3m1!4b1?entry=ttu
It also turns up plenty of Keyme machines – these are private-equity
backed, self-serve key-cutting machines placed in grocery stores.
Despite Keyme calling itself a “locksmith,” it’s just a badly secured,
overcaptilized, enshittification-bound system for collecting and
retaining shapefiles for the keys to millions of homes, cross-referenced
with billing information that will make it easy for the eventual hackers
to mass-produce keys for all those poor suckers’ houses. (Hilariously,
Keyme claims to be an “AI” company):
https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200114005194/en/KeyMe-Raises-35-Million-to-Further-Its-Mission-of-Building-the-Premier-Locksmith-Services-Company-in-the-Nation
But despite the fact that you can literally see the Golden State
storefront from Google Streetview, Google Maps claims to have no
knowledge of it. Instead, Streetview labels Golden State “Keyme” – and
displays a preview showing a locksmith using a tool to break into a jeep
(I’d dearly love to know how the gadget next to the Slurpee machine at
the 7-Eleven will drive itself to your jeep and unlock the door for you
when you lose your keys):
https://www.google.com/maps/place/KeyMe+Locksmiths/<span

It’s pretty clear to me what’s going on here. Keyme has hired some SEO
creeps and/or paid off Google, flooding the zone with listings for its
machines. Meanwhile, Golden State, being merely good at locksmithing,
has lost the SEO wars. Perhaps Golden State could shift some of its
emphasis from being good at locksmithing in order to get better at SEO,
but this is a race that will always be won by the firm that puts the
most into SEO, which will always be the firm that puts the least into
quality. Whenever I write about this stuff, people inevitably ask me
which search engine they should use, if not Google? And there’s the rub.
Google used predatory pricing and anticompetitive mergers to acquire a
90% search market-share. The company spends more than $26b/year buying
default position in every place where you might possibly encounter a new
search engine. This created the “kill zone” – the VC’s term of art for
businesses that no one will invest in, because Google makes sure that no
one will ever find out it exists:
https://www.theverge.com/23802382/search-engine-google-neeva-android
That’s why the only serious competitor to Google is Bing, another Big
Tech company (Bing is also the primary source of results on Duckduckgo,
which is why DDG sometimes makes exceptions for Microsoft’s
privacy-invading tracking):
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DuckDuckGo#Controversies Google tells us
that the quid-pro-quo of search monopolization is search excellence. The
hundreds of billions it makes every year through monopoly control gives
it the resources it needs to fight spammers and maintain search result
quality. Anyone who’s paid attention recently knows that this is
bullshit: Google search quality is in free-fall, across all its
products:
https://downloads.webis.de/publications/papers/bevendorff_2024a.pdf But
Google doesn’t seem to think it has a problem. Rather than devoting all
its available resources to fighting botshit, spam and scams, the company
set $80 billion dollars alight last year with a stock buyback that was
swiftly followed with 12,000 layoffs, followed by multiple subsequent
rounds of layoffs:
https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/21/im-feeling-unlucky/#not-up-to-the-task
The scams that slip through Google’s cracks are sometimes nefarious, but
just as often they’re decidedly amateurish, the kind of thing that
Google could fix by throwing money at the problem, say, to validate that
new ads for confirmed Google merchants come from the merchant’s
registered email addresses and go to the merchant’s registered website:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/24/passive-income/#swiss-cheese-security
Search is a capital intensive business, and there are real returns to
scale, as the UK Competition and Market Authority’s excellent 2020 study
describes:
https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5fe4957c8fa8f56aeff87c12/Appendix_I_-<em>search_quality_v.3_WEB</em>.pdf
But Google doesn’t seem to think that its search needs that $80 billion
to fight the spamwars. That’s the thing about monopolists, they get
complacent. As Lily Tomlin’s “Ernestine the AT&amp;T operator” used to
say, “We don’t care, we don’t have to, we’re the phone company.” That’s
why I’m so excited about the DOJ Antitrust Division monopolization case
against Google. Trusting one company to “organize the world’s
information and make it universally accessible and useful,” was a
failure:
https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-google-monopolizing-digital-advertising-technologies
I understand why people want to know which search engine they should use
instead of Google, and I get why, “There aren’t any good search engines”
is such an unsatisfactory answer. I understand why each fresh round of
printer-company fuckery prompts people to ask “which printer should I
get?” and I understand why “There are only six major printer companies
and they’re all suffering from end-stage enshittification” isn’t what
anyone wants to hear. We want to be able to vote with our wallets,
because it’s so much faster and more convenient than voting with our
ballots. But the vote-with-your-wallet election is rigged for the people
with the thickest wallets. Try as hard as you’d like, you just can’t
shop your way out of a monopoly – that’s like trying to recycle your way
out of the climate emergency. Systemic problems need systemic solutions
– not individual ones. That’s why the new antitrust matters so much. The
answer to monopolies is to break up companies, block and unwind mergers,
ban deceptive and unfair conduct. “Caveat emptor” is the scammer’s
motto. You shouldn’t have to be an expert on lead gen scams to hire a
locksmith without getting ripped off. There are good products and
services out there. Earlier this year, we decided to install a
(non-networked) programmable pushbutton lock. I asked Deviant Ollam –
whom I know from Defcon’s Lockpicking Village – for a recommendation and
he suggested the Schlage FE595:
https://www.schlage.com/en/home/products/FE595PLYFFFFLA.html I liked it
so much I bought another one for my office door. Eric from Golden State
Lock and Safe installed it while I wrote this blog-post. It’s great. I
recommend both of ‘em – 10/10, would do business again. (Image: alicia

DHL was the first major company to put an all-electric class 8 yard
truck into service in 2015. Now, DHL has 50 electric yard trucks from
Orange EV in its logistics fleet, with plans to fully phase out diesel
trucks by 2025.

<h2 id="its-time-to-give-up-on-everything-but-email">It’s Time to Give
Up on Everything but Email</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-05, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<p>
I was sitting there, minding my own damn business, surfing the web,
clicking around, enjoying my time, when I stumbled on
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/03/email-nightmare-just-give-up/677615/">this
article</a>, by Ian Bogost on The Atlantic, that is so painfully stupid
that I had to take the time and comment on it. Because, as you know, I
love emails.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Finally, in step five, you must evangelize your mission. Email is a
public-health concern. Gently correct your mother when she tries to
correspond. Reprimand your email-happy colleagues. Punish email abuse by
withholding your replies. Or, more gently, darken someone’s doorway. In
short, you must show the sort of leadership that will encourage others
to forsake their email too. We’ll never stop the rain of email, no
matter what we do. But if we work together, maybe we can build a kind of
shelter.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The entire premise of this article is that email is an unmanageable mess
filled with all sorts of garbage and dealing with it is a lost cause.
There’s an analogy in there that is so idiotic that is worth quoting:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Alas, there is no opting out from email. As a practical matter, your
inbox cannot be abandoned altogether. The same is true for postal mail:
To function within the normal bounds of contemporary society, you must
be addressable in physical space. You must be able to receive Amex bills
and Amazon baubles, and also, you must subject yourself to lots of junk.
This analogy between your home’s mailbox and your computer’s inbox is so
easily made that it’s often overlooked. Both are stuffed with garbage by
default, but also just a few essential messages.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Ian, let me give you some shocking advice: unlike your physical address,
it’s not hard to get an extra email address. Hell, you can get even more
than one. You can go one step further and get a disposable one!
Shocking, I know!
</p>
<p>
In all seriousness, if in 2024 you’re using one single email address for
everything that’s a you problem, not an email problem. Also, Ian, let me
ask you a question: what’s the alternative here? Do we all move to
Slack/Discord/Teams? Do we all move everything to DMs? Do you think
that’s a better solution?
</p>
<p>
There’s a reason why emails are still here. They’re still here because
they work. Is email perfect? No. Is there a better alternative? Also no.

$650 million for a data center that runs on nuclear power. Talen
Energy’s Cumulus data center campus in Pennsylvania gets power from the
Susquehanna nuclear plant, one of the largest nuclear power plants in
the U.S. It will give Amazon a supply of clean carbon-free power, which
the company could use to run energy-intensive artificial intelligence
operations. <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=e6d3a8bdc1&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">reported</a>
that AI searches require 10 times more computing power than regular
searches. Amazon’s new data center campus could give it a leg-up over
other tech giants because “companies looking to start data centers
running AI face delays in getting permits to connect to grids, and long
waits for the installation of transmission lines to connect utilities to
their facilities.”

<h3>
<span></span>2. E-bike accidents account for majority of NYC cycling
deaths
</h3>
<p>
<strong></strong>Thirty cyclists died in New York City last year, the
highest number since 1999, <em>The New York Times</em>
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=e471cdcc85&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">reported</a>,
citing Department of Transportation data. Twenty-three of those killed
were riding electric bikes, and most of them collided with vehicles in
areas lacking proper cycling infrastructure. However the <em>Times</em>
notes that a good portion (about one-third) of the e-bike riders who
died were in solo crashes – accidents that did not involve cars or
pedestrians, a trend that isn’t seen among traditional bike-riders.
“There may be a learning curve that some first-time e-bike riders aren’t
prepared for,” said Sara Lind, an executive director at Open Plans.
“It’s very possible that that learning curve, combined with the speed of
the bike, exacerbates already confusing or chaotic conditions.
Navigating a pothole or a suddenly blocked bike lane is more dangerous
at a higher speed, emphasizing even more the need for better
infrastructure as more people use e-bikes.” Some e-bikes can reach
speeds of 25 mph, though NYC is reducing the top speeds of electric Citi
Bikes to 18 mph.

<strong></strong>The world is on the cusp of the worst mass coral
bleaching event in the history of the planet, the U.S. National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=89b328527f&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">warned</a>.
Climate change and El Niño have sent ocean temperatures soaring, and
already “the Southern Hemisphere is basically bleaching all over the
place,” ecologist Derek Manzello, the coordinator of NOAA’s Coral Reef
Watch, told <em>Reuters</em>. “The entirety of the Great Barrier Reef is
bleaching. We just had reports that American Samoa is bleaching.”
Researchers believe a sustained global temperature increase of 1.5
degrees Celsius is a tipping point for mass coral reef die-off. Coral
reef ecosystems provide a home to thousands of species of fish and other
plants and animals, and are essential sources of food and income for
millions of people around the world. NOAA
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=6d30066377&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">notes</a>

bleaching event, but they are under more stress and are subject to
mortality.”

the firm said it expects battery prices to drop by 40% between 2023 and
2025, resulting in “breakthrough levels” of cost parity with internal
combustion engine cars in some markets. By 2030, Goldman sees EVs
accounting for 50% of U.S. car sales. Looking ahead, Nikhil Bhandari,
co-head of Asia-Pacific Natural Resources and Clean Energy Research,
said major innovations like solid-state batteries could “be a
game-changer for the industry.” Batteries can account for one-third of
the cost of an EV.

HFCs represent around 2% of total greenhouse gases, but “their impact on

regular reader of this blog will know how totally I agree with this. But
oddly when I agreed with her, perhaps a little to strongly for her

very typical of reporters, to use an ad hominem to not have to listen to
a non-journalist opinion about journalism. I have been a reader of the

<h2 id="israel-and-palestine">2024-03-04 Israel and Palestine</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-05, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
2024-03-04 Israel and Palestine
</h1>
<p>
If you’re wondering how Israel is going to come back after all this, I
suspect you already forgot how it managed to come back
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Gaza%E2%80%93Israel_conflict">after
2006</a>. I’m not sure how that makes me feel. On the one hand, I have
completely checked out. The people in charge are utter villains. The
settlements, the cutting down of trees, the terrorizing, the things one
reads in the news if one cares to look are in a vague but emotionally
crushing and morally grinding way similar to how the territory of the US
was built on rape, murder, land grab, death marches and reservations. On
the other hand, I think we cannot let that hold us back from seeking a
better future. We must not stare at the bloody entrails left behind on
this road to war. Yes, the news is grim. We must look past it, however.
What comes after that? Where will we be in forty years? In twenty years?
In five years? In two years? Next year? How will it be better than this?
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“The disparity in conditions in the north and south is clear evidence
that aid restrictions in the north are costing lives. UNICEF and WFP
malnutrition screenings in the north in January found that nearly 16 per
cent - or 1 in 6 children under 2 years of age - are acutely
malnourished. Similar screenings conducted in the south in Rafah, where
aid has been more available, found 5 per cent of children under 2 years
are acutely malnourished.” –
<a href="https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/statement-adele-khodr-unicef-regional-director-middle-east-and-north-africa-0">Statement
by Adele Khodr, UNICEF Regional Director for the Middle East and North
Africa</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
And if you think a solution is impossible, then take heart. The world
has managed to come back from two World Wars and countless other brutal
wars. Peace is possible. People are not inherently evil. Most people
want peace. Those in power and the people surrounding them and
supporting them often don’t want peace, however. And once the slaughter
starts, it’s hard to stop. Peace is hard.
</p>
<p>
Often the people arguing for war just can’t imagine peace because of
this detail or that detail. And the details are hard to get right, for
sure. But they are not impossible. Imagination is required. How else are
people going to make plans for after the war? The war will end one day.
And those who survived will be following plans that somebody imagined.
It is important to imagine a happy, prosperous future and then to make
plans of how to get there.
</p>
<p>
I remember how I was a German speaking kid in Portugal in the eighties
and sometimes I’d be greeted by an angry “Heil Hitler!” from kids my
age. And Portugal wasn’t even in the war! But all the killing takes
generations to forgive and forget. The longer it takes us to get to
peace, the longer it will take to forgive. And once there is peace, we
must not squander it. We need to work for it. We need to keep aiming for
that happy, prosperous future and stick to plans that go there. Don’t
follow leaders without a clear plan. If they don’t have one, they don’t
care or they’re unwilling to listen. There are many people with plans
for peace. It’s just that the road is hard. And yet, that is the road we
have.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Stop the killing.
</li>
<li>
Respect human rights.
</li>
<li>
Implement justice.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Yes, it’s hard. But the alternative isn’t looking good. And we know how
to do this. We have negotiated countless peace treaties. We have found
solutions to thorny issues all over the world. This is not an impossible
task.

“We laugh so we don’t cry,” I heard Sarah Taber say in her Farm to Taber
podcast, either in

In that spirit,
<a href="https://existentialcomics.com/comic/527">Existential Comics
527: Fantasy Morality</a> has this note at the end:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Since the good guys always win in the end, and are typically
outnumbered, this becomes pretty important. The orcs will brutally,
savagely kill a few dozen elves, and the elves will respond in a very
civilized fashion by wiping out the entire orc civilization. You can
even still see this kind of justification in contemporary colonialism
(<em>cough Israel cough</em>).

<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Whether or not we&amp;#8217;re older adults, we all are being bombarded with a blunt political narrative about aging that is as wrong as it is dangerous. In essence, the message is that &amp;#8220;old&amp;#8221; equals &amp;#8220;bad&amp;#8221; and that if a person is going to be a leader, they had better do it while they are young.

<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Nvidia Corp.&amp;#8217;s rise is captivating the stock market and driving the S&amp;#038;P 500 Index to new highs. But it also raises cautionary reminders of another investor darling that soared on dreams of a technological transformation, only to tumble back to earth when those hopes turned to disappointment. That stock belongs to Tesla Inc., which sparked its own mania in 2017 as investors bet that electric vehicles were going to take over the world. Back then, Elon Musk&amp;#8217;s company was a phenomenon as it blew past established carmakers like General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co. in market capitalization to become America&amp;#8217;s biggest auto manufacturer. Some analysts were looking beyond the industry and calling it &amp;#8220;the next Apple Inc.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

<h2
id="republican-voters-clash-over-whether-haley-should-remain-in-nomination-race">Republican
Voters Clash Over Whether Haley Should Remain in Nomination Race</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW ORLEANS — As the Republican Party primary contests continue into
their third month, former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley is the
only remaining challenger to former U.S. President Donald Trump. </p>
<p>The primaries will determine who is the GOP’s nominee for president
and who will challenge President Joe Biden in November’s presidential
election.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Trump has won all but one of the 11 primaries and caucuses so far,
racking up 276 total delegates to Haley’s 43. (Haley earned her first
victory in Washington D.C. this past weekend, a contest long predicted
to go her way.) With 15 states casting their votes for a nominee on
March 5, a day known as “Super Tuesday,” Republicans are divided on
whether Haley should remain in the race or get out of the former
president’s way.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“If you’re a Democrat, you probably want Haley to stay in the race
because she’s distracting Trump from focusing on defeating Biden,”
explained Bob Carreto, a Trump supporter from Chalmette, Louisiana. “But
if you’re a real Republican, you want her to drop out of the primaries
as fast as possible.”</p>
<p>“She’s forcing Trump to spend money defeating her, and it’s not good
for the Republican Party,” Carreto said. “But the reality is, she
doesn’t stand a chance, so she should just quit.”</p>
<p>Even though Trump has won each of the contests so far, not all voters
who could cast their ballot this November for a Republican think Haley
should exit.</p>
<p>“I think she’s incredibly brave for staying in the race, especially
given that Trump is a maniacal egoist who attacks anyone who challenges
him,” Abby LaCombe, an independent voter from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,
told VOA. </p>
<p>“She’s facing a lot of attacks for refusing to withdraw, and she’s
giving people who vote Republican a choice — the ability to choose
someone other than Trump, a politician who has shown he has no respect
whatsoever for democracy,” LaCombe said.</p>
<p>The Haley campaign did not respond to VOA’s request for comment when
asked what Haley would say to those questioning why she is staying in
the race.</p>
<p>Uphill battle</p>
<p>The Trump campaign has been insistent on undercutting Haley’s
challenge by </p>
<p>highlighting her many stumbles at the ballot box. In her home state
of South Carolina, for example, the former president collected 60% of
the vote to her 40%.</p>
<p>Michigan is a more moderate state where independent voters — thought
to be more receptive to Haley’s message — are allowed to vote in the
Republican primary. Still, in the state’s recent primary, Trump’s margin
of victory was even greater (68% to 27%).</p>
<p>“She can’t name one state she can win, let alone be competitive in,”
Steven Cheung, a Trump spokesperson, said in a statement last week.</p>
<p>The Haley campaign did not respond to VOA’s request for comment when
asked where she believes she can win on Super Tuesday or beyond.</p>
<p>On Sunday’s “Meet the Press” talk show, Haley said, “I think we
fight. You’re going to have 16 states and territories that are voting on
Tuesday. And so, a lot of people’s voices are going to be heard. And
that’s what this has all been about.”</p>
<p>Most political experts, like University of Georgia political
scientist Charles Bullock, agree that it will be difficult for Haley to
win against the former president.</p>
<p>“I think it’s probably too late for her,” he explained to VOA. “This
is Trump’s party, and he controls its voters. It’s a party dominated by
an electorate who will stick with him no matter what — probably until he
dies or withdraws from public view.”</p>
<p>Bullock, however, sees one way the Republican faithful could abandon
him.</p>
<p>“A conviction,” he said. “Polling shows that if he is convicted of
one of the several crimes he is accused of, then a substantial number of
voters would abandon him. I think it’s possible that Haley is waiting,
hopeful she could gather his votes if a conviction takes place.”</p>
<p>Trump faces 91 charges in four trials, including allegations he
illegally tried to upend his 2020 election loss, whether he illegally
took highly classified documents with him when he left office, and
whether he falsified documents related to hush-money paid to a porn
actor.</p>
<p>He has denied all the allegations.</p>
<p>Motivation for remaining in the race</p>
<p>A Reuters/Ipsos poll from last month found that 51% of Republican
voters said they would not vote for Trump if he was convicted of any of
the 91 felony charges brought against him across four criminal trials. A
further 25% said they weren’t sure how they would vote in that case.</p>
<p>Fifty-eight percent said they would not vote for Trump if he were
serving time in prison in November.</p>
<p>While experts like Bullock believe a Trump conviction might be
Haley’s reason for staying in the race, others say she could have other
motivations.</p>
<p>Henry Olsen, a senior fellow with the Ethics and Public Policy
Center, believes Haley, the former U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations, hopes if she can win several states, it will allow her to gain
concessions from Trump during the Republican National Convention.</p>
<p>“She’s been spending her time in more moderate states and states
where independent voters are also allowed to take part in the Republican
primary,” Olsen said, adding, “states like Minnesota, where Marco Rubio
beat Trump in the 2016 primary, and Colorado, where moderate Republican
Senator Joe O’Dea beat a Trump-supported opponent by a wide margin.”</p>
<p>“Utah, Vermont, Massachusetts and Maine are all in the same boat, and
if she can win five states, Republican Party rules will give her more
time and clout at the convention to voice her opposition to Trump,”
Olsen continued. “Those wins are going to be a stretch for her, but if
she gets them, Trump’s team will want to avoid any bad attention at the
convention and may be willing to give concessions important to her, like
a promise to support NATO.”</p>
<p>Other experts, like David Stack, a political scientist at Cleveland
State University, thinks Haley might have one eye set on the 2028
presidential election.</p>
<p>“I just don’t see Haley having a path to the nomination this cycle,”
Stack told VOA. “Her best bet for a win on Super Tuesday might be in
Vermont, but even there she is down by about 30% in polling.”</p>
<p>“So, the question then is why is she staying in the race?” Stack
said. “I think it could be to bolster her name recognition and collect
donations for future elections. If she has a good amount of money in the
bank after Super Tuesday, that could be a sign she is building a war
chest for the future.”</p>
<p>Alternative to Trump</p>
<p>For her part, Haley insists her focus is on the present and that she
believes she is the Republican Party’s best chance at unseating
President Biden.</p>
<p>“This has never been about me or my political future,” Haley said
last week after her defeat in the South Carolina primaries. “We need to
beat Joe Biden in November. I don’t believe Donald Trump can beat Joe
Biden. Nearly every day, Trump drives people away.”</p>
<p>She added, “I’m an accountant. I know 40% is not 50%, but I also know
40% is not some tiny group. There are huge numbers in our Republican
primaries who are saying they want an alternative.”</p>
<p>Jason Winder, a Republican from Uintah County, Utah, says he is one
of those voters and is looking forward to casting his ballot for Haley
on Tuesday.</p>
<p>“I like the idea of having a choice, and I’m grateful to still be
able to show my dissent for Trump by backing someone who wasn’t involved
in the January 6 insurrection,” Winder told VOA. “I hope the GOP
leadership wakes up. He lost the popular vote in 2016 and 2020, and I
think the margins will be even bigger this year. At least Nikki Haley
gives us a chance.”</p>
<p>This week, Haley told supporters at a rally in Minnesota that Trump
can’t win the general election if he’s losing 40% of the vote, and
polling has shown a sizable portion of the Republican Party believe
Trump is too extreme to defeat Biden. Nearly nine in 10 Haley voters in
South Carolina said they would not be satisfied with Trump as the
Republican Party’s presidential nominee.</p>
<p>As a result, support in the form of fundraising dollars and
endorsements from moderate segments of the Republican Party continue to
find their way to the former governor.</p>
<p>On Friday, Haley received endorsements from two of the party’s most
moderate senators, Susan Collins from Maine and Lisa Murkowski from
Alaska.</p>
<p>Despite that support, many in the party, including Trump’s most
ardent supporters, continue to push Haley to exit the race.</p>
<p>“I actually like Nikki Haley and I would vote for her if she was the
nominee,” explained Harvey Wasserman, a resident of Daytona Beach,
Florida. “But I’ve voted for Trump twice and I’m going to do it again in
the primary. I don’t think she can win, so it’s time for her to give the
stage to Trump so he can focus on Biden.”</p>

<h2 id="donald-trump-wins-north-dakota-republican-caucuses">Donald Trump
Wins North Dakota Republican Caucuses</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BISMARCK, N.D. — Donald Trump won the North Dakota Republican
presidential caucuses on Monday, adding to his string of victories
heading into Super Tuesday.</p>
<p>The former president finished first in voting conducted at 12 caucus
sites, ahead of former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley. The result puts
Trump back on the winning track, which was briefly interrupted on Sunday
when Haley notched her first victory of the campaign in the District of
Columbia’s primary.</p>
<p>The White House hopefuls now turn their attention to Super Tuesday,
when results will pour in from 16 states in contests that amount to the
single biggest delegate haul of any day in the presidential primary.
Trump and President Joe Biden, a Democrat, are dominating their races
and are on track to winning their nominations later this month.</p>
<p>Under North Dakota’s rules, candidates are eligible to win delegates
if they finish with at least 20% of the vote. However, a candidate who
wins at least 60% of the vote receives all of the state’s 29
delegates.</p>
<p>Four candidates were on the ballot, including Trump and Nikki Haley.
The other candidates, who have received little attention, were Florida
businessman David Stuckenberg and Texas businessman and pastor Ryan
Binkley, who recently ended his campaign.</p>
<p>Retired music teacher and librarian Karen Groninger, of Almont, said
Monday that she voted for Trump, calling him the best choice. The
76-year-old cited Trump’s 2020 speech at the annual March for Life
anti-abortion event in Washington, D.C. — the first by a sitting
president — and his border policies.</p>
<p>Longtime Republican state Sen. Dick Dever, of Bismarck, said he voted
for Haley, but added she’s unlikely to win. The retired factory
representative, 72, said, “I hear an awful lot of people say that they
really liked Trump’s policies, but they don’t like the way he conducts
himself, and I think he’s gone overboard a bit.”</p>
<p>Caucus voters were encouraged to be paying party members, but those
who wouldn’t pay $50 for annual membership were asked to sign a pledge
to affiliate with the party, caucus Chair Robert Harms said.</p>
<p>North Dakota is the only state without voter registration. The
caucuses followed official state voter identification protocols, such as
providing a driver’s license. Voting was done only in person and on
printed ballots, which will be hand-counted.</p>
<p>In 2016, it was a North Dakota delegate who helped Trump secure the
number needed for the Republican presidential nomination.</p>
<p>He swept North Dakota’s three electoral college votes in 2016 and
2020, winning about 63% and 65% of those votes, respectively.</p>
<p>As president, Trump visited Bismarck and Mandan in 2017 to talk about
tax cuts, and he campaigned twice in Fargo in 2018 for Kevin Cramer in
the then-congressman’s successful Senate bid against Democratic
Sen. Heidi Heitkamp.</p>
<p>North Dakota’s Democratic-NPL Party is holding a presidential primary
almost entirely by mail, with mail-in voting from Feb. 20 to March 30,
and limited in-person voting for residents of Indian reservations.
President Joe Biden, Rep. Dean Phillips and six others are on the
ballot.</p>
<p>A third party will count ballots in Fargo on March 30, with results
available on the party’s website afterward.</p>
<p>Sen. Bernie Sanders won the Democratic caucuses in 2016 and 2020.</p>

<p>Vice President Kamala Harris reiterated Monday support for an
“immediate” six-week cease-fire in Gaza, meeting with a top member of
Israel’s war Cabinet as the conflict teeters on the five-month mark. But
analysts and protesters note that stopping the conflict hinges on
negotiations the Biden administration won’t discuss, and that may not
yield a deal before the White House’s stated deadline – the start of
Ramadan. VOA’s Anita Powell reports from the White House.</p>

<h2 id="us-low-iran-election-turnout-another-sign-of-discontent">US: Low
Iran Election Turnout Another Sign of ‘Discontent’</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The United States said Monday that the low turnout in
Iran’s election came as no surprise and was a new sign of discontent in
the cleric-run state.</p>
<p>“I don’t think there’s any doubt that there’s discontent about the
regime’s rule,” State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told
reporters.</p>
<p>“We did not assess that these elections would be free and fair, and I
believe that many Iranian voters would assess that the elections would
not be free and fair, and so it wouldn’t surprise me if in that regard
they chose not to participate,” he said.</p>
<p>Election authorities said Monday that conservatives and
ultra-conservatives secured a large majority in parliamentary elections
— in which many hopefuls including moderates and reformists were
disqualified from running.</p>
<p>Authorities said turnout was 41%, the lowest since the 1979 Islamic
Revolution toppled the pro-Western shah.</p>
<p>Miller said that the United States could not offer its own assessment
but added: “Iranian authorities’ claims about turnout have generally
been unreliable.”</p>

identity theft.   In early February the suspect stole a credit card from
a secured locker inside LA Fitness and then conducted fraudulent
transactions, stated a post on the SCV Sheriff’s Station’s official
Instagram.   “The suspect […]

for embedded systems: current state, challenges and open problems</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-04, from: OS News</p>
<p>Embedded software is used in safety-critical systems such as medical
devices and autonomous vehicles, where software defects, including
security vulnerabilities, have severe consequences. Most embedded
codebases are developed in unsafe languages, specifically C/C++, and are
riddled with memory safety vulnerabilities. To prevent such
vulnerabilities, RUST, a performant memory-safe systems language,
provides an optimal choice for developing embedded software. RUST
interoperability enables developing RUST applications on top of existing
C codebases. Despite this, even the most resourceful organizations
continue to develop embedded software in C/C++. This paper performs the
first systematic study to holistically understand the current state and
challenges of using RUST for embedded systems. Our study is organized
across three research questions. We collected a dataset of 2,836 RUST
embedded software spanning various categories and 5 Static Application
Security Testing ( SAST) tools. We performed a systematic analysis of
our dataset and surveys with 225 developers to investigate our research
questions. We found that existing RUST software support is inadequate,
SAST tools cannot handle certain features of RUST embedded software,
resulting in failures, and the prevalence of advanced types in existing
RUST software makes it challenging to engineer interoperable code. In
addition, we found various challenges faced by developers in using RUST
for embedded systems development. ↫ Ayushi Sharma, Shashank Sharma,

Lobbyists Drop Chinese Clients Amid Tightened Scrutiny</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — Lobbying firms in Washington are reportedly rushing to
drop clients from China as lawmakers look to tighten scrutiny. The push
comes in the wake of a surge in Chinese lobbying in recent years and
growing concerns about China’s influence.</p>
<p>U.S. lawmakers say they are promoting legislation that would provide
more transparency into who is lobbying for Chinese companies. The
legislators aim to prevent the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the
People’s Liberation Army (PLA) from using gray areas to secretly advance
policy agendas that harm the interests of the American people.</p>
<p>Republican Senator John Cornyn told VOA’s Mandarin Service last week
that lawmakers are very close to completing work on legislation that
aims to address the problem. Last year, lawmakers in the Senate passed
the disclosing Foreign Influence in Lobbying Act and members of the
House have introduced a similar bill. Cornyn was a co-sponsor of the
Senate bill.</p>
<p>“We’ve encountered some dissent but will continue to work because
it’s important to understand who is actually lobbying these
policymakers,” Cornyn said. “The primary focus has been on making sure
people register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. As you know,
there’s been a lot of problems associated with people not disclosing
their lobby contracts with foreign countries.”</p>
<p>Closing loopholes</p>
<p>In pushing legislation, lawmakers are looking to close existing
loopholes in the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938 (FARA) and the
Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 (LDA) to demand more transparency
regarding foreign governments and political parties that participate in
the planning, supervision, direction or control of lobbying efforts
regardless of whether they have made any financial contributions or
not.</p>
<p>China is a unique challenge, Cornyn noted.</p>
<p>“The Chinese are unique in that there is no true solely private
sector; they are forced to share information with the PLA and with their
intelligence agencies,” he said. “So, I would say anytime we’re dealing
with the Chinese-owned enterprise, it’s a cause for concern.”</p>
<p>U.S. lobbying is regulated by the LDA, which requires disclosure of
domestic lobbying, and FARA, which requires disclosure of lobbying and
other forms of influence by foreign governments and political parties.
However, in 1995, FARA was amended to exempt those who represent foreign
companies or individuals if the work is not intended to benefit a
foreign government or political party. As a result, lobbyists registered
under the far less transparent LDA and the result was a dramatic drop in
FARA registrations.</p>
<p>Clients dropped</p>
<p>The effort to tighten scrutiny of China’s lobbying activities follows
the U.S. Department of Defense’s release in late January of a list of
“Chinese military companies” operating directly or indirectly in the
United States known as the 1260H list.</p>
<p>Lawmakers subsequently said they were considering a measure
prohibiting lobbyists who represent companies on the list from meeting
with members of Congress, even to discuss matters on behalf of their
American clients.</p>
<p>Following the release of the 1260H list, a chart began circulating on
Capitol Hill that named various Chinese companies, including some
military firms, as well as the names of their lobbying firms and whether
they appear on the 1260H list.</p>
<p>Responding to the chart, at least five U.S. lobbying firms dropped
Chinese clients as of late February. Steptoe LLP has terminated its
contract with Shenzhen biotech company BGI. Akin Gump Strauss Hauer
&amp; Feld filed cease-and-desist documents to stop lobbying for Chinese
LiDAR maker Hesai Group and terminated its cooperation with Xiaomi, a
Chinese electronics company not on the 1260H list. The Vogel Group has
also dropped lobbying services for Chinese drone company DJI and
Complete Genomics, a subsidiary of genetic technology company BGI.</p>
<p>DJI and Hesai are both on the 1260H list. Complete Genomics is not on
the list, but its previous parent company, BGI, is on it.</p>
<p>Boycotting meetings</p>
<p>Republican Senator Marco Rubio told VOA that while it is difficult to
pass a law prohibiting members of Congress from meeting with anyone,
some congressional offices have decided not to meet with lobbying firms
representing Chinese military companies.</p>
<p>“There are just certain entities we won’t meet with because we
understand that while they may be doing it for commercial reasons, the
interests that they’re representing are linked to Chinese goals,
military goals and aspirations,” he said. “And so … we’ve made that
decision unilaterally.”</p>
<p>Robert Sutter, professor of practice of international affairs at the
Elliott School of George Washington University, said historically,
Chinese military entities’ lobbying activities have been an ambiguous
area, and the enforcement has been weak.</p>
<p>“These [companies] lobbying for these firms … it’s probably legal in
some way. But there is a reputational cost, and I think that’s what the
Congresspeople are calling attention to in saying they will boycott
these firms,” he said.</p>
<p>According to Open Secrets, a political money website, China’s
lobbying has surged in recent years. China spent more than $330 million
on lobbying between 2019 and 2023. That stands in sharp contrast to the
$60 million it spent between 2015 and 2018.</p>
<p>China’s lobbying roster</p>
<p>Craig Singleton, a senior researcher with the Foundation for Defense
of Democracies, notes up until a few years ago, Chinese corporate
lobbying in Washington was almost non-existent but that changed when the
U.S. government went after Huawei.</p>
<p>After that, “Chinese firms switched gears and quickly scaled up,
deploying lobbyists to protect their bottom lines in the face of
increasing scrutiny from Democrats and Republicans alike,” he said.
“Today, China’s lobbying roster reads like a ‘who’s who’ of Washington
insiders, from retired Pentagon brass to former high-ranking
congressional aides. The goal of these lobbying operations is simple:
disrupting any actions that could negatively impact their clients’
market share, deflecting regulatory scrutiny and defending against
sanctions.”</p>
<p>Singleton said the Department of Justice – which is responsible for
administering and enforcing FARA – could play a bigger role in curbing
the CCP’s malign lobbying influence on Capitol Hill.</p>
<p>“The U.S. Department of Justice currently mandates only two Chinese
companies, Huawei and Hikvision, to disclose their lobbying activities
under FARA, offering a comprehensive overview of their engagements,” he
said. “Despite additional Chinese firms being flagged as national
security risks by the Defense Department and FCC, the Justice Department
has not extended FARA filing requirements to these problematic entities.
The only apparent obstacle to such action is a lack of political will
within the Justice Department itself.”</p>
<p>VOA Mandarin reached out to the Department of Justice, but it
declined to comment.</p>

Apple district manager’s Macintosh Portable in 1989-91 (featuring GEIS
AppleLink and a look at System 7.0 alpha)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-04, from: OS News</p>
<p>A few months ago I introduced you to one of the more notable Apple
pre-production units in my collection, a late prototype Macintosh
Portable. But it turns out it’s not merely notable for what it is than
what it has on it: a beta version of System 6.0.6 (the doomed release
that Apple pulled due to bugs), Apple sales databases, two online
services — the maligned Mac Prodigy client, along with classic AppleLink
as used by Apple staff — and two presentations, one on Apple’s current
Macintosh line and one on the upcoming System 7. Now that I’ve got the
infamous Conner hard drive it came with safely copied over, it’s time to
explore its contents some more. ↫ Old Vintage Computing Research I
wonder just how rare it is to find old internal presentations from a
company like Apple. It seems like something that doesn’t happen very
often, so it’s great to see this archived and documented.</p>

National Guard Member Jack Teixeira Pleads Guilty to Leaking Military
Secrets</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Boston — Massachusetts Air National Guard member Jack Teixeira
pleaded guilty on Monday in federal court to leaking highly classified
military documents about Russia’s war in Ukraine and other national
security secrets.</p>
<p>Teixeira pleaded guilty to six counts of willful retention and
transmission of national defense information under the Espionage Act
nearly a year after he was arrested in the most consequential national
security leak in years.</p>
<p>The stunning breach raised alarm over America’s ability to protect
its most closely guarded secrets and forced the Biden administration to
scramble to try to contain diplomatic and military fallout. The leaks
embarrassed the Pentagon, which tightened controls to safeguard
classified information and disciplined members found to have
intentionally failed to take required action about Teixeira’s suspicious
behavior.</p>
<p>Teixeira, 22, admitted illegally collecting military secrets and
sharing them with other users on Discord, a social media platform
popular with people playing online games. Prosecutors plan to seek
nearly 17 years in prison for him, according to the plea agreement.</p>
<p>Teixeira, who was part of the 102nd Intelligence Wing at Otis Air
National Guard Base in Massachusetts, worked as a cyber transport
systems specialist, essentially an information technology specialist
responsible for military communications networks.</p>
<p>Authorities said he first typed out classified documents he accessed
and then began sharing photographs of files that bore SECRET and TOP
SECRET markings. The leak exposed to the world unvarnished secret
assessments of Russia’s war in Ukraine, the capabilities and
geopolitical interests of other nations and other national security
issues.</p>
<p>Teixeira remains in the Air National Guard in an unpaid status, an
Air Force official said.</p>
<p>Teixeira has been behind bars since his April arrest. The judge
denied his request for release from jail last year after prosecutors
revealed he had a history of violent rhetoric and warned that U.S.
adversaries who might be interested in mining Teixeira for information
could facilitate his escape.</p>
<p>Prosecutors have said little about a motive. But members of the
Discord group described Teixeira as someone looking to show off, rather
than being motivated by a desire to inform the public about U.S.
military operations or to influence American policy.</p>
<p>Prosecutors have said Teixeira continued to leak government secrets
even after he was warned by superiors about mishandling and improper
viewing of classified information. In one instance, Teixeira was seen
taking notes on intelligence information and putting them in his
pocket.</p>
<p>The Air Force inspector general found that members “intentionally
failed to report the full details” of Teixeira’s unauthorized
intelligence-seeking because they thought security officials might
overreact. For example, while Teixeira was confronted about the notes,
there was no follow-up to ensure the notes had been shredded and the
incident was not reported to security officers.</p>
<p>It was not until a January 2023 incident that the appropriate
security officials were notified, but even then security officials were
not briefed on the full scope of the violations.</p>

id="former-trump-cfo-pleads-guilty-to-perjury-in-ex-presidents-civil-fraud-case">Former
Trump CFO Pleads Guilty to Perjury in Ex-President’s Civil Fraud
Case</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Allen Weisselberg, the former chief financial officer of
Donald Trump’s company, pleaded guilty Monday in New York to perjury in
connection with testimony he gave in the ex-president’s civil fraud
case. </p>
<p>Weisselberg, 76, pleaded guilty to two counts of perjury and will be
sentenced to five months in jail — which would be his second stint
behind bars after 100 days last year in an unrelated tax fraud
case. </p>
<p>The pleas related to testimony he gave at a July 2020 deposition in
New York Attorney General Letitia James’ case against Trump, but in
court Monday he also admitted, without pleading guilty, to lying on the
witness stand at the former president’s civil fraud trial last
fall. </p>
<p>Prosecutors accused Weisselberg of lying under oath in the case about
allegations that Trump lied about his wealth on financial statements
given to banks and insurance companies. </p>
<p>“Allen Weisselberg looks forward to putting this situation behind
him,” his lawyer Seth Rosenberg said in a statement. </p>
<p>After The New York Times reported last month that Weisselberg was in
negotiations to plead guilty to perjury, Judge Arthur Engoron, who
presided over the fraud trial, ordered attorneys to provide details
related to the Times’ report. </p>
<p>Trump is appealing Engoron’s judgment ordering him to pay more than
$454 million in fines and interest for submitting fraudulent information
about his asset values on years of financial records. </p>
<p>Weisselberg’s new criminal case comes just weeks before Trump is
scheduled to stand trial on separate allegations that he falsified
business records. That case involves allegations that Trump falsified
company records to cover up hush money payments made during the 2016
campaign to bury allegations that he had extramarital sexual encounters.
Trump has pleaded not guilty and denies wrongdoing. </p>
<p>Former Trump lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen has said Weisselberg had
a role in orchestrating the payments, but he has not been charged in
that case, and neither prosecutors nor Trump’s lawyers have indicated
they will call him as a witness. That trial is scheduled to begin March
25. </p>
<p>Weisselberg’s case is separate from the criminal case that Manhattan
District Attorney Alvin Bragg brought against Trump last year. </p>
<p>Weisselberg previously served 100 days in jail last year after
pleading guilty to dodging taxes on $1.7 million in off-the-books
compensation from the Trump Organization. He is still on probation.
Prior to that he had no criminal record. </p>
<p>He left New York City’s notorious Rikers Island in April, days after
Trump was indicted in his New York hush money criminal case. </p>
<p>Under that plea deal, Weisselberg was required to testify as a
prosecution witness when the Trump Organization was put on trial for
helping executives evade taxes. He did so carefully, laying out the
facts of his own involvement in evading taxes but taking care not to
implicate Trump, telling jurors that his boss was unaware of the
scheme</p>

Slaps Sanctions on Zimbabwe Leadership, Citing Abuses</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The United States on Monday imposed sanctions on
Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa and other senior leaders,
denouncing what it said was a campaign of rights abuses and
corruption. </p>
<p>The sanctions, which will block any U.S.-based property and block any
unofficial travel to the United States, replace a broader,
two-decade-old sanctions program against Zimbabwe. </p>
<p>“The changes we are making today are intended to make clear what has
always been true: our sanctions are not intended to target the people of
Zimbabwe,” Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo said. </p>
<p>“We are refocusing our sanctions on clear and specific targets:
President Mnangagwa’s criminal network of government officials and
businesspeople who are most responsible for corruption or human rights
abuse against the people of Zimbabwe,” he said. </p>
<p>Secretary of State Antony Blinken called the new measures were part
of a “stronger, more targeted sanctions policy” on Zimbabwe as he voiced
concern over “serious cases of corruption and human rights abuse.” </p>
<p>“Key individuals, including members of the government of Zimbabwe,
bear responsibility for these actions, including the looting of
government coffers that robs Zimbabweans of public resources,” Blinken
said in a statement. </p>
<p>“Multiple cases of abductions, physical abuse, and unlawful killing
have left citizens living in fear.” </p>
<p>Mnangagwa, whose party has been in power for more than four decades,
was declared the winner of a new term in an election in August that
international observers said fell short of democratic standards. </p>
<p>He is the second consecutive Zimbabwean leader to face U.S. sanctions
following veteran president Robert Mugabe. </p>
<p>Hopes of a thaw briefly surfaced after Mnangagwa pushed Mugabe out of
power in 2017, but Western powers and rights groups say that the new
leadership has also clamped down on the opposition and protests.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden in a declaration on Monday ended an earlier
sanctions program on Zimbabwe imposed in 2003 under George W. Bush, who
had advocated for a broader global push of sanctions on the country
under Mugabe.</p>

<h2 id="indieweb-carnival-accessibility-in-the-small-web">IndieWeb
Carnival: Accessibility in the Small Web</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-04, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<p>
This is my entry for
<a href="https://blog.basementcommunity.com/accessibility-in-the-personal-web/">this
month’s IndieWeb Carnival</a> hosted by
<a href="https://blog.basementcommunity.com">Orchids</a> on the topic of
Accessibility in the Small Web
</p>
<hr />
<p>
I started making websites back in 2010. That’s 14 years. I entered the
web dev world back when the frontend scene was starting to become
exciting thanks to CSS3 and HTML5. Shadows, rounded corners, custom
typefaces! Everything was exciting. Also, new tags! I remember spending
time reading about <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>,
<code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, and all the
new things at my disposal. But I never thought about spending time
learning about what all this meant in terms of accessibility.
</p>
<p>
I worked solo my entire career. I still do. I have to wear a thousand
different hats on a daily basis and keeping up with the web as a whole
is a full-time job. And it’s only recently that I started to realize how
much I neglected accessibility when it comes to my sites.
</p>
<p>
Don’t get me wrong, I still try to follow at least some best practices:
I try to pick combinations of colors that have enough contrast, and I
try to structure my documents in a way that makes sense for screen
readers but I’m painfully aware how much my knowledge on the topic is
lacking.
</p>
<p>
These days I find myself hating on the “modern web”. I can’t stand sites
that don’t load if I block some JS. I can’t stand sits that highjack my
scroll. I hate that everything is getting more and more performative and
less functional.
</p>
<p>
And in my retreat towards a simpler and more streamlined web, I’m
rediscovering the pleasure of making sites that are simple and more
accessible.
</p>
<p>
Accessibility becomes easier when sites are simpler. Still, I think I
can and should do better which is why I have my eyes set on
<a href="https://www.sarasoueidan.com">Sara Soueidan</a>’s
<a href="https://practical-accessibility.today">Practical
Accessibility</a> course (only waiting to have 400$ to invest).
</p>
<p>
It’s a shame that so much of the web has become an unusable mess. At the
same time though, it’s refreshing to see that a good chunk of the small
web seems to be heading in the right direction: simpler websites, less
complicated and more focused layouts.

look… virtually identical to their predecessors. But under the hood the
new MacBook Air 13 and MacBook Air 15 pack a few significant upgrades

performance. The new MacBook Air 13 is up for pre-order […]

O’Connor’s Estate Tells Trump: ‘Stop Playing Her Music at Rallies’</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LONDON — The estate of Sinead O’Connor asked Donald Trump Monday not
to play her music at campaign rallies, saying the late singer considered
the former president a “biblical devil.”</p>
<p>Trump has played O’Connor’s biggest hit, “Nothing Compares 2 U,” at
events as he campaigns for the Republican presidential nomination.</p>
<p>In a joint statement, O’Connor’s estate and her record label,
Chrysalis, demanded Trump “desist from using her music immediately.”</p>
<p>It said the Irish singer, who died last year aged 56, “lived by a
fierce moral code defined by honesty, kindness, fairness and decency
towards her fellow human beings.”</p>
<p>“It was with outrage therefore that we learned that Donald Trump has
been using her iconic performance of Nothing Compares 2 U at his
political rallies,” the statement said.</p>
<p>“It is no exaggeration to say that Sinead would have been disgusted,
hurt and insulted to have her work misrepresented in this way by someone
who she herself referred to as a ‘biblical devil.’ As the guardians of
her legacy, we demand that Donald Trump and his associates desist from
using her music immediately.”</p>
<p>Fiery and outspoken, O’Connor was a critic of the Roman Catholic
Church well before  </p>
<p>allegations of sexual abuse were widely reported, and she was open
about her mental health struggles.</p>
<p>She was found unresponsive at her London home in July and pronounced
dead at the scene. A coroner ruled that she died of natural causes.</p>
<p>O’Connor joins a growing list of artists who have objected to Trump
using their songs, including Rihanna, Neil Young, Linkin Park, the late
Tom Petty and Aerosmith’s Steven Tyler.</p>

foreign programming and live sports. Also on the show: unpacking what’s
included in the the latest government spending bills and explaining the
European Union’s $2 billion Apple fine.

<strong></strong>This week marks the end of an era in climate diplomacy:
John Kerry, the first special presidential envoy for climate, is leaving
government. On Wednesday he’ll hand the reins to White House senior
advisor John Podesta, though Kerry plans to stay involved in the global
fight against climate change on a less formal level. “The reason that
I’ve decided to transition from this job is not because we’re finished,”
he

the <em>Financial Times</em>. “But as U.S. envoy, I’m presently
responsible for the U.S. position, for what we’re doing here. If I’m out
there as a citizen, I’m able to work with whoever I choose to work with
in order to help accelerate this [transition away from fossil fuels].”
Specifically, he plans to focus on securing more funding for the energy
transition, having

were hampered by warm temperatures and strong winds. It has so far
burned more than 1 million acres and is the largest fire in the state’s
history. Two people are known to have died in the blaze. On top of the
threat to human life is the danger posed to the millions of cattle that
graze in the Texas Panhandle. The fire has scorched grassland and left
farmers without food or water for their herds.

explains how BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is carefully
continuing a climate investing strategy while simultaneously attempting
to sidestep ESG backlash. The company has stopped trying to change how
companies behave, talking about social issues, or fussing over criteria
for responsible investing. Instead it’s betting on clean-energy
infrastructure projects that will speed the transition away from fossil
fuels, a strategy it calls “transition investing.” ESG was too vague,
sources said, and failed to outpace the market or prove good for the
planet. Meanwhile, private renewable-energy and broad energy-sector
investment funds have raised nearly $500 billion over the last five
years “and dwarfed the amount raised for traditional fossil-fuel funds,”
the <em>Journal</em> reported. “The mega infrastructure projects are the
new ESG,” said Peter McKillop, a former spokesman at BlackRock.
“Energy-transition infrastructure — Wall Street loves this because it’s

global oil and gas infrastructure using a high-resolution infrared
sensor. It can see how much methane is leaking, where it’s coming from,
and whether a leak is getting better (or worse) over time. The team will
analyze the data using cloud computing and Google-developed AI
technology, and then release the findings to the public, with the hopes
of fostering greater accountability from the offenders. But, “there’s no

The real problem with anonymity (04 Mar 2024)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-04, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links The real problem with anonymity: The banal anonymity of
evil. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history:
2004, 2009, 2014, 2019, 2023 Upcoming appearances: Where to find me.
Recent appearances: Podcasts, events and more. Latest books: You keep
readin’ em, I’ll keep writin’ ‘em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I’ll
keep writin’ ‘em. Colophon: All the rest. The real problem with
anonymity (permalink) According to “the greater internet fuckwad
theory,” the ills of the internet can be traced to anonymity: Normal
Person + Anonymity + Audience = Total Fuckwad
https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/greater-internet-fuckwad-theory This
isn’t merely wrong, it’s dangerously wrong. The idea that forcing people
to identify themselves online will improve discourse is demonstrably
untrue. Facebook famously adopted its “real names” policy because Mark
Zuckerberg claimed to believe that “Having two identities for yourself
is an example of a lack of integrity”:
https://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2010/05/14/facebook-and-radical-transparency-a-rant.html
In service to this claimed belief, Zuckerberg kicked off the “nym wars,”
turning himself into the sole arbiter of what each person’s true name
was, with predictably tragicomic consequences:
https://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names/
Facebook is, famously, one of the internet’s most polluted reservoirs of
toxic interpersonal conduct. That’s not despite the fact that people
have to use their “real” names to participate there, but because of it.
After all, the people who are most vulnerable to bullying and harassment
are the ones who choose pseudonyms or anonymity so that they can speak
freely. Forcing people to use their “real names” means that the most
powerful bullies speak with impunity, and their victims are faced with
the choice of retreat or being targeted offline. This can be a matter of
life and death. Cambodian dictator Hun Sen uses Facebook’s real names
policy to force dissidents to unmask themselves, which exposes them to
arbitrary detention, torture, and extrajudicial killing. For members of
the Cambodian diaspora, the choice is to unmask themselves or expose
their family back home to retaliation:
https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/meghara/facebook-cambodia-democracy
Some of the biggest internet fuckwads I’ve ever met – and I’ve met some
big ones! – were utterly unashamed about using their real names. Some of
the nicest people I know online have never told me their offline names.
Greater internet fuckwad theory is just plain wrong. But that doesn’t
mean that anonymity is totally harmless. There is a category of person
who reliably uses a certain, specific kind of anonymity to do vicious
things that inflicts serious harm on whole swathes of people: corporate
bullies. Take Tinyletter. Tinyletter is a beloved newsletter app that
was created to help people who just wanted to talk to others, without a
thought to going viral or getting rich. It was sold to Mailchimp, which
was sold to Intuit, who killed it:
https://www.theverge.com/24085737/tinyletter-mailchimp-shut-down-email-newsletters
Tinyletter was a perfect little gem of a service. It cost almost nothing
to run, and made an enormous number of peoples’ lives better every day.
Shutting it down was an act of corporate depravity by some faceless
Intuit manager who woke up one day and said “Fuck all those people. Just
fuck them.” No one knows who that person was. That person will never
have to look those people in the eyes – those people whose lives were
made poorer for that Intuit executive’s indifference. That person is the
greater fuckwad, and that fuckwaddery depends on their anonymity. Or
take Pixsy, a corporate shakedown outfit that helps copyleft trolls
trick people into making tiny errors in Creative Commons attributions
and then intimidates them into handing over thousands of dollars:
https://pluralistic.net/2022/01/24/a-bug-in-early-creative-commons-licenses-has-enabled-a-new-breed-of-superpredator/
Copyleft trolling is an absolutely depraved practice, a petty grift
practiced by greedy fuckwads who are completely indifferent to the harm
they cause – even if it means bankrupting volunteer-run nonprofits for a
buck:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/02/commafuckers-versus-the-commons/
Pixsy claims that it is proud of its work “defending artists’ rights,”
but when I named the personnel who signed their names to these
profoundly unethical legal threats, Pixsy CEO Kain Jones threatened to
sue me:
https://pluralistic.net/2022/02/13/an-open-letter-to-pixsy-ceo-kain-jones-who-keeps-sending-me-legal-threats/
The expectation of corporate anonymity runs deep and the press is
surprisingly complicit. I once spent weeks working on an investigative
story about a multinational corporation’s practices. I spent hours on
the phone with the company’s VP of communications, over the course of
many calls. When we were done, they said, “Now, of course, you can’t
name me in the article. All of that has to be attributed to ‘a
spokesperson.’” I was baffled. Nothing this person said was a secret.
They weren’t blowing the whistle. They weren’t leaking secrets. They
were a corporate official, telling me the official corporate line. But
they wouldn’t sign their name to it. I wrote an article about for the
Guardian. It was the only Guardian column any of my editors there ever
rejected, in more than a decade of writing for them:
https://memex.craphound.com/2012/05/14/anodyne-anonymity/ Given the
press’s deference to this anodyne anonymity, it’s no wonder that
official spokespeople expect this kind of anonymity. I routinely receive
emails from corporate spokespeople disputing my characterization of
their employer’s conduct, but insisting that I not attribute their
dubious – and often blatantly false – statements to them by name. These
are the greater corporate fuckwads, who commit their sins from behind a
veil of anonymity. That brand of bloodless viciousness, depravity and
fraud absolutely depends on anonymity. Mark Zuckerberg claimed that
“multiple identities” enabled bad behavior – as though it was somehow
healthy for people to relate to their bosses, lovers, parents, toddlers
and barbers in exactly the same way. Zuckerberg’s motivation was utterly
transparent: having “multiple identities” doesn’t mean you “lack
integrity” – it just makes it harder to target you for ads. But
Zuckerberg couldn’t enshittify Facebook on his own. For that, he relies
on a legion of anonymous Facebook managers. Some of these people
undoubtably speak up for Facebook users’ interests when their colleagues
propose putting them in harm’s way for the sake of some arbitrary KPI.
But the ones who are making those mean little decisions? They absolutely
rely on anonymity to do their dirty work. Hey look at this (permalink)

Fined Nearly $2 Billion by EU Over Music Streaming Competition</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>London — The European Union leveled its first antitrust penalty
against Apple on Monday, fining the U.S. tech giant nearly $2 billion
for breaking the bloc’s competition laws by unfairly favoring its own
music streaming service over rivals.</p>
<p>Apple banned app developers from “fully informing iOS users about
alternative and cheaper music subscription services outside of the app,”
said the European Commission, the 27-nation bloc’s executive arm and top
antitrust enforcer.</p>
<p>“This is illegal, and it has impacted millions of European
consumers,” Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s competition commissioner, said
at a news conference.</p>
<p>Apple behaved this way for almost a decade, which meant many users
paid “significantly higher prices for music streaming subscriptions,”
the commission said.</p>
<p>The 1.8 billion-euro fine follows a long-running investigation
triggered by a complaint from Swedish streaming service Spotify five
years ago.</p>
<p>The EU has led global efforts to crack down on Big Tech companies,
including a series of multbillion-dollar fines for Google and charging
Meta with distorting the online classified ad market. The commission
also has opened a separate antitrust investigation into Apple’s mobile
payments service.</p>
<p>Apple hit back at both the commission and Spotify, saying it would
appeal the penalty.</p>
<p>“The decision was reached despite the Commission’s failure to uncover
any credible evidence of consumer harm, and ignores the realities of a
market that is thriving, competitive, and growing fast,” the company
said in a statement.</p>
<p>It said Spotify stood to benefit from the decision, asserting that
the Swedish streaming service that holds a 56% share of Europe’s music
streaming market and doesn’t pay Apple for using its App Store met 65
times with the commission over eight years.</p>
<p>“Ironically, in the name of competition, today’s decision just
cements the dominant position of a successful European company that is
the digital music market’s runaway leader,” Apple said.</p>
<p>The commission’s investigation initially centered on two concerns.
One was the iPhone maker’s practice of forcing app developers that are
selling digital content to use its in-house payment system, which
charges a 30% commission on all subscriptions.</p>
<p>But the EU later dropped that to focus on how Apple prevents app
makers from telling their users about cheaper ways to pay for
subscriptions that don’t involve going through an app.</p>
<p>The investigation found that Apple banned streaming services from
telling users about how much subscription offers cost outside of their
apps, including links in their apps to pay for alternative subscriptions
or even emailing users to tell them about different pricing options.</p>
<p>The fine comes the same week that new EU rules are set to kick in
that are aimed at preventing tech companies from dominating digital
markets.</p>
<p>The Digital Markets Act, due to take effect Thursday, imposes a set
of do’s and don’ts on “gatekeeper” companies including Apple, Meta,
Google parent Alphabet, and TikTok parent ByteDance — under threat of
hefty fines.</p>
<p>The DMA’s provisions are designed to prevent tech giants from the
sort of behavior that’s at the heart of the Apple investigation. Apple
has already revealed how it will comply, including allowing iPhone users
in Europe to use app stores other than its own and enabling developers
to offer alternative payment systems.</p>
<p>The commission also has opened a separate antitrust investigation
into Apple’s mobile payments service, and the company has promised to
open up its tap-and-go mobile payment system to rivals in order to
resolve it.</p>

<p>date: 2024-03-04, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
Regional lender New York Community Bancorp has already had a rocky year
so far and recently replaced its CEO following revelations of “material
weaknesses.” NYCB acquired nearly $40 billion in assets last year from
the failing Signature Bank, and that rapid growth can make it hard for
internal controls to keep up. Also, a federal judge in Alabama struck
down an anti-money-laundering law. And interest rates aren’t included in
inflation calculations. What gives?

Researchers have

a worm that spreads through prompt injection.
<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/here-come-the-ai-worms/">Details</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
In one instance, the researchers, acting as attackers, wrote an email
including the adversarial text prompt, which “poisons” the database of
an email assistant using
<a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation/">retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG)</a>, a way for LLMs to pull in extra data from outside
its system. When the email is retrieved by the RAG, in response to a
user query, and is sent to GPT-4 or Gemini Pro to create an answer, it
“jailbreaks the GenAI service” and ultimately steals data from the
emails, Nassi says. “The generated response containing the sensitive
user data later infects new hosts when it is used to reply to an email
sent to a new client and then stored in the database of the new client,”
Nassi says…

<h2 id="a-carbon-tax-is-back-on-the-table">A Carbon Tax Is Back on the
Table</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-04, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
Climate policy has been all over the place lately thanks to pressure
from interest groups, pre-election jitters, and the plausibility of a
re-elected President Donald Trump
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-climate-change-project-2025" target="_blank">laying
waste</a> to existing climate policy.
</p>
<p>
But further in the future, beyond the ups and downs of electoral
politics, there’s a policy cataclysm coming that, some hope, could
create an opening for that long sought, always denied dream of climate
policy: the carbon tax.
</p>
<p>
Let’s back up. There are two things happening that might free up this
policy space, one domestic, and the other overseas. At the end of 2025,
much of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, otherwise known as
<a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R47846" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the
Trump tax cuts</a>, will expire, including several provisions that many
in Congress will want to extend, including lower income tax rates, a
higher standard deduction and personal exemption, and an expanded child
tax credit.
</p>
<p>
At the same time, much of the revenue that helped pay for those tax cuts
— such as limitations on deductions for mortgage interest and state and
local taxes — will also expire.
</p>
<p>
Measures that reduce taxes tend to be popular and those that raise them
tend
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214629620304588" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">not
to be</a>, and that’s as true with the Trump tax cuts as with anything.
(Since basically the day the TCJA passed, there’s been intense
bipartisan opposition to the limitation on deductions for state and
local taxes, for example.) That they’re expiring all at the same time
will create a policy free for all.
</p>
<p>
And just as the Trump tax cuts expire, the European Union’s Carbon
Border Adjustment Mechanism will come into full effect in January 2026,
complementing its existing cap-and-trade and carbon pricing system.
Essentially, CBAM is a tariff on imports from countries that don’t price
carbon the same way the EU does, and it’s designed to prevent what’s
known as “leakage,” where producers in countries with a carbon price
simply offshore emissions-intensive production to countries that don’t.
(It also helps make sure those products from other countries aren’t able
to undercut domestic producers on price, a facet of the policy some have
pooh-poohed as
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/cop28-brazil-eu-carbon-tax" target="_blank">protectionist</a>.)
</p>
<p>
Starting last year, EU trading partners had to begin reporting the
carbon content of some emissions-intensive exports in preparations for
payments starting in 2026. One of those trading partners is the United
States, which exports some
<a href="https://ustr.gov/countries-regions#:~:text=The%20top%20five%20purchasers%20of,United%20Kingdom%20(%2476.2%20billion)." target="_blank">$351
billion worth of goods</a> to the EU, second only to Canada.
</p>
<p>
Bills that would just address the carbon price gap have been proposed
several times in the current Congress, including by climate stalwart and
Democrat from Rhode Island, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, plus some
Republicans who think America should get an
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/foreign-pollution-fee-act-of-2023-lindsey-graham-bill-cassidy" target="_blank">advantage
over China</a> for having a less carbon-intensive manufacturing sector.
</p>
<p>
This all creates a kind of celestial alignment in favor of a policy that
has been rejected so many times (RIP the 2009 cap-and-trade bill and
Bill Clinton’s BTU Tax) — or at least that’s what its advocates hope.
Based on the history of carbon taxation and related polices, you might
be pessimistic. But we haven’t seen a year like 2025.
</p>
<p>
“If you think about carbon price relative to raising people’s income
taxes, when you put it in the whole fiscal conversation that’s going to
happen in 2025, it’s going to look more attractive,” Catherine Wolfram,
a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist and former Treasury
official in the Biden administration, told me. Wolfram was also one of
the authors of a paper released last week by the Brookings Institution’s
Hamilton Project
<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/20240227_THP_ClimateTaxPaper.pdf" target="_blank">mapping
out how various climate policies</a> could emerge from the witch’s brew
of TCJA expiring and carbon tariffs would actually effect U.S.
emissions.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The paper concluded that of the seven 2025 climate policy options they
considered — including doing nothing to the IRA and enacting planned new
emissions rules, doing nothing to the IRA with no new emissions rules,
repealing the IRA, expanding the IRA tax credits for clean electricity,
instituting a carbon fee starting at $15 a ton, instituting a clean
electricity standard that would mandate a certain portion of electricity
be produced from non-carbon-emitting sources with fees for
noncompliance, and a carbon fee along with repealing some parts of the
IRA — the carbon fee and the clean electricity standard would bring
emissions down by the most, just missing the stated 2030 target.
</p>
<p>
And that’s just U.S. emissions. Wolfram said that if the U.S. were to
institute a carbon fee, it would be a major step towards a worldwide
carbon price, as countries would want to avoid paying fees to both the
U.S. <em>and</em> Europe for pollution-intensive exports. “The more
countries that get in this game,” Wolfram said, “the more powerful that
policy can be.”
</p>
<p>
Whitehouse spoke at a Brookings event last week, saying, “We’ll find out
a lot when people start getting tariffed through the European Union
CBAM,” and that even Republicans were “pricing curious” due to the
specter of carbon tariffs. “The forces are converging on making that
work,” he added about the idea of finally getting a carbon price of our
own.
</p>
<p>
Wolfram is also — cautiously — optimistic. “We haven’t tried since 2009.
That’s 15 years ago,” she said. “The climate continues to change, and
it’s changed pretty dramatically in the last 15 years. I don’t think we
should have too many conclusions about what’s possible.”
</p>
<p>

Whitehouse is a Senator from Rhode Island.</em><br/>

<h2 id="march-3-2024-1">March 3, 2024</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-04, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog</p>
<p>This week seems likely to be packed with news. Today, Vice President
Kamala Harris spoke about the crisis in the Middle East with strong
words for both Hamas and Israel, calling for a ceasefire of at least six
weeks, the return of hostages, and increased aid to the Palestinians.
Such a deal is on the table. According to the U.S., Israel has agreed to
it, and negotiators are waiting for a response from Hamas leaders.</p>

<h2 id="ear-cuffs">Ear Cuffs</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-04, from: Jessica Smith’s blog</p>
<p>
For a while now, I’ve been enamoured with a certain style of ear
jewellery demonstrated here by Jodie Whittaker as the Doctor:

Basically, jewellery that spans the whole height of the ear! I love it.
I never looked into it too seriously for myself, because I presumed
jewellery like this required multiple piercings, and currently I have
<em>zero</em> piercings (not out of any opposition to them, I’ve just
never gone out of my way to do the research that’d be required to get
any). However, yesterday I decided to finally look it up.
</p>
<p>
I discovered that this whole-ear-spanning jewellery is a variety of
<b>ear cuff</b>, and that actually, ear cuffs don’t necessarily require
any piercings at all! (Although Jodie Whittaker’s specific ear cuff
<em>does</em> require a piercing through the earlobe.) The idea is that
they sit tight around the ear, being shaped to closely hug the contours.
They could hardly be more perfect for me!
</p>
<p>
So, I’ve been browsing Etsy and found that

<p>
(Note: this post is not an ad; having not even ordered anything yet, I
can’t even really vouch for this seller at all. This is just a post of
enthusiasm for ear jewellery.) Basically, I think this style would suit
me well because, as you can see from my photo on
<a href="https://www.jayeless.net/">this site’s front page</a>, I tend
to tuck the hair on the left side of my head behind my ear at all times
(somewhat like Jodie Whittaker does as the Doctor, in fact). I’ve always
been a bit self-conscious about this habit because the ear is a bit
flattened compared to a “normal ear”, and when I was a little kid my mum
used to chastise me for “exposing” it to people, as if my very ear were
obscene or something. I was <em>certainly</em> never allowed to get my
ears pierced, because that would only “draw attention to [my]
deformity”. I mean, I thought she was full of shit even at the time, but
after getting scolded so much I can’t help but be hyperaware of it,
either. As an adult, of course, I feel she had completely the wrong end
of it. For a start, you shouldn’t feel ashamed of your natural body in
the first place. But secondly, if you really want to do something, the
way to go is <strong>attention-grabbing accessories</strong>, so what
sticks in people’s mind is how <em>cool</em> your sense of style is. No
one’s going to give a fuck about a mildly flattened ear when there’s an
awesome ear cuff wrapped around it. Nobody.
</p>
<p>
Given the tightness of our budget lately, it’s hard not to feel a little
guilty about spending on something inessential like jewellery… but
Vivian doesn’t share the same reservations about spending, and it’s
unfair if I’m the <em>only</em> one making sacrifices. I still want to
mull it over a bit – narrow it down to <em>one</em> design to buy
initially, and see how it goes – but overall I think these look cool. I
want them!

id="bill-to-fund-us-government-includes-money-to-counter-china-in-pacific">Bill
to Fund US Government Includes Money to Counter China in Pacific</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. congressional negotiators released a bill Sunday
that would fund key parts of the government through the rest of the
fiscal year, which began in October 2023.</p>
<p>Among provisions in the appropriations package are critical funds to
counter China in the Pacific as part of an agreement signed last year
called the Compacts of Free Association, or COFA.</p>
<p>Under the compacts, Micronesia, Palau and the Marshall Islands will
receive $7 billion in economic aid over 20 years. In exchange,
Washington will provide for their defense and can deny China access to
their territorial waters, a maritime area larger than the continental
United States.</p>
<p>The United States has had similar agreements in effect with
Micronesia and the Marshalls since 1986 and with Palau since 1994.
Citizens from these nations are allowed to travel, live and work in the
United States as nonimmigrants.</p>
<p>Congresswoman Aumua Amata Coleman Radewagen, who represents the U.S.
territory of American Samoa, told VOA on Sunday that House Speaker Mike
Johnson reached her early Saturday morning to deliver the news.</p>
<p>Radewagen said she then called the presidents of the three Pacific
allies to share the details.</p>
<p>“The COFA agreements send a clear message of U.S. commitment to the
Pacific region and take a much-needed international strong stand for the
ideals of democracy and freedom,” she told VOA in an email.</p>
<p>Senator Mazie Hirono, a Hawaii Democrat who has long supported the
full funding of the agreement, issued a statement Sunday night.</p>
<p>“As we work to counter China’s growing influence in the Pacific,
these agreements are extremely important for our national security and
that of our allies, and also for the tens of thousands of COFA citizens
who live, work and pay taxes in the U.S.,” she said.</p>
<p>The move comes after 26 senators, including Senators Joe Manchin, a
Democrat, and John Barrasso, a Republican, urged Senate leadership to
include the language that had previously been dropped from a Senate
security spending bill on Feb. 12.</p>
<p>“Failure to act on COFA opens the door to more corrupting influence
and funding by the PRC in the region,” wrote the senators, using an
acronym for the People’s Republic of China.</p>
<p>Pacific Island leaders remain cautious.</p>
<p>President Hilda Heine of the Marshall Islands spoke to a Remembrance
Day for victims and survivors of nuclear testing on March 1, the 70th
anniversary of the U.S. nuclear test on Bikini Atoll.</p>
<p>“Our nation has been a steadfast ally of the United States, but that
should not be taken for granted,” she told the audience, according to
the news site Islands Business.</p>
<p>Palau President Surangel Whipps, Jr. told VOA:</p>
<p>“We are heartened that the leaders of both houses of Congress and the
White House have reached a consensus on the legislation slated for
action this week. We thank our friends in both parties for their
continued support and partnership.”</p>
<p>U.S. lawmakers face another threat of a partial shutdown if they fail
to act by midnight Friday.</p>
<p>House Speaker Johnson has said he will bring the compromise bill to
the floor for a full house vote on Wednesday.</p>

id="netanyahu-rival-visits-us-signals-wider-cracks-in-israels-wartime-leadership">Netanyahu
Rival Visits US, Signals Wider Cracks in Israel’s Wartime
Leadership</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Tel Aviv, Israel — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rebuked a top
Cabinet minister arriving in Washington on Sunday for talks with U.S.
officials, according to an Israeli official, signaling widening cracks
within the country’s leadership nearly five months into its war with
Hamas.</p>
<p>The trip by Benny Gantz, a centrist political rival who joined
Netanyahu’s wartime Cabinet following Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack, comes as
friction between the U.S. and Netanyahu is rising over how to alleviate
the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza and what the postwar plan for the
enclave should look like.</p>
<p>An official from Netanyahu’s far-right Likud party said Gantz’s trip
was planned without authorization from the Israeli leader. The official,
who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Netanyahu had a “tough
talk” with Gantz and told him the country has “just one prime
minister.”</p>
<p>Gantz is scheduled to meet Monday with U.S. Vice President Kamala
Harris and national security adviser Jake Sullivan and Tuesday with
Secretary of State Antony Blinken, according to his National Unity
Party. A second Israeli official speaking on the condition of anonymity
said Gantz’s visit is intended to strengthen ties with the U.S., bolster
support for Israel’s war and push for the release of Israeli
hostages.</p>
<p>In Egypt, talks were underway to broker a cease-fire before the
Muslim holy month of Ramadan begins next week.</p>
<p>Israel did not send a delegation because it is waiting for answers
from Hamas on two questions, according to a third Israeli government
official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Israeli media reported
that the government is waiting to learn which hostages are alive and how
many Palestinian prisoners Hamas seeks in exchange for each.</p>
<p>All three Israeli officials spoke anonymously because they weren’t
authorized to discuss the disputes with the media.</p>
<p>The U.S. began airdrops of aid into Gaza on Saturday, after dozens of
Palestinians rushing to grab food from an Israel-organized convoy were
killed last week. The airdrops circumvented an aid delivery system
hobbled by Israeli restrictions, logistical issues and fighting in Gaza.
Aid officials say airdrops are far less effective than deliveries by
truck.</p>
<p>U.S. priorities in the region have increasingly been hampered by
Netanyahu’s Cabinet, which is dominated by ultranationalists. Gantz’s
more moderate party at times acts as a counterweight.</p>
<p>Netanyahu’s popularity has dropped since the war broke out, according
to most opinion polls. Many Israelis hold him responsible for failing to
stop the Oct. 7 cross-border terror attack by Hamas, which killed 1,200
people, mostly civilians, and took roughly 250 people as hostages into
Gaza, including women, children and older adults, according to Israeli
authorities.</p>
<p>More than 30,000 Palestinians have been killed since the war began,
around two-thirds of them women and children, according to the Hamas-run
Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and
fighters. Around 80% of the population of 2.3 million have fled their
homes, and U.N. agencies say hundreds of thousands are on the brink of
famine.</p>
<p>Israelis critical of Netanyahu say his decision-making has been
tainted by political considerations, a charge he denies. The criticism
is particularly focused on plans for postwar Gaza. Netanyahu wants
Israel to maintain open-ended security control over Gaza, with
Palestinians running civilian affairs.</p>
<p>The U.S. wants to see progress on the creation of a Palestinian
state, envisioning a revamped Palestinian leadership running Gaza with
an eye toward eventual statehood.</p>
<p>That vision is opposed by Netanyahu and the hard-liners in his
government. Another top Cabinet official from Gantz’s party has
questioned the handling of the war and the strategy for freeing the
hostages.</p>
<p>Netanyahu’s government, Israel’s most conservative and religious
ever, has also been rattled by a court-ordered deadline for a new bill
to broaden military enlistment of ultra-Orthodox Jews. Many of them are
exempt from military service so they can pursue religious studies.
Hundreds of Israeli soldiers have been killed since Oct. 7, and the
military is looking to fill its ranks.</p>
<p>Gantz has remained vague about his view of Palestinian statehood.
Polls show he would earn enough support to become prime minister if a
vote were held today.</p>
<p>A visit to the U.S., if met with progress on the hostage front, could
further boost Gantz’s support.</p>
<p>Israel and Hamas are negotiating over a possible new cease-fire and
hostage release deal. Vice President Harris said Sunday it is now up to
Hamas to agree to it. “Given the immense scale of suffering in Gaza,
there must be an immediate cease-fire for at least the next six weeks,
which is what is currently on the table,” Harris said.</p>
<p>Israelis, deeply traumatized by Hamas’ attack, have broadly backed
the war effort as an act of self-defense, even as global opposition to
the fighting has increased.</p>
<p>But a growing number are expressing their dismay with Netanyahu. Some
10,000 people protested late Saturday to call for early elections,
according to Israeli media. Such protests have grown in recent weeks but
remain much smaller than last year’s demonstrations against the
government’s judicial overhaul plan.</p>
<p>If the political rifts grow and Gantz quits the government, the
floodgates will open to broader protests by a public that was already
unhappy with the government when Hamas struck, said Reuven Hazan, a
professor of political science at Hebrew University in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>At least 12 people were killed, including five women and two
children, in an Israeli strike Sunday that hit a house in the Nuseirat
refugee camp in central Gaza, according to an Associated Press
journalist at Al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir al-Balah. And two Israeli strikes
southwest of Deir al-Balah killed at least five people and destroyed an
aid truck, according to witnesses and staff at the hospital.</p>
<p>Amid concerns about the wider regional conflict, White House senior
adviser Amos Hochstein was going to Lebanon on Monday to meet officials,
according to an administration official who was not authorized to
comment. White House officials want Lebanese and Israeli officials to
prevent tensions along their border from worsening.</p>

id="congressional-leaders-come-out-with-6-spending-bills-in-drive-to-avoid-partial-shutdown">Congressional
Leaders Come Out With 6 Spending Bills in Drive to Avoid Partial
Shutdown</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Congressional leaders on Sunday came out with a package
of six bills setting full-year spending levels for some federal
agencies, a step forward in a long overdue funding process beset by
sharp political divisions between the two parties as well as infighting
among House Republicans.</p>
<p>The release of the text of legislation over the weekend was designed
to meet the House’s rule to give lawmakers at least 72 hours to study a
bill before voting. And it’s a promising sign that lawmakers will avoid
a partial shutdown that would kick in at 12:01 a.m. Saturday for those
agencies covered under the bill, such as Veterans Affairs, Agriculture,
Transportation, Justice and others.</p>
<p>Congressional leaders hope to complete votes on the package this week
and continue negotiations on the remaining six annual spending bills to
pass them before a March 22 deadline. The price tag for the package out
Sunday comes to about $460 billion, representing less than 30% of the
discretionary spending Congress looks to approve for this year. The
package still being negotiated includes defense spending.</p>
<p>House Speaker Mike Johnson highlighted some key policy and spending
wins for conservatives, even as many of his Republican colleagues
consider the changes inadequate. Some House Republicans had hoped the
prospect of a shutdown could leverage more concessions from
Democrats.</p>
<p>Overall, this year’s spending bills would keep non-defense spending
relatively flat with last year’s bill, despite the rise in inflation,
and some $70 billion less than what President Joe Biden originally
sought.</p>
<p>“House Republicans secured key conservative policy victories,
rejected left-wing proposals, and imposed sharp cuts to agencies and
programs critical to President Biden’s agenda,” Johnson said in a
prepared statement.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Johnson and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer
announced an agreement on the top-line spending levels for this year’s
discretionary spending, which comes to more than $1.6 trillion. But that
agreement didn’t address potential policy mandates placed within the
bills. That’s where negotiations have focused in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Democrats staved off most of the policy riders that House Republicans
sought to include. For example, they beat back an effort to reverse the
FDA’s decision that allows the abortion pill mifepristone to be sold in
retail pharmacies, instead of only in hospitals, clinics and medical
offices. Democrats also said the bill would fully fund a nutrition
program for low-income women, infants and children known as WIC,
providing about $7 billion for the program, a $1 billion increase from
the previous year.</p>
<p>“Throughout the negotiations, Democrats fought hard to protect
against cuts to housing and nutrition programs and keep out harmful
provisions that would further restrict access to women’s health or roll
back the progress we’ve made to fight climate change,” Schumer, said in
support of the legislation.</p>
<p>House Republicans were able to achieve some policy wins, however. One
provision, for example, will prevent the sale of oil in the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve to China.</p>
<p>Another provision strengthens gun rights for certain veterans. Under
current law, the VA must send a beneficiary’s name to the FBI’s National
Instant Criminal Background Check System whenever a fiduciary is
appointed to help manage someone’s benefits. This year’s spending
package prohibits the VA from transmitting that information unless a
relevant judicial authority rules that the beneficiary is a danger to
himself or herself, or others.</p>
<p>Still, some of the more conservative members of the House Republicans
have been critical of the spending bills, and many voted against the
short-term extension Congress passed last week that avoided a shutdown
and allowed negotiations to continue.</p>
<p>“We all promised we wouldn’t do this crap when we got up here,”
Rep. Eric Burlison, a Republican, said as the short-term extension was
debated. “The American people have demanded responsible spending and
border security for years, but we fail them. When will we heed the calls
of our constituents to rein in the wasteful spending, secure the
borders, and defeat the bureaucracy targeting them?”</p>
<p>The short-term extension last week was the fourth in recent months.
The vote to approve it was 320-99, but House Republicans were divided,
with 113 in support and 97 against. The Senate approved the extension,
77-13.</p>
<p>The votes being teed up on spending bills come five months after the
budget year began.</p>

<h2 id="pg_ivm-1.8-released">pg_ivm 1.8 released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-04, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
IVM Development Group is pleased to announce the release of
<a href="https://github.com/sraoss/pg_ivm/releases/tag/v1.8">pg_ivm
1.8</a>.
</p>
<p>
Changes since the v1.7 release include:
</p>
<h3>
Bug fixes
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Consider tuple duplicity in maintenance of EXISTS views (Yugo Nagata)
</p>
<p>
Previously, the duplicity of row was not considered and only one tuple
was inserted even when duplicated tuples are generated as a result of
inserting a tuple into a table in an EXISTS subquery.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Fix checking for expressions containing an EXISTS subquery (Takuma
Hoshiai, Yugo Nagata)
</p>
<p>
EXISTS subquery is currently allowed only directly under WHERE clause or
in AND expression that is directly under WHERE. However, the check was
insufficient previously so that views using expressions other than AND
containing an EXISTS subquery could be created without an error and it
caused incorrect maintenance results.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Check if PgIvmImmvRelationId is invalid before open it (Colin Zhao)
</p>
<p>
Fix an error that occurs at dropping tables that occurs when pg_ivm is
installed by shared_preload_libraries without executing CREATE EXTENSION
command.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Fix an error raised when dropping pg_ivm extension (Yugo Nagata)
</p>
<p>
Previously, DROP EXTENSION pg_ivm failed due to the failure of opening
the index on the pg_ivm_immv catalog table, because the index had been
already dropped at that time.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
About pg_ivm
</h3>
<p>
pg_ivm is an extension module that provides Incremental View Maintenance
(IVM) feature.
</p>
<p>
Incremental View Maintenance (IVM) is a way to make materialized views
up-to-date in which only incremental changes are computed and applied on
views rather than recomputing. pg_ivm provides a kind of immediate
maintenance, in which materialized views are updated immediately after a
base table is modified.
