## The Supreme Court Is Slowly Breaking the EPA

date: 2024-07-02, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjUyNDIyOC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczOTU3NjgyN30.C7QOnRVu-ODCyjvIbsdkufUSjKC79am5L1LAs4i-DF4/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">Perhaps it’s futile to talk about any Supreme Court decision this term other than the justices’<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> <u>unprecedented ruling</u></a> in the Trump case. The court’s decision to grant broad immunity to the president from criminal prosecution could reshape the modern presidency and empower Donald Trump during his potential — and increasingly likely — second term. </p>
<p>That ruling, too, will have profound practical implications for Americans who care about climate change. During his presidency, Trump flexed his power to <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/trump-administration-stifling-renewable-energy-public-lands-waters/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>slow</u></a> the energy transition, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/11/national-climate-assessment-black-friday/576589/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>bury</u></a> scientific reports, and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/06/01/867532070/trumps-unannounced-church-visit-angers-church-officials" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>attack</u></a> protesters. What will happen now that he is unbound?</p>
<p>But just as the court was expanding the president’s personal authority, it was confining and shrinking the power of <em><em>any </em></em>president to address climate change or regulate carbon dioxide emissions. </p>
<p>In a series of important rulings over the past week, the Supreme Court sharply limited the Environmental Protection Agency’s ability to regulate carbon pollution. These rulings could resonate for years to come, no matter who wins the White House in November. </p>
<p>It did so by focusing on a corner of federal law that is often overlooked by the mass public: administrative law, the body of rules that govern how federal agencies constrain and regulate the private sector. Although Americans rarely interact with these rules, they affect the water we drink, air we breathe, and the food and drugs that we ingest. </p>
<p>Taken together, the four cases — <em><em>Loper Bright Enterprises</em></em>,<em><em> Corner Post</em></em>,<em><em> Jarkesy</em></em>,<em> </em>and<em><em> Ohio v. EPA —</em></em> are not as high-profile as the Supreme Court’s broad grant of immunity to Trump. But they could substantially weaken the EPA for decades to come, stymying its ability to write and enforce rules limiting carbon pollution. They could also slow down the permitting and construction of new clean energy infrastructure.</p>
<p>“All of these decisions — all four of them — inflate the role of the courts relative to the bureaucracy. This is part of a longstanding campaign by the conservative legal movement to bring the administrative state to judicial heel,” <a href="https://michigan.law.umich.edu/faculty-and-scholarship/our-faculty/nicholas-bagley" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Nicholas Bagley</u></a>, a law professor at the University of Michigan Law School, told me. </p>
<p>“Congress has not comprehensively addressed climate change but the agencies are trying to,” Emily Hammond, an environmental law professor at George Washington University, told me. “What these cases do, all together, is fairly comprehensively limit the ability of agencies to protect health and human safety and try to mitigate climate change.”</p>
<p>“It’s a shocking and scary grab of power by a court that is rapidly discarding principles that we’ve been able to rely on and expect for a long time,” she added.</p>
<p>In the first case, <em><em>Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, </em></em>the Supreme Court repealed a 40-year-old tenet of American regulatory law that said courts should generally defer to executive agencies such as the EPA when interpreting an ambiguous law. In the second, <em><em>Corner Post v. Board of Governors, </em></em>the court opened the door to lawsuits targeting federal regulations that have been on the books for years. Instead of allowing companies to challenge a new rule during the first six years after it was published, the court ruled that companies can challenge a new rule during the six years <em><em>after the rule begins to affect them. </em></em>That seemingly allows companies to challenge federal regulations long after they have been issued and treated as settled law. </p>
<p>In the EPA’s case, these two cases may have less influence than it may seem— not because the EPA won’t be subject to these precedents, but rather because the agency receives so little deference from the justices <em><em>already</em></em>. </p>
<p>The high court <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF12077" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has asserted</u></a> since 2022 that agencies cannot write new rules on questions of “vast economic and political significance” without clear authorization from Congress. This principle, called the “major questions doctrine,” was first invoked by the justices to overturn the Clean Power Plan, an Obama-era rule that restricted greenhouse gas pollution from power plants in part by setting up an interstate carbon trading scheme. But the doctrine would seem to constrain almost any EPA attempt to regulate activities related to climate change, Carlson said. The EPA’s recent attempt <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/epa-auto-emissions-rule" target="_self"><u>to limit tailpipe pollution from cars</u></a> — in addition to <a href="https://www.epa.gov/regulations-emissions-vehicles-and-engines/final-rule-greenhouse-gas-emissions-standards-heavy-duty#:~:text=On%20March%2029%2C%202024%2C%20the,model%20year%20(MY)%202027." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>rules cutting carbon pollution</u></a> from heavy-duty trucks — could run astray of the major questions doctrine. </p>
<p>“At least in my mind, in terms of what regulations will be challenged and how, the major questions doctrine poses the biggest threat to regulatory authority,” Carlson said. </p>
<p>The <em><em>Corner Post </em></em>ruling, which effectively extends the statute of limitations for suing over new regulations, may also mean less for the EPA than for other agencies. That’s because virtually every EPA climate protection is already battled over in court, and once a court has decided whether a given regulation is legal, everyone has to abide by that precedent.</p>
<p>“Most rules worth challenging will already have been challenged,” Bagley said. </p>
<p>The EPA may escape, too, from the worst of the <em><em>Corner Post </em></em>ruling, but only because its rules are almost always litigated within the first six years of their life anyway, Carlson told me. That means companies probably won’t need to sue after that, as they might want to do for other federal regulations. </p>
<p>Even if those cases have a muted effect on the EPA, however, the other two rulings — which have received less attention so far — could prove far more restrictive to the agency’s authority.</p>
<p>In one case, <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/securities-and-exchange-commission-v-jarkesy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>Securities and Exchange Commission v. Jarkesy</em></em></u></a>, the court ruled 6-3 that the SEC cannot use an in-house tribunal of administrative judges to impose a civil penalty on a company. Instead, the agency must grant the company a full jury trial in federal court. But many other agencies, including the EPA, also use administrative judges and in-house trials to punish individuals or companies for breaking the law. Each year, the EPA <a href="https://www.epa.gov/enforcement/enforcement-and-compliance-annual-results-fiscal-year-2022" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>imposes hundreds of millions of dollars</u></a> in fines on companies that violate the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act. </p>
<p>Over the next few years, federal judges — and eventually the Supreme Court — will have to decide whether the <em><em>Jarkesy </em></em>ruling affects all executive agencies, including the EPA. If they decide it does, then it could slow down the agency’s efforts to penalize polluting companies by forcing virtually every decision into an already overworked court system. </p>
<p>But perhaps the most ominous ruling, Bagely said, is the one in a lawsuit concerning the EPA itself. On Thursday, in <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/ohio-v-environmental-protection-agency/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>Ohio v. EPA</em></em></u></a>,<em> </em>the court blocked the agency’s “good neighbor” rule, meant to limit how much air pollution upwind states can release into downwind states. The five-justice majority did so not only because it disagreed about the agency’s interpretation of the Clean Air Act, but also because the justices felt that the EPA had not properly addressed a few of the more than 1,100 comments about the rulemaking that it had received from the public. As such, they stayed the rule — temporarily blocking it from being enforced — and sent the case back down to a lower court.</p>
<p>That decision could change how every<em> </em>court views the rulemaking process, Bagley told me. Whenever the EPA drafts a new environmental rule, it receives thousands of public comments criticizing and praising different aspects of the proposal. Under a law called the Administrative Procedure Act, which governs how federal agencies deal with the public, it must respond to the substance of each of those comments before it can finalize and enforce the rule.</p>
<p>The EPA <em><em>did</em></em> respond to the comments at the center of the <em><em>Ohio </em></em>case, but Justice Neil Gorsuch, writing for the majority, decided the agency did not address a few specific concerns sufficiently. </p>
<p>Justice Amy Coney Barrett issued a dissent — joined by the court’s liberals — and castigated Gorsuch for focusing on “an alleged procedural error that likely had no impact” on the EPA’s actual anti-pollution plan. </p>
<p>“Given the number of companies included and the timelines for review, the court’s injunction leaves large swaths of upwind States free to keep contributing significantly to their downwind neighbors’ ozone problems for the next several years,” Barrett wrote.</p>
<p>“The reason this worries me in the environmental context is that <em><em>every</em></em> major environmental action is going to come with 1,000, 2,000 — 3,000 public comments,” he said. “What the court did here is flyspeck those comments,” meaning it looked for a tiny error and used it to justify pausing the entire rule. That’s despite the fact that the Clean Air Act, which the EPA was enforcing in the <em><em>Ohio</em></em> case, says that the courts must already meet an unusually high standard to intervene in an agency’s response to public comments.</p>
<p>“By flyspecking these comments … it increases the incentive to submit lots and lots of comments” in the hope that the EPA misses one of them. In those comments, “industry groups strew rakes all over your lawn in the hope that you’ll step on one — eventually an agency will.”</p>
<p>That has dire implications for the EPA’s ability to propose new climate rules, he said, but more broadly it affects any regulatory proceeding where the federal government has to reply to hundreds or thousands of public comments. In recent years, for insurance, some Democrats and many clean energy developers have grown frustrated with the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, which requires the government to study the environmental impact of any action that it takes. NEPA seems to <a href="https://ifp.org/no-nepa-really-is-a-problem-for-clean-energy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>particularly hamstring</u></a> clean energy projects, such as <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/sunzia" target="_self"><u>transmission lines</u></a> and <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/permitting-reform-transmission-nepa-geothermal" target="_self"><u>geothermal wells</u></a>.</p>
<p>NEPA does not require that agencies minimize a project’s impact to the environment; only that the government <em><em>study </em></em>all potential impacts. But as part of the NEPA process, the government must respond to public comments about the proposed action. It can receive hundreds or thousands of comments about a given NEPA case.</p>
<p>That means virtually every NEPA process could now be subject to the same high level of scrutiny that the court imposed on the EPA in <em><em>Ohio v. EPA. </em></em>“This is a dramatic intensification of the stringency of judicial review across a number of domains,” Bagley said. </p>
<p>It is ironic, at best, that these sharp new limits on executive agencies’ ability to regulate carbon pollution came from the same Court that vastly expanded the president’s immunity under the law. </p>
<p>“This is a court that is hostile to environmental regulation,” Ann Carlson, a UCLA environmental law professor and the former acting head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration from 2022 to 2023, told me. “I don’t think there’s any other way to view it.”</p>

## US Supreme Court to weigh in on flavored e-cigarette products

date: 2024-07-02, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court took up an e-cigarette case Tuesday, weighing whether the Food and Drug Administration wrongly blocked the marketing of sweet, flavored products amid a surge in vaping by young people.


Vaping companies argue the FDA unfairly denied more than a million applications to market fruit or candy flavored versions of nicotine-laced liquid that's heated by the e-cigarette to create an inhalable aerosol.


The case comes as the FDA undertakes a sweeping review after years of regulatory delays intended to bring scientific scrutiny to the multibillion-dollar vaping market, which includes thousands of flavored vapes that are technically illegal but are widely available in convenience stores, gas stations and vape shops. The FDA recently approved its first menthol-flavored electronic cigarettes for adult smokers.


The agency says the sweet, flavored e-liquids pose a "serious, well-documented risk" of enticing more young people to pick up a nicotine habit. In 2020, nearly 20% of high school students and almost 5% of middle school students used e-cigarettes, and almost all of those kids used flavored products, the agency said in court documents.


The agency says companies were blocked because they couldn't show the possible benefits for adult smokers outweighed the risk of underage use. The companies say they had prepared detailed plans to avoid appealing to young people.


The companies scored a victory when the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals sided with vaping companies and tossed out orders denying the marketing of e-liquids with names like "Jimmy The Juice Man in Peachy Strawberry."


The 5th Circuit found the agency was unfair because it required the companies, without warning, to present studies showing that flavored products would help with smoking cessation.


The FDA appealed that finding to the Supreme Court. The justices are expecting to hear the case in the fall.


Other appeals courts have sided with the FDA, which regulates new tobacco products under a 2009 law aimed at curbing youth tobacco use.


Vaping companies have long claimed their products can help blunt the toll of smoking, which is blamed for 480,000 U.S. deaths annually due to cancer, lung disease and heart disease.


Youth vaping has declined from all-time highs in recent years, but about 10% of high schoolers still reported e-cigarette use last year.

## Biden’s LNG Permitting Pause Is No More

date: 2024-07-02, from: Heatmap News

<em><strong>Current conditions:</strong> Raging wildfires are forcing evacuations on several Greek islands • More rain is forecast for China’s sodden rice growing regions • Temperatures in Death Valley could reach 130 degrees Fahrenheit early next week.</em>
</p><h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2><h3>1. Judge blocks Biden’s LNG permitting pause</h3><p>
	A federal court last night <a href="https://ago.wv.gov/Documents/LNG%20ruling.pdf?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9vX0aAEXYMhkDlBetuPXIUU4K3OUW2jcOMPFT8I3Kj78xVa6HLNW9dHaNjxU6hVQtdNKpQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">blocked</a> President Biden’s pause on permits for new liquefied natural gas export terminals. The administration issued a temporary moratorium on new LNG approvals in January, allowing the Energy Department to study what effect terminals have on the climate, a move seen as a big win for climate activists. But it was quickly followed by a lawsuit from 16 states accusing the administration of violating federal law. A Trump-appointed judge in Louisiana agreed that the pause was hurting states, and said it was “completely without reason or logic and is perhaps the epiphany of ideocracy [sic].” The Energy Department disagreed with the ruling and is considering its next steps. Some early reaction and analysis to the news:
</p><ul>
<li>“The ruling represents the latest example of how the judiciary is increasingly constraining President Biden’s climate goals at the behest of conservative and corporate challengers.” –<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/07/01/liquefied-natural-gas-exports-court-ruling/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9vX0aAEXYMhkDlBetuPXIUU4K3OUW2jcOMPFT8I3Kj78xVa6HLNW9dHaNjxU6hVQtdNKpQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Maxine Joselow</a> at <em>The Washington Post.</em></li>
<li>A “major victory for American energy.” –Louisiana Attorney General <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/07/01/liquefied-natural-gas-exports-court-ruling/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9vX0aAEXYMhkDlBetuPXIUU4K3OUW2jcOMPFT8I3Kj78xVa6HLNW9dHaNjxU6hVQtdNKpQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Liz Murrill</a>.</li>
<li>“We remain committed to informing our decisions with the best available economic and environmental analysis, underpinned by sound science.” –White House spokesman <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/07/02/g-s1-7645/judge-sides-with-16-states-putting-on-pause-bidens-delay-of-consideration-of-gas-export-projects?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9vX0aAEXYMhkDlBetuPXIUU4K3OUW2jcOMPFT8I3Kj78xVa6HLNW9dHaNjxU6hVQtdNKpQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Angelo Fernández Hernández</a>.</li>
<li>“Although the court order immediately enjoins the pause, the short-term practical effects are likely to be minimal.” –<a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/health-law-and-business/judge-blocks-biden-bid-to-halt-lng-export-licenses-over-climate?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9vX0aAEXYMhkDlBetuPXIUU4K3OUW2jcOMPFT8I3Kj78xVa6HLNW9dHaNjxU6hVQtdNKpQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jennifer A.

</ul><h3>2. Hurricane Beryl gains strength and aims for Jamaica<br/>
</h3><p>
	Hurricane Beryl has strengthened into a monster category 5 storm, the earliest storm of that magnitude ever to form in the Atlantic in recorded history. The system slammed into Grenada’s Carriacou Island, St. Vincent, and the Grenadines, leaving catastrophic damage in its wake. “In half an hour, Carriacou was flattened,” Grenada’s Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell <a href="https://phys.org/news/2024-07-hurricane-beryl-pummels-caribbean-category.html?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9vX0aAEXYMhkDlBetuPXIUU4K3OUW2jcOMPFT8I3Kj78xVa6HLNW9dHaNjxU6hVQtdNKpQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>. The National Hurricane Center <a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCPAT2+shtml/020855.shtml?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9vX0aAEXYMhkDlBetuPXIUU4K3OUW2jcOMPFT8I3Kj78xVa6HLNW9dHaNjxU6hVQtdNKpQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> the storm had maximum sustained winds of 165 miles per hour and was “still intensifying” this morning as it headed toward Jamaica. “Hurricane Beryl could never have formed where and when it did were it not for the unprecedented heat in the Atlantic Ocean,” <a href="https://grist.org/extreme-weather/hurricane-beryl-atlantic-ocean-heat-climate/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9vX0aAEXYMhkDlBetuPXIUU4K3OUW2jcOMPFT8I3Kj78xVa6HLNW9dHaNjxU6hVQtdNKpQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> Jake Bittle at <em><em>Grist</em></em>, noting that surface temperatures are as much as 3 or 4 degrees Fahrenheit above average.
</p><h3>3. Analysts expect Q2 drop in Tesla deliveries</h3><p>
	Tesla is expected to report Q2 deliveries today. Analysts think the EV maker will show a 6% drop in deliveries compared to the same period last year, marking the second declining quarter in a row. The company has “few excuses for its sales slowdown,” <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-01/tesla-tsla-to-report-2q-sales-as-cybertruck-ramps-slowly?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9vX0aAEXYMhkDlBetuPXIUU4K3OUW2jcOMPFT8I3Kj78xVa6HLNW9dHaNjxU6hVQtdNKpQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> Dana Hull and Kara Carlson at <em><em>Bloomberg</em></em>. The problem is straightforward, they added: “Tesla’s older lineup of vehicles is having a harder time keeping up with fresher offerings from rival EV manufacturers.”
</p><p>
	Meanwhile, Chinese EV powerhouse BYD just <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/chinas-byd-posts-21-jump-quarterly-ev-sales-closes-gap-with-tesla-2024-07-02/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9vX0aAEXYMhkDlBetuPXIUU4K3OUW2jcOMPFT8I3Kj78xVa6HLNW9dHaNjxU6hVQtdNKpQ" target="_blank">reported</a> its highest ever monthly sales of new energy vehicles, and a 21% rise in EV sales for the second quarter. The total number of vehicles sold (426,039) is about 12,000 short of what is expected from Tesla, but the gap is closing.
</p><h3>4. Biden administration proposes federal rules to protect workers from heat</h3><p>

## Shared reality

date: 2024-07-02, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>Online interactions are weirdly unique. They happen in shared, digital spaces—forums, chats, comment sections, social media platforms—where it’s easy to forget that more often than not, the people interacting with each other don’t share the same day-to-day reality. And sometimes that doesn’t matter. There are plenty of topics we can chat about that don’t have a connection with our lives. But there are also plenty who do have a connection and a profound one. From food to politics, from everything related to society to cultural norms. We all live in bubbles whether we like it or not. And it’s easy to forget about this fact when interacting online. Every time I stumble on someone making some wild claims about something I have to remind myself that maybe that specific thing appears wild to me because of my circumstances and it might be perfectly normal and reasonable somewhere else. And that’s why when I’m interacting with someone online I try to be both charitable in my interpretations of what others are saying and also generally curious and open-minded. Sometimes asking a question is all it takes to make a bubble pop and help a conversation move to a more interesting place.</p>                <hr>

## Trump seeks to set aside New York verdict hours after Supreme Court ruling

date: 2024-07-02, from: VOA News USA

New York — Donald Trump’s lawyers on Monday asked the New York judge who presided over his hush money trial to set aside his conviction and delay his sentencing scheduled for later this month.


The letter to Judge Juan M. Merchan cited the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling earlier Monday and asked the judge to delay Trump’s sentencing while he weighs the high court’s decision and how it could influence the New York case, the people said.


The people could not discuss details of the letter before it was made public and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.


The Supreme Court on Monday ruled for the first time that former presidents have broad immunity from prosecution.


Trump was convicted on 34 counts of falsifying business records, arising from what prosecutors said was an attempt to cover up a hush money payment just before the 2016 presidential election.


Merchan instituted a policy in the run-up to the trial requiring both sides to send him a one-page letter summarizing their arguments before making longer court filings. He said he did that to better manage the docket, so he was not inundated with voluminous paperwork.

## Deepening Russia-North Korea ties test US-South Korea deterrence strategy

date: 2024-07-02, from: VOA News USA

washington — The United States’ commitment to providing extended deterrence to South Korea is being put to the test, with some South Korean politicians publicly questioning the effectiveness of the U.S. nuclear umbrella after Russia and North Korea reached a new defense pact.


Debate over the U.S. extended deterrence was sparked by Representative Na Kyung Won, a five-term lawmaker of South Korea’s ruling People Power Party, who is running for the party leadership.


“The deterrence under the solid South Korea-U.S. alliance is currently working, but it does not guarantee the capacity to respond to the future changes in the security environment,” Na said in a social media post last week.


“The international situation, such as cooperation between North Korea and Russia, is adding uncertainty to the security of South Korea,” she added, referring to the stronger military ties between Russia and North Korea, bolstered by the comprehensive strategic partnership treaty signed by Russia’s President Vladmir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang last month.


The new treaty mandates Russia and North Korea to immediately assist each other militarily if either of them is attacked by a third country. The prospect of quasi-automatic Russian involvement in any future war between the two Koreas is now causing alarm in Seoul.




The credibility of extended deterrence is a frequent topic of conversation in today’s South Korea, where citizens must contend with seemingly endless threats and provocations from the North. 

  

Seoul is doing its best to allay citizens’ fears by invoking the April 2023 Washington Declaration, which reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to defend South Korea through its extended nuclear umbrella as well as robust missile defense and conventional forces. 

  

The Washington Declaration outlined a series of measures, including the establishment of the bilateral Nuclear Consultative Group (NCG), to deter North Korea’s use of nuclear weapons. 

  

In the joint declaration, the U.S. additionally vowed to enhance the visibility of its strategic assets, such as a nuclear-armed submarine, around the Korean Peninsula.


The Washington Declaration’s measures are collectively sufficient to deter aggression from Pyongyang, according to some experts in the U.S.


The joint declaration was “unprecedented in its strength and clarity,” Evans Revere, a former State Department official who negotiated with North Korea, told VOA’s Korean Service on Sunday. “And the NCG process is designed to be flexible, creative, and allow for adaptation to a broad range of future contingencies.”


Troop presence


David Maxwell, a former U.S. Special Forces colonel who served on the Combined Forces Command of the U.S and South Korea, told VOA’s Korean Service on Sunday that a large troop presence on the Korean Peninsula demonstrates Washington’s firm commitment to the defense of its key ally.


“How many Russian troops are committed to North Korea? There is no comparison as to the commitment,” said Maxwell, who now serves as vice president of the Center for Asia Pacific Strategy.


Currently, the U.S. has about 28,500 service members deployed in South Korea.


In contrast, Elbridge Colby, who served as the deputy assistant secretary of defense for strategy and force development in the Trump administration, suggested the U.S. might have to go beyond the Washington Declaration to ensure the security of South Korea.


“I think we need to take very seriously how dire the threat from North Korea is, and that the Washington Declaration is not a solution,” Colby told VOA’s Korean Service on the phone last week.  

 

“It’s been a failure that both North Korea and China are a nuclear breakout. They’re increasing the size and the sophistication of the nuclear forces. So it’s very unsurprising that serious people in South Korea are coming to this conclusion.” 

  

Bruce Bennett, senior defense analyst at the RAND Corporation, believes some South Koreans may lack confidence in the Washington Declaration because the NCG’s work is not made public.


“Because the NCG that it established has carried out most of its work in secrecy and provided little substance to reassure the South Korean people, many of the South Koreans with whom I have spoken are concerned that it is an inadequate means for rebuilding South Korean trust,” Bennett told VOA’s Korean Service on Sunday.


Responding to an inquiry from VOA’s Korean Service, a State Department spokesperson said Thursday that "the U.S. and the ROK are enhancing and strengthening extended deterrence through the Nuclear Consultative Group, established as part of the Washington Declaration.”


The spokesperson also stressed that the Washington Declaration is “a landmark U.S. extended deterrence commitment to the Republic of Korea.” The Republic of Korea is South Korea’s official name.


Earlier last week, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell maintained that the series of mechanisms put in place between the United States and South Korea through the Washington Declaration “has given us what we need to work with” regarding the alliance’s deterrence posture.


North Korea launched two short-range ballistic missiles Monday, one of which is presumed to have failed and fallen inland near Pyongyang. The latest missile test came just five days after North Korea conducted a ballistic missile test in which it claimed to have successfully tested its multiple-warhead missile technology. South Korean authorities have dismissed such a claim.

## Crossmark community consultation: What did we learn?

date: 2024-07-02, from: Crossref Blog

<p>In the first half of this year we’ve been talking to our community about post-publication changes and Crossmark. When a piece of research is published it isn’t the end of the journey—it is read, reused, and sometimes modified. That&rsquo;s why we run Crossmark, as a way to provide notifications of important changes to research made after publication. Readers can see if the resesarch they are looking at has updates by clicking the Crossmark logo. They also see useful information about the editorial process, and links to things like funding and registered clinical trials. All of this contributes to what we call the <a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/isr-part-one-what-is-our-role-in-preserving-the-integrity-of-the-scholarly-record/" target="_blank">integrity of the scholarly record</a>.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;margin:10px">
<figure class="img-responsive"><img src="https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2024/Crossmark-popup-example.png"
alt="The Crossmark popup provides information about whether a work is current and other metadata about integrity of the scholarly record." width="75%">
</figure>
</div>
<p>Crossmark has been around a long time and the context around it is constantly changing. It last had a major update in <a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/get-ready-for-crossmark-2.0/" target="_blank">2016</a> and in <a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/encouraging-even-greater-reporting-of-corrections-and-retractions/" target="_blank">2020</a> we removed fees for its use.</p>
<p>The past few years have seen a more intense focus on research integrity, leading to more retractions and calling out large-scale manipulation of editorial processes. At the same time, we haven’t seen an increase in the uptake of Crossmark, which is still used by only a minority of our members. We would like to know why the uptake is low and whether there is more we can do in this area. To dig into this, in the first part of 2024 we reached out to members of our community.</p>
<h2 id="what-did-we-do">What did we do?</h2>
<p>We wanted to learn about attitudes towards Crossmark and related aspects of research integrity. This was done in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Structured interviews with eight of our members.</li>
<li>Round tables at Crossref LIVE events in Bogota and Nairobi</li>
<li>Surveying a selection of our members, which led to 94 responses.</li>
</ul>
<p>The topics we asked about were related to how post-publication updates are made and communicated, and which metadata demonstrates good practice.</p>
<p>We are extremely grateful to the members who contributed. They provided valuable feedback and have helped to shape the future of Crossmark and our approach to the integrity of the scholarly record.</p>
<h2 id="what-did-we-find">What did we find?</h2>
<p>Across the various groups there were a few common themes, which fell into several areas.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Communication of updates is highly valued, and seen as the most important role that Crossmark can play. Some of those we spoke to would like readers to see if there is an update as soon as a page opens, without having to open a popup. This could be done by having a logo that changes colour, shape, or size.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conversely, not as much enthusiasm was shown for the metadata assertions. These are additional fields that can be displayed to readers in the Crossmark popup. There wasn’t a strong consensus on which commonly-made assertions are the most important for research integrity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is diversity in attitudes towards making updates to published works, what research integrity means, and approaches to workflows for updates. Even within a single organisation, a number of different workflows and multiple staff members might be called on to update published research. This makes things complex and means that it can be difficult to fit Crossmark in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are technical challenges to getting started with Crossmark. Those responsible for implementing Crossmark are often technical staff who struggle with the documentation we provide in English. There is also no plugin for OJS, a widely-used open source editorial software. It is more difficult to deposit Crossmark metadata for books than journal articles, and many article types don’t permit Crossmark metadata at all. On the other hand, those who successfully installed Crossmark found it easy to use and low-maintenance.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, it seems that Crossmark still has an important role to play but there are changes and improvements we can make.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h2>
<p>Here are the main areas we intend to follow up on in the coming months.</p>
<h3 id="implementation">Implementation</h3>
<p>We need to look at how to make implementation more straight-forward. Can we provide multilingual documentation, plugins, run workshops or webinars, or make changes to Crossmark to lower the barrier to entry?</p>
<h3 id="understanding-workflows">Understanding workflows</h3>
<p>Can we collaborate with our members and other organisations to reach a better understanding of how to update published works? Are there alternative workflows we need to support? Have we made it too difficult to understand and implement the options we currently have?</p>
<p>While updates are always likely to be rare, we want to help members understand the benefits of making them. We talked to some members who were proud of never having published a retraction or correction, which left us wondering whether they are missing legitimate opportunities to correct the scholarly record. We also know that for some members and many work types (preprints, for example), updates are made without a separate published notification. Can we better understand the role that the published updates play and communicate updates even if there isn’t a published notice?</p>
<h3 id="ongoing-feedback">Ongoing feedback</h3>
<p>Clearly one size doesn’t fit all when it comes to implementing and communicating updates. We need to find ways of keeping in touch with the community to test new solutions with as broad a range of members as possible. We want to avoid catering to a minority and leaving others struggling to find ways to implement a solution.</p>
<h3 id="custom-metadata">Custom metadata?</h3>
<p>Is there an ongoing need for metadata assertions? Many of the assertions currently made are possible as standard metadata and others could be included in our deposit schema. We want to consider removing the option to add assertions. This needs more feedback from the community, especially those who currently make use of assertions.</p>
<h3 id="redesign-the-ui">Redesign the UI</h3>
<p>Crossmark doesn’t have the recognition with readers we would like. Is there a way we can redesign it to make it more associated with Crossref and accurate metadata? We intend to explore different designs, and test them with members and readers.</p>

Both proposals would reverse provisions of 2014's Prop 47, which reduced most drug possession and property crimes valued at $950 or less to misdemeanors and allowed for re-sentencing of those convicted of felonies for those offenses. The goal was depopulating crowded prisons and addressing social-justice concerns.

## We Fact Checked Everything Trump Has Said About Energy Efficiency Since 2021

date: 2024-07-01, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjUxNjg0OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2MTY3MDgzM30.tRQwrmEW3e585Vy73uelg1RQl8Qn0NFOreZkDaiPhfk/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">You can take the real estate magnate out of development, but becoming a politician hasn’t made Donald Trump less invested in dishwashers and water flow. Here’s what he’s gotten right and wrong about at-home energy efficiency on the campaign trail.</p><blockquote><em>All I know about magnets is this: Give me a glass of water, let me drop it on the magnets, that’s the end of the magnets.”</em> [<a href="https://twitter.com/Acyn/status/1743463970621862227" target="_blank">Jan. 5, 2024</a>]</blockquote><p><strong>Fact check:</strong> Trump made this comment while discussing electric catapults and magnetic elevators on aircraft carriers. While there have certainly been <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/naval/2021/12/23/us-navy-completes-final-weapons-elevator-on-aircraft-carrier-gerald-r-ford/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">problems with the roll-out of these advanced systems</a> on the ships, none involved water-damaged magnets. <strong>Magnets are waterproof, and therefore their performance does not suffer from water damage.</strong></p><blockquote><em>“They want to talk about your dishwashers and how much water you’re going to have in your dishwasher, even though they don’t work and all of the other things that you have that were so precious and dear and that you never really appreciated until now because they want to take them away.”</em> [<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?532074-1/president-trump-campaigns-cedar-rapids-iowa" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">December 2, 2023</a>]</blockquote><p><strong>Fact check:</strong> As someone who lives in a New York City apartment, I would absolutely describe my dishwasher as “precious and dear,” so that part is true. It is also true that, <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/dishwashers-biden-conservatives-culture-war" target="_self">as I explained last year</a>, rules proposed by the Biden administration call for new dishwashers imported and made in the U.S. to use 34% less water, or no more than 3.3 gallons, during their default cycles by 2027. But <strong>it is not true that those dishwashers don’t work</strong>.</p><p>Energy-efficient dishwashers <em>can </em>take a long time to clean your dishes; many cycles last more than two hours and some up to three. The reason for this is pretty straightforward: In order to achieve the same level of cleanliness as old, water- and energy-inefficient dishwashers, new water- and energy-efficient dishwashers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyOHcNcovYA&ab_channel=ApplianceVideo.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">need to swish around longer</a>.</p><p>But the “default cycles” are the <em>only</em> dishwasher mode the government restricts; “short cycle” modes, which require more water and take less time, are still allowed on dishwashers sold in the U.S. and aren’t regulated by the new rules. That fast mode just can’t be the default. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/dishwashers-trump-efficiency/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">As <em>Wirecutter</em> writes</a>, “crappy cleaning performance and long cycles aren’t an inevitable outcome of efficiency standards,” and “if your dishwasher is slow and sucks (and a better detergent doesn’t fix the problem), blame the company that built it.”</p><blockquote><em>“Now their new thing is your heating systems in the house. They don’t want you to have a modern-day heating system. They want you to use a heating system that will cost you at least $10,000 to buy and won’t work very well.”</em> [<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-ranted-about-heat-pumps-evs-and-water-with-tucker-carlson" target="_self">August 24, 2023</a>]</blockquote><p><strong>Fact check: It’s really gas furnace systems that are, technically speaking, dated.</strong> Gas furnaces were considered <a href="https://cycleairfilters.com/blogs/all-about-hvac/history-of-the-forced-air-gas-furnace#:~:text=In%20the%201920s%20and%201930s,for%20their%20efficiency%20and%20reliability." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">state-of-the-art</a> in the 1920s and 1930s, while heat pump technology — which works by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQaycSD5GWE&ab_channel=BCHydro" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">transferring</a>, rather than generating, heat from indoors to outdoors and vice versa — <a href="https://texascooppower.com/heat-pumps-are-back-and-worth-a-look/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">took off in the 1970s</a> as a response to surging oil prices. Heat pumps can be up to five times more efficient than fossil-fuel furnaces, according to electrification advocacy group Rewiring America, which means that at least 70% of people could save money on their energy bills by switching from fossil fuel heaters, the group estimates.</p><p>The cost of a heat pump itself <a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/reviews/hvac/heat-pump-cost" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">varies widely</a> depending on size (how much house it has to heat), type (geothermal vs. air source), and efficiency, then when you add in factors like the cost to refit you existing HVAC system and the cost of labor, well, <a href="https://www.blocpower.io/posts/heat-pump-installation-cost-2023-prices-guide" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">it adds up</a>. While heat pumps aren’t cheap, they do at least serve as both a furnace <em>and</em> an air conditioner, two appliances for the price of one, an investment that can pay back over time, Rewiring America said.</p><blockquote><em>“You want to wash your beautiful hair. And you stand under a shower and the suds never go — the water comes out very slowly. I’m sure you’ve seen this. It usually takes place in new hotels and new homes.” </em>[<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-ranted-about-heat-pumps-evs-and-water-with-tucker-carlson" target="_self">August 24, 2023</a>]</blockquote><p><strong>Fact check:</strong><strong> This might have been true <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbXOSnyMeA&ab_channel=TBS" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">when <em>Seinfeld</em> was on the air</a>, but it hasn’t been for quite a while.</strong> Modern low-flow shower heads are specifically designed to “push out water that feels like a higher pressure even with a lower flow rate,” <a href="https://www.usnews.com/360-reviews/home-goods/best-shower-heads" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>U.S. News and World Report</em> writes</a>.</p><p>When Trump was on his way out of the White House, his administration <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/07/19/trump-stronger-showers/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reinterpreted</a> a 2013 regulation about how much water can flow out of a showerhead. “Manufacturers [had not demanded] the rollback,” <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/12/15/trump-showerheads-efficiency-biden-climate/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>The Washington Post</em> writes</a>. “Instead, the call for more powerful showers came from Trump himself, who complained that the conservation standards led to low water pressure and a dissatisfying shower experience.” With four or five or more nozzles, as Trump had allowed, “you could have 10, 15 gallons per minute powering out of the showerhead, literally probably washing you out of the bathroom,” Andrew deLaski, the executive director of the energy conservation group Appliance Standards Awareness Project, <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-showerhead-rule-that-sought-to-increase-water-flow-being-dropped" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told PBS</a>.</p><p>Biden restored the old water flow regulations.</p>

	For being so cozy with (not to mention 
	<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/05/09/trump-oil-industry-campaign-money/" target="_blank">bankrolled by</a>) the oil and gas industry, Donald Trump still manages to get a lot wrong about the world’s <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61545" target="_blank">dominant petroleum industry</a>. Here’s everything he’s gotten wrong, and occasionally right, about the oil and gas industry while on the 2024 campaign trail.
</p><blockquote>
<em><em>“On January 6, we were energy independent.” </em></em><em><em>[</em></em><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/27/politics/read-biden-trump-debate-rush-transcript/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>June 27, 2024</em></em></u></a><em><em>]</em></em>
</blockquote><p class="rm-anchors" id="jan6">
<strong>Fact check: </strong>What does “energy independence” actually mean? Experts frequently <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/energy-independence-is-a-big-election-talking-point-but-what-does-it-mean/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>dismiss</u></a> the term as a political buzzword that isn’t helpful for understanding the United States’ position in the global energy market.
</p><p>
	According to one definition, “energy independence” means that the United States produces more energy than it consumes. By this metric, the U.S. became energy independent in 2019, during the Trump administration, for the first time in 40 years, though it was the cumulative result of the shale boom that started in 2005 and stretched across three presidential administrations. By 
	<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rrapier/2023/05/02/us-energy-independence-soars-to-highest-levels-in-over-70-years/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>this same metric</u></a>, <strong>U.S. “energy independence” actually reached its highest level in 70 years in 2022 under President Biden, not Trump.</strong>
</p><p>
	Another way to define “energy independence” would be that the U.S. doesn’t import any energy. This definition would also make Trump’s statement inaccurate: In 2020 under Trump, the U.S. imported 
	<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/15/politics/energy-independence-fact-check/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">7.9 million barrels</a> of crude oil and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/11/09/us-oil-biden-trump/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">petroleum products</a> per day. In 2023, under Biden, that number rose to 8.51 million barrels per day. Under both Trump and Biden, the U.S. has been a net exporter of oil products due in large part to its processing of crude oil. Check out this <a href="https://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/flow-graphs/petroleum.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">visualization</a> from the U.S. from the Energy Information Administration for more granular detail on U.S. petroleum flows.
</p><blockquote>
	“We’re refining the oil. We have our refinery for that oil. It’s really, I call it tar. It’s not oil. It’s terrible. We have real stuff, but we’re refining it in Houston. So for all of the environmentalists, you ought to look at that because all of that tar is going right up into the atmosphere. You just ought to take a look. It’s the only plant that can do it. We have the only plants that can take tar and make it into oil.” [
	<a href="https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/trump-delivers-remarks-after-dominant-super-tuesday-performance" target="_blank">March 6, 2024</a>]
</blockquote><p>
<strong>Fact check:</strong> Just because Trump decides to call something “tar” doesn’t mean it actually <em>is</em> tar. <strong>What he seems to be talking about here are the Canadian oil sands</strong>, sometimes called tar sands, which contain bitumen. The <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/276ecc11-15cd-45ef-8e10-5f64dcde77da" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">heavy, dirty</a>, and diluted crude oil is transported via rail and pipeline from Canada to Texas, which is where most (but contrary to Trump’s claim, <a href="https://www.energypolicy.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/CGEPTheRiseofChinasIndependentRefineries917.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">not all</a>) of the world’s specialized <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/oil-refining-should-be-americas-strength/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">heavy oil refineries</a> are located.
</p><p>
<a href="https://phys.org/news/2024-01-pollution-leaking-atmosphere-oil-sands.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Extracting</a>, transporting, and refining bitumen is a pollution-heavy process. “All of that tar” doesn’t literally go “right up into the atmosphere,” but the refining process does emit benzene, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide, which are known to increase instances of cancer, asthma, and other health conditions in the <a href="https://thenarwhal.ca/houston-tar-sands-sacrifice-zone/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">people who live or work nearby</a>.
</p><blockquote>
<em>“Just yesterday, Biden blocked the export of American natural gas to other countries … Now, why he stopped it, I guess it was the environmentalists. I guess. But it’s good for the environment, not bad. And it’s good for our country. I will approve the export terminals on my very first day back.” [<a href="https://twitter.com/SStapczynski/status/1751392338612822229" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jan. 27, 2024</a>]</em>

<strong>Fact check: This is wrong in a number of ways.</strong> Let’s take it from the top: First, Biden did not block the export of liquified natural gas to other countries; he temporarily paused the approval of new licenses to export LNG, including 17 that had been in the, er, pipeline. The United States is already the top exporter of LNG in the world, with output expected to double by the end of the decade from projects that are already licensed and under construction. The LNG licensing pause “will not impact our ability to continue supplying LNG to our allies in the near-term,” the Biden administration has said; current exports have been more than enough to meet Europe’s needs so far, even accounting for the war in Ukraine.
</p><p>
	The permitting process will resume once the Department of Energy has updated its criteria for determining whether new LNG export terminals are in the “public interest” once their climate impacts are considered.
</p><p>
	Now, about those climate impacts: It’s true that natural gas burns “cleaner” than coal, producing about 40% less carbon dioxide (and about 30% less than oil). But natural gas is also largely composed of methane, “a climate-altering super pollutant,” Jeremy Symons, an environmental and political analyst and strategist, told Heatmap.
</p><p>
	While methane breaks down more quickly in the atmosphere than CO2, it also traps more heat — about 80 times more heat over the course of 20 years. The process of liquifying natural gas not only requires additional energy, it also introduces new opportunities for methane to leak, adding to the fuel’s climate impacts. Once all those leaks have been quantified, argues Cornell University researcher Robert Howarth, LNG is not only not beneficial to the environment, it’s actually worse than other fossil fuels. Howarth’s paper has not yet been peer-reviewed, and some have questioned his conclusions in the past. But there’s no question that building new LNG facilities will lock the U.S. into producing planet-warming fuel for years to come.
</p><p>
	LNG certainly isn’t “good for the environment” of the people who live near fracking sites and export terminals, either, where health issues are rampant. In addition to methane, LNG plants release volatile organic compounds, which have been linked to higher instances of cancer, asthma, and birth defects.

<em>“You have the highest energy costs in the entire country. In the first year, they’re going to be reduced by 50% because we’re going to drill, baby, drill.” [<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?533126-1/donald-trump-hampshire-primary-night-remarks" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jan. 23, 2024</a>]</em>
</blockquote><p>
<strong>Fact check: </strong>Trump made these remarks after winning the New Hampshire primary — and <strong>they’re wrong</strong>. For one thing, while energy <em>is</em> expensive in the Granite State, New Hampshire’s Department of Energy says its energy costs are <a href="https://www.energy.nh.gov/energy-information/energy-new-hampshire" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the fifth-highest</a> in the lower 48.
</p><p>
	There’s an even bigger fallacy in Trump’s statement, though: that drilling can quickly lower energy prices. For one thing, oil from new leases 
	<a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/5-reasons-why-the-united-states-cant-drill-its-way-to-energy-independence/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">doesn’t hit the market</a> for at least four years, according to the Government Accountability Office. (Offshore drilling takes even longer since building the rigs alone can take two to three years.) As <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/03/19/1086925726/gas-prices-oil-crude-drilling" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NPR explains</a>, there are also operational limits; drilling new wells is “not as simple as turning a spigot and watching oil gush out.”
</p><p>
	Much to the dismay of environmentalists, the Biden administration has also been 
	<a href="https://heatmap.news/r/entryeditor/2666861923#drill" target="_self">keeping pace</a> with Trump’s historic drilling. In fact, as of 2024, the U.S. is producing more domestic crude than <a href="https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&s=MCRFPUS2&f=M" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">at any point during Trump’s presidency</a>.
</p><p>
	But even with all this new domestic crude, the U.S. is still susceptible to fluctuations in the global price of oil. That’s partially because the U.S. imports a different kind of oil than it exports — what those in the trade call light, sweet crude, compared to the gunkier, heavy crude most U.S. refineries are set up for. Reconfiguring refineries to handle the light crude oil “could underserve some product markets and idle (or even strand) the hundreds of billions of dollars invested in refinery conversion capacity,” the American Petroleum Institute 
	<a href="https://www.api.org/news-policy-and-issues/blog/2018/06/14/why-the-us-must-import-and-export-oil" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">warns</a>. Plus, it would also take even more time.
</p><p>
	All that means that the U.S. is stuck relying on importing and exporting oil 
	<em>even if </em>domestic production ramps up even more than it already has. And that, in turn, means we’re at the mercy of fluctuations in global energy costs, which remain out of the White House’s singular control.
</p><p>
	One more thing to note: “The oil industry can decide to produce more oil whenever it wants,” the Center for American Progress, a liberal public policy think tank, 
	<a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/5-reasons-why-the-united-states-cant-drill-its-way-to-energy-independence/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">explains</a>, noting that the oil industry is sitting on “<a href="https://www.blm.gov/sites/blm.gov/files/docs/2022-02/FY%202022%20APD%20Status%20Report%20December.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more than 9,000</a> approved — but unused — drilling permits on federal lands.” This is the base of <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/oil-companies-record-profits-2022-exxon-chevron/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the criticism</a> that the oil industry is raking in “unprecedented profits” and burdening Americans with an artificially high cost of energy.

</blockquote><p>
<strong>Fact check:</strong> Economists mostly agree that “energy caused” the spike in inflation that we’ve seen since 2020, so in that sense, <strong>Trump is correct.</strong> But in making this argument, he inadvertently endorses the case for clean energy — since renewables aren’t subject to the same kinds of supply volatility as fossil fuels, they are therefore considered <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f2a27ddb-ea88-46cc-a265-ef84bd50946b" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">intrinsically deflationary</a>.
</p><blockquote>
<em>“We are a nation that is begging Venezuela and others for oil. ‘Please, please, please help us,’ Joe Biden says, and yet we have more liquid gold under our feet than any other country anywhere in the world. We are a nation that just recently heard that Saudi Arabia and Russia will be reducing their oil production while at the same time substantially increasing the price. And we met that threat by announcing that we will no longer be drilling for oil in large areas in Alaska or elsewhere, anywhere in our states. We are a nation that is consumed by the radical left’s Green New Deal, yet everyone knows that the Green New Deal is fake. It is really the green new scam.”</em> [<a href="https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-in-reno-12-17-23-transcript" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dec. 17, 2023</a>]

<strong>Fact check:</strong> First, <strong>the United States is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_oil_production" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">top oil-producing country</a> globally</strong>, followed by Russia and Saudi Arabia. It is true that the U.S. <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/10/18/biden-venezuela-oil-sanctions-nicolas-maduro-00121779" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">eased oil sanctions on Venezuela</a> late last year, though that reprieve was explicitly temporary and contingent on the country holding free and fair elections.
</p><p>
	Trump also appears to be referencing the Biden administration’s 
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/06/climate/biden-drilling-alaska-wildlife-refuge.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recent decision</a> to cancel oil and gas leases in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and block 13 million acres in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska from new drilling.

</p><p>
	Trump further seems to be alluding to Biden’s campaign promise to not approve any new drilling (“ 
	<em>...anywhere in our states!</em>”), but <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-resume-oil-gas-drilling-public-land-despite-biden-campaign-pledge-2022-04-15/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">that hasn’t exactly gone to plan</a>; although Biden <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/27/executive-order-on-tackling-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">issued a pause</a> on new oil and gas leases on federal lands one week after taking office, the administration then <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-resume-oil-gas-drilling-public-land-despite-biden-campaign-pledge-2022-04-15/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lifted that pause</a> a little over a year later in the face of numerous legal and political challenges.

## We Fact Checked Everything Trump Has Said About Electric Vehicles Since 2021

date: 2024-07-01, from: Heatmap News

He might be a bigger fan, though, if he got his facts straight. Here’s what Trump has gotten right and wrong about EVs since 2021.</p><blockquote><em>“To China, if you’re listening — President Xi, you and I are friends, but he understands the way I deal. Those big monster car manufacturing plants that you are building in Mexico right now, and you think you are going to get that, not hire Americans, and you’re going to sell the car to us — no. We are going to put a 100% tariff on every single car that comes across the lot.”</em> [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCz1CWMfR9s&ab_channel=CNBC-TV18" target="_blank">March 16, 2024</a>]</blockquote><p><strong>Fact check:</strong> “<strong>There actually are no operating Chinese-owned EV factories in Mexico</strong>,” Ilaria Mazzocco, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and an expert on Chinese climate policy, told me. “So this is very preemptive at this point.”</p><p>But it is also, probably, only a matter of time: BYD, which last year passed Tesla as the world’s No. 1 EV maker, is reportedly <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/02/27/byd-no-plans-sell-evs-us/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">scouting plant locations in Mexico</a>, and could confirm plans as soon as the second half of 2024. That has made U.S. automakers justifiably nervous. As Robinson Meyer <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/chinese-ev-cars-biden" target="_self">previously wrote for Heatmap</a>, “BYD recently advertised an <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/663595/byd-seagull-ev-priced-11400-usd-gets-10000-orders-first-day/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$11,000 plug-in hybrid</a> targeted at the Chinese market … Even doubling its price with tariffs would keep it firmly among [the United States’] most affordable new vehicles.”</p><p>In Mazzocco’s opinion, this isn’t wholly a bad thing — “there’s a point of value to competition that we shouldn’t forget” — and the threat of cheap Chinese EVs has already driven American <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-18/chinese-ev-affordability-frightens-ford-gm-us-automakers" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">automakers like Ford</a> to pivot their <a href="https://heatmap.news/cheap-evs-gm-bolt-volvo-ex30" target="_self">electric lineups</a>.</p><p>But “EVs have encapsulated everybody’s fears of competition with China,” Mazzocco said. The rude awakening has been that they are “actually better at something than the Americans are.” As a result, Biden and Trump are jostling to look tougher on Beijing ahead of the election, especially since big auto manufacturing states like Michigan and Ohio could potentially decide control of the White House. Biden has already ordered the Commerce Department to investigate the potential national security threat of Chinese-made EVs, which currently make up only about 2% of EV imports; Polestar became the <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/09/01/china-electric-car-vehicle-polestar-ev-us-economy-climate-energy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first Chinese-owned</a> EV company to make moves in the U.S. last year, but it’s <a href="https://jalopnik.com/volvo-is-done-propping-up-struggling-polestar-1851215514" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hardly thriving</a>. Meanwhile, Trump has warned that “it’s gonna be a bloodbath for the country” if he isn’t elected.</p><blockquote> <em>“If we build all the charging booths that are necessary, our country would go bankrupt. It would cost like $3 trillion. It’s the craziest thing I’ve ever heard.” [</em><a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?533571-1/president-trump-holds-rally-waterford-township-michigan" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Feb. 17, 2024</em></a><em>]</em></blockquote><p><strong>Fact check:</strong> $3 trillion is a huge number, and it is also <strong>very inaccurate in this case</strong>. While there are valid concerns about the Biden administration’s high-speed <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/02/18/epa-electric-vehicles-car-rules/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">electric vehicle push</a>, Trump almost certainly got his “$3 trillion” price tag from the <em>total</em> cost of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/22/business/biden-infrastructure-spending.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law</a>, which aims to address significantly more than just the country’s EV-charging infrastructure.</p><p>In fact, the BIL earmarks a comparatively small $7.5 billion for the development of 500,000 public charging stations, although even this is a “generational-level investment,” Noah Barnes, the communications director of the Electrification Coalition, told me. With just a fraction of $3 trillion, the U.S. will be able to jumpstart the “national network of EV chargers that will be necessary to power the next generation of vehicles and end our dependence on oil from countries that don’t share our values.”</p><p>But what would it cost to build and operate <em>all</em> the charging booths necessary to meet the current federal target of zero-emission cars making up half of new vehicle sales by 2030? A 2022 report from <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-sector/our-insights/building-the-electric-vehicle-charging-infrastructure-america-needs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">McKinsey & Company estimated</a> that the U.S. will need “1.2 million public EV chargers and 28 million private EV chargers” by 2030 to meet Biden’s zero-emission sales goals. Those public chargers would cost about $38 billion, including the hardware, planning, and installation. Wrap in the cost to residences, workplaces, and depots, and the total cost of public and private charging installation approaches $97 billion. In a separate analysis, AlixPartners, a consulting firm, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/31/us-ev-charging-system-a-priority-under-bidens-2-trillion-infrastructure-plan.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">found</a> that it would take $50 billion to build the charging infrastructure to meet the 2030 zero-emission vehicle goal in the U.S., and $300 billion worldwide.</p><p>Needless to say, though, there are a thousand billions in a trillion, so whatever way you cut it, it certainly would not cost the U.S. $3 trillion to build enough charging stations to accommodate zero-emission vehicles.</p><blockquote><em>“I will also rescue the ethanol industry by canceling crooked Joe Biden’s insane ethanol-killing electric vehicle mandate on day one.”</em> [<a href="https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/trump-holds-rally-in-iowa-moments-after-colorado-supreme-court-blocks-him-from-ballot-transcript" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dec. 20, 2023</a>]</blockquote><p><strong>Fact check: It’s not wrong to say that Biden has tried to reduce the role of liquid fuel in vehicles.</strong> Trump has gunned for Iowa voters by claiming Biden’s goal (albeit <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/28/us/politics/trump-fact-check-electric-vehicles.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">not a binding mandate</a>) of ramping up EV sales will kill the local ethanol industry. But Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack — Iowa’s former governor — has stressed that just because the administration is pushing for more EVs, “Does that mean we won’t have a need for E15 or E85” — gasoline blends that contain up to 15% and 85% ethanol content, respectively — “in the future? No.”</p><p>For example, new rules defining what qualifies as a “sustainable aviation fuel” — and thus for generous tax credits under the IRA — include ethanol and other plant-based fuels, despite <a href="https://www.wri.org/insights/us-sustainable-aviation-fuel-emissions-impacts" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">opposition</a> from <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/looking-for-a-greener-way-to-fly" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">environmental groups</a>. “The Biden administration plans to invest $4.3 billion to support production of 35 billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuel annually by 2050,” presenting a significant opportunity for Iowa’s farmers, <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/money/agriculture/2021/09/12/bidens-electric-car-push-doom-ethanol-farmers-us-ag-secretary-says-no-carbon-emissions-corn/8201034002/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>The Des Moines Register</em> writes</a>. As Vilsack added, “You have to think beyond cars and trucks.”</p><blockquote><em>“They want to have electric trucks, so a truck — a big, beautiful truck like Peterbilt or one of them, with the big ones, 18 wheelers, they can go about 2,000 miles, they say, 2,000 on a big tank of diesel. An electric truck, comparable — which it can’t be comparable because you need so much room for the battery. Most of the area that you’re going to carry your goods, going to be battery. But assuming we take away that problem, which is not easy to take away, you’d have to stop approximately seven times to go 2,000 miles, right? You go about 300 miles, and they don’t want to change that.” </em>[<a href="https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/trump-holds-rally-in-iowa-moments-after-colorado-supreme-court-blocks-him-from-ballot-transcript" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dec. 20, 2023</a>]</blockquote><p><strong>Fact check:</strong> There’s a lot to unpack here, but the gist is that most of <strong>these are the kind of early-stage problems you would find with any emerging technology</strong>. While <a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/electric-vehicles/electric-big-rigs-are-going-farther-and-charging-faster" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the technology</a> powering heavy-duty electric trucks is promising, there is still a long way to go when it comes to range and capacity.</p><p>Still, even a semi that goes only around 375 miles — longer than Trump’s estimate — on a single charge would ultimately be cheaper than a diesel truck, <a href="https://www.eesi.org/papers/view/fact-sheet-the-future-of-the-trucking-industry-electric-semi-trucks-2023#:~:text=Benefits%20of%20Electric%20Semi%2DTrucks,-Improved%20Health%20and&text=Lower%20Total%20Cost%20of%20Ownership,drivetrain%20also%20reduces%20maintenance%20costs." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one 2021 study found</a>. Because of the lower cost of ownership, electric semis have a net savings of $200,000 over a 15-year lifespan.</p><p>Battery size, and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/electric-trucks-longhaul-batteries-tesla-heavy-cargo-weight-problem-2023-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in particular battery <em>weight</em></a>, will be a major hurdle for long haul electric semis; shipping rates are often determined based on weight, among other factors, and since freight companies already operate on narrow margins, carrying less freight weight is a problem. But the technology is <a href="https://www.ttnews.com/articles/electric-truck-options" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">constantly improving</a>. Plus, it’s pretty silly to claim electric truck developers “don’t want to change” their range per charge; electric truck manufacturers are <a href="https://www.volvotrucks.com/en-en/news-stories/press-releases/2023/jun/volvo-presents-electric-trucks-with-longer-range.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">constantly boasting</a> about their new mileage numbers.</p><blockquote><em>“This electric car thing is just crazy.

In it, the Army stated that it aims to electrify all noncombat vehicles by 2035 and some tactical vehicles by 2050.</p><p>The reason the Army wants to go electric isn’t because of some woke environmentalist agenda, though. “The primary reason the Army wants to electrify its fighting vehicles is to reduce wartime casualties,” <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/environment-and-energy/us-armys-electric-tanks-on-hold-as-battery-technology-develops" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Bloomberg</em> writes</a>. “An all-electric fleet would mean personnel wouldn’t have to go on dangerous refueling missions that draw combat forces away from fighting the enemy … [and] electric vehicles are also much quieter and harder to spot on enemy surveillance systems because they generate so little heat.”</p><p>Trump has also slammed the Air Force for <a href="https://www.safie.hq.af.mil/Programs/Climate/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">its climate action plan</a>, although the roots of his claim that Biden wants to make jet fighters green by “losing 15% efficiency” are much less clear.

## We Fact Checked Everything Trump Has Said About Wind and Solar Since 2021

date: 2024-07-01, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjUxNjg3Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0NzcwNDkyOX0.g-KK9jzLet8m-LaRXBXvoMuYZcaTA23Cw9-UfmVp7Eo/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">Donald Trump loves eagles and whales and therefore he wants to protect them — from clean energy development. </p><p>Trump may, however, be relieved to hear that many of his concerns about wind and solar energy are unfounded. Here’s what he gets right and wrong.</p><blockquote>Pointing out the window to the Atlantic Ocean at one point, one attendee said, the former president claimed that offshore wind turbines break down when they are exposed to saltwater … [<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/04/17/trump-wind-power-oil-executives/" target="_blank">April 17, 2024</a>]</blockquote><p><strong>Fact check:</strong> Let’s just get this out of the way: <strong>offshore wind turbines are designed to withstand saltwater exposure</strong>. People have been building things in saltwater for a long, long time. From the oldest known ships constructed 6,000 years ago out of papyrus reeds to Norway’s Troll A platform — a reinforced concrete offshore natural gas platform and the tallest structure ever moved by humankind — we’ve learned a few things about resisting salt corrosion.</p><p>This scene occurred during a fundraising dinner with oil and gas executives at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort reported on by <em>The Washington Post</em>, which also pointed out this obvious fact. That said, to the former president’s credit, “the ocean is indeed a difficult environment” for construction and engineering, Eric Hines, a civil and environmental engineering professor and the director of the offshore wind energy graduate program at Tufts University, told me. But the lifespan of offshore structures can range from a few years to more than a century.</p><p>According to Hines, most offshore wind farms today are built to have “approximately 25-year service lives,” but the design is always evolving. His department, for example, is working on developing advanced underwater foundations that are built to last more than a century and double as artificial reefs.</p><blockquote><em>“I like the concept of solar, but it’s not powerful like what we need to fire up our factories.” </em>[<a href="https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/trump-rally-from-durham-new-hampshire-12-16-23-transcript" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dec. 16, 2023</a>]</blockquote><p><strong>Fact check:</strong> “That question is actually a little bit tricky,” Baker, the assistant professor of engineering at the University of Colorado, told me, when I asked him whether solar alone could power a factory — but <strong>it’s also not really what we should be asking</strong>. “One thing I’ve noticed people do a lot is they’ll just compare efficiency of power generation,” Baker explained. But “it’s not just about the efficiency — it’s about other things, too, like solar’s ability to be distributed. You can’t put a nuclear fission power plant in your house — you know, not yet — but you <em>can</em> put solar panels, so that’s a huge benefit. It offers some resiliency that other sources just can’t offer.”</p><blockquote><em>It’s true that solar power <em>is</em> less efficient than other sources of energy, including wind, and that it requires a lot of surface area, which could be an undue burden for a manufacturer. But at the same time, “I don’t know if anybody is proposing to power an entire factory based off of solar,” Baker said.“Their windmills are causing whales to die in numbers never seen before. Nobody does anything about that. They’re washing up on shore. I saw it this weekend: Three of them came up! You wouldn’t see it once a year; now they’re coming up on a weekly basis. The windmills are driving them crazy. They’re driving the whales, I think, a little batty.” </em>[<a href="https://x.com/atrupar/status/1706386955649396779?s=20" target="_blank">Sept. 25, 2023</a>]</blockquote><p><strong>Fact check:</strong> If you ever want to feel ridiculous, try asking a scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration if windmills are making whales “a little batty.”</p><p>NOAA actively studies how “sound, vessel, and other human activities” impact marine life, Lauren Gaches, the director of NOAA Fisheries Public Affairs, told me over email. “At this point, <strong>there is no scientific evidence that noise resulting from offshore wind site characterization surveys could potentially cause mortality of whales</strong>,” she said.</p><p>An ongoing “unusual mortality event” for humpback whales has resulted in 200 whale deaths between 2016 and June 2023 along the Atlantic coast from Maine to Florida — that much is true. But “there are no known links between recent large whale mortalities and ongoing offshore wind surveys,” Gaches told me. <a href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/new-england-mid-atlantic/marine-life-distress/frequent-questions-offshore-wind-and-whales" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NOAA’s fact page</a> on whales and offshore wind explains that of “roughly 90 whales examined, about 40% had evidence of human interaction, either ship strike or entanglement.”</p><p>There has been some chatter about underwater surveying work disrupting whales, which <a href="https://www.cbd.int/doc/meetings/mar/mcbem-2014-01/other/mcbem-2014-01-submission-seismic-airgun-en.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">may be true</a> in the case of oil and gas surveys, which use seismic air guns to penetrate deep into the ocean floor. The surveying equipment used for offshore wind is, by contrast, used in 15-second bursts and limited to a specific area, “so the likelihood of an animal encountering and coming right into that sound beam is quite low,” Erica Staaterman, the deputy director for the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management’s Center for Marine Acoustics, said on <a href="https://noaa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-01/Transcript-011823-NOAA-Fisheries-Media-Teleconference-East-Coast-whale-strandings-508.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a NOAA-hosted call with the press</a> early last year.</p><p>As Ben Laws, the deputy chief of NOAA’s Permits and Conservation Division in the Office of Protected Resources, said on the same call, “There is no information that would support any suggestion that any of the equipment that’s being used in support of wind development for these site characterization surveys could directly lead to the death of a whale.”</p><blockquote><em>“If you go out hunting and you happen to shoot a bald eagle, they put you in jail, like, for five years, right? They kill thousands of them with these windmills; nothing happens.” </em>[<a href="https://x.com/atrupar/status/1619400311847944192?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jan. 28, 2023</a>]</blockquote><blockquote><em>“If you want to see a bird cemetery, go under a windmill sometime. You’ll see birds like you never saw. If you love birds, you’ll start to weep.”</em> [<a href="https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/trump-rally-from-durham-new-hampshire-12-16-23-transcript" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dec. 16, 2023</a>]</blockquote><p><strong>Fact check:</strong> Trump has had a vendetta against wind turbines since <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/201032113686974464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E201032113686974464%7Ctwgr%5E6ad5e98bc0b4151341e73bac3045d6bae8fea167%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thetrumparchive.com%2F%3Fsearchbox%3D22wind22results%3D1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">long before</a> he ever ran for president. “Wind farms are killing many thousands of birds,” reads one illustrative tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/236213559191805953?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E236213559191805953%7Ctwgr%5E6ad5e98bc0b4151341e73bac3045d6bae8fea167%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thetrumparchive.com%2F%3Fsearchbox%3D22wind22results%3D1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">from 2012</a>. “They make hunters look like nice people!”</p><p>Lewis Grove is the director of wind and energy policy at the American Bird Conservancy, and he told me that while it’s “not necessarily as simple as Mr. Trump painted it out to be, <strong>wind turbines absolutely kill birds</strong>.”</p><p>But the context here is extremely important. Jason Ryan, a spokesperson for the American Clean Power Association, a leading renewable energy trade group, pointed me to research from the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service that shows wind farms “represent just <a href="https://www.fws.gov/library/collections/threats-birds" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">0.03% of all human-related bird deaths in the U.S.</a>” Grove likewise told me that, for the most part, bird deaths due to wind turbines do “not have population-level impacts.”</p><p>There are exceptions, such as an infamous wind farm in California’s Altamont Pass built in 1981 that “just happened to be in a place that was really heavily used by golden eagles,” Grove told me. Because golden eagle populations were already very low, having <a href="https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/campaigns/protecting_birds_of_prey_at_altamont_pass/pdfs/factsheet.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">100 or so</a> killed a year by turbines was “unsustainable.” Even in a case like this, though, it behooves one to look at the whole picture: “They found it was a few individual turbines that were causing the damage,” Grove said. These days, around 60 golden eagles a year are killed in Alameda County, <a href="https://alamedapost.com/features/alameda-life/making-wind-energy-safer-for-golden-eagles/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the<em> Alameda Post</em> reports</a>, and the operating company must pay steep penalties for eagle deaths.</p><p>What’s more, “climate change is one of the greatest threats birds face, with <a href="https://www.audubon.org/climate/survivalbydegrees" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">two-thirds of North American species</a> at risk of extinction due to our warming planet,” Jon Belak, senior manager of science and data analysis at The National Audubon Society, told me in a statement. “We need to build more wind and solar facilities to help slow the rise in global temperatures and protect birds and their habitats from a changing climate.”</p><p>Wind farms may not have population-level impacts on birds, but fracking does — “the onset of shale oil and gas production reduces subsequent bird population counts by 15%,” even after accounting for factors like weather and other land-use changes, according to one just-published, peer-reviewed study.</p><blockquote><em>“Remember the windmills? ‘Darling, darling, I want to watch the president, I love him so much. I want to watch him on television tonight.’ ‘I’m sorry, but the wind isn’t blowing, you’ll have to wait ‘til another time.’ Windmills.”</em> [<a href="https://x.com/atrupar/status/1507924183619194880?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">March 26, 2022</a>]</blockquote><p><strong>Fact check:</strong> “I mean, <strong>it’s possible with any mix of generation that if supply and demand aren’t equal, your TV will go out</strong>. That’s just physics,” Kyri Baker, an assistant professor of engineering at the University of Colorado, told me when I asked her if Trump’s scenario had any merit. In other words, a power outage could happen whether your electricity is coming from coal or natural gas or anything else. The difference, she said, is that “wind is by nature variable, intermittent. But it’s also not reliant on fuel like natural gas or coal plants or even nuclear plants are.”</p><p>What happens on days when there is no wind? “Grids are extremely regulated,” Baker explained to me. “There’s so many layers of redundancy that aim <em>specifically</em> to not have [an outage] happen.” A grid is made up of diverse electricity sources (for my visual learners, <em>Canary</em> imagines what a net-zero grid could look like <a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/chart-what-will-a-net-zero-grid-energy-mix-actually-look-like" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>), as well as measures like offline backup generators, which can kick in if need be, so service isn’t disrupted.</p><p>Battery storage is another huge part of this equation. While they’re still fairly cutting-edge as climate technology goes, high-capacity batteries that can manage grid-scale energy needs are getting <a href="https://e360.yale.edu/features/in-boost-for-renewables-grid-scale-battery-storage-is-on-the-rise" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">better</a> and <a href="https://www.energy.ca.gov/news/2023-10/california-sees-unprecedented-growth-energy-storage-key-component-states-clean" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more plentiful</a>.</p><blockquote><em>“Stop with all of the windmills all over the place that are ruining the atmosphere.”</em> [<a href="https://x.com/atrupar/status/1484358210089734145?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jan. 20, 2022</a>]</blockquote><p><strong>Fact check: Wind turbines do not damage the literal atmosphere.</strong></p><p>But maybe Trump meant atmosphere as in “sense of place”? Most Americans don’t seem to think windmills are “ruining” anything. In <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/change-polling-concern-belief-republicans-vs-democrats" target="_self">a recent Heatmap poll</a>, nearly eight in 10 Americans said they want the government to make it <em>easier</em> to build new wind farms. <em>The Washington Post</em> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2023/10/03/solar-panels-wind-turbines-nimby/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">similarly found last year</a> that about 70% of Americans said they wouldn’t mind living near a wind farm.</p><p>As my colleague Robinson Meyer <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/renewables-nimby-poll-solar-wind" target="_self">has written</a>, “American laws today give even a small, well-resourced minority plenty of tools to block a project” like a wind farm, and “what’s more, once that small group starts campaigning against a project, the public’s broad but shallow support for, say, a general technology can crater. That’s what happened recently in New Jersey, where a once broadly pro-wind public <a href="https://stockton.edu/news/2023/windmill-support-drops-hughes-poll.html#:~:text=In%202019%2C%2080%25%20of%20adult,today%20by%20the%20William%20J." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has turned against</a> four proposed offshore wind farms.”</p><blockquote><em>“It’s a very expensive form — probably </em>the most expensive form<em> of energy.”</em> [<a href="https://x.com/atrupar/status/1484358210089734145?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jan. 20, 2022</a>]</blockquote><p><strong>Fact check: Wind in general is not the most expensive form of energy, but <em>offshore</em> wind is very expensive — for now.</strong></p><p>Of the energy sources we’re currently used to, nuclear is usually cited as having the highest levelized cost of electricity — that is, it has the highest average cost per unit of electricity generated after construction, maintenance, and operation have been taken into account. Peaker plants — gas-powered plants that run just during times of peak demand — usually come in second.</p><p><a href="https://decarbonization.visualcapitalist.com/the-cheapest-sources-of-electricity-in-the-us/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Offshore wind <em>is </em>costly</a>, with the levelized cost of electricity from a subsidized U.S. offshore wind project increasing “to $114.20 per megawatt-hour in 2023, up almost 50% from 2021 levels in nominal terms,” <a href="https://about.bnef.com/blog/soaring-costs-stress-us-offshore-wind-companies-ruin-margins/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BloombergNEF reports</a>. Many of the factors making offshore wind so expensive — including <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/permitting-reform-transmission-nepa-geothermal" target="_self">permitting delays</a>, <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/high-interest-rates-clean-energy" target="_self">high interest rates</a>, and <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/everyones-mad-at-offshore-wind-developers" target="_self">supply chain issues</a> — will abate with time. Meanwhile, onshore wind is one of the <em>cheapest</em> forms of electricity available and has boasted a “lower LCOE than gas plants since 2015,” Sustainable Energy in America <a href="https://decarbonization.visualcapitalist.com/the-cheapest-sources-of-electricity-in-the-us/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reports</a>.</p>

This time, though, the ex-president and his allies also <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/how-trump-could-exit-the-paris-climate-deal-and-thwart-reentry/" target="_blank">plan</a> to make it more difficult for any future Democratic president to rejoin the international deal to limit global warming to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius.

	Trump’s most frequently proclaimed gripe with the climate treaty (beyond <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-climate-change-fact-check" target="_blank">not believing in climate change</a>) is that it rips off the U.S.
</p><blockquote>
<em><em>“The Paris Accord was going to cost us $1 trillion and China, nothing, Russia, nothing, India, nothing. It was a ripoff of the United States.” </em></em><em><em>[</em></em><a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/biden-trump-debate-paris-agreement" target="_self"><u><em><em>June 27, 2024</em></em></u></a><em><em>]</em></em>
</blockquote><p>
<strong>Fact check: This is inaccurate even by Donald Trump standards.</strong> In Trump’s 2017 Rose Garden address announcing the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement — the 2015 treaty that united most countries around the world in the quest to limit global warming to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius — Trump claimed that by 2040, compliance would entail a cost to the economy that would approach “$3 trillion in lost GDP and 6.5 million industrial jobs.” As proof, he cited <a href="https://www.globalenergyinstitute.org/sites/default/files/NERA%20Final%20Report%202.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a study</u></a> conducted by NERA Economic Consulting, which later <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/jan/21/wayne-christian/attacking-paris-accord-texas-oil-regulator-selecti/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>issued a news release</u></a> stating that “the Trump administration selectively used results” from its study and that “NERA’s study was not a cost-benefit analysis of the Paris Agreement, nor does it purport to be one.”
</p><p>
	The claim that China, Russia, and India would pay “nothing,” meanwhile, appears to be an allusion to the obligation for wealthier nations like the U.S. to direct hundreds of billions of dollars to poorer nations to adapt to the impacts of climate change. As my colleague Katie Brigham said, 
	<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/biden-trump-debate-paris-agreement" target="_self">it’s true there’s controversy</a> around whether China or India, which have giant (but still developing) economies, should either provide this funding or receive this funding. Russia, which joined the agreement in 2019, hasn’t really been a part of this conversation, though.
</p><p><em></em></p><blockquote>
<em>
	“I will also immediately stop crooked Joe Biden’s latest ripoff of the American people, his plan to give — listen to this — global climate reparations to foreign nations. He’s going to give billions of dollars, because he’s saying that we have a dirty climate.” </em>[<a href="https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/trump-rally-from-durham-new-hampshire-12-16-23-transcript" target="_blank">Dec. 16, 2023</a>]
</blockquote><p>
<strong>Fact check:</strong> The U.S. will not “under any circumstances” pay climate reparations to developing nations, climate envoy John Kerry <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66197366" target="_blank">vowed</a> in front of Congress last year. The situation is, however — and unsurprisingly — <strong>more complicated than that</strong>.
</p><p>
	At COP28 last year, the U.S. pledged $17.5 million to the UN’s “loss and damage” fund, which is intended to help developing countries recover from future climate disasters. While some outlets — including 
	<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/cop28-loss-damage-reparations-fund" target="_self">this publication</a> — have <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/12/2/reparations-fund-historic-but-real-fight-begins-now-climate-campaigners" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">characterized</a> this fund as “reparations,” the fund has more in common with <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/a-hilariously-sad-chart-of-cop28-climate-pledges" target="_self">other international pledges</a> directed at helping developing countries than calls for climate reparations that hold historic polluters morally and financially responsible.
</p><blockquote>
<em>“We have China that doesn’t partake; we have India that doesn’t partake; and we have Russia that doesn’t partake. None of them partake in cleaning the climate. They laugh at us, how stupid we are. We clean the climate and then their air flows to us from Asia.” </em>[<a href="https://x.com/atrupar/status/1499248966126518273?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">March 3, 2022</a>]
</blockquote><p>
<strong>Fact check:</strong> China, India, and Russia are all Paris Agreement signatories. But even if they truly didn’t “partake” at all in international climate mitigation efforts, <strong>that hardly means the U.S. shouldn’t try to be cleaner</strong>.
</p><p>
	But let’s take Trump at face value here. When asked to assess if the Paris Agreement gives an unfair advantage to nations like China and India, law professor Daniel Bodansky at the Arizona State University College of Law pointed out 
	<a href="https://www.statesman.com/story/news/politics/politifact/2021/01/27/fact-check-paris-climate-agreement-easier-china-india-than-united-states/4276557001/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to <em>USA Today</em></a> that “the United States is the second biggest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world and has higher per capita emissions than either China or India. It is misleading to point the finger at China and India and label them as the real polluters.”
</p><p>
	What about the bad air flowing to us “from Asia,” then? This isn’t total nonsense. For one thing, we 
	<em>do</em> all share the same atmosphere; that’s kind of the whole point of the global movement to stop climate change. But more concretely, yes, researchers have found that pollutants from China can make their way to the Western U.S.
</p><p>
	Here’s where it gets awkward: “An estimated 36% of manmade sulfur dioxide, 27% of nitrogen oxide, 22% of carbon monoxide, and 17% of 
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_carbon" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">black carbon</a> over China are the result of manufacturing goods for export. About a fifth of each of these was associated with products exported to the U.S. in particular,” <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/air-pollution-china-is-spreading-across-pacific-us-180949395/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Scientific American</em> writes</a>. In other words, a lot of that “bad air” flowing to us from Asia that Trump is complaining about is from manufacturing products for <em>Americans</em>.

## We Fact Checked Everything Trump Has Said About Climate and Weather Since 2021

date: 2024-07-01, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjUxNjg4MC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0MzgxMTU0N30.u2KvT_eMTUqqdt7iSoToYj8wLudo1Kq410GPKgeDnmU/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">
	Long before Donald Trump ever became a politician, he was a climate change denier. “I’m in Los Angeles and it’s freezing,” he <a href="https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/408977616926830592" target="_blank">tweeted</a> back in 2013. “Global warming is a total, and very expensive, hoax!”
</p><p>
	On the 2024 campaign trail, Trump has continued to claim that cold weather is proof that the planet isn’t warming — and that if it <em>is</em>,  the consequences won’t be that bad. If only he were correct.
</p><p>
	Here’s our fact-check of everything Trump has said about climate and weather since he left office in 2021.
</p><blockquote>
<em><em>“I want absolutely immaculate clean water and I want absolutely clean air — and we had it. We had H2O, we had the best numbers ever. And we were using all forms of energy, all forms of everything. And yet, during my four years, I had the best environmental numbers ever. My top environmental people gave me that statistic just before I walked on the stage.” </em></em><em><em>[</em></em><a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/trump-debate-best-environmental-numbers" target="_self"><u><em><em>June 27, 2024</em></em></u></a><em><em>]</em></em>
</blockquote><p class="rm-anchors" id="immaculate">
<strong>Fact check: </strong>Trump likes to claim that he is “<a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/09/donald-trump-environment-roosevelt#:~:text=Trump%20compared%20himself%20to%20conservationist,%E2%80%9CI%20am%2C%20I%20am." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the number one</u></a>” environmentalist president, but <strong>it’s hard to conceive of any metric where that could be true</strong>.
</p><p>
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/01/09/this-is-perhaps-trumps-most-cynical-comment-about-environment-yet/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Historically,</u></a> Trump has cited as evidence a book written by a longtime Trump Organization staffer that called him “An Environmental Hero,” as well as the fact that “I did the best environmental impact statements.” But Trump’s Project 2025 roadmap for a second term <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-climate-change-project-2025" target="_self"><u>details</u></a> targeting the waiver that allows California to set more stringent emissions standards for new cars, reducing fuel economy requirements, and making it more difficult to keep big polluters in check.
</p><p>
	Trump’s presidential record also speaks for itself: During his four years in office, he <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/climate-environment/trump-climate-environment-protections/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>rolled back</u></a> at least 100 environmental rules, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/climate/trump-environment-water.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>removing</u></a> pollution controls on streams and wetlands and <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/08/trump-coal-plan-will-kill-1400-americans-a-year" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>gutting</u></a> Obama-era emissions standards. According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-11/trump-s-environment-policies-killed-thousands-scientists-say" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>one estimate</u></a> in the British medical journal <em><em>The Lancet</em></em>, Trump’s environmental policies resulted in 22,000 deaths in 2019 alone. He’s been described as <a href="https://www.ecowatch.com/trump-worst-president-environment-2645034831.html?rebelltitem=4#rebelltitem4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the worst president</u></a> for the environment in U.S. history.
</p><p>
	During the presidential debate, Trump also referred to a “statistic” from his “top environmental people” that supposedly proved he had the “best environmental numbers ever.” He appeared to be referring to a message from his former Environmental Protection Agency administrator Andrew Wheeler that he <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/112689786167440697" target="_blank"><u>posted to Truth Social</u></a> before the debate, which claims that “CO2 emissions went down” during the Trump administration. This, in turn, appears to be an old talking point of Wheeler’s from 2019 about <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/1/19/22239074/affordable-clean-energy-rule-vacated-trump-court-climate-change-obama-biden" target="_blank"><u>the Affordable Clean Energy rule</u></a>, which he claimed would lead to a 34% reduction in CO2 emissions from 2005 in 2030. While that number is nearly correct, most of those reductions would have occurred <em><em>anyway</em></em>, without ACE. More accurate calculations for ACE can be found <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2019/01/wheelers-misleading-carbon-emissions-math/" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a>.</p><blockquote>“It’s not certainly great for your clime. Your clime. They call it ‘climate.’” [<a href="https://twitter.com/Acyn/status/1748881935735169176?s=20" target="_blank">Jan. 20, 2024</a>]
</blockquote><p>
<strong>Fact check: </strong>Trump’s mumbling about “clime” at a New Hampshire rally resulted in speculation about his <a href="https://uk.news.yahoo.com/trump-struggles-word-climate-reveals-190511795.html#:~:text=At%20a%20New%20Hampshire%20campaign,supporters%20at%20the%20Saturday%20event." target="_blank">mental</a> well-being — as well as <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/stephen-colbert-trump-climate-gaffe-b2483334.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a late-night bit by Stephen Colbert</a>. While <strong>it’s unclear exactly what Trump was going on about</strong>, we <em>can</em> get a few things straight:
</p><ul>
<li>“Clime” is usually used as a geographic term to refer to a <em>particular</em> region’s climate. As in, “<em>We left New York for the warmer climes of Florida.” </em>The Oxford Learner’s Dictionary says its use is usually “literary or humorous.”</li>
<li>“Climate” refers to weather patterns in a given area, taken as a whole. “When scientists talk about climate, they’re often looking at averages of precipitation, temperature, humidity, sunshine, wind, and other measures of weather that occur over a long period in a particular place,” <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/news/weather-vs-climate" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NOAA explains</a>. (A 30-year window is pretty typical when speaking about a place’s climate.)</li>
</ul><p>
	And just for good measure, “weather” differs from “climate” or “clime” in that it refers to short-term meteorological events in a specific place. So while the <em>weather</em> on a given day, week, or month can be unseasonably cold, the overall <em>climate</em> can still be warming.
</p><blockquote>
<em>“You know they don’t call it global warming so much now, they call it climate change because it wasn’t working … Global warming wasn’t working when it was cooling. So now they call it climate change, that takes care of everything.”</em> [<a href="https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1732231225895432458?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1732231225895432458%7Ctwgr%5E382b4d715f43b24d62c3fe54ba69a436836e41a6%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fd-35245541441656720993.ampproject.net%2F2312012346000%2Fframe.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dec. 5, 2023</a>]
</blockquote><p>
<strong>Fact check: </strong>The term “climate change” was initially popularized by Republicans. In a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/02/us/a-call-for-softer-greener-language.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2002 memo</a>, Republican pollster Frank Luntz urged President George W. Bush to drop the phrase “global warming” in favor of “climate change” since the former sounds more “frightening” and “has catastrophic communications attached to it,” while “climate change sounds a more controllable and less emotional challenge.”
</p><p>
	That said, <strong>scientists generally prefer the term “climate change”</strong> for pretty much exactly the reason Trump highlighted here — because it encompasses phenomena caused by the increase in CO2 in our atmosphere that don’t manifest as warming, like ocean acidification. For the record: Global warming doesn’t mean that the weather will <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/east-west-flood-blizzard-storm" target="_self">never get cold</a>, just that it will get <em>less</em> cold on average, over time. In fact, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-022-00498-3" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">research</a> shows that the cold parts of the globe are warming much, much faster than the rest.
</p><blockquote>

</cite>
</blockquote><p>
<strong>Fact check</strong><strong>: That’s … true, actually.</strong> “When the atmosphere warms, that means it can hold more water,” Matthew Rodell, the deputy director of Earth sciences for hydrosphere, biosphere, and geophysics at NASA, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/03/14/climate/extreme-weather-climate-change.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">who has made an extensive study of extreme drought and deluges</a>, told me. That means there will be both more droughts <em>and </em>more rainfall, even though the two phenomena might appear at a glance to contradict each other.
</p><p>
	“On the drought side of things, when the air is warmer, more water can evaporate — can be pulled out of the land and out of the plants, into the air, and then transported away,” Rodell explained. “So you have, basically, more water being net removed from an area.” But water in the air has to return to Earth, eventually, in the form of more — and often extreme — rainfall.
</p><p>
	Shouldn’t those two extremes effectively balance each other out? As Rodell put it to me, “Floods and droughts are both catastrophes.” During a drought, crops die and wells go dry. And while extreme rainfall might refill an aquifer, “if it’s at the point of being extreme and there’s a flood, <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/libya-floods-storm-daniel-derna" target="_self">that’s not good, either</a>.” Think about Libya, where extended heavy rains in the summer of 2023 broke through dams and inundated towns, killing 4,300 people, displacing an estimated 44,800 more, and causing <a href="https://www.trtafrika.com/africa/libya-allocates-dollar446m-for-post-flood-repairs-14939356" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">over $60 million in damage</a>.
</p><p>
	One last thing to mention here: While our ability to determine the precise contribution of climate change to individual extreme weather events is improving rapidly, that is, in some ways, beside the point. Rodell explained that “in terms of the frequency, and looking at all these events together and how they’ve changed over time, we’re seeing that they’re increasing in number and severity in correlation with global warming. That doesn’t mean you can say any particular event is 100% by global warming, but, I mean — statistically, it’s <em>extremely unlikely</em> that this is just a coincidence.”
</p><blockquote>
<em>“In my opinion, you have a thing called weather ...”</em> [<a href="https://x.com/atrupar/status/1505936005819514885?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">March 21, 2022</a>]
</blockquote><p>
<strong>Fact check: True!</strong>
</p><blockquote>
<em>“... It goes up, and it goes down.”</em> [<a href="https://x.com/atrupar/status/1505936005819514885?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">March 21, 2022</a>]
</blockquote><p>
<strong>Fact check: While it’s true that the climate has always changed, it hasn’t always changed like <em>this</em>.</strong> The rapid rise in both atmospheric carbon dioxide <em>and </em>observed average surface temperature since the Industrial Revolution can only be credited to humans, and specifically to the burning of fossil fuels, which release CO2, a heat-trapping gas. There is now near-universal<a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac2966" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> scientific consensus</a> that the warming we’re witnessing has been caused by human activity.
</p><p>
	“The most popular climate myths are the ones that are simple and easy to say,” as John Cook, a senior research fellow at Melbourne University’s School of Psychological Sciences who’s made a <a href="https://youtu.be/JuUz2AwoSko?list=PL1xbdG-NAkB1fAyNAWErM4uEXyduldiew&t=750" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">specialty</a> of <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aaa49f" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">combatting</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/H5kejSYPD7U" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">climate disinformation</a>, told me. “It’s the single-cause fallacy, thinking that only one thing can cause natural causes. But you can have other things like human activity that also drive climate change,” Cook added.
</p><p>
	Start digging into this kind of logic and it quickly falls apart. For example, Trump’s argument is that the climate has changed naturally in the past; therefore, it must be changing naturally now, as well. But, Cook told me, the same logic could also be used to argue, <em>People have died of cancer in the past; therefore, cigarettes don’t cause cancer now</em>.
</p><blockquote>

</blockquote><p>
<strong>Fact check:</strong> For starters, <strong>Trump’s numbers are orders of magnitude off the mark. </strong>The oceans are on track to rise <em>3.5 feet to 7 feet</em> along America’s coastlines by 2100 — well ahead of Trump’s schedule — according to <a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/hazards/sealevelrise/sealevelrise-tech-report.html#:~:text=About%202%20feet%20(0.6%20meters,the%20end%20of%20this%20century." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an independent assessment</a> conducted by federal scientific agencies. Even if global carbon emissions had peaked in 2020 (<a href="https://www.iea.org/news/global-co2-emissions-rebounded-to-their-highest-level-in-history-in-2021https://www.iea.org/news/global-co2-emissions-rebounded-to-their-highest-level-in-history-in-2021" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">which we know they did not</a>) and declined relatively rapidly thereafter, the oceans would <em>still</em> probably rise more than 3 feet worldwide by 2300 compared to their 2000 levels, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-02985-8/tables/1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">researchers have found,</a> because so much heat is already trapped in the climate system.
</p><p>
	According to the <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM_final.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">latest scientific report</a> from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, “sea level rise greater than 15 meters,” or 49 feet, by the year 2300 “cannot be ruled out” in a high-emissions scenario.
</p><p>
	While unlikely, 49 feet of sea-level rise would be catastrophic. Large swaths of lower Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens would be completely submerged, with waves lapping at the walls of Yankee Stadium and Citi Field. The southern half of Florida would vanish (bye-bye, Mar-a-Lago!). Countries like the Netherlands and Bangladesh would, literally, disappear from the map.
</p><p>
	As for that supposedly new oceanfront property Trump is so excited about, scientists expect some <a href="https://www.foxweather.com/extreme-weather/study-rising-sea-levels-flood-nearly-650000-oceanfront-properties-us-by-2050" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">650,000 beachfront properties</a> to flood due to sea level rise in the United States by 2050 — not to mention that globally, some <em>230 million people</em> <a href="https://urbanoceanlab.org/sea-level-rise" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">live within 3 feet</a> of current high-tide lines.

## Blinken: No main actors want war between Israel, Hezbollah

date: 2024-07-01, from: VOA News USA

State Department  — The United States is "determined" to prevent military conflict between Israel and Hezbollah fighters based in southern Lebanon from escalating into an all-out war, America’s top diplomat said Monday.


While acknowledging “forces of momentum ... may be leading” toward a war between Israel and Hezbollah, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, “None of the main actors actually want a war.”


“I don't believe Hezbollah actually wants a war,” he told an audience at the Washington-based Brookings Institution. “Israel doesn't want a war, although they may well be prepared to engage in one if necessary. ...


“Lebanon certainly doesn't want a war because it would be the leading victim in such a war,” he added. "And I don’t believe that Iran wants a war, in part because it wants to make sure that Hezbollah is not destroyed and that it can hold onto Hezbollah as a card if it needs it."




Blinken’s comments come as Israel signals that a military "downshift" in Gaza would allow its forces to allocate more resources to addressing the threat posed by the Iran-backed Hezbollah on the northern front.


As Blinken spoke, pro-Palestinian protesters outside the Brookings Institution could be heard through his microphone.


Blinken renewed his call on Hamas' leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, to accept a U.S.-proposed Gaza cease-fire and said Washington is “determined not to be outpaced” in Gaza's post-war reconstruction.


“We know that there are three things that are unacceptable for Gaza's future: an Israeli occupation; Hamas perpetuating its leadership; or chaos, anarchy, lawlessness, which is what we're seeing in big parts of Gaza today.”




In Jerusalem, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday said Israel is “advancing to the end of the phase of eliminating” Hamas' military capabilities in the Gaza Strip, nearly nine months into Israel’s war with the militants.


Blinken also defended U.S. President Joe Biden following Thursday night's presidential debate with former president Donald Trump, which many deemed a disappointing performance by Biden. Blinken said that U.S. allies “like the choices and the policies" Biden is pursuing.


China


In his foreign policy speech on Monday, Blinken also addressed China.


“I think China's objectives are clear. Over time, over the coming decades, they would like to be the leading country, the dominant country in the international system, militarily, economically, diplomatically, that's clear,” said Blinken.


While the U.S. has stated that its goal is to responsibly manage competition with China, the government in Beijing has refuted this, saying the relationship between the world’s two largest economies should not be defined by competition.


Chinese officials have said that “major-country competition” provides “no answer to the problems in the U.S. or the challenges in the world.”


The U.S. will host a NATO summit in Washington from July 9 to July 11, with a focus on European security amid Russia’s ongoing war against Ukraine.


Four countries from the Indo-Pacific region — Australia, Japan, South Korea and New Zealand — are set to attend the summit.


Secretary Blinken warned that while China is not directly providing arms to Russia, its supply of critical materials has helped Moscow sustain its war on Ukraine, posing serious repercussions for European security. Blinken said that 70% of Russia's imported machine tools and 90% of its microelectronics come from China.


Chinese officials have rejected what they describe as Washington's "smear," asserting that Beijing regulates the export of dual-use articles in accordance with its laws and regulations.

## Ladybird browser goes serious: GitHub billionaire co-founder now involved

date: 2024-07-01, from: OS News

Well, it seems we&#8217;ve got a better understanding now of why Andreas Kling decided to leave the SerenityOS project to focus entirely on Ladybird, the web browser that grew out of his hobby operating system. They&#8217;ve got some big plans for where to take Ladybird, and I&#8217;m saying &#8220;they&#8221; because it&#8217;s being backed by a big name. They&#8217;ve set up a fancy new website for the project, which makes it all look a bit more presentable to a general audience. The project is aiming for a first alpha release for Linux and macOS in 2026, and Windows or mobile versions are not something they&#8217;re currently interested in &#8211; they want to get the desktop version to be presentable first. It also seems we&#8217;re not in Kansas anymore &#8211; they&#8217;ve got four full-time paid engineers working on Ladybird at the moment, with three more starting soon. Sure, they&#8217;ve got some sponsors, but that seems like a lot of people, so where&#8217;s the cash coming from? Well, the project also announced its first two board members, and it won&#8217;t surprise you Andreas Kling himself is one of them. The other name is none other than Chris Wanstrath, and if that name doesn&#8217;t ring a bell &#8211; he&#8217;s the co-founder and former CEO of GitHub, which he sold to Microsoft in 2018. He also created the Atom text editor and led several other projects. Oh, he also happens to be a billionaire who apparently has donated 1 million dollars to Ladybird. In other words, the Ladybird project is a lot more of a serious, grown-up effort than it may have seemed when Kling first announced his departure from SerenityOS. This means the project has some serious money behind it, an influential name with probably some great networking skills, and, of course, Kling&#8217;s unique experience working on browser engines for Nokia and Apple in the past. All in all, this is great news.

## Below MI – IBM i for hackers

date: 2024-07-01, from: OS News

In this writeup we provide a summary of technical information crucial to evaulate the exploitability and impact of memory safety problems in IBM i programs. As administrators and developers of IBM i aren’t supposed to work “below MI level” this kind of information is not officially documented by the vendor. The information presented here is thus based on already published reverse engineering results, and our own findings uncovered using IBM’s System Sertice Tools (SST) and the POWER-AS specific Processor extensions we developed for the Ghidra reverse engineering framework. Tests were performed on a physical POWER 9 system running IBM i V7R4. Programs were compiled by the default settings of the system in the ILE program model. C language source code will be provided separately. ↫ Silent Signal Some light reading.

## US manufacturing contraction deepens in June

date: 2024-07-01, from: VOA News USA

Washington — U.S. manufacturing activity edged lower in June, deepening a recent slump on continued weak demand, according to industry survey data published Monday.


The Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) manufacturing index came in at 48.5% last month, down 0.2 percentage points from May.


The June data came in below market expectations of 49.1%, according to Briefing.com, and marked the third consecutive month where the reading was below the 50-point mark separating expansion from contraction.


"U.S. manufacturing activity continued in contraction at the close of the second quarter," ISM survey chief Timothy Fiore said in a statement.


"Demand remains subdued, as companies demonstrate an unwillingness to invest in capital and inventory due to current monetary policy and other conditions," he continued, referring to the U.S. Federal Reserve's ongoing battle against rising prices.


Inflation has fallen sharply since the Fed began hiking interest rates in 2022, but remains stuck above its long-term target of 2% — keeping borrowing costs high for both consumers and producers.


"Production execution was down compared to the previous month, likely causing revenue declines, putting pressure on profitability," Fiore said.


June's data extends the recent slump, which began after a positive reading in March briefly snapped 16 straight months of contraction.


The ISM survey found that eight manufacturing industries reported growth in June, including petroleum and coal products, and chemical products, while nine contracted, including textile mills, transportation equipment, and electrical equipment.


"Manufacturing activity remained in contraction territory in June, but in a sign of moderating inflation pressure, the prices paid component fell 4.9 points," Wells Fargo economists wrote in a note to clients.


"New orders rose more than any other component but remains in contraction," they added.

## US bases across Europe bracing for possible terror attack

date: 2024-07-01, from: VOA News USA

Washington — U.S. military bases and personnel across Europe are on heightened alert, after new intelligence warned of a possible terror attack targeting either facilities or personnel.


A U.S. defense official Monday confirmed to VOA that military installations across U.S. European Command (EUCOM) have been elevated to Force Protection Condition “Charlie,” which means an attack of some sort is likely.


The official did not elaborate on the contents of the intelligence that sparked the change, although counterterrorism officials from multiple countries have warned of an increased threat, including some surrounding the upcoming Summer Olympics in Paris.




The U.S. defense official said that the military is “taking extra steps to ensure [U.S. troops] remain vigilant during both business and pleasure activities.”


A second U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters, emphasized it was the overall threat picture and not one single piece of intelligence, that led to the increased force protection posture.


“There is no specific or imminent threat to U.S. forces in Europe,” the official told VOA. “This was a step taken out of an abundance of caution.”


A statement Monday from EUCOM likewise indicated the increased security measures are the result of a combination of factors.


“Our increase in vigilance is not related to any one single threat, but out of concern of a combination of factors such as ongoing and upcoming large public forums including the Euro Cup and the Olympics, along with an increasing the threat of attacks by potential bad actors against various non-military targets in Europe,” the statement read.


EUCOM “advises personnel in the European theater to remain vigilant and stay alert at all times, including reporting suspicious activity, monitoring Department of State travel advisories, and implementing prudent personal risk mitigation measures,” it added.


A report issued last month by the by the cybersecurity firm Recorded Future warned that despite a high risk of cyberattacks, the greatest threat to the Paris Olympics remains the possibility for terror attacks.




French authorities have already disrupted at least two separate terror plots. In one of the cases, the 18-year-old suspect was charged with plotting to carry out an attack on one of the stadiums serving as Olympic venues in the name of the Islamic State.


Top U.S. counterterrorism officials have also acknowledged that the Islamic State terror group, known as IS or ISIS, has also been gaining momentum in recent months.


Much of the concern has focused on the group’s Afghan affiliate, known as IS-Khorasan.


"Both ISIS and ISIS-Khorasan ... have demonstrated a capability and intent to conduct external operations," White House Deputy Homeland Security Advisor Jen Daskal told a counterterrorism conference in Omaha, Nebraska, last week.


National Counterterrorism Center Director Christine Abizaid also warned about IS-Khorasan this past May.


“This ability of the global ISIS enterprise, even without territorial solidity, the ability to reach out virtually to a network of supporters, some of whom are going to conduct attacks, is quite concerning,” she told a security conference in Doha.


Abizaid further called IS-Khorasan's ability to reestablish itself in Afghanistan “probably the most significant additive capability we’ve seen to the global ISIS network in the last three years.”


IS-Khorasan claimed responsibility for the January attack on a memorial service in Kerman, Iran, that killed about 90 people, and also the March attack on a Moscow concert hall that killed more than 140 people.


U.S. counterterrorism officials have also raised concerns that IS-Khorasan has become more adept at using transnational criminal networks and human smuggling rings, eying potential plots to send its operatives into the United States.

## We Fact Checked Everything Trump Has Said About Climate Change Since 2021

	Donald Trump has never been closer to returning to the White House than he is at this moment. Despite becoming 
	<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-charges-conviction-guilty-verdict/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a convicted felon</u></a> in early June, Trump <a href="https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/trump-vs-biden" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>was polling</u></a> on par with President Biden at the start of the summer — and that was <em><em>before</em></em> Biden’s <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/biden-trump-debate-paris-agreement" target="_self"><u>disastrous debate performance</u></a>. Now, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2014/08/25/the-coming-return-of-dems-in-disarray/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Dems really do seem to be in disarray</u></a> over <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/28/opinion/biden-election-debate-trump.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the best course of action</u></a> going into the critical final months before the November election.
</p><p>
	What voters ultimately decide will have significant ramifications for Biden’s climate legacy — namely, the fate of the 
	<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/the-inflation-reduction-act-remains-astonishing" target="_self"><u>Inflation Reduction Act</u></a>, the landmark bill enacted in 2022. In the years since the IRA’s passage, Republicans have <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/2024-election-climate-trump" target="_self"><u>become savvier</u></a> in their attacks on climate change, honing their rhetoric and misinformation about EVs, the energy transition, and climate science more broadly. The Heritage Foundation even published an extensive playbook on how, exactly, Trump should dismantle the progress made in <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-climate-change-project-2025" target="_self"><u>the green transition</u></a>.
</p><p>
	The stakes are consequential, to say the least: One recent estimate by 
	<a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-trump-election-win-could-add-4bn-tonnes-to-us-emissions-by-2030/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>CarbonBrief</u></a> found that a Trump reelection would add an extra 4 billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalent to the atmosphere by 2030 compared to a Biden reelection. That is enough to “negate — twice over — all of the savings from deploying wind, solar, and other clean technologies around the world over the past five years,” the report said.
</p><p>
	With the climate agenda on the line, Heatmap is keeping a running list of Trump’s climate-related statements on the campaign trail. We’ve looked at his rallies, TV appearances, social media comments, and debate quotes and compiled a list of his most frequent and blatantly 
	<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/trump-ev-charging" target="_self"><u>inaccurate</u></a> claims since he vacated the White House in January 2021. While some of his musings (okay, fine, a lot of them) might be laughably absurd, others might be something you’ve wondered about yourself. To help you better separate fact from fiction, we’ve added context and explanation to each quote, along with a bottom-line determination of the remark’s facticity.

## Street medicine teams search for homeless people to deliver lifesaving IV hydration in extreme heat

date: 2024-07-01, from: VOA News USA

Phoenix — Alfred Handley leaned back in his wheelchair alongside a major Phoenix freeway as a street medicine team helped him get rehydrated with an intravenous saline solution dripping from a bag hanging on a pole.


Cars whooshed by under the blazing 96-degree morning sun as the 59-year-old homeless man with a nearly toothless smile got the help he needed through a new program run by the nonprofit Circle the City.  


“It’s a lot better than going to the hospital,” Handley said of the team that provides health care to homeless people. He's been treated poorly at traditional clinics and hospitals, he said, more than six years after being struck by a car while he sat on a wall, leaving him in a wheelchair.


Circle the City introduced its IV rehydration program as a way to protect homeless people from life-threatening heat illness as temperatures regularly hit the triple-digits in America's hottest metro. Homeless people accounted for nearly half of the record 645 heat-related deaths last year in Maricopa County, which encompasses metro Phoenix.


Dr. Liz Frye, vice chair of the Street Medicine Institute that provides training to hundreds of health care teams worldwide, said she didn't know of groups other than Circle the City administering IVs on the street.


"But if that’s what needs to happen to keep somebody from dying, I’m all about it,” Frye said.


As summers grow warmer, health providers from San Diego to New York are being challenged to better protect homeless patients.


Even the Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program, featured in last year's book, “Rough Sleepers," now sees patients with mild heat exhaustion in the summer after decades of treating people with frostbite and hypothermia during the winter, said Dr. Dave Munson, the street team's medical director.


“It's certainly something to worry about,” said Munson, noting that temperatures in Boston hit 100 degrees with 70% humidity during June's heat wave. Homeless people, he said, are vulnerable to very hot and very cold weather not only because they live outside, but they often can't regulate body temperature due to medication for mental illness or high blood pressure, or because of street substance use.


The Phoenix team searches for patients in homeless encampments in dry riverbeds, sweltering alleys and along the canals that bring water to the Phoenix area. About 15% are dehydrated enough for a saline drip.  


“We go out every day and find them,” said nurse practitioner Perla Puebla. “We do their wound care, medication refills for diabetes, antibiotics, high blood pressure.”




Puebla’s street team ran across Handley and 36-year-old Phoenix native Phillip Enriquez near an overpass in an area frequented by homeless people because it’s near a facility offering free meals. Across the road was an encampment of tents and lean-tos along a chain-link fence.  


Enriquez sat on a patch of dirt as Puebla started a drip for him. She also gave him a prescription for antibiotics and a referral to a dentist for his dental infection.


Living outside in Arizona’s broiling sun is hard, especially for people who may be mentally ill or use sedating drugs like fentanyl that make them less aware of surroundings. Stimulants like methamphetamine contribute to dehydration, which can be fatal.


Temperatures this year have reached 115 degrees (45 Celsius) in metro Phoenix, where six heat-related deaths have been confirmed through June 22. Another 111 are under investigation.


“The number of patients with heat illnesses is increasing every year,” said Dr. Aneesh Narang, assistant medical director of emergency medicine at Banner Medical Center-Phoenix, which treats many homeless people with heat stroke.


Narang's staff works frequently with Circle the City, whose core mission is providing respite care, with 100 beds for homeless people not well enough to return to the streets after a hospital stay.




Extreme heat worldwide requires a dramatic response, said physician assistant Lindsay Fox, who cares for homeless people in Albuquerque, New Mexico, through an initiative run by the University of New Mexico’s School of Medicine.


Three times weekly, Fox treats infections, cleans wounds and manages chronic conditions in consultation with hospital colleagues. She said the prospect of more heat illness worries her.


Highs in Albuquerque can hit the 90s and don't fall enough for people living outside to cool off overnight, she said.


“If you’re in an urban area that’s primarily concrete, you’re retaining heat,” she said. “We're seeing heat exposure that very quickly could go to heat stroke.”


Serious heat stroke is far more common in metro Phoenix, where Circle the City is now among scores of health programs for the homeless in cities like New York, San Diego and Spokane, Washington.


Circle the City, founded in 2012 by Sister Adele O’Sullivan, a physician and member of the Sisters of St. Joseph Carondelet, now has 260 employees, including 15 doctors, 13 physician assistants and 11 nurse practitioners. It annually sees 9,000 patients.


Grants, donations and other gifts account for about 20% of the funding. Most of the rest comes from insurance payments for services provided through Medicaid and Medicare.


Circle the City works with medical staff in seven Phoenix hospitals to help homeless patients get after-care when they no longer need hospitalization. It also staffs two outpatient clinics for follow-up.  


“This partnership allows us to offer the best outcomes for our patients,” said Craig Orsini, social work manager at St. Joseph’s Hospital and Medical Center in Phoenix.


Often that's a few weeks in respite care or, for less acute needs, a stay in one of a handful of medical beds at the downtown shelter for things like dressing changes for wounds. Someone who needs months to heal might go to a skilled nursing facility.


While patients recover, Circle the City works to find longer-term transitional shelter such as those for people 55 and older, or in permanent housing. About 77% of respite patients are sent somewhere other than the street or an emergency shelter.


“We try to find the best fit for people,” said Wendy Adams, Circle the City’s community outreach supervisor.


Circle the City medical staff distributes tens of thousands of water bottles each summer and tries to educate people about hot weather dangers, said Dr. Matt Essary, who works at one of five mobile clinics that stop outside soup kitchens and other services for homeless people. 


Essary said Circle the City is also considering a blood analysis tool to detect electrolyte imbalances caused by dehydration.


“You can see right away how dehydrated they have become because it’s so hard to draw their blood,” he said. Other possible symptoms include headache, extreme thirst, dizziness and dry mouth.


“We also see a lot of people with surface burns,” Essary said of the wounds common in broiling Phoenix, where a medical emergency or intoxication can cause someone to fall on a sizzling sidewalk.


Rachel Belgrade waited outside Circle the City's retrofitted truck with her black-and-white puppy, Bo, for Essary to write a prescription for the blood pressure medicine she lost when a man stole her bicycle. She accepted two bottles of water to cool off as the morning heat rose. 


“They make all of this easier,” said Belgrade, a Native American from the Gila River tribe. “They don’t give you a hard time.”

## California lawmakers unveil $10 billion bond proposals for climate and schools

date: 2024-07-01, from: VOA News USA

SACRAMENTO, Calif. — California lawmakers on Sunday announced they plan to put two bond measures on the ballot in November, one that would ask voter approval to borrow $10 billion for climate programs and another that would borrow $10 billion to build or repair public schools. If passed by the Legislature later this week, the bonds would appear on the Nov. 5 ballot. Lawmakers announced the bond proposals on Sunday, one day after Gov. Gavin Newsom signed California’s budget. The spending plan closes an estimated $46.8 billion deficit in part through $16 billion in spending cuts.


“These bond measures are critical to the future of this state, and invest in our kids, their neighborhood schools, and they ensure communities big and small have access to clean drinking water and are wildfire safe,” Democratic state Senate President Pro Tempore Mike McGuire said in a statement.


The climate initiative would help communities recover from wildfires, floods, drought and other natural catastrophes.


The clean water and wildfire bond would cover $10 billion in strategic investments for safe drinking water, as well as funding for "wildfire and forest resilience, sea-level rise, extreme heat mitigation, clean air, and protecting biodiversity,” according to a statement from McGuire's office.


Officials said it would be the single largest investment in public funding for climate resilience in California’s history.


The second measure would provide $10 billion in borrowed money to modernize and repair schools. K-12 schools would get $8.5 billion, while California community colleges would receive $1.5 billion. The debt would be designated for new construction, improving existing campuses, career technical education and energy efficiency grants. 


“Districts will be able to ensure schools have essential facilities like kitchens and libraries, equip students with the skills for high-demand technical careers, and provide greater access to broadband internet," said Sen. Josh Newman, a Democrat who chairs the Senate Education Committee. “This bond ensures that our schools are safe, modern, and well-prepared for the 21st-century.”


Lawmakers passed the state budget last Wednesday after Newsom and legislative leaders both made concessions. They were forced for the second year in a row to pare back or delay some progressive policies that were previously paid for with the help of record-breaking surpluses during the COVID-19 pandemic.


The bond measures, if approved by voters, would allow legislators to borrow money not allocated by the budget. In March, voters narrowly — 50.18% to 49.82% — approved a plan to borrow $6.38 billion to build 4,350 housing units for homeless residents and add 6,800 mental health and addiction treatment beds.

Barbados, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadine Islands, Grenada, and Tobago – islands that don’t normally endure storms of this magnitude – are all under hurricane warnings and bracing for catastrophic damage. The storm is forecast to push toward Jamaica before weakening slightly mid-week and then heading toward Mexico. The system strengthened from a tropical depression to a hurricane in less than 48 hours, which is unusually fast. It was at one point registering as a category 4 storm (and could do so again), the earliest ever recorded in the Atlantic, marking an ominous start to what is expected to be a very intense hurricane season. “Incredible doesn't cut it,” <a href="https://x.com/NbergWX/status/1807564050676531216?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_4fMofAUm3pstgiKkxFwwOtGIDxbi59WI0oKpPy7664fLzUPlVrtgOlBZ4MPX-_rQxx3XJ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> meteorologist Jim Cantore. “This truly is something else of a hurricane.”</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

## The far-right wins big in France’s elections

date: 2024-07-01, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Marine Le Pen&#8217;s far-right National Rally party has pulled off a victory in the first round of elections in France and could turn French politics on its head. Then, with only three days to go before the United Kingdom’s general election, one of the big issues is housing costs. But are any of the political parties&#8217; pledges giving people hope that they can solve Britain&#8217;s housing crunch?</p>

## CCC fordert, den Vorschlag zur Chatkontrolle endlich zurückzuziehen

date: 2024-07-01, updated: 2024-07-01, from: Chaos Computer Club Updates

Die Idee der Chatkontrolle ist ein Angriff auf Verschlüsselung und bleibt eine Bedrohung für alle Menschen, die auf sichere private Kommunikation angewiesen sind. Deshalb fordert ein Bündnis aus mehr als vierzig europäischen Organisationen, die sich für Bürgerrechte und Kinderschutz engagieren, von dem gefährlichen Vorschlag der Chatkontrolle abzusehen und stattdessen endlich Maßnahmen für wirksamen Kinderschutz zu ergreifen.

## Electric Cars’ Heat Problem

date: 2024-07-01, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjUwOTYyOS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2NTc0MjgxNn0.Y_mBIcV8Z6FwaZGRwxm60gsm1h35JsGJ_ydeyd5nsZQ/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">If the world is going to slash greenhouse emissions from transportation, then we need a vast number of drivers to switch from fossil fuel engines to electric cars powered by renewable energy. Yet the EVs we need to mitigate further climate damage might, in one way, be ill-suited to the warmer and more extreme climate we’ve already created.</p>
<p>You may have heard that frigid temps are no friend of the electric vehicle. That is true, since <a href="https://www.recurrentauto.com/research/winter-ev-range-loss" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>extreme cold</u></a> is a two-pronged problem. First, physical processes in the battery happen more slowly if it’s chilly out. When the mercury drops, my Tesla Model 3 displays a little snowflake icon to warn me the battery unit is too cold to actually use all the range that should be in there. The second problem is maintaining a comfortable cabin. The battery expends a lot of energy generating enough heat to keep the interior warm for its occupants when the temperatures fall to freezing or below.</p>
<p>When it comes to hot days, that second problem is the big one. The agency Recurrent completed a <a href="https://www.recurrentauto.com/research/what-a-c-does-to-your-range" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>study</u></a> this month that demonstrated just how much range is lost on sweltering days like those of this month’s nationwide heat wave. </p>
<p>As long as the afternoon high temperature doesn’t get <em><em>too</em></em> high, an EV’s range loss is manageable. With an outside temp of 80 degrees Fahrenheit, they found the car loses only 2.8% of its range to keep the cabin at 70 degrees. Even at 90 degrees, the loss reaches just 5%. That amounts to just 10 miles lost from a 200-mile EV. You might not even notice it — it’s probably not that far off from what’s lost by driving 80 miles per hour down the freeway instead of the posted speed limit of 65.</p>
<p>When it’s dangerously hot out, though, the story changes quickly. At 95 degrees outside, the average EV loses 15% of its potential range. At 100 degrees outside, the car suffers a staggering 31% range loss to maintain 70 degrees inside the car. The bigger the difference between the outside temperature and the desired inside temperature, the more of your juice is lost to climate control rather than moving the vehicle. This is why range loss is typically worse in winter — a 10-degree day in Duluth means you’re 60 degrees away from the desired 70 Fahrenheit, while a 110-degree day in Phoenix is “only” 40 degrees from the target. </p>
<p>I’ve seen this phenomenon first-hand during scorching trips across the desert from Los Angeles to Las Vegas or up the interstate toward the San Francisco Bay Area, where the drive passed through areas that exceeded 110 degrees. The car offers an estimate for how much will be left on the battery upon arrival at the next charging stop — then that estimate slowly dips lower and lower as more energy is expended just on air conditioning. After a few anxious drives, I learned to hoard a bit more charge than the car thinks it needs to make it comfortably to the next station.</p>
<p>There is also the possibility that lots of <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/electric-vehicles-arent-ready-for-extreme-heat-and-cold-heres-how-to-fix-them/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>high-temperature driving</u></a> will cause long-term damage to the battery’s electrolyte or other components. There isn’t too much to do about this one other than limiting how often you drive on extreme days, if you can, and hope that future battery materials that are more resistant to heat become a reality sooner rather than later. </p>
<p>However, there are ways to mitigate the EV heat problem during your drive time. It takes more energy to air-condition the cabin down to the proper temperature than it does to maintain the temperature. So, if you’re plugged in to charge at home or at a public charger, have your vehicle reach the desired temp before you unplug and leave.</p>
<p>Also, the figures in Recurrent’s study are based on setting the climate control to 70 degrees. If you and your passengers can cope with a higher cabin temperature, say 75 degrees, then you’re shortening the difference by 5 degrees and giving your battery a break. (Plenty of EV adopters have gone through a moment of panic where they thought they might need to turn off the climate control entirely to ensure they reached their next plug-in.)</p>
<p>Should the planet’s new normal of extreme heat deter you from going electric? First, remember the manta that experts repeat as a rebuttal to range anxiety: Most people do the vast majority of their driving close to home. Running the A/C on max to survive an August trip to Trader Joe’s isn’t going to make your EV battery hit zero unless you were too low to begin with.</p>
<p>If you’re really worried about the extreme temperatures of your home region, then splurge for range. I’ve recommended this before regardless of where you live and drive. But if you live in the middle of the desert and can afford the longer-range version of a particular EV, then buy it and save yourself the mental strain of wondering whether the summer sun will limit how far you can really drive your car.</p>

## On being humble and accepting success

date: 2024-07-01, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>There’s a subtle difference between being humble and pretending to be something you’re not. If you are successful in some field you can—and should—recognise your success while still being humble and not letting the success make you arrogant. I find that not doing that, not recognising your success in any shape or form, can grind me in the wrong way. Because at some point you start to feel disingenuous. </p>
<p>People and Blog is a passion project. It’s not a “successful” project by any metric. Combining RSS, Email and the site, it probably has a few thousand readers. And don’t get me wrong, it’s great. I’m grateful for that and I’ll continue to post these interviews for as long as I can. 72 incredibly <a href="http://manuelmoreale.com/supporters">kind people</a> have also decided to contribute some of their money to support it and that’s also something I’m very appreciative of.</p>
<p>Still, I think of P&amp;B as a very niche side project, far from being a successful one. Now let’s imagine that instead of a few thousand, the P&amp;B audience was a few hundreds of thousands and instead of 72 people, 7000 were contributing something every month. At the current average that would net me almost 16000$ a month. That’s around 200k a year and it would make me in the top 0.5% of earners here in Italy. Could I still go around claiming my project was not successful? Hell no. I’d be a hypocrite if I were to do that. And you’d be rightfully pissed at me if I were still nudging you to support for 1$ a month while also being part of the 1%.</p>
<p>I find it interesting that the pursuit of endless growth is something we despise when corporations are doing it but it’s not something that bothers us too much when it’s done by “content creators”. And yet, after a certain scale, it’s the same mindset. This is why I love to support small creators who do things simply because they enjoy it and are not driven by other incentives.</p>
<p>I love something <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/pb-om-malik">Om said in his interview </a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I love supporting the small media, but don’t have time for establishment media outlets. I don’t much care for some of the larger blogs as well. And same goes for the larger YouTubers and podcasts. You need to catch them early — that’s when they really are pure and hustling to serve the reader.</p>
</blockquote>                <hr>
                <p>Thank you for keeping RSS alive. You're awesome.</p>

## GHC 9.6.6 is now available

date: 2024-07-01, from: Glasgow Haskell Compiler

<h1>GHC 9.6.6 is now available</h1>
<h4 class="text-muted">Zubin Duggal - 2024-07-01</h4>

<p>The GHC developers are happy to announce the availability of GHC 9.6.6. Binary
distributions, source distributions, and documentation are available on the
<a href="/download_ghc_9_6_6.html">release page</a>.</p>
<p>This release is primarily a bugfix release addressing some issues
found in the 9.6 series. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A fix for a bug in the NCG that could lead to incorrect runtime results due to
erroneously removing a jump instruction (<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/24507">#24507</a>).</li>
<li>A fix for a linker error that manifested on certain platform/toolchain combinations,
particularly darwin with a brew provisioned toolchain, arising due to a confusion
in linker options between GHC and cabal (<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/22210">#22210</a>).</li>
<li>A fix for a compiler panic in the simplifier due to incorrect eta expansion (<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/24718">#24718</a>).</li>
<li>A fix for possible segfaults when using the bytecode interpreter due to incorrect
constructor tagging (<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/24870">#24870</a>).</li>
<li>And a few more fixes</li>
</ul>
<p>A full accounting of changes can be found in the <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/9.6.6/docs/users_guide/9.6.6-notes.html">release notes</a>. As
some of the fixed issues do affect correctness users are encouraged to
upgrade promptly.</p>
<p>We would like to thank Microsoft Azure, GitHub, IOG, the Zw3rk stake pool,
Well-Typed, Tweag I/O, Serokell, Equinix, SimSpace, Haskell Foundation, and
other anonymous contributors whose on-going financial and in-kind support has
facilitated GHC maintenance and release management over the years. Finally,
this release would not have been possible without the hundreds of open-source
contributors whose work comprise this release.</p>
<p>As always, do give this release a try and open a <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/new">ticket</a> if you see
anything amiss.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

## Psycopg 3.2 released

date: 2024-07-01, from: PostgreSQL News

<p>After 846 commits and close to two years in the making, we are very happy to announce the release of <a href="https://www.psycopg.org/psycopg3/docs/">Psycopg 3.2</a>!</p>
<p>This release adds several new features to the Psycopg 3 line, some of which are:</p>
<ul>
<li>support for Numpy scalar types</li>
<li>easier to use notifications reception</li>
<li>the possibility to run queries with PostgreSQL-format parameters</li>
<li>a row factory to return a scalar from a query</li>
<li>asynchronous, encrypted cancellations</li>
<li>support for the many new features added in the upcoming PostgreSQL v17</li>
<li>OpenSSL 3.x bundled with binary packages</li>
</ul>
<p>A few bug bug fixes are included too, which have also been independently released in the 3.1.20 package. Given the high level of compatibility between 3.1 and 3.2, this could be the last release of the 3.1 line.</p>
<p>For further details please check out:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.psycopg.org/psycopg3/docs/news.html#psycopg-3-2">release notes</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.psycopg.org/articles/2024/06/30/psycopg-32-released/">news entry</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that several new features in the 3.2 release require libpq v17, but, because PostgreSQL version 17 has not been released yet, they are not immediately available in the binary packages. In order to use these features you will need a development version of libpq 17 on your system and to use the Python or C source distribution. New packages bundling libpq v17 will be released as soon as the official PostgreSQL 17 has been released.</p>
<p>Thank you very much to everyone who contributed to the project, especially to Denis Laxalde from <a href="https://www.dalibo.com/">Dalibo</a>, indefatigable libpq explorer and always available to solve challenging problems!</p>
<hr>
<p>Psycopg, first v2, now v3, is the de-facto standard for the communication between Python and PostgreSQL, two major components of innumerable businesses and mission-critical infrastructures. Maintaining such a critical library to the highest standard of reliability, completeness, performance requires a lot of care and work.</p>
<p>If you are a Python and PostgreSQL user and would like to make sure that the interface between the two is well maintained and continuously improved, please consider <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/dvarrazzo">supporting the project</a> and to be <a href="https://www.psycopg.org/sponsors/">one of our sponsors</a> 💜</p>

## pg_dumpbinary v2.18 released

date: 2024-07-01, from: PostgreSQL News

<p><strong>Grenoble, France - June 22, 2024</strong></p>
<h2>pg_dumpbinary</h2>
<p><code>pg_dumpbinary</code> dumps a PostgreSQL database to a binary format. The resulting dump must be restored
using <code>pg_restorebinary</code>, which is provided.</p>
<p>This is a maintenance release that fixes two bugs in the restore process.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix double copy statements when a table name requires to be quoted.</li>
<li>Fix error when restoring a table with a GENERATED ALWAYS column.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>pg_dumpbinary</code> is useful when:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have bytea that can not be exported by <code>pg_dump</code> because the
  total size of the escape/hex output exceeds 1Gb.</li>
<li>You have custom type that stores <code>\0</code> internally in bytea but data
  are exported by pg_dump as char/varchar/text.  In this case pg_dump
  truncates all data after the first <code>\0</code>, resulting in data loss.</li>
<li>Other cases where a binary output format is useful.</li>
</ul>
<p>In these kinds of cases <code>pg_dumpbinary</code> helps by dumping the
PostgreSQL database in a binary format. In all other cases
the pg_dump/pg_restore commands distributed with PostgreSQL are
preferred.</p>
<p>See the documentation for a more complete description of available
features.</p>

## Greenmask v0.2.0b1 Release

date: 2024-07-01, from: PostgreSQL News

<h1>Greenmask v0.2.0b1 Release</h1>
<h2>PostgreSQL Logical Dump and Anonymization Tool</h2>
<p>This major <strong>beta release</strong> introduces new features and refactored transformers, significantly enhancing Greenmask's flexibility to better meet business needs. Help us improve GreenMask and tailor it to meet community needs. We welcome your feedback in the <a href="https://github.com/GreenmaskIO/greenmask/discussions/129">release discussion on GitHub</a>.</p>
<h2>Greenmask Overview</h2>
<p>Greenmask is a versatile open-source tool for database backup, anonymization, and restoration. Written in pure Go with ported PostgreSQL libraries, it is platform-independent and stateless, requiring no schema modifications. It is customizable and compatible with existing PostgreSQL utilities.</p>
<h3>Greenmask is ideally suited for:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Routine backup and restoration tasks, ensuring data integrity and availability.</li>
<li>Anonymization and data masking for staging environments and analytics, <strong>protecting sensitive</strong> information while maintaining data utility.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Key features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deterministic transformers</strong> — deterministic approach to data transformation based on the hash
  functions. This ensures that the same input data will always produce the same output data. Almost each transformer
  supports either <code>random</code> or <code>hash</code> engine making it universal for any use case.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic parameters</strong> — almost each transformer supports dynamic parameters, allowing to parametrize the
  transformer dynamically from the table column value. This is helpful for resolving the functional dependencies 
  between columns and satisfying the constraints.</li>
<li><strong>Database type safe</strong> - Ensures data integrity by validating data and utilizing the database driver for
  encoding and decoding operations. This approach guarantees the preservation of data formats.</li>
<li><strong>Transformation validation and easy maintainable</strong> - During obfuscation development, Greenmask provides validation
  warnings and a transformation diff feature, allowing you to monitor and maintain transformations effectively
  throughout the software lifecycle.</li>
<li><strong>Partitioned tables transformation inheritance</strong> - Define transformation configurations once and apply them to all
  partitions within partitioned tables, simplifying the obfuscation process.</li>
<li><strong>Stateless</strong> - Greenmask operates as a logical dump and does not impact your existing database schema.</li>
<li><strong>Backward compatible</strong> - It fully supports the same features and protocols as existing vanilla PostgreSQL utilities.
  Dumps created by Greenmask can be successfully restored using the pg_restore utility.</li>
<li><strong>Extensible</strong> - Users have the flexibility to implement domain-based transformations in any programming language or
  use predefined templates.</li>
<li><strong>Provide a variety of storage</strong> - Greenmask offers a variety of storage options for local and remote data storage,
  including directories and S3-like storage solutions.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Playground usage for the beta version</h2>
<p>If you want to run a Greenmask <a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/playground/">playground</a> for the beta version execute:</p>
<p><code>git checkout tags/v0.2.0b1 -b v0.2.0b1
docker-compose run greenmask-from-source</code></p>
<h2>Changes overview</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/dynamic_parameters/">Introduced dynamic parameters in the transformers</a><ul>
<li>Most transformers now support dynamic parameters where applicable.</li>
<li>Dynamic parameters are strictly enforced. If you need to cast values to another type, Greenmask provides templates and predefined cast functions accessible via <code>cast_to</code>. These functions cover frequent operations such as <code>UnixTimestampToDate</code> and <code>IntToBool</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The transformation logic has been significantly refactored, making transformers more customizable and flexible than before.</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/transformation_engines/">Introduced transformation engines</a></p>
<ul>
<li><code>random</code> - generates transformer values based on pseudo-random algorithms.</li>
<li><code>hash</code> - generates transformer values using hash functions. Currently, it utilizes <code>sha3</code> hash functions, which are secure but perform slowly. In the stable release, there will be an option to choose between <code>sha3</code> and <code>SipHash</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/parameters_templating/">Introduced static parameters value template</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Notable changes</h2>
<h3>Core</h3>
<ul>
<li>Introduced the <code>Parametrizer</code> interface, now implemented for both dynamic and static parameters.</li>
<li>Renamed most of the toolkit types for enhanced clarity and comprehensive documentation coverage.</li>
<li>Refactored the <code>Driver</code> initialization logic.</li>
<li>Added validation warnings for overridden types in the <code>Driver</code>.</li>
<li>Migrated existing built-in transformers to utilize the new <code>Parametrizer</code> interface.</li>
<li>Implemented a new abstraction, <code>TransformationContext</code>, as the first step towards enabling new feature transformation conditions (#34).</li>
<li>Optimized most transformers for performance in both dynamic and static modes. While dynamic mode offers flexibility, static mode ensures performance remains high. Using only the necessary transformation features helps keep transformation time predictable.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Documentation</h3>
<p>Documentation has been significantly refactored. New information about features and updates to transformer descriptions have been added.</p>
<h3>Transformers</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/standard_transformers/random_email/">RandomEmail</a> - Introduces a new transformer that supports both random and deterministic engines. It allows for flexible email value generation; you can use column values in the template and choose to keep the original domain or select any from the <code>domains</code> parameter.</p>
</li>
<li>

Unlike previous implementations which used a single <code>ratio</code> parameter, the new release features <code>min_ratio</code> and <code>max_ratio</code> parameters to define noise values more precisely. Utilizing the <code>hash</code> engine in these transformers enhances security by complicating statistical analysis for attackers, especially when the same salt is used consistently over long periods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/standard_transformers/noise_numeric/">NoiseNumeric</a> - A newly implemented transformer, sharing features with <code>NoiseInt</code> and <code>NoiseFloat</code>, but specifically designed for numeric values (large integers or floats). It provides a <code>decimal</code> parameter to handle values with fractions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/standard_transformers/random_choice/">RandomChoice</a> - Now supports the <code>hash</code> engine</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/standard_transformers/random_date/">RandomDate</a>, <a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/standard_transformers/random_float/">RandomFloat</a>, <a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/standard_transformers/random_int/">RandomInt</a> - Now enhanced with hash engine support.

</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/standard_transformers/random_string/">RandomString</a> - Now supports hash engine mode</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/standard_transformers/random_unix_timestamp/">RandomUnixTimestamp</a> - This new transformer generates Unix timestamps with selectable units (<code>second</code>, <code>millisecond</code>, <code>microsecond</code>, <code>nanosecond</code>). Similar in function to <code>RandomDate</code>, it supports the hash engine and dynamic parameters for <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> thresholds, with the ability to override these units using <code>min_unit</code> and <code>max_unit</code> parameters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/standard_transformers/random_uuid/">RandomUuid</a> - Added hash engine support</p>

This new transformer offers enhanced customizability while providing similar functionalities as the previous versions. It generates personal data such as <code>FirstName</code>, <code>LastName</code>, and <code>Title</code>, based on the provided <code>gender</code> parameter, which now supports dynamic mode. Future minor versions will allow for overriding the default names database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added <a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/advanced_transformers/custom_functions/core_functions/#tsmodify">tsModify</a> - a new template function for time.Time objects modification</p>

## Celebrating five years of Grant IDs: where are we with the Crossref Grant Linking System?

date: 2024-07-01, from: Crossref Blog

<p>We’re happy to note that this month, we are marking five years since Crossref launched its Grant Linking System. The Grant Linking System (GLS) started life as a joint community effort to create ‘grant identifiers’ and support the needs of funders in the scholarly communications infrastructure.</p>
<div class="shortcode-divwrap align-right">
<span><img src="https://www.crossref.org/images/community-images/gls/gls-logo-stacked.png" alt="Crossref Grant Linking System logo" width="100%" ></span>
</div>
The system includes a funder-designed metadata schema and a unique link for each award which enables connections with millions of research outputs, better reporting on the research and outcomes of funding, and a contribution to open science infrastructure. Our first activity to highlight the moment was to host a community call last week where around 30 existing and potential funder members joined to discuss the benefits and the steps to take to participate in the Grant Linking System (GLS).
<p>Some organisations at the forefront of adopting Crossref’s Grant Linking System presented their challenges and how they overcame them, shared the benefits they are reaping from participating, and provided some tips about their processes and workflows.</p>
<p>The funding organisations whose experiences were shared included <a href="https://wellcome.org/" target="_blank">Wellcome</a>, <a href="https://www.fct.pt/en/" target="_blank">FCT (Foundation for Science and Technology, Portugal)</a>, and <a href="https://www.nwo.nl/en" target="_blank">NWO (Dutch Research Council)</a>. They were joined by a new group of foundations, research councils, and private research funders from around the world&mdash;from Kenya to Singapore to Estonia&mdash;to have a first introduction to the GLS and connect them with colleagues who are further along on their journey.</p>
<p>We also heard about tools such as a new <a href="https://github.com/oaworks/create-grant-doi-in-fluxx" target="_blank">open source Crossref plugin</a> for the Fluxx platform, grant management systems with in-built Crossref integrations such as <a href="https://proposalcentral.com/" target="_blank">ProposalCentral</a>, <a href="https://europepmc.org/grantfinder" target="_blank">Europe PMC GrantFinder</a> which was first to implement the GLS on Wellcome’s behalf and hosts their grants, and one of the first publishers, <a href="https://elifesciences.org/" target="_blank">eLife</a> to start referencing Crossref grant links in their publications both online and in the open metadata for others to retrieve.</p>
<p>Read on for further information or watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2eMOTmN8" target="_blank">the recording of the event</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-crossref-grant-linking-system">What is the Crossref Grant Linking System?</h2>
<p>The Crossref Grant Linking System, conceptualised in 2017, and launched in 2019, captures and helps clarify funding relationships for scholarly outputs. Thanks to interconnectedness with the 160 million metadata records collected and curated by Crossref members, it enables funders as well as scholars to track and analyse funding patterns and evaluate programmes, and it supports assertions about the integrity of scholarly records.</p>
<h3 id="features-of-the-gls">Features of the GLS</h3>
<ul>
<li>Globally unique persistent link and identifier for each grant</li>
<li>Connected with 160 million published outputs</li>
<li>Funder-designed metadata schema, including project, investigator, value, and award-type information</li>
<li>Programmatic or no-code methods to send metadata
<ul>
<li>Thanks to the <a href="https://www.moore.org/" target="_blank">Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation</a> who funded development of the <a href="https://manage.crossref.org/records" target="_blank">online grant registration form</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Open search and API for all to discover funding outcomes; all metadata is distributed openly to thousands of tools and services</li>
<li>Crossref-hosted landing pages</li>
<li>A global community of ~50 funder advisors and 35+ funders already in the Grant Linking System</li>
<li>Membership of Crossref; influence the foundational infrastructure powering open research</li>
</ul>
<p>The last five years has seen the GLS grow through membership, metadata, and community contributions.</p>

alt="graph showing the effects of specific funders joining that increase matches and relationships in the Crossref Grant Linking System" width="100%">
</figure>
<br>
The momentum for this programme is building - as illustrated by increasing numbers of metadata records (and related relationships we’re seeing). The 35 funder members represent over 100 funding programmes and have created 125,000 grant records already.</p>

</figure>
<p>During last week&rsquo;s call, it was helpful to hear from the community what they see as key benefits of the Crossref Grant Linking System:</p>
<div class='shortcode-row '>
<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12 no-first-para-highlight"><ul>
<li>Meaningfully delivering on and supporting Open Science policies and mandates, and contributing ‘their bit’ to the transparency of the evidence trail in the scholarly ecosystem.</li>
<li>Reporting and evaluating the funding programmes, essential for the public funders who need to demonstrate the value for money in allocating their funds and other support.</li>
<li>Supporting a more holistic assessment of scholarship and scholars, especially as and when metadata becomes included with a full array of outputs, not limited to books and articles.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12 no-first-para-highlight"><img src="https://www.crossref.org/images/community-images/gls/gls-benefits.png" alt="High-level benefits of the Crossref Grant Linking System (GLS)" width="100%" >
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="how-the-crossref-grant-linking-system-supports-open-science-policy">How the Crossref Grant Linking System supports Open Science policy</h2>
<p>Since 2020, all the grant records are openly available through our REST API which is queried more than 1.8 billion times every month so these metadata records are distributed to thousands of systems across the research enteprise. In a 2022 blog, Ed Pentz and Ginny Hendricks laid out <a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/how-funding-agencies-can-meet-ostp-and-open-science-guidance-using-existing-open-infrastructure/">guidelines for research funders to meet open science guidelines</a> using existing open infrastructure such as Crossref, ORCID, and ROR. Syman Stevens, a grantmaking and private philanthropy consultant, highlighted on the call that the funders he works with are increasingly interested in ways to deliver on their open science policy and that particpation in the GLS is a tangible thing they can do to meet this goal.</p>
<div class="quotecite">
<blockquote>
<p>As part of its open science policy, NWO will start participating in the Crossref Grant Linking System from July 2025. Research funders are a part of the scholarly communications system; we not only provide the funding to do the actual research but can also be the authoritative source of data about the projects we have funded and the outputs arising from that funding. Increasingly, all these elements – grants, researchers, outputs - are linked with metadata and unique identifiers to ensure that research is findable and accessible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><cite>&ndash; Hans de Jonge, Director of Open Science NL, part of the Dutch Research Council (NWO)</cite></p>
</div>
<h2 id="how-funders-leverage-the-grant-linking-system-in-their-reporting-and-assessment">How funders leverage the Grant Linking System in their reporting and assessment</h2>
<p>Looking back to the origins of the system, it’s important to recognise the work of the initial working groups. Through their contribution, funders helped design the initial metadata schema for grants as well as establish the governance and fees for this service, and our Advisory Group continues to inform further developments. In this way, the Grant Linking System enables the needs and wishes of funders to contribute and see their data as part of the wider ecosystem.</p>
<p>An excellent example of that synergy in action is the use case presented by Cátia Laranjeira, manager of the PTCRIS programme at the Foundation for Science and Technology, Portugal (FCT). PTCRIS is the Foundation’s integrated national information ecosystem that supports scientific activity management. Cátia reflected on the relative fragmentation of spaces where the scientific outputs are found, and PTCRIS’s ambition for aggregating metadata in one place to be able to trace and evaluate programmes in light of the related outputs. At the start of the programme, they identified lack of a persistent identifier for grants as a major shortcoming of the system. Crossref GLS naturally fits in with their goals.</p>
<div class="quotecite">
<blockquote>
<p>The initiative by FCT to assign unique DOIs to national public funding through Crossref is a game-changer for open science, linking funding directly to scientific outcomes and boosting transparency. Join us in this effort—let&rsquo;s make every grant count and ensure open access to research information!&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><cite>&ndash; Cátia Laranjeira, PTCRIS Program Manager at Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologis (FCT Portugal)</cite></p>
</div>
<p>FCT initially piloted a small subset of their grants (approximately 6,000 recent awards) at the end of 2023. Cátia pointed to researchers’ keen participation in this programme as one of its successes – and thanks to the word of mouth, FCT has already been approached by researchers requesting unique Crossref links for their grants! This appetite for grant IDs will soon be more fully satisfied, as FCT is readying to register all of their grants with Crossref, to enable further insights into funding and outcome flows, supporting them in demonstrating the value for money for the public resources they manage. Via interfaces for grant management and standardised online CVs, the system is also enabling researchers to use the system in their own future reporting and career development.</p>
<p>In the ensuing discussion, Rachel Bruce of UKRI mentioned that she’s hopeful that GLS will help funders ‘close the loop’ on more holistic reward and recognition, allowing for inclusion of evidence for a broader set of outputs in those processes.</p>
<h2 id="how-the-community-is-working-to-integrate-open-infrastructure">How the community is working to integrate open infrastructure</h2>
<p>Melissa Harrison, Team Leader at EMBL-EBI, manages Europe PMC and a complementary data science team, who were part of the initial FREYA project – supporting infrastructure delivery for unique identifiers for grants. The team has been adding grant records to Crossref on Wellcome’s behalf since 2019. Melissa highlighted the shortcomings of internal award numbers, which don’t tend to be understood outside of the ecosystem where they are produced (that is the funder’s administrative system), are almost certainly not unique, and don’t resolve to or connect with anything in the wider ecosystem. Therefore internal award numbers can’t signify relationships with other outputs or assets in the wider world. By contrast, Crossref’s Grant IDs are unique, persistent, resolvable, and interrelated with other Crossref metadata, whilst being retrievable for other systems to link to too.</p>

<p>Persistent identifiers for grants was the next logical step after identifiers for funders - open metadata registered with a PID in a central service like Crossref is invaluable to build the full picture of the research enterprise.</p>

<p>Ease of execution is important for scaling the Grant Linking System, and enabling its use in a diverse set of circumstances in the open science ecosystem. Altum was the trailblazer, first integrating its grant management platform Proposal Central with GLS. It was good to hear that others are now joining the integration efforts. Syman Stevens talked about the recent work initiated by Joe McArthur at <a href="https://oa.works/" target="_blank">OA Works</a>, to develop a simple, open-source plug-in for any of the major grant management systems, to enable funders to deposit their grant metadata with Crossref GLS with a click of the button. Syman demonstrated the resulting interface in Fluxx, that allows for creating a record and sending grant metadata to Crossref as part of the regular grant management within the platform. He pointed out that, while this integration was developed for Fluxx, all code and documentation is openly available on <a href="https://github.com/oaworks/create-grant-doi-in-fluxx" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and this can potentially be forked or adapted as necessary for reuse in other grant management systems.</p>
<p>It is heartening that others in the community are seeing such a need for this that they&rsquo;re funding and creating their own tools to advance participation and use of the GLS.</p>
<p>Finally, Fred Atherden, Head of Production Operations at eLife, presented how they include Crossref grant identifiers in publication metadata for the version of record of the works published on their platform. eLife is the first publisher to fully integrate Crossref grant identifiers both within the article display and in the metadata. Fred shared that in addition to collecting the data from the authors, eLife also attempts matching, albeit using very restrictive methodology, to enable more grant metadata in their publication records. They recognise that so far there are very few publishers including persistent links for grants in this way, and talked about plans to start collecting and including this data further upstream, and including them in the future for reviewed preprints.</p>
<h2 id="acknowledgements-and-how-to-participate-in-the-gls">Acknowledgements and how to participate in the GLS</h2>
<p>Reflecting on the last five years, thanks must go to the &gt;35 funders who are already participating (see logo mashup below), to our <a href="https://www.crossref.org/working-groups/funders">current volunteers</a> and to those partners working to promote and make use of the Grant Linking System. We also acknowledge that the GLS would not have been possible without the Crossref board members at the time, our staff including alumni Josh Brown, Rachael Lammey, and Geoffrey Bilder, or without the early dedicated time and input from the following people and organisations on our working groups for governance and fees, and for metadata modelling:</p>

<p>Grant DOIs enhance the discovery and accessibility of funded project information and are one of the important links in a connected research ecosystem. I&rsquo;m grateful and proud to contribute to the robustness and interconnectedness of the research infrastructure. Few funders are currently participating in the Crossref Grant Linking System, and I encourage others to consider doing so. This adoption follows the &ldquo;network effect,&rdquo; where the value and utility increase as more people participate, encouraging even wider adoption.</p>
