<h2 id="a-google-breakup-is-on-the-table-say-doj-lawyers">A Google
breakup is on the table, say DOJ lawyers</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-13, from: OS News</p>
<p>Next up in my backlog of news to cover: the US Department of
Justice’s proposed remedies for Google’s monopolistic abuse. Now that
Judge Amit Mehta has found Google is a monopolist, lawyers for the
Department of Justice have begun proposing solutions to correct the
company’s illegal behavior and restore competition to the market for
search engines. In a new 32-page filing (included below), they said they
are considering both “behavioral and structural remedies.“ That covers
everything from applying a consent decree to keep an eye on the
company’s behavior to forcing it to sell off parts of its business, such
as Chrome, Android, or Google Play. ↫ Richard Lawler at The Verge While
I think it would be a great idea to break Google up, such an action
taken in a vacuum seems to be rather pointless. Say Google is forced to
spin off Android into a separate company – how is that relatively small
Android, Inc. going to compete with the behemoth that is Apple and its
iOS to which such restrictions do not apply? How is Chrome Ltd. going to
survive Microsoft’s continued attempts at forcing Edge down our
collective throats? Being a dedicated browser maker is working out great
for Firefox, right? This is the problem with piecemeal, retroactive
measures to try and “correct” a market position that you have known for
years is being abused – sure, this would knock Google down a peg, but
other, even larger megacorporations like Apple or Microsoft will be the
ones to benefit most, not any possible new companies or startups. This
is exactly why a market-wide, equally-applied set of rules and
regulations, like the European Union’s Digital Markets Act, is a far
better and more sustainable approach. Unless similar remedies are
applied to Google’s massive competitors, these Google-specific remedies
will most likely only make things worse, not better, for the American
consumer.</p>

<h2 id="internet-archive-hacked-and-victim-of-ddos-attacks">Internet
Archive hacked and victim of DDoS attacks</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-13, from: OS News</p>
<p>Internet Archive’s “The Wayback Machine” has suffered a data breach
after a threat actor compromised the website and stole a user
authentication database containing 31 million unique records. News of
the breach began circulating Wednesday afternoon after visitors to
archive.org began seeing a JavaScript alert created by the
hacker, stating that the Internet Archive was breached. “Have you ever
felt like the Internet Archive runs on sticks and is constantly on the
verge of suffering a catastrophic security breach? It just happened. See
31 million of you on HIBP!,” reads a JavaScript alert shown on the
compromised archive.org site. ↫ Lawrence Abrams at Bleeping Computer To
make matters worse, the Internet Archive was also suffering from waves
of distributed denial-of-service attacks, forcing the IA to take down
the site while strengthening everything up. It seems the attackers have
no real motivation, other than the fact they can, but it’s interesting,
shall we say, that the Internet Archive has been under legal assault by
big publishers for years now, too. I highly doubt the two are related in
any way, but it’s an interesting note nonetheless. I’m still catching up
on all the various tech news stories, but this one was hard to miss. A
lot of people are rightfully angry and dismayed about this, since
attacking the Internet Archive like this kind of feels like throwing
Molotov cocktails at a local library – there’s literally not a single
reason to do so, and the only people you’re going to hurt are underpaid
librarians and chill people who just want to read some books. Whomever
is behind this are just assholes, no ifs and buts about it.</p>

<h2 id="goodbye-windows-7">Goodbye Windows 7</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-13, from: OS News</p>
<p>I finally seem to be recovering from a nasty flu that is now wreaking
havoc all across my tiny Arctic town – better now than when we hit -40 I
guess – so let’s talk about something that’s not going to recover
because it actually just fucking died: Windows 7. For nearly everyone,
support for Windows 7 ended on January 14th, 2020. However, if you were
a business who needed more time to migrate off of it because your CEO
didn’t listen to the begging and pleading IT department until a week
before the deadline, Microsoft did have an option for you. Businesses
could pay to get up to 3 years of extra security updates. This pushes
the EOL date for Windows 7 to January 10th, 2023. Okay but that’s still
nearly 2 years earlier than October 8th, 2024? ↫ The Cool Blog I’d like
to solve the puzzle! It’s POSReady, isn’t it? Of course it is! Windows
Embedded POSReady’s support finally ended a few days ago, and this means
that for all intents and purposes, Windows 7 is well and truly dead. In
case you happen to be a paleontologist, think of Windows Embedded
POSReady adding an extra two years of support to Windows 7 as the
mammoths who managed to survive on Wrangel until as late as only 4000
years ago. Windows 7 was one of the good ones, for sure, and all else
being equal, I’d choose it over any of the releases that cam after. It
feels like Windows 7 was the last release designed primarily for users
of the Windows platform, whereas later releases were designed more to
nickle and dime people with services, ads, and upsells that greatly
cheapened the operating system. I doubt we’ll ever see such a return to
form again, so Windows 7 might as well be the last truly beloved Windows
release. If you’re still using Windows 7 – please don’t, unless you’re
doing it for the retrocomputing thrill. I know Windows 8, 10, and 11 are
scary, and as much as it pains me to say this, you’re better off with 10
or 11 at this point, if only for security concerns.</p>
