<h2 id="the-school-fight-over-climate-change-is-growing">The School
Fight Over Climate Change Is Growing</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-17, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDUwNDIzMC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczMjg2NzY4MH0.6mH_VINTdB-6afvbZdOPtebbOQ67wpR4hDG0voNmEqs/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p style>
<u></u>Fights over school curricula have become issues du jour, and
today officials in Texas are voting on what kids in that state will read
about climate change in their school textbooks. The problem,
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/texas-board-education-textbooks-climate-change-aac40ce9cf09482cf67f62cb3cc353bf" target="_blank">according
to the <em>AP</em>,</a> is that the textbooks in their current form are
“too negative towards fossil fuels.”<br/>
</p>
<p>
Wayne Christian, a member of the Texas Railroad Commission, which
oversees oil and gas in the state (<em>you thought it was going to be
trains, didn’t you?</em>), is pushing the Texas State Board of Education
to “choose books that promote the importance of fossil fuels for energy
promotion.” Board member Aaron Kinsey, a Republican and an oil executive
himself, seems to like that idea, saying that the photos in textbooks
right now are too negative towards oil and gas.
</p>
<p>
Democrats and educational groups, meanwhile, are trying to push the
board in the other direction. The National Science Teaching Association
sent a letter to the board urging them not to “allow misguided
objections to evolution and climate change impede the adoption of
science textbooks in Texas.” Republicans have a majority on the board,
however, so the outcome of the vote is fairly easy to predict.
</p>
<p>
Texas is just the latest state to be embroiled in an argument over how
to present climate change to schoolchildren. Back in August, the state
of Florida approved the use of videos made by The Prager University
Foundation (PragerU) — a conservative group backed by
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/sep/05/texas-fracking-billionaire-brothers-prageru-daily-wire" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fracking
billionaires</a> that pushes out right-wing “educational content” and
<a href="https://slate.com/technology/2020/02/prageru-first-amendment-youtube.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tried
and failed</a> to sue YouTube for restricting its videos — in state
classrooms. Kids in that state can now be treated to a teacher playing
videos that extol the benefits of coal and plastic, for example, or
state that wind and solar power are simply not powerful enough for
modern energy needs.
</p>
<p>
This is all part of a
<a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/02/03/1077878538/legislation-restricts-what-teachers-can-discuss" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">large
conservative playbook</a> to push back against “woke” ideas like
critical race theory and climate change. In Virginia, Governor Glenn
Youngkin created a hotline for parents who detected critical race theory
in their kids’ classrooms. An Indiana bill prohibits teachers from
discussing “anti-American ideologies,” but doesn’t define what those
ideologies are. The so-called “don’t say gay” law in Florida
<a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/03/28/1089221657/dont-say-gay-florida-desantis" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bans</a>
classes about sexual orientation or gender identity through third grade.
And across the country, conservative activists are wielding book bans to
excise content they deem unacceptable.
</p>
<p>
In an FAQ on its website, PragerU makes clear that it “is not an
accredited university, nor do we claim to be.” New Hampshire and
Oklahoma have both also approved PragerU content for use in their
schools, as a result of intense lobbying by the company. Next in its
sights?

id="columbia-cornell-other-colleges-face-us-inquiries-over-alleged-antisemitism-islamophobia">Columbia,
Cornell, Other Colleges Face US Inquiries Over Alleged Antisemitism,
Islamophobia</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The U.S. federal government has opened civil rights investigations
into seven schools, universities and a school district over allegations
of antisemitism or Islamophobia since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas
war.</p>
<p>The list includes three Ivy League institutions — Columbia, Cornell
and the University of Pennsylvania — along with Wellesley College in
Massachusetts, Lafayette College in Pennsylvania and Cooper Union for
the Advancement of Science and Art in New York. It also includes one
K-12 system, the Maize Unified School District in Kansas.</p>
<p>The Education Department announced the inquiries on Thursday, calling
it part of President Joe Biden administration’s effort to take
“aggressive action” against discrimination. Schools found to have
violated civil rights law can face penalties up to a total loss of
federal money, although the vast majority of cases end in voluntary
settlements.</p>
<p>Schools have a legal duty to act “when students are targeted because
they are — or are perceived to be — Jewish, Muslim, Arab, Sikh or any
other ethnicity or shared ancestry,” Education Secretary Miguel Cardona
said in a written statement.</p>
<p>Five of the investigations are in response to allegations of
antisemitic harassment, while two are in response to allegations of
anti-Muslim harassment, the department said. The agency did not disclose
which schools faced which accusations. Details about individual
complaints were not released.</p>
<p>Penn and Wellesley were accused of antisemitism in federal complaints
filed last week by the Brandeis Center, a Jewish legal advocacy
group.</p>
<p>In a November 9 letter to the Education Department, the center says
Penn professors have made antisemitic statements in the classroom and on
social media. It said many Jewish students are afraid to be on campus
during pro-Palestinian rallies, and that the university has done little
to support them.</p>
<p>Penn officials said they’re cooperating with the investigation.</p>
<p>University President Liz Magill “has made clear antisemitism is vile
and pernicious and has no place at Penn,” the school said. “The
university will continue to vigilantly combat antisemitism and all forms
of hate.”</p>
<p>A separate letter from the Brandeis Center said Wellesley has failed
to address antisemitism. It cites an email that some dorm advisers sent
to residents saying “there should be no space, no consideration, and no
support for Zionism” at Wellesley. Advisers later apologized for the
message.</p>
<p>Wellesley, a private women’s college, said the federal investigation
is in response to the Brandeis complaint. A statement from Wellesley
denied any wrongdoing, saying it “responded quickly and decisively” to
the dorm incident.</p>
<p>Officials at Lafayette said it was unclear to them why their school
was being investigated.</p>
<p>“The College maintains a firm stance against antisemitism,
Islamophobia, and hate speech of any kind. The College is cooperating
and will continue to cooperate fully with the DOE in their
investigation,” the college said in a written statement.</p>
<p>Maize Unified, a district of about 8,000 students outside Wichita,
said it did not receive a copy of the complaint. A statement said the
district “takes allegations of discrimination seriously and is committed
to cooperating fully with any investigation.”</p>
<p>The schools are being investigated for possible discrimination based
on shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics, which violates the Civil
Rights Act of 1964. The federal law requires schools to protect students
from discrimination and respond to harassment that creates a hostile
environment. Anyone can file a complaint alleging such
discrimination.</p>
<p>All of the investigations were opened Wednesday or Thursday. An
updated list of investigations will be released each week, the
department said.</p>
<p>Emotions over the Israel-Hamas war have been running high on many
campuses around the U.S. At Columbia, for one, tensions have been
escalating amid dueling demonstrations by pro-Israel activists and by
Palestinian students and their allies.</p>
<p>At Cornell, a student was arrested last month after posting
threatening statements against Jewish people. Some Jewish students at
Cooper Union say the school failed to protect them during an October
pro-Palestine demonstration that left Jewish students sheltering in a
campus library.</p>
<p>Palestinian and Muslim students have also reported increased
harassment on campuses across the country. At Columbia, students
protested this week after the school suspended two pro-Palestinian
groups that have come under scrutiny on U.S. campuses.</p>
<p>“We at the Department of Education, like the nation, see the fear
students and school communities experience as hate proliferates in
schools,” said Catherine E. Lhamon, assistant secretary of civil rights
for the department.</p>
<p>The investigations are the Biden administration’s latest steps to
press colleges into action. Last week the Education Department sent
universities a letter reminding them of their legal obligations under
the Civil Rights Act. Cardona has recently met with leaders of Muslim,
Arab and Jewish groups to discuss discrimination on campuses.</p>
<p>Along with complaints filed with the Education Department, some
students have filed lawsuits alleging civil rights violations. Three
Jewish students at New York University sued the school this week, saying
it failed to address persistent antisemitism that has worsened since the
October 7 attack in Israel by Hamas militants.</p>

Sanctions Iran-Backed Militia Members in Iraq Conducting Strikes Against
American Forces</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The United States on Friday imposed sanctions on six people
affiliated with the Iranian-backed Iraqi militia Kataeb Hezbollah, which
is accused of being behind a spate of recent attacks against U.S. forces
in Iraq and Syria.</p>
<p>Included in the sanctions are the militia’s foreign affairs chief, a
member of its governing council, its military commander and a media
spokesperson. The sanctions block access to U.S. property and bank
accounts and prevent the targeted people and companies from doing
business with Americans.</p>
<p>A spate of drone attacks hit U.S. bases in Iraq as recently as
Friday, as regional tensions have flared up following the bloody war
between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>Two U.S. defense officials confirmed three additional attacks on U.S.
military facilities in Iraq and Syria on Friday, bringing the total
number of attacks on U.S. and coalition military facilities in Iraq and
Syria to at least 60.</p>
<p>The three bases attacked as of Friday by one-way drones were Al Harir
air base in Irbil, with no casualties reported but an infrastructure
damage assessment ongoing; Al Asad air base in Iraq with no injuries or
infrastructure damage; and Tall Baydar, Syria, with minor injuries to
one service member who was able to return to duty, one of the defense
officials said.</p>
<p>Iranian-backed militias in Iraq have threatened to attack U.S.
facilities there because of American support for Israel.</p>
<p>The Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control said
Kataeb Hezbollah is supported by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard
Corps-Quds Force. The State Department has previously designated it as a
terrorist organization.</p>
<p>Brian E. Nelson, Treasury’s undersecretary for terrorism and
financial intelligence, said the U.S. is “fully committed to security
and stability in the Middle East and are steadfast in our efforts to
disrupt these destabilizing activities.”</p>
<p>At least 11,470 Palestinians — two-thirds of them women and minors —
have been killed since the war in Gaza began, according to
Hamas-controlled health authorities, who do not differentiate between
civilian and militant deaths. About 2,700 people are reported
missing.</p>
<p>About 1,200 people have been killed in Israel, mostly during the
initial attack, and around 240 were taken captive by militants.</p>

Coral over PCIe.

<em>Yes</em>. Though currently, you need to tweak a few things to get it

<h2 id="melting-arctic-sea-ice-threatens-polar-bears">Melting Arctic Sea
Ice Threatens Polar Bears</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>In the Arctic, the impact of climate change is happening at an
accelerated pace, with temperatures rising two to four times faster than
the global average.</p>
<p>“It’s called the polar amplification,” explains Vladimir Romanovsky,
a geophysicist at the University of Alaska in Fairbanks. “Snow and ice
reflect lots of energy back to space when ice and snow are melting, and
the surface turns much darker. So this amount of energy will be absorbed
by the surface, and it will make the surface warmer – at the same time
making the atmosphere warmer as well.”</p>
<p>Communities in circumpolar regions of Alaska are dealing with a
triple challenge of climate change: coastal erosion, thawing of
permafrost on which buildings and infrastructure stand, and, for some
communities, the challenge of managing encounters with apex predators —
polar bears pushed onshore.</p>
<p>“An optimal habitat for polar bears now is basically absent, it’s
disappeared,” says Todd Atwood, a wildlife biologist with the United
States Geological Survey. He has been studying polar bears for the past
12 years and says melting sea ice makes it harder for bears to hunt
seals.</p>
<p>“That tends to be the trigger for bears to either stay with the sea
ice as it retreats further over those deeper waters, or, for a growing
proportion of the population to make the swim to shore.”</p>
<p>In addition to the high risk of succumbing to sea conditions on a
long swim, bears trying to adapt to life on land face an additional risk
as they search for new sources of food.</p>
<p>“They’re coming ashore in areas where people are active, whether it’s
near communities where people are engaged in subsistence activities, or
whether it’s in the oil and gas industrial footprint where people are
working [outdoors] on a daily basis,” Atwood says. “And that raises the
likelihood of human-bear interactions and conflict.”</p>
<p>In the Inupiat village of Kaktovik on Alaska’s North Slope, posters
warn people to be on the lookout for polar bears.</p>
<p>Six hundred kilometers from the nearest big city, Kaktovik hosted
visitors on polar bear tours before the COVID pandemic. Those
restrictions are now lifted, but it’s contractors, not tourists,
occupying the main hotel as they work to complete repairs to the local
school and maintain infrastructure before the harsh winter weather and
darkness set in.</p>
<p>Lee Kyoutak picks up visitors from the landing strip where small
planes carrying a few passengers and supplies land when the island’s
frequently foggy weather allows it. He says not to worry about hearing
shots or firecrackers. “There’s a polar bear patrol patrolling the
village,” he said. “If you go out, just make sure you look around when
you go out because there’s polar bears hanging around.”</p>
<p>Kaktovik is one of six communities in North Alaska where residents
receive special training provided by the North Slope Borough and the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to join Polar Bear Patrols that use
non-lethal deterrents to haze bears who sneak into areas where people
live or work.</p>
<p>In traditional indigenous communities such as Nuiqsut, Utqiagvik
(Barrow), and Kaktovik where there is seasonal whale hunting, polar
bears attracted to bowhead whale bones discarded outside the village
keep those patrols especially busy. Some encounters between bears and
humans can be lethal — for either side.</p>
<p>Inupiat wildlife guide Robert Thompson says he rarely walks around
the village unarmed, especially at night.</p>
<p>“I had to shoot two bears that came after me,” he said. “I don’t want
to do it, but when bears come after you, you got to defend yourself. One
was four to five feet from my doorway, and another one tried to jump
into the house though my bedroom window.”</p>
<p>Thompson came to Kaktovik more than 50 years ago. Back then, he says
“ice was visible all summer. Pack ice, meaning ice that doesn’t melt.
And so, recently, we had 700 miles of open water toward the North Pole.
So that’s affecting the polar bears. With the ice around us melting,
they are trying to swim ashore. The cubs don’t make it.”</p>
<p>Scientists have recorded polar bears swimming as far as 350
kilometers over several days. Even strong swimmers may not survive the
challenge.</p>
<p>Research led by the U.S. Geological Survey shows that in the first
decade of the 21st century, the number of polar bears in the southern
Beaufort Sea dropped 40%.</p>
<p>“One of the things that we’re pretty confident of as a polar bear
research community is that without sea ice, you’re not going to have
polar bears,” Atwood said. “They represent a kind of the canary in the
cryosphere in the sense that they are the animal that is probably most
associated with the threat of climate change to wildlife
persistence.”</p>
<p>The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists the polar
bear as a vulnerable species most threatened by the loss of sea ice.
With an estimated 26,000 bears remaining worldwide, the group says all
but a few of those bears could be lost by the end of the century without
action on climate change.</p>

<p>date: 2023-11-17, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links Red-teaming the SCOTUS code of conduct: Let’s take a
look at what it <em>actually</em> prohibits. Hey look at this: Delights
to delectate. This day in history: 2003, 2013, 2018, 2022 Colophon:
Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing
projects, current reading Red-teaming the SCOTUS code of conduct
(permalink) Last April, Propublica’s Joshua Kaplan, Justin Elliott and
Alex Mierjeski dropped a bombshell: Supreme Court Justice Clarence
Thomas had been showered in high-ticket “gifts” by billionaire ideologue
Harlan Crow, who subsequently benefited from Thomas’s rulings in the
court:
https://www.propublica.org/article/clarence-thomas-scotus-undisclosed-luxury-travel-gifts-crow
This was just the beginning: in the coming days and weeks, more and more
of Thomas’s corruption came to light, everything from the fact that his
mother’s home had been bought by Crow, to the fact that Thomas’s
adoptive son went to a fancy private school on Crow’s dime:
https://www.propublica.org/article/clarence-thomas-harlan-crow-private-school-tuition-scotus
The news was explosive and not merely because of the corruption it
revealed in the country’s highest court. The credibility of the court
itself was at its lowest ebb in living memory, thanks to the two judges
who occupied stolen seats – Kavanaugh and Coney Barrett. One of those
judges – Kavanaugh – is a credibly accused rapist. Thomas is also a
credibly accused sexual abuser:
https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/10/01/30-years-after-her-testimony-anita-hill-still-wants-something-from-joe-biden-514884
Then, this illegitimate court went on to deliver a string of upsets to
long-settled law, culminating in the Dobbs decision, which triggered
state laws that force small children to bear their rapists’ babies:
https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/09/health/abortion-bans-rape-incest.html
That was the context for the Thomas bribery scandal, which was swiftly
joined by another bribery scandal, involving Samuel Alito’s improper
acceptance of valuable gifts from Paul Singer, another billionaire who
brought business before the court:
https://www.propublica.org/article/samuel-alito-luxury-fishing-trip-paul-singer-scotus-supreme-court
This string of scandals and outrages naturally prompted public curiosity
about the Supreme Court’s ethical standards, and that triggered fresh
waves of incredulous outrage when we all found out that the Supreme
Court doesn’t have any:
https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2023/why-doesnt-the-supreme-court-have-a-formal-code-of-ethics/
When Congress made tentative noises about providing minor checks and
balances on the court, the justices erupted in outrage, telling Congress
to go fuck itself:

Chief Justice Roberts went on whatever the opposite of a charm-offensive
is called (an “offense offensive?”), a media tour whose key message to
the American people was “STFU, you’re hurting our feelings”:
https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/roberts-defends-high-court-against-attacks-on-its-legitimacy
To the shock of no one except billionaires and Supreme Court justices
inhabiting the splendid isolation from societal norms that is the
privilege of life tenure, America didn’t like this. The Supreme Court’s
credibility plummeted. A large supermajority of Americans – 79%! – now
support age limits for Supreme Court justices:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/10/18/the-people-no/#tell-ya-what-i-want-what-i-really-really-want
Support for packing the Supreme Court is at an historic high and gaining
ground, now sitting neck-and-neck with opposition at 46% in favor/51%
opposed. Among under-30s, there’s a healthy majority (58%) in favor of
appointing more SCOTUS justices. As Roberts’ wounded bleats reveal,
SCOTUS is very sensitive to its plummeting legitimacy. After all, the
court doesn’t have an army, nor does it have a police force. Supreme
Court rulings only matter to the extent that the American people accept
them as legitimate and obey them. Transformational presidents like
Lincoln and FDR have waged successful wars against the Supreme Court,
sidelining its authority and turning it into an unimportant rump
institution for years afterward:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/05/26/mint-the-coin-etc-etc/#blitz-em Now
the Supremes are working their way through the (mythological but
convenient) five stages of grief. Having passed through Denial and
Anger, they’ve arrived at Bargaining, with the publication of the
court’s first “code” “of” “conduct”:
https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/Code-of-Conduct-for-Justices_November_13_2023.pdf
It’s…not good. As Max Moran writes for The American Prospect and The
Revolving Door Project, the proposed code amounts to “security theater,”
a set of trivially bypassed strictures that would not have prevented any
of the scandals to date and will permit far worse in the years to come:
https://prospect.org/justice/2023-11-17-supreme-court-objectivity-theater/
The security framing is a very useful tool for evaluating the Supremes’
proposal. The purpose of a code of conduct isn’t merely to prevent
people from accidentally misstepping – it’s to prevent malicious parties
from corrupting the judicial process. To evaluate the code, we should
red team it: imagine what harms a corrupt judge or a corrupting
billionaire would be able to effect while staying within the bounds the
code sets. Seen in that light, the code is wildly defective and
absolutely not fit for purpose. Its most glaring defect is found in the
nature of its edicts – they are almost all optional. The word “should”
appears 53 times in the document, while “must” appears just six times:
https://ballsandstrikes.org/ethics-accountability/supreme-court-code-of-conduct-hilariously-fake/
Of those six “musts,” two are not pertinent to ethical questions (they
pertain to the requirement for a justice to get prior approval before
getting paid for teaching gigs). When the code of conduct was rolled
out, the court and its apologists pointed out that it was modeled on the
ethical guidelines that bind lower courts. In the wake of the Thomas
revelations, these guidelines were a useful benchmark to measure
Thomas’s conduct against. The fact that other federal judges would have
been severely sanctioned or even fired if they had engaged in the same
conduct as Thomas was a powerful argument that Thomas had overstepped
the bounds of ethical conduct. But as Bloomberg Law discovered when they
compared the lower courts’ codes to the Supremes’ draft, the Supremes
have gone through those lower court codes and systematically cut nearly
every mention of “enforce” from their own draft. They also cut the
requirement to “take appropriate action” if a violation is reported. If
you are a bad judge or a bad donor, all of this is good news. Nearly
everything that it condemns is merely optional, which means that if a
judge can be convinced to ignore a rule, they won’t have violated the
code. What’s more, even widespread rulebreaking doesn’t trigger an
investigation. That’s a very weak security measure indeed. But it gets
worse. The Supremes’ code also omit key definitions found in the codes
that bind the lower courts. The most important definition to be cut is
for “political organization,” which the lower courts define expansively
as both parties and “entit[ies] whose principal purpose is to advocate
for or against political candidates or parties.” That definition
captures “nonprofits, think tanks, lobbying firms, trade associations,
grassroots groups” – the whole panoply of organizations whom federal
judges must maintain an arm’s length distance from in order to preserve
their objectivity. Federal judges may not lead, speak at or donate to
these organizations. By omitting this definition, the Supremes open the
door to involvement with precisely the kinds of PACs, thinktanks and
other influence organizations funded by the billionaires who have
benefited so handsomely from the judges’ rulings. What’s more, the
Supremes carve out an explicit exemption for speaking to “nonprofits,
think tanks, lobbying firms, trade associations, grassroots groups,” and
to serving as a director, trustee or officer of “a nonprofit
organization devoted to the law, the legal system, or the administration
of justice and may assist such an organization in the management and
investment of funds.” As Moran points out, this exemption would cover –
among other institutions – the far-right Federalist Society, which
satisfies all those criteria. That means a Supreme Court justice could
sit on the board and raise funds for the FedSoc without raising any
issues with this code – not even one of those squishy “shoulds.” Nothing
in this code would stop Clarence Thomas or Thomas Alito from accepting
lavish gifts, private jet rides, or luxury tour buses from billionaires
with business before the court:
https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/justice-thomas-267000-loan-rv-forgiven-senate-democrats-104303972
As Moran writes, these definitional vacuums are a well-understood class
of weaknesses in ethics codes. Congress gets a lot of mileage out of
this ruse – for example, by narrowly defining “lobbying” to exclude
things that most people understand that term to mean, Congress engage in
improperly close relations with lobbyists while still maintaining that
they hardly ever talk to a lobbyist at all:
https://www.politico.eu/article/jeff-hauser-opinion-watergate-european-union-qatargate/
The same ruse goes for campaign contributions – if you want to accept a
lot of campaign contributions that would fall afoul of ethics rules,
just narrow the definition of “campaign contribution” until all the
money you’re receiving no longer qualifies. Moran closes by calling on
Congress to formulate a real, meaningful code of conduct for the
Supremes, one that orders Supreme Court judges not to accept corrupting
gifts and to maintain the arm’s length neutrality that the rest of the
federal judiciary is required to keep. Rather than this new code of
conduct constituting proof that SCOTUS can be its own oversight, its
gross deficiencies should put to rest any question about whether the
Supremes can be trusted to regulate themselves. (Image: Senate

<h2 id="this-icelandic-volcano-may-surprise-you">This Icelandic Volcano
May Surprise You</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-17, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p style>
If you were to walk down the street in the Icelandic town of Grindavik
right now — which, to be clear, you shouldn’t — you would find a scene
out of the apocalypse. Cracks in the road emitting ominous steam. A low
rumbling beneath your feet. Deserted homes and buildings all around and
nary a human in sight.
</p>
<p>
What you would be experiencing, as any Icelander could tell you, is the
prelude to a volcanic eruption.
</p>
<p style>
Iceland sits across two tectonic plates — the place where they meet is a
tourist attraction — and many of the country’s 32 active volcano systems
are simply waiting for the right moment to erupt. Since late October,
researchers have been tracking increased seismic activity accompanied by
a miles-long ribbon of magma flowing under the Reykjanes Peninsula just
southwest of Reykjavik, the country’s capital.
</p>
<p>
The earthquakes ticked up in both frequency and intensity last Friday,
prompting officials to
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/11/world/europe/iceland-earthquake-volcano-evacuation.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">evacuate</a>
the 4,000 residents of Grindavik, a fishing town sitting right above
that magma river. The Blue Lagoon, a famous spa that draws hundreds of
thousands of visitors a year, closed as a precaution. Officials are
working to
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/17/world/europe/iceland-volcano-eruption.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fortify</a>
a power plant that supplies power and hot water to 30,000 people. People
around the country are now anxiously waiting for what
<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/iceland-volcano-eruption-likelihood-remains-high-after-700-earthquakes-strike-since-midnight/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">experts
told CBS</a> could be a “Hawaiian-style, lava-producing volcanic
eruption.”
</p>
<p>
Volcanoes can be incredible forces of disruption and have sudden,
surprising climate impacts. When Eyjafjallajokull, one of the largest
volcanoes in Iceland, erupted in 2010, it created an ash cloud that
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/16/world/europe/16ash.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shut
down</a> air travel across Europe — which, incidentally, led to an
estimated 2.8 million metric tons of
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/apr/19/eyjafjallajokull-volcano-climate-carbon-emissions" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">avoided
carbon dioxide emissions</a>. A recent
<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adg2551" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study</a>
showed that the eruption of Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai in the South
Pacific last January sent so much aerosolized water into the
stratosphere it depleted the ozone layer. Something similar happened
when Mt. Pinatubo erupted in 1991 and initiated a period of global
cooling due to the vast amounts of sulfur dioxide it released, blocking
energy from the sun.
</p>
<p>
Whatever is about to happen in Iceland, experts say, is unlikely to be
nearly as intense as these previous eruptions; there’s still a chance
there might not be an eruption at all, leaving Icelanders in a state of
suspended dread.

<h2 id="offshore-wind-to-get-a-little-tax-boost">Offshore Wind to Get a
Little Tax Boost</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-17, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDUwMzQ2MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0NjM5NTgyNH0.Hi0XR3QJgz6_zbq-XbgqtSOOCabYrTdDtV6JP7xWfw0/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p style>
The beleaguered offshore wind industry got a small boost from the Biden
administration on Friday in the form of a proposal that would expand the
definition of what qualifies for a 30% clean energy investment tax
credit.<br/>
</p>
<p style>
Offshore wind farms have many different components beyond just the
turbines, and developers have been seeking clarity on where the dividing
line was between the equipment that would qualify for the tax credit,
and any interdependent infrastructure like transformers and transmission
lines. Under the
<a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2023-25539.pdf" target="_blank">new
rules</a>, developers would be able to include the cost of subsea cables
that bring the power to shore, as well as onshore substations — not just
the towers and blades or the platforms they sit on.
</p>
<p style>
The proposal is part of the Treasury’s ongoing role in overseeing a
range of expanded tax credits for clean energy that were in the
Inflation Reduction Act. It provides similar clarity for a new tax
credit for standalone, utility-scale energy storage projects, which can
store power from wind and solar farms and dispatch it when needed.
</p>
<p style>
“Given the new and expanded incentives created by the Inflation
Reduction Act, clarity around the underlying rules for long-standing
investment credits is critical as projects move from the announcement,
to groundbreaking, and eventual ribbon-cutting stage,” said Wally
Adeyomo, deputy secretary of the Treasury, during a call with reporters
on Thursday.
</p>
<p style>
John Podesta, senior advisor to Biden for clean energy innovation and
implementation, who was also on the call, said that developers were
hearing from their lenders that they were waiting to see the final tax
credit guidance, particularly in regard to underwater cabling. Offshore
wind projects have been
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/offshore-wind-power-cost-expensive" target="_self">plagued
by rising costs</a> due to inflation, supply chain disruptions, and
rising interest rates. Many have asked the future buyers of their power
to approve higher rates, and two projects in New Jersey were
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/everyones-mad-at-offshore-wind-developers" target="_self">recently
canceled altogether</a>.
</p>
<p>
In July, a utility in Rhode Island
<a href="https://news.pplweb.com/news-releases?item=137899" target="_blank">decided
not to move forward</a> on a contract to buy power from a proposed
offshore wind farm called Revolution II, a joint venture between Orsted
and Eversource, putting the project in limbo. In a press release, the
utility pointed to “uncertainty of federal tax credits” as one of the
factors that likely contributed to the higher-than-expected proposed
contract.
</p>
<p>
Adeyomo said the clarity provided by the tax credit rules will “allow
these offshore wind companies to price their offerings going forward
with the certainty to know what types of incentives they will receive
from the government.”
</p>
<p style>
“We appreciate the clarification from the Treasury Department that
recognizes the integral nature of all components of an offshore wind
project,” a spokesperson for Orsted told me.
</p>
<p style>
Considering the broader economic headwinds these projects face, this
expansion of the tax credit eligibility is unlikely to be enough to put
the ailing industry on solid ground. Offshore wind developers are also
still waiting for clarity on another Inflation Reduction Act program
that could prove essential — the
<a href="https://energycommunities.gov/energy-community-tax-credit-bonus/" target="_blank">energy
community bonus credit</a>. The subsidy gives projects an additional 10%
tax credit if they build in communities that have been host to fossil
fuel plants or extractive activities. It will apply to the location of
onshore substations, but developers
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/us-offshore-wind-projects-seek-looser-subsidy-rules-fight-survival-2023-09-06/" target="_blank">want
to see it also apply to port infrastructure</a>.
</p>
<p style>
Clean energy trade groups welcomed the proposal on Friday.
</p>
<p>
“Thanks to the IRA, clean energy businesses now have access to a stable
tax platform like the one enjoyed by the fossil fuel sector for more
than a century,” said Gregory Wetstone, President and CEO of the
American Council on Renewable Energy in a statement. “But to fully take
advantage of these benefits, they need to understand how the provisions
work. The tax guidance released today provides important clarity to
developers and investors looking to further America’s energy
transition.”

<pre><code>        &lt;div class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every so often, when you&#39;re debugging weird hardware issues on SBCs like the Raspberry Pi, it&#39;s useful to get way down into the guts of how the Pi represents its hardware to Linux.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
And the Linux kernel uses a method called
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/devicetree/usage-model.html">Device
Tree</a> overlays to do it. On the Pi 5 (and other Pis), these overlays
are stored as <code>.dtb</code> files inside the
<code>/boot/firmware</code> directory, and there’s an overlay for every
major Raspberry Pi hardware model.
</p>
<p>
I’ve had to modify the <code>dtb</code> files in the past to

Complaint</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-17, updated: 2023-11-17, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
A ransomware gang, annoyed at not being paid,
<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-gang-files-sec-complaint-over-victims-undisclosed-breach/">filed
an SEC complaint</a> against its victim for not disclosing its security
breach within the required four days.
</p>
<p>
This is over the top, but is just another example of the extreme
pressure ransomware gangs put on companies after seizing their data.
Gangs are now going through the data, looking for particularly important
or embarrassing pieces of data to threaten executives with exposing. I
have heard stories of executives’ families being threatened, of
consensual porn being identified (people regularly mix work and personal

Mexico’s Lopez Obrador</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden is scheduled to meet Friday with Mexican
President Andrés Manuel López Obrador on the sidelines of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, or APEC, conference in San
Francisco. </p>
<p>In a statement, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said
the two leaders will discuss “ongoing efforts to strengthen the
U.S.-Mexico bilateral relationship and address issues of shared
concern.”  </p>
<p>The statement said they would also discuss “how to work together as
partners” to manage migration at our shared border and mobilize a
hemispheric-wide response to this challenge.”</p>
<p>During last month’s U.S. Mexico High Level Security Dialogue, U.S.
and Mexican officials focused heavily on the issue of fentanyl
trafficking between the two nations and that is expected to be on the
agenda for Friday’s meeting as well. </p>
<p>The two leaders will certainly discuss trade, as this year Mexico
became the top U.S. trading partner, last year exchanging more than $860
billion in goods and services, an all-time high. </p>
<p>The Associated Press reports López Obrador said he would also use
Friday’s meeting to take up the case for Cuba and would urge Biden to
resume a dialogue with the island nation and end U.S. sanctions.</p>
<p>Biden met with President Xi Jinping on Wednesday and used Thursday to
highlight strong economic ties between the U.S. and the other Pacific
nations. The president will have one final large gathering of leaders
Friday where he will formally transfer the APEC chair to Peruvian
President Dina Boluarte.</p>

and Reuters.</p>

Signs Temporary Spending Bill; Aid for Ukraine, Israel Is Stalled</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>President Joe Biden signed a temporary spending bill late Thursday, a
day before a potential government shutdown, pushing a fight with
congressional Republicans over the federal budget into the new year, as
wartime aid for Ukraine and Israel remains stalled.</p>
<p>The measure passed the House and Senate by wide bipartisan margins
this week, ensuring the government remains open until after the holiday
season, and potentially giving lawmakers more time to sort out their
considerable differences over government spending levels for the current
budget year. Biden signed the bill Thursday in San Francisco, where he
was hosting the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit.</p>
<p>The spending package keeps government funding at current levels for
roughly two more months while a long-term package is negotiated. It
splits the deadlines for passing full-year appropriations bills into two
dates: January 19 for some federal agencies and February 2 for others,
creating two dates when there will be a risk of a partial government
shutdown.</p>
<p>The two-step approach was championed by new House Speaker Mike
Johnson, a Republican, and was not favored by many in the Senate,
although all but one Democrat and 10 Republicans supported it because it
ensured the government would not shut down for now.</p>
<p>Johnson has vowed that he will not support any further stopgap
funding measures, known as continuing resolutions. He portrayed the
temporary funding bill as setting the ground for a spending “fight” with
the Senate next year.</p>
<p>The spending bill does not include the White House’s nearly $106
billion request for wartime aid for Israel and Ukraine. Nor does it
provide humanitarian funding for Palestinians and other supplemental
requests, including money for border security. Lawmakers are likely to
turn their attention more fully to that request after the Thanksgiving
holiday in hopes of negotiating a deal.</p>

<h2 id="biden-13-leaders-sign-indo-pacific-economic-framework">Biden, 13
Leaders, Sign Indo-Pacific Economic Framework</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden Thursday hailed a new economic agreement
among 14 Asia Pacific countries aimed at countering China’s regional
economic dominance, saying the deal leaders signed at a summit of
regional economies – which is not a formal trade agreement – will
address key issues such as future semiconductor shortages by improving
supply chain resilience.</p>
<p>The goal of the new pact, said the 14 leaders in a joint statement,
is to “promote workers’ rights, increase our capacity to prevent and
respond to supply chain disruptions, strengthen our collaboration on the
transition to clean economies, and combat corruption and improve the
efficiency of tax administration.”</p>
<p>Biden, speaking Thursday at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
summit in San Francisco, acknowledged that negotiators failed to reach
consensus on a key pillar of last year’s Indo-Pacific Economic
Framework.</p>
<p>“We still have more work to do, but we’ve made substantial progress,”
he said. “In record time we’ve reached consensus on three of the pillars
of the IPEF.” The IPEF has four pillars, summarized as trade, supply
chains, clean energy and infrastructure, and tax and
anti-corruption.</p>
<p>Biden also announced a program to work with startup businesses to
raise capital. That effort is based on the U.S. Partnership for Global
Infrastructure and Investment, which is seen as the U.S. answer to
China’s Belt and Road Initiative.</p>
<p>In highlighting the plan, Biden also emphasized the importance of the
U.S. private sector.</p>
<p>“You’ve heard every one of my colleagues say one time or another that
this can’t be done without trillions of dollars of private sector
investment to get hold of this and get hold of it quickly to give them
confidence to make those investments,” Biden said. “That’s going to
create a pipeline of projects in partner countries and then match
private sector financing with these projects, and it’s going to give
those private sector investors confidence that their investment will be
made according to the highest standards. Government investment is not
enough. We need to mobilize private investment.”</p>
<p>Critics say the new economic agreement lacks market access
provisions.</p>
<p>“For a country like us, we have to have at least market access,”
Indonesian CEO Anindya Bakrie told VOA on the sidelines of the
summit.</p>
<p>Joshua Kurlantzick, a senior fellow for Southeast Asia at the Council
on Foreign Relations, said most Southeast Asian states are “tepid” about
the deal.</p>
<p>The bottom line, he said, is, “It’s not a trade deal, and the U.S. is
not offering any market access in IPEF. And the Southeast Asian states
can contrast that with actual trade deals that have been passed in Asia
over the last seven years, including major, major trade deals that
involve China, South Korea, Japan, and other big economies, as well as
ASEAN being in the middle of that.”</p>
<p>However, he said, “they’re not going to say to the United States
coming in with IPEF over the last couple of years, we reject this.
They’re cordial and they do want a greater U.S. security presence.”</p>
<p>Siobhan Das, executive director of the American Malaysian Chamber of
Commerce, took a rosier view.</p>
<p>“I actually believe it’s been successful already,” she said. “You’ve
had 14 nations talking to each other for the last 18 months – how can
that not be a success?”</p>
<p>Zack Cooper, a specialist in U.S. strategy in Asia at the American
Enterprise Institute, told VOA on Thursday, as the 14 leaders smiled and
posed for a photo, that “everyone agrees that the Indo Pacific economic
framework is probably the best the Biden administration is going to do
for now.”</p>
<p>“But it certainly doesn’t mean that they’re happy with IPEF or that
they’re going to be satisfied with the version of IPEF they’re getting
at APEC, which does not include trade,” he said. “And so it’s probably
better than nothing.”</p>

<h2 id="us-house-democratic-leaders-react-to-protest">US House
Democratic Leaders React to Protest</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. congressional Democratic leadership Thursday condemned the
escalation of protests outside the Democratic National Committee
headquarters in Washington while praising police handling of the
situation.</p>
<p>Protesters clashed with police outside the headquarters Wednesday
night, as they rallied for a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas.</p>
<p>House of Representatives Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries,
Democratic Whip Katherine Clark, Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar
and Democratic Congressional Campaign Committe Chair Suzan DelBene, all
signed on to the Thursday statement following the event.</p>
<p>“We are thankful for the service and professionalism of the U.S.
Capitol Police officers who worked to ensure that Members, staff and
visitors were able to safely exit. We strongly support the First
Amendment right to freedom of expression and encourage anyone exercising
that right to do so peacefully,” the Democratic leaders said in the
statement.</p>
<p>Democrats, including Jeffries, were in the building at the time of
protests, which were originally intended to block exits so politicians
would be forced to see a candlelight vigil in support of a
cease-fire.</p>
<p>Police say the protests quickly turned violent, which led to six
police officers needing treatment for minor injuries and one arrest.</p>

id="biden-looks-to-build-economic-ties-at-apec-says-us-not-going-anywhere">Biden
Looks to Build Economic Ties at APEC, Says US ‘Not Going Anywhere’</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>President Joe Biden on Thursday made America’s case to national
leaders and CEOs attending the Asia-Pacific summit that the United
States is committed to high standards in trade and to partnerships that
will benefit economies across the Pacific.</p>
<p>“We’re not going anywhere,” he declared.</p>
<p>Fresh off his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Biden also
told business leaders that the U.S. was “de-risking and diversifying”
but not “decoupling” from Beijing. But he did not mince words in
suggesting the U.S. and friends in the Pacific could offer businesses a
better option than China. He also noted that U.S. economies had invested
some $50 billion in fellow Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation economies
in 2023, including in clean energy technologies, aviation and
cybersecurity.</p>
<p>“This is not all kumbaya but it’s straightforward,” Biden said. “We
have real differences with Beijing when it comes to maintaining a fair
and level economic playing field and protecting your intellectual
property.”</p>
<p>Biden sought to send a clear message about American leadership as
business leaders grapple with the risks of doing businesses in the midst
of wars in the Middle East and Europe and a still shaky post-pandemic
economy. He was also spending time Thursday letting Indo-Pacific leaders
know that the U.S. is committed to nurturing economic ties throughout
the region.</p>
<p>The president also met jointly Thursday with Japanese Prime Minister
Fumio Kishida and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol on the sidelines
of the summit.</p>
<p>The meeting comes less than three months after Biden hosted Kishida
and Yoon for a historic summit at the Camp David presidential retreat.
Japan and South Korea have been historically bitter rivals, but the two
leaders have sought to look past decades of tension because of shared
concerns about growing regional threats from North Korea and an
increasingly assertive China. Japan colonized the Korean Peninsula
between 1910 and 1945.</p>
<p>Biden in his remarks to the CEOs sought to highlight his
administration’s efforts to strengthen ties with the region. APEC
members have invested $1.7 trillion in the U.S. economy, supporting some
2.3 million American jobs. U.S. companies, in turn, have invested about
$1.4 trillion in APEC economies.</p>
<p>Later, during talks with APEC leaders at a working lunch, Biden spoke
about efforts funded by his Inflation Reduction Act to fight climate
change and improve sustainability and clean energy infrastructure in the
U.S. At a dinner for the APEC delegations, he challenged his fellow
leaders to “harness the power of the Pacific” for a “future of greater
prosperity and dignity for all.”</p>
<p>The U.S. hasn’t hosted the annual leaders’ summit — started in 1993
by President Bill Clinton – since 2011. The group met virtually in 2020
and 2021 because of the coronavirus pandemic. Leaders did gather in
Bangkok last year, but Biden skipped the summit because his
granddaughter was getting married, and he sent Vice President Kamala
Harris in his place.</p>
<p>The annual conference brings together heads of nations and other top
economic and diplomatic leaders. Biden told those who gathered Wednesday
evening at a welcome party that today’s challenges were unlike those
faced by previous APEC leaders.</p>
<p>Biden also sought to underscore that he was seeking to responsibly
manage the United States’ strained relationship with China one day after
he and Xi sat down for more than four hours of talks at bucolic Filoli
Estate outside of San Francisco.</p>
<p>“A stable relationship between the world’s two largest economies is
not merely good for the two economies but for the world,” Biden said. “A
stable relationship. It’s good for everyone.”</p>
<p>Demonstrations in and around APEC continued Thursday. Hours before
leaders were to gather at the Moscone Center for the summit, protesters
calling for a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war were detained by police
after shutting down all traffic over a major commuting bridge heading
into San Francisco.</p>
<p>After decades of trade built on the premise of keeping prices low,
accessing new markets and maximizing profits, many companies are now
finding a vulnerable global economy. The Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas
conflicts aren’t helping matters.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic exposed frailties in their supply chains.
Climate change has intensified natural disasters that can close
factories. The Israel-Hamas war and Ukraine’s defense against the
Russian invasion have generated new financial risks, and new
technologies such as artificial intelligence could change how companies
operate and displace workers.</p>
<p>Xi too, met with American business leaders — at a $2,000-per-plate
dinner Wednesday evening. It was a rare opportunity for the business
leaders as they seek clarification on Beijing’s expanding security rules
that could choke foreign investment.</p>
<p>“There is plenty of room for our cooperation, and we are fully able
to help each other succeed and achieve win-win outcomes,” he told them,
according to an English-language translation.</p>
<p>Xi did not address the APEC CEOs meeting but instead sent a lengthy
“written speech” in which he wrote that “forcing uniformity will not
advance cooperation in the region” and declared that China was looking
for stability during a moment of “turbulence and change” in the
world.</p>
<p>“The region cannot and should not be an arena for geopolitical
rivalry, still less should it be plunged into a new cold war or
camp-based confrontation,” Xi wrote.</p>
<p>Separately, Xi on Wednesday signaled that China would send the U.S.
new giant pandas, just a week after three from the Smithsonian National
Zoo were returned to China, much to the dismay of Americans. There are
only four pandas left in the United States, at the Atlanta Zoo.</p>
<p>Biden and Xi understand that the complicated ties between the two
nations have major global impacts. Their meeting Wednesday at a Northern
California estate was in part an effort to show the world that while
they are global economic competitors, the U.S. and China aren’t rivals
seeking conflict.</p>
<p>Xi, though, was gloomy about the state of the post-pandemic global
economy. China’s economy remains in the doldrums, with prices falling
due to slack demand from consumers and businesses.</p>
<p>“Industrial and supply chains are still under the threat of
interruption, and protectionism is rising,” Xi said. “All these are
grave problems.”</p>
<p>White House officials said Biden has been bolstered by signs that the
U.S. economy is in a stronger position than China’s and that the U.S.
was building stronger alliances throughout the Pacific.</p>
<p>Part of that is through the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework,
announced during a May 2022 trip to Tokyo. It came six years after the
U.S. unilaterally withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade
deal that was signed by 12 countries.</p>
<p>The new framework has four major pillars: supply chains, climate,
anti-corruption and trade. There won’t be any official trade deals to
announce — the “framework” label allows Biden to bypass Congress on any
agreements reached with the 13 countries. Biden celebrated that work on
three of the four pillars had been completed.</p>
<p>“Put simply, my colleagues and I are driving a race to the top, among
nations in the Indo-Pacific,” Biden said.</p>
<p>While U.S. allies are still are looking to hammer out comprehensive
trade agreements with Washington, Biden administration officials are
underscoring that IPEF has helped the U.S. and partners take action at a
far faster clip than traditional trade deals.</p>
<p>“Most trade negotiations take years to complete,” said Mike Pyle,
Biden’s deputy national security adviser for international economics.
“The issues that are at the cutting edge of the global economic
conversation, issues like supply chains, clean energy, good government
—- we have struck agreements around them in just 18 months, with a full
set of IPEF partners.”</p>

id="why-the-gaza-war-has-sparked-a-wave-of-antisemitism-and-islamophobia-in-the-us">Why
the Gaza War Has Sparked a Wave of Antisemitism and Islamophobia in the
US</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>As the war in Gaza rages for a second month, violence of a different
kind is erupting across the United States.</p>
<p>Bias attacks against American Jews, Muslims and Arabs have risen to
levels not seen in years, fueled by a conflict that often triggers
strong feelings on both sides of the issue.</p>
<p>The Anti-Defamation League, an American Jewish advocacy group,
documented a staggering 832 antisemitic incidents of assault, vandalism
and harassment between October 7, the day Hamas attacked Israel, and
November 7. That amounts to an average of nearly 28 incidents a day and
represents an increase of 315% over the same period last year. The
incidents included more than 600 acts of harassment, 170 instances of
vandalism, and 30 assaults, ADL said.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), a
Muslim civil rights organization, reports an “unprecedented surge in
bigotry” since the war started.  Between October 7 and November 4, the
group received 1,283 requests for help and complaints of anti-Muslim or
anti-Arab bias, an increase of 216% over an average 29-day period last
year. CAIR said more than 15% of complaints fielded by its national
office involved alleged hate crimes.</p>
<p>Behind the numbers are real people. While the majority of the
reported incidents don’t rise to the level of hate crimes, at least two
recent deaths have been tied to the conflict. </p>
<p>On October 14, Joseph M. Czuba, a 71-year-old Illinois landlord,
fatally stabbed Wadea Al-Fayoume, a 6-year-old Palestinian American boy,
after seriously wounding his mother, Hanaan Shahin, in their home
outside Chicago. Czuba was arrested and charged with murder and
attempted murder. </p>
<p>Then last week, Paul Kessler, a 69-year-old Jewish protester, died
following an altercation at dueling pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli
demonstrations in a Los Angeles suburb. Loay Alnaji, 50, a
pro-Palestinian demonstrator, was arrested on Thursday in connection
with Kessler’s death. </p>
<p>The vitriol and violence fueled by the Gaza war have spread to U.S.
colleges and universities, heightening tensions between pro- and
anti-Israel student groups.</p>
<p>A Cornell University professor was caught on camera calling the Hamas
attack on Israel “exhilarating” and “energizing.” A student at the Ivy
League school was later charged with making threats against Jewish
students. At Drexel University in Philadelphia, a Jewish student’s dorm
room door was set on fire. At the University of Texas, a group of men
targeted students during a Palestine Solidarity Committee meeting. And a
Muslim student at Stanford University was allegedly run down by a driver
making a racist remark.</p>
<p>The Department of Education on Thursday announced new investigations
into six U.S. colleges over alleged incidents of Islamophobia and
antisemitism, part of the Biden administration’s aggressive effort to
counter the surge in anti-Muslim and anti-Jewish hate incidents.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden, who has faced criticism from American Muslim and
Arab groups for his unwavering support of the Israeli military campaign
in Gaza, delivered an Oval Office address last month to denounce
antisemitism and Islamophobia.</p>
<p>“We must, without equivocation, denounce antisemitism,” Biden said.
“We must also, without equivocation, denounce Islamophobia.” </p>
<p>Law enforcement officials are sounding the alarm over the Israel
conflict’s knock-on effect. </p>
<p>FBI Director Christopher Wray warned this month that the bureau is
concerned that violent extremists — both domestic and homegrown — “will
draw inspiration from the events in the Middle East to carry out attacks
against ordinary Americans.”</p>
<p>The Israeli-Palestinian conflict often inspires hate crimes, but the
ripple effect has been outsized this time, magnified by the length and
intensity of the war, the polarization of public opinion and media
coverage, the spread of false and inflammatory information, and the use
of inciteful language by people on both sides of the issue.</p>
<p>‘Hate spike’</p>
<p>Brian Levin, founder of the Center for the Study of Hate and
Extremism and professor emeritus at California State University, San
Bernardino, said the U.S. is experiencing a “generational hate spike
that is likely to have a longer and more violent half-life than prior
event-driven increases.”</p>
<p>“The bigoted backlash from the Israel-Hamas war is causing online
invective and disinformation to skyrocket, while anti-Jewish and
anti-Muslim hate crime incidents are spiking to possible decade highs,”
Levin said. “And in the case of anti-Jewish hate crimes, a possible
record in the U.S.” </p>
<p>Nationwide data are hard to come by, but New York and Los Angeles
police are reporting triple-digit increases in anti-Jewish and
anti-Muslim hate crimes in the nation’s two largest cities.</p>
<p>In New York, police recorded 69 anti-Jewish hate crimes in October,
up from 22 last October, and eight anti-Muslim criminal acts, up from
zero last year. Meanwhile, Los Angeles police reported 22 anti-Jewish
hate crimes between October 6 and October 30, up from eight during the
same period last year.  Anti-Palestinian, anti-Arab and anti-Muslim
crimes jumped to eight from one last year.</p>
<p>Maya Berry, executive director of the Arab American Institute in
Washington, said it’s no surprise that the conflict has spawned attacks
on Arabs and Muslims.</p>
<p>“Historically, we’ve talked about something called the ‘backlash
effect,’” Berry said. “Events happening anywhere in the world end up
having an impact domestically. We saw it during the [1973-1974] Arab
embargo. We saw it in the aftermath of 9/11. And we’re seeing it play
out now.”</p>
<p>Levin is one of a handful of experts who have examined the link
between the Israel conflict and hate crimes in the U.S.</p>
<p>His analysis of FBI statistics dating to the early 1990s shows that
anti-Jewish and anti-Muslim hate crimes tend to escalate during
Israeli-Palestinian tensions.</p>
<p>In March 1994, for example, hate crimes targeting Jews more than
doubled to 147 incidents after extremist Israeli American Baruch
Goldstein fatally shot 29 Palestinian worshippers at the Ibrahimi Mosque
in Hebron.</p>
<p>The sharpest rise in anti-Jewish hate crimes occurred in October
2000, with the onset of the Second Intifada — 204 incidents, marking an
increase of 183% over October 1999.</p>
<p>Recent years have seen significant increases during Israel-Hamas
conflicts in 2006, 2014, 2018 and 2021, according to Levin’s
analysis.</p>
<p>“Our data across three decades clearly show huge percentage spikes in
anti-Jewish hate crime in the U.S. when there is war in the Holy Land,”
Levin said.</p>
<p>Other studies corroborate Levin’s finding. A recent study by
political scientist Ayal Feinberg found that during weeks of Israeli
military operations between 2001 and 2014, the number of antisemitic
incidents rose by 24% across the U.S., while acts of antisemitic
violence and intimidation increased by 33%.</p>
<p>Over the years, the pattern has held up, Feinberg, director of the
Center for Holocaust Studies and Human Rights at Gratz College in
Pennsylvania, said in an interview.</p>
<p>“I think it’s critical to note that even in the United States, which
many consider to be the most philosemitic country in the world, that
over the last two decades there’s been no factor that explains increases
in antisemitism greater than when Israel is engaged in violent conflict
with its neighbors,” Feinberg said.</p>
<p>The link between the Israel conflict and anti-Muslim hate crime is
less clear-cut. The FBI data show double- and triple-digit monthly
increases in anti-Muslim hate crimes during Israeli military operations
in 2004 and 2014. But other times of tension have seen no significant
increase in anti-Muslim hate crime.</p>
<p>Instead, terrorist attacks carried out by jihadi groups have served
as a primary driver of anti-Muslim hate crimes in the U.S.</p>
<p>The terror attacks of September 11, 2001, triggered the biggest
monthly spike in anti-Muslim hate crime — a record 330 incidents, more
than 80 times higher than previously. Though the number of incidents
eventually tapered off, it never returned to pre-9/11 levels.</p>
<p>The second-largest increase came in December 2015 after
then-candidate Donald Trump called for a “total and comprehensive” ban
on Muslims entering the U.S. The result was dramatic: nearly 70 attacks
on Muslims for the month, up 886% from the year before.</p>
<p>The flood of bias complaints CAIR received in the weeks after October
7 was the most since Trump’s “Muslim ban” speech, the group said. </p>
<p>The question of what motivates people to attack Muslims and Jews
against the backdrop of the Israeli conflict has no simple answer. But
experts agree that hate crime perpetrators often hold Muslims and Jews
responsible for the actions of Hamas and Israeli military forces.  </p>
<p>“There is a lot of blame going on,” said Michael Jensen, a senior
researcher at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and
Responses to Terrorism at the University of Maryland. “This conflict is
more complex than these simple characterizations of all Palestinians are
terrorists, or all Jews are invaders systematically conducting
genocide.”</p>
<p>Increasingly ubiquitous posters of Israelis taken hostage by Hamas
have become a flashpoint in this scapegoating.</p>
<p>In the days after the Hamas attack on Israel, the “kidnapped” flyers,
depicting images of abducted Israelis, were pasted on trees outside a
mosque in San Diego, putting the congregation on edge.</p>
<p>“Why would you presume anyone at the Islamic Center of San Diego has
anything to do with what took place there?” Berry said. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, anti-Israel protesters have been criticized for tearing
them down. Two dentists recently lost their jobs over their removal.</p>
<p>‘Good and evil’</p>
<p>Feinberg said age-old antisemitic stereotypes about “Jewish power”
help explain why Jews are blamed for the actions of Israel.</p>
<p>Jews are perceived to “have this greater responsibility to speak out,
to prove that they are not like these other Jews or part of this
powerful entity of Jews,” Feinberg said.</p>
<p>In addition to anti-Palestinian rhetoric, Muslim and Arab American
advocates say the mainstream media’s portrayal of the conflict as a
“struggle between good and evil” has fanned the recent flame of hate
directed at American Muslims and Arabs. </p>
<p>“This dehumanizing framing impacts Muslims in America, as individuals
who hold anti-Muslim prejudice frame them as terrorists,” said Mobashra
Tazamal, associate director of the Bridge Initiative, a research project
on Islamophobia at Georgetown University in Washington.</p>
<p>Noting the importance of public discourse, Berry of the Arab American
Institute recalled how former President George W. Bush’s visit to a
Washington mosque following the attacks of September 11, 2001, helped
reassure many Arab and Muslim Americans worried about being scapegoated
for the actions of al-Qaida. </p>
<p>“Regrettably, what we’re seeing right now is different,” Berry
said. </p>
<p>While the Biden administration was slow to acknowledge Palestinian
suffering during the conflict, it eventually “pivoted, and that’s
important,” Berry said. </p>
<p>“And I think when that happened, it does contribute to public safety
in a very real way, meaning people start to think, ‘OK, wait. There are
victims here that need to be recognized,’” Berry said.</p>

<h2 id="key-issues-where-biden-and-xi-diverge">Key Issues Where Biden
and Xi Diverge</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping made clear
before they met outside of San Francisco on the sidelines of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit that they would not
issue a joint statement.</p>
<p>But a comparison of their positions in written statements
issued separately after the leaders met on Wednesday highlights
continuing differences in four contentious areas.</p>
<p>Taiwan</p>
<p>China claims the self-governing island of Taiwan as its territory.
The U.S. maintains a “robust” relationship with Taiwan and sells defense
equipment to its military.</p>
<p>The Chinese statement specifically mentioned Biden’s promise of last
November when he met Xi on the sidelines of the G20 meeting in Bali,
Indonesia, not to support Taiwan’s independence.</p>
<p>This position is not included in the White House statement.</p>
<p>The Chinese statement said that Xi reiterated the principle of the
Taiwan issue during the meeting and pointed out that “the Taiwan
question has always been the most important and sensitive issue in
China-U.S. relations. China attaches great importance to the relevant
positive statements made by the U.S. during the Bali meeting.”</p>
<p>Xi asked Biden to not support Taiwan independence, “stop arming
Taiwan, and support China’s peaceful reunification.”</p>
<p>Xi said that “China will eventually be reunified.”</p>
<p>Biden did not directly respond to Xi’s request to stop arming Taiwan
in his statement. Instead, he reiterated his opposition to any party
independently changing the status quo across the Taiwan Strait.</p>
<p>Biden emphasized that the U.S. one-China policy has not changed and
has been consistent across decades and administrations.</p>
<p>Biden said in the statement, “The United States opposes any
unilateral changes to the status quo from either side, that we expect
cross-strait differences to be resolved by peaceful means, and that the
world has an interest in peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.”</p>
<p>The U.S. one-China policy recognizes the Chinese government as the
only Chinese government but does not endorse Beijing’s view of Taiwan as
a breakaway province.</p>
<p>Biden also called on China to restrain its military activities around
the Taiwan Strait.</p>
<p>Ukraine and Israel</p>
<p>After Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, and Hamas attacked
Israel on Oct. 7, the U.S. repeatedly called on China to mediate.
Ukraine and Israel have publicly sought China’s support.</p>
<p>The U.S. statement said that the two leaders exchanged views on the
two conflicts. Biden reiterated that the U.S., with global allies and
partners, will continue to support Ukraine in resisting Russian
aggression. On the Israel-Hamas conflict, Biden reiterated U.S. support
for Israel’s right to fight terrorism and emphasized the importance of
all countries using their influence to prevent escalation and expansion
of the conflict.</p>
<p>The Chinese statement did not mention Ukraine or Israel. Last year in
Bali, Xi stated that China was highly concerned about the situation in
Ukraine.</p>
<p>Trade and the economy</p>
<p>Xi expressed dissatisfaction with U.S. containment of China’s chip
development, while Biden was concerned about China’s “unfair trade
policies, non-market economic practices and punitive actions against
U.S. firms.”  He said that the U.S. would not set excessive restrictions
on trade and investment.</p>
<p>According to the Chinese statement, Xi said that the U.S. continues
to impose restrictions on China regarding export controls, investment
reviews and unilateral sanctions. He said that China drives development
through innovation and that suppressing China’s science and technology
would curb China’s high-quality development and deprive the Chinese
people of their right to growth.</p>
<p>He called on the U.S. to face up to China’s concerns, lift unilateral
sanctions, and provide a non-discriminatory environment for Chinese
companies.</p>
<p>The Chinese statement also quoted Biden as saying, “The U.S. and
China are economically interdependent. The U.S. is happy to see China
develop and prosper. It does not seek to suppress and contain China’s
development, nor does it seek to decouple from China.”</p>
<p>Biden emphasized that the United States will continue to take
necessary actions to prevent advanced U.S. technologies from being used
to undermine U.S. national security, without unduly limiting trade and
investment.</p>
<p>Human rights</p>
<p>Many dissidents living in the U.S., including those from Hong Kong,
Tibet and the Uyghur community, gathered in San Francisco during Xi’s
first visit to the U.S. in seven years to protest the Chinese
government’s suppression of human rights.</p>
<p>According to the U.S. statement, Biden underscored the universality
of human rights and the responsibility of all nations to respect their
international human rights commitments. He raised concerns regarding PRC
human rights abuses, including in Xinjiang, Tibet and Hong Kong.</p>
<p>He said that resolving the cases of some U.S. citizens who are
wrongfully detained or subject to exit bans in China remains a priority
for him.</p>
<p>China’s statement did not mention these human rights issues.</p>

<h2 id="inflation-is-killing-long-term-climate-bets">Inflation Is

<p>date: 2023-11-17, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p class="drop-caps" style>
Every company is, in a certain light, a kind of time machine, and every
new product is a missive from the past. When a group of people get
together to launch a startup, they’re making a bet that in a few months
or years, people are going to want what they’re selling.
</p>
<p>
In the software industry, the past isn’t too long ago. Because it is
possible to code and distribute an app somewhat quickly, a new software
product might have only been conceived earlier that year or a year or
two earlier.
</p>
<p style>
In a mature consumer-product field — like, say, the car industry — the
timeline is longer. A model year 2024 car might have first been
conceived of in 2022, and it probably relies on a deeper engineering
structure — a “platform” — that might date back to 2018 or earlier.
Every new car contains, in essence, two-year-old technology.
</p>
<p style>
But in the “hard tech” industry, the delay can be even longer. It can
take more than a decade to get a new type of airplane or power plant to
market. These types of technology are the biggest bet of all — because
by the time the missive reaches its destination, the world may have
changed.
</p>
<p>
So it was with NuScale, an Oregon-based company developing a small,
modular nuclear reactor. Last week, NuScale announced that it was
pulling out of a Department of Energy-backed, first-of-a-kind project in
Utah.
</p>
<p>
The company had once planned to build six small, modular nuclear
reactors in Utah in conjunction with the Idaho National Laboratory. But
despite receiving more than $1 billion in Department of Energy
subsidies, NuScale could not make the economics of its project work.
</p>
<p>
The main problem was that NuScale’s electricity
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/where-nuclear-reactors-built-small-cost" target="_self">was
too expensive</a>. Over the past two years, the estimated price of its
project surged, rising by more than 75%. Because electricity projects
have to recoup their costs from selling power, those high construction
costs helped increase the estimated cost of the project’s electricity
<a href="https://ieefa.org/resources/eye-popping-new-cost-estimates-released-nuscale-small-modular-reactor#:~:text=The%2053%25%20increase%20in%20the,%245.3%20billion%20to%20%249.3%20billion." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">by
53%</a>.
</p>
<p>
By the end, NuScale estimated that power from the project would cost $89
per megawatt-hour. (The average cost of residential electricity in Utah
is
<a href="https://www.bls.gov/regions/midwest/data/averageenergyprices_selectedareas_table.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">about
$20 per megawatt hour</a>.) Of course, nuclear energy can provide
benefits beyond what is captured by price — it is one of the few energy
sources that can provide 24/7, zero-carbon electricity — but some costs
are too high. NuScale struggled to sell its electrons to nearby towns:
It simply could not compete with cheaper electricity from natural gas,
solar, or other fuels.
</p>
<p>
It wasn’t supposed to be like this: NuScale’s smaller size and modular
design were supposed to result in <em>lower </em>costs. In essence,
NuScale hoped that cost savings would emerge from learning-by-doing and
economies of scale — as it got better at making small, modular reactors,
it would figure out how to bring down their costs.
</p>
<p>
That wasn’t a ludicrous idea. Economies of scale have brought down the
cost of solar, wind, batteries, and electric vehicles over the past
decade. And that idea — that as people do something more, they figure
out how to do it more cheaply and efficiently — underpins American and
Chinese climate policy.
</p>
<p>
But the Utah project was the first project of its kind, so NuScale
hadn’t yet had the opportunity to take advantage of those economies of
scale.
</p>
<p>
NuScale “shows how much customer matters for a first-of-a-kind
deployment. NuScale went down a road that would have proven to be a
really interesting model if successful, but it was a lot of legwork,”
Ryan Norman, a nuclear analyst at the think tank Third Way, told me.
Other advanced nuclear startups have more reliable customer
relationships, he added.
</p>
<p>
Even worse for NuScale, the company found itself building the project
amid the worst inflation in a generation. What might have once seemed
like a “boring” part of a reactor’s design could create new and
spiraling costs.
</p>
<p>
For instance, NuScale’s design required a lot of concrete, Farah
Benahmed, a nuclear policy analyst at
<a href="https://breakthroughenergy.org/our-team/farah-benahmed/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Breakthrough
Energy</a>, a set of climate investment and advocacy organizations
founded by Bill Gates, told me. But concrete costs have risen
dramatically, increasing
<a href="https://carbicrete.com/blog-cement-inflation/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">by
more than 9%</a> over the past two years and helping to drive the
company’s spiraling costs. Other advanced reactor designs don’t rely on
concrete to the same degree as NuScale, Benahmed said. (Gates has
invested in Terrapower, an advanced nuclear company that competes with
NuScale.)
</p>
<p>
Other key inputs into NuScale’s reactors have also surged in price. From
2021 to 2023, the cost of carbon steel piping more than doubled,
according to producer price index data. The cost of fabricated steel
plates rose by more than 50%, and the cost of copper wiring rose by 30%.
</p>
<p style>
More broadly, NuScale was founded in 2007 — which means, almost
inevitably, that the company was responding to a very different energy
moment than the one we have now. At the time, the world was undergoing
the first wave of widespread public concern about climate change, driven
by Hurricane Katrina, <em>An Inconvenient Truth, </em>and the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s
<a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar4/syr/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fourth
assessment report</a>. It seemed plausible that Congress might pass
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/09/us/politics-economy-environment-mccain-lieberman-offer-bill-require-cuts-gases.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a
bipartisan cap-and-trade law</a>, which would benefit zero-carbon
nuclear power.
</p>
<p style>
Most importantly, U.S. electricity costs
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/13/business/13power.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">were
rising</a>, and experts feared they would continue to increase in the
2010s. America’s natural gas supplies seemed to be running out, and the
country
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/06/magazine/us-export-liquid-natural-gas.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">was
preparing to import liquified natural gas</a> in large quantities.
</p>
<p style>
Then came the fracking boom. Cheap natural gas flooded the market,
reshaping the domestic energy system and
<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/201714/growth-in-us-residential-electricity-prices-since-2000/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">moderating
the rise in power prices</a>. The United States never passed a carbon
price or a cap-and-trade law. And the economics of building lots of
NuScale reactors to provide zero-carbon, 24/7 electricity now look
seriously different.
</p>
<p>
NuScale is not the only clean energy company to run into
inflation-driven problems. The offshore-wind company Orsted
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/everyones-mad-at-offshore-wind-developers" target="_self">recently
canceled</a> two projects on the Jersey shore due to cost and
supply-chain problems. Other offshore projects are also at risk.
</p>
<p>
Nuclear advocates said that despite its issues, NuScale has accomplished
something that no other nuclear startup has. It is the sole nuclear
startup to receive approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the
federal agency that must approve nuclear reactors before they can be
used. “NuScale has paved the way for how to move through the NRC
process. They’re a great example and paved the way for the industry,”
Benahmed, the Breakthrough analyst, said.
</p>
<p>
That approval process took
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/nrc-certifies-first-us-small-modular-reactor-design" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more
than four years</a>. It shows another way that it can take years or even
decades for “hard tech” companies to get to market — to send their
missive from the past to the present.
</p>
<p style>
But despite that long timeline, advocates remain upbeat about the larger
industry. “The investor base will do its due diligence to assess what
business decisions went wrong with NuScale, but ultimately I think this
development is less detrimental to the wave of support we’ve seen for
advanced nuclear from that group,” Norman, the Third Way analyst, said.
Because NuScale uses a small version of a light-water reactor — a
conventional reactor technology that other advanced-nuclear startups
have eschewed — investors probably won’t lose faith in the sector
itself.
</p>
<p style>
But they agreed that the make-or-break moment for nuclear is coming up.
“The key decision point we need to wrestle with as we continue along the
innovation path is: Who is going to lead?” Norma said. “Our allies are
waiting. Our competitors are watching. Like it or not, now is the time
for the U.S. and industry to prove itself. We’ve gotta have moxy.”
</p>

<p>With these changes in place, we’ve seen support for Manifest V3
increase significantly among the extension developer community.
Specifically, we are encouraged by our ongoing dialogue with the
developers of content blocking extensions, who initially felt Manifest
V3 could impact their ability to provide users with the features they’ve
come to expect. Google has made several changes to Manifest V3
specifically to ease concerns among developers of content blocking
extensions, and it seems those changes have been positively received.
The maximum number of active rulesets has been increased, as well as the
number of dynamic rules, which are rules ad blocker developers can
change and update without having to update the extension as a whole.
Regardless of these changes, I would still advise everyone to get a
Raspberry Pi or whatever and run Pi-Hole – this will block ads for your
entire network, and all devices, regardless of browser or operating
system.</p>

<p>The rumors are true: Microsoft has built its own custom AI chip that
can be used to train large language models and potentially avoid a
costly reliance on Nvidia. Microsoft has also built its own Arm-based
CPU for cloud workloads. Both custom silicon chips are designed to power
its Azure data centers and ready the company and its enterprise
customers for a future full of AI. Microsoft’s Azure Maia AI chip and
Arm-powered Azure Cobalt CPU are arriving in 2024, on the back of a
surge in demand this year for Nvidia’s H100 GPUs that are widely used to
train and operate generative image tools and large language models.
There’s such high demand for these GPUs that some have even fetched more
than $40,000 on eBay. Amazon and Google, the two other major cloud
providers, are already using all kinds of custom, in-house silicon in
their datacentres, so it’s not exactly surprising Microsoft is following
in their footsteps.</p>

<h2 id="us-and-china-renew-dialogue-on-climate-ahead-of-cop28">US and
China Renew Dialogue on Climate Ahead of COP28</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Barely two weeks before a major United Nations conference on climate
change, the United States and China have announced new agreements to
work together on greenhouse gas emission reductions and the rollout of
renewable sources of energy. </p>
<p>The deal, announced Tuesday ahead of a meeting between U.S. President
Joe Biden and China’s President Xi Jinping in California, commits both
countries to further efforts to displace fossil fuels as the world’s
leading source of energy. It also marks the resumption of a bilateral
working group on climate issues that was sidelined last year. </p>
<p>A summary of the agreement released Tuesday by the State Department
said the two countries intend “to sufficiently accelerate renewable
energy deployment in their respective economies through 2030 from 2020
levels so as to accelerate the substitution for coal, oil and gas
generation.”  </p>
<p>The result, the agreement continued, will be “meaningful absolute
power sector emission reduction, in this critical decade of the
2020s.” </p>
<p>The agreement was released as world leaders are preparing to meet in
the United Arab Emirates at the end of November for a United
Nations-sponsored climate conference known as COP28. The annual
gathering assesses progress being made toward a global effort to keep
the increase in global average surface temperatures to no more than 1.5
degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. </p>
<p>Greenhouse gas focus </p>
<p>In an important breakthrough, the agreement indicates that China is
prepared to commit to reductions in its emissions of all greenhouse
gases, which trap heat in Earth’s atmosphere, accelerating the rise in
average global temperatures. </p>
<p>In the past, Beijing’s greenhouse gas reduction pledges have applied
only to carbon dioxide, leaving out several much more potent sources of
global warming, including methane and nitrous oxide. The agreement does
not set specific goals but commits both countries to negotiations meant
to establish them. </p>
<p>The two countries also invited other world leaders to attend a
Methane and Non-CO2 Greenhouse Gases Summit as part of COP28. </p>
<p>China has previously declined to join the Global Methane Pledge,
under which nearly 150 countries and multilateral organizations have
agreed to try to work to rapidly reduce emissions of the gas. </p>
<p>Talks restarted </p>
<p>The agreement on climate issues is a bright spot in a relationship
that has been fractious in recent years. Previous talks between the U.S.
and China were derailed in 2022 after then-Speaker of the House of
Representatives Nancy Pelosi angered China by visiting Taiwan. </p>
<p>The agreement was steered to completion by the two countries’ climate
envoys, former U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, and Xie Zhenhua, a
former senior official in the Chinese government who came out of
retirement to participate in the talks. </p>
<p>The agreement commits the U.S. and China to “recommence bilateral
dialogues on energy policies and strategies, carry out exchanges on
mutually agreed topics” and to take other steps to “enhance pragmatic
cooperation.” </p>
<p>That cooperation includes a promise to develop five large-scale
cooperative carbon capture, utilization and storage projects each by
2030. </p>
<p>Critical conversations </p>
<p>Climate activists say they were relieved to see the U.S. and China
come back to the negotiating table, particularly in advance of
COP28. </p>
<p>“The most important thing here is that the two largest emitters are
back to talking about the details around climate diplomacy,” said Rachel
Cleetus, policy director of the Union of Concerned Scientists’ Climate
and Energy Program. “It’s critical. The world as a whole cannot meet its
climate goals if the U.S. and China don’t find a shared collective
ambition.” </p>
<p>Cleetus applauded the agreement’s promises of progress on renewable
energy production and emission cuts. However, she told VOA, she would
have liked to see more progress on reducing the consumption of fossil
fuels. </p>
<p>“Accelerating the pace of renewables is all well and good — it’s very
important for both the U.S. and China to do that,” she said. “But both
countries have a real fossil fuel problem. They’re continuing to expand
fossil fuels, even as they accelerate renewables. And as a net result,
we’re not going to see the kind of progress we need.” </p>
<p>National Climate Assessment </p>
<p>The announcement of the agreement between the U.S. and China came
just a day after the federal government released the fifth National
Climate Assessment, a congressionally mandated assessment of the
“impacts, risks and responses” to climate change in the U.S. </p>
<p>The report painted a grim picture, saying, “The effects of
human-caused climate change are already far-reaching and worsening
across every region of the United States.” </p>
<p>Among other things, the assessment demonstrated that average annual
temperatures have been on the rise across all 50 states, and that all
coastal states have experienced significant sea level rises. </p>
<p>While the country has begun taking steps, including consistently
reducing greenhouse gas emissions since their peak in 2007, the report
found that much more needs to be done, and that the global nature of the
problem means that the U.S. cannot solve the problem on its own.  </p>
<p>“[W]ithout deeper cuts in global net greenhouse gas emissions and
accelerated adaptation efforts,” it said, “severe climate risks to the
United States will continue to grow.”</p>

Lifts Sanctions on Chinese Institute to Seek Fentanyl Cooperation</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The United States on Thursday removed the Chinese Ministry of Public
Security’s Institute of Forensic Science (IFS) from a trade sanctions
list, in a bid to move forward with counternarcotics cooperation with
China. </p>
<p>The decision comes as U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration is
negotiating with China to resume bilateral cooperation and establish a
working group aimed at stopping the flow of synthetic drugs and
precursor chemicals into the U.S. that contribute to the fentanyl
crisis.  </p>
<p>“The continued listing of the IFS on the Commerce Entity List was a
barrier to achieving cooperation on stopping the trafficking of
precursor chemicals,” U.S. State Department spokesperson Matt Miller
said during a briefing on Thursday. </p>
<p>“When we evaluated the issue and looked at all the merits of
de-listing the IFS, ultimately we decided that given the steps China was
willing to take to cut down on precursor trafficking, it was an
appropriate step” to remove the Chinese institute from Washington’s
sanction list, Miller told reporters.  </p>
<p>“We have to make tough decisions in this administration” to secure
the cooperation with China on fentanyl trafficking, Miller told VOA.
  </p>
<p>Added to list in 2020</p>
<p>In 2020, the U.S. Commerce Department added China’s Institute of
Forensic Science on its entity list for “engaging in activities contrary
to the foreign policy interests of the United States” and over alleged
abuses against Uyghurs and other minority groups.   </p>
<p>That measure effectively prohibited the institute from receiving most
goods from U.S. suppliers. </p>
<p>Human rights advocates expressed concern that Washington’s decision
to remove the Chinese institute from the trade sanction list raises
questions about the U.S.’ commitment to addressing China’s human rights
practices. </p>
<p>“I acknowledge the pressing issue of the fentanyl trade, which poses
a threat to Americans and is a matter of grave concern. However, it’s
crucial to emphasize that the ongoing genocide against the Uyghurs is a
matter of bipartisan concern, as well,” Rayhan Asat, a U.S.-based Uyghur
human rights lawyer, told VOA on Thursday. </p>
<p>Leading cause of death</p>
<p>Fentanyl is the leading cause of death of Americans between the ages
of 18 to 49.  </p>
<p>Currently, China remains the primary source of fentanyl and
fentanyl-related substances trafficked through international mail and
express consignment operations, serving as the main source for all
fentanyl-related substances entering the United States, according to the
U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.   </p>
<p>During Biden’s talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Woodside,
California, Wednesday on the margins of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation meetings, both agreed to resume bilateral cooperation in
combating global illicit drug manufacturing and trafficking. This
includes synthetic drugs such as fentanyl, with plans to establish a
working group for ongoing communication and law enforcement coordination
on counternarcotics issues.</p>

<h2 id="xi-in-us-amid-tension-and-signs-of-waning-approval-at-home">Xi
in US Amid Tension and Signs of Waning Approval at Home</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>China’s leader Xi Jinping was all smiles as he landed in San
Francisco, California, where he has since held talks with U.S. President
Joe Biden and is attending the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation
Leaders’ Summit.  </p>
<p>Back home, though, China finds itself a nation shaken by a series of
high-profile events spread out over a tumultuous year, the most recent
being the sudden death of former premier Li Keqiang less than three
weeks ago. </p>
<p>Under Xi’s leadership, and particularly over the past year, China has
struggled with a range of challenges: from a slowing economy, soaring
youth unemployment, and public frustration with his policies to the
high-profile ousting of key government officials he appointed. Analysts
say those challenges and the public reaction have triggered growing
distrust and waning approval for Xi. </p>
<p>Sudden death </p>
<p>Late last month, news of the sudden death of former Premier Li
Keqiang was the latest event to seize the public’s attention and
concern.  </p>
<p>“Li Keqiang’s death shook people more than previous incidents that
involved the disappearance of Foreign Minister Qin Gang and Defense
Minister Li Shangfu,” said Xia Ming, a political science professor at
City University of New York. </p>
<p>“Li is viewed by ordinary Chinese as someone who was one of them,
sympathetic to them, his sudden death and rushed cremation invoked a
strong sense of injustice,” he said.  </p>
<p>Despite efforts by authorities to keep reaction to Li’s passing under
control, there has been an outpouring of response from the public both
online and offline. Thousands lined up to place flowers outside the
hospital where he died in Shanghai and in his hometown in central Anhui
Province.</p>
<p>Some put signs up with some of Li Keqiang’s best-known remarks on the
back of their cars. Authorities moved quickly to stamp out any
discussion about Li Keqiang, including speculation that Xi had a hand in
Li’s death. Some who spoke out in public, shouting “we all know how Li
Keqiang died,” were immediately arrested.</p>
<p>As news of Li’s death spread online, so did messages “too bad it’s
not you,” seen by many as a public condemnation of Xi.  </p>
<p>Under Xi, Party members are expected to swear “absolute loyalty,” and
anyone who’s not “absolutely loyal” is deemed absolutely disloyal, Xia
said. </p>
<p>Xia added that a highly irregular incident in which former party
leader Hu Jintao was abruptly escorted off stage during party meetings
in March was also something that rang alarm bells in China. </p>
<p>Within months of the incident with Hu, China’s foreign minister and
defense minister disappeared from public view and were both later
stripped of their titles, without any explanation. Sudden changes
involving other top military commanders also signaled instability at top
levels of government. </p>
<p>Since coming to power in 2012, Xi has launched a massive
anti-corruption campaign that analysts say has been used to target not
only misuse of government funds but Xi’s political rivals as well. </p>
<p>The scale of intra-party strife and potential challenges to Xi can be
seen in the staggering number of officials being “investigated and dealt
with” in the so-called anti-corruption campaign since Xi took office,
analysts say. </p>
<p>And while the government has listed the total number of those
investigated at more than 4 million by 2021, “each one of these people
have family members and friends, so the true number of those impacted is
staggering,” Xia pointed out. </p>
<p>Rhetoric and reality </p>
<p>Orville Schell is vice president of the Asia Society and heads the
society’s U.S.-China Relations Center. He notices a slight change of
tone from Beijing. </p>
<p>“Lately there are some signs that suggest [Xi]’s a little bit worried
about overreach and being a little too aggressive,” Schell told VOA in
an interview Tuesday. “He’s realizing this with the economy in trouble,
it’s important to pull back a little and try to act a little less
hostile towards global market players that have bought goods from China
and supported China’s economic prosperity.” </p>
<p>“We have to realize it’s largely rhetoric,” he added, that is, a
reaction to the realization, as he put it, that “China is in a rather
delicate position economically.” </p>
<p>The longtime China watcher who first went to China in the 1970s when
Mao Zedong was still alive, warns that rhetoric aside, the intrinsic
character and characteristics of an autocratic regime that China
currently is, remain unchanged and dangerous. </p>
<p>While China is still shaken by the sudden death of Li Keqiang and the
world appeared taken aback by what had befallen Hu Jintao, Qin Gang, Li
Shangfu, and others, Schell reminds that “this is nothing new.”   </p>
<p>“We saw this under Stalin, we’ve seen it under every autocrat. This
is the way it works. This is the system. Autocrats cannot tolerate
competition,” he said.</p>
<p>“I think when you disappear cabinet secretaries, it shows that you’re
insecure, and you feel that the only way to survive is greater control,”
Schell told VOA. “I am surprised by the nakedness of [Xi]’s autocracy,
that he can just make people vanish.”  </p>
<p>Economic long COVID </p>
<p>The economic downturn China is going through also dampens Xi’s
popularity. And the condition China finds itself in has everything to do
with its politics, analysts say. </p>
<p>“China’s brutal domestic handling of the pandemic saw the country
endure unpredictable lockdowns and arbitrary enforcement of different
rules and standards,” noted one essay published in October by the
European Council on Foreign Relations research group. </p>
<p>“This seems to have led many Chinese households to anticipate more
hard times ahead rather than spend the savings they set aside during the
pandemic, in contrast to their counterparts in the West,” the author,
Alicja Bachulska, wrote. The result, she added, “is ‘economic long
covid,’ on a scale unlike anything seen elsewhere.” </p>
<p>In addition, “With China’s ‘responsible power’ claims long gone, many
foreign investors are unwilling to look twice,” Bachulska wrote. </p>
<p>Many analysts have said that one key reason Xi is turning on the
charm in San Francisco is because he is trying to lure foreign investors
back to China. </p>
<p>During Commerce Secretary Gina Raimando’s visit to Beijing in August,
she said U.S. companies have complained to her that China is
“uninvestable because it’s become too risky.” </p>
<p>In September, foreign exchange outflows from China rose to $75
billion, according to data from Goldman Sachs. The biggest outflow since
2016.   </p>
<p>To make matters worse, a November 15 report put out by Sinolytics, a
German thinktank focused on China, says for the first time since 1998,
China saw a negative growth of foreign direct investment; that is, for
the first time in 25 years, foreign investors pulled more money out of
China than the amount they poured in. </p>
<p>Brain drain, emigration </p>
<p>And it is not just the economy that is souring. Since Xi came to
power, the annual number of its citizens emigrating has risen
dramatically. The United Nations predicts that China will lose 310,000
people through emigration this year, after losing more than 311,000 in
2022. That is more than double  the 120,000 who left in 2012. </p>
<p>Since 2012, more than 730,000 Chinese citizens have sought asylum
overseas, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees.</p>
<p>According to The Associated Press, Panamanian authorities say that in
the first nine months of the year, 15,567 Chinese citizens crossed the
Darien Gap as they tried to try reach the United States.</p>

<hr />
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Let's start from the basics: can you introduce
yourself?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I’m Chris Coyier. Professionally, I’m the co-founder of CodePen, along
with Alex Vazquez. We’re over 10 years on that project and are hard at
work still today, evolving it. With my friend Dave Rupert, I co-host a
podcast called ShopTalk Show which is all about web design &amp;
development. I also used to run a blog called CSS-Tricks for 15 years,
which I sold a little over a year ago. So my professional life has been
very focused on the web. Outside of work, I hang out with my family in
Bend, Oregon. My main hobby is playing old-time music with local
friends.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>What's the story behind your blog?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I think I originally bought
<a href="http://chriscoyier.net/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">ChrisCoyier.net</a>
just out of the general obviousness that people should have a personal
website (I think most people should). A lot of my early website-building
experience involved WordPress, so I chucked that up on it. WordPress is
pretty capable for a variety of types of websites, but I do still think
the design of it encourages use as a blog. Blogging kinda clicked with
me anyway, so that was always a part of it. There is something
intoxicating about writing and publishing something anyone in the world
can see and read.
</p>
<p>
I have no idea how many times it’s been redesigned over the years! It’s
my 8th design since I’ve been properly versioning my WordPress theme,
but surely a few before that. And honestly: not enough. Redesigning your
personal website is one of life’s great pleasures.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>What does your creative process look like when it comes to
blogging?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
Ideally, I’m asking myself: what is interesting about this? Is there a
hook to this that makes this worthwhile? What can I say about this that
might make it click for someone? Can I share how it clicked for me? Can
I be helpful in some other way?
</p>
<p>
But sometimes I just don’t care. I remember one time a very popular
blogger posting to say that it was his wife’s birthday, and noting that
it was a good reminder that blogs are never that serious and you should
be able to post whatever you want whenever you want to. That’s what
makes a good blog, I think. That is to say, usually, I try to make
things interesting for everyone, but it’s good enough if it’s
interesting just to me.
</p>
<p>
My writing process has always been rather hot’n’fast. I might make a few
passes during writing to rejigger things, but usually, I get done with
things same-day and just hit the publish button. Back in the CSS-Tricks
days, I had a great editor in Geoff Graham, so I probably seemed a
little more polished than usual, but even then, it’s not like either of
us were super professional editors and spent weeks on things. I think
that might take the fun out of writing for me.
</p>
<p>
Tools-wise, I think the most important thing for me is
<a href="https://chriscoyier.net/2023/08/20/how-do-i-save-links-for-later/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">saving
links</a> and then being able to look over them and think about them and
see if any thoughts have formulated about them since saving/reading
them.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe
the physical space influences your creativity?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
Nah, not really. What I do think is helpful is scenery changes. I’ve got
a great desk and I can do the majority of my work there, but sometimes I
like to take a laptop over to a coffee shop just to switch it up a bit
and usually combine that with changing gears with what I’m working on.
</p>
<p>
But I’ve blogged just fine in my parent’s unfinished basement, in a tiny
room with a tilted floor and unreliable internet in a house of
questionably employed late twenty somethings, from a pool bar at a
resort in Costa Rica, in lonely second story flat with a creaky floor,
from the sunroom of a house in Florida that was a little too big for
just one dude and a puppy, from a coffeeshop I’d never find again in
Kraków, from a ferry on the inside passages of Southeast Alaska, and
from a glass-walled office with my hand-picked inspirational art
surrounding me. You just need a laptop, an idea, and a little desire to
press publish.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your
tech stack?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
GoDaddy gets a lot of flack for an ex-CEO and a story involving killing
an elephant and a purportedly objectifying advertising campaign. I think
those things are more complicated than they seem on the surface, and
never convinced me the company as a whole was evil. I find GoDaddy to be
a pretty good domain registrant product, actually. I think the UI is
fairly sensible, the pricing acceptable, and, well, it just works well.
I used MediaTemple hosting for a long time, and I even thought they did
pretty well running that post-acquisition for quite a while. Most
importantly to me, though, as a loyal guy, GoDaddy once went to bat for
me when, through a complex social engineering attack, I had a website
stolen from me. It was no small effort for them to get it back, they
did, and protected the heck out of it for all the years after. Anyway:
my domains are there.
</p>
<p>
As I mentioned, I like WordPress, and I’m using Flywheel hosting for
that at the moment. I find the hosting and the support pretty good. But
my favorite feature is that they make this product
<a href="https://localwp.com/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Local</a>
for great local development.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would
you do anything differently?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I think the most important thing anyone can do when setting up a
blogging tech stack is to make sure it’s very easy to write and publish.
For a lot of techy folks, that’s Markdown and committing a file, and
that’s great. I’m a big fan of the static-site-generator approach to
site building, as there is just tons of advantages there to being low
cost, secure, easy to move around, lots of control, etc.
</p>
<p>
But me, I’m still a big fan of WordPress. I just have so much muscle
memory for how it works. Now that the Block Editor is a thing in
WordPress, I’m an even bigger fan. It allows you to do just enough
customization inside of a blog post that makes it feel right. Too much
customization would make redesigns obnoxious. Too little feels stifling
and would lead to too much one-off fighting against it. The Block Editor
allows you to, for example, set up some side-by-side columns, or drop in
a photo gallery, or adjust some one-off colors just for one part.
</p>
<p>
Everybody’s gotta do what works for them, though. Building your own
stack of tech and learning it deeply is part of the journey. You’ll
never love every single aspect of it, so be ready to evolve.<br /> I
would say: be liberal in how you syndicate. Your blog on the web can be
home base, but meet any reader where they are. Push that content to
anywhere that will take it.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Financial question since the web is obsessed with money: how
much does it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost or does it
generate some revenue? And what's your position on people monetising
personal blogs?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I don’t monetize my personal blog at the moment aside from putting a big
obvious “Go PRO on CodePen” link in various spots. I don’t, like, pay
myself directly for that placement or even track its effectiveness, but
it’s an ad, and as a co-owner of CodePen, I profit from that.
</p>
<p>
I don’t mind what people choose to monetize, go nuts. I’ve always
thought it can be done tastefully and be the best monetization option
for tons of sites. The fact that it craps up a ton of websites is
unfortunate, so, don’t do that. I do think people, generally, will have
a hard time making meaningful money from a personal website. The scale
is generally just a little too small to make it work, and the fact that
it’s just some-persons-name.com might just be a bit too niche and weird
for a many direct advertisers to bother. I’m sure there are
counter-examples, like people that do self-help stuff and monetize with
memberships or downloads or something. CSS-Tricks did OK with
advertising revenue, but it was a real grind getting enough content
produced on a daily basis to keep traffic up to the point of supporting
just an editor and a few writers.
</p>
<p>
If you need a zero-dollar option, WordPress.com has a free plan that’s
easy to grow out of (I swear WordPress doesn’t pay me, uhm, anymore).
But also picking a static site generator and using Netlify’s free plan
is totally an option. If you have any budget at all, buy a domain and
keep it up over the years. I’m very sure you’ll never regret that.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth
checking out? And also, who do you think I should be interviewing
next?</strong>

Issues Sanctions to Limit Russian Influence in Balkans</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The United States on Thursday targeted 10 individuals in a new round
of sanctions aimed at containing Russian influence in the Western
Balkans, the U.S. Treasury said.</p>
<p>The Treasury also imposed sanctions on 20 entities, including 11
based in Russia, in line with executive orders related to the Western
Balkans and Russia, according to a Treasury website.</p>
<p>The Western Balkans-related sanctions are the latest imposed by the
United States on politicians, other individuals and organizations
designed to contain Russian efforts to prevent the region’s integration
into international institutions, the Treasury said.</p>
<p>The sanctions freeze all property and other assets those targeted
have in the United States or are controlled by U.S. citizens and
generally prohibit Americans from doing business with them.</p>
<p>Those hit with sanctions are individuals from Serbia, Bosnia and
Herzegovina, Montenegro and North Macedonia.</p>
<p>They include Savo Cvijetinovic, a senior official of the political
party led by Milorad Dodik, the pro-Russia leader of Republika Srpska,
or R.S., the Serb-dominated half of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Dodik
already is under U.S. sanctions for alleged corruption and promoting the
secession of the Serb Republic.</p>
<p>Cvijetinovic is the R.S. representative of a firm owned by a former
Russian Air Force deputy chief that “facilitated the illegal transfer”
of Ukrainian-made helicopter engines to Russia, the statement said.</p>
<p>Cvijetinovic told Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA that he suspected the
U.S. sanctions were politically motivated, and that the company he
represented has legal business with Ukraine and Russia. He said it had
supplied spare engine parts, rather than engines.</p>
<p>Also targeted was Petar Djokic, Dodik’s minister of industry, energy
and mining, who signed an agreement with a Croatian counterpart to build
a pipeline from Croatia to a Russia-owned refinery in the Serb
Republic.</p>
<p>Djokic’s Socialist Party said in a statement that the sanctions were
“the biggest strike” against the accords that ended the 1992-95 Bosnia
war “and the future cooperation and dialogue” in the country.</p>
<p>Dodik’s Moscow representative, Dusko Perovic, was sanctioned for
lobbying for meetings between Dodik and Russian President Vladimir
Putin, serving as a go-between for the Serb Republic government and an
unidentified Russian billionaire and working for two of the
billionaire’s firms, Treasury said.</p>
<p>Perovic told SRNA he was not involved in any business in Russia and
said that his main duty was to lobby for the R.S. and Dodik, and “if
this is a sin for Americans … I have no objections.”</p>
<p>In 2022, Dodik said the United States was accusing him of corruption
despite the absence of any criminal proceeding against him.</p>

JFK Assassination Perch Serves as Museum and Memorial</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The shots that rang out over Dealey Plaza in Dallas, Texas, 60 years
ago — on Nov. 22, 1963 — lasted just under six seconds. And while the
assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy profoundly changed
America, those six seconds tainted the city where it occurred, marking
the start of a long struggle to come to terms with Dallas’ role in one
of the most infamous moments in American history. </p>
<p>“That really cast a shadow on it,” retired Dallas Deputy Sheriff Gene
Boone explained to VOA while walking through Dealey Plaza in 2013.
Boone, who died in 2017, was one of the first law enforcement officers
to react to the shooting.  </p>
<p>He later entered the Texas School Book Depository and found the rifle
investigators say Lee Harvey Oswald used in the assassination. Boone
believed Dallas lost more than just a president that day. “We were
almost afraid to go outside the community and let anybody know we were
from Dallas.” </p>
<p>Dallas’ identity </p>
<p>“The event was a source of great shame,” said Jeffrey Engel, director
of the Center for Presidential History at Southern Methodist University
in Dallas. Engel said community leaders long struggled to balance the
reality of the Kennedy assassination with the way it negatively impacted
the city.  </p>
<p>“The Kennedy assassination confirmed the identity of Dallas in
American minds,” he said. In 1963, he said, Dallas was home to
right-wing groups such as the John Birch Society and was already known
as the city where former U.S. presidential candidate and United Nations
Ambassador Adlai Stevenson was attacked after giving a speech — just one
month ahead of Kennedy and Vice President Lyndon Johnson’s visit.</p>
<p>“Dallas was a place that was known at the time as a hateful, dark
city on the scene of national politics,” said Engel. </p>
<p>“So, when Kennedy was killed here in Dallas, there was this kind of
collective ‘Oh, Dallas, that’s where things like this happen.’ Dallas
was a toxic environment where extremism could thrive,” acknowledged
historian Stephen Fagin. “It was an unfair characterization, but it
lingered as a dark cloud over this community for decades.”   </p>
<p>Perspective on the tragedy </p>
<p>Fagin is the curator of the Sixth Floor Museum, which now occupies
the sixth floor of the reddish orange brick building known as the Texas
School Book Depository.</p>
<p>“We are a historical institution that explores the life, death, and
legacy of President Kennedy and the broader history and culture of the
1960s,” said Fagin.</p>
<p>The museum, situated at the edge of Dealey Plaza, opened in 1989 and
quickly became a top tourist destination, said SMU’s Engel.  </p>
<p>“Dealey Plaza is the second-most visited tourist attraction in the
state of Texas, right after the Alamo,” said Engel.</p>
<p>The museum records attendance of more than 300,000 guests annually
from 133 countries, a number that has declined since the 2020
coronavirus pandemic but is gradually increasing. </p>
<p>The museum’s curator acknowledged that the scene of a president’s
death seems an unlikely destination for tourism, something Dallas city
leaders struggled with as they attempted to convert the Texas School
Book Depository into something else.</p>
<p>“There are sites in this country that are stained by violence and
tragedy,” said Fagin. “Dealey Plaza is one of those, much like Pearl
Harbor or the footprint of the World Trade Center, and sites like this
allow us to do justice to a tragic event by remembering it
properly.”</p>
<p>But, said Fagin, remembering it properly does not mean the Sixth
Floor Museum draws definitive conclusions about exactly what happened in
Dallas in November of 1963.    </p>
<p>“The assassination, like so many other things, it’s a very divisive
topic,” he said. “People typically arrive here knowing whether they
believe Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone or whether there was a
conspiracy.”  </p>
<p>Engel said the lingering mystique about the Kennedy assassination
contributes to present-day tourism in Dallas.</p>
<p>“The Kennedy conspiracy theorists still hold a grip on the nation’s
psyche in some ways,” he said. “That you can go to Dealey Plaza and tell
yourself that ‘I’ve heard the story, maybe I can piece it together a
little bit myself now differently because I’ve seen it with my own
eyes.’” </p>
<p>“You may be intrigued by the nuances of the assassination, the
lingering questions surrounding bullet trajectories and medical
evidence,” said Fagin. “But at the end of the day, something died here
and Dealey Plaza sort of stands for that unfulfilled hope and promise
that John F. Kennedy represented.” </p>
<p>Exorcising demons </p>
<p>The Sixth Floor Museum is not just a series of exhibits, it is also
an archive. Some of the film footage of the assassination is preserved
and licensed by the museum, as are recordings of oral histories of
eyewitnesses and key figures in the events. Collectively, they fill the
museum with more than just physical artifacts that help put a watershed
moment of the 20th century into perspective historically, and
locally. </p>
<p>“Certainly, I think Dallas has tried to come to terms with this dark
moment in its past, and internalize the assassination in many ways,”
Fagin told VOA during an interview on the Sixth Floor, “and this museum
has played a key role in helping this community exorcise the last
remaining demons from 1963.” </p>
<p>Dallas Sheriff Gene Boone lived long enough to see the city where he
was born and raised emerge from the dark cloud of the assassination he
personally witnessed. He credited the Sixth Floor Museum for aiding that
transformation. “If you come here and see it and hear the story, you can
really, fully come to realize that it could happen anywhere, at any
time,” Boone told VOA in 2013. </p>
<p>Now, Boone’s story and memories of those fateful days in Dallas 60
years ago lives on among the oral histories recorded for posterity in
the permanent collections of the Sixth Floor Museum.</p>

Los Angeles officials on Thursday announced a plan to make the clean
energy transition cheaper for low-income residents, <em>The New York
Times</em>
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/16/business/energy-environment/los-angeles-energy-inequality.html" target="_blank">reports</a>.
“Working families in our city need to be assured that our city’s clean
energy future won’t leave them trapped in the past,” Mayor Karen Bass
said. “Many working families — some working two to three jobs to make
ends meet — won’t buy or lease EVs if they don’t have access to
convenient, timesaving, cost-saving places to charge them.”<br/>
</p>
<p style>
The move comes in response to a
<a href="https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy24osti/85947.pdf" target="_blank">study</a>,
also released Thursday by a coalition of city, state, and national
groups, showing that most of the money for Los Angeles’ green incentives
has so far flowed to its wealthier residents. From 1999 to 2022, for
instance, just 38% of the $340 million invested in residential solar
panels went to disadvantaged communities. And of the $5 million in
electric vehicle rebates given from 2013 to 2021, just 23% went to
underserved communities. The new plan will offer qualified buyers $4,000
toward the purchase of used EVs, up from $2,500, and install fast
chargers in areas that have so far received little attention from
private industry. The arrival of
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/are-ev-sales-really-slowing-data" target="_blank">cheaper
EVs next year</a> should also help.
</p>
<p style>
Los Angeles isn’t alone in tackling the issue of an equitable energy
transition. Michigan recently
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/michigan-climate-laws-gretchen-whitmer-democrats-senate-bill-0271-0273-0502-0519" target="_blank">proposed</a>
a suite of ambitious climate laws, one of which would establish a Just
Transition Office to help workers hurt by decarbonization. New York
State’s Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, passed in 2019,
<a href="https://www.nyserda.ny.gov/All-Programs/Energy-and-Climate-Equity-Strategy" target="_blank">requires</a>
that 35% to 40% of “benefits from investments in clean energy and energy
efficiency programs” go to disadvantaged communities. Even earlier,
Minneapolis
<a href="https://lims.minneapolismn.gov/boards/ngz" target="_blank">designated</a>
an area in its economically troubled north as The Northside Green Zone,
which involves “a plan of action to improve environmental and population
health, and social, economic and environmental justice.”
</p>
<p>
Such efforts will be crucial in the coming years, as financially
strapped homeowners grapple with the high up-front costs of the
clean-energy conversion, experts told the <em>Times</em>. “In order to
reach a 100% clean energy transition you really need to bring everyone
along,” said Kate Anderson, of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory,
one of the authors of the study. “It’s going to depend on everyone
making changes in their households. The affordability piece is a huge
challenge.”

and Biden’s Climate Deal Prevent a Second Cold War?</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-16, from: Heatmap News</p>

The past couple years have seen escalating tensions between China and
the United States. On the one hand, the brutally repressive nature of
the Chinese government has become undeniable, with the crushing of
protests in Hong Kong and the ongoing
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-22278037" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cultural
genocide</a> against the Uyghur people in Xinjiang. On the other, the
Biden administration
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/10/17/commerce-china-chip-sanctions/" target="_blank">has
tightened</a> Trump-era technology controls intended to prevent China
from developing
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/graphite-batteries-trade-war-us-china" target="_blank">cutting-edge
expertise in semiconductors</a>, as well as other trade restrictions.
Chinese and Taiwanese fighter jets are routinely
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-61642217" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">getting
into squabbles</a> over Taiwan’s airspace.
</p>
<p style>
It sure looks like another cold war is developing. However, we saw an
unexpected diplomatic bright spot during U.S.-China talks this week,
when both countries agreed to take steps to triple the world’s renewable
energy capacity by 2030, and to cut emissions from power production over
the same period. As
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/14/climate/us-china-climate-agreement.html" target="_blank">Lisa
Friedman writes</a> at <em>The New York Times</em>, “That appears to be
the first time China has agreed to specific emissions targets in any
part of its economy.” That is good, and might even help defuse a full
blown second cold war.
</p>
<p style>
Now, the agreement did not say anything about cutting coal use, which
has previously been a core U.S request. However, this isn’t as
meaningful as it might seem. China does use an
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/chinas-wildly-complex-energy-transition-explained-in-8-charts" target="_blank">ungodly
quantity of coal</a> — the main reason why it now emits more than
<a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/global-energy-review-2021/co2-emissions" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">60
percent</a> more carbon pollution than the U.S. and the EU put together
— and that is no doubt why cutting coal is not mentioned.

But Chinese coal will be phased out regardless of any diplomatic
agreement, likely sooner rather than later, for two reasons. First,
power from natural gas and renewables is now
<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/cheap-renewables-growth" target="_blank">considerably
cheaper</a> than that of coal, and increasingly so in the latter case as
technology continues to improve. Brute market forces are the primary
reason why American coal use
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/electricity/electricity-in-the-us-generation-capacity-and-sales.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">peaked
in 2007</a> and has since fallen by 60 percent. Coal power is simply a
poor business proposition in 2023 — continuing to use it is leaving
money on the table.
</p>
<p style>
Second, the filth spewed forth by burning coal imposes a terrific health
burden on the Chinese population. Seemingly every few months a new study
is published showing air pollution is
<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/air-pollution-is-really-dangerous-even-more-new-evidence-shows/" target="_blank">even
worse than we thought</a>. The air quality in Beijing was an
international disgrace for decades; it has since been greatly improved,
in part by
<a href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/beijing-announces-new-milestone-air-quality-global-standards-still-lacking" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">halting
the use of coal</a> for residential heating and cooking. But according
to the World Health Organization, air pollution still kills some
<a href="https://www.who.int/china/health-topics/air-pollution" target="_blank">two
million Chinese annually</a>, along with untold cases of asthma, heart
disease, high blood pressure, and so on.
</p>
<p style>
All that sickness is extremely expensive — costing America about
<a href="https://news.trust.org/item/20210520160439-4psy9/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$2,500
per person annually</a>, according to one study. That’s easily enough
that ending the use of fossil fuels would
<a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2020/8/12/21361498/climate-change-air-pollution-us-india-china-deaths" target="_blank">pay
for itself over the long term</a> even if you ignore climate change
altogether.
</p>
<p style>
In short, the ever-declining price of renewables, and the advancing
awareness of just how costly air pollution is, have made the task of
climate diplomacy far easier. No great sacrifice is required; countries
must simply agree to do what is already in their best interest.
</p>
<p style>
Still, the push of diplomatic agreements have their place. Actually
building out a fully zero-carbon economy pencils out on paper, but will
require a lot of complicated, expensive, and annoying electricity
transmission and storage upgrades to deal with the intermittency of
renewable power. Formal commitments can help break through the inertia.
</p>
<p style>
So what is actually happening on the ground? In America, we did finally
pass a serious climate bill,
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/07/climate/senate-climate-law.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">four
decades</a> after the undeniable proof of climate change was brought to
the attention of Congress, in the form of the Inflation Reduction Act.
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-09-11/us-solar-s-extraordinary-boom-brings-growing-pains-amid-inflation-grid-delays" target="_blank">Solar</a>
and
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/us-department-energy-projects-strong-growth-us-wind-power-sector" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wind</a>
investment are indeed skyrocketing, along with the
<a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/08/us-inflation-reduction-act-energy-news-stories-august-2023/" target="_blank">domestic
manufacturing industry</a> intended to buttress that investment
politically. It isn’t enough yet, but it’s a good start.
</p>
<p style>
On the Chinese side, it must be admitted that China’s renewable
investment <em>wildly</em> outstrips what America is doing, even with
the IRA. China has put up
<a href="https://maritime-executive.com/article/china-now-has-nearly-half-of-the-world-s-offshore-wind-capacity" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">25.6
gigawatts</a> of offshore wind, as compared to America’s pitiful
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/wind/articles/offshore-wind-market-report-2023-edition" target="_blank">30
megawatts</a>, or about one-thousandth as much. This year alone China
will put up
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/numbers-behind-chinas-renewable-energy-boom-2023-11-15/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more
solar</a> than the entirety of America’s extant installed solar
capacity. Nobody on earth does
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/chinas-solar-boom-is-big-fast-and-unstable" target="_blank">big
and fast</a> better than China.
</p>
<p style>
That said, China’s planning of renewables appears to be quite haphazard,
particularly on solar. As David Fickling
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-01-31/china-s-solar-power-boom-don-t-let-shein-be-the-model#xj4y7vzkg" target="_blank">writes
at <em>Bloomberg</em></a>, the amount of solar power actually produced
relative to capacity is not far from the U.K. and France — temperate
countries with a lot of cloud cover. This is because thus far the bulk
of China’s solar has been placed in the temperate south and east, rather
than in the dry north and west. So while the volume is about right, the
execution isn’t there yet.
</p>
<p style>
Incidentally, this might be a worthy topic for future climate talks —
America can share best practices about getting the largest number of
megawatts for your solar dollar, while China can share tips about how to
build big projects without
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/i95-philadelphia-subway-power-lines" target="_self">taking
15 years and going over budget by 500 percent</a>.
</p>
<p style>
So I return to the incipient U.S.-China cold war. To anyone with any
sense, it is plainly obvious that neither party can actually defeat the
other without also devastating itself. Both countries have nuclear
weapons and enormous militaries, backed by equally enormous economies.
Yet those economies are also profoundly intertwined — particularly when
it comes to climate, as China is by far the largest producer of solar
panels. Trying to stand up a domestic renewable industry as the Biden
administration is doing is one thing, but total cessation of trade would
wreck both China and America, and greatly hinder the global climate
transition to boot.
</p>
<p style>
Some kind of 1970s-style detente is obviously called for — a rough
agreement where both countries can continue to develop internally and
flex some diplomatic muscle abroad, but without blowing up the status
quo or getting in a shooting war.
</p>
<p style>
In the social media age, where blasting out the most inflammatory and
unhinged message is greatly rewarded, propaganda has arguably never been
more powerful or insidious. Vladimir Putin, for instance, was
<a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russia-fsu/2022-05-06/putins-orange-obsession" target="_blank">reportedly
convinced</a> of a conspiracy theory
(<a href="https://issuu.com/botondbtos/docs/william_engdahl__the_secret_financi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">originally
invented</a> by a segment of the Lyndon LaRouche cult) that the “color
revolutions” of the mid-2000s, the Arab Spring, and the Euromaidan in
Ukraine, were all secretly cooked up by George Soros and the CIA, which
is one reason why he was so hostile to Ukraine joining the EU.
</p>
<p style>
Heading off this kind of misunderstanding with China, which is an order
of magnitude more formidable than Russia at least, is critical. And one
good way to do that is just to keep diplomatic contact going. Top level
officials meeting face to face, where relationships can develop and
understanding grow, tends to defuse the grotesque distortions of
propaganda lies. It’s no guarantee, of course, but it
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0suadZ6AmM&ab_channel=CypressMazeStar" target="_blank">has
worked in the past</a>. The longer serious conflict can be put off, the
greater the chance of settling into a live-and-let-live pattern, and the
better chance the world has to carry out the energy transition.

Turns to Go-To Tool as Israel Faces Mounting Criticism</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>With Israel under increasing pressure due to a steadily rising death
toll in Gaza and images of Palestinian suffering flooding social media,
the United States turned to a familiar page in its foreign policy
playbook: it declassified and released some intelligence.</p>
<p>Both the White House and Pentagon on Tuesday announced the U.S. had
information backing Israeli claims that Hamas — long designated by
Washington as a terrorist organization — was using Gaza’s Shifa Hospital
to direct operations against Israel.</p>
<p>“We have information that confirms that Hamas is using that
particular hospital for a command-and-control node,” National Security
Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters traveling with President Joe
Biden on Air Force One.</p>
<p>“They have weapons stored there and are prepared to respond to an
Israeli military operation against the facility,” Pentagon Deputy Press
Secretary Sabrina Singh told Pentagon reporters, adding the Shifa
Hospital was just one of several used by Hamas and its ally, Palestinian
Islamic Jihad, “to conceal and support their military operations and
hold hostages.”</p>
<p>The tactic of releasing such information — known in the White House
as a strategic downgrade — has increasingly become a go-to tool for the
Biden administration when it needs to shape global public opinion.</p>
<p>It’s most famous and first applications came during the run-up to
Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, when the White House quickly
declassified and shared evidence of Russia’s military build-up with
allies and with the public, galvanizing support for Kyiv.</p>
<p>The White House also turned to strategic downgrades to push back
against China’s claims about its errant spy balloon which traversed much
of the continental U.S. earlier this year and, more quietly, to defuse a
potential crisis Mali sparked by mercenaries with Russia’s Wagner
Group.</p>
<p>And now, Israel.</p>
<p>“We felt it was important for the world to know exactly how Hamas has
chosen to embed themselves in the civilian population and use civilians,
including those at hospitals, as human shields,” a senior U.S. official
told VOA, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the
decision-making process.</p>
<p>The selection of Shifa Hospital, in particular “as a location to base
military operations from,” the official said, was “in violation of the
laws of war.”</p>
<p>The announcements from the White House and the Pentagon were met with
almost immediate skepticism on social media platforms, with accounts
accusing the U.S. of lying to cover for Israel or of basing its
assessments entirely on Israel’s own claims.</p>
<p>Hamas, too, rejected the accusations from Washington.</p>
<p>“We strongly condemn and reject the claims,” Hamas said in a
statement on its Telegram channel late Tuesday. “These statements give a
green light to the Israeli occupation to commit further brutal
massacres.”</p>
<p>Hours later, Israeli forces launched what Israel described as “a
precise and targeted operation” aimed at Hamas fighters in Shifa.</p>
<p>The U.S. official told VOA the timing of the Israeli action,
following the statements from the White House and Pentagon, was
coincidental.</p>
<p>“The downgrade had nothing to do with any operational timing or any
decision making by the Israeli Defense Forces [sic],” the official said.
“We do not want to see airstrikes or firefights at hospitals, and we
believe that patients and civilians must be protected.”</p>
<p>Other U.S. officials, likewise, pushed back against accusations that
Washington’s intelligence assessment was based on Israeli intelligence,
saying it was based on information collected by multiple U.S.
agencies.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal Wednesday reported that the U.S. assessment
Hamas was using Shifa as a base for operations came partly from
intercepted communications of fighters inside the hospital compound.</p>
<p>Former intelligence officials and analysts who spoke to VOA said they
expected the U.S. assessment was likely based on both intercepted
communications, known as signals intelligence or SIGINT, and human
sources.</p>
<p>“The obvious way that you would know something like that would be
because you knew that a credible Hamas source had confirmed it, and that
could be because you had human intelligence to that effect, or it could
be that you had some kind of intercept to that effect,” a former Western
counterterrorism official told VOA, requesting anonymity due to the
sensitive nature of the intelligence gathering.</p>
<p>And the U.S. has been in position to intercept Hamas communications.
The Pentagon, earlier this month, confirmed it started flying unarmed
drones over Gaza on October 7 to help with hostage recovery efforts in
the aftermath of the Hamas terror attacks.</p>
<p>Larry Pfeiffer, a former CIA chief of staff and former senior
director of the White House Situation Room, told VOA the U.S. also has
the ability to use satellite reconnaissance and cyber capabilities to
help pinpoint how Hamas is directing its operations.</p>
<p>“The NSC [National Security Council] and the Pentagon spoke with some
certitude,” he said. “[That] suggests to me some pretty rock-solid
evidence derived from U.S. collection or independently verifiable
Israeli collection.”</p>
<p>Israel, late Wednesday, began releasing images and other evidence
from its operation in Shifa that it said proves Israeli and U.S.
assessments that Hamas had been using the hospital as a command center —
showing so-called Hamas “grab and go” bags, with assault rifles,
ammunition, grenades and uniforms, as well as other weaponry and
equipment.</p>
<p>Like the U.S. announcement, the Israeli claims were met with
skepticism by some social media accounts, some accusing Israel of
planting the evidence.</p>
<p>But some of the former intelligence officials who spoke with VOA said
the Israeli evidence should not be dismissed.</p>
<p>“The IDF video showing weapons recovered at Shifa is certainly
significant, as this does demonstrate Hamas utilization of the hospital,
which is technically a war crime,” said Marc Polymeropoulos, a former
senior CIA operations officer who worked extensively in the Middle
East.</p>
<p>“That said, given the U.S. and Israeli claims that the hospital
contained a major command and control node for Hamas, it’s probably
going to take additional evidence, such as video of the actual tunnels
under the hospital, to buttress the intelligence claims and assuage some
of the international concerns,” he added.</p>
<p>Still, Polymeropoulos and other former officials believe the U.S.
decision to declassify the intelligence on Hamas’ use of hospitals will
pay off, even if it takes time.</p>
<p>“This is clearly designed to give the Israelis some breathing room,”
Polymeropoulos said.</p>
<p>“The audience is both global, because of the international outrage,
but also domestic,” he said, noting the Biden administration has faced
increasing criticism in the U.S. for its unwavering support of the
Israeli campaign.</p>
<p>The former Western counterterrorism official also said the U.S.
decision to back up the Israeli claims with independent U.S.
intelligence may also serve to buy Israel more time with Arab and Muslim
governments, whose patience may be wearing thin.</p>
<p>“This is perhaps just about the moment in the conflict where people
are starting to wobble,” the official said. “Declassifying that
information clearly helps to tell the story of why the Israelis are
having to respond in the way that they have.”</p>

But their broadcast tower is located about 10 miles northeast, in
Pontoon Beach, IL. My Dad was the director of engineering overseeing the
tower and studios for about 20 years, and though he’s no longer there,
he and I got permission from Audacy and the St. Louis engineers

their AM signal—which reaches all the way into Canada and Mexico at
night!

<h3>
Citation
</h3>
2023 marks a significant date for the LOCKSS Program: It is the
twenty-fifth anniversary of the friendly hikes in Joseph Grant State
Park and Big Basin where Victoria Reich and Dr. David S.R.[sic]
Rosenthal first conceived of LOCKSS, “lots of copies keeps stuff safe,”
as a guiding principle for long-term access and preservation to digital
library resources. It is also the twentieth anniversary of the
transition of the LOCKSS project from beta testing in 2002 to full
production release. In the words of the duo’s nominator, “Even if you
don’t know David Rosenthal and Vicky Reich by name, you’ve almost
certainly heard their rallying cry for digital preservation: Lots Of
Copies Keep Stuff Safe. This ethos has informed digital preservation
best practices since its introduction, and has shaped the design and
implementation of the LOCKSS open-source software.”<br /> <br /> David
Rosenthal and Vicky Reich’s brainchild—and the enduring preservation
networks that it has made possible—was at the leading edge of a global
wave of digital preservation initiatives in the early 20th century. The
effectiveness and reliability of LOCKSS software has been validated
through rigorous third-party evaluation, including ongoing certification
of the CLOCKSS archive as a trustworthy digital repository under the
TRAC standard since 2014. The LOCKSS project has provided enduring proof
of the concept that large-scale digital preservation work can be
accomplished cost-effectively and with community benefits (not vendor
profits) as the primary driver.<br /> <br /> Rosenthal and Reich’s work
on LOCKSS stands as a benchmark against which other approaches to
digital preservation and persistent access to digital resources are
measured. <br />
<h3>
Response
</h3>
The LOCKSS Program was
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2023/10/lockss-program-turns-25.html">25
years old</a> last month. Vicky and David would like to thank:<br />
<ul>
<li>
The international user community and Stanford staff who are using,
evolving and improving the software.
</li>
<li>
Our far sighted funders who got the program up and running —
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Lesk">Michael Lesk</a> at
the NSF and then
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2019/08/a-tribute-to-don-waters.html">Don
Waters</a> at the Mellon Foundation.
</li>
<li>
And three brilliant Stanford Computer Science PhD students who provided
the <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/945445.945451">award winning
science</a> behind the technology — Mema Roussopoulos, Petros Maniatis
and TJ Giuli.
</li>
</ul>
We learned many lessons over the two decades we worked on the program,
none of them a surprise to anyone in the preservation business. Two that
are key. For a program to survive the long term it is critical to:<br />
<ul>
<li>
Build and nurture relationships, among the staff, among the user
community, and with the funders.
</li>
<li>
Document, document, document. Write it down, whatever it is. Over a
quarter-century it is easy to forget things such as “why was it done
this way?”.
</li>
</ul>
<p>We are honored by and grateful for this award, and happy that the
program we left for our new career as full-time grandparents is
flourishing in good hands.<br /> <br /></p>

<h2 id="more-pandas-will-be-coming-to-us-chinas-president-signals">More
Pandas Will Be Coming to US, China’s President Signals</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Chinese President Xi Jinping signaled that China will send new pandas
to the United States, calling them “envoys of friendship between the
Chinese and American peoples.”</p>
<p>“We are ready to continue our cooperation with the United States on
panda conservation, and do our best to meet the wishes of the
Californians so as to deepen the friendly ties between our two peoples,”
Xi said Wednesday during a dinner speech with business leaders.</p>
<p>The gesture came at the end of a day in which Xi and President Joe
Biden held their first face to face meeting in a year and pledged to try
to reduce tensions. Xi did not share additional details on when or where
pandas might be provided but appeared to suggest the next pair of pandas
are most likely to come to California, probably San Diego.</p>
<p>The bears have long been the symbol of the U.S.-China friendship
since Beijing gifted a pair of pandas to the National Zoo in Washington
in 1972, ahead of the normalization of bilateral relations. Later,
Beijing loaned the pandas to other U.S. zoos, with proceeds going back
to panda conservation programs.</p>
<p>The National Zoo’s three giant pandas, Mei Xiang, Tian Tian and their
cub Xiao Qi Ji, eight days ago began their long trip to China. After
their departure, only four pandas are left in the United States, in the
Atlanta Zoo.</p>
<p>“I was told that many American people, especially children, were
really reluctant to say goodbye to the pandas, and went to the zoo to
see them off,” Xi said in his speech. He added that he learned the San
Diego Zoo and people in California “very much look forward to welcoming
pandas back.”</p>
<p>Xi is in California to attend a summit of Indo-Pacific leaders and
for his meeting with Biden. He made no mention of the pandas during his
public remarks earlier in the day as he met with Biden.</p>
<p>When bilateral relations began to sour in the past few years, members
of the Chinese public started to demand the return of giant pandas.
Unproven allegations that U.S. zoos mistreated the pandas, known as
China’s “national treasure,” flooded China’s social media.</p>
<p>But relations showed signs of stabilization as Xi traveled to San
Francisco to meet with Biden. The two men met for about four hours
Wednesday at the picturesque Filoli Historic House &amp; Garden, where
they agreed to cooperate on anti-narcotics, resume high-level military
communications and expand people-to-people exchanges.</p>
<p>The National Zoo’s exchange agreement with the China Wildlife
Conservation Association had been set to expire in early December and
negotiations to renew or extend the deal did not produce results.</p>
<p>The San Diego Zoo returned its pandas in 2019, and the last bear at
the Memphis, Tennessee, zoo went home earlier this year.</p>

id="analysts-china-prioritizes-de-escalation-with-us-through-xi-biden-meeting">Analysts:
China Prioritizes De-escalation With US Through Xi-Biden Meeting</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Following the meeting between U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese
leader Xi Jinping in San Francisco on Wednesday, analysts say Beijing is
hoping to de-escalate tension with the U.S. by easing its stance and
projecting a less confrontational tone.</p>
<p>“In the official readout, Xi states China has no plan to surpass or
supplant America and he also notes that China doesn’t export its
ideology, showing a markedly narrower scope of geopolitical ambition,”
Wen-ti Sung, a political scientist at the Australian National University
(ANU), told VOA in a written response.  </p>
<p>He said the messages are in stark contrast to Xi’s previous
proclamation that “the East is rising and the West is falling.”</p>
<p>In the official readout released on Thursday, Xi highlighted the
importance for Beijing and Washington to avoid confrontation, saying
that “turning their back on each other” is not an option for the two
superpowers.</p>
<p>“Major-country competition can’t solve the problems facing China and
the United States or the world,” he said. “The world is big enough to
accommodate both countries and one country’s success is an opportunity
for the other.”</p>
<p>Apart from emphasizing the need to avoid conflict, Xi said China has
no plan to “surpass or unseat the United States” and that it doesn’t
export its ideology.</p>
<p>He laid out five principles for Beijing and Washington to manage
bilateral relations, calling on both sides to develop a “right
perception,” jointly manage disagreements, advance mutually beneficial
cooperation, shoulder responsibilities as major countries, and promote
people-to-people ties.</p>
<p>“It is important that they appreciate each other’s principles and red
lines and have more communications, more dialogues, more consultations
and calmly handle their differences as well as accidents,” Xi said.</p>
<p>Some experts say the points highlighted in the readout and other
efforts from Beijing before the meeting all suggest the Chinese
government’s desire to frame the meeting between Biden and Xi as a
success. “I think the overall response [from Beijing] was firm but
positive,” Amanda Hsiao, senior China analyst at International Crisis
Group, told VOA by phone.</p>
<p>In her view, the Chinese government wants to project the image that
it remains in control of the bilateral relationship but it’s also
opening up to the U.S. “[Beijing wants to show] that it is extending a
gesture out to the U.S. to improve relations but it’s doing so from a
position of strength,” she said.</p>
<p>While some analysts view Beijing’s messages from the readout as
largely conciliatory and positive, others say it still reflects China’s
reservation about Washington’s possible attempt to influence its
governance system.</p>
<p>“The mention of not changing each other’s systems suggests China’s
suspicion that the United States is out to alter its communist
party-dominated system,” Ian Chong, a political scientist at National
Singapore University, told VOA in a written response.</p>
<p>Xi emphasizes ‘common interests’</p>
<p>Apart from emphasizing the importance of preventing competition from
escalating into conflict, Xi also highlighted the need for China and the
U.S. to expand cooperation in a wide range of areas, including economy,
trade, agriculture, climate change, and artificial intelligence.  </p>
<p>“The common interests between China and the United States have
increased, not decreased,” he said, according to the readout.</p>
<p>Despite his emphasis on broadening the scope of bilateral
cooperation, Xi also urged the U.S. to end export controls and the
practice of investment screening, referring to a government executive
order that restricts U.S. investments into Chinese companies or
Chinese-owned companies engaged in three advanced technology areas. 
 </p>
<p>“Stifling China’s technological progress is nothing but a move to
contain China’s high-quality development and deprive the Chinese people
of their right to development,” Xi said, adding that China’s development
and growth “won’t be stopped by external forces.”</p>
<p>Sung from ANU said these messages show that Washington’s controls
risking may be generating enough pressure on China to force Beijing to
“pivot back to a more conciliatory posture.”  </p>
<p>“China’s economic woes seem to be catching up with its foreign policy
rhetoric,” he told VOA.</p>
<p>As part of the effort to encourage foreign investment in China, Xi
told a group of U.S. business leaders that China would be a “friend and
partner” of the U.S. while reiterating that Beijing “never bet on the
United States to lose.”  </p>
<p>“The world needs China and the U.S. to work together for a better
future,” he told an audience of business leaders, including Apple CEO
Tim Cook and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. “China is ready to be a partner and
friend of the U.S.”</p>
<p>Given the economic slowdown that China has experienced since the
start of 2023, Chong in Singapore said Xi would like to encourage
foreign investment and technological exchanges, as it “could help foster
growth” in the Chinese economy.</p>
<p>Attempt to reduce tension over Taiwan</p>
<p>Despite the ongoing tension between China and the U.S. over Taiwan,
Xi still briefly addressed the topic during his meeting with Biden.
According to the readout, he urged the U.S. to “take real actions” to
honor its commitment of “not supporting Taiwan independence, stop arming
Taiwan and support China’s reunification.”  </p>
<p>“China will realize reunification, and this is unstoppable,” he
said.</p>
<p>Compared to previous statements on Taiwan, Hsiao from the
International Crisis Group said Xi’s remarks on Wednesday were
relatively brief. “In the past, you would see a long elaboration of
China’s position on Taiwan, but this tone is different,” she told
VOA.</p>
<p>In her view, the latest statement from Beijing is more specific about
what China is asking of the U.S. when it comes to Taiwan. “I think what
we have seen from this readout, as well as from the U.S. side, indicate
that the two sides are seeking to de-escalate around Taiwan,
particularly because there are elections coming up, which could create
unknowns in the relationship and could potentially see tensions flare
up,” Hsiao said.</p>
<p>While the messages from China seem more positive and conciliatory,
Hsiao said the essence of U.S.-China relations hasn’t changed.  </p>
<p>“It remains a competitive relationship and even if China continues to
say that it believes it’s not a competitive relationship, it will
continue to see Washington as a key rival in reality,” she told VOA.</p>
<p>She thinks the biggest achievement of the Biden-Xi meeting is to
create some protection against some key events that will take place in
the next year, including presidential elections in Taiwan and the U.S.
 </p>
<p>“It’s important that this meeting occurred so we have that buffer
going into the year where things might get commensurate,” Hsiao
said.</p>

Veterans often develop a unique slate of skills when serving in the
armed forces, but private-sector employers sometimes fail to recognize
those abilities. At a time when many companies are still struggling to
hire up, how can we more successfully match veterans’ talents with
civilian opportunities? Also: tackling discrimination in internet access

From the BBC World Service: Russia is the world’s largest producer of

the world’s semiconductor trade, but as tensions with China persist, is
it viable to have so much production in one place?

<h2 id="personal-software">Personal software</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-16, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
Personal software
</h1>
<p>
A few days ago, I was wondering about people writing the software for
their personal site – a blog or a wiki or a digital garden or a
Zettelkasten – running software the authors wrote themselves or got from
a friend. As it turns out, a few people sent me their links and so I’ve
started a collection called
<a href="https://transjovian.org/view/web-sites/index">The text and the
code go hand in hand</a>.
</p>
<p>
The following is a copy of the intro to the collection.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes I hear of “opinionated” software. That is, software which has
a strong vision of how to do a thing. If you like it, use it. If you
don’t, then don’t. But what happens if the software turns out to be
something the author of a site wrote for themselves? It’s more than
opinionated. It’s personal.
</p>
<p>
This website presents a number of sites and the tools they use to create
and update them.
</p>
<p>
If you’re wondering why the list is small, the explanation is that
personal tools are not tidied up and yet we live in a world of software
that is written for being shared. In the corporate context, team
members, reviewers and successors need to understand the code. In the
private world, public code is polished in order to reflect well on
programmers and their abilities.
</p>
<p>
But <em>night software</em> is not like that. It’s not written for the
day job. It’s not written to see the light of day at all. It’s not
written to be looked at and scrutinized by anybody. It’s intimate and
personal, it’s messy and buggy. To take a look is to transgress.
</p>
<p>
And yet, this software offers the unique chance of being the kernel of
convivial software: a tool that we can not only learn how to use but
that we can disassemble and reassemble. We can imagine little computer
clubs discussing our tools, showing how we added this feature or that
feature. It is possible because the tools are small.
</p>
<p>
So if you’re thinking “that stuff is all a huge tangled mess” and “the
code generating my website is not for the public…” – then rest assured.
This is exactly what I’m trying to show. I remember my first system
being a collection of GNU M4 macros and a Makefile and I’d publish it in
a heartbeat, if I still had it. That’s how I wrote my GeoCities pages.
</p>
<p>
I’d love to show the world the unpolished, “just good enough with a
number of bugs I know of” solutions. Let me know if you have one.

Warrantless Surveillance Law Up for Renewal Amid Calls for Reform</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A controversial section of federal law that gives U.S. intelligence
agencies the ability to conduct warrantless surveillance of the
communications of non-U.S. persons abroad will expire at the end of the
year, creating pressure on Congress to renew it, even as privacy
activists demand that it be reformed.  </p>
<p>Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA)
allows electronic surveillance of non-U.S. persons overseas and outside
the United States for purposes of national security. It also contains a
provision allowing for surveillance of foreign intelligence targets
within the U.S., subject to the approval of a special Foreign
Intelligence Surveillance court.    </p>
<p>Because the surveillance of foreign nationals can often pick up the
communications of American citizens who are not its direct target, many
civil liberties organizations believe FISA operations violate legal
protections on individual privacy. Adding to that concern is the fact
that the information collected as part of FISA surveillance can be
queried by domestic law enforcement agencies, such as the Federal Bureau
of Investigation, without a warrant. Critics say this practice amounts
to “backdoor searches.”  </p>
<p>Investigations in recent years have found numerous instances in which
law enforcement agencies have abused the FISA process to obtain access
to information about U.S. nationals. That includes operations that
gathered information about former President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign
team and others that targeted the leaders of the Black Lives Matter
movement.  </p>
<p>Rights groups object  </p>
<p>Jeramie D. Scott, senior counsel and director of the Electronic
Privacy Information Center’s (EPIC) Project on Surveillance Oversight,
told VOA that his group believes the law should only be renewed if major
safeguards are added.  </p>
<p>“EPIC and our coalition partners have been very clear that Section
702 should not be reauthorized without significant reforms, including a
warrant requirement for searches of U.S. persons’ information,” he wrote
in an email exchange.  </p>
<p>Kia Hamadanchy, a senior policy counsel with the American Civil
Liberties Union, said that his organization has been challenging Section
702 since the day FISA was signed into law, and that its opposition
continues.    </p>
<p>“We have serious, serious concerns with how the problem is being
operated,” he told VOA. “Over the last 15 years, we’ve seen a whole host
of abuses. … So, our current position is that Section 702 should not be
reauthorized absent fundamental reform.”    </p>
<p>Law enforcement cites need  </p>
<p>In an appearance before the House Committee on Homeland Security on
Wednesday, FBI Director Christopher Wray delivered prepared testimony in
which he outlined a broad range of security threats facing the country,
and said that allowing Section 702 to expire, or restricting its use,
would make the country less safe.  </p>
<p>“Loss of this vital provision, or its reauthorization in a narrowed
form, would raise profound risks,” Wray said. “For the FBI in
particular, either outcome could mean substantially impairing, or in
some cases entirely eliminating, our ability to find and disrupt many of
the most serious security threats.”  </p>
<p>At the same hearing, Christine Abizaid, director of the National
Counterterrorism Center (NCTC), described Section 702 as essential to
protecting the country against terrorist attacks.  </p>
<p>“One of the most important questions for NCTC to determine is whether
international terrorists could gain access to and pose a threat to the
Homeland,” Abizaid said in her prepared testimony. “Section 702 is
essential for our ability to do that, and without it, the United States
and the world will be less safe.”  </p>
<p>Different tracks in Congress  </p>
<p>There appear to be at least two competing Section 702 reauthorization
proposals making their way through Congress.  </p>
<p>Last week, a bipartisan group of lawmakers from both the House of
Representatives and the Senate announced the introduction of the
Government Surveillance Reform Act, which would reauthorize Section 702
with significant restrictions.  </p>
<p>Among other things, the bill would require domestic law enforcement
agencies to obtain a warrant before searching FISA data for information
about American citizens. It has been endorsed by a large number of civil
liberties organizations. </p>
<p>“Americans know that it is possible to confront our country’s
adversaries ferociously without throwing our constitutional rights in
the trash can,” said Senator Ron Wyden, one of the co-sponsors, when the
bill was introduced. “But for too long, surveillance laws have not kept
up with changing times.” </p>
<p>Narrower reform    </p>
<p>On Tuesday, the news organization Politico obtained a set of talking
points outlining the shape of a competing Section 702 reauthorization
proposal being considered by the House Permanent Select Committee on
Intelligence. The restrictions it would place on law enforcement use of
Section 702 are fewer. For example, domestic law enforcement agencies
would only need to obtain a warrant to search FISA data for “evidence of
a crime.”  </p>
<p>Rights groups criticized the intelligence committee’s version of
reform for not going far enough.  </p>
<p>“Limiting a warrant requirement to ‘evidence of a crime’ searches
does little to address the well-documented abuses of the 702 authority,”
said Scott of EPIC. “Furthermore, any serious proposal for reform needs
to go beyond 702 to close similar loopholes that allow the government to
obtain Americans’ information without a warrant. To not do so is to not
take Americans’ privacy and civil liberties seriously.”</p>

id="progress-in-childhood-cancer-has-stalled-for-blacks-and-hispanics-us-report-says">Progress
in Childhood Cancer has Stalled for Blacks and Hispanics, US Report
Says</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Advances in childhood cancer are a success story in modern medicine.
But in the past decade, those strides have stalled for Black and
Hispanic youth, opening a gap in death rates, according to a new report
published Thursday.</p>
<p>Childhood cancers are rare and treatments have improved drastically
in recent decades, saving lives.</p>
<p>Death rates were about the same for Black, Hispanic and white
children in 2001, and all went lower during the next decade. But over
the next 10 years, only the rate for white children dipped a little
lower.</p>
<p>“You can have the most sophisticated scientific advances, but if we
can’t deliver them into every community in the same way, then we have
not met our goal as a nation,” said Dr. Sharon Castellino, a pediatric
cancer specialist at Emory University’s Winship Cancer Institute in
Atlanta, who had no role in the new report.</p>
<p>She said the complexity of new cancers treatments such as gene
therapy, which can cure some children with leukemia, can burden families
and be an impediment to getting care.</p>
<p>“You need at least one parent to quit their job and be there 24/7,
and then figure out the situation for the rest of their children,”
Castellino said. “It’s not that families don’t want to do that. It’s
difficult.”</p>
<p>More social workers are needed to help families file paperwork to get
job-protected leave and make sure the child’s health insurance is
current and doesn’t lapse.</p>
<p>The overall cancer death rate for children and teenagers in the U.S.
declined 24% over the two decades, from 2.75 to 2.10 per 100,000,
according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report.</p>
<p>The 2021 rate per 10,000 was 2.38 for Black youth, 2.36 for Hispanics
and 1.99 for whites.</p>
<p>Nearly incurable 50 years ago, childhood cancer now is survivable for
most patients, especially those with leukemia. The leading cause of
cancer deaths in kids is now brain cancer, replacing leukemia.</p>
<p>Each year in the U.S. about 15,000 children and teens are diagnosed
with cancer. More than 85% live for at least five years.</p>
<p>The improved survival stems from research collaboration among more
than 200 hospitals, said Dr. Paula Aristizabal of the University of
California, San Diego. At Rady Children’s Hospital, she is trying to
include more Hispanic children, who are underrepresented in
research.</p>
<p>“Equity means that we provide support that is tailored to each
family,” Aristizabal said.</p>
<p>The National Cancer Institute is working to gather data from every
childhood cancer patient with the goal of linking each child to
state-of-the-art care. The effort could improve equity, said Dr. Emily
Tonorezos, who leads the institute’s work on cancer survivorship.</p>
<p>The CDC’s report is “upsetting and discouraging,” she said. “It gives
us a roadmap for where we need to go next.”</p>

id="biden-cites-moves-on-fentanyl-ai-and-military-communications-after-xi-meeting">Biden
Cites Moves on Fentanyl, AI and Military Communications After Xi
Meeting</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden said he made “positive steps” during an
intense hourslong meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping
Wednesday.</p>
<p>The two agreed to re-establish lapsed military communications, work
together to assess the threats posed by artificial intelligence, and
work to combat the scourge of fentanyl.</p>
<p>However, Biden’s off-the-cuff comment that he still sees the powerful
Chinese leader as a “dictator,” revealed that the two leaders remain, in
some ways, far apart.</p>
<p>“Well, look, he is,” Biden said, in response to a shouted question
from the clamoring throng of journalists at the secluded meeting site
outside of San Francisco, where 21 Asia-Pacific economies are holding a
summit this week.</p>
<p>“He is a dictator in a sense that he is a guy that runs a country, a
communist country, that’s based on a totally different form of
government than ours.”</p>
<p>The White House chose a sprawling, bucolic estate more than an hour’s
drive from San Francisco for this heavily symbolic visit covering a
range of key issues that included Taiwan – the self-governing island
that China claims – the possible resumption of military communications,
touchy trade disagreements, the origination of fentanyl ingredients in
China, and human rights issues.</p>
<p>The scenic grounds cover the San Andreas fault, where the Pacific and
North American tectonic plates touch.</p>
<p>Biden said he was “candid” on these tough issues that divide the two
countries – as seen in the mixed reception that residents of this
diverse city gave to the Chinese leader, with both anti-communist
protesters and pro-Xi greeters lining the streets. On Wednesday, groups
in at least two locations descended into fisticuffs, as documented in
videos posted on social media.</p>
<p>Xi, in his brief remarks before the leaders began their meeting, said
the two nations are inextricably linked.</p>
<p>“For two large countries like China, the United States turning their
back on each other is not an option,” he said. “It is unrealistic for
one side to remodel the other. And conflict and confrontation has
unbearable consequences for both sides.</p>
<p>I’m still of the view that major country competition is not to the
prevailing trend of current times and cannot solve the problems facing
China and the United States or the world at large.</p>
<p>Planet Earth is big enough for the two countries to succeed and one
country’s success is an opportunity for the other.”</p>
<p>So did the presidents of the world’s two most powerful nations manage
to paper over the cracks in their relationship?</p>
<p>Biden spoke to the press afterwards. Xi, as is his habit, did
not.</p>
<p>The two did not release a joint statement.</p>
<p>“I welcome the positive steps we’ve taken today,” Biden said. ”And
it’s important for the world to see that we’re implementing the approach
in the best traditions of American diplomacy. We’re talking to our
competitors, just talking and being blunt with one another so there’s no
misunderstanding.”</p>
<p>Biden stopped far short of praising Xi, saying, “We have
disagreements. He has a different view than I have on a lot of things.
But he’s been straight. I don’t mean that good, bad or indifferent –
just been straight.”</p>
<p>In the administration’s post-meeting readout, the White House said
Biden repeated Washington’s long-held stance on Taiwan.</p>
<p>“President Biden emphasized that our one China policy has not changed
and has been consistent across decades and administrations,” the readout
said. “He reiterated that the United States opposes any unilateral
changes to the status quo from either side, that we expect cross-strait
differences to be resolved by peaceful means, and that the world has an
interest in peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. He called for
restraint in the PRC’s use of military activity in and around the Taiwan
Strait.”</p>
<p>Craig Singleton, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of
Democracies in Washington, told VOA he was struck by the leaders’ words
on Taiwan.</p>
<p>“China often claims the U.S. is seeking to alter the status quo in
the Strait,” he said. “The opposite is true. Xi’s stark comments expose,
yet again, his desire to speed up reunification timetables, either
through military force or coercion.”</p>
<p>Many watching this meeting said they weren’t expecting major results,
but are glad the two leaders are talking.</p>
<p>“This engagement, for example, between President Biden and Xi
Jinping, to me it is critical because it should give a clear message
that we are here to be able to work together and trust each other to
resolve serious problems: Climate, issues in Ukraine or Gaza,” said
Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. ”There are too many contentious
issues in the world and you must try and engage.”</p>
<p>Analysts say the success of the ongoing summit of Asia-Pacific
economies – happening simultaneously in San Francisco – depends on the
world’s two largest economies getting along.</p>
<p>“I think it’s an important meeting between President Biden and
President Xi, with the primary goal of stabilizing the relationship
heading into 2024,” said Michael Froman, president of the Council on
Foreign Relations.</p>
<p>“Both for bilateral purposes but also very importantly for the
broader APEC region. The countries there, the economies there, want the
U.S. and China to have some kind of modus vivendi, some kind of stable
relationship, particularly in anticipation of Taiwan’s election in
January, the U.S. election in November.”</p>
<p>Biden, when asked what he told Xi about Taiwan’s elections, said: “I
made clear I didn’t expect any interference.”</p>
<p>The Foundation for Defense of Democracies’ Singleton told VOA that he
interpreted Xi’s words on “peaceful coexistence” differently, saying it
“harkens back to Cold War-era language by Nikita Khrushchev, who
promoted the notion of ‘peaceful coexistence’ between the U.S. and
Soviet Union. Like today, previous policies aimed at stability
counter-intuitively extended the Soviet system’s survival, treating the
Soviet Union as an immutable juggernaut, rather than one whose demise
was inevitable.”</p>
<p>Biden said the leaders will continue to talk. And on Thursday, they
will give the other 19 Asia-Pacific economies a visual reminder of where
they each stand, when the leaders pose for the so-called “family photo”
— a ritual that is a hallmark of these major summits.</p>

Congress Approves Deal, Pushing Shutdown Threat to January</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Ending the threat of a government shutdown until after the holidays,
Congress gave final approval Wednesday night to a temporary government
funding package that pushes a confrontation over the federal budget into
the new year.</p>
<p>The Senate met into the night to pass the bill with an overwhelming
87-11 tally and send it to President Joe Biden for his signature one day
after it passed the House on an overwhelming bipartisan vote. It
provides a funding patch into next year, when the House and Senate will
be forced to confront — and somehow overcome — their considerable
differences over what funding levels should be.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the bill removes the threat of a government shutdown
days before funding would have expired.</p>
<p>“This Friday night there will be no government shutdown,” Senate
Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a floor speech ahead of the final
vote.</p>
<p>The spending package keeps government funding at current levels for
roughly two more months while a long-term package is negotiated.
It splits the deadlines for passing full-year appropriations bills into
two dates: Jan. 19 for some federal agencies and Feb. 2 for others,
creating two deadlines where there will be a risk of a partial
government shutdown.</p>
<p>“Everybody is really kind of ready to vote and fight another day,”
Republican Whip John Thune, the No. 2 Republican, said earlier
Wednesday.</p>
<p>The spending package would keep government funding at current levels
for roughly two more months while a long-term package is negotiated.
It splits the deadlines for passing full-year appropriations bills into
two dates: Jan. 19 for some federal agencies and Feb. 2 for others,
creating two deadlines where there will be a risk of a partial
government shutdown.</p>
<p>The spending bill does not include the White House’s nearly $106
billion request for wartime aid for Israel and Ukraine, as well as
humanitarian funding for Palestinians and other supplemental requests.
Lawmakers are likely to turn their attention more fully to that request
after the Thanksgiving holiday in hopes of negotiating a deal.</p>
<p>Schumer called the stopgap funding plan “far from perfect,” but said
he would support it because it averts a shutdown and “will do so without
any of the cruel cuts or poison pills” that hardline conservatives
wanted.</p>
<p>House Speaker Mike Johnson, who crafted the plan, has vowed that he
will not support any further stopgap funding measures, known as
continuing resolutions. He portrayed the temporary funding bill as
setting the ground for a spending “fight” with the Senate next year.</p>
<p>The new speaker, who told reporters this week that he counted himself
among the “arch-conservatives” of the House, is pushing for deeper
spending cuts. He wanted to avoid lawmakers being forced to consider a
massive government funding package before the December holidays — a
tactic that incenses conservatives in particular.</p>
<p>But Johnson is also facing pushback from other hardline conservatives
who wanted to leverage the prospect of a government shutdown to extract
steep cuts and policy demands.</p>
<p>Many of those conservatives were among a group of 19 Republicans who
defied Johnson Wednesday to prevent floor consideration of an
appropriations bill to fund several government agencies.</p>
<p>GOP leaders called off the week’s work after the vote, sending
lawmakers home early for Thanksgiving. It capped a period of intense
bickering among lawmakers.</p>
<p>“This place is a pressure cooker,” Johnson said Tuesday, noting that
the House had been in Washington for 10 weeks straight.</p>
<p>The House GOP’s inability to present a united front on funding
legislation could undercut the Louisiana congressman’s ability to
negotiate spending bills with the Senate.</p>
<p>Republicans are demanding that Congress work out government funding
through 12 separate bills, as the budgetary process requires, but House
leadership has so far been forced to pull two of those bills from the
floor, seen another rejected on a procedural vote and struggled to win
support for others.</p>
<p>When it returns in two weeks, Congress is expected to focus on the
Biden administration’s requests for Ukraine and Israel funding.
Republican senators have demanded that Congress pass immigration and
border legislation alongside additional Ukraine aid, but a bipartisan
Senate group working on a possible compromise has struggled to find
consensus.</p>
<p>Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell in a floor speech pledged
that Republicans would continue to push for policy changes on the U.S.
border with Mexico, saying it is “impossible to ignore the crisis at our
southern border that’s erupted on Washington Democrats’ watch.”</p>
<p>One idea floating among Republicans is directly tying Ukraine funding
levels with decreases in the number of illegal border crossings. It
showed how even longtime supporters of Ukraine’s defense against Russia
are willing to hold up the funding to force Congress to tackle an issue
that has flummoxed generations of lawmakers: U.S. border policy.</p>
<p>Most Senate Republicans support the Ukraine funding, said Sen. Kevin
Cramer, R-N.D., but he added, “It is secondary to securing our own
border.”</p>
<p>But the U.S. is already trimming some of the wartime aid packages it
is sending Ukraine as funds run low, National Security Council
spokesperson John Kirby said from San Francisco, where he accompanied
President Joe Biden for a summit of Asia-Pacific leaders.</p>
<p>He said the pot of money available for Ukraine is “withering away,
and with it will be a deleterious effect on Ukraine’s ability to
continue to defend itself.”</p>
<p>Schumer said the Senate would try to move forward on both the funding
and border legislation in the coming weeks, but warned it would require
a compromise.</p>
<p>“Both sides will have to give,” he said.</p>

<h2 id="classmates-beat-las-vegas-teen-17-to-death-police-say">10
Classmates Beat Las Vegas Teen, 17, to Death, Police Say</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A 17-year-old high school student in Las Vegas was beaten to death in
an alleyway around the corner from campus by 10 of his classmates
between the ages of 13 and 17, a prearranged fight that authorities said
broke out over a pair of headphones and a vape pen.</p>
<p>But police homicide Lt. Jason Johansson said that detectives think
the victim wasn’t originally supposed to be involved in the brawl, which
the students agreed would take place after classes were done for the day
at Rancho High School in eastern Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Jonathan Lewis Jr. walked to the alleyway with his friend, whose
headphones and vape pen had been stolen, Johansson said.</p>
<p>The deadly beating on Nov. 1 was captured on cellphone video and
widely shared on social media. Johansson described the footage as “very
void of humanity.”</p>
<p>In the video, he said, the victim is seen taking off his shirt to
prepare for the fight, and then the 10 students “immediately swarm him,
pull him to the ground and begin kicking, punching and stomping on
him.” </p>
<p>Eight of the students were arrested Tuesday by Las Vegas police and
the FBI on suspicion of murder. They were not immediately identified
because they are under 18. </p>
<p>Las Vegas police said they haven’t yet been able to identify the two
remaining students, who will also face murder charges. The police
department released images of the teenagers, asking for help from the
public to identify them. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>On Wednesday afternoon, as classes ended for the day and students
were leaving campus, a small memorial with flowers and eight candles sat
against a fence in the alleyway where Lewis was killed. </p>
<p>Rancho High School principal Darlin Delgado said in a letter this
week to parents that support and resources were available for students
and staff members as the beating “has and will continue to impact our
school community.”</p>
<p>Scott Coffee, a deputy public defender with 28 years of experience in
Las Vegas, said it is unusual to have so many co-defendants of such
young ages charged with murder in a single case. Coffee said he had not
seen court documents and does not represent any of the defendants.</p>
<p>“When kids are involved in this kind of activity, they take the risk
by being involved,” Coffee said. “But the flip side is this: Does it
look like anybody intended to kill anyone?”</p>
<p>A family court judge on Wednesday ordered four of the students who
are 16 or older to be transferred to the adult court system, the
Review-Journal reported. Hearings will be held at later dates to
determine if the students under 16 will be charged as adults.</p>
<p>Police and prosecutors will have to measure the level of culpability
for each of the 10 defendants as the case moves through the court
system, Coffee noted. </p>
<p>“Was there somebody in charge of this group? Was somebody younger
just going along with the older folks?” he said, adding that although
the students face similar charges at the time of their arrests, “it
doesn’t mean the resolutions are necessarily going to be similar.”</p>
<p>After the brawl, a person in the area found the teenager badly beaten
and unconscious in the alleyway and carried him back to campus, where
school staff called 911, police said.</p>
<p>Lewis was hospitalized with severe head trauma and other injuries
until his death a week later. The coroner’s office in Las Vegas ruled
the beating a homicide.</p>
<p>The victim’s father, Jonathan Lewis Sr., didn’t respond Wednesday to
requests for an interview. But on a fundraising page he created to help
with funeral and medical expenses, he wrote that his son was attacked
while standing up for his friend.</p>
<p>“Our son is a kind, loving, gentle young man who has the heart of a
champion and the brightest loving energy that attracts people to him
with love,” the page reads.</p>

Protest in Front of DC Democrat Headquarters, Calling for Gaza
Cease-Fire</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Police in the nation’s capital responded Wednesday night to a protest
outside the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee calling
for a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war.</p>
<p>U.S. Capitol Police said about 150 people were “illegally and
violently protesting” near the DNC headquarters building in the Capitol
Hill neighborhood of Washington. Members of Congress were evacuated from
the building as the protest erupted.</p>
<p>Video posted on social media showed protesters shoving police
officers and trying to grab hold of metal barricades as the officers
moved in to make arrests. The videos also show officers shoving
protesters. Many of the protesters were wearing black shirts that read
“Cease Fire Now.”</p>
<p>Protesters included members of If Not Now and Jewish Voice for Peace,
who have organized other demonstrations in Washington.</p>
<p>If Not Now posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, that “police are
being extremely violent.”</p>
<p>“We are linking arms, threatening no one, and begging our politicians
to support an end to the killing and the suffering in Gaza. Begging,
peacefully, for a cease-fire,” the group posted.</p>
<p>The clashes Wednesday evening are the latest example of roiling
tensions over the war between Israel and Hamas.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden has been under increasing pressure from the
Democratic Party’s left flank over his support for Israel’s military
operation, including interruptions from protesters at his speeches. He
has resisted calls for a cease-fire, instead saying there should be
pauses in the fighting to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian
assistance and the potential extraction of hostages.</p>
<p>Last week, a large number of House Democrats joined nearly all
Republicans in voting to censure Rep. Rashida Tlaib, the only
Palestinian American in Congress, over her criticism of the Israeli
government’s treatment of Palestinians.</p>
<p>Tlaib, who has family in the West Bank, came under heavy criticism
after she failed to immediately condemn Hamas after the attack. She
since has called out the terrorist group while also calling for a
cease-fire.</p>
<p>The Metropolitan Police Department said its officers also responded
to the disturbance. Officials sent an alert to congressional staffers
telling them no one would be permitted to enter or exit any House office
buildings.</p>
<p>Rep. Brad Sherman, a California Democrat, said he was evacuated from
the building by police after protesters began “pepper-spraying police
officers and attempting to break into the building.”</p>

<h2 id="xi-invites-old-friends-from-iowa-to-california-dinner">Xi
Invites ‘Old Friends’ From Iowa to California Dinner</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Among the guests at a $2,000-a-plate dinner for Xi Jinping Wednesday
night was Luca Berrone, attending as a guest of the Chinese
government.</p>
<p>The Des Moines businessman worked with the volunteer-driven Iowa
Sister States program to establish a relationship with Hebei Province in
1983. It was a connection made with corn and solidified with soybeans by
an organization that “is dedicated to connecting Iowans with to the
world community.”</p>
<p>The group’s mission, it says “is to develop and implement programs
that promote the cultural, economic and other interests of Iowa and its
friends around the world.”</p>
<p>One of those friends rose decades later to become the leader of a 1.4
billion-person-strong global superpower while retaining a fondness for
the Iowans he met almost 40 years ago despite the mutual suspicion that
marks China’s relationship with the U.S.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1985, as the coordinator of the nonprofit Iowa
Sister States, Berrone hosted Xi, then party committee secretary of
Zhengding County, Hebei Province, and his delegation. Berrone arranged
their itinerary and escorted Xi for two weeks as they explored the
farmland around Muscatine, a city of about 24,000 people in southeast
Iowa.</p>
<p>The not-yet-famous Xi bunked in a bedroom in the home of a local
family, freed up because their son was away at college. That solution to
a logistical problem, Berrone told The Des Moines Register, is key to
Xi’s bond with Iowa.</p>
<p>“The only hotel available in Muscatine was all booked up. So I
reached out to Sarah Lande, who was on the (Iowa Sister States)
committee, and I asked if it was possible to organize home stays for the
Chinese delegation, and she was able to contact a few families that were
interested,” Berrone told the Register. “And it turned out those home
stays were a turning point in building those long-term friendships.”</p>
<p>The People’s Daily, the Chinese Communist Party’s official newspaper,
noted that the delegation “visited elderly people in the local
community, attended a birthday party, had six interviews with local
media outlets and attended five welcome banquets held by the U.S.
side.”</p>
<p>Berrone told VOA Mandarin on Monday afternoon that the five gentlemen
of Hebei Province were congenial and personable.</p>
<p>“President Xi was very curious and intelligent,” he told VOA
Mandarin. “I made sure they learned as much as possible about
agricultural methods, technology and processing.”</p>
<p>In addition, there was a hog roast, a boat trip on the Mississippi
River and rides on advanced farming equipment.</p>
<p>“We had a really good time in two weeks,” Berrone told Fortune. “We
were like the road movie — five or six guys on a road trip.”</p>
<p>While the term “old friend” is often used by China to pay tribute to
foreigners seen as beneficial to the interests of the Party, such as
Henry Kissinger, it also can also carry a nostalgic feeling shared by
longtime companions who respect and enjoy each others’ company.</p>
<p>Xi returned to Iowa in 2012, the year before he started his first
five-year term as president and met with Berrone along with other old
friends. Lande recalled Xi saying, “You were the first people I met in
America, and to me, you are America,” according to Fortune.</p>
<p>In October 2013, Iowa companies and organizations signed 20
cooperative trade agreements with Hubei Province counterparts with a
combined value touted at more than $1 billion.</p>
<p>In March 2019, when Xi visited Italy, then-Italian Prime Minister
Giuseppe Conte invited Berrone to welcome Xi, an event Berrone told VOA
Mandarin was a highlight of his life.</p>

<h2 id="takeaways-from-bidens-long-awaited-meeting-with-xi">Takeaways
From Biden’s Long-Awaited Meeting With Xi</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>It was a meeting a year in the making.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping sat down
together on Wednesday just outside of San Francisco, where Asian leaders
gathered for an annual summit. It was almost exactly one year since
their last encounter in Bali, Indonesia, on the sidelines of another
global gathering.</p>
<p>In addition to a formal bilateral meeting, Biden and Xi shared a
lunch with top advisers and strolled the verdant grounds of the luxury
estate where their meeting took place.</p>
<p>There’s no word on whether Chinese pandas will return to Washington’s
zoo. But Biden said the meeting included “some of the most constructive
and productive discussions we’ve had.” Here’s a look at how the day
panned out.</p>
<p>New agreements</p>
<p>Biden left the meeting with commitments on key issues.</p>
<p>Xi agreed to help curb the production of the illicit fentanyl that is
a deadly component of drugs sold in the United States. A senior
administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to
discuss a private meeting, said the shift will be a setback for Latin
American drug dealers.</p>
<p>“It’s going to save lives, and I appreciated President Xi’s
commitment on this issue,” Biden said at a press conference after his
meeting.</p>
<p>In addition, Biden and Xi reached an agreement to resume
military-to-military communications. That means Defense Secretary Lloyd
Austin will speak with his Chinese counterpart once someone is named to
the job, the official said. Similar engagements will take place up and
down the military chain of command.</p>
<p>The official said Biden was “very clear” to Xi that such
communications between U.S. and China should be institutionalized and
that they are “not done as a gift or as a favor to either side.”</p>
<p>Biden said the U.S. and China would talk more about artificial
intelligence as well.</p>
<p>“We’re going to get our experts together and discuss risk and safety
issues,” he said.</p>
<p>The agreements helped fulfill the White House’s goal for the meeting
— prove to voters that Biden’s dedication to personal diplomacy is
paying off.</p>
<p>On Sunday, national security adviser Jake Sullivan told CNN that
Biden wanted “practical ways” to show that meeting with Xi can help
“defend American interests and also deliver progress on the priorities
of the American people.”</p>
<p>Zoe Liu, a fellow for China studies at the Council for Foreign
Relations, described the meeting between Biden and Xi as a positive
step, albeit an incremental one.</p>
<p>“These agreements will not change the structural challenges in the
bilateral relations, but it paves the way for more detailed
working-level discussions, which is more important,” she said.</p>
<p>Economic challenges</p>
<p>Xi arrived in San Francisco at a time of economic challenges back in
China, where an aging population and growing debt have hampered its
recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>According to Beijing’s description of the meeting, Xi pressed Biden
to lift sanctions and change policies on export controls for sensitive
equipment.</p>
<p>“Stifling China’s technological progress is nothing but a move to
contain China’s high-quality development and deprive the Chinese people
of their right to development,” the readout said. “China’s development
and growth, driven by its own inherent logic, will not be stopped by
external forces.”</p>
<p>There’s no indication that Biden will agree to take such steps. But
even the meeting itself could calm jittery nerves back in China, where
there have been signs foreign investment is tapering off.</p>
<p>Zhang Lei, a Chinese businessman whose company, Cheche Group, is
listed on NASDAQ, said high-level meetings such as the one between Biden
and Xi can help assure companies that have been hesitant to invest in
China.</p>
<p>“Confrontations don’t work,” he said. “You don’t make money with
confrontations.”</p>
<p>It’s personal</p>
<p>Biden and Xi go back years, and Biden often repeats the story of
their meetings when they were both vice presidents.</p>
<p>But on Wednesday, it was Xi’s turn to reference their previous
encounters during brief public remarks, although he eschewed the
embellishments that Biden usually adds to the tale.</p>
<p>“It was 12 years ago,” Xi said. “I still remember our interactions
very vividly, and it always gives me a lot of thoughts.”</p>
<p>Biden also emphasized the length of their relationship and the value
of their interactions.</p>
<p>“We haven’t always agreed, which was not a surprise to anyone, but
our meetings have always been candid, straightforward and useful,” Biden
said. He added, “It’s paramount that you and I understand each other
clearly, leader to leader, with no misconceptions or
miscommunication.”</p>
<p>Bilateral meetings aren’t always conducive to a personal touch, and
Biden and Xi were flanked by advisers on opposite sides of a long table.
However, a senior administration official said they spoke about their
wives, and Biden wished Xi’s wife a happy birthday.</p>
<p>The official, who requested anonymity to discuss a private
conversation, said Xi was embarrassed, and he admitted that he had
forgotten his wife’s upcoming birthday because he’s been working so
hard.</p>

Argue to Disqualify Trump From Colorado Ballot Over Jan. 6 Attack</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Lawyers representing a group of Colorado voters delivered closing
arguments on Wednesday in a lawsuit seeking to disqualify former
President Donald Trump from the state’s ballot next year over his role
in the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by his
supporters.</p>
<p>The voters are seeking to use the U.S. Constitution’s 14th Amendment,
which bars officials who have engaged in “insurrection or rebellion”
from holding public office, to argue that Trump is ineligible to run for
president in 2024. The provision was ratified in 1868 following the U.S.
Civil War.</p>
<p>Sean Grimsley, a lawyer representing the voters, said the riot at the
Capitol was Trump’s “final desperate attempt to hold onto power in
violation of the Constitution.”</p>
<p>During his closing argument, Grimsley argued that Trump intended for
his supporters to resort to violence and added, “Through his actions and
his actions alone, Donald Trump has disqualified himself from ever
holding office again.”</p>
<p>The case represents a test of legal efforts to use the 14th Amendment
to block Trump’s candidacy. It is the first such case to go to
trial.</p>
<p>Scott Gessler, a lawyer for Trump, faulted plaintiffs in the case for
relying on the findings of the Democratic-led House committee that
investigated the Capitol riot, which he said was biased against
Trump.</p>
<p>“The petitioners are asking this court to do something that has never
been done in the history of the United States,” Gessler said. “The
evidence doesn’t come close to allowing the court to do it this
time.”</p>
<p>The House panel’s former top investigator, who testified during the
trial, defended the probe as impartial and open-minded.</p>
<p>The voters, represented in the case by the watchdog group Citizens
for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) and a group of
Colorado-based lawyers, sued Colorado’s secretary of state, the state’s
top elections official, in a bid to block Trump’s inclusion on the
ballot.</p>
<p>Trump is the front-runner for the Republican nomination to challenge
Democratic President Biden in the 2024 U.S. election.</p>
<p>Lawyers in the case on Wednesday made their final pitch to Colorado
District Court Judge Sarah Wallace, who will decide the case, following
a weeklong trial that featured testimony from U.S. lawmakers, legal
experts and Republican political activists.</p>
<p>Thousands of people stormed the Capitol in a failed attempt to
prevent Congress from certifying Biden’s 2020 victory over Trump. The
lawyers for the voters have sought to convince the judge that Trump’s
actions in spreading false claims of voter fraud, summoning his
supporters to Washington on the day of the riot and initially refusing
pleas to quell the violence amounted to an insurrection.</p>
<p>Trump’s lawyers have denied that he incited his supporters to
violence and have argued that disqualifying him from the ballot would
set a dangerous precedent.</p>
<p>Colorado is regarded as a safely Democratic state by nonpartisan
election forecasters.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether Trump is on the ballot, Biden would be expected
to win there. But CREW and other activists are seeking to bring a series
of legal challenges to Trump’s eligibility based on the 14th Amendment
language.</p>
<p>Courts in Michigan and Minnesota have ruled that Trump can remain on
the ballot for the Republican primaries in those states but declined to
immediately decide on his eligibility for the November 2024 general
election.</p>
<p>The cases raise several unsettled legal questions. Many experts view
the effort as a legal longshot. The U.S. Supreme Court, whose 6-3
conservative majority includes three Trump appointees, may ultimately
weigh in.</p>

Participation at APEC Forum Offers Rare Chance to Break China’s
Bonds</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Taiwan will take part in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum
in San Francisco this week, a rare opportunity for the self-governing
island democracy of 23 million people and its high-tech economy to break
the diplomatic embargo on it imposed by authoritarian China.</p>
<p>Taiwan’s chief delegate will be a civilian rather than a government
figure or head of state, under an unwritten rule that satisfies China’s
contention that members of the organization participate as economic
entities rather than state players.</p>
<p>For the seventh time, Taiwan will be represented by Morris Chang, the
92-year-old founder of the world-leading Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Company. Chang is known as the godfather of the industry
that has put Taiwan in the top ranks of high-tech manufacturing and
personal electronic devices.</p>
<p>Taiwan has participated in APEC since 1991 under the name Chinese
Taipei. It began taking part just two years after the group’s inception
and the same year that China and the semi-autonomous Chinese city of
Hong Kong joined.</p>
<p>Taiwan has relied on retired ministers — and in Chang’s case,
industry leaders — who are well connected with the government but do not
carry the burden of formal office, which could spark a protest from
China. But that doesn’t mean Taiwan’s government won’t be represented.
Minister of Finance Chuang Tsui-yun will attend a meeting presided over
by U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who recently visited Beijing,
and two other ministers will attend meetings on Tuesday and
Wednesday.</p>
<p>Taiwan a major topic</p>
<p>A Japanese colony until the end of World War II, Taiwan split from
mainland China amid a civil war in 1949. China continues to claim the
island as its territory, to be annexed by force if necessary, a threat
it plays out on a near-daily basis by sending ships and warplanes around
the island.</p>
<p>These acts of political intimidation have the potential to wear down
the operational resiliency of the island’s military equipment and
personnel. Taiwan has just a fraction of the air, sea and missile power
of China’s People’s Liberation Army, not to mention its ground forces,
and relies heavily on young men doing their mandatory national service
to fill its ranks.</p>
<p>However, Taiwan in recent years has invested heavily in upgraded arms
purchases from the U.S., along with boosting its own defense industry,
most notably building submarines that could undermine the Chinese naval
threat. That has come partly in response to Chinese displays of force
such as sailing aircraft carriers through the economically crucial
Taiwan Strait and sending aircraft and drones to circle the island.</p>
<p>While the U.S. has no military treaty with Taiwan, it is obligated
under federal law to ensure the island can defend itself and to treat
all threats to the island as matters of “grave concern.” That, along
with Washington’s string of alliances from Japan to South Korea and the
Philippines, and its refusal to recognize China’s claim to virtually the
entire South China Sea, make the Taiwan Strait a potential powder keg
should Chinese leader Xi Jinping seek to make good on his determination
to unite what he views as China’s historical territory and cement his
political legacy.</p>
<p>China primarily wants an end to U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, including
latest model F-16 fighter jets, and an assurance it will not give an
electoral boost to the ruling pro-independence Democratic Progressive
Party.</p>
<p>U.S. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said Wednesday
that among the points that President Joe Biden will make clear to
President Xi is that the U.S., in accordance with its law, will continue
to provide “self-defense capabilities for Taiwan.”</p>
<p>Politics at play  </p>
<p>Even with China’s lackluster economic rebound from the COVID-19
pandemic, including high youth unemployment and massive debts born by an
overextended housing sector, Xi is pushing ahead with his vision for
China to reclaim its historical place as the center of cultural,
political and economic life in the Asia-Pacific.</p>
<p>Taiwan, with its multiparty system focused mostly on local issues and
with a broad consensus favoring political separation from China,
presents a unique challenge to those who call the shots inside the
cloistered Qing Dynasty-era leadership compound of Zhongnanhai in
Beijing. Almost entirely male and shielded from the media, they brought
Hong Kong to heel after pro-democracy protests broke out in the former
British colony in 2019.</p>
<p>China has sought to influence Taiwanese politics through military
threats, but also by using a “carrot and stick” approach toward economic
opportunities on the mainland and by enticing politicians, chiefly from
the main Nationalist Party, also known as the Kuomintang, or KMT, to
meet with high-level officials in Beijing.  </p>
<p>Taiwanese media outlets have also been persuaded to run stories
critical of the status quo of de facto independence, mainly through
their ownership structures, which involve substantial investments on the
mainland.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it comes down to the voters in Taiwan. January’s
elections for the presidency and legislature will be the best
determinant of whether the populace wishes to stay the course or seek a
greater degree of accommodation with Beijing.  </p>
<p>Current Vice President William Lai appears to be in a strong position
to win at least a plurality of the vote in his bid for the presidency,
while his opposition appears splintered and unable to form the sort of
alliances that could put the U.S.-trained medical professional under
substantial pressure, despite the vast sums being spent on advertising
by rivals such as electronics magnate Terry Gou.</p>

<h2 id="us-approves-spacex-for-2nd-launch-of-starship-super-heavy">US
Approves SpaceX for 2nd Launch of Starship Super Heavy</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration on Wednesday granted Elon
Musk’s SpaceX a license to launch the company’s second test flight of
its next-generation Starship and heavy-lift rocket from Texas, the
agency said. </p>
<p>SpaceX said it was targeting Friday for a launch, saying a two-hour
launch window opens at 7 a.m. Central Time (1300 GMT) and that local
residents “may hear a loud noise” during the rocket’s ascent toward
space. </p>
<p>“The FAA determined SpaceX met all safety, environmental, policy and
financial responsibility requirements,” the agency, which oversees
commercial launch sites, said in a statement. </p>
<p>SpaceX’s first attempt to send Starship to space was in April, when
the rocket exploded mid-air four minutes after a liftoff that pulverized
the company’s launchpad and flung sand and concrete chunks for
miles. </p>
<p>Though Musk, SpaceX’s CEO and founder, hailed the Starship launch
attempt as exceeding his expectations, it fell far short of its overall
test objectives to reach space, complete nearly a full revolution around
Earth, and reenter the atmosphere for a splashdown off a Hawaiian
coast. </p>
<p>First the moon, eventually Mars</p>
<p>Starship, standing taller than the Statue of Liberty at 120 meters
and designed to be fully reusable, represents SpaceX’s next-generation
workhorse rocket system capable of ferrying some 150 tons of satellites
into space. Plans also call for the rocket system to be used to carry
crews of humans to the moon, and eventually Mars. </p>
<p>The rocket is crucial for SpaceX’s increasingly dominant launch
business. NASA, under a roughly $4 billion development contract with
SpaceX, plans to use Starship around 2026 to land the first crew of
humans on the moon’s surface since 1972. </p>
<p>Hundreds of fixes before launch</p>
<p>The upcoming Starship flight will have the same test objectives as
the first attempt. SpaceX made hundreds of fixes to the rocket’s design
based on the April failure. The FAA required SpaceX to make dozens of
fixes before allowing another Starship flight. </p>
<p>SpaceX determined that an onboard fire prevented Starship — the
rocket system’s upper stage — from separating from its Super Heavy first
stage booster as planned. The rocket’s explosion was the result of an
automated destruction command, which triggered some 40 seconds late.</p>

From wood gas to plastic waste
</h2>
<p>
During the Second World War,
<a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2010/01/wood-gas-vehicles-firewood-in-the-fuel-tank/">many
motorized vehicles in continental Europe were converted to drive on
firewood</a>.
<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
That happened as a consequence of the rationing of fossil fuels. Wood
gas vehicles were a not-so-elegant alternative to their petrol cousins,
but their range was comparable to today’s electric vehicles. In Germany
alone, around 500,000 wood gas cars, buses, and trucks operated by the
end of WWII. An even more cumbersome alternative was the
<a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2011/11/gas-bag-vehicles/">gas
bag vehicle</a>.
<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Nowadays, there’s much less firewood available than in the 1940s,
especially in industrialized regions. So, what would be the solution to
the disruption of gasoline or electricity in the Third World War? Dutch
artist <a href="https://gijsschalkx.nl">Gijs Schalkx</a> found another
fuel supply, which is abundant: plastic waste. The production of
plastics only started in the 1950s, after the Second World War. Since
then, plastic has become an increasingly popular material, growing to a
global annual production of 460 million metric tons in 2019 – twice as
much as in 2000 and eight times as much as in 1976.
<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>

<p>
Plastics are made from fossil fuels, and the process can be turned
around. Gijs Schalkx converted an abandoned Volvo 240 to run on diesel
that he makes from the plastic waste he collects. The “de-refinery”
converts plastic waste back into fuel and is installed on the luggage
carrier of the car, making the vehicle independent of the fossil fuel
infrastructure. The plastic waste is heated in a boiler to about 700
degrees Celsius, after which it evaporates. The gas is then cooled down,
and turns into a diesel-like liquid one hour later. Gijs collects it in
plastic bottles – themselves the raw material for the diesel they
contain. The fuel looks like Coca-Cola – one of the largest producers of
plastic waste.
</p>
<h2 id="how-far-can-we-drive-on-plastic-waste">
How far can we drive on plastic waste?
</h2>
<p>
Making fuel can happen while the car drives, but Gijs has kept the two
activities separate for safety reasons. At a speed of 80 km/u, his Volvo
240 drives a distance of 7 kilometres per kilogram of plastic (which
corresponds to 14 kg of plastic per 100 km driven). That includes the
fuel used to heat up the plastic waste on the roof (1 kg of plastic
gives 0.5 liter of diesel). Plastic waste is a rather voluminous
material, and it takes several garbage bags full of plastic waste to
make one liter of fuel. Schalkx plans to use a small shredder to reduce
the volume of the plastic waste he collects, but for now he relies on a
supply of discarded plastic granulate from a neighbour, consisting of
PET and HDPE.

<p>
How far could we drive if we would convert all plastic waste into fuel?
The Netherlands produced roughly 1,650 kiloton of plastic waste in 2017
(1,650,000,000 kg), enough to drive 11.55 billion km (11,550,000,000
km).
<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>
That corresponds to about 1/10th of kilometers driven by all passenger
cars in the Netherlands in 2021 (114.3 billion km).
<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>
On a smaller scale, the average passenger vehicle in the Netherlands
drives 12,000 km per year, requiring each driver and their passengers to
collect 1,714 kg of plastic. On the other hand, even the current amount
of plastic waste per capita in the Netherlands (97 kg) would be enough
to drive 679 km – perhaps sufficient for those who use their automobile
wisely. The amount of plastic waste grows faster than the number of cars
so that we could drive increasingly longer distances in the future.
<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>
</p>
<h2 id="how-sustainable-is-driving-on-plastic-waste">
How sustainable is driving on plastic waste?
</h2>
<p>
Being able to drive a vehicle on plastic waste has benefits in terms of
resilience. For example, it could allow medics to operate ambulances
without a regular fuel supply in a war zone. However, how does a vehicle
driven on plastic waste performs in times of peace? After all, plastic
waste is a huge problem, and Gijs Schalkx’s car gets rid of it. With
less than 10% of plastic waste recycled worldwide, would it make sense
to encourage people to convert their vehicles to run on diesel oil made
of plastic waste? Sure, it would be a more affordable alternative to
electric cars, but what about the carbon emissions?
</p>
<p>
On the one hand, the embodied carbon emissions of the Volvo 240 are
almost zero: Gijs found most components – including the car itself – in
the dump, others on the second-hand market.
<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>
In contrast, manufacturing new vehicles – especially electric ones –
adds a significant carbon footprint before they drive their first
kilometer. They also need an extensive infrastructure to produce and
distribute fuel and electricity, adding more carbon emissions. In
contrast, the Volvo has its fuel infrastructure on the roof, built from
scrap.

<p>
On the other hand, the CO2-emissions from the fuel production and the
fuel combustion are not praiseworthy. First, there is the burning of
plastic on the roof of the car. Making 1 liter of diesel requires the
burning of 1 kg of plastic, which results in 2-2.7 kg carbon emissions.
<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>
Second, there is the combustion of the diesel fuel while driving, which
emits 2.7 kg of carbon dioxide per liter.
<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>
Together, that becomes 4.7 to 5.4 kg CO2 per liter. Consequently, with a
14:1 fuel economy, the Volvo emits 65.8 to 75.6 kg of greenhouse gases
per 100 km.
</p>
<p>
In contrast, the emissions of the average fossil fuel powered car in
Europe amount to 25.8 kg/100 km, including crude oil production, fuel
refining and vehicle manufacturing.
<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>
The emissions of a small electric car like the Nissan Leaf amount to
10.9 kg/100km in Europe, including the emissions of the fuel that is
burned to produce the electricity.
<sup id="fnref1:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>
The Volvo thus emits 2.5 times more CO2 than the average fossil fuel
powered car in Europe, and 7 times more than a small electric car. The
difference will be somewhat smaller, because the data for the other cars
do not include the emissions for building the oil and power
infrastructure. However, this is unlikely to tip the balance.
</p>
<p>
There are several reasons for the high carbon emissions. First, fuel
production by burning plastic on the roof is four times more carbon
intensive than producing fuel from crude oil in a refinery.
<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>
Second, the Volvo dates from 1980, when cars had lower fuel economy.
Gijs Schalkx: “Hypothetically, you could convert a newer car to drive on
plastic waste and have much lower carbon emissions. Likewise, the
de-refinery is one of the first of its kind and could be made more
efficient by real engineers. Oil refineries have been developped for
more than 100 years. However, newer cars have proprietary electronic
motor controls that prevent using alternative fuels.”

Carbon emissions are not the only worry. Because of the chemicals added
to plastic, burning it to make fuel creates a lot of nasty air
pollution. Nobody in their right mind will propose a switch to cars
fuelled by plastic waste. However, it is instructive to examine the
motives behind this unanimous conclusion. Much of the plastic waste that
the Volvo 240 burns burns anyways. Not in cars but incinerators. That is
the case for 44% of plastic waste in Europe.
<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>
That plastic waste burns to produce electricity, which can then charge
electric cars. How is that more sustainable than burning plastic on the
roof of your car?

The carbon emissions are the same. So is the air pollution, although
it’s easier to put a flue gas scrubber on thousands of incinerators than
on millions of cars. The main difference is that burning plastic waste
in incinerators to power electric cars allows many of us to
<em>externalize</em> the side effects of car driving. An incinerator can
be (and always is) located in a poor neighbourhood, where it causes high
incidences of cancer and other health problems in spite of air pollution
control. Meanwhile, it produces electricity that charges electric cars
which drive around low emission zones in well-to-do neighbourhoods.
</p>
<h2 id="internalizing-pollution">
Internalizing pollution
</h2>
<p>
In contrast, Schalkx’s Volvo <em>internalizes</em> all the side effects
of driving automobiles. The car is not a pleasure to drive, at least not
regularly. It is dirty. Its interior stinks of plastic, which cannot be
healthy – Gijs keeps the car windows open no matter the weather.
Furthermore, he needs to spend a lot of time collecting plastic and
making fuel, and all these disadvantages make him think twice before he
gets behind the wheel. It’s unlikely that Schalkx will drive 12,000 km
per year, and so, ultimately, he will produce less pollution than the
drivers of more sustainable-looking cars that face none of these
problems.
</p>
<p>
Somehow, the Dutch authorities, who are not known for their
permissivity, officially approved the car after inspection. Schalkx
drives tax-free and – thanks to his car being an oldtimer – can enter
low-emission zones, where he parks alongside the latest electric SUV.
Justice is not yet out of this world.

The plastics industry now consumes 14% of all oil production, compared
to only 4% in 2012. By 2050, the share of the plastics industry is
forecasted to be 20% of oil production. Sources:
