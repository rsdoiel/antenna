## European Energy Is Worried

date: 2024-07-30, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjUzNDU2OC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4MzEzMjk4OH0.AVYHTv2aUJB5blZozhP7JM1-vVKL9X8HGEkPcppjF5A/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p><em><strong>Current conditions: </strong>At least 45 are dead and many more are trapped in the Indian state of Kerala after heavy rainfall triggered landslides • California’s Park Fire, only 14% contained, is now the sixth-largest in the state’s history • Typhoon Gaemi’s death toll continues to climb as the storm’s remnants batter southern China • A flash flood hit the popular Dollywood theme park in Tennessee.</em></p><h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2><h3>1. European clean energy companies weigh their futures in the U.S. ahead of the presidential election</h3>
<p>European companies are considering whether to invest in new clean energy projects in the U.S. as November’s election looms, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/trump-effect-clean-tech-sector-deepens-angst-europes-boardrooms-2024-07-29/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>Reuters </em></em></u><u>reported on Monday</u></a>. The Inflation Reduction Act’s incentives for clean energy, EVs, and hydrogen – which drew many European firms to cross the Atlantic – are perceived to be in jeopardy in the event of a Trump victory. Companies like Thyssenkrupp Nucera, Nel, SMA Solar, and H2Apex, which have undertaken clean energy projects in the U.S. in the last two years, are all delaying investment decisions over worries that tax credits and demand could dry up. </p>
<p>Their concerns are warranted. Donald Trump has pledged to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/29/biden-climate-spending-trump-2024-00171593" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>redirect clean energy</u></a> funding to other priorities like roads and bridges should he win re-election. And the Heritage Foundation’s <em><em>Project 2025</em></em> (widely seen as a policy map for a second Trump term) proposes gutting key climate agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy’s Loans Program Office.</p><h3>2. Nuclear fusion company concludes giant funding round</h3>
<p>Type One Energy closed its seed funding round at $82.5 million, a testament to the hype surrounding the emerging nuclear fusion company. As <a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/type-one-fusion-seed-round" target="_self"><u>Heatmap’s Katie Brigham reports</u></a>, the company uses a reactor design known as a stellarator, which – unlike the traditional tokamak reactor – employs a twisted magnetic field to keep the plasma stabilized inside. The company’s novel technology sparked interest from major funders like Breakthrough Energy, Centaurus Capital, and New Zealand-based GD1. Type One CEO Chris Mowry called the funding round, “one of the largest, if not the largest ever, seed financings in the history of energy.”</p><h3>3. Gas flaring in Azerbaijan hits a decadal high</h3>
<p>The host of the UN COP29 climate summit flared 10.5% more methane in 2023 than it did in 2018, the last time the country reported its emissions, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/374762d3-9169-4423-8a3e-6f262491b3fb" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>according to recent analysis</u></a> by nonprofit group Global Witness. Flaring involves burning (rather than capturing) the natural gas produced as a byproduct of oil drilling, and it is responsible for over 381 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent emissions annually, according to the World Bank. Several of the facilities most at fault for the increase in flaring are owned or operated by British multinational energy company BP. </p>
<p>It’s a new black mark on Azerbaijan’s climate record, already under scrutiny by those who object to holding another climate conference in a major oil and gas-producing country.</p><h3>4. Wildfires are hurting the U.S. economy</h3>
<p>A forthcoming report by economic analysis group IMPLAN finds that wildfires could punch a nearly $90 billion hole in U.S. economic output this year. Wildfires are already displacing entire communities as they rage across much of the American West. That’s going to have an impact, says IMPLAN — potentially eliminating as many as 466,000 jobs by the end of the year. The report notes that some industries may actually benefit from the surge in wildfires. Businesses like electricity, healthcare, and (of course) fire prevention could see elevated spending as climate change increases the frequency of these destructive blazes.</p><h3>5. A new study casts doubt on forests’ ability to curb emissions</h3>
<p>Vegetation isn’t acting as the carbon sponge many had hoped it would. A new study by the French research organization Laboratory for Climate and Environmental Sciences (LCES) found that between 2022 and 2023, the growth rate of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increased 86%. That’s partly because drought in the Amazon and wildfires in Canada constrained forests’ ability to sequester carbon as they normally do. While the report’s authors noted that carbon uptake changes from year to year, these findings cast doubt on forests’ reliability as a carbon sponge in the future. “We are pumping less carbon from the atmosphere into the land,” one of the study’s authors <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/worlds-forests-failed-curb-2023-climate-emissions-study-finds-2024-07-29/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>told </u><u><em><em>Reuters</em></em></u></a>. “Suddenly the pump is choking, and it's pumping less.”</p>
<h2>THE KICKER</h2><p><em><strong><em></em></strong></em><em>“Unfortunately, meteorological events beyond our control ... can alter water quality and compel us to reschedule the event for health reasons.” </em>– A joint statement by World Triathlon and Paris 2024 blaming the weekend’s rain storms for the pollution in the Seine that caused them to postpone today’s men’s Olympic triathlon.</p>

## Type One Energy Raised $82.5 Million to Do Fusion For Real

date: 2024-07-30, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81Mjk4MjAyMC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2MzU5ODExOX0.5bfb2uYFGOtkhCNzUvaLEOm66A0DhinkbtnPUJ5SWxw/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p>The fusion world is flush in cash and hype, as the dream of near-limitless clean energy inches closer to reality. <a href="https://www.fusionindustryassociation.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2024-global-fusion-industry-report-FIA.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>A recent report</u></a> from the Fusion Industry Association found that in the last two years, companies in the industry have brought in over $2.3 billion, nearly a third of all fusion funding since 1992. </p>
<p>Today, one of those companies, Type One Energy, announced a giant, $82.5 million seed funding round, which CEO Chris Mowry told me is “one of the largest, if not the largest ever, seed financings in the history of energy.” This funding represents the total from the company’s first close in March of last year, which brought in $29 million, plus the recent close of its extension round, which brought in an additional $53.5 million. The extension was co-led by Breakthrough Energy Ventures, New Zealand-based venture capital firm GD1, and Centaurus Capital.</p><p>Mowry said the follow-on funding is necessary for the company to achieve its target of commercializing fusion by the mid-2030s. “To do this, we need to ramp this company up pretty quickly and have some pretty ambitious milestones in terms of development of the actual pilot power plant. And that takes a lot of capital,” he told me. </p>
<p>Type One uses a reactor design known as a <a href="https://www.energy.gov/science/doe-explainsstellarators#:~:text=A%20stellarator%20is%20a%20machine,a%20donut%2C%20called%20a%20torus." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>stellarator</u></a>. The concept is similar to the more familiar doughnut-shaped <a href="https://www.energy.gov/science/doe-explainstokamaks" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>tokamak reactors</u></a>, used by the deep-pocketed MIT-spinoff Commonwealth Fusion Systems and the intergovernmental fusion megaproject ITER. Both stellarators and tokamaks use high-powered magnets to confine superheated plasma, in which the fusion reaction takes place. But unlike the symmetrical magnetic field created by a tokamak, a stellarator creates a twisted magnetic field that is more adept at keeping the plasma stabilized, though historically at the expense of keeping it maximally hot. </p>
<p>Recent progress in the stellarator universe has Mowry excited, as the world’s largest stellarator, developed at the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics in Germany, has demonstrated high heating power as well as the ability to maintain a fusion plasma for a prolonged period of time. Thus, he told me this tech has “no fundamental science or engineering barriers to commercialization,” and that if the German stellarator were simply scaled up, it could likely provide sustained fusion energy for a power plant, albeit at a price point that would be totally unfeasible. Commercialization is therefore now simply an “engineering optimization challenge.”</p>
<p>The Type One team is composed of some of the world’s foremost experts on stellarator fusion, coming from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, which Mowry said “built the world’s first modern stellarator;” Oak Ridge National Laboratory; and the Institute for Plasma Physics. The company plans to use the additional funding to jumpstart its FusionDirect program, which involves building a prototype reactor in partnership with Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the Tennessee Valley Authority, the nation’s largest public utility. The timeline is aggressive — Type One is aiming to complete the prototype by the end of 2028. And while this machine will not generate fusion energy, its purpose is to validate the design concept for the company’s pilot plant, which will ideally begin putting fusion electrons on the grid by the mid-2030s.</p>
<p>Mowry’s goal is to enter into a public-private partnership by the end of the decade that will help get the company’s first-of-its-kind stellarator pilot off the ground. The government has an integral role to play in helping fusion energy reach scale, he argued, but said that as of now, it’s not doing nearly enough. Federal funding for fusion, he told me, is “on the order of a billion dollars a year.” While that might seem like a hefty sum, Mowry said only a minuscule portion is allotted to commercialization initiatives as opposed to basic research and development, a breakdown “aligned with where fusion was in the 20th century,” he told me, not where it is today. </p>
<p>If Type One’s pilot plant works as hoped, “then you’re talking about deploying the first wave of full-scale, truly commercial fusion power plants in the second half of the 2030s.” Which, when it comes to preventing catastrophic climate change, is “maybe just in time.”</p>

## UCLA ordered by judge to craft plan in support of Jewish students

date: 2024-07-30, from: VOA News USA

LOS ANGELES — A federal judge ordered Monday that the University of California, Los Angeles, craft a plan to protect Jewish students, months after pro-Palestinian protests broke out on campus.


Three Jewish students sued the university in June, alleging that they experienced discrimination on campus amid demonstrations against the Israel-Hamas war. Yitzchok Frankel, a UCLA law student who is Jewish, said in the lawsuit that he declined an invitation from the director of student life to help host a lunch gathering because he did not feel safe participating.


"Under ordinary circumstances, I would have leapt at the chance to participate in this event," Frankel said. "My Jewish identity and religion are integral to who I am, and I believe it is important to mentor incoming students and encourage them to be proud of their Judaism, too."


But Frankel argued UCLA was failing to foster a safe environment for Jewish students on campus.


UCLA spokesperson Mary Osako said the school is "committed to maintaining a safe and inclusive campus, holding those who engaged in violence accountable, and combatting antisemitism in all forms."


"We have applied lessons learned from this spring's protests and continue to work to foster a campus culture where everyone feels welcome and free from intimidation, discrimination and harassment," Osako said in a statement.


The University was ordered to craft a proposed plan by next month.


The demonstrations at UCLA became part of a movement at campuses across the country against the Israel-Hamas war. At UCLA, law enforcement ordered in May that over a thousand protesters break up their encampment as tensions rose on campus. Counter-demonstrators had attacked the encampment overnight, and at least 15 protesters suffered injuries. In June, dozens of protesters on campus were arrested after they tried to set up a new encampment.

## Chinese glass maker says it wasn't target of raid at US plant featured in Netflix film

date: 2024-07-29, from: VOA News USA

MORAINE, Ohio — A Chinese automotive glass maker says it was not the target of a federal investigation that temporarily shut down production last week at its Ohio plant, the subject of the Oscar-winning Netflix film "American Factory." 


The investigation was focused on money laundering, potential human smuggling, labor exploitation and financial crimes, Homeland Security agent Jared Murphey said Friday. 


Fuyao Glass America said authorities told it that a third-party employment company was at the center of the criminal investigation, according to a filing with the Shanghai Stock Exchange. 


Agents with the Department of Homeland Security, FBI and Internal Revenue Service, along with local authorities, carried out federal search warrants Friday at the Fuyao plant in Moraine and nearly 30 other locations in the Dayton area. 


"The company intends to cooperate fully with the investigation," Lei Shi, Fuyao Glass America community relations manager, said in a statement to the Dayton Daily News. Messages seeking comment were left with the company on Monday. 


Production was stopped temporarily Friday, but operations resumed near the end of the day, the statement said. 


Fuyao took over a shuttered General Motors factory a decade ago and eventually hired more than 2,000 workers to make glass for the automotive industry. The company, which received millions in tax breaks and incentives from the state and local governments, has said the Ohio plant was the world's largest auto glass production facility. 


In 2019, a production company backed by Barack and Michelle Obama released "American Factory." The film, which won a 2020 Oscar for best feature-length documentary, looked at issues including the rights of workers, globalization and automation. 


Workers voted overwhelmingly against unionizing in 2017 after some employees complained about unsafe workplace conditions, arbitrary policies and unfair treatment on the job. Earlier that year, Fuyao agreed to pay a $100,000 penalty after the Occupational Safety and Health Administration cited the company for alleged violations involving machine safety, electrical hazards and a lack of personal protective gear.

## Trial begins for US citizen accused of acting as Chinese agent

date: 2024-07-29, from: VOA News USA

New York — A former university professor in China went on trial on Monday in Brooklyn on charges he acted as a Chinese agent by monitoring U.S.-based activists opposed to Beijing's Communist government at the direction of intelligence officials in China.


Federal prosecutors said Shujun Wang, a naturalized U.S. citizen, exploited his leadership role in New York communities supporting democracy in China to collect information on dissidents, and shared it with four officials in China's Ministry of State Security (MSS), an intelligence service.


Wang, who emigrated to the United States in 1994, was arrested in March 2022. He pleaded not guilty to four counts including acting as a foreign agent without notifying the U.S. attorney general and lying to U.S. authorities. Prosecutors said Wang's scheme ran from 2005 to 2022. 


The U.S. Department of Justice has in recent years cracked down on what it calls "transnational repression" by U.S. adversaries such as China and Iran.


The term refers to the surveillance, intimidation and, in some cases, attempted repatriation or murder of activists against those governments.


Last year, a former New York City police sergeant was convicted of acting as an illegal Chinese agent by intimidating a U.S.-based fugitive to return to his homeland to face charges.


Wang, in his mid-70s, faces up to 25 years in prison if convicted. Jury selection began on Monday before U.S. Circuit Judge Denny Chin, who normally hears appeals, in Brooklyn federal court.


Prosecutors say MSS officials directed Wang to target Hong Kong pro-democracy activists, advocates for Taiwanese independence campaigners and Uyghur and Tibetan activists.


Defense lawyers said in a June 16 court filing that Wang communicated with Chinese officials to try to "infiltrate and subvert" China's government by spreading Western political ideas.


"Unfortunately, FBI Agents misunderstood him and his role," defense lawyer Kevin Tung wrote.


U.S. prosecutors also charged four Chinese intelligence officers who they say acted as Wang's handlers. Those officers are at large and believed to be in China.

## The Scientist Warning Against ‘Science-Based’ Targets

date: 2024-07-29, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81Mjk4MTc1My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczODIzNzIzOH0.VtMlR3XY-3cyyCN-0__-A3HWL9EvzTZNvoMfftAgngg/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">Tackling climate change is a complex puzzle. Hitting internationally agreed upon targets to limit warming requires the world to reduce multiple types of greenhouse gases from a multiplicity of sources on diverse timelines and across varying levels of responsibility and control by individual, corporate, and state actors. It’s no surprise the catchphrase “net zero by 2050” has taken off.<br/></p><p>Various initiatives have sprung up to distill this complexity for businesses and governments who want to do (or say they are doing) what the “science says” is necessary. The nonprofit Science Based Targets initiative, for example, develops standard roadmaps for companies to follow to act “in line with climate science.” The groups also vets corporate plans and deems them to either be “science based” or not. Though entirely voluntary, SBTi’s approval has become a nearly mandatory mark of credibility. The group has validated the plans of <a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/news/sbti-marks-5500-companies-with-validated-targets-announces-next-steps-in-transformation#:~:text=The%20announcement%20comes%20as%20the,services%20entity%20once%20fully%20operational." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more than 5,500 companies</u></a> with more than <a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/resources/files/SBTiMonitoringReport2023.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$46 trillion in market capitalization</u></a> — nearly half of the global economy.</p><p>But in a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-024-01535-z" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>commentary</u></a> published in the journal <em><em>Nature</em></em> last week, a group of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change experts argue that SBTi and other supposedly “science based” target-setting efforts misconstrue the science and are laden with value judgments. By striving to create straightforward, universal rules, they flatten more nuanced considerations of which emissions must be reduced, by whom and by when.</p><p>“We are arguing that those companies and countries that are best resourced, have the highest capacity to act, and have the highest responsibility for historical emissions, probably need to go a lot further than the global average,” Andy Reisinger, the lead author of the piece, told me.</p><p>In response to the paper, SBTi told me it “welcomes debate,” and that “robust debate is essential to accelerate corporate ambition and climate action.” The group is currently in the process of reviewing its Net-Zero Standard and remains “committed to refining our approaches to ensure they are effective in helping corporates to drive the urgent emissions reductions needed to combat the climate crisis.”</p><p>The commentary comes as SBTi’s reputation is already on shaky ground. In April, its board appeared to go rogue and said that the group would loosen its standards for the use of carbon offsets. The announcement was met first with surprise and later with fierce protest from the nonprofit’s staff and technical council, who had not been consulted. Environmental groups <a href="https://www.citizen.org/news/sbti-offset-change-takes-science-out-of-science-based-targets/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>accused SBTi of taking the “science” out of its targets</u></a>. The board later <a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/news/statement-from-the-sbti-board-of-trustees-on-use-of-environmental-attribute-certificates-including-but-not-limited-to-voluntary-carbon-markets-for-abatement-purposes-limited-to-scope-3" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>walked back its statement</u></a>, saying that no change had been made to the rules, yet.</p><p>But interestingly enough, the new <em><em>Nature</em></em> commentary argues that SBTi’s board was actually on the right track. I spoke to Reisinger about this, and some of the other ways he thinks science based targets “miss the mark.”</p><p>Reisinger, who’s from New Zealand, was the vice-chair of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s mega-report on climate mitigation from 2022. I caught him just as he had arrived in Sofia, Bulgaria, for a plenary that will determine the timeline for the next big batch of UN science reports. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity. </p><p><strong>Was there something in particular that inspired you to write this? Or were you just noticing the same issues over and over again? </strong></p><p>There were probably several things. One is a confusion that’s quite prevalent between net zero <em><em>CO2 emissions</em></em> and net zero <em><em>greenhouse gas emissions</em></em>. The IPCC makes clear that to limit warming at any level, you need to reach net zero CO2 emissions, because it’s a long lived greenhouse gas and the warming effect accumulates in the atmosphere over time. You need deep reductions of shorter lived greenhouse gases like methane, but they don’t necessarily have to reach zero. And yet, a lot of people claim that the IPCC tells us that we have to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, which is simply not the case. </p><p>Of course, you can claim that there’s nothing wrong, surely, with going to net zero greenhouse gas emissions because that’s more ambitious. But there’s two problems with that. One is, if you want to use science, you have to get the science correct. You can’t just make it up and still claim to be science-based. Secondly, it creates a very uneven playing field between those who mainly have CO2 emissions and those who have non-CO2 emissions as a significant part of their emissions portfolio — which often are much harder to reduce. </p><p><strong>Can you give an example of what you mean by that?</strong></p><p>You can rapidly decarbonize and actually approach close to zero emissions in your energy generation, if that’s your dominant source of emissions. There are viable solutions to generate energy with very low or no emissions — renewables, predominantly. Nuclear in some circumstances. </p><p>But to give you another example, in Australia, the Meat and Livestock Association, they set a net zero target, but they subsequently realized it’s much harder to achieve it because methane emissions from livestock are very, very difficult to reduce entirely. Of course you can say, <em><em>we’ll no longer produce beef</em></em>. But if you’re the Cattle Association, you’re not going to rapidly morph into producing a different type of meat product. And so in that case, achieving net zero is much more challenging. Of course, you can’t lean back and say, <em><em>Oh, it’s too difficult for us, therefore we shouldn’t try.</em></em> </p><p><strong>I want to walk through the three main points to your argument for why science-based targets “miss the mark.” I think we’ve just covered the first. The second is that these initiatives put everyone on the same timeline and subject them to the same rules, which you say could actually slow emissions reductions in the near term. Can you explain that?</strong></p><p>The Science Based Targets initiative in particular, but also other initiatives that provide benchmarks for companies, tend to want to limit the use of offsets, where a company finances emission reductions elsewhere and claims them to achieve their own targets. And there’s very good reasons for that, because there’s a lot of greenwashing going on. Some offsets have very low integrity. </p><p>At the same time, if you set a universal rule that all offsets are bad and unscientific, you’re making a major mistake. Offsets are a way of generating financial flows towards those with less intrinsic capacity to reduce their emissions. So by making companies focus only on their own reductions, you basically cut off financial flows that could stimulate emission reductions elsewhere or generate carbon dioxide removals. Then you’re creating a problem for later on in the future, when we desperately need more carbon dioxide removal and haven’t built up the infrastructure or the accountability systems that would allow that.</p><p><strong>As you know, there’s a lot of controversy about this right now. There are many scientists who disagree with you and don’t want the Science Based Targets initiative to loosen its rules for using offsets. Why is there this split in the scientific community about this?</strong></p><p>I think the issue arises when you think that net zero by 2050 is the unquestioned target. But if you challenge yourself to say, well net zero by 2050 might be entirely unambitious for you, you have to reduce your own emissions <em><em>and</em></em> invest in offsets to go far beyond net zero by 2050 — then you might get a different reaction to it. </p><p>I think everybody would agree that if offsets are being used instead of efforts to reduce emissions that are under a company’s direct control, and they can be reduced, then offsets are a really bad idea. And of course, low integrity offsets are always a bad idea. But the solution to the risk of low integrity cannot be to walk away from it entirely, because otherwise you’ve further reduced incentives to actually generate accountability mechanisms. So the challenge would be to drive emission reductions at the company level, and on top of that, create incentives to engage in offsets, to increase financial flows to carbon dioxide removal — both permanent and inherently non permanent — because we will need it. </p><p><strong>My understanding is that groups like SBTi and some of these other carbon market integrity initiatives agree with what you’ve just said — even if they don’t support offsetting emissions, they do support buying carbon credits to go above and beyond emissions targets. They are already advocating for that, even if they’re not necessarily creating the incentives for it.</strong></p><p>I mean, that’s certainly a move in the right direction. But it’s creating this artificial distinction between what the science tells you, the “science based target,” and then the voluntary effort beyond that. Whereas I think it has to become an obligation. So it’s not a distinction between, here’s what the science says, and here’s where your voluntary, generous, additional contribution to global efforts might go. It is a much more integrated package of actions.</p><p><strong>I think we’re starting to get at the third point that your commentary makes, which is about how these so-called science-based targets are inequitable. How does that work?</strong></p><p>There’s a rich literature on differentiating targets at the country level based on responsibility for warming, or a capacity-based approach that says, if you’re rich and we have a global problem, you have to use your wealth to help solve the global problem. Most countries don’t because the more developed you are, the more unpleasant the consequences are. </p><p>At the company level, SBTi, for example, tends to use the global or regional or sectoral average rate of reductions as the benchmark that an individual company has to follow. But not every company is average, and systems transitions follow far more complex dynamics. Some incumbents have to reduce emissions much more rapidly, or they go out of business in order to create space for innovators to come in, whose emissions might rise in the near term before they go down, but with new technologies that allow deeper reductions in the long term. Assuming a uniform rate of reduction levels out all those differences. </p><p>It’s far more challenging to translate equity into meaningful metrics at the company level. But our core argument is, just because it’s hard, that cannot mean let’s not do it. So how can we challenge companies to disclose their thinking, their justification about what is good enough? </p><p><strong>The Science Based Targets initiative formed because previously, companies </strong><em><strong><em>were</em></strong></em><strong> coming up with their own interpretations of the science, and there was no easy way to assess whether these plans were legitimate. Can you really imagine a middle ground where there is still some sort of policing mechanism to say whether a given corporate target is good enough?</strong></p><p>That’s what we try to sketch as a vision, but it certainly won’t be easy. I also want to emphasize that we’re not trying to attack SBTi in principle. It’s done a world of good. And we certainly don’t want to throw the baby out with the bathwater to just cancel the idea. It’s more to use it as a starting point. As we say in our paper, you can almost take an SBTi target as the definition of what is <em><em>not</em></em> sufficient if you’re a company located in the Global North or a multinational company with high access to resources — human, technology and financial. </p><p>It was a wild west before SBTi and we’re not saying let’s go back to the wild west. We’re saying the pendulum might have swung too far to a universal rule that applies to everybody, but therefore applies to nobody. </p><p><strong>There’s one especially scathing line in this commentary. You write that these generic rules “result in a pseudo-club that inadequately challenges its self-selected members while setting prohibitive expectations for those with less than average capacity.” We’ve already talked about the second half of this statement, but what do you mean by pseudo-club?</strong></p><p>You write a science based target as a badge of achievement, a badge of honor on your company profile, assuming that therefore you have done all that can be expected of you when it comes to climate change. Most of the companies that have adopted science based targets are located in the Global North, or operate on a multinational basis and have therefore quite similar capacity. If that’s what we’re achieving — and then there’s a large number of companies that can’t possibly, under their current capacity, set science-based targets because they simply don’t have the resources — then collectively, we will fail. Science cannot tell you whether you have done as much as you could be doing. If we let the simplistic rules dominate the conversation, then we’re not going to be as ambitious as we need to be. </p>

## Focused on legacy, Biden speaks out for rule of law, democratic principles

date: 2024-07-29, from: VOA News USA

austin, texas — No longer on the campaign trail, President Joe Biden on Monday delivered a speech at the LBJ Presidential Library designed to help cement his legacy.


Slightly more than a week after dropping out of this year's election campaign, Biden marked the 60th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act by speaking out for the rule of law and democratic principles. All the while, he warned about the threat he sees if Republican Donald Trump returns to the White House.


“No one is above the law,” Biden said.


Biden followed his denunciations of Trump with a mix of nostalgia for his early days in politics during the era of Martin Luther King Jr., John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson.


It’s a story he’s told before, about how he became a public defender and was cornered by Delaware leaders to run for the U.S. Senate. But it’s taken on a new resonance as he stares down the final six months of his political career.


“Because I got engaged like a Iot of you do ... you get engaged and you want to change things,” he said.


The setting carried a special resonance. Biden spoke at the library dedicated to Johnson, the last president who opted against seeking reelection, just as Biden did.


Supreme Court changes


Biden also used his speech to call for changes to the Supreme Court that include term limits and an enforceable ethics code for justices, as well as a constitutional amendment that would limit presidential immunity. But his proposal is unlikely to clear a Republican House, leaving Biden to take a symbolic stand for the causes to which he has devoted his time in public office.




The Texas visit took on very different symbolism in the two weeks it took to reschedule it after Biden had to cancel because he got COVID-19.


The speech, originally set for July 15, was once seen by the White House as an opportunity for Biden to try to make a case for salvaging his sinking presidential campaign — delivered in the home district of Representative Lloyd Doggett, the 15-term congressman who was the first Democratic lawmaker to publicly call for Biden to step aside.


Two weeks later, the political landscape has been reshaped. Biden is out of the race. Vice President Kamala Harris is the likely Democratic nominee. And the president is focused not on his next four years, but on the legacy of his single term and the future of democracy.


Doggett was among the group of lawmakers, civil rights advocates and others who greeted Biden after the president landed Monday in Austin. Biden and the Texas congressman shook hands and spoke briefly.


Biden called Harris in his speech an “incredible partner” who will “continue to be an inspiring leader.”


Latest exit


No American incumbent president has dropped out of the race as late in the process as did Biden. Johnson announced he would not seek reelection in March 1968, at the height of the Vietnam War.


Biden has drawn a lot of comparisons to Johnson of late. Both men spoke to the nation from the Oval Office to lay out their decisions. Both faced pressure from within their own party to step aside, and both were ultimately praised for doing so.


But their reasons were very different. Johnson stepped away in the heat of the war and spoke at length about his need to focus on the conflict. Biden, 81, had every intention of running for reelection until his shaky June 27 debate performance ignited fears within his own party about his age and mental acuity, and whether he could beat Trump.


Biden has called Trump a serious threat to democracy, particularly after the ex-president's efforts in 2020 to overturn the results of the election he lost and his continued lies about that loss. The president framed his decision to bow out of the race as motivated by the need to unite his party to protect democracy.


“I’ve decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. That’s the best way to unite our nation,” Biden said in his Oval Office address. “Nothing, nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy. And that includes personal ambition.”


During his presidency, Biden has often put equity and civil rights at the forefront, including with his choice for vice president. Harris is the first woman, Black person and person of South Asian descent to have the job. She could also become the first woman elected to the presidency.


Equity actions


Biden's administration has worked to combat racial discrimination in the real estate market. He pardoned thousands of people convicted on federal marijuana charges that have disproportionately affected people of color. His administration has provided federal funding to reconnect city neighborhoods that were racially segregated or divided by road projects, and also has invested billions in historically Black colleges and universities.




His efforts, he has said, are meant to push the country forward — and to guard against efforts to undermine the landmark legislation signed by Johnson in 1964, one of the most significant civil rights achievements in U.S. history.


The law made it illegal to discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or national origin. It was designed to end discrimination in school, work and public facilities, and it barred unequal application of voter registration requirements. 


Johnson signed the act five hours after Congress approved it, saying the nation was in a “time of testing” that “we must not fail.” He added: “Let us close the springs of racial poison. Let us pray for wise and understanding hearts. Let us lay aside irrelevant differences and make our nation whole.”


Biden has said he is “determined to get as much done” as he can in his final six months in office, including signing major legislation expanding voting rights and a federal policing bill named for George Floyd.


“I’ll keep defending our personal freedoms and our civil rights, from the right to vote to the right to choose," Biden said from the Oval Office. “I’ll keep calling out hate and extremism, make it clear there is no place, no place in America for political violence or any violence ever, period.”


Later Monday, Biden will also travel to Houston to pay his respects to the late Representative Sheila Jackson Lee, who died July 19 at age 74.

## Harris was never 'border czar,' experts say, despite Republican claims

date: 2024-07-29, from: VOA News USA

washington  — After President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential race and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to replace him as the Democratic nominee, Republicans quickly focused on Harris and her work on immigration issues, calling her a “border czar.”


Congressman Guy Reschenthaler, a Republican from Pennsylvania, said at a House Rules Committee hearing Tuesday that Biden appointed Harris as the border czar 64 days into his administration. The hearing focused on an emergency resolution addressing the "failures of the border czar position and its negative impact on our fellow citizens across the country."


“With Harris at the helm, the Biden-Harris administration made good on their promise to systematically dismantle President [Donald] Trump’s secure border [policies],” Reschenthaler said.


But was Harris appointed as border czar?


Immigration experts say no.


Theresa Cardinal Brown, senior adviser on immigration and border policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center, said that early in the Biden administration, Harris was assigned the task of reducing migration to the U.S. southern border and collaborating with Central American nations to address the root causes of migration through diplomacy, development and investment.


“She was never named a border czar. In fact, the border was not her priority issue at all. The border was the responsibility of Homeland Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. She was never in charge of the border per se,” Brown said.


Brown said "czar" is not a recognized term under the U.S. legal system.


“But it has been adopted into American political discourse as, I’d say, a shorthand title for somebody who is given within a White House administration – within the executive branch – broad responsibility and authority to direct the administration across different Cabinet departments on a particular issue or policy,” Brown said.




Border politics


During the pandemic, the Trump administration virtually closed the border to migration, as officials implemented a health order that allowed for the rapid expulsion of migrants, effectively turning away most migrants without giving them a chance to seek asylum.


When President Biden took office in January 2021, expulsions continued, except for unaccompanied minors. Both Biden and Harris openly urged migrants not to come, but they did, presenting a political crisis for Biden at the beginning of his administration.


Biden soon asked Harris to spearhead a "root causes" strategy, banking heavily on using American investments to improve living conditions and discourage migrants from leaving three Central American nations where a significant number of migrants come from: Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala.


The Biden administration also reunited families separated under the Trump administration and expanded legal immigration pathways, including increasing refugee admissions and creating a humanitarian program for migrants from Central America, Venezuela and Haiti.




Although it is not known what Harris’ immigration policy will look like, immigration attorney Hector Quiroga said he thinks Harris will continue Biden’s policies, but he noted that Harris’ immigration message has changed.


“Her record is rather interesting because in the beginning, she was very much in the diplomatic kind of way. … With experience [in the vice president office], she has said, ‘Please don’t come’ to migrants,” he said, referring to Harris’ evolution to a stricter tone and tougher message.


Quiroga is referring to Harris’ 2021 trip to Guatemala to meet with former Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei and address the root causes of illegal migration. During her visit, she emphasized the Biden administration's commitment to helping Guatemalans find "hope at home."


And she issued a stern warning to potential migrants.


“I want to be clear to folks in this region who are thinking about making that dangerous trek to the United States-Mexico border,” Harris said. “Do not come. Do not come.”


The Biden administration has been highlighting progress at the border, noting that arrests for illegal crossings from Mexico dropped by 29% in June, marking the lowest number during Joe Biden's presidency.

## US to send $1.7 billion in new military aid to Ukraine

date: 2024-07-29, from: VOA News USA

washington  — The U.S. will send $1.7 billion in military aid to Ukraine, officials announced on Monday, including an array of munitions for air defense systems, artillery, mortars and anti-tank and anti-ship missiles.


The package includes $1.5 billion in funding for long-term contracts through the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, and $200 million in immediate military aid taken from Pentagon stockpiles.


The latest infusion of weapons comes a bit more than two weeks after the NATO summit in Washington, where allies focused a significant amount of time on shoring up support for Ukraine as it fends off Russian forces. President Joe Biden announced during the summit that the U.S. would send a Patriot missile battery to Ukraine, answering a key plea from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.


NATO members agreed to create a new program to provide reliable military aid to Ukraine and prepare for its eventual membership in the alliance. And they declared Ukraine was on an “ irreversible ” path to join NATO.


In the latest package, air defense interceptors, rockets, artillery, and anti-tank weapons will be provided through presidential drawdown authority, which allows the Pentagon to pull the weapons directly from its shelves.


The air defense weapons include munitions for National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems, or NASAMS, and High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS.


The Pentagon said the longer-term contracted weapons will include “capabilities to augment” Ukraine’s air defenses, as well as other weapons.


The U.S. is also providing secure communications systems and funding for commercial satellite imagery services, as well as demolitions equipment.


In an unusual move, however, the Defense Department declined to make clear which specific systems were being sent to Ukraine quickly through the PDA and which would be funded through contracts and so wouldn't get to the warfront for months or years.


With the latest funding, the U.S. has now sent more than $55.4 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since Russia’s invasion in February 2022.


White House national security spokesman John Kirby said Monday that the package includes “key capabilities for the fight." He said this is the ninth military aid package for Ukraine since late April, when Congress finally passed supplemental funding for aid to Kyiv after months of gridlock and delays.


At that time, he said, “there were legitimate concerns that Russia would achieve a strategic breakthrough on the battlefield by the summer.” But since the funding passed Congress, “Ukraine’s defensive lines have been fortified and Ukrainian forces have continued to fight bravely and repel Russia’s advances.”

## FBI: Trump agrees to be interviewed for investigation into assassination attempt

date: 2024-07-29, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Former President Donald Trump has agreed to be interviewed by the FBI as part of an investigation into his attempted assassination in Pennsylvania earlier this month, a special agent said on Monday in disclosing how the gunman prior to the shooting had researched mass attacks and explosive devices.


The expected interview with the 2024 Republican presidential nominee is part of the FBI's standard protocol to speak with victims during the course of their criminal investigations. The FBI said on Friday that Trump was struck by a bullet or a fragment of one during the July 13 assassination attempt at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.


"We want to get his perspective on what he observed," said Kevin Rojek, the special agent in charge of the FBI's Pittsburgh field office. "It is a standard victim interview like we would do for any other victim of crime, under any other circumstances."


Through roughly 450 interviews, the FBI has fleshed out a portrait of the gunman, Thomas Matthew Crooks, that reveals him to be a "highly intelligent" but reclusive 20-year-old whose primary social circle was his family and who maintained few friends and acquaintances throughout his life, Rojek said.


The FBI has not uncovered a motive as to why he chose to target Trump, but investigators believe the shooting was the result of extensive planning, including the purchase in recent months of chemical precursors that investigators believe were used to create the explosive devices found in his car and his home and the use of a drone about 200 yards (180 meters) from the rally site in the hours before the event.


In addition, Rojek said, Crooks looked online for information about mass shootings, improvised explosive devices, power plants and the attempted assassination in May of Slovakia's populist Prime Minister Robert Fico.


The FBI has said that on July 6, the day Crooks registered to attend the Trump rally, he googled: "How far away was Oswald from Kennedy?" That's a reference to Lee Harvey Oswald, the shooter who killed President John F. Kennedy from a sniper's perch in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963.


Crooks' parents have been "extremely cooperative" with investigators, Rojek said, and the extensive planning that preceded the shooting was done online. The parents have said they had no knowledge of Crooks' plans, and investigators have no reason to doubt that, the FBI said.

## California Burns, Japan Swoons

date: 2024-07-29, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81Mjk1MDczNi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2NTM5ODYwMn0.d44FcP03SCTKfYex-0dCSr8iUO6xEsjNbWvf_uYA2xg/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p>
	For those looking forward to bidding good riddance to a hot July, I have some bad news for you: Get ready for hot August..
</p><h3>Keep sending those 🥵 emojis </h3><p>
	If you thought it couldn’t possibly get hotter than July — the month that set a new record for warmest day ever — think again. 
	<strong>Forecasters predict August will be just as extreme — and that those records won’t last long.</strong>
</p><p>
	“It is something that can't be ruled out, especially over the next week as we deal with the typical peak of summer,” Tyler Roys, senior meteorologist at AccuWeather, told me.
</p><p>
	According to Roys, the melting glaciers around the Arctic in particular have contributed to the intense heat this summer. As bright glaciers give way to darker land, the Earth absorbs more heat, trapping that energy within the atmosphere instead of bouncing it back out into space.
</p><p>
	“The more areas that are dealing with above the historical average for temperatures, the more likely you are to see the global temperature average record be set,” Roys explained. “For some areas that have seen prolonged heat this summer, especially in the West in the United States and across southeastern Europe, the heat can create a nasty feedback loop that is extremely hard to break.”
</p><p>
	In a well-timed announcement, United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres released a 
	<a href="https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/unsg_call_to_action_on_extreme_heat_for_release.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>call to action</u></a> last week for countries to respond to extreme heat by investing in low-carbon cooling systems, worker protections, and improved heat-related mortality data, beyond a focus on phasing out fossil fuels. “Climate change is delivering a hotter and more dangerous world for all of us. And we are not prepared,” the report reads.
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Looking Ahead:</strong> “Our expectation is August will be another hot month over much of the country, <strong>especially from interior California and Nevada, northward to Idaho</strong>, with temperatures potentially several degrees above historical average,” Bob Larson, senior meteorologist AccuWeather, told me. The Great Lakes region can also expect some hot weather next month.</li>
</ul><h3>California races to contain its biggest fire yet this year </h3><p>
	A wildfire that started in Northern California on Wednesday has grown into one of the largest in the state’s recent history. The Park Fire prompted evacuations in parts of Butte and Tehama county. Since then, Plumas and Shasta counties have also been affected by evacuations. 
	<strong>As of this morning, more than 360,000 acres had burned, and only 12% of the fire had been contained.</strong> Almost 5,000 personnel and 33 helicopters are currently attempting to put out the fire.
</p><p>
	Climate scientist Daniel Swain of the University of California, Los Angeles called the fire’s behavior “extraordinary” in a Thursday live briefing. In less than 24 hours, the fire had scorched through 40 to 50 miles of land. “California, until very recently, was not really at the epicenter” of wildfire activity this summer, Swain said. The Park Fire has just changed the game.
</p><p>
	Another concern is smoke traveling to other states. In Nevada, which will see minor to moderate extreme heat risk this week, the smoke might impact air quality and visibility. 
	<strong>On the other hand, the smoke could also lower temperatures by blocking sunlight</strong>. Las Vegas could hit up to 110 degrees on Thursday and Friday — which, while scorching, is still lower than recent temperatures in the city.
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Looking Ahead: </strong>California will continue to be at high risk for dangerous wildfires. “With temperatures expected to continue to run above historical averages, and rainfall below historical averages the rest of the summer, the fire season can last into the start of autumn,” Larson told me. But the Northwest, which has also dealt with its fair share of wildfires this summer, might have moved past some of the worst. </li>
</ul><h3>Heat to move to the Midwest, also affecting parts of the Southeast </h3><p>
	Those in the Midwest and eastern Southwest can prepare for an especially sweaty week. 
	<strong>Oklahoma, New Mexico, and northern Texas can expect the worst of it</strong> until Wednesday, when the heat will move east into Mississippi. Kansas could see temperatures ranging from 100 to 109 degrees on Wednesday, according to Brian Berg, a meteorologist in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Kansas office meteorologist. Wichita could come close to breaking its record of 109 degrees, set in 1934.
</p><p>
	On Friday, the heat will be concentrated in the Southeast, but the heat risk will also go back to increasing in the Pacific Northwest.

	Cities across Japan can expect temperatures above 100 degrees to persist this week.

## Thoughts on politics and communities

date: 2024-07-29, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>Kev has written about the topic of <a href="https://kevquirk.com/blog/politics-and-communities">politics and communities</a> on his blog and it was related to his recently announced <a href="https://kevquirk.com/blog/introducing-500-social">500.social</a> project. In his post, he mentioned blog posts written by <a href="https://baty.net">Jack</a> and <a href="https://nice-marmot.net">Dave</a>. If you’re interested in the full discussion go read the various blog posts, they’re all relatively short.</p>
<p>I’m not interested in commenting on the opinions expressed in those blog posts but I am interested in the source of the discussion, and that was a bullet list item in the 500.social <a href="https://about.500.social/#expectations">“Member expectations” section</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Posts about politics and religion should be avoided, if you strongly feel the urge to post about these topics, please put them behind a Content Warning Member expectations</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Years ago, during the COVID era, the 37signals company got into hot water online because they announced in an internal communication that they were going to ban “societal and political discussions” on their internal work chat. <a href="https://world.hey.com/jason/changes-at-basecamp-7f32afc5">The announcement is online</a> if you’re interested in reading it.</p>
<p>People online reacted in all sorts of ways to that news and many, many opinion pieces got published. I remember talking about it with a few people privately and had some interesting conversations around that topic. As you can see, years later, positions on topics such as politics and religion are still controversial in the context of online spaces.</p>
<p>Personally, I think the issue is not with politics, religion or any other topic. The problem is a mixture of expectations and the tools we use. In his post, Dave wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If there is a "public square" anymore, where we ought to be able to try to hash those things out, it seems to me that it's in those "small social networks," unless they're intended to be bespoke bubbles where it's all just happy talk and we never have difficult conversations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t disagree that small communities are the space where those conversations can happen which is why I think no topic should be banned or be off limits. At the same time though, I do think that having conversations means something very different than posting a reactionary tweet to comment on a piece of news. That’s why people like Kev end up with rules against politics and religion. Because if you dig deeper, people don’t want to have a conversation on social media. They want to vent.</p>
<p>I think social media platforms, like Mastodon, are not designed to have conversations. You can have them on there, sure, but the experience is going to be sub-par. Social media is designed to be reactionary and generating reactions is different than having a conversation. What would Mastodon look like if everyone was forced to post at least 500 words? What would Mastodon look like if you could only post once an hour? The reason why some people, like Kev, end up with rules like that is because social media is an imperfect tool. I don’t have a no politics rule attached to my email address. People can write to me and talk about whatever they want. If they write about something I don’t care about I can simply ignore that topic and don’t engage in conversation which is exactly what happens in real life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What prompted me to consider joining 500.social was recalling the feeling I had when we learned that Biden had dropped out of the race. That's the sort of event that evokes an immediate, emotional response because of its significance to a broad range of people, presumably my "community."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the perfect example of why I think social media is a flawed tool. Can you imagine doing the same in the phone era? Can you imagine reading a piece of news and start calling hundreds, potentially thousands of people simply to share what you think about some news? And can you imagine doing that with people who don’t even live in your country and couldn’t care less about that specific news? Now can you imagine if everyone was doing the same for the news that evoked a strong reaction to them? You’d quickly put your phone on airplane mode because there are only so many random opinions on news you can bear to listen to. I can have a 3 hours discussion about politics, I can’t listen 3 hours of soundbites.</p>
<p>The problem with social media and politics is that way too many people are interested in sharing what they think on social media but very few are interested in having actual, real discussions. Because blasting out a tweet takes 10 seconds while having an actual conversation might take hours and span days.</p>
<p>I’d love to know what you think about this whole situation though. Do you think some topics should be banned on social platforms? If you have opinions get in touch or even better write a blog post!</p>                <hr>
                <p>Thank you for keeping RSS alive. You're awesome.</p>

## Gaining Steam: Far-Right Radicalisation on Gaming Platforms

How do you police voice communication across disparate games? But there's more to it than that:</p><blockquote><p>"In terms of the material and content available on these gaming platforms, there is evidence of far-right propaganda available in huge amounts.

## Microsoft’s CrowdStrike post-mortem

date: 2024-07-29, from: OS News

Microsoft has published a post-mortem of the CrowdStrike incident, and goes into great depths to describe where, exactly, the error lies, and how it could lead to such massive problems. I can&#8217;t comment anything insightful on the technical details and code they show to illustrate all of this &#8211; I&#8217;ll leave that discussion up to you &#8211; but Microsoft also spends considerable amount of time explaining why security vendors are choosing to use kernel-mode drivers. Microsoft lists three major reasons why security vendors opt for using kernel modules, and none of them will come as a great surprise to OSNews readers: kernel drivers provide more visibility into the system than a userspace tool would, there are performance benefits, and they&#8217;re more resistant to tampering. The downsides are legion, too, of course, as any crash or similar issue in kernel mode has far-reaching consequences. The goal, then, according to Microsoft, is to balance the need for greater insight, performance, and tamper resistance with stability. And while the company doesn&#8217;t say it directly, this is clearly where CrowdStrike failed &#8211; and failed hard. While you would want a security tool like CrowdStrike to perform as little as possible in kernelspace, and conversely as much as possible in userspace, that&#8217;s not what CrowdStrike did. They are running a lot of stuff in kernelspace that really shouldn&#8217;t be there, such as the update mechanism and related tools. In total, CrowdStrike loads four kernel drivers, and much of their functionality can be run in userspace instead. It is possible today for security tools to balance security and reliability. For example, security vendors can use minimal sensors that run in kernel mode for data collection and enforcement limiting exposure to availability issues. The remainder of the key product functionality includes managing updates, parsing content, and other operations can occur isolated within user mode where recoverability is possible. This demonstrates the best practice of minimizing kernel usage while still maintaining a robust security posture and strong visibility. Windows provides several user mode protection approaches for anti-tampering, like Virtualization-based security (VBS) Enclaves and Protected Processes that vendors can use to protect their key security processes. Windows also provides ETW events and user-mode interfaces like Antimalware Scan Interface for event visibility. These robust mechanisms can be used to reduce the amount of kernel code needed to create a security solution, which balances security and robustness. ↫ David Weston, Vice President, Enterprise and OS Security at Microsoft In what is surely an unprecedented event, I agree with the CrowdStrike criticism bubbling under the surface of this post-mortem by Microsoft. Everything seems to point towards CrowdStrike stuffing way more things in kernelspace than is needed, and as such creating a far larger surface for things to go catastrophically wrong than needed. While Microsoft obviously isn&#8217;t going to openly and publicly throw CrowdStrike under the bus, it&#8217;s very clear what they&#8217;re hinting at here, and this is about as close to a public flogging we&#8217;re going to get. Microsoft&#8217;s post-portem further details a ton of work Microsoft has recently done, is doing, and will soon be doing to further strenghthen Windows&#8217; security, to lessen the need for kernelspace security drivers even more, including adding support for Rust to the Windows kernel, which should also aid in mitigating some common problems present in other, older programming languages (while not being a silver bullet either, of course).

Case in point: extreme heat this summer provided the Park Fire with lots of dry vegetation to consume.

2. Crux’s mid-year report projects growth in transferable tax credit market</h3><p>
	When the Inflation Reduction Act made clean energy tax credits transferable, it set the conditions for a whole new market for those who earn the tax credits (clean energy developers and investors) and those who want them (anyone who wants relief from a large tax bill). In its mid-year market intelligence report, Crux, one of the leading platforms for tax credit transfers, projected that 2024 would see $20 billion to $25 billion such transactions in total, up from $7 billion to $9 billion last year.
</p><p>
	Before the IRA, clean energy tax credits were restricted to the companies that earned them. That limited their usefulness, as some developers and investors didn’t pay enough taxes to claim the full benefit. Transferability has drawn a wider range of participants into the market,

And expect much more in the years to come — investment bank Evercore is projecting that the market for tax credit trading could hit $100 billion by 2030.
</p><h3>3. A novel housing solution at the Paris Olympics</h3><p>
	The surfing competition at the 2024 Paris Olympics has been dogged by concerns over its impact on the environment and the local population of Tahiti, a French overseas territory known for its pristine beaches and vibrant coral reefs. Plans to construct new housing and a large observational tower aroused opposition, with locals voicing concern over how the new developments would disrupt the marine and terrestrial ecosystems.
</p><p>
	The competition is now underway, though with a

Nearly 100% of on-land housing needs will be met by renting out existing structures, and the observational tower has been scaled down. And the athletes? They aresleeping on a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/olympic-2024-surfing-tahiti-paris-eca78c9f68cf4269cdedcca25c42b98f?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--IMj1k3BLlmn0YnfiQgkuzF47JewZyNicxu1sr6MYPaGGMSJBu0Eq4AJp_Jvwfj_VVxpVG" target="_blank">413-foot cruise ship</a> anchored off the shore of the island. The changes have quieted some criticism, but concerns remain over the impact of the tower. As for the cruise ship solution, said French Polynesian President Moetai Brotherson, “It’s unusual, but they seem to like it.”

</p><h3>4. Yellen urges clean energy investment</h3><p>
	United States Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen flew to Brazil this weekend for a meeting of G20 finance ministers. On Saturday, she <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2504?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--IMj1k3BLlmn0YnfiQgkuzF47JewZyNicxu1sr6MYPaGGMSJBu0Eq4AJp_Jvwfj_VVxpVG" target="_blank">delivered a speech</a> touting a <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2496?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--IMj1k3BLlmn0YnfiQgkuzF47JewZyNicxu1sr6MYPaGGMSJBu0Eq4AJp_Jvwfj_VVxpVG" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new partnership</a> with the Brazilian Ministry of Finance to combat climate change and urging more global cooperation. The transition to a low-carbon economy is, she said, “the single greatest economic opportunity of the twenty-first century.” Yellen urged G20 leaders to invest in this transition, to the tune of $3 trillion in new capital — annually — between now and 2050.
</p><p>
	The Department of the Treasury has been central to the Biden-Harris administration’s climate strategy, providing key guidance on the many tax provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act. In Brazil, Yellen encouraged her counterparts to “harness the power of markets” to speed up the energy transition.
</p><h3>5. Another data point on congestion pricing</h3><p>
			A year ago, London Mayor Sadiq Khan expanded the Ultra Low Emission Zone, a bounded area that uses fees to strictly limit vehicle traffic, to the entire city. <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/2024-07/London-wide%20ULEZ%20Six%20Month%20Report.pdf?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--IMj1k3BLlmn0YnfiQgkuzF47JewZyNicxu1sr6MYPaGGMSJBu0Eq4AJp_Jvwfj_VVxpVG" target="_blank">According to newly released data</a>, air pollutants like nitrogen oxide and particulate matter dropped dramatically in the six months that followed. Khan <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/26/climate/congestion-pricing-ulez-london-pollution.html?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--IMj1k3BLlmn0YnfiQgkuzF47JewZyNicxu1sr6MYPaGGMSJBu0Eq4AJp_Jvwfj_VVxpVG" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said the decision</a> to expand the zone was “a difficult one, but the right one.” It’s a new piece of evidence about the effectiveness of congestion pricing, less than two months after New York Governor Hochul <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/kathy-hochul-nyc-congestion-pricing?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--IMj1k3BLlmn0YnfiQgkuzF47JewZyNicxu1sr6MYPaGGMSJBu0Eq4AJp_Jvwfj_VVxpVG" rel="noopener" target="_self">paused a similar policy</a> in New York City.</p><h2>THE KICKER</h2><p>
<em>“We will be creating so much electricity that you’ll be saying, ‘Please, please, President, we don’t want any more electricity. We can’t stand it.’ You’ll be begging me, ‘No more electricity, sir. We have enough. We have enough.’”</em> — Donald Trump, in a keynote speech at the 2024 Bitcoin Conference, perhaps obliquely referring to the need for new energy transmission and storage infrastructure.</p>

## China rebukes US, Japan for 'false accusations' on maritime issues, military expansion

date: 2024-07-29, from: VOA News USA

BEIJING — Joint statements between the United States and Japan "falsely accuse" China on maritime issues and point fingers at its normal military development and defense policy, China's foreign ministry said on Monday.


The ministry's comment followed the U.S. and Japan's criticism of what they called Beijing's "provocative" behavior in the South and East China Seas, joint military exercises with Russia and the rapid expansion of its nuclear weapons arsenal.


U.S. and Japan leaders on Sunday unveiled a new military structure that would be implemented in parallel with Tokyo's own plans to establish a joint command for its forces by March 2025.


It would be among several measures taken to address what the countries said was an "evolving security environment," noting various threats from China.


"They maliciously attacked and discredited China on maritime issues and made irresponsible remarks on China's normal military development and national defense policy," said Lin Jian, a spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry during a regular press briefing."


"China is strongly dissatisfied with the exaggeration of China's threat and the malicious speculation of regional tensions," Lin added.


The U.S. in annual reports on China's military has called out the world's second-largest economy for rapidly growing its military arsenal and nuclear warheads.


"China has always followed the path of peaceful development, firmly pursued a national defense policy that is defensive in nature, and its national defense construction and military activities are legitimate and reasonable," Lin said.


He added that China "has always maintained its nuclear capabilities at the minimum level required for national security and does not pose a threat to any country."


"We strongly urge the United States and Japan to immediately stop interfering with China's internal affairs and stop creating imaginary enemies," Lin said.

## Arab American leaders listen as Harris tries to shore up swing-state support

date: 2024-07-29, from: VOA News USA

DEARBORN, Mich — Osama Siblani's phone won't stop ringing.


Just days after President Joe Biden withdrew his bid for reelection and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for the Democratic presidential nomination, top officials from both major political parties have been asking the publisher of the Dearborn-based Arab American News if Harris can regain the support of the nation's largest Muslim population located in metro Detroit.


His response: "We are in listening mode."


Harris, who is moving to seize the Democratic nomination after Biden stepped down, appears to be pivoting quickly to the task of convincing Arab American voters in Michigan, a state Democrats believe she can't afford to lose in November, that she is a leader they can unite behind.


Community leaders have expressed a willingness to listen, and some have had initial conversations with Harris' team. Many had grown exacerbated with Biden after they felt months of outreach had not yielded many results.


"The door is cracked open since Biden has stepped down," said Dearborn Mayor Abdullah Hammoud. "There's an opportunity for the Democratic nominee to coalesce the coalition that ushered in Biden's presidency four years ago. But that responsibility will now fall on the vice president."


Arab American leaders such as Hammoud and Siblani are watching closely for signals that Harris will be more vocal in pressing for a ceasefire. They're excited by her candidacy but want to be sure she will be an advocate for peace and not an unequivocal supporter of Israel.


But Harris will need to walk a fine line not to publicly break with Biden's position on the war in Gaza, where officials in his administration have been working diligently toward a ceasefire, mostly behind the scenes.


The divide within Harris' own party was evident in Washington last week during Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's visit to address Congress. Some Democrats supported the visit, while others protested and refused to attend. Outside the Capitol, pro-Palestinian protesters were met with pepper spray and arrests.


Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib, the only Palestinian American in Congress whose district includes Dearborn, held up a sign that read "war criminal" during Netanyahu's remarks.


Harris did not attend.


Some Arab American leaders interpret her absence — she instead attended a campaign event in Indianapolis — as a sign of good faith with them, though they recognize her ongoing responsibilities as vice president, including a meeting Thursday with Netanyahu.


Her first test within the community will come when Harris chooses a running mate. One of the names on her short list, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, has been public in his criticism of pro-Palestinian protesters and is Jewish. Some Arab American leaders in Michigan say putting him on the ticket would ramp up their unease about the level of support they could expect from a Harris administration.


"Josh Shapiro was one of the first ones to criticize the students on campus. So it doesn't differentiate Harris very much if she picks him. That just says I'm going to continue the same policies as Biden," said Rima Meroueh, director of the National Network for Arab American Communities.


Arab Americans are betting that their vote holds enough electoral significance in pivotal swing states like Michigan to ensure that officials will listen to them. Michigan has the largest concentration of Arab Americans in the nation, and the state's majority-Muslim cities overwhelmingly supported Biden in 2020. He won Dearborn, for example, by a roughly 3-to-1 margin over former President Donald Trump.


In February, over 100,000 Michigan Democratic primary voters chose "uncommitted," securing two delegates to protest the Biden administration's unequivocal support for Israel's response to the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas. Nationally, "uncommitted" garnered a total of 36 delegates in the primaries earlier this year.


The groups leading this effort have called for — at a minimum — an embargo on all weapons shipments to Israel and a permanent ceasefire.


"If Harris called for an arms embargo, I would work around the clock every day until the election to get her elected," said Abbas Alawieh, an "uncommitted" Michigan delegate and national leader of the movement. "There's a real opportunity right now to unite the coalition. It's on her to deliver, but we are cautiously optimistic."


Those divisions were on full display Wednesday night when the Michigan Democratic Party brought together over 100 delegates to pitch them on uniting behind Harris. During the meeting, Alawieh, one of three state delegates who did not commit to Harris, was speaking when another delegate interrupted him by unmuting and telling him to "shut up," using an expletive, according to Alawieh.


The call could be a preview of tensions expected to surface again in August, when Democratic leaders, lawmakers, and delegates convene in Chicago for the party's national convention. Mass protests are planned, and the "uncommitted" movement intends to ensure their voices are heard within the United Center, where the convention will be held.


Trump and his campaign, meanwhile, are keenly aware of the turmoil within the Democratic base and are actively seeking the support of Arab American voters. That effort has been complicated by Trump's history of anti-immigrant rhetoric and policy during his one term as president.


A meeting between over a dozen Arab American leaders from across the country and several of Trump's surrogates was convened in Dearborn last week. Among the surrogates was Massad Boulos, a Lebanese-born businessman whose son married Tiffany Trump, the former president's younger daughter, two years ago. Boulos is leveraging his connections to rally support for Trump.


Part of the pitch that Boulos and Bishara Bahbah, chairman of Arab Americans for Trump, made in Dearborn was that Trump has shown an openness to a two-state solution. He posted a letter on social media from Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and pledged to work for peace in the Middle East.


"The three main points that were noted in the meeting were that Trump needs to state more clearly that he wants an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and that he supports the two-state solution, and that there is no such thing as a Muslim ban," said Bahbah. "This is what the community wants to hear in a clear manner."


Before a July 20 rally in Michigan, Trump also met with Bahbah, who pressed him about a two-state solution. According to Bahbah, Trump responded affirmatively, saying, "100%."


But any apparent political opportunity for Trump may be limited by criticism from many Arab Americans about the former president's ban on immigration from several majority Muslim countries and remarks they felt were insulting.


"I have not heard any individuals saying I'm now rushing to Donald Trump," said Hammoud, Dearborn's Democratic mayor. "I have yet to hear that in any of the conversations I've had. They all know what Donald Trump represents."


Siblani, who organized Wednesday's meeting with Trump surrogates, has spent months serving as an intermediary between his community and officials from all political parties and foreign dignitaries. Privately, he says, almost all express the need for a permanent ceasefire.


"Everybody wants our votes, but nobody wants to be seen as aligning with us publicly," Siblani said.

## Apache Christ icon controversy sparks debate over Indigenous Catholic faith practices

date: 2024-07-29, from: VOA News USA

MESCALERO, New Mexico — Anne Marie Brillante never imagined she would have to choose between being Apache and being Catholic.


To her, and many others in the Mescalero Apache tribe in New Mexico who are members of St. Joseph Apache Mission, their Indigenous culture had always been intertwined with faith. Both are sacred.


"Hearing we had to choose, that was a shock," said a tearful Brillante, a member of the mission's parish council.


The focus of this tense, unresolved episode is the 8-foot Apache Christ painting. For this close-knit community, it is a revered icon created by Franciscan friar Robert Lentz in 1989. It depicts Christ as a Mescalero medicine man and has hung behind the church's altar for 35 years under a crucifix as a reminder of the holy union of their culture and faith.


On June 26, the church's then-priest, Peter Chudy Sixtus Simeon-Aguinam, removed the icon and a smaller painting depicting a sacred Indigenous dancer. Also taken were ceramic chalices and baskets given by the Pueblo community for use during the Eucharist.


Brillante said the priest took them away while the region was reeling from wildfires that claimed two lives and burned more than 1,000 homes.


The Diocese of Las Cruces, which oversees the mission, did not respond to several emails, phone calls and an in-person visit by The Associated Press.


Parishioners, shocked to see the blank wall behind the altar when they arrived for Catechism class, initially believed the art objects had been stolen. But Brillante was informed by a diocesan official that the icon's removal occurred under the authority of Bishop Peter Baldacchino and in the presence of a diocesan risk manager.


The diocese has returned the icons and other objects after the community's outrage was covered by various media outlets, and the bishop replaced Simeon-Aguinam with another priest. But Brillante and others say it's insufficient to heal the spiritual abuse they have endured.


Brillante said their former priest opened old wounds with his recent actions, suggesting he sought to cleanse them of their "pagan" ways, and it has derailed the reconciliation process initiated by Pope Francis in 2022. That year, Francis gave a historic apology for the Catholic Church's role in Indigenous residential schools, forcing Native people to assimilate into Christian society, destroying their cultures and separating families.


A spokesperson for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops declined comment on the Mescalero case. But last month, the conference overwhelmingly approved a pastoral framework for Indigenous ministry, which pointed to a "false choice" many Indigenous Catholics are faced with — to be Indigenous or Catholic:


"We assure you, as the Catholic bishops of the United States, that you do not have to be one or the other. You are both."




Several of the mission's former priests understood this, but Brillante believes Simeon-Aguinam's recent demand to make that "false choice" violated the bishops' new guidelines.


Larry Gosselin, a Franciscan who served St. Joseph from 1984 to 1996 and again from 2001 to 2003, said he sought the approval of 15 Mescalero leaders before Lentz began the painting that took three months to complete.


"He poured all of himself into that painting," said Gosselin, explaining that Lentz sprinkled gold dust on himself and skipped showering, using his body oils to adhere the gold to the canvas. Then he gave the painting to the humble church.


Albert Braun, the priest who helped construct the church building in the 1920s, respected Mescalero Apache traditions in his ministry and was so beloved that he is buried inside the church, near the altar.


Church elders Glenda and Larry Brusuelas said to right this wrong and to repair this damage, the bishop must issue a public apology.


"You don't call or send a letter," Larry Brusuelas said. "You face the people you have offended and offer some guarantee that this is not going to happen again. That's the Apache way."




While Bishop Baldacchino held a two-hour meeting with the parish council in Mescalero after the items were returned, Brillante said he seemed more concerned about the icon being "hastily" reinstalled rather than acknowledging the harm or offering an apology.


Still, some are hopeful. Parish council member Pamela Cordova said she views the bishop appointing a new priest who was more familiar with the Apache community as a positive step.


"We need to give the bishop a chance to prove himself and let us know he is sincere and wants to make things right," she said.


The concept of "inculturation," the notion of people expressing their faith through their culture, has been encouraged by the Catholic Church since the Second Vatican Council in the early 1960s, said Chris Vecsey, professor of religion and Native American studies at Colgate University in Hamilton, New York.


"It's rather shocking to see a priest who has been assigned a parish with Native people acting in such a disrespectful way in 2024," he said. "But it does reflect a long history of concern that blending these symbols might weaken, threaten or pollute the purity of the faith."


Deacon Steven Morello, the Archdiocese of Detroit's missionary to the American Indians, said the goal of the U.S. bishops' new framework is to correct the ills of the past. He said Indigenous spirituality and Catholic faith have much in common, such as the burning of sage in Native American ceremonies and incense in a Catholic church.


"Both are meant to cleanse the heart and mind of all distractions," he said. "The smoke goes up to God."


Morello said Pope Francis' encyclical on caring for the Earth and the environment titled "Laudato Si" addresses the sacredness of all creation — a core principle Indigenous people have lived by for millennia.


"There is no conflict, only commonality, between Indigenous and Catholic spirituality," he said.


There are over 340 Native American parishes in the United States and many use Indigenous symbols and sacred objects in church. In every corner of the Mescalero church, Apache motifs seamlessly blend in with Catholic imagery.


The Apache Christ painting hangs as the focal point of the century-old Romanesque church whose rock walls soar as high as 90 feet. Artwork of teepees adorns the lectern. A mural at the altar shows the Last Supper with Christ and his apostles depicted as Apache men. Tall crowns worn by mountain dancers known as "gahe" in Apache, hang over small paintings showing Christ's crucifixion and resurrection.


For parishioner Sarah Kazhe, the Apache Christ painting conveys how Jesus appears to the people of Mescalero.


"Jesus meets you where you are and he appears to us in a way we understand," she said. "Living my Apache way of life is no different than attending church. ... The mindless, thoughtless act of removing a sacred icon sent a message that we didn't matter."


Parishioners believe the Creator in Apache lore is the same as their Christian God. On a recent Saturday night, community members gathered to bless two girls who had come of age. Kazhe and Donalyn Torres, one of the church elders who authorized Lentz to paint the Apache Christ, sat in lawn chairs with more than 100 others, watching crown dancers bring blessings on them.


Under a half-moon, the men wore body paint and tall crowns, dancing to drumbeats and song around a large fire. The women, including the two girls donning buckskin and jewelry, formed the outer circle, moving their feet in a quick, shuffling motion.


In the morning, many from the group attended Mass at their church, the Apache Christ restored to its place of honor.


The painting shows Christ as a Mescalero holy man, standing on the sacred Sierra Blanca, greeting the sun. A sun symbol is painted on his left palm; he holds a deer hoof rattle in his right hand. The inscription at the bottom is Apache for "giver of life," one of their names for the Creator. Greek letters in the upper corners are abbreviations for "Jesus Christ."


Gosselin, the mission's former priest, said he was struck by the level of detail Lentz captured in that painting, particularly the eyes — which focus on a distance just as Apache people would when talking about spirituality. He believes the painting was "divinely inspired" because the people who received it feel a holy connection.


"This has resonated in the spirit and their hearts," he said. "Now, 35 years later, the Apache people are fighting for it."

## Manipulated video shared by Musk mimics Harris' voice, raising concerns about AI in politics

date: 2024-07-29, from: VOA News USA

New York — A manipulated video that mimics the voice of Vice President Kamala Harris saying things she did not say is raising concerns about the power of artificial intelligence to mislead with Election Day about three months away.


The video gained attention after tech billionaire Elon Musk shared it on his social media platform X on Friday evening without explicitly noting it was originally released as parody.


The video uses many of the same visuals as a real ad that Harris, the likely Democratic president nominee, released last week launching her campaign. But the video swaps out the voice-over audio with another voice that convincingly impersonates Harris.


"I, Kamala Harris, am your Democrat candidate for president because Joe Biden finally exposed his senility at the debate," the voice says in the video. It claims Harris is a "diversity hire" because she is a woman and a person of color, and it says she doesn't know "the first thing about running the country." The video retains "Harris for President" branding. It also adds in some authentic past clips of Harris.


Mia Ehrenberg, a Harris campaign spokesperson, said in an email to The Associated Press: "We believe the American people want the real freedom, opportunity and security Vice President Harris is offering; not the fake, manipulated lies of Elon Musk and Donald Trump."


The widely shared video is an example of how lifelike AI-generated images, videos or audio clips have been utilized both to poke fun and to mislead about politics as the United States draws closer to the presidential election. It exposes how, as high-quality AI tools have become far more accessible, there remains a lack of significant federal action so far to regulate their use, leaving rules guiding AI in politics largely to states and social media platforms.


The video also raises questions about how to best handle content that blurs the lines of what is considered an appropriate use of AI, particularly if it falls into the category of satire.


The original user who posted the video, a YouTuber known as Mr Reagan, has disclosed both on YouTube and on X that the manipulated video is a parody. But Musk's post, which has been viewed more than 123 million times, according to the platform, only includes the caption "This is amazing" with a laughing emoji.


X users who are familiar with the platform may know to click through Musk's post to the original user's post, where the disclosure is visible. Musk's caption does not direct them to do so.


While some participants in X's "community note" feature to add context to posts have suggested labeling Musk's post, no such label had been added to it as of Sunday afternoon. Some users online questioned whether his post might violate X's policies, which say users "may not share synthetic, manipulated, or out-of-context media that may deceive or confuse people and lead to harm."


The policy has an exception for memes and satire as long as they do not cause "significant confusion about the authenticity of the media."


Musk endorsed former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, earlier this month. Neither Mr Reagan nor Musk immediately responded to emailed requests for comment Sunday.


Two experts who specialize in AI-generated media reviewed the fake ad's audio and confirmed that much of it was generated using AI technology.


One of them, University of California, Berkeley, digital forensics expert Hany Farid, said the video shows the power of generative AI and deepfakes.


"The AI-generated voice is very good," he said in an email. "Even though most people won't believe it is VP Harris' voice, the video is that much more powerful when the words are in her voice."


He said generative AI companies that make voice-cloning tools and other AI tools available to the public should do better to ensure their services are not used in ways that could harm people or democracy.


Rob Weissman, co-president of the advocacy group Public Citizen, disagreed with Farid, saying he thought many people would be fooled by the video.


"I don't think that's obviously a joke," Weissman said in an interview. "I'm certain that most people looking at it don't assume it's a joke. The quality isn't great, but it's good enough. And precisely because it feeds into preexisting themes that have circulated around her, most people will believe it to be real."


Weissman, whose organization has advocated for Congress, federal agencies and states to regulate generative AI, said the video is "the kind of thing that we've been warning about."


Other generative AI deepfakes in both the U.S. and elsewhere would have tried to influence voters with misinformation, humor or both.


In Slovakia in 2023, fake audio clips impersonated a candidate discussing plans to rig an election and raise the price of beer days before the vote. In Louisiana in 2022, a political action committee's satirical ad superimposed a Louisiana mayoral candidate's face onto an actor portraying him as an underachieving high school student.


Congress has yet to pass legislation on AI in politics, and federal agencies have only taken limited steps, leaving most existing U.S. regulation to the states. More than one-third of states have created their own laws regulating the use of AI in campaigns and elections, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.


Beyond X, other social media companies also have created policies regarding synthetic and manipulated media shared on their platforms. Users on the video platform YouTube, for example, must reveal whether they have used generative artificial intelligence to create videos or face suspension.

## Frank Stewart photos captured culture of jazz, church and Black life in US

date: 2024-07-29, from: VOA News USA

CHADDS FORD, Pa.  — At first glance, it looks like an aerial photo of a cemetery destroyed by war, with charred coffins ripped from broken concrete vaults and arched marble tombstones flattened by a bomb blast.


Then, the viewer begin to discern details: the coffins and vaults are actually parts of a keyboard. Instead of names and dates, the apparent tombstones are inscribed with words like "vibrato" and "third harmonic."


"It looks like a graveyard," photographer Frank Stewart said.


Stewart's ghostly photograph of a New Orleans church organ ravaged by the floodwaters of Hurricane Katrina is part of a career retrospective of his decades documenting Black life in America and exploring African and Caribbean cultures.




"Frank Stewart's Nexus: An American Photographer's Journey, 1960s to the Present," is on display at the Brandywine Museum of Art through Sept. 22. Brandywine is the fourth and final stop for the exhibition, which was organized by The Phillips Collection in Washington, D.C., and the Telfair Museums in Savannah, Georgia.


"I wanted to talk about the Black church and what influence they had on the culture," Stewart said of his post-Katrina work in New Orleans. "This organ, the music and everything corresponds. It all comes together. I just wanted to show the devastation of churches and the music and the culture."


Music is elemental to Stewart's practice. He was the long-time photographer for the Savannah Music Festival, and for 30 years he was the senior staff photographer for Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra, which paired him with artistic director and Grammy-winning musician Wynton Marsalis.


"He's like my brother," said Stewart, whose exhibition includes "Stomping the Blues," a 1997 photograph of Marsalis leading his orchestra off the stage during a world tour of his Pulitzer Prize-winning jazz oratorio "Blood on the Fields."




Stewart, who was born in Nashville, Tennessee, and grew up in Memphis, Tennessee, and Chicago, has his own ties to jazz and blues. His stepfather, Phineas Newborn Jr., was a pianist who worked with the likes of musicians Lionel Hampton, Charles Mingus and B.B. King.


Describing himself as a child of the "apartheid South," Stewart has drawn inspiration from photographers such as Ernest Cole and Roy DeCarava, who was among Stewart's instructors at New York's Cooper Union, where Stewart received a bachelor of fine arts degree. DeCarava's photographs of 1950s Harlem led to a collaboration with Langston Hughes on the 1955 book, "The Sweet Flypaper of Life."


Cole, a South African photographer, achieved acclaim in 1967 with "House of Bondage," the first book to inspire Stewart. It chronicled apartheid using photographs he smuggled out of the country. Cole was never able to replicate his early success and fell on hard times before dying at age 49 in New York City. A documentary about him, "Ernest Cole: Lost and Found," premiered at this year's Cannes Film Festival.


"He came to New York and he was homeless in New York, so I would see him on the street and we would talk," said Stewart, who is quick to draw a distinction between his work and Cole's.


"I consider myself an artist more than a documentarian," explained Stewart, who attended the School of the Art Institute of Chicago before enrolling at Cooper Union and was a longtime friend and collaborator of artist Romare Bearden.


That's not to say Stewart doesn't have journalistic instincts in his blood. He recounts a work history that includes the Chicago Defender, the largest Black-owned daily in the country at the time, and stringing for Ebony, Essence and Black Enterprise magazines. He looks back less fondly on a short stint of large-format work photographing fine art for brochures and catalogs, an undertaking he described as "tedious."


Through it all though, Stewart has maintained an artistic approach to his work, looking to combine pattern, color, tone and space in a visually appealing manner while not leaving the viewer searching for the message.


"It has to still be 'X marks the spot,'" he explained. "It still has to be photographic. It can't be just abstract."


Or maybe it can. How else to explain the color and texture seen in "Blue Car, Havana" from 2002?




"It's all about abstract painting," Stewart said in wall text accompanying the photo.


The retrospective shines a light on how Stewart's work has evolved over time, from early black-and-white photographs to his more recent prints, which feature more color.


"It's two different languages," he said. "English would be the black and white. French would be the color."


"I worked in color the whole time, I just didn't have the money to print them," he added.


While photography can inform people about the world around them, Stewart has noted there is a gulf between the real world and a photograph.


"Reality is a fact, and a photograph is another fact," he explained. "The map is not the territory. It's just a map of the territory."
