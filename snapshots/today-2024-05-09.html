Trump, 18, to make political debut as Florida delegate to Republican
convention</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Miami, Florida — Former President Donald Trump’s youngest son, Barron
Trump, has been chosen to serve as a Florida delegate to the Republican
National Convention, the state party chairman said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Republican Party of Florida chairman Evan Power said the 18-year-old
high school senior will serve as one of 41 at-large delegates from
Florida to the national gathering, where the GOP is set to officially
nominate his father as its presidential candidate for the November
general election. NBC News first reported the choice of Barron Trump as
a delegate.</p>
<p>Barron Trump has been largely kept out of the public eye, but he
turned 18 on March and is graduating from high school next week. The
judge overseeing Donald Trump’s hush money trial in New York said there
would be no court on May 17 so that Trump could attend his son’s
graduation. </p>
<p>Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump and Trump’s youngest daughter, Tiffany,
are also part of the Florida delegation to the convention taking place
in Milwaukee from July 15 to July 18.</p>
<p>“We are fortunate to have a great group of grassroots leaders,
elected officials, and members of the Trump family working together as
part of the Florida delegation to the 2024 Republican National
Convention,” Power said in an emailed statement.</p>

weight loss drugs are transforming the weight loss industry</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-09, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
A new class of weight loss drugs known as GLP-1s, like Wegovy and
Zepbound, helped grow the weight loss industry to nearly $90 billion
last year. Now, weight loss companies, apps and fitness companies are
adapting their to programs include the drugs, as well. Also, allegations
of serious fraud threaten a big U.S.-U.K. soccer deal, and China’s
latest trade data showed a return to growth in April.

improves its application store, display mirroring, and more</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>As its first alpha release is closing in, we have another monthly
update about COSMIC, System76’s new Linux desktop environment written in
Rust. This month, they’ve further polished and shored up their
application store, imaginatively named COSMIC App Store, and it’s
supposedly incredibly fast – something I can’t say for its GNOME and KDE
counterparts, which tend to be so slow I’ve always just defaulted to
updating through the command line, mostly. The file manager now has
support for GVfs (GNOME Virtual file system) for making external storage
like USB drives work properly, and Greeter login screen, Edit text
editor, drag and drop, and copy/paste have been improved in various ways
as well. Theming has seen a lot of work this month, with support for
icon themes added to the App Library, fixed applet sizes, and more
tweaks, while light themes have been disabled for now to fix a number of
issues with colour selection being too dark. There’s also display
mirroring now, which even works when the individual displays have
different resolutions, orientations, and refresh rates. Pop!_OS is now
also being built for ARM64, which makes sense because System76 is now
also selling ARM servers. There’s also a bunch of work being done by the
community as the alpha release nears.</p>

windows in Linux with sockets, bare hands and 200 lines of C</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>X Server is slowly being deprecated in the Linux world and being
replaced Wayland. Still X11 is an interesting protocol to look at from
the perspective of binary communication and management of resource which
require fast speeds. In this post I tried to cover basic information and
create a simple but working app that is simple, defined in single file
and easily compiles. No external code except libc was used. I find it
fascinating when you can open black boxes and see how gears move each
other. ↫ Hereket As much as the time of X has come and is now finally in
the process of going, it’s still an incredibly powerful set of tools
that even in a bare state can do way, way more than you think. X has
come with its own window manager – twm – for decades, and it includes
several basic applications like xedit, xclock, xterm, xeyes. Twm is
actually pretty cool, and includes some features, like iconify to
desktop, that I wish still existed in modern desktop environments. It’s
quite bare-bones, though, and I doubt there’s anyone out there
unironically using it today. As the linked article notes, even without
advanced, complex libraries, toolkits, desktop environments, and so on,
it’s entirely possible to create fully functional windows and
applications with X. Of course, this makes perfect sense and shouldn’t
be surprising – it’s the X Window System, after all – but you so rarely
hear or read about it that you’d almost forget and just assume something
like GNOME or KDE is an absolute requirement to use X.</p>

<p>date: 2024-05-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — TikTok will begin labeling content created using
artificial intelligence when it’s uploaded from certain platforms.</p>
<p>TikTok says its efforts are an attempt to combat misinformation from
being spread on its social media platform.</p>
<p>The announcement came on ABCs “Good Morning America” on Thursday.</p>
<p>“Our users and our creators are so excited about AI and what it can
do for their creativity and their ability to connect with audiences.”
Adam Presser, TikTok’s Head of Operations &amp; Trust and Safety told
ABC News. “And at the same time, we want to make sure that people have
that ability to understand what fact is and what is fiction.”</p>
<p>TikTok’s policy in the past has been to encourage users to label
content that has been generated or significantly edited by AI. It also
requires users to label all AI-generated content where it contains
realistic images, audio, and video.</p>

The 10 corridors range from 12 miles to 780 miles in length. The public
will have 45 days to have their say on the proposals, and then the DOE
will narrow the list further. “In order to reach our clean energy and
climate goals, we’ve got to build out transmission as fast as possible
to get clean power from where it’s produced to where it’s needed,” said
John Podesta, senior advisor to the president for international climate
policy. “The Biden-Harris administration is committed to using every
tool at our disposal to accelerate progress on transmission permitting
and financing and build a clean energy future.”

<li>Climeworks opens new direct air capture plant
</h3>
<p>
In case you missed it: Climeworks opened its newest commercial direct
air capture plant yesterday. The Iceland-based facility, named Mammoth,
is not yet operating at full capacity, with only 12 of its planned 72
capturing and filtering units installed. When the plant is fully
operational — which Climeworks says should be sometime next year — it
will pull up to 36,000 metric tons of CO2 out of the atmosphere
annually. For scale, that’s about 1/28,000th of a gigaton. To get to net
zero emissions, we’ll have to remove multiple gigatons of carbon from
the atmosphere every year. “So in the context of where we need to go,
Mammoth is almost nothing,”

Heatmap’s new climate tech reporter Katie Brigham</a>. “But in the
context of our current reality, it’s nine times the size of the next
largest DAC facility: another Iceland-based Climeworks plant called
Orca. And it’s a major stepping stone towards the company’s ultimate
goal of capturing a million metric tons of CO2 yearly by 2030 and a

published in the journal <em>Nature</em>. The research pulls together
findings from nearly 1,000 previous studies on environmental damage to
paint a more complete picture of how humanity’s disruption to nature is
enabling the spread of pathogens – for humans, yes, but also for animals
and plants. It concludes that biodiversity loss, toxic chemicals, the
introduction of invasive species, and of course, human-caused climate
change, are all associated with “increases in disease-related end points
or harm.” Biodiversity loss was found to be particularly dangerous,
because it likely drives pathogens to evolve to target new and more
abundant hosts.

16.3, 15.7, 14.12, 13.15, and 12.19 Released!</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-09, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
The PostgreSQL Global Development Group has released an update to all
supported versions of PostgreSQL, including 16.3, 15.7, 14.12, 13.15,
and 12.19. This release fixes one security vulnerability and over 55
bugs reported over the last several months.
</p>
<p>
A security vulnerability was found in the system views
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/view-pg-stats-ext.html"><code>pg_stats_ext</code></a>
and
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/view-pg-stats-ext-exprs.html"><code>pg_stats_ext_exprs</code></a>,
potentially allowing authenticated database users to see data they don’t
have sufficient privileges to view. The fix for this vulnerability only
fixes fresh PostgreSQL installations, namely those that are created with
the
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-initdb.html"><code>initdb</code></a>
utility after this fix is applied. If you have a current PostgreSQL
installation and are concerned about this issue, please follow the
instructions in the “Updating” section for remediation steps.

</ul>
<h2>
Updating
</h2>
<p>
All PostgreSQL update releases are cumulative. As with other minor
releases, users are not required to dump and reload their database or
use <code>pg_upgrade</code> in order to apply this update release; you
may simply shutdown PostgreSQL and update its binaries.
</p>
<p>
For existing installations that are impacted by CVE-2024-4317 that wish
to remediate the issue, you will have to perform the following steps:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Find the SQL script <code>fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql</code> in the
<code>share</code> directory of your PostgreSQL installation (e.g. in
<code>/usr/share/postgresql/</code>), or download it from the PostgreSQL
git repository from one of the URLs below. You will need to use the
script that matches your major version:
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<a href="https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=blob;f=src/backend/catalog/fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql;hb=refs/heads/REL_16_STABLE">PostgreSQL

<a href="https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=blob;f=src/backend/catalog/fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql;hb=refs/heads/REL_15_STABLE">https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=blob;f=src/backend/catalog/fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql;hb=refs/heads/REL_15_STABLE</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=blob;f=src/backend/catalog/fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql;hb=refs/heads/REL_14_STABLE">PostgreSQL

</li>
</ol>
<p>
From the above URLs, you can click the URL that says “raw” to download a
version that you can copy and paste.
</p>
<p>
Be sure to use the script appropriate to your PostgreSQL major version.
If you do not see this file, either your version is not vulnerable (only
PostgreSQL 14, 15, and 16 are affected) or your minor version is too old
to have the fix.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
In each database of the cluster, run the
<code>fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql</code> script as a database superuser. For
example, in
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html"><code>psql</code></a>,
with the file located in <code>/usr/share/postgresql/</code>, this
command would look like:
</li>
</ol>
<p>
<code>/usr/share/postgresql/fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql</code>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
You must also execute this script in the <code>template0</code> and
<code>template1</code> databases, or the vulnerability will still exist
in databases you create later. To fix <code>template0</code>, you’ll
need to temporarily allow it accept connections. You can do this with
the following command:
</li>
</ol>
<p>
<code>ALTER DATABASE template0 WITH ALLOW_CONNECTIONS true;</code>
</p>
<p>
After executing the <code>fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql</code> script in
<code>template0</code> and <code>template1</code>, you should revoke the
ability for <code>template0</code> to accept connections. You can do
this with the following command:
</p>
<p>
<code>ALTER DATABASE template0 WITH ALLOW_CONNECTIONS false;</code>
</p>
<p>
Users who have skipped one or more update releases may need to run
additional post-update steps; please see the release notes from earlier
versions for details.
</p>
<p>

<h2 id="did-github-copilot-really-increase-my-productivity">Did GitHub
Copilot really increase my productivity?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-08, from: OS News</p>
<p>Yuxuan Shui, the developer behind the X11 compositor picom (a fork of
Compton) published a blog post detailing their experiences with using
GitHub Copilot for a year. I had free access to GitHub Copilot for about
a year, I used it, got used to it, and slowly started to take it for
granted, until one day it was taken away. I had to re-adapt to a life
without Copilot, but it also gave me a chance to look back at how I used
Copilot, and reflect – had Copilot actually been helpful to me? Copilot
definitely feels a little bit magical when it works. It’s like it
plucked code straight from my brain and put it on the screen for me to
accept. Without it, I find myself getting grumpy a lot more often when I
need to write boilerplate code – “Ugh, Copilot would have done it for
me!”, and now I have to type it all out myself. That being said, the
answer to my question above is a very definite “no, I am more productive
without it”. Let me explain. ↫ Yuxuan Shui The two main reasons why Shui
eventually realised Copilot was slowing them down were its
unpredictability, and its slowness. It’s very difficult to understand
when, exactly, Copilot will get things right, which is not a great thing
to have to deal with when you’re writing code. They also found Copilot
incredibly slow, with its suggestions often taking 2-3 seconds or longer
to appear – much slower than the suggestions from the clangd language
server they use. Of course, everybody’s situation will be different, and
I have a suspicion that if you’re writing code in incredibly popular
languages, say, Python or JavaScript, you’re going to get more accurate
and possibly faster suggestions from Copilot. As Shui notes, it probably
also doesn’t help that they’re writing an independent X11 compositor,
something very few people are doing, meaning Copilot hasn’t been trained
on it, which in turn means the tool probably has no clue what’s going on
when Shui is writing their code. As an aside, my opinion on GitHub
Copilot is clear – it’s quite possibly the largest case of copyright
infringement in human history, and in its current incarnation it should
not be allowed to continue to operate. As I wrote over a year ago: If
Microsoft or whoever else wants to train a coding “AI” or whatever, they
should either be using code they own the copyright to, get explicit
permission from the rightsholders for “AI” training use (difficult for
code from larger projects), or properly comply with the terms of the
licenses and automatically add the terms and copyright notices during
autocomplete and/or properly apply copyleft to the newly generated code.
Anything else is a massive copyright violation and a direct assault on
open source. Let me put it this way – the code to various versions of
Windows has leaked numerous times. What if we train an “AI” on that
leaked code and let everyone use it? Do you honestly think Microsoft
would not sue you into the stone age? ↫ Thom Holwerda It’s curious that
as far as I know, Copilot has not been trained on Microsoft’s own
closed-source code, say, to Windows or Office, while at the same time
the company claims Copilot is not copyright infringement or a massive
open source license violation machine. If what Copilot does is truly
fair use, as Microsoft claims, why won’t Microsoft use its own
closed-source code for training? We all know the answer. Deeply
questionable legality aside, do any of you use Copilot? Has it had any
material impact on your programming work? Is its use allowed by your
employer, or do you only use it for personal projects at home?</p>

House rejects effort to remove Speaker Johnson from office</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — Hard-line Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene stunned
colleagues Wednesday by calling for a vote to oust Speaker Mike Johnson.
Lawmakers quickly rejected it. </p>
<p>Greene pressed ahead with her long-shot effort despite pushback from
Republicans at the highest levels tired of the political chaos. </p>
<p>One of Donald Trump’s biggest supporters in Congress, Greene stood on
the House floor and read a long list of what she called transgressions
that Johnson had committed as speaker. Colleagues booed in protest. </p>
<p>It was the second time in a matter of months that Republicans have
tried to oust their own speaker, an unheard-of level of party turmoil
with a move rarely seen in U.S. history. </p>
<p>Greene of Georgia criticized Johnson’s leadership as “pathetic, weak
and unacceptable.” </p>
<p>Republican lawmakers filtered toward Johnson, giving him pats on the
back and grasping his shoulder to assure him of their support. </p>
<p>House Majority Leader Steve Scalise quickly moved to table the effort
— essentially stopping it from going forward. The motion to table was
swiftly approved. </p>
<p>The Georgia Republican had vowed she would force a vote on the motion
to vacate the Republican speaker if he dared to advance a foreign aid
package with funds for Ukraine, which was overwhelmingly approved late
last month and signed into law. </p>
<p>Johnson of Louisiana said he had been willing to take the risk,
believing it was important for the U.S. to back Ukraine against Russia’s
invasion and explaining he wanted to be on the “right side of
history.” </p>
<p>“I just have to do my job every day,” Johnson said Monday. </p>
<p>In a highly unusual move, the speaker received a boost from Democrats
led by Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, whose leadership team
had said it was time to “turn the page” on the Republican turmoil and
vote to table Greene’s resolution — almost ensuring Johnson’s job is
saved, for now. </p>
<p>Trump also weighed in after Johnson trekked to Mar-a-Lago for a
visit, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee giving the
speaker his nod of approval. And Trump’s hand-picked leader at the
Republican National Committee urged House Republicans off the move.</p>

US needs counterterrorism partners in Central Asia</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — In a rare discussion of Central Asia policy on Capitol
Hill, a senior legislator told VOA that the United States needs to look
past the abysmal human rights records of the countries in the region to
confront terrorism and Russian and Chinese influence.</p>
<p>“If we want their help somehow, we need to be able to help them,”
Representative Adam Smith, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services
Committee, said in a one-on-one interview.</p>
<p>The 27-year House lawmaker was part of the most recent congressional
delegation to visit Uzbekistan, along with Armed Services Committee
Chair Mike Rogers, Salud Carbajal and Veronica Escobar.</p>
<p>The message they carried to the region was clear: Washington wants to
enhance security cooperation while backing political and economic
reforms.</p>
<p>The Uzbek leadership, in turn, conveyed enthusiasm for broadening the
strategic partnership, which dates to the early 2000s.</p>
<p>During the March 26-27 visit to Tashkent, the delegation met with
Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev, Foreign Minister Bakhtiyor Saidov
and Minister of Defense Major General Bakhodir Kurbanov. According to
Smith, these discussions underscored Uzbekistan’s pivotal role in
“keeping an eye on what’s going on in Afghanistan.”</p>
<p>He sees the Islamic State extremist group, or ISIS, and
radicalization in general, as the most prominent terrorism threats.</p>
<p>“Uzbekistan is close and could potentially be a partner in tracking
ISIS or other extremist elements,” he said. “So, having a partner in the
region that we can work with to identify potential threats and counter
radicalization, to make sure that the ideologies don’t take hold or
produce terrorists, like the ones that struck in Moscow.”</p>
<p>Several Central Asian citizens were arrested in connection with an
attack on a Moscow concert hall in March that killed 144 people.
Responsibility was claimed by Islamic State-Khorasan, also known as
ISIS-K or IS-K, a regional offshoot of Islamic State.</p>
<p>Despite the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, Smith said the
United States still has interests in that country and that Tashkent,
which maintains a tight relationship with the Taliban, can help in that
regard.</p>
<p>“Al-Qaida is still in the region. ISIS, obviously. The Taliban are
fighting ISIS-K,” the congressman said. “We are still very interested in
the region. The difference is we’re not there. We don’t have a good
ability to monitor it and act. So, we are looking for partners.”</p>
<p>In Smith’s view, the U.S. must be more strategic in competing with
Russia and China as they try to advance their own influence in the
region.</p>
<p>Unlike Moscow and Beijing, Washington does not build infrastructure.
Instead, it offers technical assistance and works through international
financial institutions — endeavors that Smith describes as
substantial.</p>
<p>One way the United States could help Uzbekistan, he said, is by
helping to find a way to advance the landlocked country’s goal of
establishing a rail link through Afghanistan and Pakistan to the Indian
Ocean.</p>
<p>Security relationships with countries in the region “have not
significantly increased” since the U.S. left Afghanistan, Smith
acknowledged, but “we’re trying to build some of those relationships
with Uzbekistan.”</p>
<p>In 2021, Congress appropriated $10 million under the Foreign Military
Financing program to enhance Central Asia’s border security and
counterterrorism capabilities, supplying vehicles, communications
equipment and training.</p>
<p>Brushing off Russian speculation that the U.S. is seeking to open a
military base in Central Asia, Smith said there are no such efforts.</p>
<p>“We’re seeking partners. We’re not seeking a presence,” he said while
emphasizing the importance of overflight agreements and intelligence
collaboration.</p>
<p>Smith and other lawmakers, including those in the congressional
Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan caucuses, concede that Central Asia has some
of the world’s most authoritarian regimes, which suppress dissent and
independent media. State Department reports describe the countries as
prominent human rights violators.</p>
<p>In Turkmenistan, Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov ruled for 15 years before
passing the presidency to his son, Serdar Berdimuhamedov, in 2022.</p>
<p>In Tajikistan, President Emomali Rahmon has been in power since 1992
and is expected to follow Berdimuhamedov’s path.</p>
<p>In Uzbekistan, a government-engineered constitutional referendum in
2023 allowed Mirziyoyev, president since 2016, to continue for two
seven-year terms.</p>
<p>Nursultan Nazarbayev governed Kazakhstan for 30 years before stepping
down in 2019. His hand-picked successor, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, also
changed the constitution but promised to leave at the end of his term in
2029.</p>
<p>For years, Kyrgyzstan stood out as having the most democratic
potential in the region. However, its current president, Sadyr Japarov,
has jailed critics and recently adopted a Russian-style “foreign agents”
law.</p>
<p>Smith says the U.S. does not ignore reality, yet he favors pragmatism
over preaching.</p>
<p>“If you simply say, ‘We don’t think your elections were as free and
fair. We’re out, we’re not working with you,’ those countries can very,
very easily turn to China, Russia, Iran and who knows, maybe someday,
North Korea. So, we have to understand what’s doable and realistic.”</p>
<p>Having met the Uzbek president in Tashkent, Smith calls Mirziyoyev “a
smart guy” who is moving Uzbekistan “in the right direction.”</p>
<p>“I think they are genuinely trying to improve their economy, deal
with terrorism but they’ve got a long way to go,” he said.</p>
<p>As on many issues, Democrats and Republicans differ on Central Asia.
But Smith stresses that “most members of Congress don’t pay attention to
that part of the world. There is not a well thought-out approach.”</p>
<p>“If you were to poll 435 [representatives] over their two-year term,
how many times have they thought about Uzbekistan? Very few. I’d say
probably 400 of them never thought about it,” Smith said. “So, we are
working on that.”</p>

When you think of climate change, you think of Alaska whether you
realize it or not.

With its pipelines, polar bears, and dramatic, calving glaciers, the
state has contributed an outsized amount of stock footage to global
warming montages over the years. Combined with a

impression — among outsiders, anyway — of the state as a
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/biden-s-climate-betrayal" target="_self"><u>front
line</u></a> in the battle between continued fossil fuel dependence and
a clean-energy future.
</p>
<p>
Somewhat ironically, Alaskans themselves don’t typically view things
that way. Though no fewer than four utility board elections and the
Anchorage mayoral race this spring will help to
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/8-climate-races-election-2024" target="_self"><u>shape
the energy future of the Railbelt</u></a>, the electrical grid that runs
from Fairbanks through Anchorage and out to the Kenai Peninsula and
serves 70% of the state’s population, locals are debating the stakes in
terms of cost.
</p>
<p>
“Literally nobody who is pitching renewables [on the campaign trail] is
pitching them as a solution to climate change,” Nathaniel Herz, an
independent Anchorage-based reporter who covers energy, environment, and
government issues in the state for his newsletter
<a href="https://www.northernjournal.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>Northern
Journal</em></em></u></a>, told me. Rather, the selling point is that
wind, solar, and tidal power could be the way out of an urgent gas
shortage.
</p>
<p>
The energy crisis touched off in earnest last May when the region’s
largest natural gas producer, Hilcorp, informed the four Railbelt
utilities that it doesn’t have access to enough deliverable gas in Cook
Inlet to guarantee new contracts going forward. Though a gas shortage in
the aging basin was

shock; the Railbelt utilities get

</p>
<p>
Homer Electric Association was the first utility to face the
consequences, with a contract that
<a href="https://alaskapublic.org/2023/07/03/with-shortfall-looming-report-outlines-ways-to-fill-alaskas-gas-gaps/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>expired
this year</u></a>. As a stopgap, it signed a one-year contract with
Enstar, the local private gas utility that gets 90% of its supply from
Hilcorp (and also supplies gas for heating homes and businesses) at a
higher price. The rest of the Railbelt co-ops’ contracts are set to
expire by 2028.
</p>
<p>
Proposed solutions to the crisis range from new drilling in Cook Inlet —
which is risky, expensive, and laden with permitting hurdles,
<a href="https://alaskapublic.org/2023/11/30/theres-lots-of-gas-in-cook-inlet-heres-why-some-companies-arent-drilling/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>making

$43 billion pipeline</u></a> from the oil-rich North Slope.
<a href="https://www.northernjournal.com/p/political-pressure-builds-as-state" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>More
realistically</u></a>, the Railbelt seems headed toward
<a href="https://www.northernjournal.com/p/could-oil-rich-alaska-be-forced-to" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>importing
liquified natural gas from British Columbia</u></a>, at least in the
short term.
</p>
<p>
That option is “really unpalatable to many Alaskans,” Satchel
Pondolfino, the lower Kenai Peninsula organizer for Cook Inletkeeper, a
Homer-based environmental non-profit, told me. “We’re an energy state:
It’s inconceivable for a lot of people that we have to bring in fuel
from other places.”
</p>
<p>
It’s also expensive. Importing LNG could result in 50% higher costs for
the utilities. That, in turn, would mean up to a 15% hike in consumers’
<a href="https://www.adn.com/opinions/2021/08/28/alaska-is-high-in-natural-power-its-time-to-lead-the-nation/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>already-steep
utility bills</u></a>, and likely “even more than that for heating
bills,” as
<a href="https://www.northernjournal.com/p/analysis-lng-imports-are-likely-coming" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Herz
has reported</u></a> — no small thing in a place where it is dark and
cold for half the year. One independent analysis Herz cites found that
the 80% renewable portfolio standard proposed by the state’s Republican
Governor Mike Dunleavy
<a href="https://www.northernjournal.com/p/as-natural-gas-shortage-looms-alaska" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">would
save $6.7 billion in fuel costs</a> over the next 35 years compared to
an estimated $3.2 billion investment in the projects. The National
Renewable Energy Laboratory’s
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/evaluating-80-rps-alaskas-railbelt-cost-analysis" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">latest
assessment</a> likewise found that a large clean-energy build-out would
be “more affordable than relying on imported natural gas.”
</p>
<p>
Critically, then, the spring elections in Alaska will help decide both
what the long-term solution will be and how quickly it should be
implemented. The Anchorage mayoral runoff set for this coming Tuesday —
a choice between incumbent Dave Bronson, a
<a href="https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/anchorage/2021/03/27/anchorage-mayoral-candidate-dave-bronson-wants-to-take-the-city-in-a-new-direction/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>self-described</u></a>
“center-right kind of guy” who

new Cook Inlet drilling</u></a>, and Suzanne LaFrance, a Lead
Locally-endorsed climate candidate pushing for a renewable mix — is
perhaps the marquee race, albeit one with a more limited say over the
future energy mix.
</p>
<p>
“Utilities have control over specifically where they get their energy
from, and the legislature has a lot of control over how we tax different
energy producers,” Jenny-Marie Stryker, the political director at The
Alaska Center, the state’s largest conservation advocacy organization,
told me. But while there is not “one turnkey thing that we’re looking
for the mayor to do,” Stryker added, it’s instead the “many, many steps”
LaFrance has promised to follow in the city’s
<a href="https://www.muni.org/Departments/Mayor/AWARE/ResilientAnchorage/pages/climateactionplan.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>climate
action plan</u></a> that would mark an improvement over Bronson.
(LaFrance’s campaign did not respond to Heatmap’s request for comment.)
</p>
<p>
Bronson, who was elected during the pandemic when Alaskans were
bristling against perceived government overreach,
<a href="https://alaskapublic.org/2024/03/22/anchorage-mayoral-candidates-describe-city-in-decline-during-alaska-public-media-debate/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ignored</u></a>
his predecessor’s climate action plan and established the Southcentral
Mayors’ Energy Coalition to address the Railbelt energy crisis — a move
Stryker told me was a “pretty big waste of time,” since it’s something
the 11-mayor group has “no control over.” Bronson defended his decision
to me in an emailed statement, arguing that any climate action plan is
by necessity secondary to addressing Southcentral Alaska’s immediate
energy concerns.
</p>
<p>
“It is easy to say, ‘Let’s build a massive solar plant, let’s invest in
tidal energy, let’s investigate geothermal,’” he wrote. “However, there
are grid transmission upgrades that need to be made” before that can be
a reality. Additionally, while the assumption is that building out new
renewables is “easy,” the “permitting process alone can take 2-3 years,
and in some cases, 5-6 years,” he stressed. (New LNG import terminals,
meanwhile,
<a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/alaska-legislature/2024/02/08/alaska-legislators-warned-of-energy-supply-gap-as-large-scale-imported-gas-likely-not-available-until-2030/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>might
not be online until 2030</u></a>.)
</p>
<p>
Herz, the reporter, told me earlier that renewable project developers
“would be looking at capital expenditures that were 80% to 90% higher
than they would be to develop utility-scale renewable projects in the
Lower 48.” In an oil state, there is also an “inherent skepticism about
some of the renewable technology and economic viability that you might
not find elsewhere in the United States because there aren’t really big
utility-scale projects that have been built here.” The ones that are on
the board — including
<a href="https://www.nrel.gov/news/program/2024/tidal-energy-is-coming-to-alaska-but-how-much.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
possible and intriguing tidal energy project</u></a> — fall more firmly
into the purview of the local co-ops.
</p>
<p>
The utility board elections, then, have a more immediate hand in shaping
the Railbelt’s future energy mix. Two of those elections have already
taken place: for the board of the Matanushka Electric Association, where
<a href="https://www.mea.coop/co-op-benefits/election-and-annual-meeting" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>both
climate candidates lost</u></a> (albeit one by just 41 of 3,246 votes),
and for the Homer Electric Association, where a climate candidate was
re-elected and a challenger lost,
<a href="https://www.peninsulaclarion.com/news/hea-voters-elect-status-quo-board/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>maintaining
the board’s ideological status quo</u></a>. Chugach Electric
Association, which represents Anchorage and is the largest provider in
the state, will go next, with voting ongoing and ending May 17. That
board is currently held by a pro-renewable majority that has
<a href="https://www.akbizmag.com/industry/energy/op-ed-chugach-electric-associations-progress-on-clean-energy-goals/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>advanced</u></a>
utility-scale wind and solar projects, with pro-gas challengers
<a href="https://www.adn.com/business-economy/energy/2024/04/17/chugach-electric-association-board-candidates-differ-on-approaches-to-renewable-energy-natural-gas-crisis/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>vying
to take back control</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Finally, Fairbanks’ Golden Valley Electric Association ballots are due
June 4, with Gary Newman, a pro-renewable Democrat, attempting to hold
off Harmony Tomaszewski, who helped
<a href="https://www.fbxclimateaction.org/blog/march-energy-updates" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>block</u></a>
a local climate action plan last year. Fairbanks has been hit especially
hard by the energy crisis, burning coal and diesel to compensate for LNG
shortfalls and
<a href="https://earthjustice.org/press/2022/severe-human-health-risks-ongoing-in-fairbanks-as-epa-fails-to-address-some-of-the-nations-worst-air-pollution" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>polluting
its air</u></a>. A rate hike of about
<a href="https://www.webcenterfairbanks.com/2024/02/29/gvea-announces-price-raise/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$29
more per month</u></a> for households has also brought unusually high
levels of public interest to the co-op election.
</p>
<p>
While “on paper” the current GVEA board is “pretty conservative,”
Eleanor Gagnon, the energy justice organizer with the Fairbanks Climate
Action Coalition, told me, its annual meeting in April featured a lot of
talk about diversifying its energy portfolio — a conversation that would
have been shocking even a few years ago. “They really seem to have come
to the realization that more renewables are necessary because of these
rate hikes, and because the rate hikes are due to the instability of
natural gas sources,” she said.
</p>
<p>
I’ve
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/climate-change-voting-elections" target="_self"><u>spoken
with organizers before</u></a> about how policies with positive climate
benefits are often economic issues at heart — ones that sometimes
override environmental motivations — and that seems especially true in
Alaska. “The urgency of Cook Inlet gas not meeting our demands by 2027 —
folks are throwing climate out the window,” Pondolfino, the Cook
Inletkeeper organizer, said. “They’re like, ‘We just need energy
security and we need to be able to afford it.’”
</p>
<p>
The math shows that having a diversified renewable mix
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/evaluating-80-rps-alaskas-railbelt-cost-analysis" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>would
be </em></em></u><u>better economically</u></a> than importing expensive
LNG. That doesn’t mean it will be an easy transition, or a quick one,
but it gives activists and advocates a clear goal to keep working toward
on every ballot.
</p>
<p>
“Most people in the Lower 48 do not have any way to voice their opinion
about the direction their utility should move in, or to vote for
representatives,” Pondolfino said. “It is a privilege to vote in
elections that have a really direct impact on people’s lives and their
ability to afford to live here.”

<h2 id="raspberry-pi-connect-remote-desktop-for-your-pi">Raspberry Pi
Connect: remote desktop for your Pi</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-08, from: OS News</p>
<p>Today we’re pleased to announce the beta release of Raspberry Pi
Connect: a secure and easy-to-use way to access your Raspberry Pi
remotely, from anywhere on the planet, using just a web browser. It’s
often extremely useful to be able to access your Raspberry Pi’s desktop
remotely. There are a number of technologies which can be used to do
this, including VNC, and of course the X protocol itself. But they can
be hard to configure, particularly when you are attempting to access a
machine on a different local network; and of course with the transition
to Wayland in Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm, classic X remote desktop support
is no longer available. We wanted to be able to provide you with this
functionality with our usual “it just works” approach. Enter Raspberry
Pi Connect. ↫ Gordon Hollingworth Pi Connect uses WebRTC, and a daemon
running on your Pi listens for incoming screensharing requests from the
Raspberry Pi website to connect the VNC server on your Pi to the VNC
client running in your browser. The service is in beta, it’s free, but
the one major downside is that for now, there’s only one TURN server for
this service, located in the UK, but they might set up more of them if
demand is high enough. If you want to try this service on your own Pi
running Raspberry Pi OS, you’re going to need to be using a Raspberry Pi
5, 4, or 400, using the latest version of the operating system running
Wayland. Update your operating system, install the rpi-connect package,
reboot, and you’re good to go.</p>

<p>The U.S. has revoked licenses that allowed companies including Intel
and Qualcomm to ship chips used for laptops and handsets to sanctioned
Chinese telecoms equipment maker Huawei Technologies, three people
familiar with the matter said. ↫ Alexandra Alper, Fanny Potkin, David
Shepardson The timing of this news is very interesting, as despite the
massive sanctions the United States levied against Huawei, the company
seems to be doing really well, with its smartphone business seeing
massive gains in the Chinese market, at the expense of everyone else.
This proves that Huawei does not need access to western chips and
technologies to be successful, which must definitely sting in the US and
Europe. Strong financial results, using hardware and chips designed not
by western companies but by Chinese ones, combined with the only mobile
operating system that has any serious potential to at least somewhat
threaten Android and iOS. The various sanctions were clearly intended to
hurt Huawei and possibly contain it to just China, but it seems they’re
not having their desired effect at all.</p>

set to tighten asylum access at US-Mexico border, sources say</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Biden administration is set to tighten access to
asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border via a new regulation that could be
issued as soon as Thursday, four sources familiar with the matter said.
The move is aimed at reducing illegal crossings. </p>
<p>The regulation would require migrants to be assessed at an initial
asylum screening stage to see whether they should be barred from asylum
and quickly deported, said the sources, who requested anonymity to
discuss internal government planning. They added that the measure
appeared limited in scope.  </p>
<p>The migrants would be assessed related to criminality and security
threats, two of the sources said. </p>
<p>The new regulation would improve efficiency by screening
asylum-seekers earlier in the process to determine whether they should
be barred, one of the sources, a U.S. official, told Reuters. It would
be issued as a proposed regulation and finalized at a later date, the
official said. </p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden, a Democrat seeking another four-year term
in the November 5 election, has struggled with at times high numbers of
migrants caught crossing the U.S.-Mexico border since taking office in
2021. Former U.S. President Donald Trump, Biden’s Republican challenger,
has criticized Biden for rolling back more restrictive Trump-era
policies. </p>
<p>The Biden administration has considered a more sweeping move to block
asylum-seekers and migrants at the border using a federal statute
deployed by Trump in his travel bans, but is not immediately planning to
take that step, the sources said. </p>
<p>Biden implemented new asylum restrictions last year, but their
effectiveness has been limited by a lack of resources to process
arriving migrants. </p>
<p>The regulation expected to be issued this week could mean potentially
thousands of people would be more quickly deported from the U.S. per
year, two of the sources said, a relatively small number compared with
the total number caught crossing illegally.</p>

<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Sometimes you have to listen to the messages life sends your way. And today that message is that I have to write something about guestbooks. In less than 2 hours, two emails landed in my inbox—I love emails, if you want to get in touch please &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:hello@manuelmoreale.com&quot;&gt;do send one&lt;/a&gt;—both on the topic of guestbooks.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
The first one was from <a href="https://bjhess.com">Barry</a>. His site
now has a <a href="https://bjhess.com/guestbook">lovely guestbook</a>
that I haven’t signed yet because I want to come up with a nice drawing
for it. Barry also works on a blog platform called
<a href="https://pika.page">Pika</a>, worth checking out if you want to
start a blog—you should—and you’re considering a hosted solution.
</p>
<p>
The second email was a ping from
<a href="https://devastatia.com/123guestbook-shutting-down">Devastatia’s
website</a>. She wrote a post on the subject of guestbooks because
apparently <a href="https://www.123guestbook.com">123guestbook.com</a>,
one of the OG sites,
<a href="https://www.123guestbook.com/news.php?id=closure">is shutting
down</a>. If for some reason you were using it to power your guestbook
you should consider exporting your content and preserving all the
signatures in some way.
</p>
<p>
Guestbooks are cool. If you haven’t already,

know if your site has one because I’m going to both sign it and also add
it to the list on my guestbook page.

revokes some licenses for exports to China’s Huawei</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The United States has revoked certain licenses for
exports to Chinese tech giant Huawei, the Commerce Department said,
drawing opposition from Beijing on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The move came after criticism last month by Republican lawmakers, who
urged President Joe Biden’s administration to block all export licenses
to the company after it released a new laptop powered by a processor by
U..S chip giant Intel.</p>
<p>“We continuously assess how our controls can best protect our
national security and foreign policy interests, taking into
consideration a constantly changing threat environment and technological
landscape,” said a Commerce Department spokesperson.</p>
<p>“We are not commenting on any specific licenses, but we can confirm
that we have revoked certain licenses for exports to Huawei,” the
spokesperson added in a statement to AFP.</p>
<p>Huawei has long been caught in an intense technological rivalry
between Beijing and Washington, which has warned that the firm’s
equipment could be used for Chinese espionage operations.</p>
<p>The company denies these claims.</p>
<p>Sanctions in 2019 restricting Huawei’s access to U.S.-made components
dealt a major blow to its production of smartphones – and meant that
suppliers need a license before shipping to the company.</p>
<p>Asked about reports that the U.S. government had revoked some
companies’ licenses, a Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson said
Beijing “firmly opposes this.”</p>
<p>“China will take all necessary measures to firmly safeguard the
legitimate rights and interests of Chinese firms,” the spokesperson
added.</p>
<p>The announcement of a new Huawei computer recently, powered by Intel
technology, drew fire from Republican lawmakers in the United
States. </p>
<p>A letter by policymakers Marco Rubio and Elise Stefanik charged that
“licenses issued in 2020, at least some of which are active to this day,
have allowed Huawei to collaborate with Intel and Qualcomm to keep its
PC and smartphone segments alive.”</p>
<p>It criticized the allowance of US tech into Huawei’s new product.</p>

Newest Direct Air Capture Plant Is Officially Live</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-08, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjE4NzI1NC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczMzEzNzU5Mn0.KURqCKn_VckgPJj2c7q6PGrDqAgAurntYDNkdVendLU/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
If one company has set the pace for direct air capture, it’s
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/climeworks-orca-data-carbon-removal-direct-air-capture" target="_self">Climeworks</a>.
The Switzerland-based business opened its — and the world’s — first
commercial DAC plant in 2017, capable of capturing “several hundred
tons” of carbon dioxide each year. Today, the company unveiled its
newest plant, the aptly named Mammoth. Located in Iceland, Mammoth is
designed to take advantage of the country’s unique geology to capture
and store up to 36,000 metric tons of carbon per year — eventually.
Here’s what you need to know about the new project.
</p>
<h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Mammoth is, well, huge
</h3>
<p>
Mammoth is not yet operating at full capacity, with only 12 of its
planned 72 capturing and filtering units installed. When the plant is
fully operational — which Climeworks says should be sometime next year —
it will pull up to 36,000 metric tons of CO2 out of the atmosphere
annually. For scale, that’s about 1/28,000th of a gigaton. To get to net
zero emissions, we’ll have to remove
<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/sustainability/our-insights/carbon-removals-how-to-scale-a-new-gigaton-industry" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>multiple</em></em></u><u>
gigatons</u></a> of carbon from the atmosphere every year.
</p>
<p>
“The engineered solutions will have to play a major — and I would say
even <em><em>the</em></em> major part of this task,” said Climeworks CEO
Jan Wurzbacher at the virtual press conference for Mammoth’s unveiling.
In his opinion, nature-based solutions “will not be able to scale to the
level where we need them to be.”
</p>
<p>
So in the context of where we need to go, Mammoth is almost nothing. But
in the context of our current reality, it’s nine times the size of the
next largest DAC facility: another Iceland-based Climeworks plant called
Orca. And it’s a major stepping stone towards the company’s ultimate
goal of capturing a million metric tons of CO2 yearly by 2030 and a
billion by 2050.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Construction happened quickly
</h3>
<p>
Climeworks first broke ground on Mammoth in June 2022, and 18 months
later the company announced that the “core pieces of the plant are
built.” Now that the plant has started capturing CO2, Climeworks says
the rest of 2024 will be devoted to installing the remaining CO2capture
units and ramping toward full capacity.
</p>
<p>
Thus far in its history, Climeworks has largely avoided the construction
delays that often plague first-of-its-kind projects. “They’re coming out
with new projects every three to four years, which is a pretty wild
timeline,” said Erin Burns, Executive Director of the nonprofit
Carbon180.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>It runs on 100% zero-emission power
</h3>
<p>
Through Climework’s partnership with Icelandic geothermal company ON
Power, Mammoth is powered in full by geothermal energy — although the
company has long been reticent about how much energy, exactly, it needs.
</p>
<p>
At any rate, Climeworks has committed to powering the direct air capture
process as well as its storage process with 100% renewables in the long
run. The company cited Kenya, New Zealand, and Indonesia as other areas
that would be geologically advantageous for future Climeworks
facilities, as all have substantial geothermal resources.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>The carbon is still quite expensive
</h3>
<p>
Climeworks said it would be able to disclose an exact cost per metric
ton of carbon removal figure after Mammoth has been operational for a
year or two. But in the meantime, Wurzbacher said the company is “closer
to the $1,000 per ton mark than we are to the $100 per ton mark.” He
expects prices to drop as the company further scales, and is aiming for
$300 to $350 per metric ton by 2030, and ultimately $100 per metric ton
by 2050. That’s in line with the Department of Energy’s Earthshots
initiative, which aims to reduce the cost of a variety of carbon dioxide
removal pathways to below $100 per metric ton by 2050.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Climeworks has sold about a third of Mammoth’s lifetime capacity
</h3>
<p>
While Climeworks hasn’t divulged Mammoth’s lifetime carbon removal
capacity, it said the plant is designed to operate for 25 years, and
that a third of its lifetime capacity has already been sold. The
remainder will be sold in the next year or two, representatives told
reporters
</p>
<p>
The company has offtake agreements with more than 160 organizations
including some major corporate buyers such as
<a href="https://climeworks.com/press-release/jp-morgan-chase-signs-landmark-cdr-agreement-with-climeworks" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>JPMorgan
Chase</u></a>,
<a href="https://climeworks.com/press-release/bcg-and-climeworks-sign-15-year-partnership-agreement" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Boston
Consulting Group</u></a> and
<a href="https://climeworks.com/press-release/climeworks-extends-collaboration-with-microsoft" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Microsoft</u></a>.
Many of these agreements span a decade or more and involve tens of
thousands of tons of CO2 removal from current and future Climeworks
projects. (The company also recently opened a marketplace,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/climeworks-solutions-carbon-removal" target="_self"><u>Climeworks
Solutions</u></a>, to package and sell “high quality” carbon credits
from other carbon removal companies.)
</p>
<p>
The Mammoth plant was primarily financed by Climework’s own equity, said
Wurzbacher. “But going forward, project financing will be vital to
accelerate the scale up. And for that, such long-term offtake agreements
are important.”
</p>
<p>
Now that the plant is operational, it should help drive more investment,
Dana Jacobs, chief of staff at the Carbon Removal Alliance, told me.
“Having carbon removal projects that you can see and reach out and touch
and understand is so critical,” she said.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>Mammoth is small potatoes compared to what’s next
</h3>
<p>
Climeworks said the lessons from Mammoth will help the company scale
further as it enters the U.S. market through its participation in the
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/oced/regional-direct-air-capture-hubs-selected-and-awarded-projects" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Department
of Energy-funded</u></a> direct air capture hub,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/project-cypress-climeworks-heirloom" target="_self"><u>Project
Cypress in Louisiana</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Climeworks is working on Project Cypress alongside developer Battelle
and another direct air capture company, Heirloom. The project is
designed to capture a <em><em>million</em></em> metric tons of
CO2annually by 2030, and recently received an
<a href="https://climeworks.com/news/project-cypress-team-awarded-funding-from-us-doe" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>initial
$50 million grant</u></a> from the DOE to kickstart the project’s
planning, design and community engagement processes.

batter Midwest, including reported tornadoes that shredded FedEx
facility</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>DETROIT — Severe storms barreled through the Midwest early Wednesday,
a day after two reported tornadoes struck one Michigan city and
destroyed homes and commercial buildings, including a FedEx
facility. </p>
<p>Tornadoes were first reported after dark Tuesday in parts of
Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, while portions of Illinois, Kentucky and
Missouri were also under a tornado watch, according to the National
Weather Service. The storms came a day after a deadly twister ripped
through an Oklahoma town. </p>
<p>As the storms raged on in the pre-dawn hours Wednesday, the National
Weather Service in Pittsburgh warned that a tornado in northeastern Ohio
could cross into Pennsylvania. Parts of West Virginia were also under a
tornado warning. </p>
<p>Hancock County Schools in West Virginia closed schools Wednesday
because of “extensive overnight weather issues” in the county. News
outlets reported damaged buildings and power outages. </p>
<p>Hours earlier in southwestern Michigan, two reported tornadoes
blitzed the city of Portage near Kalamazoo on Tuesday night, destroying
homes and commercial buildings, including a FedEx facility that was
ripped apart. </p>
<p>No serious injuries were immediately reported, but city officials
said in a news release that the twisters knocked out power to more than
20,000 people. Most of them would be without power until late Wednesday,
city officials said. </p>
<p>At one point, about 50 people were trapped inside the FedEx facility
because of downed power lines. But company spokesperson Shannon Davis
said late Tuesday that “all team members are safe and accounted
for.” </p>
<p>More than 30,000 customers were without power in Michigan early
Wednesday, and an additional 10,000 in Ohio, according to
PowerOutage.us. </p>
<p>Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four
counties. </p>
<p>“My heart goes out to all those impacted by tonight’s severe weather
in southwest Michigan,” Whitmer said in a message on social media.
“State and local emergency teams are on the ground and working together
to assist Michiganders.” </p>
<p>National Weather Service crews were working Wednesday to survey storm
damage in several counties in Michigan’s southwest Lower Peninsula to
determine whether tornadoes touched down in those areas, including the
two reported Tuesday night in the city of Portage, said meteorologist
Mike Sutton with the weather service’s Grand Rapids office. </p>
<p>He said the Grand Rapids office had received a total of 11 reports of
tornadoes from storm spotters, emergency managers and the public from
late Tuesday afternoon into Tuesday night, but as of 8 a.m. Wednesday,
it had not confirmed any tornado touchdowns. </p>
<p>Sutton said it could be a couple days before the storm surveys are
completed and he stressed that some of the tornado reports could be
duplicate reports passed along by people who saw the same storm. </p>
<p>“It’s quite possible those are multiple reports from the same
tornado. The actual number of tornadoes may be lower depending on what
they find when they’re out surveying,” he said. </p>
<p>Tuesday’s storms came a day after parts of the central United States
were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters. Both the
Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring. </p>
<p>Across the U.S., the entire week is looking stormy. The Midwest and
the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the
rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville,
St. Louis and Cincinnati — cities where more than 21 million people
live. It should be clear over the weekend. </p>
<p>Oklahoma’s recent twisters</p>
<p>On Monday night, a deadly twister in Oklahoma tore through the
1,000-person town of Barnsdall. At least one person was killed. and
another was missing. Dozens of homes were destroyed. </p>
<p>Aerial videos showed homes reduced to piles of rubble and others with
roofs torn off. The twister tossed vehicles, downed power lines and
stripped limbs and bark from trees across the town. A 160-acre
(65-hectare) wax manufacturing facility in the community also sustained
heavy damage. </p>
<p>It was the second tornado to hit Barnsdall in five weeks — a twister
on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph)
damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles. </p>
<p>At the Hampton Inn in nearby Bartlesville, several splintered
two-by-fours were driven into the building. Chunks of insulation,
twisted metal and other debris were scattered over the lawn, and
vehicles in the parking lot were heavily damaged, with blown-out
windows. </p>
<p>Hotel guest Matthew Macedo said he was ushered into a laundry room to
wait out the storm. </p>
<p>“When the impact occurred, it was incredibly sudden,” he said. </p>
<p>Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, who toured the twister’s damage Tuesday,
said it was rated by weather researchers as a violent tornado with winds
reaching up to 200 mph (322 kph). Stitt said he and legislative leaders
have agreed to set aside $45 million in this year’s budget to help
storm-damaged communities. </p>
<p>Areas in Oklahoma, including Sulphur and Holdenville, are still
recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without
power late last month.</p>

released, marks the end of the 8.0 branch</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-08, from: OS News</p>
<p>NetBSD 10 and NetBSD 9.4 were only recently released, leaving one
final branch to receive what will be its last update: NetBSD 8.3. NetBSD
8.0 was originally released in 2018, so this final release marks six
years of updates, which is a good track record, especially now that two
newer main releases are available to choose from. With 8.3 being the
final release, this means no more regular or security updates, pkgsrc no
longer supports the 8.0 branch either – so yeah, time to upgrade. NetBSD
8.3 brings various updates and bug fixes for libX11, xterm, tmux, and
httpd, and the root name servers and time zone data have been updated to
their latest iterations as well. There’s of course a full list of
changes to peruse through if you want to know every little detail that’s
changed. You can update your installation in-place, of course, or
download the installation media for 8.3 from one of the many
mirrors.</p>

id="georgia-appeals-court-agrees-to-review-ruling-allowing-fani-willis-to-stay-on-trump-election-case">Georgia
appeals court agrees to review ruling allowing Fani Willis to stay on
Trump election case</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ATLANTA — A Georgia appeals court on Wednesday agreed to review a
lower court ruling allowing Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis
to continue to prosecute the election interference case she brought
against former President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Trump and some other defendants in the case had tried to get Willis
and her office removed from the case, saying her romantic relationship
with special prosecutor Nathan Wade created a conflict of interest.
Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee in March found that no conflict of
interest existed that should force Willis off the case, but he granted a
request from Trump and the other defendants to seek an appeal of his
ruling from the Georgia Court of Appeals.</p>
<p>That intermediate appeals court agreed on Wednesday to take up the
case. Once it rules, the losing side could ask the Georgia Supreme Court
to consider an appeal.</p>
<p>The appeals court’s decision to consider the case seems likely to
cause a delay in a case and further reduce the possibility that it will
get to trial before the November general election, when Trump is
expected to be the Republican nominee for president.</p>
<p>In his order, McAfee said he planned to continue to address other
pretrial motions “regardless of whether the petition is granted … and
even if any subsequent appeal is expedited by the appellate court.” But
Trump and the others could ask the Court of Appeals to stay the case
while the appeal is pending.</p>

Electricity Review from climate think tank Ember</a> is positively
brimming with encouraging data about the growth of renewables. The
topline takeaway? Rapid expansion of wind and solar projects in 2023
likely brought the peak in global power sector emissions, and a “new era
of falling fossil fuel generation is imminent.” Key findings and
projections:

<ul>
<li>
Renewables – mainly solar and wind – provided <strong>more than 30% of
the world’s electricity </strong>last year for the first time.

generation. Wind and solar generation are<strong> growing faster than
any electricity source in history</strong>. (A separate

out yesterday from the U.S. Energy Information Administration found that
renewables – especially solar – will cover most of the nation’s
electricity growth this year.)
</li>
<li>
<span></span>More than half of last year’s additions to solar and wind
capacity were <strong>in China</strong>.
</li>
<li>
<span></span>Hydropower fell due to drought, boosting coal generation.
Had this not been the case, emissions from the power sector
<strong>would already have peaked. </strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong></strong><strong>EVs, heat pumps, electrolysers, air
conditioning, and data centers</strong> are key drivers of electricity
demand growth.
</li>
<li>
<span></span>Power sector <strong>emissions are expected to fall in
2024.</strong> Clean energy growth is forecast to easily cover the
expected rise in electricity demand in 2024.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<span></span>“The renewables future has arrived,” said Dave Jones,
Ember’s director of global insights. “Solar, in particular, is
accelerating faster than anyone thought possible. The decline of power
sector emissions is now inevitable. 2023 was likely the pivot point –
peak emissions in the power sector – a major turning point in the
history of energy.” But… clean electricity growth has to continue to
speed up if we are to meet the COP28 goal of tripling renewables by 2030
to 60% of global supply. In the immortal words of Jeff Goldblum,
“<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LY8P--R9L4Y&ab_channel=LoveMovieQuotes" target="_blank">must

willingness to engage Pyongyang exposes rare rift with Seoul</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Biden administration’s apparent willingness to
engage North Korea is causing a rare public rift with one of
Washington’s key allies in Asia over how to achieve Pyongyang’s
denuclearization.</p>
<p>Last week, the two allies, on separate occasions, showed differences
about whether to consider “interim steps” toward North Korea’s complete
denuclearization.</p>
<p>South Korean national security adviser Chang Ho-jin said, “U.S.
senior officials confirmed several times that there are no such thing as
interim steps” toward denuclearization. He made the remarks in an
interview with South Korean media outlet KBS, aired on April 27.</p>
<p>A U.S. National Security Council spokesperson confirmed in an email
to VOA’s Korean Service on April 30 that “by saying that the United
States is willing to consider interim steps, we are making clear that we
recognize that building trust with the DPRK and making progress toward
denuclearization will take time.”</p>
<p>The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) is North Korea’s
official name.</p>
<p>In response to the NSC spokesperson’s comments, a South Korean
Foreign Ministry spokesperson told VOA Korean on May 1 that Chang’s
remarks “reaffirm that the U.S. will not put aside complete
denuclearization while it settles for a stopgap measure limiting
[negotiations] to a nuclear freeze in return for sanctions relief.”</p>
<p>Taking interim steps toward denuclearization involves reciprocal
concessions or corresponding measures that both sides are willing to
make to reach that goal.</p>
<p>Interim steps toward denuclearization are not a new approach. The
approach was tried and failed by the former Clinton and George W. Bush
administrations when North Korea was engaged in negotiations with the
U.S.</p>
<p>In March of this year, senior U.S. officials expressed Washington’s
interest in considering “interim steps” amid talks that remained stalled
with Pyongyang since October 2019.</p>
<p>A State Department spokesperson told VOA Korean in April that it made
multiple attempts to communicate with North Korean officials, but that
Pyongyang has not shown interest in engaging.</p>
<p>Experts said Seoul is concerned that Washington’s mention of interim
steps and measures that could be included in those steps, especially
threat reduction, could hinder Pyongyang from making a commitment toward
complete denuclearization in future negotiations.</p>
<p>Andrew Yeo, the SK-Korea Foundation chair in Korea Studies at
Brookings Institution’s Center for Asia Policy Studies, said, “Seoul
prefers not to engage in any diplomatic negotiations without a DPRK
commitment to denuclearization and wants to appear resolute.”</p>
<p>“Washington has signaled to North Korea that it’s willing to be more
flexible when it comes to restarting diplomatic engagement with North
Korea. Seoul may not want to give the appearance of that flexibility so
is perhaps denying any legitimacy behind an ‘interim steps’ approach,”
he added.</p>
<p>Seoul has taken a tough stance on North Korea under President Yoon
Suk Yeol since he took office two years ago by focusing on deterrence
and alignment with Washington and U.S.-led trilateral security
cooperation with Japan.</p>
<p>Evans Revere, a State Department official with extensive experience
negotiating with North Korea, said some critics and officials in Seoul
and Tokyo are worried that the U.S. will focus on other goals Washington
mentioned such as confidence building and tension reduction rather than
on denuclearization.</p>
<p>“There is also concern that Washington may be prepared to engage in
arms control talks with Pyongyang — a move that would generate deep
concern among U.S. allies, in large part because it would effectively
accept North Korea’s nuclear arsenal as permanent,” he said.</p>
<p>Talks over arms control or “nuclear freeze” that Seoul said it is
concerned about or “threat reduction” or “risk reduction” mentioned by
U.S. officials in March — which could be included in the interim steps —
are considered equivalent to accepting North Korea as a nuclear state
and opposed by some officials and analysts.</p>
<p>At an event held by the Center for Strategic and International
Studies (CSIS) on March 3, Mira Rapp-Hooper, senior director for East
Asia and Oceania at the National Security Council, said the U.S. will
discuss threat reduction with North Korea as it considers interim steps
on the “pathway to denuclearization.”</p>
<p>Also at an event by CSIS on March 18, Jung Pak, a U.S. senior
official for North Korea, said Washington wants North Korea to take risk
reduction steps and discuss sanctions and confidence-building measures.
 </p>
<p>Victor Cha, senior vice president for Asia and Korea chair at CSIS,
however, said that Rapp-Hooper’s reference to “the formulation of
interim measures to reduce the threat on the peninsula” in March
“reflects the same pragmatic view that any negotiation has to start at
step 1 — whether you call that interim measures or initial
denuclearization.”</p>
<p>“As a former negotiator, I can say that any pragmatic implementation
of denuclearization would have to include such steps, which I do not
think would represent de facto acceptance of DPRK nuclear status — that
is neither Washington, nor Seoul’s policy,” he said.</p>
<p>Cha formerly served as deputy head of delegation for the U.S. at
six-party denuclearization talks.</p>

Putting the EV Transition in Peril</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-08, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjE4Njg5Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0MTQ3OTM0M30.Sl_xbOpUFljDe0tLd4sZ-IL0WPIh6tXzpEWD4_VX8Vw/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Tesla is now facing its worst crisis in years. Last week, CEO Elon Musk
laid off the automaker’s roughly 500-person Supercharger team and what
remained of its policy and new vehicle teams. Before that, it reported
its first-quarter financial results — and they were even worse than the
lackluster performance that investors were expecting.
</p>
<p>
Already this year, Tesla has cut around 10% of its employees. Now Musk
is promising that it will shift toward becoming an “AI” company. And on
Wednesday — after we recorded this episode — Reuters
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/shift-key-episode-15-tesla-elon-musk" target="_blank">reported</a>
that the Justice Department is investigating Tesla for lying about its
so-called Full Self Driving software to investors.
</p>
<p>
Does Tesla, long a stalwart of America’s EV transition, now pose a
danger to it? On this week’s episode of Shift Key, Rob and Jesse discuss
the automaker’s turn away from EVs, and why Musk’s decision to lay off
the Supercharger team could throw the entire country’s EV transition off
track. Shift Key is hosted by Robinson Meyer, the founding executive
editor of Heatmap, and Jesse Jenkins, a professor of energy systems
engineering at Princeton University.

Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Jesse Jenkins:</strong> I just want to note one thing you said
there, which is the role of the [National Electric Vehicle
Infrastructure] funding. So the government funding here required that
any recipient of the federal infrastructure funding would be open to
multiple automakers’ vehicles. So you could not, Tesla could not have
kept its network closed and received any of the federal money.<br/>
<br/> And so it is interesting to think like, you know: If NEVI hadn’t
existed, I’m not sure if Tesla would have made that pivot. So it’s
interesting, this is an example of where government funding and
requirements can really open up standards and, you know, kind of force
change. So maybe it was they thought they had to do it in order to stay
competitive, to get a chunk of that federal infrastructure funding. And
maybe they would have been better off if they just kept a closed network
and ignored the shiny pot of money that the federal government was out
there … it’s hard to say, at this point. <br/> <br/> <strong>Robinson
Meyer:</strong> There’s a second aspect of this, though, that I think is
also confusing, which is basically that if Tesla — over the next year,
every American who drives an electric vehicle is going to encounter a
Tesla Supercharger for the first time, whether or not they own a Tesla,
right? Because they’re, the vehicle they own is going to be integrated
into the Tesla network and they’re going to be able to charge.<br/>
<br/> That is such a sales opportunity for Tesla. Tesla needed to nail
that integration, first of all, and execution, because these are not
hard customers to convince to buy a Tesla. These are customers who
already own an electric vehicle. And so if they’re coming to your
Supercharger network, and they’re like, ‘This is an amazing network.
This, like, works so much better than any other network. This works
better than the chargers that my automaker wants to direct me to that
aren’t Tesla, whether they be Electrify America or something else,’ that
would have been an incredible marketing and sales opportunity for Tesla
to convert drivers who already had chosen to go electric. <br/> <br/>
There’s not a better market out there. There’s not a more accessible
market out there for them than people who already drive an EV and are
thinking about their next EV purchase. And so it has now, if nothing
else, guaranteed that the next year will feel chaotic. Maybe, through
some miracle, the Supercharger network keeps working, and it keeps
working pretty well. How they’re going to manage that with no remaining
team, I don’t really understand — but let’s say it keeps working pretty
well. They’ve really fumbled an opportunity to make Tesla seem like the
easiest and most secure and most reliable, you know, value proposition
out there for drivers. <br/> <br/> And I think that’s just … that’s
happened now. That’s water under the bridge. They’ve really screwed this
up, no matter what else happens over the next year. <span></span>

<h2 id="us-inquiry-finds-widespread-sexual-misconduct-at-fdic">US
inquiry finds widespread sexual misconduct at FDIC</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation must make
sweeping changes to address widespread sexual harassment and other
misconduct, according to an independent report released on Tuesday that
raises questions about the future of the banking regulator’s
leadership.</p>
<p>The report, prompted by a Wall Street Journal investigation, cited
accounts from more than 500 people, including some who alleged FDIC
Chair Martin Gruenberg had engaged in bullying and verbal abuse.</p>
<p>Overall, the report by law firm Cleary Gottlieb paints a picture of
an agency at which sexual harassment, racial discrimination and bullying
were pervasive at every level and tolerated by senior leaders for years,
while complaints about misconduct were met with retaliation.</p>
<p>“For far too many employees and for far too long, the FDIC has failed
to provide a workplace safe from sexual harassment, discrimination, and
other interpersonal misconduct,” the report said, adding that those
accused of misconduct were frequently reassigned new roles.</p>
<p>Underscoring the agency’s toxic culture, officials tasked with
addressing the problems exposed by the WSJ reports were themselves the
subject of misconduct claims, the Cleary Gottlieb report found.</p>
<p>The findings sparked renewed calls for the ouster of Gruenberg, a
Democrat who has been a senior leader at the agency for nearly two
decades.</p>
<p>Representative Patrick McHenry, a Republican who chairs the House
Financial Services Committee, called for Gruenberg’s resignation
following the report, saying it made clear the agency needs new
leadership.</p>
<p>“The FDIC needs to be fixed. The women and men who work there deserve
better,” Sherrod Brown, chair of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban
Affairs Committee, said in a statement. “Chair Gruenberg must accept
responsibility and must immediately work to make fundamental changes to
the agency and its culture.”</p>
<p>Some employees described Gruenberg as “harsh” and “aggressive,” as
well as prone to losing his temper, the report said. In speaking with
investigators, Gruenberg said he never recalled acting inappropriately.
The report said some employees reported positive interactions with him
and saw his nature as more “prosecutorial.”</p>
<p>In a statement to staff, Gruenberg said the report was “sobering” and
he vowed to implement its recommendations.</p>
<p>He said he was ultimately responsible for everything that happened at
the agency and apologized for any shortcomings. “I again want to express
how very sorry I am,” he added.</p>
<p>The report recommends the appointment of new officials devoted to
changing the FDIC’s culture and hiring an independent third party to
assist in the transition, although it did not consider whether top
leaders should resign.</p>
<p>It also called on the agency to establish an anonymous hotline to
report misconduct and abuse, develop a more timely and transparent
process for handling complaints, and take steps to ensure victims are
protected and supported.</p>
<p>While the report found that Gruenberg’s aggressive conduct was not a
root cause of the more severe issues at the agency, it was skeptical of
his ability to oversee the necessary dramatic overhaul.</p>
<p>“As the FDIC faces a crisis relating to its workplace culture,
Chairman Gruenberg’s reputation raises questions about the credibility
of the leadership’s response to the crisis and the ‘moral authority’ to
lead a cultural transformation,” the report stated.</p>
<p>The departure of Gruenberg, who was appointed by President Joe Biden
in 2022, could imperil the administration’s efforts to impose stricter
financial rules, including a pending regulatory proposal on bank capital
requirements, which has sparked a backlash from Republicans and industry
representatives.</p>
<p>A White House spokesperson did not respond to a request for
comment.</p>
<p>If Gruenberg steps down or is removed, agency bylaws stipulate that
FDIC Vice Chair Travis Hill, a Republican, take over, and the agency’s
board would be evenly split between Republicans and Democrats.</p>

<h2 id="us-holds-up-some-arms-to-israel-sources-say">US holds up some
arms to Israel, sources say</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration has been
holding up certain Boeing-made arms shipments to Israel, four sources
familiar with the matter told Reuters, in what two of them said was an
apparent political message to the close U.S. ally.</p>
<p>The shipments, which have been delayed for at least two weeks,
involved Boeing-made Joint Direct Attack Munitions, which convert dumb
bombs into precision-guided ones, as well as Small Diameter Bombs.</p>
<p>The sources did not elaborate further, including on the political
nature of the holdups. But they come at a time when Washington is
publicly pressuring Israel to postpone its planned offensive in Rafah
until after it has taken steps to avert civilian casualties.</p>
<p>The White House and Pentagon declined comment. The news of a delayed
arms shipment was first reported by Axios over the weekend and Politico
first reported on the types of arms delayed and the reasoning on
Tuesday.</p>
<p>Without addressing whether there had been a holdup in arms shipments,
White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre reaffirmed that
Washington’s commitment to Israel’s security was “ironclad.”</p>
<p>Still, when asked about the reports on the arms holdups, she added:
“Two things could be true, in the sense of having those conversations,
tough, direct conversations with our counterparts in Israel … in making
sure citizens lives are protected … and getting that commitment.”</p>
<p>The Pentagon said on Monday that there had not been a policy decision
to withhold arms from Israel, America’s closest Middle East ally.</p>
<p>Still, the delays appeared to be the first since Biden’s
administration offered its full support to Israel following Hamas’
Oct. 7 attack, during which about 1,200 people were killed and about 250
others were abducted. About 133 of them are believed to remain in
captivity in Gaza, according to Israeli tallies.</p>
<p>Israel’s campaign to destroy Hamas has led to a seven-month-long
military campaign that has killed a total of 34,789 Palestinians, most
of them civilians, the Gaza Health Ministry said.</p>
<p>The conflict has also left many of Gaza’s 2.3 million people on the
brink of starvation and sparked protests in the U.S. demanding that
universities and Biden withdraw support for Israel - including the
provision of weaponry.</p>
<p>A senior Israeli official, speaking to Reuters on condition of
anonymity, did not confirm any specific holdup in arms supplies but
appeared to take the reports in stride: “As the prime minister has
already said, if we have to fight with our fingernails, then we’ll do
what we have to do.”</p>

soldier detained in Russia; White House says 2nd American newly
detained</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PENTAGON — The U.S. Army has confirmed that a U.S. soldier was
arrested last week during an unauthorized visit to the Russian far
eastern port city of Vladivostok, one of two recently detained Americans
in Russia.</p>
<p>Army spokeswoman Cynthia Smith said Tuesday Staff Sergeant Gordon C.
Black had been stationed in South Korea and signed out on permanent
change of station leave on April 10 en route to Fort Cavazos, Texas.
Instead of returning to the continental United States, Black flew
through China to Vladivostok for “personal reasons.”</p>
<p>“Black did not request official clearance, and [the Department of
Defense] did not authorize his travel to China and Russia, Smith
added. </p>
<p>U.S. officials told VOA he appeared to have traveled to Russia to see
a woman whom he was romantically involved with.</p>
<p>Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters Tuesday
the Army is investigating the incident and that any leave to Russia was
“strictly prohibited,” according to the Department of Defense’s foreign
clearance guide.</p>
<p>The White House said on Tuesday it confirmed “two separate cases” of
U.S. citizens being detained in Russia, without identifying the second
detainee.</p>
<p>Russian officials identified the second American as William Russell
Nycum. He was detained 10 days ago in Moscow on petty hooliganism and
alcohol charges, according to the Russian state news agency
RIA-Novosti.</p>
<p>“The State Department is actively seeking consular access to both
individuals, neither of whom are in Russia on behalf or in affiliation
with the U.S. government,” White House press secretary Karine
Jean-Pierre told reporters.</p>
<p>A Russian Ministry of Interior official informed the U.S. Embassy in
Moscow on May 3 that Black was arrested a day earlier in Vladivostok for
theft of personal property. Smith said the Army has no further
information about the charge at this time and that Black will remain in
a pretrial detention facility until his next hearing. </p>
<p>According to RFE/RL a TikTok account of Black’s romantic partner,
Vladivostok native Aleksandra Vashchuk, contains numerous videos of the
couple together in South Korea. In one video, Black is wearing his U.S.
Army fatigues and kisses the camera of a woman, presumably Vashchuk, as
she speaks in Russian.</p>
<p>RFE/RL says Vashchuk refers to Black as her husband and
affectionately as “pindos,” a Russian slang word for Americans that
roughly translates to “Yankee punk.”</p>
<p>The Associated Press reports that unnamed officials say Black is
accused of stealing from his “girlfriend.”</p>
<p>The chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Representative
Michael McCaul, said he is “deeply concerned” by reports of the
detainment.</p>
<p>“Putin has a long history of holding American citizens hostage,”
McCaul said in a post shared on X. “A warning to all Americans — as the
State Department has said, it is not safe to travel to Russia.”</p>
<p>Among those being held are journalists Alsu Kurmasheva of RFE/RL and
Evan Gershkovich of The Wall Street Journal, who have been detained on
charges that they, their employers and their supporters reject as
politically motivated. </p>
<p>Also being held is Paul Whelan, who in 2020 was convicted and
sentenced to 16 years in prison on espionage charges, which he and the
U.S. government have repeatedly rejected.</p>

id="judge-postpones-trumps-classified-documents-trial-indefinitely">Judge
postpones Trump’s classified documents trial indefinitely</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The federal judge in Florida presiding over the
classified documents prosecution of former President Donald Trump has
canceled the May 20 trial date, postponing it indefinitely. </p>
<p>The order from U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon had been expected in
light of still-unresolved issues in the case and because Trump is on
trial in a separate case in Manhattan charging him in connection with
hush money payments during the 2016 presidential election. The New York
case involves several of the same lawyers representing him in the
federal case in Florida. </p>
<p>In a five-page order, Cannon said on Tuesday that it would be
imprudent to finalize a new trial date now, casting further doubt on
federal prosecutors’ ability to bring Trump to trial before the November
presidential election. </p>
<p>Trump faces dozens of felony counts accusing him of illegally
hoarding at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, classified
documents that he took with him after he left the White House in 2021,
and then obstructing the FBI’s efforts to get them back. He has pleaded
not guilty and denied wrongdoing. </p>
<p>Trump faces four criminal cases as he seeks to reclaim the White
House, but outside of the New York prosecution, it’s not clear that any
of the other three will reach trial before the election. </p>
<p>The Supreme Court is weighing Trump’s arguments that he is immune
from federal prosecution in a separate case from special counsel Jack
Smith charging him with plotting to overturn the 2020 presidential
election. Prosecutors in Fulton County, Georgia, have also brought a
separate case related to election subversion, though it’s not clear when
that might reach trial.</p>
