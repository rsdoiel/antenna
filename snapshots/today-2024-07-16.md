date: 2024-07-16, from: San Jose Mercury News

## J.D. Vance and a “much more populist economic mindset”

date: 2024-07-16, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>If the Trump/Vance ticket emerges the winner in November, what might a Vice President J.D. Vance&#8217;s perspective on the government&#8217;s role in business and trade look like?

## What to Know About Vance’s Climate Stance

Trump announces J.D. Vance as VP pick</h3><p>Donald Trump has tapped <em>Hillbilly Elegy</em> author and Ohio junior senator J.D. Vance as his 2024 running mate. In recent years Vance has become a vocal climate change skeptic, casting doubt on the role of carbon emissions in warming the planet. As <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/jd-vance-vp-esg?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-94_ZxsEZf0Cj9RmMe32EQTRNtHQ-fnUHEo0LzfVvokkCe1XufsydWTfWMexMEOF5CqeQr4" rel="noopener" target="_self">Heatmap’s Jeva Lange and Matthew Zeitlin write</a>, he is a champion of the fossil fuel industry, especially in his home state of Ohio, where his 2022 Senate campaign received generous backing from the oil and gas industry. He is also a prominent critic of the use of environmental, governance, and social standards in investing, otherwise known as ESG, which he has called “a racket to destroy what we still have so that a few people on Wall Street can make some money.”</p><p>Last year Vance introduced a bill that would repeal federal tax credits for EVs (<em><em>Electrek</em></em> <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/07/15/elon-musk-supports-new-vp-candidate-crush-tesla-sales-us/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-94_ZxsEZf0Cj9RmMe32EQTRNtHQ-fnUHEo0LzfVvokkCe1XufsydWTfWMexMEOF5CqeQr4" target="_blank">noted</a> that “Tesla’s stock erased 2% worth of gains following the VP pick announcement”), and another that would double maximum penalties for climate change protesters. He has called for greater exploitation of the Utica Shale, a geological formation that runs under Ohio, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and New York that contains an estimated <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/news/national-news-release/usgs-estimates-214-trillion-cubic-feet-natural-gas-appalachian-basin?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-94_ZxsEZf0Cj9RmMe32EQTRNtHQ-fnUHEo0LzfVvokkCe1XufsydWTfWMexMEOF5CqeQr4" target="_blank">3 billion barrels of oil and natural gas</a>. He has slammed President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act as “dumb” and said it only makes Americans poorer, but <em><em>The New York Times </em></em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/15/climate/jd-vance-climate-change.html?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-94_ZxsEZf0Cj9RmMe32EQTRNtHQ-fnUHEo0LzfVvokkCe1XufsydWTfWMexMEOF5CqeQr4" target="_blank">notes</a> that in the years since the IRA passed, Ohio alone has seen more than $12 billion in clean energy investment.</p><h3>2. Biden administration considers more drilling protections in Alaska</h3><p>The Biden administration may move to protect more land in Alaska’s National Petroleum Reserve from oil development, <em>E&E News</em> <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/biden-admin-weighs-new-drilling-restrictions-in-alaska/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-94_ZxsEZf0Cj9RmMe32EQTRNtHQ-fnUHEo0LzfVvokkCe1XufsydWTfWMexMEOF5CqeQr4" target="_blank">reported</a>. The 23-million-acre reserve holds millions of barrels of oil and is where the contentious Willow oil project, run by ConocoPhillips, will be located. Other oil and gas companies are also eyeing the region for exploration, but environmentalists <a href="https://apnews.com/article/alaska-drilling-petroleum-reserve-biden-1dd8c07d2ed6e902ee6ac6298e2eaade?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-94_ZxsEZf0Cj9RmMe32EQTRNtHQ-fnUHEo0LzfVvokkCe1XufsydWTfWMexMEOF5CqeQr4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">say</a> “the region’s outsized vastness and ecological value” should be protected. More than 40 Indigenous communities rely on the resources and wildlife in the reserve. Earlier this year the Biden administration restricted new oil and gas leasing on 13 million acres of the reserve, and will soon invite the public to weigh in on whether more land should be protected. The Trump administration opened most of the reserve to fossil fuel exploration efforts in 2020, but Biden reversed that move in 2022.</p><h3>3. Climate change could eventually be a greater influence than the moon on Earth’s rotation</h3><p>For billions of years, the gravitational pull of the moon has tugged at the Earth’s oceans and slowed the planet’s rotation. In this way, our nearest celestial neighbor has been the dominant influence on the length of our days.

The researchers estimate that if greenhouse gas emissions aren’t significantly reduced, the melting ice could lengthen days by 2.62 milliseconds a century by 2100. The melting is also altering the Earth’s axis of rotation, which is <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-024-01478-2?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-94_ZxsEZf0Cj9RmMe32EQTRNtHQ-fnUHEo0LzfVvokkCe1XufsydWTfWMexMEOF5CqeQr4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">changing the dynamics of the Earth’s core</a>. “We humans have a greater impact on our planet than we realize, and this naturally places great responsibility on us for the future of our planet,” said Benedikt Soja, professor of space geodesy at the Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering at ETH Zurich, and an author on the new research.</p><h3>4. CO2 sequestration startup backed by Sam Altman raises $37 million </h3><p>A carbon sequestration startup backed by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has raised $37 million in a Series A funding round led by Equinor Ventures.

<p>Yesterday, former President Donald Trump announced that Ohio Senator, author and venture capitalist J.D. Vance would be his running mate. But as a populist conservative, Vance’s economic views buck those of the traditional, Republican establishment. We&#8217;ll hear more. Also, we&#8217;ll hear about the Secret Service&#8217;s additional responsibilities besides protecting presidents and unpack how political turmoil and violence might affect the United States&#8217; position in the global business community.</p>

## The Dream of 24/7 Clean Electricity Gets a Funding Boost

date: 2024-07-16, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjY4NDMwMi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0ODY3NTM0M30.am5RQVjGVPAJHXxY3RJx1l6zoOJmDplm83_I9hs10OI/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p>The United Nations calls <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/24-7-clean-energy-hydrogen" target="_self"><u>24/7 carbon-free energy generation</u></a>, also known as hourly matching, “<a href="https://www.un.org/en/energy-compacts/page/compact-247-carbon-free-energy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>t</u><u>he end state</u></a> of a fully decarbonized electricity system.” It means that every kilowatt-hour of electricity consumed is matched with a zero-emissions electricity source, every hour of every day. It’s something that Google and Microsoft are aiming to implement by 2030, and it represents a much more significant climate commitment than today’s default system of annualized matching </p><p>So here’s a positive sign: LevelTen Energy, the leading marketplace for power purchase agreements, just raised $65 million in Series D funding, led by the investment firm B Capital with participation from Microsoft, Google, and Prelude Ventures, among others. </p><p>The money will help support LevelTen’s work with the <a href="https://www.leveltenenergy.com/alliance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Granular Certificate Trading Alliance</u></a>, a collaboration it started last December in partnership with the Intercontinental Exchange, a data firm that operates global financial marketplaces. Together they’re building a platform for trading and managing “granular certificates,” hourly-matched energy certificates that will help corporations — and ideally the electricity sector at large — move to 24/7 hourly matching. Other partners to the alliance include Google, Microsoft, and the energy companies AES and Constellation. </p><p>To date, LevelTen has facilitated over $15.8 billion in power purchase agreements, asset sales, and other clean energy transactions, totaling over 7 gigawatts of clean energy. Overall, the company has raised more than $125 million, with past investors including the My Climate Journey Collective as well as the investment arms of oil and gas companies such as <a href="https://www.leveltenenergy.com/post/series-c-funding" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Equinor and TotalEnergies</u></a>, which are adding renewables to their portfolios. </p><p>Bryce Smith, LevelTen’s founder and CEO, told me the platform will launch its first auctions for hourly-matched clean energy by the end of the year, with initial customers expected to be corporate partners like Google and Microsoft themselves. </p><p>“Corporates have been leading the way in a lot of respects and they're doing it again on the granular certificate front,” Smith said. He sees it as LevelTen’s job to get more industry players onboard by creating the transaction infrastructure to enable hourly matching. “So there's a bit of a ‘build it and they will come’ aspect to this,” he told me.</p><p>Realistically, though, it’s unlikely that the electricity industry will move towards 24/7 clean energy absent some serious incentives to do so. That’s why the Biden administration’s proposed <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/hydrogen-rule-biden-clean-energy" target="_self"><u>hydrogen tax credit rules</u></a> could be so powerful. They stipulate that to qualify for the largest IRA subsidies, clean hydrogen must be produced using a relatively new source of carbon-free electricity, generated within the <em><em>same hour</em></em> that it’s used and in roughly the same location. If these regulations aren’t deleted or seriously altered by this or another new administration (<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/hydrogen-tax-credit-rules" target="_self"><u>which they probably will be</u></a>), power grids would have until 2028 to set up new systems for hourly accounting, thereby laying the groundwork for 24/7 matching across the electricity sector at large. </p><p>That potential, tenuous and unlikely though it may be, has LevelTen excited, and the company is leaning hard into hydrogen. LevelTen is a founding member of <a href="https://h2di.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the Hydrogen Demand Initiative</u></a>, a coalition formed by the Department of Energy to ensure that the clean hydrogen produced by the <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/hydrogen-hubs-biden-pennsylvania-california-texas" target="_self"><u>seven designated hydrogen hubs</u></a> is actually sold. The DOE is allocating <a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-jumpstart-clean-hydrogen-economy-new-initiative-provide-market" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$1 billion to help catalyze demand</u></a>, and it’s up to H2DI to figure out how to distribute that. “A component of that is figuring out how to bring buyers and sellers together easily and smoothly,” Smith told me. “And that's the role that we play in creating a marketplace where buyers and sellers can find each other and execute.”</p><p>Smith is aware that a change in administration could very well mean <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/hydrogen-rule-biden-clean-energy" target="_self"><u>a change in the hydrogen tax credit rules</u></a>, potentially decreasing incentives for green hydrogen and making hydrogen produced from natural gas with carbon capture and storage (“blue hydrogen”) or hydrogen produced without CCS (“gray hydrogen”) more attractive. He said the LevelTen platform would likely support transactions that involve a “variety of hydrogen colors and technologies.”</p><p>“What's most important for us always is figuring out how to put a vital technology on the fastest track to scaling,” Smith told me. “And if that means accommodating different colors for some period of time, we have the end goal [of green hydrogen] always in mind.”</p><p>As LevelTen scales, it’s also working to get more utilities onto its platform. Smith told me that utility customers have, “really only fairly recently realized that their procurement needs around renewables are massive.”<em> </em>As the push to “electrify everything” gains momentum and data centers suck up more and more power, utilities are increasingly investing in renewable energy to meet their electricity needs, diversify their portfolios and respond to customer demand for clean power. “We're used to seeing really slow, fairly predictable demand and electricity growth from a utility perspective, and that's changing pretty dramatically,” Smith told me. </p><p>LevelTen currently operates in 29 countries across North America and Europe, and hopes to use its recent funding to expand into new regions. </p>

## Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation

date: 2024-07-16, from: Marco Arment blog

<p><center style="margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a href="https://marco.org/media/2024/overcast-rewrite-list.png"><img style="max-width: 45%; border: 1px solid #eee; border-radius: 8px; margin-right: 2%;" src="https://marco.org/media/2024/overcast-rewrite-list.png"/></a> <a href="https://marco.org/media/2024/overcast-rewrite-nowplaying.png"><img style="max-width: 45%; border: 1px solid #eee; border-radius: 8px; margin-left: 2%;" src="https://marco.org/media/2024/overcast-rewrite-nowplaying.png"/></a></center></p>

<p>Today, on the <strong>tenth anniversary</strong> of <a href="https://marco.org/2014/07/16/overcast">Overcast 1.0</a>, I&#8217;m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond.</p>

<p><strong>Like podcasts better than blog posts? <a href="https://atp.fm/596">Listen to ATP #596</a> for more!</strong></p>

<h3>What&#8217;s new</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Much faster,</strong> more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible.</li>
<li><strong>Modern design,</strong> optimized for easily-reached controls on today&#8217;s phone sizes.</li>
<li><strong>Improvements</strong> throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What&#8217;s not</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Most features.</strong> Overcast is still Overcast!</li>
<li><strong>The audio engine.</strong> It&#8217;s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!)</li>
<li><strong>The business.</strong> I&#8217;m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving <em>only</em> my customers.</li>
<li><strong>My principles.</strong> I always want to make the best podcast app, and I&#8217;ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What&#8217;s gone</h3>

<p><strong>Streaming.</strong> Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.<sup id="fnref:pMYQjMdU5streambugs"><a href="#fn:pMYQjMdU5streambugs" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is <em>much</em> more reliable.</p>

<p>Tapping a non-downloading episode will now open the playback screen, download it, <em>then</em> start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered.</p>

<p>On today&#8217;s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds.</p>

<p>And in the near future, I&#8217;ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don&#8217;t automatically download every episode.</p>

<h3>What&#8217;s next</h3>

<ul>
<li>The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon.</li>
<li>More options for downloading and deleting episodes.</li>
<li>Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.)</li>
</ul>

<p>And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade.</p>

<p>Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list!</p>

<h3>Why?</h3>

<p>Most of Overcast&#8217;s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s why there haven&#8217;t been many new features or changes in years.</p>

<p>You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn&#8217;t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted.</p>

<p>For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I&#8217;ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, <a href="https://github.com/marcoarment/Blackbird">Blackbird</a>, and modern Swift concurrency.</p>

<p>Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I&#8217;m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app <em>much</em> better.</p>

<p>Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s to the next one.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<hr />
<ol>

<li id="fn:pMYQjMdU5streambugs">
<p>Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content.&#160;<a href="#fnref:pMYQjMdU5streambugs" rev="footnote">&#8617;&#xFE0E;</a></p>

## Donald Trump enters Republican convention hall with a bandaged ear and gets a hero's welcome

date: 2024-07-16, from: VOA News USA

Milwaukee — Two days after surviving an attempted assassination, former President Donald Trump appeared triumphantly at the Republican National Convention's opening night with a bandage over his right ear, the latest compelling scene in a presidential campaign already defined by dramatic turns.


Delegates cheered wildly when Trump appeared onscreen backstage and then emerged in the arena, visibly emotional, as musician Lee Greenwood sang "God Bless the USA." That was hours after the convention had formally nominated the former president to head the Republican ticket in November against President Joe Biden.


Trump, accompanied by a wall of Secret Service agents, did not address the hall — with his acceptance speech scheduled for Thursday — but smiled silently and occasionally waved as Greenwood sang. He eventually joined his newly announced running mate, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, to listen to the night's remaining speeches, often with a subdued expression and muted reactions uncharacteristic for the unabashed showman.


The raucous welcome underscored the depth of the crowd's affection for the man who won the 2016 nomination as an outsider, at odds with the party establishment, but has vanquished all Republican rivals, silenced most conservative critics and now commands loyalty up and down the party ranks.




"We must unite as a party, and we must unite as a nation," said Republican Party Chairman Michael Whatley, Trump's handpicked party leader, as he opened Monday's prime-time national convention session. "We must show the same strength and resilience as President Trump and lead this nation to a greater future."


But Whatley and other Republican leaders made clear that their calls for harmony did not extend to Biden and Democrats, who find themselves still riven by worries that the 81-year-old question is not up to the job of defeating Trump.


"Their policies are a clear and present danger to America, to our institutions, our values and our people," said Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, welcoming the party to his battleground state, which Trump won in 2016 but lost to Biden four years ago.


Saturday's shooting at a Pennsylvania rally, where Trump was injured and one man died, were clearly in mind, but the proceedings were celebratory — a stark contrast to the anger and anxiety that had marked the previous few days. Some delegates chanted "fight, fight, fight" — the same words that Trump was seen shouting to the crowd Saturday as the Secret Service ushered him off the stage, his fist raised and face bloodied.


"We should all be thankful right now that we are able to cast our votes for President Donald J. Trump after what took place on Saturday," said New Jersey state Sen. Michael Testa as he announced all of his state's 12 delegates for Trump.


When Trump cleared the necessary number of delegates, video screens in the arena read "OVER THE TOP" while the song "Celebration" played and delegates danced and waved Trump signs. Throughout the voting, delegates flanked by "Make America Great Again" signs applauded as state after state voted their support for a second Trump term.




Multiple speakers invoked religious imagery to discuss Trump and the assassination attempt.


"The devil came to Pennsylvania holding a rifle," said Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina. "But an American lion got back up on his feet!"


Wyoming delegate Sheryl Foland was among those who adopted the "fight" chant after seeing Trump survive Saturday in what she called "monumental photos and video."


"We knew then we were going to adopt that as our chant," added Foland, a child trauma mental health counselor. "Not just because we wanted him to fight, and that God was fighting for him. We thought, isn't it our job to accept that challenge and fight for our country?"


"It's bigger than Trump," Foland said. "It's a mantra for our country."


Another well-timed development boosted the mood on the convention floor Monday: The federal judge presiding over Trump's classified documents case dismissed the prosecution because of concerns over the appointment of the prosecutor who brought the case, handing the former president a major court victory.


The convention is designed to reach people outside the GOP base


Trump's campaign chiefs designed the convention to feature a softer and more optimistic message, focusing on themes that would help a divisive leader expand his appeal among moderate voters and people of color.


On a night devoted to the economy, delegates and a national TV audience heard from speakers the Trump campaign pitched as "everyday Americans" — a single mother talking about inflation, a union member who identified himself as a lifelong Democrat now backing Trump, a small-business owner, among others.


Featured speakers also included Black Republicans who have been at the forefront of the Trump campaign's effort to win more votes from a core Democratic constituency.


U.S. Rep. Wesley Hunt of Texas said rising grocery and energy prices were hurting Americans' wallets and quoted Ronald Reagan in calling inflation "the cruelest tax on the poor." Hunt argued Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris didn't seem to understand the problem.


"We can fix this disaster," Hunt said, by electing Trump and sending "him right back to where he belongs, the White House."


Scott, perhaps the party's most well-known Black lawmaker, declared, "America is not a racist country."


Republicans hailed Vance's selection as a key step toward a winning coalition in November.


Trump announced his choice of his running mate as delegates were voting on the former president's nomination Monday. The young Ohio senator first rose to national attention with his bestselling memoir, "Hillbilly Elegy," which told of his Appalachian upbringing and was hailed as a window into the parts of working-class America that helped propel Trump.


North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, who had been considered a potential vice presidential pick, said in a post on X that Vance's "small town roots and service to country make him a powerful voice for the America First Agenda."


Yet despite calls for harmony, two of the opening speakers at Monday's evening session — Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and North Carolina gubernatorial nominee Mark Robinson — are known as some of the party's most incendiary figures.


Robinson, speaking recently during a church service in North Carolina, discussed "evil" people who he said threatened American Christianity. "Some folks need killing," he said then, though he steered clear of such rhetoric on the convention stage.


Opening night also did not pass without references to the 2020 election and Trump's repeated lies that it was stolen from him.


Trump's nomination came on the same day that Biden sat for another national TV interview as the president sought to demonstrate his capacity to serve another four years despite continued worries within his own party.


Biden told ABC News that he made a mistake recently when he told Democratic donors the party must stop questioning his fitness for office and instead put Trump in a "bull's-eye." Republicans have circulated the comment aggressively since Saturday's assassination attempt, with some openly blaming Biden for inciting the attack on Trump's life.


The president's admission was in line with his call Sunday from the Oval Office for all Americans to ratchet down political rhetoric. But Biden maintained Monday that drawing contrasts with Trump, who employs harsh and accusatory language, is a legitimate part of a presidential contest.


Inside the arena in Milwaukee, Republicans did not dial back their attacks on Biden, at one point playing a video that mocked the president's physical stamina and mental acuity.


They alluded often to the "Biden-Harris administration" and took regular digs at Vice President Kamala Harris — a not-so-subtle allusion to the notion that Biden could step aside in favor of his second-in-command.

## Biden, Trump call for unity in aftermath of Trump assassination attempt

date: 2024-07-16, from: VOA News USA

The White House — President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump on Monday made high-profile appearances, each man acknowledging in his own way how the weekend assassination attempt against Trump has reshaped both of their presidential campaigns.


Trump briefly appeared on stage at the Republican National Convention late Monday, a white bandage taped over his right ear where a bullet clipped him Saturday as he addressed a Pennsylvania rally. On Monday, the Biden administration announced a separate, independent investigation into the shooting, as the Federal Bureau of Investigation leads the main inquiry.


The stark differences between the two main presidential campaigns were further illuminated Monday, with Trump not uttering a word but entering the Milwaukee stadium to rapturous applause and a standing, cheering ovation sustained for the length of a very, very extended version of Trump’s signature campaign song, "God Bless the U.S.A."


Meanwhile, Biden spoke in cool, measured tones to NBC’s Lester Holt, saying that he still deeply disagrees with Trump, and with the “inflammatory” and “vicious” way Trump and his base communicate their grievances.




And asked whether he thought the shooting would change the trajectory of the presidential race:


“I don’t know,” he replied. “You don’t either.”


But the weekend’s events seem to have resolved the last political cliffhanger – the national debate over whether Biden’s poor, stumbling June debate performance against Trump meant he should step aside.


“I expect that Joe Biden has weathered the storm and this question about whether he should drop out is mostly in the rearview mirror,” said Jim Kessler, executive vice president for think tank Third Way. “But he needs to perform well.”


Biden, in the lengthy interview held at the White House after he canceled a planned Monday trip to Austin, aimed to distinguish himself from his rival in stark terms.


“Look, I'm not the guy that said I want to be a dictator on day one,” he said. “I'm not the guy that refused to accept the outcome of the election. I'm not the guy who said that he wouldn't accept the outcome of this election.”


Both men have called for unity in the wake of Trump’s shooting.


But analysts say that word may not mean what you think it means.


“They're both calling for unity,” said John Geer, a distinguished professor of political science at Vanderbilt University. “But I think their differences in the kind of concept are fundamental. And that's where the, I think the problem is going to break down. And so they're calling for it, but, in fact, it may well be partisanship in disguise.”


And the political divide between Americans is so bitter that advocacy groups are warning that it’s not just the candidates who need to cool it – voters need to do so as well.


“Stay passionate about the causes you care about and remain engaged,” said Will Fuller, of Pennsylvania-based Common Ground USA, in guidance sent to journalists Monday. “We face significant challenges that require us to fulfill the promise of opportunity for all Americans. But in that work, it’s essential to distinguish between advocating for our beliefs and fighting against each other.”

## Baltimore officials sue to block 'baby bonus' initiative that would give new parents $1,000

date: 2024-07-16, from: VOA News USA

BALTIMORE — Baltimore's mayor and city council have filed a lawsuit seeking to stop a proposal that would let voters decide whether to give all new parents a one-time $1,000 "baby bonus" meant to help alleviate childhood poverty from birth.


The complaint was filed Thursday, according to online court records. It came not long after organizers secured the necessary 10,000 signatures to bring the question to voters as a ballot initiative in November.


City leaders argue that the proposal is unconstitutional and should be blocked from the ballot because it would give voters too much say over legislative decisions, effectively "usurping those powers" from their elected officials.


An estimated 7,000 children are born in Baltimore each year, so the program would cost about $7 million annually. That amounts to roughly 0.16% of the city's annual operating budget, according to supporters. It wouldn't result in higher taxes, but it would be up to the city council to allocate the necessary funds.


The lawsuit claims that the charter amendment process is meant to address changes to the form and structure of government, not specific legislative or budgetary questions.


But supporters of the baby bonus say the lawsuit is a political power grab.


"We are fully confident the courts will reject this attack on democracy," the Maryland Child Alliance said in a statement posted to social media last week. The group was founded by Baltimore teachers advocating for legislation to alleviate child poverty.


They say more systemic change is needed on a national level to help lift families out of poverty, but giving new parents a modest financial boost could prove an important first step.


The proposal is loosely modeled on a program implemented this year in Flint, Michigan, where women receive $1,500 during mid-pregnancy and $500 per month for the first year after giving birth. Officials said the Flint program was the first of its kind in the U.S. Countries in Europe and Asia have experimented with larger cash payments, but those programs are meant to encourage people to have more kids, not address child poverty.


Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott's administration, which launched a guaranteed income pilot program targeting young single parents in 2022, said in a statement that he's "supportive of the proposed amendment's objectives" even though he wants it off the ballot.

## Border arrests plunge 29% in June to the lowest of Biden's presidency

date: 2024-07-16, from: VOA News USA

SAN DIEGO — Arrests for illegally crossing the border from Mexico plunged 29% in June, the lowest month of Joe Biden's presidency, according to figures released Monday that provide another window on the impact of a new rule to temporarily suspend asylum.


Arrests totaled 83,536 in June, down from 117,901 in May to mark the lowest tally since January 2021, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said.


A seven-day average of daily arrests fell more than half by the end of June from Biden's announcement on June 4 that asylum processing would be halted when daily arrests reach 2,500, which they did immediately, said Troy Miller, acting Customs and Border Protection commissioner.


"Recent border security measures have made a meaningful impact on our ability to impose consequences for those crossing unlawfully," Miller said.


Arrests had already fallen by more than half from a record high of 250,000 in December, largely a result of increased enforcement by Mexican authorities, according to U.S. officials.


Sharp declines registered across nationalities, including Mexicans, who have been most affected by the suspension of asylum, and Chinese people, who generally fly to Ecuador and travel to the U.S. border over land.


San Diego was the busiest of the Border Patrol's nine sectors bordering Mexico by number of arrests, followed by Tucson, Arizona.


More than 41,000 people entered legally through an online appointment app called CBP One in June. The agency said 680,500 people have successfully scheduled appointments since the app was introduced in January 2023.


Nearly 500,000 people from four countries entered on a policy to allow two-year stays on condition they have financial sponsors and arrive at an airport. They include 104,130 Cubans, 194,027 Haitians, 86,101 Nicaraguans and 110,541 Venezuelans, according to CBP.

## Biden says 'bull’s-eye' reference to Trump was a mistake

date: 2024-07-16, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — U.S. President Joe Biden said on Monday he made a mistake when he told supporters to put rival Donald Trump in a "bull’s-eye" in an effort to focus attention on his rival's behavior but said Trump regularly employed rhetoric that was inflammatory.


"It was a mistake to use the word," Biden said in an interview with NBC’s Lester Holt. "I meant focus on it, focus on what he's doing," Biden said.


On July 8, Biden, 81, spoke to some of his biggest donors and said they needed to shift the election campaign's focus from him and his poor debate performance to former President Trump, the Republican nominee in the Nov. 5 election.


"I have one job and that’s to beat Donald Trump ... We’re done talking about the debate. It's time to put Trump in the bull’s-eye," he said.


Some Republicans zeroed in on that comment as they blamed Biden for creating a climate that sparked the assassination attempt on Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday. Biden has repeatedly decried political violence.


The president has endured more than two weeks of questions about his political future, so far facing down calls to step aside as the Democratic presidential candidate after his poor performance against Trump in the debate on June 27 sparked a crisis within his party.


He reiterated in the interview that he is not leaving the race, while acknowledging that people's questions about his age were legitimate.


Biden also weighed in on Trump's selection of Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio as his running mate.


Asked by NBC's Lester Holt what Vance's selection said about Trump's values, Biden replied: "He's going to surround himself with people who agree completely with him." Biden, chuckling, also noted some of Vance's previously critical comments about Trump.


The president has sought to turn attention to his opponent, highlighting Trump's falsehoods, his refusal to accept the 2020 election results and his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.


"I'm not the guy that said I want to be a dictator on day one. I'm not the guy that refused to accept the outcome of the election," Biden said.


He said Trump had engaged in inflammatory rhetoric, citing the former president's comments about a bloodbath ensuing if he loses the 2024 election and making fun when former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi's husband Paul was attacked by an intruder with a hammer at their home.


"How do you talk about the threat to democracy, which is real, when a president says things like he says? Do you just not say anything because it may incite somebody?" Biden said. "I have not engaged in that rhetoric. Now ... my opponent's engaged in that rhetoric."


Biden, who is seeking to prove that he is fit to stand for reelection and govern for a second four-year term despite concerns about his age, noted that millions of people had voted for him to be the Democratic Party's nominee. "I listen to them," he said.

## Trump taps Ohio’s junior senator as his running mate

date: 2024-07-16, from: VOA News USA

Milwaukee  — Former U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday selected J.D. Vance, a senator from the Midwestern state of Ohio, as his running mate in November’s presidential election.


Trump made the announcement on his Truth Social media platform, saying he decided the Marine Corps veteran and Yale Law School graduate is “the person best suited” to become vice president of the United States.


Shortly after Trump’s naming of the 39-year-old Vance, the bearded senator took a victory lap on the floor of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee as thousands of delegates cheered.


Trump drew his own cheers late Monday as he made an appearance at the convention sporting a bandage on his right ear from an assassination attempt at his Saturday campaign rally.


Vance is expected to address the gathering on Wednesday, the night before Trump formally accepts the party’s presidential nomination for the third consecutive time.


“I think it was an excellent choice,” an excited Ginger Howard, a party national committeewoman from Georgia, told VOA on the floor of the convention. “I think they’re going to make a great team."


Just before boarding Air Force One at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, President Joe Biden, responding to a reporter’s question about Vance’s selection, termed the senator “a clone of Trump on the issues. I don’t see any difference.”


Biden’s reelection campaign was quick to elaborate, characterizing Vance as a willing servant to Trump’s more autocratic and regressive undertakings.


Trump, twice impeached and now a convicted felon for falsifying business records, picked Vance because he “will do what Mike Pence wouldn’t on January 6: bend over backwards to enable Trump and his extreme MAGA agenda, even if it means breaking the law and no matter the harm to the American people,” said Jennifer O’Malley Dillon, who chairs the Biden-Harris campaign.




Trump has downplayed the severity of the January 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol, framing it as a legitimate protest against what he claimed without evidence was a "stolen" 2020 presidential election. He has also criticized the subsequent federal investigation and prosecution of those involved, labeling it a witch hunt politically motivated by Biden, his opponent in a second consecutive election.


Biden’s running mate, Vice President Kamala Harris, is “fully prepared” to debate Vance under the format proposed by CBS News, according to the Democrats’ campaign.


“Trump’s VP pick is great news for wealthy Americans and terrible for everybody else,” Senator Elizabeth Warren told reporters on a Biden-Harris campaign conference call shortly after the former president’s announcement of his running mate.


“Social Security and Medicare cuts will bear down on seniors like an avalanche” if Trump and Vance are elected, predicted Warren. “Millions will face losing access to health insurance.”


Vance has emerged as a strong advocate of Trump and his hard-line policies, from immigration restrictions to cuts for social programs. But as was true of numerous other prominent Republicans when the New York real estate developer first ran for president eight years ago, Vance had been highly critical of Trump.


“Trump makes people I care about afraid. Immigrants, Muslims, etc. Because of this I find him reprehensible. God wants better of us,” Vance said on Twitter in October 2016. He subsequently deleted the tweet.


Vance, a venture capitalist before being elected a senator, first rose to prominence with his memoir Hillbilly Elegy, which was made into a Hollywood movie. The book and film chronicle his experiences coming of age in a struggling working-class family in the Appalachian region.


With his name aside Trump’s on the 2024 ticket, Vance immediately becomes the most prominent Republican to be passed the torch of a political party radically reframed by Trumpism.


Trump, if he is elected again and serves a full second term, would be 82 the day he leaves office.


Biden’s cognitive abilities at his current age of 81 have emerged as a major campaign issue and divided his own Democratic Party, with a growing number of prominent Democrats in and out of Congress calling for him to abandon his reelection bid in favor of a younger replacement.


“Trump wanted a younger candidate who can campaign and connect with working-class voters, especially in the Midwest. Vance is also the first millennial to appear as a major party nominee on a presidential ticket, representing a generational change in U.S. politics,” said Cayce Myers, a Virginia Tech professor of public relations.




Vance would become the second-youngest vice president in U.S. history if elected along with Trump. Democrat John C. Breckinridge was 36 when he took the oath of office as vice president on March 4, 1857, under President James Buchanan. Republican Richard Nixon, as President Dwight Eisenhower’s vice president, was 40 when he took on the role in 1953. Breckinridge failed in his subsequent quest for the presidency. Nixon was elected president in 1968 after a losing bid eight years earlier.


A survey of 3,000 U.S. adults conducted Monday by polling firm YouGov indicated a lack of strong opinions on Trump’s choice of Vance, particularly among political independents.




Asked if they had a favorable opinion of Vance, 43% of all respondents said they were not sure, compared to the equal split of 29% who said they had either favorable or unfavorable views.


Among respondents who identified as independents, 53% said they were not sure whether they viewed Vance favorably or unfavorably.


Self-identified Republicans had the highest views of Vance, with 33% selecting very favorable, while 46% of self-identified Democrats chose very unfavorable.

## 3 hikers die in Utah parks as temperatures hit extreme highs

date: 2024-07-15, from: VOA News USA

SALT LAKE CITY — Three hikers died over the weekend in suspected heat-related cases at state and national parks in Utah, including a father and daughter who got lost on a strenuous hike in Canyonlands National Park in extreme temperatures. 


The daughter, 23, and her father, 52, sent a 911 text alerting dispatchers that they were lost and had run out of water while hiking the 13-kilometer (8.1-mile) Syncline Loop, described by the National Park Service as the most challenging trail in the Island in the Sky district of the southeast Utah park. The pair set out Friday to navigate steep switchbacks and scramble through boulder fields with limited trail markers as the air temperature surpassed 38 degrees Celsius (100 degrees Fahrenheit). 


Park rangers and a helicopter crew with the Bureau of Land Management began their search for the lost hikers in the early evening Friday but found them already dead. The San Juan County Sheriff’s Office identified them Monday as Albino Herrera Espinoza and his daughter, Beatriz Herrera, of Green Bay, Wisconsin. 


Due to the jagged terrain, safety officials used a helicopter to airlift the bodies out of the park and to the state medical examiner Saturday morning, according to the sheriff's office. Their deaths are being investigated as heat-related by the local sheriff and the National Park Service. 


Later Saturday, first responders in southwest Utah responded to a call about two hikers “suffering from a heat-related incident” at Snow Canyon State Park, which is known for its lava tubes, sand dunes and a canyon carved from red and white Navajo Sandstone. 


A multi-agency search team found and treated two hikers who were suffering from heat exhaustion. While they were treating those individuals, a passing hiker informed them of an unconscious person nearby. First responders found the 30-year-old woman dead, public safety officials said. 


Her death is being investigated by the Santa Clara-Ivins Public Safety Department. She has not been identified publicly. 


Tourists continue to flock to parks in Utah and other southwestern states during the hottest months of the year, even as officials caution that hiking in extreme heat poses serious health risks. Earlier this month, a Texas man died while hiking at Grand Canyon National Park, where summer temperatures on exposed parts of the trail can reach over 49 degrees Celsius (120 degrees Fahrenheit).

## J. D. Vance Loves to Hate on ESG

While just four years ago he was saying that the United States has a “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/15/climate/jd-vance-climate-change.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>climate problem</u></a>,” he has since tacked hard to the right and become a champion of the fossil fuel industry, especially in his home state of Ohio, where his 2022 Senate campaign received <a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2023/09/05/jd-vance-is-one-of-the-top-recipients-of-oil-and-gas-money-now-hes-shilling-for-their-interests/" target="_blank"><u>generous backing from the oil and gas industry</u></a>.</p><p>While skepticism of anthropogenic climate change and support for oil and gas are nothing new for a Republican officeholder, where Vance has carved himself a particular niche is as a prominent critic of the use of environmental, governance, and social standards in investing, otherwise known as ESG. This is the idea that major investors would reward companies based on their adherence to a set of standards that often include climate-related targets and policies. </p><p>The supposed evils of ESG make a natural theme for Vance, one that melds traditional conservative support for business (and especially fossil fuels) and criticism of socially liberal — <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-vp-picks" target="_self"><u>sorry, woke</u></a> — elites into a more populist message than a typical Chamber of Commerce criticism of regulation. Or, as Vance himself put it to <em><em>Breitbart </em></em>in the days leading up to his election to the Senate in 2022, “ESG is basically a racket to destroy what we still have so that a few people on Wall Street can make some money.” (Somewhere along the line, his company also <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-01/woke-inc-author-s-firm-targets-blackrock-esg-investing" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>invested</u></a> in <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/republicans-weave-a-climate-conspiracy-at-the-final-debate" target="_self"><u>erstwhile Republican presidential candidate</u></a> Vivek Ramaswamy’s anti-woke asset management firm, according to <em><em>Bloomberg</em></em>.)</p><p>By the time he took office in January 2023, <em><em>Politico</em></em> was already calling Vance “<a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/eenews/2023/01/25/meet-j-d-vance-the-senates-new-anti-esg-warrior-00077784" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the Senate's new anti-ESG warrior</u></a>.” That July, <a href="https://www.vance.senate.gov/press-releases/senators-vance-lummis-marshall-to-introduce-legislation-to-establish-special-inspector-general-to-investigate-abuses-by-financial-sector-regulators/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>he sponsored a bill</u></a> alongside Wyoming’s Cynthia Lummis and Kansas’ Roger Marshall, Republican senators both, that would have appointed an inspector general inside the Treasury Department to “oversee allegations of regulatory abuse and misconduct by financial regulators and kneecap the ability of regulators to push left-wing policy goals through the federal regulatory system.”</p><p>Last year, Vance also wrote an op-ed for the <em><em>Marietta Times</em></em> arguing for greater exploitation of the Utica Shale, a geological formation that runs under Ohio, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and New York that contains an estimated <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/news/national-news-release/usgs-estimates-214-trillion-cubic-feet-natural-gas-appalachian-basin" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>3 billion barrels of oil and natural gas</u></a>.</p><p>Vance claimed in the op-ed that “in an effort to discourage investment in oil and gas companies, President Biden has weaponized the Securities and Exchange Commission to mandate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) scores on publicly traded companies.” (He also noted that “Utica Shale oil production increased by 65 percent in 2023” compared to the year prior, and that wells in Columbiana County in Southeast Ohio had “set new oil production records at the start of the year.”)</p><p>Admittedly, Trump’s decision to pick Vance as a running mate doesn’t seem likely to swing the general election needle too much in any one way or another (though it might mess a little with the <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-cabinet" target="_self"><u>cabinet position calculus</u></a>). So far on Monday, the choice has been generally well-received by Republicans, <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/07/15/rnc-live-updates-coverage/gop-raves-about-vance-00168386" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>including by the VP also-rans</u></a>. But with a direct and easy line to Trump, Vance would become <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/04/14/want-to-change-trumps-mind-on-policy-be-the-last-one-who-talks-to-him/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>one of the most influential</u></a> people in America in the case of a Republican win in November. </p><p>Even if ESG-bashing is kind of old news, it has the sort of <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/trump-evs-politics" target="_self"><u>culture-war zest</u></a> to it that Rubio’s <a href="https://www.rubio.senate.gov/rubio-introduces-bills-to-prevent-china-from-flooding-u-s-auto-markets/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>China hawkishness</u></a> and Burgum’s <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-burgum-pipeline-north-dakota-vice-president-ba0bbfa00984de04ab23624b963dc66f" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>carbon sequestration enthusiasm lack</u></a>. It’s the sort of alignment that makes the ticket seem almost obvious in retrospect — the Trump-Vance anti-woke, anti-ESG perfect match.</p>

## Who is J.D. Vance? Things to know about Trump's running mate

date: 2024-07-15, from: VOA News USA

COLUMBUS, Ohio  — Former President Donald Trump on Monday chose U.S. Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio to be his running mate as he looks to return to the White House.


Here are some things to know about Vance, a 39-year-old Republican now in his first term in the Senate:


Vance was born and raised in Middletown, Ohio. He joined the Marines and served in Iraq, and later earned degrees from Ohio State University and Yale Law School. He also worked as a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley.


Vance made a name for himself with his memoir, the 2016 bestseller "Hillbilly Elegy," which was published as Trump was first running for president. The book earned Vance a reputation as someone who could help explain the maverick New York businessman's appeal in middle America, and especially among the working class, rural white voters who helped Trump win the presidency.


"Hillbilly Elegy" also introduced Vance to the Trump family. Donald Trump Jr. loved the book and knew of Vance when he went to launch his political career. The two hit it off and have remained friends.


First elected to public office in 2022


After Donald Trump won the 2016 election, Vance returned to his native Ohio and set up an anti-opioid charity. He also took to the lecture circuit and was a favored guest at Republican Lincoln Day dinners where his personal story — including the hardship Vance endured because of his mother's drug addiction — resonated.


Vance's appearances were opportunities to sell his ideas for fixing the country and helped lay the groundwork for entering politics in 2021, when he sought the Senate seat vacated by Republican Rob Portman, who retired.


Trump endorsed Vance. Vance went on to win a crowded Republican primary and the general election.


Vance went from never-Trumper to fierce ally


Vance was a "never Trump" Republican in 2016. He called Trump "dangerous" and "unfit" for office. Vance, whose wife, lawyer Usha Chilukuri Vance, is Indian-American and the mother of their three children, also criticized Trump's racist rhetoric, saying he could be "America's Hitler."


But by the time Vance met Trump in 2021, he had reversed his opinion, citing Trump's accomplishments as president. Both men downplayed Vance's past scathing criticism.


Once elected, Vance became a fierce Trump ally on Capitol Hill, unceasingly defending Trump's policies and behavior.


A leading conservative voice


Kevin Roberts, president of the conservative Heritage Foundation, called Vance a leading voice for the conservative movement, on key issues including a shift away from interventionist foreign policy, free market economics and "American culture writ large."


Democrats call him an extremist, citing provocative positions Vance has taken but sometimes later amended. Vance signaled support for a national 15-week abortion ban during his Senate run, for instance, then softened that stance once Ohio voters overwhelmingly backed a 2023 abortion rights amendment.


On the 2020 election, he said he wouldn't have certified the results immediately if he had been vice president and that Trump had "a very legitimate grievance." He has put conditions on honoring the results of the 2024 election that echo Trump's. A litany of government and outside investigations have not found any election fraud that could have swung the outcome of Trump's 2020 loss to Democratic President Joe Biden.


In the Senate, Vance sometimes embraces bipartisanship. He and Democratic Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown co-sponsored a railway safety bill following a fiery train derailment in the Ohio village of East Palestine. He's sponsored legislation extending and increasing funding for the Great Lakes restoration and supported bipartisan legislation boosting workers and families.


Vance brings strengths at debating, fundraising


People familiar with the vice-presidential vetting process said Vance would bring to the Republican ticket debating skills, fundraising prowess and the ability to articulate Trump's vision.


Charlie Kirk, founder of the conservative activist group Turning Point USA, said Vance compellingly articulates the America First world view and could help Trump in states he closely lost in 2020, such as Michigan and Wisconsin, that share Ohio's values, demographics and economy.

## Biden orders Secret Service to protect RFK Jr. after Trump assassination attempt

date: 2024-07-15, from: VOA News USA

Washington — President Joe Biden has directed the U.S. Secret Service to protect independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., after the attempted assassination of Donald Trump, the Homeland Security secretary said Monday.


Kennedy is a longshot to win Electoral College votes, much less the presidency. But his campaign events have drawn large crowds of supporters and people interested in his message.


Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said Biden had directed the protection for Kennedy "both prior to and after the events of this past weekend."


The Secret Service is legally required to protect major party presidential and vice-presidential candidates and their families 120 days out from a general election, but third-party candidates are on an as-needed basis.


The Department of Homeland Security acknowledged in its 2024 budget overview that recent requests for candidate protection were coming in earlier than in the past.


Threats to political candidates are common, but law enforcement officials have said that there has been an uptick in violent rhetoric since the weekend attack at the Trump rally. Mayorkas said both Biden and Trump are "constantly the subject of threats."


"We are in a heightened and very dynamic threat environment," he said. 


With a famous name and a loyal base, Kennedy has the potential to do better than any third-party presidential candidate since Ross Perot in the 1990s. But he didn't participate in the first presidential debate on June 27. Both the Biden and Trump campaigns, who fear he could be a spoiler, bypassed the nonpartisan debate commission and agreed to a schedule that essentially left out Kennedy.


Kennedy, who last year challenged Biden for the Democratic nomination before launching an independent bid, has argued that his relatively strong showing in a few national polls gives his candidacy heft. Polls during the 2016 presidential campaign regularly put libertarian Gary Johnson's support in the high single or low double digits, but he ultimately received only about 3% of the vote nationwide.


Trump became the official Republican presidential nominee Monday after receiving the votes of enough delegates at the Republican National Convention. He was not seriously injured in the shooting over the weekend in Pennsylvania. There is an independent review of the attack underway.


Mayorkas said Trump's protection has been enhanced based on the "evolving nature of the threats to the former president" and his shift from presumptive nominee to nominee.

I&#8217;ve long been warning about the dangers of relying on just one browser as the bullwark against the onslaught of Chrome, Chrome skins, and Safari. With Firefox&#8217; user numbers rapidly declining, now stuck at a mere 2% or so &#8211; and even less on mobile &#8211; and regulatory pressure possibly ending the Google-Mozilla deal with makes up roughly 80% of Mozilla&#8217;s income, I&#8217;ve been warning that Mozilla will most likely have to start making Firefox worse to gain more temporary revenue. As the situation possibly grows even more dire, Firefox for Linux would be the first on the chopping block. I&#8217;ve received quite a bit of backlash over expressing these worries, but over the course of the last year or so we&#8217;ve been seeing my fears slowly become reality before our very eyes, culminating in Mozilla recently acquiring an online advertising analytics company. Over the last few days, things have become even worse: with the release of Firefox 128, the enshitification of Firefox has now well and truly begun. Less than a month after acquiring the AdTech company Anonym, Mozilla has added special software co-authored by Meta and built for the advertising industry directly to the latest release of Firefox, in an experimental trial you have to opt out of manually. This &#8220;Privacy-Preserving Attribution&#8221; (PPA) API adds another tool to the arsenal of tracking features that advertisers can use, which is thwarted by traditional content blocking extensions. ↫ Jonah Aragon If you have already upgraded to Firefox 128, you have automatically been opted into using this new API, and for now, you can still opt-out by going to Settings > Privacy &#38; Security > Website Advertising Preferences, and remove the checkmark &#8220;Allow websites to perform privacy-preserving ad measurement&#8221;. You were opted in without your consent, without any widespread announcement, and if it wasn&#8217;t for so many Firefox users being on edge about Mozilla&#8217;s recent behaviour, it might not have been snuffed out this quickly. Over on GitHub, there&#8217;s a more in-depth description of this new API, and the first few words are something you never want to hear from an organisation that claims to fight tracking and protect your privacy: &#8220;Mozilla is working with Meta&#8221;. I&#8217;m not surprised by this at all &#8211; like I, perhaps gleefully, pointed out, I&#8217;ve been warning about this eventuality for a long time &#8211; but I&#8217;ve noted that on the wider internet, a lot of people were very much unpleasently surprised, feeling almost betrayed by this, the latest in a series of dubious moves by Mozilla. It&#8217;s not even just the fact they&#8217;re &#8220;working with Meta&#8221;, which is entirely disqualifying in and of itself, but also the fact there&#8217;s zero transparency or accountability about this new API towards Firefox&#8217; users. Sure, we&#8217;re all technologically inclined and follow technology news closely, but the vast majority of people don&#8217;t, and there&#8217;s bound to be countless people who perhaps only recently moved to Firefox from Chrome for privacy reasons, only to be stabbed in the back by Mozilla partnering up with Facebook, of all companies, if they even find out about this at all. It&#8217;s right out of Facebook&#8217;s playbook to secretly experiment on users. This is what I wrote a year ago: I’m genuinely worried about the state of browsers on Linux, and the future of Firefox on Linux in particular. I think it’s highly irresponsible of the various prominent players in the desktop Linux community, from GNOME to KDE, from Ubuntu to Fedora, to seemingly have absolutely zero contingency plans for when Firefox enshittifies or dies, despite everything we know about the current state of the browser market, the state of Mozilla’s finances, and the future prospects of both. Desktop Linux has a Firefox problem, but nobody seems willing to acknowledge it. ↫ Thom Holwerda It seems my warnings are turning into reality one by one, and if, at this point, you&#8217;re still not worried about where you&#8217;re going to go after Firefox starts integrating even more Facebook technologies or Firefox for Linux gets ever more resources pulled away from it until it eventually gets cancelled, you&#8217;re blind.

## The AMD Zen 5 microarchitecture: powering Ryzen AI 300 series for mobile and Ryzen 9000 for desktop

date: 2024-07-15, from: OS News

Built around the new Zen 5 CPU microarchitecture with some fundamental improvements to both graphics and AI performance, the Ryzen AI 300 series, code-named Strix Point, is set to deliver improvements in several areas. The Ryzen AI 300 series looks set to add another footnote in the march towards the AI PC with its mobile SoC featuring a new XDNA 2 NPU, from which AMD promises 50 TOPS of performance. AMD has also upgraded the integrated graphics with the RDNA 3.5, which is designed to replace the last generation of RDNA 3 mobile graphics, for better performance in games than we&#8217;ve seen before. Further to this, during AMD&#8217;s recent Tech Day last week, AMD disclosed some of the technical details regarding Zen 5, which also covers a number of key elements under the hood on both the Ryzen AI 300 and the Ryzen 9000 series. On paper, the Zen 5 architecture looks quite a big step up compared to Zen 4, with the key component driving Zen 5 forward through higher instructions per cycle than its predecessor, which is something AMD has managed to do consistently from Zen to Zen 2, Zen 3, Zen 4, and now Zen 5. ↫ Gavin Bonshor at AnandTech Not the review and deep analysis quite yet, but a first thorough look at what Zen 5 is going to bring us, straight from AnandTech.

## The Hydrogen Tax Credit Rules Are Effectively Dead

date: 2024-07-15, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjY2NzQwOS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczNTQ0MDQwM30.YykibJQHawMYGn4PVj7qBYJVA5-O0iOTntB7T75D-fQ/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">Few aspects of Biden’s climate law have spurred more controversy than the “three pillars” — a set of rules proposed by the Treasury Department for how to claim a lucrative new tax credit for producing clean hydrogen. Now, it appears, the pillars may be poised to fall.</p><p>The Treasury has been under immense pressure from Congress, energy companies, and even <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/doe-sides-with-industry-on-hydrogen-tax-rules/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>leaders at the Department of Energy</u></a> to relax the rules since before it even published the proposal in December. The pillars, criteria designed to prevent the program from subsidizing projects that increase U.S. greenhouse gas emissions rather than reduce them, are too expensive and complicated to comply with, detractors argue, and would sink the prospects for a domestic clean hydrogen industry.</p><p>But lately, the campaign to dismantle the pillars has gotten both more forceful and more threatening. There’s the politically challenging hurdle that leaders of another federally-funded hydrogen program — the <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/hydrogen-hubs-biden-pennsylvania-california-texas" target="_self"><u>regional clean hydrogen hubs</u></a> — have spoken out against the rules, arguing they threaten investment in hub projects and therefore job creation and economic development around the country. Then there’s the recent <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/supreme-court-loper-corner-post" target="_self"><u>Supreme Court decision</u></a> to overturn the precedent known as Chevron deference, which weakened agencies’ ability to defend their own rules and thereby emboldens any aggrieved parties to sue the Treasury if it keeps the pillars in place. Last week, 13 Democratic Senators, 11 of whom hail from states involved in the hubs, sent a <a href="https://www.padilla.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/7.10.24-Letter-to-Secretary-Yellen-Section-45V-Credit-for-Production-of-Clean-Hydrogen.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>letter</u></a> calling on Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to dramatically revise the rules or risk having them challenged in court.</p><p>The consequences of losing the three pillars can only be guessed at using models, which are built on assumptions and can’t predict the future with certainty. But proponents say the stakes couldn’t be higher. In their view, the pillars don’t just prevent carbon emissions. They mitigate the risks of rising electricity costs for everyday Americans. And without them, one of the most generous energy credits the government offers could become incredibly easy to claim, ballooning the federal budget.</p><p>The clean hydrogen tax credit was created by the Inflation Reduction Act, and offers up to $3 per kilogram of hydrogen produced, with the top dollar amount reserved for fuel that is essentially zero-emissions. The hope was that this would be enough to bring down the cost of hydrogen made from electricity to parity with hydrogen made from natural gas. If made cleanly, hydrogen could help decarbonize other carbon-intensive industries, like steelmaking and shipping.</p><p>At first, excitement for the tax credit ran high and companies quickly began making plans for new factories. Announcements of new hydrogen production capacity more than tripled from 2 million tons per year in 2021 to 7.7 million by the end of the following year, with another 6 million announced in 2023, according to the energy consulting firm Wood Mackenzie.</p><p>Then, after the Treasury’s proposal dropped last December, everything stopped. Under the three pillars, hydrogen companies that get electricity from the grid, which is still largely powered by fossil fuels, would be required to buy clean energy credits with specific attributes in order to mitigate their emissions and render their hydrogen “clean.” The credits must come from power plants located in the same region as the hydrogen production — the first pillar — that were built no more than 3 years before the hydrogen plant — the second pillar — and be purchased for every hour the plant is operating — the third pillar.</p><p>The three provisions work together to ensure that new clean power plants are brought online to meet hydrogen’s energy demand. But finding clean energy credits with these features is not easy — there aren’t many systems in place to do this yet. The Treasury took more than a year to publish its initial proposal, and leading up to it, companies lobbied aggressively for a more lenient version. There was so much money on the line that some businesses flooded the public with ads in newspapers and on streaming and podcast services delivering a cryptic warning that “additionality” — the requirement to buy energy from new power plants — was threatening to “set America back.” </p><p>Until businesses have clarity on whether the three pillars will stay or go, the industry is on ice. Several previously announced projects have been delayed. Few companies have reached offtake agreements, even provisional ones, for their hydrogen. Almost none have received a final investment decision or started construction. </p><p>“They’re losing advantage over other parts of the world,” Hector Arreola, a principal analyst for hydrogen and emerging technologies at Wood Mackenzie, told me. Momentum to develop hydrogen projects has started to shift back to Europe, which has already finalized its own definition of what constitutes clean hydrogen, he said. </p><p>It’s hard to imagine a path forward for the Treasury to keep the three pillars intact. Last week’s letter outlined the current state of play in stark terms. “Without significant changes to the draft guidance,” it said, “one of the most powerful job creation and emission reduction tools in the IRA will likely be hamstrung by future court challenges, congressional opposition, and unfulfilled private sector investment.”</p><p>Indeed, at least one company, Constellation Energy, has already <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/constellation-prepared-to-visit-with-the-courts-about-proposed-hydrogen-t/713551/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>suggested it would draw on the loss of Chevron deference</u></a> to sue the agency if it didn’t remove the second pillar — the requirement to buy clean energy credits from recently-built power plants. (Constellation owns a fleet of nuclear power plants and is developing hydrogen projects powered by them.) In <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/IRS-2023-0066-29539" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>comments</u></a> to the Treasury, Constellation wrote that the requirements for purchasing clean electricity “have no basis” in the law.</p><p>“People can always sue today to challenge regulations,” Keith Martin, a renewable energy tax lawyer at the firm Norton Rose Fulbright, told me. “It’s just that the odds of success have increased.” The Supreme Court’s ruling undermines regulatory agencies’ authority to interpret federal statute.</p><p>Another hydrogen company that has been fighting the three pillars, Plug Power, has already claimed victory: It put out a <a href="https://www.ir.plugpower.com/press-releases/news-details/2024/Plug-to-Receive-Federal-Clean-Hydrogen-Production-Tax-Credit-at-Georgia-Hydrogen-Facility/default.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>press release</u></a> last month declaring that it anticipates receiving the tax credit, despite the fact that the rules are still not final and its projects would likely not qualify under Treasury’s proposal. The CEO, Andy Marsh, told a hydrogen trade publication that he’s <a href="https://www.h2-view.com/story/plug-power-ceo-certain-45v-hydrogen-tax-credit-rules-will-be-relaxed/2110336.article/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>“certain” the rules will be loosened</u></a>. (Plug Power didn’t respond to a request for clarification by publish time.)</p><p>In their letter, the 13 Democratic senators propose that hydrogen producers should be able to purchase clean energy from existing power plants that are already supplying the grid if they are located in a state that has a clean energy standard, or as long as the power plant doesn’t reallocate more than 10% of its power to hydrogen production. They recommend losing the hourly matching requirement altogether and replacing it with annual or monthly matching, depending on when plants start construction. The senators also suggest allowing projects built in areas with “insufficient clean energy sources,” meaning places with suboptimal sun, wind, water, or geothermal energy, to source their power from farther outside the region.</p><p>Beth Deane, the chief legal officer for Electric Hydrogen, a company that has historically supported the three pillars, told me in an interview she thought these proposals represented a good compromise. “Bottom-line, the effectiveness of green hydrogen as a decarbonization tool is being artificially held back,” she said later in an email. “We need to give up perfection on both sides of the three-pillar debate and find the ‘good enough’ solution that lets early mover projects move forward with less stringent requirements.”</p><p>But other proponents told me the letter carves out so many loopholes that the pillars would remain in name only. Rachel Fakhry, the policy director for emerging technologies at the Natural Resources Defense Council, told me the letter was “outrageous” and “a giveaway buffet.” Daniel Esposito, a manager in the electricity program at the think tank Energy Innovation, told me he can’t imagine any scenario where these exceptions don’t result in an emissions boost rather than a reduction.</p><p>That’s because the electrolyzers used to produce clean hydrogen consume a lot of power and are expected to cause fossil fuel plants — which are more flexible than renewables — to run more often and stay open longer than they otherwise would. Without a requirement to buy power from new clean sources and a prescription to match operations with clean energy throughout the day, there will be no demand signals to bring (often more expensive) clean resources onto the grid that can, for example, produce power at night when solar panels aren’t generating. Power system models from <a href="https://energyinnovation.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Smart-Design-Of-45V-Hydrogen-Production-Tax-Credit-Will-Reduce-Emissions-And-Grow-The-Industry.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Energy Innovation</u></a>, <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/acacb5" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Princeton University researchers</u></a>, the <a href="https://rhg.com/research/clean-hydrogen-45v-tax-guidance/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Rhodium Group</u></a>, and the <a href="https://www.epri.com/research/products/000000003002028407" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Electric Power Research Institute</u></a> have all found that there could be significant emissions consequences if the three pillars were relaxed in ways suggested in the letter.</p><p>“This effectively unlocks more than 10 million metric tons of dirty electrolytic hydrogen,” Esposito said, based on some back-of-the-envelope estimates. That would cost something like $30 billion per year. Put another way, he said, every $300 paid out by this program could subsidize one ton of CO2 emissions. Put a third way, he added, it could set the U.S. back two to three percentage points on its commitment under the Paris Agreement to reduce emissions 50% to 52% by 2030 — and we’re <a href="https://rhg.com/research/taking-stock-2023/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>already off track</u></a>.</p><p>The authors of the letter say they’re “confident” these fears are overblown. They cite a competing <a href="https://acore.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ACORE-and-E3-Analysis-of-Hourly-and-Annual-GHG-Emissions-Accounting-for-Hydrogen-Production.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>analysis</u></a> published last year by the consulting firm Energy and Environmental Economics and paid for by the trade group the American Council on Renewable Energy, which found that requiring companies to match their operations with clean energy on an hourly basis, rather than an annual basis, does not ensure lower greenhouse gas emissions<em><em>.</em></em> They also cite <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/energy/key-initiatives/open-energy-outlook/fueling-change-understanding-the-impacts-of-the-proposed-rule-for-hydrogen-tax-credits-on-greenhouse-gas-emissions.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>research by an energy modeling group at Carnegie Mellon</u></a> and North Carolina State University, which found that the difference in cumulative emissions between scenarios with less stringent requirements and the full three pillars comes out to less than 1% by 2039. </p><p>Paulina Jaramillo, a professor of engineering and public policy at Carnegie Mellon who worked on that research, told me the three pillars add a level of regulatory complexity to hydrogen production that is not worth the cost in terms of the emissions savings. In general, she said, she saw no need for the rules, and that the Treasury should subsidize electrolytic hydrogen regardless of where the electricity comes from. “We need to deploy this infrastructure,” Jaramillo told me. “We need to deploy it now so it’s available later.”</p><p>The other camp of researchers disputed Jaramillo’s group’s findings, chalking them up to a series of differences in assumptions and approach. They also call the industry’s bluff on the claim that the three pillars are too hard and expensive to comply with. Esposito pointed out that a small group of hydrogen companies has already <a href="https://hystorenergy.com/section-45v-notice-of-proposed-rulemaking/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>told the Treasury</u></a> that if the rules were finalized as-is, they planned to build enough capacity to produce more than 6 million tons of hydrogen per year. </p><p>Fakhry argued that we are already seeing the risks of losing the three pillars play out in real time as power-hungry industries like bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence grow. Bitcoin mines have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/09/business/bitcoin-mining-electricity-pollution.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>driven up emissions</u></a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02221" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>energy costs</u></a> around the country. Utilities in Pennsylvania are sounding the alarm that an Amazon data center seeking to divert power from an existing nuclear power plant could <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/aep-exelon-pjm-interconnection-amazon-data-center-talen-ferc-isa/719869/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>shift up to $140 million</u></a> in costs to other electricity customers. As I <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/biden-hydrogen-hubs-department-energy" target="_self"><u>wrote in Heatmap last year</u></a>, this debate is not just about hydrogen — think of all the other energy-intensive industries that will have to electrify before we can reach net zero. </p><p>Plenty of stakeholders still believe that the Treasury can find a middle ground by making the three pillars more flexible. The American Clean Power Association, which represents a wide range of energy companies, has proposed <a href="https://cleanpower.org/resources/45v-time-matching-acp-proposal/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>loosening the hourly matching aspect</u></a> for projects that start construction before 2028. Fakhry acknowledged the need for flexibility, but her recommendations are much more narrow than the senators’. For example, she would allow hydrogen producers to buy power from existing nuclear plants, but only if they are at risk of retirement and the purchase would help keep them open. Esposito said Energy Innovation would support power procurement from existing clean resources that are curtailed, meaning they produce power that currently goes unutilized. </p><p>Both Fakry and Esposito also downplayed the threat of lawsuits, arguing that Treasury did exactly what it was instructed to do by the law. The IRA specifically says that hydrogen emissions should be calculated per a section of the Clean Air Act that says any accounting should include “significant indirect emissions.” Treasury has interpreted this to include the induced emissions caused by a hydrogen plant, and received letters of support from the <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/45V-NPRM-EPA-letter.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Environmental Protection Agency</u></a> and <a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2023-12/Assessing_Lifecycle_Greenhouse_Gas_Emissions_Associated_with_Electricity_Use_for_the_Section_45V_Clean_Hydrogen_Production_Tax_Credit.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Department of Energy</u></a> backing this interpretation.</p><p>However, as Martin, the tax lawyer, told me, by overturning Chevron deference, the Supreme Court has just given “677 federal district court judges greater latitude to substitute their own judgment for subject matter experts at the federal agencies.”</p><p>Asked for comment on the Senators’ letter, a Treasury spokesperson told me the agency is still considering the many thousands of comments the agency received on the proposed rules. “The Biden Administration is committed to ensuring that progress continues and that the IRA’s investments continue to create good-paying jobs, lower energy costs, and strengthen energy security.”</p><p>Even if Yellen heeds the Senators’ advice, the department may not be able to avoid a lawsuit. “We will use every tool available to us — including the courts — to either defend a strong final rule or challenge an unlawful one that reflects the asks in the letter,” Fakhry told me.</p><p>There’s also a realpolitik argument here that the industry might want this all to be over more than it wants to kill the three pillars. “The number one thing people want is business certainty,” Esposito told me. “I don’t think people want this to drag on for another two years.”</p>

	The heat is not going anywhere anytime soon, so keep reading to discover how you might feel it this week.
</p><h3>Thousands are still without power in Texas with relief efforts ongoing </h3><p>
	Shawn Schulze, CEO of the American Red Cross Texas Gulf Coast Region, has been driving around Texas to coordinate relief efforts after Hurricane Beryl. On Sunday, he pulled over in his car to talk to me about what the situation is like on the ground.
</p><p>
	A week ago, power outages caused by the hurricane pushed over 2 million Texans into the dark during a record-breaking heat wave, seeing heat indexes above 100 degrees Fahrenheit throughout all of last week. 
	<strong>As of yesterday, utility CenterPoint Energy — which has drawn criticism from many, including </strong><a href="https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/hurricane/2024/07/14/493450/houston-power-outages-abbott-says-centerpoint-must-formulate-storm-plans-as-thousands-without-power/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><strong>Governor Greg Abbott</strong></u></a><strong>, over its response to the hurricane — had yet to restore power to over 320,000 clients.</strong> Schulze, a life-long Houston resident, got his electricity back on Sunday.
</p><p>
	Volunteers are even more in need as hospitals in Texas struggle to meet demand. Dr. Owais Durrani told 
	<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/13/us/video/houston-heat-wave-power-outage-doctor-intv-digvid" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>CNN</u></a> that <strong>hospital crowding in Houston is approaching levels not seen since the COVID-19 pandemic</strong>. To ameliorate the conditions in Texas, around 600 Red Cross volunteers from across the nation are stationed in Houston, providing thousands of hot meals, ice, and water, beyond helping maintain 16 emergency shelters.
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Looking Ahead: </strong>Later this week, an increased chance of rain and thunderstorms might help keep temperatures near average, alleviating some of the intense heat, AccuWeather Meteorologist Alex DaSilva told me. But the rain might also delay relief and reconstruction efforts in the wake of Beryl. “We’re going to continue to help people until the need stops,” Schulze said. </li>
</ul><h3>Cities in California break heat records, while farmers struggle to sustain production </h3><p>
	Northern California’s
	<strong> Stockton and Modesto hit 110 and 108 degrees respectively on Friday, surpassing records set in 1999. Sacramento has also now experienced its highest number of days above 110 degrees in a year.</strong> Also last week, temperatures in the <a href="https://heatmap.news/lifestyle/death-valley-temperature-tourism" target="_self"><u>Death Valley</u></a> inched closer to 134 degrees — the hottest temperature ever recorded on Earth.
</p><p>
	The dry and hot weather has been of particular concern for farmers in the state, which are struggling to meet demand. “The heat is really taking its toll on the people and our crops,” Garrett Patricio, president of Westside Produce in Northern California, told me. 
	<strong>Due to the heat, crops are reaching maturity earlier and work days are being cut short to protect the health of workers</strong>, driving up the costs of production.

</iframe></center><h3>Unprecedented wildfires with more to come </h3><p>
	On Thursday, 
	<em><em>The Guardian</em></em> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/11/california-wildfires-burn-damage" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reported</u></a> that <strong>wildfires in California have already burned five times the average area for this time of year</strong>. Communities in Oregon and New Mexico have also burned this summer. On Friday, Oregon Governor Tina Kotek declared a state of emergency as wildfires continue to scorch through the state.
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Looking Ahead:</strong> While monsoon activity will continue in the West, the amount of moisture available in the air will decrease, increasing the risk for thunderstorms that could spark new blazes this week. </li>
</ul><h3>Death toll rises </h3><p>
	The number of heat-related deaths this summer continues to climb, with most being reported in California and Oregon. In the past week, at least 28 people died, 
	<em><em>The Washington Post</em></em> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/07/10/heat-wave-us-death-toll/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reported</u></a>. That number has already grown.<strong> On Friday, Oregon </strong><a href="https://www.klcc.org/health-medicine/2024-07-12/death-toll-from-oregon-heat-wave-continues-to-climb" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><strong>announced</strong></u></a><strong> two more deaths, bringing its number up to 16. </strong>
</p><h3>More record-breaking heat heading east</h3><p>
<strong>Through Wednesday, the mid-Atlantic and Northeast can expect temperatures up to 12 degrees above the historical average for this time of the year.</strong> According to DaSilva, areas near Washington, D.C. and Baltimore might experience temperatures higher than 100 degrees. “Other areas in the Northeast can be in the 90s,” he told me. On Sunday, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu <a href="https://www.boston.gov/news/mayor-wu-declares-heat-emergency-july-15-17-opens-cooling-centers-all-residents#:~:text=To%20All%20Residents-,Mayor%20Wu%20Declares%20Heat%20Emergency%20July%2015%20%2D%2017%3B%20Opens%20Cooling,the%20upcoming%20extreme%20weather%20forecasts." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>declared</u></a> a heat emergency in the city until July 17.
</p><p>
	In the later portion of the week, DaSilva predicts that 
	<strong>a cold front will bring temperatures in the Northeast closer to — and in some areas even below — average.</strong> But, the change to a “cooler and less humid air mass,” might also bring along severe weather such as thunderstorms and heavy rainfall.
</p><h3>Drought conditions to persist in the South </h3><p>
	There’s good news and bad news for communities in the Southwest and across the Southeast, which have faced severe dry conditions. 
	<strong>While no drought-busting rains are expected for this week, “pop-up thunderstorms on a daily basis can provide localized benefits through midweek” in the Southeast, DaSilva told me.</strong> A potential cold front later this week could increase the chance of rain and further benefit the region’s current conditions.
</p><h3>Arab nations will struggle with heat, poor air quality </h3><p>
	Several Arab nations, including Iraq, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia, were hit by an 
	<a href="https://www.newarab.com/news/heatwave-threatens-iraq-gulf-nations-50degc-and-above?amp" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>intense heat wave</u></a> in early July, and extreme temperatures are expected to persist through this week. <strong>Amarah in Iraq, for example, might hit 127 degrees on Saturday, and most major cities in the country will see temperatures well above 110 multiple times this week.</strong> The weather conditions in the region are even more dangerous due to increased dust activity, causing the air quality to hit unhealthy levels.
</p><h3>Some relief heading toward northern Europe</h3><p>
	Poland’s top oil refineries have struggled to hit their production targets due to intense heat, 
	<em><em>Bloomberg</em></em> <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/2024/07/11/searing-heat-triggers-fuel-supply-worries-at-oil-refineries-in-europe-and-beyond/#:~:text=(Bloomberg)%20--%20Temperatures%20in%20Europe,104F" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reported</u></a>. Other countries in the region such as Austria, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia, were under<a href="https://crisis24.garda.com/alerts/2024/07/europe-high-temperatures-forecast-across-parts-of-east-central-europe-through-at-least-july-14" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u> heat warnings</u></a> the past few days, but this week will offer slightly lower temperatures. <strong>Highs are expected to be around the low 80s, but some days can see temperatures up to 90 degrees. </strong>

	1. RNC to go ahead in Milwaukee despite Trump assassination attempt
</h3><p>
	The Republican National Convention will go ahead as planned in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, this week, even after Saturday’s assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump. During the four-day event, the party will formally designate Trump as its presidential candidate and learn who will be running alongside him. While not the sole focus, energy themes will be present throughout, <em>E&E News</em> <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/rnc-2024-what-to-watch-on-energy-the-environment-3/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--QqenkZKx8b-ufD7xLVaERZBo_ZU5UOhTDS2W1bTvlZHiIJlvSlsgIGQXix7YMcGveW7GA" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> last week, though of course plans may have changed in light of the weekend events. Speakers are expected to weave in references to high energy prices, call out Biden’s “anti-drilling” stance, and attack his climate policies. RNC chairman Michael Whatley, a former oil lobbyist, will likely kick things off Monday. Officials from major energy groups including the American Petroleum Institute, the National Mining Association, and the American Clean Power Association will be in attendance (and may also be at the DNC in August). A handful of conservative climate change groups will host a reception “to promote climate change policies aimed at Republicans.” Some of that will involve pushing clean energy policies, <em><em>E&E News </em></em>added.

The overall takeaway from the <a href="https://www.rff.org/publications/reports/american-understanding-of-climate-change/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--QqenkZKx8b-ufD7xLVaERZBo_ZU5UOhTDS2W1bTvlZHiIJlvSlsgIGQXix7YMcGveW7GA" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Climate Insights 2024</a> report is that the public’s views on the issue “have remained remarkably steady” since the group’s first survey in 1997. Most respondents believe, as they did 27 years ago, that the Earth’s temperature is warming (75%) and that human activity is at least partly to blame (83%). But a few things <em><em>have</em></em> changed over the years:
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Americans feel they know more about climate change. </strong>Today 73% of respondents say they know “at least a moderate amount” about the issue compared to 42% in 1997.</li>
<li><strong>More people see climate as their top issue. </strong>Twenty-one percent of Americans care deeply about climate change, pay attention to the news about the issue, and are likely to vote based on candidates’ climate policies. That’s up from 9% in 1997.</li>
<li><strong>Confidence in government action has risen recently. </strong>Today, 51% of Americans say the federal government is addressing climate change, up from 44% in 2020.</li>
<li><strong>Attitudes about renewables have shifted since 2013, and not necessarily in a good way. </strong>A majority of people still favor wind and solar power but their enthusiasm is wavering: Support for solar is down from 91% to 83%; support for wind is down from 84% to 70%.</li>
<li><strong>More Americans support nuclear, aren’t sure about coal, and dislike natural gas</strong>. Support for nuclear power has risen from 33% to 44%. On the flip side, support for natural gas has declined 10 percentage points to just 38%. Americans’ attitudes about coal haven’t changed much but remain unfavorable – only 18% said they think coal should be used to make electricity.</li></ul><h3>4.

## Fusion OS: writing an OS in Nim

date: 2024-07-15, from: OS News

I decided to document my journey of writing an OS in Nim. Why Nim? It&#8217;s one of the few languages that allow low-level systems programming with deterministic memory management (garbage collector is optional) with destructors and move semantics. It&#8217;s also statically typed, which provides greater type safety. It also supports inline assembly, which is a must for OS development. Other options include C, C++, Rust, and Zig. They&#8217;re great languages, but I chose Nim for its simplicity, elegance, and performance. ↫ Fusion OS documentation website I love it when a hobby operating system project not only uses a less common programming language, but the author also details the entire development process in great detail. It&#8217;s not a UNIX-like, and the goals are a single 64 bit address space, capability-based security model, and a lot more. It&#8217;s targeting UEFI machines, and the code is, of course, open source and available on GitHub.

## Trump rally shooting becomes hot topic on China’s social media

date: 2024-07-15, from: VOA News USA

Taipei, Taiwan — The shooting at a rally for former President Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday quickly became a trending topic on China’s social media platforms Sunday.


The Chinese foreign ministry released a statement on its website Sunday, indicating that the country is closely following the incident involving Trump.


“President Xi Jinping has expressed sympathies to former President Trump,” the Chinese foreign ministry said in its statement.


The FBI said Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, a resident of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, was the suspect in the attempted assassination of Trump.


As of noon, Beijing time Sunday, the Weibo entry "Trump was shot" had garnered more than 300 million views, making it the top trending topic on the platform. Weibo, a Chinese social media platform similar to X, formerly Twitter, mirrors trends seen on international platforms like X, which is banned in China.


Not only did the entry "Trump was shot" dominate Weibo's trending topics, but at one point, half of the top 20 searches were related to the shooting. Updates such as "Trump's right ear was shot through by a bullet," "One person died at the scene," and "The shooting suspect was killed," along with U.S. President Joe Biden's responses, also garnered significant attention.


Fast reaction came also from Chinese businesses: By noon Sunday in Beijing, shopping websites like Taobao and Pinduoduo listed T-shirts featuring images of Trump raising his arms after being injured. Some internet commenters jokingly remarked, "This is the speed of Chinese e-commerce."


Major state media outlets, including Xinhua News Agency and CCTV, extensively covered the shooting.


Many Chinese experts interviewed said they believed that the assassination attempt was genuine and speculated that it could positively influence Trump's campaign.


Chinese social media was also rife with speculation that the shooting was "self-directed and self-staged."


Notably, Jin Hao, former executive editor of Xinhua News Agency's "World Military," commented on Weibo, saying that, after looking at the clips from the scene and observing Trump’s “remarkably swift” reaction, “he [knew he] was shot as soon as he touched his ears and immediately crouched down.” Jin remarked, "This isn’t something that ordinary people can react to."


Some Weibo users also echoed that "it has been practiced hundreds of times."


However, this conspiracy theory faced criticism from many bloggers, and others who argued that Trump’s ear injury was just a few centimeters away from the brain.


Even Jin Canrong, a professor at the School of International Relations at Renmin University of China, known for his strong anti-American stance, bluntly stated in an interview with the Shanghai-based media Observer Net that this incident was “an assassination.”


Jin noted that in the photos from the scene, the injured Trump raised his hands in a fighting gesture, surrounded by Secret Service agents and the American flag, effectively creating a heroic image for himself.


Currently based in California, Albert Chiu, a political science professor at Taiwan's Tunghai University, said in an interview with VOA that Trump was shot during a live broadcast, and the shooter was killed on the scene, making it hard for any "conspiracy theory" to take hold. He emphasized that the ongoing culture of political assassination in the United States warrants more attention.


According to He Yue, a member of the National Union of Journalists in the United Kingdom, the enthusiasm of Chinese netizens for discussing the shooting reflects daily restrictions on free speech, where "domestic politics is off-limits." They can only engage openly when negative topics related to American democracy arise, He Yue said.


Because "Chinese netizens really cannot discuss Chinese politics, when it comes to other countries' political events, like the shooting, it feels like they've found an outlet to vent,” he told VOA. “The most heated discussions revolve around whether this is a ploy and who orchestrated it. Chinese people have lived in a world of falsehoods for too long; everything feels fake, so they use this mindset to judge foreigners.”


Taiwan’s reaction


On Sunday, Chen Shui-bian, former Taiwanese president who was shot while campaigning for reelection two decades ago, pointed out in interviews with several Taiwanese media outlets that the locations of both shootings — his in Tainan, in southern Taiwan, and Trump’s in Butler, Pennsylvania — can be seen as "sacred places of democracy" for both countries. Each attack resulted in minor injuries to presidential candidates, which he characterized as "a striking coincidence.”


One day before the 2004 Taiwan presidential election, the "319 shooting incident" occurred. President Chen was shot while campaigning in a jeep in Tainan. The bullet only caused a minor abdominal injury after penetrating his clothing.


The Presidential Office of Taiwan stated Sunday, "President (Lai Ching-te) extends sincere concerns to former President Trump and prays for his speedy recovery." Lai strongly condemned any form of political violence and expressed his deepest condolences to all victims.


Eric Chu, chairman of the China-friendly opposition Kuomintang party, also stated in an interview that he promptly expressed condolences to the U.S. side, hoping for former President Trump's swift recovery, and emphasizing the party's condemnation of political violence.

## GOP convention protests are on despite shooting at Trump rally

date: 2024-07-15, from: VOA News USA

MILWAUKEE  — Activists gathering in Milwaukee for the start of the Republican National Convention say the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump won't affect their long-standing plans to demonstrate outside the convention site this week.


A diverse range of organizations and activists is expected outside the downtown Fiserv Forum. The largest expected demonstration was slated to start Monday morning.


The Coalition to March on the RNC, comprised largely of local groups, planned to protest for access to abortion rights, for immigrant rights, and against the war in Gaza among other issues.


"The shooting has nothing to do with us," said Omar Flores, a coalition spokesman, speaking about the Saturday evening shots fired at Trump during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. "We're going to continue with the march as we planned."


The U.S. Secret Service has said security plans — in the works for more than a year — remain the same after the Saturday shooting in which Trump has said his ear was pierced by a bullet and images show blood streaming from a wound. A nearby audience member was fatally shot and two others critically injured in the assault, which has prompted widespread calls to evaluate security measures.


The progressive coalition protesting the RNC has touted their Monday demonstrations as "family friendly."


Organizers expect an estimated 5,000 to 10,000 attendees. Separately, the Philadelphia-based Poor People's Army, which organizes for economic justice, plans an afternoon march. Smaller organizations also plan to demonstrate inside parks closer to the convention site where Trump is set to officially accept the party's presidential nomination later this week.


Milwaukee's leaders reiterated their confidence in security plans Sunday as delegates, activists and journalists started arriving in town. An estimated 30,000 people are expected.


Trump arrived in Milwaukee on Sunday.


"We take this matter very, very seriously. We take public safety very, very seriously," Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson said Sunday. "And I have been so pleased to work in collaboration not just with the United States Secret Service but also with local law enforcement and public safety on the ground here."


Police Chief Jeffrey Norman said law enforcement was "working around the clock" to be ready.


Before the shooting in Pennsylvania, the activist coalition had been at odds with the city and law enforcement for months over a march route. Activists lost a lawsuit over restrictions on where they could demonstrate and had raised concerns about their message being stifled.


But on Friday they announced a "handshake agreement" over their route that includes allowing a city representative to accompany their protest to "make sure things go without a hitch."


City officials and federal authorities have repeatedly said their priority is safety and insist they've made free speech accommodations.


The city has allowed protests at two parks near the convention. One, Haymarket Square Park, is visible from the convention site. There is to be a city-provided stage in the vicinity and speakers will get 20 minutes apiece. A city sign-up lists more than 100 people with a wide range of agendas, including anti-abortion rights activists, veterans groups and political candidates. The other park, Zeidler Union Square, is just under a mile away.


Activists say they'll infuse their messages with moments of levity, including costumes and a television ventriloquist who is bringing a Trump puppet.


Heavy police presence is also assured.


Many activists are using the experience in Milwaukee to prepare for the Democratic National Convention in Chicago next month. That event is expected to draw even more people, and Chicago police have been undergoing training on constitutional policing and preparing for the possibility of mass arrests.


Milwaukee police have done some exercises related to the convention, though not widespread training.


"With any very large gathering, people must always be on top of their toes," said Hilario Deleon, chairman of the Milwaukee County Republican Party. "If it's successful, the city is successful."

## Google can totally explain why Chromium browsers quietly tell only its websites about your CPU, GPU usage

date: 2024-07-15, from: OS News

It&#8217;s time for Google being Google, this time by using an undocumented APIs to track resource usage when using Chrome. When visiting a *.google.com domain, the Google site can use the API to query the real-time CPU, GPU, and memory usage of your browser, as well as info about the processor you&#8217;re using, so that whatever service is being provided – such as video-conferencing with Google Meet – could, for instance, be optimized and tweaked so that it doesn&#8217;t overly tax your computer. The functionality is implemented as an API provided by an extension baked into Chromium – the browser brains primarily developed by Google and used in Chrome, Edge, Opera, Brave, and others. ↫ Brandon Vigliarolo at The Register The original goal of the API was to give Google&#8217;s various video chat services &#8211; I&#8217;ve lost count &#8211; the ability to optimise themselves based on the available system resources. Crucially, though, this API is only available to Google&#8217;s domains, and other, competing services cannot make use of it. This is in clear violation of the European Union&#8217;s Digital Markets Act, and with Chrome being by far the most popular browser in the world, and thus a clear gatekeeper, the European Commission really should have something to say about this. For its part, Google told The Register it claims to comply with the DMA, so we might see a change to this API soon. Aside from optimising video chat performance, the API, which is baked into a non-removable extension, also tracks performance issues and crashes and reports these back to Google. This second use, too, is at its core not a bad thing &#8211; especially if users are given the option to opt out of such crash analytics. Still, it seems odd to use an undocumented API for something like this, but I&#8217;m not a developer so what do I know. Mind you, other Chromium-based browsers also report this data back to Google, which is wild when you think about it. Normally I would suggest people switch to Firefox, but I&#8217;ve got some choice words for Firefox and Mozilla, too, later today.

## Pretty pictures, bootable floppy disks, and the first Canon Cat demo?

date: 2024-07-15, from: OS News

About a month ago, Cameron Kaiser first introduced us to the Canon Cat, a computer designed by Jeff Raskin, but abandoned within six months by Canon, who had no idea what to do with it. In his second article on the Cat, Kaiser dives much deeper into the software and operating system of the Cat, even going so far as to become the first person to write software for it. One of the most surprising aspects of the Cat is that it&#8217;s collaborative; other users can call into your Cat using a landline and edit the same document you&#8217;re working on remotely. Selecting text has other functions too. When I say everything goes in the workspace, I do mean everything. The Cat is designed to be collabourative: you can hook up your Cat to a phone line, or at least you could when landlines were more ubiquitous, and someone could call in and literally type into your document remotely. If you dialed up a service, you would type into the document and mark and send text to the remote system, and the remote system&#8217;s response would also become part of your document. (That goes for the RS-232 port as well, by the way. In fact, we&#8217;ll deliberately exploit this capability for the projects in this article.) ↫ Cameron Kaiser You can also do calculations right into the text, going so far as allowing the user to define variables and reuse those variables throughout the text to perform various equations and other mathematic operations. If you go back and change the value of a variable, all other equations using those variables are updated as well. That&#8217;s quite nifty, especially considering the age of the Cat, and since the Cat is fixed width, you can effectively create spreadsheets this way, too. There&#8217;s really far too much to cover here, and I strongly suggest you head on over and read the entire thing.

## Your next datacenter could be in the middle of nowhere

<h4>Training AI models doesn't need low latency.

President Joe Biden on Sunday summoned the gravitas of the Oval Office to entreat Americans to unify and shun political violence after a stunning attempt on the life of rival Donald Trump a day earlier. Trump, en route to the political convention where he is expected to clinch the Republican presidential nomination, made similar calls – in a sign both men fear trouble ahead as the November election looms. VOA’s Anita Powell reports from the White House.

## Stop using ease-out in your UIs!

<p><strong>Stop using ease-out, or ease-in-out, or whatever-out, in every UI animation!</strong></p>

<p>There is a lot of propaganda on the internet against ease-in, saying that it's “unnatural”, “unusual”, or that it's “of the devil”. Some say that it's both “sluggish” and “abrupt”. Many pointing to ease-out as the safe, smooth, satisfying messiah of animation (including its safer kin, ease-in-out). There are even published ‘best practices’ which can be summed up to <a target="_blank" href="https://web.dev/articles/the-basics-of-easing">“just use ease-out”</a>. This post is here to set things straight — in a nonlinear fashion.</p>

<p>So, why not ease-out? And what to use instead?</p>

<h2 id="reason-1-its-overused">Reason #1. It’s overused</h2>

<p>Let’s get the weakest point out of the way. Ease out is boring because it’s everywhere. Because it’s part of the browser default <code>ease</code> function (which is a combination of a fast ease-in with a slow ease-out). </p>

<p>It’s like how corners are getting rounder and rounder on the web simply because it's easy and built-in.</p>

<img loading="lazy" width="100%" data-placeholder="" src="https://leanrada.com/notes/stop-using-ease-out/figma-ease-out.gif?ref=rss" caption="Source: Figma">
<span>Source: Figma</span>
<p>Is the public missing out on better web animations (and better corners) because of the ubiquity of these practices? Yes.</p>

<h2 id="reason-2-its-unrealistic">Reason #2. It’s unrealistic</h2>

<p>How about a study in skeuomorphism?</p>

<p>Imagine a mechanical toggle switch. Something like the following video:</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/l-G_uejx0Rs?si=g-RJXjgqsY8euukl" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<p>Now here’s an interactive physics simulation of the same spring-based toggle switch:</p>

Alternative text: interactive simulation of a mechanical switch</pre>

<p><span><em>Drag your pointer horizontally and vertically across the simulation window to control the appendage that toggles the switch.</em></span></p>

<p>This is a physics-based simulation with simulated forces, torques, and constraints. Let’s slow the simulation down and show some force lines for a better look.</p>

<pre>Interactive content: <a href="https://leanrada.com/notes/stop-using-ease-out?ref=rss">Visit the website to play with interactive content!</a>
Alternative text: interactive simulation of a mechanical switch</pre>

<p>Play around with the simulation!</p>

<p>Here’s what a typical motion looks like:</p>

<span>Typical output graph of the above simulation</span>
<p>Notice the <span>position curve (red)</span>. <small>We'll get to the force curve later.</small> Does the position curve look anything familiar? Compare that with some standard easing functions:</p>

<img srcset="/notes/stop-using-ease-out/standard-easing.png 664w" sizes=" 664px" spec="100% [664) 664" loading="lazy" width="100%" data-placeholder="" src="https://leanrada.com/notes/stop-using-ease-out/standard-easing.png?ref=rss" caption="Common easing functions. Source: MDN">
<span>Common easing functions. Source: MDN</span>
<p><strong>The toggle switch’s position curve follows the ease-in curve!</strong> A slow start, gradually building up momentum, then finally stopping to a satisfying ‘click’!</p>

<p>Contrary to “best practice”, the natural motion of a toggle switch does not follow an ease-out nor an ease-in-out curve! I’ll go further and say that ease-out is unnatural for any kind of UI control that represents a tactile interaction.</p>

<p>Like buttons. In the real world, buttons (the ones that are nice to press anyway) have some kind of buckling mechanism when pressed. Similar to the toggle switch example above, there’s a buildup, a fall, and a final ‘click’ into place.</p>

              </video>
<span>A button. In the real world.</span>
<p>Best practice says that the sharp stop is unnatural and should be avoided. But that well-defined resolution is part of what makes switches and buttons feel good. Just imagine a button that dampens the motion the more you press it. It’ll feel squishy and mushy. You know what else slows down the further you go? Ease-out!</p>

<p>And yet, thousands of UIs still use ease out for UI controls!</p>

              </video>
<span>Ease out everywhere. One of these is a skeuomorphic rocker switch, ironically.</span>
<p>Has abstract UI design gone too far?</p>

<h3 id="counterexamples">Counterexamples</h3>

<p>Of course, not all UI animations need ease in, such as macro interactions, card movement, scrolling, expand/collapse, or any object that ‘animate themselves’ as opposed to raw manipulation.</p>

              </video>
<span>Source: Material Design</span>
<p>Unlike switches and buttons, these things don’t have a frame or housing that can immediately stop them when they ‘bottom out’. So they have to decelerate naturally.</p>

<p>In the end, it depends. But as a general rule? Ease-in for tactile things.</p>

<h2 id="reason-3-ease-in-is-more-satisfying">Reason #3. Ease-in is more satisfying</h2>

<img srcset="/notes/stop-using-ease-out/typical.png 664w" sizes=" 664px" spec="100% [664) 664" loading="lazy" width="100%" data-placeholder="" src="https://leanrada.com/notes/stop-using-ease-out/typical.png?ref=rss" caption="The graph again. This time focus on the force curve.">
<span>The graph again. This time focus on the force curve.</span>
<p>If you’re a mechanical keyboard enthusiast, you might’ve recognised the general landmarks in the <span>force curve (blue)</span> above. That ‘tactile bump’ and subsequent drop in force is a big part of what provides the satisfying feedback that mechanical keys are known for (and coincidentally, produces the ease-in motion).</p>

            </blockquote>
<p>This theory was introduced by a psychologist named Daniel E. Berlyne in 1970. The idea is that an increase in tension followed by a sharp decrease produces a satisfying feeling. This framework works well for ease-in’s case in the context of the force curve, or more directly, with ease-in’s initial slow buildup followed by its abrupt resolution.</p>

<span>The three-act structure with a tension graph.</span>
<p>In storytelling or filmmaking, the <a target="_blank" href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeActStructure">three-act structure</a> is a model for analysing or creating good stories. It mirrors the tension-resolution sequence in a grander scale. And with bigger scope comes the potential for a higher level of satisfaction — <em>catharsis</em>. Great stories that use the three-act structure always leave you in a state of catharsis.</p>

<p>Is it possible to have micro-catharses in UI animations?</p>
<hr>
<p>All of these patterns of satisfaction reflect ease-in’s slow buildup and sudden resolution. While there are other kinds of satisfying phenomenon, like <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/3clqk2U3T9Y">sand slicing</a> which has nothing to do with any of this; tension and release is a way to induce the positive effect.</p>

<p>There must be a balance to the proportion of tension and release, else the negative effects of the tension may overcome the positive effects of release, or the tension too light that the release is too shallow. A bubble wrap that is really hard to pop would be quite annoying, and a grand story that ends prematurely would be disappointing. The easing curve must be manually finetuned depending on the purpose. For buttons and toggles, keep it shorter than a bubble wrap pop.</p>

<p><span>🫰 <strong>Snap!</strong> Try snapping your fingers. Did you do it? If so, you just made an ease-in motion. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DHQ4mKSZXU">Don’t believe me?</a> When people say they want <em>snappy</em> animations, what do they really want?</span></p>

<h2 id="tips">Tips</h2>

<ul>
              <li>Use a custom curve appropriate to the size of the element. Don’t use the default ease-in because it’s likely to feel too slow for most use cases. In CSS, there’s <a target="_blank" href="https://cubic-bezier.com/"><code>cubic-bezier()</code></a> for example.</li>
              <li>Use a duration appropriate to the curve, the size of the element, and the scale of the movement.</li>
              <li>Partially start the animation on pointer press, not on release.<ul>
                  <li>For mouse users, there’s already an initial ‘actuation force’ required to trigger the mouse button. In these cases, the initial velocity shouldn’t be zero (the easing curve shouldn’t start at a horizontal slope). For touchscreens, there’s no such actuation force.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Don’t use ease-out in everything! Try ease-in! Or try a combination of both with varying weights! Just try anything at all. Tweak your curves as often as you tweak your paddings.
            </p>
