id="north-korea-seen-unlikely-to-engage-us-after-fall-election-regardless-of-winner">North
Korea seen unlikely to engage US after fall election, regardless of
winner</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — North Korea’s broadening ties with Russia make a
possible re-engagement with the U.S. less appealing for Pyongyang
despite an apparent overture from Republican presidential nominee Donald
Trump, analysts said.</p>
<p>A delegation from the Russian prosecutor’s office wrapped up a
three-day visit to Pyongyang and headed home Wednesday, North Korea’s
state-run KCNA said.</p>
<p>Prosecutor General Igor Krasnov, the head of the delegation, and Kim
Chol Won, director of North Korea’s Central Public Prosecutors Office,
signed an agreement on Monday to cooperate on law enforcement countering
foreign influence.</p>
<p>Krasnov said the two countries are “actively developing their
comprehensive partnership” in “openly and successfully fighting off
attempts to impose alien development models and values on us,” according
to the Russian news agency Tass.</p>
<p>Krasnov said Moscow and Pyongyang seek to consolidate their efforts
in countering “crimes in the area of information and communications
technologies,” among other areas.</p>
<p>The ties between the two have been expanding rapidly in multiple
areas since Russian President Vladimir Putin visited Pyongyang in June
and signed a mutual defense treaty with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un,
promising closer military cooperation.</p>
<p>Russia-North Korea ties</p>
<p>“Kim Jong Un may see less need to engage with the U.S. than in 2018
because the regime is now getting economic and possibly military
benefits from Russia,” said Bruce Klingner, senior research fellow for
Northeast Asia at the Heritage Foundation.</p>
<p>North Korea said, “We do not care” that “any administration takes
office in the U.S.” or that Trump has “lingering desire for the
prospects of the DPRK-U.S. relations,” according to state-run KCNA on
Tuesday.</p>
<p>The statement was released after Trump said last week in his
presidential nomination acceptance speech at the Republic National
Convention that he “got along very well with Kim” and thought Kim wanted
him to win the presidential election in November.</p>
<p>During his term, Trump’s personal diplomacy with Kim resulted in
their first 2018 summit in Singapore, a failed 2019 summit in Hanoi, and
a last meeting at the inter-Korean border in 2019.</p>
<p>But that engagement came before Kim had Putin by his side, according
to Andrew Yeo, the SK-Korea Foundation  chair in Korea studies at the
Brookings Institution.  “There’s less incentive for Kim to engage with
the U.S.” now that Russia and China are backing him, Yeo said.</p>
<p>“That said, Kim is an opportunist, so I wouldn’t rule out the
possibility of Kim reaching out to Trump at some point if Trump is
reelected,” Yeo added.</p>
<p>Little incentive for talks</p>
<p>In its KCNA statement, North Korea also said, “It is true that Trump,
when he was president, tried to reflect the special personal relations
between the heads of states in the relations between states, but he did
not bring about any substantial positive change.”</p>
<p>Robert Manning, a senior fellow at the Stimson Center’s Reimagining
U.S. Grand Strategy Program, said the KCNA statement “reflected that Kim
felt humiliated when Trump walked out of the Hanoi summit rather than
continuing negotiations, and the strategic choices Kim has made since
2019 — that he has abandoned long-standing North Korean interest in
normalizing relations with the U.S.</p>
<p>“If Trump wins, he may be tempted to try to revive nuclear talks with
Kim, but Pyongyang has taken denuclearization off the table. The
political space for a more limited, credible U.S.-North Korea deal has
shrunk immensely.”</p>
<p>Trump walked out of the summit in Hanoi, rejecting Kim’s offer to
dismantle the Yongbyon nuclear facility in return for sanctions
relief.</p>
<p>Nuclear talks between the U.S. and North Korea have remained stalled
since 2019 despite the Biden administration’s call for Pyongyang to
return to dialogue.</p>
<p>In the same KCNA statement that rebuffed Trump’s outreach, North
Korea expressed its dissatisfaction with the deployment of U.S. FA-18
Super Hornets to the Suwon Air Force Base for joint drills with South
Korea that began Tuesday and will run through this summer.</p>
<p>Washington’s continued call for dialogue in this context is a
“sinister attempt” and “an extension of confrontation,” North Korea
said.</p>
<p>The Heritage Foundation’s Klingner said North Korea’s message “hinted
that the price for it reengaging with Washington would be the
cancellation of bilateral military exercises, rotational deployment of
U.S. strategic assets and reduction of the U.S. extended deterrence
guarantee.</p>
<p>“If Washington capitulated to those demands, Pyongyang could seek to
further divide the U.S.-ROK alliance and degrade deterrence by proposing
a peace declaration or treaty which could then lead to advocacy for a
premature decrease of U.S. troops in South Korea.”</p>

heads to Asia after Thursday’s meeting between Biden, Netanyahu</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>State Department  — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will
depart for Asia on Thursday to reaffirm ties with strategic allies,
following his attendance at a highly anticipated White House meeting
between President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu.</p>
<p>“The secretary will now depart tomorrow for Asia, instead of tonight,
as we had originally planned, so he can attend the meeting between the
president and Prime Minister Netanyahu tomorrow here in Washington,”
State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters during
Wednesday’s briefing.  </p>
<p>Washington said it is committed to allies and partners in the
Indo-Pacific region, despite the Middle East crisis.  </p>
<p>“This is the secretary’s 18th trip to the region,” Miller added. “He
will still travel to Laos, to Vietnam, to Japan, to Singapore, to the
Philippines and to Mongolia.”  </p>
<p>Blinken will hold talks with senior officials from the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in Vientiane, Laos, before traveling to
Hanoi, Vietnam. Although a schedule change will prevent him from
attending the funeral of General Secretary Nguyen Phú Trong, the head of
Vietnam’s ruling Communist Party, he will still visit Vietnam to pay his
respects and meet with senior officials.  </p>
<p>In Tokyo and Manila, Blinken will join Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin
for 2+2 security talks with their counterparts.   </p>
<p>Blinken will also travel to Singapore and Mongolia to hold talks with
senior officials there.</p>

Trump shooter searched for info on a previous assassination</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The 20-year-old man who tried to kill former President
Donald Trump during a campaign rally earlier this month appeared to have
set his sights on the attempted assassination at least a week before the
incident.</p>
<p>FBI Director Christopher Wray told lawmakers on Wednesday that while
many questions remain unanswered, analysis of Thomas Matthew Crooks’
laptop showed the would-be assassin seemed to be fixated on high-profile
public figures and searched for information on the 1963 killing of
former U.S. President John F. Kennedy by lone gunman Lee Harvey
Oswald.</p>
<p>“On July 6, he did a Google search for – quote – ‘how far away was
Oswald from Kennedy,’” Wray said.</p>
<p>“That’s obviously significant in terms of his state of mind,” Wray
added. “That is the same day that he registered for the Butler
rally.”</p>
<p>Seven days later, on July 13, Crooks climbed onto a roof overlooking
the campaign rally in western Pennsylvania, firing eight shots from an
AR-style assault rifle, leaving Trump with a bloody ear, while killing a
rallygoer and injuring two others.</p>
<p>The FBI director also told lawmakers on the House Judiciary Committee
that Crooks used his mobile phone to search for information on
high-profile figures.</p>
<p>“The shooter appears to have done a lot of searches of public figures
in general … news articles and things like that,” Wray said, adding that
images of high-profile officials and politicians found on the shooter’s
phone were linked to the articles.</p>
<p>“This does not appear to be some sort of target list,” he said.
“There doesn’t seem to be a lot of rhyme or reason to it so far other
than that these are all prominent public people.”</p>
<p>Other searches of the shooter’s mobile phone and electronic devices,
however, have so far not provided any insight into Crooks’ mindset.</p>
<p>Wray said the investigation has failed to turn up any evidence of a
political ideology or a manifesto that could explain why Crooks targeted
the former president.</p>
<p>Nor have investigators come across any indication that the shooter
had help or that he alerted anyone else to his plans.</p>
<p>“So far, we have not found any evidence of any accomplices or
co-conspirators, foreign or domestic,” Wray said, adding the
investigation appears to confirm accounts that Crooks was a loner.</p>
<p>“His list of contacts, for example, is very short compared to what
you would normally see from most people. It doesn’t appear to be a whole
lot of interaction between him, face-to-face or digital with a lot of
people,” he said.</p>
<p>Still, Wray cautioned that the FBI has not been able to access all of
the shooter’s social media accounts and that investigators ultimately
may never get past some of the passwords and encryption.</p>
<p>U.S. lawmakers, both Republicans and Democrats, have repeatedly
expressed outrage in the days and weeks since the July 13 shooting,
leading to Tuesday’s resignation of the director of the U.S. Secret
Service, the agency responsible for providing security to current and
former presidents and their families.</p>
<p>The now former director, Kimberly Cheatle, drew additional ire from
lawmakers the day before she resigned, repeatedly refusing to answer
questions about the attempted assassination while calling the event,
“most significant operational failure … in decades.”</p>
<p>The FBI’s Wray on Wednesday took a different tact, assuring lawmakers
that the bureau will “leave no stone unturned” in its investigation,
while committing to provide as much information as possible.</p>
<p>“We need to know what happened play-by-play, moment-by-moment,
second-by-second,” said the House Judiciary Committee chairman,
Republican Representative Jim Jordan.</p>
<p>“A significant portion of the country has a healthy skepticism
regarding the FBI’s ability to conduct a fair, honest, open and
transparent investigation,” he said, accusing the law enforcement agency
of what he described as multiple failures over the past several
years.</p>
<p>During the more than three hours of testimony, the FBI’s Wray
confirmed reports that the shooter had flown a drone at the site of
campaign rally about two hours before the event got underway.</p>
<p>He said the flight path took the drone over an area about 180 meters
(200 yards) from the stage where former President Trump was to speak,
and that it appears the drone livestreamed video.</p>
<p>However, the camera appears to have been pointing away from the
podium.</p>
<p>“We think it would have shown him what would have been behind him [on
the roof],” Wray said. “Like, it’s almost like giving him a rearview
mirror of the scene behind him.”</p>
<p>Wray also said the investigators have determined the shooter visited
the site of the rally at least three times.</p>
<p>The first visit, which came a week before the shooting, lasted 20
minutes. A second visit, which lasted 70 minutes, took place the morning
of the shooting. And the final visit was the afternoon of the shooting,
when Crooks arrived and waited to carry out the attempted
assassination.</p>
<p>Yet for all that investigators think they know after digging into the
shooter’s social media and communications, and after more than 400
interviews, Wray said there are other questions that have yet to be
answered.</p>
<p>One of those questions is how Crooks got up on the roof of the
building overlooking the rally.</p>
<p>Investigators found a receipt showing he had bought a 1.5-meter-tall
(5 feet) ladder, but that it was never brought to the scene of the
shooting.</p>
<p>Wray said there is also still some confusion over whether the shooter
had managed to place the rifle on the roof before the shooting or
whether he carried it up with him right before he started firing.</p>
<p>“The weapon had a collapsible stock which might explain why it was
less easy to observe,” Wray said.</p>

id="harris-was-never-border-czar-experts-say-despite-republican-claims">Harris
was never ‘border czar,’ experts say, despite Republican claims</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — After President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024
presidential race and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to replace
him as the Democratic nominee, Republicans quickly focused on Harris and
her work on immigration issues, calling her a “border czar.”</p>
<p>Congressman Guy Reschenthaler, a Republican from Pennsylvania, said
at a House Rules Committee hearing Tuesday that Biden appointed Harris
as the border czar 64 days into his administration. The hearing focused
on an emergency resolution addressing the “failures of the border czar
position and its negative impact on our fellow citizens across the
country.”</p>
<p>“With Harris at the helm, the Biden-Harris administration made good
on their promise to systematically dismantle President [Donald] Trump’s
secure border [policies],” Reschenthaler said.</p>
<p>But was Harris appointed as border czar?</p>
<p>Immigration experts say no.</p>
<p>Theresa Cardinal Brown, senior adviser on immigration and border
policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center, said that early in the Biden
administration, Harris was assigned the task of reducing migration to
the U.S. southern border and collaborating with Central American nations
to address the root causes of migration through diplomacy, development
and investment.</p>
<p>“She was never named a border czar. In fact, the border was not her
priority issue at all. The border was the responsibility of Homeland
Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. She was never in charge of the border per
se,” Brown said.</p>
<p>Brown said “czar” is not a recognized term under the U.S. legal
system.</p>
<p>“But it has been adopted into American political discourse as, I’d
say, a shorthand title for somebody who is given within a White House
administration – within the executive branch – broad responsibility and
authority to direct the administration across different Cabinet
departments on a particular issue or policy,” Brown said.</p>
<p>Border politics</p>
<p>During the pandemic, the Trump administration virtually closed the
border to migration, as officials implemented a health order that
allowed for the rapid expulsion of migrants, effectively turning away
most migrants without giving them a chance to seek asylum.</p>
<p>When President Biden took office in January 2021, expulsions
continued, except for unaccompanied minors. Both Biden and Harris openly
urged migrants not to come, but they did, presenting a political crisis
for Biden at the beginning of his administration.</p>
<p>Biden soon asked Harris to spearhead a “root causes” strategy,
banking heavily on using American investments to improve living
conditions and discourage migrants from leaving three Central American
nations where a significant number of migrants come from: Honduras, El
Salvador and Guatemala.</p>
<p>The Biden administration also reunited families separated under the
Trump administration and expanded legal immigration pathways, including
increasing refugee admissions and creating a humanitarian program for
migrants from Central America, Venezuela and Haiti.</p>
<p>Although it is not known what Harris’ immigration policy will look
like, immigration attorney Hector Quiroga said he thinks Harris will
continue Biden’s policies, but he noted that Harris’ immigration message
has changed.</p>
<p>“Her record is rather interesting because in the beginning, she was
very much in the diplomatic kind of way. … With experience [in the vice
president office], she has said, ‘Please don’t come’ to migrants,” he
said, referring to Harris’ evolution to a stricter tone and tougher
message.</p>
<p>Quiroga is referring to Harris’ 2021 trip to Guatemala to meet with
former Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei and address the root
causes of illegal migration. During her visit, she emphasized the Biden
administration’s commitment to helping Guatemalans find “hope at
home.”</p>
<p>And she issued a stern warning to potential migrants.</p>
<p>“I want to be clear to folks in this region who are thinking about
making that dangerous trek to the United States-Mexico border,” Harris
said. “Do not come. Do not come.”</p>
<p>The Biden administration has been highlighting progress at the
border, noting that arrests for illegal crossings from Mexico dropped by
29% in June, marking the lowest number during Joe Biden’s
presidency.</p>

<a href="https://insideevs.com/news/727144/us-ev-registrations-may2024/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>down
15% year-on-year</u></a> — the fourth consecutive month of decline.
Profits were down fully
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/23/business/tesla-q2-earnings-elon-musk.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>45</u></a>%
in the second quarter thanks to soft sales and price cuts. The only new
model the company has produced in five years, the Cybertruck, has gotten
weak reviews and been plagued with problems.
</p>
<p>
Electrifying transportation is a vital part of combating climate change,
and for years Tesla benefited from the argument that as the pioneering
American EV company, it was doing great work on the climate.
</p>
<p>
Declining sales aren’t good for Tesla CEO Elon Musk or the company’s
shareholders. But the fact that other companies are
<a href="https://insideevs.com/news/726327/ev-sales-brands-non-tesla/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>taking
up the slack</u></a> — now accounting for a
<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/07/10/tesla_electric_car_sales/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>majority
of EV sales</u></a> — is good for the EV market as a whole. Here’s why.
</p>
<p>
First, from a traditional business standpoint, it is good to have
several competitors in a market. This is how capitalism is supposed to
work — for any particular good or service, a number of different
businesses should be constantly fighting each other for profits by
improving their products on price and quality (within the bounds of
government regulations on safety, efficiency, and so on). When there is
sustained competition, old, established companies have to keep
researching and innovating, lest they lose market share to someone else.
</p>
<p>
We have seen this in the automobile space many times before, as when
General Motors improved on Ford’s assembly line to come out with regular
new models in the 1920s, or when upstart Japanese companies caught the
incumbent American players flatfooted in the 1970s and 80s with small,
reliable cars at a lower price. Modern cars are dramatically safer,
cleaner, more reliable, and more efficient thanks in large part to this
history of competition.
</p>
<p>
Second, Tesla’s peculiar history makes it a poor foundation for the EV
industry. The company comes out of California’s Big Tech culture, with
its ideology of “move fast and break things” and deep disdain for prior
experience. The result, as auto journalist Edward Neidermeyer explains
in his book
<a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/692346/ludicrous-by-edward-niedermeyer/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>Ludicrous:
The Unvarnished Story of Tesla Motors</em></em></u></a>, is an unusually
shoddy and dangerous manufacturing culture. Tesla’s factories are
notorious for
<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-german-plant-union-claims-poor-working-conditions-long-hours-2023-1?op=1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>poor
working conditions</u></a> and
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/21/23971138/tesla-gigafactory-austin-texas-injury-reports-robot-claw-explosion" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>regular
injuries</u></a>, and its cars are infamous for inconsistent panel gaps,
<a href="https://www.afr.com/technology/tesla-blamed-drivers-for-failures-of-parts-it-long-knew-were-defective-20231226-p5etok" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>structural
failures</u></a>, and of course
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/26/24141361/tesla-autopilot-fsd-nhtsa-investigation-report-crash-death" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Autopilot
accidents</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
We can see these two factors at work in the growing number of superior
options available from other EV companies. Tesla’s habit of putting as
many controls as possible into a massive central screen seemed fancy at
first, but drivers are starting to remember that physical buttons are
both more reliable and easier to use while driving. In the economy
segment, Hyundai’s Kona EV or Chevy’s Bolt EUV both have dead simple
rocker switches for adjusting the temperature — no touchscreen menu
fiddling required. Indeed, Tesla has even replaced such a bog standard
control as the turn signal stalk with capacitive buttons in the most
recent Model 3 and Model S, which is
<a href="https://www.edmunds.com/car-news/2024-tesla-model-3-turn-signals-long-term-update.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>straight-up
dangerous</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Even in the upmarket segments Tesla is falling behind. The new GM
Silverado EV is far more of a real utility vehicle than the Cybertruck —
in particular, it can
<a href="https://cleantechnica.com/2024/03/28/four-electric-trucks-go-head-to-head-towing-over-the-rockies/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>actually
tow serious distances</u></a>. Unlike Tesla, Kia and Rivian now have
three-row vehicles for big families with the EV9 and Rivian R1S. For
enthusiasts, Tesla’s top-shelf Model S Plaid is very fast in a straight
line, but Hyundai’s new Ioniq 5 N both
<a href="https://www.roadandtrack.com/reviews/a44287146/hyundai-ioniq-5-n-drive-nurburgring-autobahn/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>handles
far better</u></a> and comes with a (faintly comical, yet fun) manual
transmission simulation system. This is what happens when serious
companies cater to as many market segments as possible.
</p>
<p>
Then there is the fact that Musk seems to have turned against Tesla’s
Supercharger network, which is legitimately the best in the business.
That fact, along with some government subsidies and requirements, is why
every other EV company has settled on the Tesla charging plug as the
North American standard. But Musk recently fired almost the entire
Supercharger team
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/inside-story-elon-musks-mass-firings-tesla-supercharger-staff-2024-05-15/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>apparently
in a fit of pique</u></a>, and though
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/05/tesla-does-180-on-superchargers-rehiring-laid-off-staff-amid-new-plans/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>he
hired some of them back</u></a>, the system’s future is in doubt.
Relying on Tesla to build out a proper national charging network is
unwise.
</p>
<p>
Finally, there is Elon Musk himself. Last year,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/elon-musk-tesla-twitter" target="_self"><u>I
argued</u></a> that Tesla could evolve into a normal car company if it
could just be run by somebody other than him — like, for instance,
then-Chief Financial Officer Zach Kirkhorn, who seemed to be running
things at the time. Unfortunately,
<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-did-tesla-cfo-zach-210619337.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Kirkhorn
is out</u></a>, and Musk has since taken back control. His pet project
Cybertruck looks to be a flop, and he’s reportedly
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/wall-street-wants-answers-musk-teslas-affordable-car-2024-04-17/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>canceled</u></a>
the $25,000 model that was supposed to be the end goal of Tesla’s entire
business plan (though Musk denies this). Instead he is
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/05/business/elon-musk-tesla-robotaxi-august-8/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>pivoting
back to robotaxis</u></a> — which, if year after year of
<a href="https://gizmodo.com/elon-musk-robotaxi-promise-broken-august-8-tesla-day-1851392219" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>broken
promises</u></a> and
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/tesla-video-promoting-self-driving-was-staged-engineer-testifies-2023-01-17/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>misleading
promotions</u></a> are any judge — is not going to happen.
</p>
<p>
More importantly, Musk has harnessed his vast fortune—which is mostly
Tesla stock—on behalf of Donald Trump. Musk promised to donate
<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/07/15/elon-musk-45-million-donation-trump-super-pac/74418715007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$45
million per month</u></a> for the rest of the presidential campaign
(though he
<a href="https://fortune.com/2024/07/23/elon-musk-backs-down-from-45-million-a-month-pledge-to-trump-says-he-doesnt-subscribe-to-cult-of-personality/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>later
walked back</u></a> that specific figure). A second Trump presidency
will probably not end the EV transition—all the world’s big automakers
have bet heavily on it—but it might dramatically slow it down in this
country. Trump has
<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/02/26/1088921/trump-wants-to-unravel-bidens-landmark-climate-law-here-is-whats-most-at-risk/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>promised
to repeal</u></a> the Inflation Reduction Act, which would end the
$7,500 tax credit for EV purchases, not to mention the hundreds of
billions in other subsidies for renewable power, utility-scale
batteries, and much more. This would be a catastrophe for the climate
and the American economy, which will lose out on the industries of the
future to China and Europe.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, it could be that Musk sees his company can’t compete with the
traditional manufacturers on quality or price, and so is hoping to
strangle their EV divisions by cutting off their subsidies before
they’ve reached profitability, so that Tesla remains the only big player
in a much smaller market.
</p>
<p>
In doing so, he might hamstring all kinds of forthcoming EV innovations
— from more energy-dense
<a href="https://www.rideapart.com/news/727370/solid-state-ev-batteries-coming-soon-motorcycles/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>solid-state
batteries</u></a>, to
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/13/23024041/mercedes-benz-vision-eqxx-ev-distance-battery-charge-test" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>hyper-efficient</u></a>
new models, to using one’s car as a
<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/02/07/1087836/how-virtual-power-plants-are-shaping-tomorrows-energy-system/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>virtual
power plant</u></a>, to who knows what else. (Although to be fair
Chinese companies will surely figure these out sooner or later, even if
Americans can’t buy them.)
</p>
<p>
Whatever the case, the fact that every new Tesla purchase or lease is
now effectively an in-kind donation to the Trump campaign blows up any
claim Musk has to be doing good on climate change, and makes buying one
grossly irresponsible for the climate. The quicker this company loses
its
<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/video/tesla-egregiously-overvalued-amid-transition-150929181.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ludicrously
overvalued</u></a> stock price, the better.

id="man-who-attacked-author-salman-rushdie-charged-with-supporting-terrorist-group">Man
who attacked author Salman Rushdie charged with supporting terrorist
group</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Buffalo, New York — A man who severely injured author Salman Rushdie
in a frenzied knife attack in western New York faces new terrorism
charges.</p>
<p>A three-count indictment unsealed in U.S. District Court in Buffalo
on Wednesday charges Hadi Matar with attempting to provide material
support to Hezbollah, a militant group based in Lebanon and backed by
Iran. The indictment didn’t detail what evidence linked Matar to the
group. It also includes charges of committing terrorism transcending
national boundaries and providing material support to terrorists.</p>
<p>The federal charges come after Matar earlier this month rejected an
offer by state prosecutors to recommend a shorter prison sentence if he
agreed to plead guilty in Chautauqua County Court, where he is charged
with attempted murder and assault. The agreement also would have
required him to plead guilty to a federal terrorism-related charge,
which hadn’t been filed yet at the time.</p>
<p>Instead, both cases will now proceed to trial separately. Jury
selection in the state case is set for Oct. 15.</p>
<p>Matar was scheduled to appear on the new indictment Wednesday
afternoon.</p>
<p>“Mr. Matar plans on denying the accusations in the indictment,” his
attorney, Nathaniel Barone, said by phone. “He plans on proceeding with
a vigorous defense and maintain his innocence.”</p>
<p>Matar, 26, has been held without bail since the 2022 attack, during
which he stabbed Rushdie more than a dozen times as the acclaimed writer
was onstage about to give a lecture at the Chautauqua Institution. Knife
wounds blinded Rushdie in one eye. The event moderator, Henry Reese, was
also wounded.</p>
<p>Rushdie detailed the attack and his long and painful recovery in a
memoir published in April.</p>
<p>The author spent years in hiding after the Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran
issued a fatwa, or edict, in 1989 calling for Rushdie’s death over his
novel “The Satanic Verses.” Khomeini considered the book blasphemous.
Rushdie reemerged into the public the late 1990s.</p>
<p>Matar was born in the U.S. but holds dual citizenship in Lebanon,
where his parents were born. He lived in New Jersey prior to the attack.
His mother has said that her son became withdrawn and moody after he
visited his father in Lebanon in 2018.</p>
<p>The attack raised questions about whether Rushdie had gotten proper
security protection, given that he is still the subject of death
threats. A state police trooper and county sheriff’s deputy had been
assigned to the lecture. In 1991, a Japanese translator of “The Satanic
Verses” was stabbed to death. An Italian translator survived a knife
attack the same year. In 1993, the book’s Norwegian publisher was shot
three times but survived.</p>
<p>The investigation into Rushdie’s stabbing focused partly on whether
Matar had been acting alone or in concert with militant or religious
groups.</p>

just “well duh, KDE uses QtQuick which is written with C++ and QML”. I
also don’t mean this as “well duh, Qt has a lot of bindings to other

certain languages and specialized formats”. ↫ Thiago Sueto If you ever
wanted to contribute to KDE but weren’t sure if your preferred
programming language or tools were relevant, this is a great blog post
detailing how you can contribute if you are familiar with any of the
following: Python, Ruby, Perl, Containerfile/Docker/Podman,
HTML/SCSS/JavaScript, Web Assembly, Flatpak/Snap, CMake, Java, and Rust.
A complex, large project like KDE needs people with a wide variety of
skills, so it’s definitely not just C++. An excellent place to

Broke</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-24, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p>
The blade that
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/vineyard-wind-turbine-nantucket" target="_self"><u>snapped
off an offshore turbine</u></a> at the Vineyard Wind project in
Massachusetts on July 13 broke due to a manufacturing defect, according
to GE Vernova, the turbine maker and installer.
</p>
<p>
During GE’s second quarter earnings call on Wednesday, CEO Scott Strazik
and Vice President of Investor Relations Michael Lapides said there was
no indication of a design flaw in the blade. Rather, the company has
identified a “material deviation” at one of its factories in Gaspé,
Canada. (Strazik provided more color in an
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-24/ge-vernova-identified-manufacturing-deviation-at-blade-factory?srnd=homepage-americas" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>interview
with </u><u><em><em>Bloomberg</em></em></u></a>, noting that the blade
had “insufficient bonding.”)
</p>
<p>
“Because of that, we’re going to use our existing data and re-inspect
all of the blades that we have made for offshore wind,” Strazik told
investors. The factory has produced about 150 blades total, he said, and
likened the task before the company to giving each one an ultrasound.
“So that gives you an indication and context of the work ahead.” He
added that he has a “high degree of confidence” that the company can get
it all done, but declined to speculate on how long it would take.
</p>
<p>
I reached out to GE Vernova to ask how many blades from the Gaspé plant
have been installed at Vineyard Wind 1 but didn’t hear back in time for
publication.
</p>
<p>
Blade production at the factory is on pause while the investigation
continues. The executives also stressed that the incident was unrelated
to a blade failure at the Dogger Bank wind farm in the U.K., which was
due to “an installation error out at sea.” Installation is ongoing at
Dogger Bank.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, on the ground and in the water around Nantucket, crews from
Vineyard Wind and GE
<a href="https://nantucket-ma.gov/3176/Week-2-July-22---28" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>continued
to collect blade debris</u></a> on Wednesday morning, for the ninth day
straight. An initial
<a href="https://nantucket-ma.gov/DocumentCenter/View/48366/Vineyard-Wind-CSM---7-23-2024-FINAL-for-Distribution-PDF" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>environmental
assessment</u></a> of the blade debris published late Tuesday night
began to answer key questions about the risks all that debris poses to
people and marine life.
</p>
<p>
The report was commissioned by GE and conducted by Arcadis US, an
engineering and environmental consultancy. It asserts that the primary
risk to people is injury from the sharp edges of fiberglass fragments
and that the debris “are considered inert, non-soluble, stable, and
nontoxic.” It also cautions, however, that further evaluation will be
required to understand the risks posed by any blade materials that
remain in the environment, such as assessing the potential for
degradation.
</p>
<p>
One particularly concerning question has been whether the debris could
discharge dangerous per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, also known as
PFAS or “forever chemicals,” into the environment. Though there are no
PFAS used in the blade construction itself, the firm did identify the
chemicals in “aerodynamic add-ons,” small 6 inch by 8 inch pieces of
plastic that are installed on the outside of the blade to improve its
efficiency that are also commonly used on airplanes, it said.
</p>
<p>
According to the report, the total amount of PFAS on one blade equals
28.2 grams, or about 0.06 pounds. To put that in perspective, the
chemical company Daikin once estimated it would release roughly 200
pounds of PFAS <em><em>per day</em></em> into the wastewater at one of
its paper mills,
<a href="https://blogs.edf.org/health/2018/05/21/pfas-paper-mills/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>according
to federal filings</u></a> obtained by the Environmental Defense Fund in
2018. It’s not yet clear how many of those plastic “add-ons” made it
into the ocean.
</p>
<p>
A comprehensive list of all materials that make up the blades shows that
more than half, by weight, is fiberglass. The other key ingredients
include carbon fiber and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/polyester-pet-plastic-14-dioxane" target="_self"><u>PET
foam</u></a>, a common construction material. “There are 33 different
materials involved in the production of a turbine blade, from the most
basic common household adhesives to the more complex industrial
materials used to build the blade,” the report says.
</p>
<p>
An introduction to the report notes that GE is creating an inventory of
the debris collected to assess how much of the blade has been recovered.
The company has also hired Resolve Marine, a marine salvage firm, to aid
in dismantling the remainder of the blade that’s still attached to the
turbine, though it didn’t offer a timeline for this work.
</p>
<p>
Executives from Vineyard Wind and GE Vernova will be attending a Select
Board meeting in Nantucket Wednesday night. We’ll update this story with
any additional information coming from that.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
In the summer of 1947, I was on vacation in Almelo. Earlier that year,
on the same day as my best friend and inseparable study mate, Brain Jan
Loopstra, I had successfully passed the qualifying exams in mathematics
and physics. The mandatory brief introduction to the three major
laboratories—the Physics Laboratory, the V.d. Waals Laboratory, and the
Zeeman Laboratory—was behind us, and we were about to start our doctoral
studies in experimental physics. For two years, we would be practically
working in one of the aforementioned laboratories.<o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
<o:p> </o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
One day, I received a telegram in Almelo with approximately the
following content: "Would you like to assist in building an automatic
calculating machine?" For assurance, another sentence was added:
"Mr. Loopstra has already agreed." The sender was "The Mathematical
Center," according to further details, located in Amsterdam. I briefly
considered whether my friend had already confirmed my cooperation, but
in that case, the telegram seemed unnecessary, so I dismissed that
assumption. Both scenarios were equally valid: breaking up our
long-standing cooperation (dating back to the beginning of high school)
was simply unthinkable. Furthermore, the telegram contained two
attractive points: "automatic calculating machine" and "Mathematical
Center," both new concepts to me. I couldn’t deduce more than the name
suggested. Since the cost of a telegram exceeded my budget, I posted a
postcard with my answer and resumed my vacation activities. Those of you
who have been involved in recruiting staff will, I assume, be filled
with admiration for this unique example of recruitment tactics: no fuss
about salary or working hours, not to mention irrelevant details like
pension, vacation, and sick leave. For your reassurance, it should be
mentioned that I was indeed offered a salary and benefits, which, in our
eyes, were quite generous.<o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
<o:p> </o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
I wasn’t too concerned about how the new job could be combined with the
mandatory two-year laboratory work. I believed that a solution had to be
found for that. And a solution was found: the laboratory work could be
replaced by our work at the Mathematical Center.<o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
<o:p> </o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
Upon returning to Amsterdam, I found out the following: the Mathematical
Center was founded in 1946, with a goal that could roughly be inferred
from its name. One of the departments was the ‘Calculation Department,’
where diligent young ladies, using hand calculators—colloquially known
as ‘coffee grinders’—numerically solved, for example, differential
equations (in a later stage, so-called ‘bookkeeping machines’ were added
to the machinery). The problems dealt with usually came from external
clients. The head of the Calculation Department was Dr. ir. A. van
Wijngaarden. Stories about automatic calculating machines had also
reached the management of the Mathematical Center, and it was clear from
the outset that such a tool—if viable—could be of great importance,
especially for the Calculation Department. However, it was not possible
to buy this equipment; those who wanted to discuss it had to build it
themselves. Consequently, it was decided to establish a separate group
under the Calculation Department, with the task of constructing an
automatic calculating machine. Given the probable nature of this group’s
activities, it was somewhat an oddity within the Mathematical Center,
doomed to disappear, if not after completing the first machine, then
certainly once this kind of tool became a normal trade
object.<o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
<o:p> </o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
We were not the only group in the Netherlands involved in constructing
calculating machines. As we later discovered, Dr. W.L. v.d. Poel had
already started constructing a machine in 1946.<o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
<o:p> </o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
Our direct boss was Van Wijngaarden, and our newly formed two-man group
was temporarily housed in a room of the Physics Laboratory on Plantage
Muidergracht, where Prof. Clay was in charge. Our first significant act
was the removal of a high-voltage installation in the room, much to the
dismay of Clay, who was fond of the thing but arrived too late to
prevent the disaster. Then we thought it might be useful to equip the
room with some 220V sockets, so we went to Waterlooplein and returned
with a second-hand hammer, pliers, screwdriver, some wire, and a few
wooden (it was 1947!) sockets. I remember wondering whether we could
reasonably submit the exorbitant bill corresponding to these purchases.
Nonetheless, we did.<o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">

</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
After providing our room with voltage, we felt an unpleasant sensation
that something was expected from us, though we had no idea how to start.
We decided to consult the sparse literature. This investigation yielded
two notable articles: one about the ENIAC, a digital (decimal) computer
designed for ballistic problems, and one about a differential analyzer,
a device for solving differential equations, where the values of
variables were represented by continuously variable physical quantities,
in this case, the rotation of shafts. The first article was abominably
written and incomprehensible, and as far as we understood it, it was
daunting, mentioning, for instance, 18,000 vacuum tubes, a number we
were sure our employer could never afford. The second article (by V.
Bush), on the other hand, was excellently written and gave us the idea
that such a thing indeed seemed buildable.<o:p></o:p>

Therefore, it had to be a differential analyzer, and a mechanical one at
that. As we now know, we were betting on the wrong horse, but first, we
didn’t know that, and second, it didn’t really matter. Initially, we
were not up to either task simply because we lacked any electronic
training. We were supposed to master electricity and atomic physics, but
how a vacuum tube looked inside was known only to radio amateurs among
us, and we certainly were not. Our own (preliminary) practicum
contained, to my knowledge, no experiment in which a vacuum tube was the
object of study, and the physics practicum for medical students (the
so-called ‘medical practicum’), where we had supervised for a year as
student assistants, contained exactly one such experiment. It involved a
rectifier, dated by colleagues with some training in archaeology to
about the end of the First World War. The accompanying manual prescribed
turning on the ‘plate voltage’ only tens of seconds after the filament
voltage, and the students had to answer why this instruction was given.
The answers were sometimes very amusing. One such answer I won’t
withhold from you: ‘That is to give the current a chance to go around
once.’<o:p></o:p>

Our first own experiment with a vacuum tube would not have been out of
place in a slapstick movie. It involved a triode, in whose anode circuit
we included a megohm resistor for safety. Safely ensconced behind a
tipped-over table, we turned on the ‘experiment.’ Unlike in a slapstick
movie, nothing significant happened in our case.<o:p></o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
With the help of some textbooks, and not to forget the ‘tube manuals’ of
some manufacturers of these useful objects, we somewhat brushed up on
our electronic knowledge and managed to get a couple of components,
which were supposed to play a role in the differential analyzer, to a
state where their function could at least be guessed. They were a moment
amplifier and a curve follower. How we should perfect these devices so
that they would work reliably and could be produced in some numbers
remained a mystery to us. The solution to this mystery was never found.
Certainly not by me, as around this time (January 1948), I was summoned
to military service, which couldn’t do without me. During the two years
and eight months of my absence (I returned to civilian life in September
1950), a drastic change took place, which I could follow thanks to
frequent contacts with Loopstra.<o:p></o:p>

First, the Mathematical Center, including our group, moved to the
current building at 2nd Boerhaavestraat 49. The building looked somewhat
different back then. The entire building had consisted of two
symmetrically built schools. During the war, the building was
requisitioned by the Germans and used as a garage. In this context, the
outer wall of one of the gymnasiums was demolished. Now, one half was
again in use as a school, and the other half, as well as the attic above
both halves, was assigned to the Mathematical Center. The Germans had
installed a munitions lift in the building. The lift was gone, but the
associated lift shaft was not. Fortunately, few among us had suicidal
tendencies. The frosted glass in the toilet doors (an old school!) had
long since disappeared; for the sake of decorum, curtains were hung in
front of them.<o:p></o:p>

Van Wijngaarden could operate for a long time over a hole in the floor
next to his desk, corresponding with a hole in the ceiling of the room
below (unoccupied). Despite his impressive cigar consumption at that
time, I didn’t notice that this gigantic ashtray ever filled
up.<o:p></o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
The number of employees in our group had meanwhile expanded somewhat;
all in all, perhaps around five.<o:p></o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">

</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
The most significant change in the situation concerned our further
plans. The idea of a differential analyzer was abandoned as it had
become clear that the future belonged to digital computers. Upon my
return, a substantial part of such a computer, the ‘ARRA’ (Automatische
Relais Rekenmachine Amsterdam), had already been realized. The main
components were relays (for various logical functions) and tubes (for
the flip-flops that composed the registers). The relays were Siemens
high-speed relays (switching times in the order of a few milliseconds),
personally retrieved by Loopstra and Van Wijngaarden from an English war
surplus. They contained a single changeover contact (break-before-make),
with make and break contacts rigidly set, although adjustable. Logically
appealing were the two separate coils (with an equal number of
windings): both the inclusive and exclusive OR functions were within
reach. The relays were mounted on octal bases by us and later enclosed
in a plastic bag to prevent contact contamination.<o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
<o:p> </o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
They were a constant source of concern: switching times were unreliable
(especially when the exclusive OR was applied) and contact degradation
occurred nonetheless. Cleaning the contacts (‘polishing the pins’) and
resetting the switching times became a regular pastime, often involving
the girls from the Calculation Department. The setting was done on a
relay tester, and during this setting, the contacts were under
considerable voltage. Although an instrument with a wooden handle was
used for setting, the curses occasionally uttered suggested it was not
entirely effective.<o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
<o:p> </o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
For the flip-flops, double triodes were used, followed by a power tube
to drive a sufficient number of relays, and a pilot lamp for visual
indication of the flip-flop state. Since the A had three registers, each
30 bits wide, there must have been about 90 power tubes, and we noted
with dismay that 90 power tubes oscillated excellently. After some time,
we knew exactly which pilot lamp socket needed a 2-meter wire to
eliminate the oscillation.<o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
<o:p> </o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
At a later stage, a drum (initially, the instructions were read from a
plugboard via step switches) functioned as memory; for input and output,
a tape reader (paper, as magnetic tape was yet to be invented) and a
teleprinter were available. A wooden kitchen table served as the control
desk.<o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
<o:p> </o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
Relays and tubes might have been the main logical building blocks, but
they were certainly not the only ones. Without too much exaggeration, it
can be said that the ARRA was a collection of what the electronic
industry had to offer, a circumstance greatly contributed to by our
frequent trips to Eindhoven, from where we often returned with some
‘sample items.’ On the train back, we first reminisced about the
excellent lunch we had enjoyed and then inventoried to determine if we
brought back enough to cover the travel expenses. This examination
usually turned out positive.<o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
<o:p> </o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
It should be noted that the ARRA was mainly not clocked. Each primitive
operation was followed by an ‘operation complete’ signal, which in turn
started the next operation. It is somewhat amusing that nowadays such a
system is sometimes proposed again (but hopefully more reliable than
what we produced) to prevent glitch problems, a concept we were not
familiar with at the time.<o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
<o:p> </o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
Needless to say, the ARRA was so unreliable that little productive work
could be done with it. However, it was officially put into use. By
mid-1952, this was the case. His Excellency F.J. Th. Rutten, then
Minister of Education, appeared at our place and officially inaugurated
the ARRA with some ceremony. For this purpose, we carefully chose a
demonstration program with minimal risk of failure, namely producing
random numbers à la Fibonacci. We had rehearsed the demonstration so
often that we knew large parts of the output sequence by heart, and we
breathed a sigh of relief when we found that the machine produced the
correct output. In hindsight, I am surprised that this demonstration did
not earn us a reprimand from higher-ups. Imagine: you are the Minister
of Education, thoroughly briefed at the Department about the wonders of
the upcoming computing machines; you attend the official inauguration,
and you are greeted by a group explaining that, to demonstrate these
wonders, the machine will soon produce a series of random numbers. When
the moment arrives, they tell you with beaming faces that the machine
works excellently. I would have assumed that, if not with the truth, at
least with me, they were having a bit of fun. His Excellency remained
friendly, a remarkable display of self-control.<o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
<o:p> </o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
The emotions stirred by this festivity were apparently too much for the
ARRA. After the opening, as far as I recall, no reasonable amount of
useful work was ever produced. After some time, towards the end of 1952,
we decided to give up the ARRA as a hopeless case and do something else.
There was another reason for this decision. The year 1952 should be
considered an excellent harvest year for the Mathematical Center staff:
in March and November of that year, Edsger Dijkstra and Gerrit Blaauw
respectively appeared on the scene. Of these two, the latter is of
particular importance for today’s story and our future narrative. Gerrit
had worked on computers at Harvard, under the supervision of Howard
Aiken. He had also written a dissertation there and was willing to lend
his knowledge and insight to the Mathematical Center. We were not very
compliant boys at that time. Let me put it this way: we were aware that
we did not have a monopoly on wisdom, but we found it highly unlikely
that anyone else would know better. Therefore, the ‘newcomer’ was viewed
with some suspicion. Gerrit’s achievement was all the greater when he
convinced us in a lecture of the validity of what he proposed. And that
was quite something: a clocked machine, uniform building blocks
consisting of various types of AND/OR gates and corresponding
amplifiers, pluggable (and thus interchangeable) units, a neat design
method based on the use of two alternating, separate series of clock
pulses, and proper documentation.<o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
<o:p> </o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
We were sold on the plan and got to work. A small difficulty had to be
overcome: what we intended to do was obviously nothing more or less than
building a new machine, and this fact encountered some political
difficulties. The solution to this problem was simple: formally, it
would be a ‘revision’ of the ARRA. The new machine was thus also called
ARRA II (we shall henceforth speak of A II), but the double bottom was
perfectly clear to any visitor: the frames of the two machines were
distinctly separated, with no connecting wire between them.<o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
<o:p> </o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
For the AND/OR gates, we decided to use selenium diodes. These usually
arrived in the form of selenium rectifiers, a sort of firecrackers of
varying sizes, which we dismantled to extract the individual rectifier
plates, about half the diameter of a modern-day dime. The assembly—the
selenium plates couldn’t tolerate high temperatures, so soldering was
out of the question—was as follows: holes were drilled in a thick piece
of pertinax. One end of the hole was sealed with a metal plug; into the
resulting pot hole went a spring and a selenium plate, and finally, the
other end of the hole was also sealed with a metal plug. For connecting
the plugs, we thought the use of silver paint was appropriate, and soon
we were busy painting our first own circuits. Some time later, we had
plenty of reasons to curse this decision. The reliability of these
connections was poor, to put it mildly, and around this time, the
‘high-frequency hammer’ must have been invented: we took a small hammer
with a rubber head and rattled it along the handles of the units, like a
child running its hand along the railings of a fence. It proved an
effective means to turn intermittent interruptions into permanent ones.
I won’t hazard a guess as to how many interruptions we introduced in
this way. At a later stage, the selenium diodes were replaced by
germanium diodes, which were simply soldered.<o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
<o:p> </o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
The AND/OR gates were followed by a triode amplifier and a cathode
follower. ARRA II also got a drum and a tape reader. For output, an
electric typewriter was installed, with 16 keys operable by placing
magnets underneath them. The decoding tree for these magnets provided us
with the means to build an echo-check, and Dijkstra fabricated a routine
where, simultaneously with printing a number, the same number (if all
went well) was reconstructed. I assume we thus had one of the first
fully controlled print routines. Characteristic of ARRA II’s speed was
the time for an addition: 20 ms (the time of a drum
rotation).<o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
<o:p> </o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
ARRA II came into operation in December 1953, this time without
ministerial assistance, but it performed significantly more useful work
than its predecessor, despite the technical difficulties outlined
above.<o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">

</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
The design phase of ARRA II marks for me the point where computer design
began to become a profession. This was greatly aided by the introduction
of uniform building blocks, describable in a multidimensional binary
state space, making the use of tools like Boolean algebra meaningful. We
figured out how to provide ARRA II with signed multiplicative addition
for integers (i.e., an operation of the form (A,S) := (M) * (±S’) + (A),
for all sign combinations of (A), (S), and (M) before and of the
result), despite the fact that ARRA II had only a counter as wide as a
register. As far as I can recall, this was the first time I devoted a
document to proving that the proposed solution was correct. Undoubtedly,
the proof was in a form I would not be satisfied with today, but still…
It worked as intended, and you can imagine my amusement when, years
later, I learned from a French book on computers that this problem was
considered unsolvable.<o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
<o:p> </o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
In May 1954, work began on a (slightly modified) copy of ARRA II, the
FERTA (Fokker’s First Calculating Machine Type A), intended for Fokker.
The FERTA was handed over to Fokker in April 1955. This entire affair
was mainly handled by Blaauw and Dijkstra. Shortly thereafter, Blaauw
left the service of the Mathematical Center.<o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
<o:p> </o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
In June 1956, the ARMAC (Automatic Calculating Machine Mathematical
Center), successor to ARRA II, was put into operation, several dozen
times faster than its predecessor. Design and construction took about 1½
years. Worth mentioning is that the ARMAC first used cores, albeit on a
modest scale (in total 64 words of 34 bits each, I believe). For
generating the horizontal and vertical selection currents for these
cores, we used large cores. To drive these large cores, however, they
had to be equipped with a coil with a reasonable number of windings.
Extensive embroidery work didn’t seem appealing to us, so the following
solution was devised: a (fairly deep) rim was turned from transparent
plastic. Thus, we now had two rings: the rim and the core. The rim was
sawed at one place, and the flexibility of the material made it possible
to interlock the two rings. Then, the coil was applied to the rim by
rotating it from the outside using a rubber wheel. The result was a
neatly wound coil. The whole thing was then encased in Araldite. The
unintended surprising effect was that, since the refractive indices of
the plastic and Araldite apparently differed little, the plastic rim
became completely invisible. The observer saw a core in the Araldite
with a beautifully regularly wound coil around it. We left many a
visitor in the dark for quite some time about how we produced these
things!<o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
<o:p> </o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
The time of amateurism was coming to an end. Computers began to appear
on the market, and the fact that our group, which had now grown to
several dozen employees, did not really belong in the Mathematical
Center started to become painfully clear to us. Gradual dissolution of
the group was, of course, an option, but that meant destroying a good
piece of know-how. A solution was found when the Nillmij, which had been
automating its administration for some time using Bull punch card
equipment, declared its willingness to take over our group as the core
of a new Dutch computer industry. Thus it happened. The new company,
N.V. Elektrologica, was formally established in 1956, and gradually our
group’s employees were transferred to Elektrologica, a process that was
completed with my own transfer on January 1, 1959. As the first
commercial machine, we designed a fully transistorized computer, the XI,
whose prototype performed its first calculations at the end of 1957. The
speed was about ten times that of the ARMAC.<o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
<o:p> </o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
With this, I consider the period I had to cover as concluded. When I
confront my memories with the title of this lecture, it must be said
that ‘designing computers’ as such hardly existed: the activities that
could be labeled as such were absorbed in the total of concerns that
demanded our attention. Those who engaged in constructing calculating
machines at that time usually worked in very small teams and performed
all the necessary tasks. We decided on the construction of racks, doors,
and closures, the placement of fans (the ARMAC consumed 10 kW!), we
mounted power distribution cabinets and associated wiring, we knew the
available fuses and cross-sections of electrical cables by heart, we
soldered, we peered at oscillographs, we climbed into the machine armed
with a vacuum cleaner to clean it, and, indeed, sometimes we were also
involved in design.<o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
<o:p> </o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
We should not idealize. As you may have gathered from the above, we were
occasionally brought to the brink of despair by technical problems.
Inadequate components plagued us, as did a lack of knowledge and
insight. This lack existed not only in our group but globally the field
was not yet mastered.<o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
<o:p> </o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
However, it was also a fascinating time, marked by a constant sense of
‘never before seen,’ although that may not always have been literally
true. It was a time when organizing overtime, sometimes lasting all
night, posed no problem. It was a time when we knew a large portion of
the participants in international computer conferences at least by
sight!<o:p></o:p>

We now know what a real bipartisan permitting overhaul could look like.
</p>
<p>
Senators Joe Manchin and John Barrasso on Monday unveiled the
<a href="https://www.energy.senate.gov/2024/7/manchin-barrasso-release-bipartisan-energy-permitting-reform-legislation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Energy
Permitting Reform Act</u></a>, the product of months of negotiations
over how to craft a sweeping change to the nation’s federal energy
project approvals system that could actually pass through Congress. It’s
got a little bit of everything: For the oil and gas folks, there’s
mandatory offshore oil and gas lease sales and streamlined permitting
requirements; for renewables, there’s faster permits for “low-impact”
construction jobs and new deployment goals; for transmission, there’s
siting authority for interstate lines, compulsory interregional
planning, and clarity on cost allocation. There are also sections
devoted to helping mining projects navigate legal uncertainties around
mill sites and assistance for hydropower projects needing extended
licenses. Lastly there’s a fresh limit on the length of time allowed for
legal challenges against energy projects of all types.
</p>
<p>
In other words, it’s an energy smorgasbord, and all sorts of fuels and
resources are invited to the party.
</p>
<p>
Will such a bill be able to sail through Congress in the middle of a
close election cycle? Unclear, but highly doubtful. Will it be able to
overcome opposition from the major environmental groups — Sierra Club,
the Natural Resources Defense Council, and Earthjustice — that stymied
Manchin’s prior permitting deal? We have yet to hear from President Joe
Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, or congressional Democratic leaders
on whether they support the bill, and representatives for the White
House and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer did not respond to
requests for comment.
</p>
<p>
But to the people most deeply invested in bipartisan permitting
compromise, none of that matters — for now, at least. In their view,
this bill sets the parameters for whatever permitting deal will
eventually become law, whether that’s in this Congress or the next.
</p>
<p>
“Some of the environmental community is going to look at this and see it
as a net win for climate change, and some in the environmental community
are more anti-fossil fuel than they are pro-reducing emissions, and so
it’s harder for them to get over the fossil fuel aspect of the bill,”
Xan Fishman, senior director of the energy program at the Bipartisan
Policy Center, told me. “But to some extent, that’s how bipartisan deals
come together. Not everyone is going to be happy.”
</p>
<p>
The biggest gain for energy transition advocates is plainly the
transmission language. Since the Inflation Reduction Act (which also
similarly frustrated environmental groups with its giveaways to oil and
gas) became law, it has been
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/permitting-reform-transmission-nepa-geothermal" target="_self"><u>painfully
apparent</u></a> that easing the federal permitting burden on
transmission could speed up the deployment of renewables projects
boosted by the climate law. But Republicans have so far been unwilling
to consider advancing transmission support on its own, in which case the
Beltway Elite conventional wisdom calls for sweetening the deal with
measures that benefit fossil fuels.
</p>
<p>
Agencies have already tried to advance permitting assistance sans new
legislation. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has advanced a
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/ferc-transmission-planning-rule" target="_self"><u>potential
fix</u></a> to regional transmission planning via Order 1920, and the
Interior Department has
<a href="https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-department-proposes-rule-bolster-solar-and-wind-development-public-lands" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>moved
forward</u></a> with regulation to ease permitting burdens on solar and
wind projects. Congress has also moved piecemeal solutions to
sector-specific problems, such as the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/advance-act-fusion" target="_self"><u>ADVANCE
Act</u></a>, which provided federal officials with new legal resources
to process cutting-edge nuclear projects. But these have not achieved
anything close to the broad changes that industry representatives say
are needed for the overall permitting regime.
</p>
<p>
Fishman and other observers in D.C. expect Manchin to try and move the
bill out of his Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee
imminently, but it’s best shot of seeing the floor won’t come until
after the election, during the so-called “lame duck” session. They’re
also expecting more permitting proposals out of a different committee,
Senate Environment and Public Works, which has key jurisdiction over
activities of the Environmental Protection Agency. Manchin couldn’t
touch those because they don’t fall under the remit of his committee,
but advocates for a deal believe EPA language would help relieve more of
the burden projects face.
</p>
<p>
Yet with some
<a href="https://x.com/SenatorHick/status/1815803108217246109" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>climate
Democrats</u></a> coming out in support of the bill already, those
seeking a permitting deal say the immediate odds for the
Manchin-Barrasso bill enactment into law are not at all the point. What
matters is that we now have a real life example of what a true blue
bipartisan compromise on permitting that advances the energy transition
can look like.
</p>
<p>
“Even if this doesn’t pass, this is the baseline for conversations,”
Ryan Fitzpatrick of Third Way told me. “This is a net win for climate …
it’s the starting point, however it may be adapted.”

<h2 id="on-goals-online-projects-and-the-usefulness-of-money">On goals,
online projects, and the usefulness of money</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-24, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;I’m currently a &lt;em&gt;“&lt;a href=&quot;https://getkirby.com/partners&quot;&gt;Certified Kirby Partner&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/em&gt;. Fancy title, I know. What that means is that I paid some money, last summer, to be listed on a website. This upcoming August, I will no longer be a &lt;em&gt;“Certified Kirby Partner”&lt;/em&gt; because I am not going to pay money—again—to be listed on a website. But my certified status is not what I want to write about. It’s just an excuse to talk about the role money plays in achieving goals in the context of online projects.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
Most online projects exist to fulfil a goal. Sometimes that goal is
stated, sometimes it’s implied. And money may or may not be an aid in
achieving said goal. I was chatting about online communities with
<a href="https://kevquirk.com/blog">Kev</a> the other day and we both
reached the same conclusion that in order to create something meaningful
in that space it has to be a paid product. Not because you need that to
make it sustainable financially but because a monetary commitment—even a
small one—is a helpful tool to find people who are genuinely interested
in what you’re creating. You’re not likely to spend money on something
you don’t care about. So in that context, money is a helpful tool to
achieve the goal of creating a small community of people who care about
the shared space.
</p>
<p>
That same way of reasoning wouldn’t make sense for something like my
<a href="https://peopleandblogs.com">People and Blogs</a> series. My
goal with that project is to help as many people as possible rediscover
the beauty of having a personal blog and owning your corner of the web,
and to encourage a healthier way to live online. Making it a paid series
wouldn’t help me reach that goal. It would probably be an obstacle. This
is why I started the series knowing it was going to be a cost for me
both in terms of time and in terms of actual money but it was one I was
willing to sustain because I believe it’s important.
</p>
<p>
It’s easy for me to commit to paying money when stated goals and
monetisation schemes are aligned. To bring it back to Kirby, I
absolutely love it both as a tool and as a project. It’s been run
fantastically for more than a decade by a great group of people and I
have nothing but positive things to say about it. I plan to keep using
it and buying licenses for as long as they stay in business. But it’s
also why I won’t pay again to be a <em>“Certified Kirby Partner”</em>.
Because there the stated goals and the monetisation scheme are not
aligned. As they say, money talks.

<h2 id="us-links-pakistans-economic-growth-to-political-stability">US
links Pakistan’s economic growth to political stability</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD — The United States urged Pakistan Wednesday to protect the
rights of all citizens, including freedom of expression and assembly, as
a military-backed crackdown on the opposition party of jailed former
prime minister Imran Khan continues.</p>
<p>Donald Blome, the U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, stressed during a
seminar in Islamabad that upholding constitutionally guaranteed rights
is crucial to the country’s economic progress.</p>
<p>“Protecting human rights for all is not just a fundamental pillar of
a democracy; it’s a critical component of a vibrant and stable society
drawing on the talents and contributions of all its citizens for the
country’s benefits,” Blome said.</p>
<p>“Without such stability, the prospects for investment and economic
growth appear far less certain,” he noted, without directly naming
Pakistani political stakeholders.</p>
<p>The U.S. ambassador’s remarks came as Pakistan faces prolonged
political turmoil stemming from Khan’s removal from power in 2022
through a parliamentary no-confidence vote and his subsequent
imprisonment last August, which the United Nations described as having
no legal basis.</p>
<p>The ongoing crackdown has led to the arrest of hundreds of supporters
of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, or PTI, party, including women.</p>
<p>This week, police raided the PTI’s headquarters in the Pakistani
capital, detaining its chief spokesman and several other media team
professionals, accusing them of running an “anti-state campaign.”</p>
<p>Khan’s aides have denounced the arrests as part of a campaign of
suppression and intimidation.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s coalition government, struggling to
address Pakistan’s deep economic problems, has publicly stated its
intention to ban the party over charges of anti-state activities and
maligning the military.</p>
<p>“We will, under no circumstances, tolerate such actions against our
motherland, innocent people, or the armed forces of Pakistan,” Sharif
reiterated Wednesday, while presiding over a cabinet meeting.</p>
<p>The threat of banning the country’s most popular and the single
largest party in parliament has further fueled political tensions.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, during a congressional hearing in Washington, the
crackdown and potential banning of the Pakistani opposition party also
came under discussion when Donald Lu, the U.S. assistant secretary of
state, was responding to questions from lawmakers.</p>
<p>Democratic Congressman Brad Sherman, a senior member of the House
Foreign Affairs Committee, raised the issue of Pakistan banning Khan
from holding public office and preventing his party from using its
iconic cricket bat symbol on the ballots in the February 8 vote.</p>
<p>“The information minister and two other ministers have said that they
want to ban the PTI. And we see in the latest development that the PTI
office has been sealed, their national information security and many
women have been arrested,” Sherman said.</p>
<p>“The best thing you can do is ask Ambassador Blome to go visit Imran
Khan in prison, and I wonder if you would consider that,” the
congressmen told Lu. “We’ll definitely discuss it with Ambassador
Blome,” responded the assistant secretary of state.</p>
<p>“Pakistan’s future must be decided by its people. It’s clear that the
PTI is Pakistan’s most popular party. I disagree with Imran Khan on many
things, but it’s the right of Pakistan’s people to choose their leader,”
Sherman wrote on his social media X platform after the hearing.</p>
<p>Khan’s arrest last year sparked violent street protests in Pakistan,
with some of his supporters attacking facilities linked to the country’s
powerful military.</p>
<p>The Sharif government and the military used the riots to defend the
crackdown on the PTI and as a reason to keep Khan in prison after
several of his convictions in other cases were recently overturned by
appeals courts for lack of evidence.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the Supreme Court ruled that the PTI was eligible
for around two dozen extra reserved seats in parliament, saying the
Election Commission of Pakistan deprived the party of them in breach of
the constitution.</p>
<p>Once implemented, the verdict will further strengthen the PTI in the
parliament and weaken the ruling coalition. It has also given credence
to the opposition and independent monitors’ allegations that the
February 8 elections were rigged in favor of pro-military parties and
prevented the PTI from sweeping the polls.</p>
<p>Khan, 71, rejects all charges against him — ranging from corruption
to sedition and a fraudulent marriage — as politically motivated and
part of a larger effort by the military to keep him and his party from
returning to power.</p>
<p>The former cricket hero turned politician insists on the return of
his party’s “stolen mandate” or new elections overseen by an impartial
election commission.</p>
<p>Sharif, who has the backing of the military, denies his government is
unfairly targeting Khan and his party, saying it was determined to bring
to justice those responsible for the May 2023 attacks on military
facilities.</p>
<p>Last month, the U.S. House of Representatives overwhelmingly voted
368-7 to approve a resolution urging “the full and independent
investigation of claims of interference or irregularities” in Pakistan’s
election, a move Islamabad rejected.</p>

surfaces, capsizes fishing boat off New Hampshire coast</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>RYE, New Hampshire — Two fishermen are safe after a whale crashed
onto their boat, capsizing it off the New Hampshire shore, according to
the U.S. Coast Guard. </p>
<p>The incident occurred Tuesday near Odiorne Point State Park in Rye.
The two men, who were thrown overboard, said they had seen the whale
earlier and were trying to keep their distance. </p>
<p>“He went under, he disappeared for a few minutes, and then the next
thing we know, he just popped right up on our transom,” fisherman Ryland
Kenney told WMUR-TV. </p>
<p>The Coast Guard posted to social media platform X that they had
received a mayday call stating that a 7-meter center console boat had
turned over because of a whale breach. </p>
<p>“The occupants were ejected from the vessel as the boat capsized,”
the Coast Guard posted, adding that an urgent marine information
broadcast was issued, and the Coast Guard Station Portsmouth Harbor was
alerted. </p>
<p>“A good Samaritan recovered both individuals from the water. No
injuries were reported,” the Coast Guard posted. </p>
<p>The rescuers were two young brothers. </p>
<p>“I saw it come up, and I was just like, ‘Oh, it’s going to hit the
boat,’” Wyatt Yager told the station. “It started to flip.” His brother,
Colin Yager, caught what happened on his phone. </p>
<p>The boat crew from Station Portsmouth reported that the whale
appeared not to be injured. The incident was reported to the Center of
Coastal Studies Marine Animal Hotline and the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration. </p>
<p>The vessel has also been salvaged. </p>
<p>The whale probably did not know the boat was there, said Sara Morris
of the University of New Hampshire Shoals Marine Laboratory. </p>
<p>“If you look at the video really carefully, you can see that the
whale has its mouth open,” she told the station. “It looks like it’s
lunge feeding and actually trying to catch fish.”</p>

Gauff to be female flag bearer for US team at Olympic opening ceremony,
joining LeBron James</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Paris — Tennis star Coco Gauff will join LeBron James as a flag
bearer for the U.S. Olympic team at Friday’s opening ceremony.</p>
<p>Gauff, the reigning U.S. Open champion, is set to make her Olympic
debut at the Paris Games and will be the first tennis athlete to carry
the U.S. flag. She and James were chosen by Team USA athletes.</p>
<p>“I mean, for me, the Olympics is a top priority. I would say equal to
the Grand Slams. I wouldn’t put it above or below, just because I’ve
never played before. This is my first time,” Gauff said earlier this
year. “Obviously, I always want to do well, try to get a medal.”</p>
<p>Gauff and James, the 39-year-old leading scorer in NBA history, both
compete in sports that are outside the traditional Olympic world and get
attention year-round, not just every four years.</p>
<p>The 20-year-old Gauff made the American team for the Tokyo Games
three years ago as a teenager but had to sit out those Olympics because
she tested positive for COVID-19 right before she was supposed to fly to
Japan.</p>
<p>Now Gauff, who is based in Florida, is a Grand Slam title winner in
singles and doubles. She won her first major championship in New York in
September, defeating Aryna Sabalenka in the singles final of the U.S.
Open, then added her first Grand Slam doubles trophy at the French Open
this June alongside Katerina Siniakova of the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>The same clay courts at Roland Garros used for the French Open will
be where matches are going to be held for the Paris Olympics. The draw
to set the brackets is Thursday, and play begins on Saturday.</p>
<p>Gauff is seeded No. 2 in singles, matching her current WTA ranking
behind No. 1 Iga Swiatek of Poland, and will be among the medal
favorites.</p>
<p>She and her usual doubles partner, Jessica Pegula, are seeded No. 1
in women’s doubles. It’s possible Gauff could also be entered in mixed
doubles, but those pairings have not been announced yet.</p>
<p>“I’m not putting too much pressure on it, because I really want to
fully indulge in the experience,” Gauff said about her Olympics debut.
“Hopefully I can have the experience multiple times in my lifetime,
(but) I’ll treat it as a once-in-a-lifetime experience.”</p>

<p>
“Last week, the founders of venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz
declared their allegiance to Donald Trump in their customary fashion:
talking about money on a podcast.
</p>
<p>
“Sorry, Mom,” Ben Horowitz says in an episode of The Ben &amp; Marc
Show. “I know you’re going to be mad at me for this. But, like, we have
to do it.”“
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
No, you don’t.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://werd.io/2024/can-jd-vances-populist-crusade-succeed">As
I’ve discussed before</a>, investors like Andreessen and Horowitz are
putting concerns about crypto regulation and taxation of unrealized
gains over a host of social issues that include mass deportations, an
increase in death sentences, military police in our cities, and
potential ends to contraception and no-fault divorce. It’s myopic,
selfish, and stupid.
</p>
<p>
It looks even more so in a world where Trump is reportedly already
regretting appointing JD Vance as his Vice Presidential candidate and
where Musk has reneged on his $45M a month pledge to a Trump PAC. They
come out looking awful.
</p>
<p>
The progressive thing to do would be to starve their firm: founders who
care about those issues should pledge not to let a16z into their rounds,
and other VCs should refuse to join rounds where a16z is present. This
is likely too much activism for Silicon Valley, but it would send the
strong signal that’s needed here.
</p>
<p>
The desire for profit must never trump our duty of care to society’s
most vulnerable. Agreeing with this statement should be a no-brainer -
but we’re quickly learning how many would much rather put themselves
first.

id="ioc-awards-2034-winter-games-to-utah-pushes-state-officials-to-help-end-investigation">IOC
awards 2034 Winter Games to Utah, pushes state officials to help end
investigation</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Paris — What was expected to be a simple coronation of Salt Lake City
as the 2034 Winter Olympic host turned into complicated Olympic politics
Wednesday, as the IOC pushed Utah officials to end an FBI investigation
into a suspected doping coverup.</p>
<p>The International Olympic Committee is angry about an ongoing U.S.
federal investigation of suspected doping by Chinese swimmers who were
allowed to compete at the Tokyo Games despite positive drug tests. The
World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) accepted Chinese explanations for the
tests, and U.S. officials are now investigating that decision under an
anti-conspiracy law passed after the Russian doping scandal at the Sochi
Winter Games.</p>
<p>President Thomas Bach wants to make sure WADA is the sole authority
on Olympic doping cases, especially with the Sumer Olympics headed to
Los Angeles in 2028. The IOC added a clause to Salt Lake’s host
contract, demanding that local organizers - including Utah Gov. Spencer
Cox - push to shut down the federal investigation or risk losing the
Olympics.</p>
<p>Cox and others promised to lobby the U.S. president and Congress.</p>
<p>“We agree that if the United States does not support or violates the
World Anti-Doping Federation’s rules, that they can withdraw the Games
from from us and from the United States,” Cox said after the
announcement. “That was the only way that that we could we could
guarantee that we would get the Games.”</p>
<p>Even in the world Olympic diplomacy, it was a stunning power move to
force government officials to publicly agree to do the IOC’s
lobbying. </p>
<p>After getting the Utah contingent’s agreement on the clause, the IOC
formally awarded the 2034 Winter Games to Salt Lake in an 83-6
vote. </p>
<p>The capital city of Utah was the only candidate after the IOC gave
Salt Lake City exclusive negotiating rights last year in a fast-tracked
process.</p>
<p>The campaign team presenting the bid on stage to IOC members included
Cox, Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall and Alpine ski great Lindsey
Vonn. Back home, a 3 a.m. public watch party gathered to see the
broadcast from Paris.</p>
<p>The clause inserted into the contract requires Utah officials to to
work with current and future U.S. presidents and members of Congress “to
alleviate your concerns” about the federal investigation into
doping.</p>
<p>The IOC clause allows the Olympic body to terminate Salt Lake City’s
deal if the authority of WADA was undermined on U.S. territory. </p>
<p>WADA’s role is under scrutiny for accepting a Chinese investigation
that declared all 23 swimmers were contaminated by traces of a banned
heart medication in a hotel kitchen. Three Chinese gold medals in the
Tokyo Olympic pool were won by swimmers implicated in the case. Some are
also competing in Paris next week.</p>
<p>The case an be investigated in the U.S. under federal legislation
named for a whistleblower of Russian state doping at the 2014 Sochi
Winter Games.</p>
<p>The IOC and WADA lobbied against passing the law, known as the
Rodchenkov Act, which gives U.S. federal agencies wide jurisdiction of
doping enforcement worldwide ahead of Los Angeles hosting the 2028
Summer Games.</p>
<p>“We will work with our members of Congress,” Gov. Cox told Bach and
IOC voters ahead of the 2034 vote, “we will use all the levers of power
open to us to resolve these concerns.”</p>
<p>Salt Lake City first hosted the Winter Games in 2002. That bid was
hit with a bribery scandal, which led to anti-corruption reforms at the
IOC.</p>
<p>Future U.S. Sen. Mitt Romney was brought in to clean up the Games,
which went off well despite tightened security. The Games were the
biggest international sports event hosted by the U.S. following the
Sept. 11 attacks five months earlier.</p>
<p>“I am sorry for you, and for us, that this issue arose now,” Bach
said, addressing the Salt Lake City delegation ahead of the vote.</p>
<p>It is an Olympic tradition for lawmakers and even heads of state to
come to an IOC meeting and plead their case to be anointed as an host
city.</p>
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin did it in 2007, speaking in English
to secure the 2014 Winter Games for Sochi. British Prime Minister Tony
Blair made a key intervention in 2005 to help win the 2012 Olympics for
London. U.S. President Barack Obama’s visit to Copenhagen in 2009 did
not help in Chicago’s losing cause for the 2016 Summer Games that went
to Rio de Janeiro.</p>
<p>For its second turn, Salt Lake City will get almost 10 full years to
prepare — the longest lead-in for a modern Winter Games — amid
longer-term concerns about climate change affecting snow sports and
reducing the pool of potential hosts.</p>
<p>Salt Lake City opted to target 2034 and so avoided potential
commercial and logistical clashes with the 2028 Summer Games being
hosted by Los Angeles.</p>
<p>It will be the fifth Winter Games in the U.S. Before Salt Lake City
in 2002, there was Lake Placid in 1980 and 1932, and Squaw Valley — now
known as Olympic Valley — in 1960.</p>
<p>In a separate decision earlier in Paris, the 2030 Winter Games was
awarded — with conditions — to France for a regional project split
between ski resorts in the Alps and the French Riviera city Nice.</p>
<p>That project needs official signoff from the national government
being formed, and the Prime Minister yet to be confirmed, after recent
elections called by President Emmanuel Macron. He helped present the
2030 bid Wednesday to IOC members.</p>

N2O. This gas is far more potent than carbon dioxide but doesn’t last as
long in the atmosphere. The White House said the new initiative would
seek to reduce N2O emissions from industry by 50% next year compared to
2020 levels as companies work to curb their own pollution. The U.S. will
also try to work with China to reduce these emissions from chemical
plants across both countries. Together, the U.S. and China produce about
80% of industrial N2O pollution. “If successful, the two countries could
reduce greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to taking approximately 50
million automobiles off the road at a fraction of the cost of other
emission reduction efforts,” <em><em>Inside Climate News

of Americans</u></a> were reminded that we are living in extraordinary
times. At moments, it almost seemed like you could

<a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/glen-powell-interview-2024" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>been
passed the torch</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
I am talking, of course, about the <em><em>Twister</em></em> sequel.
</p>
<p>
<em><em>Twisters</em></em> touched down in theaters last Friday, nearly
30 years after its precursor was released on LaserDisc and VHS with a
message from the FEMA administrator to
“<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1996/10/15/fema-goes-hollywood-in-path-of-twister/3718ba80-6f4d-4b72-90a5-eeefe4259b91/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>never
try to outdrive a tornado</u></a>.” For Hollywood reboots and the
meteorological sciences both, three decades is an eon;
<em><em>Twisters</em></em>’ lead actress, Daisy Edgar-Jones, was born
two years after <em><em>Twister</em></em> premiered, and while Helen
Hunt’s Jo had dreamed of improving tornado warning times in the
mid-1990s, the Millennial storm chasers in <em><em>Twisters
</em></em>own drones and plausibly discuss snuffing out the storms
entirely. (Speaking of warnings: There are spoilers ahead.)
</p>
<p>
<em><em>Twisters</em></em> is a movie that loves science and shows its
work. Director Lee Isaac Chung reportedly consulted researchers from the
<a href="https://www.noaa.gov/twisters-noaa-tornado-science-behind-the-scenes" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</u></a> and
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/weather/twisters-tornado-storm-chasers-real.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>elsewhere</u></a>
to get the basic facts right, and in the opening minutes of the film,
the screenplay debunks the common “one Mississippi” method of
calculating a storm’s distance (in case you’re not familiar,
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=848687651852546&id=126747474046571&set=a.129569323764386&locale=zh_CN" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>here’s
an explanation</u></a>); casually references
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Lagrangian
mechanics</u></a>; and features a memorable PSA on why you should
<a href="https://community.fema.gov/ProtectiveActions/s/article/Tornado-Vehicle-Do-Not-Use-Overpass-Underpass-as-Shelter" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>never
use an overpass for shelter</u></a> during a tornado.
<em><em>Twisters</em></em> protagonists work for, or use taxpayer-funded
technologies from, NOAA, the National Weather Service, and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/russ-vought-schedule-f#:~:text=how%20connected%20climate%20hazards%20are%20to%20the%20core%20duties%20of%20what%20the%20military%20is%20focused%20on" target="_self"><u>the
military</u></a> — a particularly meaningful inclusion at a time when
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2024/07/noaa-project-2025-weather/678987/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>government-funded
science is under open threat</u></a> by
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-climate-change-project-2025" target="_self"><u>one
of the leading candidates</u></a> for highest office.
</p>
<p>
Even <em><em>Twisters</em></em>’ lack of focus on climate change is
relatively accurate: While it might feel odd for there not to be an
obvious
<a href="https://slate.com/culture/2024/07/twisters-2024-movie-glen-powell-climate-change.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>climate
nod</u></a> in a weather disaster movie, scientists still haven’t
demonstrated
<a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/is-extreme-weather-climate-change#:~:text=regional%20variability.-,Tornadoes,-Tornadoes%20are%20extremely" target="_self"><u>a
strong correlation</u></a> between global warming and tornadoes.
Suggesting otherwise might actually have done <em><em>more</em></em>
damage to public understanding by blurring the line between a
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/summer-2024-heat-records" target="_self"><u>frightening
enough reality</u></a> and Hollywood fiction in the name of topical
relevance.
</p>
<p>
Still,<em><em> Twisters</em></em> does take some dramatic liberties. At
one point, a weaker EF1 tornado
<a href="https://youtu.be/wdok0rZdmx4?feature=shared&t=67" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>breaks
the blade</u></a> off a wind turbine,
<a href="https://www.euronews.com/green/2024/05/23/powerful-tornado-topples-wind-turbines-in-us-experts-say-such-destruction-is-extremely-rar" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>which
probably wouldn’t happen</u></a>. The most egregious liberty, however,
comes at the end of the film, when a tornado
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yqv_GmlQTIQ&ab_channel=NOAAWeatherPartners" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>runs
through an oil and gas refinery</u></a> and wreaks havoc on the town of
El Reno, Oklahoma. “The shelters are full; we’ve got to get everyone to
the movie theater!” one character shouts when it becomes clear El Reno
is on the verge of catastrophe. (I bet Warner
Bros. <em><em>loved</em></em> that one.) But at just the moment when the
tornado rips out the wall of the theater, turning the defacto shelter
full of innocent people into
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mGPA1HgHhw&ab_channel=It%27sJustWeirdEsotericMediaClips" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
suck zone</u></a>, Edgar-Jones’ character Kate is able to deploy a
technology that decreases the moisture inside the twister, making it
instantly collapse and dissolve.
</p>
<p>
To be clear, this is about as scientifically accurate as a Sharknado.
Though the mechanics are real — Kate shoots the tornado with silver
iodide, currently
<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/eight-states-are-seeding-clouds-to-overcome-megadrought/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>used
in cloud seeding</u></a>, to induce moisture, then saps the storm of
water using sodium polyacrylate — the amount of absorbent material
required to actually “tame” a tornado would be
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L18AY1VpVOY&t=1s&ab_channel=NOAAWeatherPartners" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>impossible
to deploy</u></a>. A twister also wouldn’t vanish instantly even if
enough chemicals somehow <em><em>could</em></em> disrupt its moisture
content. As Kevin Kelleher, a scientist who consulted on both
<em><em>Twister</em></em>(<em><em>s</em></em>),
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/weather/twisters-tornado-storm-chasers-real.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>told
</u><u><em><em>The New York Times</em></em></u></a><em><em>,</em></em>
it would likely take closer to 15 to 20 minutes for a storm to — again,
theoretically — collapse.
</p>
<p>
What is more interesting than <em><em>Twisters</em></em>’ dubious
tornado-taming technique, though, is that it’s a rare positive example
of geoengineering in an American film. Prior to Friday, the most
memorable example of geoengineering in a widely seen movie was in
<em><em>Snowpiercer</em></em>, where an attempt to correct global
warming goes so awry that Chris Evans is forced to live on a train and
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufzNMqqKCi8&ab_channel=AustinStorm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>eat
babies</u></a>. (This is a safe space from discussion of
<em><em>Geostorm</em></em>.)
</p>
<p>
<em><em>Twisters </em></em>never reaches the point of exploring
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/geoengineering-solar-radiation-china-united-states" target="_self"><u>the
ethics</u></a> or potential downsides of Kate’s geoengineering
experiment, and the credits roll over magazine and newspaper articles
lauding her for “Taking Weather Science by Storm.” But Chung, the
director, doesn’t let the moment pass entirely unremarked upon, either.
The movie showing in the theater when the tornado hits El Reno is
<em><em>Frankenstein</em></em> — perhaps our most famous parable about
the hubris of playing God.
</p>
<p>
Movies don’t need to be accurate to be good, but<em><em>
Twisters</em></em> nevertheless makes research and data the objective,
nerds the
<a href="https://www.thewrap.com/twisters-glen-powell-wet-t-shirt-scene/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>hot
heroes</u></a>, and real-life scientists the
<a href="https://www.noaa.gov/twisters-noaa-tornado-science-behind-the-scenes#:~:text=props%20and%20people-,(as%20unpaid%20extras),-throughout.%20Our%20scientists" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>background
extras</u></a>. In keeping with its dedication to science, it also takes
geoengineering out of the realm of the dystopic; while there are plenty
of people still staunchly opposed to climate modification, it is also no
longer “one of climate science’s biggest taboos,” as my colleague
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/climate-tech-geoengineering-carbon-removal" target="_self"><u>Robinson
Meyer has written</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Far more importantly, though, <em><em>Twisters</em></em> is a blast. It
never tries to be anything more than what it is: a popcorn-worthy
romantic disaster movie. Accuracy is just the cherry on top for us
weather nerds in the audience; as one character rightly puts it: “Smile
man — science is fun.”

The world uses about 30 billion tons of concrete every year — more than
any other material except water. It is the most ubiquitous human-made
substance in the global economy. It’s also a huge climate problem.
Producing cement, which is the key ingredient in concrete, generates
roughly 8% of global annual greenhouse gas emissions.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://x.com/cody_finke" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Cody
Finke</u></a> has a plan to change that. He is the chief executive
officer and cofounder of Brimstone, a startup that says it can cheaply
produce ordinary Portland cement — the kind used in construction
worldwide — without carbon emissions. This week, Rob chats with Finke
about why cement’s carbon emissions aren’t from fossil fuels, why there
are fewer cement plants than you might think, and the all-important
difference between cement and concrete.

Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Robinson Meyer: </strong>Concrete is such an archetypal big
machine problem in decarbonization. Because not only is it carbon
intensive, but also — like car engines or like plane engines but,
notably, unlike power plants — maybe like power plants — the technology
to do it is extremely dispersed. There are hundreds of thousands of
concrete plants around the world, and they all have to be replaced to
decarbonize this process. It’s just a huge, huge scaling endeavor, and
one that, forces you to reckon with the material implications of
decarbonization in a way that, I think, it can often be easier to skip
over or, just think, in the form of electricity: <em><em>Oh, we can just
drop new power plants in, we can build renewables</em></em>. But that’s
not how decarbonizing concrete will work.<br/> <br/> <strong>Cody
Finke:</strong> I would actually want to challenge that slightly.<br/>
<br/> <strong>Meyer: </strong>Perfect.<br/> <br/> <strong>Finke:
</strong>So, for many solutions, that’s the case because you’re
absolutely right, there are hundreds of thousands of concrete plants.
But there are not hundreds of thousands of cement plants. Cement is the
binder in concrete, and for the listeners —<br/> <br/> <strong>Meyer:
</strong>Yeah, let’s actually do this because clearly I also don’t fully
understand.<br/> <br/> <strong>Finke: </strong>Concrete’s the building
material. It is the most consumed material on the planet. We make 40 to
50 billion tons of it every year as humans. Concrete is sand, gravel,
water, and cement — cement is the glue. Without cement, concrete would
just be a pile of sand and gravel — a wet pile of sand and gravel.
Cement is essential for turning that pile of sand and gravel into a
pourable rock.<br/> <br/> But cement is only about 10% of concrete — 10%
to 20% — and it’s made in large, centralized facilities that are located
basically around big population centers. There are only 2,000 or 3,000
cement plants in the world. So it depends on your solution, right? If
your solution is making a novel material, then it may require working at
the concrete level, which can be good and bad. There’s a lot of those
facilities, but they’re also a bit cheaper. There’s good and bad
attributes of that.<br/> <br/> But if you were to do something like what
Brimstone is doing, which is making ordinary Portland cement, then what
you have to do is replace those 2,000 or 3,000 cement plants, which is
still a big number —<br/> <br/> <strong>Meyer:</strong> It is still a
big number, but actually not a very big number.

id="in-indianapolis-harris-addresses-black-sorority-a-key-campaign-mobilizer">In
Indianapolis, Harris addresses Black sorority, a key campaign
mobilizer</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Indianapolis — U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris delivered a speech
to a historically Black sorority in Indianapolis on Wednesday, marking
one of her first public appearances since President Joe Biden dropped
out of the 2024 presidential race and endorsed her for the Democratic
Party nomination on Sunday.</p>
<p>Speaking at the biennial gathering of the Zeta Phi Beta (ZPB)
sorority, Harris delivered a speech that closely echoed remarks made on
the campaign trail, though the event was part of her official duties as
vice president.</p>
<p>Founded in 1920 at Harris’ alma mater, Howard University, ZPB is one
of the nation’s largest historically Black sororities — social
organizations with female-only memberships at colleges and universities
whose purpose is to foster community, academic achievement and career
development, among other things.</p>
<p>In remarks during the visit, announced as an official White House
stop before Biden dropped out, Harris lauded the president, saying that
“we are deeply, deeply grateful for his service to our nation.”</p>
<p>“He cares about the future, he thinks about the future,” Harris said.
“He has extraordinary determination and profound compassion for the
people of our country.”</p>
<p>Earlier this month in Dallas, Texas, Harris spoke to more than 20,000
members and alumnae of her own sorority at Howard University, Alpha
Kappa Alpha Sorority Inc., at its national convention.</p>
<p>Sorority figures play key roles in the group Win With Black Women,
which organized a Zoom call with 44,000 attendees just hours after Biden
endorsed Harris. The group said it raised more than $1.5 million for her
campaign in just a few hours.</p>
<p>A similar effort by Win With Black Men raised more than $1 million,
adding to the $100 million raised by the Harris campaign in less than 48
hours. This is in addition to money raised by political action
committees separate from the campaign. The largest one, the Future
Forward PAC, reported $150 million in commitments in the first 24
hours.</p>
<p>Sororities and fraternities</p>
<p>There are nine historically Black sororities — and fraternities,
their male equivalent — known as the “Divine Nine.”</p>
<p>Sororities and fraternities are among the most important networks in
the African American community, said Steve Phillips, founder of the
political media organization Democracy in Color, and author of several
books on demographic shifts in the American electorate.</p>
<p>“Members are passionate, energetic and engaged throughout their
entire lives,” he told VOA, so these pre-existing and highly involved
groups can swiftly emerge as formidable campaign resources.</p>
<p>“We saw some of this with [Barack] Obama in 2007 and 2008, and I
expect it to be another order of magnitude fundraising and volunteering
with Harris,” he said.</p>
<p>Sororities are pathways to another key resource — Black female
celebrities.</p>
<p>These groups are actively recruiting notable figures and celebrities
as honorary members, said Samantha N. Sheppard, Associate Professor and
Chair of the Department of Performing and Media Arts at Cornell
University.</p>
<p>With Hollywood big names including Kerry Washington, Viola Davis,
Jenifer Lewis and others pledging support for Harris, the “groundswell
of Black women celebrity activism” has already begun, she told VOA.</p>
<p>Harris’ run for the nation’s top job has energized African American
voters, a key Democratic constituency whose enthusiasm waned when Biden
was on top of the ticket. However, amid the rampant racist and sexist
attacks on Harris online, they are also bracing themselves.</p>
<p>“It’s critical for Black women with platforms to work together to
rise above the misogynoir that Harris will face,” Sheppard said, using a
term that combines racism and sexism to describe the oppression of Black
women.</p>
<p>Attacks are already being launched at Harris for traveling to
Indianapolis and declining to preside over Israel Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu’s speech to Congress, also happening Wednesday.</p>
<p>From Indianapolis, Harris heads to Houston, Texas, to speak in front
of the American Federation of Teachers on Friday. After landing in
Houston, Harris is scheduled to meet with local emergency response
officials for a briefing on the Hurricane Beryl recovery efforts, where
she will reiterate the administration’s commitment to delivering
resources to affected communities.</p>

<h4>

Embassies are bubbles of sovereignty that local authorities cannot
freely enter and in which certain communications are privileged – an
arrangement that is generally agreed as essential to facilitate
international relations. And now the same protections are being
suggested as needed to create a “data embassy” – datacenters that local
authorities can’t access and in which nations can store info and run

id="harris-promises-compassion-over-fear-and-hate-in-debut-campaign-rally">Harris
promises compassion over ‘fear and hate’ in debut campaign rally</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MILWAUKEE — U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris assailed Donald Trump
on Tuesday at her first campaign rally since replacing President Joe
Biden as the Democratic presidential candidate.</p>
<p>In a 17-minute speech, Harris went after Trump’s vulnerabilities,
comparing her background as a former prosecutor to his record as a
convicted felon.</p>
<p>Harris ticked through a list of liberal priorities, saying that if
elected she would act to expand abortion access, make it easier for
workers to join unions, and address gun violence, drawing a sharp
contrast with Trump, the Republican nominee for president in the
November 5 election.</p>
<p>“Donald Trump wants to take our country backward,” she told a
cheering crowd of several thousand at West Allis Central High School in
a Milwaukee suburb in Wisconsin, a battleground state with a pivotal
role in deciding the election outcome.</p>
<p>“Do we want to live in a country of freedom, compassion and rule of
law, or a country of chaos, fear and hate?”</p>
<p>The raucous rally was a notable contrast to the smaller, more subdued
events Biden held, underscoring Democrats’ hope that Harris, 59, can
revive what had been a flagging campaign under Biden, 81. The audience
danced and waved Harris signs, while chants of “Ka-ma-la!” broke out
when she took the stage.</p>
<p>She emphasized her commitment to reproductive rights, an issue that
has plagued Republicans since the U.S. Supreme Court — powered by three
Trump-appointed justices — eliminated a nationwide right to abortion in
2022.</p>
<p>Trump and his allies have tried to tether Harris to some of Biden’s
more unpopular policies, including his administration’s handling of the
surge of migrants at the southern border with Mexico.</p>
<p>In a conference call with reporters on Tuesday, Trump expressed
confidence in his ability to defeat Harris, noting that her previous
presidential run in 2020 did not even survive until the first statewide
nominating contest.</p>
<p>Trump offered to debate Harris multiple times. Trump and Biden had
one more debate scheduled on September 10 after their encounter on June
27. Biden’s poor performance that night led to Democratic calls for him
to step aside.</p>
<p>“I want to debate her, and she’ll be no different because they have
the same policies,” Trump said.</p>
<p>Harris swiftly consolidated her party’s support after Biden abandoned
his reelection campaign under pressure from members of his party who
worried about his ability to beat 78-year-old Trump, or to serve another
four-year term.</p>
<p>Harris has received pledges from enough delegates to win the
nominations, the campaign said. But nothing is certain until next
month’s Democratic National Convention, when the delegates will vote to
determine the nominee.</p>
<p>Her campaign said it had raised $100 million since Sunday.</p>
<p>Most Democratic lawmakers have lined up behind her candidacy,
including the party’s leaders in the Senate and House, Chuck Schumer and
Hakeem Jeffries, who endorsed Harris on Tuesday at a joint press
conference.</p>
<p>Harris’ rise dramatically reshapes an election in which many voters
were unhappy with their options. As the first Black woman and Asian
American to serve as vice president, she would make further history as
the first woman elected U.S. president.</p>
<p>Wisconsin is among a trio of Rust Belt states, along with Michigan
and Pennsylvania, that are critical to Democrats’ chances of defeating
Trump.</p>
<p>Alyssa Wahlborg, 19, vice chair of the Whitewater College Democrats,
said Harris had reenergized young voters, particularly women who want
Harris to break the ultimate U.S. glass ceiling.</p>
<p>“I talked to my grandmom. We are both excited that she may live to
see the first woman president,” said Wahlborg while attending Tuesday’s
rally. “It’s taken too long.”</p>
<p>Editor’s note: This story has been updated to correct the spelling
and title of Alyssa Wahlborg.</p>

id="demonstrators-protest-netanyahus-us-visit-military-aid-to-israel">Demonstrators
protest Netanyahu’s US visit, military aid to Israel</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — Protesters against the Gaza war staged a sit-in at a
U.S. congressional office building on Tuesday, ahead of Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s address to Congress. Capitol Police made
multiple arrests.</p>
<p>Netanyahu arrived in Washington on Monday for a visit that includes
meetings with President Joe Biden and a Wednesday speech before a joint
session of Congress. Dozens of protesters rallied outside his hotel
Monday evening, and on Tuesday afternoon, hundreds staged a
flashmob-style protest in the Cannon Building, which houses offices of
members of the U.Sl House of Representatives.</p>
<p>Organized by Jewish Voice for Peace, protesters — wearing red
T-shirts that read “Not In Our Name” — took over the building’s rotunda
by sitting on the floor, unfurling signs and chanting “Let Gaza
Live!”</p>
<p>After about a half-hour of clapping and chanting, officers from the
U.S. Capitol Police issued several warnings, then began arresting
protesters — binding their hands with zip ties and leading them away
one-by-one.</p>
<p>“I am the daughter of Holocaust survivors and I know what a Holocaust
looks like,” said Jane Hirschmann, a native of Saugerties, New York, who
drove down for the protest along with her two daughters — both of whom
were arrested. “When we say ‘Never again,’ we mean never for
anybody.”</p>
<p>Anger aimed at US president</p>
<p>The demonstrators focused much of their ire on the Biden
administration, demanding the president immediately cease all arms
shipments to Israel.</p>
<p>“We’re not focusing on Netanyahu. He’s just a symptom,” Hirschmann
said. “But how can (Biden) be calling for a cease-fire when he’s sending
them bombs and planes?”</p>
<p>As of 8 p.m. Tuesday, the Capitol Police said they did not have a
final tally of the number of people arrested. But JVP said in a
statement that 400 people, “including over a dozen rabbis,” had been
arrested.</p>
<p>Mitchell Rivard, chief of staff for Representative Dan Kildee of
Michigan, said in a statement that his office called for Capitol Police
intervention after the demonstrators “became disruptive, violently
beating on the office doors, shouting loudly, and attempting to force
entry into the office.”</p>
<p>Kildee later told The Associated Press that he was confused why his
office was targeted, saying he had voted against a massive supplemental
military aid package to Israel earlier this year.</p>
<p>Netanyahu’s U.S. visit has touched off a wave of protest activity,
with some demonstrations condemning Israel and others expressing support
but pressuring Netanyahu to strike a cease-fire deal and bring home the
hostages still being held by Hamas.</p>
<p>Families of some of the remaining hostages held a protest vigil
Tuesday evening on the National Mall, demanding that Netanyahu come to
terms with Hamas and bring home the approximately 120 Israeli hostages
remaining in Gaza.</p>
<p>About 150 people wearing yellow shirts that read “Seal the Deal NOW!”
chanted “Bring Them Home” and listened to testimonials from relatives
and former hostages. The demonstrators applauded when Biden’s name was
mentioned, but several criticized Netanyahu — known by his nickname
“Bibi” — on the belief that he was dragging his feet or playing hardball
on a proposed cease-fire deal that would return all of the hostages.</p>
<p>“I’m begging Bibi. There’s a deal on the table and you have to take
it,” said Aviva Siegel, 63, who spent 51 days in captivity and whose
husband, Keith, remains a hostage. “I want Bibi to look in my eyes and
tell me one thing: that Keith is coming home.”</p>
<p>Anticipating protests, security boosted</p>
<p>Multiple protests are planned for Wednesday, when Netanyahu is slated
to address Congress. In anticipation, police have boosted security
around the Capitol building and closed multiple roads for most of the
week.</p>
<p>Biden and Netanyahu are expected to meet Thursday, according to a
U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity ahead of the White
House announcement. Vice President Kamala Harris also will meet with
Netanyahu separately that day.</p>
<p>Harris, as Senate president, would normally sit behind foreign
leaders addressing Congress, but she’ll be away Wednesday on an
Indianapolis trip scheduled before Biden withdrew his reelection bid and
she became the likely Democratic presidential candidate over the
weekend.</p>
<p>Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump announced on Truth
Social that he would meet with Netanyahu on Friday.</p>

<p>date: 2024-07-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>President Joe Biden returned to the White House Tuesday after an
eventful news week that he spent entirely out of the spotlight – yet
still managed to dominate with news of his exit from the presidential
race. Meanwhile, his vice president hit the road launching her
presidential campaign. VOA’s Anita Powell reports from the White
House.</p>

<h2 id="harris-campaign-starts-search-for-running-mate">Harris’ campaign
starts search for running mate</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — Who will she pick? That’s the big political question in
America after U.S. President Joe Biden dropped his reelection bid and
endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, who has quickly collected a
critical mass of Democratic Party support and funding.</p>
<p>The selection in question is Harris’ running mate, the person who
would step into the role she will shed if the Democrats are victorious
in November’s presidential election against Republicans Donald Trump and
J.D. Vance.</p>
<p>Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and his law firm are vetting
Harris’ potential vice presidential candidates, according to media
reports.</p>
<p>The campaign has requested vetting materials from five Democratic
governors — Roy Cooper of North Carolina, Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania,
Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, Tim Walz of Minnesota and J.B. Pritzker of
Illinois — and one U.S. senator, Democrat Mark Kelly of Arizona, reports
The Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p>Those who pass the vetting “will probably have a one-on-one
conversation with Harris and then she’ll make a choice, probably in the
week or so before the convention,” William Galston, senior fellow at the
Brookings Institution, told VOA. “The danger of an accelerated process
is that you know things will be overlooked. Mistakes will be made that a
more leisurely process would have prevented. But she has no choice. She
has to do it fast and get it right.”</p>
<p>Quest to balance ticket</p>
<p>It “is most likely” that Harris, as the daughter of a Black father
and a mother who emigrated from India, will choose a white man to be her
number two, according to Joel K. Goldstein, a scholar of U.S. vice
presidents and the Vincent C. Immel professor of law emeritus at the
St. Louis University School of Law.</p>
<p>Geographical balance is another factor. Harris, who is from
California, a solidly Democratic state, likely desires someone who can
boost the party’s chance in one of the critical swing states — territory
that spans westward from Pennsylvania to Michigan, as well as the
southern state of Georgia.</p>
<p>“Someone from the Midwest or even from the South would be a good
choice,” said Jay Chen, Democratic National Committee delegate from
California and co-chair of Taiwanese Americans for Progress.</p>
<p>“Andy Beshear, he’s a governor from Kentucky. I think he would make a
good choice. We want to make sure that we’re balancing out the ticket,
because we have someone [Harris] from California,” said Chen. “I think
we do have to make sure that folks in the Midwest on the East Coast from
the South, that they don’t feel like they’re going to be ignored by this
administration and this is an excellent opportunity to try to try to
balance out the ticket.”</p>
<p>Historically, geographic balance “was perhaps the most common type of
balance that you would see on tickets,” according to Goldstein.
Nowadays, “the idea of geographic balance is not really as important a
calculation as some other things.”</p>
<p>The governors of both Pennsylvania and Michigan, who are Democrats,
endorsed Harris on Monday. That quashed any speculation that Shapiro or
Whitmer might challenge Harris for delegates ahead of the party’s
national nominating convention next month. It also appeared to
automatically place them into consideration to be the vice presidential
nominee.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania in play</p>
<p>Pennsylvania is practically a must-win for either party. The Keystone
State offers 19 electoral votes — the most of any 2024 battleground
state — of the 270 required to reach the threshold for victory in a U.S.
presidential election.</p>
<p>In an on-air conversation about Shapiro, CNN chief national
correspondent John King said the governor is a contender, but “he’s
Jewish. There could be some risks with putting him on the ticket.”</p>
<p>Commentators on social media quickly responded that Harris may be
hesitant to select Shapiro, who is a strong supporter of Israel, as he
could jeopardize her chances in Michigan, where there has been a primary
election backlash against the Biden-Harris ticket from Arab American
voters because of the president’s support for Israel’s war against
Hamas.</p>
<p>“It says a lot about the state of American politics, and perhaps
especially in progressive circles that one of the ‘cons’ of Kamala
Harris selecting” Shapiro as her vice president, is that he is Jewish
and the pushback this might receive, Arsen Ostrovsky, CEO of the
International Legal Forum, a global network of lawyers supporting
Israel, wrote on X on Sunday.</p>
<p>Harris’ husband, second gentleman Douglas Emhoff, is Jewish.</p>
<p>There has never been a Jewish president or vice president in the
United States. Democrat Al Gore in 2000 selected a Jewish U.S. senator,
Joe Lieberman, as his running mate on the ticket that lost to
Republicans George W. Bush and Dick Cheney.</p>
<p>Jews comprise less than 3% of the American population but play an
outsized role in academia, business, law, the U.S. Congress, popular
culture and, as has been the case with other minorities, traditionally
faced institutional discrimination. Antisemitism has resurged in recent
years on both the far left and far right.</p>
<p>The Illinois governor is also Jewish. Pritzker, a billionaire heir to
the Hyatt Hotels fortune, runs a state that has a large bounty of 19
electoral votes and is considered reliably blue (Democratic).</p>
<p>Pritzker denied in an MSNBC interview on Tuesday that he had received
a request for vetting materials from the Harris campaign. Asked if he is
interested in running with her, he avoided giving a direct answer.</p>
<p>“I love being the governor of the state of Illinois, and I’ve been
out on the campaign trail fighting hard for Democrats to win,” he
responded.</p>
<p>A possible first</p>
<p>The governor of Michigan (15 electoral votes) on the ticket with
Harris would present an unprecedented combination — female candidates
for both president and vice president.</p>
<p>Whitmer on Monday dampened such speculation.</p>
<p>“No, I am not planning to go anywhere,” she told a reporter from WLNS
TV on Monday, who asked Whitmer if she would be willing to accept an
offer to join Harris on the party ticket. “I am not leaving
Michigan.”</p>
<p>No other woman is known to be under consideration by the Harris
campaign.</p>
<p>The Republicans once nominated a woman as their vice presidential
candidate. Alaska Governor Sarah Palin was selected by Senator John
McCain in the 2008 election that saw Barack Obama, a Democrat, elected
as the country’s first African American president.</p>
<p>The Democrats are also the only major party to have nominated a woman
for president. Hillary Clinton, who was secretary of state and the wife
of former President Bill Clinton, won the popular vote in 2016, but
Trump captured the most electoral votes, thus becoming president.</p>
<p>North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, a Democrat, was elected in 2016
and again in 2020, despite Trump winning the state on the same ballot
both times. Cooper is term-limited and cannot seek reelection in the Tar
Hill State, which holds 16 electoral votes.</p>
<p>Cooper was asked repeatedly during a Monday appearance on MSNBC
whether he would consider the Number 2 spot if offered by Harris.</p>
<p>“I appreciate people talking about me,” he said, “But I think the
focus right now needs to be on her this week.”</p>
<p>Then there is Governor Andy Beshear of Kentucky (eight electoral
votes), whose state some decades ago turned reliably Republican red in
presidential contests. The last time a majority of Kentuckians chose a
Democrat for president was in 1996, when Bill Clinton, successfully
running for reelection, bested former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole in
the Bluegrass State.</p>
<p>Some suggest a nonpolitician</p>
<p>Senator Mark Kelly is the sole non-governor known to be under
consideration. Arizona is a Southwestern swing state with 11 electoral
votes. A former Navy combat pilot and retired astronaut, Kelly is
married to former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, who resigned in 2012 due
to severe brain injury caused by an assassination attempt.</p>
<p>There are suggestions Harris should think outside the box and choose
a nonpolitician, such as a retired general, to bolster her chances with
conservative-leaning independent voters concerned about Trump returning
as commander-in-chief.</p>
<p>Law professor Goldstein, author of two books about the evolution of
the role of the American vice presidency, does not expect that will
happen.</p>
<p>“Every first-time vice presidential pick since 1940 has been either a
current or former United States senator, governor, member of the House
of Representative or a person who held high federal executive office,”
he said. “So, it would be surprising if the choice was somebody who came
from the military.”</p>
<p>These days, Goldstein told VOA, the primary consideration for
selecting a vice presidential candidate is whether they have “the
caliber that they are plausible as president, at least in the eyes of
people who might support the ticket, or they have the stature and the
ability [that] they can take on the sort of assignments that Vice
President Harris has the last three and a half years.”</p>

<h2 id="new-samsung-phones-block-sideloading-by-default">New Samsung
phones block sideloading by default</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-23, from: OS News</p>
<p>The assault on a user’s freedom to install whatever they want on what
is supposed to be their phone continues. This time, it’s Samsung adding
an additional blocker to users installing applications from outside the
Play Store and its own mostly useless Galaxy Store. Technically, Android
already blocks sideloading by default at an operating system level. The
permission that’s needed to silently install new apps without prompting
the user, INSTALL_PACKAGES, can only be granted to preinstalled app
stores like the Google Play Store, and it’s granted automatically to
apps that request it. The permission that most third-party app stores
end up using, REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES, has to be granted explicitly by
the user. Even then, Android will prompt the user every time an app with
this permission tries to install a new app. Samsung’s Auto Blocker
feature takes things a bit further. The feature, first introduced in One
UI 6.0, fully blocks the installation of apps from unauthorized sources,
even if those sources were granted the REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES
permission. ↫ Mishaal Rahman I’m not entirely sure why Samsung felt the
need to add an additional, Samsung-specific blocking mechanism, but at
least for now, you can turn it off in the Settings application. This
means that in order to install an application from outside of the Play
Store and the Galaxy Store on brand new Samsung phones – the ones
shipping with OneUI 6.1.1 – you need to both give the regular Android
permission to do so, but also turn off this nag feature. Having two
variants of every application on your Samsung phone wasn’t enough,
apparently.</p>

id="google-wont-be-deprecating-third-party-cookies-from-chrome-after-all">Google
won’t be deprecating third-party cookies from Chrome after all</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-23, from: OS News</p>
<p>This story just never ever ends. After delays, changes in plans, more
delays, we now have more changed plans. After years of stalling, Google
has now announced it is, in fact, not going to deprecate third-party
cookies in Chrome by default. In light of this, we are proposing an
updated approach that elevates user choice. Instead of deprecating
third-party cookies, we would introduce a new experience in Chrome that
lets people make an informed choice that applies across their web
browsing, and they’d be able to adjust that choice at any time. We’re
discussing this new path with regulators, and will engage with the
industry as we roll this out. ↫ Anthony Chavez Google remains unclear
about what, exactly, users will be able to choose between. The consensus
seems to be that users will be able to choose between retaining
third-party cookies and turning them off, but that’s based on a
statement by the British Competition and Market Authority, and not on a
statement from Google itself. It seems reasonable to assume the CMA
knows what it’s talking about, but with a company like Google you never
know what’s going to happen tomorrow, let alone a few months from now.
While both Safari and Firefox have already made this move ages ago, it’s
taking Google and Chrome a lot longer to deal with this issue, because
Google needs to find different ways of tracking you that are not using
third-party cookies. Google’s own testing with Privacy Sandbox, Chrome’s
sarcastically-named alternative to third-party cookies, shows that it
seems to perform reasonable well, which should definitely raise some
alarm bells about just how private it really is. Regardless, I doubt
this saga will be over any time soon.</p>

invites Sudan’s warring parties for talks, RSF to participate</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The United States has invited the Sudanese army and the
paramilitary Rapid Support Forces for U.S.-mediated ceasefire talks
starting on Aug. 14 in Switzerland, Secretary of State Antony Blinken
said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>RSF leader Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo said early on Wednesday they will
constructively participate in the talks to achieve “a comprehensive
ceasefire across the country and facilitate humanitarian access to all
those in need.”</p>
<p>“We reaffirm our firm stance … which is the insistence on saving
lives, stopping the fighting, and paving the way for a peaceful,
negotiated political solution that restores the country to civilian rule
and the path of democratic transition,” Dagalo said in a statement.</p>
<p>The talks will include the African Union, Egypt, the United Arab
Emirates and the United Nations as observers, Blinken said in a
statement. Saudi Arabia will be a co-host for the discussions, he
added.</p>
<p>“The scale of death, suffering, and destruction in Sudan is
devastating. This senseless conflict must end,” Blinken said, calling on
the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and Rapid Support Forces (RSF) to attend
the talks and approach them constructively.</p>
<p>The war in Sudan, which erupted in April 2023, has forced almost 10
million people from their homes, sparked warnings of famine and waves of
ethnically driven violence blamed largely on the RSF.</p>
<p>Talks in Jeddah between the army and RSF that were sponsored by the
United States and Saudi Arabia broke down at the end of last year.</p>
<p>State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters on
Tuesday that the goal of the talks in Switzerland was to build on work
from Jeddah and try to move the talks to the next phase.</p>
<p>“We just want to get the parties back to the table, and what we
determined is that bringing the parties, the three host nations and the
observers together is the best shot that we have right now at getting
the nationwide cessation of violence,” Miller said.</p>

Austin to reinforce ties with Asian allies amid domestic political
uncertainty</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>state department — U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration said it
remains “intensely focused on” its foreign policy agenda in the final
six months of his term, despite the challenges often faced by so-called
lame-duck leaders.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters at the
State Department that the United States will continue the work,
“particularly trying to bring peace to the Middle East, ending the war
in Gaza,” dealing effectively with the ongoing aggression by Russia
against Ukraine, and maintaining engagement in the Indo-Pacific
region.</p>
<p>This week, Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin head to Asia to
reassure allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific of the U.S. commitment,
as the U.S. presidential election in November casts uncertainty over
Washington’s foreign policy.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Biden announced he will not run for reelection and
endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as his successor. Earlier this
month, the Republican nominee, former President Donald Trump, survived
an assassination attempt.</p>
<p>By late Monday, most Democratic delegates pledged their support for
Harris, making her the likely nominee.</p>
<p>Blinken endorsed Harris on Tuesday.</p>
<p>“What I’ve observed is someone who asks, time and again, the
penetrating questions, who cuts to the chase and is intensely focused on
the interests of the American people and making sure that our foreign
policy is doing everything it can to advance those interests,” he
said.</p>
<p>2+2 security talks</p>
<p>Blinken and Austin will hold the so-called 2+2 security talks with
U.S. allies Japan and the Philippines.</p>
<p>The U.S.-Japan Foreign and Defense Ministerial Dialogues will discuss
“extended deterrence” for the first time amid growing, unprecedented
threats in the region, according to U.S. officials. The term refers to
the U.S. commitment to use its nuclear and conventional forces to deter
attacks on its allies.</p>
<p>The first U.S.-Philippines 2+2 meeting to be held in Manila follows a
crucial deal reached between China and the Philippines on Sunday, amid
recent collisions near the waters around Second Thomas Shoal, known as
Rén’ài Jiao in China.</p>
<p>The agreement aims to establish a mutually acceptable arrangement at
the shoal without conceding either side’s territorial claims.</p>
<p>“As the Philippines’ ally, we do support the diplomacy that they’ve
chosen to conduct. We welcome the announcement of this outcome,” Daniel
Kritenbrink told VOA during a phone briefing on Monday. Kritenbrink is
the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs.</p>
<p>After returning to the United States, the top U.S. diplomat and the
defense chief will host their Australian counterparts in Annapolis,
Maryland, for the 2024 Australia-U.S. Ministerial Consultations, or
AUSMIN, on August 6, according to the Pentagon.</p>
<p>Vietnam</p>
<p>Blinken’s 10-day trip to Asia will start in Hanoi, where he will
attend the funeral of General Secretary Nguyễn Phú Trọng, head of
Vietnam’s ruling Communist Party, who died last Friday. In 2023, the
U.S. and Vietnam elevated their bilateral ties to a comprehensive
strategic partnership.</p>
<p>The United States, China, and Russia are among the countries that
maintain top-tier relations with Vietnam.</p>
<p>ASEAN in Laos</p>
<p>Blinken will then attend meetings of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations, or ASEAN, in Vientiane, Laos, where he will hold
face-to-face talks with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.</p>
<p>State Department officials said they do not anticipate Blinken
meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov or North Korean
officials on the sidelines of ASEAN-related regional talks.</p>
<p>Japan</p>
<p>In Tokyo, in addition to the 2+2 security talks, Blinken will join
his Australian, Indian and Japanese counterparts for a Quad foreign
ministers’ meeting to reaffirm their collective commitment to regional
stability. The Quad is a security dialogue involving the four
countries.</p>
<p>The United States and Japan will demonstrate responsibly how they
will ensure not just the defense of Japan but also their contribution to
regional security, according to Kritenbrink.</p>
<p>In April, Tokyo and Washington announced a series of initiatives to
strengthen their military ties, which the Biden administration described
as the most significant upgrade since the U.S.-Japan alliance began in
1951.</p>
<p>The Philippines</p>
<p>In Manila, Blinken and Austin will meet with Philippine President
Ferdinand Marcos Jr.</p>
<p>They will discuss ways to deepen coordination on shared challenges,
including in the South China Sea, and advance our bilateral economic
agenda, according to the State Department.</p>
<p>Singapore</p>
<p>In Singapore, Blinken will meet with Prime Minister Lawrence Wong and
the city-state’s new leadership to discuss the U.S.-Singapore strategic
partnership. U.S. officials said the focus on critical and emerging
technologies highlights the partnership’s role in promoting a free,
open, connected, and resilient Indo-Pacific region.</p>
<p>Mongolia</p>
<p>Tuesday, Blinken held talks with Mongolian Foreign Minister
Battsetseg Batmunkh at the State Department.</p>
<p>The inaugural U.S.-Mongolia Comprehensive Strategic Dialogue
highlighted the growing ties between the two countries, as evidenced by
ongoing initiatives to strengthen people-to-people connections through
professional and educational exchanges, English-language programs and
the establishment of direct flights.</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
Vineyard Wind’s turbine blade failure couldn’t have come at a worse time
for offshore wind.
</p>
<p>
The industry is still dealing with the high inflation and supply chain
issues that
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/offshore-wind-power-cost-expensive" target="_self"><u>turned
2023 into a parade of horribles</u></a>. Now opponents to American
offshore wind — most prominently
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/what-trump-could-do-to-offshore-wind" target="_self"><u>former
president Donald Trump</u></a> — are one election away from storming the
gates of the federal bureaucracy. We don’t know yet whether the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/vineyard-wind-broken-turbine-blade" target="_self"><u>Vineyard
Wind blade breakage</u></a> was a fluke or the result of a problem with
the blades themselves, but that hasn’t stopped critics of offshore wind
from shouting about it — and with fiberglass still washing up on
Nantucket beaches, they’re tough to ignore.
</p>
<p>
Major errors like blade failures are incredibly rare, but — like the
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-13/wind-farm-impacts-on-whale-habitat-is-still-a-mystery-scientists-say" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>risk
of whale injuries</u></a> — are precisely the sort of negative
externality activists have had a tendency of magnifying when fighting
offshore wind. Should Trump win in November and retake the White House,
he could indefinitely stall projects in the nascent sector across both
coasts, as operations often fall under the scope of federal control.
</p>
<p>
“If Donald Trump is elected, he has said on Day 1 he would terminate
offshore approvals. He has said he will do that, and frankly he
generally keeps his word,” Bruce Afrin, an attorney representing
activists challenging projects off the New Jersey coastline, told me.
And while he sees Vineyard Wind becoming a focal point of that effort,
he also told me, “I’m sure they’re going to take a broader approach.”
</p>
<p>
Nearly all offshore wind projects have to face at least some form of
federal review. Projects at commercial scale will
<a href="https://www.policyarchive.org/handle/10207/2438" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>usually
be in federal waters</u></a> — more than 3 miles from a state’s
coastline — because the best wind is further from shore; in addition,
permits may be required on endangered species and water regulations to
build turbines or construct cabling.
</p>
<p>
Very few existing offshore wind projects have been fully permitted and
reached the construction phase. There’s
<a href="https://www.providencejournal.com/story/news/environment/2024/05/15/revolution-wind-project-off-ri-coast-hits-major-milestone/73679920007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Revolution</u></a>,
<a href="https://www.newsday.com/long-island/sunrise-wind-orsted-suffolk-county-fza9cyw1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Sunrise</u></a>,

Virginia</u></a>, and, of course, Vineyard Wind, which is now in a
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/blade-break-prompts-suspension-of-vineyard-wind-production-construction-2/#:~:text=The%20Bureau%20of%20Safety%20and,the%20brief%20closure%20of%20beaches." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>work
stoppage</u></a> following the blade failure. Many other projects are
still in the permitting process, per K&amp;L Gates attorney Theodore
Paradise, who advises project developers in the sector. Paradise told me
data on how many projects are in the federal regulatory pipeline is
scattered across various federal sources, making it “kind of an IKEA
situation.”
</p>
<p>
Given how few projects have received all of their permits to date, this
is a worrisome hypothetical to climate advocates and professionals
working in offshore wind.
</p>
<p>
“Any project going through any of those gauntlets may be dead on
arrival,” attorney Jeff Thaler, who consults on offshore and onshore
wind projects, told me. “That’s the uncertainty and concern, and
investors do not like uncertainty like that.”
</p>
<h3>
Nothing is certain
</h3>
<p>
Both Thaler and Paradise said regulators already take the risk of blade
failures and a multitude of other potential project risks seriously.
(This is why, for example, there are boat speed restrictions near
offshore wind projects.) Not to mention that wind turbines are not a new
technology and have been operating in much larger numbers offshore in
Europe and China without much incident.
</p>
<p>
Those few projects in construction still face legal challenges. Coastal
Virginia, for example, was allowed to continue construction
<a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2024-05-28/federal-judge-rejects-request-to-halt-dominions-virginia-beach-offshore-wind-farm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>despite
a lawsuit</u></a> from conservative legal groups over the risks posed to
endangered whales. If re-elected, Trump and his Justice Department would
have the opportunity to stop defending the government’s approvals of the
project and side with the legal challengers.
</p>
<p>
Whether it would be possible for Trump to undo previously issued
approvals is a thornier question. Afrin argued that a Trump
administration both could and would re-examine previous approvals
related to offshore wind projects, under the justification that the
government erroneously issued them or failed to properly conduct a
specific analysis. Existing environmental laws like the National
Environmental Policy Act, Afrin said, give “enormous tools” to “those
who organize and have standing” in litigation.
</p>
<p>
Paradise made an audible sigh when I asked whether a future Trump
administration could feasibly go that far.
</p>
<p>
“Some folks you’ll talk to might say, <em><em>oh [they have] approved
it, we’re all set</em></em>,” he said. “If the administration were to
change, you can imagine a scenario where somebody sues on an issued
permit and the Justice Department decides not to defend the agency
action, or maybe they want to settle with the folks bringing the suit.”
</p>
<p>
Some permits may be impossible to undo because project developers have a
vested right in a regulatory approval depending on how far along they
are, Thaler said. But if construction has yet to begin and more permits
are needed, a Trump administration could potentially have an opening.
</p>
<p>
The risk lies in what happens to public perception and political
maneuvering. Thaler compared what’s happening with Vineyard Wind to the
PR backlash against Boeing after a door came out of a plane in the
middle of a flight. “Any time this gets attention it will have an
impact. People will be raising more concerns. Those who have been
opposing will be emboldened, or energized, no pun intended.” That said,
after the door debacle, “People kept flying,” Thaler said. “There was a
suspension of that particular jet type for a while, but then people
resumed flying around the world.”
</p>
<h3>
Hope against a future
</h3>
<p>
Scrutinizing offshore wind tech is already on the table to some in the
Trumpworld braintrust. Oliver McPherson-Smith, head of energy and
environment issues for the America First Policy Institute, told
<a href="https://www.axios.com/pro/energy-policy/newsletters/2023/10/30/energy-2025-ira-buzzsaw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>Axios</em></em></u><u>
last year</u></a> that he wants regulators in a future administration to
look “very, very closely at the environmental effects of all new
technologies, including offshore wind.” Advocates fighting offshore wind
certainly feel emboldened by the Vineyard Wind blade failure and are
looking to magnify the importance of its environmental impacts. Mandy
Gunasekara — the author of
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-climate-change-project-2025" target="_blank">Project
2025</a>’s section on dismantling the Environmental Protection Agency —
on Monday retweeted claims that the failure was a “disaster” that
environmentalists were “downplaying.”
</p>
<p>
Later this week, representatives from Vineyard Wind will appear in court
to defend against a lawsuit from the conservative Texas Public Policy
Foundation, seeking to stop the project on behalf of people in the
commercial fishing industry. The group cited the blade failure in a
press release about the case: “The federal government is required to
ensure safety and environmental protection by law when approving
projects like this — and they knew this project had environmental risks
like the one that came to pass here — but they let it happen anyway.”
</p>
<p>
Some offshore wind industry backers are optimistic about the ability for
the industry to weather the storm of a future Trump administration,
however. Sam Salustro, vice president of strategic communication for
Oceantic, formerly known as the Business Network for Offshore Wind, told
me that he thinks it’s not a done deal Trump puts the breaks on offshore
wind permits given the “enormous amount of investment and job creation
that is happening from this dependable pipeline of projects coming
through.”
</p>
<p>
He also pointed to examples of Republican support from folks like
Virginia
Gov. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWDrZb0Dr4o" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Glenn
Youngkin</u></a> and House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, who
<a href="https://us.orsted.com/news-archive/2024/05/orsted-and-shipbuilder-edison-chouest-christen-american-built-offshore-wind-service-operations-vessel" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>recently
attended</u></a> the christening of a new port in his state of Louisiana
that will serve the offshore wind industry. “This is an industry that
has robust bipartisan support from the people who know it best,” he
said.
</p>
<p>
When asked specifically about how the Vineyard Wind blade failure would
impact the future of U.S. industry growth, Salustro told me he didn’t
immediately know how to respond. Ultimately, he settled on a brighter
outlook. “We still have three other projects that are continuing
development. This is a safety issue that is going to be addressed. From
global data, we understand how rare it is, so I don’t see it as a huge
hiccup to the industry like inflation was. Probably limited impact.”
</p>
<p>
Dave Rogers of Sierra Club, meanwhile, acknowledged that while the
Vineyard Wind situation is “not great,” there is “a long track record we
can point to” on project efficacy and environmental safety. While its
critical regulators and companies figure out what went awry here, “it’s
critical that it doesn’t actually slow down the deployment of offshore
wind.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s not necessarily our job to get out ahead of [this],” Rogers said,
“but we do think it’s important this is contextualized on a global scale
so that people understand how rare something like this is and that
offshore wind is going to be a key part of a decarbonization strategy in
the U.S.”

Senator Bob Menendez resigning following corruption conviction</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>TRENTON, New Jersey — U.S. Senator Bob Menendez is resigning from
office August 20 following his conviction for taking bribes for corrupt
acts including acting as an agent of the Egyptian government, a person
familiar with the matter told The Associated Press on Tuesday. </p>
<p>Menendez had insisted after the July 16 verdict that he was innocent
and promised to appeal. The person who told the AP about Menendez’s
resignation did so on the condition of anonymity because the New Jersey
Democrat’s decision hadn’t been made public. Menendez’s attorney hasn’t
returned messages seeking comment. </p>
<p>The resignation gives New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy, a Democrat,
the ability to appoint someone to the senate for the remainder of
Menendez’s term, which expires on January 3. The seat was already up for
election on November 5. Democrats have nominated U.S. Representative
Andy Kim, who’s in a strong position in the Democratic-leaning state. He
faces Republican Curtis Bashaw. </p>
<p>Menendez, 70, was convicted of charges that he sold the power of his
office to three New Jersey businessmen who sought a variety of favors.
Prosecutors said Menendez used his influence to meddle in three
different state and federal criminal investigations to protect his
associates. They said he helped one bribe-paying friend get a
multimillion-dollar deal with a Qatari investment fund and another keep
a contract to provide religious certification for meat bound for
Egypt. </p>
<p>He was also convicted of taking actions that benefited Egypt’s
government in exchange for bribes, including providing details on
personnel at the U.S. embassy in Cairo, and ghostwriting a letter to
fellow senators regarding lifting a hold on military aid to Egypt. FBI
agents found stacks of gold bars and $480,000 in cash hidden in
Menendez’s house. </p>
<p>After his conviction, Menendez denied all of those allegations,
saying “I have never been anything but a patriot of my country and for
my country. I have never, ever been a foreign agent.” </p>
<p>But numerous fellow Democrats had urged him to resign, including
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. Murphy had urged the Senate to
expel Menendez if he didn’t quit. Only 15 senators have ever been
expelled. Senator William Blount, of Tennessee, was ousted in 1797 for
treason. The other 14 were expelled in 1861 and 1862 for supporting
Confederates during the Civil War. </p>
<p>Menendez faces the possibility of decades in prison. A judge
scheduled his sentencing on October 29, a week before the election. </p>
<p>His resignation bookends a career spent in politics that started with
him getting elected to his local school board just a couple of years
after high school graduation. He has held office at every level in his
home state and had vowed to run as an independent in November for a
fourth term. </p>
<p>The son of Cuban immigrants and an attorney by training, Menendez was
a Union City, New Jersey, school board member at age 20 — before
graduating from law school — and later became the mayor of the city,
where he still has deep connections. </p>
<p>His own biography says he wanted to fight corruption early in his
political career, testifying against Union City officials and building a
reputation as tough. From there, he was elected to the state Assembly,
then the state Senate before heading to the U.S. House. </p>
<p>He was appointed to be a U.S. senator in 2006 when the seat opened up
after incumbent Jon Corzine became governor. He was elected outright in
2006 and again in 2012 and 2018. He served as chair of the influential
Senate Foreign Relations Committee beginning in 2013. </p>
<p>Menendez’s political career looked like it might be over in 2015,
when he was indicted in New Jersey on charges that he had accepted
bribes of luxury overseas vacations, private jet travel and campaign
contributions from a wealthy Florida eye doctor, Salomon Melgen. </p>
<p>In return, prosecutors said Menendez pressured government officials
on Melgen’s behalf over an $8.9 million Medicare billing dispute and a
stalled contract to provide port screening equipment in the Dominican
Republic. They said he also helped obtain U.S. visas for the doctor’s
girlfriends. </p>
<p>The defense argued that the gifts were not bribes but tokens of
friendship between two men who were “like brothers.” </p>
<p>A jury couldn’t reach a unanimous verdict, resulting in a mistrial in
2017. U.S. prosecutors didn’t seek a retrial. </p>
<p>New Jersey voters then returned Menendez to the Senate for another
term. Melgen was convicted in a separate fraud trial, but his 17-year

Musk says ‘woke mind virus’ ‘killed’ estranged trans daughter</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-23, from: Ben Werdmuller’s blog</p>

[<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2024/07/22/elon-musk-jordan-peterson-interview/74506785007/">Anthony
Robledo at USA Today</a>]
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“Tesla CEO Elon Musk said his estranged transgender daughter was”killed”
by the “woke mind virus” after he was tricked into agreeing to
gender-affirming care procedures.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The thing is, his daughter Vivian is perfectly happy with the decision.
The thing that’s causing Musk pain is not her decision to transition;
it’s that she’s cut him off and no longer speaks to him. Interviews like
this illustrate why.
</p>
<p>
That so many of his decisions are governed by this absolute loser energy
says a lot. Just calm down, call your daughter, and reconcile.
</p>
<p>
As USA Today points out:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“Gender-affirming care is a valid, science-backed method of medicine
that saves lives for people who require care while navigating their
gender identity. Gender-affirming care can range from talk or hormone
therapy to surgical intervention.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It’s not done flippantly; a huge amount of care and attention is
undertaken, particularly for minors. This backlash is pure conservative
hokum: it does not have any scientific or factual basis. It just makes
some small-minded, old-fashioned people feel uncomfortable.

I was playing around with CSS aspect-ratio now that it has solid
evergreen support, and wanted to see if I could apply it to Picture tags
(which I use for responsive imagery) in a smart, concise way. I wanted
to accomplish a few goals:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
No content shift on load
</li>
<li>
Display some sort of placeholder while images load
</li>
<li>
Ensure aspect-ratio is respected, especially when inside flexbox rows
and columns
</li>
<li>
(for funsies) styling the alt text on the placeholder when an image
fails to load for a pretty fallback
</li>
</ol>
<p>
I found several little tips and tricks around the web, but ultimately
the secret sauce was flex-basis and flex-grow settings.

<h2 id="the-vineyard-wind-turbine-fiasco-explained">The Vineyard Wind
Turbine Fiasco, Explained</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-23, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81Mjk2MDk2OS9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1NzIxNTUyM30.g1jkbA2OnOw-GRHQFzMvVYlILayFFcjNYG3dgaMIGsc/image.png?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C1"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
It’s been just over a week since one of the 350-foot-long blades of a
wind turbine off the Massachusetts coast unexpectedly broke off, sending
hunks of fiberglass and foam into the waters below. As of
<a href="https://nantucket-ma.gov/3176/Week-2-July-22---28" target="_blank">Wednesday
morning</a>, cleanup crews were still actively removing debris from the
water and beaches and working to locate additional pieces of the
blade.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The blade failure quickly became a crisis for residents of Nantucket,
where debris soon began washing up on the island’s busy beaches. It is
also a PR nightmare for the nascent U.S. offshore wind industry, which
is already on the defensive against community opposition and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-wind-solar-fact-check" target="_self"><u>rampant
misinformation</u></a> about its environmental risks and benefits.
</p>
<p>
The broken turbine is part of Vineyard Wind 1, which is being developed
by Avangrid and Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners. The project was
still under construction when the breakage occurred, but it was already
the largest operating offshore wind farm in the US, with
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-23/ge-vernova-now-must-explain-broken-wind-turbine-to-investors" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ten
turbines sending power to the New England Grid</u></a> as of June. The
plan is to bring another 52 online, which will produce enough
electricity to power more than 400,000 homes. Now both installation and
power generation have been paused while federal investigators look into
the incident.
</p>
<p>
There’s still a lot we don’t know about why this happened, what the
health and safety risks are, and what it means for this promising clean
energy solution going forward. But here’s everything we’ve learned so
far.
</p>
<h3>
What happened?
</h3>
<br/><img alt="Vineyard Wind 1 Map" class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="8be345bb9d109a0720695856e86b94af" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="74b92" loading="lazy" src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81Mjk2MTA4OC9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1MjAyNTQyOH0.fTRPiZKfLb1PGPP8MACChxKJQyR5TGfP_YId2XR6z54/image.png?width=980"/>
<p>
On the evening of Saturday, July 13, Vineyard Wind received an alert
that there was a problem with one of its turbines. The equipment
contains a “delicate sensoring system,” CEO Klaus Moeller told the
Nantucket Select Board
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/ke5wpB_tEZQ" target="_blank"><u>during
a public meeting</u></a> last week. Though he did not describe what the
alert said, he added that “one of the blades was broken and folded
over.” Later at the meeting, a spokesperson for GE Vernova, which
manufactured and installed the turbines, said that “blade vibrations”
had been detected. About
<a href="https://blog.response.restoration.noaa.gov/orr-modeling-tracks-path-broken-offshore-wind-turbine?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAAR2EhrIQeXA8ivjSC60Q6HNFwKk-kaYXicqt262ry1lD4OuOcou4CnaTj9E_aem_Ig64NYcUDRSBNHaCYl7UOw" target="_blank"><u>a
third of the blade</u></a>, or roughly 120 feet, fell into the water.
</p>
<p>
Two days later, Vineyard Wind contacted the town manager in Nantucket to
explain that modeling showed the potential for debris from the blade to
travel toward the island. Sure enough, fiberglass shards and other
scraps began washing up on shore the next day, and all beaches on the
island’s south shore were quickly closed to the public.
</p>
<p>
On
<a href="https://www.vineyardwind.com/press-releases/2024/7/17/vineyard-wind-update-on-damged-ge-vernova-blade" target="_blank"><u>Thursday
morning</u></a>, another large portion of the damaged blade detached and
fell into the ocean. Monitoring and recovery crews continued to find
debris throughout the area over the weekend. The beaches have since
reopened, but visitors have been advised to wear shoes and leave their
pets at home as cleanup continues.
</p>
<h3>
Why did the blade break?
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
During GE’s second quarter earnings call on July 24, GE Vernova CEO
Scott Strazik and Vice President of Investor Relations Michael Lapides
said the company had identified a “material deviation” as
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/vineyard-wind-answers" target="_blank">the
cause of the accident</a>, and that the company is continuing to work on
a “root cause analysis” to get to the bottom of how said deviation
happened in the first place.<strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
The turbine was one of GE’s Haliade-X 13-megawatt turbines, which are
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-24/ge-vernova-identified-manufacturing-deviation-at-blade-factory?srnd=homepage-americas" target="_blank"><u>manufactured
in Gaspé, Canada</u></a>, and it was still undergoing post-installation
testing by GE when the failure occurred — that is, it was not among
those sending power to the New England grid. This was actually the
second issue the company has had at this particular turbine site. One of
the original blades destined for the site was damaged during the
installation process, and the one that broke last week was a
replacement, Craig Gilvard, Vineyard Wind’s communications director,
<a href="https://newbedfordlight.org/turbine-blade-broke-during-testing-phase-vineyard-wind-says/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>told
the </u><u><em><em>New Bedford Light</em></em></u></a>.
</p>
<h3>
How did Vineyard Wind respond?
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
By Vineyard Wind’s account at the meeting last week, the accident
triggered an automatic shut down of the system and activated the
company’s emergency response plan, which
<a href="https://nantucketcurrent.com/news/why-did-vineyard-wind-wait-two-days-to-alert-the-town-about-its-damaged-turbine" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>included</u></a>
immediately notifying the U.S. Coast Guard, the federal Bureau of Safety
and Environmental Enforcement, and regional emergency response
committees.
</p>
<p>
Moeller, the CEO, said during the meeting that the company worked with
the Coast Guard to immediately establish a 500 meter “safety zone”
around the turbine and to send out notices to mariners. According to the
Coast Guard’s
<a href="https://www.navcen.uscg.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/lnms/LNM01292024.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>notice
log</u></a>, however, the safety zone went into effect three days later.
In response to my questions, the Coast Guard confirmed that the zone was
established around 8pm that night and announced to mariners over radio
broadcast.
</p>
<p>
Two days after the turbine broke, on Monday, Vineyard Wind contacted the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for aid in modeling
where the turbine debris would travel in the water. The agency
<a href="https://blog.response.restoration.noaa.gov/orr-modeling-tracks-path-broken-offshore-wind-turbine?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAAR2EhrIQeXA8ivjSC60Q6HNFwKk-kaYXicqt262ry1lD4OuOcou4CnaTj9E_aem_Ig64NYcUDRSBNHaCYl7UOw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>estimated</u></a>
pieces would likely make landfall in Nantucket that day. Vineyard Wind
<a href="https://www.vineyardwind.com/press-releases/2024/7/15/vineyard-wind-statement-on-offshore-incident" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>put
out a press release</u></a> about the accident and subsequently
contacted the Nantucket town manager. At the Nantucket Select Board
meeting last week, Moeller said the company followed regulatory
protocols but that there was “really no excuse” for how long it took to
inform the public, and said, “we want to move much quicker and make sure
that we learn from this.”

<p>
The Interior Department’s Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement
has
<a href="https://www.bsee.gov/newsroom/latest-news/statements-and-releases/press-releases/bsee-statement-on-vineyard-wind" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ordered</u></a>
the company to cease all power production and installation activities
until it can determine whether this was an isolated incident or affects
other turbines.
</p>
<p>
By Tuesday, Vineyard Wind said it had deployed two small teams to
Nantucket in addition to hiring a local contractor to remove debris on
the island. The company later
<a href="https://www.vineyardwind.com/press-releases/2024/7/20/vineyard-wind-significant-progress#:~:text=Deployment%20of%20Teams%3A%20Vineyard%20Wind,in%20other%20communities%20on%20standby." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>said</u></a>
it would “increase its local team to more than 50 employees and
contractors dedicated to beach clean-up and debris recovery efforts.”
</p>
<p>
GE Vernova is responsible for recovering offshore debris and has not
published any public statements about the effort. In response to a list
of questions, a GE Vernova spokesperson said, “We continue to work
around the clock to enhance mitigation efforts in collaboration with
Vineyard Wind and all relevant state, local and federal authorities. We
are working with urgency to complete our root cause analysis of this
event.”
</p>
<h3>
Did anyone get hurt?
</h3>
<br>
<p>
There have been no reported injuries as a result of the accident.
</p>
<h3>
What are the risks now?
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
Vineyard Wind and GE Vernova have stressed that the debris are “not
toxic.” At the Select Board meeting, GE’s executive fleet engineering
director Renjith Viripullan said that the blade is made of fiberglass,
foam, and balsa wood. It is bonded together using a “bond paste,” he
said, and likened the blade construction to that of a boat. “That’s the
correlation we need to think about,” he said.
</p>
<p>
One of the board members asked if there was any risk of PFAS
contamination as a result of the accident. Viripullan said he would need
to “take that question back” and follow up with the answer later. (This
was one of the questions I asked GE, but the company did not respond to
it.)
</p>
<p>
That being said, the debris poses some dangers. Photos of cleanup crews
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=836199678611690&set=pcb.836199735278351" target="_blank"><u>posted
to the Harbormaster’s Facebook page</u></a> show workers wearing white
hazmat suits. Vineyard Wind said “members of the public should avoid
handling debris as the fiber-glass pieces can be sharp and lead to cuts
if handled without proper gloves.”
</p>
<p>
Though members of the public raised concerns at the meeting and to the
press that fiberglass fragments in the ocean threaten marine life and
public health, it is not yet clear how serious the risks are, and
several efforts are underway to further assess them. Vineyard Wind is
developing a water quality testing plan for the island and setting up a
process for people to file claims.<em><strong> </strong></em>GE hired a
design and engineering firm to conduct an environmental assessment,
which it will present at a Nantucket Select Board meeting later this
week. The Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection has
requested information from the companies about the makeup of the debris
to evaluate risks, and the Department of Fish and Game is monitoring for
impacts to the local ecosystem.
</p>
<h3>
How is the cleanup going?
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
As of
<a href="https://www.vineyardwind.com/press-releases/2024/7/17/vineyard-wind-continues-recovery-efforts" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>last
Wednesday morning</u></a>, Vineyard Wind had collected “approximately 17
cubic yards of debris, enough to fill more than six truckloads, and
several larger pieces that washed ashore.” It is not yet known what
fraction of the turbine that fell off has been recovered. Vineyard Wind
did not respond to a request for the latest numbers in time for
publication, but I’ll update this piece if I get a response.
</p>
<h3>
Has anything like this happened before?
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
Yes. In May, a blade on the same model of turbine, the GE Haliade-X,
<a href="https://doggerbank.com/project-news/incident-at-dogger-bank-wind-farm/" target="_blank"><u>sustained
damage</u></a> at a wind farm being installed off the coast of England
called Dogger Bank. At the Nantucket Select Board meeting, a
spokesperson for GE said the Dogger Bank incident was “an installation
issue specific to the installation of that blade” and that “we don’t
think there’s a connection between that installation issue and what we
saw here.” Executives emphasized this point during the earnings call and
chalked up the Dogger Bank incident to “an installation error out at
sea.”
</p>
<p>
Several blades have also broken off another GE turbine model dubbed the
Cypress at wind farms in Germany and Sweden. After the most recent
incident in Germany last October, the company used similar language,
telling reporters that it was working to “determine the root cause.”
</p>
<p>
A “company source with knowledge of the investigations” into the various
incidents recently
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/20/climate/nantucket-wind-turbine-ge-vernova/index.html" target="_blank"><u>told
CNN</u></a> that “there were different root causes for the damage,
including transportation, handling, and manufacturing deviations.”

Vernova’s stock price fell</u></a> nearly 10% last Wednesday.
</p>
<h3>
How did locals react?
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
The backlash was swift. Nantucket residents immediately
<a href="https://www.nantucket-ma.gov/AgendaCenter/ViewFile/Agenda/_07172024-14067" target="_blank"><u>wrote
to Nantucket’s Select Board</u></a> to ask the town to stop the
construction of any additional offshore wind turbines. “I know it’s not
oil, but it’s sharp and maybe toxic in other ways,” Select Board member
Dawn Holgate told company executives at the meeting last week. “We’re
also facing an exponential risk if this were to continue because many
more windmills are planned to be built out there and there’s been a lot
of concern about that throughout the community.”
</p>
<p>
The Select Board plans to
<a href="https://www.nantucket-ma.gov/AgendaCenter/ViewFile/Agenda/_07232024-14088" target="_blank"><u>meet
in private on Tuesday night</u></a> to discuss “potential litigation by
the town against Vineyard Wind relative to recovery costs.”
</p>
<p>
“We expect Vineyard Wind will be responsible for all costs and
associated remediation efforts incurred by the town in response to the
incident,” Elizabeth Gibson, the Nantucket town manager said during the
meeting last week.
</p>
<p>
The Aquinnah Wampanoag tribe is

calling for a moratorium</u></a> on offshore wind development and raised
concerns about the presence of fiberglass fragments in the water.
</p>
<p>
On social media, anti-wind groups throughout the northeast took up the
story as
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/p/5uGdtjYoqUbAzDVH/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>evidence

<a href="https://franklinobserver.town.news/g/franklin-town-ma/n/267370/wind-turbine-failure-jazzed-climate-bill-opposition" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>cited

<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ruined-negligence-dave-portnoy-blasts-nantucket-wind-farm-after-broken-blade-shuts-down-beaches" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>sought
comment</u></a> from internet personality and founder of <em>Barstool
Sports</em> David Portnoy, who owns a home on Nantucket and said the
island had been “ruined by negligence.” The Texas Public Policy
Foundation, a

funded by oil companies and which is backing a lawsuit against Vineyard

<a href="https://www.texaspolicy.com/press/media-advisory-first-circuit-court-of-appeals-to-hear-case-on-vineyard-wind-project" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>cited
the incident</u></a> as evidence that the project is harming local
fishermen. The First Circuit Court of Appeals is set to hear oral
arguments on the case this Thursday.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, environmental groups supportive of offshore wind tried to do
damage control for the industry. “Now we must all work to ensure that
the failure of a single turbine blade does not adversely impact the
emergence of offshore wind as a critical solution for reducing
dependence on fossil fuels and addressing the climate crisis,” the
Sierra Club’s senior advisor for offshore wind, Nancy Pyne,
<a href="https://www.sierraclub.org/press-releases/2024/07/sierra-club-statement-vineyard-wind-blade-incident" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>wrote

generation.”

id="as-harris-eyes-us-presidency-reaction-in-her-mothers-native-india-is-muted-but-tinged-with-pride">As
Harris eyes US presidency, reaction in her mother’s native India is
muted but tinged with pride</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New Delhi — When Kamala Harris was sworn in as vice president in the
U.S., residents in her maternal family’s ancestral village in southern
India watched in real time, setting off fireworks, holding up portraits
of her and wishing her a long life.</p>
<p>But, four years later, as she works to become the Democratic nominee
for president after President Joe Biden ended his campaign, reaction
across the country has been more muted. While some residents in the
capital, New Delhi, expressed pride when asked about her this week, a
handful wondered who she was.</p>
<p>At least partially, that could reflect how Harris — who is also
Black, with a father born in Jamaica — has treated her origins.</p>
<p>“Harris doesn’t wear her Indian roots on her sleeve, choosing instead
to emphasize her Jamaican heritage,” Michael Kugelman, director of the
South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center, said.</p>
<p>As vice president, she has deployed stories of her ties to India at
key moments — at times light-heartedly — but her policy portfolio has
been more domestic and did not focus on relations with India, he
said.</p>
<p>In June last year, when Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a
state visit to Washington, Harris spoke emotionally about her ties to
her late mother Shyamala Gopalan’s country of birth. She credited her
grandfather P.V. Gopalan, who was a civil servant, with teaching her
about what democracy means as they walked hand-in-hand on a beach in his
home state of Tamil Nadu.</p>
<p>These lessons, she said, “first inspired my interest in public
service … and have guided me ever since.”</p>
<p>She also talked about her mother’s influence — and how she discovered
her “love of good idli,” eliciting laughter from the crowd with her
reference to a dish of steamed rice dumplings, a staple in southern
India.</p>
<p>Sumanth Raman, a political commentator in Tamil Nadu, said there was
excitement when she was named the VP nominee, “but after that, there’s
not been a great deal of enthusiasm.”</p>
<p>Since Sunday, when Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed Harris,
she has hardly featured in media reports in the state, he said.</p>
<p>“The coverage has been more about Joe Biden dropping out, that’s what
has grabbed headlines here,” Raman said.</p>
<p>Beyond a smattering of references, analysts say Harris hasn’t tapped
her Indian identity heavily.</p>
<p>Today, few members of her extended family remain in India. Other than
the trips during her childhood, Harris hasn’t visited the country much —
and not since she became vice president, another reason that could
explain why her candidacy hasn’t resonated widely in the country
yet.</p>
<p>Still, if Harris becomes the Democratic nominee, it would be a first
for a South Asian American — and a sign of just how far the diaspora has
come in the U.S., Kugelman said.</p>
<p>Harris and a slew of other political personalities with roots in
India — from Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy to Usha Vance — have become
household names in the U.S. and their rise has put a spotlight on the
country, beyond the cliches of Bollywood and Indian cuisine, he
added.</p>
<p>But the impact of a potential Harris presidency would be much greater
for American politics and the Indian American community than for
India-U.S. ties, experts say.</p>
<p>“When Indians look at Kamala Harris, they’re looking at an American
official more than someone of Indian origin,” said Happymon Jacob, a
professor of diplomacy and disarmament studies at the Jawaharlal Nehru
University.</p>
<p>That she was vice president did not have a substantive impact on
India-U.S. ties, which are expected to grow over shared concerns about
China regardless of who wins the November election, he said.</p>
<p>Modi, for instance, was feted with a glitzy state visit last year
hosted by Biden, where both leaders affirmed that ties between the two
countries were thriving. But the Indian leader was also close to former
President Donald Trump, who received an adulatory reception when he
visited India in 2020 as more than 100,000 people packed into a cricket
stadium to see him.</p>
<p>“So I think there is a reality check in India, that these things
don’t really matter at the end of the day,” Jacob added.</p>
<p>Even if a Harris presidency is unlikely to affect policy toward India
or carry geopolitical implications, for Hindi literature professor
Shivaji Shinde, it would still be a historic and meaningful moment for
the nation.</p>
<p>The “United States is the most powerful country in the world. If they
choose an Indian-origin person as their president, then it will be a
huge moment for India and every Indian would be immensely proud,” Shinde
said in New Delhi on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The news has also made its way to Thulasendrapuram, the village where
Harris’ mother’s family once lived.</p>
<p>“We’re overjoyed to know that someone who traces her ancestry to our
village might become the president of the United States,” said resident
Sudhakar Jayaraman.</p>
<p>He said villagers performed prayers at the local temple, which Harris
and her grandfather once donated to, after they heard the news.</p>
<p>“For a person of Indian descent with Tamil roots to reach such a high
office makes us all proud,” Jayaraman added.</p>

million was raised in the 24 hours after Sunday’s shake-up. So how will
a new name at the top of the Democratic ticket change how campaign
dollars are spent? Plus, little stocks are starting to get bigger
attention.

<h2 id="no-southwest-airlines-is-not-still-using-windows-3.1">No,
Southwest Airlines is not still using Windows 3.1</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-23, from: OS News</p>
<p>A story that’s been persistently making the rounds since the
CrowdStrike event is that while several airline companies were affected
in one way or another, Southwest Airlines escaped the mayhem because
they were still using windows 3.1. It’s a great story that fits the
current zeitgeist about technology and its role in society, underlining
that what is claimed to be technological progress is nothing but
trouble, and that it’s better to stick with the old. At the same time,
anybody who dislikes Southwest Airlines can point and laugh at the
bumbling idiots working there for still using Windows 3.1. It’s like a
perfect storm of technology news click and ragebait. Too bad the whole
story is nonsense. But how could that be? It’s widely reported by
reputable news websites all over the world, shared on social media like
a strain of the common cold, and nobody seems to question it or doubt
the veracity of the story. It seems that Southwest Airlines running on
an operating system from 1992 is a perfectly believable story to just
about everyone, so nobody is questioning it or wondering if it’s
actually true. Well, I did, and no, it’s not true. Let’s start with the
actual source of the claim that Southwest Airlines was unaffected by
CrowdStrike because they’re still using Windows 3.11 for large parts of
their primary systems. This claim is easily traced back to its origin –
a tweet by someone called Artem Russakovskii, stating that “the reason
Southwest is not affected is because they still run on Windows 3.1”.
This tweet formed the basis for virtually all of the stories, but it
contains no sources, no links, no background information, nothing. It
was literally just this one line. It turned out be a troll tweet. A
reply to the tweet by Russakovskii a day later made that very lear: “To
be clear, I was trolling last night, but it turned out to be true. Some
Southwest systems apparently do run Windows 3.1. lol.” However, that
linked article doesn’t cite any sources either, so we’re right back
where we started. After quite a bit of digging – that is, clicking a few
links and like 3 minutes of searching online – following the various
reference and links back to their sources, I managed to find where all
these stories actually come from to arrive at the root claim that
spawned all these other claims. It’s from an article by The Dallas
Morning News, titled “What’s the problem with Southwest Airlines
scheduling system?” At the end of last year, Southwest Airlines’
scheduling system had a major meltdown, leading to a lot of cancelled
flights and stranded travelers just around the Christmas holidays. Of
course, the media wanted to know what caused it, and that’s where this
The Dallas Morning News article comes from. In it, we find the
paragraphs that started the story that Southwest Airlines is still using
Windows 3.1 (and Windows 95!): Southwest uses internally built and
maintained systems called SkySolver and Crew Web Access for pilots and
flight attendants. They can sign on to those systems to pick flights and
then make changes when flights are canceled or delayed or when there is
an illness. “Southwest has generated systems internally themselves
instead of using more standard programs that others have used,”
Montgomery said. “Some systems even look historic like they were
designed on Windows 95.” SkySolver and Crew Web Access are both
available as mobile apps, but those systems often break down during even
mild weather events, and employees end up making phone calls to
Southwest’s crew scheduling help desk to find better routes. During
periods of heavy operational trouble, the system gets bogged down with
too much demand. ↫ Kyle Arnold at The Dallas Morning News That’s it.
That’s where all these stories can trace their origin to. These few
paragraphs do not say that Southwest is still using ancient Windows
versions; it just states that the systems they developed internally,
SkySolver and Crew Web Access, look “historic like they were designed on
Windows 95”. The fact that they are also available as mobile
applications should further make it clear that no, these applications
are not running on Windows 3.1 or Windows 95. Southwest pilots and cabin
crews are definitely not carrying around pocket laptops from the ’90s.
These paragraphs were then misread, misunderstood, and mangled in a game
of social media and bad reporting telephone, and here we are. The fact
that nobody seems to have taken the time to click through a few links to
find the supposed source of these claims, instead focusing on cashing in
on the clicks and rage these stories would illicit, is a rather damning
indictment of the state of online (tech) media. Many of the websites
reporting on these stories are part of giant media conglomerates, have a
massive number of paid staff, and they’re being outdone by a dude in the
Arctic with a small Patreon, minimal journalism training, and some
common sense. This story wasn’t hard to debunk – a few clicks and a few
minutes of online searching is all it took. Ask yourself – why do these
massive news websites not even perform the bare minimum?</p>

reform bill</a> last night that “is expected to bolster the buildout of
both renewable and fossil fuel energy sources,” as <em><em>The
Hill</em></em>

The legislation would impose a timeline on legal challenges to federal
authorizations for energy projects, require annual lease sales of both
offshore wind and offshore oil through 2029, exclude some exploration
activity for geothermal energy from environmental reviews, and scrap the
Biden administration’s (now overturned) pause on approvals for liquefied
natural gas export terminals by requiring the Department of Energy to
decide on approving the terminals within 90 days. The bill also includes
some longstanding Democratic and Republican ideas on environmental
permitting, such as making permitting for renewables projects stand on a
more equal footing with the relatively easy path for permitting oil and
gas projects.
</p>
<p>
Reactions have so far been pretty mixed. Transmission company Grid
United called the act “a significant bipartisan step forward in
streamlining the permitting process for critical energy infrastructure
projects,” and a “game changer for the U.S. electric grid.” Meanwhile
the Center for Biological Diversity called it “the biggest giveaway in
decades to the fossil fuel industry.”

<p>
Manchin and Barrasso are the chair and ranking member (respectively) of
the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. Manchin is an
independent from West Virginia who caucuses with Democrats, while
Barrasso is a Republican from Wyoming, both states with large fossil
energy resources and industries.

When looking at emissions by sector, the sharpest decline will be in the
power sector, where emissions are expected to be at least 42% lower than
current levels by 2035, and possibly up to 83% lower. Renewables could
account for up to 88% of electricity generation that year, and unabated
coal generation will be near zero, thanks largely to the Inflation
Reduction Act’s subsidies and new power plant emission limits imposed by
the Environmental Protection Agency. Transportation emissions will also

expected to become the biggest source of emissions in 2033 and will see

Good Reason, Apache Foundation Says ‘Goodbye’ to Iconic Feather

<p>
“The Apache Software Foundation is making changes in an attempt to right
a wrong it unintentionally created when it adopted its name 25-years
ago.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is an unnecessarily awkward article (why describe the existing logo
as cool in this context?!) to describe a simple premise: the Apache
Software Foundation is slowly, finally, moving away from its
appropriation of the Apache name and its racist use of faux Native
American imagery.
</p>
<p>
For a while, it’s preferred to refer to itself as ASF, and now it’s
going to have a much-needed logo change. That’s fine, but it needs to go
much further. It’s past time to just rip off the Band Aid.
</p>
<p>
Still, this is far better than the obstinate response we’ve seen in the
past to requests for change. A new logo, slight as it is, is hopefully
an iteration in the right direction.

<h2 id="a-look-at-harris-views-on-us-policy-toward-china">A look at
Harris’ views on US policy toward China</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris has not yet won the
Democratic Party’s support for her presidential candidacy, but she has
the endorsement of U.S. President Joe Biden, along with several senior
Democrats, after his withdrawal from the race on Sunday.</p>
<p>If chosen by the party, and elected president, analysts agree Harris
would likely continue the Biden administration’s foreign policy,
including the management of one of the most tense and consequential
relationships — that with China. </p>
<p>When she first became vice president, Harris, a former U.S. senator
and attorney general for California, was considered by many analysts to
be somewhat of a novice in foreign policy. Over the past 3 ½ years as
vice president, she has visited more than 19 countries and met with more
than 150 foreign leaders, according to the White House website.</p>
<p>VOA compiled some of Harris’s remarks on China policy during her
tenure as vice president and earlier as a U.S. senator.</p>
<p>US-China economic relations</p>
<p>In September 2023, Harris traveled to attend the ASEAN summit in
Indonesia’s capital, Jakarta. After the meeting, she spoke about
U.S.-China relations and Indo-Pacific policy on CBS’s “Face the
Nation.”</p>
<p>“We, as the United States, in our policy, it is not about decoupling,
it is about de-risking. It is about understanding,” she said.</p>
<p>“It’s not about pulling out, but it is about ensuring that we are
protecting American interests, and that we are a leader in terms of the
rules of the road, as opposed to following others’ rules,” Harris
said.</p>
<p>China’s economic downturn</p>
<p>“It’s no secret that China is experiencing economic problems,” she
said during the “Face the Nation” interview.</p>
<p>“And what you will find — certainly in my conversations with American
business leaders — is that they are looking at the future in terms of
their capital investments and taking into account which countries are
engaged in practices that are about abiding by the rule of law and
international rules and norms in a way that they can be guaranteed that
there will be some stability so they can make long-term
investments.”</p>
<p>“There is increasingly an understanding that China may not be the
best bet when you are looking for stability, when you are looking for an
investment in a place where there is an adherence to and respect for
international rules and norms,” Harris added.</p>
<p>International aid</p>
<p>During her visit to Africa in March 2023, at a news conference with
Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema, Harris reiterated her call for
“all bilateral official creditors to provide a meaningful debt reduction
for Zambia” — an oblique reference to China, Zambia’s top foreign
creditor. However, she stressed that “our presence here is not about
China.”</p>
<p>US-China relations</p>
<p>Harris’ first meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping was at the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Bangkok in 2022, when
she held brief talks with Xi and stressed the importance of maintaining
“open lines of communication to responsibly manage the competition
between our countries.”</p>
<p>Taiwan</p>
<p>In a September 2022 meeting with South Korean President Yoon Suk
Yeol, Harris reaffirmed that the U.S. would continue to support Taiwan
and oppose any unilateral actions that seek to change the status
quo.</p>
<p>The White House said Harris underscored that the effort to preserve
peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait is an essential element of
a free and open Indo-Pacific region. </p>
<p>During a visit to Japan that same month, she said aboard the
destroyer USS Howard at Yokosuka Naval Base, “We have witnessed
disturbing behavior in the East China Sea and in the South China Sea,
and most recently, provocations across the Taiwan Strait.”</p>
<p>China considers Taiwan to be a breakaway province that must one day
reunite with the mainland, by force if necessary, and often sends
military air and watercraft nearby to assert its claim to the
self-governing island. </p>
<p>South China Sea</p>
<p>During her visit to Japan, Harris commented on China’s aggression in
the South China Sea.</p>
<p>“China is undermining key elements of the international rules-based
order. China has challenged the freedom of the seas. China has flexed
its military and economic might to coerce and intimidate its neighbors,”
she said.</p>
<p>“We will continue to fly, sail, and operate undaunted and unafraid
wherever and whenever international law allows,” Harris added.</p>
<p>Beijing claims most of the South China Sea as its own, putting it in
conflict with Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and
Vietnam. Chinese ships on several occasions this year used water cannons
and blocked its rivals’ ships in the disputed territories. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Last year on “Face the Nation,” Harris said, “What is happening in
terms of unprovoked actions against the Philippine interests in the
South China Sea is significant and we have been very clear that we stand
with the Philippines.”</p>
<p>Beijing and Manila on Sunday announced a deal they say aims to stop
the clashes.</p>
<p>China’s human rights, Hong Kong</p>
<p>During her tenure as a U.S. senator for California, Harris actively
pushed for legislation to uphold human rights in Hong Kong, which
analysts say has seen its autonomy gradually stripped away by Beijing.
 </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In 2019, she co-sponsored the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy
Act introduced by Republican Senator Marco Rubio, which aims to promote
human rights in Hong Kong and sanction officials involved in
“undermining Hong Kong’s fundamental freedoms and autonomy.” The bill
was later signed into law by then-President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Xinjiang</p>
<p>Harris also co-sponsored and facilitated the passage of the Uyghur
Human Rights Policy Act of 2019, which became law in 2020. The bill
authorizes the United States to impose sanctions on “foreign individuals
and entities responsible for human rights violations in Xinjiang,”
China’s westernmost province that is home to the ethnic Uyghurs, a
mainly Muslim minority.        </p>
<p>China denies there are any rights violations in Xinjiang.</p>

<h2 id="new-us-arctic-strategy-focused-on-russian-chinese-inroads">New
US Arctic strategy focused on Russian, Chinese inroads</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The United States is looking to boost intelligence
collection in the Arctic and enhance cooperation with allies in the
region, to prevent Russia and China from exploiting the cold and icy
northern region at America’s expense.</p>
<p>The mandate, part of the Pentagon’s just-released 2024 Arctic
Strategy, comes as U.S. defense officials warn climate change is melting
Arctic ice that used to keep adversaries at bay, and there are
indications of growing Russian-Chinese cooperation in the region.</p>
<p>“In the Arctic, the strategic can quickly become tactical,” said
Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks, briefing reporters at the
Pentagon.</p>
<p>“Ensuring that our troops have the training, the gear and the
operating procedures for the unique Arctic environment [may] be the
difference between mission success and failure,” she added.</p>
<p>The newly unveiled strategy calls for expanding the types of
surveillance and intelligence capabilities that the U.S. military
employs elsewhere in the world to the far north, where frigid
temperatures can interfere with their operation.</p>
<p>Specifically, the strategy outlines the need for more ground-based
sensors, space-based sensors and long-range radar to better pick up on
activity by U.S. adversaries.</p>
<p>The U.S. is also looking to increase its unmanned aerial
reconnaissance capabilities and its communication capabilities.</p>
<p>Hicks said the U.S. has already invested tens of millions of dollars
in such capabilities, but that more is needed.</p>
<p>“The Arctic’s vast distances, especially in North America, make
supporting infrastructure vital for Arctic operations and presence,”
according to the new strategy. “However, much of the legacy Cold War-era
infrastructure has declined over time due to the harsh environment, lack
of investment, and climate change-driven permafrost thawing and coastal
erosion.”</p>
<p>One bonus for the new Arctic strategy, according to U.S. defense
officials, is the accession of Sweden and Finland to NATO, which means
every Arctic nation except for Russia is now part of the Western
alliance.</p>
<p>U.S. officials have repeatedly praised Swedish and Finnish
capabilities in the Arctic, and the strategy envisions additional joint
exercises and cooperation, which could be required to counter an uptick
in Russian and Chinese activities in the region.</p>
<p>“It’s very noticeable and concerning,” Hicks said.</p>
<p>“The Russians, of course, have, even as they’ve continued their
operation, their war in in Ukraine, they’ve been continuing to invest in
their infrastructure throughout the Arctic region that they can access,”
she said. “And then we’ve seen much more PRC [People’s Republic of
China] activity, both in terms of so-called research, but because of
their civil fusion, we always have concern that there’s a military
aspect to that.”</p>
<p>There have also been signs of increased cooperation between Russia
and China.</p>
<p>The two countries conducted a joint naval patrol near Alaska’s
Aleutian Islands last August, prompting the U.S. to deploy four naval
destroyers and patrol aircraft as a precaution.</p>
<p>But Iris Ferguson, deputy assistant secretary of defense for the
Arctic, told reporters Monday that those types of Russian and Chinese
efforts are just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>“We’ve seen an uptick, an uptick in their cooperation over the last
couple of years,” Ferguson said. “We see China investing in a lot of
Russian energy in order to not only have them supply that energy to the
PRC, but also that is helping embolden some of Russia’s activity in
Ukraine.”</p>
<p>Ferguson sought not to overplay the threat, saying Russian-Chinese
cooperation in the Arctic is “somewhat superficial in nature still,
especially from a military perspective.”</p>
<p>However, Pentagon officials expect the Russian-Chinese military
relationship to evolve, noting the growing level of Chinese military
research in the Arctic and Beijing’s attempts to “internationalize” and
influence the region as a whole.</p>
<p>“We see them operating more regularly in the last several years from
a military perspective. Even just a couple of weeks ago, there were
several Chinese warships off of the coast of Alaska,” Ferguson said.
“They are our long-term pacing challenge and I think that that includes
in the Arctic.”</p>
<p>The Russian and Chinese embassies in Washington have yet to respond
to requests for comment.</p>

id="netanyahu-visits-dc-amid-us-political-turmoil-at-critical-juncture-of-gaza-war">Netanyahu
visits DC amid US political turmoil at critical juncture of Gaza
war</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu arrived in Washington
late Monday, the day after President Joe Biden announced he is
withdrawing from the U.S. presidential race – a decision that adds
another layer of uncertainty to U.S.-Israel relations at a crucial
moment in the Gaza war. </p>
<p>Without a cease-fire agreement in place, many had questioned the
timing of Netanyahu’s visit when it was announced in June. Now, facing a
potential shift in American politics, the Israeli leader aims to lay the
groundwork for the next American administration.</p>
<p>A U.S. official said Biden and Netanyahu were expected to meet
Thursday at the White House.</p>
<p>“I will seek to anchor the bipartisan support that is so important
for Israel,” Netanyahu said as he departed Israel. “I will tell my
friends on both sides of the aisle that regardless of who the American
people choose as their next president, Israel remains America’s
indispensable and strong ally in the Middle East.”</p>
<p>While publicly Netanyahu aims for the appearance of neutrality in the
now likely match between potential Democratic presidential nominee Vice
President Kamala Harris and Republican presidential nominee Donald
Trump, there is little doubt whom Netanyahu is rooting for, said
Jonathan Rynhold, head of the Department of Political Studies at
Israel’s Bar-Ilan University.</p>
<p>“Republicans in general are more supportive of Israel’s security
agenda,” he told VOA. “They’re more forgiving of Israel’s right-wing
government and its policies towards the Palestinians.”</p>
<p>That’s especially true of Trump, whose administration’s pro-Israeli
policies were “quite extraordinary” and “created a sugar high” for the
country, said Aaron David Miller, a former U.S. negotiator for the
Middle East who is now a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace.</p>
<p>Trump brokered the Abraham Accords that normalized Israel’s
diplomatic ties with some of its Arab neighbors – the United Arab
Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco. Trump also moved the U.S. Embassy from
Tel Aviv to contested Jerusalem and recognized Israeli annexation of the
Golan Heights.</p>
<p>While in the U.S., Netanyahu is requesting to meet with Trump, in
part to dismiss claims that there are tensions between him and the
former president, said Nimrod Goren, senior fellow for Israeli affairs
at the Middle East Institute.</p>
<p>Trump soured on Netanyahu when the prime minister congratulated Biden
on his win in 2020. The former president has also warned Israel to “get
back to peace and stop killing people.”</p>
<p>The Trump campaign has not responded to VOA for confirmation on
Netanyahu’s request for a meeting.</p>
<p>Netanyahu meeting Harris</p>
<p>Harris will meet with Netanyahu this week at the White House,
separate from the prime minister’s planned meeting with Biden, her aide
told VOA. “Throughout her career, the vice president has had an
unwavering commitment to the security of Israel,” the aide said.</p>
<p>Harris also has strong ties to the country’s Jewish community. Her
husband, second gentleman Doug Emhoff, is Jewish and has played a key
role in the administration’s efforts to combat antisemitism.</p>
<p>However, instead of presiding over the Senate chamber during
Netanyahu’s speech to Congress on Wednesday, Harris will travel to
Indianapolis, Indiana, to speak in front of the historically Black
sorority Zeta Phi Beta.</p>
<p>The optics of applauding Netanyahu would not fly well amid anger over
Gaza from progressives, Arab Americans and American Muslims who
traditionally vote for Democratic candidates. Dozens of congressional
Democrats in Congress are also expected to boycott the speech.</p>
<p>Gestures aside, a Harris presidency would unlikely yield a
significant change in Middle East policy, Carnegie’s Miller told VOA,
and would remain relatively “mainstream when it comes to supporting the
U.S.-Israeli relationship.”</p>
<p>But Harris would be “far tougher, certainly rhetorically, on Israeli
settlement activity, and much more, much more sympathetic to Palestinian
suffering and Palestinian rights,” he said.</p>
<p>Harris’ comments in office have been largely in line with Biden on
key foreign policy issues and it’s unclear whether she’ll manifest her
own doctrine if elected.</p>
<p>Compared to Biden, who has an extraordinarily clear, integrated and
well-thought-out American grand strategy, “she’s a blank slate, really,
on a foreign policy,” Rynhold said.</p>
<p>Netanyahu’s domestic goals</p>
<p>With the Israeli Knesset nearing a three-month recess, Netanyahu is
aiming to advance his own domestic political goals, and a cease-fire
deal could be the silver lining, Goren said.</p>
<p>“There may be a political timing that will enable Netanyahu to make a
move once the Knesset is in recess, without having that lead to
immediate coalition breakdown,” he said. “That could not be done until
the Knesset comes back to operation.”</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday that a deal was
within reach.</p>
<p>However, Goren and other analysts said they were skeptical the
cease-fire deal would extend beyond phase one: a six-week pause in
fighting in exchange for some of the hostages held by Hamas.</p>

id="missouri-judge-overturns-murder-conviction-of-man-imprisoned-more-than-30-years">Missouri
judge overturns murder conviction of man imprisoned more than 30
years</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>St. Louis — A Missouri judge on Monday overturned the conviction of
Christopher Dunn, who has spent more than 30 years in prison for a
killing he has long contended he didn’t commit.</p>
<p>The ruling is likely to free Dunn from prison, but it wasn’t
immediately clear when that would happen. He has been serving a sentence
of life without parole.</p>
<p>St. Louis Circuit Judge Jason Sengheiser’s ruling came several weeks
after he presided over a three-day hearing on Dunn’s fate.</p>
<p>Dunn, now 52, was convicted of first-degree murder in the 1990
shooting of 15-year-old Ricco Rogers. St. Louis Circuit Attorney Gabe
Gore filed a motion in February seeking to vacate the guilty verdict. A
hearing was in May.</p>
<p>Sengheiser, in his ruling, wrote that the “Circuit Attorney has made
a clear and convincing showing of ‘actual innocence’ that undermines the
basis for Dunn’s convictions because in light of new evidence, no juror,
acting reasonably, would have voted to find Dunn guilty of these crimes
beyond a reasonable doubt.”</p>
<p>Dunn’s attorney, Midwest Innocence Project Executive Director Tricia
Rojo Bushnell, said she was “overjoyed” by the judge’s ruling.</p>
<p>“Now, Chris looks forward to spending time with his wife and family
as a free man,” Bushnell said in a statement.</p>
<p>The Missouri Attorney General’s Office opposed the effort to vacate
Dunn’s conviction. Lawyers for the state said at the May hearing that
initial testimony from two boys at the scene who identified Dunn as the
shooter was correct, even though they later recanted as adults.</p>
<p>“That verdict was accurate, and that verdict should stand,” Assistant
Attorney General Tristin Estep said at the hearing.</p>
<p>Spokesperson Madeline Sieren said the Attorney General’s Office will
appeal.</p>
<p>The decision in Dunn’s case came days after Sandra Hemme was freed
from a western Missouri prison after serving 43 years for a murder that
a judge determined she didn’t commit. Bailey’s office also opposed
Hemme’s release.</p>
<p>A Missouri law adopted in 2021 lets prosecutors request hearings when
they see evidence of a wrongful conviction. While Bailey’s office is not
required to oppose such efforts, he also opposed another effort in
St. Louis that resulted in Lamar Johnson being freed last year after
serving 28 years for a murder case in which a judge ruled he was
wrongfully convicted.</p>
<p>Rogers was shot May 18, 1990, when a gunman opened fire while he was
with a group of other teenage boys outside a home. DeMorris Stepp, 14,
and Michael Davis Jr., 12, both initially identified Dunn as the
shooter.</p>
<p>In a recorded interview played at the hearing, Davis said he lied
because he thought Dunn was affiliated with a rival gang.</p>
<p>Stepp’s story has changed a few times over the years, Gore said at
the hearing. Most recently he has said he did not see Dunn as the
shooter. Gore said another judge previously found Stepp to be a
“completely unreliable witness” and urged Sengheiser to discount him
altogether.</p>
<p>Dunn has said he was at his mother’s home at the time of the
shooting. Childhood friend Nicole Bailey testified that she spoke with
him by phone that night and he was on a phone at his mother’s house.</p>
<p>Estep, the assistant attorney general, said that alibi could not be
trusted and Dunn’s story has shifted multiple times over the years. Dunn
did not testify at the hearing.</p>
<p>The 2021 law has resulted in the the release of two men who each
spent decades in prison. In addition to Johnson, Kevin Strickland was
freed in 2021 after more than 40 years for three killings in Kansas City
after a judge ruled he was wrongfully convicted in 1979.</p>
<p>Another hearing is next month for Marcellus Williams, who narrowly
escaped lethal injection and is now facing another execution date.</p>
<p>St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell filed a motion in
January to vacate the conviction of Williams, who was convicted in the
fatal stabbing of Lisha Gayle in 1998. Bell’s motion said three experts
determined that Williams’ DNA was not on the handle of the butcher knife
used in the killing.</p>
<p>Williams was hours from execution in 2017 when then-Gov. Eric
Greitens halted it and appointed a board of inquiry to examine his
innocence claim. The board never issued a ruling, and Gov. Mike Parson,
like Greitens a Republican, dissolved it last year.</p>
<p>The Missouri Supreme Court ruled this month that Parson had the
authority to dissolve the board and set a new execution date of
Sept. 24.</p>

continues to recover from COVID, stays out of public view after ending
campaign</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>REHOBOTH BEACH, Delaware — President Joe Biden’s “symptoms have
almost resolved completely” from COVID-19, according to his physician,
as the president on Monday remained out of public view for the fifth
straight day.</p>
<p>Biden called into the Wilmington, Delaware, headquarters of his
former campaign during a visit by Vice President Kamala Harris, whose
bid for the White House has been endorsed by Biden. The president sought
to pep up the staff, urging them to give “every bit” of their “heart and
soul” to Harris. Biden also vowed to be “out on the road” campaigning
for his vice president.</p>
<p>“If I didn’t have COVID, I’d be standing there with you,” said Biden,
whose voice sounded a touch gravelly.</p>
<p>The president was last seen in public late Wednesday after arriving
at a U.S. air base in Dover, Delaware, after testing positive for
COVID-19 while campaigning in Las Vegas earlier in the day. He then
motorcaded to his vacation home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware.</p>
<p>Biden’s physician, Dr. Kevin O’Connor, said that the president had
completed his 10th dose of the COVID-fighting medication Paxlovid on
Monday morning and continued to perform all of his presidential
duties.</p>
<p>“His symptoms have almost resolved completely. His pulse, blood
pressure, respiratory rate and temperature remain absolutely normal,”
O’Connor wrote. “His oxygen saturation continues to be excellent on room
air. His lungs remain clear.”</p>
<p>The White House said Biden received separate briefings on Monday from
homeland security adviser Liz Sherwood-Randall and national security
adviser Jake Sullivan. Both briefings were conducted virtually.</p>
<p>Biden’s public schedule for the week has remained clear as he
recovers from the virus, but he said in his letter on Sunday that he
planned to deliver an address to the nation this week to discuss his
decision to end his candidacy.</p>
<p>According to his official schedule, Biden is planning to return to
the White House on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Biden plans to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at
the White House this week, according to a person familiar with the
president’s schedule who was not authorized to comment publicly.</p>
<p>Biden also plans to meet at the White House later this week with the
families of Americans who are still being held hostage in Gaza,
according to a statement from the group of families who met privately
with Sullivan earlier Monday.</p>
<p>It would be the second time that Biden has met with the families. The
families again publicly urged Israel and Hamas to come to an agreement
on a cease-fire deal that would release their loved ones. Biden in late
May proposed a three-phased deal aimed at returning remaining hostages
taken by Hamas in the Oct. 7 attack on Israel and could potentially lead
to a permanent truce to end the nine-month war in Gaza.</p>
<p>“We’re going to keep working to an end to the war in Gaza,” Biden
said during his call-in to the campaign headquarters. “I’ll be working
really closely with the Israelis and with the Palestinians to try to
work out how we can get the Gaza war to end, and Middle East peace, and
get all those hostages home. I think we’re on the verge of being able to
do that.”</p>

see Biden’s campaign exit having no impact on US-South Korea ties</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — U.S. President Joe Biden’s announcement that he was
dropping his reelection bid sparked reactions from former U.S. officials
who said Washington’s relations with Seoul are at a crossroads and will
either continue on the same path or make a sharp turn.</p>
<p>These officials, who dealt extensively with South Korea, said Biden’s
exit would have no immediate impact on Washington-Seoul ties.</p>
<p>“The U.S.-ROK alliance has never been stronger and more capable than
it is today, and that alliance will remain so until the end of President
Biden’s term next year,” said Evans Revere, who served as the principal
deputy assistant secretary and acting assistant secretary of state for
East Asia and Pacific affairs.</p>
<p>The Republic of Korea (ROK) is the official name for South Korea.</p>
<p>“Given that Biden will remain president for the next six months, I
see little change in U.S. foreign and national security policy and
posture over that time with either allies or adversaries, regardless of
whatever contingencies or provocations might arise, including on the
Korean Peninsula,” Robert Rapson, who served as deputy chief of mission
and charge d’affaires at the U.S. Embassy in Seoul from 2018 to 2021,
said in written comments.</p>
<p>Biden called off his bid for reelection Sunday amid mounting pressure
from top Democrats who cited his declining polling numbers since his
poor debate performance against former President Donald Trump last
month.</p>
<p>Biden said in a letter posted on his social media account X, formerly
Twitter, that he would focus the remainder of his term on presidential
duties and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic
nominee for president. He said he would speak more about his decision
later this week.</p>
<p>The South Korean Foreign Ministry sent a statement via email to VOA’s
Korean Service on Sunday that said Seoul “will continue to work closely
with the United States to maintain and develop the ROK-U.S. alliance,
which has been upgraded to a global comprehensive strategic
alliance.”</p>
<p>The office of South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said in a
statement Sunday that it “would not comment on domestic political
situations of any other countries.”</p>
<p>The statement continued, “Bipartisan support for the ROK-U.S.
alliance is rock solid. We will closely collaborate with the United
States to continuously strengthen the global comprehensive strategic
alliance between the Republic of Korea and the United States.”</p>
<p>Harris, if nominated by her party at the Democratic National
Convention next month, will face Trump, who secured the presidential
nomination at the Republican National Convention last week.</p>
<p>“If Trump wins, then yes, there could be big changes to the Nuclear
Consultative Group and U.S. attitudes toward North Korea and the ROK
nuclear program,” said Gary Samore, former White House coordinator for
arms control and WMD during the Obama administration.</p>
<p>“If Harris wins, I don’t think there’ll be big changes. I think
there’ll be continuity,” he said.</p>
<p>Dennis Wilder, senior director for East Asia at the White House’s
National Security Council during the George W. Bush administration, said
some changes are to be expected if the Republicans win. But “in the
Democratic Party, the views are quite set, and the views are very
positive on South Korea.”</p>
<p>Unlike Trump, who preferred personal engagement with North Korean
leader Kim Jong Un, Biden and Yoon have preferred strengthening their
defense against North Korea through mechanisms such as the Nuclear
Consultative Group.</p>
<p>The NCG is a bilateral body aimed at discussing joint nuclear
planning to strengthen deterrence against North Korea. The U.S. and
South Korean heads of the NCG signed nuclear deterrence and operations
guidelines on July 11 in Washington.</p>
<p>During their meeting on the sidelines of a NATO summit in Washington
the same day, Biden and Yoon referred to the guidelines as “the
advancement of U.S.-ROK security cooperation” since they announced the
Washington Declaration in April.</p>
<p>The Washington Declaration affirmed the U.S. use of nuclear weapons
to defend South Korea and Seoul’s commitment toward
nonproliferation.</p>
<p>Yoon touted Seoul-Washington ties as a “nuclear-based alliance” on
July 16 after returning home from Washington.</p>
<p>But a possible reelection of Trump, who had not discounted a U.S.
troop reduction in South Korea, has fueled already growing calls among
the South Korean public and some lawmakers for Seoul to develop its own
nuclear weapons as they became increasingly uncertain of the U.S.
defense commitment.</p>
<p>Harry Harris, former U.S. ambassador to South Korea during the Trump
administration, said, however, “Alliance[s] transcend individual
leaders.”</p>
<p>“I foresee no reduction in cooperation and coordination between the
U.S. and South Korea, in all aspects of our relationship and especially
in the combined military relationship,” he added.</p>

The circular economy – the newest magical word in the sustainable
development vocabulary – promises economic growth without environmental
destruction or waste. However, growth makes a circular economy
impossible, even if we recycle all raw materials and all recycling is
100% efficient. No technology can change that because it’s not a
technological problem. In addition, many modern products are too complex
to recycle.
</p>
<p>
In this series of articles, LOW←TECH MAGAZINE explores how the
circularity of various technologies like bicycles, solar panels, and
wind turbines evolves. Placing the recycling of resources in a
historical context makes clear that we are not moving toward a circular
economy but rather increasingly away from it.
