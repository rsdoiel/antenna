&quot;That [voters] were insufficiently alarmed about the damage Trump will do – and that they actually thought he has some way to make the economy better and bring inflation down – was the result of a massive information system failure.&quot;

Last month, we blogged about the key takeaways from the 2024 TDM exemptions recently put in place by the Librarian of Congress, including how the 2024 exemptions (1) expand researchers’ access to existing corpora, (2) definitively allow the viewing and annotation of copyrighted materials for TDM research purposes, and (3) create new obligations for researchers [&#8230;]

## Hope in the Dark

“Cause and effect assume history marches forward, but history is not an
army. It is a crab scuttling sideways, a drip of soft water wearing away
a stone, an earthquake breaking centuries of tension. Sometimes one
person inspires a movement, or her words do decades later; sometimes a
few passionate people change the world; sometimes they start a mass
movement and millions do; sometimes those millions are stirred by the
same outage or the same ideal, and the change comes upon us like a
change of weather. All that these transformations have in common is that
they begin in hope. To hope is to gamble. It’s to bet on the future, on
your desires, on the possibility that an open heart and uncertainty is
better than gloom and safety. To hope is dangerous, and yet it is the
opposite of fear, for to live is to risk.”

## CloudKit Reference and Index Issues

date: 2024-11-07, from: Michael Tsai

Kuba Suder: CloudKit also automatically creates indexes for each field in each record type - when you&#8217;re done with development, you can delete some indexes that you won&#8217;t need so they don&#8217;t waste space in the production database. Apple: A request to fetch records performs a query on indexed fields for a particular record type. [&#8230;]
