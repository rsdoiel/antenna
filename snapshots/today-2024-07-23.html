Despite threats of legal challenges from the right, Vice President
Kamala Harris’ camp appears poised to inherit around $100 million from
what was the Biden-Harris campaign — and that’s after an additional $100
million was raised in the 24 hours after Sunday’s shake-up. So how will
a new name at the top of the Democratic ticket change how campaign
dollars are spent? Plus, little stocks are starting to get bigger
attention.

<h2 id="no-southwest-airlines-is-not-still-using-windows-3.1">No,
Southwest Airlines is not still using Windows 3.1</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-23, from: OS News</p>
<p>A story that’s been persistently making the rounds since the
CrowdStrike event is that while several airline companies were affected
in one way or another, Southwest Airlines escaped the mayhem because
they were still using windows 3.1. It’s a great story that fits the
current zeitgeist about technology and its role in society, underlining
that what is claimed to be technological progress is nothing but
trouble, and that it’s better to stick with the old. At the same time,
anybody who dislikes Southwest Airlines can point and laugh at the
bumbling idiots working there for still using Windows 3.1. It’s like a
perfect storm of technology news click and ragebait. Too bad the whole
story is nonsense. But how could that be? It’s widely reported by
reputable news websites all over the world, shared on social media like
a strain of the common cold, and nobody seems to question it or doubt
the veracity of the story. It seems that Southwest Airlines running on
an operating system from 1992 is a perfectly believable story to just
about everyone, so nobody is questioning it or wondering if it’s
actually true. Well, I did, and no, it’s not true. Let’s start with the
actual source of the claim that Southwest Airlines was unaffected by
CrowdStrike because they’re still using Windows 3.11 for large parts of
their primary systems. This claim is easily traced back to its origin –
a tweet by someone called Artem Russakovskii, stating that “the reason
Southwest is not affected is because they still run on Windows 3.1”.
This tweet formed the basis for virtually all of the stories, but it
contains no sources, no links, no background information, nothing. It
was literally just this one line. It turned out be a troll tweet. A
reply to the tweet by Russakovskii a day later made that very lear: “To
be clear, I was trolling last night, but it turned out to be true. Some
Southwest systems apparently do run Windows 3.1. lol.” However, that
linked article doesn’t cite any sources either, so we’re right back
where we started. After quite a bit of digging – that is, clicking a few
links and like 3 minutes of searching online – following the various
reference and links back to their sources, I managed to find where all
these stories actually come from to arrive at the root claim that
spawned all these other claims. It’s from an article by The Dallas
Morning News, titled “What’s the problem with Southwest Airlines
scheduling system?” At the end of last year, Southwest Airlines’
scheduling system had a major meltdown, leading to a lot of cancelled
flights and stranded travelers just around the Christmas holidays. Of
course, the media wanted to know what caused it, and that’s where this
The Dallas Morning News article comes from. In it, we find the
paragraphs that started the story that Southwest Airlines is still using
Windows 3.1 (and Windows 95!): Southwest uses internally built and
maintained systems called SkySolver and Crew Web Access for pilots and
flight attendants. They can sign on to those systems to pick flights and
then make changes when flights are canceled or delayed or when there is
an illness. “Southwest has generated systems internally themselves
instead of using more standard programs that others have used,”
Montgomery said. “Some systems even look historic like they were
designed on Windows 95.” SkySolver and Crew Web Access are both
available as mobile apps, but those systems often break down during even
mild weather events, and employees end up making phone calls to
Southwest’s crew scheduling help desk to find better routes. During
periods of heavy operational trouble, the system gets bogged down with
too much demand. ↫ Kyle Arnold at The Dallas Morning News That’s it.
That’s where all these stories can trace their origin to. These few
paragraphs do not say that Southwest is still using ancient Windows
versions; it just states that the systems they developed internally,
SkySolver and Crew Web Access, look “historic like they were designed on
Windows 95”. The fact that they are also available as mobile
applications should further make it clear that no, these applications
are not running on Windows 3.1 or Windows 95. Southwest pilots and cabin
crews are definitely not carrying around pocket laptops from the ’90s.
These paragraphs were then misread, misunderstood, and mangled in a game
of social media and bad reporting telephone, and here we are. The fact
that nobody seems to have taken the time to click through a few links to
find the supposed source of these claims, instead focusing on cashing in
on the clicks and rage these stories would illicit, is a rather damning
indictment of the state of online (tech) media. Many of the websites
reporting on these stories are part of giant media conglomerates, have a
massive number of paid staff, and they’re being outdone by a dude in the
Arctic with a small Patreon, minimal journalism training, and some
common sense. This story wasn’t hard to debunk – a few clicks and a few
minutes of online searching is all it took. Ask yourself – why do these
massive news websites not even perform the bare minimum?</p>

The legislation would impose a timeline on legal challenges to federal
authorizations for energy projects, require annual lease sales of both
offshore wind and offshore oil through 2029, exclude some exploration
activity for geothermal energy from environmental reviews, and scrap the
Biden administration’s (now overturned) pause on approvals for liquefied
natural gas export terminals by requiring the Department of Energy to
decide on approving the terminals within 90 days. The bill also includes
some longstanding Democratic and Republican ideas on environmental
permitting, such as making permitting for renewables projects stand on a
more equal footing with the relatively easy path for permitting oil and
gas projects.
</p>
<p>
Reactions have so far been pretty mixed. Transmission company Grid
United called the act “a significant bipartisan step forward in
streamlining the permitting process for critical energy infrastructure
projects,” and a “game changer for the U.S. electric grid.” Meanwhile
the Center for Biological Diversity called it “the biggest giveaway in
decades to the fossil fuel industry.”

of commercial aircraft could be used to keep tabs on the atmosphere.
NOAA already regularly measures air pollution by contracting with

restricted. “Installing instruments on airliners would vastly increase

When looking at emissions by sector, the sharpest decline will be in the
power sector, where emissions are expected to be at least 42% lower than
current levels by 2035, and possibly up to 83% lower. Renewables could
account for up to 88% of electricity generation that year, and unabated
coal generation will be near zero, thanks largely to the Inflation
Reduction Act’s subsidies and new power plant emission limits imposed by
the Environmental Protection Agency. Transportation emissions will also
fall significantly thanks to the EPA’s tailpipe rules. Industry is
expected to become the biggest source of emissions in 2033 and will see
just modest declines, most of which will be in oil and gas operations.
</p>
<p>
The group applauded this progress but said growing demand for
electricity (especially from data centers) coupled with slow permitting,
building, and grid interconnection for clean energy projects could put
Paris targets even further out of reach.

<p>
This is an unnecessarily awkward article (why describe the existing logo

Software Foundation is slowly, finally, moving away from its
appropriation of the Apache name and its racist use of faux Native
American imagery.
</p>
<p>
For a while, it’s preferred to refer to itself as ASF, and now it’s
going to have a much-needed logo change. That’s fine, but it needs to go
much further. It’s past time to just rip off the Band Aid.
</p>
<p>
Still, this is far better than the obstinate response we’ve seen in the
past to requests for change. A new logo, slight as it is, is hopefully
an iteration in the right direction.

<h2 id="a-look-at-harris-views-on-us-policy-toward-china">A look at
Harris’ views on US policy toward China</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris has not yet won the
Democratic Party’s support for her presidential candidacy, but she has
the endorsement of U.S. President Joe Biden, along with several senior
Democrats, after his withdrawal from the race on Sunday.</p>
<p>If chosen by the party, and elected president, analysts agree Harris
would likely continue the Biden administration’s foreign policy,
including the management of one of the most tense and consequential
relationships — that with China. </p>
<p>When she first became vice president, Harris, a former U.S. senator
and attorney general for California, was considered by many analysts to
be somewhat of a novice in foreign policy. Over the past 3 ½ years as
vice president, she has visited more than 19 countries and met with more
than 150 foreign leaders, according to the White House website.</p>
<p>VOA compiled some of Harris’s remarks on China policy during her
tenure as vice president and earlier as a U.S. senator.</p>
<p>US-China economic relations</p>
<p>In September 2023, Harris traveled to attend the ASEAN summit in
Indonesia’s capital, Jakarta. After the meeting, she spoke about
U.S.-China relations and Indo-Pacific policy on CBS’s “Face the
Nation.”</p>
<p>“We, as the United States, in our policy, it is not about decoupling,
it is about de-risking. It is about understanding,” she said.</p>
<p>“It’s not about pulling out, but it is about ensuring that we are
protecting American interests, and that we are a leader in terms of the
rules of the road, as opposed to following others’ rules,” Harris
said.</p>
<p>China’s economic downturn</p>
<p>“It’s no secret that China is experiencing economic problems,” she
said during the “Face the Nation” interview.</p>
<p>“And what you will find — certainly in my conversations with American
business leaders — is that they are looking at the future in terms of
their capital investments and taking into account which countries are
engaged in practices that are about abiding by the rule of law and
international rules and norms in a way that they can be guaranteed that
there will be some stability so they can make long-term
investments.”</p>
<p>“There is increasingly an understanding that China may not be the
best bet when you are looking for stability, when you are looking for an
investment in a place where there is an adherence to and respect for
international rules and norms,” Harris added.</p>
<p>International aid</p>
<p>During her visit to Africa in March 2023, at a news conference with
Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema, Harris reiterated her call for
“all bilateral official creditors to provide a meaningful debt reduction
for Zambia” — an oblique reference to China, Zambia’s top foreign
creditor. However, she stressed that “our presence here is not about
China.”</p>
<p>US-China relations</p>
<p>Harris’ first meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping was at the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Bangkok in 2022, when
she held brief talks with Xi and stressed the importance of maintaining
“open lines of communication to responsibly manage the competition
between our countries.”</p>
<p>Taiwan</p>
<p>In a September 2022 meeting with South Korean President Yoon Suk
Yeol, Harris reaffirmed that the U.S. would continue to support Taiwan
and oppose any unilateral actions that seek to change the status
quo.</p>
<p>The White House said Harris underscored that the effort to preserve
peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait is an essential element of
a free and open Indo-Pacific region. </p>
<p>During a visit to Japan that same month, she said aboard the
destroyer USS Howard at Yokosuka Naval Base, “We have witnessed
disturbing behavior in the East China Sea and in the South China Sea,
and most recently, provocations across the Taiwan Strait.”</p>
<p>China considers Taiwan to be a breakaway province that must one day
reunite with the mainland, by force if necessary, and often sends
military air and watercraft nearby to assert its claim to the
self-governing island. </p>
<p>South China Sea</p>
<p>During her visit to Japan, Harris commented on China’s aggression in
the South China Sea.</p>
<p>“China is undermining key elements of the international rules-based
order. China has challenged the freedom of the seas. China has flexed
its military and economic might to coerce and intimidate its neighbors,”
she said.</p>
<p>“We will continue to fly, sail, and operate undaunted and unafraid
wherever and whenever international law allows,” Harris added.</p>
<p>Beijing claims most of the South China Sea as its own, putting it in
conflict with Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and
Vietnam. Chinese ships on several occasions this year used water cannons
and blocked its rivals’ ships in the disputed territories. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Last year on “Face the Nation,” Harris said, “What is happening in
terms of unprovoked actions against the Philippine interests in the
South China Sea is significant and we have been very clear that we stand
with the Philippines.”</p>
<p>Beijing and Manila on Sunday announced a deal they say aims to stop
the clashes.</p>
<p>China’s human rights, Hong Kong</p>
<p>During her tenure as a U.S. senator for California, Harris actively
pushed for legislation to uphold human rights in Hong Kong, which
analysts say has seen its autonomy gradually stripped away by Beijing.
 </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In 2019, she co-sponsored the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy
Act introduced by Republican Senator Marco Rubio, which aims to promote
human rights in Hong Kong and sanction officials involved in
“undermining Hong Kong’s fundamental freedoms and autonomy.” The bill
was later signed into law by then-President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Xinjiang</p>
<p>Harris also co-sponsored and facilitated the passage of the Uyghur
Human Rights Policy Act of 2019, which became law in 2020. The bill
authorizes the United States to impose sanctions on “foreign individuals
and entities responsible for human rights violations in Xinjiang,”
China’s westernmost province that is home to the ethnic Uyghurs, a
mainly Muslim minority.        </p>
<p>China denies there are any rights violations in Xinjiang.</p>

<h2 id="new-us-arctic-strategy-focused-on-russian-chinese-inroads">New
US Arctic strategy focused on Russian, Chinese inroads</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The United States is looking to boost intelligence
collection in the Arctic and enhance cooperation with allies in the
region, to prevent Russia and China from exploiting the cold and icy
northern region at America’s expense.</p>
<p>The mandate, part of the Pentagon’s just-released 2024 Arctic
Strategy, comes as U.S. defense officials warn climate change is melting
Arctic ice that used to keep adversaries at bay, and there are
indications of growing Russian-Chinese cooperation in the region.</p>
<p>“In the Arctic, the strategic can quickly become tactical,” said
Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks, briefing reporters at the
Pentagon.</p>
<p>“Ensuring that our troops have the training, the gear and the
operating procedures for the unique Arctic environment [may] be the
difference between mission success and failure,” she added.</p>
<p>The newly unveiled strategy calls for expanding the types of
surveillance and intelligence capabilities that the U.S. military
employs elsewhere in the world to the far north, where frigid
temperatures can interfere with their operation.</p>
<p>Specifically, the strategy outlines the need for more ground-based
sensors, space-based sensors and long-range radar to better pick up on
activity by U.S. adversaries.</p>
<p>The U.S. is also looking to increase its unmanned aerial
reconnaissance capabilities and its communication capabilities.</p>
<p>Hicks said the U.S. has already invested tens of millions of dollars
in such capabilities, but that more is needed.</p>
<p>“The Arctic’s vast distances, especially in North America, make
supporting infrastructure vital for Arctic operations and presence,”
according to the new strategy. “However, much of the legacy Cold War-era
infrastructure has declined over time due to the harsh environment, lack
of investment, and climate change-driven permafrost thawing and coastal
erosion.”</p>
<p>One bonus for the new Arctic strategy, according to U.S. defense
officials, is the accession of Sweden and Finland to NATO, which means
every Arctic nation except for Russia is now part of the Western
alliance.</p>
<p>U.S. officials have repeatedly praised Swedish and Finnish
capabilities in the Arctic, and the strategy envisions additional joint
exercises and cooperation, which could be required to counter an uptick
in Russian and Chinese activities in the region.</p>
<p>“It’s very noticeable and concerning,” Hicks said.</p>
<p>“The Russians, of course, have, even as they’ve continued their
operation, their war in in Ukraine, they’ve been continuing to invest in
their infrastructure throughout the Arctic region that they can access,”
she said. “And then we’ve seen much more PRC [People’s Republic of
China] activity, both in terms of so-called research, but because of
their civil fusion, we always have concern that there’s a military
aspect to that.”</p>
<p>There have also been signs of increased cooperation between Russia
and China.</p>
<p>The two countries conducted a joint naval patrol near Alaska’s
Aleutian Islands last August, prompting the U.S. to deploy four naval
destroyers and patrol aircraft as a precaution.</p>
<p>But Iris Ferguson, deputy assistant secretary of defense for the
Arctic, told reporters Monday that those types of Russian and Chinese
efforts are just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>“We’ve seen an uptick, an uptick in their cooperation over the last
couple of years,” Ferguson said. “We see China investing in a lot of
Russian energy in order to not only have them supply that energy to the
PRC, but also that is helping embolden some of Russia’s activity in
Ukraine.”</p>
<p>Ferguson sought not to overplay the threat, saying Russian-Chinese
cooperation in the Arctic is “somewhat superficial in nature still,
especially from a military perspective.”</p>
<p>However, Pentagon officials expect the Russian-Chinese military
relationship to evolve, noting the growing level of Chinese military
research in the Arctic and Beijing’s attempts to “internationalize” and
influence the region as a whole.</p>
<p>“We see them operating more regularly in the last several years from
a military perspective. Even just a couple of weeks ago, there were
several Chinese warships off of the coast of Alaska,” Ferguson said.
“They are our long-term pacing challenge and I think that that includes
in the Arctic.”</p>
<p>The Russian and Chinese embassies in Washington have yet to respond
to requests for comment.</p>

id="netanyahu-visits-dc-amid-us-political-turmoil-at-critical-juncture-of-gaza-war">Netanyahu
visits DC amid US political turmoil at critical juncture of Gaza
war</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu arrived in Washington
late Monday, the day after President Joe Biden announced he is
withdrawing from the U.S. presidential race – a decision that adds
another layer of uncertainty to U.S.-Israel relations at a crucial
moment in the Gaza war. </p>
<p>Without a cease-fire agreement in place, many had questioned the
timing of Netanyahu’s visit when it was announced in June. Now, facing a
potential shift in American politics, the Israeli leader aims to lay the
groundwork for the next American administration.</p>
<p>A U.S. official said Biden and Netanyahu were expected to meet
Thursday at the White House.</p>
<p>“I will seek to anchor the bipartisan support that is so important
for Israel,” Netanyahu said as he departed Israel. “I will tell my
friends on both sides of the aisle that regardless of who the American
people choose as their next president, Israel remains America’s
indispensable and strong ally in the Middle East.”</p>
<p>While publicly Netanyahu aims for the appearance of neutrality in the
now likely match between potential Democratic presidential nominee Vice
President Kamala Harris and Republican presidential nominee Donald
Trump, there is little doubt whom Netanyahu is rooting for, said
Jonathan Rynhold, head of the Department of Political Studies at
Israel’s Bar-Ilan University.</p>
<p>“Republicans in general are more supportive of Israel’s security
agenda,” he told VOA. “They’re more forgiving of Israel’s right-wing
government and its policies towards the Palestinians.”</p>
<p>That’s especially true of Trump, whose administration’s pro-Israeli
policies were “quite extraordinary” and “created a sugar high” for the
country, said Aaron David Miller, a former U.S. negotiator for the
Middle East who is now a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace.</p>
<p>Trump brokered the Abraham Accords that normalized Israel’s
diplomatic ties with some of its Arab neighbors – the United Arab
Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco. Trump also moved the U.S. Embassy from
Tel Aviv to contested Jerusalem and recognized Israeli annexation of the
Golan Heights.</p>
<p>While in the U.S., Netanyahu is requesting to meet with Trump, in
part to dismiss claims that there are tensions between him and the
former president, said Nimrod Goren, senior fellow for Israeli affairs
at the Middle East Institute.</p>
<p>Trump soured on Netanyahu when the prime minister congratulated Biden
on his win in 2020. The former president has also warned Israel to “get
back to peace and stop killing people.”</p>
<p>The Trump campaign has not responded to VOA for confirmation on
Netanyahu’s request for a meeting.</p>
<p>Netanyahu meeting Harris</p>
<p>Harris will meet with Netanyahu this week at the White House,
separate from the prime minister’s planned meeting with Biden, her aide
told VOA. “Throughout her career, the vice president has had an
unwavering commitment to the security of Israel,” the aide said.</p>
<p>Harris also has strong ties to the country’s Jewish community. Her
husband, second gentleman Doug Emhoff, is Jewish and has played a key
role in the administration’s efforts to combat antisemitism.</p>
<p>However, instead of presiding over the Senate chamber during
Netanyahu’s speech to Congress on Wednesday, Harris will travel to
Indianapolis, Indiana, to speak in front of the historically Black
sorority Zeta Phi Beta.</p>
<p>The optics of applauding Netanyahu would not fly well amid anger over
Gaza from progressives, Arab Americans and American Muslims who
traditionally vote for Democratic candidates. Dozens of congressional
Democrats in Congress are also expected to boycott the speech.</p>
<p>Gestures aside, a Harris presidency would unlikely yield a
significant change in Middle East policy, Carnegie’s Miller told VOA,
and would remain relatively “mainstream when it comes to supporting the
U.S.-Israeli relationship.”</p>
<p>But Harris would be “far tougher, certainly rhetorically, on Israeli
settlement activity, and much more, much more sympathetic to Palestinian
suffering and Palestinian rights,” he said.</p>
<p>Harris’ comments in office have been largely in line with Biden on
key foreign policy issues and it’s unclear whether she’ll manifest her
own doctrine if elected.</p>
<p>Compared to Biden, who has an extraordinarily clear, integrated and
well-thought-out American grand strategy, “she’s a blank slate, really,
on a foreign policy,” Rynhold said.</p>
<p>Netanyahu’s domestic goals</p>
<p>With the Israeli Knesset nearing a three-month recess, Netanyahu is
aiming to advance his own domestic political goals, and a cease-fire
deal could be the silver lining, Goren said.</p>
<p>“There may be a political timing that will enable Netanyahu to make a
move once the Knesset is in recess, without having that lead to
immediate coalition breakdown,” he said. “That could not be done until
the Knesset comes back to operation.”</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday that a deal was
within reach.</p>
<p>However, Goren and other analysts said they were skeptical the
cease-fire deal would extend beyond phase one: a six-week pause in
fighting in exchange for some of the hostages held by Hamas.</p>

id="missouri-judge-overturns-murder-conviction-of-man-imprisoned-more-than-30-years">Missouri
judge overturns murder conviction of man imprisoned more than 30
years</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>St. Louis — A Missouri judge on Monday overturned the conviction of
Christopher Dunn, who has spent more than 30 years in prison for a
killing he has long contended he didn’t commit.</p>
<p>The ruling is likely to free Dunn from prison, but it wasn’t
immediately clear when that would happen. He has been serving a sentence
of life without parole.</p>
<p>St. Louis Circuit Judge Jason Sengheiser’s ruling came several weeks
after he presided over a three-day hearing on Dunn’s fate.</p>
<p>Dunn, now 52, was convicted of first-degree murder in the 1990
shooting of 15-year-old Ricco Rogers. St. Louis Circuit Attorney Gabe
Gore filed a motion in February seeking to vacate the guilty verdict. A
hearing was in May.</p>
<p>Sengheiser, in his ruling, wrote that the “Circuit Attorney has made
a clear and convincing showing of ‘actual innocence’ that undermines the
basis for Dunn’s convictions because in light of new evidence, no juror,
acting reasonably, would have voted to find Dunn guilty of these crimes
beyond a reasonable doubt.”</p>
<p>Dunn’s attorney, Midwest Innocence Project Executive Director Tricia
Rojo Bushnell, said she was “overjoyed” by the judge’s ruling.</p>
<p>“Now, Chris looks forward to spending time with his wife and family
as a free man,” Bushnell said in a statement.</p>
<p>The Missouri Attorney General’s Office opposed the effort to vacate
Dunn’s conviction. Lawyers for the state said at the May hearing that
initial testimony from two boys at the scene who identified Dunn as the
shooter was correct, even though they later recanted as adults.</p>
<p>“That verdict was accurate, and that verdict should stand,” Assistant
Attorney General Tristin Estep said at the hearing.</p>
<p>Spokesperson Madeline Sieren said the Attorney General’s Office will
appeal.</p>
<p>The decision in Dunn’s case came days after Sandra Hemme was freed
from a western Missouri prison after serving 43 years for a murder that
a judge determined she didn’t commit. Bailey’s office also opposed
Hemme’s release.</p>
<p>A Missouri law adopted in 2021 lets prosecutors request hearings when
they see evidence of a wrongful conviction. While Bailey’s office is not
required to oppose such efforts, he also opposed another effort in
St. Louis that resulted in Lamar Johnson being freed last year after
serving 28 years for a murder case in which a judge ruled he was
wrongfully convicted.</p>
<p>Rogers was shot May 18, 1990, when a gunman opened fire while he was
with a group of other teenage boys outside a home. DeMorris Stepp, 14,
and Michael Davis Jr., 12, both initially identified Dunn as the
shooter.</p>
<p>In a recorded interview played at the hearing, Davis said he lied
because he thought Dunn was affiliated with a rival gang.</p>
<p>Stepp’s story has changed a few times over the years, Gore said at
the hearing. Most recently he has said he did not see Dunn as the
shooter. Gore said another judge previously found Stepp to be a
“completely unreliable witness” and urged Sengheiser to discount him
altogether.</p>
<p>Dunn has said he was at his mother’s home at the time of the
shooting. Childhood friend Nicole Bailey testified that she spoke with
him by phone that night and he was on a phone at his mother’s house.</p>
<p>Estep, the assistant attorney general, said that alibi could not be
trusted and Dunn’s story has shifted multiple times over the years. Dunn
did not testify at the hearing.</p>
<p>The 2021 law has resulted in the the release of two men who each
spent decades in prison. In addition to Johnson, Kevin Strickland was
freed in 2021 after more than 40 years for three killings in Kansas City
after a judge ruled he was wrongfully convicted in 1979.</p>
<p>Another hearing is next month for Marcellus Williams, who narrowly
escaped lethal injection and is now facing another execution date.</p>
<p>St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell filed a motion in
January to vacate the conviction of Williams, who was convicted in the
fatal stabbing of Lisha Gayle in 1998. Bell’s motion said three experts
determined that Williams’ DNA was not on the handle of the butcher knife
used in the killing.</p>
<p>Williams was hours from execution in 2017 when then-Gov. Eric
Greitens halted it and appointed a board of inquiry to examine his
innocence claim. The board never issued a ruling, and Gov. Mike Parson,
like Greitens a Republican, dissolved it last year.</p>
<p>The Missouri Supreme Court ruled this month that Parson had the
authority to dissolve the board and set a new execution date of
Sept. 24.</p>

continues to recover from COVID, stays out of public view after ending
campaign</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>REHOBOTH BEACH, Delaware — President Joe Biden’s “symptoms have
almost resolved completely” from COVID-19, according to his physician,
as the president on Monday remained out of public view for the fifth
straight day.</p>
<p>Biden called into the Wilmington, Delaware, headquarters of his
former campaign during a visit by Vice President Kamala Harris, whose
bid for the White House has been endorsed by Biden. The president sought
to pep up the staff, urging them to give “every bit” of their “heart and
soul” to Harris. Biden also vowed to be “out on the road” campaigning
for his vice president.</p>
<p>“If I didn’t have COVID, I’d be standing there with you,” said Biden,
whose voice sounded a touch gravelly.</p>
<p>The president was last seen in public late Wednesday after arriving
at a U.S. air base in Dover, Delaware, after testing positive for
COVID-19 while campaigning in Las Vegas earlier in the day. He then
motorcaded to his vacation home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware.</p>
<p>Biden’s physician, Dr. Kevin O’Connor, said that the president had
completed his 10th dose of the COVID-fighting medication Paxlovid on
Monday morning and continued to perform all of his presidential
duties.</p>
<p>“His symptoms have almost resolved completely. His pulse, blood
pressure, respiratory rate and temperature remain absolutely normal,”
O’Connor wrote. “His oxygen saturation continues to be excellent on room
air. His lungs remain clear.”</p>
<p>The White House said Biden received separate briefings on Monday from
homeland security adviser Liz Sherwood-Randall and national security
adviser Jake Sullivan. Both briefings were conducted virtually.</p>
<p>Biden’s public schedule for the week has remained clear as he
recovers from the virus, but he said in his letter on Sunday that he
planned to deliver an address to the nation this week to discuss his
decision to end his candidacy.</p>
<p>According to his official schedule, Biden is planning to return to
the White House on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Biden plans to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at
the White House this week, according to a person familiar with the
president’s schedule who was not authorized to comment publicly.</p>
<p>Biden also plans to meet at the White House later this week with the
families of Americans who are still being held hostage in Gaza,
according to a statement from the group of families who met privately
with Sullivan earlier Monday.</p>
<p>It would be the second time that Biden has met with the families. The
families again publicly urged Israel and Hamas to come to an agreement
on a cease-fire deal that would release their loved ones. Biden in late
May proposed a three-phased deal aimed at returning remaining hostages
taken by Hamas in the Oct. 7 attack on Israel and could potentially lead
to a permanent truce to end the nine-month war in Gaza.</p>
<p>“We’re going to keep working to an end to the war in Gaza,” Biden
said during his call-in to the campaign headquarters. “I’ll be working
really closely with the Israelis and with the Palestinians to try to
work out how we can get the Gaza war to end, and Middle East peace, and
get all those hostages home. I think we’re on the verge of being able to
do that.”</p>

id="observers-see-bidens-campaign-exit-having-no-impact-on-us-south-korea-ties">Observers
see Biden’s campaign exit having no impact on US-South Korea ties</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — U.S. President Joe Biden’s announcement that he was
dropping his reelection bid sparked reactions from former U.S. officials
who said Washington’s relations with Seoul are at a crossroads and will
either continue on the same path or make a sharp turn.</p>
<p>These officials, who dealt extensively with South Korea, said Biden’s
exit would have no immediate impact on Washington-Seoul ties.</p>
<p>“The U.S.-ROK alliance has never been stronger and more capable than
it is today, and that alliance will remain so until the end of President
Biden’s term next year,” said Evans Revere, who served as the principal
deputy assistant secretary and acting assistant secretary of state for
East Asia and Pacific affairs.</p>
<p>The Republic of Korea (ROK) is the official name for South Korea.</p>
<p>“Given that Biden will remain president for the next six months, I
see little change in U.S. foreign and national security policy and
posture over that time with either allies or adversaries, regardless of
whatever contingencies or provocations might arise, including on the
Korean Peninsula,” Robert Rapson, who served as deputy chief of mission
and charge d’affaires at the U.S. Embassy in Seoul from 2018 to 2021,
said in written comments.</p>
<p>Biden called off his bid for reelection Sunday amid mounting pressure
from top Democrats who cited his declining polling numbers since his
poor debate performance against former President Donald Trump last
month.</p>
<p>Biden said in a letter posted on his social media account X, formerly
Twitter, that he would focus the remainder of his term on presidential
duties and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic
nominee for president. He said he would speak more about his decision
later this week.</p>
<p>The South Korean Foreign Ministry sent a statement via email to VOA’s
Korean Service on Sunday that said Seoul “will continue to work closely
with the United States to maintain and develop the ROK-U.S. alliance,
which has been upgraded to a global comprehensive strategic
alliance.”</p>
<p>The office of South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said in a
statement Sunday that it “would not comment on domestic political
situations of any other countries.”</p>
<p>The statement continued, “Bipartisan support for the ROK-U.S.
alliance is rock solid. We will closely collaborate with the United
States to continuously strengthen the global comprehensive strategic
alliance between the Republic of Korea and the United States.”</p>
<p>Harris, if nominated by her party at the Democratic National
Convention next month, will face Trump, who secured the presidential
nomination at the Republican National Convention last week.</p>
<p>“If Trump wins, then yes, there could be big changes to the Nuclear
Consultative Group and U.S. attitudes toward North Korea and the ROK
nuclear program,” said Gary Samore, former White House coordinator for
arms control and WMD during the Obama administration.</p>
<p>“If Harris wins, I don’t think there’ll be big changes. I think
there’ll be continuity,” he said.</p>
<p>Dennis Wilder, senior director for East Asia at the White House’s
National Security Council during the George W. Bush administration, said
some changes are to be expected if the Republicans win. But “in the
Democratic Party, the views are quite set, and the views are very
positive on South Korea.”</p>
<p>Unlike Trump, who preferred personal engagement with North Korean
leader Kim Jong Un, Biden and Yoon have preferred strengthening their
defense against North Korea through mechanisms such as the Nuclear
Consultative Group.</p>
<p>The NCG is a bilateral body aimed at discussing joint nuclear
planning to strengthen deterrence against North Korea. The U.S. and
South Korean heads of the NCG signed nuclear deterrence and operations
guidelines on July 11 in Washington.</p>
<p>During their meeting on the sidelines of a NATO summit in Washington
the same day, Biden and Yoon referred to the guidelines as “the
advancement of U.S.-ROK security cooperation” since they announced the
Washington Declaration in April.</p>
<p>The Washington Declaration affirmed the U.S. use of nuclear weapons
to defend South Korea and Seoul’s commitment toward
nonproliferation.</p>
<p>Yoon touted Seoul-Washington ties as a “nuclear-based alliance” on
July 16 after returning home from Washington.</p>
<p>But a possible reelection of Trump, who had not discounted a U.S.
troop reduction in South Korea, has fueled already growing calls among
the South Korean public and some lawmakers for Seoul to develop its own
nuclear weapons as they became increasingly uncertain of the U.S.
defense commitment.</p>
<p>Harry Harris, former U.S. ambassador to South Korea during the Trump
administration, said, however, “Alliance[s] transcend individual
leaders.”</p>
<p>“I foresee no reduction in cooperation and coordination between the
U.S. and South Korea, in all aspects of our relationship and especially
in the combined military relationship,” he added.</p>

Secret Service chief admits to failure, will not resign</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The director of the U.S. agency charged with protecting
the country’s president and former presidents admitted to the “most
significant operational failure” in decades for the attempted
assassination of former President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>U.S. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle appeared before
lawmakers Monday, nine days after a 20-year-old man climbed a roof
adjacent to a Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, and fired multiple
shots, injuring the former president and two rally attendees and killing
another man.</p>
<p>“We failed,” Cheatle testified. “As director of the United States
Secret Service, I take full responsibility for any security lapse of our
agency.”</p>
<p>“I will move heaven and earth to make sure an incident like July 13
never happens again,” she added.</p>
<p>Cheatle said a full accounting by the agency of its own failures
would not be available for about 50 days, and repeatedly declined to
answer questions, citing the ongoing internal investigation.</p>
<p>She also raised the ire of both Republicans and Democrats on the
House Oversight Committee by refusing to resign.</p>
<p>“Because Donald Trump is alive, and thank God he is, you look
incompetent,” said Republican Representative Mike Turner, who also
chairs the House Intelligence Committee.</p>
<p>“If Donald Trump had been killed, you would have looked culpable,”
Turner added. “Not only should you resign, but if you refuse to do so,
President [Joe] Biden needs to fire you.”</p>
<p>Democrats on the committee were also incensed.</p>
<p>“This relationship is irretrievable,” said Oversight Committee
ranking member Representative Jamie Raskin, joining a formal call by the
committee’s chairman, Representative James Comer, for Cheatle to step
down.</p>
<p>“I think the director has lost the confidence of Congress at a very
urgent and tender moment,” Raskin said. “We need to very quickly move
beyond this.”</p>
<p>Cheatle defended her decision to stay on at the agency despite the
failure to protect former President Donald Trump from harm at the
Pennsylvania rally.</p>
<p>“Like every Secret Service agent, we don’t shirk our
responsibilities,” she said. “I will remain on and be responsible to the
agency, to this committee, to the former president and to the American
public.”</p>
<p>Details on precisely why a would-be assassin was able to get within
140 meters (150 yards) of Trump with a straight line of sight, however,
were scarce.</p>
<p>Cheatle did not provide answers on how the gunman, Thomas Matthew
Crooks, was able to climb the roof of a building adjacent to the Trump
rally on July 13 without being stopped, why Secret Service agents were
not positioned on the building, or why the rally was not stopped after
Crooks was identified as a suspicious person well before Trump took the
stage.</p>
<p>“Those are absolutely questions that we need to have answers to,” she
said.</p>
<p>During questioning, the Secret Service director confirmed reports
that Crooks was seen with a range finder, an optical device used to
measure distances, prior to the shooting. But, she said, “at a number of
our sites, especially when you’re at outdoor venues, a range finder is
not a prohibited item.”</p>
<p>She also said that while Crooks was identified as a suspicious
person, he was not characterized as a threat and that agents were not
aware he had a weapon.</p>
<p>“If the [protection] detail had been passed information that there
was a threat, the detail would never have brought the former president
out on to the stage,” she said.</p>
<p>The Secret Service director sought to refute some rumors and
conspiracy theories, saying the evidence suggests the shooter acted
alone.</p>
<p>Cheatle likewise dismissed media reports that requests from Trump’s
team for additional security had been denied.</p>
<p>“For the request in Butler, there were no requests that were denied,”
she said, while being questioned.</p>
<p>“A denial of a request does not equal a vulnerability,” she added.
“In generic terms, when [protection] details make a request, there are
times that there are alternate ways to cover off on that threat or that
risk.”</p>
<p>Monday’s hearing is just the first of several Congressional efforts
to examine how the Secret Service failed to prevent the attempted
assassination of former President Trump.</p>
<p>The director of the FBI, which is conducting its own investigation
into the attempted assassination, is set to appear Wednesday before the
House Judiciary Committee.</p>
<p>The Secret Service is responsible for protecting President Joe Biden,
Trump and 34 other individuals, as well as visiting foreign dignitaries,
Cheatle told lawmakers.</p>
<p>The agency has about 8,000 employees, including uniformed officers
and special agents. Cheatle said the goal is to hire another 1,000
people “in order to meet future and emerging needs.”</p>
<p>U.S. national security and law enforcement officials have been
warning for years that the country is facing a heightened threat
landscape.</p>
<p>Public assessments have warned the greatest threats come from lone
offenders or small groups, often driven by a variety of personal
grievances.</p>
<p>The most recent public assessment, issued this past September, also
warned attacks could be directed at “government officials, voters, and
elections-related personnel and infrastructure, including polling
places, ballot drop box locations, voter registration sites, campaign
events, political party offices, and vote counting sites.”</p>

<h2 id="a-brief-history-of-dell-unix">A brief history of Dell UNIX</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-22, from: OS News</p>
<p>“Dell UNIX? I didn’t know there was such a thing.” A couple of weeks
ago I had my new XO with me for breakfast at a nearby bakery café. Other
patrons were drawn to seeing an XO for the first time, including a Linux
person from Dell. I mentioned Dell UNIX and we talked a little about the
people who had worked on Dell UNIX. He expressed surprise that mention
of Dell UNIX evokes the above quote so often and pointed out that Emacs
source still has #ifdef for Dell UNIX. Quick Googling doesn’t reveal
useful history of Dell UNIX, so here’s my version, a summary of the
three major development releases. ↫ Charles H. Sauer I sure had never
heard of Dell UNIX, and despite the original version of the linked
article being very, very old – 2008 – there’s a few updates from 2020
and 2021 that add links to the files and instructions needed to install,
set up, and run Dell UNIX in a virtual machine; 86Box or VirtualBox
specifically. What was Dell UNIX? in the late ’80s, Dell started a the
Olympic project, an effort to create a completely new architecture
spanning desktops, workstations, and servers, some of which would be
using multiple processors. When searching for an operating system for
this project, the only real option was UNIX, and as such, the Olympic
team set out to developer a UNIX variant. The first version was based on
System V Release 3.2, used Motif and the X Window System, a DOS virtual
machine to run, well, DOS applications called Merge, and compatibility
with Microsoft Xenix. It might seem strange to us today, but Microsoft’s
Xenix was incredibly popular at the time, and compatibility with it was
a big deal. The Olympic project turned out to be too ambitious on the
hardware front so it got cancelled, but the Dell UNIX project continued
to be developed. The next release, Dell System V Release 4, was a
massive release, and included a full X Window System desktop environment
called X.desktop, an office suite, e-mail software, and a lot more. It
also contained something Windows wouldn’t be getting for quite a few
years to come: automatic configuration of device drivers. This was
apparently so successful, it reduced the number of support calls during
the first 90 days of availability by 90% compared to the previous
release. Dell SVR4 finally seemed like real UNIX on a PC. We were
justifiably proud of the quality and comprehensiveness, especially
considering that our team was so much smaller than those of our
perceived competitors at ISC, SCO and Sun(!). The reviewers were
impressed. Reportedly, Dell SVR4 was chosen by Intel as their reference
implementation in their test labs, chosen by Oracle as their reference
Intel UNIX implementation, and used by AT&amp;T USL for in house
projects requiring high reliability, in preference to their own ports of
SVR4.0. (One count showed Dell had resolved about 1800 problems in the
AT&amp;T source.) I was astonished one morning in the winter of 1991-92
when Ed Zander, at the time president of SunSoft, and three other
SunSoft executives arrived at my office, requesting Dell help with their
plans to put Solaris on X86. ↫ Charles H. Sauer Sadly, this would also
prove to be the last release of Dell UNIX. After a few more point
release, the brass at Dell had realised that Dell UNIX, intended to sell
Dell hardware, was mostly being sold to people running it on non-Dell
hardware, and after a short internal struggle, the entire project was
cancelled since it was costing them more than it was earning them. As I
noted, the article contains the files and instructions needed to run
Dell UNIX today, on a virtual machine. I’m definitely going to try that
out once I have some time, if only to take a peek at that X.desktop,
because that looks absolutely stunning for its time.</p>

Senate panel takes first step towards possible Menendez expulsion</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The U.S. Senate Ethics Committee told Senator Bob
Menendez, who was convicted of corruption last week, that it has taken
the first step of a review that could end in his expulsion, the heads of
the panel said on Monday.</p>
<p>“The Committee anticipates completing the adjudicatory review
promptly,” Democratic Chairman Chris Coons and Republican Vice Chairman
James Lankford said in the statement.</p>
<p>The senator’s office did not immediately respond to a request for
comment.</p>
<p>Menendez has remained defiant in the face of calls for his
resignation, including from the governor of New Jersey, his home state,
and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, after he was convicted on 16
criminal counts including bribery in federal court in New York.
Menendez, who has represented New Jersey in the U.S. Senate since 2006,
has said he will appeal the verdict.</p>
<p>Menendez and his wife accepted cash, gold bars and car and mortgage
payments as bribes from three businessmen in exchange for steering
billions of dollars in U.S. aid to Egypt, where one of the businessmen
had ties to government officials.</p>
<p>Menendez, a Democrat, is running for reelection as an independent.
His party has nominated U.S. Representative Andy Kim to fill his seat in
November.</p>

years of uncertainty, Google says it won’t be ‘deprecating third-party

<p>date: 2024-07-22, from: Ben Werdmuller’s blog</p>

<p>
[<a href="https://digiday.com/marketing/after-years-of-uncertainty-google-says-it-wont-be-deprecating-third-party-cookies-in-chrome/">Kayleigh
Barber and Seb Joseph at Digiday</a>]
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“After much back and forth, Google has decided to keep third-party
cookies in its Chrome browser. Turns out all the fuss over the years
wasn’t in vain after all; the ad industry’s cries have finally been
heard.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Advertisers are rejoicing. In other words: this is bad.
</p>
<p>
It’s possible that Chrome’s “new experience” that lets users make an
“informed choice” across their web browsing is really good. Sincerely,
though, I doubt it. Moving this to the realm of power user preferences
rather than a blanket policy for everyone means that very few people are
likely to use it.
</p>
<p>
The result is going to be a continued trend of tracking users across the
web. The people who really, really care will do the work to use the
interface; everyone else (including people who care about privacy!)
won’t have the time.
</p>
<p>
All this to help save the advertising industry. Which, forgive me,
doesn’t feel like an important goal to me.
</p>
<p>
Case in point: Chrome’s Privacy Sandbox isn’t actually going away, and
this is what Digiday has to say about it:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“This could be a blessing in disguise, especially if Google’s plan gets
Chrome users to opt out of third-party cookies. Since it’s all about
giving people a choice, if a bunch of users decide cookies aren’t for
them, the APIs in the sandbox might actually work for targeting them
without cookies.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
A “blessing in disguise” for advertisers does not read as an actual
blessing to me.

id="kenyans-say-biden-pulling-out-of-presidential-race-was-the-right-move">Kenyans
say Biden pulling out of presidential race was the right move</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Nairobi — Kenyans watching the U.S. presidential race say they agree
with President Joe Biden’s decision to not seek a second term. But some
say that choosing a replacement capable of defeating his opponent,
former president Donald Trump, is going to be a big task for the
Democratic Party.</p>
<p>On the streets of Nairobi, many people told VOA that while Joe
Biden’s decision to step out of the race must not have been easy, it was
the right decision for him to make.</p>
<p>James Owor said he was expecting Biden to step out of the race.</p>
<p>“A bit unsurprising just based on what I’ve seen in the news. He was
obviously not very well. It might not be such a bad idea to take a back
seat. He didn’t seem to have the energy he had,” he said.</p>
<p>Biden’s announcement Sunday followed a rising chorus within the
Democratic Party urging him to “pass the torch” amid his declining
national poll numbers and concerns raised by his shaky performance in
the debate against Trump last month.</p>
<p>Brenda Okwaro said what President Biden has done is commendable
because he put the needs of his country and party ahead of his need to
retain power.</p>
<p>“This is a move that should be emulated by our African presidents.
You don’t have to come to the race a second time and you know you are
not going to deliver the expectations of the people who elected you. But
if you feel you’ve done your best in your first term, you can just get
out of the race, go home and rest and focus on other things. You can
even give advice to people who are in leadership,” she said.</p>
<p>Africa is home to some of the longest-serving presidents in the
world, several of whom, like Biden, are in their 80s. Cameroon’s Paul
Biya is 91.</p>
<p>Martin Andati said he believes that if Biden had stayed in the race,
it would’ve been difficult for him to beat Republican nominee Donald
Trump.</p>
<p>“Biden had to drop out because all the odds are against him, he can’t
beat Trump. So, to salvage the image and give the Democratic Party an
opportunity, he had no choice but to exit the race,” he said.</p>
<p>President Biden’s announcement comes a little more than three months
before the U.S. elections. Andati said he believes the Democrats still
have a chance, but it all depends on who they pick to replace Biden, who
has endorsed his vice president, Kamala Harris.</p>
<p>“The only challenge is that he exited and endorsed Kamala Harris. The
numbers are not in favor of Kamala Harris. The question is do they
retain Harris or what happens, those are the issues the Democratic party
will have to grapple with,” he said.</p>
<p>Macharia Munene, a professor of history and international relations
at United States International University in Nairobi, said that while it
took Biden a little longer to drop out of the race, it was
expected. </p>
<p>“The signs were that he was not up to par, and it took time before
his friends and people he respects to come and tell him [it’s] in the
best interest of the country and himself, his own image was to step
aside so that he’s not embarrassed in November,” said Munene.</p>
<p>The friends who persuaded Biden to step aside reportedly included
Kenya’s favorite former U.S. president, Barack Obama. Obama is not
eligible for a comeback because of the two-term limit in the U.S.
Constitution.</p>
<p>Munene said he believes Democrats will nominate Harris.</p>
<p>“The question will be who’ll be her running mate in the hope they
will make a dent on Trump’s bandwagon. For Harris, it’s a good
opportunity if she does not win, she will not lose very badly. Then,
it’s a preparation for a future encounter in case she doesn’t make it,
she would’ve created a base for herself for the next time to run, maybe
in 2028,” said Munene.</p>
<p>Democratic lawmakers, governors and financial donors have already
expressed their support for Harris, who says she will work to earn the
trust and backing of democratic delegates. The party’s candidate will be
formally approved late next month when the party hosts its national
convention.</p>

<h2 id="us-supports-non-political-representation-by-myanmar-at-asean">US
supports non-political representation by Myanmar at ASEAN</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>State Department — A top State Department official says the United
States supports non-political representation by Myanmar, also known as
Burma, at this week’s Association of Southeast Asian Nations’ foreign
ministers’ meetings in Vientiane, Laos.  </p>
<p>This Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will head to
Asia to hold talks with ASEAN officials, including discussions on the
ongoing crisis in Burma. Officials say Washington also continues to
engage with the Burmese democratic opposition groups.</p>
<p>In a phone briefing on Monday, Daniel Kritenbrink, assistant
secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific affairs, told VOA that it
is his understanding that there will be a representative from Burma at
the meetings.</p>
<p>“It will be at the permanent secretary, non-political level,”
Kritenbrink said. “We believe that any Burmese representation in the
ASEAN meeting should be at a downgraded, non-political level, and that
is what you will see in this coming week.”</p>
<p>In January, Myanmar’s military junta sent a senior official to attend
an ASEAN foreign ministers’ retreat in Laos. Since it launched a coup in
2021 that ousted Myanmar’s democratically elected government, the junta
has been barred from sending political appointees to high-level meetings
of the Southeast Asian bloc.</p>
<p>Marlar Than Htaik, the permanent secretary of the foreign ministry
under the control of Myanmar’s junta, attended meetings earlier this
year on January 29.</p>
<p>Last week, more than 300 Burmese civil society organizations and
revolutionary forces endorsed a letter sent to ASEAN’s
secretary-general, Kao Kim Hourn, and other bloc officials.</p>
<p>The letter urged ASEAN to exclude Myanmar’s military junta members
from all meetings and events and to ensure Myanmar is represented by its
democratically elected leaders.</p>
<p>“We’ve spent probably even more time and effort in engaging the
democratic opposition, various Burmese related groups inside and outside
of Burma, and our commitment to those groups will continue going
forward,” Kritenbrink told VOA.</p>
<p>He added the U.S. will continue to implement “unprecedented sanctions
and other measures” to cut off the junta leaders’ ability to “acquire
the funds necessary to continue to prosecute the atrocities.”   </p>
<p>The U.S. also “strongly supports” the ASEAN five-point consensus on
ending the Myanmar crisis.</p>
<p>Shortly after the military coup began, the leaders of nine ASEAN
member states and the Myanmar junta chief, General Min Aung Hlaing,
agreed to an immediate end to violence in the country. They also agreed
to the appointment of a special envoy to visit Myanmar and to meet with
all parties and promote dialogue and humanitarian assistance from
ASEAN.</p>
<p>Despite those promises, the Southeast Asian bloc, has largely been
divided over the conflict in Myanmar, analysts say.  </p>
<p>“The most authoritarian members of ASEAN, which would be Laos and
Cambodia, to an extent, are still sticking with the junta,” Priscilla
Clapp, a senior adviser at the United States Institute of Peace, told
VOA.</p>
<p>Other members, including Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand,
have had some level of interaction with the Myanmar resistance.  </p>
<p>“I would say that none of the ASEAN countries really understands
fully what’s happening on the ground in Burma,” Clapp said in a recent
interview.  </p>
<p>She added that since ASEAN operates by consensus, achieving unanimity
when dealing with the junta is difficult, given the differences among
individual governments.</p>

<h2 id="trumps-suspicious-pivot-on-evs">Trump’s Suspicious Pivot on
EVs</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-22, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81Mjk1NzAwMS9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3MTU2MTg5Nn0.Kxx4nVfN-kbmrwuePrD3TS6uKWPVOwgnqsfnj-AIf0k/image.png?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
When former President Donald Trump addressed a crowd of non-union
autoworkers in Clinton Township, Michigan, last fall, he came with a
dire warning: “You’re going to lose your beautiful way of life.”
President Biden’s electric vehicle transition, Trump claimed, would be
“a transition to hell.”<br/>
</p>
<p>
Nearly 10 months later, Trump seems to have warmed up considerably to
the idea of that hell. Despite denouncing the electric vehicle
transition at countless interim rallies as a
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/trump-desantis-elon-musk-evs" target="_self"><u>woke</u></a>
and all-but-certain
“<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/18/climate/trump-electric-vehicles-blood-bath.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>bloodbath</u></a>”
for American automakers and making
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-electric-vehicles-fact-check#:~:text=EV%20drivers%20as%20a%20group%20tend%20to%20be%20pretty%20satisfied" target="_self"><u>endless
jokes about range</u></a> (including, admittedly,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-electric-vehicles-fact-check#:~:text=EV%20drivers%20as%20a%20group%20tend%20to%20be%20pretty%20satisfied" target="_self"><u>the
banger</u></a>: “The happiest moment for somebody in an electric car is
the first 10 minutes … The unhappiest part is the next hour because
you’re petrified that you’re not going to be finding another charger”),
Trump’s tone on EVs has considerably softened in the past several weeks.
</p>
<p>
“I have no objection to the electric vehicle — the EV. I think it’s
great,” Trump
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-07-17/donald-trump-has-electric-and-imported-cars-on-his-mind" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>told
</u><u><em><em>Bloomberg</em></em></u></a> earlier this month, shortly
after
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/biden-trump-debate-climate-change" target="_self"><u>promising</u></a>
to end Biden’s nonexistent EV mandate on “day one” in office. His
improved mood still came with caveats (“They don’t go far enough;
they’re very, very expensive; they’re also heavy”) but it seemed to be
part of a larger trend. “I’m totally for [electric cars], whatever the
market says,” Trump
<a href="https://x.com/ccadelago/status/1814794241857761389" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>followed
up</u></a> with a crowd in Grand Rapids, Michigan, over the weekend.
“And if it’s 10% of the market, 12%, 7%, 20% — whatever it is, it’s
okay.”
</p>
<p>
Some of this fluctuation is normal for Trump. As Patrick George
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/trump-desantis-elon-musk-evs" target="_self"><u>has
written for Heatmap</u></a>, the former president’s “knowledge of the
workings of the auto industry is suspect on a good day”; when in office,
Trump even
<a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/173989/fallout-trumps-failed-flirtation-electric-vehicles" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>hyped</u></a>
the now-defunct EV manufacturer Lordstown Motors.
</p>
<p>
But you don’t have to look too far for the answers to, <em><em>Why this
particular flip-flop? </em></em>and<em><em> Why now? </em></em>Trump
told us himself when he was in Arizona last month: “I’m a big fan of
electric cars,” he said. “I’m a fan of Elon — I like Elon.” That is,
Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, the country’s biggest EV maker.
</p>
<p>
Bemused Tesla shareholders asked Musk about Trump’s change of heart on
EVs, to which the CEO
<a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/elon-musk-tesla-ev-trump-488336b5" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reportedly</u></a>
quipped, “I can be persuasive.” Trump’s new tune comes amid reports that
the Tesla CEO
<a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/elon-musk-has-said-he-is-committing-around-45-million-a-month-to-a-new-pro-trump-super-pac-dda53823" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>pledged</u></a>
to give a new pro-Trump super PAC $45 million monthly through November.
Trump isn’t even shy about hiding this link; in the same speech he
claimed to be “totally for” EVs, he also
<a href="https://youtu.be/bFD6MvIHdyI" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>bragged</u></a>
about the size of Musk’s donation.
</p>
<p>
Tesla shares
<a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/trump-musk-tesla-ev-stocks-157932c9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>popped
4%</u></a> after Trump’s most recent comments, and the company is now
big enough
<a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1813112958157005259" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>not
to need the government subsidies</u></a> that Trump would inevitably
roll back. (Of course, it’s a different story for Tesla’s rivals.)
</p>
<p>
It’s not just that Trump’s support of EVs evidently has a price tag.
It’s the unspoken suggestion of what <em><em>other</em></em> industry
interests might be able to buy. You can bet fossil fuel executives
haven’t missed the message — Trump has reportedly even
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/05/09/trump-oil-industry-campaign-money/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>pitched
policy priorities</u></a> like expanding oil drilling leases,
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/04/17/trump-wind-power-oil-executives/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>threatening
offshore wind</u></a>, and undoing Biden’s protections for the Arctic
behind closed doors with would-be oil and gas donors.
</p>
<p>
Voters usually want conviction and vision from their politicians—not
someone
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/05/09/trump-oil-industry-campaign-money/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>taking
best offers from the rich</u></a>. But this is
<a href="https://x.com/ItsMattsLaw/status/1796288760327307418" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>no
ordinary election</u></a>. Besides, there are still plenty of weeks to
go until November. That’s plenty of time to change a mind.

<h2 id="mismatch">Mismatch</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-22, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;My current life situation is not great. For a variety of reasons that aren&#39;t worth listing here. It&#39;s not like everything&#39;s bad. Some aspects of my life are great. But overall, I&#39;d not say I&#39;m in a happy place. Which is fine, or at least it would be fine if the root cause of the problem was known. Because when you know the cause of a problem you can work towards a solution. But up until the other day, I didn&#39;t know why I was feeling this way. And when you&#39;re in that situation, you feel hopeless and you can see things slowly spiralling out of control. But the other day, I had a realisation: a mismatch. That&#39;s why I feel this way. I realised that there&#39;s a mismatch between the way I see myself, the way I perceive myself as a person, and who I actually am. And that mismatch is driving me insane. There are things I know about myself, or at least I think I know about myself, that are important to me. And those things should play a role in the way I live my life. And yet because of this stupid mismatch, those things weren&#39;t playing a role and were superseded by other things I absolutely despise. And this mismatch manifests in subtle ways.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
I am a morning person. I know it. I experimented with it and I know for
a fact that I’m happier, more productive and live a better life when I
wake up early. Not once, when up early, I thought “Why am I already
awake? Shouldn’t I be sleeping?”. That’s just not a thought I have
because I know how much more I enjoy life when I’m up early. But late at
night? That’s a constant thought. I’m sitting there, reading something
online and I constantly think “Why am I here reading this? I should be
sleeping”. And in doing that, in staying up late, the mismatch gathers
strength. It’s a vicious cycle.
</p>
<p>
That’s one example but I’m realising that this is the source of all my
struggles. And it’s not much the fact that I am not the person I’d love
to be—or that I think I am—but the fact that I don’t do the things that
I should be doing in order to become that person. And it fucking sucks.
It sucks because I know that’s going to be incredibly hard to correct
that but at the same time I’m glad that at least now I know where the
problem is and I can work towards a solution.

<p class="drop-caps">
While the Northeast might start breathing more easily this week, the
heat will intensify again in the West. Keep reading to discover what
sweltering lies in store.
</p>
<h3>
The Pacific Northwest takes its turn in the hot seat
</h3>
<p>
The weekend brough intense heat to the Northwest, with many cities
inching close to their all-time temperature records. <strong>While the
potential for record-breaking heat is set to decrease throughout the
week, temperatures in the region will remain above average</strong>, Bob
Oravec, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service, told me.
Cities like Spokane, Washington and Boise, Idaho will continue to see
triple-digit temperatures until at least Wednesday. In fact, on
Thursday, Boise might see its 10th day in a row above 100 degrees,
breaking the city’s record.
</p>
<p>
The region also struggled this weekend — and will continue to struggle
this summer — with increased wildfire activity. On Saturday, residents
of Baker County had to evacuate as a fire spread to residential areas.
As of yesterday, Oregon’s firefighters were dealing with
<a href="https://www.kgw.com/article/news/local/wildfire/oregon-81-active-fires-burning-weekend/283-7b6d4429-503c-4041-9089-952fa7076bf5" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>81
active fires</u></a>, burning through over 500,000 acres of the state.
This week, a high pressure area combined with moisture coming from the
Pacific Ocean may contribute to thunderstorms — but not enough
precipitation to break the dry conditions in the region. The pattern
will increase the likelihood of wildfires, as lighting might spark
blazes.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Looking Ahead: </strong>While the Northwest will experience
lower temperatures near the end of the week, conditions will remain
scorching. The brief respite comes with bad news for cities a little to
the right on the map as the heat shifts eastward. Populations in
Colorado, Montana, Wyoming, and others in the region will be the next
ones to live through 100-plus degrees.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Relief is on the way for the mid-Atlantic
</h3>
<p>
All across the East Coast temperatures shattered records last week. On
July 16, thermometers in Washington, D.C. reached
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/07/16/dc-heat-100-record-high-temperatures/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>104
degrees</u></a> for just the 13th time in history. The next day the
District capped off a run of four days with temperatures above 101
degrees, setting — you guessed it —
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/07/19/dc-record-hot-summer/#:~:text=Days%20reaching%20at%20least%2090%20degrees%20in%20Washington%20during%202024&text=29%20days%20at%2090%20degrees,second%2Dmost%20behind%202012's%2012." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
new record</u></a>. And that was just the heat — factoring in humidity,
the weather felt more like 108 degrees at its hottest.
</p>
<p>
In Maryland, summer camps had to move activities indoors for the
campers’ safety. Last Monday, only 75 children
<a href="https://www.wbaltv.com/article/summer-camps-pivoting-activities-high-temperatures-across-state-baltimore/61602254" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>attended</u></a>
the Horizon Day Camp in Baltimore County. Usually there are around 200
campers.
</p>
<p>
The heat wave also brought back transit issues across the region.
Commuters in the D.C. area and in New York
<a href="https://www.livemint.com/news/world/new-york-heat-wave-commuters-face-fresh-woes-as-extreme-temperatures-lead-to-train-cancellations-11721180313371.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>struggled</u></a>
through train cancellations and delays.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Looking Ahead: Thankfully, more agreeable temperatures are in
store for this week.</strong> “On any given day, the temperatures might
be one or two degrees above average or below average,” Oravec told me.
He added that other regions of the country will also get a break this
week. Parts of the Central and Southern Plains will see below average
temperatures, he told me.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Arizona is investigating hundreds of heat-related deaths, with no end in
sight
</h3>
<p>
In Arizona County alone, more than 300 deaths are being linked to
record-breaking heat, NBC News reported on Thursday. Also, 23 deaths in
the county have been confirmed to have been caused by heat or
heat-related complications — and those numbers are up to date only
through July 13, meaning they don’t include last week’s heat. But unlike
other parts of the country, <strong>the Southwest will continue to broil
this week.</strong>
</p>
<p>
“Highs will be closer to historical averages in Phoenix next week, but
still above 110 in Las Vegas most days, which could challenge some daily
records again later next week,” Dan Pydynowski, senior meteorologist at
AccuWeather, told me.
</p>
<h3>
The West will get the worst
</h3>
<p>
Sorry, California. According to Oravec, for at least the month of
August, most of the extreme heat in the U.S. will remain concentrated in
the West. That’s not the worst of it, even — conditions will also be
very dry. “There’s really not a very good chance of rain across the
West, especially across parts of the Northwest and the Great Basin where
there’s going to be a lot of record high temperatures,” Oravec told me.
<strong>When hot and dry conditions occur together, that means
</strong><a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/is-extreme-weather-climate-change" target="_self"><u><strong>wildfires</strong></u></a><strong>.
</strong>
</p>
<p>
On the bright side, <em><em>CNET</em></em>
<a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/energy-and-utilities/during-historic-california-heat-wave-a-hero-emerged-giant-solar-powered-batteries/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reported</u></a>
that California’s investment in solar-powered batteries might have kept
the state’s lights on during a heat wave that lasted through July 12.
The batteries provided an additional 10,000 megawatts of power.

<strong>Looking Ahead: </strong>Another scorching heat wave started to
make its way to California on Thursday, and the extreme temperatures are
set to continue. <strong>Up through the middle of the week, Northern
California can expect consecutive days with temperatures in the triple
digits. </strong>“The interior of California and the Intermountain West
could once again challenge some daily record highs. For example, Fresno,
California will have highs near 110 degrees F from Monday through
Wednesday, which can challenge records those days,” Pydynowski told me.
Still, the worst may be behind them — this new wave likely won’t be as
intense as the one Californians just went through, he said..<strong>

Tourists’ favorite European countries bake in the heat

<p>
Sweltering heat continues to spread across Europe. Early last week,
Italy placed several cities under its most severe heat alert. The
country also reported an increased number of wildfires —

</p>
<p>
That said, most of the extreme heat hitting the region seems to be in
the past now. “If we are looking for extreme heat, chances of that being
widespread across Italy to Ukraine looks to be on the low side for the
rest of the summer,” Pydynowski told me. In the second half of August,
temperatures might return to the high 90s for a while, at least.
</p>

<strong>In Greece, authorities

tourists and workers from extreme temperatures. </strong>Earlier in the
day, before the closure, Red Cross volunteers were distributing bottled

seawater for drinking and banning the refilling of swimming pools. Next

of American who died in Syria files lawsuit against Assad regime</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The family of an American doctor who died while being
held in Syria filed a lawsuit Monday against the Syrian government,
accusing it of wrongful death and false imprisonment. </p>
<p>Majd Kamalmaz, a Syrian-born American psychotherapist, was treating
refugees from war-torn Syria during the time of his abduction. U.S.
officials said he was last seen in 2017 at a checkpoint manned by forces
loyal to the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in Damascus
where he was visiting a family member.  </p>
<p>His family received official confirmation of his death from the U.S.
government in May. </p>
<p>“Today, on behalf of the Kamalmaz family, we have taken just the
first step towards holding the Syrian regime accountable for its crimes
against Majd Kamalmaz which culminated in his murder,” Kirby Behre, a
lawyer representing the Kamalmaz family, said Monday in a
statement.   </p>
<p>The lawsuit was filed in a U.S. District Court in Washington, under
the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act’s “state sponsor of terrorism”
exception, seeking compensatory damages for wrongful death, assault and
battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and false
imprisonment. The plaintiffs also seek punitive damages, bringing the
total claim to at least $70 million, according to the 19-page court
complaint.  </p>
<p>Maryam Kamalmaz, the daughter of Majd Kamalmaz and one of the
plaintiffs in the lawsuit, says she hopes this legal action will help
raise awareness about other cases that are like her father’s. </p>
<p>“There are hundreds of thousands of Syrians who have gone through
this,” she told VOA in a phone interview. “I’m just hopeful it raises
awareness about those people who are being killed at the hands of the
Syrian government. Those innocent people never get a trial. They are
being tortured and killed for no reason.” </p>
<p>Since the beginning of Syria’s conflict in 2011, more than 350,000
civilians have been killed and more than 13.5 million people have been
displaced at home and abroad, according to the United Nations. </p>
<p>The U.N. Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the
Syrian Arab Republic  </p>
<p>said in a report in early July that 155,000 Syrians have been
detained or forcibly disappeared since 2011. Rights groups blame the
Syrian regime for most of the cases. </p>
<p>“We support Majd’s family and the families of all those who are
missing or unjustly detained in Syria in their quest for
accountability,” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a
statement in June. </p>
<p>“Even as we pay tribute to Majd today, we will keep fighting for all
Americans held hostage or wrongfully detained abroad,” he said. </p>
<p>Kamalmaz is one of several Americans who have disappeared in Syria,
including journalist Austin Tice, who went missing in 2012 at a
checkpoint near Damascus. The Syrian government denies kidnapping or
holding Americans in its territories. </p>
<p>“We will not stop at filing a civil case,” said Mouaz Moustafa,
executive director of the Syrian Emergency Task Force, a
Washington-based advocacy group that has been involved in the case. </p>
<p>“There needs to be a criminal investigation and a criminal case
against the Assad regime for the torture and murder of Majd Kamalmaz,”
he told VOA. </p>
<p>Moustafa said his group was ready to cooperate with U.S. government
agencies to provide documentation, witness statements and evidence to
support a criminal case against Syrian government officials.  </p>
<p>Lawyer Behre said the Kamalmaz family too “is counting on the U.S.
government to initiate criminal charges against Syria.” </p>
<p>Last week, U.S. authorities announced the arrest of a former Syrian
military official who oversaw a prison where alleged torture and abuse
routinely took place. Samir Ousman al-Sheikh was taken into custody at
Los Angeles International Airport, according to the U.S. Department of
Homeland Security. </p>
<p>Moustafa said his organization alerted several federal agencies about
al-Sheikh and worked with them to build a case against him. </p>
<p>As a humanitarian worker, Maryam Kamalmaz said her father had
dedicated his life to helping those in need. He had worked with
survivors of the 2005 Hurricane Katrina, victims of the 2004 tsunami in
Indonesia, and the Bosnian genocide in the 1990s. </p>
<p>“My father had a big heart who cared for everybody and wanted the
best for everyone,” she said. “It’s been very hard without him and it’s
a big loss to have him gone this way.”</p>

<p>date: 2024-07-22, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
Kamala Harris quickly rang up endorsements from Democratic elected
officials and convention delegates Sunday afternoon after President Joe
Biden ended his re-election campaign, making Vice President Harris the
likeliest Democratic nominee for the presidency of the United States.
Many of these plaudits came from figures in the climate policy space,
but few were quite as vociferous as the one from Gina McCarthy, a
director of the Environmental Protection Agency under President Obama
and White House climate advisor under Biden.
</p>
<p>
“Vice President Harris would kick ass against Trump,” she said in a
statement. “She has spent her whole life committed to justice, fighting
for the underdog, and making sure that no one is above the law. She will
fight every day for all Americans to have access to clean air, clean
water, and a healthy environment.”
</p>
<p>
When Harris has had the chance to formulate climate action on her own —
as the attorney general of California, as a U.S. senator, as a candidate
for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020 — it has tended to be
aggressive in its timelines for decarbonization and heavily focused on
the harms that fossil fuel extraction and processing inflict on
marginalized communities.
</p>
<p>
As vice president, however, she has been subsumed into the rollout of
both the Inflation Reduction Act and the Infrastructure Investment and
Jobs Act. In some cases, the programs she’s pitched and praised have an
organic connection to her own personal policy work — a grant program for
electric school buses, for instance, the launch of which was the source
of one of her more
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/vp-harris-who-doesnt-love-a-yellow-school-bus/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>enduring
Kamala-isms:</u></a> “Who doesn’t love a yellow school bus?”
</p>
<p>
Assuming she wins the party’s nomination and then, finally, the White
House, a Kamala Harris climate agenda would no doubt
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/replace-biden-climate" target="_self"><u>look
much like Biden’s</u></a>. To people who’ve been paying attention all
along, however, there’s no reason to think she couldn’t push the country
even more zealously toward decarbonizing.
</p>
<p>
For one, there’s the historical record. Harris not only endorsed Green
New Deal legislation in 2019, she also put out a climate plan during her
campaign that included $10 trillion of public and private spending and
called for reaching net-zero by 2045, achieving a carbon neutral
electric grid by 2030, no new fossil fuel leasing on public lands, and a
carbon pollution fee. While expansive, Harris’s plan was not the work of
someone like Jay Inslee, who has legislated on climate for years, or
Bernie Sanders, who was willing to simply outbid his fellow candidates
on progressive policy, but her climate policy was the process of
consulting with climate activists. In fact, her team had reached out to
Inslee’s after he dropped out for advice on climate, Jamal Raad,
Inslee’s campaign communications director, told me.<br/><br/>“If we jump
in the Wayback Machine, [Harris] was one of the most ambitious
presidential candidates in the 2020 primary cycle,” Justin Guay, program
director at Quadrature Climate Foundation, told me. “She had the largest
proposed spending plan of any candidate not named Bernie. She promised a
sum 10 times that of the greatest climate president we’ve ever had, Joe
Biden.” Importantly, he added, she focused on “sticks, not just
carrots,” including
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-22/kamala-harris-seen-as-tougher-oil-industry-opponent-than-joe-biden" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>investigating
and bringing lawsuits against fossil fuel companies</u></a>, as she’d
done in California. This, he said, is “red meat for the climate base.”
</p>
<p>
Where she did stand out in the Senate, on the campaign trail, and in the
Biden administration was in her focus on environmental justice, an issue
combining green politics and racial justice that she used to reach out
to the party’s left wing. By the time the she was picked to be President
Biden’s vice presidential nominee, she had won the praise of both the
youth-led Sunrise Movement (which has since
<a href="https://x.com/sunrisemvmt/status/1779703884786577833" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>protested
outside her Southern California</u></a> home and notably
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/12/climate/biden-sunrise-movement.html" target="_blank">withheld
its support</a> from Biden during his reelection campaign) and Evergreen
Action, a climate policy group built by former Inslee staffers. “She
made environmental justice central to her climate plans on the
presidential campaign,” said Raad, an Evergreen Action cofounder.
</p>
<p>
In the summer of 2019, she joined up with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on
<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/8019" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
bill</u></a> that would have required all climate-related legislation to
undergo a review of its effect on “frontline communities,” those living
adjacent to energy-related facilities, which tend to be
disproportionately populated by poor people of color, and created
offices of climate equity within the Congressional Budget Office and the
Office of Management and Budget.
</p>
<p>
While this particular piece of legislation went nowhere, the motivating
ideas have been all over the Biden-Harris White House’s policy agenda —
in tax benefits directed toward projects in “energy communities;” in the
Justice40 Initiative, which aims to direct 40% of climate and related
spending to flow
<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/environmentaljustice/justice40/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>toward
disadvantaged communities</u></a>; and in the Greenhouse Gas Reduction
Fund, a.k.a. “green banks,” aimed at making climate-friendly investing
more affordable.
</p>
<p>
That’s all great, Raad told me. But he also added, “What’s more relevant
has been how central she’s made climate in her vice presidency as one of
her top priorities.” Harris reached out to Raad and others in the run-up
to the IRA’s passage, he said. “She held a town hall. She barnstormed
the country. As far as folks wanting further momentum in the next
presidency, that’s the more relevant development — that she wanted to be
associated with climate action.”
</p>
<p>
Whatever her policy priorities as president, they would have to fit
between the lines of what would be, at best, narrow majorities in both
chambers of Congress, limited by the filibuster and reconciliation
process, along with large policy shifts that any new administration will
have to deal with, such as the expiration of key portions of the 2017
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2025. It will be a far distance from the heady
days of the 2020 Democratic primary campaign, when Harris eagerly
participated in a bidding war between the candidates for the most
aggressive and expansive climate program — less Frank Capra, more Alan
J. Pakula.
</p>
<p>
“The reality is that the climate movement should focus as much, if not
more, on creating the conditions that force politicians to act on
climate as we do pushing for candidates with a hawkish climate policy
platform to begin with,” Guay told me. “That was the greatest lesson
from the Joe Biden era. He was no climate hawk when he entered the 2020
primaries,” but thanks to decades of unrelenting pressure and calls for
more policy ambition, “he emerged the most powerful climate president
we’ve ever had.”
</p>
<p>
Raad, too, emphasized the importance of realpolitik at this point in
history. Having a president willing to put herself on the line for
climate policy is important — “even if we don’t get major legislation
done,” he told me. “We need to make sure the IRA is implemented
effectively in the fullest way possible. We need a very careful eye
towards writing regulations that are as effective as possible so they’re
not getting overturned by Federalist Society judges.” Getting money out
the door will be key, he said, “and that’s why we need an advocate in
the White House.”

“ChatGPT doesn’t summarise. When you ask ChatGPT to summarise this text,
it instead shortens the text. And there is a fundamental difference
between the two.”

<p>
The distinction is indeed important: it’s akin to making an easy reader
version, albeit one with the odd error here and there.
</p>
<p>
This is particularly important for newsrooms and product teams that are
looking at AI to generate takeaways from articles. There’s a huge chance
that it’ll miss the main, most pertinent points, and simply shorten the
text in the way it sees fit.

security talks on July 28</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>TOKYO — Foreign and defense ministers from Japan and the United
States will hold security talks in Japan on July 28 in an effort to push
forward what U.S. President Joe Biden called a historic upgrade in the
alliance.</p>
<p>The so-called “2+2” talks will cover extended deterrence, a term used
to describe the U.S. commitment to use its nuclear and conventional
forces to deter attacks on allies, Japan’s foreign ministry said on
Monday.</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will also hold a bilateral
meeting with his Japanese counterpart Yoko Kamikawa during the visit,
while U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin will hold three-way talks with
his counterparts from Japan and South Korea.</p>
<p>Tokyo and Washington in April announced a series of initiatives to
strengthen their ties in what Biden called the most significant upgrade
since the U.S.-Japan alliance, which was first signed in 1951,
began.</p>
<p>These include efforts to deepen cooperation between defense
industries and upgrade military command structures to improve
coordination, as both countries look to deter regional threats they see
emanating from China, North Korea and Russia.</p>
<p>“These historic 2+2 talks will cement our shift from a focus on
Alliance protection to one of Alliance projection,” U.S. ambassador to
Japan Rahm Emanuel said.</p>
<p>“Through a transformation of the command structure of the United
States forces in Japan, aligned with Japan’s own groundbreaking launch
of its joint command next March, the Alliance will be ready and equipped
to respond to the security challenges of the Indo-Pacific for decades to
come.”</p>

deaths in Texas climb after hurricane left millions without power</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Spring, Texas — As the temperature soared in the Houston-area home
Janet Jarrett shared with her sister after losing electricity in
Hurricane Beryl, she did everything she could to keep her 64-year-old
sibling cool.</p>
<p>But on their fourth day without power, she awoke to hear Pamela
Jarrett, who used a wheelchair and relied on a feeding tube, gasping for
breath. Paramedics were called but she was pronounced dead at the
hospital, with the medical examiner saying her death was caused by the
heat.</p>
<p>“It’s so hard to know that she’s gone right now because this wasn’t
supposed to happen to her,” Janet Jarrett said.</p>
<p>Almost two weeks after Beryl hit, heat-related deaths during the
prolonged power outages have pushed the number of storm-related
fatalities to at least 23 in Texas.</p>
<p>The combination of searing summer heat and residents unable to power
up air conditioning in the days after the Category 1 storm made landfall
on July 8 resulted in increasingly dangerous conditions for some in
America’s fourth-largest city.</p>
<p>Beryl knocked out electricity to nearly 3 million homes and
businesses at the height of the outages, which lasted days or much
longer, and hospitals reported a spike in heat-related illnesses.</p>
<p>Power finally was restored to most by last week, after over a week of
widespread outages. The slow pace in the Houston area put the region’s
electric provider, CenterPoint Energy, under mounting scrutiny over
whether it was sufficiently prepared.</p>
<p>While it may be weeks or even years before the full human toll of the
storm in Texas is known, understanding that number helps plan for the
future, experts say.</p>
<p>What is known about the deaths so far?</p>
<p>Just after the storm hit, bringing high winds and flooding, the
deaths included people killed by falling trees and people who drowned
when their vehicles became submerged in floodwaters. In the days after
the storm passed, deaths included people who fell while cutting limbs on
damaged trees and heat-related deaths.</p>
<p>Half of the deaths attributed to the storm in Harris County, where
Houston is located, were heat related, according to the Harris County
Institute of Forensic Sciences.</p>
<p>Jarrett, who has cared for her sister since she was injured in an
attack six years ago, said her “sassy” sister had done everything from
owning a vintage shop in Harlem, New York, to working as an artist.</p>
<p>“She had a big personality,” Jarrett said, adding that her sister had
been in good health before they lost electricity at their Spring
home.</p>
<p>When will a complete death toll be known?</p>
<p>With power outages and cleanup efforts still ongoing, the death toll
likely will continue to climb.</p>
<p>Officials are still working to determine if some deaths that have
already occurred should be considered storm related. But even when those
numbers come in, getting a clear picture of the storm’s toll could take
much more time.</p>
<p>Lara Anton, a spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health
Services, which uses death certificate data to identify storm-related
deaths, estimated that it may not be until the end of July before they
have even a preliminary count.</p>
<p>In the state’s vital statistics system, there is a prompt to indicate
if the death was storm related and medical certifiers are asked to send
additional information on how the death was related to the storm, Anton
said.</p>
<p>Experts say that while a count of storm-related fatalities compiled
from death certificates is useful, an analysis of excess deaths that
occurred during and after the storm can give a more complete picture of
the toll. For that, researchers compare the number of people who died in
that period to how many would have been expected to die under normal
conditions.</p>
<p>The excess death analysis helps count deaths that might have been
overlooked, said Dr. Lynn Goldman, dean of the Milken Institute School
of Public Health at George Washington University.</p>
<p>What do different toll numbers tell us?</p>
<p>Both the approach of counting the death certificates and calculating
the excess deaths have their own benefits when it comes to storms, said
Gregory Wellenius, director of the Boston University School of Public
Health’s Center for Climate and Health.</p>
<p>The excess death analysis gives a better estimate of the total number
of people killed, so it’s useful for public health and emergency
management planning in addition to assessing the impact of climate
change, he said.</p>
<p>But it “doesn’t tell you who,” he said, and understanding the
individual circumstances of storm deaths is important in helping to show
what puts individual people at risk.</p>
<p>“If I just tell you 200 people died, it doesn’t tell you that story
of what went wrong for these people, which teaches us something about
what hopefully can we do better to prepare or help people prepare in the
future,” Wellenius said.</p>

<p>
President Biden announced yesterday he will not run for re-election and
endorsed his vice president, Kamala Harris, for the 2024 Democratic
ticket. Tributes from his colleagues poured in quickly, with many
hailing Biden’s decision as brave and patriotic, and others recounting
his accomplishments during three-and-a-half years in office, including
his climate record. “Biden will leave office with easily the strongest
climate record of any president — and one of the stronger environmental
records, generally, in decades,”

Heatmap’s Robinson Meyer</a>. Biden signed the largest investment in
clean energy and decarbonization in American history, oversaw a
revitalization of American industrial strategy, passed the bipartisan
infrastructure law and CHIPS and Science Act (both of which funded or
expanded climate-friendly programs), and moved quickly to regulate
greenhouse gas emissions using executive authority. “Democrats had tried
and failed for 30 years to pass a climate law through the Senate,” Meyer
said. “Biden succeeded.”

her own climate agenda as a presidential candidate in 2019 was more
ambitious even than Biden’s. She called for a carbon tax, a ban on
fracking and fossil fuel leases on public lands, and $10 trillion in
spending to curb greenhouse gas emissions. She also was an early
co-sponsor of the Green New Deal. She supported a pollution fee, a
crackdown on fossil fuel companies, and as a top attorney in California,

id="israels-netanyahu-walks-political-tightrope-on-washington-trip-following-bidens-exit-from-race">Israel’s
Netanyahu walks political tightrope on Washington trip following Biden’s
exit from race</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Jerusalem — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu left for
Washington on Monday, leaving behind a brutal war to make a politically
precarious speech before the U.S. Congress at a time of great
uncertainty following Joe Biden’s withdrawal from the presidential
race.</p>
<p>With efforts ongoing to bring about a cease-fire between Israel and
Hamas, rising concerns about the war spreading to Lebanon and Yemen, and
the U.S. in the midst of a dizzying election campaign, Netanyahu’s
speech has the potential to cause disarray on both sides of the
ocean.</p>
<p>The risks only increased with Biden’s decision Sunday to drop out of
the race for president, especially since the choice of a replacement
Democratic nominee — and the potential next American leader — are still
up in the air.</p>
<p>Before stepping on the plane, Netanyahu said he would emphasize the
theme of Israel’s bipartisanship in his speech and said Israel would
remain America’s key ally in the Middle East “regardless who the
American people choose as their next president.”</p>
<p>“In this time of war and uncertainty, it’s important that Israel’s
enemies know that America and Israel stand together,” he said, adding
that he will meet Biden during his trip and thank him for his support
for Israel.</p>
<p>A person familiar with Biden’s schedule confirmed Sunday that the
president will host Netanyahu at the White House. The official, speaking
on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment
publicly, said the exact timing of the meeting has not been established
because Biden is recovering from COVID-19.</p>
<p>Netanyahu is scheduled to address Congress on Wednesday. He is also
expected to meet with Vice President Kamala Harris, who is seeking the
Democratic Party’s presidential nomination.</p>
<p>Netanyahu will deliver his congressional address with an eye on
several audiences: his ultranationalist governing partners, the key to
his political survival; the Biden administration, which Netanyahu counts
on for diplomatic and military support; and Donald Trump’s Republican
Party, which could offer Netanyahu a reset in relations if he is
reelected in November.</p>
<p>His words risk angering any one of those constituencies, which the
Israeli leader cannot afford if he hopes to hold on to his tenuous grip
on power.</p>
<p>“There are a few land mines and pitfalls on this trip,” Eytan Gilboa,
an expert on U.S.-Israel relations at Israel’s Bar-Ilan University, said
before Biden’s withdrawal. “He is thought of as a political wizard who
knows how to escape from traps. I am not sure he still knows how to do
that.”</p>
<p>It is Netanyahu’s fourth speech to Congress — more than any other
world leader. During his address, his far-right governing partners will
want to hear his resolve to continue the war and topple Hamas.</p>
<p>The Biden administration will look for progress toward the latest
U.S.-backed cease-fire proposal and details on a postwar vision.
Republicans hope Netanyahu besmirches Biden and bolsters the GOP’s
hoped-for perception as Israel’s stalwart supporter.</p>
<p>The war, which was sparked by Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on southern
Israel, has tested Israel’s ties with its top ally as never before.</p>
<p>The Biden administration has stood staunchly beside Israel. But it
has grown increasingly alarmed about the conduct of the Israeli
military, the continued difficulties of getting humanitarian aid into
Gaza, especially after the short-lived U.S. military pier off Gaza
coast, as well as Israel’s lack of postwar plans and the harm to
civilians in Gaza. Similar concerns will likely persist if Americans
elect a new Democratic president.</p>
<p>Biden earlier this year froze the delivery of certain bombs over
fears they would be used in Israel’s incursion into the southern Gaza
city of Rafah, which at the time sheltered more than half of Gaza’s
population of 2.3 million.</p>
<p>The U.S. abstained from a United Nations Security Council vote in
March that called for a cease-fire and the release of hostages but did
not link the two. Netanyahu called the decision a “retreat” from a
“principled position” by Israel’s ally.</p>
<p>Biden has had to walk a fine line of his own. He has faced harsh
criticism from progressive Democrats and many Arab Americans. Even
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, the highest-ranking elected U.S.
Jewish official, lambasted Netanyahu in March for his handling of the
war.</p>
<p>Some Democrats will likely demonstrate their anger toward Biden and
Netanyahu by skipping Wednesday’s speech. Netanyahu is also likely to be
hounded by pro-Palestinian activists during his trip.</p>
<p>The last time Netanyahu spoke to Congress in 2015 was at the
invitation of the Republican Party. The trip drove Israeli-American
politics deep into the partisan divide as Netanyahu railed against
then-President Barack Obama’s Iran nuclear deal.</p>
<p>Netanyahu has not shied away from making Israel a partisan issue.
With his nationalist conservative ideology, he has been perceived as
throwing his support behind Republican candidates in the past, rankling
Democrats and Israelis who want to keep the U.S.-Israel relationship
bipartisan.</p>
<p>It’s unclear if he will meet Trump. If there is a meeting, it could
expose Netanyahu to accusations that he is once again taking sides. But
if he doesn’t meet with Trump, the former president could feel
slighted.</p>
<p>The speech also offers Netanyahu opportunity. He will be able to show
Israelis that despite the tensions with the Biden administration, U.S.
support for him remains ironclad.</p>
<p>“He wants the Israeli public to believe that he is very much still
very welcome in the United States. And this shows that the American
people are with him,” said David Makovsky, director of the program on
Arab-Israel Relations at the Washington Institute for Near East
Policy.</p>
<p>For critics of Netanyahu, that embrace is unacceptable and grants
legitimacy to a deeply polarizing leader whose public support has
plummeted. Netanyahu faces widespread protests and calls to resign over
the failures of Oct. 7 and his handling of the war.</p>
<p>In a letter to Congress, 500 Israeli writers, scholars and public
figures expressed their dismay over the invitation to Netanyahu, saying
he will use the platform to advance misguided policies that align with
his far-right governing partners.</p>
<p>“His only interest is preserving his own power,” they wrote. “Does
the United States Congress wish to support such a model of cynical and
manipulative leadership in these times?”</p>
<p>Israeli media reported that Netanyahu will be joined by rescued
hostage Noa Argamani and her father. But for many of the families of
hostages held in Gaza, the trip is an affront.</p>
<p>“This is not the time for trips,” Ayelet Levy Shachar, whose daughter
Naama was kidnapped on Oct. 7, told reporters.</p>
<p>“Netanyahu: First a deal, then you can travel.”</p>

id="bidens-decision-to-bow-out-goes-viral-on-chinese-social-media">Biden’s
decision to bow out goes viral on Chinese social media</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Taipei, Taiwan — The news of U.S. President Joe Biden’s decision to
end his reelection campaign quickly became a trending topic on Chinese
social media platforms Monday.</p>
<p>In a statement released on Sunday afternoon U.S. time, Biden
announced his decision to not run for a second term and vowed to focus
his energy on fulfilling his duties as president.</p>
<p>So far, the Chinese government has remained tight lipped about the
decision. At a regular press briefing on Monday, Foreign Ministry
spokesperson Mao Ning declined to comment, and said the “presidential
election is an internal affair of the United States.”</p>
<p>Online, however, the entry “Biden withdrew from the election”
attracted more than 400 million views on the China’s microblogging site
Weibo and tens of thousands of comments.</p>
<p>Other topics went viral as well. Topics such as “Zelensky respects
Biden’s decision to withdraw from the election,” “Harris praised Biden,”
and “Trump thinks Harris is easier to beat” were all in the top 20
searches Monday on Weibo, which is similar to the social media site
X.</p>
<p>Several major media outlets in China, including the state-run Xinhua
News Agency, People’s Daily, and the Global Times, covered Biden’s
withdrawal from the race extensively.</p>
<p>Many Chinese netizens expressed the view that Biden’s decision
ensures that Trump will win the election in November while some said
things have suddenly changed for Ukraine, referring to Trump’s repeated
criticism of U.S. military aid to Ukraine. “Tonight will be a sleepless
night for Zelensky,” Chinese netizen “Yo-Huai-To-Bi” from northeastern
Shandong province wrote on Weibo.</p>
<p>Other Chinese netizens argued that the United States will continue to
compete with China and try to contain the country’s rise regardless of
who wins the election in November.</p>
<p>“We shouldn’t be too happy about this news because Trump will likely
continue Biden’s strategies toward China and he might roll out harsher
measures,” a netizen called “BIGTREE33” from China’s southeastern Fujian
Province wrote on Weibo.</p>
<p>Some Chinese commentators said the Democratic Party will have very
little chance of winning the presidential election in November without
Biden.</p>
<p>“No faction in the Democratic Party can rebuild a campaign that can
challenge Trump within a short time, so after Biden withdrew from the
race, the Democrats will return to a very divided situation,” Jia Min,
an affiliated researcher at Shanghai Development Research Foundation,
told Shanghai Morning News in a video.</p>
<p>Hu Xijin, the former editor-in-chief of China’s state-run tabloid
Global Times, wrote on X that whoever becomes the Democratic Party’s
presidential candidate will make little difference to the presidential
race in November.</p>
<p>“Because Trump’s personality is so outstanding, American voters are
now divided into two groups: Trump lovers &amp; Trump haters,” he wrote,
adding that November’s election will be a choice between Trump or
“anyone.”</p>
<p>Harris vs. Trump</p>
<p>After Biden endorsed U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris to be the
presidential candidate for the Democratic Party and Harris vowed to win
the Democratic Party’s nomination, the entry “Could Harris defeat Trump”
quickly became a trending topic on Weibo.</p>
<p>More Chinese netizens seem to believe Harris has very little chance
of beating Trump in the presidential election. “If Hillary Clinton
couldn’t beat Trump back then, Harris would just be a joke,” a netizen
named “Falling in Love with Jia-tze-hu” from Shandong Province wrote on
Weibo.</p>
<p>Some Chinese analysts said Harris lacks the experience and
achievement to serve as the next president of the United States.</p>
<p>“Looking at Harris’s overall track record, her performance as vice
president has not been particularly outstanding, and she has not
achieved satisfactory results,” Sun Chenghao, a fellow at the Center for
International Security and Strategy at Tsinghua University, told Chinese
online media outlet the Paper.</p>
<p>Beijing-Washington rivalry to continue</p>
<p>While Biden’s decision to pull out of the presidential race will
likely shape the development of the U.S. presidential election, some
analysts say the Chinese government may think that these developments
won’t change the fact that Beijing and Washington are engaged in an
intense competition.</p>
<p>“Beijing’s view is that the U.S. and China are in this rivalry, and
it will continue no matter who runs in the election,” Ian Chong, a
political scientist at the National University of Singapore, told VOA by
phone.</p>
<p>Other experts say the Chinese government may not have clear
expectations about how different candidates may focus on issues related
to China.</p>
<p>“Despite being the vice president, Harris hasn’t said that much on
foreign policy, especially compared to the known track records of both
Biden and Trump,” said Timothy Rich, a political scientist at Western
Kentucky University.</p>
<p>“So, a known Trump, however erratic, may be easier [for Beijing] to
prepare for than Harris,” he told VOA in a written response.</p>
<p>If November’s election becomes a race between Trump and Harris, Rich
thinks a potential Trump victory would mean more tariffs on Chinese
commodities and a more explicit view of trade as a zero-sum game. A
potential Harris administration, he adds, may adopt a more nuanced
approach to address Washington’s trade relationship with China.</p>
<p>On the issue of Taiwan, Rich said the fact that the Republican
National Committee excluded Taiwan from the party platform may suggest
Trump is “thinking transactionally about how cutting off support for
Taiwan could lead to some big trade agreement with China.”</p>
<p>“In contrast, I can’t see a Harris administration deviating on
support for Taiwan much from her predecessor,” he told VOA.</p>

id="next-generation-us-jet-fighter-program-may-get-hit-by-budget-woes">Next-generation
US jet fighter program may get hit by budget woes</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The U.S. Air Force’s ambitious next-generation fighter
jet program, envisioned as a revolutionary leap in technology, could
become less ambitious as budget pressure, competing priorities and
changing goals compel a rethink, defense officials and industry
executives said. </p>
<p>Initially conceived as a “family of systems” centered around a
sixth-generation fighter jet, the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD)
program is meant to replace the F-22 Raptor and give the United States
the most powerful weaponry in the sky well into the mid-21st
century. </p>
<p>When it was first proposed, expectations were high, including an
unmatched stealth capability to keep it invisible from even the most
sophisticated radar, laser weapons and onboard artificial intelligence
to process masses of data coming from the latest in sensor technology.
 </p>
<p>However, sources said the current development budget of $28.5 billion
over five years ending in 2029 could be spread out over more time or
scaled-back as the Pentagon searches for a cost-effective solution. </p>
<p>Sources briefed on the Air Force’s internal budget deliberations said
the anticipated 2026 fiscal-year NGAD budget of $3.1 billion would be
slashed as funding shrinks, with one source adding that diminishing
funds could stretch development by two more years. </p>
<p>While it is unclear how much the overall program will cost, it could
eventually total well over $100 billion if 200 aircraft are produced,
including initial costs - plus maintenance and upgrades over time. There
are currently 185 F-22s in service — the plane NGAD is meant to
replace. </p>
<p>The Air Force is also reviewing the concept for the jet - perhaps
moving to a larger single-engine jet, from what is believed to be a
two-engine design, or even shifting more funding to a less expensive
unmanned drone to best address future air superiority needs given the
potential budget cuts, industry experts said. </p>
<p>“NGAD was conceived before a number of things: before the threat
became so severe, before CCAs [drone program] were introduced into the
equation and before we had some issues with affordability that we are
currently facing,” Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall said on Saturday at
Britain’s Royal International Air Tattoo, the world’s largest military
air show. </p>
<p>“Before we commit to the 2026 budget, we want to be sure we are on
the right path,” he added on a program that will be a popular talking
point at the Farnborough International Airshow this week. </p>
<p>The shift in focus comes as the Air Force grapples with substantial
cost overruns in several vital, and expensive, programs. For example,
its Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) program, which is
set to replace the aging Minuteman III missiles, has ballooned 81% over
budget, to around $141 billion. </p>
<p>Budget pressure has forced the Air Force to reassess its spending
priorities across various modernization efforts which also include
increasing production of the new B-21 bomber made by Northrop
GrummanNOC.N. </p>
<p>U.S. aerospace and defense companies Lockheed Martin LMT.N and Boeing
BA.N have responded to the Air Force’s request for proposal for the NGAD
system, sources told Reuters. </p>
<p>While defense firms are not exactly desperate for orders with
conflicts in Ukraine and Israel driving already-strong demand, NGAD was
one of several potentially giant programs many hoped would feed the
bottom line in the years ahead. </p>
<p>An Air Force spokesperson told Reuters the department is currently
building its fiscal 2026 budget which will be released early next year.
Representatives for Boeing did not return requests for comment. Lockheed
would not comment on NGAD. </p>
<p>“The part that seems to be getting stalled and re-evaluated is the
air vehicle itself, the central platform,” said J.J. Gertler, a senior
analyst at aerospace and defense analysis firm the Teal Group. </p>
<p>“The Air Force is now making sure that that’s what they actually want
and possibly changing their mind,” he added. </p>
<p>Possible new configurations might be shifting to a single engine for
the jet to save on up-front cost and long-term maintenance. Twin-engine
jets are much more expensive to buy and operate, but they are more
dependable and faster, therefore more deadly in a dogfight than their
single-engine foes. </p>
<p>Another key component emerging from this restructuring is the
possibility of shifting funds toward the unmanned fighter drone known as
the Collaborative Combat Aircraft initiative. </p>
<p>Development of the less expensive drone platforms, designed to

id="democratic-officials-donors-back-harris-after-biden-exits-us-presidential-race">Democratic
officials, donors back Harris after Biden exits US presidential
race</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Momentum appeared to be on the side of U.S. Vice
President Kamala Harris on Monday, as a groundswell of Democratic
lawmakers, governors and financial donors expressed their support for
her to be the party’s presidential nominee in the November election
after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race.</p>
<p>Biden followed his surprise announcement Sunday by issuing his own
endorsement of Harris to face former President Donald Trump, the
Republican Party’s nominee.</p>
<p>Harris, who is 59, quickly announced that she would seek the
nomination. She was a senator from the country’s most populous state,
California, when Biden picked her in 2020 as his running mate after
Harris’ challenge to Biden and other primary contenders fell apart.</p>
<p>Her approval ratings in national surveys have largely reflected
Biden’s, but some surveys of likely voters show Harris faring slightly
better than he does against Trump.  In a few, she has polled ahead of
Trump.</p>
<p>Harris said in a statement that Biden, by withdrawing from the race
against Trump, “is doing what he has done throughout his life of
service: putting the American people and our country above everything
else.”</p>
<p>“I will do everything in my power to unite the Democratic Party – and
unite our nation – to defeat Donald Trump,” she said. “We have 107 days
until Election Day. Together, we will fight. And together, we will
win.”</p>
<p>Early Monday, the Harris campaign said it had collected $49.6 million
in small-dollar donations since Biden withdrew and she announced her
candidacy. That stood in contrast to weeks of waning support for Biden,
particularly among top donors, following his stumbling performance in a
late June debate against Trump. </p>
<p>The Association of State Democratic Committees said in a statement
that an “overwhelming majority” of state party leaders backed Harris as
the party’s nominee, with several abstaining for procedural reasons.</p>
<p>Sunday’s outpouring of support for Harris also included at least one
Biden Cabinet member, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who said
he would do “all I can” to help elect Harris.</p>
<p>If Harris is accepted by the party to replace Biden, she would be the
first Black woman and South Asian major party presidential nominee in
the 248-year history of the United States.</p>
<p>Biden’s announcement Sunday followed a rising chorus within the
Democratic Party urging him to “pass the torch” amid his declining
national poll numbers and concerns raised by his debate performance.
During the debate, the 81-year-old president often appeared to lose his
train of thought, failed to forcefully press his case against the
78-year-old Trump or defend his own tenure in the White House.</p>
<p>Biden persevered, insisting he would not quit the race unless “the
Lord Almighty” asked him to or if he was shown polling numbers that he
could not beat Trump a second time or advised by his doctors he was not
physically able to continue.</p>
<p>But on Sunday, he said in a statement, “I believe it is in the best
interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus
solely on fulfilling my duties as president for the remainder of my
term,” which ends in six months in January.</p>
<p>Biden said he plans to address the nation about his decision later
this week.</p>
<p>Trump responded to the announcement by assailing both Biden and
Harris.</p>
<p>“Crooked Joe Biden was not fit to run for President, and is certainly
not fit to serve - And never was!” Trump posted on social media, adding
that Harris was just as bad as Biden.</p>
<p>“Harris will be easier to beat than Joe Biden would have been,” Trump
told CNN.</p>
<p>Many Republicans reacted by calling for Biden to resign as
president.</p>
<p>House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson, who is second in the
presidential line of succession behind Harris, called on Biden to step
down, claiming if he is unfit to keep his candidacy alive for another
four-year term, he is also unfit to remain as president until
Jan. 20.</p>
<p>If Biden were to resign, Harris would immediately be sworn in as the
country’s 47th president, at least until the inauguration for the victor
in the November 5 election.  </p>
<p>Names of other prominent Democrats have been floated as potential
candidates other than Harris, including several state governors:
Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, J.B.
Pritzker of Illinois and Gavin Newsom of California. Shapiro and Newsom
endorsed Harris on Sunday.</p>
<p>It was not immediately known who Harris might pick as her
vice-presidential running mate.    </p>
<p>Former president Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, who served as
Secretary of State under President Barack Obama but lost the 2016
presidential contest to Trump, endorsed Harris in a statement.  </p>
<p>Obama, whom Biden served with as vice president for eight years,
thanked Biden for his patriotism in leaving the race, but did not
endorse Harris or any other Democrat to be the party’s presidential
nominee.     </p>
<p>Media reports in the hours following Biden’s withdrawal quoted
sources close to Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, now an
independent, saying he was considering rejoining the Democratic Party to
try to replace the president at the top of the party’s ticket.</p>
<p>There are two ways for Democrats to replace Biden as the party’s
standard-bearer.</p>
<p>One would be a virtual vote among delegates to the Democratic
National Convention next month in Chicago that would lock in a new
nominee in early August. Chances are this process would favor Harris,
avoiding conflict at the Aug. 19-22 convention in front of a national
television audience.</p>
<p>The other way Democrats could pick a new nominee would be an “open”
convention in which several candidates, including Harris, would seek the
presidential nomination, a scenario the party hasn’t experienced since
1968, when President Lyndon Johnson dropped his plans to run for
reelection in face of widespread opposition to his handling of America’s
war against North Vietnam.</p>
<p>Some Democrats are suggesting the party quickly hold a “mini primary”
to allow Harris and anyone else to openly compete.</p>
<p>Biden has no public events on his schedule for Monday. The White
House said details on his schedule for the rest of the week will be
forthcoming.</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is headed to Washington to
address Congress on Wednesday and said he also plans to meet with
Biden. </p>

id="hundreds-of-migrants-in-new-caravan-headed-for-us-border">Hundreds
of migrants in new caravan headed for US border</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CIUDAD HIDALGO, Mexico — Hundreds of migrants from around a dozen
countries left from Mexico’s southern border on foot Sunday, as they
attempt to make it to the U.S. border.</p>
<p>Some of the members of the group said they hoped to make it to the
U.S. border before elections are held in November, because they fear
that if Donald Trump wins, he will follow through on a promise to close
the border to asylum-seekers.</p>
<p>“We are running the risk that permits (to cross the border) might be
blocked,” said Miguel Salazar, a migrant from El Salvador. He feared
that a new Trump administration might stop granting appointments to
migrants through CBP One, an app used by asylum-seekers to enter the
U.S. legally — by getting appointments at U.S. border posts, where they
make their cases to officials.</p>
<p>The app only works once migrants reach Mexico City, or states in
northern Mexico.</p>
<p>“Everyone wants to use that route” said Salazar, 37.</p>
<p>The group left Sunday from the southern Mexican town of Ciudad
Hidalgo, which is next to a river that marks Mexico’s border with
Guatemala.</p>
<p>Some said they had been waiting in Ciudad Hidalgo for weeks for
permits to travel to towns further to the north.</p>
<p>Migrants trying to pass through Mexico in recent years have organized
large groups to try to reduce the risk of being attacked by gangs or
stopped by Mexican immigration officials as they travel. But the
caravans tend to break up in southern Mexico, as people get tired of
walking for hundreds of kilometers.</p>
<p>Recently, Mexico has also made it more difficult for migrants to
reach the U.S. border on buses and trains.</p>
<p>Travel permits are rarely awarded to migrants who enter the country
without visas and thousands of migrants have been detained by
immigration officers at checkpoints in the center and north of Mexico
and bused back to towns deep in the south of the country.</p>
<p>Oswaldo Reyna, a 55-year-old Cuban migrant, crossed from Guatemala
into Mexico 45 days ago and waited in Ciudad Hidalgo to join the new
caravan announced on social media.</p>
<p>He criticized Trump’s recent comments about migrants and how they are
trying to “invade” the United States.</p>
<p>“We are not delinquents,” he said. “We are hard-working people who
have left our country to get ahead in life, because in our homeland we
are suffering from many needs.”</p>

id="bidens-decision-to-drop-out-crystalized-sunday-his-staff-knew-one-minute-before-the-public-did">Biden’s
decision to drop out crystalized Sunday; his staff knew one minute
before the public did</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — At 1:45 p.m. Sunday, President Joe Biden’s senior staff
was notified that he was stepping away from the 2024 race. At 1:46 p.m.,
that message was made public.</p>
<p>It was never Biden’s intention to leave the race: Up until he decided
to step aside Sunday, he was all in.</p>
<p>His campaign was planning fundraisers and events and setting up
travel over the next few weeks. But even as Biden was publicly dug in
and insisting he was staying in the race, he was quietly reflecting on
the disaster of the past few weeks, on the past three years of his
presidency and on the scope of his half-century career in politics.</p>
<p>In the end, it was the president’s decision alone, and he made it
quietly, from his vacation home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, sick with
COVID-19, the first lady with him as he talked it through with a small
circle of people who have been with him for decades.</p>
<p>“This has got to be one of the hardest decisions he’s ever made,”
said Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., the president’s closest ally in Congress,
who spoke with him Sunday. “I know he wanted to fight and keep going and
show that he could beat Donald Trump again, but as he heard more and
more input, I think he was wrestling with what would be the best for the
country,” Coons said in an interview with The Associated Press.</p>
<p>This story is based on interviews with more than a dozen people
familiar with the president’s thinking over the past few weeks, days and
hours as he made his decision. They spoke to The Associated Press on
condition of anonymity to talk about private discussions.</p>
<p>Deciding to leave the race</p>
<p>It wasn’t until Saturday evening that Biden began to come to the
conclusion that he would not run for reelection. He started writing a
letter to the American people.</p>
<p>Biden had been off the campaign trail for a few days, isolated
because of COVID-19, when it all started to deeply sink in — his
worsening chances of being able to defeat Donald Trump with so much of
his party in open rebellion, seeking to push him out of the race — not
to mention the persistent voter concerns about his age that were only
exacerbated by the catastrophic debate.</p>
<p>Biden was at his beach home with some of his and Jill Biden’s closest
aides: chief strategist Mike Donilon, counselor to the president Steve
Ricchetti, White House deputy chief of staff Annie Tomasini, and Anthony
Bernal, senior adviser to the first lady.</p>
<p>By Sunday, his decision crystalized. He spoke multiple times with
Vice President Kamala Harris, whom he would endorse. He informed White
House chief of staff Jeff Zients, and his longtime aide and campaign
chairwoman Jen O’Malley Dillon.</p>
<p>A small group of senior advisers from both the campaign and the White
House were assembled for the 1:45 p.m. call to relay Biden’s decision,
while his campaign staff released the social media announcement one
minute later.</p>
<p>“It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your
President. And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I
believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to
stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for
the remainder of my term,” Biden wrote.</p>
<p>Just about a half-hour later came his public vote of support for
Harris. It was a carefully choreographed strategy meant to give the
president’s initial statement full weight, and to put a period on the
moment before launching forward into the next step.</p>
<p>“Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to
be the nominee of our party this year,” Biden said in another post on X.
“Democrats — it’s time to come together and beat Trump.”</p>
<p>About that debate</p>
<p>It’s not like things had been going great before the June 27 debate.
In an August 2023 poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public
Affairs Research, fully 77% of U.S. adults said Biden was too old to be
effective for four more years. Not only did 89% of Republicans say that,
but so did 69% of Democrats.</p>
<p>And it hadn’t gotten any better by April, when more than half of U.S.
adults thought Biden’s presidency hurt the country on issues like the
cost of living and immigration.</p>
<p>But Biden had insisted — to himself, to the nation, to his supporters
— that he would be able to bring voters around if he got out there, told
people about his record, explained it to them. Talked to them. Looked
them in the eye.</p>
<p>He had a lifetime of experience that told him that if he stuck to it,
he’d overcome. His campaign was so confident, in fact, that they
arranged to go around the Commission on Presidential Debates to set up a
series of faceoffs with Trump under a new set of rules.</p>
<p>That produced the June 27 debate that set Biden’s downfall in motion.
Biden gave nonsensical answers, trailed off mid-sentence and appeared to
stare blankly in front of an audience of 51 million people. Perhaps most
distressing to other Democrats, Biden didn’t go after Trump’s myriad
falsehoods about his involvement in the violence around the insurrection
on Jan. 6, 2021, abortion rights or immigration.</p>
<p>Biden and his team blamed the night on so many different things. He
had a cold. He was jet-lagged. He needed to get more sleep. That night
opened the door for his party to push him out.</p>
<p>A slow acceptance</p>
<p>Publicly and privately Biden was fighting to stay in the race. He was
working to convince voters that he was up for the task for another four
years. He was frustrated by the Democrats coming out publicly against
him, but even angrier about the leaks and anonymous sources relaying how
even former President Barack Obama and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi
were working to get him to drop out.</p>
<p>It looked like he’d won out a couple times; the chorus of naysayers
seemed to die down. He had some well-received speeches mixed with so-so
TV interviews and a day featuring an extended news conference in which
he displayed a nuanced grasp of policy but also committed a few
gasp-inducing gaffes.</p>
<p>But the doubts didn’t go away.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer eventually invited top Biden
staff to a meeting on July 11 to talk about their concerns. It didn’t go
well. Senators expressed their concerns, and almost none of them said
they had confidence in the president. But even afterward, Schumer was
worried it wasn’t getting to Biden.</p>
<p>Following the meeting, Schumer called Democratic House Leader Hakeem
Jeffries, former Speaker Nancy Pelosi and former President Obama.
Schumer decided that day to request a meeting with Biden.</p>
<p>At a July 13 meeting in Rehoboth, Schumer told Biden he was there out
of love and affection. And he delivered a personal appeal focused on
Biden’s legacy, the country’s future and the impact the top of the
ticket could have on congressional races — and how that could
potentially affect the Supreme Court. That same day came the attempted
assassination of Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Schumer told the president he didn’t expect him to make an immediate
decision, but he hoped Biden would think about what he said, according
to a person familiar with the conversation.</p>
<p>Biden responded, “I need another week,” and the two men hugged.</p>
<p>Sunday’s decision</p>
<p>It was full steam ahead until Biden pulled the emergency brake.</p>
<p>The president had lost his voice, but he was recovering well and his
doctor had sent an update to the public shortly before 1 p.m. on his
condition. His small circle decided to post the statement on X on
Sunday, rather than let it leak out for days before he was prepared to
address the nation, which he is expected to do sometime early this
week.</p>
<p>Much of his campaign was blindsided, and it was clear by how little
had changed after he dropped out. For hours after the announcement,
Biden’s campaign website reflected that he was still running and
KamalaHarris.com still redirected to Biden’s page.</p>
<p>Even Harris’ statement announcing her intent to succeed Biden was
sent from “Joe Biden for President.”</p>
<p>After the public announcement, Zients held a senior staff call, sent
out an email and spoke with Biden’s cabinet. The president was also
making personal calls.</p>
<p>“Team — I wanted to make sure you saw the attached letter from the
President,” Zients wrote in the staff email. “I could not be more proud
to work for President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, and the
American people — alongside all of you, the best White House team in
history. There’s so much more to do — and as President Biden says,
‘there is nothing America can’t do — when we do it together.’”</p>
<p>Vermont Sen. Peter Welch, a Democrat who had called for Biden to bow
out, was gardening with his wife when the news broke, and said he was
momentarily “stunned.” Senators texted each other questioning if it was
really happening.</p>
<p>Democratic Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal was at an event in his
state, and there was spontaneous applause when it was announced to the
crowd that Biden wouldn’t run, he said.</p>
<p>There was a sense of excitement and energy in the crowd “that has
been completely lacking,” Blumenthal said.</p>
<p>“It was also, let’s be blunt, a sense of relief,” he said. “And a
sense of reverence for Joe Biden.”</p>
<p>By Sunday evening, Biden for President had formally changed to Harris
for President.</p>
<p>O’Malley Dillon told campaign staff their jobs were safe, because the
operation was shifting to a campaign for Harris.</p>

<p>date: 2024-07-22, from: Ben Werdmuller’s blog</p>
<div class="e-content aside-content">
<p>
I didn’t post about it — what is there to say that hasn’t been said
elsewhere? — but former President Trump was almost shot last week. The
would-be assassin’s motive is muddy (he was a Republican), but the
bullet or a sliver of glass narrowly missed him, taking a nip out of his
ear. He’s been using it as political ammunition ever since, and the
entire RNC, which started the following day, was in essence a stage show
about toxic masculinity, featuring guests like Kid Rock, Hulk Hogan (who
tore off his shirt to reveal another shirt with the Trump / Vance logo
on it), and the CEO of the Ultimate Fighting Championship. At one point,
during a Michigan rally following the event, Trump pulled a guy out of
the crowd to remark how well-defined his arms were. His campaign, his
policies, his demeanor are <em>Idiocracy</em> come to life.
</p>
<p>
As for his Vice Presidential candidate, I’d love to see a lot more
people talking about JD Vance’s support for Curtis Yarvin, who believes
in the reinstatement of slavery, in replacing the democratically elected
government with a CEO king, and that Hitler was acting in self defense.
</p>
<p>
I have many differences with Joe Biden: most notably, his failure to
take a strong stand against the ongoing slaughter in Gaza, and his
war-faring foreign policy history throughout his career. But he’s not
Donald Trump and he’s not JD Vance. Domestically, the Biden Presidency
undoubtedly had some strong progressive successes over the last four
years, in ways that genuinely helped vulnerable Americans. I voted for
him in 2020. And certainly, were he the Democratic nominee, I would have
voted for him again.
</p>
<p>
It seems almost certain that the Democratic nominee will be Kamala
Harris. If that turns out to be the case, I’ll absolutely vote for her.
With enthusiasm.
</p>
<p>
What I hope is that she can paint a picture of the world she wants to
create. Biden never quite achieved that for me: he even memorably said
to donors, that “nothing would fundamentally change” if he was elected.
America needs change; it needs equity; it needs a renewed compassion,
stronger safety nets, a leg up for people who need it, and a mentality
that nobody should fall through the cracks. A focus on strong
communities and bonds based on empathy rather than breaks for the rich
and military might. A focus on a democratic, inclusive world and not
just an American one. Beyond just not being Trump and not being Vance,
those are my hopes for a Harris Presidency.

<h2 id="metadata-schema-development-plans">Metadata schema development
plans</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-22, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<h2 id="its-been-a-while-heres-a-metadata-update-and-request-for-feedback">
It’s been a while, here’s a metadata update and request for feedback
</h2>
<p>
In Spring 2023 we sent out a
<a href="https://community.crossref.org/t/take-our-metadata-priorities-survey-by-may-18/3498" target="_blank">survey</a>
to our community with a goal of assessing what our priorities for
metadata development should be - what projects are our community ready
to support? Where is the greatest need? What are the roadblocks?
</p>
<p>
The intention was to help prioritize our metadata development work.
There’s a lot we want to do, a lot our community needs from us, but we
really want to make sure we’re focusing on the projects that will have
the most immediate impact for now.
</p>
<p>
Several projects were proposed, based on community demand over time. All
are projects we intend to support long-term.
</p>
<h2 id="projects">
Projects
</h2>
<p>
The projects included in the survey were:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Alternate names</strong> - We proposed adding a repeatable
‘name’ element to allow for names that aren’t separated by
given/family/surname.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Updates to funding data</strong>
-<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/roring-ahead-using-ror-in-place-of-the-open-funder-registry/" target="_blank">this
update</a> will be released in the near future and includes:
<ul>
<li>
Expand ROR support - Allow members to supply ROR ID instead of funder ID
in funding data and grant records.
</li>
<li>
Include Grant DOIs in funding metadata.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Publication typing in citations</strong> - Support citation type
in citation metadata (for example article, preprint, data, software,
etc.).
</li>
<li>
<strong>Expand contributor role support</strong> - Allow multiple
contributor roles to be provided per contributor and add support for
external vocabularies (like CRediT)
</li>
<li>
<strong>Expand abstract support</strong> - We currently require all
abstracts to be formatted using JATS. We will be adding new abstract
formats, including BITS and ONIX (which have been requested), as well as
a generic abstract format (non-JATS).
</li>
<li>
<strong>Statements</strong> - Add support for free text statements such
as data availability, acknowledgments, funding, and conflict of
interest.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Contributor identifiers</strong> - Accept contributor
identifiers such as ISNI (in addition to ORCID, which is already
supported).
</li>
<li>
<strong>Conference event IDs</strong> - Identifiers for
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/taking-the-con-out-of-conferences/" target="_blank">conference
events</a>.
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whats-next">
What’s next?
</h2>
<p>
There is a clear preference for publication types in citations and
abstract markup, expanded support for multilingual metadata, followed by
expanding contributor roles to support multiple roles and the CRediT
taxonomy. The results have helped us prioritize our work and we’re
advancing several projects soon based on our readiness to move forward.
</p>
<p>
First up is <strong>publication typing in citations and
statements</strong> - we hope to be able to make this ready for
registration in the coming months, but want to confirm a few things
first, primarily the list of ‘types’ to apply to citations, so please
review and comment:
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1VPXhTPMZzfvAPmTOlNp-bZf9cTLkw0dPZFTuDtDIPls/edit" target="_blank">Metadata
updates in need of feedback July 2024</a>
</p>
<p>
We also have been discussing expansions to our <strong>support for
preprints metadata</strong> with our
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/working-groups/preprints/" target="_blank">Preprints
Advisory Group</a> and have a number of preprint-specific updates that
will be rolled out in the coming months as well, including support for
versions and status. These proposed changes are also available for
comment.
</p>
<p>
And finally, we will be expanding <strong>support for contributor
roles</strong> to include multiple roles per contributor, as well as
adding support for the
<a href="https://credit.niso.org/" target="_blank">CRediT</a> taxonomy.
This update is yet to be scheduled but we do have the inputs and output
planning done and welcome any comments on this as well.
</p>
<p>
We will also be continuing work on other projects highlighted in the
survey that aren’t quite ready to go:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Multilingual metadata</strong>: Support for multilingual
metadata in particular is very important and will require a fairly
significant technical effort, so we want to be sure we get this right -
at minimum we need to include repeatable fields flagged with language
metadata for most items, there may be other considerations as well such
as the scope of languages supported.
</p>
<p>
As we develop new metadata segments we’re keeping language metadata in
mind, but I’d like to form a short-term working group to help shape this
update - this group will be focused on the details of supporting
multilingual metadata in our inputs and outputs, so conversations will
be very XML and JSON heavy. If you are interested and available please
contact <a href="mailto:pfeeney@crossref.org">pfeeney@crossref.org</a>.
<p>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Abstract markup:</strong> we are currently in the research phase
of this project but will be proposing updates and asking for input this
fall. At the moment support for BITS and ONIX abstracts have been
requested, as well as an agnostic format.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Expansion of name and contributor ID support</strong>: work is
under way for this as well, and I should have inputs and outputs for
feedback in the coming months.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
We anticipate more developments and requests for feedback in the future
as we still have other projects from the list above to get to. I’ve
opened up a
‘<a href="https://community.crossref.org/c/metadata-development/15" target="_blank">Metadata
Development</a>’ section in our Community Forum to invite discussion and
will be kicking off a renewed Metadata Interest Group in the fall.
