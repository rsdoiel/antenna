<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump%E2%80%93Raffensperger_phone_call">he
is</a>) then if he isn’t punished we no longer have the rule of law. So
don’t miss that we are on trial too. And – when journalism frames the
faceoff as Democrat vs Republican, they ignore us, the people of the
United States. Whether people know it or not, they will lose if the
Republicans win. We know that, it’s provable. And anything that’s true
should be built into the stories journalism writes about.</p>

Pro’s Single-User Nature Hampers Apple’s Healthcare Aspirations</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-11, from: TidBITS blog</p>
Apple is making much of the opportunities for the Vision Pro in
healthcare, but it’s hard to see them making a significant impact while
the Vision Pro remains a single-user device both digitally and
physically.

Menendez Enters Not Guilty Plea to Latest Criminal Indictment</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Sen. Bob Menendez and his wife pleaded not guilty on
Monday to new obstruction of justice charges in a New York court.</p>
<p>The new charges were in a rewritten indictment returned last week
against the Democrat in Manhattan federal court.</p>
<p>“Once again, not guilty your honor,” Menendez responded after Judge
Sidney H. Stein asked him to enter a plea at a 20-minute hearing.
Menendez had previously pleaded not guilty to charges in October.</p>
<p>Menendez and his wife, Nadine, entered the pleas to the indictment
containing new charges of conspiracy to obstruct justice and obstruction
of justice. Afterward, they briefly spoke to one another before leaving
the courtroom together.</p>
<p>The couple is charged with conspiring with three businessmen to
accept bribes of gold bars, cash and a luxury car in return for the
senator’s help in projects pursued by the businessmen.</p>
<p>Two of the three businessmen they allegedly conspired with also
entered not guilty pleas on Monday. A third, Jose Uribe, pleaded guilty
two weeks ago to bribery charges and agreed to testify against the
others at a trial set for May 6.</p>
<p>The new allegations — part of what is now an 18-count indictment —
are related to gifts prosecutors say the couple received from Uribe.</p>
<p>According to the indictment, Menendez caused his lawyer to falsely
tell prosecutors overseeing the investigation that he was unaware that
another of his business associates had helped his wife make a $23,000
mortgage payment on her New Jersey home. It said Nadine Menendez caused
her lawyer to tell prosecutors last August that the mortgage payment and
funds provided by Uribe for a Mercedes-Benz were loans when she knew
they were bribes.</p>
<p>Menendez said in a statement last week that prosecutors have “long
known that I learned of and helped repay loans — not bribes — that had
been provided to my wife.”</p>
<p>After his fall arrest, Menendez, 70, was forced to relinquish his
chairmanship of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee but said he would
not resign from Congress.</p>

In collaboration with the other major browser engine developers, Mozilla

Speedometer, this benchmark measures what we think matters most for
performance online: responsiveness. But today’s release is more open and
more challenging than before, and is the best tool for driving browser
performance improvements that we’ve ever seen.

<h2 id="better-faster-stronger-time-zone-updates-on-android">Better,
faster, stronger time zone updates on Android</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-11, from: OS News</p>
<p>From the beginning, time zone rules were a component in Mainline,
called Time Zone Data or tzdata module. This integration allowed us to
react more quickly to government-mandated time zone changes than before.
However until 2023 tzdata updates were still bundled with other Mainline
changes, sometimes leading to testing complexities and slower
deployment. In 2023, we made further investments in Mainline’s
infrastructure and decoupled the tzdata module from the other
components. With this isolation, we gained the ability to respond
rapidly to time zone legislation changes — often releasing updates to
Android users outside of the established release cadence. Additionally,
this change means time zone updates can reach a far greater number of
Android devices, ensuring you as Android users always see the correct
time. ↫ Almaz Mingaleev and Masha Khokhlova This is equal parts boring
and equal parts amazing. The amount of work developers have to put into
making sure timezones work is astonishing, and the fact that a large
chunk of it is done by volunteers is even more impressive.</p>

<h2 id="oh-servers">Oh servers!</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-11, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
The other day I wrote proudly that we had better more reliable server
software in 2024 than we did the first time we bootstrapped blogging
communities.
</p>
<p>
And then this happened…
</p>
<p>
We’ve been having serious problems on
<a href="https://feedland.com/">feedland.com</a> since Friday when I
made a software version mistake. At first it caused the server to crash
when you tried to subscribe to a new feed, so you’d get an awful error
message, either from the FeedLand website, or the browser, saying the
server had gone away. I quickly fixed that problem and another, and
restored the server to some basic functionality. But when I did some
work on my account over the weekend, I saw that there were new errors.
And then noticed that none of my feeds had updated since March 8, they
still haven’t.
</p>
<p>
We’re going to fix it this morning, by reverting the server software to
the version as it was before the update, and the server should return to
its previous reliability, Murphy-willing. Then we’re going to upgrade
the database, and then install the new software, and try again. That
won’t happen today and probably not tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
Most people probably don’t know that feedland.com is a project I’m doing
with Automattic. It’s running in their cloud. This system should be able
to scale up in ways that a Digital Ocean droplet can’t, where
feedland.org and the new feedland.social are running. So when there are
many thousands of users, we should be okay. That’s why I did the work to
convert FeedLand so everything is stored in the SQL database, and
nothing in the file system, among other changes that had to be made last
year, like getting off Twitter for identity. That was not much fun, but
it had to be done.
</p>
<p>
Anyway I am very sorry and embarrassed for the unreliable performance on
our main server in the last few days. I can’t promise it won’t happen
again, but we learned a lot in this experience, and in some cases
re-learned.
</p>
<p>
It’s even worse than it appears and as they say – still diggin!

the Environmental Protection Agency over its sweeping methane rules that
target oil and gas operations. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas that
is 80 times more warming than carbon dioxide, and oil and gas sites are
a key source of man-made methane emissions. The EPA regulations,
announced late last year, ban polluting practices like routine flaring
of natural gas from new wells, require wells to be regularly monitored
for leaks, and phase out some old and leaky infrastructure. As<em>

Emily Pontecorvo reported</a>, the EPA says the rules will prevent the
equivalent of 1.5 billion tons of carbon dioxide from being emitted
between 2024 and 2038, almost as much as was emitted by all power plants
in the country in 2021. Texas is the largest oil-producing state in the
U.S. It challenged the rules late on Friday, accusing the EPA of
“overreach.”

<li>Analysis shows Europe is woefully unprepared for climate change

<p>
<strong></strong>Europe is the fastest-warming continent on Earth,
heating at twice the global rate, but is underprepared for the
“catastrophic” risks posed by climate change, according to an
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=ffc4109111&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">assessment
from the European Union Environment Agency</a>. The group considered 36
major climate risks, including ecosystem collapse, drought, and extreme
heat, and concluded that unless preparations are made, hundreds of
thousands of people could die from heat waves, and coastal floods could
cost 1 trillion euros per year. The EEA warned that policymakers need to
do more to shore up critical infrastructure, agriculture, and healthcare
systems to prepare for extreme weather before it’s too late. “Our new
analysis shows that Europe faces urgent climate risks that are growing
faster than our societal preparedness,”

<li>Low-voltage batteries failing in some EVs
</h3>
<p>
<strong> </strong>Some new electric vehicles are experiencing repeated
problems with their 12-volt batteries,
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=a2a90ea2a2&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a><em>
The Wall Street Journal.</em> These are the low-voltage batteries that
have been found under the hoods of most cars for years. They power
things like interior lights and electronics, and seem to be dying
quickly in some brand new EVs, including models from Cadillac, Hyundai,
and Rivian. “The 12-volt battery is in many ways a dated technology for
cars on the road today, which are becoming more like computers on wheels
and have greater power needs,” Ryan Felton reported for the
<em>Journal</em>. “But switching to a higher-voltage system is also
difficult because it would essentially mean wholesale changes to the
supply chain for these parts.” Tesla’s Cybertruck has already moved to a
48-volt system, and the company’s director called it “the future for low
voltage design at Tesla and likely the rest of the industry in due
course.”

<li>Musk Foundation is ‘largely self-serving,’ according to NYT

<strong></strong>A <em>New York Times</em>

calls into question the integrity of Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s charity, the
Musk Foundation, accusing it of failing to give away the minimum amount
of money to justify hefty tax breaks, and being “haphazard and largely
self-serving.” The Musk Foundation has a history of donating millions
less than is required by tax law, and the <em>Times</em> found that
about half of its donations between 2021 and 2022 were linked to Musk in
some way, including a food charity run by his brother and a school where
Musk’s own children attended. “The really striking thing about Musk is
the disjuncture between his outsized public persona, and his very, very
minimal philanthropic presence,” said Benjamin Soskis, who studies
philanthropy at the Urban Institute.

<li>Seedlings from famous Sycamore Gap tree begin to sprout
</h3>
<p>
<strong></strong>Seedlings from England’s famous Sycamore Gap tree,
which was felled by vandals last year, have sprouted. Conservation
experts collected seeds and cuttings from the 300-year-old tree before
it was removed from its home along Hadrian’s Wall and brought them to
the National Trust’s conservation center with hopes of cultivating them
and perhaps planting a new tree in the same location. The first
seedlings began to sprout at the start of 2024. The conservation center
is in a secret location in London. It houses genetic copies of important
plants including the apple tree said to have inspired Sir Isaac Newton’s
theory of gravity, and a tree where Henry VIII courted Anne Boleyn,

to</a> <em>The Guardian</em>. “while there’s a way to go before we have
true saplings, we’ll be keeping everything crossed that these plants
continue to grow stronger and can be planted out and enjoyed by many in
the future,” said Andrew Jasper, Director of Gardens and Parklands at
the National Trust.

Federal Reserve Needs to Get Serious About Climate Change</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-11, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTY5MjU1NC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcxNTY0NzU2M30.MemCp_vvKtIEpnCpVAOmmxRjboCUavb624J94ULUY4w/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
People <em style="">really</em> hate inflation. Fortunately, prices are
no longer rising nearly as rapidly as they were in 2021 and 2022.
However, we may be on the cusp of a longer epoch of periodic inflation
caused by climate change, one of the biggest long-term threats to price
stability. The Federal Reserve should act accordingly. <br/>
</p>
<p>
America’s central bank has a dual mandate: It calibrates monetary policy
to maximize employment while minimizing inflation. With
<a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1hVzK" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">unemployment</a>
reaching record lows, the Fed has been focused on controlling the spike
in inflation we saw from 2021-2022. It quickly raised interest rates
over the last two years in order to cool the economy and put downward
pressure on prices. And voila, after peaking in the summer of 2022,
<a href="https://www.bls.gov/charts/consumer-price-index/consumer-price-index-by-category-line-chart.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">inflation</a>
has steadily fallen to manageable levels.
</p>
<p>
However, the Fed’s rate hikes may not have been the primary driver
behind disinflation. Inflation, it’s often said, occurs when there’s too
much money chasing too few goods. The Fed’s higher-interest rate policy
primarily hit the <em>too much money</em> side of the ledger, decreasing
demand by making it more expensive for people and businesses to borrow.
But there’s mounting evidence that the bigger macro-economic problem was
<em>too few goods</em>. The Roosevelt Institute did a
<a href="https://rooseveltinstitute.org/publications/supply-side-expansion-has-driven-the-decline-in-inflation/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">close
analysis</a> of inflation’s decline since 2022, and found that prices of
goods have fallen even while demand has increased. That suggests that
most of the decline in inflation has been from increased supply — that
is, inflation was cured by recovering from pandemic-era supply chain
bottlenecks. Supply chains that got snarled by COVID-19 production
shutdowns and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine slowly sorted themselves out;
as more goods came on to the market, prices eventually stabilized.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, the Federal Reserve’s own data found that supply chain pressure
closely tracked inflation. Researchers at the San Francisco Fed
<a href="https://www.frbsf.org/research-and-insights/publications/economic-letter/2023/06/global-supply-chain-pressures-and-us-inflation/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">found</a>
that supply chain issues account for 60 percent of inflation in 2021 and
2022.
</p>
<p>
In order to prevent future inflation flare-ups, we must guard against
other foreseeable supply chain shocks. The pandemic may have been a
once-in-a-lifetime (let’s hope) calamity, but it won’t be the last
supply pileup. Climate change is also expected to
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/08/business/economy/climate-change-supply-chain.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wreak
havoc</a> on the global movement of goods. As the planet warms,
droughts, floods, and other extreme weather will
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-58073295" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">become</a>
more frequent and more severe. That will lead to a rise in the magnitude
and frequency of supply-chain disruptions as factories are evacuated or
shipping routes become untraversable.
</p>
<p>
For example, in August 2022, Chinese factories were
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/08/business/economy/climate-change-supply-chain.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">closed</a>
not due to the pandemic, but because of a brutal drought. These closures
in turn froze international supply chains for cars, electronics and
other goods. Significant waterways for international trade, like the
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/01/business/economy/panama-canal-drought-shipping.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Panama
Canal</a> and the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/river-freight-climate-economies" target="_blank">Rhine</a>,
have seen their water levels periodically dry up so much that shipping
vessels cannot pass through, halting the shipment of goods.
</p>
<p>
We’ll see more of this as warming worsens. As the White House Council of
Economic Advisers
<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/ERP-2022.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>,
“As [supply-chain] networks become more connected, and climate change
worsens, the frequency and size of supply-chain-related disasters
rises.” The CEA found that over the last 40 years, the frequency of
natural disasters around the world has tripled, and the number of
billion-dollar disasters each year has risen from five to 20.
</p>
<p>
Food prices are among the most visible — and painful — forms of
inflation for consumers. And we’ve seen climate-related weather events
drive up food prices in the past. As the U.S. Department of Agriculture
recalled in its
<a href="https://www.ams.usda.gov/sites/default/files/media/USDAAgriFoodSupplyChainReport.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2022
supply chain report</a>, a severe years-long drought in the southern
plains states in the early 2010s dramatically culled the population of
beef cows and caused historically high beef prices. And global
<a href="https://grist.org/agriculture/heatflation-how-hot-temperatures-drive-inflation-food-prices/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">heat
waves</a> in recent years have sent the cost of staple crops soaring.
</p>
<p>
While some amount of warming is locked in at this point, doing all we
can to cut emissions as quickly as possible will help minimize future
supply chain disruptions. That requires building massive amounts of new
clean energy infrastructure. In 2022, the federal government passed
major climate legislation as part of the Inflation Reduction Act to
offer hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies to encourage the
development of wind farms, solar arrays, and other clean energy sources,
as well as financial incentives for consumers to purchase electric
vehicles, heat pumps, and other clean-energy home upgrades.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, the passage of the IRA has coincided with the Fed’s
generationally-high interest rate policy. High interest rates have made
it
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/05/climate/renewable-energy-inflation-climate-cop28.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">much
more costly</a> to build renewable energy projects in the U.S. and
around the world — especially expensive projects like
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/high-interest-rates-clean-energy" target="_self">offshore
wind farms,</a> which have seen multiple cancellations and delays due to
higher-than-anticipated financing costs. High rates are also a heavier
drag on renewable energy projects than fossil fuel projects because the
bulk of the costs for a wind or solar farm are in upfront construction.
</p>
<p>
The Fed expects to begin gradually cutting interest rates over the
coming year if inflation continues to cool. That would ease borrowing
costs throughout the economy, which will help more clean energy projects
get built and make EVs more affordable to more buyers. That’s a win-win:
A swift pivot to a clean-energy economy will reduce emissions, which
will also mitigate future weather-related supply chain shocks. And that
will make it easier for the Fed to fulfill its mandate to manage
inflation in the future: Lower interest rates now will help support
rapid decarbonization, which in turn will reduce climate-induced
inflation down the road.
</p>
<p>
That’s not to say that the central bank needs to morph into a “Green
Fed.”
</p>
<p>
“The Federal Reserve is not and will not be a ‘climate policymaker,’”
Chairman Jerome Powell
<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/powell-statement-20231024b.htm" target="_blank">said</a>
in October, when the Fed and other agencies unveiled guidance for how
banks should manage climate-related financial risk. “Decisions about
policies to address climate change must be made by the elected branches
of government.”
</p>
<p>
The Fed takes a thousand-foot view of the economy, and can’t set rates
based on the needs of any one industry, no matter how important. But as
climate change reshapes the world around us, all institutions will feel
its effects, including the Fed. While environmental goals won’t drive
Fed policy, managing long-term inflation will mean paying attention to
how the bank’s actions affect the climate. Just as the Fed monitors how
interest rate policy affects key sectors like the housing market, it
should also pay increasing attention to how it affects the clean-energy
sector.
</p>
<p>
When the Inflation Reduction Act passed, the law’s name drew some scorn
as a supposed misnomer for what was fundamentally a climate bill. But
over the long haul, combating climate change <em style="">is</em> a big
part of what we need to do to ward off inflation. If we fall short, then
missed decarbonization opportunities today will increase the threat of
extreme-weather supply-chain bottlenecks tomorrow. And that means more
inflation. Even if it’s not a “climate policymaker,” the Fed will come
to care about climate change.The only question is whether that happens
years from now, when climate inflation arrives in earnest, or now, when
we still have a chance to do something about it.

<h2 id="why-do-we-even-blog">2024-03-07 Why do we even blog?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-11, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2024-03-07-why-do-we-even-blog">
2024-03-07 Why do we even blog?
</h1>
<p>
The urge to blog lives in a strange place. One speaks to an imagined
audience. It is not enough to imagine an audience, though. It’s more
than writing into a booklet, “Dear Diary, …” – and yet we do it even if
there are no comments. Sure, I never had a lot of comments. But I think
I’m just as happy getting the occasional email or reply on the
fediverse. The thought of somebody reading the words is terrifying. And
once I got that first comment, once I started linking the blog from my
profiles, putting it out there for others to find, inviting people to
read and implicitly, to judge… I started discovered that the blog was
something I feared. The blog is a thrill. It makes me nervous. The heart
beats. The heart bleeds.
</p>
<p>
Back when the blog had comments, I used to be anxious about comments.
First, there’s a comment. Is it good or bad? Do I read it now? Do I risk
a look? But then the imagined audience is still there and now it’s
worse. How will I react as I am being watched? Blogging turns into a
performance where I feel like I’m demonstrating my moral character. I am
not a racist! I am not a white supremacist! I am not a homophobe! Or am
I? All the discourse online has made me self-conscious. I really don’t
want to be what I fear I might be without knowing it. I keep thinking of
the idea that people who aren’t very observant being unable to perceive
their own faults. The requirements go up when I learn more.
</p>
<p>
The effect of all that anxiety, for me, is that I take things seriously.
Words are serious. I try to put my word where my heart is. I try to
weight them carefully. I weigh my heart. Writing is morally intense. It
doesn’t matter how long or how short the page, how trivial or how
controversial the topic.
</p>
<p>
And above all of it hangs the grey sky of unspoken words, of thoughts
unexamined and all that maladjustment, all the failures, all the
judgements. How often have I found myself falling short of my own
measure.
</p>
<p>
To blog is to wrestle with that. I imagine an audience that is strangely
interested in all the things I am interested in. I write for them, for
me, for my future self that looks back, the heart full of regret. I
struggle for virtue and I put it into words for you and me, the imagined
reader and myself. As proof. “I struggled!” I struggle. I keep on
struggling to discover what is right and to do what is right.
</p>
<p>
Blogging is like writing secret confessions. I write about the things
that I think I did well because I did them wrong and then I changed my
mind. I write about the things I know because I did not know them
before. And who cares about those laborious system administration blog
posts where I struggle with this or that ephemeral problem. All these
issues are lost pages. Nobody cares. People find their answers on Stack
Overflow or Reddit or some other centralized platform where middlemen
gamify the experience so that we can help each other while on the
thread-mill for their pockets. And who cares about those blog posts
about growing old or playing games? People read them and move on. Like I
do, when I’m reading online. Even if I am moved, I will move on. And
there are so many posts to read, the folders on my disk with saved
articles and snippets are more like compost heaps, where layer upon
layer of good stuff gets dropped, never to see the light of day again.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps it sparked a thought somewhere, and perhaps that spark starts a
fire, somewhere, much later. There is practically no connection and that
is fine. The world moves and humanity is moved like a dreamer, one
thought knows not the next, and we all partake in that eternal digestion
of the sleepless mind. Our books, our journals, our blogs, our posts,
they all participate. Perhaps we fall for those waves of outrage and the
galaxy brain has a seizure as we all throw our weight around in unison,
crushing innocent lives, leaving those we hurt behind, forgetting them
as quickly as we forget about the outrage.
</p>
<p>
Or perhaps blogging is leaving a trail of blazing sparks, each one
sparking a fire in the next generation. Spending time reading blogs and
posts on social media has certainly changed me.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps I would have grown older differently without reading blogs and
blogging. And this is why I cannot stop blogging. To blog in that
half-shadow where perhaps our thoughts are read and perhaps they are
not, where every text lights up and shines and drops and sinks onto that
great pile where thousands of text are rotting, that is to participate
in the galaxy brain that is our world. Some of us can vote and some of
us can talk. Some of us can fight and some of us will weep. I try to
blog.
</p>
<p>
I try to blog to prove to myself that it was a struggle, that I tried to
think long and hard about things and that I tried to do the right thing.
I keep failing and so I must keep blogging.

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Writing about writing. Programming about programming. Meetings about

<a href="https://p1k3.com/2020/5/20/">meta meta</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
That quote seemed very appropriate for one of the two threads in my
posts. The other thread is about the audience and I got a comment on
that, too, by the same author:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Not that I have much to add here, but I do relate to this one. The
ongoing tension of these feelings contrasted with the sense that (as I’m
sure I’ve said many times before) existing in public seems almost
entirely unsupportable to me now. And yet: Nothing else has quite the
same power as writing for this audience you can never be sure of. The
one that might not even exist, but if it does might be all kinds of
things.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The pain of existing in public is a great way to put it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-03-08</strong>. How to overcome that impostor feeling where
you reread that text you wrote and you want to throw it away. Not worth
the electrons it was written with! But who’s doing the judging: you, or
that imagined audience I was talking about?
</p>
<p>
I think the point of blogging is for there to be a tiny, non-threatening
audience. And really, who is going to read my blog? Internet
stranger-friends, mutuals on fedi, those kinds of people. Maybe my
parents. (Hi mom!) I can always anonymoblog somewhere else if I’m
feeling anxious. Because writing in a paper notebook I don’t feel
judged. Surely there’s a similar place, online. The key is to find that
happy state where the imagined audience adds a little zest but not the
Twitter wolves or Hacker News, or whatever the particular blogging
nightmare might be.
</p>
<p>
For me, this imagined audience is more important than getting it right.
Which is why I write my blog posts with the wiki spirit. All these sites
are pretty similar, in essence. Blog, wiki, digital garden,
Zettelkasten, there’s not enough difference to draw lines. It’s all a
question of intent, of culture, of belonging. The blog spirit is to
write pages over time, and they disappear into the archive. The digital
garden spirit is to write unfinished articles and papers, to be refined
or not. The Zettelkasten spirit is to follow the trail of thoughts you
thought and add new branches, small notes with new thoughts leading to
more thoughts on new notes. And the wiki spirit is to write and edit
online, to hit the Save button and then it’s live. There is no editor,
there is no draft. Wiki is like brutalism in content management. I can
see the page sources and the end result is obvious and full of that old
web power. It’s not an app. The software has no idea of process. The
wiki spirit is to open that window, write the text and hit save. And
then I read it again, and edit it. And tomorrow, I read it again, and
edit it. And next week, perhaps, I read it again, and edit it.
</p>
<p>
I no longer live in the
<a href="https://communitywiki.org/wiki/WikiNow">Wiki Now</a>. The pages
are intended for future readers but they are not timeless. I add
timestamps all over the place. The blog spirit is strong. The pages do
disappear into the great compost of thoughts. The archive gobbles them
up. I do go back but I don’t rewrite the pages completely. I’m more
likely to simply add a timestamp and some thoughts like I did on this
page.
</p>
<p>
I do remove stuff I stumble across that I don’t like at all. I do leave
some bad things in there to remind me of bad decisions made, of bad
opinions held.
</p>
<p>
What I want to say, most of all, is that blog posts aren’t gems. They
are not precious books. They are not newspaper articles. They are not
job applications. And if I don’t like it tomorrow, I edit it. I revise
it. Or I write a new page saying how I learned something, or regret
something, or I add something. I add stuff to the bottom of pages or I
add new pages. What I don’t do is polish the old posts. There will be
more great posts in the future. The important part is the writing.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-03-09</strong>. I’m reading
<a href="http://perfors.net/blog/creation-ai/">The work of creation in
the age of AI</a> by Andrew Perfors and thinking about the part where
meaning is discussed.
</p>
<p>
Meaning without an audience:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
If I am writing an essay or diary entry to myself, the goal is …
generally to clarify my own thoughts, to identify flaws in my thinking,
or to distil the logic and motivations behind my ideas. I might have a
more emotional goal - I might want to vent to myself or to express a
feeling. I might want to improve my emotional regulation, feel better
about life, or change those feelings somehow.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
And then with an audience:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
… once I decided I might actually want to post it, I changed it in
important ways. I included a lot more explanation of things that were
clear in my head but I thought would be non-obvious to others (and, in
so doing, often I clarified them for myself too!). I fiddled with the
structure and the argument flow, took some things out, put others in.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I got an email from
<a class="account" href="https://merveilles.town/@bouncepaw" title="@bouncepaw@merveilles.town"><span
class="citation" data-cites="bouncepaw">@bouncepaw</span></a> with a
link to <a href="https://links.bouncepaw.com/1188">a reply</a>. Thanks!
</p>
<p>
This is how it starts:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
This article gets better every time I open it because Alex adds
something to it.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I wrote about my propensity to “add” to pages up above (I’m doing it
again!) and perhaps this would be a good place to talk about the two
“views” for this site: blog &amp; wiki.
</p>
<p>
A blog is organized by the timeline. The <a href="index">Home</a> page
lists all the pages in the order of their creation.
</p>
<p>
A wiki is organized by Recent Changes. The <a href="changes">Changes</a>
page lists all the pages recently edited (unless I unset a checkbox).
</p>
<p>
So this site has both natures. And both views have a feed:
<a href="index.rss">blog feed</a> &amp; <a href="changes.rss">wiki
feed</a>.
</p>
<p>
I think you need quite some wiki-affinity to subscribe to the wiki feed.
But it’s there for you.
</p>
<p>

Wins Best Picture at Academy Awards, Emma Stone Takes Best Actress</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Los Angeles — “Oppenheimer,” a solemn three-hour biopic that became
an unlikely billion-dollar box-office sensation, was crowned best
picture at a 96th Academy Awards that doubled as a coronation for
Christopher Nolan.</p>
<p>After passing over arguably Hollywood’s foremost big-screen auteur
for years, the Oscars made up for lost time by heaping seven awards on
Nolan’s blockbuster biopic, including best actor for Cillian Murphy,
best supporting actor for Robert Downey Jr. and best director for
Nolan.</p>
<p>In anointing “Oppenheimer,” the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and
Sciences did something it hasn’t done for more than a decade: hand its
top prize to a widely seen, big-budget studio film. In a film industry
where a cape, dinosaur or Tom Cruise has often been a requirement for
such box office, “Oppenheimer” brought droves of moviegoers to theaters
with a complex, fission-filled drama about J. Robert Oppenheimer and the
creation of the atomic bomb.</p>
<p>“For better or worse, we’re all living in Robert Oppenheimer’s
world,” said Murphy in his acceptance speech. “I’d like to dedicate this
to the peacemakers.”</p>
<p>As a film heavy with unease for human capacity for mass destruction,
“Oppenheimer” also emerged – even over its partner in cultural
phenomenon, “Barbie” – as a fittingly foreboding film for times rife
with cataclysm, man-made or not. Sunday’s Oscars at the Dolby Theatre in
Los Angeles unfolded against the backdrop of wars in Gaza and Ukraine,
and with a potentially momentous U.S. election on the horizon.</p>
<p>The most closely watched contest of the Academy Awards went to Emma
Stone, who won best best actress for her performance as Bella Baxter in
“Poor Things.”</p>
<p>In what was seen as the night’s most nail-biting category, Stone won
over Lily Gladstone of “Killers of the Flower Moon.” Gladstone would
have become the first Native American to win an Academy Award.</p>
<p>Instead, Oscar voters couldn’t resist the full-bodied extremes of
Stone’s “Poor Things” performance. The win for Stone, her second best
actress Oscar following her 2019 win for “La La Land,” confirmed the
35-year-old as arguably the preeminent big-screen actress of her
generation. The list of women to win best actress two or more times is
illustrious, including Katherine Hepburn, Frances McDormand, Ingrid
Bergman and Bette Davis.</p>
<p>“Oh, boy, this is really overwhelming,” said Stone.</p>
<p>Nolan has had many movies in the Oscar mix before, including
“Inception,” “Dunkirk” and “The Dark Knight.” But his win Sunday for
direction is the first Academy Award for the 53-year-old filmmaker.</p>
<p>In his acceptance speech, Nolan noted cinema is just over a hundred
years old.</p>
<p>“We don’t know where this incredible journey is going from here,”
said Nolan. “But to think that I’m a meaningful part of it means the
world to me.”</p>
<p>Protest and politics intruded on an election-year Academy Awards on
Sunday, where demonstrations for Gaza raged outside the Dolby Theatre in
Los Angeles, and awards went to “Oppenheimer,” “The Zone of Interest”
and “20 Days in Mariupol.”</p>
<p>Sunday’s broadcast, hosted by Jimmy Kimmel, had plenty of razzle
dazzle, including a sprawling song-and-dance rendition of the “Barbie”
hit “I’m Just Ken” by Ryan Gosling, with an assist on guitar by Slash. A
sea of Kens swarmed the stage.</p>
<p>The lead winner, as expected was “Oppenheimer,” the blockbuster
biopic. Though not quite the clean sweep that some expected,
“Oppenheimer” was overpowering all competition — including its
release-date companion, “Barbie” — winning awards for its
cinematography, editing, score and Robert Downey Jr.’s supporting
performance.</p>
<p>Downey, nominated twice before (for “Chaplin” and “Tropic Thunder”),
notched his first Oscar, crowning the illustrious second act of his
up-and-down career.</p>
<p>“I’d like to thank my terrible childhood and the academy, in that
order,” said Downey, the son of filmmaker Robert Downey Sr.</p>
<p>“Barbie,” last year’s biggest box-office hit with more than $1.4
billion in ticket sales, didn’t win an award until almost three hours
into the ceremony. It won best song (sorry, Ken) for Billie Eilish and
Finneas’ “What Was I Made For?” It’s their second Oscar, two years after
winning for their James Bond theme, “No Time to Die.”</p>
<p>But after an awards season that stayed largely inside a Hollywood
bubble, geopolitics played a prominent role. Protests over Israel’s war
in Gaza snarled traffic around the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles, slowing
stars’ arrival on the red carpet and turning the Oscar spotlight toward
the ongoing conflict. Some protesters shouted “Shame!” at those trying
to reach the awards.</p>
<p>Jonathan Glazer, the British filmmaker whose chilling Auschwitz drama
“The Zone of Interest” won best international film, drew connections
between the dehumanization depicted in his film and today.</p>
<p>“Right now, we stand here as men who refute their Jewishness and the
Holocaust being hijacked by an occupation which has led to conflict for
so many innocent people, whether the victims of October the 7th in
Israel, or the the ongoing attack on Gaza, all the victims, this
dehumanization, how do we resist?”</p>
<p>The war in Gaza was on the minds of many attendees, as was the war in
Ukraine. A year after “Navalny” won the same award, Mstyslav Chernov’s
“20 Days in Mariupol,” a harrowing chronicle of the early days of
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, won best documentary. The win, a first for
The Associated Press and PBS’ “Frontline,” came as the war in Ukraine
passed the two-year mark with no signs of abating.</p>
<p>Mstyslav Chernov, the Ukrainian filmmaker and AP journalist whose
hometown was bombed the day he learned of his Oscar nomination, spoke
forcefully about Russia’s invasion.</p>
<p>“This is the first Oscar in Ukrainian history,” said Chernov. “And
I’m honored. Probably I will be the first director on this stage to say
I wish I’d never made this film. I wish to be able to exchange this
(for) Russia never attacking Ukraine.”</p>
<p>In the early going, Yorgos Lanthimos’ Frankenstein-riff “Poor Things”
ran away with three prizes for its sumptuous craft, including awards for
production design, makeup and hairstyling and costume design.</p>
<p>Kimmel, hosting the ABC telecast for the fourth time, opened the
awards with a monologue that drew a few cold looks (from Downey, Sandra
Hüller and Messi, the dog from best-picture nominee “Anatomy of a
Fall”). But Kimmel, emphasizing Hollywood as “a union town” following
2023’s actor and writer strikes, drew a standing ovation for bringing
out teamsters and behind-the-scenes workers — who are now entering their
own labor negotiations.</p>
<p>The night’s first award was one of its most predictable: Da’Vine Joy
Randolph for best supporting actress, for her performance in Alexander
Payne’s “The Holdovers.” An emotional Randolph was accompanied to the
stage by her “Holdovers” co-star Paul Giamatti.</p>
<p>“For so long I’ve always wanted to be different,” said Randolph. “And
now I realize I just need to be myself.”</p>
<p>Though Randolph’s win was widely expected, an upset quickly followed.
Hayao Miyazaki’s “The Boy and the Heron” won for best animated feature,
a surprise over the slightly favored “Spider-Man: Across the
Spider-Verse.” Miyazaki, the 83-year-old Japanese anime master who came
out of retirement to make “The Boy and the Heron,” didn’t attend the
ceremony. He also didn’t attend the 2003 Oscars when his “Spirited Away”
won the same award.</p>
<p>Best original screenplay went to “Anatomy of a Fall,” which, like
“Barbie,” was penned by a couple: director Justine Triet and Arthur
Harari. “This will help me through my midlife crisis, I think,” said
Triet.</p>
<p>In adapted screenplay, where “Barbie” was nominated — and where some
suspected Greta Gerwig would win after being overlooked for director —
the Oscar went to Cord Jefferson, who wrote and directed his feature
film debut “American Fiction.” He pleaded for executives to take risks
on young filmmakers like himself.</p>
<p>“Instead of making a $200 million movie, try making 20 $10 million
movies,” said Jefferson, previously an award-winning TV writer.</p>
<p>The Oscars belonged largely to theatrical-first films. Though it came
into the awards with 19 nominations, Netflix was a bit player. Its lone
win came for live action short: Wes Anderson’s “The Wonderful Story of
Henry Sugar,” based on the story by Roald Dahl.</p>
<p>While “Barbie” bested (and helped lift) “Oppenheimer” at the box
office, it took a back seat to Nolan’s film at the Oscars. Gerwig was
notably overlooked for best director, sparking an outcry that some, even
Hillary Clinton, said mimicked the patriarchy parodied in the film.</p>

<h2 id="few-female-lawmakers-in-us-statehouses">Few Female Lawmakers in
US Statehouses</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CHARLESTON, W.Va — Democrat Kayla Young and Republican Patricia
Rucker frequently clash on abortion rights and just about everything
else in West Virginia’s Legislature, but they agree on one thing: Too
few of their colleagues are women, and it’s hurting the state.</p>
<p>“There are exceptions to every single rule, but I think in general,
men do kind of see this as their field,” said Rucker, part of the GOP’s
Senate supermajority that passed one of the nation’s strictest abortion
bans while Young — the lone Democratic woman elected to the House —
opposed it.</p>
<p>Nearly 130 years since the first three women were elected to state
legislative offices in the U.S., women remain massively underrepresented
in state legislatures.</p>
<p>In 10 states, women make up less than 25% of their state
legislatures, according to Rutgers’ Center for American Women in
Politics. West Virginia is at the very bottom of that list, having just
16 women in its 134-member Legislature, or just under 12%. That’s
compared with Nevada, where women occupy just over 60% of state
legislative seats. Similarly low numbers can be found in the nearby
southern states of Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee and
Louisiana.</p>
<p>“It’s absolutely wild to know that more than 50 percent of the
population of West Virginia are women, and sometimes I’m the only woman
that’s on a committee, period,” said Young, currently the only woman on
the House Artificial Intelligence Committee and was one of just two on
the House Judiciary Committee when it greenlighted the state’s near
total abortion ban.</p>
<p>The numbers of women filling legislative seats across the U.S. have
remained low despite women registering and voting at higher rates than
men in every presidential election since 1980 — and across virtually
every demographic, including race, education level and socioeconomic
status.</p>
<p>For the last three decades, voters have demonstrated a willingness to
cast ballots for women. But they didn’t have the opportunity to do so
because women weren’t running, said Jennifer Lawless, chair of the
politics department at the University of Virginia.</p>
<p>“The gender gap in political ambition is just as large now as it was
then,” said Lawless, adding that women are much less likely to get
recruited to run for office or think they’re qualified to run in what
they perceive as a hostile political environment.</p>
<p>And those running in southern, conservative states — still mostly
Democratic women, data show — aren’t winning as those states continue to
overwhelmingly elect Republicans.</p>
<p>In 2022, 39 women ran as their party’s nominee for state legislative
seats in West Virginia, and 26 were Democrats. Only two of the
Democratic candidates won, compared to 11 out of 13 of the
Republicans.</p>
<p>Debbie Walsh, director of Rutgers’ Center for American Women in
Politics, said there’s more money, infrastructure and support for
recruiting and running Democratic female candidates. The Republican
Party often shies away from talking about what is labeled or dismissed
as “identity politics,’” she said.</p>
<p>“It’s a belief in a kind of meritocracy and, ‘the best candidate will
rise. And if it’s a woman, great.’ They don’t say, ‘We don’t want women,
but if it’s a man, that’s fine, too,’” she said. “There’s no sort of
value in and of itself seen in the diversity.”</p>
<p>Larissa Martinez, founder and president of Women’s Public Leadership
Network, one of only a few right-leaning U.S. organizations solely
supporting female candidates, said identity politics within the GOP is a
big hurdle to her work. Part of her organization’s slogan is, “we are
pro-women without being anti-man.”</p>
<p>In 2020, small-town public school teacher Amy Grady pulled off a huge
political upset when she defeated then-Senate President Mitch Carmichael
in West Virginia’s Republican primary, following back-to-back years of
strikes in which school employees packed into the state Capitol.</p>
<p>Carmichael took in more than $127,000 in contributions compared to
Grady’s self-funded war chest of just over $2,000. Still, Grady won by
fewer than 1,000 votes.</p>
<p>“It’s just you’re told constantly, ‘You can’t, you can’t, you can’t
do it,’” said Grady, who has now risen through the ranks to become chair
of the Senate Education Committee. “And it’s just like, why give it a
shot?”</p>
<p>Tennessee state Sen. Charlane Oliver says she didn’t have many
resources when she first raised her hand to run for political office.
She had to rely on grassroots activism and organizing to win her 2022
election.</p>
<p>Yet securing the seat was just part of the battle. Oliver, a
41-year-old Black Democratic woman, is frequently tasked with providing
the only outside perspective inside for the Republican supermajority
Legislature.</p>
<p>“They don’t have any incentive to listen to me, but I view my seat as
disruption and give you a perspective that you may not have heard
before,” she said.</p>
<p>Many male-dominant statehouses have enacted strict abortion bans in
GOP-controlled states since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v.
Wade in 2022. For many female lawmakers, this trend has meant sharing
deeply personal stories surrounding abortion and childbirth.</p>
<p>In South Carolina, the abortion debate resulted in an unlikely
coalition of women banding together to filibuster a near-total abortion
ban. The five female senators — three Republicans, two Democrats and one
independent — quickly became known as the “sister senators” as they took
turns describing pregnancy complications, the dangers surrounding
limited access to contraceptives and the reproductive system.</p>
<p>Their actions were met with praise from national leaders, but at
home, the consequences have been swift. The Republican women received
censures and promises of primary challenges in this year’s
elections.</p>
<p>Women also have championed gun policy, education, health care, and
housing proposals.</p>
<p>Recently, some states have allowed candidates to make childcare an
allowable expense for campaign finance purposes. Young was the sponsor
of her state’s law — one of her priorities during her first session in
the Capitol in the minority party.</p>
<p>During Young’s first term in office, she relied on a family member
who would care for her two young children while he was at the state
Capitol. But she was left without a solution last year when that
caregiver passed away unexpectedly days before the session. Her husband,
who works in television production, had to stay home and didn’t work for
two months, meaning the family lost out on his income.</p>
<p>Young’s bill won the vote of Rucker, the first Hispanic woman elected
to the West Virginia Senate. She too has had to juggle the challenges of
being a working mom. She left her job as a teacher to homeschool her
five children, and the family relied on her husband’s salary as a
pediatric nurse to make ends meet.</p>
<p>“I ran for office because I feel like having that voice is actually
really important — someone who lives paycheck to paycheck,” said Rucker,
a first-generation U.S. citizen who made the difficult decision to pull
her kids. “I’m not here because of a title, I’m not here because of a
position, I’m here to do my job, and I want to do the best I can.”</p>

panel unanimously approves bill that could ban TikTok</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>A powerful House committee advanced a bill on Thursday that could
lead to a nationwide ban against TikTok on all electronic devices,
renewing lawmakers’ challenge to one of the world’s most popular social
media apps and highlighting unresolved fears that TikTok may pose a
Chinese government spying risk. The measure that sailed unanimously
through the House Energy and Commerce Committee would prohibit TikTok
from US app stores unless the social media platform — used by roughly
170 million Americans — is quickly spun off from its China-linked parent
company, ByteDance. ↫ Brian Fung at CNN TikTok obviously needs to be
banned. It’s an extension of a genocidal, totalitarian government that
has no place on our our phones. Yes, I understand Facebook, Apple,
Google, Microsoft also collect vast amounts of data, but at least they
are (nominally) beholden to our legal systems, and while there is, of
course, a vast power imbalance between us as individuals and them as
megacorporations, it’s still nowhere even close as to being an arm of a
totalitarian government – they’re just not comparable. China’s state
surveillance tools have no place on our devices.</p>

Shanghai Zhenhua Denies Posing Cybersecurity Risk to US Ports</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Beijing, China — Shanghai Zhenhua Heavy Industries, or ZPMC, said on
Sunday its cranes do not pose a cybersecurity threat, after U.S.
congressional committees questioned the Chinese state-owned company’s
work on cranes bound for the United States.</p>
<p>The House of Representatives’ security panels, scrutinizing ZPMC’s
installation of Swiss engineering group ABB’s equipment onto U.S.-bound
ship-to-shore cranes, in January invited ABB executives to public
hearings to clarify its relationship with ZPMC, which they said raised
“significant concerns.”</p>
<p>“ZPMC takes the U.S. concerns seriously and believes that these
reports can easily mislead the public without sufficient factual
review,” it said in a filing, referring to the probe by the Homeland
Security and Strategic Competition committees.</p>
<p>“The cranes provided by ZPMC do not pose a cybersecurity risk to any
ports,” it said.</p>
<p>ABB has said it sold its control and electrification equipment to
many crane manufacturers, including Chinese companies, which in turn
sold cranes directly to U.S. ports.</p>
<p>The U.S. and China, the world’s biggest economies, frequently accuse
each other of cyberattacks and industrial espionage. Washington this
year said it had disrupted a Chinese cyber-spying operation targeting
U.S. infrastructure and was investigating Chinese vehicle imports for
national security risks. It previously barred Chinese telecom
companies.</p>
<p>ZPMC said the cranes it supplies are used in ports around the world,
including the United States, and comply with international standards and
applicable laws and regulations.</p>
<p>Listed on the Shanghai stock exchange, ZPMC is one of the largest
port machinery manufacturers in the world, owning a fleet of more than
20 transportation vessels, according to its website.</p>
<p>ABB generates 16% of its sales from China, second only to the U.S.
market at 24%.</p>

id="some-fans-at-frigid-kansas-city-nfl-playoff-game-underwent-amputations">Some
Fans at Frigid Kansas City NFL Playoff Game Underwent Amputations</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Kansas City, Missouri — Some of the people who attended the
near-record cold Kansas City Chiefs playoff game in January had to
undergo amputations after suffering frostbite, a Missouri hospital said
Friday.</p>
<p>Research Medical Center didn’t provide exact numbers but said in a
statement that it treated dozens of people who had experienced frostbite
during an 11-day cold snap in January. Twelve of those people —
including some who were at the Jan. 13 game — had to undergo amputations
involving mostly fingers and toes. And the hospital said more surgeries
are expected over the next two to four weeks as “injuries evolve.”</p>
<p>The University of Kansas hospital said it also treated frostbite
victims after the game but didn’t report any amputations.</p>
<p>The temperature for the Dolphins-Chiefs wild-card playoff game was
minus 20 Celsius, and wind gusts made for a windchill of minus 33 C.
That shattered the record for the coldest game in Arrowhead Stadium
history, which had been minus 17 C, set in a 1983 game against Denver
and matched in 2016 against Tennessee.</p>
<p>The wild-card game was played the same day the Buffalo Bills were
supposed to host the Pittsburgh Steelers, but that game was pushed back
a day because a blizzard dumped more than half a meter of snow in New
York and made traveling to the game too dangerous.</p>
<p>The game in Kansas City went on as scheduled because the frigid
weather didn’t present similar problems getting to Arrowhead Stadium,
even though the National Weather Service warned of “dangerously cold”
windchills.</p>
<p>Frostbite can occur on exposed skin within 30 minutes, Dr. Megan
Garcia, the medical director of the Grossman Burn Center at Research,
said in a statement that answered one of the top questions she is asked.
The timing can be even shorter if there is a windchill, she said.</p>
<p>Fans were allowed to bring heated blankets into the stadium and small
pieces of cardboard to place under their feet on the cold concrete.</p>
<p>The coldest game in NFL history remains minus 25 C for the 1967 NFL
championship, when the Packers beat the Cowboys at Lambeau Field in a
game that came to be known as the Ice Bowl. The windchill that day was
minus minus 44 C.</p>
<p>The Chiefs didn’t immediately respond to email messages from The
Associated Press seeking comment.</p>

the Mac – where the <i>Finder</i> is the app you spend a lot of time in.
So Frontier was a good name simply because it was two syllables and
began with F. I know it’s weird. It’s also why FeedLand feels like a
homey name to me. :-)</p>

id="kung-fu-panda-4-opens-no.-1-at-box-office-dune-part-two-lingers">‘Kung
Fu Panda 4’ Opens No. 1 at Box Office, ‘Dune: Part Two’ Lingers</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Los Angeles — As Universal Pictures prepared for a big night at the
Academy Awards with “Oppenheimer,” the studio also celebrated the No. 1
debut of “Kung Fu Panda 4,” which collected $58.3 million in domestic
theaters over the weekend, according to estimates Sunday.</p>
<p>“Kung Fu Panda 4,” the first film in the DreamWorks Animation
franchise since the third installment in 2016, got off to a better start
than all but the 2008 original. That “Kung Fu Panda,” which began the
mystical adventures of Jack Black’s panda warrior Po, launched with
$60.2 million.</p>
<p>Working in favor of “Kung Fu Panda 4”: It’s the first big family
movie since “Migration” and “Wonka” hit theaters in December. “Kung Fu
Panda 4” added $22 million internationally.</p>
<p>The news was just as good for last week’s top film, “Dune: Part Two.”
Denis Villeneuve’s sci-fi epic sequel held strongly in its second week,
dropping a modest 44%. It grossed $46 million in its second week,
bringing its domestic cumulative total to $157 million for Warner
Bros. and Legendary Pictures.</p>
<p>Riding strong reviews, great word-of-mouth and plenty of sandworms,
“Dune: Part Two” appears well set up for a long theatrical run. Most of
Sunday’s Oscar nominees have already moved on to home viewing platforms,
but “Dune” could wind up at next year’s Academy Awards.</p>
<p>Opening in third place was the Lionsgate, Blumhouse horror release
“Imaginary,” about a sinister teddy bear. It debuted with $10
million.</p>
<p>Following it was “Cabrini,” a portrait of the 19th century Catholic
missionary Saint Frances Xavier Cabrini (played by Cristiana Dell’Anna).
The film, released by the Christian-based company Angel Studios, the
studio behind the 2023 surprise hit “Sound of Freedom,” collected $7.5
million.</p>
<p>A24 also debuted the critically acclaimed neo-noir “Love Lies
Bleeding,” starring Kristen Stewart, on five screens in New York and Los
Angeles. It grossed $167,463 for a good per-screen average of
$33,493.</p>
<p>Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian
theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released
Monday.</p>

rolling their way across Europe for the last decade, e-bikes are now
surging in popularity in North America.

But while you’ll see plenty of people espousing the supposed advantages

id="oscars-underway-in-hollywood-with-oppenheimer-the-odds-on-favorite">Oscars
Underway in Hollywood, With ‘Oppenheimer’ the Odds-on Favorite</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Los Angeles — Hollywood’s glitterati gather on Sunday to celebrate
the best performances in film at the annual Academy Awards, a ceremony
expected to turn into a toast to blockbuster atomic bomb drama
“Oppenheimer.”</p>
<p>Talk show host Jimmy Kimmel returns for the fourth time to emcee the
film industry’s highest honors from the Dolby Theatre in Los
Angeles.</p>
<p>“Oppenheimer,” the three-hour drama directed by Christopher Nolan,
leads the field with 13 nominations. The movie is the frontrunner to win
the prestigious best picture prize, capping its sweep of other major
awards this year.</p>
<p>“If the best picture isn’t ‘Oppenheimer,’ it will be one of the
biggest upsets, if not the biggest upset, in the history of the Oscars,”
said Scott Feinberg, executive editor for awards at The Hollywood
Reporter.</p>
<p>After 2023 was marred by actors and writers strikes, the Oscars give
Hollywood a chance to celebrate two global hits. “Oppenheimer” and
feminist doll adventure “Barbie,” another best picture nominee, brought
in a combined $2.4 billion in a summer box office battle dubbed
“Barbenheimer.”</p>
<p>Oscar producers said they have planned unannounced cameos and other
surprises to entertain audiences at home.</p>
<p>“My biggest hope is that they go through a range of emotions with us,
that they feel happiness and joy, that we maybe make them shed a tear,”
Executive Producer Raj Kapoor said. “And then they somehow feel
connected and inspired to also live their dreams.”</p>
<p>Supporting actor nominee Ryan Gosling will sing the ’80s-style rock
anthem “I’m Just Ken” from “Barbie.” Members of the Osage Nation will
perform the nominated “Wahzhazhe (A Song for My People)” from “Killers
of the Flower Moon.”</p>
<p>Cillian Murphy, the Irish actor who played physicist J. Robert
Oppenheimer as he led the race to build the first atomic bomb, is
considered the favorite for best actor. Murphy’s main competition,
according to awards pundits, is “The Holdovers” star Paul Giamatti.</p>
<p>Best actress may go to Lily Gladstone of “Killers of the Flower
Moon,” the real-life story about a murder plot to take over lucrative
Osage oil rights in 1920s Oklahoma. If she prevails, Gladstone would be
the first Native American actress to win an acting Oscar.</p>
<p>Gladstone’s rivals include previous Oscar winner Emma Stone,
nominated this year for playing a woman revived from the dead in the
dark and wacky comedy “Poor Things.”</p>
<p>The supporting actor race features “Oppenheimer” star Robert Downey
Jr., who played the scientist’s professional nemesis, and Sterling K.
Brown from “American Fiction.”</p>
<p>Da’Vine Joy Randolph, praised for her role as a grieving mother in
“The Holdovers,” vies for best supporting actress against Danielle
Brooks from “The Color Purple” and others.</p>
<p>“Barbie,” last year’s No. 1 film with $1.4 billion in global ticket
sales, may be shut out of the top awards. Billie Eilish’s “Barbie”
ballad “What Was I Made For?” is likely to win the original song prize,
Feinberg said, and could snag the awards for costumes and production
design.</p>
<p>For Nolan, the night could bring his first directing Oscar, as well
as the award for adapted screenplay. The director of “The Dark Knight”
trilogy, “Inception” and other acclaimed films has never had a movie win
best picture.</p>
<p>The ceremony may end with “the industry-wide coronation for
Christopher Nolan,” Feinberg said. With “Oppenheimer,” “he has he has
made his best possible argument yet for why he is worthy of this
recognition.”</p>

incident 12604</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>When this command line option is used with curl on macOS, the version
shipped by Apple, it seems to fall back and checks the system CA store
in case the provided set of CA certs fail the verification. A secondary
check that was not asked for, is not documented and plain frankly comes
completely by surprise. Therefore, when a user runs the check with a
trimmed and dedicated CA cert file, it will not fail if the system CA
store contains a cert that can verify the server! This is a security
problem because now suddenly certificate checks pass that should not
pass. ↫ Daniel Stenberg Absolutely wild that Apple does not consider
this a security issue.</p>

Military Airlifts Embassy Personnel From Haiti, Bolsters Security</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The U.S. military said on Sunday it has carried out an
operation in Haiti to airlift non-essential embassy personnel from the
country and added U.S. forces bolster embassy security, as Caribbean
nation reels under a state of emergency.</p>
<p>The operation was the latest sign of Haiti’s troubles as gang
violence threatens to bring down the government and has led thousands to
flee their homes.</p>
<p>“This airlift of personnel into and out of the embassy is consistent
with our standard practice for embassy security augmentation worldwide,
and no Haitians were on board the military aircraft,” the U.S.
military’s Southern Command said in a statement.</p>
<p>Haiti entered a state of emergency last Sunday after fighting
escalated while Prime Minister Ariel Henry was in Nairobi seeking a deal
for the long-delayed U.N.-backed mission.</p>
<p>Kenya announced last year it would lead the force but months of
domestic legal wrangling have effectively placed the mission on
hold.</p>
<p>On Saturday, the U.S. State Department said Secretary of State Antony
Blinken spoke with Kenyan President William Ruto about the Haiti crisis
and the two men underscored their commitment to a multinational security
mission to restore order.</p>
<p>In Southern Command’s statement, it said Washington remained
committed to those goals.</p>
<p>“Our embassy remains focused on advancing U.S. government efforts to
support the Haitian people, including mobilizing support for the Haitian
National Police, expediting the deployment of the United
Nations-authorized Multinational Security Support (MSS) mission and
accelerating a peaceful transition of power via free and fair
elections,” it said.</p>

Ship With Equipment for Building a Pier Is on Its Way to Gaza</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — A U.S. Army vessel carrying equipment for
building a temporary pier in Gaza was on its way to the Mediterranean on
Sunday, three days after U.S. President Joe Biden announced plans to
ramp up aid deliveries by sea to the besieged enclave where hundreds of
thousands of Palestinians have been going hungry.</p>
<p>The opening of the sea corridor, along with airdrops by the U.S.,
Jordan and others, showed increasing alarm over Gaza’s humanitarian
crisis and a new willingness to bypass Israeli control over land
shipments.</p>
<p>Israel said it welcomed the sea deliveries and would inspect
Gaza-bound cargo before it leaves a staging area in nearby Cyprus. The
daily number of aid trucks entering Gaza by land over the past five
months has been far below the 500 that entered before the war because of
Israeli restrictions and security issues.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Biden stepped up his public criticism of Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Biden said he believes Netanyahu is
“hurting Israel more than helping Israel” in how he is approaching its
war against Hamas in Gaza, now in its sixth month.</p>
<p>Speaking Saturday to MSNBC’s Jonathan Capehart, the president
expressed support for Israel’s right to pursue Hamas after the
militants’ October 7 attack on southern Israel but said that Netanyahu
“must pay more attention to the innocent lives being lost as a
consequence of the actions taken.” He added that “you cannot have 30,000
more Palestinians dead.”</p>
<p>In Gaza, Palestinian casualties continued to rise.</p>
<p>The Civil Defense Department said at least nine Palestinians,
including children, were killed in an Israeli airstrike on a house in
Gaza City late Saturday.</p>
<p>Footage shared by the civil defense showed first responders pulling
out the dead and injured trapped in the collapsed house. One rescuer was
seen holding a dead infant, before placing the limp body on a sofa amid
the wreckage.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the bodies of 13 people, including women and children,
were taken to the main hospital in the central town of Deir al-Balah on
Sunday, according to an Associated Press journalist. Relatives said the
13 were killed by Israeli artillery fire toward a large tent camp for
displaced Palestinians in the coastal area east of the southern city of
Khan Younis.</p>
<p>Israel rarely comments on specific incidents during the war. It has
held that Hamas is responsible for civilian casualties because the
militant group operates from within civilian areas.</p>
<p>The Health Ministry in Gaza said Saturday that at least 30,960
Palestinians have been killed since the war began. It doesn’t
differentiate between civilians and combatants in its count but says
women and children make up two-thirds of the dead. The ministry is part
of the Hamas-run government, and its figures from previous wars have
largely matched those of the U.N. and independent experts.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, U.S. efforts got under way to set up the temporary pier in
Gaza for the sea deliveries. U.S. Central Command said a first U.S. Army
vessel, the General Frank S. Besson, left a base in Virginia on Saturday
and was on its way to the Eastern Mediterranean with equipment for pier
construction.</p>
<p>United States officials said it will likely be weeks before the pier
is operational.</p>
<p>The sea corridor is backed by the EU together with the United States,
the United Arab Emirates and other countries. The European Commission
has said that U.N. agencies and the Red Cross will also play a role.</p>
<p>A ship belonging to Spain’s Open Arms aid group was expected to make
a pilot voyage to test the corridor as early as this weekend. The ship
has been waiting at Cyprus’s port of Larnaca.</p>
<p>Open Arms founder Oscar Camps has said the ship, which is pulling a
barge with 200 tons of rice and flour, would take two to three days to
arrive at an undisclosed location.</p>
<p>A member of the charity World Central Kitchen, which is also involved
in the test run, said in a post on X that once the barge reaches Gaza,
the aid would be off-loaded by a crane, be placed on trucks and driven
to northern Gaza, which has been largely cut off from aid shipments.</p>
<p>Senior aid officials have warned that air and sea deliveries can’t
make up for a shortage of supply routes on land.</p>
<p>The new push for getting more aid in came on the eve of the Muslim
holy month of Ramadan, which follows a lunar calendar and could start as
early as Sunday evening, depending on the sighting of a crescent
moon.</p>
<p>Israel declared war on October 7 after Hamas militants attacked
southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians and taking
250 hostages. Israel’s blistering air and ground offensive has
devastated large parts of Gaza, displaced about 80% of the population of
2.3 million and set off a worsening humanitarian crisis.</p>
<p>The U.S. and regional mediators Egypt and Qatar had hoped to have a
six-week cease-fire in place by the start of Ramadan, but talks appeared
to be stalled, with Hamas holding out for assurances that a temporary
truce will lead to an end of hostilities.</p>
<p>Mediators had hoped to alleviate some of the immediate crisis with
the temporary cease-fire, which would have seen Hamas release some of
the Israeli hostages it’s holding, Israel release some Palestinian
prisoners and aid groups be given access for a major influx of
assistance into Gaza.</p>

<h2 id="transit-crime-back-as-a-top-concern-in-some-us-cities">Transit
Crime Back as a Top Concern in Some US Cities</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Fear of crime on subways and buses is back as a top
concern in some U.S. cities, and so are efforts to persuade the public
officials take the issue seriously.</p>
<p>New York’s governor said Wednesday she would task 750 members of the
National Guard with helping patrol the nation’s busiest subway system,
saying she felt New York City police needed reinforcements after a
shooting on a train platform and a conductor getting slashed in the
neck.</p>
<p>In Pennsylvania, legislators created a special prosecutor to go after
crimes committed in the transit system that serves the southeast of the
state. Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker on Thursday promised to beef
up police patrols and use “every legal and constitutional tool” after a
spate of transit-related shootings left three dead and 12 wounded, many
of them schoolchildren.</p>
<p>“Enough is enough,” she said on WURD radio.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether such moves will have any effect on
reducing crime in these massive public transit systems.</p>
<p>At least in New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul acknowledged that calling in
the National Guard was as much about soothing fears and making a
political statement as it was about making mass transit safer. The
city’s subways, the Democrat said, were quite safe already. And felony
crime hasn’t risen significantly. But a show of force might help dispel
anxieties more than any statistic, she reasoned.</p>
<p>“If you feel better walking past someone in a uniform to make sure
that someone doesn’t bring a knife or a gun on the subway, then that’s
exactly why I did it. I want to change the psychology around crime in
New York City,” Hochul said Thursday on MSNBC. “It is safe. But I’m
going to make sure people feel safe.”</p>
<p>“I’m also going to demonstrate that Democrats fight crime as well,”
she added. “So this narrative that Republicans have said that we’re soft
on crime, that we defund the police — no.”</p>
<p>Major crimes in the New York City transit system dropped nearly 3%
from 2022 to 2023 – with five killings last year, down from 10 the year
prior, according to police. Overall, violent crime in the subway system
is rare, with train cars and stations being generally as safe as any
other public place.</p>
<p>In Pennsylvania, overall crime has declined on the transit system in
recent years, though the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation
Authority, or SEPTA, reported six killings in 2023, up from a total of
seven during the previous three years.</p>
<p>Still, the issue of safety on buses and trains is one that keeps
resonating with voters — particularly as some systems recover from the
COVID-19 pandemic, when passengers stayed away.</p>
<p>“Recently yeah, it’s been a little unsafe. So I think they should
kind of, like, control it before it gets out of hand,” said New York
City resident Alan Uloa, 43. “Just people, the way people react to
stuff. People just fighting over seats. The other day they slashed the
conductor, and that’s not cool.”</p>
<p>In New York, Republicans hammered Democrats on crime during the 2022
midterms, a message that helped the GOP capture suburban congressional
seats.</p>
<p>Alex Piquero, a criminology professor at the University of Miami and
the former director of the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics, said
the heightened law enforcement presence can be a double-edged sword.</p>
<p>“For some people, they’d like to see the added security. They feel
safer simply because there’s an officer there,” he said. “And for other
people, they’ll say we’re overreacting.”</p>
<p>Vincent Del Castillo, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal
Justice and a former chief of New York City’s transit police, said the
political tough talk glosses over the reality that transit crime
accounts for just a tiny percentage of all crime.</p>
<p>“You can have 10 to 12 murders in the system when there are literally
hundreds across the city, but because it’s so rare, it gets a lot of
attention,” he said.</p>
<p>The four shootings on or linked to public transit facilities in
Philadelphia began Sunday, when a man was fatally shot by another
passenger shortly after they got off a bus. The next day, a teenager was
killed and four people injured in gunfire at a bus stop. On Tuesday,
police said, someone who had gotten off a bus fired back inside, killing
a man.</p>
<p>And on Wednesday, eight teenagers waiting to take a city bus home
after school were shot in an attack that also riddled a bus with bullet
holes.</p>
<p>SEPTA police Chief Charles Lawson has promised transit officers will
take an aggressive approach, using “every criminal code on the book” in
order to crackdown on illegal gun possession on the transit system.</p>
<p>“We’re going to target individuals concealing their identity. We’re
going to target fare evasion. We’re going to target open drug use,” he
said this week.</p>
<p>The National Guard troops in New York City won’t be that active. They
have been tasked with helping police conduct random searches of people’s
bags as they enter the subway system, a practice in place for nearly two
decades.</p>
<p>Passengers have the right to refuse the search, though if they do
they are asked to leave the subway system.</p>
<p>The National Guard troops can’t make arrests, but if they witness a
crime, they can detain someone until police arrive, just as any civilian
can do.</p>
<p>Even though the Guard troops were deployed Thursday, New York City
transit passengers might not have noticed. The troops weren’t widely
visible at stations or in trains, though some were seen patrolling major
hubs including Grand Central Terminal and Penn Station, where they have
been a regular presence since the September 11, 2001, terror
attacks.</p>
<p>Riders have long been split over the police bag checks, which are
infrequent, but can hold someone up as they race for the train. They
have also long been a subject of concerns about racial profiling, though
the NYPD says it takes steps to avoid it.</p>
<p>“Sometimes when I’m in a hurry and I have a bag, I don’t like to be
stopped,” said Jerome Brooks Jr., 44, an actor and musician. “So then I
try to see, do they stop me if they’re going to stop somebody else that
doesn’t look like me? But in general, I hope they do what’s right.”</p>
<p>Cheryl Ann Harper, 46, said she welcomed the precaution.</p>
<p>“Yes, it is random and we need it,” she said, noting that similar
checks are common at theaters. “I do it all the time. OK? Not a big
deal. You know, if you don’t have anything to hide, why you can’t open
up your bag?”</p>

Louisiana’s Crawfish Shortage, Governor Issues Disaster Declaration</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BATON ROUGE, Louisiana — Amid a crawfish shortage in Louisiana, the
nation’s top producer of the crustaceans that are a staple in Gulf Coast
seafood boils, Governor Jeff Landry issued a disaster declaration for
the impacted industry Wednesday. </p>
<p>Last year’s drought, extreme heat, saltwater intrusion on the
Mississippi River and a hard winter freeze in the Bayou State have
devastated this year’s crawfish harvest and led to significant price
hikes for those purchasing “mudbugs.” Landry said the shortage is
affecting not only Louisiana’s economy but also “our way of life.” </p>
<p>“All 365,000 crawfish acres in Louisiana have been affected by these
conditions,” Landry said in a written statement Wednesday. “That is why
I am issuing a disaster declaration. The crawfish industry needs all the
support it can get right now.” </p>
<p>Landry’s disaster declaration, which is the legal underpinning that
assists in securing federal resources, came shortly after a request from
Louisiana’s congressional delegation seeking to unlock federal aid to
help farmers back in their home state. </p>
<p>During a typical year, Louisiana generates 175 million to 200 million
pounds of crawfish — contributing $500 million to the state’s economy
annually, according to the governor’s office. </p>
<p>However, amid severe drought in 2023 and extreme heat, typically one
of the wettest states in the country saw some of its driest conditions.
As a result, the weather dried out the soil where crawfish burrow to lay
eggs. </p>
<p>Louisiana State University’s Agriculture Center estimates the
potential losses to the state’s crawfish industry to be nearly $140
million. </p>
<p>“Louisiana’s crawfish industry is more than an economic driver for
our state — it is a deep part of our cultural heritage,” said Mike
Strain, commissioner of the Louisiana Department of Agriculture and
Forestry. </p>
<p>Crawfish, which have been harvested commercially in the state since
at least the 1800s, are usually plentiful in Louisiana during the late
winter and through the spring. </p>
<p>The tail meat, fresh or frozen, of the tiny lobster-like crustaceans
are used in a variety of dishes, including crawfish etouffee, gumbos and
po’ boy sandwiches. But the most popular way to serve them is boiled
with corn and potatoes and a variety of seasonings. Crawfish boils,
which see pounds of the freshly cooked crustaceans poured onto communal
tables, are popular during Carnival season and during Lent, when many in
heavily Catholic south Louisiana seek alternatives to meat. </p>
<p>But this year, Strain said, some Mardi Gras celebrations continued
without chowing down on crawfish, which were scarce and unaffordable for
many. </p>
<p>Around this time last year, the cost for a pound of boiled crawfish
was $3 to $5. Now, restaurants across the state are selling them for $10
to $12 per pound, as reported by The Advocate in Baton Rouge. </p>
<p>In a letter last week to U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack,
Strain said: “For the first time in many years, due to sustained drought
in 2023 and freezing temperatures in early 2024, crawfish are simply
unavailable.”</p>

Museum Reveals Complex Heritage of Cambodian Art</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — Six years ago, Nachiket Chanchani visited Angkor Wat for
the first time. Inspired, the architectural historian began thinking
about the relationship between the complexities of modern post-genocide
Cambodia and the ancient temple complex.</p>
<p>Chanchani, an associate art history professor at the University of
Michigan, kept reflecting on Angkor Wat, juxtaposing the temple complex
against art created since the Khmer Rouge killed nearly 2 million
Cambodians between 1975 and 1979.</p>
<p>During the pandemic, his thoughts crystallized amid worldwide
suffering, anxiety and fear. “I thought that this art, both from the
deep past and from more recent times in Cambodia, can teach us lessons
of how to kind of stay stable, find some way forward,” he told VOA Khmer
Service via Zoom.</p>
<p>The University of Michigan Museum of Art, or UMMA, one of the largest
university museums in the United States, is now exhibiting 80 pieces of
Cambodian art in a show guest curated by Chanchani in Ann Arbor. Titled
“Angkor Complex: Cultural Heritage and Post-Genocide Memory in
Cambodia,” it opened February 3 and runs through July 28. Featured
artists Vann Nath, Sopheap Pich, Svay Sareth, Amy Lee Sanford and Leang
Seckon, who live in Cambodia and the U.S., have pieces in the
exhibit.</p>
<p>The Angkor Archaeological Park, a UNESCO World Heritage site, covers
more than 400 square kilometers (155 square miles). Once a city of
nearly a million people, the site contains some of Cambodia’s most
famous structures, including those recognized worldwide after being seen
in movies such as “Lara Croft: Tomb Raider and In the Mood for
Love.”</p>
<p>Playing with the dictionary meanings of “complex” such as “a whole
made up of complicated or interrelated parts,” “a building or group of
buildings housing related units” or “a group of repressed desires and
memories that exerts a dominating influence upon the personality,”
Chanchani saw how the exhibit could “allow us to think about these
different layers, these different kinds of ideas of complexness.”</p>
<p>Today, “Cambodians regard Angkor Wat as a sacred center, a national
symbol, and a site of memory,” according to the exhibition guide.</p>
<p>“Like Angkor Wat’s bullet-ridden walls, contemporary artworks from
Cambodia and its diaspora bear the scars of a genocide and of related
upheavals,” said Chanchani, adding that as a non-Cambodian outsider, he
was aware of the exhibition’s sensitive nature. “It’s not as if this is
something that happened a thousand years ago that you can just say, it
happened,” he said. “The survivors are still there.”</p>
<p>Chanchani hoped bringing Cambodian art to the U.S. would console
viewers.</p>
<p>But what could the U.S., one of the biggest economic and military
powers learn from Cambodia, a small southeast Asian country, other than
how to move on from painful memories and what the exhibition catalog
describes as the current interwoven global crises of “public health,
economic instability, authoritarian regimes, racial injustice and
climate change?”</p>
<p>And how does one nation heal from an event like the Khmer Rouge
killing nearly a quarter of the population in its quest to create an
agrarian utopia for worker-peasants?</p>
<p>For some Cambodians, it can seem as if, 40 years later, the nation
can barely move on or show off a new face when it is still being
referred to in the context of the past suffering, especially on the
international stage.</p>
<p>Reaksmey Yean, a Cambodian art writer, curator and researcher in
Phnom Penh, applauded the Michigan show, but added it is a “cliche”
because Angkor Wat and the Khmer Rouge have been overused to identify
Cambodia.</p>
<p>“An exhibition about Cambodia, its history and culture is rare in the
U.S., so I think it is important to have the exhibition to put Cambodia
on the map,” Reaksmey Yean told VOA Khmer Service. “However, it is a
cliche for me because it’s been more than 20 years when our civil war
completely ended and there are so much in our cultures that can be
shown.”</p>
<p>Museum Director Christina Olsen said the audience will have a chance
to learn about the “distinct cultural and political [significance] of
Cambodia” through the historical and contemporary arts by Cambodian and
diasporic artists.</p>
<p>“At the same time, the exhibition invites consideration of today’s
broader cultural, social and political happenings and fosters dialogue
about the lessons that can be taken from the pain and resilience of the
Cambodian people,” she added in the press release.</p>
<p>Svay Sareth is a Cambodian artist whose works in sculpture,
installation and durational performance “are made using materials and
processes intentionally associated with war — metals, uniforms,
camouflage and actions requiring great endurance,” according to the
Richard Koh Gallery in Singapore. Sareth’s interest in how Cambodia was
affected by war and how its people are moving on has informed his
art.</p>
<p>“I want the audience in the U.S. [to] see how the post genocide in
Cambodia affect the intergeneration,” Sareth said.</p>
<p>Another work, “Full Circle,” by Khmer American artist Amy Lee
Sanford, is comprised of 40 broken clay pots, repaired and installed in
a circle. She is known for her “Break Pot” performance pieces where she
would drop the clay pot from a height, then glue all the pieces back
together, an effort to show how situations can change in seconds and
even when repaired, can never be the same again.</p>
<p>Sanford said she hopes the Michigan exhibition will show that
Cambodians “have a memory of some of the important architectural and
religious structures … and that also that there are contemporary artists
now doing things related to history and related to looking forward as
well.”</p>

id="surge-of-illegal-homemade-machine-guns-helps-fuel-gun-violence-in-us">Surge
of Illegal Homemade Machine Guns Helps Fuel Gun Violence in US</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Eleven-year-old Domonic Davis was not far from his mom’s
Cincinnati home when a hail of gunfire sprayed out from a passing car.
Nearly two dozen rounds hurtled through the night at a group of children
in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>Four other children and a woman were hurt in the November shooting
that killed Domonic, who had just made his school basketball team.</p>
<p>“What happened? How does this happen to an 11-year-old? He was only a
few doors down,” said his father, Issac Davis.</p>
<p>The shooting remains under investigation. But federal investigators
believe the 22 shots could be fired off with lightning speed because the
weapon had been illegally converted to fire like a machine gun.</p>
<p>Communities around the United States have seen shootings carried out
with weapons converted to fully automatic in recent years, fueled by a
staggering increase in small pieces of metal or plastic made with a 3D
printer or ordered online.</p>
<p>Laws against machine guns date back to the bloody violence of
Prohibition-era gangsters. But the proliferation of devices known by
nicknames such as Glock switches, giggle switches, auto sears and chips
has allowed people to transform legal semi-automatic weapons into even
more dangerous guns, helping fuel gun violence, police and federal
authorities said.</p>
<p>“Police officers are facing down fully automatic weapon fire in
amounts that haven’t existed in this country since the days of Al Capone
and the Tommy gun,” said Steve Dettelbach, director of the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, or ATF. “It’s a huge
problem.”</p>
<p>The agency reported a 570% increase in the number of conversion
devices collected by police departments between 2017 and 2021, the most
recent data available.</p>
<p>Guns with conversion devices have been used in several mass
shootings, including one that left four dead at a Sweet 16 birthday
party in Alabama last year, and another that left six people dead at a
bar district in Sacramento, California, in 2022. In Houston, police
officer William Jeffrey died in 2021 after being shot with a converted
gun while serving a warrant. In cities such as Indianapolis, police have
seized them every week.</p>
<p>The devices that can convert legal semi-automatic weapons can be made
on a 3D printer in about 35 minutes or ordered online from overseas for
less than $30. They’re also quick to install.</p>
<p>Once in place, they modify the gun’s machinery. Instead of firing one
round each time the shooter squeezes the trigger, a semi-automatic
weapon with a conversion device starts firing as soon as the trigger
goes down and doesn’t stop until the shooter lets go or the weapon runs
out of ammunition.</p>
<p>“You’re seeing them a lot in stunning numbers, particularly in street
violence,” said David Pucino, deputy chief counsel at Giffords Law
Center.</p>
<p>In a demonstration by ATF agents, the firing of a semi-automatic
outfitted with a conversion device was nearly indistinguishable from an
automatic weapon. Conversion devices with differing designs can fit a
range of different guns, enabling guns to fire at a rate of 800 or more
bullets per minute, according to the ATF.</p>
<p>“It takes two or three seconds to put in some of these devices into a
firearm to make that firearm into a machine gun instantly,” Dettelbach
said.</p>
<p>Between 2012 and 2016, police departments in the U.S. found 814
conversion devices and sent them to the ATF. That number grew to more
than 5,400 between 2017 and 2021, according to the agency’s most recent
data.</p>
<p>They took hold in Minneapolis in 2021 and helped fuel record-breaking
gun violence that year, said police Chief Brian O’Hara. Along with
spraying out bullets at a dizzying speed, switches make a gun much more
difficult for the shooter to control, so more people can be hit by
accident.</p>
<p>“The thing is shaking as it’s firing, so we wind up getting multiple
victims, people hit in extremities during the same shooting incident,
because the person cannot control the weapon,” O’Hara said.</p>
<p>The city has seen a decline in their use since the September 2022
arrest of a man charged with selling switches that he had ordered from
Russia and Taiwan or made himself, O’Hara said. But “it’s still a very,
very real problem,” he said. “This is having a really deep impact on
families, on neighborhoods and communities.”</p>
<p>While the devices are considered illegal machine guns under federal
law, many states don’t have their own specific laws against them. In
Indiana, police were finding them so often — multiple times a week in
the state’s capital — that the state changed the law to ensure it
included switches.</p>
<p>“We have to update the laws regarding machine guns to deal with the
problems of today,” Indianapolis police Chief Chris Bailey said.</p>
<p>Only 15 states have their own laws against the possession, sale or
manufacture of automatic-fire weapons, according to Giffords. Indiana
was one of many states that have regulations with exceptions. Five
states have no state-level machine-gun regulations at all.</p>
<p>But long before prosecution, police must find the conversion devices.
Often about the size of a quarter, they can easily go unnoticed by the
untrained eye after being installed, said Dettelbach.</p>
<p>He recalled visiting a Texas police department after the ATF hosted a
training on conversion devices. Afterwards, the chief searched the
weapons in the evidence room and found several with previously
undetected conversion devices.</p>
<p>“These items don’t always look as dangerous as they are,” he said.
“If you see some of them, they’re pieces of plastic and metal, and
sometimes it’s even hard to recognize them when they’re actually on or
in the firearm because they blend in.”</p>
<p>They’re also increasingly a fixture online, in social media and rap
lyrics, Davis said. “Everyone is talking about switches,” he said. “It’s
a scary trend.”</p>
<p>Davis struggles to talk about the loss of his son. Domonic would
often come with his dad on Fridays to get a haircut at the barber shop
where Issac Davis works. The shooting also fell on a Friday, making the
end of the week an especially tough time.</p>
<p>Davis hopes to start a foundation called For Every Eleven to fight
gun violence and honor his son’s memory.</p>

id="biden-netanyahu-hurting-israel-by-not-preventing-civilian-deaths-in-gaza">Biden:
Netanyahu ‘Hurting Israel’ By Not Preventing Civilian Deaths in
Gaza</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Wilmington, delaware — U.S. President Joe Biden said Saturday that he
believes Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is “hurting Israel
more than helping Israel” in how he is approaching its war against Hamas
in Gaza.</p>
<p>Biden expressed support for Israel’s right to pursue Hamas after the
October 7 terror attack but said Netanyahu “must pay more attention to
the innocent lives being lost as a consequence of the actions
taken.”</p>
<p>For months, Biden has warned that Israel risks losing international
support over mounting civilian casualties in Gaza, and the latest
remarks in an interview with MSNBC’s Jonathan Capehart pointed to the
increasingly strained relationship between the two leaders.</p>
<p>Biden said of the death toll in Gaza, “it’s contrary to what Israel
stands for. And I think it’s a big mistake.”</p>
<p>Biden said a potential Israeli invasion of the Gaza city of Rafah,
where more than 1.3 million Palestinians are sheltering, is “a red line”
for him, but said he would not cut off weapons such as the Iron Dome
missile interceptors which protect the Israeli civilian populace from
rocket attacks in the region.</p>
<p>“It is a red line,” he said, when asked about Rafah, “but I’m never
going to leave Israel. The defense of Israel is still critical, so
there’s no red line I’m going to cut off all weapons, so they don’t have
the Iron Dome to protect them.”</p>
<p>Biden said he was willing to make his case directly to the Israeli
Knesset, its parliament, including by making another trip to the
country. He traveled to Israel weeks after the October 7 attack. He
declined to elaborate on how or whether such a trip might
materialize.</p>
<p>The U.S. leader had hoped to secure a temporary cease-fire before
Ramadan begins this week, though that appears increasingly unlikely as
Hamas has balked at a deal pushed by the U.S. and its allies that would
have seen fighting pause for about six weeks, the release of additional
hostages held by Hamas and Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, and a
surge in humanitarian aid into Gaza. Biden noted CIA Director Bill Burns
is in the region currently trying to resurrect the deal.</p>
