<h1 id="embeddable-game-engine">
Embeddable Game Engine
</h1>
<p>
<img

align="right" width=240> Many years ago, when working at Xamarin, where
we were building cross-platform libraries for mobile developers, we
wanted to offer both 2D and 3D gaming capabilities for our users in the
form of adding 2D or 3D content to their mobile applications.
</p>
<p>
For 2D, we contributed and developed assorted Cocos2D-inspired
libraries.
</p>
<p>
For 3D, the situation was more complex. We funded a few over the years,
and we contributed to others over the years, but nothing panned out (the
history of this is worth a dedicated post).
</p>
<p>
Around 2013, we looked around, and there were two contenders at the
time, one was an embeddable engine with many cute features but not great
UI support called Urho, and the other one was a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godot_(game_engine)">Godot</a>,
which had a great IDE, but did not support being embedded.
</p>
<p>
I reached out to Juan at the time to discuss whether Godot could be
turned into such engine. While I tend to take copious notes of all my
meetings, those notes sadly were gone as part of the Microsoft
acquisition, but from what I can remember Juan told me, "Godot is not
what you are looking for" in two dimensions, there were no immediate
plans to turn it into an embeddable library, and it was not as advanced
as Urho, so he recommended that I go with Urho.
</p>
<p>
We invested heavily in binding Urho and created
<a href="https://github.com/xamarin/urho">UrhoSharp</a> that would go
into becoming a
<a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/xamarin/bring-3d-models-life-augmented-reality-urhosharp/">great
3D library for our C# users</a> and worked not only on every desktop and
mobile platform, but we did a ton of work to make it great for AR and VR
headsets. Sadly, Microsoft’s management left UrhoSharp to die.
</p>
<p>
Then, the maintainer of Urho stepped down, and Godot became one of the
most popular open-source projects in the world.
</p>
<p>
Last year, <span class="citation"
data-cites="Faolan-Rad">@Faolan-Rad</span>
<a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/72883">contributed a
patch to Godot</a> to turn it into a library that could be embedded into
applications. I used this library to build
<a href="https://github.com/migueldeicaza/SwiftGodotKit">SwiftGodotKit</a>
and have been very happy with it ever since - allowing people to embed
Godot content into their application.
</p>
<p>
However, the patch had severe limitations; it could only ever run one
Godot game as an embedded system and could not do much more. The folks
at <a href="https://www.smirk.gg">Smirk Software</a> wanted to take this
further. They wanted to host independent Godot scenes in their app and
have more control over those so they could sprinkle Godot content at
their heart’s content on their mobile app
(<a href="https://x.com/JoshBromberg1/status/1721564103859114132">demo</a>)
</p>
<p>
They funded some initial work to do this and hired
<a href="https://migeran.com">Gergely Kis’s company</a> to do this work.
</p>
<p>
Gergely demoed this work at GodotCon last year. I came back very excited
from GodotCon and I decided to turn my
<a href="https://x.com/migueldeicaza/status/1723765594653167892">prototype
Godot on iPad</a> into a
<a href="https://blog.la-terminal.net/igodot/">complete product</a>.
</p>
<p>
One of the features that I needed was the ability to embed chunks of
Godot in discrete components in my iPad UI, so we worked with Gergely to
productize and polish this patch for general consumption.
</p>
<p>
Now, there is a
<a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/90510">complete patch
under review</a> to allow people to embed arbitrary Godot scenes into
their apps. For SwiftUI users, this means that you can embed a Godot
scene into a <code>View</code> and display and control it at will.
</p>
<p>
Hopefully, the team will accept this change into Godot, and once this is
done, I will update SwiftGodotKit to get these new capabilities to Swift
users (bindings for other platforms and languages are left as an
exercise to the reader).
</p>
<p>
It only took a decade after talking to Juan, but I am back firmly in
Godot land.

One of the things I test when reviewing mini PCs for Liliputing is WiFi
performance or network throughput. And up until recently I’ve used the
popular iperf3 tool to do that, since it allows me to see how real-world
performance compares with the speeds you’d expect from the
specifications provided by WiFi chip makers. For […]

for Tesla’s quarterly results</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-23, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
EV maker Tesla will release quarterly results after markets close on
Tuesday, but the company has been struggling so far this year. Beset by
stiff global competition, Tesla has been cutting prices and laying off
workers. We’ll set the stage for the big financial release. Plus, high
mortgage rates bring about a real estate quandary. And as part of
<a href="https://www.marketplace.org/collection/the-league/">this
month’s Econ Extra Credit</a>, we examine how baseball’s Negro Leagues
navigated the Great Depression.

This is regarding David Hegg’s April 7 column, “Your Happiness Can Hurt
You.” I’ve read Mr. Hegg’s columns for years now, with the response

compared to the same period of 2023. China will see incredible EV growth
this year, with EVs accounting for about 45% of car sales. As EV prices
continue to fall and supply chains improve, global demand will continue
to rise. By 2035, “every other car sold globally is set to be electric”
if today’s policies hold, the IEA said. “Rather than tapering off, the

connects the dots between the record-breaking 2021 North American
wildfire season and the “one-in-a-thousand-year” heat dome that settled
over the Pacific Northwest in June of that year. The study, published
in<em><em> Communications Earth &amp; Environment</em></em>, found that
human-caused climate change increased both the size and longevity of the
27-day heat dome, the former by about 34%, and the latter by 60%. About
one-third of the area that burned was covered by the dome. The authors
note that the heat wave would have been 150 times less likely to happen
without climate change. “Climate change will continue to magnify heat
dome events, increase fire danger, and enable extreme synchronous
wildfire in forested areas of North America,” they wrote.

<p>date: 2024-04-23, from: OS News</p>
<p>Hot on the heels of NetBSD 10.0 comes NetBSD 9.4, a minor release in
the previous release branch. NetBSD 9.4 is primarily a bug and security
fix release, however, there are some new features, such as support for
more MegaRAID controllers, ZTE MF112 and D-Link DWM222 USB 3G modems,
and improved CPU feature detection for newer AMD/Intel devices. All
users of netbsd-9 should upgrade if they are not following the stable
branch. ↫ NetBSD 9.4 release announcement A very important note here is
that the version of OpenSSL in NetBSD 9.4 is no longer supported unless
you have a support contract with OpenSSL. They suggest upgrading to
NetBSD 10.0, or to use OpenSSL from pkgsrc.</p>

30 released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-23, from: OS News</p>
<p>Tribblix, the unique ilumos distribution – think Solaris – has a new
SPARC milestone. It’s one of the few platforms still actively supporting
SPARC, so even if the amount of users might be slim, I think it’s an
important contribution to the ecosystem. The application software here
roughly corresponds to m34 on x86 systems, although the underlying
illumos is still closer to m25/m26. Note that there are no functional
illumos changes from the m28 sparc release – if that release didn’t work
on your system, this one won’t either. ↫ Peter Tribble I’m still looking
for my mythical, unobtanium Sun Ultra 45, a goal farther away now than
it’s ever been (Patreon maybe? One-time donation? Help me out after I
took OSNews full-time?), and the SPARC version of Tribblix would be my
first go-to.</p>

id="columbias-ongoing-protests-cause-canceled-classes-and-increased-tensions">Columbia’s
ongoing protests cause canceled classes and increased tensions</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Columbia University held virtual classes Monday on the
sixth continuous day of student protests over the Israel-Hamas
conflict.</p>
<p>University president Nemat “Minouche” Shafik sent an email to the
Columbia community announcing that classes would be held virtually.</p>
<p>“The decibel of our disagreements has only increased in recent days,”
Shafik wrote. “These tensions have been exploited and amplified by
individuals who are not affiliated with Columbia who have come to campus
to pursue their own agendas. We need a reset.”</p>
<p>More than 100 students were arrested at the school April 18, after
the university’s president authorized police to clear away protesters.
Some of the students also received suspension notices from the
school.</p>
<p>Columbia’s action prompted an onslaught of pro-Palestinian
demonstrations at other universities and responses from faculty and
politicians.</p>
<p>The arrests occurred after students calling themselves Columbia
University Apartheid Divest erected dozens of tents on a lawn at the
center of the campus, establishing it as the “Gaza Solidarity
Encampment.”</p>
<p>Following the arrests and the demolition of the original encampment,
another pro-Palestine encampment sprung on an adjacent lawn.</p>
<p>Students aren’t the only demonstrators experiencing tensions on
campus and with the university administration.</p>
<p>Monday morning, Business School assistant professor Shai Davidai was
denied entry to the university for an attempted pro-Israel
counter-protest on the occupied lawn after he refused to comply with the
university’s counter-protest policies.</p>
<p>“I am a professor here; I have every right to be everywhere on
campus. You cannot let people who support Hamas on campus, and me, a
professor, not on campus. Let me in now,” he said after Columbia COO
Cass Halloway stopped him and other pro-Israel protesters at the
entrance gates.</p>
<p>He has repeatedly called student protesters “violent maniacs” and
“pro-Hamas terrorists.” A petition calling for Davidai’s dismissal has
amassed nearly 9,000 signatures as of last Thursday night; additional
grievances have been shared on social media and with the university.</p>
<p>Some Jewish students at Columbia say that many criticisms of Israel
are antisemitic and make them feel unsafe.</p>
<p>Since the arrests, many student groups and Columbia affiliate groups
have released statements condemning the university’s decision to arrest
students, citing discriminatory enforcement of rules that limit
students’ freedom of speech.</p>
<p>Monday, hundreds of faculty members from across Columbia and Barnard
staged a rally and walkout to urge the university to reverse the
students’ suspensions. Some faculty members wore their graduation
regalia and sashes reading “We support students.”</p>
<p>The backlash from the protests has even reached the ear of U.S.
President Joe Biden. When asked about the recent events at the
university by reporters Monday, Biden said, “I condemn the antisemitic
protests. That’s why I have set up a program to deal with that. I also
condemn those who don’t understand what’s going on with the
Palestinians.”</p>
<p>Other campuses, such as Yale, Stanford, and New York University have
also rallied around the Palestinian cause, calling for their
universities to divest from companies with ties to Israel and for a
ceasefire in Gaza. Many have put up tent encampments on their campuses.
About 50 students were arrested at Yale in New Haven, Connecticut,
Monday after they refused to leave their encampment.</p>
<p>Student protesters at Columbia have urged organizers of rallies
outside the campus to “remember what we are protesting for” and focus on
the war in Gaza, rather than just expressing solidarity with
protesters.</p>
<p>The university announced Tuesday morning that classes on the
Morningside main campus, where the protests are taking place, will be
offered in a hybrid format for the remainder of the Spring semester. The
last day of classes is April 29. </p>
<p>Some information for this report was provided by Reuters and the
Associated Press.</p>

President Joe Biden became the winner of this Congress. When the
Republicans took control of the House in January 2023, they vowed to
impeach Biden and members of his Cabinet, overturn the signature
legislation the Democrats had passed in 2021 and 2022, and force the
Democrats to accept draconian immigration policies.</p>

<p>date: 2024-04-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Marijuana is a rare consensus issue in politically divided America,
with polls showing that 88 percent of Americans support at least
partially legalizing the drug. But cannabis advocates say neither of the
leading presidential candidates are capitalizing on shifting attitudes.

id="white-house-weighs-immigration-relief-for-spouses-of-us-citizens">White
House weighs immigration relief for spouses of US citizens</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The White House is weighing ways to provide temporary
legal status and work permits to immigrants in the U.S. illegally who
are married to American citizens, three sources familiar with the matter
said on Monday, a move that could energize some Democrats ahead of the
November elections.</p>
<p>Democratic lawmakers and advocacy groups have pressured President Joe
Biden to take steps to protect immigrants in the country illegally as
Biden simultaneously considers executive actions to reduce illegal
border crossings.</p>
<p>Immigration has emerged as a top voter concern, especially among
Republicans ahead of the Nov. 5 election pitting Biden, a Democrat,
against his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump. Trump has said Biden’s
less restrictive policies have led to a rise in illegal immigration.</p>
<p>The White House in recent months has considered the possibility of
executive actions to block migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border if
crossings reach a certain threshold, sparking criticism from some
Democrats and advocates.</p>
<p>The Biden administration also has examined the possible use of
“parole in place” for spouses of U.S. citizens, the sources said,
requesting anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.</p>
<p>The temporary status would provide access to work permits and
potentially a path to citizenship. No actions are imminent or finalized,
the sources said.</p>
<p>A White House spokesperson said the administration “is constantly
evaluating possible policy options” but declined to confirm discussions
around specific actions.</p>
<p>“The administration remains committed to ensuring those who are
eligible for relief can receive it quickly and to building an
immigration system that is fairer and more humane,” the spokesperson
said.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal first reported the possible moves.</p>
<p>An estimated 1.1 million immigrants in the U.S. illegally are married
to U.S. citizens, according to data by advocacy organization FWD.us.</p>
<p>A group of 86 Democrats sent a letter to Biden and Homeland Security
Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas last year urging them to protect spouses of
U.S. citizens and create a family reunification process for those
outside the country.</p>
<p>Speaking at an advocacy press conference in Washington on Monday,
Philadelphia resident and U.S. citizen Allyson Batista said her
Brazilian-born husband still lacks legal immigration status after 20
years of marriage.</p>
<p>Batista and her husband have three children together and run a
construction company, she said, pleading with Biden to act.</p>
<p>“Year after year, we continue to live in trauma and fear of
separation,” she said, “especially if an unfriendly administration takes
over again.”</p>

<h2 id="paying-for-it-doesnt-make-it-a-market">Paying for it doesn’t
make it a market</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-22, from: OS News</p>
<p>Cory Doctorow, nailing it as usual. If you care about how people are
treated by platforms, you can’t just tell them to pay for services
instead of using ad-supported media. The most important factor in
getting decent treatment out of a tech company isn’t whether you pay
with cash instead of attention – it’s whether you’re locked in, and thus
a flight risk whom the platform must cater to. ↫ Cory Doctorow I’m sick
and tired of the phrase “if you’re not paying for the product, you’re
the product”, because it implies that if just you pay for a product or
service, you’re not going to be treated like ass. The problem is, as
Doctorow points out, that this simply is not supported by the evidence,
and that it isn’t whether or not you’re paying that makes you have a
good or bad experience – it’s whether or not you’re locked in. If you’ve
got nowhere else to go, then corporations can treat you like ass. There
are so, so many free services and products I use where I’m anything but
a “product”. My Linux distribution of choice, Fedora. My web browser,
Firefox. The countless open source applications I use on my desktops,
laptops, and smartphone. Those are all cases where even though I’m not
paying, I know I’m being treated with respect, and I feel entirely
comfortable with all of those. And no, you don’t get to exclude the open
source world just because it’s inconvenient for the “you’re the product”
argument. There are also countless services and products where the
opposite is true; I’m a paying customer, but I still feel like I’m the
product. I pay for additional Google Drive storage. I pay for an Office
364 subscription because I needed it as a translator (I’m working on
OSNews full-time now, and could use your help keeping the site going),
but I can’t cancel it because my wife, my parents, and my parents-in-law
use that same subscription. We pay for Netflix and one or two other
video services. I don’t know if our ISP or wireless provider do anything
malicious, but it wouldn’t surprise me. And so on. Being a paying
customer means nothing. It’s how easy it is for you to stop being a
customer that matters.</p>

<p>date: 2024-04-22, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
Climate change either is or isn’t the biggest issue of our time. It all
depends on who you ask — and, especially, how.
</p>
<p>
In March, as it has since 1939, Gallup asked Americans what they thought
was the
<a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1675/Most-Important-Problem.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>most
important problem</u></a> facing the country. Just 2% of respondents
said “environment/pollution/climate change” — fewer than those who said
“poor leadership” or “unifying the country” (although more than those
who said “the media.”)
<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/02/29/americans-top-policy-priority-for-2024-strengthening-the-economy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Pew,
meanwhile</u></a>, asked Americans in January what the top priority for
the president and Congress ought to be for this year, and “dealing with
climate change” ranked third-to-last out of 20 issues — well behind
“defending against terrorism,” “reducing availability of illegal drugs,”
and “improving the way the political system works.”
</p>
<p>
The Biden administration seems to be taking the apparent message to
heart,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/epa-rules-biden" target="_self"><u>softening
parts of its climate agenda</u></a> while Democrats in tight elections
run interference with their economy-first constituents. Mention of the
Inflation Reduction Act, the president’s landmark climate legislation,
still
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/inflation-reduction-act-popularity-repeal" target="_self"><u>mostly
elicits blank stares from Americans</u></a>, and the administration
hasn’t done much to help its case. During his State of the Union
address, Biden didn’t refer to the IRA
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/biden-state-of-the-union-inflation-reduction-act" target="_self"><u>by
name</u></a> even once.
</p>
<p>
And yet Americans clearly, obviously, patently<em><em> are
</em></em>worried about the climate. More than half of the respondents
to
<a href="https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/visualizations-data/ycom-us/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
Yale Program on Climate Change opinion poll</u></a> last winter said
“global warming should be a priority for the next president and
Congress.” Around the same time, seven in 10 called climate change a
“serious issue” and a third reported being “extremely concerned” about
it in
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/change-polling-concern-belief-republicans-vs-democrats" target="_self"><u>Heatmap’s
own Climate Poll</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
“You could also ask, ‘Is the survival of American democracy a defining
issue in this campaign or not?,’ and the polls will sometimes mislead
you into thinking it’s way down the list,” former Vice President Al Gore
said at a recent leadership conference for his nonprofit Climate Reality
Project in New York — and indeed
<a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1675/Most-Important-Problem.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
March Gallup poll from March</u></a> had “elections/election
reform/democracy” as the top issue facing the country for just 3% of
people. “But when people get into the voting booth,” Gore continued,
“and they think about the fact that democracy is at risk — as we saw in
the last bye elections — that actually <em><em>did</em></em> matter. And
I think climate is the same way.”
</p>
<p>
Gore wasn’t just relying on his own intuition. A widely circulated
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/18/us/politics/midterm-election-voters-democracy-poll.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em>New
York Times</em>/Siena College poll</u></a> conducted ahead of the 2022
midterms showed 71% of voters believed democracy was at risk, but only
7% identified it as the most important issue facing the country, leading
many to start
<a href="https://twitter.com/billmckibben/status/1582505214229172224" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>eulogizing</u></a>
<a href="https://twitter.com/maddow/status/1582396824517677057" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>American</u></a>
<a href="https://twitter.com/donmoyn/status/1582361649310154753" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>democracy</u></a>.
And yet candidates from the Democratic Party, which has positioned
itself as a bulwark against the erosion of representative government,
dominated the most contested elections.
</p>
<p>
When you start to ask more targeted questions, the research tends to
concur. “If you say, ‘Is climate change <em><em>an</em></em> important
priority?,’ you get about two-thirds of people who agree with that,”
Matthew Burgess, an assistant professor of environmental studies at the
University of Colorado Boulder, told me. “If you say, ‘<em><em>the
single most important</em></em> issue,’ then that’s where it falls off.”
</p>
<p>
Burgess’s work has examined a particularly odd discrepancy between the
limited number of voters who list climate as the most urgent issue
facing the country and the fact that climate change, on its own, can
seemingly swing elections. In fact, Burgess and his co-authors argued
<a href="https://www.colorado.edu/asmagazine/2024/03/19/putting-climate-ballot" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>in
a paper</u></a> they published earlier this year that climate voters
might have secured Biden’s 2020 victory. Using data from the nonpartisan
Voter Study Group, Burgess and his co-authors found that “how important
voters considered climate change to be as an issue was one of the
strongest predictors of whom they voted for in 2020.” How strong a
predictor? Strong enough to shift the national popular vote margin by 3%
or more toward Biden, they concluded.
</p>
<p>
But when I asked Burgess what’s missing from a statistic like Gallup’s,
which shows few voters prioritizing climate over other concerns, he
admitted, “I don’t know.” He has plenty of theories, though. Recent
election margins have been
<a href="https://theconversation.com/climate-change-matters-to-more-and-more-people-and-could-be-a-deciding-factor-in-the-2024-election-222680" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>so
tight</u></a> that climate change would not actually have to have a
significant effect on voting to swing the outcome, he told me. Or
perhaps voters are beginning to connect the dots between climate change
and issues they more openly profess to care about, such as the economy
and
<a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/docs/National_Security_Implications_of_Changing_Climate_Final_051915.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>national
security</u></a>. When I asked Justin McCarthy, an analyst at Gallup,
about Burgess’ findings, he told me that “our question is not meant to
measure issues affecting vote choice.”
</p>
<p>
It takes a lot of faith to buy any of those arguments, and Democrats in
tight
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/8-climate-races-election-2024" target="_self"><u>down-ballot
races</u></a> might not be willing to bet their limited resources on it.
But we risk blowing past important context by writing off polling that
shows Americans putting the economy over their concern about climate
change, according to Emily Becker, the deputy director of communications
on the climate and energy team at Third Way, a center-left think tank.
</p>
<p>
Becker has no problem advising frontline candidates “not to talk about
climate and to talk about clean energy instead,” she told me. In her
opinion, the two are separate issues — and the popular habit of using
them as euphemisms is helping neither voters nor climate-conscious
candidates.
</p>
<p>
“We tend to talk about clean energy as having one core purpose:
emissions abatement. Then there are the positive externalities: job
creation, clean air and water, money into your community, etc.,” Becker
told me. But when it comes to Americans struggling to pay their bills,
or who see minimal opportunities for good, well-paying jobs in their
communities, “the positive externalities are no longer side effects,”
she said. “They’re the main piece.”
</p>
<p>
By way of example, Becker said, it’s especially telling that investing
in clean energy to address climate change appears to be popular in
polls, but follow-up questions that ask how voters would feel about that
investment <em><em>if it raises their household costs </em></em>see a
“big drop.” “It’s kind of a luxury issue,” Becker said of climate
change-first voting.
<a href="https://www.thirdway.org/polling/beyond-the-climate-voter-how-to-broaden-support-for-clean-energy-in-america" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Third
Way’s own research</u></a> shows that people who self-identify that way
tend to be older, white, and more educated.
</p>
<p>
But young voters — traditionally thought of as the most climate-friendly
demographic — are also facing some of the
<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90830832/gen-z-hardest-economic-challenges-experts" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>worst
economic odds of any living generation</u></a>. “The idea that you’re
going to make decisions at the ballot box based on a faraway problem and
not based on the problems right in front of you is a little bit
delusional,” Becker told me.
</p>
<p>
Heather Hargreaves, the deputy executive director of campaigns at
Climate Power, a strategic communications group with
<a href="https://climatepower.us/research-and-polling/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
robust research and polling operation</u></a>, had a slightly different
takeaway. “I don’t think any elected official who is seeing a national
poll where climate change is getting a lower percentage than the economy
should be like, ‘Oh, this means I shouldn’t talk about climate change,’”
she told me. “That’s misguided.”
</p>
<p>
Climate Power’s polling has
<a href="https://climatepower.us/news/memo-poll-post-super-tuesday-democrats-must-emphasize-trumps-record/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>found</u></a>
that “clean energy and climate messaging” moved every demographic toward
Biden, particularly — again — young voters, as well as independents, who
were key in Burgess’ research. “If you look at the things people care
about the most, gas prices and utility costs are always up there,”
Hargreaves said. “And these are both related to how we address climate
change.”
</p>
<p>
As even more evidence that climate is a winning message after all,
Hargreaves pointed out that Republicans in red districts are “not shying
away” from talking about how the IRA has brought money, improvements,
and clean-energy investments to their districts. For example, Senator
Tom Cotton bragged last summer that “Senator Boozman and I were able to
secure the grants” for highway improvement projects funded by the
infrastructure law — which
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/07/09/gop-spending-infrastructure-ira-biden/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
Arkansas pair had voted against</u></a>. Likewise, Nancy Mace, a
congresswoman from South Carolina,
<a href="https://newrepublic.com/post/173963/republicans-taking-credit-infrastructure-bill-voted-against" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>hosted
a press conference</u></a> touting a local transit hub with electric
buses despite having once called electric mass transit “socialism.”
</p>
<p>
“They’re now trying to take credit for it — and that’s proof it’s
politically a winner,” Hargreaves told me.
</p>
<p>
As an election-year message, it’s hard to argue that “climate change” —
at least phrased as such —
<a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/09/08/1198525628/are-the-effects-of-extreme-weather-changing-how-were-thinking-about-climate-chan" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>actually
resonates</u></a> with the majority of Americans. But “it must be a big
tent issue if we’re going to actually solve it,” Burgess, the University
of Colorado Boulder professor, told me. And opinions are still being
shaped: Gallup has found that victims of extreme weather events are
<a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/391508/extreme-weather-affected-one-three-americans.aspx#:~:text=Gallup's%20annual%20Environment%20survey%20tracks,in%20the%20past%20two%20years." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more
likely</u></a> to worry about climate change and view it as a threat. As
Hargreaves stressed to me, polling <em><em>trends</em></em> tend to be
more revealing than any individual battery questions, and they generally
show
<a href="https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/global-surveys-show-peoples-growing-concern-about-climate-change" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>growing
levels of urgency</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Becker also offered a word of advice. “Be willing to be told that your
issue does not matter as much as you want it to,” she said. “And figure
out how you can make your priorities and the priorities of the
electorate overlap.”

<h2 id="cannabis-a-rare-consensus-issue-ahead-of-us-election">Cannabis a
rare consensus issue ahead of US election</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — Marijuana use is a rare consensus issue in politically
divided America, with polls showing that 88% of Americans support at
least partial legalization. But neither of the two main presidential
contenders are capitalizing on this, advocates say, with both President
Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump landing far behind where
most Americans are on the issue.</p>
<p>VOA spoke to cannabis advocates on the sidelines of a rare, recent
policy summit on the issue, held annually in Washington as a preview to
a weekend-long music festival.</p>
<p>“One thing [both candidates] have in common is that their track
records on cannabis have been inconsistent and incremental,” said
Caroline Phillips, organizer of the National Cannabis Policy Summit.
“We’ve heard promises from both administrations, neither of which have
panned out in full.”</p>
<p>Biden in 2022 directed the Department of Health and Human Services to
take a key step toward legalization by ordering a review of its
classification of marijuana as a dangerous controlled substance, on par
with heroin and LSD.</p>
<p>Nearly a year later, the body recommended moving marijuana to a
lighter classification, alongside prescription drugs. That ruling now
sits with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, which has the power
to act.</p>
<p>But, Phillips said, many advocates seek the full removal – or
“de-scheduling” – of the substance from the DEA’s Controlled Substances
Act.</p>
<p>“They have given us great signals that they’re willing to shift
towards de-scheduling, but most likely re-scheduling,” she said of the
Biden administration. “However, we haven’t quite seen the action to back
up their words.”</p>
<p>Re-scheduling puts marijuana on par with prescription drugs and
regulates users’ access to it; de-scheduling removes it from the list of
controlled substances entirely.</p>
<p>Neera Tanden, director of Biden’s Domestic Policy Council, said the
administration sees a need to learn more – something that re-scheduling
the substance would enable by making it more readily available to
scientific researchers.</p>
<p>“There’s been a lot of change on this issue for several years,” she
told VOA. “It’s important for us to be able to research it more
effectively.”</p>
<p>A small but vocal group of anti-cannabis legislators in Congress have
also expressed concerns about changing the status of marijuana. Last
year, 14 of them – all Republicans – sent a letter opposing the effort
to loosen its classification.</p>
<p>In their letter, the group pointed to the potential for addiction and
the increased potency of today’s cannabis, saying “facts indicate that
marijuana has a high potential for abuse and that the risk is only
increasing.”</p>
<p>Trump’s position on marijuana, advocates say, is hazy. The
pro-legalization Marijuana Policy Project says he “never brought the
issue up proactively” as president. Since leaving office, Phillips said,
“we’ve heard him both say that people who sell drugs in the illicit
market should be jailed and even put to death.”</p>
<p>On the campaign trail, Trump has largely avoided the issue, said
Morgan Fox, political director for the National Organization for the
Reform of Marijuana Laws, known as NORML.</p>
<p>“We haven’t heard too much from the Republican nominee so far,” he
said.</p>
<p>The personal becomes political</p>
<p>The candidates’ attitudes, Fox said, are out of step with those of
many Americans, and lean on old tropes about marijuana that paint users
as prone to mania – like in the 1936 film “Reefer Madness” – or use fear
as a tool, like the 1980s-era Drug Abuse Resistance Education
program.</p>
<p>“Luckily, with the advent of the internet and the development of a
lot more communication around these issues, people have not only been
able to see that the policy of prohibiting cannabis and criminalizing
cannabis consumers is nonsensical, but they’ve also been able to really
see the human impact that it has had,” he said.</p>
<p>For entrepreneur William Davis, this is personal. With his pressed
jeans, alligator-skin boots, crisp white cowboy hat and penchant for
replying to questions with “yes, ma’am,” he knows he does not cut the
figure of a stereotypical cannabis user.</p>
<p>“It’s a lot of people that you would never think,” he said.</p>
<p>For years, the Iraq war veteran struggled with PTSD and opioid
addiction. He was reluctant to accept a friend’s recommendation that he
try cannabis, he said, because to him it evoked a wildly popular 1980s
ad that showed a frying egg, and a stern admonition: “This is your brain
on drugs.”</p>
<p>“Like in a hot pan with the egg, I thought, ‘Nah, I don’t wanna try
drugs, I’m gonna fry my brains,’” Davis said.</p>
<p>Instead, he said, marijuana produced a revelation. Davis says he uses
CBD, the non-psychoactive compound found in marijuana, to soothe his
anxiety during the day, and the active component, THC, for relaxation
after work.</p>
<p>Six years ago, he founded a company, Euphoria Eats, that sells
infused hot sauce and barbecue sauce.</p>
<p>Davis, who is from Houston but now lives in solidly Republican
Louisiana, said he supports legalization for business reasons.</p>
<p>“Until this will be decriminalized and legal everywhere, there will
always be hesitant individuals who are afraid to put their money into a
lucrative business that they see is making money, that they see is
making an impact on the community,” he told VOA.</p>
<p>‘My vote influences cannabis laws’</p>
<p>Polls show that the greatest pro-cannabis momentum comes from younger
Americans.</p>
<p>Community organizer Scotty Smart spoke to VOA about his position as a
young progressive, which was summarized neatly on his moss-green T-shirt
that read: “MY VOTE INFLUENCES CANNABIS LAWS.”</p>
<p>“I think cannabis is an issue that ignites and excites young people
to pay attention,” said Smart, who works with the nonpartisan New
Georgia Project and with a pro-marijuana education and awareness
movement called We Want all the Smoke.</p>
<p>A key factor that young voters are watching for, he said, is whether
the Biden administration moves forward with the process of downgrading
cannabis.</p>
<p>“Hopefully that takes place before the election so we can really see,
have something to go off of and not just have election speeches giving
us hope,” he said.</p>
<p>Maya Tatum, former chair of the national grassroots group Students
for Sensible Drug Policy, agreed that the candidates’ actions matter
more than their words. Neither man, she said, is a clear winner
here.</p>
<p>“A lot of the young voters that I’m around are wanting to hold Joe
Biden accountable for what he said,” in support of cannabis, she said.
“I don’t personally feel like there’s a lot that Trump is offering as it
relates to cannabis.”</p>
<p>Fox said NORML would like to see political aspirants be more open
about cannabis on the campaign trail.</p>
<p>“Any candidate that actually wants to get ahead – whether it’s in the
presidential election in Congress or state legislatures or local
legislators – if they ignore this issue, it’s going to be at their
peril,” he said.</p>

id="facebook-opens-its-android-based-quest-operating-system-to-other-vr-device-makers">Facebook
opens its Android-based Quest operating system to other VR device
makers</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-22, from: OS News</p>
<p>Today we’re taking the next step toward our vision for a more open
computing platform for the metaverse. We’re opening up the operating
system powering our Meta Quest devices to third-party hardware makers,
giving more choice to consumers and a larger ecosystem for developers to
build for. We’re working with leading global technology companies to
bring this new ecosystem to life and making it even easier for
developers to build apps and reach their audiences on the platform. Meta
Horizon OS is the result of a decade of work by Meta to build a
next-generation computing platform. To pioneer standalone headsets, we
developed technologies like inside-out tracking, and for more natural
interaction systems and social presence, we developed eye, face, hand,
and body tracking. For mixed reality, we built a full stack of
technologies for blending the digital and physical worlds, including
high-resolution Passthrough, Scene Understanding, and Spatial Anchors.
This long-term investment that began on the mobile-first foundations of
the Android Open Source Project has produced a full mixed reality
operating system used by millions of people. ↫ Facebook’s blog In
summary, Facebook wants the operating system of their Quest series of
virtual reality devices – an Android Open Source Project fork optimised
for this use – to become the default platform for virtual reality
devices from all kinds of OEMs. Today, they’re announcing that both Asus
and Lenovo will be releasing devices running this Meta Horizon OS, with
the former focusing on high-end VR gaming, and the latter on more
general use cases of work, entertainment, and so on. Facebook will also
be working together with Microsoft to create a Quest “inspired by Xbox”.
The Meta Quest Store, the on-device marketplace for applications and
games, will be renamed to the Meta Horizon Store, and the App Lab, where
developers can more easily get their applications and games on devices
and in the hands of consumers as long as they meet basic technical and
content guidelines, will be integrated into the Meta Horizon Store for
easier access than before. In addition, in a mildly spicy move, Facebook
is openly inviting Google to bring the Google Play Store to the VR
Android fork, “where it can operate with the same economic model it does
on other platforms”. The odds of me buying anything from Facebook are
slim, so I really hope this new move won’t corner the market for VR
headsets right out of the gate; I don’t want another Android/iOS
duopoly. I’m not particularly interested in VR quite yet – but give it a
few more years, and I certainly won’t pass up on a capable device that
allows me to play Beat Saber and other exercise-focused applications and
games. I just don’t want it to be a Facebook device or operating
system.</p>

id="work-starts-on-bullet-train-rail-line-from-las-vegas-to-los-angeles">Work
starts on bullet train rail line from Las Vegas to Los Angeles</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>las vegas — A $12 billion high-speed passenger rail line between Las
Vegas and the Los Angeles area has started construction, officials said
Monday, amid predictions that millions of ticket-buyers will be boarding
trains by 2028.</p>
<p>“People have been dreaming of high-speed rail in America for
decades,” U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in a
statement released to coincide with a ceremony at the future site of a
terminal to be built just south of the Las Vegas Strip.</p>
<p>Buttigieg predicted the project will bring “thousands of union jobs,
new connections to better economic opportunity, less congestion on the
roads, and less pollution in the air.”</p>
<p>Brightline West, whose sister company already operates a fast train
between Miami and Orlando in Florida, aims to lay 351 kilometers of new
track between Las Vegas and another new facility in Rancho Cucamonga,
California. Almost the full distance is to be built in the median of
Interstate 15, with a station stop in San Bernardino County’s
Victorville area.</p>
<p>Brightline Holdings founder and Chairperson Wes Edens dubbed the
moment “the foundation for a new industry.”</p>
<p>“This is a historic project and a proud moment,” Edens said in the
statement. “Today is long overdue.”</p>
<p>Brightline aims to link other U.S. cities that are too near to each
other for air travel to make sense and too far for people to drive the
distance.</p>
<p>Company CEO Mike Reininger has said the goal is to have trains
operating in time for the Summer Olympics in Los Angeles in 2028.</p>
<p>Brightline received $6.5 billion in backing from the Biden
administration, including a $3 billion grant from federal infrastructure
funds and approval to sell another $2.5 billion in tax-exempt bonds. The
company won federal authorization in 2020 to sell $1 billion in similar
bonds.</p>
<p>The project is touted as the first true high-speed passenger rail
line in the nation, designed to reach speeds of 186 mph (300 kph),
comparable to Japan’s Shinkansen bullet trains.</p>
<p>The route between Vegas and L.A. is largely open space, with no
convenient alternate to I-15. Brightline’s Southern California terminal
will be at a commuter rail connection to downtown Los Angeles.</p>
<p>The project outline says electric-powered trains will cut the
four-hour trip across the Mojave Desert to a little more than two hours.
Forecasts are for 11 million one-way passengers per year, or some 30,000
per day, with fares well below airline travel costs. The trains will
offer restrooms, Wi-Fi, food and beverage sales and the option to check
luggage.</p>
<p>Las Vegas is a popular driving destination for Southern Californians.
Officials hope the train line will relieve congestion on I-15, where
drivers often sit in miles of crawling traffic while returning home from
a Las Vegas weekend.</p>
<p>The Las Vegas area, now approaching 3 million residents, draws more
than 40 million visitors per year. Passenger traffic at the city’s Harry
Reid International Airport set a record of 57.6 million people in 2023.
An average of more than 44,000 automobiles per day crossed the
California-Nevada state line on I-15 in 2023, according to Las Vegas
Convention and Visitors Authority data.</p>
<p>Florida-based Brightline Holdings launched the Miami-to-Orlando line
in 2018 with trains reaching speeds up to 125 mph (200 kph). It expanded
service to Orlando International Airport last September. It offers 16
roundtrips per day, with one-way tickets for the 235-mile
(378-kilometer) distance costing about $80.</p>
<p>Other fast trains in the U.S. include Amtrak’s Acela, which can top
241 kph while sharing tracks with freight and commuter service between
Boston and Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Passenger trains to Las Vegas ended in 1997, when Amtrak ended
service.</p>
<p>Ideas for connecting other U.S. cities with high-speed passenger
trains have been floated in recent years, including Dallas to Houston;
Atlanta to Charlotte, North Carolina; and Chicago to St. Louis. Most
have faced delays.</p>
<p>In California, voters in 2008 approved a proposed 805-kilometer rail
line linking Los Angeles and San Francisco, but the plan has been beset
by rising costs and routing disputes. A 2022 business plan by the
California High-Speed Rail Authority projected the cost had more than
tripled to $105 billion.</p>

<h2 id="us-mulls-sending-more-military-advisers-to-ukraine">US mulls
sending more military advisers to Ukraine</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Pentagon — The United States may send additional military advisers to
its embassy in Kyiv to advise and support the Ukrainian government and
military, Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder told VOA Monday.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The troops would serve in a “non-combat” role, Ryder said.   </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Throughout this conflict, the DOD (Department of Defense) has
reviewed and adjusted our presence in-country, as security conditions
have evolved. Currently, we are considering sending several additional
advisers to augment the Office of Defense Cooperation (ODC) at the
embassy,” Ryder said in a statement.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Two U.S. defense officials, speaking to VOA on the condition of
anonymity to discuss plans that were not finalized, said the number of
advisers was “small” and could fluctuate slightly based on embassy
requirements. A source familiar with the considerations said the number
of troops was “fewer than two dozen.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The troops could advise on missions ranging from logistics,
maintenance, communications and sustainment, the defense officials
added.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Per the Pentagon, the ODC performs a variety of advisory and support
missions and is embedded within the U.S. Embassy under the chief of the
mission.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Politico was first to report the additional troop consideration.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Pentagon’s latest troop discussion comes after the U.S. House of
Representatives on Saturday passed a four-part, $95 billion foreign aid
package for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, structured
the bills so that they could be combined into one after each bill was
approved, to prevent opposition to any one piece from derailing the
entire deal. Johnson had declined to bring the aid packages to the floor
for a vote for months. The Senate had passed a supplemental aid bill in
February, as Ukraine said ammunition shortages were causing its forces
to pull back in areas.</p>
<p>The newly-passed House legislation includes $61 billion for Kyiv’s
ongoing war against Moscow’s invasion, as well as $26 billion for Israel
and humanitarian aid for civilians in conflict zones, including Gaza,
and $8 billion for the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>President Joe Biden in a statement Saturday urged the Senate to
“quickly send this package to my desk so that I can sign it into law,
and we can quickly send weapons and equipment to Ukraine to meet their
urgent battlefield needs.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He said the bills advanced U.S. national security interests and sends
“a clear message about the power of American leadership on the world
stage.”</p>

an abbreviated version:

<p>
<strong>Today:</strong> Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg is out
West helping break ground on the Brightline West High-Speed Rail

Technology Policy, is in Maine to announce $123 million in funding for
habitat restoration; Energy Secretary Tom Vilsack heads to Pennsylvania
to announce funding for clean energy projects.

Deb Haaland will be in New Orleans to unveil new measures to develop an
offshore wind economy; Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm heads to New
Mexico to talk about new efforts to support domestic solar and wind
manufacturing; and Haaland will cut the ribbon at a new visitors’ center
at Delaware’s First State National Historical Park.

<h2 id="inside-the-super-nintendo-cartridges">Inside the Super Nintendo
cartridges</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-22, from: OS News</p>
<p>One of the remarkable characteristics of the Super Nintendo was the
ability for game cartridges (cart) to pack more than instructions and
assets into ROM chips. If we open and look at the PCBs, we can find
inside things like the CIC copy protection chip, SRAM, and even
“enhancement processors”. ↫ Fabien Sanglard When I was a child and
teenager in the ’90s, the capabilities of the SNES cartridge were a bit
of a legend. We’d talk about what certain games would use which
additional processors and chips in the cartridge, right or wrong, often
boasting about the games we owned, and talking down the games we didn’t.
Much of it was probably nonsense, but there’s some good memories there.
We’re decades deep into the internet age now, and all the mysteries of
the SNES cartridge can just be looked up on Wikipedia and endless
numbers of other websites. The mystery’s all gone, but at least now we
can accurately marvel at just how versatile the SNES really was.</p>

<h2 id="biden-hands-out-7-billion-to-expand-solar-access">Biden Hands
Out $7 Billion to Expand Solar Access</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-22, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjA1NTYxMS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczODc1OTA4Nn0.85WpdmDQyXswEpTnvTRv8IrinPVkbabi1DT5g1yjEnA/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
The great promise of solar panels — in addition to their being
carbon-free — is the democratization of energy. Anyone can produce their
own power, typically for less than the going utility rate. The problem
is that those who stand to benefit the most from this opportunity
<a href="https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy21osti/80532.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>haven’t
been able to access it</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
That pattern could change, however, with Solar for All, a $7 billion
program under the Environmental Protection Agency to support solar in
low- to moderate-income communities. On Monday, the Biden administration
announced it was awarding the funds to 60 state and local governments,
tribes, and national and regional nonprofits, at an average grant size
of more than $80 million.
</p>
<p>
The funding will be used to design new programs and bolster existing
ones that subsidize the cost of rooftop solar installations, community
solar projects and battery storage. During a press call on Friday, the
administration said the awardees have committed to deliver at least 20%
utility bill savings to the households they serve.
</p>
<p>
To get a sense of how transformative Solar for All could be, it’s
helpful to look at the numbers. According to
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/scep/low-income-energy-affordability-data-lead-tool-and-community-energy-solutions" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Department
of Energy data</u></a>, low- to moderate-income households spend an
average of 6% of their income on energy, with some paying as much as
30%, whereas households at higher income levels spend an average of just
2%. As much as
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/justice/articles/households-color-continue-experience-energy-insecurity-disproportionately-higher" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
quarter of the country reports</u></a> having struggled to pay electric
bills, sacrificing basic needs like food and medicine or keeping their
homes at unsafe temperatures because of energy concerns.
</p>
<p>
The number of these households installing rooftop solar has been
increasing steadily year over year, but in 2022, they still made up only
about 22% of installations, though they represent about 43% of the
population.
</p>
<center>
<iframe aria-label="Interactive line chart" data-external="1" frameborder="0" height="454" id="datawrapper-chart-JliCa" scrolling="no" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/JliCa/3/" style="border: none;" title="Solar’s Wealth Disparity" width="680">
</iframe>
<p style="text-align: left;">
The disparity is largely due to the high up-front cost of a solar
installation, plus the fact that lower-income Americans are less likely
to own their homes. While there’s a federal tax incentive to bring down
the cost, low-income households may not have the tax liability to take
advantage of it. They also are more likely to live in older homes that
require roof repairs, the cost of which are often not covered by
incentive programs.
</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
Solar for All represents a potential step change. In at least 25 of the
states and territories awarded through the program, there are no
pre-existing low-income solar programs. The EPA estimates that the funds
will help more than 900,000 households see the benefits of solar. It
will also increase resilience in low-income communities during power
outages by giving more households access to backup batteries.
</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
Biden and his cabinet are taking a victory lap this week in honor of
Earth Day, with a national tour of events and announcements related to
the president’s climate and environmental record. In addition to Solar
For All, the administration also launched a new
<a href="http://climatecorps.gov" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>web
portal</u></a> for the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/the-climate-corps-invests-in-a-different-kind-of-green-economy" target="_self"><u>American
Climate Corps</u></a> on Monday, which lists nearly 2,000 training and
job opportunities in fields like solar installation and mangrove
restoration.
</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
With this $7 billion heading out the door this summer, Biden will soon
have distributed the full $27 billion that Congress allocated to a
program called the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund two years ago when it
passed the Inflation Reduction Act. The initial $20 billion was awarded
in early April to launch a
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/the-biden-administration-is-unleashing-20-billion-for-green-banks" target="_self"><u>national
network of green banks</u></a> that will provide low-cost loans and
other affordable finance options for climate adaptation and mitigation
initiatives.

J. Blige, Cher, Ozzy Osbourne, others picked for Rock Hall of Fame</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>new york — Mary J. Blige,Cher, Foreigner, A Tribe Called Quest, Kool
&amp; The Gang and Ozzy Osbourne have been inducted into the Rock &amp;
Roll Hall of Fame, a class that also includes folk-rockers Dave Matthews
Band and singer-guitarist Peter Frampton.</p>
<p>Alexis Korner, John Mayall and Big Mama Thornton earned the Musical
Influence Award, while the late Jimmy Buffett, MC5, Dionne Warwick and
Norman Whitfield will get the Musical Excellence Award. Pioneering music
executive Suzanne de Passe won the Ahmet Ertegun Award.</p>
<p>“Rock ‘n’ roll is an ever-evolving amalgam of sounds that impacts
culture and moves generations,” John Sykes, chairman of the Rock &amp;
Roll Hall of Fame Foundation, said in a statement. “This diverse group
of inductees each broke down musical barriers and influenced countless
artists that followed in their footsteps.”</p>
<p>The induction ceremony will be held October 19 at the Rocket Mortgage
Fieldhouse in the city of Cleveland in the U.S. state of Ohio. It will
stream live on Disney+ with an airing on ABC at a later date and
available on Hulu the next day.</p>
<p>The music acts nominated this year but didn’t make the cut included
Mariah Carey, Lenny Kravitz, the late Sinead O’Connor, soul-pop singer
Sade, Britpoppers Oasis, hip-hop duo Eric B. &amp; Rakim, and
alt-rockers Jane’s Addiction.</p>
<p>There had been a starry push to get Foreigner — with the hits
“Urgent” and Hot Blooded” — into the hall, with Mark Ronson, Jack Black,
Slash, Dave Grohl and Paul McCartney all publicly backing the move.
Ronson’s stepfather is Mick Jones, Foreigner’s founding member,
songwriter and lead guitarist.</p>
<p>Osbourne, who led many parents in the 1980s to clutch their pearls
with his devil imagery and sludgy music, goes in as a solo artist,
having already been inducted into the hall with metal masters Black
Sabbath.</p>
<p>Four of the eight nominees — Cher, Foreigner, Frampton and Kool &amp;
the Gang — were on the ballot for the first time.</p>
<p>Cher — the only artist to have a Number 1 song in each of the past
six decades — and Blige, with eight multi-platinum albums and nine
Grammy Awards, will help boost the number of women in the hall, which
critics say is too low.</p>
<p>Artists must have released their first commercial recording at least
25 years before they’re eligible for induction.</p>
<p>Nominees were voted on by more than 1,000 artists, historians and
music industry professionals. Fans voted online or in person at the
museum, with the top five artists picked by the public making up a
“fans’ ballot” that was tallied with the other professional ballots.</p>
<p>Last year, Missy Elliott, Willie Nelson, Sheryl Crow, Chaka Khan,
“Soul Train” creator Don Cornelius, Kate Bush, and the late George
Michael were some of the artists who got into the hall.</p>

court stifles US city’s efforts to remove Columbus statue</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PITTSBURGH — An appeals court in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania has
kept alive an Italian heritage group’s challenge to efforts by the city
of Pittsburgh to remove a statue of Christopher Columbus from a city
park.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth Court on Friday sent the dispute over the 13-foot
bronze and granite Schenley Park statue back to Allegheny County Common
Pleas Court for further consideration of issues raised by opponents of
the removal.</p>
<p>The Italian Sons and Daughters of America filed suit in October 2020
after the Pittsburgh Art Commission voted to remove the statue and
then-Mayor Bill Peduto also recommended its removal. The group argued
that the mayor could not override a 1955 city council ordinance that
cleared the way for installation of the 800-pound statue. City attorneys
argued that the legislation was more akin to a resolution accepting a
gift and no council action to rescind it was needed.</p>
<p>Common Pleas Judge John McVay Jr., after urging both sides for two
years to work out a solution such as relocation, ruled in 2022 that
because the statue is in a city-owned park, it represents government
speech. But the Commonwealth Court wrote Friday that McVay erred in
concluding that the group’s claims “are barred in their entirety,”
rejecting what it called the idea that claims of violations of the
city’s charter, code and ordinance were “irrelevant procedural
quibbles.”</p>
<p>The appellate court did reject the group’s challenge to McVay’s
refusal to remove himself from the case.</p>
<p>Philadelphia attorney George Bochetto, who filed the lawsuit and
subsequent appeal on behalf of the group, hailed the ruling and called
on the new mayor to “sit down with me to reach a resolution without
further costly litigation.” A message seeking comment was sent Sunday to
a spokesperson for the Pittsburgh mayor.</p>
<p>The Schenley Park statue, vandalized several times, was wrapped in
plastic in 2020, but local news reports indicate that much of the
covering has since worn away or perhaps been removed, although the head
remains covered.</p>
<p>Disputes over Columbus statues have roiled other cities across the
nation, including Philadelphia on the other side of the state, where
supporters in a city with a deep Italian heritage say they consider
Columbus an emblem of that heritage. Former Mayor Jim Kenney, however,
said Columbus, venerated for centuries as an explorer, had a “much more
infamous” history, enslaving Indigenous people and imposing harsh
punishments.</p>
<p>After 2020 protests about racial injustice and the statue, Kenney
ordered the 1876 statue’s removal, calling it a matter of public safety.
But a judge reversed that decision, saying the city had failed to
provide evidence of a public safety need for removal. In December 2022,
a plywood box covering the statue was removed by judicial order. The
group that fought for retention of the statue and removal of the
covering filed suit last year alleging that officials conspired to abuse
the legal process in trying to remove the statue, The Philadelphia
Inquirer reported.</p>
<p>Columbus statues have been removed in nearby Camden, New Jersey, and
Wilmington, Delaware. In Richmond, Virginia, a statue of Christopher
Columbus was torn down, set on fire and thrown into a lake. In Columbia,
South Carolina, the first U.S. city named for Columbus, a statue of the
explorer was removed after it was vandalized several times. Another
vandalized statue in Boston also was removed from its pedestal.</p>
