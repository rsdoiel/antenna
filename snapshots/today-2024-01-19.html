2600’s amazing Hackers on Planet Earth con may go down to
enshittification (19 Jan 2024)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-19, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links 2600’s amazing Hackers on Planet Earth con may go down
to enshittification: Remember, hacking is more than just a crime: it’s a
survival trait. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in
history: 2014 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent
appearances, current writing projects, current reading 2600’s amazing
Hackers on Planet Earth con may go down to enshittification (permalink)
It’s been 40 years since Emmanuel Goldstein launched the seminal,
essential, world-changing 2600: The Hacker Quarterly. 2600 wasn’t the
first phreak/hacker zine, but it was the most important, spawning a
global subculture dedicated to the noble pursuit of technological
self-determination: https://www.2600.com/ 2600 has published hundreds of
issues in which digital spelunkers report eagerly on the things they’ve
discovered by peering intently at the things no one was supposed to even
glance at (I’m proud to be one of those writers!). They’ve fought legal
battles, including one that almost went to the Supreme Court:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeCSS They created a global network of
meetups where some of technology’s most durable friendships and
important collaborations were born. These continue to this day:
https://www.2600.com/meetings And they’ve hosted a weekly radio show on
NYC’s WBAI, Off the Hook: https://wbai.org/program.php?program=76 When
WBAI management lost their minds and locked the station’s most beloved
hosts out of the studio, Off the Hook (naturally) led the rebellion,
taking back the station for its audience, rescuing it from a managerial
coup: https://twitter.com/2600/status/1181423565389942786 But best of
all, 2600 gave us HOPE – both in the metaphorical sense of “hope for a
better technological tomorrow” and in the literal sense, with its
biannual Hackers On Planet Earth con:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers_on_Planet_Earth For decades HOPE
had an incredible venue, the Hotel Pennsylvania (memorialized in the
phreak anthem “PEnnsylvania 6-5000”), a crumbling pile in midtown
Manhattan that was biannually transformed into a rollicking, multi-day
festival of forbidden technology, improbable feats, and incredible
presentations. I was privileged to keynote HOPE in 2016:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1D7APjmVbk But after the 2018 HOPE, the
Hotel Pennsylvania was demolished to make way for the Penn15 (no,
really) skyscraper, a vaporware mega-tower planned as a holding pen for
luxury shopping and empty million-dollar condos sold to offshore
war-criminals as safe-deposit boxes in the sky. The developer, Vornado
(no, really) hasn’t actually done all that – after demo’ing the Hotel
Pennsylvania, they noped out, leave a large, unusable scar across
midtown. But HOPE wasn’t lost. In 2022, the ever-resilient 2600 crew
relocated to Queens, hosted by St John’s University – a venue that was
less glamorous that the Hotel Pennsylvania, but the event was still
fantastic. Attendance fell from 2,000 to 1,000, but that was something
they could work with, and reviews from attendees were stellar. Good
thing, too. 2600 is, first and foremost, a magazine publisher, and these
have been hard years for magazines. First there was the mass die-off of
indie bookstores and newsracks (I used to sell 2600 when I was a
bookseller, and in the years after, I always took the presence of 2600
on a store’s newsrack as an unimpeachable mark of quality). Thankfully
for 2600, their audience is (unsurprisingly) a tech-savvy one, so they
were able to substitute digital subscriptions for physical ones:
https://www.2600.com/Magazine/DigitalEditions Of course, many of those
subscriptions came through Amazon’s Kindle, because nerds were early
Amazon adopters, and because the Kindle magazine publishing platform
offered DRM-free distribution to subscribers along with a fair payout to
publishers. But then Amazon enshittified its magazine system. Having
locked publishers to its platform, it rugged them and killed the monthly
subscription fees that allowed publishers to plan for a steady output.
Publishers were given a choice: leave Amazon (and all the readers locked
inside its walled garden) or put your magazine into the Kindle Unlimited
system:
https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/arp/B0BWPTCP4K?deviceType=A1FG5NAKX0MRJL
Kindle Unlimited is an all-you-can-eat program for Kindle, which pays
publishers and writers based on a system that is both opaque and easily
gamed, with the lion’s share of the money going to “publishers” who
focus on figuring out how to cheat the algorithm. Revenues for 2600 –
and all the other magazines that Amazon had sucked in and sucked dry –
fell off a cliff. Which brings me to the present moment. After 40 years,
2600 is still at it, having survived the bookstorepocalypse, the lunacy
of public radio management, the literal demolition of their physical
home by an evil real-estate developer, and Amazon’s crooked accounting.
This is 2600, circa 2024, and 2024 a HOPE year: https://www.hope.net/
Once again, HOPE has been scheduled for its new digs in Queens, July
12-14. Last week, HOPE sent out an email blast to their subscribers
telling them the news. They expected to sell 500 tickets in the first 24
hours. They didn’t even come close:
https://www.2600.com/content/hope-ticket-sales-update It turns out that
Google and the other major mail providers don’t like emails with the
word “hacker” in them. The cartel that decides which email gets
delivered, and which messages go to spam, or get blocked altogether,
mass-blocked the HOPE 2024 announcement. Email may be the last
federated, open platform we have, but mass concentration has created a
system where it’s nearly impossible to get your email delivered unless
you’re willing to play by Gmail’s rules:
https://pluralistic.net/2021/10/10/dead-letters/ For Emmanuel Goldstein,
founder of 2600 and tireless toiler for this community, the deafening
silence following from that initial email volley was terrifying: “like
some kind of a”Twilight Zone” episode where everyone has disappeared.”
The enshittification that keeps 2600’s emails from being delivered to
the people who asked to receive them is even worse on social media.
Social media companies routinely defraud their users by letting them
subscribe to feeds, then turning around to the people and organizations
that run those feeds and saying, “You’ve got x thousand subscribers on
this platform, but we won’t put your posts in their feeds unless you pay
us to ‘boost’ your content”:
https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/04/platforms-decay-lets-put-users-first
Enshittification has been coming at 2600 for decades. Like other forms
of oddball media dedicated to challenging corporate power and government
oppression, 2600 has always been a ten-years-ahead preview of the way
the noose was gonna tighten on all of us. And now, they’re on the ropes.
HOPE can’t sell tickets unless people know about HOPE, and neither email
providers nor social media platforms have any interest in making that
happen. A handful of giant corporations now get to decide what we read,
who we hear from, and whether and how we can get together in person to
make friends, forge community, rabble-rouse and change the world. The
idea that “it’s not censorship unless the government does it” has always
been wrong (not all censorship violates the First Amendment, and
censorship can be real without being unconstitutional):
https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/04/yes-its-censorship/ What can you do
about it? Well, for one thing, you can sign up for HOPE. It’s gonna be
great. They’ve got sub-$100 hotel rooms! In New York City!
https://store.2600.com/products/tickets-to-hope-xv If you can’t make it
to HOPE, you can sign up for a virtual membership:
https://store.2600.com/products/tickets-to-hope-xv-virtual-attendee You
can submit a talk to HOPE: https://www.hope.net/cfp.html You can
subscribe to 2600, in print or electronically (I signed up for the
lifetime print subscription and it was a bargain – I devour every issue
the day it arrives):
https://store.2600.com/collections/subscriptions-renewals 2600 is living
a decade in the future of every other community you care about, weird
hobby you enjoy, con you live for, and publication you read from cover
to cover. If we can all pull together to save it, it’ll be a beacon of
hope (and HOPE). Hey look at this (permalink) 48,000 companies sent

Today, the World Economic Forum is wrapping up in Davos, Switzerland.
There, meetings have been held between company heads and global leaders.
Key themes include artificial intelligence, increasingly complicated
relationships between world powers and prospects of another potential
Donald Trump administration. We’ll outline the results of some of these
meetings. But first, how are consumers feeling? A lot of it has to do
with how they’re doing relative to inflation.

New Sculpture Garden in Miami Built to Withstand Heat and Floods</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-19, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTA3MjAyOC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1Mzg1NDA0NH0.QEt5wsy3mvTIUcqlyBY8Ro0b6X-Ss3WsiVuw6ZcKbbc/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
The Underline in Miami is a 10-mile trail that will, over the next few
years, repurpose 120 acres of unused land into an urban mobility
corridor for pedestrians, dogs, bikers, and skateboarders. The route
runs under the Metrorail rapid transit tracks from the financial
district at the northernmost end all the way south to Dadeland. It’s New
York’s Highline at ground level.
</p>
<p>
For now, only the half-mile-long Phase 1 is complete; the 2-plus-mile
Phase 2 will be finished by this spring, and the remaining leg by 2026.
Phase 1 begins at a green space called Brickell Backyard near the Miami
River in the Brickell District and includes a sculpture garden designed
by Miami-based mixed-media artist Typoe Gran.
</p>
<p>
I caught up with Gran last month at the Art Basel fair in Miami, where
he was celebrating the launch of a permanent chandelier-inspired
installation at the Rimowa store in Miami’s Design District. I am
inspired by the joy and playfulness in his work, which is rare in
climate design.
</p>
<p>
We talked about his inspiration for the Sculpture Garden and the unique
challenges of designing a permanent, durable play park that can also
withstand extreme weather conditions in Miami. Our conversation has been
edited for length and clarity.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What is your approach to design at Primary, your gallery in
Miami?</strong>
</p>
<p>
My partners, Cristina Gonzalez and Books Bischof, and I started Primary
in 2007, and it began as a public art project in Miami’s Wynwood
neighborhood. I have always been fascinated by Friedrich Fröbel who
created kindergarten and children’s building blocks. My work often
involves creating larger-than-life sculptures and murals that remind us
of the importance of play and experimentation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>How did you get connected to the Underline Sculpture Garden
project?</strong>
</p>
<p>
The Underline project was really cool because I knew the curator and
there was a great team with such an accumulation of knowledge working on
how to build it and create beautiful areas for people to come together.
</p>
<p>
Our pitch was to build a space where people can play, connect, grow, and
be inspired to use their imagination. The most important thing was
igniting their imagination. I arrived to the Underline team with an
already-funded idea and got it greenlit from the beginning.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What was your approach to designing the Sculpture
Garden?</strong>
</p>
<p>
I looked at multiple sites along the beginning of the path, and the area
I chose was the densest in terms of people walking around, which was
exciting to me. I wanted a spot where there would be people. It was also
located at a position where the train line split a gentrified area with
luxury brands and a super mall on one side, with a rougher area on the
other side. I liked being the connector of these areas.
</p>
<p>
It was also the saddest-looking area! Dead plants, nothing there, with
just a pathway through it. It was underneath the Metrorail, so it would
offer protection from sun — you could still play and it wouldn’t be
blistering hot, and you’d be shielded from rain. This was a beautiful
start because the area was underutilized and I had to figure out how to
make it a destination.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Tell me about your design approach to the location.</strong>
</p>
<p>
What we designed is not officially a playground but a sculpture garden,
with benches and big sculptures you can look at that are playful and
reference adolescent activity.
</p>
<p>
The material we used is important because of the environment. The sun is
hot. There is a small amount of salt water in the air, and that affects
metals and paints on metals — we didn’t want to deal with rust, plus
metal gets hot. So, we thought it would be cool to make fiberglass
sculptures — what we make boats out of. Fiberglass offers a lighter load
and is simple to install. Also, it looks clean and shiny and doesn’t get
too hot, so kids can touch and play on it and it’s safe — there are no
sharp edges and no one gets hurt. We sloped the concrete so when it
rains, the water runs into the plants. It’s just a slight tilt and not
noticeable to the naked eye.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Your Habitable score for the Sculpture Park shows
<a href="https://habitableliving.com/climatecheck/25.7579226/-80.3789563/SW%2010th%20Street%20and%20Southwest%2011th%20Street,%20Miami,%20Florida%2033199,%20United%20States/us" target="_blank">extreme
flood and heat risk</a>. Were you aware of this when you built the park?
What decisions did you have to make?</strong>
</p>
<p>
I have never seen it underwater. That zone is still slightly higher than
the street, and again, we tilted the path so that the water slides off
into the planter areas.
</p>
<p>
[It was] tricky because there is not a full-time irrigation system
throughout the Underline and we had to be specific about choosing plants
that could last without watering. We used temporary sprinklers to get
the plants established and then rely on native plants that would thrive
without a lot of watering.
</p>
<p>
<strong>How does the park perform? Has it had to withstand a hurricane
yet?</strong>
</p>
<p>
This sculpture garden has been alive only for a year, so it hasn’t lived
through a hurricane yet. But I’ve gone there a lot and it’s cool to see
people eating lunch, taking work breaks and taking pictures.
</p>
<p>
Early on, I would’ve thought it would be a place for kids to play. But
I’ll see an elderly man taking selfies with the sculptures. It makes me
happy that their imagination is going and my sculptures and park are in
conversation with people.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Is there anything you would’ve done differently?</strong>
</p>
<p>
It all turned out, luckily, exactly how I had hoped. And of course, now
I have ideas for more parks. Next, I want to do a really big one! I’m in
talks with multiple cities and countries to figure out where the next
park will be.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What are your three top takeaways for park designers?</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>1. </strong>Before I even thought about what I was going to do,
I had to think about the landscape. It was partial shade, heat, salt
water, flooding. I had to take all of that into consideration.The
fiberglass sculptures had to be engineered and rated for hurricanes and
engineered with metal plates so that we can unbolt from a side hatch and
easily move [them], but [also] will never move during a storm — the last
thing we want is a sculpture flying into someone’s house. We had to have
an engineer design for all possible weather conditions.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2. </strong>Design for the world we are living in, not the one
we wish we were living in. You have to consider the human element: Are
people going to try to sleep in my park? Or is it a place where everyone
tries to skate on it?
</p>
<p>
<strong>3. </strong>Graffiti! We had to put a special clear coat on all
the surfaces so the graffiti could be taken off. You have to expand your
mind to consider every type of human being who is going to be in the
park and accept it — whatever can happen might. You have to prepare for
the worst. People are going to write, sleep and skate all over it, so
design for it!

<h2 id="serving-oddµ-via-a-socket">Serving Oddµ via a socket</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-19, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
Serving Oddµ via a socket
</h1>
<p>
Recently, <a href="http://the-brannons.com/">Chris Brannon</a> sent me a
patch for <a href="Odd%C2%B5">Oddµ</a> that allowed it to listen at a
Unix-domain socket instead of a host and port.
</p>
<p>
I decided to investigate since I don’t know anything about sockets. If
you see something that can be improved, let me know.
</p>
<p>
I’m going to use systemd, but for my user.
</p>
<p>
I have two files, one for the socket and one for the service. These are
not the same files as the ones provided with the Oddµ sources. Those are
intended to be used together with a web server that acts as a reverse
proxy. These files are for me testing the installation using netcat and
curl.
</p>
<h2>
Socket
</h2>
<p>
Make sure the directory for the socket exists:
</p>
<pre><code>mkdir --parents /home/alex/.local/run/oddmu
</code></pre>
<p>
This is the file “oddmu-unix-domain.socket”:
</p>
<pre><code>[Unit]
Description=Oddmu server socket
[Socket]
ListenStream=/home/alex/.local/run/oddmu/oddmu.sock
Accept=no
[Install]
WantedBy=sockets.target
</code></pre>
<p>
Enable and start it:
</p>
<pre><code>systemctl --user enable ./oddmu-unix-domain.socket
systemctl --user start oddmu-unix-domain.socket
</code></pre>
<h2>
Service
</h2>
<p>
Make sure the directory for the wiki exists and copy the template files:
</p>
<pre><code>mkdir --parents /home/alex/.local/share/oddmu
cp *.html /home/alex/.local/share/oddmu
</code></pre>
<p>
This is the file “oddmu-unix-domain.service”:
</p>
<pre><code>[Unit]
Description=Oddmu
After=network.target
Requires=oddmu-unix-domain.socket
[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=always
StandardInput=socket
StandardOutput=journal
StandardError=journal
ExecStart=/home/alex/src/oddmu/oddmu
WorkingDirectory=/home/alex/.local/share/oddmu
Environment=&quot;ODDMU_WEBFINGER=1&quot;
Environment=&quot;ODDMU_LANGUAGES=de,en&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>
This doesn’t limit a lot of capabilities, but I guess I trust my own
code.
</p>
<p>
Install it:
</p>
<pre><code>systemctl --user enable ./oddmu-unix-domain.service
systemctl --user start oddmu-unix-domain.service
</code></pre>
<h2>
Test
</h2>
<p>
Check the journal:
</p>
<pre><code>journalctl --user --follow --unit oddmu-unix-domain
</code></pre>
<p>
Do some requests using netcat:
</p>
<pre><code>echo -e &quot;GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: localhost\r\n\r\n&quot; \
  | ncat --unixsock ~/.local/run/oddmu/oddmu.sock
echo -e &quot;GET /view/index HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: localhost\r\n\r\n&quot; \
  | ncat --unixsock ~/.local/run/oddmu/oddmu.sock
echo -e &quot;GET /edit/index HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: localhost\r\n\r\n&quot; \
  | ncat --unixsock ~/.local/run/oddmu/oddmu.sock
</code></pre>
<p>
Using curl:
</p>
<pre><code>curl --unix-socket ~/.local/run/oddmu/oddmu.sock \
  http://localhost/edit/index
curl --unix-socket ~/.local/run/oddmu/oddmu.sock \
  --form body=&quot;Hello!&quot; http://localhost/save/index
curl --unix-socket ~/.local/run/oddmu/oddmu.sock \
  http://localhost/view/index
</code></pre>
<h2>
What now?
</h2>
<p>
I don’t think I’m going to change my web server setup. But using sockets
and <code>systemctl –user</code> has been interesting.
</p>
<p>
Thank you, Chris Brannon, for sending that patch!

to</a> the U.K.’s Met Office. The emissions increase could push
atmospheric CO2 levels beyond the threshold for limiting global warming
to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Driving the surge in
emissions is the continued use of fossil fuels, plus the El Niño weather
pattern. But even without El Niño, “human-induced emissions would still
cause the CO2 rise in 2024 to be on the absolute limits of compliance
with the 1.5°C pathways,” said the Met Office’s Richard Betts.
Scientists say surpassing 1.5 degrees in warming could trigger tipping
points and irreversibly alter the global climate system.

<strong></strong>Global demand for oil will grow this year by about 1.2

put out by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).
The IEA said rising popularity of electric vehicles, plus improvements
in energy efficiency, is curbing oil usage overall, but economic growth
across the world, combined with lower crude prices, is buoying demand in
the short term. The agency predicts that oil demand will peak by 2030.

<li>Biden administration taps 22 million acres for potential solar
development
</h3>
<p>
<strong></strong>In more solar news: The Biden administration this week
identified 22 million acres of federal land across 11 states it thinks
could be used for solar development. The draft plan expands on an
existing Obama-era policy, the Western Solar Plan, that originally
pinpointed areas in six states – Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada,
New Mexico, and Utah – for their solar potential. The updated roadmap
adds Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington, and Wyoming to the mix, focuses
specifically on areas within 10 miles of planned or existing
transmission lines, and steers away from sensitive habitats, historic
land, and old growth forests, <em>Reuters</em>
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=efdb3543a2&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.
Of course not all of this land will be used for solar development, but
the Bureau of Land Management wants to have “maximum flexibility” when
working to meet President Biden’s goal of decarbonizing the U.S. power
grid by 2035.

that the city’s “massive EV ridesharing fleet” exacerbated things by
hogging charging stations: “Since most of these cars are rented out in
an already-cold state and then often driven slowly and on very short
trips, these cars never warm up sufficiently. Add in the fact that most
Uber/Lyft drivers likely know next to nothing about EVs and
preconditioning and you can begin to see why they contributed
significantly to the charging issue in Chicago.”<br/> <br/> Similar

don’t mix</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-19, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
With much of the country frozen right now, some EV owners are going
through their first frigid winter and finding that their cars don’t like
the cold either. Turns out, EVs tend to lose range and take longer to
charge when it’s colder outside. We’ll examine. Plus, Congress approves
their third stopgap funding measure in four months, and we look at the
factors that could keep a lid on home prices.

CIA’s Creative Writing Group</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-19, updated: 2024-01-16, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2024/01/09/invisible-ink-at-the-cias-creative-writing-group/">This</a>
is a fascinating story.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Last spring, a friend of a friend visited my office and invited me to
Langley to speak to Invisible Ink, the CIA’s creative writing group.
</p>
<p>
I asked Vivian (not her real name) what she wanted me to talk about.
</p>
<p>
She said that the topic of the talk was entirely up to me.
</p>
<p>
I asked what level the writers in the group were.
</p>
<p>
She said the group had writers of all levels.
</p>
<p>
I asked what the speaking fee was.
</p>
<p>
She said that as far as she knew, there was no speaking fee.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
What I want to know is, why haven’t I been invited? There are nonfiction
writers in that group…

</p>
<hr />
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Let's start from the basics: can you introduce
yourself?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
Hi! I’m from New Jersey and I live in Brooklyn now. I studied Computer
Science in college a lot time ago, and that led to a series of jobs at
early-stage startups: I’ve worked on CAD software extensions,
visualization tools, geospatial software, and programming tools. It can
be a little hectic, the urgency to get these companies from point A to
B, but I like it.
</p>
<p>
I’ve always had a lot of hobbies, and have kept most of them. Guitar,
banjo, running, art, writing, gardening, hardware projects: having a few
things to do is pretty important to me. The creative energy from one
project can spill over to another, and you can get a fresh perspective
by taking a break from some long-running task.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>What's the story behind your blog?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
When I started writing online in 2010, there were a lot of people
leading the way. I remember
<a href="http://simplebits.com/blog/">SimpleBits</a> and
<a href="https://kottke.org/">kottke</a>,
<a href="http://artypapers.com/">Rebekah Cox</a> and David Heinemeier
Hansson. <a href="https://rsms.me/">Rasmus Andersson</a> had a perfect
look for his blog that heavily influenced mine. One of my earliest jobs,
working at a company called
<a href="https://developmentseed.org/">Development Seed</a>, encouraged
us all to write. Bonnie Bogle, one of the founders, had worked
professionally as a writer and helped a lot with editing and taught us
all how to write for the web.
</p>
<p>
I write to think, so I do it all the time and not just for the blog. I
keep paper journals. I like that quote on the back of all my
<a href="https://fieldnotesbrand.com/">Field Notes</a> notebooks: “I’m
not writing it down to remember it later, I’m writing it down to
remember it now.”
</p>
<p>
For the current blog, I’m kind of proud of how little it’s changed. It’s
so easy to just chase the latest blog software or design, but with my
current blog I’ve been able to really restrain myself. I like the design
and the technology just works. The content has definitely changed as
what I’ve worked on shifted. There’s usually some writing that’s
work-related, some that’s about what I’m interested in now. I’ve added
sections for photos and book reviews.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>What does your creative process look like when it comes to
blogging?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I don’t have a process for getting inspired or finding topics to write
about. I just write about what I’m interested in and what I think is fun
to share. So sometimes months go by without finishing anything, and
sometimes it’s four posts in a month.
</p>
<p>
It’s scary when the inspiration doesn’t come. Right now is one of those
times: it’s been three months since I wrote a standalone blog post. But
I write one a month, always called “Recently,” which is there to keep a
cadence. The Recently posts have a consistent structure and are less of
a commitment to write - I think they’ve helped me keep the habit through
all these years.
</p>
<p>
I don’t have anyone proofread my drafts. I make grammar and spelling
mistakes all the time, and would probably benefit from an editor, but
it’s a solo operation, for better or worse.
</p>
<p>
I don’t write outlines. Sometimes I’ll write multiple drafts when I
can’t figure out which part of the topic is really interesting. I’ll
write long blog posts just to find the 25% that’s actually good, and
I’ll keep just that part.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe
the physical space influences your creativity?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I’m either incredibly neat in my own space, with everything on the table
arranged at right angles, or writing on a laptop at a chaotic cafe. If
I’m listening to anything when I’m writing, it’s
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Hecker">Tim Hecker</a>.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your
tech stack?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
Sure! It’s simple. The blog is generated by
<a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, stored on
<a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> and hosted on
<a href="https://netlify.com/">Netlify</a>. I recently switched to using
Cloudflare as my domain registrar – really happy with them so far. I
also used Cloudflare to store photos, with their R2 service. I also have
my own email address on the site, using Fastmail, which is fantastic.
</p>
<p>
And that’s really it – it’s a static site. I’ve made small changes to
the tech stack like switching from GitHub Pages to Netlify and from
Gandi to Cloudflare. But overall, I’ve used simple tools to make
something simple and it has been unproblematic.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would
you do anything differently?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
Not really: I like how I have it set up. Maybe I’d use Hugo or Eleventy
instead of Jekyll, just because it’s annoying to set up Ruby on new
computers. But Jekyll has been great otherwise.
</p>
<p>
It’s easy to overcomplicate these things.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Financial question since the web is obsessed with money: how
much does it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost or does it
generate some revenue? And what's your position on people monetising
personal blogs?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
The domain costs about $20 a year. Hosting images on Cloudflare R2 costs
a few cents a month. Fastmail costs $5 a month.
</p>
<p>
Thanks to Brooklyn rents, these numbers are relatively insignificant to
me.
</p>
<p>
I’ve tried a few things to monetize it: affiliate links, hooking up the
Brave Browser’s advertising system, and a ko-fi.com link for donations.
</p>
<p>
I also sell the blog’s theme for $100, because people kept asking for
it. But, I try to make it clear that if you just want to recreate it on
your own or rip off design elements, be my guest, don’t pay me!
</p>
<p>
I shut down the Brave advertising setup, which paid me in BAT tokens,
because the annoyance of accounting for “crypto income” outweighed the
income itself. I don’t use affiliate links anymore – they were always a
paltry income.
</p>
<p>
For me, I’ve had a relatively comfortable career in the tech industry.
The most value that my blog has provided me is job flexibility and
exposure. I feel awkward about the prospect of monetizing my audience
and I have the luxury not to do so.
</p>
<p>
But that’s not a universal experience at all, and I think it’s totally
cool and fair for anyone to monetize their blog. Some people have done
really well that way!
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth
checking out? And also, who do you think I should be interviewing
next?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I read enough tech stuff at work, so I don’t really need programming
blogs. I have a few RSS subscriptions that I still treasure:
<a href="https://www.cycfi.com/">Cycfi Research</a> is from a company
that is building wild MIDI-compatible guitars out of carbon fiber.
<a href="https://zeptobars.com/en/">Zeptobars</a> is a very focused blog
that posts die shots - images of chips after the coating has been etched
away. <a href="https://drewdevault.com/">Drew DeVault’s blog</a> is
software engineering feats of strength and some very strong opinions.
<a href="https://www.lightbluetouchpaper.org/">Light Blue Touchpaper</a>
always has some post about a mind-blowing security vulnerability.
<a href="https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/">Language Log</a> has
wild language-crossover examples. And of course there’s
<a href="https://100r.co/site/log.html">100 Rabbits</a> posting about
their art, programming, music, and boat adventures.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Final question: is there anything you want to share with
us?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
Right now I’m spending a lot of time on
<a href="https://www.val.town/">Val Town</a>, so check that out!

<h2
id="russian-foreign-minister-rejects-us-proposal-to-resume-nuclear-talks">Russian
Foreign Minister Rejects US Proposal to Resume Nuclear Talks</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>moscow — Russia’s top diplomat on Thursday dismissed a U.S. proposal
to resume a dialogue on nuclear arms control, saying it’s impossible
while Washington offers military support to Ukraine. </p>
<p>Speaking at his annual news conference, Foreign Minister Sergey
Lavrov accused the West of fueling global security risks by encouraging
Ukraine to ramp up strikes on Russian territory and warned that Moscow
would achieve its goals in the conflict despite Western assistance for
Kyiv. </p>
<p>Commenting on a U.S. proposal to resume contacts in the sphere of
nuclear arms control, Lavrov described it as “unacceptable,” saying that
Moscow had put forward its stance in a diplomatic letter last month. He
argued that for such talks to be held, Washington first needed to revise
its current policy toward Russia. </p>
<p>White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in June that
the Biden administration was ready to talk to Russia without conditions
about nuclear arms control even as Russia-U.S. ties were at their lowest
point since the Cold War, noting “it is in neither of our countries’
interest to embark on opening the competition in the strategic nuclear
forces.” </p>
<p>But Lavrov charged that Washington’s push for the revival of nuclear
talks has been driven by a desire to resume inspections of Russia’s
nuclear weapons sites. He described such U.S. demands as “indecent” and
cynical in view of Ukraine’s attacks on Russian nuclear-capable bomber
bases during the conflict. </p>
<p>He mocked the U.S. offer to resume nuclear arms dialogue, arguing
that Washington’s position amounts to saying, “We have declared you an
enemy, but we’re ready to talk about how we could look at your strategic
nuclear arsenal again.” </p>
<p>Extensive mutual inspections of nuclear weapons sites were envisaged
by the New START treaty, which then-Presidents Barack Obama and Dmitry
Medvedev signed in 2010. The inspections were halted in 2020 because of
the COVID-19 pandemic and never resumed. </p>
<p>Moscow participation suspended</p>
<p>In February 2023, Russian President Vladimir Putin suspended Moscow’s
participation in the treaty, saying Russia could not allow U.S.
inspections of its nuclear sites at a time when Washington and its NATO
allies have openly declared Moscow’s defeat in Ukraine as their goal.
Moscow emphasized, however, that it wasn’t withdrawing from the pact
altogether and would continue to respect the caps on nuclear weapons the
treaty set. </p>
<p>The New START, the last remaining nuclear arms control pact between
Russia and the United States, limits each country to no more than 1,550
deployed nuclear warheads and 700 deployed missiles and bombers. It’s
set to expire in 2026, and the lack of dialogue on anchoring a successor
deal has worried arms control advocates. </p>
<p>“Amid a ‘hybrid war’ waged by Washington against Russia, we aren’t
seeing any basis, not only for any additional joint measures in the
sphere of arms control and reduction of strategic risks, but for any
discussion of strategic stability issues with the U.S.,” he said. “We
firmly link such possibility to the West fully renouncing its malicious
course aimed at undermining Russia’s security and interests.” </p>
<p>The minister said Washington’s push for restarting nuclear arms talks
was rooted in a desire to “try to establish control over our nuclear
arsenal and minimize nuclear risks for itself,” but added that “those
risks are emerging as a result of forceful pressure on our
country.” </p>
<p>He accused the West of blocking any talks on ending the conflict and
inciting the ramping up of attacks on Russia. </p>
<p>“Such encouragement and the transfer of relevant weapons shows that
the West doesn’t want any constructive solution,” Lavrov said. “The West
is pushing toward the escalation of the Ukrainian crisis, and that
raises new strategic risks.” </p>
<p>Asked if tensions with the West over Ukraine could spiral into a
showdown resembling the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis — when the U.S. and
the Soviet Union found themselves on the edge of nuclear war — Lavrov
sternly warned against encouraging Ukraine to strike targets in
Russia. </p>
<p>He specifically accused Britain of inciting Ukrainian President
Volodymyr Zelenskyy to order such attacks, although he didn’t offer any
proof to back the claim. </p>
<p>“London is literally egging on Zelenskyy to bomb any facilities
anywhere in Russia,” Lavrov said. </p>
<p>‘We will achieve’ goals in Ukraine</p>
<p>He reaffirmed that Russia would pursue what it calls the “special
military operation” regardless of Western pressure. </p>
<p>“We will consistently and persistently press the goals of the special
military operation and we will achieve them,” he said. “They should have
no hope that Russia could be defeated in any way. Those in the West who
fantasize about it have failed to learn history lessons.” </p>
<p>On other foreign policy issues, Lavrov talked at length about growing
influence of the Global South and argued that Western sway in
international affairs was waning. </p>
<p>He hailed Russia-China ties, saying they were going through their
“best period in history” and were stronger than a conventional military
union. </p>
<p>Lavrov reaffirmed Moscow’s call for the creation of an independent
Palestinian state, describing it as the only way to ensure security for
both Palestinians and Israel. He also criticized the U.S.-led attacks on
Yemen, saying that “the more the Americans and the British bomb, the
less desire to talk the Houthis have.”</p>

<h2 id="hans-reiser-on-reiserfs-deprecation-from-the-linux-kernel">Hans
Reiser on ReiserFS deprecation from the Linux kernel</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-19, from: OS News</p>
<p>What follows is a letter from Hans Reiser to myself, which he wrote
some two months back, and has asked me to publish, with his thoughts on
the deprecation of ReiserFS from the Linux kernel. I have transcribed it
to the best of my ability. Plaintext email may not be the best way to
read it, as such, I have also made available PDF and HTML versions of
the letter. ↫ Fredrick R. Brennan Hans Reiser is the creator of the
ReiserFS file system, which used to be a serious contender for the Linux
file system you’d use in the early 2000s. In 2006, Hans Reiser murdered
his wife, and is currently serving a prison sentence for this crime.
Hopefully, after he completes his prison sentence, he can become a
contributing member of society once again, if the professionals and
specialists involved in such matters deem him capable of doing so. The
long letter mentioned here was actually quite a fascinating read, and
details his abrasive behaviour in the Linux world, the design of
ReiserFS and its place in the ecosystem at the time, and his thoughts on
the removal of ReiserFS from the Linux kernel.</p>

<p>Broadcom’s brutal assault on VMware’s product suite continues, with
the company’s new owner this week confirming that it is sunsetting a
massive 56 VMware products and platforms – as investors said this week
that they anticipated a “tectonic shift” in the infrastructure market as
a result.  In a January 15 advisory VMware confirmed tersely that it was
taking a sweeping range of products to “End of Availability” and that
“these products are no longer available for purchase” – although most
remain advertised enthusiastically, for now, on slick corporate website
pages. ↫ Ed Targett The list of products is a thing to behold, for sure.

id="victims-remains-identified-more-than-2-decades-after-attack">9/11
Victim’s Remains Identified More Than 2 Decades After Attack</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>new york — The remains of a man killed at the World Trade Center on
9/11 have been identified more than two decades after the 2001 attacks,
the New York City medical examiner’s office announced Thursday. </p>
<p>John Ballantine Niven of Oyster Bay, New York, was a 44-year-old
executive at Aon Risk Services, an insurance firm on the 105th floor of
Tower 2 of the trade center complex, according to obituaries at the
time. He left a wife and a son who was 18 months old at the time. </p>
<p>Niven is the 1,650th victim identified from the deadliest act of
terrorism on U.S. soil, when hijackers crashed airplanes into the Twin
Towers, killing 2,753 people. </p>
<p>“While the pain from the enormous losses on September 11th never
leaves us, the possibility of new identifications can offer solace to
the families of victims,” New York City Mayor Eric Adams said in a
statement. “I’m grateful for the ongoing work from the Office of Chief
Medical Examiner that honors the memory of John Ballantine Niven and all
those we lost.” </p>
<p>The medical examiner’s office has been using advanced DNA analysis to
identify victim remains in recent years. </p>
<p>Ahead of the anniversary of the attacks last September, the office
said it had identified remains of a man and a woman, though their names
were not made public at the request of their families. </p>
<p>“We will forever remember our heroes who perished on 9/11, and we
appreciate the continuous efforts of forensic experts to help identify
victims,” Oyster Bay Supervisor Joseph Saladino said in a separate
statement. “We’re hopeful that this amazing advance in technology helps
bring peace to Mr. Niven’s family and allows him to eternally rest in
peace.” </p>
<p>Roughly 40% of victims of the World Trade Center attack have yet to
have their remains identified, as few full bodies were recovered when
the giant towers collapsed. </p>
<p>But as DNA testing has evolved, so has the costly, painstaking effort
to connect more than 21,900 bits of remains to individual victims. In
some cases, scientists have gone back to the same bone fragment 10 or
more times, hoping new technology will provide answers. </p>
<p>The 9/11 attacks killed nearly 3,000 people in New York, at the
Pentagon, and near Shanksville, Pennsylvania.</p>

<h2 id="where-have-all-the-flowers-gone">Where have all the flowers
gone?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-18, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
A post from Jason Velazquez called
“<a href="https://www.fromjason.xyz/p/notebook/where-have-all-the-websites-gone/">Where
have all the websites gone?</a>” crossed my socials. It’s a good lament
about the dearth of interesting content on the internet and how we’re
stuck in the same boring content silos.
</p>
<p>
The question reminded me of a song by Pete Seeger called “<em>Where have
all the flowers gone?</em>” In the song Pete wonders aloud about the
flowers now missing from the field…
</p>
<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">

Where have all the flowers gone?
The girls have picked them, every one
Oh, when will you ever learn?
Oh, when will you ever learn?
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
We find out that the girls have picked all the flowers. All of them.
That’s a bit excessive. Why? The second verse explores the young girls’
situation…
</p>
<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">

Oh, when will you ever learn?

</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
The girls got married, good for them! That’s a natural part of growing
up. But what of the husbands and how are they connected to the missing
flowers? Did they use all the flowers for their weddings? The third
verse answers this question.
</p>
<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">

</div>
</div>
<p>
The young men, dressed in uniform, went off to war. The flowers were,
presumably, for their funerals. Pete sure knew how to tell a story.
</p>
<p>
So where have all the websites gone? Well, the people who make them have
all gone to war for the capitalist machine. They grew up and got jobs. A
natural part of growing up. Silos came and plucked their voices.
Invasive memes and short form content grew in their place. Hustle
overtook leisure. Harassment overtook openness. Influence overtook
creativity. An economy of interestingness replaced by one of followers,
likes, and engagement metrics.
</p>
<p>
One important thing to note; websites aren’t extinct. In fact, you’re on
one now! Uploading your own words is ancient technology but still works.
</p>
<p>
I loved Jason’s point about the curators and it illuminated something I
don’t think I fully understood before. Curators and aggregators are
integral to the ecosystem. If we all create, steal, and regurgitate the
same content then we only reinforce our own echo chamber. Aggregators
bridge subcultures in a world of content bubbles and subreddits. They
share curios from the web you may have missed, subverting the FOMO-based
dopamine addiction machine using RSS. They find beauty in the mundane
and surface wisdom from obscure writings. That is valuable, worth more
than gold.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://robinrendle.com/notes/i-am-a-poem-i-am-not-software/">We
are poems, not software</a> and in need of a reforestation of our
curators. To paraphrase Mr. Rogers in these dire times, “Look for the
aggregators…”

<h2 id="us-congress-averts-shutdown-funds-government-into-march">US
Congress Averts Shutdown, Funds Government Into March</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. Congress sent President Joe Biden a short-term
spending bill on Thursday that would avert a looming partial government
shutdown and fund federal agencies into March. </p>
<p>The House approved the measure by a vote of 314-108, with opposition
coming mostly from the more conservative members of the Republican
conference. Shortly before the vote, the House Freedom Caucus announced
it ‘strongly opposes’ the measure because it would facilitate more
spending than they support. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, about half of Republicans joined with Democrats in
passing the third stopgap funding measure in recent months. The action
came a few hours after the Senate had voted overwhelmingly to pass the
bill by a vote of 77-18. </p>
<p>The measure extends current spending levels and buys time for the two
chambers to work out their differences over full-year spending bills for
the fiscal year that began in October. </p>
<p>The temporary measure will run to March 1 for some federal agencies.
Their funds were set to run out Friday. It extends the remainder of
government operations to March 8. </p>
<p>Right wing pressures Johnson</p>
<p>Speaker Mike Johnson has been under pressure from his right flank to
scrap a $1.66 trillion budget deal he reached with Senate Majority
Leader Chuck Schumer earlier this month. Republican Representative Chip
Roy said the continuing resolution passed Thursday will facilitate that
agreement. </p>
<p>“It’s Groundhog Day in the House chamber all the time, every day, yet
again spending money we don’t have,” Roy said. </p>
<p>Johnson has insisted he will stick with the deal, and moderates in
the party have stood behind him. They say that changing course now would
be going back on his word and would weaken the speaker in future
negotiations. </p>
<p>Representative Rosa DeLauro, the ranking Democrat on the House
Appropriations Committee, said Americans expect Congress to govern and
work in a bipartisan fashion. </p>
<p>“Some of my colleagues would see that this government would shut down
and don’t care how hurtful that would be,” DeLauro said. </p>
<p>House Republicans have fought bitterly over budget levels and policy
since taking the majority at the start of 2023. Former House Speaker
Kevin McCarthy was ousted by his caucus in October after striking an
agreement with Democrats to extend current spending the first time.
Johnson also has come under criticism as he has wrestled with how to
appease his members and avoid a government shutdown in an election
year. </p>
<p>“We just needed a little more time on the calendar to do it and now
that’s where we are,” Johnson said Tuesday about the decision to extend
federal funding yet again. “We’re not going to get everything we
want.”</p>
<p>Most House Republicans have refrained so far from saying that
Johnson’s job is in danger. But a revolt of even a handful of
Republicans could endanger his position in the narrowly divided
House. </p>
<p>Representative Bob Good, one of eight Republicans who voted to oust
McCarthy, has been pushing Johnson to reconsider the deal with
Schumer. </p>
<p>“If your opponent in negotiation knows that you fear the consequence
of not reaching an agreement more than they fear the consequence of not
reaching an agreement, you will lose every time,” Good said this
week. </p>
<p>Other Republicans acknowledge Johnson is in a tough spot. “The
speaker was dealt with the hand he was dealt,” said Representative Andy
Barr, noting the constraints imposed by the party’s slim majority. </p>
<p>The short-term measure comes amid negotiations on a separate spending
package that would provide wartime dollars to Ukraine and Israel and
strengthen security at the U.S.-Mexico border. Johnson is also under
pressure from the right not to accept a deal that is any weaker than a
House-passed border measure that has no Democratic support. </p>
<p>Johnson, Schumer and other congressional leaders and committee heads
visited the White House on Wednesday to discuss spending legislation.
Johnson used the meeting to push for stronger border security measures
while Biden and Democrats detailed Ukraine’s security needs as it
continues to fight Russia. </p>
<p>Biden has requested a $110 billion package for the wartime spending
and border security.</p>

<h2 id="asking-people-to-use-less-electricity-works">Asking People to
Use Less Electricity Works</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-18, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTExOTg1OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1MjkyMDgzNn0.KaTMq3XAcMHnMNtKDH7z5YDVtjlcE7cwYdmMzU0JNLg/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
Sometimes to get what you want, all you have to do is ask. That’s what
the organizations managing electricity grids across the country (and
outside of it, but we’ll get to that) learned this week as plunging
temperatures led to
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/texas-grid-demand-cold-mornings" target="_blank">record-high
electricity usage</a> while lights (and heaters) stayed on.
</p>
<p>
One can get an eyeball sense of the effect these voluntary conservation
notices have by looking at the difference between expected electricity
demand versus what actually was needed this week. While some of this
could just be normal forecasting errors, recent history suggests that
big divergences during peak demand hours are likely the result of
requests to use less power.
</p>
<p>
In contrast to
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/texas-grid-cold-uri" target="_blank">past
cold snaps</a> such as Winter Storm Uri in 2021 and Winter Storm Elliott
in 2022, utilities did not need to do any mass “load shedding” —
i.e. rolling blackouts — in order to handle the high demand. During Uri,
much of the Texas electricity system essentially failed for several
days, leading to hundred of deaths, while during Elliott, the Tennessee
Valley Authority instituted rolling blackouts
<a href="https://www.tva.com/newsroom/press-releases/tva-accepts-responsibility-starts-full-review" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">for
the first time ever</a> as hundreds of thousands of Duke Energy
customers in the Carolinas
<a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/duke-energy-apologizes-for-winter-storm-outages-as-ferc-nerc-open-investig/639583/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lost
power.</a>
</p>
<p>
This time around, TVA requested customers conserve power from 6 a.m. to
10 a.m. on Wednesday morning, citing
<a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/weather/2024/01/18/nashville-winter-weather-updates-freezing-rain/72269159007/" target="_blank">extremely
low temperatures</a> throughout the Tennessee Valley and the areas it
serves.
</p>
<p>
TVA was right that the grid would be stressed — it would ultimately
break its
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/tennessee-valley-authority-record-electricity-ercot-texas" target="_blank">all
time record</a> for demand. And yet, that demand peaked on Wednesday
morning at 8 a.m. at 34,376 megawatts, notably short of the forecast
demand of 35,125 MW,
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/electricity/gridmonitor/dashboard/electric_overview/balancing_authority/TVA" target="_blank">according
to Energy Information Administration data</a>.
</p>
<p>
There was also a sizable gap between forecast demand and actual demand
the evening prior, after the TVA put out a release requesting
conservation the following morning, but before the actual conservation
period began. The request was tweeted out a little after 5 p.m. Central
time on Tuesday; by 8 p.m., there was a roughly 3,000 MW gap between
forecast demand and actual demand.
</p>
<p>
Something similar happened earlier this week in Texas. This time, ERCOT,
which runs the market for 90% of the state’s electricity consumption,
issued requests to conserve for Monday and Tuesday mornings. At 9 a.m.
Central time on Monday,
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/electricity/gridmonitor/dashboard/electric_overview/balancing_authority/ERCO" target="_blank">ERCOT
forecasted demand</a> of 83,561 MW, while actual demand was 74,452 MW.
And on Tuesday morning at 8 a.m., forecasted demand was 87,055 MW, while
actual demand was 78,155 MW. ERCOT’s all-time demand record from last
summer still stands, but it broke winter records this week.
</p>
<p>
And in the U.K., the national grid operator has turned this into a
business, paying homes and businesses some $11.4 million so far this
winter to conserve demand in peak moments, according to
<em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-18/uk-grid-operator-paid-9-million-to-shift-winter-power-demand" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a></em>.
The combined energy saving was enough to power six million homes for at
least an hour, per the report.
</p>
<p>
Voluntary conservation calls, while often effective in the short term,
are often an indication that something has probably gone wrong. In both
Texas and the TVA territory, advocates have called for measures to make
grids more resilient and to improve energy efficiency, especially during
cold weather. This means everything from winterizing natural gas
infrastructure to updating building codes to better insulating homes so
that they require less heat during cold snaps.
</p>
<p>
There are also more structured ways to get customers to consume less
electricity during peak demand times than putting out voluntary requests
— so-called “demand response” includes systems of incentives and
payments to use less electricity at peak times. But Texas does not, as
yet, offer them at a
<a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/grid-edge/why-arent-texans-paid-to-help-prevent-blackouts-during-heat-waves" target="_blank">meaningful
scale</a> to residential customers, just businesses.

<h2 id="blinken-heading-to-africa-next-week-on-four-nation-tour">Blinken
Heading to Africa Next Week on Four-Nation Tour</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>State Department — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will travel
to Cape Verde, Ivory Coast, Nigeria, and Angola next week, the State
Department announced, his fourth trip to the African continent.</p>
<p>The trip comes after 17 Cabinet-level official visits last year as a
follow-up to the 2022 U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit in Washington.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden has also expressed his desire to visit Africa
this year, but no definite plans have been announced.</p>
<p>State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Blinken’s six-day
trip will highlight how the United States has accelerated the
U.S.-Africa partnership since the summit, including in areas such as
climate, food and health security.</p>
<p>“He will also emphasize our future-focused economic partnership and
how the United States is investing in infrastructure in Africa to boost
two-way trade, create jobs at home and on the continent, and help Africa
compete in the global marketplace,” Miller said.</p>
<p>Asked if countering China’s influence on the continent would be a
major theme, Molly Phee, assistant secretary of state for African
affairs, said this is more of a preoccupation of the media.</p>
<p>“If China didn’t exist, we would be fully engaged in Africa,” she
said. “Africa is important for its own sake, and it’s important for
American interests.”</p>
<p>Phee mentioned major U.S. infrastructure projects partnering with
Angola and Cape Verde. She said a lot of the news coming out of Africa
is negative, and Blinken’s trip would highlight the positive.</p>
<p>“I think it can highlight the great capacity of African people,
particularly the youth. It can show really forward-looking types of
engagements, for example, our partnership with Angola in outer space,”
she said.</p>
<p>Phee said the Africa Cup of Nations football [soccer] tournament will
be going on, and Blinken hopes to be able to attend a match in person
while in the Ivory Coast.</p>
<p>Phee acknowledged that it is never possible for U.S. officials to get
away from security issues, saying that Blinken would talk about the
situation in the Sahel and coastal West Africa when he visits the Ivory
Coast.</p>
<p>She said Nigeria is dealing with several internal security
challenges, and Angola has played an important role in trying to address
and reduce tensions in the eastern Congo.</p>
<p>In response to a question from VOA about Blinken’s visit to Cape
Verde, Phee said the country is literally the port on Africa’s
doorstep.</p>
<p>“It is also a terrific democracy. It’s a good model for the region,”
she said.</p>

<h2 id="a-lesson-learned">A Lesson Learned</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-18, from: David Rosenthal’s blog</p>
You know how backups work great until you really need them? Below the
fold, a lesson learned from my recent example of this phenomenon.<br />
<span><a name='more'></a></span> <br /> A long time ago I was feeling
rich, so I spent nearly $2000 on one of the first-generation Mac Airs.
This led to me travelling with a
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/12/a-note-of-thanks.html">laptop I
could afford to lose</a> instead. I loved the Air for all sorts of
reasons but one of its important tasks was to back up my iPhone every
day. And, of course, being something of an expert on preserving digital
information, then back up the Air to an external USB hard disk using
Time Machine. <a href="https://www.lockss.org">Lots Of Copies Keep Stuff
Safe</a>.<br /> <br /> In the end I had to upgrade to a more recent M1
Air, not because the old one stopped working, but simply because the USB
ports stoppped working, so it could no longer backup the iPhone or
update the Time Machine disk. The new Air was impressively fast and had
two USB-C ports, which it used both for data and for power. I continued
to back up the iPhone and the Air daily<br /> <br /> Fast forward to
last month. The new Air’s USB-C ports had been a bit flaky for a while,
but now one failed. It wouldn’t transfer data or power. A few days later
the other port stopped transferring power, leaving me with no way to
charge it. It was about 85% charged, so I powered it off.<br /> <br /> I
thought “I’m OK, I have yesterday’s Time Machine so I can get a new M2
Air and initialize it from the disk”. So I ordered a new one and, as
soon as it was delivered, plugged in the Time Machine disk and fired up
the Migration Assistant. It asked me what disk it should use. I wasn’t
able to select the Time Machine disk because, to my surprise, the Air
couldn’t see it. Plugging the disk into my Linux desktop revealed that
in the couple of weeks since the day before the M1 Air failed, the Time
Machine disk had died.<br /> <br /> At this point I remembered that when
I powered it off, the M1 Air still had a USB-C port that transferred
data, even if it didn’t work for power. There were two ways to
initialize the M2 Air using the remaining battery, either create a new
Time Machine disk using the one USB-C port that transferred data, or via
Bluetooth. I found a USB-C external SSD, which I figured would use less
power, powered up the M1 Air, plugged in the drive, started a Time
Machine backup, and crossed my fingers.<br /> <br /> After a long,
agonizing wait the backup finished with still quite a lot of battery
left, so I powered off the M1 Air and used the disk to initialize the M2
Air. Apple’s Migration Assistant worked flawlessly, and I relaxed. The
best thing about the M2 Air is that Apple went back to powering it with
MagSafe! Their fragile USB hardware could no longer prevent the machine
charging.<br /> <br /> So the lesson was that I needed to have
<i>two</i> Time Machine disks and use them alternately, so even if the
most recent one failed I would have a backup only one day older.<br />
<br /> The next problem came when I plugged my iPhone into the M2 Air to
back it up. I got “unknown error 7014”. Google had no trace of “unknown
error 7014” so, baffled, I made an appointment with the “Genius” at
Apple’s Palo Alto store. In the faint hope that the M1 Air could be
fixed, I took both Airs and the iPhone with me.<br /> <br /> The Genius
was very good. He rapidly figured out that:<br />
<ul>
<li>
“unknown error 7014” was caused by the fact that, despite its having
been delivered a few days earlier, the M2 Air’s operating system was
out-of-date. A software update overnight fixed the problem.
</li>
<li>
He confirmed that the M1 Air’s USB-C ports had failed and, to my
surprise, explained that the ports were on a daughter-board that could
be replaced. It was a $15 part and $90 in labor, and completed
overnight.
</li>
</ul>
<p>So now I can travel with a Mac Air.<br /> <br /></p>

Globally, the total value of mergers and acquisitions last year was the
lowest since in a decade, held back by interest rates, a volatile stock
market and a strict regulatory environment. The corporate dealmaking
could rebound this year, though. We’ll also paint a picture of our
economic moment with a slew of recent data. Plus, could passwords be a

did you notice how
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltc909LOR4Q">BMW’s ads</a> say
their product is much better than Tesla’s, without mentioning Tesla,
they just say they’re better, because they are just better, because
they’re BMW, and they know you know that. It’s much more powerful esp
with people who like Telsas (of which I am one). I also see the Tesla as
a very capable replacement for my 2007 BMW 535i, which I donated to
charity in 2012, which I loved for the same reasons I love the Tesla.
Putting down the competition isn’t what marketing is about, you have to
think about the people whose minds you’re trying to change, and know
you’re in it for the long haul. An example of their ad copy: “With
electric driving comes exciting possibilities. That’s why BMW approaches
this new era in mobility just like any other; where engineering,
innovation and aesthetics come together seamlessly to inspire joy in
every journey.” These people understand their product and how their fans
see them.</p>

used for, and were overlooking the ability of the human body to actually

much had been made of this, esp since the current management has been
coasting on innovation done by

hadn’t released anything that wasn’t completely predictable since his
<a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2011/10/06/myThoughtsOnSteveJobs.html">passing
in 2011</a>. Their lack of confidence in their own product overwhelms
any positive reviews coming out from the privileged press, who we know
in advance to discount, these are the press people Apple can count on to
not say a negative word, to preserve their access at least, if not
because they are complete fans. It reeks of a loser product. I write
these things partially so I can be proven ridiculously wrong when I get

Demon-haunted computers are back, baby (17 Jan 2024)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-18, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links Demon-haunted computers are back, baby: Surely no one
will ever find a way to abuse this security system that treats the
computer’s owner as an attacker. Hey look at this: Delights to
delectate. This day in history: 2009, 2014, 2019, 2023 Colophon: Recent
publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects,
current reading Demon-haunted computers are back, baby (permalink) As a
science fiction writer, I am professionally irritated by a lot of sf
movies. Not only do those writers get paid a lot more than I do, they
insist on including things like “self-destruct” buttons on the bridges
of their starships. Look, I get it. When the evil empire is closing in
on your flagship with its secret transdimensional technology, it’s
important that you keep those secrets out of the emperor’s hand. An
irrevocable self-destruct switch there on the bridge gets the job done!
(It has to be irrevocable, otherwise the baddies’ll just swarm the
bridge and toggle it off). But c’mon. If there’s a facility built into
your spaceship that causes it to explode no matter what the people on
the bridge do, that is also a pretty big security risk! What if the bad
guy figures out how to hijack the measure that – by design – the people
who depend on the spaceship as a matter of life and death can’t detect
or override? I mean, sure, you can try to simplify that self-destruct
system to make it easier to audit and assure yourself that it doesn’t
have any bugs in it, but remember Schneier’s Law: anyone can design a
security system that works so well that they themselves can’t think of a
flaw in it. That doesn’t mean you’ve made a security system that works –
only that you’ve made a security system that works on people stupider
than you. I know it’s weird to be worried about realism in movies that
pretend we will ever find a practical means to visit other star systems
and shuttle back and forth between them (which we are very, very
unlikely to do):
https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/09/astrobezzle/#send-robots-instead But
this kind of foolishness galls me. It galls me even more when it happens
in the real world of technology design, which is why I’ve spent the past
quarter-century being very cross about Digital Rights Management in
general, and trusted computing in particular. It all starts in 2002,
when a team from Microsoft visited our offices at EFF to tell us about
this new thing they’d dreamed up called “trusted computing”:
https://pluralistic.net/2020/12/05/trusting-trust/#thompsons-devil The
big idea was to stick a second computer inside your computer, a very
secure little co-processor, that you couldn’t access directly, let alone
reprogram or interfere with. As far as this “trusted platform module”
was concerned, you were the enemy. The “trust” in trusted computing was
about other people being able to trust your computer, even if they
didn’t trust you. So that little TPM would do all kinds of cute tricks.
It could observe and produce a cryptographically signed manifest of the
entire boot-chain of your computer, which was meant to be an unforgeable
certificate attesting to which kind of computer you were running and
what software you were running on it. That meant that programs on other
computers could decide whether to talk to your computer based on whether
they agreed with your choices about which code to run. This process,
called “remote attestation,” is generally billed as a way to identify
and block computers that have been compromised by malware, or to
identify gamers who are running cheats and refuse to play with them. But
inevitably it turns into a way to refuse service to computers that have
privacy blockers turned on, or are running stream-ripping software, or
whose owners are blocking ads:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/08/02/self-incrimination/#wei-bai-bai After
all, a system that treats the device’s owner as an adversary is a
natural ally for the owner’s other, human adversaries. The rubric for
treating the owner as an adversary focuses on the way that users can be
fooled by bad people with bad programs. If your computer gets taken over
by malicious software, that malware might intercept queries from your
antivirus program and send it false data that lulls it into thinking
your computer is fine, even as your private data is being plundered and
your system is being used to launch malware attacks on others. These
separate, non-user-accessible, non-updateable secure systems serve a
nubs of certainty, a remote fortress that observes and faithfully
reports on the interior workings of your computer. This separate system
can’t be user-modifiable or field-updateable, because then malicious
software could impersonate the user and disable the security chip. It’s
true that compromised computers are a real and terrifying problem. Your
computer is privy to your most intimate secrets and an attacker who can
turn it against you can harm you in untold ways. But the widespread
redesign of out computers to treat us as their enemies gives rise to a
range of completely predictable and – I would argue – even worse harms.
Building computers that treat their owners as untrusted parties is a
system that works well, but fails badly. First of all, there are the
ways that trusted computing is designed to hurt you. The most reliable
way to enshittify something is to supply it over a computer that runs
programs you can’t alter, and that rats you out to third parties if you
run counter-programs that disenshittify the service you’re using. That’s
how we get inkjet printers that refuse to use perfectly good third-party
ink and cars that refuse to accept perfectly good engine repairs if they
are performed by third-party mechanics:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/07/24/rent-to-pwn/#kitt-is-a-demon It’s how
we get cursed devices and appliances, from the juicer that won’t squeeze
third-party juice to the insulin pump that won’t connect to a
third-party continuous glucose monitor:
https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/01/unauthorized-bread-a-near-future-tale-of-refugees-and-sinister-iot-appliances/
But trusted computing doesn’t just create an opaque veil between your
computer and the programs you use to inspect and control it. Trusted
computing creates a no-go zone where programs can change their behavior
based on whether they think they’re being observed. The most prominent
example of this is Dieselgate, where auto manufacturers murdered
hundreds of people by gimmicking their cars to emit illegal amount of
NOX. Key to Dieselgate was a program that sought to determine whether it
was being observed by regulators (it checked for the telltale signs of
the standard test-suite) and changed its behavior to color within the
lines. Software that is seeking to harm the owner of the device that’s
running it must be able to detect when it is being run inside a
simulation, a test-suite, a virtual machine, or any other hallucinatory
virtual world. Just as Descartes couldn’t know whether anything was real
until he assured himself that he could trust his senses, malware is
always questing to discover whether it is running in the real universe,
or in a simulation created by a wicked god:
https://pluralistic.net/2022/07/28/descartes-was-an-optimist/#uh-oh
That’s why mobile malware uses clever gambits like periodically checking
for readings from your device’s accelerometer, on the theory that a
virtual mobile phone running on a security researcher’s test bench won’t
have the fidelity to generate plausible jiggles to match the real data
that comes from a phone in your pocket:
https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/01/google-play-malware-used-phones-motion-sensors-to-conceal-itself/
Sometimes this backfires in absolutely delightful ways. When the
Wannacry ransomware was holding the world hostage, the security
researcher Marcus Hutchins noticed that its code made reference to a
very weird website: iuqerfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea.com.
Hutchins stood up a website at that address and every Wannacry-infection
in the world went instantly dormant:
https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/10/flintstone-delano-roosevelt/#the-matrix
It turns out that Wannacry’s authors were using that ferkakte URL the
same way that mobile malware authors were using accelerometer readings –
to fulfill Descartes’ imperative to distinguish the Matrix from reality.
The malware authors knew that security researchers often ran malicious
code inside sandboxes that answered every network query with fake data
in hopes of eliciting responses that could be analyzed for weaknesses.
So the Wannacry worm would periodically poll this nonexistent website
and, if it got an answer, it would assume that it was being monitored by
a security researcher and it would retreat to an encrypted blob, ceasing
to operate lest it give intelligence to the enemy. When Hutchins put a
webserver up at iuqerfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea.com, every
Wannacry instance in the world was instantly convinced that it was
running on an enemy’s simulator and withdrew into sulky hibernation. The
arms race to distinguish simulation from reality is critical and the
stakes only get higher by the day. Malware abounds, even as our devices
grow more intimately woven through our lives. We put our bodies into
computers – cars, buildings – and computers inside our bodies. We
absolutely want our computers to be able to faithfully convey what’s
going on inside them. But we keep running as hard as we can in the
opposite direction, leaning harder into secure computing models built on
subsystems in our computers that treat us as the threat. Take UEFI, the
ubiquitous security system that observes your computer’s boot process,
halting it if it sees something it doesn’t approve of. On the one hand,
this has made installing GNU/Linux and other alternative OSes vastly
harder across a wide variety of devices. This means that when a vendor
end-of-lifes a gadget, no one can make an alternative OS for it, so off
the landfill it goes. It doesn’t help that UEFI – and other trusted
computing modules – are covered by Section 1201 of the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), which makes it a felony to publish
information that can bypass or weaken the system. The threat of a
five-year prison sentence and a $500,000 fine means that UEFI and other
trusted computing systems are understudied, leaving them festering with
longstanding bugs:
https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/09/free-sample/#que-viva Here’s where it
gets really bad. If an attacker can get inside UEFI, they can run
malicious software that – by design – no program running on our
computers can detect or block. That badware is running in “Ring -1” – a
zone of privilege that overrides the operating system itself. Here’s the
bad news: UEFI malware has already been detected in the wild:
https://securelist.com/cosmicstrand-uefi-firmware-rootkit/106973/ And
here’s the worst news: researchers have just identified another
exploitable UEFI bug, dubbed Pixiefail:
https://blog.quarkslab.com/pixiefail-nine-vulnerabilities-in-tianocores-edk-ii-ipv6-network-stack.html
Writing in Ars Technica, Dan Goodin breaks down Pixiefail, describing
how anyone on the same LAN as a vulnerable computer can infect its
firmware:
https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/01/new-uefi-vulnerabilities-send-firmware-devs-across-an-entire-ecosystem-scrambling/
That vulnerability extends to computers in a data-center where the
attacker has a cloud computing instance. PXE – the system that Pixiefail
attacks – isn’t widely used in home or office environments, but it’s
very common in data-centers. Again, once a computer is exploited with
Pixiefail, software running on that computer can’t detect or delete the
Pixiefail code. When the compromised computer is queried by the
operating system, Pixiefail undetectably lies to the OS. “Hey, OS, does
this drive have a file called ‘pixiefail?’” “Nope.” “Hey, OS, are you
running a process called ‘pixiefail?’” “Nope.” This is a self-destruct
switch that’s been compromised by the enemy, and which no one on the
bridge can de-activate – by design. It’s not the first time this has
happened, and it won’t be the last. There are models for helping your
computer bust out of the Matrix. Back in 2016, Edward Snowden and bunnie
Huang prototyped and published source code and schematics for an
“introspection engine”:
https://assets.pubpub.org/aacpjrja/AgainstTheLaw-CounteringLawfulAbusesofDigitalSurveillance.pdf
This is a single-board computer that lives in an ultraslim shim that you
slide between your iPhone’s mainboard and its case, leaving a ribbon
cable poking out of the SIM slot. This connects to a case that has its
own OLED display. The board has leads that physically contact each of
the network interfaces on the phone, conveying any data they transit to
the screen so that you can observe the data your phone is sending
without having to trust your phone. (I liked this gadget so much that I
included it as a major plot point in my 2020 novel Attack Surface, the
third book in the Little Brother series):
https://craphound.com/attacksurface/ We don’t have to cede control over
our devices in order to secure them. Indeed, we can’t ever secure them
unless we can control them. Self-destruct switches don’t belong on the
bridge of your spaceship, and trusted computing modules don’t belong in
your devices. (Image: Mike, CC BY-SA 2.0, modified) Hey look at this

funding for climate adaptation</a> in poorer countries, among other
things. What would his return really mean for the climate movement on a
national and global scale? Here’s a quick opinion roundup:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>The stakes couldn’t be higher: </strong>Trump won’t be able to
stop the green energy transition that’s already underway, but he could
slow it down, U.S. Climate Envoy John Kerry told
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=0ea1ef1b12&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bloomberg
TV</a>. “The marketplace is going to support this transition and it’s
irrevocable now — we’re going to get there. The only question is if
we’re going to get there in time to not be ravaged by the worst
consequences of the climate crisis.”
</li>
<li>
<strong>Gutting the IRA would be very unpopular: </strong>Many
clean-energy programs funded by President Biden’s signature climate bill
are in red states,
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=67e5d1cca6&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">noted
<em>The Economist</em></a>. If Trump nixes them, “he may face pushback
from his own party,” not to mention business leaders. Some automakers,
like GM and Nissan, are already warning against the move.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Trump can’t stop the global momentum:</strong> Of course the
U.S. president’s views on climate matter, but “the world’s in a slightly
different place than it was five years ago,” World Bank President Ajay
Banga
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=e8a7b3af3d&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told
<em>Politico</em></a>. The bank helps finance climate adaptation in
developing countries, and is pushing for more private sector investment
in renewables. Banga suggested international momentum on these issues is
“much bigger than just the U.S. and the EU.”

that concerns about climate change have “a significant and growing
effect on voting that favors the Democrats” and “that climate change
opinion probably cost Republicans the 2020 presidential election, all
else being equal.”

<li>The South smashes electricity records
</h3>
<p>
<strong></strong>The Tennessee Valley Authority, America’s largest
public power company, just set a new record for electricity usage thanks
to the cold weather system hammering huge sections of the country,
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=7403f5b09c&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reports
<em>Heatmap</em>’s Matthew Zeitlin</a>. Consumers used around 34,500
megawatts of electricity yesterday morning, about 1,000 megawatts more
than its previous all-time record of around 33,500 megawatts in August
2007. Like much of the region, Tennesseans largely heat their homes
using electricity as opposed to fuel oil or natural gas. Cold mornings
are particularly challenging for the authority because lots of people
are trying to heat their chilly homes between waking up and going to
work or school. “By contrast, summer afternoons and early evenings are
tough for grids to manage because temperatures stay high even as the sun
goes down and people return to their homes and cool them and start
operating appliances,” Zeitlin explains. The cold snap is expected to
last through the weekend.

<li>Study: Greenland is losing way more ice than experts thought
</h3>
<p>
<strong></strong>The Greenland ice sheet has lost 20% more ice than
scientists previously thought due to global warming, according to new
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=56b8a3ebbd&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">research</a>
published in the journal <em>Nature</em>. The researchers came to this
conclusion by looking at the amount of glacial ice lost around the edges
of the sheet, an area that earlier estimates overlooked. Experts worry
the huge amounts of fresh water pouring into the north Atlantic could
disrupt ocean currents and wreak havoc on global weather patterns.

<li>Scientists urge swift climate action ahead of EU elections

<strong></strong>The European Union needs to double down on plans to
phase out fossil fuels and implement green policies if it wants to reach
its 2050 net zero targets, a
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=5ae9a63ee0&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a>
from the European Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change said. “The
EU needs to sharply decrease the use of fossil fuels, and almost fully
phase out the use of coal and fossil gas in public electricity and heat
generation by 2040,” the advisers said. The report urges the EU to work
quickly to put planned climate policies into law. The timing of the
report is interesting because, as the <em>Financial Times
</em><a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=3ba4995c02&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">explained</a>,
the EU faces parliamentary elections this summer, “when rightwing
parties that want to slow the pace of progress are expected to focus on
rhetoric about the social costs of switching away from fossil fuels to
combat climate change.”

Consumers like that they’re able to spend less money than they would on

Pyongyang Tries to Create Seoul-Tokyo Friction to Harm US Relations</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is trying to create
friction between Tokyo and Seoul, South Korea, and undermine their
trilateral relations with the United States as security cooperation
among them deepens, analysts said.  </p>
<p>Washington, Seoul and Tokyo conducted trilateral naval drills in the
international waters south of Jeju Island from Monday to Wednesday, said
South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS).   </p>
<p>The exercises involving nine ships, including the USS Carl Vinson, a
nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, were aimed at enhancing deterrence
against North Korean nuclear, missile and underwater threats, the JCS
said. </p>
<p>North Korea is taking an increasingly hostile stance toward South
Korea. Calling for the amendment of its constitution to refer to South
Korea as its “principal enemy,” Kim said Pyongyang should plan for
occupying South Korea if war breaks out.   </p>
<p>He made the remarks in a speech on Monday to the Supreme Assembly,
the country’s rubber-stamp parliament, said state media KCNA. </p>
<p>A day earlier, North Korea test-fired what it said was a solid fuel
intermediate range ballistic missile with a hypersonic warhead.</p>
<p>Pyongyang also fired more than 200 rounds of artillery shells near
Yeonpyeong Island on a disputed maritime border with South Korea on
January 5 and more than 60 rounds near the same island on January 7.
Yeonpyeong Island is about 120 kilometers west of Seoul. </p>
<p>While escalating tensions on the Korean Peninsula, Kim sent a message
to Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on January 5 conveying sympathy over a
powerful earthquake that shook Ishikawa prefecture, leaving at least 200
people dead and more than 200 missing as the new year began.  </p>
<p>In the message, Kim expressed “his deep sympathy and condolences” to
Kishida for losses caused by the earthquake, KCNA reported on January 6.
 </p>
<p>Analysts said although North Korea has relayed condolence messages to
Japan after disasters in the past, this is the first time Kim personally
reached out to a Japanese prime minister.</p>
<p>“While Kim Jong Un may wish to drive a wedge between Japan and the
ROK, the real intention, subtle but still real, is to drive a wedge
between Japan and America, in spite of last year’s successes at Camp
David in the trilateral summit,” said Kenneth Dekleva, a senior fellow
at the George H.W. Bush Foundation for U.S.-China Relations.</p>
<p>At the Camp David summit, U.S. President Joe Biden, South Korean
President Yoon Suk Yeol, and Kishida agreed to cooperate on multiple
measures to bolster deterrence against North Korea.</p>
<p>Dekleva, who served as a State Department psychiatrist analyzing
foreign leaders including Kim from 2006 to 2016, continued, “Another
intention of equal importance is to test the U.S.-ROK relationship,
especially given the recent dangerous, bellicose threats of war made
recently by Kim Jong Un.”  </p>
<p>Kim ordered his military forces to prepare for war with the U.S. and
“South Korean puppets and Japs,” according to KCNA, describing Kim’s
speech made at a planning meeting of his ruling Workers’ Party on
December 31.</p>
<p>Pyongyang has been critical of the trilateral ties forged after Seoul
and Tokyo mended relations in March. Disputes rooted in Japan’s
colonization of the Korean Peninsula from 1910 to 1945 had strained
relations for decades.  </p>
<p>Ken Gause, an expert on North Korea’s leadership and political system
at the Center for Naval Analyses,  said Kim’s message also signals
Pyongyang could be “keeping its options open for engagement.”  </p>
<p>“North Korea is trying to put Japan in a situation where it has to
choose between its own self-interest and the self-interest of the
alliance as a whole,” he said.  </p>
<p>Kishida said in May that he is willing to meet Kim to discuss the
return of Japanese who were abducted by North Korea in the 1960s and
1970s.  </p>
<p>At North Korea’s summit with Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro
Koizumi in September 2002, Kim’s father, Kim Jong Il, admitted the
country had abducted 12 Japanese nationals. North Korea returned five of
them to Japan in October of that year. </p>
<p>Japan says North Korea abducted 17 Japanese citizens in the 1970s to
1980s.  </p>
<p>Shihoko Goto, Asia program director at the Wilson Center, said, “The
abduction issue remains a highly emotional agenda in Japan, and moving
forward to seek a resolution is high on the agenda of Kishida’s
government.” </p>
<p>She added that Kim’s message of condolence “was seen favorably in
Tokyo and seen as an opportunity for greater dialogue, if not improved
relations, between the two countries.” </p>
<p>However, she said, Tokyo will be “in lockstep” with Seoul and
Washington in deterring North Korea, as Pyongyang also is “an
existential threat” to Japan.</p>

especially clockwork products are neat, but they are not foldable like a
laptop. When in summer of 2023 Sipeed announced Lichee Console 4A based

id="frigid-weather-compounds-chicagos-struggles-to-house-asylum-seekers">Frigid
Weather Compounds Chicago’s Struggles to House Asylum-Seekers</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>chicago — As temperatures hover below freezing in Chicago, dozens of
asylum-seekers are staying in the lower level of a library until the
bitter cold gripping much of the country lifts. </p>
<p>But after that, Chicago’s plans for offering immediate shelter to the
growing number of migrants arriving in the nation’s third-largest city
remain murky. </p>
<p>For more than a year, Chicago has wrestled with how to house new
arrivals until shelter space is free, utilizing measures that city
leaders insist are a stopgap. Last week, it was parked city buses.
Before that it was police station lobbies and airports. The makeshift
approach has frazzled volunteers, nonprofit groups and migrants wary of
the lack of a long-term plan, particularly during the city’s long
winters. </p>
<p>“The city’s favorite word for everything is ‘temporary,’” said
Vianney Marzullo, a volunteer who has helped migrants staying at O’Hare
International Airport. “It’s their new choice of Band-Aid word.
Everything is temporary, temporary, temporary.” </p>
<p>Chicago has struggled, like New York and Denver, to deal with the
crisis that started in 2022 when migrants began arriving in
Democratic-led cities, largely at the direction of Texas Governot Greg
Abbott. The winter weather has further complicated efforts. Last week,
New York, which has received more than 170,000 migrants, evacuated a
massive tent camp ahead of a storm. Big-city mayors have asked
repeatedly for more federal help. </p>
<p>Chicago’s response has stood out for its haphazard approach with a
heavy reliance on volunteers who have spent more than a year providing
medical care, food and donated items. </p>
<p>City leaders say the situation keeps changing and there have been
snags along the way. </p>
<p>Mayor Brandon Johnson floated the idea of a heated tent encampment,
but construction was scrapped over the risk of contaminants at the
former industrial site. </p>
<p>The city had instituted a 60-day limit for shelter stays but pushed
the first batch of notices off to next week because of the weather.
Meanwhile, the city has been heavily criticized for conditions at its
shelters and the death of a young boy whose family stayed at one. </p>
<p>The political fight has also heated up and spread to the
suburbs. </p>
<p>Abbott’s busing operation has been dropping off migrants at all hours
in different Chicago area cities without coordination. When the city
began fining bus companies and filing lawsuits, Abbott fired back with
chartered planes. Johnson had planned a summit for this week with
suburban mayors to discuss the problem; it was canceled by the weather.
His office didn’t return a request for comment Wednesday. </p>
<p>“This is an international crisis that requires federal intervention
of which local government is subsidizing that work. Never designed to do
it, but yet here we are still standing,” Johnson said last week ahead of
the storm. </p>
<p>Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker also wrote to Abbott last week asking
to suspend buses until the temperatures rise and with many migrants
arriving without winter coats or shoes. But Abbott rejected the notion,
saying the federal government needs to step up. </p>
<p>More than 33,000 migrants, mostly from Venezuela, have arrived in
Chicago since 2022. Currently, nearly 15,000 migrants are living in 28
shelters and the city is continually opening more. Many migrants have
gone elsewhere or live with family and friends in the area. Chicago,
like other cities, has offered bus tickets out of the city. </p>
<p>The city wound down its much-maligned use of police stations to house
migrants, but O’Hare International Airport is still being used, with
some asylum-seekers staying for weeks at a time as they await shelter.
More than 200 were there Wednesday, according to the city. </p>
<p>Until the weather turned, the city was keeping migrants aboard eight
city buses that were running continuously and parked near a downtown
highway in an area designated “the landing zone.” </p>
<p>Six heated tents are under construction nearby, which the city says
will be used for intake and services, such as medical care. It’s unclear
if they will also be used for housing. </p>
<p>Marylin Gonzalez, 34, slept on the buses last week along with her
husband and three children, ages 15, 16 and 18. The buses were crowded,
with sicknesses spreading quickly. </p>
<p>Gonzalez described the atmosphere aboard as tense, with many worried
about where they would go. She said it made her feel like a
prisoner. </p>
<p>“The children are stressed. People get stressed, they argue, they are
already desperate,” she said. “Sometimes we have to sleep sitting up
because there is no space to lay down.” </p>
<p>Outside the buses, many would take up activities, like throwing
around a football, to keep warm. </p>
<p>The landing zone was cleared of people and vehicles on Monday, but by
Wednesday morning, the empty warming buses were parked there again, a
signal that the city intends to return to using them. The city’s Office
of Emergency Management didn’t respond to questions Wednesday about the
city’s plans when the weather warms. </p>
<p>Roughly 50 migrants were staying in the lower level of the Harold
Washington Library Center, the city’s flagship location downtown during
the cold snap, according to people staying there. Migrants, including
those who came in on their own to avoid the cold, were living with
others facing homelessness. According to the city’s tally, 5 migrants at
the library site were on lists for shelters. An Associated Press
reporter was not allowed inside. </p>
<p>Angel Alberto Chourio, 30, slept there over the weekend, saying he
was trying to figure out his next steps. He and a friend arrived from
Venezuela last year. The promise of work out of state didn’t pan out, so
they came back to Chicago recently. Without any place else to go, they
came to the library. </p>
<p>He said Wednesday that he was nervous about the shelter stay limits
and was not on a waiting list for one. </p>
<p>“We are not used to this. The cold is too much, since it is already
below zero,” he said, looking for a silver lining. “At least they give
one a chance to continue living.”</p>

id="biden-convenes-top-congressional-leaders-to-discuss-ukraine-aid-us-border-deal">Biden
Convenes Top Congressional Leaders to Discuss Ukraine Aid, US Border
Deal</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President Joe Biden convened top congressional
leaders at the White House to underscore Ukraine’s security needs, a
meeting that comes at a pivotal time as senators narrow on a landmark
immigration deal that could unlock $110 billion in stalled aid to
Ukraine, Israel and other U.S. allies.</p>
<p>But Speaker Mike Johnson and other Republicans used the face-to-face
moment with Biden to push him for tougher border security measures, with
the speaker telling the president that Republican lawmakers were
demanding “substantive policy change” and insisting that the White
House’s executive actions on immigration had weakened the border.</p>
<p>“We understand that there’s concern about the safety, security and
sovereignty of Ukraine,” Johnson told reporters after the meeting, which
ran for more than an hour. “But the American people have those same
concerns about our own domestic sovereignty and our safety and our
security.”</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, also speaking to reporters
after the meeting, stressed that Biden has repeatedly said he is willing
to compromise on certain border measures and that any effort in a
divided Congress must be bipartisan. House Republicans have insisted on
passage of a hard-line border security measure that has no Democratic
support on Capitol Hill.</p>
<p>“There was a large amount of agreement around the table that we must
do Ukraine, and we must do border,” he said.</p>
<p>The White House called the meeting with lawmakers — including
Johnson, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Senate Majority Leader
Chuck Schumer, and Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell — to brief
them on Ukraine’s current need for weapons and other aid, which the
White House described as “desperate” and “urgent.”</p>
<p>By populating the meeting with national security leaders, the meeting
was expected to impress on the new speaker the importance of the aid
package and the current U.S. approach to world affairs. The Republicans
in the room, even Johnson, are largely supportive of aiding Ukraine but
have stressed to the White House that it will need significant
border-security measures in return to persuade the large swath of
rank-and-file Republican lawmakers skeptical about sending more funds
abroad.</p>
<p>“He’s willing to hear what these congressional members want to talk
about, but the purpose of this meeting is to talk about Ukraine,” White
House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said ahead of the mid-afternoon
gathering, which was held in the Cabinet Room.</p>
<p>Key time to convene</p>
<p>Biden is convening the lawmakers at the start of an election year
when border security and the wars abroad are punctuating the race for
the White House as he faces a potential rematch against Republican
Donald Trump with control of the presidency and Congress all at
stake.</p>
<p>It comes as Congress is about to quickly approve temporary funding to
avoid a government shutdown — postponing the annual spending battles —
but as the supplemental aid package sits undone during the immigration
and border talks.</p>
<p>Biden, a longtime leader in U.S. foreign policy, finds himself
confronting a new generation of Republican lawmakers who have little
interest in engaging abroad or supporting vast American military aid or
actions around the world.</p>
<p>Led by Trump, the former president who is the Republicans’
front-runner for the nomination, a growing number of the Republicans in
Congress are particularly hostile to helping Ukraine fight Russian
President Vladimir Putin’s invasion.</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who along with National
Security Adviser Jake Sullivan met this week with Ukrainian President
Zelenskyy in Davos, Switzerland, said Washington is determined to keep
supporting Ukraine, and “we’re working very closely with Congress in
order to do that.”</p>
<p>Ahead of the meeting, McConnell announced the package could be ready
for a vote as soon as next week, and Schumer sounded a similarly
optimistic note — though negotiations continue.</p>
<p>Senators develop border proposal</p>
<p>Johnson, since taking the gavel in October, signaled he personally
believes in supporting Ukraine as it works to expel Russia. He met
privately with Zelenskyy during the Ukrainian president’s whirlwind tour
of Washington last month seeking aid before the year-end holidays.</p>
<p>But the speaker leads an ambivalent House Republican majority that
wants to extract its own priorities on the U.S.-Mexico border in
exchange for any overseas support.</p>
<p>The speaker has insisted any border security deal must align with the
House-passed strict border security bill. He told lawmakers in a private
meeting over the weekend that they could probably get their priorities
enacted with a Republican president, though the speaker did not mean
that to preclude not taking action now, said a Republican leadership
aide familiar with the call.</p>
<p>But senators, even fellow Republicans, said the House approach is a
nonstarter that would never find the bipartisan backing in both chambers
needed for approval.</p>
<p>Instead, a core group of senators led by Republican James Lankford
has been meeting privately for weeks with Biden’s top advisers —
including Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas — to develop a
border security package that could actually be signed into law.</p>
<p>Lankford told reporters late Tuesday that he hopes to prepare bill
text as negotiations try to wrap up soon.</p>
<p>McConnell told Republican senators privately last week they should
take the deal Lankford is producing, according to a person granted
anonymity to discuss the closed meeting.</p>
<p>“This is a unique moment in time,” said the Number 2 Republican John
Thune.</p>
<p>“It’s an opportunity to get some really conservative border policy
that we haven’t been able to get for 40 years,” he said. “And so we’ll
see. I mean, it may or may not happen, but I think you got to take a run
at it.”</p>
<p>Senator ‘hopeful’</p>
<p>The broader security package includes about $60 billion for Ukraine,
which is mainly used to purchase U.S. weaponry to fight the war and to
shore up its own government operations, along with some $14.5 billion
for Israel, about $14 billion for border security, and additional funds
for other security needs.</p>
<p>Biden opened the door to a broader U.S.-Mexico border security
package late last year and the changes being discussed could be
difficult for some Democrats who oppose strict restrictions on
immigration.</p>
<p>Schumer said negotiations over the border security package have made
progress in recent weeks and he was “hopeful that things are headed in
the right direction.”</p>
<p>Schumer said he expects the meeting with Biden will reinforce that
the national security package is urgent and “any agreement on an issue
as complex and contentious as the border is going to have to have
support from both sides of the aisle.”</p>

<h2 id="do-users-write-more-insecure-code-with-ai-assistants">Do users
write more insecure code with AI assistants?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-18, from: OS News</p>
<p>AI code assistants have emerged as powerful tools that can aid in the
software development life-cycle and can improve developer productivity.
Unfortunately, such assistants have also been found to produce insecure
code in lab environments, raising significant concerns about their usage
in practice. In this paper, we conduct a user study to examine how users
interact with AI code assistants to solve a variety of security related
tasks. Overall, we find that participants who had access to an AI
assistant wrote significantly less secure code than those without access
to an assistant. Participants with access to an AI assistant were also
more likely to believe they wrote secure code, suggesting that such
tools may lead users to be overconfident about security flaws in their
code. To better inform the design of future AI-based code assistants, we
