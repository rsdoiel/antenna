## How weight loss drugs are transforming the weight loss industry

date: 2024-05-09, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>A new class of weight loss drugs known as GLP-1s, like Wegovy and Zepbound, helped grow the weight loss industry to nearly $90 billion last year. Now, weight loss companies, apps and fitness companies are adapting their to programs include the drugs, as well. Also, allegations of serious fraud threaten a big U.S.-U.K. soccer deal, and China&#8217;s latest trade data showed a return to growth in April.</p>

## COSMIC improves its application store, display mirroring, and more

date: 2024-05-09, from: OS News

As its first alpha release is closing in, we have another monthly update about COSMIC, System76&#8217;s new Linux desktop environment written in Rust. This month, they&#8217;ve further polished and shored up their application store, imaginatively named COSMIC App Store, and it&#8217;s supposedly incredibly fast &#8211; something I can&#8217;t say for its GNOME and KDE counterparts, which tend to be so slow I&#8217;ve always just defaulted to updating through the command line, mostly. The file manager now has support for GVfs (GNOME Virtual file system) for making external storage like USB drives work properly, and Greeter login screen, Edit text editor, drag and drop, and copy/paste have been improved in various ways as well. Theming has seen a lot of work this month, with support for icon themes added to the App Library, fixed applet sizes, and more tweaks, while light themes have been disabled for now to fix a number of issues with colour selection being too dark. There&#8217;s also display mirroring now, which even works when the individual displays have different resolutions, orientations, and refresh rates. Pop!_OS is now also being built for ARM64, which makes sense because System76 is now also selling ARM servers. There&#8217;s also a bunch of work being done by the community as the alpha release nears.

## Opening windows in Linux with sockets, bare hands and 200 lines of C

date: 2024-05-09, from: OS News

X Server is slowly being deprecated in the Linux world and being replaced Wayland. Still X11 is an interesting protocol to look at from the perspective of binary communication and management of resource which require fast speeds. In this post I tried to cover basic information and create a simple but working app that is simple, defined in single file and easily compiles. No external code except libc was used. I find it fascinating when you can open black boxes and see how gears move each other. ↫ Hereket As much as the time of X has come and is now finally in the process of going, it&#8217;s still an incredibly powerful set of tools that even in a bare state can do way, way more than you think. X has come with its own window manager &#8211; twm &#8211; for decades, and it includes several basic applications like xedit, xclock, xterm, xeyes. Twm is actually pretty cool, and includes some features, like iconify to desktop, that I wish still existed in modern desktop environments. It&#8217;s quite bare-bones, though, and I doubt there&#8217;s anyone out there unironically using it today. As the linked article notes, even without advanced, complex libraries, toolkits, desktop environments, and so on, it&#8217;s entirely possible to create fully functional windows and applications with X. Of course, this makes perfect sense and shouldn&#8217;t be surprising &#8211; it&#8217;s the X Window System, after all &#8211; but you so rarely hear or read about it that you&#8217;d almost forget and just assume something like GNOME or KDE is an absolute requirement to use X.

## ChromeOS App Mall unifies app discovery for Chromebooks

date: 2024-05-09, from: OS News

We’ve been on the lookout for the arrival of the ChromeOS App Mall for a few months now. First discovered back in March, the new App Mall is arriving to do one, simple task: put the apps users want in one place to be found a Chromebook. While we have access to web apps, PWAs, Android apps and Linux apps on Chromebooks, it’s not always clear how to go about finding them. Should you install the web version or the Play Store version? Which Play Store apps install a PWA versus an Android app? Where should you go to find the right one for you? ↫ Robby Payne at Chrome Unboxed ChromeOS definitely needs a more unified, single place to find applications, and this seems like exactly what&#8217;s happening here.

## TikTok to start labeling AI-generated content as technology becomes more universal

date: 2024-05-09, from: VOA News USA

New York — TikTok will begin labeling content created using artificial intelligence when it's uploaded from certain platforms.


TikTok says its efforts are an attempt to combat misinformation from being spread on its social media platform.


The announcement came on ABCs "Good Morning America" on Thursday.


"Our users and our creators are so excited about AI and what it can do for their creativity and their ability to connect with audiences." Adam Presser, TikTok's Head of Operations & Trust and Safety told ABC News. "And at the same time, we want to make sure that people have that ability to understand what fact is and what is fiction."


TikTok's policy in the past has been to encourage users to label content that has been generated or significantly edited by AI. It also requires users to label all AI-generated content where it contains realistic images, audio, and video.

The public will have 45 days to have their say on the proposals, and then the DOE will narrow the list further. “In order to reach our clean energy and climate goals, we’ve got to build out transmission as fast as possible to get clean power from where it's produced to where it’s needed,” said John Podesta, senior advisor to the president for international climate policy. “The Biden-Harris administration is committed to using every tool at our disposal to accelerate progress on transmission permitting and financing and build a clean energy future.”</p><h3>2. Climeworks opens new direct air capture plant</h3><p>In case you missed it: Climeworks opened its newest commercial direct air capture plant yesterday. The Iceland-based facility, named Mammoth, is not yet operating at full capacity, with only 12 of its planned 72 capturing and filtering units installed. When the plant is fully operational — which Climeworks says should be sometime next year — it will pull up to 36,000 metric tons of CO2 out of the atmosphere annually. For scale, that’s about 1/28,000th of a gigaton. To get to net zero emissions, we’ll have to remove multiple gigatons of carbon from the atmosphere every year. “So in the context of where we need to go, Mammoth is almost nothing,” <a href="https://d2qwfv04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/X+113/d2QWfV04/VVqqjg5_VSDBW1DQSl76jL9K4W6fpr4J5dT-6lN9h9bJ03qn9gW7Y8-PT6lZ3myW48wMLm5vmGF5W2pdK5Y2v9d-SVKhZrX4dprfMW3Wws1459D3LyW1nNwL17RxTQ3N4GHcjbXqN_NW8ml-547ycmyCVCxxK32TDpWvW26S3kX2W0S1TN791rjWCft8sW6Wl3vr3LQxqGW4Gp2Vf43D1MfW6VM_dm8z5KVGW8ZVktV1nR8S5W5240jQ5yXY6NW2CbgVQ3D-BL7N45st5Sd0KhHW5mmqG85x8W1VW6tNHQR3w02r5N1bprCyw8y8dW5tFTsN8-GQchW2TdH4-5lfzqSN2hs499P3B1rW6xRDlc5PNrbxW3bSh_n4nTWq3W472ZZG84PRPMd9VmvC04" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote Heatmap’s new climate tech reporter Katie Brigham</a>. “But in the context of our current reality, it’s nine times the size of the next largest DAC facility: another Iceland-based Climeworks plant called Orca. And it’s a major stepping stone towards the company’s ultimate goal of capturing a million metric tons of CO2 yearly by 2030 and a billion by 2050.”</p><h3>3.

## PostgreSQL 16.3, 15.7, 14.12, 13.15, and 12.19 Released!

date: 2024-05-09, from: PostgreSQL News

<p>The PostgreSQL Global Development Group has released an update to all supported
versions of PostgreSQL, including 16.3, 15.7, 14.12, 13.15, and 12.19.
This release fixes one security vulnerability and over 55 bugs reported
over the last several months.</p>
<p>A security vulnerability was found in the system views
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/view-pg-stats-ext.html"><code>pg_stats_ext</code></a>
and <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/view-pg-stats-ext-exprs.html"><code>pg_stats_ext_exprs</code></a>,
potentially allowing authenticated database users to see data they don't have
sufficient privileges to view. The fix for this vulnerability only fixes
fresh PostgreSQL installations, namely those that are created with the
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-initdb.html"><code>initdb</code></a> utility
after this fix is applied. If you have a current PostgreSQL installation and are
concerned about this issue, please follow the instructions in the "Updating"
section for remediation steps.</p>
<p>For the full list of changes, please review the
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/">release notes</a>.</p>
<h2>PostgreSQL 12 EOL Notice</h2>
<p>PostgreSQL 12 will stop receiving fixes on November 14, 2024. If you are
running PostgreSQL 12 in a production environment, we suggest that you make
plans to upgrade to a newer, supported version of PostgreSQL. Please see our
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/">versioning policy</a> for more

<h2>Updating</h2>
<p>All PostgreSQL update releases are cumulative. As with other minor releases,
users are not required to dump and reload their database or use <code>pg_upgrade</code> in
order to apply this update release; you may simply shutdown PostgreSQL and
update its binaries.</p>
<p>For existing installations that are impacted by CVE-2024-4317 that wish to
remediate the issue, you will have to perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Find the SQL script <code>fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql</code> in the <code>share</code> directory of
your PostgreSQL installation (e.g. in <code>/usr/share/postgresql/</code>), or download it
from the PostgreSQL git repository from one of the URLs below. You will need to
use the script that matches your major version:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=blob;f=src/backend/catalog/fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql;hb=refs/heads/REL_16_STABLE">PostgreSQL 16</a>: <a href="https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=blob;f=src/backend/catalog/fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql;hb=refs/heads/REL_16_STABLE">https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=blob;f=src/backend/catalog/fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql;hb=refs/heads/REL_16_STABLE</a></p>

</ol>
<p>From the above URLs, you can click the URL that says "raw" to download a version
that you can copy and paste.</p>
<p>Be sure to use the script appropriate to your PostgreSQL major version. If you
do not see this file, either your version is not vulnerable (only PostgreSQL 14,
15, and 16 are affected) or your minor version is too old to have the fix.</p>
<ol>
<li>In each database of the cluster, run the <code>fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql</code> script as
a database superuser. For example, in <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html"><code>psql</code></a>,
with the file located in <code>/usr/share/postgresql/</code>, this command would look like:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>\i /usr/share/postgresql/fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql</code></p>
<ol>
<li>You must also execute this script in the <code>template0</code> and <code>template1</code>
databases, or the vulnerability will still exist in databases you create later.
To fix <code>template0</code>, you'll need to temporarily allow it accept connections. You
can do this with the following command:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>ALTER DATABASE template0 WITH ALLOW_CONNECTIONS true;</code></p>
<p>After executing the <code>fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql</code> script in <code>template0</code> and
<code>template1</code>, you should revoke the ability for <code>template0</code> to accept
connections. You can do this with the following command:</p>
<p><code>ALTER DATABASE template0 WITH ALLOW_CONNECTIONS false;</code></p>
<p>Users who have skipped one or more update releases may need to run additional
post-update steps; please see the release notes from earlier versions for
details.</p>

## Did GitHub Copilot really increase my productivity?

date: 2024-05-08, from: OS News

Yuxuan Shui, the developer behind the X11 compositor picom (a fork of Compton) published a blog post detailing their experiences with using GitHub Copilot for a year. I had free access to GitHub Copilot for about a year, I used it, got used to it, and slowly started to take it for granted, until one day it was taken away. I had to re-adapt to a life without Copilot, but it also gave me a chance to look back at how I used Copilot, and reflect &#8211; had Copilot actually been helpful to me? Copilot definitely feels a little bit magical when it works. It&#8217;s like it plucked code straight from my brain and put it on the screen for me to accept. Without it, I find myself getting grumpy a lot more often when I need to write boilerplate code &#8211; &#8220;Ugh, Copilot would have done it for me!&#8221;, and now I have to type it all out myself. That being said, the answer to my question above is a very definite &#8220;no, I am more productive without it&#8221;. Let me explain. ↫ Yuxuan Shui The two main reasons why Shui eventually realised Copilot was slowing them down were its unpredictability, and its slowness. It&#8217;s very difficult to understand when, exactly, Copilot will get things right, which is not a great thing to have to deal with when you&#8217;re writing code. They also found Copilot incredibly slow, with its suggestions often taking 2-3 seconds or longer to appear &#8211; much slower than the suggestions from the clangd language server they use. Of course, everybody&#8217;s situation will be different, and I have a suspicion that if you&#8217;re writing code in incredibly popular languages, say, Python or JavaScript, you&#8217;re going to get more accurate and possibly faster suggestions from Copilot. As Shui notes, it probably also doesn&#8217;t help that they&#8217;re writing an independent X11 compositor, something very few people are doing, meaning Copilot hasn&#8217;t been trained on it, which in turn means the tool probably has no clue what&#8217;s going on when Shui is writing their code. As an aside, my opinion on GitHub Copilot is clear &#8211; it&#8217;s quite possibly the largest case of copyright infringement in human history, and in its current incarnation it should not be allowed to continue to operate. As I wrote over a year ago: If Microsoft or whoever else wants to train a coding “AI” or whatever, they should either be using code they own the copyright to, get explicit permission from the rightsholders for “AI” training use (difficult for code from larger projects), or properly comply with the terms of the licenses and automatically add the terms and copyright notices during autocomplete and/or properly apply copyleft to the newly generated code. Anything else is a massive copyright violation and a direct assault on open source. Let me put it this way – the code to various versions of Windows has leaked numerous times. What if we train an “AI” on that leaked code and let everyone use it? Do you honestly think Microsoft would not sue you into the stone age? ↫ Thom Holwerda It&#8217;s curious that as far as I know, Copilot has not been trained on Microsoft&#8217;s own closed-source code, say, to Windows or Office, while at the same time the company claims Copilot is not copyright infringement or a massive open source license violation machine. If what Copilot does is truly fair use, as Microsoft claims, why won&#8217;t Microsoft use its own closed-source code for training? We all know the answer. Deeply questionable legality aside, do any of you use Copilot? Has it had any material impact on your programming work? Is its use allowed by your employer, or do you only use it for personal projects at home?

## US House rejects effort to remove Speaker Johnson from office

date: 2024-05-08, from: VOA News USA

washington — Hard-line Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene stunned colleagues Wednesday by calling for a vote to oust Speaker Mike Johnson. Lawmakers quickly rejected it. 


Greene pressed ahead with her long-shot effort despite pushback from Republicans at the highest levels tired of the political chaos. 


One of Donald Trump's biggest supporters in Congress, Greene stood on the House floor and read a long list of what she called transgressions that Johnson had committed as speaker. Colleagues booed in protest. 


It was the second time in a matter of months that Republicans have tried to oust their own speaker, an unheard-of level of party turmoil with a move rarely seen in U.S. history. 


Greene of Georgia criticized Johnson's leadership as "pathetic, weak and unacceptable." 


Republican lawmakers filtered toward Johnson, giving him pats on the back and grasping his shoulder to assure him of their support. 


House Majority Leader Steve Scalise quickly moved to table the effort — essentially stopping it from going forward. The motion to table was swiftly approved. 


The Georgia Republican had vowed she would force a vote on the motion to vacate the Republican speaker if he dared to advance a foreign aid package with funds for Ukraine, which was overwhelmingly approved late last month and signed into law. 


Johnson of Louisiana said he had been willing to take the risk, believing it was important for the U.S. to back Ukraine against Russia's invasion and explaining he wanted to be on the "right side of history." 


"I just have to do my job every day," Johnson said Monday. 


In a highly unusual move, the speaker received a boost from Democrats led by Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, whose leadership team had said it was time to "turn the page" on the Republican turmoil and vote to table Greene's resolution — almost ensuring Johnson's job is saved, for now. 


Trump also weighed in after Johnson trekked to Mar-a-Lago for a visit, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee giving the speaker his nod of approval. And Trump's hand-picked leader at the Republican National Committee urged House Republicans off the move.

"If we want their help somehow, we need to be able to help them," Representative Adam Smith, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, said in a one-on-one interview.




The 27-year House lawmaker was part of the most recent congressional delegation to visit Uzbekistan, along with Armed Services Committee Chair Mike Rogers, Salud Carbajal and Veronica Escobar.


The message they carried to the region was clear: Washington wants to enhance security cooperation while backing political and economic reforms.


The Uzbek leadership, in turn, conveyed enthusiasm for broadening the strategic partnership, which dates to the early 2000s.




During the March 26-27 visit to Tashkent, the delegation met with Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev, Foreign Minister Bakhtiyor Saidov and Minister of Defense Major General Bakhodir Kurbanov. According to Smith, these discussions underscored Uzbekistan's pivotal role in "keeping an eye on what's going on in Afghanistan."


He sees the Islamic State extremist group, or ISIS, and radicalization in general, as the most prominent terrorism threats.


“Uzbekistan is close and could potentially be a partner in tracking ISIS or other extremist elements,” he said. “So, having a partner in the region that we can work with to identify potential threats and counter radicalization, to make sure that the ideologies don't take hold or produce terrorists, like the ones that struck in Moscow.”


Several Central Asian citizens were arrested in connection with an attack on a Moscow concert hall in March that killed 144 people. Responsibility was claimed by Islamic State-Khorasan, also known as ISIS-K or IS-K, a regional offshoot of Islamic State.




Despite the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, Smith said the United States still has interests in that country and that Tashkent, which maintains a tight relationship with the Taliban, can help in that regard.


"Al-Qaida is still in the region. ISIS, obviously. The Taliban are fighting ISIS-K," the congressman said. "We are still very interested in the region. The difference is we're not there. We don't have a good ability to monitor it and act. So, we are looking for partners."


In Smith’s view, the U.S. must be more strategic in competing with Russia and China as they try to advance their own influence in the region.




Unlike Moscow and Beijing, Washington does not build infrastructure. Instead, it offers technical assistance and works through international financial institutions — endeavors that Smith describes as substantial.


One way the United States could help Uzbekistan, he said, is by helping to find a way to advance the landlocked country’s goal of establishing a rail link through Afghanistan and Pakistan to the Indian Ocean.


Security relationships with countries in the region “have not significantly increased” since the U.S. left Afghanistan, Smith acknowledged, but “we're trying to build some of those relationships with Uzbekistan."


In 2021, Congress appropriated $10 million under the Foreign Military Financing program to enhance Central Asia's border security and counterterrorism capabilities, supplying vehicles, communications equipment and training.


Brushing off Russian speculation that the U.S. is seeking to open a military base in Central Asia, Smith said there are no such efforts.


“We're seeking partners. We're not seeking a presence," he said while emphasizing the importance of overflight agreements and intelligence collaboration.




Smith and other lawmakers, including those in the congressional Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan caucuses, concede that Central Asia has some of the world’s most authoritarian regimes, which suppress dissent and independent media. State Department reports describe the countries as prominent human rights violators.


In Turkmenistan, Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov ruled for 15 years before passing the presidency to his son, Serdar Berdimuhamedov, in 2022.


In Tajikistan, President Emomali Rahmon has been in power since 1992 and is expected to follow Berdimuhamedov’s path.


In Uzbekistan, a government-engineered constitutional referendum in 2023 allowed Mirziyoyev, president since 2016, to continue for two seven-year terms.


Nursultan Nazarbayev governed Kazakhstan for 30 years before stepping down in 2019. His hand-picked successor, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, also changed the constitution but promised to leave at the end of his term in 2029.


For years, Kyrgyzstan stood out as having the most democratic potential in the region. However, its current president, Sadyr Japarov, has jailed critics and recently adopted a Russian-style “foreign agents” law.




Smith says the U.S. does not ignore reality, yet he favors pragmatism over preaching.


"If you simply say, ‘We don't think your elections were as free and fair. We're out, we're not working with you,’ those countries can very, very easily turn to China, Russia, Iran and who knows, maybe someday, North Korea. So, we have to understand what's doable and realistic."


Having met the Uzbek president in Tashkent, Smith calls Mirziyoyev "a smart guy" who is moving Uzbekistan "in the right direction."


"I think they are genuinely trying to improve their economy, deal with terrorism but they've got a long way to go," he said.


As on many issues, Democrats and Republicans differ on Central Asia. But Smith stresses that "most members of Congress don't pay attention to that part of the world. There is not a well thought-out approach."


"If you were to poll 435 [representatives] over their two-year term, how many times have they thought about Uzbekistan? Very few. I'd say probably 400 of them never thought about it," Smith said. "So, we are working on that."

<small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Billy J. Roberts, NREL, for DOE</small></p><p>Homer Electric Association was the first utility to face the consequences, with a contract that <a href="https://alaskapublic.org/2023/07/03/with-shortfall-looming-report-outlines-ways-to-fill-alaskas-gas-gaps/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>expired this year</u></a>. As a stopgap, it signed a one-year contract with Enstar, the local private gas utility that gets 90% of its supply from Hilcorp (and also supplies gas for heating homes and businesses) at a higher price. The rest of the Railbelt co-ops’ contracts are set to expire by 2028.</p><p>Proposed solutions to the crisis range from new drilling in Cook Inlet — which is risky, expensive, and laden with permitting hurdles, <a href="https://alaskapublic.org/2023/11/30/theres-lots-of-gas-in-cook-inlet-heres-why-some-companies-arent-drilling/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>making it unappealing to investors</u></a> — to building an <a href="https://www.adn.com/alaska-journal/news/2023/07/31/as-cook-inlet-gas-shortage-looms-railbelt-utilities-assess-options/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>800-mile, $43 billion pipeline</u></a> from the oil-rich North Slope. <a href="https://www.northernjournal.com/p/political-pressure-builds-as-state" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>More realistically</u></a>, the Railbelt seems headed toward <a href="https://www.northernjournal.com/p/could-oil-rich-alaska-be-forced-to" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>importing liquified natural gas from British Columbia</u></a>, at least in the short term.</p><p>That option is “really unpalatable to many Alaskans,” Satchel Pondolfino, the lower Kenai Peninsula organizer for Cook Inletkeeper, a Homer-based environmental non-profit, told me. “We’re an energy state: It’s inconceivable for a lot of people that we have to bring in fuel from other places.” </p><p>It’s also expensive. Importing LNG could result in 50% higher costs for the utilities. That, in turn, would mean up to a 15% hike in consumers’ <a href="https://www.adn.com/opinions/2021/08/28/alaska-is-high-in-natural-power-its-time-to-lead-the-nation/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>already-steep utility bills</u></a>, and likely “even more than that for heating bills,” as <a href="https://www.northernjournal.com/p/analysis-lng-imports-are-likely-coming" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Herz has reported</u></a> — no small thing in a place where it is dark and cold for half the year. One independent analysis Herz cites found that the 80% renewable portfolio standard proposed by the state’s Republican Governor Mike Dunleavy <a href="https://www.northernjournal.com/p/as-natural-gas-shortage-looms-alaska" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">would save $6.7 billion in fuel costs</a> over the next 35 years compared to an estimated $3.2 billion investment in the projects. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/evaluating-80-rps-alaskas-railbelt-cost-analysis" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">latest assessment</a> likewise found that a large clean-energy build-out would be “more affordable than relying on imported natural gas.”</p><p>Critically, then, the spring elections in Alaska will help decide both what the long-term solution will be and how quickly it should be implemented. The Anchorage mayoral runoff set for this coming Tuesday — a choice between incumbent Dave Bronson, a <a href="https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/anchorage/2021/03/27/anchorage-mayoral-candidate-dave-bronson-wants-to-take-the-city-in-a-new-direction/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>self-described</u></a> “center-right kind of guy” who <a href="https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/anchorage/2024/02/08/anchorage-mayoral-candidates-differ-on-how-to-handle-looming-cook-inlet-energy-shortage/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>favors new Cook Inlet drilling</u></a>, and Suzanne LaFrance, a Lead Locally-endorsed climate candidate pushing for a renewable mix — is perhaps the marquee race, albeit one with a more limited say over the future energy mix. </p><p>“Utilities have control over specifically where they get their energy from, and the legislature has a lot of control over how we tax different energy producers,” Jenny-Marie Stryker, the political director at The Alaska Center, the state’s largest conservation advocacy organization, told me. But while there is not “one turnkey thing that we’re looking for the mayor to do,” Stryker added, it’s instead the “many, many steps” LaFrance has promised to follow in the city’s <a href="https://www.muni.org/Departments/Mayor/AWARE/ResilientAnchorage/pages/climateactionplan.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>climate action plan</u></a> that would mark an improvement over Bronson. (LaFrance’s campaign did not respond to Heatmap’s request for comment.)</p><p>Bronson, who was elected during the pandemic when Alaskans were bristling against perceived government overreach, <a href="https://alaskapublic.org/2024/03/22/anchorage-mayoral-candidates-describe-city-in-decline-during-alaska-public-media-debate/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ignored</u></a> his predecessor’s climate action plan and established the Southcentral Mayors’ Energy Coalition to address the Railbelt energy crisis — a move Stryker told me was a “pretty big waste of time,” since it’s something the 11-mayor group has “no control over.” Bronson defended his decision to me in an emailed statement, arguing that any climate action plan is by necessity secondary to addressing Southcentral Alaska’s immediate energy concerns. </p><p>“It is easy to say, ‘Let’s build a massive solar plant, let’s invest in tidal energy, let’s investigate geothermal,’” he wrote. “However, there are grid transmission upgrades that need to be made” before that can be a reality. Additionally, while the assumption is that building out new renewables is “easy,” the “permitting process alone can take 2-3 years, and in some cases, 5-6 years,” he stressed. (New LNG import terminals, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/alaska-legislature/2024/02/08/alaska-legislators-warned-of-energy-supply-gap-as-large-scale-imported-gas-likely-not-available-until-2030/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>might not be online until 2030</u></a>.)</p><p>Herz, the reporter, told me earlier that renewable project developers “would be looking at capital expenditures that were 80% to 90% higher than they would be to develop utility-scale renewable projects in the Lower 48.” In an oil state, there is also an “inherent skepticism about some of the renewable technology and economic viability that you might not find elsewhere in the United States because there aren’t really big utility-scale projects that have been built here.” The ones that are on the board — including <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/news/program/2024/tidal-energy-is-coming-to-alaska-but-how-much.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a possible and intriguing tidal energy project</u></a> — fall more firmly into the purview of the local co-ops.</p><p>The utility board elections, then, have a more immediate hand in shaping the Railbelt’s future energy mix. Two of those elections have already taken place: for the board of the Matanushka Electric Association, where <a href="https://www.mea.coop/co-op-benefits/election-and-annual-meeting" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>both climate candidates lost</u></a> (albeit one by just 41 of 3,246 votes), and for the Homer Electric Association, where a climate candidate was re-elected and a challenger lost, <a href="https://www.peninsulaclarion.com/news/hea-voters-elect-status-quo-board/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>maintaining the board’s ideological status quo</u></a>. Chugach Electric Association, which represents Anchorage and is the largest provider in the state, will go next, with voting ongoing and ending May 17. That board is currently held by a pro-renewable majority that has <a href="https://www.akbizmag.com/industry/energy/op-ed-chugach-electric-associations-progress-on-clean-energy-goals/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>advanced</u></a> utility-scale wind and solar projects, with pro-gas challengers <a href="https://www.adn.com/business-economy/energy/2024/04/17/chugach-electric-association-board-candidates-differ-on-approaches-to-renewable-energy-natural-gas-crisis/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>vying to take back control</u></a>. </p><p>Finally, Fairbanks’ Golden Valley Electric Association ballots are due June 4, with Gary Newman, a pro-renewable Democrat, attempting to hold off Harmony Tomaszewski, who helped <a href="https://www.fbxclimateaction.org/blog/march-energy-updates" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>block</u></a> a local climate action plan last year. Fairbanks has been hit especially hard by the energy crisis, burning coal and diesel to compensate for LNG shortfalls and <a href="https://earthjustice.org/press/2022/severe-human-health-risks-ongoing-in-fairbanks-as-epa-fails-to-address-some-of-the-nations-worst-air-pollution" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>polluting its air</u></a>. A rate hike of about <a href="https://www.webcenterfairbanks.com/2024/02/29/gvea-announces-price-raise/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$29 more per month</u></a> for households has also brought unusually high levels of public interest to the co-op election.</p><p>While “on paper” the current GVEA board is “pretty conservative,” Eleanor Gagnon, the energy justice organizer with the Fairbanks Climate Action Coalition, told me, its annual meeting in April featured a lot of talk about diversifying its energy portfolio — a conversation that would have been shocking even a few years ago. “They really seem to have come to the realization that more renewables are necessary because of these rate hikes, and because the rate hikes are due to the instability of natural gas sources,” she said.</p><p>I’ve <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/climate-change-voting-elections" target="_self"><u>spoken with organizers before</u></a> about how policies with positive climate benefits are often economic issues at heart — ones that sometimes override environmental motivations — and that seems especially true in Alaska. “The urgency of Cook Inlet gas not meeting our demands by 2027 — folks are throwing climate out the window,” Pondolfino, the Cook Inletkeeper organizer, said. “They’re like, ‘We just need energy security and we need to be able to afford it.’” </p><p>The math shows that having a diversified renewable mix <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/evaluating-80-rps-alaskas-railbelt-cost-analysis" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>would be </em></em></u><u>better economically</u></a> than importing expensive LNG. That doesn’t mean it will be an easy transition, or a quick one, but it gives activists and advocates a clear goal to keep working toward on every ballot.</p><p>“Most people in the Lower 48 do not have any way to voice their opinion about the direction their utility should move in, or to vote for representatives,” Pondolfino said. “It is a privilege to vote in elections that have a really direct impact on people’s lives and their ability to afford to live here.”</p>

## Raspberry Pi Connect: remote desktop for your Pi

date: 2024-05-08, from: OS News

Today we’re pleased to announce the beta release of Raspberry Pi Connect: a secure and easy-to-use way to access your Raspberry Pi remotely, from anywhere on the planet, using just a web browser. It’s often extremely useful to be able to access your Raspberry Pi’s desktop remotely. There are a number of technologies which can be used to do this, including VNC, and of course the X protocol itself. But they can be hard to configure, particularly when you are attempting to access a machine on a different local network; and of course with the transition to Wayland in Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm, classic X remote desktop support is no longer available. We wanted to be able to provide you with this functionality with our usual “it just works” approach. Enter Raspberry Pi Connect. ↫ Gordon Hollingworth Pi Connect uses WebRTC, and a daemon running on your Pi listens for incoming screensharing requests from the Raspberry Pi website to connect the VNC server on your Pi to the VNC client running in your browser. The service is in beta, it&#8217;s free, but the one major downside is that for now, there&#8217;s only one TURN server for this service, located in the UK, but they might set up more of them if demand is high enough. If you want to try this service on your own Pi running Raspberry Pi OS, you&#8217;re going to need to be using a Raspberry Pi 5, 4, or 400, using the latest version of the operating system running Wayland. Update your operating system, install the rpi-connect package, reboot, and you&#8217;re good to go.

## US revokes Intel, Qualcomm’s export licenses to sell to China’s Huawei, sources say

date: 2024-05-08, from: OS News

The U.S. has revoked licenses that allowed companies including Intel and Qualcomm to ship chips used for laptops and handsets to sanctioned Chinese telecoms equipment maker Huawei Technologies, three people familiar with the matter said. ↫ Alexandra Alper, Fanny Potkin, David Shepardson The timing of this news is very interesting, as despite the massive sanctions the United States levied against Huawei, the company seems to be doing really well, with its smartphone business seeing massive gains in the Chinese market, at the expense of everyone else. This proves that Huawei does not need access to western chips and technologies to be successful, which must definitely sting in the US and Europe. Strong financial results, using hardware and chips designed not by western companies but by Chinese ones, combined with the only mobile operating system that has any serious potential to at least somewhat threaten Android and iOS. The various sanctions were clearly intended to hurt Huawei and possibly contain it to just China, but it seems they&#8217;re not having their desired effect at all.

## US college students face muted graduations amid Gaza war protests

date: 2024-05-08, from: VOA News USA

Commencement ceremonies are being scaled back or canceled at U.S. universities because of security concerns over pro-Palestinian student protests. While some campus demonstrations have resulted in concessions, others have led to violent confrontations. VOA’s Tina Trinh has the story from New York.

## Biden set to tighten asylum access at US-Mexico border, sources say

date: 2024-05-08, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The Biden administration is set to tighten access to asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border via a new regulation that could be issued as soon as Thursday, four sources familiar with the matter said. The move is aimed at reducing illegal crossings. 


The regulation would require migrants to be assessed at an initial asylum screening stage to see whether they should be barred from asylum and quickly deported, said the sources, who requested anonymity to discuss internal government planning. They added that the measure appeared limited in scope.  


The migrants would be assessed related to criminality and security threats, two of the sources said. 


The new regulation would improve efficiency by screening asylum-seekers earlier in the process to determine whether they should be barred, one of the sources, a U.S. official, told Reuters. It would be issued as a proposed regulation and finalized at a later date, the official said. 


U.S. President Joe Biden, a Democrat seeking another four-year term in the November 5 election, has struggled with at times high numbers of migrants caught crossing the U.S.-Mexico border since taking office in 2021. Former U.S. President Donald Trump, Biden's Republican challenger, has criticized Biden for rolling back more restrictive Trump-era policies. 


The Biden administration has considered a more sweeping move to block asylum-seekers and migrants at the border using a federal statute deployed by Trump in his travel bans, but is not immediately planning to take that step, the sources said. 


Biden implemented new asylum restrictions last year, but their effectiveness has been limited by a lack of resources to process arriving migrants. 


The regulation expected to be issued this week could mean potentially thousands of people would be more quickly deported from the U.S. per year, two of the sources said, a relatively small number compared with the total number caught crossing illegally.

## On guestbooks

                <p>Sometimes you have to listen to the messages life sends your way. And today that message is that I have to write something about guestbooks. In less than 2 hours, two emails landed in my inbox—I love emails, if you want to get in touch please <a href="mailto:hello@manuelmoreale.com">do send one</a>—both on the topic of guestbooks.</p>
<p>The first one was from <a href="https://bjhess.com">Barry</a>. His site now has a <a href="https://bjhess.com/guestbook">lovely guestbook</a> that I haven’t signed yet because I want to come up with a nice drawing for it. Barry also works on a blog platform called <a href="https://pika.page">Pika</a>, worth checking out if you want to start a blog—you should—and you’re considering a hosted solution.</p>
<p>The second email was a ping from <a href="https://devastatia.com/123guestbook-shutting-down">Devastatia’s website</a>. She wrote a post on the subject of guestbooks because apparently <a href="https://www.123guestbook.com">123guestbook.com</a>, one of the OG sites, <a href="https://www.123guestbook.com/news.php?id=closure">is shutting down</a>. If for some reason you were using it to power your guestbook you should consider exporting your content and preserving all the signatures in some way.</p>
<p>Guestbooks are cool. If you haven’t already, <a href="http://manuelmoreale.com/guestbook">go sign mine</a> and let me know if your site has one because I’m going to both sign it and also add it to the list on my guestbook page.</p>                <hr>

## US revokes some licenses for exports to China's Huawei

date: 2024-05-08, from: VOA News USA

Washington — The United States has revoked certain licenses for exports to Chinese tech giant Huawei, the Commerce Department said, drawing opposition from Beijing on Wednesday.


The move came after criticism last month by Republican lawmakers, who urged President Joe Biden's administration to block all export licenses to the company after it released a new laptop powered by a processor by U..S chip giant Intel.


"We continuously assess how our controls can best protect our national security and foreign policy interests, taking into consideration a constantly changing threat environment and technological landscape," said a Commerce Department spokesperson.


"We are not commenting on any specific licenses, but we can confirm that we have revoked certain licenses for exports to Huawei," the spokesperson added in a statement to AFP.


Huawei has long been caught in an intense technological rivalry between Beijing and Washington, which has warned that the firm's equipment could be used for Chinese espionage operations.


The company denies these claims.


Sanctions in 2019 restricting Huawei's access to U.S.-made components dealt a major blow to its production of smartphones -- and meant that suppliers need a license before shipping to the company.


Asked about reports that the U.S. government had revoked some companies' licenses, a Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson said Beijing "firmly opposes this."


"China will take all necessary measures to firmly safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese firms," the spokesperson added.


The announcement of a new Huawei computer recently, powered by Intel technology, drew fire from Republican lawmakers in the United States. 


A letter by policymakers Marco Rubio and Elise Stefanik charged that "licenses issued in 2020, at least some of which are active to this day, have allowed Huawei to collaborate with Intel and Qualcomm to keep its PC and smartphone segments alive."


It criticized the allowance of US tech into Huawei's new product.

## Climeworks’ Newest Direct Air Capture Plant Is Officially Live

date: 2024-05-08, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjE4NzI1NC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczMzEzNzU5Mn0.KURqCKn_VckgPJj2c7q6PGrDqAgAurntYDNkdVendLU/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p>If one company has set the pace for direct air capture, it’s <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/climeworks-orca-data-carbon-removal-direct-air-capture" target="_self">Climeworks</a>. The Switzerland-based business opened its — and the world’s — first commercial DAC plant in 2017, capable of capturing “several hundred tons” of carbon dioxide each year. Today, the company unveiled its newest plant, the aptly named Mammoth. Located in Iceland, Mammoth is designed to take advantage of the country’s unique geology to capture and store up to 36,000 metric tons of carbon per year — eventually. Here’s what you need to know about the new project.</p><h3>1. Mammoth is, well, huge</h3>
<p>Mammoth is not yet operating at full capacity, with only 12 of its planned 72 capturing and filtering units installed. When the plant is fully operational — which Climeworks says should be sometime next year — it will pull up to 36,000 metric tons of CO2 out of the atmosphere annually. For scale, that’s about 1/28,000th of a gigaton. To get to net zero emissions, we’ll have to remove <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/sustainability/our-insights/carbon-removals-how-to-scale-a-new-gigaton-industry" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>multiple</em></em></u><u> gigatons</u></a> of carbon from the atmosphere every year.</p>
<p>“The engineered solutions will have to play a major — and I would say even <em><em>the</em></em> major part of this task,” said Climeworks CEO Jan Wurzbacher at the virtual press conference for Mammoth’s unveiling. In his opinion, nature-based solutions “will not be able to scale to the level where we need them to be.”</p>
<p>So in the context of where we need to go, Mammoth is almost nothing. But in the context of our current reality, it’s nine times the size of the next largest DAC facility: another Iceland-based Climeworks plant called Orca. And it’s a major stepping stone towards the company’s ultimate goal of capturing a million metric tons of CO2 yearly by 2030 and a billion by 2050.</p><h3>2. Construction happened quickly</h3>
<p>Climeworks first broke ground on Mammoth in June 2022, and 18 months later the company announced that the “core pieces of the plant are built.” Now that the plant has started capturing CO2, Climeworks says the rest of 2024 will be devoted to installing the remaining CO2capture units and ramping toward full capacity. </p>
<p>Thus far in its history, Climeworks has largely avoided the construction delays that often plague first-of-its-kind projects. “They’re coming out with new projects every three to four years, which is a pretty wild timeline,” said Erin Burns, Executive Director of the nonprofit Carbon180. </p>
<h3>3. It runs on 100% zero-emission power</h3>
<p>Through Climework’s partnership with Icelandic geothermal company ON Power, Mammoth is powered in full by geothermal energy — although the company has long been reticent about how much energy, exactly, it needs. </p>
<p>At any rate, Climeworks has committed to powering the direct air capture process as well as its storage process with 100% renewables in the long run. The company cited Kenya, New Zealand, and Indonesia as other areas that would be geologically advantageous for future Climeworks facilities, as all have substantial geothermal resources.  </p>
<h3>4. The carbon is still quite expensive</h3>
<p>Climeworks said it would be able to disclose an exact cost per metric ton of carbon removal figure after Mammoth has been operational for a year or two. But in the meantime, Wurzbacher said the company is “closer to the $1,000 per ton mark than we are to the $100 per ton mark.” He expects prices to drop as the company further scales, and is aiming for $300 to $350 per metric ton by 2030, and ultimately $100 per metric ton by 2050. That’s in line with the Department of Energy’s Earthshots initiative, which aims to reduce the cost of a variety of carbon dioxide removal pathways to below $100 per metric ton by 2050. </p>
<h3>5. Climeworks has sold about a third of Mammoth’s lifetime capacity</h3>
<p>While Climeworks hasn’t divulged Mammoth’s lifetime carbon removal capacity, it said the plant is designed to operate for 25 years, and that a third of its lifetime capacity has already been sold. The remainder will be sold in the next year or two, representatives told reporters</p>
<p>The company has offtake agreements with more than 160 organizations including some major corporate buyers such as <a href="https://climeworks.com/press-release/jp-morgan-chase-signs-landmark-cdr-agreement-with-climeworks" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>JPMorgan Chase</u></a>, <a href="https://climeworks.com/press-release/bcg-and-climeworks-sign-15-year-partnership-agreement" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Boston Consulting Group</u></a> and <a href="https://climeworks.com/press-release/climeworks-extends-collaboration-with-microsoft" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Microsoft</u></a>. Many of these agreements span a decade or more and involve tens of thousands of tons of CO2 removal from current and future Climeworks projects. (The company also recently opened a marketplace, <a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/climeworks-solutions-carbon-removal" target="_self"><u>Climeworks Solutions</u></a>, to package and sell “high quality” carbon credits from other carbon removal companies.)</p>
<p>The Mammoth plant was primarily financed by Climework’s own equity, said Wurzbacher. “But going forward, project financing will be vital to accelerate the scale up. And for that, such long-term offtake agreements are important.”</p>
<p>Now that the plant is operational, it should help drive more investment, Dana Jacobs, chief of staff at the Carbon Removal Alliance, told me. “Having carbon removal projects that you can see and reach out and touch and understand is so critical,” she said. </p>

## Storms batter Midwest, including reported tornadoes that shredded FedEx facility

date: 2024-05-08, from: VOA News USA

DETROIT — Severe storms barreled through the Midwest early Wednesday, a day after two reported tornadoes struck one Michigan city and destroyed homes and commercial buildings, including a FedEx facility. 


Tornadoes were first reported after dark Tuesday in parts of Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, while portions of Illinois, Kentucky and Missouri were also under a tornado watch, according to the National Weather Service. The storms came a day after a deadly twister ripped through an Oklahoma town. 


As the storms raged on in the pre-dawn hours Wednesday, the National Weather Service in Pittsburgh warned that a tornado in northeastern Ohio could cross into Pennsylvania. Parts of West Virginia were also under a tornado warning. 


Hancock County Schools in West Virginia closed schools Wednesday because of “extensive overnight weather issues” in the county. News outlets reported damaged buildings and power outages. 


Hours earlier in southwestern Michigan, two reported tornadoes blitzed the city of Portage near Kalamazoo on Tuesday night, destroying homes and commercial buildings, including a FedEx facility that was ripped apart. 


No serious injuries were immediately reported, but city officials said in a news release that the twisters knocked out power to more than 20,000 people. Most of them would be without power until late Wednesday, city officials said. 


At one point, about 50 people were trapped inside the FedEx facility because of downed power lines. But company spokesperson Shannon Davis said late Tuesday that “all team members are safe and accounted for.” 


More than 30,000 customers were without power in Michigan early Wednesday, and an additional 10,000 in Ohio, according to PowerOutage.us. 


Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties. 


“My heart goes out to all those impacted by tonight’s severe weather in southwest Michigan,” Whitmer said in a message on social media. “State and local emergency teams are on the ground and working together to assist Michiganders.” 


National Weather Service crews were working Wednesday to survey storm damage in several counties in Michigan’s southwest Lower Peninsula to determine whether tornadoes touched down in those areas, including the two reported Tuesday night in the city of Portage, said meteorologist Mike Sutton with the weather service’s Grand Rapids office. 


He said the Grand Rapids office had received a total of 11 reports of tornadoes from storm spotters, emergency managers and the public from late Tuesday afternoon into Tuesday night, but as of 8 a.m. Wednesday, it had not confirmed any tornado touchdowns. 


Sutton said it could be a couple days before the storm surveys are completed and he stressed that some of the tornado reports could be duplicate reports passed along by people who saw the same storm. 


“It’s quite possible those are multiple reports from the same tornado. The actual number of tornadoes may be lower depending on what they find when they’re out surveying,” he said. 


Tuesday's storms came a day after parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring. 


Across the U.S., the entire week is looking stormy. The Midwest and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati — cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend. 




Oklahoma’s recent twisters


On Monday night, a deadly twister in Oklahoma tore through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall. At least one person was killed. and another was missing. Dozens of homes were destroyed. 


Aerial videos showed homes reduced to piles of rubble and others with roofs torn off. The twister tossed vehicles, downed power lines and stripped limbs and bark from trees across the town. A 160-acre (65-hectare) wax manufacturing facility in the community also sustained heavy damage. 


It was the second tornado to hit Barnsdall in five weeks — a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles. 


At the Hampton Inn in nearby Bartlesville, several splintered two-by-fours were driven into the building. Chunks of insulation, twisted metal and other debris were scattered over the lawn, and vehicles in the parking lot were heavily damaged, with blown-out windows. 


Hotel guest Matthew Macedo said he was ushered into a laundry room to wait out the storm. 


“When the impact occurred, it was incredibly sudden,” he said. 


Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, who toured the twister's damage Tuesday, said it was rated by weather researchers as a violent tornado with winds reaching up to 200 mph (322 kph). Stitt said he and legislative leaders have agreed to set aside $45 million in this year’s budget to help storm-damaged communities. 


Areas in Oklahoma, including Sulphur and Holdenville, are still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month.

## NetBSD 8.3 released, marks the end of the 8.0 branch

date: 2024-05-08, from: OS News

NetBSD 10 and NetBSD 9.4 were only recently released, leaving one final branch to receive what will be its last update: NetBSD 8.3. NetBSD 8.0 was originally released in 2018, so this final release marks six years of updates, which is a good track record, especially now that two newer main releases are available to choose from. With 8.3 being the final release, this means no more regular or security updates, pkgsrc no longer supports the 8.0 branch either &#8211; so yeah, time to upgrade. NetBSD 8.3 brings various updates and bug fixes for libX11, xterm, tmux, and httpd, and the root name servers and time zone data have been updated to their latest iterations as well. There&#8217;s of course a full list of changes to peruse through if you want to know every little detail that&#8217;s changed. You can update your installation in-place, of course, or download the installation media for 8.3 from one of the many mirrors.

## Georgia appeals court agrees to review ruling allowing Fani Willis to stay on Trump election case

date: 2024-05-08, from: VOA News USA

ATLANTA  — A Georgia appeals court on Wednesday agreed to review a lower court ruling allowing Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis to continue to prosecute the election interference case she brought against former President Donald Trump.


Trump and some other defendants in the case had tried to get Willis and her office removed from the case, saying her romantic relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade created a conflict of interest. Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee in March found that no conflict of interest existed that should force Willis off the case, but he granted a request from Trump and the other defendants to seek an appeal of his ruling from the Georgia Court of Appeals.




That intermediate appeals court agreed on Wednesday to take up the case. Once it rules, the losing side could ask the Georgia Supreme Court to consider an appeal.


The appeals court's decision to consider the case seems likely to cause a delay in a case and further reduce the possibility that it will get to trial before the November general election, when Trump is expected to be the Republican nominee for president.


In his order, McAfee said he planned to continue to address other pretrial motions "regardless of whether the petition is granted ... and even if any subsequent appeal is expedited by the appellate court." But Trump and the others could ask the Court of Appeals to stay the case while the appeal is pending.

The topline takeaway? Rapid expansion of wind and solar projects in 2023 likely brought the peak in global power sector emissions, and a “new era of falling fossil fuel generation is imminent.” Key findings and projections:
</p><ul>
<li>Renewables – mainly solar and wind – provided <strong>more than 30% of the world’s electricity </strong>last year for the first time. </li>
<li><span></span>Solar was the fastest-growing source of electricity generation. Wind and solar generation are<strong> growing faster than any electricity source in history</strong>. (A separate <a href="https://d2qwfv04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/X+113/d2QWfV04/VVKTsv5_hrYQW21yH655f22JtW9h8NV35dRNb4N2VVBBC3qn9gW7Y8-PT6lZ3mtW4wCz6Y2lmSCFW72gZ4P7w2Kk5W7W_hZK5DxWPcW2MLlPH5g7Zc2W3PnbBT4kSK4HW6_BCWn1dg6NFMR--9g-wm6kW18hvYh1JVNL2F3KjwnLckl1W7B7WcG8hFlJPW6zKNDD5bSCBwW4R6JXT5XSK01N3jfcRyrY60mW863DBZ3WDKjbW1fDRty641X0QW65yYff1KJ9kMW4t51PH98fbl4W2v3pB_2vsXhSW2r_PjN6PYwBVN4GFs5Q3RmRWW7lkfn35ppGTfW5VbNWq4g7Td0N1VQqVbc5vZ2W6n_2nq1wn-z1W3-0Sgz2NF-NWW4vw7Xc5bnt1Bf9ldPxj04" target="_blank">report</a> out yesterday from the U.S. Energy Information Administration found that renewables – especially solar – will cover most of the nation’s electricity growth this year.) </li>
<li><span></span>More than half of last year’s additions to solar and wind capacity were <strong>in China</strong>. </li>
<li><span></span>Hydropower fell due to drought, boosting coal generation. Had this not been the case, emissions from the power sector <strong>would already have peaked. </strong></li>
<li><strong></strong><strong>EVs, heat pumps, electrolysers, air conditioning, and data centers</strong> are key drivers of electricity demand growth. </li>
<li><span></span>Power sector <strong>emissions are expected to fall in 2024.</strong> Clean energy growth is forecast to easily cover the expected rise in electricity demand in 2024.</li>
</ul><p>
<span></span>“The renewables future has arrived,” said Dave Jones, Ember’s director of global insights. “Solar, in particular, is accelerating faster than anyone thought possible. The decline of power sector emissions is now inevitable. 2023 was likely the pivot point – peak emissions in the power sector – a major turning point in the history of energy.” But... clean electricity growth has to continue to speed up if we are to meet the COP28 goal of tripling renewables by 2030 to 60% of global supply.

Republican Gov. Phil Scott is expected to veto the bill, but the veto will likely be overturned by the state legislature.

## Washington’s willingness to engage Pyongyang exposes rare rift with Seoul

date: 2024-05-08, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The Biden administration’s apparent willingness to engage North Korea is causing a rare public rift with one of Washington’s key allies in Asia over how to achieve Pyongyang’s denuclearization.


Last week, the two allies, on separate occasions, showed differences about whether to consider “interim steps” toward North Korea’s complete denuclearization.


South Korean national security adviser Chang Ho-jin said, “U.S. senior officials confirmed several times that there are no such thing as interim steps” toward denuclearization. He made the remarks in an interview with South Korean media outlet KBS, aired on April 27.


A U.S. National Security Council spokesperson confirmed in an email to VOA’s Korean Service on April 30 that “by saying that the United States is willing to consider interim steps, we are making clear that we recognize that building trust with the DPRK and making progress toward denuclearization will take time.”


The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) is North Korea’s official name.


In response to the NSC spokesperson’s comments, a South Korean Foreign Ministry spokesperson told VOA Korean on May 1 that Chang’s remarks “reaffirm that the U.S. will not put aside complete denuclearization while it settles for a stopgap measure limiting [negotiations] to a nuclear freeze in return for sanctions relief.”


Taking interim steps toward denuclearization involves reciprocal concessions or corresponding measures that both sides are willing to make to reach that goal.


Interim steps toward denuclearization are not a new approach. The approach was tried and failed by the former Clinton and George W. Bush administrations when North Korea was engaged in negotiations with the U.S.


In March of this year, senior U.S. officials expressed Washington’s interest in considering “interim steps” amid talks that remained stalled with Pyongyang since October 2019.


A State Department spokesperson told VOA Korean in April that it made multiple attempts to communicate with North Korean officials, but that Pyongyang has not shown interest in engaging.




Experts said Seoul is concerned that Washington’s mention of interim steps and measures that could be included in those steps, especially threat reduction, could hinder Pyongyang from making a commitment toward complete denuclearization in future negotiations.


Andrew Yeo, the SK-Korea Foundation chair in Korea Studies at Brookings Institution’s Center for Asia Policy Studies, said, “Seoul prefers not to engage in any diplomatic negotiations without a DPRK commitment to denuclearization and wants to appear resolute.”


“Washington has signaled to North Korea that it’s willing to be more flexible when it comes to restarting diplomatic engagement with North Korea. Seoul may not want to give the appearance of that flexibility so is perhaps denying any legitimacy behind an ‘interim steps’ approach,” he added.


Seoul has taken a tough stance on North Korea under President Yoon Suk Yeol since he took office two years ago by focusing on deterrence and alignment with Washington and U.S.-led trilateral security cooperation with Japan.


Evans Revere, a State Department official with extensive experience negotiating with North Korea, said some critics and officials in Seoul and Tokyo are worried that the U.S. will focus on other goals Washington mentioned such as confidence building and tension reduction rather than on denuclearization.


“There is also concern that Washington may be prepared to engage in arms control talks with Pyongyang — a move that would generate deep concern among U.S. allies, in large part because it would effectively accept North Korea’s nuclear arsenal as permanent,” he said.


Talks over arms control or “nuclear freeze” that Seoul said it is concerned about or “threat reduction” or “risk reduction” mentioned by U.S. officials in March — which could be included in the interim steps — are considered equivalent to accepting North Korea as a nuclear state and opposed by some officials and analysts.


At an event held by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) on March 3, Mira Rapp-Hooper, senior director for East Asia and Oceania at the National Security Council, said the U.S. will discuss threat reduction with North Korea as it considers interim steps on the "pathway to denuclearization."


Also at an event by CSIS on March 18, Jung Pak, a U.S. senior official for North Korea, said Washington wants North Korea to take risk reduction steps and discuss sanctions and confidence-building measures.  




Victor Cha, senior vice president for Asia and Korea chair at CSIS, however, said that Rapp-Hooper's reference to "the formulation of interim measures to reduce the threat on the peninsula" in March "reflects the same pragmatic view that any negotiation has to start at step 1 — whether you call that interim measures or initial denuclearization."


"As a former negotiator, I can say that any pragmatic implementation of denuclearization would have to include such steps, which I do not think would represent de facto acceptance of DPRK nuclear status — that is neither Washington, nor Seoul's policy," he said.


Cha formerly served as deputy head of delegation for the U.S. at six-party denuclearization talks.

## Elon Musk Is Putting the EV Transition in Peril

date: 2024-05-08, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjE4Njg5Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0MTQ3OTM0M30.Sl_xbOpUFljDe0tLd4sZ-IL0WPIh6tXzpEWD4_VX8Vw/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">
	Tesla is now facing its worst crisis in years. Last week, CEO Elon Musk laid off the automaker’s roughly 500-person Supercharger team and what remained of its policy and new vehicle teams. Before that, it reported its first-quarter financial results — and they were even worse than the lackluster performance that investors were expecting.
</p><p>
	Already this year, Tesla has cut around 10% of its employees. Now Musk is promising that it will shift toward becoming an “AI” company. And on Wednesday — after we recorded this episode — Reuters <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/shift-key-episode-15-tesla-elon-musk" target="_blank">reported</a> that the Justice Department is investigating Tesla for lying about its so-called Full Self Driving software to investors. </p><p>
	Does Tesla, long a stalwart of America’s EV transition, now pose a danger to it? On this week’s episode of Shift Key, Rob and Jesse discuss the automaker’s turn away from EVs, and why Musk’s decision to lay off the Supercharger team could throw the entire country’s EV transition off track. Shift Key is hosted by Robinson Meyer, the founding executive editor of Heatmap, and Jesse Jenkins, a professor of energy systems engineering at Princeton University.

Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p><blockquote>
<strong>Jesse Jenkins:</strong> I just want to note one thing you said there, which is the role of the [National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure] funding. So the government funding here required that any recipient of the federal infrastructure funding would be open to multiple automakers’ vehicles. So you could not, Tesla could not have kept its network closed and received any of the federal money.<br/>
<br/>
And so it is interesting to think like, you know: If NEVI hadn’t existed, I’m not sure if Tesla would have made that pivot. So it’s interesting, this is an example of where government funding and requirements can really open up standards and, you know, kind of force change. So maybe it was they thought they had to do it in order to stay competitive, to get a chunk of that federal infrastructure funding. And maybe they would have been better off if they just kept a closed network and ignored the shiny pot of money that the federal government was out there … it’s hard to say, at this point.
	<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Robinson Meyer:</strong> There’s a second aspect of this, though, that I think is also confusing, which is basically that if Tesla — over the next year, every American who drives an electric vehicle is going to encounter a Tesla Supercharger for the first time, whether or not they own a Tesla, right? Because they’re, the vehicle they own is going to be integrated into the Tesla network and they’re going to be able to charge.<br/>
<br/>
That is such a sales opportunity for Tesla. Tesla needed to nail that integration, first of all, and execution, because these are not hard customers to convince to buy a Tesla. These are customers who already own an electric vehicle. And so if they’re coming to your Supercharger network, and they’re like, ‘This is an amazing network. This, like, works so much better than any other network. This works better than the chargers that my automaker wants to direct me to that aren’t Tesla, whether they be Electrify America or something else,’ that would have been an incredible marketing and sales opportunity for Tesla to convert drivers who already had chosen to go electric.
	<br/>

There’s not a better market out there. There’s not a more accessible market out there for them than people who already drive an EV and are thinking about their next EV purchase. And so it has now, if nothing else, guaranteed that the next year will feel chaotic. Maybe, through some miracle, the Supercharger network keeps working, and it keeps working pretty well. How they’re going to manage that with no remaining team, I don’t really understand — but let’s say it keeps working pretty well. They’ve really fumbled an opportunity to make Tesla seem like the easiest and most secure and most reliable, you know, value proposition out there for drivers.
	<br/>
<br/>
And I think that’s just … that’s happened now. That’s water under the bridge. They’ve really screwed this up, no matter what else happens over the next year.

## US inquiry finds widespread sexual misconduct at FDIC

date: 2024-05-08, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation must make sweeping changes to address widespread sexual harassment and other misconduct, according to an independent report released on Tuesday that raises questions about the future of the banking regulator's leadership.


The report, prompted by a Wall Street Journal investigation, cited accounts from more than 500 people, including some who alleged FDIC Chair Martin Gruenberg had engaged in bullying and verbal abuse.


Overall, the report by law firm Cleary Gottlieb paints a picture of an agency at which sexual harassment, racial discrimination and bullying were pervasive at every level and tolerated by senior leaders for years, while complaints about misconduct were met with retaliation.


"For far too many employees and for far too long, the FDIC has failed to provide a workplace safe from sexual harassment, discrimination, and other interpersonal misconduct," the report said, adding that those accused of misconduct were frequently reassigned new roles.


Underscoring the agency's toxic culture, officials tasked with addressing the problems exposed by the WSJ reports were themselves the subject of misconduct claims, the Cleary Gottlieb report found.


The findings sparked renewed calls for the ouster of Gruenberg, a Democrat who has been a senior leader at the agency for nearly two decades.


Representative Patrick McHenry, a Republican who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, called for Gruenberg's resignation following the report, saying it made clear the agency needs new leadership.


"The FDIC needs to be fixed. The women and men who work there deserve better,” Sherrod Brown, chair of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, said in a statement. “Chair Gruenberg must accept responsibility and must immediately work to make fundamental changes to the agency and its culture."


Some employees described Gruenberg as "harsh" and "aggressive," as well as prone to losing his temper, the report said. In speaking with investigators, Gruenberg said he never recalled acting inappropriately. The report said some employees reported positive interactions with him and saw his nature as more "prosecutorial."


In a statement to staff, Gruenberg said the report was "sobering" and he vowed to implement its recommendations.


He said he was ultimately responsible for everything that happened at the agency and apologized for any shortcomings. "I again want to express how very sorry I am," he added.


The report recommends the appointment of new officials devoted to changing the FDIC's culture and hiring an independent third party to assist in the transition, although it did not consider whether top leaders should resign.


It also called on the agency to establish an anonymous hotline to report misconduct and abuse, develop a more timely and transparent process for handling complaints, and take steps to ensure victims are protected and supported.


While the report found that Gruenberg's aggressive conduct was not a root cause of the more severe issues at the agency, it was skeptical of his ability to oversee the necessary dramatic overhaul.


"As the FDIC faces a crisis relating to its workplace culture, Chairman Gruenberg’s reputation raises questions about the credibility of the leadership’s response to the crisis and the 'moral authority' to lead a cultural transformation," the report stated.


The departure of Gruenberg, who was appointed by President Joe Biden in 2022, could imperil the administration's efforts to impose stricter financial rules, including a pending regulatory proposal on bank capital requirements, which has sparked a backlash from Republicans and industry representatives.


A White House spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.


If Gruenberg steps down or is removed, agency bylaws stipulate that FDIC Vice Chair Travis Hill, a Republican, take over, and the agency's board would be evenly split between Republicans and Democrats.

## US holds up some arms to Israel, sources say

date: 2024-05-08, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — U.S. President Joe Biden's administration has been holding up certain Boeing-made arms shipments to Israel, four sources familiar with the matter told Reuters, in what two of them said was an apparent political message to the close U.S. ally.


The shipments, which have been delayed for at least two weeks, involved Boeing-made Joint Direct Attack Munitions, which convert dumb bombs into precision-guided ones, as well as Small Diameter Bombs.


The sources did not elaborate further, including on the political nature of the holdups. But they come at a time when Washington is publicly pressuring Israel to postpone its planned offensive in Rafah until after it has taken steps to avert civilian casualties.


The White House and Pentagon declined comment. The news of a delayed arms shipment was first reported by Axios over the weekend and Politico first reported on the types of arms delayed and the reasoning on Tuesday.


Without addressing whether there had been a holdup in arms shipments, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre reaffirmed that Washington's commitment to Israel's security was "ironclad."


Still, when asked about the reports on the arms holdups, she added: "Two things could be true, in the sense of having those conversations, tough, direct conversations with our counterparts in Israel ... in making sure citizens lives are protected ... and getting that commitment."


The Pentagon said on Monday that there had not been a policy decision to withhold arms from Israel, America's closest Middle East ally.


Still, the delays appeared to be the first since Biden's administration offered its full support to Israel following Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, during which about 1,200 people were killed and about 250 others were abducted. About 133 of them are believed to remain in captivity in Gaza, according to Israeli tallies.


Israel's campaign to destroy Hamas has led to a seven-month-long military campaign that has killed a total of 34,789 Palestinians, most of them civilians, the Gaza Health Ministry said.


The conflict has also left many of Gaza's 2.3 million people on the brink of starvation and sparked protests in the U.S. demanding that universities and Biden withdraw support for Israel - including the provision of weaponry.


A senior Israeli official, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, did not confirm any specific holdup in arms supplies but appeared to take the reports in stride: “As the prime minister has already said, if we have to fight with our fingernails, then we’ll do what we have to do.”

The U.S. is expressing optimism that a cease-fire agreement in Gaza is within reach, a day after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected a proposed deal that Hamas said it had accepted. Israeli forces went ahead with a limited operation in eastern Rafah, prompting Hamas to warn there will be no cease-fire if that military action continues. White House Bureau Chief Patsy Widakuswara has the latest.

## US soldier detained in Russia; White House says 2nd American newly detained

date: 2024-05-08, from: VOA News USA

PENTAGON — The U.S. Army has confirmed that a U.S. soldier was arrested last week during an unauthorized visit to the Russian far eastern port city of Vladivostok, one of two recently detained Americans in Russia.


Army spokeswoman Cynthia Smith said Tuesday Staff Sergeant Gordon C. Black had been stationed in South Korea and signed out on permanent change of station leave on April 10 en route to Fort Cavazos, Texas. Instead of returning to the continental United States, Black flew through China to Vladivostok for “personal reasons.”


“Black did not request official clearance, and [the Department of Defense] did not authorize his travel to China and Russia, Smith added. 


U.S. officials told VOA he appeared to have traveled to Russia to see a woman whom he was romantically involved with.


Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters Tuesday the Army is investigating the incident and that any leave to Russia was “strictly prohibited,” according to the Department of Defense’s foreign clearance guide.


The White House said on Tuesday it confirmed “two separate cases" of U.S. citizens being detained in Russia, without identifying the second detainee.


Russian officials identified the second American as William Russell Nycum. He was detained 10 days ago in Moscow on petty hooliganism and alcohol charges, according to the Russian state news agency RIA-Novosti.


"The State Department is actively seeking consular access to both individuals, neither of whom are in Russia on behalf or in affiliation with the U.S. government," White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters.


A Russian Ministry of Interior official informed the U.S. Embassy in Moscow on May 3 that Black was arrested a day earlier in Vladivostok for theft of personal property. Smith said the Army has no further information about the charge at this time and that Black will remain in a pretrial detention facility until his next hearing. 


According to RFE/RL a TikTok account of Black’s romantic partner, Vladivostok native Aleksandra Vashchuk, contains numerous videos of the couple together in South Korea. In one video, Black is wearing his U.S. Army fatigues and kisses the camera of a woman, presumably Vashchuk, as she speaks in Russian.


RFE/RL says Vashchuk refers to Black as her husband and affectionately as “pindos,” a Russian slang word for Americans that roughly translates to “Yankee punk.”


The Associated Press reports that unnamed officials say Black is accused of stealing from his “girlfriend.”


The chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Representative Michael McCaul, said he is "deeply concerned" by reports of the detainment.


"Putin has a long history of holding American citizens hostage," McCaul said in a post shared on X. "A warning to all Americans — as the State Department has said, it is not safe to travel to Russia."


Among those being held are journalists Alsu Kurmasheva of RFE/RL and Evan Gershkovich of The Wall Street Journal, who have been detained on charges that they, their employers and their supporters reject as politically motivated. 


Also being held is Paul Whelan, who in 2020 was convicted and sentenced to 16 years in prison on espionage charges, which he and the U.S. government have repeatedly rejected.

## Judge postpones Trump's classified documents trial indefinitely

date: 2024-05-08, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The federal judge in Florida presiding over the classified documents prosecution of former President Donald Trump has canceled the May 20 trial date, postponing it indefinitely. 


The order from U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon had been expected in light of still-unresolved issues in the case and because Trump is on trial in a separate case in Manhattan charging him in connection with hush money payments during the 2016 presidential election. The New York case involves several of the same lawyers representing him in the federal case in Florida. 


In a five-page order, Cannon said on Tuesday that it would be imprudent to finalize a new trial date now, casting further doubt on federal prosecutors' ability to bring Trump to trial before the November presidential election. 


Trump faces dozens of felony counts accusing him of illegally hoarding at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, classified documents that he took with him after he left the White House in 2021, and then obstructing the FBI's efforts to get them back. He has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing. 


Trump faces four criminal cases as he seeks to reclaim the White House, but outside of the New York prosecution, it's not clear that any of the other three will reach trial before the election. 


The Supreme Court is weighing Trump's arguments that he is immune from federal prosecution in a separate case from special counsel Jack Smith charging him with plotting to overturn the 2020 presidential election. Prosecutors in Fulton County, Georgia, have also brought a separate case related to election subversion, though it's not clear when that might reach trial.
