<p>date: 2024-07-11, from: Logic Matters blog</p>
<p>
I was tempted, just for a moment, to preface all that abstract nonsense,
all those higher ramblings, with καὶ παίζειν ὅτε καιρός, ἐπαίξαμεν•
ἡνίκα καιρὸς οὐκέτι, λωιτέρης φροντίδος ἁψόμεθα. When it was time for
play, we played. Now that is no longer we will apply ourselves to higher
thoughts. So writes Philodemus, the final two […]

<h2
id="oil-tanker-held-by-iran-for-over-a-year-heads-toward-international-waters">Oil
tanker held by Iran for over a year heads toward international
waters</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — An oil tanker held by Iran for over a
year after being seized amid tensions between Tehran and the United
States was sailing Thursday toward international waters, tracking data
showed.</p>
<p>The Marshall Islands-flagged tanker Advantage Sweet traveled toward
the Strait of Hormuz, where it was seized in April 2023 by Iran’s navy
while carrying $50 million worth of oil from Kuwait for Chevron
Corporation. That’s according to tracking data analyzed by The
Associated Press, which also listed the vessel’s destination at Khor
Fakkan in the United Arab Emirates, which has been the first port of
call for other vessels leaving Iranian detention.</p>
<p>Iran did not acknowledge the ship’s departure. It came after an
Iranian court on Thursday ordered the U.S. government to pay over $6.7
billion in compensation over a Swedish company stopping its supply of
special dressings and bandages for those afflicted by a rare skin
disorder after Washington imposed sanctions on the Islamic Republic.</p>
<p>Iran’s government initially said it seized the Advantage Sweet
because it hit another vessel, a claim not supported by any evidence.
Then Iranian officials linked the Advantage Sweet’s seizure to the court
case that was decided Thursday.</p>
<p>A report by the state-run IRNA news agency described the $6.7 billion
order as being filed on behalf of 300 plaintiffs, including family
members of victims and those physically and emotionally damaged. IRNA
said about 20 patients died after the Swedish company’s decision.</p>
<p>Epidermolysis bullosa is a rare genetic condition that causes
blisters all over the body and eyes. It can be incredibly painful and
kill those afflicted. The young who suffer from the disease are known as
“butterfly children” as their skin can appear as fragile as a
butterfly’s wing.</p>
<p>The order comes as U.S. judges have issued rulings that call for
billions of dollars to be paid by Iran over attacks linked to Tehran, as
well as those detained by Iran and used as pawns in negotiations between
the countries — something Iran has responded to with competing lawsuits
accusing the U.S. of involvement in a 2017 Islamic State group attack.
The United Nations’ highest court also last year rejected Tehran’s legal
bid to free up some $2 billion in Iranian Central Bank assets frozen by
U.S. authorities.</p>
<p>In 2018, then-President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the U.S.
from Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, apparently sparking the
Swedish company to withdraw from the Iranian market. Iran now says it
locally produces the bandages.</p>
<p>Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, has maintained that the
Advantage Sweet was “seized under false pretenses.” It has since written
off the cargo as a loss.</p>
<p>The U.S. Navy has blamed Iran for a series of limpet mine attacks on
vessels that damaged tankers in 2019, as well as for a fatal drone
attack on an Israeli-linked oil tanker that killed two European crew
members in 2021.</p>
<p>Tehran denies carrying out the attacks, but a wider shadow war
between Iran and the West has played out in the region’s volatile
waters. Iranian tanker seizures have been a part of it since 2019. The
last major seizure came when Iran took two Greek tankers in May 2022 and
held them until November of that year.</p>

<p>The qualities and behavior of dark matter, the invisible “glue” of

<p>date: 2024-07-11, from: Ben Werdmuller’s blog</p>

<p>
Tracy has smartly split hers up into categories. I’ll do the same here.
And just as Lou said, I’d love to see your list!
</p>
<h3>
Formative Books
</h3>
<p>
These books disproportionately influenced me when I was a much younger
adult, and helped contribute to the way I saw the world in a hundred
ways, from my sense of what was possible to my sense of humor.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<a href="https://bookshop.org/a/7949/9780345418913">The Hitchhiker’s
Guide to the Galaxy, by Douglas Adams</a> — I don’t quote it, but the
clever irreverence still sweeps me off my feet. A large part of me
wishes I was Douglas Adams and always will.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellations:_Stories_of_the_Future">Constellations:
Stories of the Future</a> — a mind-blowing collection of science fiction
short stories, some of which became episodes of <em>The Twilight
Zone</em> and so on. Jerome Bixby’s <em>It’s a Good Life</em>and Fritz
Leiber’s <em>A Pail of Air</em> are standouts for me.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://bookshop.org/a/7949/9781501167713">Something Wicked
This Way Comes, by Ray Bradbury</a> — There’s a warm, beating heart at
the center of this story, and that’s what draws me in every time (and
I’ve reread it countless times). There are better Bradbury books which
have probably aged better — you’re probably thinking of them right now —
but at the time, it resonated.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://bookshop.org/a/7949/9780679406419">Maus, by Art
Spiegelman</a> — It was much later until I really understood how my own
family was affected by WWII, but I connected to this hard. It was also
the first graphic novel that made me really think about the
possibilities of the form: something that was clearly far beyond
superheroes and fantasy.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://bookshop.org/a/7949/9780385490818">The Handmaid’s Tale,
by Margaret Atwood</a> — Practically a documentary at this point, but
it’s always been a riveting work of speculative fiction that does what
that genre does best: help us grasp with elements of our present. To
most of us, it’s a warning. To the Heritage Foundation, I guess it’s a
manual.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://bookshop.org/a/7949/9780451524935">1984, by George
Orwell</a> — It’s hard to imagine a more culturally influential science
fiction novel. I love it: although it has a lot to say, I find it to be
a page-turner. If you haven’t read Sandra Newman’s follow-up,
<a href="https://bookshop.org/a/7949/9780063265332">Julia</a>, run to
get it: it’s an impressive work of fiction in its own right that
reframes the story in brilliant ways.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://bookshop.org/a/7949/9780061624261">Microserfs, by
Douglas Coupland</a> — Coupland sometimes reads like a funnier Bret
Easton Ellis (which is to say zeitgeisty but hollow —
<a href="https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/shampoo-planet_douglas-coupland/689466/item/14413484/#isbn=0671755056&amp;idiq=14413484">Shampoo
Planet</a> and <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/7949/9780679781486">The
Rules of Attraction</a> are cousins), but at his best he captures
something real. Microserfs gave me that first taste of the community and
camaraderie around building software together: it’s set in an earlier
version of the industry than I got to be a part of, but its depiction of
those early years is recognizable. Even the outlandish characters don’t
feel out of place. I don’t think it’s probably aged at all well, but it
resonated with me hard in my early twenties.
</li>
</ol>
<h3>
Motivating External Change
</h3>
<p>
These books helped me think about how we need to change, and what we
might do.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<a href="https://bookshop.org/a/7949/9780679406419">The Jakarta Method:
Washington’s Anticommunist Crusade and the Mass Murder Program That
Shaped Our World, by Vincent Bevins</a> — I’m convinced that every
American citizen should read this, in order to better understand how we
show up in the world. (Spoiler alert: we don’t show up well.)
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://bookshop.org/a/7949/9780553447453">Evicted: Poverty and
Profit in the American City, by Matthew Desmond</a> — Visceral,
accessible, memorable reporting on poverty and housing. Again, it should
probably be required reading for American citizens.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://bookshop.org/a/7949/9780316300148">The Ministry for the
Future, by Kim Stanley Robinson</a> — There’s a very silly passage in
this book about the role of blockchain in solving climate change (come
<em>on</em>), as well as quite a bit in favor of climate engineering,
which I think is highly dubious bordering on terrifying. But at the same
time, the novel succeeds at painting a visceral picture of what the
effects of the climate crisis could be.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://bookshop.org/a/7949/9780593230275">Caste: The Origins
of Our Discontents, by Isabel Wilkerson</a> — A key to understanding
America. There’s a lot spelled out here that I simply didn’t know,
running the gamut from the details of peoples’ everyday lived
experiences to the chilling fact that Hitler based his Nazi caste system
on Jim Crow.
</li>
</ol>
<h3>
Books That Changed Me
</h3>
<p>
These books either left me a different person somehow or touched
something in me I didn’t know existed.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<a href="https://bookshop.org/a/7949/9780807083697">Kindred, by Octavia
Butler</a> — I wish I’d discovered Butler earlier. Her work is immediate
and deeply human, and while it shouldn’t have had to change a whole
genre, it absolutely did.
<a href="https://bookshop.org/a/7949/9781538732182">Parable of the
Sower</a> is seismic, of course, and rightly famous. (It’s also getting
to be a harder and harder read in the current climate.) But it was
Kindred that opened the doors to a different kind of science fiction to
me, and through it, all kinds of possibilities.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://bookshop.org/a/7949/9780063072657">How High We Go in
the Dark, by Sequoia Nagamatsu</a> — I have never read a more effective
metaphor for grief and change. I read it when I was in the depths of
grief myself, and the way this book captures the nuance, the brutality,
and the beauty is poetry. I still think about one chapter almost daily.
(It’s the rollercoaster. If you know, you know.)
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://bookshop.org/a/7949/9780143135692">The Color Purple, by
Alice Walker</a> — A breathtaking example of a modern novel: a
masterclass in form as well as content. Not a word is wasted in bringing
the lived experiences of her characters to life (and through them, so
many more). I’ve read this many times, and I’ve never made it through
without absolutely weeping.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://bookshop.org/a/7949/9780385480017">Bird by Bird: Some
Instructions on Writing and Life, by Anne Lamott</a> — So often
recommended to writers for really good reasons, <em>Bird by Bird</em> is
not just the best book I’ve ever read about writing but also about
embarking upon <em>any</em> large project. It’s hopeful, nourishing,
actionable, and lovely. Its lessons still motivate me.

citing data from energy think tank Ember. Solar and wind farms generated
401.4 terawatt hours (TWh) compared to 390.5 TWh generated from nuclear
reactors, setting 2024 on pace to be the “first full year when more U.S.
electricity will come from renewables than from any other form of clean
power.” It’s helpful to compare these numbers to the same period last
year, when nuclear generated 9% more power than solar and wind. Solar
saw the greatest gains, with output 30% higher in the first half of 2024
compared to 2023; wind generation was up 10% and nuclear was up just
3.4%. Between 2018 and 2023, installed capacity grew by 168% for utility
solar and 56% for wind. Meanwhile, nuclear generation capacity dropped
by 4%.

for oil will peak in 2025, and the related carbon emissions will, too.
The analysis is based on current climate policies and pledges, growing
efficiency standards for the internal combustion engine and a rise in
electric vehicles, and rapid expansion of renewables. By 2050, oil’s
share of the energy mix is predicted to fall to about 25%, and that
would decrease even more, to just 10%, if nations strengthen (and follow
through on) their climate pledges to better align with the Paris
Agreement.

The report notes that energy demand is rising, and says the world must
enter an “energy substitution” phase in which clean energy supply
increases quickly to keep up while also allowing for fossil fuels to be
phased out. “The longer it takes for the world to move to a rapid and
sustained energy transition, the greater the risk of a costly and
disorderly adjustment pathway in the future,”

<p>date: 2024-07-11, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
Donald Trump will announce his running mate any day now, and according
to multiple reports his choice has come down to Florida Senator Marco
Rubio, Ohio Senator J. D. Vance, and North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum.
All erstwhile critics of Trump, they now share a fervent admiration for
the former president they once scorned. But where do they stand on
climate change?
</p>
<p>
Opinions on climate within the Republican Party are
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/nikki-haley-ron-desantis-fracking-environmentalist-gop-debate" target="_self"><u>complex</u></a>,
and these three men reflect the divisions. According to
<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/03/01/how-republicans-view-climate-change-and-energy-issues/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Pew
Research Center polls</u></a>, 47% of Republicans over the age of 65
believe that human activity contributes a great deal or some to climate
change, but a full 79% of Republicans under 30 think so. Yet only a tiny
number of them feel any urgency around climate: In
<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/02/29/americans-top-policy-priority-for-2024-strengthening-the-economy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
Pew poll</u></a> earlier this year, only 12% of Republicans said climate
should be a top priority for the president and Congress, the lowest
score of the 20 issues they asked about. (59% of Democrats said it
should be a top priority.)
</p>
<p>
That leaves room for Republican politicians to take a variety of
positions, as long as they agree that the ideas favored by climate hawks
are bad. For many, the optimal position is a kind of malign neglect:
They’ll admit that warming temperatures are bad, but somehow find their
way to opposing all measures to address the problem. With one partial
exception, that describes all of Trump’s likeliest running mates.
</p>
<h3>
Doug Burgum
</h3>
<p>
Burgum can be a little tough to pin down on climate, in large part
because of how he shrewdly avoids talking about the issue in the
culture-war terms so many in his party prefer. At the start of his
second term he
<a href="https://www.thedickinsonpress.com/business/gov-doug-burgum-calls-for-north-dakota-to-be-carbon-neutral-by-2030" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>set
a target</u></a> of achieving carbon neutrality by 2030 — but without
regulation or any reduction in fossil fuel production. Instead, Burgum
wants the state to become a center for carbon capture, calling the room
underground to store large amounts of carbon the state’s “geologic
jackpot.”
</p>
<p>
As part of that project, Burgum has advocated the construction of a
pipeline to carry CO2 into the state from other Midwest states, which he
touts as simply a money-making proposition. “This has nothing to do with
climate change,”
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-burgum-pipeline-north-dakota-vice-president-ba0bbfa00984de04ab23624b963dc66f" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>he
said in March</u></a>. “This has to do with markets.” He has
<a href="https://futurefarmermag.com/qa-with-governor-doug-burgum-on-carbon-neutrality/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>touted</u></a>
environmental, social, and governance-related investing, which focuses
on companies with strong environmental records, as an opportunity for
the state to lure capital — but has also
<a href="https://wdeawebsite.blob.core.windows.net/usrfiles/documents/jointgovernors-policy-statementonesg_3-16-2023.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>joined</u></a>
with other Republican governors to condemn it.
</p>
<p>
Burgum has close ties with the oil industry, so much so that he has
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/09/climate/burgum-energy-trump-oil.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>become</u></a>
Trump’s key liaison to the industry and its
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-47-committee-big-oil" target="_self"><u>billionaire
magnates</u></a>; he has also been mentioned as a possible energy
secretary if he is not Trump’s running mate, which would make him the
administration’s chief fossil fuel advocate.
</p>
<p>
In other words, Burgum seems to be on multiple sides of the climate
issue. He’s a fossil-fuel promoter and
<a href="https://northdakotamonitor.com/2024/04/30/burgum-gives-ev-plan-the-cold-shoulder/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>critic</u></a>
of electric vehicles who wants to make his state carbon neutral. And you
will look in vain for any statement where Burgum says exactly what kind
of threat he believes climate change poses, or even if he thinks it is
happening at all; in technocratic style, he shifts any question on the
issue to economic and practical concerns.
</p>
<h3>
Marco Rubio
</h3>
<p>
With its frequent hurricanes and dramatic sea level rise, Florida sees
direct and repeated effects of climate change as much as any state in
the country. Yet it took Marco Rubio many years to arrive at his current
position: In the early part of his career he was a clear climate denier,
but lately he has taken something more like the prevailing Republican
view, which is that while climate change is happening and human activity
may be contributing to it, we shouldn’t actually do much about it. At
the very least, we shouldn’t do anything that comes with even the
smallest cost in dollars or convenience.
</p>
<p>
During his first run for Senate in 2010, Rubio
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140513233119/https://www.tbo.com/ap/politics/rubio-questions-climate-change-83470" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>said</u></a>,
“The climate is always changing” — a common dodge among climate deniers,
used to make them sound like they aren’t completely oblivious while they
refuse to acknowledge the causes and consequences of
post-industrialization warming. But “I don’t think there’s the
scientific evidence to justify” the idea that humans have anything to do
with it, he added.
</p>
<p>
He continued to hold that position for years. “I do not believe that
human activity is causing these dramatic changes to our climate the way
these scientists are portraying it,”
<a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2014/may/13/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-humans-are-not-causing-climate-ch/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>he
said in 2014</u></a>. But over time, Rubio became less hesitant about
admitting the reality of warming, even if he
<a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/10/22/18007922/climate-change-republicans-denial-marco-rubio-trump" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>steered
away</u></a> from talking about the cause. He
<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/08/19/rubio-on-climate-change-we-should-choose-adaptive-solutions-column/2019310001/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>proposed</u></a>
modest measures to increase climate resilience, while always pairing
them with
<a href="https://www.rubio.senate.gov/icymi-rubio-exposes-left-s-climate-whataboutism/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>attacks</u></a>
on more aggressive action as an attempt by leftist radicals to destroy
the economy.
</p>
<p>
Today, Rubio is a member of the bipartisan
<a href="https://www.coons.senate.gov/climate-solutions-caucus/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Senate
Climate Solutions Caucus</u></a>, which has occasional meetings but
steers away from taking any positions on particular legislation or
regulations, making it mostly a way for senators to say “I care” without
committing themselves to action.
</p>
<h3>
J. D. Vance
</h3>
<p>
When Vance talks about climate, it’s in the terms of a culture warrior,
heaping contempt on liberals and their goals for a safer and cleaner
environment. His 2022 Senate campaign against Democrat Tim Ryan featured
substantial discussion of climate issues, with Vance regularly
condemning efforts to reduce emissions and lamenting the decline of
coal. “All of this ‘bring American manufacturing back’ from the
Democrats is fake unless we stop the green energy fantasy,”
<a href="https://x.com/JDVance1/status/1553001982662791170" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>he
tweeted that July</u></a>. “Solar panels can’t power a modern
manufacturing economy. That’s why the Chinese are building coal power
plants, something Tim Ryan’s donors won’t let America do.”
</p>
<p>
“If you want to make our environment more clean, the way to do it is to
invest in Ohio natural gas,”
<a href="https://woub.org/2022/08/17/j-d-vance-and-tim-ryan-square-off-on-electric-vehicle-measures-in-new-federal-climate-change-plan/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>he’s
said</u></a>. Or as
<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6314984883112" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>he
told Fox News</u></a>, “The obsession Democrats have with eliminating
fossil fuels is crazy.”
</p>
<p>
Like Trump, Vance has emphasized his loathing for electric vehicles.
“Even if there was a climate crisis, I don’t know how the way to solve
it is to buy more Chinese manufactured electric vehicles,”
<a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/18102022/ohio-senate-climate-jd-vance-tim-ryan/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>he
said</u></a> on a radio show in 2022 in response to the EV incentives in
the Inflation Reduction Act (which in fact requires that to qualify for
subsidies vehicles must be mostly American-made with domestic materials;
<a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/12/28/1219158071/ev-electric-vehicles-tax-credit-car-shopping-tesla-ford-vw-gm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
requirements</u></a> are complicated, but no Chinese vehicles qualify).
“The whole EV thing is a scam, right?”
</p>
<p>
Always attuned to the value of a PR stunt, Vance
<a href="https://www.vance.senate.gov/press-releases/senator-vance-introduces-legislation-to-heighten-penalties-for-art-vandals/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>introduced</u></a>
a bill he called the “Consequences for Climate Vandals Act,” meant to
crack down on the scourge of climate activists throwing soup on
paintings. Fox News was
<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-lawmaker-crack-down-climate-change-activists-deface-historical-artwork" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>pleased</u></a>,
but the bill went nowhere, leaving America dangerously vulnerable to
art-based climate protests.
</p>
<p>
This is the common thread running through Vance’s comments on climate:
Unlike Rubio, who may have no choice but to discuss the effects of
warming given the state he represents, Vance almost never mentions these
effects. He turns any discussion of climate into an attack on liberals,
environmentalists, and Democrats for their supposedly ruinous ideas to
address the problem. If Burgum’s response to climate is <em><em>Can we
make money off this?</em></em> and Rubio’s is <em><em>It’s serious, but
let’s not be hasty</em></em>, Vance’s could be summed up as <em><em>Go
to hell, libs</em></em>.
</p>
<p>
No matter who Trump picks, his vice president is unlikely to be anything
but the most tentative voice of reason in the administration’s climate
policy, even in the best of circumstances. None of these three has given
us much reason to think he would risk his own position by standing in
the way of what will no doubt be a determined effort to remove
regulations on the fossil fuel industry, undo the carrot-based approach
of the Biden administration to encouraging a green transition, and
generally let the emissions rip. Or even that they’d want to.

Ukrainian leaders to meet Thursday at Washington summit</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — NATO and Ukrainian leaders are to meet Thursday in
Washington, a day after NATO allies bolstered support for Ukraine to
join the alliance.</p>
<p>The NATO summit’s final day will also include talks with leaders from
Australia, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and the European Union
addressing security challenges and cooperation.</p>
<p>A NATO communique released by the 32-member bloc Wednesday said
Ukraine’s path to NATO membership is “irreversible.”</p>
<p>“It’s not a question of if, but when,” NATO Secretary-General Jens
Stoltenberg told reporters Wednesday.</p>
<p>The United States was once deeply concerned about whether Ukraine was
ready for NATO membership but now appears resolved to ensure Kyiv
eventually joins the alliance.</p>
<p>“We’re providing that bridge to membership for Ukraine. It’s really a
significant deliverable,” Michael Carpenter, the senior director for
Europe at the National Security Council, told VOA.</p>
<p>Stoltenberg said that when fighting stops in Ukraine, NATO will need
to ensure that halt will be the final end to violence there.</p>
<p>The way to ensure it stops for good, Stoltenberg said, is NATO
membership for Ukraine. Otherwise, he said, Russia could continue its
aggression.</p>
<p>Unlike the European Union, which began negotiations with Ukraine to
join its ranks on June 25, there is no consensus yet about Ukraine
joining NATO.</p>
<p>F-16 transfer under way</p>
<p>Meanwhile, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the first
American-made F-16 fighter jets are currently being delivered to Ukraine
and are expected to patrol Ukrainian skies in coming weeks.</p>
<p>“The transfer of F-16s is officially under way, and Ukraine will be
flying F-16s this summer,” he said at the summit.</p>
<p>In a statement Wednesday, Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof, Danish
Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and U.S. President Joe Biden announced
that the Dutch and Danish governments were providing the F-16s, while
Belgium and Norway had committed to send more aircraft to Ukraine.</p>
<p>NATO member heads of state held their first working session of the
summit Wednesday as they sought to boost the alliance’s support for
Ukraine and enhance their own defense and deterrence efforts.</p>
<p>At the start of the session, Biden said Russia was ramping up its
defense production with Chinese, North Korean and Iranian help.</p>
<p>To counter their efforts, he said, NATO members must continue to
invest more in defense production.</p>
<p>“We cannot allow the alliance to fall behind,” Biden said.</p>
<p>China called out</p>
<p>In the NATO communique, all 32 allies on Wednesday also called on
China to cease its support for Russia’s war effort against Kyiv,
including its transfer of dual-use materials, such as weapons
components, equipment and raw materials that aid Russia’s defense
sector.</p>
<p>“The PRC cannot enable the largest war in Europe in recent history
without this negatively impacting its interests and reputation,” the
leaders wrote.</p>
<p>Asked by VOA whether the statement was a strong enough message to
deter China from continuing to support Russia, Stoltenberg replied in
the press conference that Wednesday’s declaration is “the strongest
message that NATO allies have ever sent on China’s contributions to
Russia’s illegal war against Ukraine.”</p>
<p>A spokesperson for China’s mission to the European Union rejected the
NATO statement, calling it “filled with Cold War mentality and
belligerent rhetoric.”</p>
<p>NATO allies invited Indo-Pacific partners from Japan, South Korea,
Australia and New Zealand to also attend this week’s summit. Officials
say their inclusion reflects their importance during growing Chinese,
North Korean, Russian and Iranian aggression.</p>

id="las-vegas-hits-record-of-fifth-consecutive-day-of-46.1-celsius-or-greater">Las
Vegas hits record of fifth consecutive day of 46.1 Celsius or
greater</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LAS VEGAS — Las Vegas baked Wednesday in its record fifth consecutive
day of temperatures sizzling at 46.1 Celsius or greater amid a
lengthening hot spell that is expected to broil much of the U.S. into
the weekend.</p>
<p>The temperature climbed to 46.1 shortly after 1 p.m. at Harry Reid
International Airport, breaking the old mark of four consecutive days
set in July 2005. And the record could be extended, or even doubled, by
the weekend.</p>
<p>Even by desert standards, the prolonged baking that Nevada’s largest
city is experiencing is nearly unprecedented, with forecasters calling
it “the most extreme heat wave” since the National Weather Service began
keeping records in Las Vegas in 1937.</p>
<p>Already the city has broken 16 heat records since June 1, well before
the official start of summer, “and we’re not even halfway through July
yet,” meteorologist Morgan Stessman said Wednesday. That includes an
all-time high of 48.8 C set on Sunday, which beat the previous 47.2 C
record.</p>
<p>Alyse Sobosan said this July has felt the hottest in the 15 years she
has lived in Las Vegas. She said she doesn’t step outside during the day
if she can help it.</p>
<p>“It’s oppressively hot,” she said. “It’s like you can’t really live
your life.”</p>
<p>It’s also dangerously hot, health officials have emphasized. There
have been at least nine heat-related deaths this year in Clark County,
which encompasses Las Vegas, according to the county coroner’s office.
Officials say the toll is likely higher.</p>
<p>“Even people of average age who are seemingly healthy can suffer heat
illness when it’s so hot it’s hard for your body to cool down,” said
Alexis Brignola, an epidemiologist at the Southern Nevada Health
District.</p>
<p>For homeless residents and others without access to safe
environments, officials have set up emergency cooling centers at
community centers across southern Nevada.</p>
<p>The Las Vegas area has been under an excessive heat warning on three
separate occasions this summer, totaling about 12 days of dangerous heat
with little relief even after the sun goes down, Stessman said.</p>
<p>Keith Bailey and Lee Doss met early Wednesday morning at a Las Vegas
park to beat the heat and exercise their dogs, Breakie, Ollie and
Stanley.</p>
<p>“If I don’t get out by 8:30 in the morning, then it’s not going to
happen that day,” Bailey said, wearing a sunhat while the dogs played in
the grass.</p>
<p>More than 142 million people around the U.S. were under heat alerts
Wednesday, especially in Western states, where dozens of locations tied
or broke heat records over the weekend and are expected to keep doing so
all week.</p>
<p>Oregon has seen record daily high temperatures, with Portland
reaching 39.4 C and Salem and Eugene hitting 40.5 C on Tuesday. The
number of potentially heat-related deaths in Oregon has risen to 10,
according to the state medical examiner’s office. The latest two deaths
involved a 54-year-old man in Jackson County and a 27-year-old man in
Klamath County.</p>
<p>On the other side of the nation, the National Weather Service warned
of major-to-extreme heat risk over portions of the East Coast.</p>
<p>An excessive heat warning remained in place Wednesday for the
Philadelphia area, northern Delaware and nearly all of New Jersey.
Temperatures were around 32.2 C for most of the region, and forecasters
warned the heat index could soar as high as 42.2 C. The warning was due
to expire at 8 p.m. Wednesday, though forecasters said there may be a
need to extend it.</p>
<p>The heat was blamed for a motorcyclist’s death over the weekend in
Death Valley National Park. At Death Valley on Tuesday, tourists queued
for photos in front of a giant thermometer that was reading 48.9 C.</p>
<p>Simon Pell and Lisa Gregory from London left their air-conditioned RV
to experience a midday blast of heat that would be unthinkable back
home.</p>
<p>“I wanted to experience what it would feel like,” Pell said. “It’s an
incredible experience.”</p>
<p>At the Grand Canyon, the National Park Service was investigating the
third hiker death in recent weeks. Temperatures on parts of some trails
can reach 49 C in the shade.</p>
<p>An excessive heat warning continued Wednesday in many parts of
southern and central Arizona. Forecasters said the high in Phoenix was
expected to reach 45.5 C after it hit 46.6 C Tuesday, tying the previous
record for the date set in 1958.</p>
<p>Authorities were investigating the death of a 2-year-old who was left
alone in a hot vehicle Tuesday afternoon in Marana, near Tucson, police
said. At Lake Havasu, a 4-month-old died from heat-related complications
Friday, the Mohave County Sheriff’s Department said.</p>
<p>The U.S. heat wave came as the global temperature in June was a
record warm for the 13th straight month and marked the 12th straight
month that the world was 1.5 degrees Celsius  warmer than pre-industrial
times, the European climate service Copernicus said. Most of this heat,
trapped by human-caused climate change, is from long-term warming from
greenhouse gases emitted by the burning of coal, oil and natural gas,
scientists say.</p>
<p>Firefighters in Henderson, Nevada, last week became the first in the
region to deploy what city spokesperson Madeleine Skains called “polar
pods,” devices filled with water and ice to cool a person exhibiting
symptoms of heat stroke or a related medical emergency.</p>
<p>Extreme heat in the West has also dried out vegetation that fuels
wildfires.</p>
<p>A blaze burning in northern Oregon, about 178 kilometers east of
Portland, blew up to 28 square kilometers by Wednesday afternoon due to
hot temperatures, gusty wind and low humidity, according to the Oregon
State Fire Marshal. The Larch Creek Fire closed Highway 197 and forced
evacuations for remote homes.</p>
<p>In California, firefighters were battling least 19 wildfires
Wednesday, including a 117-square-kilometer blaze that prompted
evacuation orders for about 200 homes in the mountains of Santa Barbara
County.</p>

plan to boost Pacific air power seen as counterbalance to China</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — A U.S. plan to boost its Pacific air power is seen by
analysts as an effort to reinforce deterrence in the Indo-Pacific and
counterbalance China’s attempt to gain dominance in the region.</p>
<p>The U.S. Air Force plans to upgrade more than 80 fighter jets
stationed at Japanese bases over the next several years as part of a $10
billion program to modernize its forces there.</p>
<p>The Defense Department announced the plan last week, saying it aims
to enhance the U.S.-Japan alliance and bolster deterrence in the
Indo-Pacific.</p>
<p>“This is a necessary upgrade that has been planned for some time. And
combined with Japan’s own investments, it will help maintain some degree
of air power balance between the allies and China’s progress in air
force modernization,” said James Schoff, senior director of the
U.S.-Japan NEXT Alliance Initiative at the Sasakawa Peace Foundation
USA.</p>
<p>“Without it, the credibility of U.S. deterrent capacity would be much
weaker, which could cause Beijing to doubt U.S. seriousness about
protecting the status quo across the Taiwan Strait and prompt more
aggressive Chinese behavior,” Schoff said.</p>
<p>The Taiwanese Defense Ministry said it spotted 37 Chinese aircraft
near Taiwan on Wednesday as they headed to the Western Pacific for
drills with the Shandong aircraft carrier.</p>
<p>Chinese jets and warships have frequently made dangerous maneuvers
around the self-ruled island of Taiwan, which Beijing claims as a part
of its own territory.</p>
<p>Former U.S. Indo-Pacific Commander John Aquilino told the Senate
Armed Services Committee in March that China could soon have the world’s
largest air force.</p>
<p>China is currently the third-largest air power in the world, behind
the United States and Russia.</p>
<p>China’s rapid military modernization efforts have led it to possess
more than 3,150 aircraft, of which about 2,400 are combat aircraft,
including fighters, strategic and tactical bombers, and attack aircraft,
according to the Pentagon’s 2023 report on China’s military power.</p>
<p>Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington,
told VOA on Monday that “U.S.-Japan relations should not target or harm
other countries’ interests and should not undermine regional peace and
stability.”</p>
<p>Upgrade designed to help defend Japan</p>
<p>In addition to protecting Taiwan, the upgrade — which includes the
advanced F-35 jets — also will help U.S. Forces Japan (USFJ) deter North
Korea and defend Japan’s Southwest Islands, said James Przystup, a
senior fellow at the Hudson Institute.</p>
<p>Japan has a territorial dispute with China over what it calls the
Senkaku Islands and what China calls the Diaoyu Islands.</p>
<p>Japan and Russia also have a dispute over islands off Hokkaido, which
Japan calls the Northern Territories and Russia calls the Kuril
Islands.</p>
<p>The U.S. aircraft upgrade plan is to modify several deployed F-35B
jets stationed at the Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni in Yamaguchi
prefecture south of Hiroshima.</p>
<p>The Misawa Air Base in Japan’s northern Aomori prefecture will see 36
F-16 aircraft be replaced with 48 F-35A jets.</p>
<p>Aircraft will be rotated</p>
<p>At Kadena Air Base in Japan’s southern island of Okinawa, 48 F-15 C/D
jets will be replaced with 36 new F-15EX jets. During the upgrades,
fourth- and fifth-generation tactical aircraft will be dispatched on a
rotational basis, according to the Pentagon.</p>
<p>“The upgrades will provide qualitative and quantitative boosts to the
USFJ inventory, which will also enhance the U.S.-Japan alliance’s
readiness against China, North Korea and Russia,” said Ryo
Hinata-Yamaguchi, a professor at the University of Tokyo and a
nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Indo-Pacific
Security Initiative.</p>
<p>“Benefits will be seen not only in aerial operations but also
guarding U.S. and Japanese capabilities for naval and amphibious
operations. The platforms are not simply about technological superiority
for combat, but also more advanced electronic warfare capabilities to
penetrate weaknesses of China, North Korea and Russia,” he said.</p>
<p>China often conducts joint air drills with Russia over the waters
near South Korea and Japan. In December, Chinese and Russian jets
entered South Korea’s Air Defense Identification Zone, prompting Seoul
to scramble fighter jets in response.</p>
<p>David Maxwell, vice president of the Center for Asia Pacific
Strategy, said, “Russia has been conducting some combined operations
with China on a limited basis recently, so if Russia operates in the
Indo-Pacific, it will certainly indicate these systems will contribute
to the defense of U.S.-allies’ interests.”</p>
<p>Maxwell said U.S. bases in Japan give the U.S. “a lot of operational
flexibility to be able to deal with multiple contingencies, either on
the Korean Peninsula or in the South China Sea, or really, anywhere in
Asia.”</p>
<p>Okinawa is about 740 kilometers (459.8 miles) from Taiwan and 990
kilometers (615.1 miles) from South Korea’s southern port city of Busan.
Kadena, which the U.S. calls “the keystone of the Pacific,” is the
largest U.S. installation in the Indo-Pacific.</p>
<p>Zack Cooper, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, who
served as special assistant to the principal deputy undersecretary of
defense for policy during the George W. Bush administration, said
rotating aircraft presence at Kadena during the upgrade transition helps
the U.S. disperse them in case of an attack.</p>
<p>“Kadena Air Base is under greater threat than it’s been in decades,”
from a range of Chinese capabilities, both ballistic and cruise
missiles, he said. “There are a couple of options for how to deal with
that. One is for the U.S. to disperse its forces more so that if there
was an attack, there would be less concentration of U.S. forces.”</p>

Ukraine’s path to membership in the organization is “irreversible,”

<p>Asked by VOA whether the statement was a strong enough message to
deter China from continuing to support Russia, Stoltenberg replied in
the press conference that Wednesday’s declaration was “the strongest
message that NATO allies have ever sent on China’s contributions to
Russia’s illegal war against Ukraine.”</p>
<p>NATO allies invited Indo-Pacific partners from Japan, South Korea,
Australia and New Zealand to attend this week’s summit. Officials said
their inclusion relayed the importance of these partners amid growing
aggression from China, North Korea, Russia and Iran.</p>

<h2
id="playbook-for-controlling-government-bureaucracy-prepared-for-trump">Playbook
for controlling government bureaucracy prepared for Trump</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>white house — “If I’m elected president, we are going to drain the
swamp in Washington, D.C.,” vowed Donald Trump – in 2016.</p>
<p>Eight years later, in his quest for a second, non-consecutive term,
“drain the swamp” – meaning to rid government of those who impose policy
but are unaccountable to the president – is still a key Trump campaign
slogan. If the Republican is victorious in November, he will have a
detailed playbook for placing the entire federal bureaucracy under his
direct control.</p>
<p>What is essentially a manual for how to swing a wrecking ball at the
administrative apparatus of government, which Trump has decried as the
“deep state,” has been written with the cooperation of more than 100
conservative organizations. The 922-page handbook, known as Project
2025, was organized and published by the right-wing Heritage
Foundation. </p>
<p>“Project 2025 is a plan to execute what amounts to a comprehensive
authoritarian takeover of American government,” wrote Thomas Zimmer, a
Georgetown University visiting professor, in his Democracy Americana
blog.</p>
<p>“We are in the process of the second American Revolution, which will
remain bloodless — if the left allows it to be,” said Heritage
Foundation President Kevin Roberts in a recent appearance on a
right-wing podcast, The War Room with Stephen K. Bannon.  </p>
<p>After Roberts’ incendiary comment, Trump tried to distance himself
from Project 2025, in a somewhat contradictory posting on his Truth
Social platform. He asserted that while he knew “nothing” about Project
2025 and its authors, “I disagree with some of the things they’re
saying.”</p>
<p>Many of those who wrote Project 2025’s chapters, however, were key
appointees in Trump’s administration. Some are reportedly assisting the
Trump re-election effort behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Several have also popped up in a recruitment video for Project 2025’s
online “Presidential Administration Academy,” which is recruiting and
training loyalists. The plan calls for restoring Schedule F, which
briefly existed at the end of the Trump administration, a classification
that made positions in the civil service more easily filled by loyalists
to the president.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of appointees could then fan out across government
agencies to implement far-right priorities, such as detaining and
deporting undocumented immigrants, dismantling social safety nets,
infusing Christian values and ethics into government policy, eliminating
LGBTQ+ rights, directing the Justice Department to prosecute anti-white
racism and banning pornography.</p>
<p>On reproductive rights, including abortion, Project 2025 outlines far
stricter restrictions than even Trump or the platform for next week’s
Republican National Convention is advocating.</p>
<p>The plan’s proponents characterize it as restoring “self-governance
to everyday Americans.” The project’s head, Paul Dans, appearing on
C-SPAN, left no doubt Trump’s words and ideas were the inspiration.</p>
<p>“He was president for four years, so many of the ideas are carry-ons
from his original work. So, I would like to think a lot of it does
spring from that first term of Trump,” Dans said.</p>
<p>‘Full Trumpian’ document</p>
<p>VOA requested an interview with the Heritage Foundation for this
story. The think tank said it could not make anyone available to discuss
Project 2025. It did email a statement stressing that Project 2025 does
not speak for any candidate, and that if Trump was re-elected, it would
be up to him to decide which recommendations to implement.</p>
<p>“It’s a full Trumpian sort of document with an angry and highly
polarizing tone” is how Progressive Policy Institute President Will
Marshall characterized Project 2025. </p>
<p>It seeks to eliminate the checks and balances that writers of the
Constitution, such as James Madison and Thomas Jefferson, guaranteed
through dividing power among the executive, legislative and judicial
branches of the government, according to Marshall. </p>
<p>“Madison and Jefferson ought to be spinning in their graves when they
see how much power they want to concentrate in the next president’s
hands. And if that president happens to be Donald Trump, then it’s a
kind of a nightmare for the country, given the way he’s misused power in
the past,” Marshall told VOA.</p>
<p>The sweeping document is in line with Trump’s stances. It calls for
placing big tariffs on imported goods and ending America’s “blind
support for international organizations.”</p>
<p>“That would really endanger our prosperity and undercut our
leadership and influence in the world,” Marshall said.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden’s reelection campaign has made Project 2025 a key
target.</p>
<p>“Trump’s advisers have created a 900-page blueprint — called Project
2025 — detailing everything else they plan to do in a second term,
including a plan to cut Social Security, repeal our $35 cap on insulin,
eliminate the Department of Education and end programs like Head Start
[which provides early education, health benefits and nutrition to
pre-school children],” Vice President Kamala Harris said during a
campaign appearance Tuesday at a Las Vegas hotel/casino. </p>
<p>The plan also calls for slashing government funding for renewable
energy and climate change mitigation. The Federal Bureau of
Investigation would be overhauled top to bottom, as would the U.S.
Agency for Global Media, which oversees the Voice of America. VOA, whose
news content is independent of higher government control, should —
according to Project 2025 — be supervised by either the National
Security Council or the State Department.</p>

id="judge-may-end-giulianis-bankruptcy-exposing-him-to-lawsuits">Judge
may end Giuliani’s bankruptcy, exposing him to lawsuits</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>new york — A U.S. judge on Wednesday said he would likely end
bankruptcy for Rudy Giuliani, a onetime lawyer for former President
Donald Trump. The move would enable lawsuits against Giuliani for
defamation, sexual harassment and other claims to proceed in other
courts.  </p>
<p>U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane said at a court hearing in White
Plains, New York, that he would rule Friday on competing requests from
Giuliani - who was New York City’s mayor from 1994 through 2001 - and
his creditors about the future of his bankruptcy.  </p>
<p>Giuliani, 80, filed for bankruptcy protection in December after a
Washington, D.C., court ordered him to pay $148 million to two Georgia
election workers that he falsely accused of rigging votes in the 2020
presidential election, which Democrat Joe Biden won.  </p>
<p>The bankruptcy prevented the election workers from collecting on that
judgment, while freezing other lawsuits stemming from Giuliani’s work
for Trump, as he sought to overturn his loss in the 2020 election. </p>
<p>Last week, Giuliani asked to convert his personal bankruptcy case
into a straightforward liquidation, which would force him to sell nearly
all of his assets. One group of creditors asked Lane to appoint a
trustee to take over Giuliani’s finances and businesses, which could
lead to a lengthy and contested bankruptcy liquidation, while another
group said Giuliani should be kicked out of bankruptcy altogether.  </p>
<p>All three options pose significant risks for Giuliani. </p>
<p>Lane said dismissal was likely the best option, given the
difficulties the court has had in getting straight answers from Giuliani
about his finances. A trustee would likely face the same problems
getting Giuliani’s cooperation, while incurring additional expenses that
would reduce Giuliani’s ability to pay creditors, Lane said.  </p>
<p>“I’m concerned that the difficulties we’ve encountered on
transparency will continue,” Lane said.  </p>
<p>A dismissal of his bankruptcy would allow Giuliani’s creditors to
resume lawsuits against him, but it would also give him more freedom to
appeal the $148 million defamation judgment that forced him to seek
bankruptcy protection.  </p>
<p>“We believe that the debtor’s best chance of getting an appellate
determination would be dismissal,” Giuliani attorney Gary Fischoff said
during Wednesday’s court hearing. </p>
<p>Lane previously stopped Giuliani from spending money on the appeal
while he was bankrupt, saying his Chapter 11 filing had paused
litigation on both sides.  </p>
<p>Rachel Strickland, representing the former Georgia election workers,
Wandrea “Shaye” Moss and her mother, Ruby Freeman, said Giuliani should
be kicked out of bankruptcy so her clients can try to collect on their
judgment against him.  </p>
<p>Giuliani “regards this court as a pause button on his woes while he
continues to live his life unbothered,” Strickland told Lane.  </p>
<p>Moss and Freeman, who are Black, faced a deluge of racist and sexist
messages, including threats of lynching, after Trump and his allies
spread false claims that they were engaged in vote fraud. </p>
<p>A committee representing Giuliani’s other creditors asked Lane to
instead appoint a trustee to take over Giuliani’s finances and
businesses, like his podcasting engagements and coffee promotions.
Committee attorney Phil Dublin said ending the bankruptcy now would
create a “race to the courthouse” among the many people who have sued
Giuliani.  </p>
<p>Giuliani’s other creditors include former employee Noelle Dunphy, who
has accused Giuliani of sexual assault and wage theft, and the voting
machine companies Dominion and Smartmatic, who have also sued Giuliani
for defamation. Giuliani has denied the allegations. </p>
<p>In addition to the civil lawsuits, Giuliani is facing criminal
charges in Georgia and Arizona for aiding Trump’s efforts to subvert the
2020 election results, and his false claims about the election have
caused him to lose his license to practice law in New York.</p>

<h2 id="biden-is-imperiling-a-tremendous-climate-legacy">Biden Is
Imperiling a Tremendous Climate Legacy</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-10, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjY3MDU1MC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1NzU2MTk2NH0.tp2abUjAHVHaMb8OzSG6zcZFkJ9inCNHc1rVMdZO5Kg/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Let’s start here: Joe Biden is losing the presidential election. He is
now roughly 2 points behind Donald Trump in national polls, according to
the FiveThirtyEight average. Though that may sound small, no Democrat
<a href="https://www.newsweek.com/joe-biden-polling-position-election-1922686" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has
been further behind</u></a> in the polls, at this point in the election,
since Al Gore in 2000.
</p>
<p>
Some of this collapse is due to fatigue with Democrats in general, part
of
<a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/06/06/world-elections-anti-incumbent-leaders-backlash" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
global wave</u></a> of anti-incumbent fervor. But at least some is
specific to Biden. In some swing state polls, a large gap has opened up
between Biden and the Democratic Senate candidate. Senator Tammy
Baldwin, for instance, is running
<a href="https://x.com/ec_schneider/status/1810676365835784347" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>12
points ahead</u></a> of Biden in Wisconsin, according to an AARP poll
released on Tuesday. Wisconsin is one of three key states that the
president must win to clinch re-election.
</p>
<p>
This is, obviously, a significant problem for Democrats. Senator Michael
Bennett, a Democrat of Colorado,
<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/4763266-michael-bennet-joe-biden-will-lose-cost-democrats-congress/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>believes
the party</u></a> is on track to lose control of the House and Senate in
addition to the presidency.
</p>
<p>
But it is a particular issue for those who believe the American economy
should decarbonize. Biden alone among candidates in the presidential
election has an impressive climate record: He fought for the passage of
— and subsequently signed — the Inflation Reduction Act, the largest
climate law in American history. For 30 years, Democrats had tried and
failed to pass comprehensive climate legislation through the U.S.
Senate; it finally happened under Biden’s watch.
</p>
<p>
The Biden administration has also used its considerable presidential
powers to lower carbon emissions: The Environmental Protection Agency
has proposed rules that would significantly cut heat-trapping pollution
from
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/epa-power-plant-rules-gas" target="_self"><u>power
plants</u></a>,

<p>
I don’t need to go over the litany of Trump’s environmental misdeeds,
but suffice it to say that during his time in office, Donald Trump
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/11/ideology-behind-donald-trumps-paris-withdrawal/601462/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>demonstrated
a distinct glee</u></a> in tearing up climate regulations and blocking
decarbonization. He withdrew America from the Paris Agreement, rolled
back the EPA’s climate rules, and deemed climate change a “hoax.” In his
second term, he again
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/republican-platform-heavy-on-energy-silent-on-climate/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>seeks
to overturn</u></a> the EPA’s new climate proposals, including
requirements that automakers sell more electric vehicles. The Heritage
Foundation’s
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-climate-change-project-2025" target="_self"><u>more
complete plans for a second Trump administration</u></a> — dubbed
Project 2025 — calls for closing dozens of government offices concerned
with climate change, ending energy efficiency standards, repealing the
IRA’s tax credits, and breaking up the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration.
</p>
<p>
Suffice it to say: Biden is the only serious candidate in the race who
wants to do something about climate change. He is<em><em> the</em></em>
climate candidate, and he has a climate record to run on. But Biden has
miserably failed to communicate any of these policy successes to the
masses. Nearly 60% of voters said they knew little or nothing about the
Inflation Reduction Act, according to the Heatmap Climate Poll,
conducted late last year. (A Yale and George Mason University survey
<a href="https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/climate-change-american-mind-politics-policy-fall-2023.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>found</u></a>
roughly similar results.)
</p>
<p>
You might think that reveals a canny strategy on the White House’s part:
Perhaps it knows the IRA is divisive, and so it is only bragging about
the law to the right audience. But polling shows Biden’s policies are
consistently failing to reach the very Americans who should have heard
about them — the subset of Americans who are worried about climate
change and want to see something done about it. Of Americans who believe
climate change is a “very important” issue, only 10% have heard or read
a lot about Biden’s climate policies, according to
<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/climate-policies-biden-poll/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>an
April CBS News/YouGov poll</u></a>. And nearly <em><em>half</em></em> of
Americans who rate climate change highly said that they have heard
nothing or “very little” about Biden’s efforts, according to the same
survey.
</p>
<p>
That is not the only poll to reach that conclusion. Another recent
survey, conducted by the Associated Press and the NORC Center for Public
Research,
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/america-ap-norc-poll-climate-change-election-f9943ab6a37674ef2345f4041618cf5e" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>found</u></a>
that nearly half of Americans were more concerned about climate change
this year than they were last year — but that barely any of that cohort
had heard about the IRA, and few thought the legislation would affect
their lives or mitigate climate change. Nearly half of the poll’s
respondents either didn’t know whether the IRA would help climate change
or thought it would make it <em><em>worse.</em></em> The IRA — and
Biden’s climate agenda more broadly — is failing to break through.
</p>
<p>
Now, I don’t labor under the impression that climate change is a
particularly potent or popular electoral issue. I’ve come to think that
climate, if not actively deleterious to Democrats, is at least an
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/climate-inflation-poll" target="_self"><u>electoral
sideshow</u></a> to the more enduring issues at the center of American
politics: the economy, interest rates, taxes, health care, and national
security. (Of course, climate change could vastly reshape the American
economy and the public’s health, but other, more immediate concerns —
such as employment, inflation, or abortion access — understandably
remain more front-of-mind for voters.)
</p>
<p>
But as a climate journalist, I’ve still found the past two years
perplexing. Why do so few people seem to understand the IRA’s goals? Why
has the Biden administration struggled so much to communicate the IRA’s
most popular aspect — namely, that it will reduce electricity costs (if
not inflation itself) for voters? Consider the bare political record
here: The Biden administration passed a law called the Inflation
Reduction Act, and <em><em>inflation
</em></em><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/inflation-just-fell-will-mortgage-rates-fall-now/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>subsequently
came down</em></em></u></a>. A more competent administration would be
all over that simplistic, but still potent, victory. So why don’t more
people seem to know about what Biden is doing? How is the federal
government doing so much on climate change and nobody — not even
climate-concerned Democrats — seem to care?
</p>
<p>
These questions have an easy answer: The candidate is not capable of
communicating these victories, so they are not breaking through. Biden,
in his diminished state, is not a skilled, crisp, or even very
decipherable communicator. As Ezra Klein
<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/ezra-klein-on-why-the-democratic-party-is-too-afraid-of-replacing-biden" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has
observed</u></a>, Biden is not generating the kind of memorable moments
or sterling speeches that Democrats can share among themselves. He is
barely speaking in complete sentences. In today’s fragmented media
landscape, where first-person accounts and viral videos can go much
further than news stories or wonky analysis, the candidate must be the
chief champion of his or her victories. Judging from Biden’s disastrous
performance at the first presidential debate — and his relative lack of
<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-dismisses-concerns-mental-fitness-hed-drop-lord/story?id=111695174" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>lengthy,
unscripted public appearances</u></a> since then, and
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/10/opinion/joe-biden-democratic-nominee.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
account</u></a> of those who have interacted with him — he seemingly
cannot meet that standard.
</p>
<p>
Biden’s tremendous climate legacy rests on whether he can sell his
accomplishments to the public and win the 2024 election. And that
ability is faltering, to say the least.

<h2 id="death-valley-park-rangers-dont-mess-with-the-heat">Death Valley
Park Rangers Don’t Mess With the Heat</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-10, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjY2NzU5Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczMjIzODczOX0.OpMJWizdQwYPvJ3WwHYmk9Md2tPq_56nCE6394hBgsA/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Driving through
<a href="https://www.nps.gov/deva/index.htm" target="_blank">Death
Valley National Park</a>, tourists pass three different extreme heat
warnings. Beyond the standard brown “caution” signs and the ones
prohibiting hiking after 10 a.m., visitors encounter a more makeshift
one warning that helicopters and other rescue options might not be
available when the temperature is above 115 Fahrenheit — when it gets
that hot, the air is simply too thin to support a chopper.
</p>
<p>
It’s the last sign that seems to catch people’s attention the most, park
ranger Abby Wines told me.
</p>
<p>
On the 111th anniversary of the world record for highest temperature
ever recorded — 134 mind-boggling degrees — news outlets have been
reporting on the tourists flocking to experience the hottest place on
Earth. At the same time, meteorologists have also
<a href="https://www.accuweather.com/en/us/death-valley/92384/weather-forecast/2258469" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>warned</u></a>
that Death Valley could come close to matching that record, with
temperatures up to 129 degrees. According to Wines, the
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/us-heat-wave-dangerous-temperatures-e1b875ae9d6e72afd179061e34153f8e" target="_blank">number
of tourists</a> this summer is a return to the park’s pre-pandemic
numbers: Over 150,000 visited the park in May 2019; this year, that
number was around 140,000.
</p>
<p>
While Death Valley is busy year-round, tensions run higher for park
workers during the summer when extreme temperatures limit much of their
work. And, for the 100 National Park Service employees working there in
the summer, taking care of tourists is not always their top priority.
“We will rescue who we can,” Wines said, “as long as we can do it safely
without losing a coworker.”
</p>
<p>
“We have 100 people and we’re running an entire community,” she
explained. “All the structure that a small town would have, providing
all the emergency services, maintaining the roads, maintaining the
buildings, and the park is the size of Connecticut.”
</p>
<p>
The park’s weather, on the other hand, is not at all like Connecticut’s.
And climate change is making it worse. Death Valley is currently tied
for the fourth longest streak of consecutive days above 125 degrees,
with more days to come. Overnight lows also seem to be getting warmer,
consistently hitting the high 90s. A couple of years ago, Wines
remembers an overnight low of 106. “And that overnight low is not at
midnight — it’s right before the sunrise,” she said.
</p>
<p>
Always, but especially during the summer, any work in the park is
extremely dangerous. Beyond routine tasks — for example, keeping toilets
at the trailheads clean — park workers also need to monitor the park’s
60-year-old infrastructure. “When a water main breaks in the middle of
the summer, we have to fix that, because that’s what we need to survive
here is drinking water,” Wines told me, “so that’s where we really put
our staff at the most risk of working in heat.”
</p>
<p>
Park employees carry a work/rest schedule which lays out how many
minutes they should work before resting according to different
temperature ranges. When temperatures are above 115 degrees, they are
only allowed to do moderate work for 10 minutes, before cooling down in
an air-conditioned space for an hour. When working on the trails,
vehicles must be idling the whole time so that there’s immediate AC for
workers to come back to.<br/>
</p>
<p>
In September 2013, one of Wines’ colleagues died after getting a flat
tire while repairing a road in the park, Wines told me. The park largely
lacks cell phone service, so it took staff until evening to find the
missing ranger. The high that day was 107 degrees, not even close to how
hot the park can get in the summer, she said.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>I asked Wines about how she and her fellow rangers deal
with the stress associated with their jobs on a daily basis. She paused
for a long second.
</p>
<p>
“I say we’re used to it,” she replied. “But I would also say that
honestly, there’s always a tension between work that needs to happen and
keeping people safe.” While people might try to push themselves to get a
job done, Wines said the most important thing is trying to not become
inured to just how deadly heat can be. That is the same advice Wines
tries to convey to tourists.
</p>
<p>
On Saturday, a group of
<a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-07-07/motorcyclist-dies-death-valley-128-degrees" target="_blank">six
German tourists</a> motorcycling through the park needed assistance in
the extreme heat. According to Wines, four of them required immediate
help, but with the thermometer at 128 degrees,
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/07/10/excessive-heat-helicopter-emergency/" target="_blank">no
helicopters could fly in</a>. Because the park only has two ambulances
available, the rangers had to call in help from Pahrump and Shoshone,
each over 60 miles away. One of the riders died and another was
hospitalized.
</p>
<p>
“Being a local to Las Vegas for 26 years and an avid outdoors
enthusiast, I think it is foolish to visit Death Valley during the peak
temperatures of the day,” Brian Delaney told me. Delaney is one of the
owners of Mojave Wave, a small tourism company in Las Vegas that offers
tours to Death Valley. To keep employees and passengers safe, they leave
either early in the day or after dark. “We are a very small operation,
and the two of us who take groups on tours to Death Valley are very
prepared for the worst. We focus on maintaining our equipment, not
taking chances and keeping a keen eye on our guests as well as others in
the park.”
</p>
<p>
Yet, in Delaney’s experience, many tourists still prefer to take their
chances to experience peak temperatures. “Many of the visitors are
self-drivers and do not enlist our professional services,” he told me.
</p>
<p>
While educating tourists is never easy — and can add an extra strain to
already overwhelmed workers — Wines told me closing the park during the
summer is not an option. Of the 57 entrances to the park, 55 are unpaved
roads. That means that visitors could easily drive around any type of
blockage. A closed park would also mean fewer employees, which would
make it even more difficult for rescue crews to be deployed. “We’d
always be creating a less safe environment for those people that would
violate the closure,” she said.

id="amigakit-launches-a-new-amiga-thats-not-an-amiga-at-all">AmigaKit
launches a new Amiga that’s not an Amiga at all</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>I try to keep tabs on a huge number of operating system projects out
there – for obvious reasons – but long ago I learned that when it comes
to the world of Amiga, it’s best to maintain distance and let any
important news find its way out of the Amiga bubble, lest one loses
their sanity. Keeping up with the Amiga world requires following every
nook and cranny of various forums and websites with different
allegiances to different (shell) companies, with often barely coherent
screeching and arguments literally nobody cares about. It’s a mess is
what I’m trying to say. Anyway, it seems one of the many small companies
still somehow making a living in the Amiga world, AmigaKit, has recently
released a new device, the A600GS. It’s a retrogaming-oriented Amiga
computer, but it does come with something called AmiBench, that’s
apparently a weird hybrid between bits of Amiga OS 4 and AROS, so it
does also support running a proper desktop and associated applications,
but only AmigaOS 3.x applications (I think? It’s a bit unclear). It has
HDMI at up to 1080p, and even WiFi and Bluetooth support, which is
pretty neat. Wait, Wifi and Bluetooth support? What are we really
dealing with here? Once again the information is hard to find because
AmigaKit is incredibly stingy with specifications – I had to read
goddamn YouTube comments to get some hints – but it seems to be a custom
board with an Orange Pi Zero 3 stuck on top doing most of the work. In
other words, the meat of this thing is just an emulator, which in and of
itself isn’t a bad thing, it’s just weird to me that they’re not upfront
and direct about this. While this answers some questions, it also raises
a whole bunch more. If this is running on low-end Allwinner ARM hardware
from 2022, how is this AmiBench desktop environment (or operating
system?) a “fork of OS4 with AROS code in it“? AmigaOS 4 is
PowerPC-only, which may explain why AmigaKit only mentions AmigaOS 3.x
and 68K compatibility, and not AmigaOS 4 compatibility. And what’s AROS
doing in there? I mean, this is an interesting product in the sense that
it’s a relatively cheap turnkey solution for classic Amiga enthusiasts,
but a new Amiga this is definitely not. At about €130, this is not a bad
deal, but other than hardcore fans of the classic 68K Amiga, I don’t see
many people being interested in this. The Apollo Standalone V4+ piques
my interest way more, but at €700-800, it’s also a lot more expensive,
but at least they’re much clearer about what the Apollo is, what
software it’s running, and that they’re giving back their work to
AROS.</p>

id="in-rust-trial-alec-baldwin-accused-of-breaking-gun-rules-defense-blames-experts">In
‘Rust’ trial, Alec Baldwin accused of breaking gun rules; defense blames
experts</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SANTA FE, New Mexico — A New Mexico prosecutor on Wednesday said Alec
Baldwin broke “cardinal rules” of gun safety in the 2021 killing of
“Rust” cinematographer Halyna Hutchins while his lawyer said he was
failed by firearms experts. </p>
<p>The 66-year-old Baldwin, on trial in Hollywood’s first on-set
shooting fatality in three decades, took notes at the defense table and
listened calmly to opening statements in his involuntary manslaughter
trial. The trial is largely unprecedented in U.S. history, holding an
actor criminally responsible for a gun death during filming. </p>
<p>A New Mexico jury of 12 and four alternates — 11 women and five men —
heard prosecutor Erlinda Johnson outline arguments that Baldwin
disregarded safety during filming of the low-budget movie before
pointing a gun at Hutchins during a rehearsal, cocking it and pulling
the trigger as they set up a camera shot on a set southwest of Santa
Fe. </p>
<p>“The evidence will show that someone who played make believe with a
real gun and violated the cardinal rules of firearm safety is the
defendant, Alexander Baldwin,” Johnson said. </p>
<p>Baldwin’s wife Hilaria Baldwin sat in the second row of the public
gallery, his brother Stephen Baldwin in front of her. </p>
<p>His lawyer Alex Spiro pointed to “Rust” armorer Hannah Gutierrez —
head of gun safety — and first assistant director Dave Halls —
responsible for overall set safety. Both have been convicted in the
shooting, and Spiro said they did not check the rounds in the gun to
ensure it was safe for Baldwin to use.  </p>
<p>“There were people responsible for firearms safety but actor Alec
Baldwin committed no crime,” said Spiro. </p>
<p>Hutchins was killed, and director Joel Souza wounded when Baldwin’s
reproduction 1873 Single Action Army revolver fired a live round,
inadvertently loaded by Gutierrez. </p>
<p>Since a police interview on Oct. 21, 2021, the day of the shooting,
Baldwin has argued the gun just “went off.”  </p>
<p>In an ABC News interview two months later, Baldwin told George
Stephanopoulos he did not pull the trigger. A 2022 FBI test found the
gun was in normal working condition and would not fire from full cock
without the trigger being pulled. </p>
<p>Spiro said during his opening arguments that no one saw Baldwin
“intentionally pull the trigger,” but that it was the responsibility of
firearms safety experts to ensure a firearm was safe for an actor “to
wave it, to point it, to pull the trigger, like actors do.”  </p>
<p>State prosecutors charged Baldwin with involuntary manslaughter in
January 2022. They dropped charges three months later after Baldwin’s
lawyers presented photographic evidence the gun was modified, arguing it
would fire more easily, bolstering the actor’s accidental discharge
argument. </p>
<p>Prosecutors called a grand jury to reinstate the charge in January
after an independent firearms expert confirmed the 2022 FBI study. </p>
<p>FBI testing broke the gun, and Baldwin’s lawyers will tell jurors
that destruction of the weapon prevented them from proving the gun was
modified. </p>
<p>Armorer Gutierrez, whose job on the set of “Rust” included managing
firearms safely, was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in March for
loading the live round.</p>
<p>Prosecutors will have to persuade jurors Baldwin is also guilty of
willful and reckless criminal negligence.</p>

confident Boeing space capsule can safely return to Earth</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida — Two astronauts who should have been back on
Earth weeks ago said Wednesday that they’re confident that Boeing’s
space capsule can return them safely, despite breakdowns.</p>
<p>NASA test pilots Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams launched aboard
Boeing’s new Starliner capsule early last month, the first people to
ride it. Leaks and thruster failures almost derailed their arrival at
the International Space Station and have kept them there much longer
than planned.</p>
<p>In their first news conference from orbit, they said they expect to
return once thruster testing is complete on Earth. They said they’re not
complaining about getting extra time in orbit and are enjoying helping
the station crew.</p>
<p>“I have a real good feeling in my heart that the spacecraft will
bring us home, no problem,” Williams told reporters.</p>
<p>The two rocketed into orbit on June 5 on the test flight, which was
originally supposed to last eight days.</p>
<p>NASA ordered the Starliner and SpaceX Dragon capsules a decade ago
for astronaut flights to and from the space station, paying each company
billions of dollars. SpaceX’s first taxi flight with astronauts was in
2020. Boeing’s first crew flight was repeatedly delayed because of
software and other issues.</p>

id="i-fixed-a-6-year-old-.deb-installation-bug-in-ubuntu-mate-and-xubuntu">“I
fixed a 6-year-old .deb installation bug in Ubuntu MATE and
Xubuntu”</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>I love a good bug hunting story, and this one is right up there as a
great one. Way back in 2018, Doug Brown discovered that after installing
Ubuntu MATE 18.04, if he launched Firefox from the icon in the default
panel arrangement to install Chrome from the official Chrome website,
the process was broken. After downloading the .deb and double-clicking
it, GDebi would appear, but after clicking “Install”, nothing happened.
What was supposed to happen is that after clicking “Install”, an
authentication dialog should appear where you enter your root password,
courtesy of gksu. However, this dialog did not appear, and without
thinking too much of it, Brown shrugged and just installed the
downloaded Chrome .deb through the terminal, which worked just fine.
While he didn’t look any deeper into the cause of the issue, he did note
that as the years and new Ubuntu releases progressed, the bug would
still be there, all the way up until the most recent release. Finally,
2.5 years ago, he decided to dive into the bug. It turned out there were
lots of reports about this issue, but nobody stepped up to fix it. While
workarounds were made available through wrapper scripts, and deeper
investigations into the cause revealed helpful information. The actual
error message was a doozy: “Refusing to render service to dead parents”,
which is quite metal and a little disturbing. In summary, the problem
was that GDebi was using execv() to replace itself with an instance of
pkexec, which was intended to bring up an authentication dialog and then
allow GDebi to run as a superuser. pkexec didn’t like this arrangement,
because it wants to have a parent process other than init. Alkis
mentioned that you could recreate the problematic scenario in a terminal
window by running gdebi-gtk with setsid to run it in a new session. ↫
Doug Brown Backing up a few steps, if the name “gksu” rings a bell for
you, you might have already figured out where the problem most likely
originated from. Right around that time, 2018, Ubuntu switched to using
PolicyKit instead, and gksu was removed from Ubuntu. GDebi was patched
to work with PolicyKit instead, and this was what introduced the actual
bug. Sadly, despite having a clear idea of the origin of the bug, as
well as where to look to actually fix it, nobody picked it up. It sat
there for years, causing problems for users, without a fix in sight.
Brown was motivated enough to fix it, submitted the patch, but after
receiving word it would be looked at within a few days, he never heard
anything back for years, not helped by the fact that GDebi has long been
unmaintained. It wasn’t until very recently that he decided to go back
again, and this time, after filling out additional information required
for a patch for an unmaintained package, it was picked up, and will
become available in the next Ubuntu release (and will most likely be
backported, too). Brown further explains why it took so long for the bug
to be definitely fixed. Not only is GDebi unmaintained, the bug also
only manifested itself when launching Firefox from the panel icon – it
did not manifest when launching Firefox from the MATE menu, so a lot of
people never experienced it. On top of that, as we all sadly know,
Ubuntu replaced the Firefox .deb package with the SNAP version, which
also doesn’t trigger the bug. It’s a long story for sure, but a very
interesting one. It shows how sometimes, the stars just align to make
sure a bug does not get fixed, even if everyone involved knows how to
fix it, and even if fixes have been submitted. Sometimes, things just
compound to cause a bug to fall through the cracks.</p>

<p>
It’s more than a little painful to see new open source businesses
re-learn what I and other open source founders have learned over time.
</p>
<p>
I’m fully in support of Plausible moving to AGPL and introducing a
Contributor License Agreement, but I don’t believe this will be enough.
Indeed, Plausible is moving to “open core” and privatizing some of the
more lucrative features:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“We’re also keeping some of the newly released business and enterprise
features (funnels and ecommerce revenue metrics at the time of being)
exclusive to the business plan subscribers on our Plausible Analytics
managed hosting.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
What’s particularly interesting to me is that they’re maintaining source
availability for these features - it’s just that they’re not going to be
released under an open source license.
</p>
<p>
Open source purists might complain, but I believe it’s better for the
project to exist at all and use licensing that allows for sustainability
rather than to maintain open source purity and find that the developers
can’t sustain themselves. I’d love for these things to be compatible,
but so far, I don’t believe that they are.

exacerbated by climate change. The federal flood risk management
standard, first proposed in 2015, will require public structures funded
by FEMA be built above the projected flood level for their location, or
be moved to a different location entirely. The hope is to “put a stop to
the cycle of response and recovery, and rinse and repeat,”

Frustration is growing in Texas, where nearly 2 million people are still

access to air conditioning as a heat wave pushes temperatures into the

age 89. Inhofe served five terms in the Senate starting in the 1990s
before retiring in January last year. He began vocally downplaying
scientific evidence of climate change in 2003. His campaigns received
generous donations from fossil fuel interests. In 2012, Inhofe authored
a book called <em><em>The Greatest Hoax: How the Global Warming
Conspiracy Threatens Your Future</em></em>. In a 2015 stunt, he brought
a snowball into the Senate in an attempt to prove that man-made global
warming was not real. He opposed efforts to cap greenhouse gas emissions
and once called the Environmental Protection Agency a “Gestapo
bureaucracy.” He later went on to play a key role in transforming the
EPA under former President Trump.

about survival’: Athens mayor focuses on getting capital through extreme
heat</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-10, from: Ben Werdmuller’s blog</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div class=&quot;known-bookmark&quot;&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;e-content&quot;&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
[<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/10/athens-mayor-extreme-heat-greece">Helene
Smith at The Guardian</a>]
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“Barely six months into the job, the mayor of Athens’s top priority is
simple: ensuring that the people of Greece’s capital – mainland Europe’s
hottest metropolis – survive the summer. After a June that was the
hottest on record, the city has already witnessed record-breaking
temperatures and wildfires.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
We’re deeply into the climate crisis at this point; a major city having
to make major changes in order to “survive the summer” is just another
example.
</p>
<p>
When you get into the detail, it’s terrifying - particularly considering
that we’re still only at the foothills of where the crisis will lead us:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“It’s not a matter of lifestyle, or improving the quality of life; it’s
about survival when 23% of the green lung around Athens has in recent
years been destroyed by fires. It’s vital we have more trees, more
air-conditioned community centres and more water stations on our streets
and squares.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Over time, we’re going to see mass migrations and real, sustained
changes to the way people live. We’re also going to see a great deal of
suffering. These are things we’ve been warned about for many decades,
but the stories are transitioning from projections from climate experts
to being the news headlines.
</p>
<p>
The onus is on the international community to respond to the crisis with
robust energy, but we’ve been waiting for decades for this to really
happen. Instead we get carbon trading schemes and economic deals that
don’t cut to the core of the problem.
</p>
<p>
There’s an individual responsibility, too. These days that
responsibility goes beyond making sensible choices about our own energy
use (although most of us don’t) and extends to voting, taking to the
streets, and making it clear to our leaders that continued inaction is
not acceptable.
</p>
<p>
If there isn’t change, wars will be fought over this. In a certain
light, they already are.

<blockquote>
<p>
“Newsletter platform and Substack rival Ghost announced earlier this
year that it would join the fediverse, the open social network of
interconnected servers that includes apps like Mastodon, Pixelfed,
PeerTube, Flipboard and, more recently, Instagram Threads, among others.
Now, it has made good on that promise — with its own newsletter as a
start.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I’m certain that this is a large part of the future of how information
will be disseminated on the internet - and how publishers will run
subscription programs. Subscribers who use the fediverse see the benefit
of rich content that they can reshare and comment on; publishers
<a href="https://werd.io/2024/the-fediverse-for-media-organizations">get
to understand a lot more about their subscribers than they would from
the web or email newsletters</a>.
</p>
<p>
Ghost’s reader will certainly be augmented by other, standalone readers
that work a bit like Apple News. Its fediverse publishing capabilities
will be followed by other content management systems. Notably,
Automattic has been working on fediverse integration, for example, and
Flipboard has been doing amazing work in this area.
</p>
<p>
I’m also convinced there’s room for another fediverse-compatible social
network that handles both long and short-form content in a similar way
to Substack’s articles and Notes. If someone else doesn’t build that, I
will.

<blockquote>
<p>
“Voucher advocates, backed by a handful of billionaire funders, are on
the march to bring more red and purple states into the fold for “school
choice,” their preferred terminology for vouchers. And again and again,
they are running up against rural Republicans like Warner, who are
joining forces with Democratic lawmakers in a rare bipartisan alliance.
That is, it’s the reddest regions of these red and purple states that
are putting up some of the strongest resistance to the conservative
assault on public schools.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is heartening to see: a bipartisan push against the school voucher
system. Public schools are important social infrastructure that deserve
significantly more investment rather than having funds siphoned away to
support exclusive institutions. A free market for schools is not the way
- and clearly, the communities who would be most affected by a voucher
system see this too.
</p>
<p>
This also feels like one of those rare moments where some Republicans
are actively practicing old-school conservatism: the kind that isn’t
drawn from <em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em>. That’s nice to see, and I’d
love to see more of it.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“[Republican Representative] Greene believes vouchers will harm his
district. It has a couple of small private schools in it or just outside
it — with student bodies that are starkly more white than the district’s
public schools — but the majority of his constituents rely on the public
schools, and he worries that vouchers will leave less money for them.”
</p>

<p>
Exactly. Not to mention a worse education.

<p class="drop-caps">
When Adam Roe hits the accelerator and sends his vintage Land Rover
flying past a Porsche, he likes to imagine what the other driver must be
thinking.
</p>
<p>
While Roe’s ride looks the part of a restored Land Rover Series II, an
off-roading, unbreakable icon from the late 1950s, the secret is what’s
under the skin. Whereas the original bruiser produced about 45 total
horsepower, Roe says, the “restomod” created by his company, ZeroLabs,
is a fully electric vehicle with 600 horses — more than enough to catch
a sports car by surprise.
</p>
<p>
Being a classic car enthusiast doesn’t have to mean burning fossil fuels
anymore. ZeroLabs is part of a small but growing community of startup
companies and DIYers who are transforming some of the most beloved
vehicles of automotive history into zero-emissions EVs. The next time
you see a beautifully restored boxy Chevy Blazer rolling down the
highway, it might just be battery-powered.
</p>
<p class="drop-caps">
Patrick Mackey has been turning vintage Mazda Miatas into electric cars
for more than a decade. Back in the 2000s, he wanted a fun but fully
electric car like the original Tesla Roadster, but couldn’t afford what
Elon Musk was asking. When he looked around at the kind of cars the
DIY-inclined were hacking into EVs, he thought about small rides like
the Toyota Yaris and Honda De La Soul. But it was the classic Miata —
derided by muscle-heads as too wimpy, but beloved by car enthusiasts who
recognize its compact greatness — that became the obvious choice.
</p>
<p>
“The Miatas have a great reputation for handling,” Mackey says. “They
sold a ton of ’em, so there’s a lot of ’em out there and you can get one
for a reasonable price.” Despite its small stature, the Miata was a
sturdy car, with thick frame rails that are strong enough to hold a
hefty EV battery back. (Mazda itself won’t be selling you an
<a href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/2026-mazda-mx-5-miata-electrified-future-cars/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>electric
Miata</u></a> until 2026, by the way.)
</p>
<p>
Initially, Mackey and his colleagues considered building their own EV
conversions and selling them directly to people, like ZeroLabs does, or
making kits to sell that would contain all the parts a person would need
to turn a gas-powered Miata into an electric one. But the steel parts
weighed a ton and wouldn’t fit inside one another for shipping,
rendering the idea impractical.
</p>
<p>
Instead, Mackey’s
<a href="https://ev-miata.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>EV
Miata</u></a> website offers all the plans and fabrication documents a
home mechanic would need to take on the job. It’s up to the builder to
source the off-the-shelf electrical components to do the job, or,
perhaps, to salvage them from a wrecked EV as many DIYers do now, he
says.
</p>
<p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image image-crop-3x2">

</p>
<p>
A surprising amount of the original Miata parts can survive the
transformation. “You would keep the transmission and everything behind
it, so that part of the powertrain you keep. You’d replace the motor
with an adapter plate to connect the motor up to it. Then there’s the
battery pack and the controller and all those E components come into
play. But in that case, the majority of the car is there. If you are
going racing, or you’re looking for something with higher performance,
you could remove the transmission and then do a direct drive and have
two or three motors that are driving the rear wheels.” Or, he says, some
people are doing what’s called a stack replacement. They get a Nissan
Leaf’s entire subframe, containing the axles and transmission and
motors, and swap that into their EV conversion so it’s running on all
Leaf parts.
</p>
<p class="drop-caps">
Car restoration has always been a money pit of a hobby. EV conversion is
no different — you do it for love, not because it’s cheaper than just
buying an electric car. Mackey says the EV Miata project probably costs
about $22,000 now, not counting the cost of buying an old Mazda nor the
sweat equity required to build it.
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, plenty of people with the proper mechanical chops take on
the challenge. At Caltech, where I work (and where lots of people are
electrical engineers), there’s a vintage Porsche often plugged in next
to me that was clearly hacked into an electric. With enough cash, you
could buy a
<a href="https://www.evwest.com/catalog/index.php?cPath=40" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>kit</u></a>
to convert just about any classic car into an EV.
</p>
<p>
And the DIY EV is just one end of the spectrum. On the far side lies
fully realized conversions like those by ZeroLabs, which specializes in
not just electrifying, but modernizing Ford Broncos and other beloved
SUVs of yore.

<p>
“A restoration is to say, hey, we’re going to put this back to the
original condition exactly as it would’ve been, which means no
Bluetooth, no three-point seat belts. You got to use radial tires, you
got to put on whitewalls. You got to use period-correct paint and AM
radio and [an] ashtray. That’s a restoration. That’s not what we’re
doing.”
</p>
<p>
Roe was inspired by a backcountry snowboarding trip when the engine on
his old Bronco cut out, a problem that plagued the old SUVs. As it
coasted silently, he fell in love with the idea of a classic car without
all the noise. “You could hear the winds, you could hear the tires,
you’re in your classic, but you’re also kind of with nature versus being
hidden by this loud rumbly loud noise engine with your stereo,” he says.
</p>
<p>
In place of their original bare-bones interiors, ZeroLab’s reimagined EV
trucks and SUVs have all the tech features of a modern vehicle. “We
looked at everything that needs to be done for a modern car: How do we
think about steering, how do we think about brakes, communication,
upgradeability, and charging rates? All of that has changed, and so
simply electrifying that car isn’t really enough.”
</p>
<p>
Their creations aren’t for the faint of wallet. The fully realized
ZeroLabs first-generation
<a href="https://www.zerolabs.com/bronco" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Bronco</u></a>
starts at nearly $300,000. But it seems there are plenty of wealthy
buyers looking for a boxy, retro, or just plain eccentric electric car
that doesn’t look anything like the production EVs now rolling off the
assembly line. Roe exudes optimism that EV restomods will have their
Tesla moment within the next couple of years — and the EVs that are old
on the outside and new on the inside will be the next big thing.

summer episode of Shift Key.</em>
</p>
<p class="drop-caps">
Over the past few weeks, the U.S. Supreme Court has profoundly changed
how the federal government does its day-to-day work. In a series of
landmark rulings, the high court sharply curtailed the ability of
government agencies — including the Environmental Protection Agency — to
write and enforce rules and regulations.
</p>
<p>
That will change how the federal government oversees the products we
buy, the air we breathe, and the water we drink. But it could also alter
how the government regulates heat-trapping greenhouse gas pollution.
</p>
<p>
But how, exactly, will these new rulings affect climate law? And is
there an upside to the deregulatory revolution? This week, Rob holds a
roundtable with two environmental law experts about what the high
court’s rulings mean for America’s decarbonization project — and whether
the court just inadvertently made the country’s already burdensome
permitting process even worse. They are Jody Freeman, a Harvard law
professor and former Obama administration lawyer, and Nicholas Bagley, a
University of Michigan law professor.

Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Nicholas Bagley:</strong> I was working at the court and working
for Justice Stevens when <em><em>Massachusetts v. EPA</em></em> was
decided, and you know, even at the time, the level of frustration and
even anger from the conservative justices — it was a 5-4 decision — was
pretty intense. And since that time, of course, the conservatives have
really consolidated their authority on the court.<br/> <br/> And there
are a lot of cases after <em><em>Mass v. EPA</em></em> that accept the
principle that EPA can regulate greenhouse gases while still finding
ways to push back on agency efforts to do so. And so, is <em><em>Mass v.
EPA</em></em> going to be overruled? Well, the court doesn’t tend to
like to overrule statutory holdings. Once the Supreme Court has said
<em><em>statute means X</em></em>, it gives that determination a very
high degree of precedential effect, even more so than in the
constitutional context. The theory is that if Congress doesn’t like what
we said, Congress can always fix it. In the constitutional context, we
actually have to be a little bit more flexible because Congress can’t
just fix any mistakes that we might make. So there’s a kind of super
<em><em>stare decisis</em></em>, is what they call it, a super
precedential effect of that decision.<br/> <br/> And so far, the court
hasn’t decided to kind of go after that interpretation, and I’m not sure
they will. And I’m not sure they need to [with] all of these different
doctrinal outs that they’ve got: the major questions doctrine,
<em><em>we’re going to interpret your statute differently</em></em>,
<em><em>we’re going to strike it down on arbitrary and capricious
grounds</em></em>, it gives them all the tools they need to push back on
EPA without actually taking the big, bold, and splashy step of
overruling <em><em>Mass v. EPA</em></em>.<br/> <br/> <strong>Jody
Freeman: </strong>You can see all these cases as revenge for
<em><em>Mass v. EPA</em></em>, a sort of reaction to <em><em>Mass v.
EPA</em></em> in a funny way. I mean, to be sure, if the court currently
constituted were to have to rule on that case, they would never have
decided that the Clean Air Act authorizes regulation of greenhouse gas.
So they’re fighting a rearguard action in all the ways Nick
suggested.<br/> <br/> This Supreme Court appears to be, as one scholar
said, a sort of anti-novelty court. That is, agencies shouldn’t do new
things, Congress should have to pass new statutes for that to happen.
And it’s a really disabling notion because Congress passes broad
statutes that say things like “protect the public health with an
adequate margin of safety.” They give the agency broad authority to,
say, protect workers against grave dangers in the workplace without
necessarily defining what “grave danger” could mean, or what “public
health protection” could mean, because they expect the agencies to
develop their view over time, depending on what science says and what
technology makes available and so on. <br/> <br/> And this court seems
to be opposed to evolution, right? To progress and letting agencies
adapt over time. And in that sense, I think they’re a kind of small-C
conservative court, in the sense that change is bad, and certainly
regulatory change is bad unless Congress itself authorizes agencies anew
to do something. And that, in and of itself, is, if not anti-regulatory,
it’s hostile to any kind of innovation or adaptation by the federal
bureaucracy.

pier will be put back in Gaza for several days to move aid, then
permanently removed</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The pier built by the U.S. military to bring
humanitarian aid to Gaza will be reinstalled Wednesday to be used for
several days, but then the plan is to pull it out permanently, several
U.S. officials said. It would deal the final blow to a project long
plagued by bad weather, security uncertainties and difficulties getting
food into the hands of starving Palestinians.</p>
<p>The officials said the goal is to clear whatever aid has piled up in
Cyprus and on the floating dock offshore and get it to the secure area
on the beach in Gaza. Once that has been done, the Army will dismantle
the pier and depart. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity
because final details are still being worked out.</p>
<p>Officials had hoped the pier would provide a critical flow of aid to
starving residents in Gaza as the nine-month-long war drags on. But
while more than 8.6 million kilograms of food has gotten into Gaza via
the pier, the project has been hampered by persistent heavy seas and
stalled deliveries due to ongoing security threats as Israeli troops
continue their offensive against Hamas in Gaza.</p>
<p>The decision comes as Israeli troops make another push deeper into
Gaza City, which Hamas says could threaten long-running negotiations
over a cease-fire and hostage release, after the two sides had appeared
to have narrowed the gaps in recent days.</p>
<p>U.S. troops removed the pier on June 28 because of bad weather and
moved it to the port of Ashdod in Israel. But distribution of the aid
had already stopped due to security concerns.</p>
<p>The United Nations suspended deliveries from the pier on June 9, a
day after the Israeli military used the area around it for airlifts
after a hostage rescue that killed more than 270 Palestinians. U.S. and
Israeli officials said no part of the pier itself was used in the raid,
but U.N. officials said any perception in Gaza that the project was used
may endanger their aid work.</p>
<p>As a result, aid brought through the pier into the secure area on the
beach piled up for days while talks continued between the U.N. and
Israel. More recently, the World Food Program hired a contractor to move
the aid from the beach to prevent the food and other supplies from
spoiling.</p>
<p>The Pentagon said all along that the pier was only a temporary
project, designed to prod Israel into opening and allowing aid to flow
better through land routes — which are far more productive than the
U.S.-led sea route.</p>
<p>And the weather now is projected only to get worse.</p>
<p>The pier was damaged by high winds and heavy seas on May 25, just a
bit more than a week after it began operating, and was removed for
repairs. It was reconnected on June 7, but removed again due to bad
weather on June 14. It was put back days later, but heavy seas again
forced its removal on June 28.</p>

judge’s security shoots man during attempted carjacking, say
authorities</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — A member of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor’s
security detail shot an armed man during an attempted carjacking in the
early morning hours, according to court documents. </p>
<p>It happened as two deputy U.S. Marshals were on duty in a government
car in Washington about 1 a.m. on July 5. They were confronted by a man
who got out of a silver minivan and pointed a gun at one of them through
the driver’s side window, according to a criminal complaint. The car was
unmarked, but the pair were dressed in U.S. Marshals shirts. </p>
<p>The deputy pulled out his department-issued gun and shot the man
about four times, hitting him in the mouth. He then gave the man first
aid while the minivan drove away, charges state. The suspect was
hospitalized and placed under arrest on suspicion of attempted
carjacking and resisting officers. </p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the U.S. Marshals confirmed the deputies were part
of the detail protecting Supreme Court justices. The deputies were
stationed near Sotomayor’s home.   </p>
<p>Sotomayor was not directly mentioned in court documents and there is
no indication she was the target of the attack.   </p>
<p>It comes after a string of high-profile carjackings in the nation’s
capital last year. Other victims included a diplomat from the United
Arab Emirates and U.S. Representative Henry Cuellar of Texas. Secret
Service agents protecting President Joe Biden’s granddaughter also
opened fire after three people tried to break into an unmarked Secret
Service vehicle last year. No one was struck. </p>
<p>The overall number of carjackings is on the decline so far this year,
according to police data.</p>

election meddlers hurting Biden, helping Trump, US intelligence
warns</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Russia is turning to a familiar playbook in its attempt
to sway the outcome of the upcoming U.S. presidential election, looking
for ways to boost the candidacy of former President Donald Trump by
disparaging the campaign of incumbent President Joe Biden, according to
American intelligence officials. </p>
<p>A new assessment of threats to the November election, shared Tuesday,
does not mention either candidate by name. But an intelligence official
told reporters that the Kremlin view of the U.S. political landscape has
not changed from previous election cycles.</p>
<p>“We have not observed a shift in Russia’s preferences for the
presidential race from past elections,” the official told reporters,
agreeing to discuss the intelligence only on the condition of
anonymity.</p>
<p>The official said that preference has been further cemented by “the
role the U.S. is playing with regard to Ukraine and broader policy
toward Russia.”</p>
<p>The caution from U.S. intelligence officials comes nearly four years
after it issued a similar warning about the 2020 presidential elections,
which pitted then-President Trump against Biden.</p>
<p>Moscow was using “a range of measures to primarily denigrate former
Vice President Biden and what it sees as an anti-Russia
‘establishment,’” William Evanina, the then-head of the U.S. National
Counterintelligence and Security Center, said at the time.</p>
<p>“Some Kremlin-linked actors are also seeking to boost President
Trump’s candidacy on social media and Russian television,” he
added. </p>
<p>A declassified post-election assessment, released in March 2021,
reaffirmed the initial findings. Russian President Vladimir Putin
authorized “influence operations aimed at denigrating President Biden’s
candidacy and the Democratic Party” while offering support for Trump,
the report said. </p>
<p>U.S. intelligence officials said they have been in contact with both
presidential campaigns and the candidates but declined to share what
sort of information may have been shared.</p>
<p>Trump pushback</p>
<p>The Trump campaign Tuesday rejected the U.S. intelligence assessment
as backward.</p>
<p>“Vladimir Putin endorsed Joe Biden for President because he knows
Biden is weak and can easily be bullied, as evidenced by Putin’s
years-long invasion of Ukraine,” national press secretary Karoline
Leavitt told VOA in an email.</p>
<p>“When President Trump was in the Oval Office, Russia and all of
America’s adversaries were deterred, because they feared how the United
States would respond,” she said.</p>
<p>“The only people in America who don’t see this clear contrast between
Biden’s ineffective weakness versus Trump’s effective peace through
strength approach are the left-wing stenographers in the mainstream
media who write false narratives about Donald Trump for a living,” she
added.</p>
<p>The Biden campaign has so far not responded to questions from VOA
about the new U.S. assessment.</p>
<p>Russian sophistication</p>
<p>Russian officials also have not yet responded to requests for comment
on the latest allegations, which accuse the Kremlin of using a “whole of
government” approach to see Trump and other American candidates
perceived as favorable to Moscow win in November.</p>
<p>“Moscow is using a variety of approaches to bolster its messaging and
lend an air of authenticity to its efforts,” the U.S. intelligence
official said. “This includes outsourcing its efforts to commercial
firms to hide its hand and laundering narratives through influential
U.S. voices.”</p>
<p>Russia’s efforts also appear focused on targeting U.S. voters in
so-called swing states, states most likely to impact the outcome of the
presidential election, officials said.</p>
<p>Some of those efforts have already come to light.</p>
<p>Russia and AI</p>
<p>Earlier Tuesday, the U.S. Department of Justice announced the seizure
of two internet domains and of another 968 accounts on the X social
media platform, part of what officials described an artificial
intelligence-driven venture by Russian intelligence and Russia’s
state-run RT news network.</p>
<p>A Justice Department statement said Russian intelligence and RT used
specific AI software to create authentic-looking social media accounts
to mimic U.S. individuals, “which the operators then used to promote
messages in support of Russian government objectives.”</p>
<p>A joint advisory, issued simultaneously by the U.S., Canada and the
Netherlands, warned Russia was in the process of expanding the AI-fueled
influence operation to other social media platforms.</p>
<p>The U.S. intelligence official who spoke to reporters Tuesday
described such use of AI as a “malign influence accelerant,” and warned
the technology had already been deployed, likely by China, in the run-up
to Taiwan’s elections this past January.</p>
<p>China waiting</p>
<p>For now, though, U.S. intelligence officials see few indications
Beijing is seeking to interfere in U.S. elections, as it did in 2020 and
2022. </p>
<p>China “sees little gain in choosing between two parties that are
perceived as both seeking to contain Beijing,” said the U.S.
intelligence official, noting things could change.</p>
<p>“The PRC is seeking to expand its ability to collect and monitor data
on U.S. social media platforms, probably to better understand and
eventually manipulate public opinion,” the official said. “In addition,
we are watching for whether China might seek to influence select
down-ballot races as it did in the 2022 midterm elections.”</p>
<p>The Chinese Embassy in Washington, which has denied previous U.S.
allegations, responded by calling the U.S. “the biggest disseminator of
disinformation.”</p>
<p>“China has no intention and will not interfere in the US election,
and we hope that the US side will not make an issue of China in the
election,” spokesperson Liu Pengyu told VOA in an email.</p>
<p>‘Chaos agent’</p>
<p>The new U.S. election threat assessment warns that in addition to
concerns about Russia and China, there is growing evidence Iran is
seeking to play the role of a “chaos agent” in the upcoming U.S.
vote.</p>
<p>“Iran seeks to stoke social divisions and undermine confidence in
U.S. democratic institutions around the elections,” according to an
unclassified version of the assessment. </p>
<p>It also warned that Tehran “has demonstrated a long-standing interest
in exploiting U.S. political and societal tensions through various
means, including social media.”</p>
<p>As an example, officials Tuesday pointed to newly declassified
intelligence showing Iran trying to exploit pro-Gaza protests across the
U.S.</p>
<p>“We have observed actors tied to Iran’s government posing as
activists online, seeking to encourage protests, and even providing
financial support to protesters,” said National Intelligence Director
Avril Haines.</p>
<p>Haines cautioned, though, that Americans who interacted with the
Iranian actors “may not be aware that they are interacting with or
receiving support from a foreign government.”</p>
<p>Iranian officials have not yet responded to VOA’s request for
comment.</p>

<h2 id="biden-ukraine-to-get-5-more-air-defense-systems">Biden: Ukraine
to get 5 more air defense systems</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Pentagon — Ukraine is receiving five additional air defense systems
to protect its sovereign territory, including three additional Patriot
batteries from the United States, Germany and Romania.</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden announced the five systems as NATO members
commemorated the 75th anniversary of the alliance during a summit in
Washington.</p>
<p>Allies marked the anniversary at Mellon Auditorium, the site of the
original signing of the North Atlantic treaty that established the
defensive bloc in 1949.</p>
<p>Topping the summit agenda is support for Ukraine’s battle against
Russia’s illegal invasion.</p>
<p>The Netherlands and other partners are donating Patriot components to
build a fourth Patriot battery, while Italy is donating an additional
SAMP-T system, according to a joint statement Tuesday by the leaders of
the United States, Germany, the Netherlands, Romania and Ukraine.</p>
<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told NATO members in April
that Ukraine needed a minimum of seven Patriot or other high-end air
defense systems to counter Russian air strikes.</p>
<p>NATO allies say they are coordinating closely with Kyiv to make these
systems available as soon as possible. They also said they are working
to make another announcement about additional strategic air defense
systems for Ukraine later this year.</p>
<p>“Not even our support for Ukraine has been a given,” NATO
Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Tuesday. “The reality is there
are no cost-free options with an aggressive Russia as a neighbor. There
are no risk-free options in a war, and remember, the biggest cost and
the greatest risk will be if Russia wins in Ukraine.”</p>
<p>Since the U.S. Congress approved new aid for Ukraine following months
of delays, the United States has provided Ukraine with hundreds of
millions of dollars in equipment pulled from U.S. stockpiles, including
the additional Patriot battery announced Tuesday and multiple rounds of
long-range missiles known as ATACMS, two U.S. officials told VOA.</p>
<p>The ATACMS have a range of up to 300 kilometers (about 185 miles) and
nearly double the striking distance of Ukraine’s missiles.</p>
<p>In addition, the U.S. has provided billions of dollars of funding for
Kyiv’s long-term defense needs, including last week’s $2.2 billion
Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative package that is being used to
purchase interceptors for NASAMS (medium-range ground-based air defense
system) and Patriot air defense systems for Ukraine.</p>

<p>This post offers some helpful simplifications you can make when
working with RAG or embeddings that help build a working mental model
around them. Embeddings typically form a (hyper)sphere, because they’re
normalized.</p>

<h2 id="pgroonga-3.2.1---multilingual-fast-full-text-search">PGroonga
3.2.1 - Multilingual fast full text search</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-10, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
Hi,
</p>
<p>
PGroonga 3.2.1 has been released!
</p>
<p>
This release adds support for WAL resource manager!
</p>
<p>
With the WAL resource manager support, you can solve the following
problems with the general WAL approach in PGroonga &lt; 3.2.1:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
You need to remove old WAL manually to avoid unlimited storage usage
</li>
<li>
You need to use additional mechanism to apply WAL in background
</li>
<li>
You need to recover from a crash after PostgreSQL started
</li>
</ul>
<p>
See also the following document how to use this feature:
<a href="https://pgroonga.github.io/reference/streaming-replication-wal-resource-manager.html">Streaming
replication by WAL resource manager</a>
</p>
<p>
Note that you need PostgreSQL 15 or later because this is based on
custom WAL resource manager feature that is available since PostgreSQL
15.
</p>
<p>
If you’re interesting in how to implement the WAL resource manager, see
also the following blog post:

<h3>
About PGroonga
</h3>
<p>
<a href="https://pgroonga.github.io/">PGroonga</a> is a PostgreSQL
extension that makes PostgreSQL fast full text search platform for all
languages! It’s released under PostgreSQL license.
</p>
<p>
There are some PostgreSQL extensions that improves full text search
feature of PostgreSQL such as
pg_trgm<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/pgtrgm.html">^1</a>.
</p>
<p>
pg_trgm doesn’t support languages that use non-alphanumerics characters
such as Japanese and Chinese.
</p>
<p>
PGroonga supports all languages, provides rich full text search related
features and is very fast. Because PGroonga uses
Groonga<a href="https://groonga.org/">^2</a> that is a full-fledged full
text search engine as backend.
</p>
<p>
See the following benchmark results for performance:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Benchmark result for PGroonga, textsearch and pg_trgm with English
Wikipedia
https://pgroonga.github.io/reference/pgroonga-versus-textsearch-and-pg-trgm.html
</li>
<li>
Benchmark result for PGroonga and pg_bigm with Japanese Wikipedia
https://pgroonga.github.io/reference/pgroonga-versus-pg-bigm.html
</li>
</ul>
<p>
PGroonga also supports JSON search. You can use each value for
condition. You can also perform full text search against all texts in
JSON like textsearch in PostgreSQL.
</p>
<h3>
Changes
</h3>
<p>
Here are highlights in PGroonga 3.2.1:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Added support for WAL resource manager
</li>
<li>
Added support for downgrading by using <code>ALTER EXTENSION …
UPDATE</code>
</li>
<li>
Added support for Ubuntu 24.04 (Noble Numbat)
</li>
<li>
Added support for typo-tolerance search
</li>
<li>
Fixed some crash bugs
</li>
</ul>
<p>
See also <a href="https://pgroonga.github.io/news/#version-3-2-1">the
3.2.1 release note</a> for full changes.
</p>
<h3>
Usage
</h3>
<p>
You can use PGroonga without full text search knowledge. You just create
an index and puts a condition into WHERE:
</p>
<pre><code>CREATE INDEX index_name ON table USING pgroonga (column);
SELECT * FROM table WHERE column &amp;@~ 'PostgreSQL';
</code></pre>
<p>
You can also use LIKE to use PGroonga. PGroonga provides a feature that
performs LIKE with index. LIKE with PGroonga index is faster than LIKE
without index. It means that you can improve performance without
changing your application that uses the following SQL:
</p>
<pre><code>SELECT * FROM table WHERE column LIKE '%PostgreSQL%';
</code></pre>
<p>
Are you interested in PGroonga? Please
install<a href="https://pgroonga.github.io/install/">^4</a> and try
tutorial<a href="https://pgroonga.github.io/tutorial/">^5</a>. You can
know all PGroonga features.
</p>
<p>
You can install PGroonga easily. Because PGroonga provides packages for
major platforms. There are binaries for Windows.
