## Russian military trainers arrive in Niger as relations with US deteriorate

date: 2024-04-12, from: VOA News USA

DAKAR, Senegal — State television in Niger broadcast footage on Thursday of Russian military trainers arriving in the country aboard a plane equipped with military supplies to boost its air defenses amid deteriorating relations between Niger and the United States. 


Two Russian trainers were filmed in front of the plane wearing military uniforms, caps and face coverings. The plane arrived Wednesday night, the report said. 


"We are here to train the Nigerian army to use the military equipment that is here," one of the Russian trainers said in French in the broadcast. "We are here to develop military cooperation between Russia and Niger." 


Until recently, Washington considered Niger a key partner and ally in a region swept by attempted coups in recent years. 


A U.S. airbase was established as the heart of Niger's counterinsurgency operations in the sub-Saharan region known as the Sahel. Since 2012, the region has been gripped by a worsening insurgency fought by groups linked to al-Qaeda and the Islamic State group. 


The U.S. invested heavily in training Niger's forces to beat back the insurgency that has ravaged the country and its neighbors, but last summer, some of those elite U.S.-trained forces took part in a coup that ousted the elected president. 


U.S. relations with Niger took a further downturn last month when the junta announced on state television the flights from its airbase were illegal and that it no longer recognized the American military presence in the country. The junta criticized the U.S. for trying to force it to choose between partners, warning them against cooperating with Russia and Iran. 


Niamey has yet to order American troops out, U.S. officials have said. 


The broadcast said the arrival of Russian trainers followed a call between Russian President Vladimir Putin and the country's military leaders in March. Niger's military leaders are seeking to diversify their partnerships and achieve greater sovereignty, the broadcast said.

## Do not use Kagi

date: 2024-04-12, from: OS News

For quite a while now, you might have noticed various people recommending a search engine called &#8220;Kagi&#8221;. From random people on the internet, to prominent bloggers like John Gruber and David Pierce, they&#8217;ve all been pushing this seemingly new search engine as a paid-for alternative to Google that respects your privacy. Over the past few months to a year, though, more and more cracks started to appear in Kagi&#8217;s image, and I&#8217;ve been meaning to assemble those cracks and tie a bow on them. Well, it turns out I don&#8217;t have to, because lori (I&#8217;m not aware of their full name, so I&#8217;ll stick to lori) already did it for me in a blog post titled &#8220;Why I lost faith in Kagi&#8220;. Even though I knew all of these stories, and even though I was intending to list them in more or less the same way, it&#8217;s still damning to see it all laid out so well (both the story itself, as well as the lovely, accessible, approachable, and simple HTML, but that&#8217;s neither here nor there). Lori&#8217;s summary hits on all the pain points (but you should really read the whole thing): Between the absolute blase attitude towards privacy, the 100% dedication to AI being the future of search, and the completely misguided use of the company&#8217;s limited funds, I honestly can&#8217;t see Kagi as something I could ever recommend to people. Is the search good? I mean…it&#8217;s not really much better than any other search, it heavily leverages Bing like DDG and the other indie search platforms do, the only real killer feature it has to me is the ability to block domains from your results, which I can currently only do in other search engines via a user script that doesn&#8217;t help me on mobile. But what good is filtering out all of the AI generated spamblogs on a search platform that wants to spit more AI generated bullshit at me directly? Sure I can turn it off, but who&#8217;s to say that they won&#8217;t start using my data to fuel their own LLM? They already have an extremely skewed idea of what counts as PII or not. They could easily see using people&#8217;s searches as being &#8220;anonymized&#8221; and decide they&#8217;re fine to use, because their primary business isn&#8217;t search, it&#8217;s AI. ↫ lori at lori&#8217;s blog The examples underpinning all these pain points are just baffling, like how the company was originally an &#8220;AI&#8221; company, made a search engine that charges people for Bing results, and now is going full mask-off with countless terrible, non-working, privacy-invasive &#8220;AI&#8221; tools. Or that thing where the company spent one third of their funding round of $670,000 on starting a T-shirt company in Germany (Kagi is US-based) to print 20,000 free T-shirts for their users that don&#8217;t even advertise Kagi. Or that thing where they claimed they &#8220;forgot&#8221; to pay sales tax for two years and had to raise prices to pay their back taxes. And I can just keep on going. To make matters worse, after publication of the blog post, Kagi&#8217;s CEO started harassing lori over email, and despite lori stating repeatedly they wanted him to stop emailing them, he just kept on going. Never a good look. The worst part of it, though, is the lack of understanding about what privacy means, while telling their users they are super serious about it. Add to that the CEO&#8217;s &#8220;trust me, bro&#8221; attitude, their deals with the shady and homophobic crypto company Brave, and many other things, and the conclusion is that, no, your data is not safe at Kagi at all, and with their primary business being &#8220;AI&#8221; and not search, you know exactly what that means. Do not use Kagi.

## Amazon virtually kills efforts to develop Alexa Skills, disappointing dozens

date: 2024-04-12, from: OS News

There was a time when it thought that Alexa would yield a robust ecosystem of apps, or Alexa Skills, that would make the voice assistant an integral part of users&#8217; lives. Amazon envisioned tens of thousands of software developers building valued abilities for Alexa that would grow the voice assistant&#8217;s popularity—and help Amazon make some money. But about seven years after launching a rewards program to encourage developers to build Skills, Alexa&#8217;s most preferred abilities are the basic ones, like checking the weather. And on June 30, Amazon will stop giving out the monthly Amazon Web Services credits that have made it free for third-party developers to build and host Alexa Skills. The company also recently told devs that its Alexa Developer Rewards program was ending, virtually disincentivizing third-party devs to build for Alexa. ↫ Scharon Harding at Ars Technica I&#8217;ve never used Alexa &#8211; Amazon doesn&#8217;t really have a footprint in either The Netherlands or Sweden, so I never really had to care &#8211; but I always thought the Skills were the reason it was so loved. It seemingly makes no sense to me to start killing off this feature, but then, I&#8217;m assuming Amazon has the data to back up the fact people aren&#8217;t using them. It sucks, I guess? Can someone who uses Alexa fill in the blanks for me here?

## American goes missing in Russian-controlled eastern Ukraine, police say

date: 2024-04-12, from: VOA News USA

MOSCOW — Russell Bentley, an American who fought against Ukrainian forces, is missing in the Russian-controlled Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine, police there said Friday, adding that a search was underway.


Bentley went missing on April 8, according to police. The online news outlet Mash said he had disappeared after a district in the city of Donetsk was shelled by Ukrainian forces.


Mash cited his wife as saying he had gone to see if anyone needed help but had not returned. She was quoted as saying she had found his car with his baseball cap in it along with his smashed mobile phone and a pair of glasses.


Bentley, 64, is a self-declared supporter of Russian-backed forces in Ukraine.


He joined pro-Russian fighters in eastern Ukraine in 2014 and used the military call-sign "Texas," the Russian state news agency RIA reported.


It said Bentley had later swapped his gun for journalism and had worked with the Sputnik news agency, another state-owned entity, and obtained Russian citizenship.


Russian state media have described Bentley as a war correspondent.


In 2022, Rolling Stone magazine ran an interview with Bentley titled "The Bizarre Story of How a Hardcore Texas Leftist Became a Front-line Putin propagandist."

## Lessons from a First Time EV Owner

date: 2024-04-12, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTk2MTYwNS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcyMzY0Njg0Mn0.rzOG0Od64kWBrgMCX2Tv44Z6wYdWGS-CHAPgqtB0z7Y/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">For the first time in my life I now own a car, and it’s electric.</p><p>It took me a few weeks to narrow down my choices to a Hyundai Kona or a Ford Mustang Mach E. After much agonizing comparison, I went with the Kona. While I liked the Mach E’s sporty performance, longer range, and sizable front trunk, ultimately the Kona’s cheaper price, lighter materials, heat pump, and numerous mechanical buttons clinched the deal. After trading in a clapped out 2011 Subaru Impreza, the out-the-door sticker price for the Kona was a bit over $31,000 (though we opted to lease).</p><p>Owning and driving an EV has been an instructive experience. I’ve long been a vocal proponent of going electric, but I was honestly surprised by the learning curve. As the automotive journalist Edward Neidermeyer continually points out, an EV simply is not a perfect drop-in replacement for an internal combustion car. But that doesn’t mean you can’t make it work, even for long trips, even in fairly bedraggled parts of the country like northeastern Pennsylvania, where I live, and even with a modest battery and range.</p><p>First, the buying experience. The nearest Kona for sale I could find was a 70-mile drive away from Wilkes-Barre to Easton, and the dealership let me take it home so my wife could check it out. This led to the first of several comical lessons. The car had only about a 60 percent charge when I left the dealership, and drained down to 33 percent when I got back home. So before going back to sign the lease papers, it would need a top-up.</p><p>I searched on Google Maps for chargers and blithely set out to fill up. It turns out Rust Belt cities like the Scranton-Wilkes-Barre area are not exactly bursting with EV charging infrastructure. The first one I found was a free employee charger at a charter school. Out of curiosity I plugged it in. It did in fact work — and if I had been willing to sit there stealing 6 kilowatts of power for 10 hours, I could have gotten up to 100 percent. This seemed less than ideal. I then tried another charger around the corner at a used dealership. This one had a credit card reader but it did not work.</p><p>Scrolling through Google some more, I discovered that if you poke around in the menus it actually tells you the supposed speed of each charger (rated as slow, fast, very fast, or ultra fast). A 10-minute drive across the river was a non-Tesla fast charger at a Chevy dealership, though irritatingly I had to download an app and connect my Apple pay to make it work instead of just tapping my credit card.</p><p>Then I learned that the temperature of the battery matters a great deal. When I first plugged in, the charger delivered a measly 28 kilowatts. But then as the battery warmed up, that nearly doubled to 49 kilowatts (as compared to the Kona’s claimed maximum rate of 100 kilowatts). That isn’t particularly fast — but it also demonstrated another lesson, which is that there are advantages to a smaller battery, at just 65 kilowatt-hours. That fairly pitiful charging speed, topping out at less than a seventh of the maximum at modern stations, was still enough to get me from 28 percent to 75 percent in about 35 minutes. If I had been driving a Hummer EV, it would have been more like two hours.</p><p>That lesson was underlined charging at home. My house was built in the 1940s and has no outdoor outlets whatsoever, but in the pinch, I could string an extension cord out the window to use the included level 1 charger … to deliver a pathetic 600 watts, or less than the power supply on my gaming PC. Yet this was still enough to add 10-12 percent of charge per day, or about 30 miles, which is more than we drive on average. If I’d gone with the Mach E, it would be more like 20 miles, thanks to its bigger battery.</p><p>I learned a more serious lesson the next day going down to sign the paperwork. My wife had to come with me to the dealership, since she owned the Subaru, and therefore my 2-month-old son had to come along as well. With a 75 percent charge, I figured we’d be fine to make it there and back. When we got to the dealership, the car still had 48 percent — surely more than enough to make it back given my prior trip, right?</p><p>But then we had to sit at the dealership for three hours thanks to some incomprehensible financing dispute going on in a back room. By the time we finished, moved the car around several times, and grabbed some food on the way out, it was only about 42 percent by the time we got going. As we headed up Route 33, the Kona’s computer informed us we’d arrive with about 35 miles of range to spare. Since it was already well past the boy’s bedtime and I really, really didn’t want to hunt around in the cold for a charger that might or might not work, I decided to risk it.</p><p>But by this point it was well past dark, and the temperature was dropping into the low 40s. Meanwhile, what with wife and baby in the back seat, I had to run the heater much more than I had the first time, when I had left the cabin heater low and just used the seat warmer.</p><p>It turns out heating and driving uphill sucks battery power. As the temperature fell further into the low 30s, and the Kona zipped up the long grades at Wind Gap and Tannersville, I watched with increasing alarm as the buffer mileage dropped to 30, then 25, then 20. I told myself I would stop to charge if it got below 10 miles of buffer, but it finally stabilized around 15 miles in the Poconos.</p><p>It was a genuine case of range anxiety, no question about it, and my wife was ready to strangle me. But there was one last surprise as we crested the ridge and headed down into the Wyoming Valley. On that long downslope, I alternated between coasting and turning up the regenerative braking around corners, which got back another 14 miles of range. We pulled up with 15 percent battery and 29 miles to spare — not so far off the original estimate after all!</p><p>This need for planning is the major difference between electric and gas, at least given the current state of America’s charging infrastructure. With a gas car you can assume that range will not change much depending on the weather, that you can run your tank nearly empty with the sole penalty being another few seconds of standing at the pump, and that even the tiniest settlement is virtually guaranteed to have a gas station.</p><p>But on an EV trip of any distance you want to charge early and often, and that means some careful route planning. A theoretical 270 mile range means you have more like 160-220 miles you can realistically use, depending significantly on the temperature, wind, number of passengers, and so on. But unless you are in an exceptionally cold and/or depopulated area, it’s not that big of a deal. Just find some charging stations on the route, ideally with good reviews, and stop every hour or two for 20-30 minutes of charging, or less if your car can take mega voltage like the Ioniq 5. (There are several chargers in East Stroudsburg I could have used, for instance.)</p><p>You can’t cannonball to cut the trip time down to the absolute minimum, but you also get a chance to stretch out regularly and cut your risk of deep vein thrombosis. Meanwhile, if you can charge at home, your cost of fuel goes down dramatically. I now spend maybe $3 on a week’s worth of driving electricity.</p><p>So yes, there are some tradeoffs that come with the EV lifestyle. But even for an EV with a modest battery, driving in the cold mountains of impoverished Appalachia, they are not remotely insurmountable — and everything will only get easier from here on out. More chargers are being built all the time, and soon Tesla’s network will open up to all. You don’t need a 500-mile range battery, or to carry a backup generator around. It just takes a change in mindset.</p>

It says retrofitting blast furnaces with CCS is risky because “it leaves high residual emissions, requires significant CO2 transport and storage infrastructure, needs to take high upstream methane emissions from coal mines into account and will become less and less commercially attractive as hydrogen costs decline and CO2 prices rise.”

## Workers are getting a smaller slice of the pie

date: 2024-04-12, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>Next month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will tell us how much of the income generated by workers’ toil actually went to them in Q1. That stat is called labor share of national income — and it’s shrinking. Plus, a government committee that scrutinizes deals between foreign companies and American firms may be getting more power. And 14 states are opting out of a summer EBT program that would help families buy groceries.</p>

## Smuggling Gold by Disguising it as Machine Parts

<p>Someone got caught trying to <a href="https://jalopnik.com/10-million-in-gold-disguised-as-machine-parts-seized-f-1851397958">smuggle</a> 322 pounds of gold (that&#8217;s about 1/4 of a cubic foot) out of Hong Kong. It was disguised as machine parts:</p>
<blockquote><p>On March 27, customs officials x-rayed two air compressors and discovered that they contained gold that had been &#8220;concealed in the integral parts&#8221; of the compressors. Those gold parts had also been painted silver to match the other components in an attempt to throw customs off the trail.</p></blockquote>

<hr />
<div class="q"><p><strong>Let&#039;s start from the basics: can you introduce yourself?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>I'm a writer and graphic designer in the Seattle area. I can't get enough writing; on top of <a href="https://tracydurnell.com/mind-garden/">blogging</a>, I also write speculative fiction. I love reading, mostly fiction, and use my website as an alternative to Goodreads to write reviews and <a href="https://tracydurnell.com/reading/read-in-2024/">track reads</a>. Over the past several years, I've added more and more things to my site: listens, playlists, recipes, follows, accountability tracking, big questions. </p>
<p>I work in sustainability, previously in local government and now as a consultant. My background is in ecology; I thought I wanted to be a wildlife biologist, but after one field season studying lizards in the Los Angeles suburbs, I realized the itinerant research biologist lifestyle was not for me. </p>
<p>Now I stay connected to nature through my wildlife garden. My yard backs up to a greenbelt, so on top of <a href="https://cascadiainspired.com/diy-lawn-replacement-overview/">ripping out our lawn</a> and planting native plants, we also restored the natural area adjacent. (I ran a blog devoted to Pacific Northwest nature for ten years!) </p>
<p>This probably makes it sound like I blog a lot about the environment, but I get enough of that in my work life, so not much actually! I'll keep notes from webinars and bookmark articles related to work on my website since they're related to learning, but I try to preserve my blog as a non-work thinking space for me to play.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>What&#039;s the story behind your blog?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>I started my current blog at <a href="https://tracydurnell.com/mind-garden/">tracydurnell.com</a> when I encountered the idea of a <a href="https://indieweb.org/digital_garden">digital garden</a>* in 2021. The concept appealed to me for its looseness and built-in acceptance of incompleteness and imperfection. On my previous blog, <a href="https://cascadiainspired.com/">Cascadia Inspired</a>, I'd locked myself into a narrow pool of topics that no longer matched my life, and felt constrained. Releasing myself upon a boundless format with lower expectations unleashed a deluge of thoughts I hadn't realized had no outlet before (or that I hadn't really given myself space to think). </p>
<p>*(Having learned more about digital gardens, the blog itself is more of a <a href="https://indieweb.org/commonplace_book">commonplace book</a>, but I feel it's fine to trick our brains however we need to to grant ourselves permission to create. Some people <a href="https://tracydurnell.com/2022/11/09/tricking-your-brain-into-writing-the-way-you-want/">write in all lowercase</a>, I tell myself my blog is a garden.)</p>
<p>I'd had a handmade HTML portfolio site parked on the domain for years because I felt obliged to have one, but it was a huge pain to update without a content management system. Letting go of that was a great relief in itself, and then reinless blogging was joyfully liberating. (Ironically, this means that one of the last things I now rely on a third party site to host is my design portfolio 😂)</p>
<p>That switch from professional portfolio to blog is why I've done so little to personalize the design of my website: I used the base theme from the year I launched the blog and tweaked the colors slightly, but otherwise only add CSS to solve specific layout or display issues. For too long, I'd been paralyzed by the need to design and code a fully customized site that "represented me as a designer," so I decided to completely release myself from that burden and use the absolute simplest design option. I chose to not care whether people judge me for using a generic template because the purpose of the site is the information on it, not its aesthetics. As long as the styling works to convey the info I want, I'm happy to leave the default. (This prioritization is a design decision in itself, which I suppose represents my practicality when it comes to design 🤷‍♀️) </p>
<p>I first <a href="https://tracydurnell.com/2023/09/23/my-20th-anniversary-of-blogging/">started blogging twenty years ago</a>, when I went to college, to share what I was doing with my family. In that initial blogging phase, I focused on writing about "mini adventures" I took -- but after college I found I didn't <em>do</em> enough to warrant writing about because I was too exhausted after work. I half-heartedly tried some commentary style blogging, but it didn't stick. </p>
<p>In 2012, missing that creative outlet, I started writing at Cascadia Inspired as a way to connect more deeply with Washington nature and explore creative processes. I hoped that having the site would prompt me to go on more hikes, which worked for a while, then became an albatross. </p>
<p>When I started blogging at <a href="http://tracydurnell.com/">TracyDurnell.com</a>, I then faced the conundrum of <a href="https://tracydurnell.com/2022/10/27/deciding-what-belongs-on-my-website/">what writing belonged on which blog</a>. More and more, I shifted my writing over to the new site. Now that I was letting myself write about anything, I wanted to. Finally, I put the Cascadia Inspired blog on hiatus last fall.</p>
<p>Since going freelance, I've also been posting weeknotes to help me recognize the progress I'm making on long term projects and keep myself honest about how much I can do in a week. My website is a toolbox in itself: a tool for thinking, a place for storing information, a non-corporate means of tracking my intake, a method of self-kindness and personal growth, an outlet for reflection. It's endlessly adaptable and expandable to my needs. Part of the fun is that it's always evolving.</p>
<p>As an adult, I learned my grandpa had been a letterpress printer, as had his mother; it tickles me that I have wound up in design and (digital) publishing too.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>What does your creative process look like when it comes to blogging?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>Most of my blogging is reactive, prompted by something I've read. (I've written about <a href="https://tracydurnell.com/2023/12/18/choosing-between-ideas-for-blog-posts/">choosing between ideas</a> for posts.) I especially enjoy finding connections between pieces and seeing whether pairing articles reveals something more than either alone; Tom Critchlow described this, or something like it, as <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2023/01/20/digital-bricolage/">digital bricolage</a>.</p>
<p>Because lots of my blogging is interspersed with online reading, it happens <em>where</em> I read... which is primarily on my phone. I blog most often in my phone's browser window, which is not ergonomic. For pieces over a certain length and complexity, I do try to move to my desktop, where I still write directly in the browser. (I've written at length about my process for <a href="https://tracydurnell.com/2023/09/27/how-i-approach-crafting-a-blog-post/">crafting long blog posts</a> -- tl;dr many (too many) rounds of revisions.) </p>
<p>I've been paying attention to <a href="https://tracydurnell.com/2024/01/02/challenging-myself-playfully/">what I admire on other blogs</a>, and one of my goals this year is to write more self-prompted articles. Right now I'm experimenting with writing a longer piece in Scrivener, the writing software I use for fiction. Switching to Scrivener for fiction writing made a massive difference, helping me organize my thoughts better, so I'm curious how it will affect blogging. I've also read a couple books specifically for this article -- a fun return to purpose-driven research, which I've rarely had cause for since college. We'll see whether it comes together or I've gathered too much material and overwhelmed myself!</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe the physical space influences your creativity?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>Ideas aren't a limiting factor for me; I can be creative anywhere, but the question for me is whether I can <em>work</em> in a space. Physical comfort is the most important aspect of a work space for me: decent ergonomics, enough light, not too loud, not too cold. I find not having enough space to spread out to be limiting -- I prefer to have enough room for both my computer and a notebook for brainstorming on paper. </p>
<p>Before the pandemic, I used to work in coffee shops regularly as a commitment device, but it was never that productive because I'd get distracted by friends or noise, be crammed into small tables with my laptop perched precariously, or feel anxious whether I'd bought enough food and drinks. Now I much prefer working at my wide desk with a large monitor and ergonomic keyboard.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your tech stack?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>My webhosting is through HostGator, and my domain registrar is NameCheap. I'm on shared hosting, which is sufficient to host all of my websites. </p>
<p>I self-host WordPress as my content management system with <a href="https://tracydurnell.com/2023/12/11/my-current-wordpress-plugins-and-customizations/">these plugins</a>. I use the IndieWeb plugin to enable Webmentions, so I can send and receive comments from other websites. </p>
<p>I also have a <a href="https://notes.tracydurnell.com/">notes blog</a> on a subdomain, powered by micro.blog, which is federated.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would you do anything differently?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>While I've run most of my sites on WordPress since 2012, if I was starting today I might explore other options. There's a lot that's great about WordPress, but I find the block structure poorly suited to blogging; fortunately, I can use a plugin to restore the classic editor (for now).</p>
<p>I've chosen to blog under my real name for a number of reasons, but I also can see the value and freedom in anonymity. There are some subjects I'd like to write about that are too personally revealing. (When I first blogged, I wrote openly about some things I now keep private; were the times simpler or was I more naive?)</p>
<p>From a content perspective, I'd try to be more social with my website earlier. Discovering the IndieWeb and meeting other people who think keeping websites is rad has totally enlivened my blogging. I feel <a href="https://tracydurnell.com/2023/11/30/building-community-out-of-strangers/">much more connected to the online community</a> than I ever did during my first decade and a half of blogging.</p>
<p>Back in the day I followed mostly big name bloggers and topic-focused blogs, which fostered more parasocial relationships between writer and audience; now <a href="https://tracydurnell.com/blogroll/">I follow a lot of other 'normal people'</a> with personal websites who are sharing their ponderings and slices of life. It's easier for me to engage in a bloggy conversation with people who feel like peers, and fun to join in with what I see others writing about. (How much do our follows reveal our interests versus shape them?)</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>Financial question since the web is obsessed with money: how much does it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost or does it generate some revenue? And what&#039;s your position on people monetising personal blogs?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>Webhosting costs me about $200 a year, and my domain about $15. (Of course, like many people with websites, I have way too many domains so they add up 😉) I begrudgingly subscribe to Google Drive, where I have automatic website backups stored, for $20 a year. Micro.blog is another $5 a month. As a hobby, I consider blogging reasonably affordable at about $25 a month.</p>
<p>I don't mind other people monetizing their blogs, especially with affiliate links, membership programs, and donations. It totally makes sense for people who need more expensive hosting than I can get away with -- but I also think it's fine for people to charge for their work even if they don't "need the money" -- creators shouldn't be ashamed for earning money from their work. The only aspect that troubles me is when content is paywalled, which then removes it from the open web, but I understand that people need to make money and people come first.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth checking out? And also, who do you think I should be interviewing next?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>Blog recommendations: </p>
<ul>
<li>Mandy Brown's <a href="https://aworkinglibrary.com/writing/">A Working Library</a>, with reading notes and reflections, and <a href="https://everythingchanges.us/blog/">Everything Changes</a>, with business-adjacent life musings, are both insightful</li>
<li>Anna Havron writes thoughtfully about a meaningful life at <a href="http://annahavron.com/">annahavron.com</a> and practically about getting work done at <a href="https://analogoffice.net/">Analog Office</a></li>
<li>At <a href="https://going-medieval.com/">Going Medieval</a>, Dr. Eleanor Janega writes hilariously (and informatively) about medieval history, gender roles, and how these all tie in to our lives today</li>
</ul>
<p>It'd be interesting to hear from Reimena Yee, a comic artist who has a fun <a href="https://reimenayee.com/">website</a> and interesting <a href="https://blog.reimenayee.com/">blog</a>. I'd also love to hear from <a href="https://erinkissane.com/">Erin Kissane</a>, and if we're going big, Deb Perelman of <a href="https://smittenkitchen.com/">Smitten Kitchen</a>!</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>Final question: is there anything you want to share with us?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>I'd encourage anyone who wants to meet other bloggers and website makers to check out an <a href="https://events.indieweb.org/">IndieWeb online event</a> like Homebrew Website Club, which is held regularly in European and North American timezones. It's not just for technical folks!</p></div>

<p>Hey Dear R.P.P. (Roger Palmer Pal) …&#160; When we chat about that April 5, I hardly know what to say. A contrite “thank you” isn’t remotely enough.

## Rob Kerchner | A Green Policy Backfire

<p>Another green policy backfire: After 10 years, California’s 2014 plastic bag tax has increased the weight of plastic bags in California landfills by almost 30%.&#160; Since bag taxes were enacted, plastic bags have been made thicker to qualify as being “reusable.” But consumers discard them anyway.

## Discord is nuking Nintendo Switch emulator devs and their entire servers

date: 2024-04-12, from: OS News

Discord has shut down the Discord servers for the Nintendo Switch emulators Suyu and Sudachi and has completely disabled their lead developers’ accounts — and the company isn’t answering our questions about why it went that far. Both Suyu and Sudachi began as forks of Yuzu, the emulator that Nintendo sued out of existence on March 4th. ↫ Sean Hollister at The Verge This is exactly what people were worried about when Nintendo and Yuzu settled for millions of dollars. Even though it&#8217;s a settlement and not a court ruling, and even tough the code to Yuzu is entirely unaffected by the settlement and freely shareable and usable by anyone, and even though emulators are legal &#8211; the chilling effect this settlement is having is absolutely undeniable. Here we have Discord going far beyond its own official policy, without even giving the affected parties any recourse. It&#8217;s absolutely wild, and highlights just how dangerous it is to rely on Discord for, well, anything. I wish that for once, we&#8217;d actually see a case related to console emulation go to court in either the EU or the US, to make it even clearer that yes, unless you distribute copyrighted code like game ROMs or console firmware, emulators are entirely legal and without any risk. You know, a recent court ruling we could point to to dissuade bullies like Nintendo from threatening innocent developers and ruining their lives because of entirely legal activities. And let me reiterate: don&#8217;t use Discord as for anything other than basic chat. This platform ain&#8217;t got your back.

## DwarfFS: a read-only compression file system

date: 2024-04-12, from: OS News

DwarFS is a read-only file system with a focus on achieving very high compression ratios in particular for very redundant data.  DwarFS also doesn&#8217;t compromise on speed and for my use cases I&#8217;ve found it to be on par with or perform better than SquashFS. For my primary use case, DwarFS compression is an order of magnitude better than SquashFS compression, it&#8217;s 6 times faster to build the file system, it&#8217;s typically faster to access files on DwarFS and it uses less CPU resources. ↫ DwarfFS GitHub page DwarfFS supports both Linux, macOS, and Windows, but macOS and Windows support is experimental at this point. It seems to have higher compression ratios at faster speeds than various alternatives, so if you have a use case for compression file systems &#8211; give DwarfFS a look.

## 20 years later, Abu Ghraib detainees get their day in US court

date: 2024-04-12, from: VOA News USA

ALEXANDRIA, Va. — Twenty years ago this month, photos of abused prisoners and smiling U.S. soldiers guarding them at Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison were released, shocking the world.


Now, three survivors of Abu Ghraib will finally get their day in U.S. court against the military contractor they hold responsible for their mistreatment.


The trial is scheduled to begin Monday in U.S. District Court in Alexandria, and it will be the first time that Abu Ghraib survivors are able to bring their claims of torture to a U.S. jury, said Baher Azmy, a lawyer with the Center for Constitutional Rights representing the plaintiffs.


The defendant in the civil suit, CACI, supplied the interrogators who worked at the prison. The Virginia-based contractor denies any wrongdoing and has emphasized throughout 16 years of litigation that its employees are not alleged to have inflicted any abuse on any of the plaintiffs in the case.


The plaintiffs, though, seek to hold CACI responsible for setting the conditions that resulted in the torture they endured, citing evidence in government investigations that CACI contractors instructed military police to "soften up" detainees for their interrogations.


Retired Army Gen. Antonio Taguba, who led an investigation into the Abu Ghraib scandal, is among those expected to testify. His inquiry concluded that at least one CACI interrogator should be held accountable for instructing military police to set conditions that amounted to physical abuse.


There is little dispute that the abuse was horrific. The photos released in 2004 showed naked prisoners stacked into pyramids or dragged by leashes. Some photos had a soldier smiling and giving a thumbs up while posing next to a corpse, or detainees being threatened with dogs, or hooded and attached to electrical wires.


The plaintiffs cannot be clearly identified in any of the infamous images, but their descriptions of mistreatment are unnerving.




Suhail Al Shimari has described sexual assaults and beatings during his two months at the prison. He was also electrically shocked and dragged around the prison by a rope tied around his neck. Former Al-Jazeera reporter Salah Al-Ejaili said he was subjected to stress positions that caused him to vomit black liquid. He was also deprived of sleep, forced to wear women's underwear and threatened with dogs.


CACI, though, has said the U.S. military is the institution that bears responsibility for setting the conditions at Abu Ghraib and that its employees weren't in a position to be giving orders to soldiers. In court papers, lawyers for the contractor group have said the "entire case is nothing more than an attempt to impose liability on CACI PT because its personnel worked in a war zone prison with a climate of activity that reeks of something foul. The law, however, does not recognize guilt by association with Abu Ghraib."


The case has bounced through the courts since 2008, and CACI has tried roughly 20 times to have it tossed out of court. The U.S. Supreme Court in 2021 ultimately turned back CACI's appeal efforts and sent the case back to district court for trial.


In one of CACI's appeal arguments, the company contended that the U.S. enjoys sovereign immunity against the torture claims, and that CACI enjoys derivative immunity as a contractor doing the government's bidding. But U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema, in a first-of-its kind ruling, determined that the U.S. government can't claim immunity when it comes to allegations that violate established international norms, like torturing prisoners, so CACI as a result can't claim any derivative immunity.


Jurors next week are also expected to hear testimony from some of the soldiers who were convicted in military court of directly inflicting the abuse. Ivan Frederick, a former staff sergeant who was sentenced to more than eight years of confinement after a court-martial conviction on charges including assault, indecent acts and dereliction of duty, has provided deposition testimony that is expected to be played for the jury because he has refused to attend the trial voluntarily. The two sides have differed on whether his testimony establishes that soldiers were working under the direction of CACI interrogators.


The U.S. government may present a wild card in the trial, which is scheduled to last two weeks. Both the plaintiffs and CACI have complained that their cases have been hampered by government assertions that some evidence, if made public, would divulge state secrets that would harm national security.


Government lawyers will be at the trial ready to object if witnesses stray into territory they deem to be a state secret, they said at a pretrial hearing April 5.


Judge Brinkema, who has overseen complex national security cases many times, warned the government that if it asserts such a privilege at trial, "it better be a genuine state secret."


Jason Lynch, a government lawyer, assured her, "We're trying to stay out of the way as much as we possibly can."


Of the three plaintiffs, only Al-Ejaili, who now lives in Sweden, is expected to testify in person. The other two will testify remotely from Iraq. Brinkema has ruled that the reasons they were sent to Abu Ghraib are irrelevant and won't be given to jurors. All three were released after periods of detention ranging from two months to a year without ever being charged with a crime, according to court papers.


"Even if they were terrorists, it doesn't excuse the conduct that's alleged here," she said at the April 5 hearing.

## OpenBSD is a cozy operating system

date: 2024-04-12, from: OS News

With the recent release of OpenBSD 7.5, I decided to run through my personal OpenBSD &#8220;installer&#8221; for laptop/desktop devices. The project is built off of the dwm tiling window manager and only installs a few basic packages. The last time I updated it was with the release of 7.3, so it&#8217;s been due for an minor rework. While making these minor changes, I remembered how incredibly easy the entire install process for OpenBSD is and how cozy the entire operating system feels. All the core systems just work out the box. Yes, you need to &#8220;patch&#8221; in WiFi with a firmware update, so you&#8217;ll need an Ethernet connection during the initial setup. Yes, the default desktop environment is not intuitive or ideal for newcomers. But the positives heavily outweigh the negatives (in my opinion). ↫ Bradley Taunt OpenBSD has a very dedicated community, and I&#8217;ve noticed they tend to be very helpful and friendly. It&#8217;s making me curious about trying it out, and both this article and the helpful posts it links to will be a great way to start.

## Android 15 Beta 1 is here, but details are still under wraps

date: 2024-04-12, from: OS News

After two months of developer previews, Google has finally released Android 15 Beta 1. While the beta usually offers more user-facing changes, Google is still pretty light on details with this build, giving us only a few more details on what we can expect. Instead, the company is pointing to Google I/O for more details, which will take place on May 14 this year, basically confirming that this is when we will get the second beta with more features. ↫ Manuel Vonau There&#8217;s very little of interest in this beta, so unless you&#8217;re really into Android development, I&#8217;d wait out installing any betas until after Google I/O.

## Greenmask v0.1.7 Release

date: 2024-04-12, from: PostgreSQL News

<h1>Greenmask v0.1.7 Release</h1>
<h2>PostgreSQL Dump and Obfuscation Tool</h2>
<p>This release introduces a new Greenmask command, improvements, bug fixes, and documentation updates.</p>
<h1>Greenmask Overview</h1>
<h2>Key Features</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cross-platform</strong> — can be easily built and executed on any platform, thanks to its Go-based architecture,
  which eliminates platform dependencies.</li>
<li><strong>Interactive</strong> - allows to check the transformation result and show problems if any using the single command <code>validate</code></li>
<li><strong>Schema difference check</strong> - validate your current database with the previous dump in storage and show diff</li>
<li><strong>Database type safe</strong> — ensures data integrity by validating data and utilizing the database driver for
  encoding and decoding operations. This approach guarantees the preservation of data formats.</li>
<li><strong>Transformation validation and easy maintainable</strong> — during obfuscation development, Greenmask provides validation warnings and a transformation diff feature, allowing you to monitor and maintain transformations effectively throughout the software lifecycle.</li>
<li><strong>Partitioned tables transformation inheritance</strong> — define transformation configurations once and apply them to all partitions within partitioned tables, simplifying the obfuscation process.</li>
<li><strong>Stateless</strong> — Greenmask operates as a logical dump and does not impact your existing database schema.</li>
<li><strong>Backward compatible</strong> — it fully supports the same features and protocols as existing vanilla PostgreSQL utilities. Dumps created by Greenmask can be successfully restored using the pg_restore utility.</li>
<li><strong>Extensible</strong> — users have the flexibility to implement domain-based transformations in any programming language or use predefined templates.</li>
<li><strong>Declarative</strong> — Greenmask allows you to define configurations in a structured, easily parsed, and recognizable format.</li>
<li><strong>Integrable</strong> — integrate Greenmask seamlessly into your CI/CD system for automated database obfuscation and restoration.</li>
<li><strong>Parallel execution</strong> — take advantage of parallel dumping and restoration, significantly reducing the time required to deliver results.</li>
<li><strong>Provide a variety of storage</strong> — Greenmask offers a variety of storage options for local and remote data storage, including directories and S3-like storage solutions.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Greenmask is ideally suited for:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Routine backup and restoration tasks, ensuring data integrity and availability.</li>
<li>Anonymization and data masking for staging environments and analytics, protecting sensitive information while maintaining data utility.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Release Notes</h2>
<h3>v0.1.7</h3>
<h5>New features</h5>
<ul>
<li>Added restoration filtering by <code>--table</code>, <code>--schema</code> and <code>--exclude-schema</code> parameters</li>
<li>Validate command without parameters validates only the configuration file</li>
<li>Added the <code>--schema</code> parameter, which allows to make a schema diff between the previous dump and the current. This 
  is useful when you want to check if the schema has changed after the migration. By controlling it we can exclude 
  data leakage after migration</li>
<li>Validate command divided by many stages that can be controlled using parameters<ul>
<li>Configuration validation</li>
<li>Transformer validation</li>
<li>Constraint violation check</li>
<li>Data difference check</li>
<li>Schema difference check</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>Improvements</h5>
<ul>
<li>Improved Hash transformer <ul>
<li>Added salt parameter that can be set via config or via <code>GREENMASK_GLOBAL_SALT</code></li>
<li>Added sha3 functions support in different modes (sha3-224, sha3-256, sha3-384, sha3-512)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Refactored <code>Cmd</code> transformer logic<ul>
<li>Json API: Now it allows to use of column names instead of column indexes in JSON format</li>
<li>Csv API: Now it can use the column order from config via column remapping</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <code>validate</code> command was rewritten almost from scratch.<ul>
<li>New option <code>--transformed-only</code> - displays only columns that are transformed with a primary key (if exists). This
  allows to reduce the output data and make it more readable</li>
<li>Implemented <code>json</code> format for output</li>
<li>Added the <code>--table-format</code> parameter which is responsible for the <code>vertical</code> and <code>horizontal</code> table orientation.
  This works only when <code>--format=text</code></li>
<li>Added the <code>--warnings</code> parameter, if it is specified then not only fatal-warnings will be displayed, but also
  those with a lower severity</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>Fixes</h5>
<ul>
<li>Fixed <code>--use-list</code> option - now it applies to entries according to the order in the list file</li>
<li>Fixed <code>--use-list</code> option behavior together with <code>--list-format</code> option (<code>json</code> or <code>text</code>). Now it
  generates a temporal list file in text format for providing it to the pg_restore call</li>
<li>Updated documentation according to the latest changes</li>
</ul>
<h3>v0.1.2 - v0.1.6</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed uncontrolled buffer growth in the restore command</li>

## Indiana aspires to become next great tech center

date: 2024-04-11, from: VOA News USA

indianapolis, indiana — Semiconductors, or microchips, are critical to almost everything electronic used in the modern world. In 1990, the United States produced about 40% of the world's semiconductors. As manufacturing migrated to Asia, U.S. production fell to about 12%.


"During COVID, we got a wake-up call. It was like [a] Sputnik moment," explained Mark Lundstrom, an engineer who has worked with microchips much of his life.


The 2020 global coronavirus pandemic slowed production in Asia, creating a ripple through the global supply chain and leading to shortages of everything from phones to vehicles. Lundstrom said increasing U.S. reliance on foreign chip manufacturers exposed a major weakness.


"We know that AI is going to transform society in the next several years, it requires extremely powerful chips. The most powerful leading-edge chips."


Today, Lundstrom is the Chief Semiconductor Officer for Purdue University in Lafayette, Indiana, a leader in cutting-edge semiconductor development, which has new importance amid the emerging field of artificial intelligence.


"If we fall behind in AI, the consequences are enormous for the defense of our country, for our economic future," Lundstrom told VOA.


Amid the buzz of activity in a laboratory on Purdue's campus, visitors can get a vision of what the future might look like in microchip technology.


"The key metrics of the performance of the chips actually are the size of the transistors, the devices, which is the building block of the computer chips," said Zhihong Chen, director of Purdue's Birck Nanotechnology Center, where engineers work around the clock to push microchip technology into the future.


"We are talking about a few atoms in each silicon transistor these days. And this is what this whole facility is about," Chen said. "We are trying to make the next generation transistors better devices than current technologies. More powerful and more energy-efficient computer chips of the future."


Not just RVs anymore


Because of Purdue's efforts, along with those on other university campuses in the state, Indiana believes it's an attractive location for manufacturers looking to build new microchip facilities.


"Purdue University alone, a top four-ranked engineering school, offers more engineers every year than the next top three," said Eric Holcomb, Indiana's Republican governor. "When you have access to that kind of talent, when you have access to the cost of doing business in the state of Indiana, that's why people are increasingly saying, Indiana."


Holcomb is in the final year of his eight-year tenure in the state's top position. He wants to transform Indiana beyond the recreational vehicle, or "RV capital" of the country.


"We produce about plus-80% of all the RV production in North America in one state," he told VOA. "We are not just living up to our reputation as being the number one manufacturing state per capita in America, but we are increasingly embracing the future of mobility in America."


Holcomb is spearheading an effort to make Indiana the next great technology center as the U.S. ramps up investment in domestic microchip development and manufacturing. "If we want to compete globally, we have to get smarter and healthier and more equipped, and we have to continue to invest in our quality of place," Holcomb told VOA in an interview.


His vision is shared by other lawmakers, including U.S. Senator Todd Young of Indiana, who co-sponsored the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act, which commits more than $50 billion in federal funding for domestic microchip development.


'We are committed'


Indiana is now home to one of 31 designated U.S. technology and innovation hubs, helping it qualify for hundreds of millions of dollars in grants designed to attract technology-driven businesses.


"The signal that it sends to the rest of the world [is] that we are in it, we are committed, and we are focused," said Holcomb. "We understand that economic development, economic security and national security complement one another."


Indiana's efforts are paying off.


In April, South Korean microchip manufacturer SK Hynix announced it was planning to build a $4 billion facility near Purdue University that would produce next-generation, high-bandwidth memory, or HBM chips, critical for artificial intelligence applications.


The facility, slated to start operating in 2028, could create more than 1,000 new jobs. While U.S. chip manufacturer SkyWater also plans to invest nearly $2 billion in Indiana's new LEAP Innovation District near Purdue, the state recently lost bidding to host chipmaker Intel, which selected Ohio for two new factories.


"Companies tend to like to go to locations where there is already that infrastructure, where that supply chain is in place," Purdue's Lundstrom said. "That's a challenge for us, because this is a new industry for us. So, we have a chicken-and- egg problem that we have to address, and we are beginning to address that."


Lundstrom said the CHIPS and Science Act and the federal money that comes with it are helping Indiana ramp up to compete with other U.S. locations already known for microchip development, such as Silicon Valley in California and Arizona.


What could help Indiana gain an edge is its natural resources — plenty of land and water, and regular weather patterns, all crucial for the sensitive processes needed to manufacture microchips at large manufacturing centers.

<p>This was the place where I started development of what became <a href="http://frontier.userland.com">Frontier</a>. I always wanted to do a great system level scripting thing, based on what I learned from Unix and what I loved about the graphic user interface. </p>
<p>It became a lot bigger than I anticipated. In the beginning it was meant to be a replacement for the Macintosh Finder, with an outliner for a file system browser, and of course a fantastic scripting ability, of the OS and of scriptable apps. I wish Apple had supported this effort but I didn't understand at the time that they couldn't. They weren't set up to let anyone but Bill and Andy make great products, even if their products weren't all that great, imho of course. You have to live with the mythology you create. </p>
<p>A lot of people got their first programming experience with Hypercard. I would have loved if more of them get their first experience with Frontier. Even better would have been if our products worked together, but that wasn't in the cards either. </p>

## Biden, Marcos announce infrastructure plans to counter Chinese projects

date: 2024-04-11, from: VOA News USA

washington — Months after Manila withdrew from China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) projects, Washington announced a set of infrastructure projects in the Philippines, the first under an initiative to accelerate investments in partner countries in the Indo-Pacific.


The infrastructure projects, known as PGI Luzon corridor, were announced by U.S. President Joe Biden as he hosted Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida at the White House on Thursday. 


"It means more jobs for people across the entire region," Biden said. "It means more investment in sectors critical to our future clean energy, ports, railroads, agriculture and much more." 


Marcos is seen as much closer to Washington than his predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte. Last year, he skipped a BRI summit in Beijing that marked the 10th anniversary of China’s $1 trillion international infrastructure-building program.


"We seek to identify ways of growing our economies and making them more resilient, climate-proofing our cities and our societies, sustaining our development progress," he said at the trilateral summit. 


PGI is an initialism for Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, an initiative that offers grants, federal financing and private sector investment to partner countries. It was launched in 2021 by the U.S. and G7 partners under the title “Build Back Better World” and billed as an alternative to China’s BRI.


PGI Luzon corridor


PGI Luzon corridor is the first project of its kind in the Indo-Pacific and will “connect Subic Bay, Clark, Manila and Batangas in the Philippines to accelerate coordinated investments in high-impact infrastructure projects, including ports, rail, clean energy, semiconductors, supply chains and other forms of connectivity in the Philippines,” a senior administration official said during a briefing on Wednesday. The official asked for anonymity in speaking to reporters.


The official did not provide more details on the project but noted “it will take some time” to secure investments. She highlighted a recent U.S. trade and investment mission to the Philippines that announced “more than $1 billion” in combined investments to promote the Philippines’ innovation economy, clean energy transition and supply chain resilience.


Rebecca Ray, senior researcher with the Global China Initiative at the Boston University Global Development Policy Center, said that PGI Luzon corridor could lead to “healthy competition among major sources of lending and investment globally.”


Those lending sources now recognize that developing countries “need support in overcoming hard infrastructure bottlenecks for industrialization," she told VOA.


The U.S. and Japan will also provide funding for technology in the Philippines that will improve wireless communication throughout the region, the official said.


In addition, the official said, the Development Finance Corporation, a U.S. development bank that partners with the private sector, will open its first regional office in the Philippines.


If the U.S. can sustain its focus and investments, PGI will be quite beneficial to the Philippines, said Derek Grossman, a senior analyst at the Rand Corporation, an American global policy research group.


“That said, we have seen numerous funding battles to get funds passed through Congress on these types of programs,” he told VOA. “And thus, this essential part is hardly guaranteed.”


Manila out of BRI


As ties with Beijing become increasingly strained over territorial disputes in the South China Sea, Manila announced in November that it has given up on Chinese funding for three major transportation projects, expressing confidence in securing financial backing elsewhere.


Even so, Chinese investment in the Philippines does not appear to be waning, Ray said, citing Chinese firm Yadea’s 2023 announcement of a $1 billion investment in e-motorcycle manufacturing, the second-largest investment in the Philippines for the year.


The Biden administration said it mobilized billions of dollars of U.S. private sector investments in the Indo-Pacific, including from Vena Energy, a company developing 2.4GW of renewable-energy projects in the Philippines.

## How Russia's disinformation campaign seeps into US views

date: 2024-04-11, from: VOA News USA

Washington — On a near daily basis, Scott Cullinane talks with members of Congress about Russia's war in Ukraine. As a lobbyist for the nonprofit Razom, part of his job is to convince them of Ukraine's need for greater U.S. support to survive.


But as lawmakers debated a $95 billion package that includes about $60 billion in aid for Ukraine, Cullinane noticed an increase in narratives alleging Ukrainian corruption. What stood out is that these were the same talking points promoted by Russian disinformation.


So, when The Washington Post published an investigation into an extensive and coordinated Russian campaign to influence U.S. public opinion to deny Ukraine the aid, Cullinane says he was not surprised.


"This problem has been festering and growing for years," he told VOA. "I believe that Russia's best chance for victory is not on the battlefield, but through information operations targeted on Western capitals, including Washington."




The Post investigation is based on more than 100 documents collected by a European intelligence service.


The files exposed a Kremlin-linked campaign in which "political strategists and trolls have written thousands of fabricated news articles, social media posts and comments that promote American isolationism, stir fear over the United States' border security and attempt to amplify U.S. economic and racial tensions," the Post reported.


Social media


One of the main methods for spreading such disinformation is social media, according to Roman Osadchuk, a researcher at the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab and an expert on propaganda and influence campaigns.


"The process begins with a Russian publication on a small website or social media account. This is then picked up by a small Russian Telegram channel, which is subsequently shared by a larger channel with more subscribers," Osadchuk said.


From there, someone will translate the content into English and share it, for example, on X.


"This is how Russian disinformation can quickly spread within the English-speaking X community," Osadchuk said.


In an article published April 8, The Washington Post cited Microsoft and the social media intelligence company Graphika as saying that some articles created within this operation could have been first published on sites known as doppelgangers.


Osadchuk told VOA that these are deceptive replicas of legitimate media websites. They feature fake articles and are often taken down, only to be replaced by clones with slightly different web addresses.


"Nobody would know about these sites' existence unless they are promoted on social media platforms. However, as soon as they detect them, social media block them. So, Russians quickly replace banned sites with their clones," he said.


Worldwide effect


In interviews with U.S. media, two influential Republicans said they believe the propaganda has influenced their base and some of their colleagues.


"It is absolutely true. We see, directly coming from Russia, attempts to mask communications that are anti-Ukraine and pro-Russia messages, some of which we even hear being uttered on the House floor," House Intelligence Committee Chair Mike Turner said in an interview with CNN.


In an interview with the U.S. news website Puck, Michael McCaul, head of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said, "Russian propaganda has made its way into the U.S., unfortunately, and it's infected a good chunk of my party's base."




Serhiy Kudelia, a political scientist at Baylor University, says the Kremlin messaging is effective because it plays on existing fears.


He says the disinformation seeks to reinforce already held beliefs such as the wastefulness of aid to Ukraine, or fuels existing anger and energizes opposition to sending assistance.


"When such alignment occurs, it is easier to push through disinformation and invented news stories that would be accepted as credible by a large number of people, including members of Congress, since they reinforce their prior beliefs," Kudelia said.


"Once fabricated stories enter mainstream public debates, they become almost impossible to debunk or separate truth from lies," he said.


The disinformation campaign is similar to ones seen in Europe. Both seek to decrease support for Ukraine, undermine public trust in their institutions and polarize society, says Jakub Kalenský, a senior analyst at Helsinki-based European Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats.


Kalenský, who is deputy director of the center's Hybrid Influence team, believes the Kremlin's disinformation activities have a significant effect on politics worldwide.


"This is why Russia employs thousands of people for this activity. This is why they spend billions every year, because they see it works," he said.


But Olga Belogolova, director of the Emerging Technologies Initiative at Johns Hopkins University, says that it is hard to know how effective these propaganda efforts are.


"Russian influence operations are not necessarily always designed to get people to believe anything in particular, but to get them to believe nothing at all," she told VOA. Belogolova added that claims of the efforts being successful in swaying opinion "is not only irresponsible, it's dangerous."


Countermeasures needed


Last month, the U.S. Treasury Department issued sanctions on two people and two companies that it says are connected to a "foreign malign influence campaign." They include Moscow-based Social Design Agency, its founder Ilya Gambashidze, Russia-based Group Structura LLC and its CEO Nikolai Tupikin.


The Social Design Agency and Gambashidze are believed to be involved in the campaign described in the Post article on April 8.




Kalenský advises governments on countering disinformation and says its success requires countermeasures.


These include strengthening detection and documentation of Russian disinformation campaigns, increasing awareness and resilience of audiences to the propaganda efforts, and preventing the aggressor from exploiting weaknesses of social media and societies.


"Finally, we need to impose higher costs on the information aggressors. So far, they are almost unopposed in conducting their aggression," Kalenský said.


For Cullinane, the Russian disinformation campaign makes his job harder. He says the debate about the role the U.S. should play in the world appears to be shifting and invoking pre-World War II isolationism.


But he remains resolute. Part of his work is finding what resonates most with each lawmaker.


"Some offices focus very much on the human rights situation in Ukraine. Many members are very moved by the plight of religious communities in occupied territories of Ukraine and the persecution they face at the hands of the Russian military," Cullinane said. "Other offices are very intrigued by the military reform and the military innovation brought about by an active war in Ukraine."


The national security spending bill is currently awaiting approval in the House.

## GNU Hurd ported to AArch64, and more Hurd news

date: 2024-04-11, from: OS News

Hurd, the kernel that is supposed to form the basis of the GNU operating system, is perpetually a research project that doesn&#8217;t get anywhere close to being a replacement for Linux, but that doesn&#8217;t mean the project doesn&#8217;t make progress and has a place in the world of operating systems. Their most recent major improvement has been porting GNU Hurd to AArch64, spearheaded by Hurd developer Sergey Bugaev. Since then, however, I have been (some may say, relentlessly) working on filling in the missing piece, namely porting GNU Mach (with important help &#38; contributions by Luca D.). I am happy to report that we now have an experimental port of GNU Mach that builds and works on AArch64! While that may sound impressive, note that various things about it are in an extremely basic, proof-of-concept state rather than being seriously production-ready; and also that Mach is a small kernel (indeed, a microkernel), and it was designed from the start (back in the 80s) to be portable, so most of the &#8220;buisness logic&#8221; functionality (virtual memory, IPC, tasks/threads/scheduler) is explicitly arch-independent. Despite the scary &#8220;WIP proof-of-concept&#8221; status, there is enough functionality in Mach to run userland code, handle exceptions and syscalls, interact with the MMU to implement all the expected virtual memory semantics, schedule/switch tasks and threads, and so on. Moreover, all of GNU Mach&#8217;s userspace self-tests pass! ↫ Sergey Bugaev On top of all this, glibc works on the AArch64 port, and several important Hurd servers work as well, namely ext2fs, exec, startup, auth, and proc, as a do a number of basic UNIX programs. This is an exceptional effort, and highlights that while people tend to make fun of Hurd, it&#8217;s got some real talent working on it that bring the platform forward. While we may not see any widely usable release any time soon, every bit of progress helps and is welcome. Speaking of progress, the progress report for GNU Hurd covering the first quarter of 2024 has also been published, and it lists a number of other improvements and fixes made aside from the AArch64 port. For instance, the console will now use xkbcommon instead of X11 for handling keyboard layouts, which reduced code complexity a lot and improved keyboard layout coverage, to boot. The port of GDB to the 64 bit version of Hurd is also progressing, and SMP has seen a ton of fixes too. Another awesome bit of news comes from, once again, Sergey Bugaev, as he announced a new Hurd distribution based on Alpine Linux. Work on this project has only recently begun, but he&#8217;s already had some success and about 299 Alpine packages are available. His reasons for starting this new project is that while Debian GNU/Hurd is a great base to work from for Hurd users and developers, Debian is also a bit strict and arcane in its packaging requirements, which might make sense for Debian GNU/Linux, but is annoying to work with when you&#8217;re trying to get a lot of low-level work done. For now, there&#8217;s no name yet, and he&#8217;s asking for help from the Hurd community for name ideas, hosting, and so on. That&#8217;s a lot of GNU Hurd progress this quarter, and that&#8217;s good news.

Every Trump budget included cuts to these programs. The Trump administration rewrote emissions standards, attempted to prevent states from enforcing more stringent guidance, and reduced the social cost of carbon. Project 2025 outlines most of these same changes and more.</p><p>Environmental and climate-focused groups played a key role in fighting those climate policies last time around. Along with state attorneys general, these groups filed lawsuits against regulatory changes and worked with business groups to build support for federal action on climate. The game plan, say people working for some of those same climate advocacy groups today, would be much the same for round two.</p><p>At the same time, though, the political questions have grown more complex, even for programs once considered ideologically neutral. If Republicans control one or both houses of Congress, in addition to the White House, how will climate advocates convince Republican lawmakers even to preserve existing law, let alone continue advancing a decarbonization agenda?</p><p>After talking with four different climate-focused groups — the Sierra Club, Evergreen Action, Third Way, and the Energy Futures Initiative Foundation, each of which has a different approach to clean energy advocacy — I was left with four takeaways for how they’ll attempt to handle a second Trump administration.</p><h3>1) Planning for a second Trump administration means, in part, staying focused on the present</h3><p>No organization I contacted provided a specific plan for a second Trump administration. But Sierra Club, Evergreen, and Third Way all said they’re working on dual tracks, charting a course to continue supporting the Biden administration’s climate policy both now, as the administration <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/bidens-unfinished-climate-agenda" target="_self"><u>scrambles</u></a> to <a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/eenews/2024/02/21/greens-draft-playbook-for-a-second-trump-term-00141985" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>finalize regulations</u></a>, and under a potential second term from <em><em>either</em></em> Biden <em><em>or</em></em> Trump. </p><p>“There’s certainly planning going on amongst enviros, as there always is around these times, of what the next four years could look like,” both for a Biden and for a Trump presidency, Patrick Drupp, Sierra Club's director of climate policy, told me. “We should be prepared that every single thing we liked and praised in [the Biden] administration would come under fire” in the event of a Trump victory, he added.</p><p>A second Trump administration would, for instance, almost certainly attempt to scale back new rules on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/07/climate/epa-air-pollution-soot.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>soot pollution</u></a>, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/04/05/biden-epa-coal-plants-mercury/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>mercury and air toxics</u></a> standards at power plants, and the recently <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/epa-auto-emissions-rule" target="_self"><u>tightened limits</u></a> on tailpipe emissions, Drupp said — effectively “<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/trump-epa-car-rules" target="_self"><u>anything at EPA</u></a>.”</p><p>Drupp’s team is working to game out what policies and rollbacks might come first. If and when they happen, the Sierra Club will swing into action to explain “what it means when you roll back these regulations,” he said. “They have important real-life consequences for folks.” Sierra Cub also has a whole legal team separate from Drupp’s policy shop, and he said his colleagues would very likely sue to block efforts like these, as well. </p><p>Evergreen will make its case against Trump — i.e. “explain why bad ideas are bad,” as Craig Segall, vice president at Evergreen Action, a climate policy and advocacy offshoot of Jay Inslee’s 2020 presidential campaign, put it to me. </p><p>“This is an election that matters on geologic timescales,” Segall said. “It’s our job to put forward that case — and also to talk about how the Biden administration and the states can and should do better in a second term.” Segall pointed to <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/whitmer/news/press-releases/2023/11/28/governor-whitmer-signs-historic-clean-energy-climate-action-package" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Michigan’s new clean energy standard</u></a> as an example of aggressive state policy that would be difficult for a Trump administration to undermine. And he highlighted Georgia as a state less ideologically interested in climate change but still benefiting from clean power investment.</p><h3>2) The IRA is not Obamacare</h3><p>Then there’s the Inflation Reduction Act. Project 2025’s chapter on the Department of Energy lists repealing IRA as its first specific policy goal. While the IRA has helped <a href="https://www.wri.org/insights/clean-energy-progress-united-states" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>drive</u></a> the largest buildout of clean energy in American history, as of 2023, most Americans hadn’t heard of it, according to a <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/inflation-reduction-act-popularity-repeal" target="_self"><u>Heatmap poll</u></a>. </p><p>Without the IRA, growth in renewables would continue, Ryan Fitzpatrick, Third Way’s senior director of domestic policy for climate and energy, told me. But it wouldn’t continue at the same pace, putting the U.S. behind on emissions reductions targets and limiting its ability to keep up in a global competition to manufacture clean energy technology. </p><p>The IRA’s success — and survival — could depend on the extent to which Republican lawmakers are willing to quietly embrace it, as Emily Pontecorvo <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/inflation-reduction-act-threats-trump" target="_self"><u>pointed out</u></a> last summer. With significant investments flowing to the <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/inflation-reduction-act-updates-biden" target="_self"><u>Republican-led Battery Belt</u></a> states, one line of argument would posit that red state politicians have incentives to protect economic activity in their district.</p><p>Members of Congress might be enthusiastic about budget cuts in the abstract, but when those budget cuts come to their districts, those members lose interest, argued David Ellis, a senior vice president of policy and outreach at the Energy Futures Initiative Foundation. Given how much the uptake of IRA’s tax credits has <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/featured-stories/the-inflation-reduction-acts-benefits-and-costs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>outpaced</u></a> initial projections, Ellis described it as among the most immediately impactful pieces of legislation passed in recent memory. That will make it “very hard to undo,” he said.</p><p>There are reasons to think that line of reasoning might not hold up — a University of Texas at Austin study showed that Texas state senators with renewable energy investment in their districts <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/renewable-energy-texas-senate-voting" target="_self"><u>were no more likely to support</u></a> pro-renewables policy than senators without. Republicans will likely try to overturn the IRA regardless of the political implications, Drupp said. “How long did it take before Republicans stopped trying to overturn Obamacare?” he said. “I think it's similar.”</p><p>It took until 2017, seven years after President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law, for that legislation to achieve majority <a href="https://www.kff.org/interactive/kff-health-tracking-poll-the-publics-views-on-the-aca/#?response=Favorable--Unfavorable&aRange=all" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>approval</u></a> in tracking polls. That uptick in sentiment came as Congress very nearly repealed the law, before a handful of Republican senators famously squashed those efforts. </p><p>But the ACA wasn’t just popular because Republicans were trying to repeal it. Its approval ratings also came from the fact that Americans were feeling the impact of the law, Sarah Kliff and Dylan Scott <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/7/31/16055960/why-obamacare-repeal-failed" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>argued</u></a> for <em><em>Vox</em></em> in 2017.</p><p>The analogy between the IRA and the ACA is imperfect, Fitzpatrick said. Still, it underscores the basic political principle at play. If more Americans can understand the benefits the IRA offers them, they’ll be more hesitant to overturn it.</p><p>“For that comparison to hold, the average American person, family, business owner has to be able to see a real impact on the things they care most about,” Fitzpatrick said. If Americans can understand the pocketbook and energy reliability impacts of the IRA in addition to its impact on climate, that could put it off-limits. </p><p>Third Way is trying to <a href="https://www.thirdway.org/polling/beyond-the-climate-voter-how-to-broaden-support-for-clean-energy-in-america" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>emphasize</u></a> to Democrats that they, in turn, need to emphasize the benefits of the IRA when they talk to voters. “We also need to make sure that advocates, people who are influential in communities across the country, understand not just that this isn't just a lefty priority,” Fiztpatrick said, noting Third Way’s work with educational organizations aimed at grassroots audiences. “This isn't just about climate change. There are benefits that are reaching them in their communities.”</p><p>Along with labor groups, business will also prove to be another key constituency in any fight over the IRA, Segall told me. IRA repeal is “clearly a high priority” for some conservative lawmakers — but “there are now billion-dollar industries that are correctly reckoning they have to decarbonize to stay competitive,” he said. Nissan and General Motors, for instance, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2e714798-e5ae-4227-b8f0-a44afece29ef" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>told the </u><u><em><em>Financial Times</em></em></u></a> that the end of the IRA might spell trouble for their American electric vehicle businesses.</p><h3>3) Some things are in Congress’s hands</h3><p>The president cannot unilaterally eliminate either a department or a Congressionally authorized office within a department. But Congress can. </p><p>Republicans controlled at least one house of Congress for all four years of the Trump administration, and yet proposed cuts to EERE, ARPA-E, and other climate-focused offices in the Department of Energy never came to fruition. In 2017, six Senate Republicans — including Sen. Lindsey Graham and former Sen. Lamar Alexander, then chair of the Senate appropriations subcommittee for DOE — wrote a letter to <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/key-republican-lawmakers-urge-trump-not-cut-doe-research" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>express</u></a> their support for the programs. </p><p>“Energy investment across the board came out of the first Trump administration, if not unscathed, certainly less damaged than other parts of the government,” Ellis said.</p><p>Next time around, Project 2025 calls for eliminating the DOE’s Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, its Office of State and Community Energy Programs, ARPA-E, the Office of Grid Deployment, and its loan program, and EERE. But just because things didn’t go according to plan last time doesn’t mean those programs are safe. </p><p>Ellis told me that Congressional Republicans are now much more beholden to the Trump platform than they were in 2017. “The early signs are not good that a Republican Congress would do anything to restrain Donald Trump, given the fact that they're falling in lockstep behind him,” he said. That leaves the offices that have served as incubators and provided funding for nascent clean energy technologies and projects more vulnerable than before.</p><p>Sen. Alexander retired in 2021. The new ranking Republican on the subcommittee that handles DOE appropriations is Louisiana Sen. John Kennedy, who has <a href="https://twitter.com/SenJohnKennedy/status/1542603084546932740" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>criticized</u></a> the Biden administration’s energy policy but has not called loudly for cuts.</p><p>Fitzpatrick said he’s hopeful that a bipartisan group of lawmakers will step in to prevent anything drastic — but he noted that could be more challenging given what he described as the “ideological bent” Trump has projected onto research and development funding for energy, which had previously enjoyed consistent bipartisan support. One example: The Energy Act of 2020, which Ellis described as a “smorgasboard of bipartisan energy innovation efforts,” which passed under Trump. </p><p>Third Way, he noted, will look to educate a wide range of policymakers — key appropriators included — on the benefits of various DOE programs.</p><p>Even if Congress holds budgets relatively stable, a Trump DOE will have bureaucratic levers to pull to slow the work, both Fitzpatrick and Drupp said. That could mean allowing workforce attrition, sitting on reports, gumming up the process of offshore wind approvals, rubber-stamping new fossil fuel infrastructure, failing to conduct research directed by appropriations, or slowing the pace of loans.</p><p>A Trump administration could also wipe out hallmark Biden policies by executive order, such as the Justice40 initiative to bring 40% of the benefits of federal climate and clean energy investments to disadvantaged communities, Ellis added. (Project 2025 does not call for its elimination, but calls it an “innocuous”-sounding program that runs the risk of politicizing energy.)<br/></p><h3>4) Green groups will have to share the load</h3><p>Project 2025 lays out a long list of changes for the Environmental Protection Agency: Pausing any research contract worth over $100,000, closing the Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights, preventing California from enforcing emissions restrictions on greenhouse gasses, and making it easier for the agency to approve pesticides.</p><p>Many more regulations — surrounding ozone and particulate pollution, mercury and air toxin pollution, heavy duty truck emission standards — could be rolled back or changed, said Drupp.</p><p>“It becomes hard when everything you love and care about is under attack,” he told me. “How do you prioritize that?” Collaboration will prove critical, Drupp noted — different organizations will attempt to figure out how best to allocate their resources. </p><p>During the first Trump administration, the “big greens,” community groups, and dozens of states filed lawsuits that helped stifle regulatory changes, Segall pointed out. The length of the regulatory process will extend the time horizon of any possible regulatory change. Although the Trump administration announced its intent to repeal the Clean Power Plan in 2017, it failed to unveil a new plan before 2019. That plan, in turn, remained tied up in court until one day before <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/01/19/federal-circuit-court-scraps-trump-administration-power-plant-rules/" target="_blank"><u>Joe Biden’s inauguration</u></a>.</p>

## Humane AI pins review confirm what we already expected: it’s useless trash

date: 2024-04-11, from: OS News

I didn&#8217;t want to spend too much time on this thing, but I feel like we can all use a good laugh at a stupid product hyped only by the tech media. The Verge reviewed the Humane AI pin, and entirely predictably, it&#8217;s a complete and utter trashfire. But until all of that happens, and until the whole AI universe gets better, faster, and more functional, the AI Pin isn’t going to feel remotely close to being done. It’s a beta test, a prototype, a proof of concept that maybe someday there might be a killer device that does all of these things. I know with absolute certainty that the AI Pin is not that device. It’s not worth $700, or $24 a month, or all the time and energy and frustration that using it requires. It’s an exciting idea and an infuriating product.&#160; AI gadgets might one day be great. But this isn’t that day, and the AI Pin isn’t that product. I’ll take my phone back now, thanks. ↫ David Pierce at The Verge It takes dozens of seconds to reply to any query, the battery is severely lacking, the answers you get are mostly wrong or useless, sending text messages is effectively broken, and tons of promised features don&#8217;t work because they&#8217;re not implemented. In another video review, MrMobile also shows the device overheating all the time, a problem that&#8217;s common to all of the devices. I don&#8217;t think trashfire is harsh enough to describe this junk.

## Japanese PM to US lawmakers: US does not have to confront global challenges alone

date: 2024-04-11, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told U.S. lawmakers Thursday the United States does not have to confront serious global challenges alone, saying Tokyo is upgrading its military capabilities to support its ally.


In a joint meeting of the U.S. Congress, Kishida urged the U.S. to continue its role upholding the international order and addressed skepticism among some Republican lawmakers about continuing aid to Ukraine. 


“The leadership of the United States is indispensable. Without U.S. support, how long before the hopes of Ukraine would collapse under the onslaught from Moscow?” Kishida asked during his speech. 


Japan has provided $12 billion in aid to Ukraine, including anti-drone detection systems. Kishida also hosted a conference for Ukraine’s economic growth. 


U.S. lawmakers in support of aid to Ukraine have suggested a failure to confront Russia will send a message to China that it can expand its own ambitions in Taiwan. 




“Across the region, America’s closest regional allies like Australia and South Korea understand the PRC (People’s Republic of China) poses the greatest long-term strategic threat to a free and open Indo-Pacific. But they also understand that what happens in Europe or the Middle East in the near term matters an awful lot to Asia,” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement following Kishida’s address. 


A $96 billion supplemental security package providing aid to Ukraine and Indo-Pacific countries confronting Chinese aggression, passed the Democratic-majority Senate but has been stalled for months in the House of Representatives, which is narrowly controlled by Republicans. 


Kishida’s plea to U.S. lawmakers comes as part of a three-day state visit to Washington. On Wednesday, Kishida met with President Joe Biden and announced a number of new defense partnerships between the two countries. 


The decades-long alliance between the U.S. and Japan is widely seen as key to countering Chinese aggression. Kishida acknowledged the partnership with the U.S. and broader regional alliances Thursday. 


“Without the presence of the United States, how long before the Indo-Pacific would face even harsher realities?” Kishida said in his address. “Our alliance serves as a force multiplier and together with these like-minded countries, we are working to realize a free and open Indo-Pacific,” he said.

## Assemble the Bodyguard of Lies: Strengthening U.S. Military Deception Capabilities

date: 2024-04-11, updated: 2024-04-11, from: RAND blog

Few aspects of warfare are as valuable as efforts to deceive adversaries. The U.S. military inevitably will face rivals who use deception to their advantage, so it should once again hone its own subterfuge skills—from the lowest levels, to gain a tactical edge, to the highest, to achieve strategic surprise.

## So it begins: Microsoft starts showing full-screen ads about the end of Windows 10 support

date: 2024-04-11, from: OS News

We are about 18 months away from the end of mainstream Windows 10 support, but Microsoft thinks it is time to start nagging warning Windows 10 users about the inevitable. Users on Reddit report spotting a new full-screen ad with a notification that Windows 10 is about to reach its end of life in October 2025, even though it is still getting new features (there are even rumors about Microsoft re-opening the Windows Insider Program for Windows 10). ↫ Taras Buria at Neowin I mean, I have a long history of crying foul over Windows being adware now, but I don&#8217;t think warning users that their operating system is losing support and that they should upgrade to a new version really constitutes an ad. Sure, technically it does, but I think we can all agree that such a warning is useful and informative.

## Russia's Disinformation Campaign About the Moscow Terror Attack May Be Working

date: 2024-04-11, updated: 2024-04-11, from: RAND blog

As far-fetched as it may seem to those in the West, the Kremlin's claim that the recent terrorist attack on a Moscow concert hall was orchestrated by Ukraine and Western powers may be convincing to many Russians. For the U.S. to address and combat these claims, it is important to understand how they are framed amid broadly propagated themes, and how these could influence their potential appeal to large swaths of the Russian public.

## FBI fears 'coordinated attack' on US homeland

date: 2024-04-11, from: VOA News USA

Washington — A surge of confidence by supporters of the Islamic State terror group — reflected in a series of online threats against Europe combined with its deadly attack on a concert hall in Russia — is giving security officials in the United States cause for concern.


National security and law enforcement officials have long been worried about small groups or individuals drawing inspiration from terror plots around the world to conduct attacks in the U.S. But FBI Director Christopher Wray told lawmakers Thursday that something more worrisome may be in the works.


“Now increasingly concerning is the potential for a coordinated attack here in the homeland, akin to the ISIS-K attack we saw at the Russia concert hall a couple weeks ago,” Wray warned lawmakers, using an acronym for the Islamic State’s Afghan affiliate. 


Just days ago, police agencies across Europe boosted security after media outlets linked to Islamic State, also known as IS or ISIS, posted calls to attack stadiums hosting Champions League soccer matches this week in Madrid, London and Paris.




The FBI warning also signals a potential shift in U.S. thinking about the possible reach of IS and its Afghan affiliate, which claimed responsibility for the March 22 attack on the Crocus City concert hall outside Moscow. The attack killed 145 people.


Following the incident, the Department of Homeland Security said it had no specific or credible intelligence to suggest IS had the ability to threaten the United States.




And multiple U.S. military and intelligence officials have said that while IS has ambitions to carry out attacks, there have been no indications IS or any of its global affiliates has the capability to reach into the U.S. homeland.


The terror group is "struggling in many ways to mount a major capability that is relevant to the United States," said National Counterterrorism Center Director Christine Abizaid recently. She spoke during an appearance on the In the Room podcast with terrorism analyst Peter Bergen.




Other warnings have focused on the threat to U.S. targets outside the United States.


"ISIS-Khorasan retains the capability and will to attack U.S. and Western interests abroad in as little as six months and with little to no warning," General Michael “Erik” Kurilla, the commander of U.S. forces in the Middle East and South Asia, told a Senate committee hearing last month.


For now, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security is urging Americans to be wary.


“The U.S. continues to be in a heightened threat environment,” a DHS spokesperson told VOA Wednesday in response to questions about the IS threats to various European venues.


“DHS continues to work with our partners to evaluate the threat environment, provide updates to the American public, and protect our homeland,” the spokesperson added. “We urge the public to stay vigilant and to promptly report suspicious activity to their local law enforcement.”

## O.J. Simpson, football star turned celebrity murder defendant, dies at 76

date: 2024-04-11, from: VOA News USA

Washington — O.J. Simpson, the American football star and actor who was acquitted in a sensational 1995 trial of murdering his former wife but was found responsible for her death in a civil lawsuit and was later imprisoned for armed robbery and kidnapping, has died at the age of 76.


Simpson, cleared by a Los Angeles jury in what the U.S. media called "the trial of the century," had died on Wednesday after a battle with cancer, his family posted on social media on Thursday.


Simpson avoided prison when he was found not guilty in the 1994 stabbing deaths of former wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman in Los Angeles. Simpson later served nine years in a Nevada prison after being convicted in 2008 on 12 counts of armed robbery and kidnapping two sports memorabilia dealers at gunpoint in a Las Vegas hotel.


Nicknamed "The Juice," Simpson was one of the best and most popular athletes of the late 1960s and 1970s. He overcame childhood infirmity to become an electrifying running back at the University of Southern California and won the Heisman Trophy as college football's top player. After a record-setting career in the NFL with the Buffalo Bills and San Francisco 49ers, he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.


Simpson parlayed his football stardom into a career as a sportscaster, advertising pitchman and Hollywood actor in films including the "Naked Gun" series.


All that changed after Nicole Brown Simpson and Goldman were found fatally slashed in a bloody scene outside her Los Angeles home on June 12, 1994.


Simpson quickly emerged as a suspect. He was ordered to surrender to police but five days after the killings, he fled in his white Ford Bronco with a former teammate - carrying his passport and a disguise. A slow-speed chase through the Los Angeles area ended at Simpson's mansion and he was later charged in the murders.


What ensued was one of the most notorious trials in 20th century America and a media circus. It had everything: a rich celebrity defendant; a Black man accused of killing his white former wife out of jealousy; a woman slain after divorcing a man who had beaten her; a "dream team" of pricy and charismatic defense lawyers; and a huge gaffe by prosecutors.


Simpson, who at the outset of the case declared himself "absolutely 100 percent not guilty," waved at the jurors and mouthed the words "thank you" after the predominately Black panel of 10 women and two men acquitted him on Oct. 3, 1995.


Prosecutors argued that Simpson killed Nicole in a jealous fury, and they presented extensive blood, hair and fiber tests linking Simpson to the murders. The defense countered that the celebrity defendant was framed by racist white police.


The trial transfixed America. In the White House, President Bill Clinton left the Oval Office and watched the verdict on his secretary's TV. Many Black Americans celebrated his acquittal, seeing Simpson as the victim of bigoted police. Many white Americans were appalled by his exoneration.




Simpson's legal team included prominent criminal defense lawyers Johnnie Cochran, Alan Dershowitz and F. Lee Bailey, who often out-maneuvered the prosecution. Prosecutors committed a memorable blunder when they directed Simpson to try on a pair of blood-stained gloves found at the murder scene, confident they would fit perfectly and show he was the killer.


In a highly theatrical demonstration, Simpson struggled to put on the gloves and indicated to the jury they did not fit.


Delivering the trial's most famous words, Cochran referred to the gloves in closing arguments to jurors with a rhyme: "If it doesn't fit, you must acquit." Dershowitz later called the prosecution decision to ask Simpson to try on the gloves "the greatest legal blunder of the 20th century."


"What this verdict tells you is how fame and money can buy the best defense, can take a case of overwhelming incriminating physical evidence and transform it into a case riddled with reasonable doubt," Peter Arenella, a UCLA law professor, told the New York Times after the verdict.


"A predominantly African-American jury was more susceptible to claims of police incompetence and corruption and more willing to impose a higher burden of proof than normally required for proof beyond a reasonable doubt," Arenella said.


After his acquittal, Simpson said that "I will pursue as my primary goal in life the killer or killers who slayed Nicole and Mr. Goldman... They are out there somewhere... I would not, could not and did not kill anyone."


The Goldman and Brown families subsequently pursued a wrongful death lawsuit against Simpson in civil court. In 1997, a predominately white jury in Santa Monica, California, found Simpson liable for the two deaths and ordered him to pay $33.5 million in damages.


"We finally have justice for Ron and Nicole," Fred Goldman, Ron Goldman's father, said after the verdict.


Simpson's "dream team" did not represent him in the civil trial in which the burden of proof was lower than in a criminal trial - a "preponderance of the evidence" rather than "beyond a reasonable doubt." New evidence also hurt Simpson, including photographs of him wearing the type of shoes that had left bloody footprints at the murder scene.


After the civil case, some of Simpson's belongings, including memorabilia from his football days, were taken and auctioned off to help pay the damages he owed.


On Oct. 3, 2008, exactly 13 years after his acquittal in the murder trial, he was convicted by a Las Vegas jury on charges including kidnapping and armed robbery. These stemmed from a 2007 incident at a casino hotel in which Simpson and five men, at least two carrying guns, stole sports memorabilia worth thousands of dollars from two dealers.


Simpson said he was just trying to recover his own property but was sentenced to up to 33 years in prison.


"I didn't want to hurt anybody," Simpson, donning a blue prison jumpsuit with shackles on his legs and wrists, said at his sentencing. "I didn't know I was doing anything wrong."


Simpson was released on parole in 2017 and moved into a gated community in Las Vegas. He was granted early release from parole in 2021 due to good behavior at age 74.  


His life saga was recounted in the Oscar-winning 2016 documentary "O.J.: Made in America" as well as various TV dramatizations.


Orenthal James Simpson was born in San Francisco on July 9, 1947. He contracted rickets at age 2 and was forced to wear leg braces until he was 5 but recovered so thoroughly that he became one of the most celebrated football players of all time.


During nine seasons for the Buffalo Bills and two for the San Francisco 49ers, Simpson became one of the greatest ball carriers in NFL history. In 1973, he became the first NFL player to rush for more than 2,000 yards in a season. He retired in 1979.


Simpson also became an advertising pitchman, best known for years of TV commercials for Hertz rental cars. As an actor, he appeared in movies including "The Towering Inferno" (1974), "Capricorn One" (1977) and the "The Naked Gun" cop spoof films in 1988, 1991 and 1994, playing a witless police detective.


Simpson married his first wife, Marguerite, in 1967 and they had three children, including one who drowned in the family's swimming pool at age 2 in 1979, the year the couple divorced.


Simpson met future wife Nicole Brown when she was a 17-year-old waitress and he was still married to Marguerite. Simpson and Brown married in 1985 and had two children. She later called police after incidents in which he struck her. Simpson pleaded no contest to spousal abuse charges in 1989.

## Biden hosts Japanese, Philippine leaders to discuss China’s aggression

date: 2024-04-11, from: VOA News USA

Washington — U.S. President Joe Biden hosted Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. at the White House on Thursday, aiming to send China a clear message that it must halt its aggressive behavior in the South China Sea.


"United States defense commitments to Japan and to the Philippines are ironclad," Biden said at the trilateral summit.


There has been rising tension between Manila and Beijing. In recent weeks, Chinese Coast Guard ships have taken provocative actions to block resupply missions for Philippine soldiers stationed on the Second Thomas Shoal, who guard Manila's sovereignty claims over the Spratly Islands.


"Facing the complex challenges of our time requires concerted efforts on everyone's part, a dedication to a common purpose and an unwavering commitment to the rules-based international order," Marcos said, couching his words in diplomatic terms often used to target Beijing.


"Multilayered cooperation between allies and like-minded countries is essential if we are to maintain and bolster a free and open international order based on the rule of law," Kishida reiterated.




Chinese intimidation known as "gray zone tactics" falls dangerously close to triggering a 1951 mutual defense treaty between Washington and Manila. Biden underscored U.S. commitment to the pact.


"Any attack on Philippine aircraft, vessels or armed forces in the South China Sea will invoke our mutual defense treaty," he said.


The leaders announced new deterrence measures, including on maritime defense, alongside investments in infrastructure projects in the Philippines and collaboration on global humanitarian assistance efforts.


This is Marcos' second time at the Biden White House, following his visit in May last year. He is seen as much more closely aligned with Washington than his predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte.


The Marcos government essentially doubled American access to Philippine bases earlier this year, announcing four new military bases on top of the five existing locations. Manila is also negotiating with Japan for a reciprocal access arrangement to allow Japanese forces on Philippine soil.


Similar situations


Kishida 's country faces similar Chinese gray zone tactics around disputed islands in the East China Sea, called Diaoyu in China and Senkaku in Japan. In a joint address to the U.S. Congress earlier Thursday, he warned of risks from the rise of China and pledged to do more to share defense responsibilities.




Key to the leaders' discussions Thursday is working toward a shared understanding of what constitutes gray zone attacks and the treaty's enforcement threshold.


"We continue to coordinate very closely the question of China's so-called gray zone tactics, its coercive tactics, and what the implications of those might be," a senior administration official said in response to VOA's question during a briefing Wednesday. The official spoke on condition of anonymity.


The U.S.-Philippines treaty extends to "armed attacks on Philippines Armed Forces, public vessels or aircraft," the official underscored. "That includes its Coast Guard, and that includes anywhere in the South China Sea."


Washington has been increasingly concerned about China's actions. While in the region last year, Vice President Kamala Harris stopped by Palawan island in the Philippines, just 330 kilometers east of the disputed Spratly Islands , in a rebuke to Beijing.


Blurring lines of attacks 


China's gray zone tactics have blurred the lines of what are traditionally seen as armed attacks by using force that may not be intentionally lethal, such as military grade lasers, acoustic devices, high-pressure water cannons or simply ramming into ships, said Gregory Poling, director of the Southeast Asia Program and Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.


"The problem is that these things are only nonlethal in a statistical sense," Poling told VOA. "But if you do it enough, you will kill somebody."


Manila and Washington would then need to determine whether to invoke mutual defense under the treaty, he added.


Both sides are realizing that "China has blurred the lines so much with its Coast Guard and militias," he added, saying, "We can't treat China the way we treat normal armed actors, that China intentionally hides its military force behind civilians, and that we need to be more flexible in our responses."


Discussions are ongoing under the Maritime Security Framework signed by the U.S. and the Philippines in 2022. Known also as "Guardian of the Sea," or "Bantay Dagat" in Tagalog, the agreement aims to improve regional maritime domain awareness and confront maritime challenges together.


Last year, the U.S. and Philippine secretaries of defense established guidelines reaffirming that "an armed attack in the Pacific, including anywhere in the South China Sea, on either of their public vessels, aircraft or armed forces — which includes their Coast Guards — would invoke mutual defense commitments under Articles IV and V of the 1951 U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty."


However, there is no clear shared definition of gray zone tactics, which are challenging to incorporate into mutual defense treaties, said Shihoko Goto, director of the Indo-Pacific Program at the Wilson Center.


She told VOA there is greater focus on enhancing cyber defense and other nonkinetic capabilities for deterrence purposes. The summit will clarify established norms of conduct for protecting territorial boundaries, she added.


Dialogue with Beijing


Ahead of their trilateral summit with Marcos, Biden hosted Kishida for meetings and a state dinner Wednesday.


The pair insist on fostering dialogue with Beijing, even as the U.S. and Japan ramp up defense ties.




In their latest phone conversation in April, Biden said he discussed with Chinese President Xi Jinping the "best way to reduce the chances of miscalculation and misunderstanding."


The U.S. alliance with Japan is "purely defensive," Biden said during a joint news conference Wednesday. "It's not aimed at any one nation or a threat to the region."


Speaking through an interpreter Wednesday, Kishida said he and Biden "agreed that our two countries will continue to respond to challenges concerning China through close coordination."


They announced initiatives to enhance bilateral defense ties and maritime cooperation in the South China Sea, as well as joint air missile and defense systems between the U.S., Japan and Australia.


Beijing said it opposes "cobbling together exclusive groupings and stoking bloc confrontation in the region."


"Such practices - patching up small blocs, stirring up confrontation under the excuse of cooperation, upholding peace and order in name but flexing military muscle and stoking chaos in nature - do not meet the trend for peace and development and run counter to the regional countries' shared aspiration for stability and development," Liu Pengyu, a Chinese Embassy spokesperson in the U.S., said in a statement to VOA.


The U.S.-Japan-Philippines trilateral is the first gathering of its kind, part of Biden's strategy to stitch together existing bilateral alliances into these "minilaterals" to amplify U.S. influence in Asia. Last year, he hosted a similar meeting with Japan and South Korea to deal with the threat from North Korea.

## ‘Robust' US has helped improve global economic outlook, IMF chief says

date: 2024-04-11, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Strong growth in the United States has helped to lift the outlook for the world economy, but more needs to be done to stem a slide in productivity, the head of the IMF said Thursday. 


"Global growth is marginally stronger on account of robust activity in the United States and in many emerging markets economies," International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva told reporters in prepared remarks. 


The U.S. economy grew by 2.5 percent last year, according to the U.S. Commerce Department, far outstripping most other advanced economies. 


"Robust household consumption and business investment, and an easing of supply chain problems helped," Georgieva added. "And inflation is going down, somewhat faster than previously expected." 


She spoke just a few days before the IMF-World Bank spring meetings of world financial leaders in Washington, one of two such gatherings hosted each year by the international financial institutions. 


Her remarks suggest the IMF now expects the world economy to grow faster than it predicted in January, when it forecast global growth to rise by 3.1 percent in 2024, and 3.2 percent in 2025. 


"It is tempting to breathe a sigh of relief. We have avoided a global recession and a period of stagflation — as some had predicted," Georgieva said. "But there are still plenty of things to worry about." 


Among the challenges, Georgieva mentioned rising geopolitical tension, which, she said, is increasing the risks of fragmentation of the global economy. 


She also highlighted the challenges of growing public debt and a "broad-based slowdown in productivity." 


Because of this, the IMF expects growth to remain at just above 3 percent over the medium term — below its historical average. 


To help the global economy to heal and fix the productivity challenge, Georgieva laid out a series of steps to bring global inflation and public debt back down to sustainable levels, and also called for steps to eliminate "constraints to economic activity" and boost productivity. 


"In short, if there is a market failure that is being addressed — such as accelerating innovation to address the existential threat of climate change — there is a case for government intervention, including through industrial policy," she said. 


"If there is no market failure, there is a need for caution," she added.

## Meta trials a new feature to protect teens

<p>Meta’s latest answer to protecting kids on Instagram is automatically blurring images that may contain nudity. The company says it will test this on the platform’s direct messaging feature. We&#8217;ll parse the details. Plus, the FCC is requiring large internet providers to post &#8220;broadband nutrition labels&#8221; that provide a snapshot of charges and performance data. Will they impact consumers&#8217; internet diet? And a recent survey finds that CEOs are feeling pretty optimistic.</p>

## China sanctions 2 US defense companies and says they support arms sales to Taiwan

date: 2024-04-11, from: VOA News USA

Beijing — China on Thursday announced rare sanctions against two U.S. defense companies over what it said is their support for arms sales to Taiwan, the self-governing island democracy Beijing claims as its own territory to be recovered by force if necessary.


The announcement freezes the assets of General Atomics Aeronautical Systems and General Dynamics Land Systems held within China. It also bars the companies' management from entering the country. 


Filings show General Dynamics operates a half-dozen Gulfstream and jet aviation services operations in China, which remains heavily reliant on foreign aerospace technology even as it attempts to build its own presence in the field. 


The company helps make the Abrams tank being purchased by Taiwan to replace outdated armor intended to deter or resist an invasion from China. 


General Atomics produces the Predator and Reaper drones used by the U.S. military. Chinese authorities did not go into details on the company's alleged involvement with supplying arms to Taiwan. 


Beijing has long threatened such sanctions, but has rarely issued them as its economy reels from the COVID-19 pandemic, high unemployment and a sharp decline in foreign investment. 


"The continued U.S. arms sales to China's Taiwan region seriously violate the one-China principle and the provisions of the three China-U.S. joint communiqués, interfere in China's internal affairs, and undermine China's sovereignty and territorial integrity," China's Foreign Ministry said in a statement. It insists that the mainland and the island to which Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist forces fled amid civil war in 1949 remain part of a single Chinese nation. 


Sanctions were leveled under Beijing's recently enacted Law of the People's Republic of China on Countering Foreign Sanctions. 


General Dynamics fully owned entities are registered in Hong Kong, the southern Chinese semi-autonomous city over which Beijing has steadily been increasing its political and economic control to the point that it faces no vocal opposition and has seen its critics silenced, imprisoned or forced into exile. 


Despite their lack of formal diplomatic ties — a concession Washington made to Beijing when they established relations in 1979 — the U.S. remains Taiwan's most important source of diplomatic support and supplier of military hardware from fighter jets to air defense systems. 


Taiwan has also been investing heavily in its own defense industry, producing sophisticated missiles and submarines. 


China had 14 warplanes and six navy ships operating around Taiwan on Wednesday and Thursday, with six of the aircraft crossing into Taiwan's air defense identification zone — a tactic to test Taiwan's defenses, wear down its capabilities and intimidate the population. 


So far, that has had little effect, with the vast majority of the island's 23 million people opposing political unification with China.

## Backdoor in XZ Utils That Almost Happened

<p>Last week, the internet dodged a major nation-state attack that would have had catastrophic cybersecurity repercussions worldwide. It’s a catastrophe that didn’t happen, so it won’t get much attention&#8212;but it should. There’s an important moral to the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/04/what-we-know-about-the-xz-utils-backdoor-that-almost-infected-the-world/">story of the attack</a> and its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/03/technology/prevent-cyberattack-linux.html">discovery</a>: The security of the global internet depends on countless obscure pieces of software written and maintained by even more obscure unpaid, distractible, and sometimes vulnerable volunteers. It’s an untenable situation, and one that is being exploited by malicious actors. Yet precious little is being done to remedy it...</p>

## Is Renewable Energy Too Cheap to Be Profitable?

date: 2024-04-11, from: Heatmap News

I kept hearing that our job was ultimately to make these projects “bankable.” As the logic went, “<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1234" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>there is a sizeable universe of good projects that fall just below many private investors’ desired rate of return</u></a>,” and therefore lowering the risks of investing in these “good projects” would put them within reach of private investors’ return expectations. To make decarbonization possible, we had to make decarbonization profitable.</p>
<p>This claim cuts straight through Brett Christophers’ latest book, <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-price-is-wrong-why-capitalism-won-t-save-the-planet-brett-christophers/20125262" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>The Price is Wrong: Why Capitalism Won’t Save the Planet</em></em></u></a>, which argues that the cost of developing and generating renewable energy is <em><em>not</em></em> what will determine the speed or scale of its uptake. It might finally be cheaper to build solar panels and wind farms than a coal or gas plant, that’s for sure. But given the structure of our energy markets today, it does not follow that assets that are cheap to build are necessarily profitable enough to provide adequate returns to investors.</p>
<p>My old colleagues might have already been aware of this fact, but as Christophers highlights, it’s certainly not intuitive, even to many analysts. Nor are its implications: Decarbonization won’t happen if it’s not profitable enough ― and it’s not profitable enough. </p>
<p>Christophers is a professor at Sweden’s Uppsala University in its “department of human geography,” whose research focuses on how capitalism and the modern financial system shape our lives; in this book, that also includes our energy systems. To make his case, he highlights the vicious feedback loop affecting renewables endemic to today’s energy markets. Government support to build renewable energy drives down its marginal cost, but because there’s now more renewable energy available at any given moment, the falling costs cut into developers’ expected returns, requiring more government support to keep investors and developers interested in the sector. </p>
<p>Combine this dynamic with technical features endemic to renewable energy generation, including its intermittency, and the result is a wholesale electricity market with perennially unstable prices. This volatility throttles the expected returns on any investment in renewable energy. No matter how cheap it is to build renewable energy, private investors and developers won’t decarbonize our globe at the speed or scale we deserve ― not under these financial conditions, at least.</p>
<p>Christophers leans on two theoretical guideposts here. First, Andreas Malm, whose assessment of how the profit motive, not relative costs, drove Britain’s first energy transition from water-wheels to coal and steam is an unmistakable conceptual parallel to today’s transition. Second, Karl Polanyi, whose theory of “fictitious commodities” — referring to land, labor, and money, each of which the state and society must painstakingly regulate<em> </em>into fungible market-friendly products ― Christophers aptly applies to electricity and the artificial markets created around it. </p>
<p>But rather than hew to theory to justify why the energy system needs to be socialized to achieve decarbonization ― which is definitely true, by the way; the profit motive is supremely unhelpful here ― Christophers embraces a holistic understanding of the economy as a set of financial relationships, supply chains, planned markets, and legal institutions connecting various public and private entities with different motives.</p>
<p>That means interviewing investors, who tell him things like: “Low returns and volatility don’t go. No bank in the world will take power price risk at low returns.” Christophers also produces a detailed and data-rich breakdown of the interlocking global energy crises in 2021 and 2022, jumping between Texas, China, India, Australia, and across Europe, to make a larger point about energy markets. These crises were “not taken to be evidence of the failings of markets, or even a reason to question their role as the pre-eminent mechanism of coordination to the state’s electricity sector,” he writes; “the market was regarded as the very means to <em><em>manage </em></em>the crisis.” But the markets aren’t working. Something has to give.</p>
<p>He ends the book with a call for socialized power, inspired by the Green New Deal and New York’s Build Public Renewables Act, championed by the state’s democratic socialists on the explicit grounds that, because delivering on the state’s emissions targets is not profitable enough for the private sector to do alone, the public sector must get the job done. With the force of the whole book’s arguments and evidence behind it, this policy prescription hardly appears radical.</p>
<h3>How to Intervene in an Energy Market</h3><p>Public developers can accept lower profitability thresholds, and public finance institutions can provide debt on more forgiving terms; under the public aegis, rates of return and costs of capital become policy choices. Christophers admits in his introduction that he is more focused on unearthing the fragile relationships among actors across the renewable energy industry than on describing the ways a New York-inspired socialized power sector could function. Given <em><em>how much</em></em> there is to unearth, it’s a reasonable choice, but it leaves readers without a working heuristic for the different ways states can intervene in the business of energy. </p>
<p>Here’s my attempt: Energy must be financed, generated, distributed, and consumed. Government intervention in favor of decarbonization looks distinct at each step. </p>
<p>Governments can provide <em><em>consumption support</em></em> by shielding ratepayers from the higher electricity bills that come from potential utility investments into renewable energy procurement and decarbonization-related grid management, backstopping utility investments through a demand guarantee. Consumption support is equitable, but it’s also indirect and incomplete — it might provide a utility with more financial breathing room to procure or develop renewables, but if renewables are not available to procure on the grid or are not easy to develop, this demand guarantee likely just pads the utility’s bottom line.</p>
<p>Governments can provide <em><em>distribution support</em></em> by encouraging utilities to purchase renewable energy. Distribution support most often takes the form of regulatory nudges: In the United States, mandates like Renewable Portfolio Standards force utilities to increase their clean energy procurement, guaranteeing purchase demand for clean electricity and Renewable Energy Certificates, which companies might buy to clean up their own energy portfolios. </p>
<p>These demand-guarantee interventions <em><em>have</em></em> helped speed up renewable energy development nationwide, but with limits. In particular, utility power purchase agreements don’t provide developers with adequate price stability because utilities fix the quantity of energy they purchase rather than the price; corporate PPAs, meanwhile, cannot be relied on at scale because there aren’t enough large creditworthy corporations like Google and Amazon willing to commit to buying energy from new projects at a fixed price. For these reasons and more, supporting utilities’ efforts to decarbonize will not call forth adequate renewable energy generation sources into existence.</p>
<p><em><em>Generation support</em></em> is what most governments already do. Whether through feed-in tariffs, production tax credits, or contracts for difference, generation support entails propping up generators’ profitability, ensuring that the sale price of their energy is never too low. Christophers explains why this mechanism — that is, a revenue guarantee rather than a demand guarantee — is deeply necessary: Renewable energy sources and the energy markets they’re plugged into are both structurally volatile, so, no matter how much energy they generate, they never generate all that much profit. Withdrawing generation support would be, in no uncertain terms, a death knell for renewables development.</p>
<p>And, finally, <em><em>financing support</em></em> targets renewable energy sources as capital-intensive assets requiring huge amounts of upfront debt. Whether through the investment tax credit, viability gap funding, concessional financing, or other forms of cost-share plans, financing support is another form of <em><em>direct</em></em> price support for generation companies; by lowering a project’s cost of capital, it helps lower its developer’s threshold for project profitability, meaning that generators pay less debt service and keep more of their revenues. High interest rates have lately forced up the cost of debt for renewable energy projects to unsustainable levels, far above private developers’ prospective rates of return. Financing support is a must-have these days ― and it’s all the more necessary across the Global South, where the costs of capital are far higher.</p>
<p>None of this is to say that socializing generation and finance solves every problem ― as far as the United States is concerned, non-financial barriers abound, such as regulations and interconnection queues ― but within the existing structure of energy markets, public ownership <em><em>does</em></em> solve a lot.</p>
<p>What does direct government intervention into energy consumption and distribution look like? Public ownership of local distribution utilities is a start. Unlike private utility companies, they don’t need to promise <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-26/green-goals-clash-with-higher-power-bills-exelon-ceo-says" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ten percent returns</u></a> to shareholders, and can use the financial breathing room that comes from lower profitability thresholds to tamp down rate hikes and, perhaps more importantly, rate volatility. Public utilities will not drive decarbonization, but they could potentially help advance transmission reform and better integrate distributed energy resources into the grid.</p>
<p>Christophers all but argues that the best thing governments can do for all four support categories is to redesign energy markets. Beyond simply incentivizing the deployment of clean firm and battery technologies to complement renewables, policymakers’ biggest task is to build an energy system where volatile wholesale energy prices ― which even publicly owned renewable energy developers will have to face for the foreseeable future ― are not the reason that a project fails to get built. That would be a policy failure, and we don’t have time for those.</p>

## Scientists struggle to protect infant corals from hungry fish

date: 2024-04-11, from: VOA News USA

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.  — South Florida researchers trying to prevent predatory fish from devouring laboratory-grown coral are grasping at biodegradable straws in an effort to restore what some call the rainforest of the sea.


Scientists around the world have been working for years to address the decline of coral reef populations. Just last summer, reef rescue groups in South Florida and the Florida Keys were trying to save coral from rising ocean temperatures. Besides working to keep existing coral alive, researchers have also been growing new coral in labs and then placing them in the ocean.


But protecting the underwater ecosystem that maintains more than 25% of all marine species is not easy. Even more challenging is making sure that coral grown in a laboratory and placed into the ocean doesn't become expensive fish food.


Marine researcher Kyle Pisano said one problem is that predators like parrot fish attempt to bite and destroy the newly transplanted coral in areas like South Florida, leaving them with less than a 40% survival rate. With projects calling for thousands of coral to be planted over the next year and tens of thousands of coral to be planted over the next decade, the losses add up when coral pieces can cost more than $100 each.


Pisano and his partner, Kirk Dotson, have developed the Coral Fort, claiming the small biodegradable cage that's made in part with drinking straws boosts the survival rate of transplanted coral to over 90%.


"Parrot fish on the reef really, really enjoy biting a newly transplanted coral," Pisano said. "They treat it kind of like popcorn."




Fortunately the fish eventually lose interest in the coral as it matures, but scientists need to protect the coral in the meantime. Stainless steel and PVC pipe barriers have been set up around transplanted coral in the past, but those barriers needed to be cleaned of algae growth and eventually removed.


Pisano had the idea of creating a protective barrier that would eventually dissolve, eliminating the need to maintain or remove it. He began conducting offshore experiments with biodegradable coral cages as part of a master's degree program at Nova Southeastern University. He used a substance called polyhydroxyalkanoate, a biopolymer derived from the fermentation of canola oil. PHA biodegrades in ocean, leaving only water and carbon dioxide. His findings were published last year.


The coral cage consists of a limestone disc surrounded by eight vertical phade brand drinking straws, made by Atlanta-based WinCup Inc. The device doesn't have a top, Pisano said, because the juvenile coral needs sunlight and the parrot fish don't generally want to position themselves facing downward to eat.


Dotson, a retired aerospace engineer, met Pisano through his professor at Nova Southeastern, and the two formed Reef Fortify Inc. to further develop and market the patent-pending Coral Fort. The first batch of cages were priced at $12 each, but Pisano and Dotson believe that could change as production scales up.


Early prototypes of the cage made from phade's standard drinking straws were able to protect the coral for about two months before dissolving in the ocean, but that wasn't quite long enough to outlast the interest of parrot fish. When Pisano and Dotson reached out to phade for help, the company assured them that it could make virtually any custom shape from its biodegradable PHA material.


"But it's turning out that the boba straws, straight out of the box, work just fine," Dotson said.


Boba straws are wider and thicker than normal drinking straws. They're used for a tea-based drink that includes tapioca balls at the bottom of the cup. For Pisano and Dotson, that extra thickness means the straws last just long enough to protect the growing coral before harmlessly disappearing.


Reef Fortify is hoping to work with reef restoration projects all over the world. The Coral Forts already already being used by researchers at Nova Southeastern and the University of Miami, as well as Hawaii's Division of Aquatic Resources.


Rich Karp, a coral researcher at the University of Miami, said they've been using the Coral Forts for about a month. He pointed out that doing any work underwater takes a great deal of time and effort, so having a protective cage that dissolves when it's no longer needed basically cuts their work in half.


"Simply caging corals and then removing the cages later, that's two times the amount of work, two times the amount of bottom time," Karp said. "And it's not really scalable."


Experts say coral reefs are a significant part of the oceanic ecosystem. They occupy less than 1% of the ocean worldwide but provide food and shelter to nearly 25 percent of sea life. Coral reefs also help to protect humans and their homes along the coastline from storm surges during hurricanes.

## Lately

date: 2024-04-11, from: Rachel Kwon blog

I&rsquo;ve been a little less online lately, but not to worry, I have just been living my life :)
Several weeks ago, I gave notice at work and left. Some people in my life were surprised, because it was a good job at a good company, I generally enjoyed it, I got to work with wonderful people, and I was paid money to do it. The younger version of me who hadn&rsquo;t yet figured out a career direction would be curious (and more than a little skeptical) about why I would quit such an objectively good job.

## New York appeals court rejects Donald Trump’s third request to delay Monday's hush money trial

date: 2024-04-11, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — Donald Trump is now 0 for 3 in last-minute attempts to get a New York appeals court to delay his looming hush money criminal trial. An appeals court judge Wednesday swiftly rejected the latest salvo from the former president’s lawyers, who argued he should be on the campaign trail rather than “in a courtroom defending himself” starting next week.


Trump's lawyers had asked the state’s mid-level appeals court to halt the case indefinitely while they fight to remove the trial judge and challenge several of his pretrial rulings, which they argue have seriously hindered the presumptive Republican nominee's defense.


Justice Ellen Gesmer’s ruling, after a third straight day of emergency hearings on Trump’s delay requests, was yet another loss for Trump, who has tried repeatedly to get the trial postponed. Barring further court action, the ruling clears the way for jury selection to begin next Monday.




“We’re here for this stay because there are restrictions in place that cannot operate in a constitutional way in a trial environment,” Trump lawyer Emil Bove argued at the hearing, which was held in a court basement lobby because the regular courtroom was in use.


“It’s an incredibly important trial. It’s a historic, unprecedented proceeding,” Bove said, adding: “This can only be done once, and it must be done right.”


Trump’s hush-money case is the first of his four criminal indictments slated to go to trial and would be the first criminal trial ever of a former president.


Adding to a litany of complaints registered this week with the appeals court, Bove argued that trial Judge Juan Merchan “exceeded his authority” in refusing to postpone the case until the Supreme Court rules on an immunity claim Trump raised in another of his criminal cases. Trump's lawyers argue some evidence in the hush-money case could be excluded if the Supreme Court rules in his favor.


Merchan last week declared that request untimely, ruling that Trump’s lawyers had “myriad opportunities” to raise the immunity issue before they finally did so in March, well after a deadline for pretrial motions had passed.


Steven Wu, the appellate chief for the Manhattan district attorney’s office, echoed that sentiment at Wednesday’s emergency hearing. He argued that Trump's lawyers had months to raise immunity and other issues and should not be rewarded with a delay at the eleventh hour.


“Staying the trial at this point would be incredibly disruptive,” Wu said. “The court, the people, witnesses have made extraordinary efforts to make sure this trial can take place on Monday.”


“There’s a powerful public interest to ensure this criminal trial goes forward,” he added.


Gesmer presided over the emergency hearing from an armchair, facing a hodgepodge of wooden seats, a collapsable table and a restroom.


Trump is accused of falsifying his company’s records to hide the nature of payments to his former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen, who helped Trump bury negative stories during his 2016 campaign. Cohen’s activities included paying porn actor Stormy Daniels $130,000 to suppress her claims of an extramarital sexual encounter with Trump years earlier.


Trump pleaded not guilty last year to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. He has denied having a sexual encounter with Daniels. His lawyers argue the payments to Cohen were legitimate legal expenses.


Trump already struck out twice this week with the appeals court. One appeals court judge Monday rejected his bid to delay the trial while he seeks to move it out of Manhattan. A different judge on Tuesday denied a request, framed as part of a lawsuit against Merchan, that the trial be delayed while Trump fights a gag order imposed on him in recent weeks.


Trump's lawyers had asked Merchan last month to adjourn the New York trial indefinitely until Trump’s immunity claim in his Washington, D.C., election interference case is resolved.


Trump contends he is immune from prosecution for conduct alleged to involve official acts during his tenure in office. His lawyers have not raised that as a defense in the hush-money case, but they argued that some evidence — including Trump’s social media posts about former lawyer Cohen — is from his time as president and should be excluded from the trial because of his immunity protections.


The Supreme Court is to hear arguments in that matter on April 25.


"This is a situation where a judge has exceeded his authority under circumstances with very, very serious federalism implications,” Bove argued at Wednesday's emergency hearing.


Trump's lawyers also renewed their argument that Merchan should step aside from the case. They've accused him of bias and a conflict of interest, citing his daughter’s work as the head of a firm whose clients have included President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and other Democrats.


Trump's lawyers filed a formal recusal request with Merchan last week. The judge rejected a similar request in August and has not ruled on Trump’s pending request. The judge has also yet to rule on another defense delay request, which claims that Trump won’t get a fair trial because of “prejudicial media coverage.”


“Their recusal arguments are completely meritless," Wu argued.


Trump's lawyers also took issue with a protocol Merchan put in place last month to manage a flood of last-minute court filings. And they revisited their complaints — aired at an emergency hearing Tuesday — about the gag order Merchan imposed on Trump last month that bars him from making public comments about witnesses, jurors and others regarding their connections to the case.


Trump’s ability to campaign "is something that’s protected under the First Amendment, for President Trump and the American people,” Bove argued.
