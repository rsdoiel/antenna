This explains why I was seeing weird <code>&lt;|im_end|&gt;</code>
suffexes during my
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/8/phi-4/">experiments with
Phi-4</a> the other day: it turns out the Phi-4 tokenizer definition as
released by Microsoft had a bug in it, and there was a small bug in the
chat template as well.

<p>Daniel and Michael Han figured this out and have now published

The Steam Deck handheld gaming PC now comes with a choice of LCD or

upgrade to an AMOLED display? Officially your only option is to buy a

<p>Michael Crider (Hacker News): The big story in PC gaming for the last
three years has been the Steam Deck. This low-power, portable,
relatively inexpensive machine is clearly something the market has been
waiting for, exciting gamers and energizing PC makers to pump out
imitators, like the Asus ROG Ally and the Lenovo Legion Go. […]</p>

November’s elections. No matter the results of those, […]</p>

<p>date: 2025-01-10, updated: 2025-01-10, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://oxide-and-friends.transistor.fm/">Oxide and
Friends</a> podcast has an annual tradition of asking guests to share
their predictions for the next 1, 3 and 6 years. Here’s
<a href="https://github.com/oxidecomputer/oxide-and-friends/blob/master/2022_01_03.md">2022</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/oxidecomputer/oxide-and-friends/blob/master/2023_01_09.md">2023</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/oxidecomputer/oxide-and-friends/blob/master/2024_01_08.md">2024</a>.
This year they invited me to participate. I’ve never been brave enough
to share <em>any</em> public predictions before, so this was a great
opportunity to get outside my comfort zone!
</p>
<p>
We recorded the episode live using Discord on Monday. It’s now available
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pk6VokHpGY">on YouTube</a> and
<a href="https://oxide-and-friends.transistor.fm/">in podcast form</a>.

</p>
<p>
Here are my predictions, written up here in a little more detail than
the stream of consciousness I shared on the podcast.
</p>
<p>
I should emphasize that I find the very idea of trying to predict
AI/LLMs over a multi-year period to be completely absurd! I can’t
predict what’s going to happen a week from now, six years is a different
universe.

I wrote about how
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/31/llms-in-2024/#-agents-still-haven-t-really-happened-yet">“Agents”
still haven’t really happened yet</a> in my review of Large Language
Model developments in 2024.
</p>
<p>
I think we are going to see a <em>lot</em> more froth about agents in
2025, but I expect the results will be a great disappointment to most of
the people who are excited about this term. I expect a lot of money will
be lost chasing after several different poorly defined dreams that share
that name.
</p>
<p>
What are agents anyway? Ask a dozen people and you’ll get a dozen
slightly different answers - I collected and
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/beaa5f90133b30724c5cc1c4008d0654">then
AI-summarized a bunch of those here</a>.
</p>
<p>
For the sake of argument, let’s pick a definition that I can predict
won’t come to fruition: the idea of an AI assistant that can go out into
the world and semi-autonomously act on your behalf. I think of this as
the <strong>travel agent</strong> definition of agents, because for some
reason everyone always jumps straight to flight and hotel booking and
itinerary planning when they describe this particular dream.
</p>
<p>
Having the current generation of LLMs make material decisions on your
behalf - like what to spend money on - is a <em>really bad idea</em>.
They’re too unreliable, but more importantly they are too
<strong>gullible</strong>.
</p>
<p>
If you’re going to arm your AI assistant with a credit card and set it
loose on the world, you need to be confident that it’s not going to hit
“buy” on the first website that claims to offer the best bargains!
</p>
<p>
I’m confident that reliability is the reason we haven’t seen LLM-powered
agents that have taken off yet, despite the idea attracting a huge
amount of buzz since right after ChatGPT first came out.
</p>
<p>
I would be very surprised if any of the models released over the next
twelve months had enough of a reliability improvement to make this work.
Solving gullibility is an astonishingly difficult problem.
</p>
<p>
(I had
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pk6VokHpGY&amp;t=1206s">a
particularly spicy rant</a> about how stupid the idea of sending a
“digital twin” to a meeting on your behalf is.)
</p>
<h4 id="one-year-code-research-assistants">
One year: … except for code and research assistants
</h4>
<p>
There are two categories of “agent” that I do believe in, because
they’re proven to work already.
</p>
<p>
The first is <strong>coding assistants</strong> - where an LLM writes,
executes and then refines computer code in a loop.
</p>
<p>
I first saw this pattern demonstrated by OpenAI with their
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/code-interpreter/">Code
Interpreter</a> feature for ChatGPT, released back in March/April of
2023.
</p>
<p>
You can ask ChatGPT to solve a problem that can use Python code and it
will write that Python, execute it in a secure sandbox (I think it’s
Kubernetes) and then use the output - or any error messages - to
determine if the goal has been achieved.
</p>
<p>
It’s a beautiful pattern that worked great with early 2023 models (I
believe it first shipped using original GPT-4), and continues to work
today.
</p>
<p>
Claude added their own version in October
(<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/24/claude-analysis-tool/">Claude
analysis</a>, using JavaScript that runs in the browser), Mistral have
it, Gemini has a version and there are dozens of other implementations
of the same pattern.
</p>
<p>
The second category of agents that I believe in is <strong>research
assistants</strong> - where an LLM can run multiple searches, gather
information and aggregate that into an answer to a question or write a
report.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/">Perplexity</a> and
<a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-search/">ChatGPT
Search</a> have both been operating in this space for a while, but by
far the most impressive implementation I’ve seen is Google Gemini’s
<a href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/google-gemini-deep-research/">Deep
Research</a> tool, which I’ve had access to for a few weeks.
</p>
<p>
With Deep Research I can pose a question like this one:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Pillar Point Harbor is one of the largest communal brown pelican roosts
on the west coast of North America.
</p>
<p>
find others
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
And Gemini will draft a plan, consult dozens of different websites via
Google Search and then assemble a report (with all-important citations)
describing what it found.
</p>
<p>
Here’s the plan it came up with:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Pillar Point Harbor is one of the largest communal brown pelican roosts
on the west coast of North America. Find other large communal brown
pelican roosts on the west coast of North America.<br /> (1) Find a list
of brown pelican roosts on the west coast of North America.<br /> (2)
Find research papers or articles about brown pelican roosts and their
size.<br /> (3) Find information from birdwatching organizations or
government agencies about brown pelican roosts.<br /> (4) Compare the
size of the roosts found in (3) to the size of the Pillar Point Harbor
roost.<br /> (5) Find any news articles or recent reports about brown
pelican roosts and their populations.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It dug up a whole bunch of details, but the one I cared most about was
<a href="https://birdallianceoregon.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Brown-Pelican-survey_4-year_summary-infographic_2016-19_final.pdf">these
PDF results for the 2016-2019 Pacific Brown Pelican Survey</a> conducted
by the West Coast Audubon network and partners - a PDF that included
this delightful list:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Top 10 Megaroosts (sites that traditionally host &gt;500 pelicans) with
average fall count numbers:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Alameda Breakwater, CA (3,183)
</li>
<li>
Pillar Point Harbor, CA (1,481)
</li>
<li>
East Sand Island, OR (1,121)
</li>
<li>
Ano Nuevo State Park, CA (1,068)
</li>
<li>
Salinas River mouth, CA (762)
</li>
<li>
Bolinas Lagoon, CA (755)
</li>
<li>
Morro Rock, CA (725)
</li>
<li>
Moss landing, CA (570)
</li>
<li>
Crescent City Harbor, CA (514)
</li>
<li>
Bird Rock Tomales, CA (514)
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
My local harbor is the second biggest megaroost!
</p>
<p>
It makes intuitive sense to me that this kind of research assistant can
be built on our current generation of LLMs. They’re competent at driving
tools, they’re capable of coming up with a relatively obvious research
plan (look for newspaper articles and research papers) and they can
synthesize sensible answers given the right collection of context
gathered through search.
</p>
<p>
Google are particularly well suited to solving this problem: they have
the world’s largest search index and their Gemini model has a 2 million
token context. I expect Deep Research to get a whole lot better, and I
expect it to attract plenty of competition.
</p>
<h4 id="three-years-someone-wins-a-pulitzer-for-ai-assisted-investigative-reporting">
Three years: Someone wins a Pulitzer for AI-assisted investigative
reporting
</h4>
<p>
I went for a bit of a self-serving prediction here: I think within three
years someone is going to win a Pulitzer prize for a piece of
investigative reporting that was aided by generative AI tools.
</p>
<p>
I do <em>not</em> mean that an LLM will write the article! I continue to
think that having LLMs write on your behalf is one of the least
interesting applications of these tools.
</p>
<p>
I called this prediction self-serving because I want to help make this
happen! My <a href="https://datasette.io">Datasette</a> suite of open
source tools for data journalism has been growing AI features, like
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Dec/1/datasette-enrichments/">LLM-powered
data enrichments</a> and
<a href="https://www.datasette.cloud/blog/2024/datasette-extract/">extracting
structured data</a> into tables from unstructured text.
</p>
<p>
My dream is for those tools - or tools like them - to be used for an
award winning piece of investigative reporting.
</p>
<p>
I picked three years for this because I think that’s how long it will
take for knowledge of how to responsibly and effectively use these tools
to become widespread enough for that to happen.
</p>
<p>
LLMs are not an obvious fit for journalism: journalists look for the
truth, and LLMs are notoriously prone to hallucination and making things
up. But journalists are also <em>really good</em> at extracting useful
information from potentially untrusted sources - that’s a lot of what
the craft of journalism is about.
</p>
<p>
The two areas I think LLMs are particularly relevant to journalism are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Structured data extraction. If you have 10,000 PDFs from a successful
Freedom of Information Act request, someone or something needs to kick
off the process of reading through them to find the stories. LLMs are a
fantastic way to take a vast amount of information and start making some
element of sense from it. They can act as lead generators, helping
identify the places to start looking more closely.
</li>
<li>
Coding assistance. Writing code to help analyze data is a huge part of
modern data journalism - from SQL queries through data cleanup scripts,
custom web scrapers or visualizations to help find signal among the
noise. Most newspapers don’t have a team of programmers on staff: I
think within three years we’ll have robust enough tools built around
this pattern that non-programmer journalists will be able to use them as
part of their reporting process.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I hope to build some of these tools myself!
</p>
<p>
So my concrete prediction for three years is that someone wins a
Pulitzer with a small amount of assistance from LLMs.
</p>
<p>
My more general prediction: within three years it won’t be surprising at
all to see most information professionals use LLMs as part of their
daily workflow, in increasingly sophisticated ways. We’ll know exactly
what patterns work and how best to explain them to people. These skills
will become widespread.
</p>
<h4 id="three-years-part-two-privacy-laws-with-teeth">
Three years part two: privacy laws with teeth
</h4>
<p>
My other three year prediction concerned privacy legislation.
</p>
<p>
The levels of (often justified) paranoia around both targeted
advertising and what happens to the data people paste into these models
is a constantly growing problem.
</p>
<p>
I wrote recently about the
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/2/they-spy-on-you-but-not-like-that/">inexterminable
conspiracy theory that Apple target ads through spying through your
phone’s microphone</a>. I’ve written in the past about
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Dec/14/ai-trust-crisis/">the AI
trust crisis</a>, where people refuse to believe that models are not
being trained on their inputs no matter how emphatically the companies
behind them deny it.
</p>
<p>
I think the AI industry itself would benefit enormously from legislation
that helps clarify what’s going on with training on user-submitted data,
and the wider tech industry could really do with harder rules around
things like data retention and targeted advertising.
</p>
<p>
I don’t expect the next four years of US federal government to be
effective at passing legislation, but I expect we’ll see privacy
legislation with sharper teeth emerging at the state level or
internationally. Let’s just hope we don’t end up with a new generation
of cookie-consent banners as a result!
</p>
<h4 id="six-years-utopian-amazing-art">
Six years utopian: amazing art
</h4>
<p>
For six years I decided to go with two rival predictions, one optimistic
and one pessimistic.
</p>
<p>
I think six years is long enough that we’ll figure out how to harness
this stuff to make some <strong>really great art</strong>.
</p>
<p>
I don’t think generative AI for art - images, video and music - deserves
nearly the same level of respect as a useful tool as text-based LLMs.
Generative art tools are a lot of fun to try out but the lack of
fine-grained control over the output greatly limits its utility outside
of personal amusement or generating
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/slop/">slop</a>.
</p>
<p>
More importantly, they lack social acceptability. The vibes aren’t good.
Many talented artists have loudly rejected the idea of these tools, to
the point that the very term “AI” is developing a distasteful
connotation in society at large.
</p>
<p>
Image and video models are also ground zero for the AI training data
ethics debate, and for good reason: no artist wants to see a model
trained on their work without their permission that then directly
competes with them!
</p>
<p>
I think six years is long enough for this whole thing to shake out - for
society to figure out acceptable ways of using these tools to truly
elevate human expression. What excites me is the idea of truly talented,
visionary creative artists using whatever these tools have evolved into
in six years to make meaningful art that could never have been achieved
without them.
</p>
<p>
On the podcast I talked about
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_Everywhere_All_at_Once">Everything
Everywhere All at Once</a>, a film that deserved every one of its seven
Oscars. The core visual effects team on that film was just five people.
Imagine what a team like that could do with the generative AI tools
we’ll have in six years time!
</p>
<p id="since-recording">
Since recording the podcast I learned from
<a href="https://www.swyx.io/">Swyx</a> that Everything Everywhere All
at Once
<a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/aws/how-ai-tools-are-creating-new-possibilities-for-movies-and-visual-design-according-to-this-aws-powered-startup">used
Runway ML as part of their toolset already</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Evan Halleck was on this team, and he used Runway’s AI tools to save
time and automate tedious aspects of editing. Specifically in the film’s
rock scene, he used Runway’s rotoscoping tool to get a quick, clean cut
of the rocks as sand and dust were moving around the shot. This
translated days of work to a matter of minutes.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I said I thought a film that had used generative AI tools would win an
Oscar within six years. Looks like I was eight years late on that one
already!
</p>
<h4 id="six-years-dystopian-agi-asi-causes-mass-civil-unrest">
Six years dystopian: AGI/ASI causes mass civil unrest
</h4>
<p>
My pessimistic alternative take for 2031 concerns “AGI” - a term which,
like “agents”, is constantly being redefined. The Information
<a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/microsoft-and-openai-wrangle-over-terms-of-their-blockbuster-partnership">recently
reported</a> (see also
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337106/sam-altman-says-openai-knows-how-to-build-agi-blog-post">The
Verge</a>) that Microsoft and OpenAI are now defining AGI as a system
capable of generating $100bn in profit!
</p>
<p>
If we assume AGI is the point at which AI systems are capable of
performing almost any job currently reserved for a human being it’s hard
<em>not</em> to see potentially negative consequences.
</p>
<p>
Sam Altman may have
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-22/ubi-study-backed-by-openai-s-sam-altman-bolsters-support-for-basic-income">experimented
with Universal Basic Income</a>, but the USA is a country that can’t
even figure out universal healthcare! I have huge trouble imagining a
future economy that works for the majority of people when the majority
of jobs are being done by machines.
</p>
<p>
So my dystopian prediction for 2031 is that if that form of AGI has come
to pass it will be accompanied by extraordinarily bad economic outcomes
and mass civil unrest.
</p>
<p>
My version of an AI utopia is tools that augment existing humans. That’s
what we’ve had with LLMs so far, and my ideal is that those tools
continue to improve and subsequently humans become able to take on
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Mar/27/ai-enhanced-development/">more
ambitious work</a>.
</p>
<p>
If there’s a version of AGI that results in that kind of utopia, I’m all
for it.
</p>
<h4 id="my-total-lack-of-conviction">
My total lack of conviction
</h4>
<p>
There’s a reason I haven’t made predictions like this before: my
confidence in my ability to predict the future is almost non-existent.
At least one of my predictions here
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/10/ai-predictions/#since-recording">already
proved to be eight years late</a>!
</p>
<p>
These predictions are in the public record now (I even
<a href="https://github.com/oxidecomputer/oxide-and-friends/pull/158">submitted
a pull request</a>).
</p>
<p>
It’s going to be interesting looking back at these in one, three and six
years to see how I did.
