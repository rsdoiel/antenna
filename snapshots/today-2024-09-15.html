If you need the Oxford comma to resolve and ambiguity, you can also

military leaders finish discussions on South China Sea, other
issues</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BANGKOK — Military leaders from the U.S. and China met in Beijing for
routine talks that only resumed in January after being suspended for two
years as ties between the two countries soured. The meetings ended
Sunday and officials discussed ongoing issues such as Taiwan, the
Russia-Ukraine war and clashes in the South China Sea.</p>
<p>Michael Chase, deputy assistant secretary of defense for China,
Taiwan and Mongolia led a delegation to engage in the bilateral Defense
Policy Coordination Talks, which were last held in January. While the
talks weren’t expected to resolve long-standing differences in stances
over issues ranging from South China Sea claims to Taiwan, the U.S. has
continued to push for the discussions to avoid conflict.</p>
<p>The meetings were held after Chase attended the Xiangshan forum in
Beijing, a defense forum that is China’s answer to the Shangri-La
Dialogue.</p>
<p>Communication between the two militaries broke off in 2021, as
U.S.-China tensions ratcheted up over widening differences on issues
such as Taiwan’s sovereignty, the origin of COVID-19 and economic
issues.</p>
<p>Beijing has ignored U.S. requests to engage in the past, especially
over intercepts between U.S. and Chinese aircraft and ships. While
communications resumed after U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese
President Xi Jinping met in San Francisco last November, it is unclear
whether the talks could continue as the U.S. is poised for a
presidential election.</p>
<p>In the bilateral talks, the two sides discussed China’s support for
Russia during the ongoing Ukraine war, as well as China’s actions in the
South China Sea, said a U.S. senior defense official briefing reporters
on the meetings. On Sunday, the Philippine ship at a disputed shoal, BRP
Teresa Magbanua, had left to resupply and provide medical care to its
crew members. The defense official said that they were “watching further
developments there very closely.”</p>
<p>China’s claims over the South China Sea have become increasingly
assertive, with increasing clashes with the Philippine coast guard. In
August, both sides accused each other over a collision between their
ships which left gaping holes in the Philippine ships.</p>
<p>The maritime claims have meant clashes at sea, such as at the Sabina
Shoal, which both China and the Philippines claim. China had blocked
attempts to resupply the BRP Teresa Magbanua, in August, with a force of
40 ships.</p>
<p>The Philippines said it would replace the ship immediately, but the
departure of the ship raises questions of whether China would seize the
shoal. Filipino scientists had previously found submerged piles of
crushed corals in its shallows, leading to concern that China may be
preparing to build a structure to stake its claim.</p>
<p>China confirmed the departure of the ship, which it said, “infringed
on China’s territorial sovereignty.”</p>
<p>“During this period, China had taken control measures against the
ship in accordance with the law and multiple attempts by the Philippine
side to forcibly resupply the ship had failed,” China Coast Guard
spokesperson Liu Dejun said in a statement.</p>

Fed expected to announce its first interest rate cut since 2020</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The Federal Reserve is gearing up to announce its first
interest rate cut for more than four years on Wednesday, with
policymakers expected to debate how big a move to make less than two
months before the U.S. presidential election.   </p>
<p>Senior officials at the U.S. central bank including Fed chair Jerome
Powell have in recent weeks indicated that a rate cut is coming this
month, as inflation eases toward the bank’s long-term target of two
percent, and the labor market continues to cool.   </p>
<p>The Fed, which has a dual mandate from Congress to act independently
to ensure both stable prices and maximum sustainable employment, has
repeatedly stressed it will make its decision on rate cuts based solely
on the economic data.  </p>
<p>But a cut on Wednesday could still cause headaches for Powell, as it
would land shortly before the election, in which former Republican
president Donald Trump is running against the current Democratic vice
president, Kamala Harris. </p>
<p>“As much as I think the Fed tries to say that they’re not a political
animal, we are in a really wild cycle right now,” Alicia Modestino, an
associate professor of economics at Northeastern University, told
AFP.   </p>
<p>How big a cut? </p>
<p>The debate among policymakers on Tuesday and Wednesday this week will
likely center on whether to move by 25 or 50 basis points.   </p>
<p>However, a rate cut of any size would be the Fed’s first since March
2020, when it slashed rates to near-zero in order to support the US
economy through the Covid-19 pandemic.  </p>
<p>The Fed started hiking rates in 2022 in response to a surge in
inflation, fueled largely by a post-pandemic supply crunch and the war
in Ukraine.   </p>
<p>It has held its key lending rate at a two-decade high of between 5.25
and 5.50 percent for the past 14 months, waiting for economic conditions
to improve.   </p>
<p>Now, with inflation falling, the labor market cooling, and the US
economy still growing, policymakers have decided that conditions are
ripe for a cut.   </p>
<p>Policymakers are left with a choice: making a small 25 basis point
cut to ease into things, or a more aggressive cut of 50 basis points,
which would be helpful for the labor market but could also risk
reigniting inflation.   </p>
<p>“I think that in advance of the November meeting, there’s not quite
enough data to say we’re in jeopardy on the employment side,” said
Modestino, who was previously a senior economist at the Federal Reserve
Bank of Boston.    </p>
<p>Analysts see the smaller cut as a safe bet.   </p>
<p>“We expect the Fed to cut by 25bp [basis points],” economists at Bank
of America wrote in a recent note to clients.   </p>
<p>“The Fed likes predictability,” Modestino from Northeastern said.
“It’s good for markets, good for consumers, good for workers.”   </p>
<p>“So a 25 basis point cut now, followed up by another 25 basis point
cut in November after the next round of economic data, offers a somewhat
smoother glide path for the economy,” she added.    </p>
<p>How many cuts?  </p>
<p>While analysts overwhelmingly expect the Fed to start cutting in
September, there is less clarity about what comes next.   </p>
<p>Economists at some banks, including Goldman Sachs, expect cuts
totaling 75 basis points over the last three meetings of the year, while
others see more aggressive cuts, like economists at Citi, who have 125
basis points of easing as their base case.   </p>
<p>“The continued softening of the labor market is likely to provoke
larger-sized cuts if not at this FOMC meeting then in November and
December,” the Citi economists wrote in a recent note to clients,
referring to the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).
  </p>
<p>The Fed will shed some light on the issue on Wednesday, when it
publishes the updated economic forecasts of its 19-member FOMC —
including their rate cut expectations.  </p>
<p>In June, FOMC members sharply reduced the number of cuts they had
penciled in for this year from a median of three down to just one amid a
small uptick in inflation.     </p>
<p>But as inflation has fallen and the labor market has weakened,
expectations of more cuts have grown.  </p>
<p>Traders also see a greater-than 99 percent chance of at least four
more cuts in 2025, which would bring the Fed’s key lending rate down to
between 3.5 and 3.75 percent — 175 basis points below current
levels.</p>

billionaire returns to Earth after first private spacewalk</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida — A billionaire spacewalker returned to Earth
with his crew on Sunday, ending a five-day trip that lifted them higher
than anyone has traveled since NASA’s moonwalkers.</p>
<p>SpaceX’s capsule splashed down in the Gulf of Mexico near Florida’s
Dry Tortugas in the predawn darkness, carrying tech entrepreneur Jared
Isaacman, two SpaceX engineers and a former Air Force Thunderbird
pilot.</p>
<p>They pulled off the first private spacewalk while orbiting nearly 740
kilometers above Earth, higher than the International Space Station and
Hubble Space Telescope. Their spacecraft hit a peak altitude of 1,408
kilometers following Tuesday’s liftoff.</p>
<p>Isaacman became only the 264th person to perform a spacewalk since
the former Soviet Union scored the first in 1965, and SpaceX’s Sarah
Gillis the 265th. Until now, all spacewalks were done by professional
astronauts.</p>
<p>“We are mission complete,” Isaacman radioed as the capsule bobbed in
the water, awaiting the recovery team. Within an hour, all four were out
of their spacecraft, pumping their fists with joy as they emerged onto
the ship’s deck.</p>
<p>It was the first time SpaceX aimed for a splashdown near the Dry
Tortugas, a cluster of islands 113 kilometers west of Key West. To
celebrate the new location, SpaceX employees brought a big, green turtle
balloon to Mission Control at company headquarters in Hawthorne,
California. The company usually targets closer to the Florida coast, but
two weeks of poor weather forecasts prompted SpaceX to look
elsewhere.</p>
<p>During Thursday’s commercial spacewalk, the Dragon capsule’s hatch
was open barely a half-hour. Isaacman emerged only up to his waist to
briefly test SpaceX’s brand-new spacesuit followed by Gillis, who was
knee-high as she flexed her arms and legs for several minutes. Gillis, a
classically trained violinist, also held a performance in orbit earlier
in the week.</p>
<p>The spacewalk lasted less than two hours, considerably shorter than
those at the International Space Station. Most of that time was needed
to depressurize the entire capsule and then restore the cabin air. Even
SpaceX’s Anna Menon and Scott “Kidd” Poteet, who remained strapped in,
wore spacesuits.</p>
<p>SpaceX considers the brief exercise a starting point to test
spacesuit technology for future, longer missions to Mars.</p>
<p>This was Isaacman’s second chartered flight with SpaceX, with two
more still ahead under his personally financed space exploration program
named Polaris after the North Star. He paid an undisclosed sum for his
first spaceflight in 2021, taking along contest winners and a pediatric
cancer survivor while raising more than $250 million for St. Jude
Children’s Research Hospital.</p>
<p>For the just completed so-called Polaris Dawn mission, the founder
and CEO of the Shift4 credit card-processing company shared the cost
with SpaceX. Isaacman won’t divulge how much he spent.</p>

<h2 id="bag-of-cheetos-has-huge-impact-on-national-park-ecosystem">Bag
of Cheetos has huge impact on national park ecosystem</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ALBUQUERQUE, New Mexico — A bag of Cheetos gets dropped and left on
the floor. Seems inconsequential, right?</p>
<p>Hardly.</p>
<p>Rangers at Carlsbad Caverns National Park in southern New Mexico
describe it as a “world-changing” event for the tiny microbes and
insects that call this specialized subterranean environment home. The
bag could have been there a day or two or maybe just hours, but those
salty morsels of processed corn made soft by thick humidity triggered
the growth of mold on the cavern floor and on nearby cave
formations.</p>
<p>“To the ecosystem of the cave it had a huge impact,” the park noted
in a social media post, explaining that cave crickets, mites, spiders
and flies soon organized to eat and disperse the foreign mess,
essentially spreading the contamination.</p>
<p>The bright orange bag was spotted off trail by a ranger during one of
the regular sweeps that park staff make through the Big Room, the
largest single cave chamber by volume in North America, at the end of
each day. They are looking for straggling visitors and any litter or
other waste that might have been left behind on the paved trail.</p>
<p>The Big Room is a popular spot at Carlsbad Caverns. It is a magical
expanse filled with towering stalagmites, dainty stalactites and
clusters of cave popcorn.</p>
<p>Tons of trash</p>
<p>From this underground wonderland in New Mexico to lake shores in
Nevada, tributaries along the Grand Canyon and lagoons in Florida, park
rangers and volunteers collect tons of trash left behind by visitors
each year as part of an ongoing battle to keep unique ecosystems from
being compromised while still allowing visitors access.</p>
<p>According to the National Park Service, more than 300 million people
visit the national parks each year, bringing in and generating nearly 70
million tons of trash, most of which ends up where it belongs - in
garbage bins and recycling containers.</p>
<p>But for the rest of the discarded snack bags and other debris, it
often takes work to round up the waste, and organizations like Leave No
Trace have been pushing their message at trailheads and online.</p>
<p>At Carlsbad Caverns, volunteers comb the caverns collecting lint. One
five-day effort netted as much as 50 pounds (22.68 kilograms). Rangers
also have sweep packs and spill kits for the more delicate and sometimes
nasty work that can include cleaning up human waste along the trail.</p>
<p>“It’s such a dark area, sometimes people don’t notice that it’s
there. So they walk through it and it tracks it throughout the entire
cave,” said Joseph Ward, a park guide who is working specifically on
getting the “leave no trace” message out to park visitors and
classrooms.</p>
<p>The rangers’ kits can include gloves, trash bags, water, bleach
mixtures for decontamination, vacuums and even bamboo toothbrushes and
tweezers for those hard-to-reach spots.</p>
<p>As for the spilled Cheetos, Ward told The Associated Press that could
have been avoided because the park doesn’t allow food beyond the
confines of the historic underground lunchroom.</p>
<p>Cheetos response</p>
<p>After the bag was discovered in July, cave specialists at the park
settled on the best way to clean it up. Most of the mess was scooped up,
and a toothbrush was used to remove rings of mold and fungi that had
spread to nearby cave formations. It was a 20-minute job.</p>
<p>Some jobs can take hours and involve several park employees, Ward
said.</p>
<p>Robert Melnick, professor emeritus at the University of Oregon, has
been studying the cultural landscape of Carlsbad Caverns, including
features like a historic wooden staircase that has become another
breeding ground for exotic mold and fungi. He and his team submitted a
report to the park in recent days that details those resources and makes
recommendations for how the park can manage them in the future.</p>
<p>The balancing act for park managers at Carlsbad and elsewhere,
Melnick said, is meeting the dual mandate of preserving and protecting
landscapes while also making them accessible.</p>
<p>“I don’t quite know how you would monitor it except to constantly
remind people that the underground, the caves, are a very, very
sensitive natural environment,” he said.</p>
<p>Pleas to treat the caverns with respect are plastered on signs
throughout the park, rangers give orientations to visitors before they
go underground, and reminders of the dos and don’ts are printed on the
back of each ticket stub.</p>
<p>But sometimes there is a disconnect between awareness and personal
responsibility, said JD Tanner, director of education and training at
Leave No Trace.</p>
<p>Personal stake is vital</p>
<p>Many people may be aware of the need to “keep it pristine,” but
Tanner said the message doesn’t always translate into action or there is
a lack of understanding that small actions — even leaving a piece of
trash — can have irreversible damage in a fragile ecosystem.</p>
<p>“If someone doesn’t feel a personal stake in the preservation of
these environments, they may not take the rules seriously,” Tanner
said.</p>
<p>Diana Northup, a microbiologist who has spent years studying cave
environments around the world, once crawled up the main corridor at
Carlsbad Caverns to log everything that humans left behind.</p>
<p>“So this is just one thing of very many,” she said of the
Cheetos.</p>
<p>As many as 2,000 people go through the caverns on any given day
during the busy season. With them come hair and skin fragments, and
those fragments can have their own microbes on board.</p>
<p>“So it can be really, really bad or it can just be us and all the
stuff we’re shedding,” Northup said of human contamination within cave
environments. “But here’s the other side of the coin: The only way you
can protect caves is for people to be able to see them and experience
them.”</p>
<p>“The biggest thing,” she said, “is you have to get people to value
and want to preserve the caves and let them know what they can do to
have that happen.”</p>

Chinese to Italians and beyond, maligning a culture via its food is
longtime American habit</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>new york — It’s a practice that’s about as American as apple pie —
accusing immigrant and minority communities of engaging in bizarre or
disgusting behaviors when it comes to what and how they eat and drink, a
kind of shorthand for saying they don’t belong. </p>
<p>The latest iteration came at Tuesday’s presidential debate, when
former President Donald Trump spotlighted a false online tempest around
the Haitian immigrant community of Springfield, Ohio. He repeated the
groundless claim previously spread by his running mate, JD Vance, that
the immigrants were stealing dogs and cats, the precious pets belonging
to their American neighbors, and eating them. The furor got enough
attention that officials had to step in to refute it, saying there was
no credible evidence of any such thing. </p>
<p>But while it might be enough to turn your stomach, such food-based
accusations are not new. Far from it. </p>
<p>Food-related scorn and insults were hurled at immigrant Chinese
communities on the West Coast in the late 1800s as they started coming
to the United States in larger numbers, and in later decades spread to
other Asian and Pacific Islander communities like Thai or Vietnamese. As
recently as last year, a Thai restaurant in California was hit with the
stereotype, which caused such an outpouring of undeserved vitriol that
the owner had to close and move to another location. </p>
<p>Behind it is the idea that “you’re engaging in something that is not
just a matter of taste, but a violation of what it is to be human,” said
Paul Freedman, a professor of history at Yale University. By tarring
Chinese immigrants as those who would eat things Americans would refuse
to, it made them the “other.” </p>
<p>Food as flashpoint </p>
<p>Other communities, while not being accused of eating pets, have been
criticized for the perceived strangeness of what they were cooking when
they were new arrivals, such as Italians using too much garlic or
Indians too much curry powder. Minority groups with a longer presence in
the country were and are still not exempt from racist stereotypes —
think derogatory references to Mexicans and beans or insulting African
Americans with remarks about fried chicken and watermelon. </p>
<p>“There’s a slur for almost every ethnicity based on some kind of food
that they eat,” said Amy Bentley, professor of nutrition and food
studies at New York University. “And so that’s a very good way of
disparaging people.” </p>
<p>That’s because food isn’t just sustenance. Embedded in human eating
habits are some of the very building blocks of culture — things that
make different peoples distinct and can be commandeered as fodder for
ethnic hatred or political polemics. </p>
<p>“We need it to survive, but it’s also highly ritualized and highly
symbolic. So the birthday cake, the anniversary, the things are
commemorated and celebrated with food and drink,” Bentley said. “It’s
just so highly integrated in all parts of our lives.” </p>
<p>And because “there’s specific variations of how humans do those
rituals, how they eat, how they have shaped their cuisines, how they eat
their food,” she added, “It can be as a theme of commonality … or it can
be a form of distinct division.” </p>
<p>It’s not just the what. Insults can come from the how as well —
eating with hands or chopsticks instead of forks and knives, for
example. It can be seen in class-based bias against poorer people who
didn’t have the same access to elaborate table settings or couldn’t
afford to eat the same way the rich did — and used different, perhaps
unfamiliar ingredients out of necessity. </p>
<p>Such disparagement can extend directly into current events. During
the Second Gulf War, for example, Americans angry at France’s opposition
to the U.S. invasion of Iraq started calling french fries “freedom
fries.” And a much-used insulting term in the United States for Germans
during the first two world wars was “krauts” — a slam on a culture where
sauerkraut was a traditional food. </p>
<p>“Just what was wrong with the way urban immigrants ate?” Donna R.
Gabaccia wrote in her 1998 book, “We Are What We Eat: Ethnic Food and
the Making of Americans.” In reviewing attitudes of the early 20th
century and its demands for “100% Americanism,” she noted that
“sauerkraut became ‘victory cabbage’” and one account complained of an
Italian family “still eating spaghetti, not yet assimilated.” </p>
<p>More food culture, more fodder </p>
<p>Such stereotypes have persisted despite the fact that the American
palate has significantly expanded in recent decades, thanks in part to
the influx of those immigrant communities, with grocery stores carrying
a wealth of ingredients that would baffle previous generations. The rise
of restaurant culture has introduced many diners to authentic examples
of cuisines they might have needed a passport to access in other
eras. </p>
<p>After all, Bentley said, “when immigrants migrate to a different
country, they bring their foodways with them and maintain them as they
can. … It’s so reminiscent of family, community, home. They’re just
really material, multisensory manifestations of who we are.” </p>
<p>Haitian food is just one example of that. Communities like those
found in New York City and south Florida have added to the culinary
landscape, using ingredients like goat, plantains and cassava. </p>
<p>So when Trump said that immigrants in Springfield — whom he called
“the people that came in” — were eating dogs and cats and “the pets of
the people that live there,” the echoes of his remarks played into not
just food but culture itself. </p>
<p>And even though the American palate has broadened in recent decades,
the persistence of food stereotypes — and outright insults, whether
based in fact or completely made up — shows that just because Americans
eat more broadly, it doesn’t mean that carries over into tolerance or
nuance about other groups. </p>
<p>“It’s a fallacy to think that,” said Freedman. “It’s like the tourism
fallacy that travel makes us more understanding of diversity. The best
example right now is Mexican food. Lots and lots of people like Mexican
food AND think that immigration needs to be stopped. There’s no link
between enjoyment of a foreigner’s cuisine and that openness.”</p>

consumer watchdog finds school lunch fees taking toll on parents</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>new york — Single mother Rebecca Wood, 45, was already dealing with
high medical bills in 2020 when she noticed she was being charged a
$2.49 “program fee” each time she loaded money onto her daughter’s
school lunch account. </p>
<p>As more schools turn to cashless payment systems, more districts have
contracted with processing companies that charge as much as $3.25 or 4%
to 5% per transaction, according to a new report from the Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau. The report found that though legally
schools must offer a fee-free option to pay by cash or check, there’s
rarely transparency around it. </p>
<p>“It wouldn’t have been a big deal if I had hundreds of dollars to
dump into her account at the beginning of the year,” Wood said. “I
didn’t. I was paying as I went, which meant I was paying a fee every
time. The $2.50 transaction fee was the price of a lunch. So I’d pay for
six lunches, but only get five.” </p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the federal policy
on fee-free school lunch, has mandated that districts inform families of
their options since 2017, but even when parents are aware, having to pay
by cash or check to avoid fees can be burdensome. </p>
<p>“It’s just massively inconvenient,” said Joanna Roa, 43, who works at
Clemson University in South Carolina as a library specialist and has two
school-aged children. </p>
<p>Roa said that when her son was in first grade and she saw the
$3.25-per-transaction fee for lunch account transactions, she and her
husband decided to send him to school with packed lunches instead. </p>
<p>“A dollar here and there, I expected,” she said. “But $3.25 per
transaction, especially here in rural South Carolina where the cost of
living is a lot lower — as are the salaries — is a lot.” </p>
<p>Roa said packing lunch for two kids every day, for two working
parents, was an increased burden of time and effort. For the past two
years, thanks to surplus funds, her school district has been providing
free lunches in school, which has changed the equation, but Roa said
that could end at any point. </p>
<p>In its review of the 300 largest public school districts in the U.S.,
the CFPB found that 87% of sampled districts contract with payment
processors. </p>
<p>Within those districts, the companies charge an average of $2.37 or
4.4% of the total transaction, each time money is added to a child’s
account. For families with lower incomes who can’t afford to load large
sums in one go, those fees can hit weekly or even more frequently,
increasing costs disproportionately. Families that qualify for free or
reduced lunch pay as much as 60 cents per dollar in fees when paying for
school lunches electronically, according to the report. </p>
<p>In Wood’s case, she researched the fees and learned about the USDA
requirement to offer fee-free payment by cash or by check. When she
pointed this out to the superintendent of her daughter’s Massachusetts
school district, the administrator said the lack of transparency was an
oversight. To protest, Wood had planned to pay for her daughter’s
lunches in coins at the school office, together with other parents. But
then the pandemic hit, changing, among other things, school lunch
policy. </p>
<p>In subsequent years, Wood became part of a campaign that successfully
pushed for universal free school lunches in the state, but she continues
to protest school processing fees for families. </p>
<p>“Even if lunch itself is free, if you want to buy something a la
carte, or an extra lunch, or some other transaction, you still have to
pay that fee,” Wood said. “They take money from people who need it the
most.” </p>
<p>While payment companies maintain that school districts have the
chance to negotiate fees and rates when they form their contracts, the
CFPB found that complex company structures “may insulate companies from
competition and make school districts less likely to negotiate.” Just
three companies — MySchoolBucks, SchoolCafe, and LINQ Connect — dominate
the market, according to the report. </p>
<p>Without the ability to choose which company to work with, “families
have fewer ways to avoid harmful practices,” the agency said, “including
those that may violate federal consumer protection law.” </p>
<p>The companies named in the report did not respond to requests for
comment. </p>
<p>I’m a parent facing these fees. What can I do? </p>
<p>Know that you always have a right to pay by cash or check, under
federal policy. You can also request that your school district negotiate
down the fees with their payment processing company, or request that the
district cover the fees directly, which can give them leverage in
negotiating a contract. </p>
<p>If your school is located in a low-income area, you may also check
whether your district qualifies for the Community Eligibility Provision,
which would allow the school to provide free breakfast and lunch to all
enrolled students. More information on the CEP is available at the U.S.
Department of Agriculture’s website.</p>

id="boeing-strike-could-last-a-while-workers-confident-of-higher-wages-union-says">Boeing
strike could last ‘a while’; workers confident of higher wages, union
says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SEATTLE — A strike at Boeing “could go on for a while” as workers are
confident they can get bigger wage increases and an improved pension,
union leader Jon Holden said in an interview with National Public Radio
on Saturday.</p>
<p>More than 30,000 members of the International Association of
Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), who produce Boeing’s top-selling
737 MAX and other jets in the Seattle and Portland, began a strike
Friday after overwhelmingly voting down a new contract.</p>
<p>Boeing and union negotiators are to return to the bargaining table
next week, in talks overseen by U.S. federal mediators, after more than
94% of workers voted to reject an initial contract offer that Holden had
endorsed.</p>
<p>Holden said the priorities for his members were a bigger wage
increase and the restoration of a defined-benefit pension scheme that
the union lost during a previous round of negotiations with Boeing a
decade ago.</p>
<p>“We have the most leverage and the most power at the most opportune
time that we’ve ever had in our history, and our members are expecting
us to use it,” Holden told NPR.</p>
<p>“I know that our members are confident. They’re standing shoulder to
shoulder and they’re ready. So it (the strike) could go on for a while,”
he said.</p>
<p>The initial deal included a 25% pay raise spread over four years and
a commitment by Boeing to build its next commercial jet in the Seattle
region, if the plane program is launched within the four-year period of
the contract.</p>
<p>Union members, venting frustration at years of stagnant wages and
rising living costs, said removal of a performance bonus in the Boeing
offer would erode half of the headline salary increase.</p>
<p>Boeing’s stock fell 3.7% on Friday. It has tumbled almost 40% so far
this year, slashing the company’s market value by roughly $58
billion.</p>
<p>A long strike could further damage Boeing’s finances, already
groaning because of $60 billion in debt. A lengthy pause on plane
production would also weigh on airlines that fly Boeing jets and
suppliers that manufacture parts.</p>

to use rest of term putting Ukraine in ‘best position,’ says
adviser</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Kyiv, Ukraine — U.S. President Joe Biden will use the remaining four
months of his term “to put Ukraine in the best possible position to
prevail,” a senior adviser said Saturday. </p>
<p>Speaking remotely to a forum in Kyiv, Ukraine, Jake Sullivan, the
U.S. national security adviser, also said Biden will meet Ukrainian
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in late September at the U.N. General
Assembly in New York to discuss aid to Ukraine. </p>
<p>“President Zelenskyy has said that ultimately this war has to end
through negotiations, and we need them to be strong in those
negotiations,” Sullivan said, adding Ukraine would decide when to enter
talks with Russia. </p>
<p>Biden will be replaced next January either by Vice President Kamala
Harris, who has indicated she will continue his policies of backing
Ukraine, or by former President Donald Trump, who would not say at a
debate earlier this week whether he wanted Kyiv to win the war. </p>
<p>The announcement of the upcoming Biden-Zelenskyy meeting came after
Moscow and Kyiv earlier Saturday swapped 103 prisoners of war each in a
UAE-brokered deal, and as Russian forces continue to gain ground in
their grinding offensive in east Ukraine. </p>
<p>Sullivan, in his comments by video link to the forum in Kyiv, said
“difficult and complicated” logistics — rather than unwillingness — was
delaying aid to Ukraine. </p>
<p>“It’s not a matter of political will,” Sullivan said. “But given what
Ukraine is up against, we’ve got to do more, and we’ve got to do
better.”</p>

id="venezuela-arrests-6-foreigners-including-americans-alleges-plot-to-kill-maduro">Venezuela
arrests 6 foreigners, including Americans, alleges plot to kill
Maduro</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BOGOTA, Colombia — Three Americans, two Spaniards and a Czech citizen
were arrested Saturday after Venezuelan officials accused them of coming
to the South American country to assassinate President Nicolas
Maduro.</p>
<p>The arrests were announced on state television by Diosdado Cabello,
the nation’s powerful interior minister. Cabello said the foreign
citizens were part of a CIA-led plot to overthrow the Venezuelan
government and kill several members of its leadership. In the television
program, Cabello showed images of rifles that he said were confiscated
from some of the plotters of the alleged plan.</p>
<p>The arrest of the American citizens included a member of the Navy,
according to Cabello. Spain’s embassy in Venezuela did not reply to a
request for comment.</p>
<p>The U.S. State Department late Saturday confirmed the detention of a
U.S. military member and said it was aware of “unconfirmed reports of
two additional U.S. citizens detained in Venezuela.”</p>
<p>“Any claims of U.S. involvement in a plot to overthrow Maduro are
categorically false. The United States continues to support a democratic
solution to the political crisis in Venezuela,” the statement said.</p>
<p>The announcement of the arrests comes two days after the U.S.
Treasury imposed sanctions on 16 allies of Maduro who were accused by
the U.S. government of obstructing voting during the disputed July 28
Venezuelan presidential election and carrying out human rights
abuses.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Spain’s parliament recognized opposition candidate
Edmundo Gonzalez as the winner of the election, angering Maduro allies
who called on the Venezuelan government to suspend commercial and
diplomatic relations with Spain.</p>
<p>Tensions between Venezuela’s government and the U.S. have increased
as well following the election, whose result sparked protests within
Venezuela in which hundreds of opposition activists were arrested.</p>
<p>Venezuela’s Electoral Council, which is closely aligned with the
Maduro administration, said Maduro won the election with 52% of the
vote, but did not provide any proof of those results.</p>
<p>Opposition activists, however, surprised the government by collecting
tally sheets from 80% of the nation’s voting machines. The tally sheets
collected by the opposition were published online, and they indicate
that Gonzalez won the election with twice as many votes as Maduro.</p>
<p>Despite international condemnation over the election’s lack of
transparency, Venezuela’s supreme court, which has long backed Maduro,
confirmed his victory in August. Venezuela’s attorney general then filed
conspiracy charges against Gonzalez, who fled to Spain last week after
it became clear he would be arrested.</p>
<p>Maduro has dismissed requests from several countries, including the
leftist governments of Colombia and Brazil, to provide tally sheets that
prove he won the election. Maduro, who has been in power since 2013, has
long claimed the U.S. is trying to overthrow him through sanctions and
covert operations.</p>
<p>The Maduro administration has previously used Americans imprisoned in
Venezuela to gain concessions from the U.S. government.</p>
<p>In a deal conducted last year with the Biden administration, Maduro
released 10 Americans and a fugitive wanted by the U.S. government to
secure a presidential pardon for Alex Saab, a close Maduro ally who was
held in Florida on money laundering charges. According to U.S.
prosecutors, Saab had also helped Maduro to avoid U.S. Treasury
sanctions through a complex network of shell companies.</p>

US face ‘shared challenge’ from China steel, PM hopeful says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>TOKYO — Japan and the United States should avoid confrontation about
the steel industry and work together amid competition from China, the
world’s top steelmaker, leading prime ministerial candidate Shinjiro
Koizumi said Saturday.</p>
<p>Sources told Reuters Friday that a powerful U.S. national security
panel reviewing Nippon Steel’s $14.9 billion bid for U.S. Steel faces a
September 23 deadline to recommend whether the White House should block
the deal.</p>
<p>Koizumi, Japan’s former environment minister, said at a debate
Saturday that Japan and the U.S. should not confront each other when it
comes to the steel industry but to face together the “shared challenge”
coming from China’s steel industry.</p>
<p>“If China, producing cheap steel without renewable or clean energy,
floods the global market, it will most adversely affect us, the
democratic countries playing by fair market rules,” Koizumi said.</p>
<p>Nippon Steel’s key negotiator on the deal, Vice Chairman Takahiro
Mori, said last month that his company and other Japanese steelmakers
were urging Tokyo to consider curbing cheap steel imports coming from
China to protect the local market.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel sent a letter to U.S.
President Joe Biden about their deal, as Biden, Democratic presidential
nominee Kamala Harris and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump
have all opposed the merger.</p>
<p>“We are also in the midst of elections, just like the U.S., and
during elections, various ideas may arise. Overreacting to each of these
would, in my view, call into question diplomatic judgment,” Koizumi said
when asked about the deal.</p>
<p>Sanae Takaichi, Japan’s minister in charge of economic security and
another prime ministerial candidate, also defended the deal during the
same debate attended by eight other Liberal Democratic Party’s, or LDP,
leadership contenders Saturday.</p>
<p>“It appears they are using CFIUS to frame this as an economic
security issue,” she said,  referring to the Committee on Foreign
Investment in the United States. “However, Japan and the U.S. are
allies, and the steel industry is about strengthening our combined
resilience.”</p>
<p>The 43-year-old son of former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, the
junior Koizumi, is seen as a leading contender in the September 27 race
to pick the LDP’s new leader, who will become the next prime minister
due to the party’s control of parliament.</p>
<p>Koizumi said Saturday that he would seek a dialog with the North
Korean leadership to resolve the issue over the abduction of Japanese
citizens kidnapped by North Korean agents in the 1970s and 1980s. The
purported primary goal was to train North Korean agents to impersonate
Japanese people.</p>
<p>“We want to explore new opportunities for dialog between people of
the same generation, without being bound by conventional approaches, and
without preconditions,” Koizumi said.</p>
<p>After admitting in 2002 that it had abducted 13 Japanese, North Korea
apologized and allowed five to return home. It said eight others had
died and denied that an additional four entered its territory. It
promised to reinvestigate but has never announced the results.</p>
<p>Japan says North Korea has refused to send the others home because of
concern that they might reveal inconvenient information about the
country.</p>

DePrince, whose career inspired many after she was born into war, dies
at 29</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>FORT LAUDERDALE, Florida — Ballet dancer Michaela Mabinty DePrince,
who came to the United States from an orphanage in war-ravaged Sierra
Leone and performed on some of the world’s biggest stages, has died, her
family said in a statement. She was 29.</p>
<p>“Michaela touched so many lives across the world, including ours. She
was an unforgettable inspiration to everyone who knew her or heard her
story,” her family said in a statement posted Friday on DePrince’s
social media accounts. “From her early life in war-torn Africa, to
stages and screens across the world, she achieved her dreams and so much
more.”</p>
<p>A cause of death was not provided.</p>
<p>DePrince was adopted by an American couple and by age 17 she had been
featured in a documentary film and had performed on the TV show “Dancing
with the Stars.”</p>
<p>After graduating from high school and the American Ballet Theatre’s
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis School, she became a principal dancer with
the Dance Theatre of Harlem. She then went to the Netherlands, where she
danced with the Dutch National Ballet. She later returned to the U.S.
and joined the Boston Ballet in 2021.</p>
<p>“We’re sending our love and support to the family of Michaela Mabinty
DePrince at this time of loss,” the Boston Ballet said in a statement to
The Associated Press on Saturday. “We were so fortunate to know her; she
was a beautiful person, a wonderful dancer, and she will be greatly
missed by us all.”</p>
<p>In her memoir, Taking Flight: From War Orphan to Star Ballerina, she
shared her journey from the orphanage to the stage. She also wrote a
children’s book, Ballerina Dreams.</p>
<p>DePrince suffered from a skin pigmentation disorder that had her
labeled “the devil’s child” at the orphanage.</p>
<p>“I lost both my parents, so I was there [the orphanage] for about a
year, and I wasn’t treated very well because I had vitiligo,” DePrince
told the AP in a 2012 interview. “We were ranked as numbers, and number
27 was the least favorite and that was my number, so I got the least
amount of food, the least amount of clothes and whatnot.”</p>
<p>She added that she remembered seeing a photo of an American ballet
dancer on a magazine page that had blown against the gate of the
orphanage during Sierra Leone’s civil war.</p>
<p>“All I remember is she looked really, really happy,” DePrince told
the AP, adding that she wished “to become this exact person.”</p>
<p>She said she saw hope in that photo, “and I ripped the page out and I
stuck it in my underwear because I didn’t have any place to put it,” she
said.</p>
<p>Her passion helped inspire young Black dancers to pursue their
dreams, her family said.</p>
<p>“We will miss her and her gorgeous smile forever and we know you
will, too,” their statement said.</p>
<p>Her sister, Mia Mabinty DePrince, recalled in the statement that they
slept on a shared mat in the orphanage and used to make up their own
musical theater plays and ballets.</p>
<p>“When we got adopted, our parents quickly poured into our dreams and
arose the beautiful, gracefully strong ballerina that so many of you
knew her as today. She was an inspiration,” Mia DePrince wrote. “Whether
she was leaping across the stage or getting on a plane and flying to
third-world countries to provide orphans and children with dance
classes, she was determined to conquer all her dreams in the arts and
dance.”</p>

says it is open to talks but rejects pressure from US, EU</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>DUBAI — Iran’s foreign minister said that Tehran was open to
diplomacy to solve disputes but not “threats and pressure,” state media
reported on Saturday, after the U.S. and three European powers imposed
sanctions against the country’s aviation sector.</p>
<p>Abbas Araqchi’s comments come a day after the European Union’s chief
diplomat said the bloc is considering new sanctions targeting Iran’s
aviation sector, in reaction to reports Tehran supplied Russia with
ballistic missiles in its war against Ukraine.</p>
<p>“Iran continues on its own path with strength, although we have
always been open to talks to resolve disputes … but dialogue should be
based on mutual respect, not on threats and pressure,” Araqchi said,
according to the official news agency IRNA.</p>
<p>Araqchi said on Wednesday that Tehran had not delivered any ballistic
missiles to Russia and that sanctions imposed on Iran by the United
States and three European powers would not solve any problems between
them.</p>
<p>The United States, Germany, Britain and France on Tuesday imposed new
sanctions on Iran, including measures against its national airline, Iran
Air.</p>

id="prince-harry-turns-40-as-the-royal-scamp-moves-to-middle-age">Prince
Harry turns 40 as the royal scamp moves to middle age</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LONDON — Prince Harry was always something different.</p>
<p>From the moment he first appeared in public, snuggled in Princess
Diana’s arms outside the London hospital where he was born in 1984,
Harry was the ginger-haired scamp who stuck his tongue out at
photographers. He grew to be a boisterous adolescent who was roundly
criticized for wearing a Nazi uniform to a costume party, and then a
young man who gave up the trappings of royal life and moved to Southern
California with his American wife.</p>
<p>Through it all, there was a sense that Harry was rebelling against an
accident of birth that made him, in the harsh calculus of the House of
Windsor, just “the spare.” As the second son of the man who is now King
Charles III, he was raised as a prince but wouldn’t inherit the throne
unless brother William came to harm.</p>
<p>Now the angry young man is turning 40, the halfway point in many
lives, providing a chance to either dwell on the past or look forward to
what might still be achieved.</p>
<p>For the past four years, Harry has focused mainly on the past, making
millions of dollars by airing his grievances in a wildly successful
memoir and a Netflix docu-series. But he faces the likelihood that the
royal aura so critical to his image may be fading, said Sally Bedell
Smith, author of “Charles: The Passions and Paradoxes of an Improbable
Life.”</p>
<p>“He is at a sort of crossroads,’’ Smith told The Associated Press.
“And he appears to be struggling with how he wants to proceed.’’</p>
<p>How did we get here?</p>
<p>It wasn’t always this way.</p>
<p>Six years ago, Harry and his wife were among the most popular royals,
a glamorous young couple who reflected the multicultural face of modern
Britain and were expected to help revitalize the monarchy.</p>
<p>Their wedding on May 19, 2018, united a grandson of Queen Elizabeth
II with the former Meghan Markle, a biracial American actress who had
starred for seven years in the U.S. television drama “Suits.” George
Clooney, Serena Williams and Elton John attended their wedding at
Windsor Castle, after which the couple were formally known as the Duke
and Duchess of Sussex.</p>
<p>But the optimism quickly faded amid allegations that Britain’s
tabloid media and even members of the royal household treated Meghan
unfairly because of racism.</p>
<p>By January 2020, the pressures of life in the gilded cage had become
too much, and the couple announced they were giving up royal duties and
moving to America, where they hoped to become “financially independent.”
They signed lucrative deals with Netflix and Spotify as they settled
into the wealthy enclave of Montecito, near Santa Barbara,
California.</p>
<p>Since then, Harry has missed few opportunities to bare his soul, most
famously in his memoir, aptly titled “Spare.”</p>
<p>In the ghostwritten book, Harry recounted his grief at the death of
Princess Diana, a fight with Prince William and his unease with life in
the royal shadow of his elder brother. From accounts of cocaine use and
losing his virginity to raw family rifts, the book was rife with damning
allegations about the royal family.</p>
<p>Among the most toxic was Harry’s description of how some family
members leaked unflattering information about other royals in exchange
for positive coverage of themselves. The prince singled out his father’s
second wife, Queen Camilla, accusing her of feeding private
conversations to the media as she sought to rehabilitate an image
tarnished by her role in the breakup of Charles’ marriage to Diana.</p>
<p>The allegations were so venomous that there is little chance of a
return to public duty, Smith said.</p>
<p>“He criticized the royal family in such a powerful and damaging way.
You can’t un-say those things,” she said. “And you can’t unsee things
like Meghan in that Netflix series doing a mock curtsey. It’s such a
demeaning gesture to the queen.’’</p>
<p>Harry, who agreed not to use the honorific HRH, or “his royal
highness,” after he stepped away from front-line royal duties, is now
fifth in line to the British throne, behind his brother and William’s
three children.</p>
<p>While he grew up in a palace and is said to be in line to inherit
millions of dollars on his 40th birthday from a trust set up by his
great-grandmother, applied developmental psychologist Deborah Heiser
thinks that, in many ways, Harry is just like the rest of us.</p>
<p>Like anyone turning 40, he is likely to have learned a few lessons
and has a good idea of who his real friends are, and that will help him
chart the next phase of his life, said Heiser, who writes a blog called
“The Right Side of 40” for Psychology Today.</p>
<p>“He has had a very public display of what a lot of people have gone
through,” Heiser said. “I mean, most people are not princes, but … they
have all kinds of issues within their families. He’s not alone. That’s
why he’s so relatable.’’</p>
<p>Harry’s next chapter</p>
<p>Of course, Harry’s story isn’t just about the drama within the House
of Windsor.</p>
<p>If he wants to write a new chapter, Harry can build on his 10 years
of service in the British Army. Before retiring as a captain in 2015,
the prince earned his wings as a helicopter pilot, served two tours in
Afghanistan and shed the hard-partying reputation of his youth.</p>
<p>Harry also won accolades for establishing the Invictus Games in 2014,
a Paralympic-style competition to inspire and aid in the rehabilitation
of sick and wounded servicemembers and veterans.</p>
<p>Harry and Meghan made headlines this year with their two
international trips to promote mental health and internet safety. While
some in British media criticized them for accepting royal treatment in
Nigeria and Colombia, the couple said they visited at the invitation of
local officials.</p>
<p>Will Charles see the grandkids?</p>
<p>The prospects of reconciliation are unclear, although Harry did race
home to see his father after Charles’ cancer diagnosis. And in what may
be seen as a tentative olive branch, the paperback edition of “Spare”
slated for October has no additions — so nothing new to stir the
pot.</p>
<p>But plainly at this point, Harry is thinking about his family in
California. He told the BBC about the importance of his two young
children, Archie and Lilibet.</p>
<p>“Being a dad is one of life’s greatest joys and has only made me more
driven and more committed to making this world a better place,” the
prince said in a statement released by his spokesperson.</p>

York City lawmakers approve bill to study slavery and reparations</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — New York City lawmakers approved legislation Thursday to
study the city’s significant role in slavery and consider reparations to
descendants of enslaved people.</p>
<p>If signed into law, the package of bills passed by the City Council
would follow in the footsteps of several other municipalities across the
U.S. that have sought ways to address the country’s dark history, as
well as a separate New York state commission that began working this
year.</p>
<p>New York fully abolished slavery in 1827. But businesses, including
the predecessors of some modern banks, continued to benefit financially
from the slave trade — likely up until 1866. The lawmakers behind the
proposals noted that the harms caused by the institution are still felt
by Black Americans today.</p>
<p>“The reparations movement is often misunderstood as merely a call for
compensation,” Council Member Farah Louis, a Democrat who sponsored one
of the bills, told the City Council on Thursday. She explained that
systemic forms of oppression are still impacting people through
redlining, environmental racism and services in predominantly Black
neighborhoods that are underfunded.</p>
<p>The bills still need to be signed by Democratic Mayor Eric Adams.
City Hall signaled his support in a statement calling the legislation
“another crucial step towards addressing systemic inequities, fostering
reconciliation, and creating a more just and equitable future for all
New Yorkers.”</p>
<p>The bills would direct the city’s Commission on Racial Equity to
suggest remedies to the legacy of slavery, including reparations. It
would also create a truth and reconciliation process to establish
historical facts about slavery in the state.</p>
<p>One of the proposals would also require that the city install an
informational sign on Wall Street in Manhattan to mark the site of New
York’s first slave market, which operated between 1711 and 1762. A sign
was placed nearby in 2015, but Public Advocate Jumaane D. Williams, a
Democrat who sponsored the legislation, said its location is
inaccurate.</p>
<p>The commission would work with the existing state commission, which
is also considering the possibility of reparations. A report from the
state panel, which held its first public meeting in late July, is
expected in early 2025. The city effort wouldn’t need to produce
recommendations until 2027.</p>
<p>The city’s commission was created out of a 2021 racial justice
initiative during then-Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration, which also
recommended the city track data on the cost of living and add a
commitment to remedy “past and continuing harms” to the city charter’s
preamble.</p>
<p>“Your call and your ancestors’ call for reparations had not gone
unheard,” Linda Tigani, executive director of the racial equity
commission, said at a news conference ahead of the council vote.</p>
<p>A financial impact analysis of the bills estimated that the studies
would cost $2.5 million.</p>
<p>New York is the latest city to study reparations. Tulsa, Oklahoma,
where a notorious massacre of Black residents took place in 1921,
announced a similar commission last month.</p>
<p>Evanston, Illinois, became the first city to offer reparations to
Black residents and their descendants in 2021, including distributing
some payments of $25,000 in 2023, according to PBS. The eligibility was
based on harm suffered as a result of the city’s discriminatory housing
policies or practices.</p>
<p>San Francisco approved reparations in February, but the mayor later
cut the funds, saying that reparations should instead be carried out by
the federal government. California budgeted $12 million for a
reparations program that included helping Black residents research their
ancestry, but it was defeated in the state’s Legislature this month.</p>

<h2 id="limited-role-for-us-navy-seal-team-in-defense-of-taiwan">Limited
role for US Navy SEAL team in defense of Taiwan</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The United States Navy’s elite SEAL Team Six would
likely have a limited role in defending Taiwan should China invade the
self-governing and democratic island, say analysts responding to a
Financial Times report that the unit has been training for it for more
than one year.</p>
<p>Lyle J. Morris, senior fellow for foreign policy and national
security at the Asia Society Policy Institute’s Center for China
Analysis, tells VOA’s Mandarin Service that if the unit is indeed
preparing for an attack by Beijing, it may indicate that the U.S. is
more deeply involved in defending Taiwan than previously thought.</p>
<p>However, he stressed that the secret and precise combat
characteristics of SEAL Team Six mean its role in resisting China’s
invasion of Taiwan would be very limited and the focus would be on
carrying out special tasks.</p>
<p>“As far as their sheer capability to repel an invasion. I think
that’s more limited,” he says. “I think it’s in a very discreet, narrow
way of coming in for a specific task that Taiwan might need, whether
it’s helping to protect, let’s say, an airfield in Taiwan or protect a
communication asset in Taiwan, in Taipei, they could come in and out
very discreetly and very lethally to protect that asset.”</p>
<p>SEAL Team Six specializes in performing sensitive, highly difficult
missions. In 2009, the unit rescued Richard Phillips, captain of the MV
Maersk Alabama, who was taken hostage by Somali pirates.</p>
<p>The elite unit gained an international reputation after the
successful raid on al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden’s compound in
Pakistan in 2011.</p>
<p>It is one of the most highly regarded U.S. military units, along with
the United States Army’s Delta Force, the 75th Ranger Regiment’s
Regimental Reconnaissance Company, the Intelligence Support Activity,
and the Air Force’s 24th Special Tactics Squadron, and part of the Joint
Special Operations Command.</p>
<p>“Navy SEALs usually deployed from submarines or, most likely, small
ships and are useful for targeting vulnerabilities in enemies’
presentation,” Richard D. Fisher Jr., senior fellow with the
International Assessment and Strategy Center, tells VOA.</p>
<p>Analysts say the U.S. military likely revealed the SEAL Team Six
training program to the Financial Times to send a warning to Beijing
amid China’s increasingly assertive moves in the region.</p>
<p>“This is one way the U.S. is bolstering deterrence towards China,
towards preventing a Chinese invasion of Taiwan,” says Morris. “So, I
think this is just an added factor getting China to second guess or to
reconsider what it will face if it were to invade Taiwan.”</p>
<p>Dennis Wilder, a senior fellow for the Initiative for U.S.-China
Dialogue on Global Issues at Georgetown University and a former Central
Intelligence Agency military analyst, posted on social media platform X,
“It is sure to get under Beijing’s skin.”</p>
<p>In a written response to VOA’s Mandarin Service, Liu Pengyu, the
spokesperson of the Chinese Embassy in Washington, said, “The Taiwan
question is the very core of China’s core interests and the first red
line that must not be crossed in the China-U.S. relationship.”</p>
<p>He urged “the U.S. to earnestly abide by the one-China principle and
the three China-U.S. joint communiques, stop enhancing military contact
with the Taiwan region or arming it by any means or under whatever
pretext, stop creating factors that could heighten tensions in the
Taiwan Strait, and stop conniving at and supporting the separatists’
attempt to seek ‘Taiwan independence’ by force.”</p>
<p>Taiwan split from China during the civil war that saw the Communist
Party seize power in Beijing in 1949 and the Nationalist Party flee to
the island, which developed into a flourishing democracy. But China’s
one-party, authoritarian state never gave up its claim to Taiwan and
considers it a renegade province that must one day reunite with the
mainland, by force if necessary.</p>
<p>Admiral Philips Davidson, former commander of the U.S. Indo-Pacific
Command, warned in 2021 that China could attack Taiwan within six years.
President Joe Biden has repeatedly stressed that if China invades
Taiwan, the U.S. will intervene militarily to defend it.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Defense declined to confirm or deny the
Financial Times report. Pentagon spokesperson John Supple said in an
email to VOA, “The DoD and our service members prepare and train for a
wide range of contingencies. We will not comment on specifics, but will
restate that we are committed to our longstanding one China policy,
guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, the Three Joint Communiques, and the
Six Assurances. As we have said before, conflict is neither imminent nor
inevitable.”</p>
<p>America’s one-China policy is a strategically ambiguous agreement it
made in 1972 to establish relations with China that recognizes Beijing
as the only government of China and acknowledges, but does not endorse,
Beijing’s claim that Taiwan is part of China.</p>
<p>Washington has unofficial relations with Taiwan defined through the
Taiwan Relations Act, the Three Joint Communiques with Beijing, and the
Six Assurances with Taipei, which underscore U.S. opposition to attempts
to unilaterally alter the status quo and determination to help Taiwan
defend itself through weapons sales.</p>
<p>There has been previous U.S. military training for Taiwan’s defense,
both on the island and in the United States. Reuters reported last year
the U.S. was set to expand the number of troops helping train Taiwanese
forces on the island, and Taiwanese officials confirmed more of their
troops would be training in the U.S.</p>

id="on-the-streets-of-a-colorado-city-pregnant-migrants-struggle-to-survive">On
the streets of a Colorado city, pregnant migrants struggle to
survive</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>AURORA, Colorado — She was eight months pregnant when she was forced
to leave her Denver homeless shelter. It was November.</p>
<p>Ivanni Herrera took her 4-year-old son, Dylan, by the hand and led
him into the chilly night, dragging a suitcase containing donated
clothes and blankets away from the Microtel Inn &amp; Suites. It was one
of 10 hotels where Denver has housed more than 30,000 migrants, many of
them Venezuelan, over the last two years.</p>
<p>First, they walked to Walmart. There, with money she and her husband
earned begging on the street, they bought a tent.</p>
<p>They chose for their new home a grassy median along a busy
thoroughfare in Aurora, the next town over, a suburb known for its
immigrant population.</p>
<p>“We wanted to go somewhere where there were people,” Herrera, 28,
said in Spanish. “It feels safer.”</p>
<p>That night, temperatures dipped to 32 degrees. And as she wrapped her
body around her son’s, Ivanni Herrera cried.</p>
<p>Over the past two years, a record number of Venezuelans have come to
the United States seeking a better life. Instead, they’ve found
themselves in communities roiling over how much to help the newcomers —
or whether to help at all.</p>
<p>Unable to legally work without filing expensive and complicated
paperwork, some have found themselves sleeping on the streets — even
those who are pregnant.</p>
<p>Herrera had found inspiration for her journey to the U.S. on social
media. On Facebook and TikTok, young, smiling Venezuelan migrants in
nice clothes stood in front of new cars. Some 320,000 Venezuelans have
tried to cross the U.S. border since October 2022, according to U.S.
Border Patrol reports — more than in the previous nine years
combined.</p>
<p>Just weeks after arriving in Denver, Herrera began to wonder if the
success she had seen was real.</p>
<p>She was seeing doctors and social workers at a Denver hospital where
she planned to give birth because they served everyone, even those
without insurance. They were alarmed their pregnant patient was now
sleeping outside in the cold.</p>
<p>In Colorado’s third-largest city, Aurora, officials have turned down
requests to help migrants. In February, the City Council passed a
resolution telling other cities and nonprofits not to bring migrants
into the community because it “does not currently have the financial
capacity to fund new services.” Yet still they come, because of its
lower cost of living and Spanish-speaking community.</p>
<p>Former President Donald Trump last week called attention to the city,
suggesting a Venezuelan gang had taken over an apartment complex.
Authorities say that hasn’t happened.</p>
<p>The doctors urged Herrera to sleep at the hospital. It wouldn’t cost
anything, they assured her, just as her birth would be covered by
emergency Medicaid.</p>
<p>Herrera refused.</p>
<p>“How,” she asked, “could I sleep in a warm place when my son is cold
on the street?”</p>
<p>Denver struggled to keep up with the rush of migrants, many arriving
on buses chartered by Texas to draw attention to the impact of
immigration. All told, Denver officials say they have helped some 42,700
migrants since last year, either by giving them shelter or a bus fare to
another city.</p>
<p>Initially, the city offered migrants with families six weeks in a
hotel. But any migrants arriving since May have received only three days
in a hotel. After that, some have found transportation to other cities,
scrounged for a place to sleep or wandered into nearby towns like
Aurora.</p>
<p>Today, fewer migrants are coming to the Denver area. But Candice
Marley, founder of a nonprofit called All Souls, still receives dozens
of outreaches per week from social service agencies looking to help
homeless migrants. All Souls had run encampments for migrants, but
Denver shut them down because they lacked a permit.</p>
<p>“It’s so frustrating that we can’t help them,” Marley said. “That
leaves families camping on their own, unsupported, living in their cars.
Kids can’t get into school. There’s no stability.”</p>
<p>When Herrera started feeling labor pains in early December, she
waited until she couldn’t bear the pain anymore and could feel the baby
getting close. She called an ambulance.</p>
<p>The paramedics didn’t speak Spanish but called an interpreter. They
told Herrera they had to take her to the closest hospital, instead of
the one in Denver, since her contractions were so close together.</p>
<p>Her son was born healthy at 7 pounds, 8 ounces. She took him to the
tent the next day. A few days later the whole family, including the
baby, had contracted chicken pox. “The baby was in a bad state,” said
Emily Rodriguez, a close friend living with her family in a tent next to
Herrera’s.</p>
<p>Herrera took him to the hospital, then returned to the tent before
being offered a way out. An Aurora woman originally from Mexico invited
the family to live with her — at first, for free. After a couple weeks,
the family moved to a small room in the garage for $800 a month.</p>
<p>To earn rent and pay expenses, Herrera and Rodriguez have cleaned
homes, painted houses and shoveled snow while their children waited in a
car by themselves. Finding regular work and actually getting paid for it
has been difficult. While their husbands can get semi-regular work in
construction, the women’s most consistent income comes from standing
outside with their children and begging. On a good day, each earns about
$50.</p>
<p>Herrera and her husband recently became eligible to apply for work
permits and legal residency for Venezuelans who arrived in the United
States last year. But it will cost $800 each for a lawyer to file the
paperwork, along with hundreds of dollars in government fees. They don’t
have the money.</p>
<p>What’s worse, they’re deeply in debt. Despite what the hospital had
said when she was pregnant, Herrera was never signed up for emergency
Medicaid. She says she owes $18,000 for the ambulance ride and delivery
of her baby. Now, she avoids going to the doctor or taking her children
because she’s afraid her large debt will jeopardize her chances of
staying in the U.S. “I’m afraid they’re going to deport me,” she
says.</p>
<p>Herrera and Rodriguez now hold cardboard signs along a busy street in
Denver and then knock on the doors of private homes, never returning to
the same address. They type up their request for clothes, food or money
on their phones and translate it to English using Google. They hand
their phones to whoever answers the door.</p>
<p>Herrera recently sent $500 to her sister to make the monthslong trip
from Venezuela to Aurora with Herrera’s 8-year-old daughter. “I’ll have
my family back together,” she says. And she believes her sister will be
able to watch her kids so Herrera can look for work.</p>
<p>The problem is, Herrera hasn’t told her family back in Venezuela how
she spends her time. “They think I’m fixing up homes and selling
chocolate and flowers,” she says. “I’m living a lie.”</p>
<p>Finally, her sister and daughter are waiting across the border in
Mexico. When we come to America, her sister asks, could we fly to
Denver? The tickets are $600.</p>
<p>Herrera has to come clean. Life is far more difficult than she has
let on.</p>
<p>She texts back:</p>
<p>No. </p>

<h2
id="ohio-city-reshaped-by-haitian-immigrants-lands-in-unwelcome-spotlight">Ohio
city reshaped by Haitian immigrants lands in unwelcome spotlight</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SPRINGFIELD, Ohio — Many cities have been reshaped by immigrants in
the last few years without attracting much notice. Not Springfield,
Ohio.</p>
<p>Its story of economic renewal and related growing pains has been
thrust into the national conversation in a presidential election year —
and maliciously distorted by false rumors that Haitian immigrants are
eating their neighbors’ pets. Donald Trump amplified those lies during
Tuesday’s nationally televised debate, exacerbating some residents’
fears about growing divisiveness in the predominantly white, blue-collar
city of about 60,000.</p>
<p>At the city’s Haitian Community Help and Support Center on Wednesday,
Rose-Thamar Joseph said many of the roughly 15,000 immigrants who
arrived in the past few years were drawn by good jobs and the city’s
relative affordability. But a rising sense of unease has crept in as
longtime residents increasingly bristle at newcomers taking jobs at
factories, driving up housing costs, worsening traffic and straining
city services.</p>
<p>“Some of them are talking about living in fear. Some of them are
scared for their life,” Joseph said.</p>
<p>A “Welcome To Our City” sign hangs from a parking garage downtown,
where a coffee shop, bakery and boutique line Springfield’s main drag,
North Fountain Street. A flag advertising “CultureFest,” the city’s
annual celebration of unity through diversity, waves from a pole
nearby.</p>
<p>Melanie Flax Wilt, a Republican commissioner in the county where
Springfield is located, said she has been pushing for community and
political leaders to “stop feeding the fear.”</p>
<p>“After the election and everybody’s done using Springfield, Ohio, as
a talking point for immigration reform, we are going to be the ones here
still living through the challenges and coming up with the solutions,”
she said.</p>
<p>Ariel Dominique, executive director of the Haitian American
Foundation for Democracy, said she laughed at first at the absurdity of
the false claims. But seeing the comments repeated on national
television by the former president was painful.</p>
<p>“It is so unfair and unjust and completely contrary to what we have
contributed to the world, what we have contributed to this nation for so
long,” Dominique said.</p>
<p>The falsehoods about Springfield’s Haitian immigrants were spread
online by Trump’s running mate, JD Vance, on the eve of Tuesday’s debate
between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. It’s part of a timeworn
American political tradition of casting immigrants as outsiders.</p>
<p>“This is what’s happening in our country. And it’s a shame,” Trump
said at the debate after repeating the falsehoods. When challenged by
ABC News moderator David Muir over the false claims, Trump held firm,
saying “people on television” said their dogs were eaten, but he offered
no evidence.</p>
<p>Officials in Springfield have tried to tamp down the misinformation
by saying there have been no credible or detailed reports of any pets
being abducted or eaten. State leaders are trying to help address some
of the real challenges facing the city.</p>
<p>Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, said Tuesday he would add more
law enforcement and health care resources to an aid package the state
has already provided to Springfield.</p>
<p>Many Haitians have come to the U.S. to flee poverty and violence.
They have embraced President Joe Biden’s new and expanded legal pathways
to enter, and have shunned illegal crossings, accounting for only 92
border arrests out of more than 56,000 in July, the latest data
available.</p>
<p>The Biden administration recently announced an estimated 300,000
Haitians in the U.S. could remain in the country at least through
February 2026, with eligibility for work authorization, under a law
called Temporary Protected Status. The goal is to spare people from
being deported to countries in turmoil.</p>
<p>Springfield, about 72 kilometers from the state capital of Columbus,
suffered a steep decline in its manufacturing sector toward the end of
the last century, and its population shrank as a result. But its
downtown has been revitalized in recent years as more Haitians arrived
and helped meet the rising demand for labor as the economy emerged from
the pandemic. Officials say Haitians now account for about 15% of the
population.</p>
<p>The city was shaken last year when a minivan slammed into a school
bus, killing an 11-year-old boy. The driver was a Haitian man who
recently settled in the area and was driving without a valid license.
During a city commission meeting on Tuesday, the boy’s parents condemned
politicians’ use of their son’s death to stoke hatred.</p>
<p>Last week, a post on the social media platform X shared what looked
like a screengrab of a social media post apparently out of Springfield.
The post claimed without evidence that the person’s “neighbor’s
daughter’s friend” saw a cat hanging from a tree to be butchered and
eaten, outside a house where it claimed Haitians lived. It was
accompanied by a photo of a Black man carrying what appeared to be a
goose by its feet.</p>
<p>On Monday, Vance posted on X: “Reports now show that people have had
their pets abducted and eaten by people who shouldn’t be in this
country.” The next day, he posted again, saying his office had received
inquiries from Springfield residents who said “their neighbors’ pets or
local wildlife were abducted by Haitian migrants.”</p>
<p>Longtime Springfield resident Chris Hazel, who knows the park and
neighborhood where the pet and goose abductions were purported to have
happened, called the claims “preposterous.”</p>
<p>“It reminds me of when people used to accuse others and outsiders as
cannibals. It’s dehumanizing a community,” he said of the accusations
against the city’s Haitian residents.</p>
<p>Sophia Pierrilus, the daughter of a former Haitian diplomat who moved
to the Ohio capital of Columbus 15 years ago and is now an immigrant
advocate, agreed, calling it all political.</p>
<p>“My view is that’s their way to use Haitians as a scapegoat to bring
some kind of chaos in America,” she said.</p>
<p>With its rising population of immigrants, Springfield is hardly an
outlier. So far this decade, immigration has accounted for almost
three-quarters of U.S. population growth, with 2.5 million immigrants
arriving in the United States between 2020 and 2023, according to the
U.S. Census Bureau. Population growth is an important driver of economic
growth.</p>
<p>“The Haitian immigrants who started moving to Springfield the last
few years are the reason why the economy and the labor force has been
revitalized there,” said Guerline Jozef, executive director of the
Haitian Bridge Alliance, which provides legal and social services to
immigrants across the U.S.</p>
<p>Now, she said, Haitians in Springfield have told her that, out of
fear, they are considering leaving the city.</p>

id="share-of-foreign-born-people-in-us-is-at-highest-rate-in-over-a-century-survey-says">Share
of foreign-born people in US is at highest rate in over a century,
survey says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>miami — The percentage of U.S. residents who were foreign-born last
year grew to its highest level in more than a century, according to
figures released Thursday from the most comprehensive survey of American
life. </p>
<p>The share of people born outside the United States increased in 2023
to 14.3% from 13.9% in 2022, according to estimates from the U.S. Census
Bureau’s annual American Community Survey, which tracks commuting times,
internet access, family life, income, education levels, disabilities,
military service and employment, among other topics. </p>
<p>International migrants have become a primary driver of population
growth this decade, increasing their share of the overall population as
fewer children are being born in the U.S. compared with numbers from
years past. The rate of the foreign-born population in the United States
hasn’t been this high since 1910, when it was 14.7%, driven by waves of
people emigrating in search of a better life. </p>
<p>“We knew that here you can have savings, live well. Here you can have
normal services such as water and electricity,” said Luciana Bracho, who
moved legally to Miami from Venezuela as part of a humanitarian parole
program with her boyfriend, parents and brother in April 2023. “I like
Miami and the opportunities that I have had.” </p>
<p>In 2023, international migrants accounted for more than two-thirds of
the population growth in the United States, and so far this decade they
have made up almost three-quarters of U.S. growth. </p>
<p>The growth appears to have been driven by people coming from Latin
America, whose share of the foreign-born population increased
year-over-year to 51.2% from 50.3%, according to the estimates. Latin
America was the only world region of origin to experience an increase
among those U.S. residents born in another country, as the share of
foreign-born residents from Europe and Asia dropped slightly. </p>
<p>Nicole Díaz, a Venezuelan opposition activist, left after receiving
threats to her life and lived in Peru and Ecuador before moving to the
Miami area legally in February 2023 with her husband and 9-year-old
daughter. Díaz described herself as “100% happy” living in South
Florida, where they pay $2,300 a month for a two-bedroom apartment. </p>
<p>“After being in different countries, working here is relaxed, despite
the language,” Díaz said. “But housing is very expensive, and we have
been evaluating moving to another state because here all the salary goes
for the rent.” </p>
<p>Among the states with the largest year-over-year bumps in the
foreign-born population was Delaware, going to 11.2% from 9.9%; Georgia,
to 11.6% from 10.7%; and New Mexico, to 10.2% from 9.3% The share of the
foreign-born population dropped slightly in Washington, D.C., Idaho,
Iowa, Maine, Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota and Oregon. </p>
<p>The Census Bureau figures don’t distinguish whether people are in the
United States legally or illegally. Illegal immigration has become a top
issue in the 2024 presidential race, even as illegal border crossings
from Mexico plunged this summer after reaching a record last
December. </p>
<p>The share of U.S. residents who identify as Hispanic, no matter what
race, rose last year to 19.4% from 19.1% in the previous year, according
to the survey. At the same time, those who identify as non-Hispanic
white alone dropped from 57.7% to 57.1%. The share of U.S. residents who
identify as Black alone dropped slightly, from 12.2% to 12.1%, and it
increased slightly for those who identify as Asian alone from 5.9% to
6%. </p>
<p>Residents in the United States continued to get older, with the
median age increasing from 39 in 2022 to 39.2 in 2023. The nation’s
aging is taking place as a majority of baby boomers have become senior
citizens and millennials are entering middle age. While the share of
children under age 18 remained steady at 21.7% year-over-year, the share
of senior citizens age 65 and over increased to 17.7% from 17.3%. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, a post-pandemic bump in working from home continued its
slide back to pre-COVID-19 times, as the share of employees working from
home dropped last year to 13.8% from 15.2% in the previous year. </p>
<p>In 2021, the first full year after the pandemic’s start, almost 18%
of employees were working from home, up from 5.7% in 2019. But
return-to-office mandates in the past two years have reversed that trend
and caused commute times to bump up slightly last year, growing on
average to 26.8 minutes from 26.4 minutes. </p>
<p>The survey also showed that the median cost of renting, plus
utilities and related expenses, grew faster than median home values in
2023 for the first time in a decade. The 3.8% jump in rental costs was
the largest annual increase since at least 2011. Despite the spike in
rental costs, the share of renter income spent on rent and utilities
remained unchanged at 31% in 2023, suggesting that incomes kept pace
with rent hikes, the Census Bureau said.</p>

battle for influence in Africa plays out in Central African
Republic</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BANGUI, Central African Republic — Hours after Russian mercenary
leader Yevgeny Prigozhin rebelled against his country’s top military
leaders, his private army’s biggest client in Africa panicked, turning
for help to his foe in the West. </p>
<p>Officials from Central African Republic, where some 1,500 of
Prigozhin’s Wagner Group mercenaries were stationed, wrote a letter that
day, requesting to “rapidly” arrange a meeting with a private U.S.
security firm to discuss collaboration. </p>
<p>Dated June 23, 2023, the day Prigozhin launched the armed rebellion,
the letter sparked a series of meetings, culminating in a deal with the
central African nation and Bancroft Global Development. That sparked
backlash from Russian mercenaries, according to a dozen diplomats,
locals, and analysts. </p>
<p>The tensions in Central African Republic are a window into a larger
battle playing out across the continent as Moscow and Washington vie for
influence. </p>
<p>The Russian mercenaries — using success in staving off rebels in this
impoverished nation as a model for expansion — have long been accused by
locals and rights groups of stripping natural resources such as minerals
and timber and are linked to the torture and death of civilians. In the
wake of Prigozhin’s rebellion and suspicious death in a plane crash, the
Russians are recalibrating their Africa operations. The United States,
which has been largely disengaged from the region for years, is
attempting to maintain a presence and stymie Russian gains as it pushes
African countries to distance themselves from the mercenaries. </p>
<p>U.S. officials blame Russia for anti-American sentiment in the region
and say they’re trying to shift the narrative. </p>
<p>“If the U.S. can’t regain a foothold, it could give Russia greater
economic and political leverage,” said Samuel Ramani of the Royal United
Services Institute, a defense and security think tank. “If Russia loses
Central African Republic, its flagship model on the continent, there
could be a domino effect in other countries.” </p>
<p>Russia’s influence </p>
<p>In recent years, Russia has emerged as the security partner of choice
for a growing number of governments in the region, displacing
traditional allies such as France and the U.S. </p>
<p>Moscow expanded its military cooperation by using mercenaries like
Wagner, which since around 2017 has operated in at least half a dozen
countries by protecting African leaders and in some cases helping fight
rebels and extremists. </p>
<p>They’re also plagued by their human rights record. Two years ago in
Mali, Wagner and the army were accused of executing about 300 men — some
suspected of being Islamist extremists, but most civilians — in what
Human Rights Watch called the worst single atrocity reported in the
country’s decade-long armed conflict. And in Central African Republic,
mercenaries train the army on torture tactics, including how to tburn
people alive, according to watchdog The Sentry. </p>
<p>Central African Republic </p>
<p>Central African Republic was one of the first places the mercenaries
entered. The country has been in conflict since 2013, when predominantly
Muslim rebels seized power and forced the president from office. Six of
the 14 armed groups that signed a 2019 peace deal later left the
agreement. Locals and the government credited Wagner with fighting back
rebels who tried to overtake Bangui, the capital, in 2021. The Russians
soon expanded to Burkina Faso and Niger, and have ambitions for further
growth. </p>
<p>Russia is refurbishing a military base some 80 kilometers from
Bangui. Alexander Bikantov, Russia’s ambassador to Central African
Republic, said the base will improve the country’s security. </p>
<p>Fidele Gouandjika, adviser to President Faustin-Archange Touadera,
said the base aims to have 10,000 fighters by 2030 to engage with more
African nations. </p>
<p>Touadera’s office didn’t reply to written requests for comment for
this story. His adviser to the country’s spy agency declined to be
interviewed. </p>
<p>Pressure from United States </p>
<p>The U.S. had been pushing Central African Republic to find an
alternative to Wagner for years. A more assertive U.S. approach came as
it faced new setbacks and tried to rework agreements in the region. Its
troops left Chad and Niger, where they were no longer welcome. </p>
<p>Still, the State Department said in a statement this year that it
wasn’t involved in the decision to establish Bancroft Global
Development’s presence in Central African Republic. </p>
<p>But Washington could deny such contracts if it wanted, said Sean
McFate, a former contractor in Africa and author of “The New Rules of
War.” </p>
<p>The U.S. has used private military companies to reduce American
“boots on the ground” in Africa, McFate said, and companies like
Bancroft have to play by Washington’s rules if they want future
government work. </p>
<p>In response to AP questions, the U.S. official who spoke on condition
of anonymity said it uses private contractors in Africa to help
countries operate more effectively, with U.S. government oversight to
ensure accountability. The official said the State Department has
overseen Bancroft’s work in Somalia but not Central African Republic or
elsewhere. </p>
<p>Bancroft’s background </p>
<p>Washington-based Bancroft is a nonprofit working in nine countries —
five in Africa. Its involvement in Central African Republic has been
shrouded in secrecy since signs emerged of its presence last fall. </p>
<p>During an AP visit months later, rumors swirled about Bancroft’s
activities, fueling speculation the U.S was bringing its own Wagner to
oust Russia. </p>
<p>But according to Bancroft founder Michael Stock, the group entered at
Bangui’s behest. </p>
<p>Stock received the letter from the presidency within a day of
Prigozhin’s mutiny, and the two signed a deal in September, he
said. </p>
<p>Fewer than 30 Bancroft personnel work there, Stock said, helping
Central African Republic with intelligence systems, interagency
cooperation and law enforcement. </p>
<p>Bancroft has invested some $1.4 million there, Stock said. </p>
<p>Much of Bancroft’s funding has come from U.S. and United Nations
grants. From 2018 to 2020, it received more than $43 million from the
U.S., according to audits required as part of tax forms. </p>
<p>Amal Ali, a former U.S. intelligence analyst, is among critics who
say that despite its yearslong presence in Somalia, Bancroft hasn’t
contributed to any eradication of terrorism. </p>
<p>Stock dismissed such comments as uninformed and said the Somali and
U.S. governments “agree Bancroft has done a great deal to damaging
illegal armed groups and developing the capacity of the government to
perform its national defense functions professionally.” </p>
<p>Backlash on the ground </p>
<p>Rights groups say a lack of transparency about Bancroft’s operations
has fostered an atmosphere of distrust in a country already rampant with
armed actors. Wagner, a U.N. peacekeeping mission and Rwandan troops are
all on the ground to try to quell violence. </p>
<p>“Operating in a vague and nontransparent way in the Central African
Republic only leads to suspicion,” said Lewis Mudge, of Human Rights
Watch. </p>
<p>Stock defended Bancroft’s work and policies. “It is perfectly normal
for a government not to publicize how it is defending the people and the
state,” he told AP. </p>
<p>Unclear future </p>
<p>As the U.S. and Russia jockey for power, African governments say they
want to make their own choices. </p>
<p>Central African Republic officials approached Bancroft, which shows
that these governments haven’t become Russian puppets, said Jack
Margolin, an expert on private military companies. </p>
<p>But, he added, Russia’s reaction to Bancroft could hurt Moscow’s
standing with other nations. </p>
<p>After Prigozhin’s death, Russia moved quickly to take control of
Wagner’s assets, and the defense ministry told countries where Wagner
operated that it would take over. The country and its military
intelligence arm have taken a more direct role in Africa operations,
deploying more official detachments from its army. </p>
<p>In Central African Republic, it’s unclear how much sway the Russian
state has with the mercenaries, who are beloved by many. For most people
here, there’s little interest in squabbles among foreign nations. </p>
<p>“There are problems between the Americans and Russians, but that
doesn’t matter to us,” said Jean Louis Yet, who works at Bangui’s
market. “We are here working, trying our best to make a living. All we
want is security.”</p>

<h2 id="mounting-north-korean-threats-await-next-us-president">Mounting
North Korean threats await next US president</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — Recent moves by Pyongyang have focused attention on what
will be one of the first major foreign policy challenges facing the next
U.S. president: how to deal with North Korea’s rapidly developing
nuclear threat.</p>
<p>In a set of rapid-fire developments on Friday:</p>
<p>— North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called for an “exponential
increase” in the size of his nation’s nuclear arsenal, according to the
state-run news agency KCNA. He made the same call in speeches on Tuesday
and on the last day of 2022.</p>
<p>— State media released photos for the first time of the Nuclear
Weapons Institute where North Korea processes uranium for the
manufacture of nuclear weapons. The photos, which showed a sophisticated
array of centrifuges, were made public as Kim toured the facility.</p>
<p>— North Korea announced that it had tested a new type of 600 mm
multiple rocket launcher the previous day. South Korea said on Thursday
that North Korea test-fired several short-range ballistic missiles into
the waters off the eastern coast.</p>
<p>The developments came in the context of enhanced military cooperation
between North Korea and Russia, which is believed to be helping
Pyongyang to develop its weapons capabilities in exchange for munitions
used in Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>“The threat from North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs has been
growing steadily and virtually unchecked over the course of several U.S.
administrations,” said Evans Revere, a former State Department official
with extensive experience negotiating with North Korea.</p>
<p>“Whoever the next U.S. president is, she or he will face a more
sophisticated and dangerous North Korean threat.”</p>
<p>Revere said in an interview that the winner of the U.S. election
would have to find ways to weaken the link between Moscow and Pyongyang
“and demonstrate to Beijing that its ‘partnership without limits’ with
Russia is a dangerous and ill-advised path that will yield no benefits”
for China.</p>
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping
declared in May a “new era” in opposition to the U.S. and reaffirmed the
“no limits” partnership that was first announced just days before
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.</p>
<p>While China has held back on providing Russia with arms for its war
effort, the United States has accused it of delivering electronic
components and other dual-use items that are keeping Moscow’s arms
industry afloat.</p>
<p>Pyongyang, for its part, denies participating in any arms transfers
to Russia, an act that would violate United Nations sanctions.</p>
<p>But a report this week by Conflict Armament Research, a U.K.-based
group that tracks weapons in armed conflicts, said parts from four North
Korean missiles have been found in Ukraine.</p>
<p>The missiles, examined by Kyiv, are either KN-23 or KN-24, known as
Hwasong-11 short-range missile series, and thought to have been used in
attacks in July and August, the report said.</p>
<p>Pyongyang-Moscow military ties have also been expanded to include
tourism, trade, and economic and technical cooperation.</p>
<p>This makes the use of sanctions less effective as a policy tool to
counter North Korea’s nuclear buildup, according to Gary Samore, former
White House coordinator for arms control and weapons of mass destruction
during the Obama administration.</p>
<p>“That’s not as much leverage now as it was before because of the
Russian-North Korean relationship,” said Samore. “The U.S. doesn’t have
very strong economic leverage that it can use with North Korea.”</p>
<p>With few obvious policy options available, the two presidential
candidates – former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala
Harris – have largely confined themselves to criticizing each other’s
approach without laying out any specific plans to roll back the North
Korean threat.</p>
<p>At Tuesday night’s televised debate, Harris criticized Trump for
exchanging “love letters with Kim Jong Un” during his presidency while
Trump disapproved of the current administration’s handling of the issue,
saying, “Look at what’s going on in North Korea.”</p>
<p>During his presidency, Trump held three summits with Kim but the
diplomatic effort ultimately failed when Trump refused Kim’s demand for
sanctions relief in exchange for a partial rollback of his nuclear
program.</p>
<p>There have been no formal talks between the two countries since,
although the Biden administration insists it is open to negotiations
without preconditions, a policy that Harris could be expected to
continue if elected.</p>
<p>The Biden administration also maintains that its goal remains the
complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, even as many experts
suggest it is time to acknowledge that Pyongyang will not give up its
weapons and say the international community should focus on
containment.</p>
<p>Samore predicted that a Harris administration would continue to say
that “as an ultimate objective … the U.S. seeks denuclearization in the
long term.”</p>
<p>A second Trump administration, he theorized, may say
“denuclearization is no longer possible” and “accept North Korea as a
nuclear power.”</p>
<p>Robert Rapson, who served as charge d’affaires and deputy chief of
mission at the U.S. Embassy in Seoul from 2018 to 2021, said much would
depend on how the winner of the election decides to work with regional
allies South Korea and Japan.</p>
<p>“In the likely absence of any grand outreach towards Pyongyang,
Harris will have to carefully manage the relationship with ally Seoul,
with a focus for the foreseeable future on maintaining peace and
stability on the peninsula,” he said.</p>
<p>He added that it was “uncertain at this moment” whether Trump would
feel compelled to reach out to Kim and whether he would diminish the
value of the alliances with South Korea and Japan.</p>
