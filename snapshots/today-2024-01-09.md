## Pluralistic: Kelly and Zach Weinersmith's "A City On Mars" (09 Jan 2024)

date: 2024-01-09, from: Cory Doctorow's blog

Today's links Kelly and Zach Weinersmith's "A City On Mars": Life in space sucks, is grotesquely expensive, and produces little useful science. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2004, 2009, 2014, 2019 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading Kelly and Zach Weinersmith's "A City On Mars" (permalink) In A City On Mars, biologist Kelly Weinersmith and cartoonist Zach Weinersmith set out to investigate the governance challenges of the impending space settlements they were told were just over the horizon. Instead, they discovered that humans aren't going to be settling space for a very long time, and so they wrote a book about that instead: https://www.acityonmars.com/ The Weinersmiths make the (convincing) case that ever aspect of space settlement is vastly beyond our current or reasonably foreseeable technical capability. What's more, every argument in favor of pursuing space settlement is errant nonsense. And finally: all the energy we are putting into space settlement actually holds back real space science, which offers numerous benefits to our species and planet (and is just darned cool). Every place we might settle in space &#8211; giant rotating rings, the Moon, Mars &#8211; is vastly more hostile than Earth. Not just more hostile than Earth as it stands today &#8211; the most degraded, climate-wracked, nuke-blasted Earth you can imagine is a paradise of habitability compared to anything else. Mars is covered in poison and the sky disappears under planet-sized storms that go on and on. The Moon is covered in black-lung-causing, razor-sharp, electrostatically charged dust. Everything is radioactive. There's virtually no water. There are temperature swings of hundreds of degrees every couple of hours or weeks. You're completely out of range of resupply, emergency help, or, you know, air. There's Helium 3 on the Moon, but not much of it, and there is no universe in which is it cheaper to mine for Helium 3 on the Moon than it is to mine for it on Earth. That's generally true of anything we might bring back from space, up to and including continent-sized chunks of asteroid platinum. Going to space doesn't end war. The countries that have gone to space are among the most militarily belligerent in human history. The people who've been to space have come back perfectly prepared to wage war. Going to space won't save us from the climate emergency. The unimaginably vast trove of material and the energy and advanced technology needed to lift it off Earth and get it to Mars is orders of magnitude more material and energy than we would need to resolve the actual climate emergency here. We aren't anywhere near being a "multiplanetary species." The number of humans you need in a colony to establish a new population is hard to estimate, but it's very large. Larger than we can foreseeably establish on the Moon, on Mars, or on a space-station. But even if we could establish such a colony, there's little evidence that it could sustain itself &#8211; not only are we a very, very long way off from such a population being able to satisfy its material needs off-planet, but we have little reason to believe that children could gestate, be born, and grow to adulthood off-planet. To top it all off, there's space law &#8211; the inciting subject matter for this excellent book. There's a lot of space law, and while there are some areas of ambiguity, the claims of would-be space entrepreneurs about how their plans are permissible under the settled parts of space law don't hold up. But those claims are robust compared to claims that space law will simply sublimate into its constituent molecules when exposed to the reality of space travel, space settlement, and (most importantly) space extraction. Space law doesn't exist in a vacuum (rimshot). It is parallel to &#8211; and shares history with &#8211; laws regarding Antarctica, the ocean's surface, and the ocean's floor. These laws relate to territories that are both vastly easier to access and far more densely populated by valuable natural resources. The fact that they remain operative in the face of economic imperatives demands that space settlement advocates offer a more convincing account than "money talks, bullshit walks, space law is toast the minute we land on a $14 quadrillion platinum asteroid." The Weinersmiths have such an account in defense of space law: namely, that space law, and its terrestrial analogs, constitute a durable means of resolving conflicts that would otherwise give to outcomes that are far worse for science, entrepreneurship, human thriving or nation-building than the impediments these laws represent. What's more, space law is enforceable. Not only would any space settlement be terribly, urgently dependent on support from Earth for the long-foreseeable future, but every asteroid miner, Lunar He3 exporter and Martian potato-farmer hoping to monetize their products would have an enforcement nexus with a terrestrial nation and thus the courts of that nation. But the Weinersmiths aren't anti-space. They aren't even anti-space-settlement. Rather, they argue that the path to space-based scientific breakthroughs, exploration of our solar system, and a deeper understanding of our moral standing in a vast universe cannot start with space settlements. Landing people on the Moon or Mars any time soon is a stunt &#8211; a very, very expensive stunt. These boondoggles aren't just terribly risky (though they are &#8211; people who attempt space settlement are very likely to die horribly and after not very long), they come with price-tags that would pay for meaningful space science. For the price of a crewed return trip to Mars, you could put multiple robots onto every significant object in our solar system, and pilot an appreciable fleet of these robot explorers back to Earth with samples. For the cost of a tiny, fraught, lethal Moon-base, we could create hundreds of experiments in creating efficient, long-term, closed biospheres for human life. That's the crux of the Weinersmiths' argument: if you want to establish space settlements, you need to do a bunch of other stuff first, like figure out life-support, learn more about our celestial neighbors, and vastly improve our robotics. If you want to create stable space-settlements, you'll need to create robust governance systems &#8211; space law that you can count on, rather than space law that you plan on shoving out the airlock. If you want humans to reproduce in space &#8211; a necessary precondition for a space settlement that lasts more than a single human lifespan &#8211; then we need to do things like breed multiple generations of rodents and other animals, on space stations. Space is amazing. Space science is amazing. Crewed scientific space missions are amazing. But space isn't amazing because it offers a "Plan B" for an Earth that is imperiled by humanity's recklessness. Space isn't amazing because it offers unparalleled material wealth, or unlimited energy, or a chance to live without laws or governance. It's not amazing because it will end war by mixing the sensawunda of the "Pale Blue Dot" with the lebensraum of an infinite universe. A science-driven approach to space offers many dividends for our species and planet. If we can figure out how to extract resources as dispersed as Lunar He3 or asteroid ice, we'll have solved problems like extracting tons of gold from the ocean or conflict minerals from landfill sites, these being several orders of magnitude more resource-dense than space. If we can figure out how to create self-sustaining terraria for large human populations in the radiation-, heat- and cold-blasted environs of space, we will have learned vital things about our own planet's ecosystems. If we can build the robots that are necessary for supporting a space society, we will have learned how to build robots that take up the most dangerous and unpleasant tasks that human workers perform on Earth today. In other words, it's not just that we should solve Earth's problems before attempting space settlement &#8211; it's that we can't settle space until we figure out the solutions to Earth's problems. Earth's problems are far simpler than the problems of space settlement. As I read the Weinersmiths' critique of space settlement, I kept thinking of the pointless AI debates I keep getting dragged into. Arguments for space settlement that turn on existential risks (like humanity being wiped out by comets, sunspots, nuclear armageddon or climate collapse) sound an awful lot like the arguments about "AI safety" &#8211; the "risk" that the plausible sentence generator is on the verge of becoming conscious and turning us all into paperclips. Both arguments are part of a sales-pitch for investment in commercial ventures that have no plausible commercial case, but whose backers are hoping to get rich anyway, and are (often) sincerely besotted with their own fantasies: https://locusmag.com/2023/12/commentary-cory-doctorow-what-kind-of-bubble-is-ai/ Both AI and space settlement pass over the real risks, such as the climate consequences of their deployment, or the labor conditions associated with their production. After all, when you're heading off existential risk, you don't stop to worry about some carbon emissions or wage theft. And critically, both ignore the useful (but resolutely noncommercial) ways that AI or space science can benefit our species. AI radiology analysis might be useful as an adjunct to human radiological analysis, but that is more expensive, not less. Space science might help us learn to use our materials more efficiently on Earth, and that will come long before anyone makes rendezvous with a $14 quadrillion platinum asteroid. There are beneficial uses for LLMs. When the Human Rights Data Analysis Group uses an LLM to help the Innocence Project New Orleans extract and categorize officer information from wrongful conviction records, they are doing something valuable and important: https://hrdag.org/tech-notes/large-language-models-IPNO.html It's socially important work, a form of automation that is an unalloyed good, but you won't hear about it from LLM advocates. No one is gonna get rich on improving the efficiency of overturning wrongful convictions with natural language processing. You can't inflate a stock bubble with the Innocence Project. By the same token, learning about improving gestational health by breeding multigenerational mouse families in geosynchronous orbit is no way to get a billionaire tech baron to commit $250 billion to space science. But that's not an argument against emphasizing real science that really benefits our whole species. It's an argument for taking away capital allocation authority from tech billionaires. I'm a science fiction writer. I love stories about space. But I can distinguish fantasy from reality and thought experiments from suggestions. Kim Stanley Robinson's 2015 novel Aurora &#8211; about failed space settlement &#8211; is every bit as fascinating and inspirational as "golden age" sf: https://memex.craphound.com/2015/11/02/kim-stanley-robinsons-aurora-space-is-bigger-than-you-think/ But still, it inspired howls of outrage from would-be space colonists. So much so that Stan wrote a brilliant essay explaining what we were all missing about space settlement, which I published: https://boingboing.net/2015/11/16/our-generation-ships-will-sink.html With City on Mars, the Weinersmiths aren't making the case for giving up on space, nor are they trying to strip space of its romance and excitement. They're trying to get us to focus on the beneficial, exciting, serious space science we can do right now, not just because it's attainable and useful &#8211; but because it is a necessary precondition for any actual space settlement in the distant future.

## MNT Reform - a hackable laptop, not for everyone

<p>The <a href="https://shop.mntre.com/products/mnt-reform">MNT Reform</a>'s design, the components, <em>everything</em>—is open source. If iFixIt did a teardown, they'd probably give it an 11 out of 10.</p>

<p>You can replace <em>individual battery cells!</em> Some people with these laptops hacked in their own speakers, added more internal Ethernet, or even swapped out the CPU itself.</p>

<p>Does that mean I think you should buy it? No, probably not. It's expensive (<a href="https://shop.mntre.com/products/mnt-reform">starting at €1199</a>), and it's built for a certain type of person. It's not gonna replace a MacBook or a cheap Chromebook.</p>

<p>But why does this exist, and why am I excited about it?</p>

This is the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartner_hype_cycle"><i>Gartner hype cycle</i></a> and it certianly appears that autonomous vehicles are currently in the <i>Trough of Disillusionment</i>. Whether they will eventually soar up to the <i>Plateau of Productivity</i> is unknown, but for now it is clear even to practitioners that the hype bubble they have been riding for years has burst.<br />
<br />
Below the fold I try to catch up with the flood of reporting on the autonomous vehicle winter triggered by the bursting of the bubble.<br />
<span><a name='more'></a></span>
<h3>Cruise</h3>
The most obvious symptom is the implosion of General Motors' Cruise robotaxi division.
Brad Templeton worked on autonomy at Waymo and is an enthusiast for the technology. But in <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradtempleton/2023/12/28/robocar-2023-in-review-the-fall-of-cruise/"><i>Robocar 2023 In Review: The Fall Of Cruise</i></a> he acknowledges that things aren't going well:<br />
<blockquote>
Looking at 2023 in review for self-driving cars, one story stands out as the clear top story of the year, namely the fall of General Motors’ “Cruise” robotaxi division, which led to a pause of operations for Cruise over the whole USA, a ban on operations in California, the resignation of the founder/CEO and much more. That was actually the most prominent component of the other big story of the year, namely the battle between San Francisco and both Cruise and Waymo.<br />
<br />
Even this serious mistake should not have and perhaps would not have driven Cruise to its fate. The bigger mistake was they did not want to talk about it. They were eager to show the car’s recorded video of events to the press, and to officials, but only over Zoom. They did not mention the dragging, even when asked about it. I did not ask to see the part of the video after the crash, but others who did see it say it ended before the dragging. The DMV states they were not shown the dragging, and Cruise did not tell them about it, including in a letter they sent shortly after the events. Cruise insists they did show the full video to the DMV, and the DMV insists otherwise, but there is little doubt that they were not open about what was obviously the most important part of the chain of events when it came to understanding the role of the robotaxi in the calamity. Cruise was very eager to show that the initial crash was not their fault, but didn’t want to talk at all about their own serious mistake.
</blockquote>
Laura Dobberstein  reports on part of the aftermath in <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/12/14/gms_cruise_sacrifices_9_execs/"><i>GM's Cruise sheds nine execs in the name of safety and integrity</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
GM’s self-driving taxi outfit, Cruise, has dismissed nine execs – including its chief operating officer – after staff withheld information regarding an incident in which a woman was injured by one of the firm's robotaxis.<br />
<br />
"Today, following an initial analysis of the October 2 incident and Cruise's response to it, nine individuals departed Cruise. These include key leaders from Legal, Government Affairs, and Commercial Operations, as well as Safety and Systems," a Cruise spokesperson told <i>The Register</i>.<br />
<br />
"As a company, we are committed to full transparency and are focused on rebuilding trust and operating with the highest standards when it comes to safety, integrity, and accountability and believe that new leadership is necessary to achieve these goals," the spokesperson added.
</blockquote>
It isn't just the executives who are feeling the pain, as Hayden Field and Michael Wayland report in <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/14/gms-cruise-laying-off-900-or-24percent-of-its-workforce.html"><i>GM's Cruise laying off 900 employees, or 24% of its workforce: Read the memo here</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Cruise on Thursday announced internally that it will lay off 900 employees, or 24% of its workforce, the company confirmed to CNBC.<br />
<br />
The layoffs, which primarily affected commercial operations and related corporate functions, are the latest turmoil for the robotaxi startup and come one day after Cruise <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/13/gms-cruise-dismisses-nine-key-leaders-amid-safety-probe.html">dismissed nine “key leaders”</a> for the company’s response to an Oct. 2 accident in which a pedestrian was dragged 20 feet by a Cruise self-driving car after being struck by another vehicle.<br />
<br />
The company had 3,800 employees before Thursday’s cuts, which also follow a round of contractor layoffs at Cruise last month.
</blockquote>
Templeton's main argument is that Cruise mishandled the PR problem resulting from their vehicle dragging an injured pedestrian. They certainly did, in particular by apparently concealing information from the Dept. of Motor Vehicles. But the PR problem they faced is generic to autonomous vehicles. They are marketed as being safer than human drivers and, statistically, this may even be true. Waymo certainly makes a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/12/human-drivers-crash-a-lot-more-than-waymos-software-data-shows/">plausible claim</a>. But although "safer" implies it does not mean "safe", so serious crashes will inevitably occur.<br />
<br />
When they do the company's PR department is in a no-win situation. The reporters who call asking for the company's reaction know that the company has a vast amount of detailed information about what happened, logs and video. But the PR people don't, and even if they did they don't have the skills to interpret it. Given the nature of the AI driving the vehicle, it will take considerable time for the engineers to find the bug that was the root cause.<br />
<br />
The honest thing for the PR people to say is "we don't have the details, we'll get back to you when we do". Reporters are likely to hear this as buying time for a cover-up.<br />
<br />
The wrong thing for them to do is to give the reporters what little they know, and spin it in ways that minimize the company's fault. Later, when the full details emerge, they will have been shown to have been covering up the worst. Next time, even if they are honest, they won't be believed.<br />
<br />
The PR problem is even worse because it is fundamentally asymmetric. The marketing pitch is that, statistically, autonomous vehicles cause less accidents than humans. But the public will never know about accidents that would have happened were a human driving, but were averted by the AI driver. They will know about accidents that did happen because the AI driver did something that a human would not have, as with the Uber and Cruise incidents. When set against the expectation of airline-level safety, this is an insuperable problem.<br />
<br />
In <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/dec/06/driverless-cars-future-vehicles-public-transport"><i>Driverless cars were the future but now the truth is out: they’re on the road to nowhere</i></a>, Christian Wolmar who has a book about the autonomous winter entitled <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Driverless-Cars-Road-Nowhere-Perspectives/dp/1913019217/"><i>Driverless Cars: On a Road to Nowhere?</i></a> points out that Cruise isn't the first robotaxi company felled by an accident. That would be Uber:<br />
<blockquote>
Right from the start, the hype far outpaced the technological advances. In 2010, at the Shanghai Expo, General Motors had produced a video showing a driverless car taking a pregnant woman to hospital at breakneck speed and, as the commentary assured the viewers, safely. It was precisely the promise of greater safety, cutting the terrible worldwide annual roads death toll of 1.25m, that the sponsors of driverless vehicles dangled in front of the public.<br />
<br />
And that is now proving their undoing. First to go was Uber after an accident in which one of its self-driving cars killed Elaine Herzberg in Phoenix, Arizona. The car was in autonomous mode, and its “operator” was accused of watching a TV show, meaning they did not notice when the car hit Herzberg, who had confused its computers by stepping on to the highway pushing a bike carrying bags on its handlebars. Fatally, the computer could not interpret this confusing array of objects.<br />
<br />
Until then, Uber’s business model had been predicated on the idea that within a few years it would dispense with drivers and provide a fleet of robotaxis. That plan died with Herzberg, and Uber soon pulled out of all its driverless taxi trials.
</blockquote>
In her <a href="https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2023/12/self-driving-cars-hit-the-wall.html"><i>review of Wolmar's book</i></a> Yves Smith makes two good points:<br />
<blockquote>
Wolmar describes how this Brave New World has stalled out. The big reason is that the world is too complicated. or to put it in Taleb-like terms, there are way too many tail events to get them into training sets for AI in cars to learn about them. The other issue, which Wolmar does not make explicit, is that the public does not appear willing to accept the sort of slip-shod tech standards of buggy consumer software. The airline industry, which is very heavy regulated, has an impeccable safety record, and citizens appear to expect something closer to that…particularly citizens who don’t own or have investments in self-driving cars and never consented to their risks.
</blockquote>
It isn't just Cruise that is figuring out that <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2023/11/robotaxi-economics.html"><i>Robotaxi Economics</i></a> don't work.  Rita Liao's <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/29/china-robotaxi-apply-the-brakes/"><i>Facing roadblocks, China’s robotaxi darlings apply the brakes</i></a> reports that they don't work in China either:<br />
<blockquote>
Despite years of hype and progress in self-driving technologies, the widespread availability of robotaxis remains a distant reality. That’s due to a confluence of challenges, including safety, regulations and costs.<br />
<br />
The last factor, in particular, is what has pushed China’s robotaxi pioneers toward more opportunistic endeavors. To become profitable, robotaxis need to eventually remove human operators. Though China recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/13/china-autonomous-vehicle-driving-regulation/">clarified rules around the need for human supervision</a>, taxis without a driver behind the wheel are allowed only in restricted areas at present. To attract customers, robotaxi services offer deep discounts on their paid rides.<br />
<br />
Once the subsidies are gone and initial user curiosity wanes, who’s willing to pay the same amount as taxi fares for a few fixed routes?<br />
<br />
Struggling to address that question, China’s robotaxi startups have woken up to the money-burning reality of their business.
</blockquote>
So they are pivoting to a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/29/china-robotaxi-apply-the-brakes/">viable product</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
One logical path to monetize self-driving technology is to sell a less robust version of the technology, namely, advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) that still require human intervention.<br />
<br />
Deeproute, which is backed by Alibaba, significantly scaled back its robotaxi operations this year and plunged right into supplying ADAS to automakers. Its production-ready solution, which includes its smart driving software and lidar-powered hardware, is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/05/autonomous-driving-darling-deeproute-ai-sets-sight-on-europe-carmakers/">sold competitively at $2,000</a>. Similarly, Baidu is “downgrading the tech stacks” to find paying customers on its way up what it calls the “Mount Everest of self-driving.”<br />
<br />
“The experience and insight gleaned from deploying our solutions in [mass-produced] vehicles is being fed into our self-driving technology, giving us a unique moat around security and data,” a Baidu spokesperson said.
</blockquote>
Not a good year for the robotaxi concept, the thing that was supposed to distinguish Tesla's cars from everyone else's because they would earn their owners money while they slept.<br />
<h3>Tesla</h3>
As usual, when it comes to self-driving Tesla's story is worse than almost everyone else's. Elon Musk famously claimed that <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/news/elon-musk-says-tesla-is-worth-zero-without-fsd-why-he-is-completely-wrong-191416.html">Tesla is worth zero without Full Self Driving</a>. But although this is typical Musk BS, but unlike some other utterances it contains a kernel of truth. Tesla is valued as a <i>technology</i> company not a <i>car</i> company. Thus it is critical for Telsa that its technology be viewed as better than those of other car companies; anything that suggests it is limited or inadequate is a big problem not just for the company but also for Musk's personal wealth.<br />
<br />
I believe this is why Tesla hasn't implemented effective driver monitoring nor geo-fenced their systems. And why members of the Musk cult are so keen on defeating the driver monitoring system with weights on the steering wheel and smiley-face stickers on the camera. Depending upon what you believe, the technology is either groundbreaking autonomy or a below average Level-2 driver assistance system (Mercedes has fielded a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/09/mercedes-benzs-level-3-autonomous-driving-system-takes-over-in-heavy-traffic/">Level 3 system</a>). The congnitive dissonance between the pronouncements of the cult leader and the reality of continually being "nagged" about the limits of the technology is too hard for the cult members to take.<br />
<br />
The <i>Washington Post</i> team of Trisha Thadani, Rachel Lerman, Imogen Piper, Faiz Siddiqui and Irfan Uraizee has been delivering outstanding reporting on Tesla's technology. They started on Octoober 6<sup>th</sup> with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2023/tesla-autopilot-crash-analysis/"><i>The final 11 seconds of a fatal Tesla Autopilot crash</i></a>, in which a Tesla driver enabled Autopilot in conditions for which it was not designed, and set the speed to 14mph above the limit. Then on December 10<sup>th</sup> they followed with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/10/tesla-autopilot-crash/"><i>Tesla drivers run Autopilot where it’s not intended — with deadly consequences</i></a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/10/tesla-autopilot-cross-traffic/"><i>Why Tesla Autopilot shouldn’t be used in as many places as you think</i></a>.<br />
<br />
They recount a 2019 <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/10/tesla-autopilot-crash/">crash in Florida</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
A Tesla driving on Autopilot crashed through a T intersection at about 70 mph and flung the young couple into the air, killing Benavides Leon and gravely injuring Angulo. In police body-camera footage obtained by The Washington Post, the shaken driver says he was “driving on cruise” and took his eyes off the road when he dropped his phone.<br />
<br />
But the 2019 crash reveals a problem deeper than driver inattention. It occurred on a rural road where Tesla’s Autopilot technology was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/10/tesla-autopilot-cross-traffic/">not designed to be used</a>. Dash-cam footage captured by the Tesla and obtained exclusively by The Post shows the car blowing through a stop sign, a blinking light and five yellow signs warning that the road ends and drivers must turn left or right.
</blockquote>
Note that, just like the repeated <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/us-opens-formal-probe-tesla-autopilot_n_611a651de4b0f7bc26a7eef4">crashes into emergency vehicles</a>, the victims did not volunteer to debug Tesla's software. And also that the Autopilot system was driving 15mph above the speed limit on a road it wasn't designed for, just like the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2023/tesla-autopilot-crash-analysis/">2019 Banner crash</a> into a semi-trailer. As I wrote about <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2023/10/elon-musk-threat-or-menace-part-3.html">that crash</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
It is typical of Tesla's disdain for the law that, although their cars have GPS and can therefore know the speed limit, they didn't bother to program Autopilot to obey the law.<br />
...<br />
Again, Tesla's disdain for the safety of their customers, not to mention other road users, meant that despite the car knowing which road it was on and thus whether it was a road that Autopilot should not be activated on, it allowed Banner to enable it.
</blockquote>
Federal regulators have known there was a problem for more than seven years, but they <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/10/tesla-autopilot-crash/">haven't taken effective action</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Nor have federal regulators taken action. After the 2016 crash, which killed Tesla driver Joshua Brown, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) called for limits on where driver-assistance technology could be activated. But as a purely investigative agency, the NTSB has no regulatory power over Tesla. Its peer agency, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which is part of the Department of Transportation, has the authority to establish enforceable auto safety standards — but its failure to act has given rise to an unusual and increasingly tense rift between the two agencies.
</blockquote>
The reason may be that car manufacturers "self-certify" <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/10/tesla-autopilot-crash/">conformance with safety standards</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2023/tesla-autopilot-crash-analysis/">string of Autopilot crashes</a> reveals the consequences of allowing a rapidly evolving technology to operate on the nation’s roadways without significant government oversight, experts say. While NHTSA has several ongoing investigations into the company and specific crashes, critics argue the agency’s approach is too reactive and has allowed a flawed technology to put Tesla drivers — and those around them — at risk.<br />
<br />
The approach contrasts with federal regulation of planes and railroads, where crashes involving new technology or equipment — such as recurring issues with Boeing’s 737 Max — have resulted in sweeping action by agencies or Congress to ground planes or mandate new safety systems. Unlike planes, which are certified for airworthiness through a process called “type certification,” passenger car models are not prescreened, but are subject to a set of regulations called Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, which manufacturers face the burden to meet.
</blockquote>
And Tesla's self-certification is self-serving.<br />
<br />
Self-certification would work well if the penalty for false certification was severe, but the NTHSA has declined to impose <i>any</i> penalty for Tesla's manifestly inadequate system.  It seems that the team's reporting finally drove the NHTSA to do <i>something</i> about the long-standing problems of Autopilot. Reuters reported that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/dec/13/tesla-recall-us-autopilot"><i>Tesla recalls more than 2m vehicles in US over Autopilot system</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Tesla is recalling just over 2m vehicles in the United States fitted with its Autopilot advanced driver-assistance system to install new safeguards, after a safety regulator said the system was open to “foreseeable misuse”.<br />
<br />
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has been investigating the electric automaker led by the billionaire Elon Musk for more than two years over whether Tesla vehicles adequately ensure that drivers pay attention when using the driver assistance system.<br />
<br />
Tesla said in the recall filing that Autopilot’s software system controls “may not be sufficient to prevent driver misuse” and could increase the risk of a crash.<br />
...<br />
Separately, since 2016, NHTSA has opened more than three dozen Tesla special crash investigations in cases where driver systems such as Autopilot were suspected of being used, with 23 crash deaths reported to date.<br />
<br />
NHTSA said there might be an increased risk of a crash in situations when the system is engaged but the driver does not maintain responsibility for vehicle operation and is unprepared to intervene or fails to recognize when it is canceled or not.
</blockquote>
The obfuscation is extraordinary &mdash; "forseeable misuse", "may not be sufficient" and "could increase". There is no "foreseeable", "may" nor "could"; multiple people have already <i>died</i> because the system <i>was</i> abused. When Tesla is sued about these deaths, their <i>defense is that the system was abused</i>! I believe the system is specifically <i>designed</i> to allow abuse, because preventing abuse would puncture the hype bubble.<br />
<br />
Fortunately from the NTHSA's point of view the recall is pure kabuki, posing no risk from Musk's attack-dog lawyers and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/buttigieg-defends-safety-agency-appointment-after-musk-claims-bias/">cult</a> <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2021/10/tesla-missy-cummings-nhtsa-elon-musk.html">members</a> because the over-the-air update is cheap and doesn't actually fix the problem. The <i>Washington Post</i>'s headline writers didn't understand this whan they captioned the team's timeline <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/12/16/tesla-autopilot-recall-timeline/"><i>How Tesla Autopilot got grounded</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Now, more than 2 million Tesla vehicles are <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/16/tesla-autopilot-recall/">receiving a software update</a> to address “insufficient” controls to combat driver inattention while in Autopilot mode. Here’s how the recall unfolded, according to documents from Tesla, safety officials and reporting by The Washington Post.
</blockquote>
The team did understand that Autopilot hadn't been "grounded". In <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/16/tesla-autopilot-recall/"><i>Recalling almost every Tesla in America won’t fix safety issues, experts say</i></a> they lay it out:<br />
<blockquote>
Tesla this week agreed to issue a remote update to 2 million cars aimed at improving driver attention while Autopilot is engaged, especially on surface roads with cross traffic and other hazards the driver-assistance technology is not designed to detect.<br />
<br />
But the recall — the largest in Tesla’s 20-year history — quickly drew condemnation from experts and lawmakers, who said new warnings and alerts are unlikely to solve Autopilot’s fundamental flaw: that Tesla fails to limit where drivers can turn it on in the first place.<br />
...<br />
Tesla has repeatedly acknowledged in user manuals, legal documents and communications with federal regulators that Autosteer is “intended for use on controlled-access highways” with “a center divider, clear lane markings, and no cross traffic.”
</blockquote>
The <i>Washington Post</i>'s Geoffrey A. Fowler checked on the result of the kabuki, and wrote <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/31/tesla-autopilot-recall-test/"><i>Testing Tesla’s Autopilot recall, I don’t feel much safer — and neither should you</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Last weekend, my Tesla Model Y received an over-the-air update to make its driver-assistance software safer. In my first test drive of the updated Tesla, it blew through two stop signs without even slowing down.<br />
<br />
In December, Tesla issued its largest-ever recall, affecting almost all of its 2 million cars. It is like the software updates you get on your phone, except this was supposed to prevent drivers from misusing Tesla’s Autopilot software.<br />
<br />
After testing my Tesla update, I don’t feel much safer — and neither should you, knowing that this technology is on the same roads you use.<br />
<br />
During my drive, the updated Tesla steered itself on urban San Francisco streets Autopilot wasn’t designed for. (I was careful to let the tech do its thing only when my hands were hovering by the wheel and I was paying attention.) The recall was supposed to force drivers to pay more attention while using Autopilot by sensing hands on the steering wheel and checking for eyes on the road. Yet my car drove through the city with my hands off the wheel for stretches of a minute or more. I could even activate Autopilot after I placed a sticker over the car’s interior camera used to track my attention.
</blockquote>
Fowler concludes "I found we have every reason to be skeptical this recall does much of anything". Good job, Tesla!<br />
<br />
As a final note Rishi Sunak, the UK's tech-bro Prime Minister is naturally determined to make the UK a leader in autonomous vehicles with his new legislation on the subject. But, being a tech-bro, he has no idea of the fundamental problem they pose. Wolmar does understand it, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/dec/06/driverless-cars-future-vehicles-public-transport">writing</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
In the UK, Tesla will fall foul of the legislation introduced into parliament last month, which prevents companies from misleading the public about the capability of their vehicles. Tesla’s troubles have been compounded by the revelations from ex-employee Lukasz Krupski who claims the self-drive capabilities of Teslas <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-67591311">pose a risk to the public</a>. Manufacturers will be forced to specify precisely which functions of the car – steering, brakes, acceleration – have been automated. Tesla will have to change its marketing approach in order to comply. So, while the bill has been promoted as enabling the more rapid introduction of driverless cars, meeting its restrictive terms may prove to be an insuperable obstacle for their developers.
</blockquote>
Tesla's stock market valuation <i>depends</i> upon "misleading the public about the capability of their vehicles".<br />

## “More people are carrying more debt for longer”

date: 2024-01-09, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>Consumer credit jumped a whopping $23.7 billion in November, according to the Federal Reserve. That continues a trend of households struggling with high and rising prices, which is leading to a surge in debt and delinquencies. And it&#8217;s putting additional strain on families, especially lower-income ones.

A hairball is something a cat coughs up. Very undesirable. Of course, given enough time all software becomes a hairball. As you refine your understanding of how the product is being used, versus how you thought it would be used, all the new paths through the code and UI become more crooked and impenetrable by a human mind, because you still have to do all the things you did before, unless you start over. There often is value in starting over. Now is a good time to be thinking about bare-bones social web apps. People are open to new ideas.

A puzzle about ChatGPT. How can it get something right that both Wikipedia and journalism get wrong? Journalism often uses Wikipedia as a source, thus propagating its lies and mistakes. I think this negates the idea that they're just scanning the news orgs to get their information. The method obviously is more sophisticated.

Yesterday the administration announced 67 new recipients of nearly $1 billion in grant funding to transition to low- and zero-emission school buses. The Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Clean School Bus Program, which gets funding from Biden’s 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, has $5 billion to spend over five years on helping schools swap old buses for cleaner ones. So far it has allocated about $2 billion across 652 school districts, and this new round of funding will buy more than 2,700 clean buses.

The authors of the study, which was published in the journal <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>, say these particles can carry pollutants and pathogens and interfere with cells and tissues inside the human body.

Less than half of those losses were insured. The tally includes the devastating earthquake in Turkey and Syria, but the analysis also points to climate change as a main driver of severe storms that plagued North America and Europe, resulting in unprecedented losses. “The warming of the Earth that has been accelerating for some years is intensifying the extreme weather in many regions, leading to increasing loss potentials,” says Munich Re's chief climate scientist Ernst Rauch. He added: “Society and industry need to adapt to the changing risks – otherwise loss burdens will inevitably increase.” There's a map that shows the most expensive natural disasters.

## Boeing’s latest accident might not ground business

date: 2024-01-09, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>Investigators are still looking into why a piece of a Boeing aircraft blew off an Alaska Airlines flight over the weekend. It&#8217;s the latest issue with 737 Max planes, including an aircraft grounding following two crashes several years ago. Thing is, plane orders take years and there are few manufacturing competitors — meaning Boeing may not lose much businesses. And later: how Germany&#8217;s budget cuts helped spawn a major protest by farmers.</p>

## Video of 73-Year-Old Boarded Up Inside Apartment Sparks Investigation

date: 2024-01-09, from: VOA News USA

HARVEY, Ill.  — Rudolph Williams says he was home in a Chicago suburb when he realized the doors and windows to his courtyard-style apartment had been boarded up with plywood, locking him inside.


"I didn't know exactly what was going on," the 73-year-old said Monday in describing how he tried to open his blocked door. "What the hell?"


His story — chronicled by his nephew on now-viral videos — has generated a firestorm of criticism about rental conditions at the dilapidated low-income apartment complex in Harvey, Illinois. People are also debating who's to blame; and Mayor Christopher Clark has promised an investigation.


City officials, residents, property owners and the property management company have conflicting accounts about what happened Friday at the 30-unit complex roughly 48.28 kilometers 30 miles) south of Chicago.




It started that afternoon when crews without any logos on their clothing or vehicles started boarding up units. Residents say they weren't warned and that the workers ignored residents telling them people were still inside. City officials say police were on site earlier in the day and performed well-being checks, but not when units were set to be boarded up. The property owners say the tenants claims about residents being boarded inside are false, and the property managers say the units were empty before they started boarding up units at the city's direction.


No injuries were reported.


Genevieve Tyler, who said she was recently laid off from her meat factory job, was home when she heard noises outside and ran for a second door in her apartment looking to escape because she thought it was a break-in. That's when she said she came upon crews boarding up her windows.


"I feel sick," she said, adding that she was too scared to return home for two days. "I'm still sad."




The complex, which is in clear disrepair, has been on the city's radar for months.


One of the two buildings has no heat, with residents using stoves and space heaters to keep warm. A set of stairs has collapsed and is blocked to pedestrians. There is garbage everywhere: broken furniture, a large dumbbell and liquor bottles.


There have also been numerous safety issues involving drugs and crime. Police were called to the property more than 300 times last year, according to Harvey Police Chief Cameron Biddings.


City officials say the property owners, identified by the city as Jay Patel and Henry Cho, were warned about the unsafe conditions and urged to make changes. The owners were then notified that people had to evacuate by Oct. 28 and had to let residents know.


However, only some residents say they got the message. Others who were notified say they were skeptical of the documents' legitimacy. Some got letters on official city letterhead saying they had to leave due to the safety risk, while others received papers from the property managers that said the building would be shut down.


James Williams, Rudolph's nephew, who lives with him at the property, said a bunch of notices were strewn around the courtyard.


He and other people on site helped free his uncle from the apartment Friday evening, partly by using a drill, he said.




In a joint statement emailed late Monday, the property owners dismissed the residents' "viral allegations." The owners said they tried to negotiate more time with the city for renters to stay and aimed to have required repairs finished by March for the building to reopen.


The owners hired property management company, Chicago Style Management, in November.


Tim Harstead with Chicago Style Management disputed Williams' account, saying crews found one unauthorized person who left before they started boarding up units.


"A lot of people in that area are squatters and trying to stay there," he said.


On Monday, Mayor Clark and other city officials toured the complex, which lies off a busy street in the community of 20,000.


In a series of interviews, Clark reluctantly acknowledged that people were still inside their units when the apartments started being shuttered, but he said he wanted to hear directly from residents rather than via social media videos.


The city played no role in boarding up the apartments, he said, pledging that city police would investigate and might turn the matter over to the state's attorney or Illinois attorney general. Criticism of the city on social media was misdirected, he said.


"It's horrible," Clark said. "What's even more horrible is the fact that they would attribute that to people who are trying to actually help the situation versus the people who actually put them in this situation."


At least one city official, Alderman Tyrone Rogers, told media outlets over the weekend that residents' claims were a "total exaggeration." He did not return messages Monday from The Associated Press.


Some residents, including 34-year-old Loren Johnson, left last month. He said the shutdown notice scared him off as did the broken heating and criminal activity.


"They don't do anything, but they take full rent," he said of the landlords.


Roughly half a dozen residents remained on Monday, saying they look out for each other.


Mary Brooks, 66, lives in one of the few apartments that wasn't boarded up.


She described herself as a cancer survivor with mental health issues who has nowhere else to go. She also said she has tried to reach city officials multiple times about the complex over her nearly four years of living there, a complaint she shared with the mayor when he visited her at home Monday.


"Nobody pays attention to the poor," she said. "Nobody cares until something happens."

## US Man Held in Moscow on Drug Charges

date: 2024-01-09, from: VOA News USA

MOSCOW — Russia has detained and brought drug-related charges against U.S. citizen Robert Woodland, who was apprehended by law enforcement earlier this month, a Moscow court said Tuesday.


Moscow is holding several American nationals on espionage and other charges, as tensions between Russia and the United States balloon over the conflict in Ukraine.


"On January 6, the Ostankinsky District Court of Moscow ordered Robert Romanov Woodland to be placed in detention for a period of two months, until March 5, 2024," the court said on social media.


He is accused of the "illegal acquisition, storage, transportation, manufacture, processing" of drugs and faces up to 20 years in prison.


Russian authorities have arrested several U.S. citizens in recent years, with critics accusing Moscow of using detainees as bargaining chips to exchange Russians jailed in the United States.


Paul Whelan, an ex-US marine was sentenced in 2020 to 16 years in jail on spying charges that he denies.


In late March 2023, Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich became the first Western journalist to be held on espionage charges in Russia since the Soviet era.


US-Russian dual citizen, journalist Alsu Kurmasheva, was arrested in October. She has been charged with failing to register as a "foreign agent" and spreading misinformation.


In December 2022, Russia released basketball superstar Brittney Griner in exchange for notorious Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout — known as the "Merchant of Death" — who had been jailed in the United States.

## Central US Walloped by Blizzard Conditions

date: 2024-01-09, from: VOA News USA

MADISON, Wisconsin — A sprawling storm that pelted much of the nation's midsection with more than a half a foot of snow and gusty winds created whiteout conditions that closed parts of two interstate highways and prompted officials to close schools and government offices in several states Tuesday.


Up to 20 to 30 centimeters (12 inches) of snow could blanket a broad area stretching from southeastern Colorado all the way to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, including western Kansas, eastern Nebraska, large parts of Iowa, northern Missouri and northwestern Illinois, said Bob Oravec, a forecaster with the National Weather Service in College Park, Maryland.


Nearly 8 inches (19 centimeters) of snow fell in the northern city of Athol, Kansas, on Monday. The weather service office in Lincoln, Nebraska, predicted an additional 3-5 inches (8-13 centimeters) was possible overnight, with winds possibly gusting as high as 40 mph (64 kph).


Whiteout conditions in central Nebraska closed a long stretch of Interstate 80, while Kansas closed Interstate 70 from the central city of Russell all the way west to the Colorado border due to dangerous travel conditions. Several vehicles slid off I-70 in the northeastern part of the state, authorities said.


In Nebraska, federal courts in Omaha and Lincoln closed Monday, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers increased the water flow at a Missouri River dam on the Nebraska-South Dakota border near Yankton to reduce the chance of ice jams forming. Dubuque, on Iowa's eastern border with Illinois, closed its city offices Tuesday. Schools in Cedar Rapids in eastern Iowa were among those also closing.


The weather has already affected campaigning for Iowa's Jan. 15 precinct caucuses, where the snow is expected to be followed by frigid temperatures that could drift below minus 18 Celsius (0 Fahrenheit).


It forced former President Donald Trump's campaign to cancel multiple appearances by Arkansas Gov. Sarah Sanders and her father, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, who had been scheduled to court Iowa voters on Trump's behalf Monday.


Parts of northern Missouri braced for up to a foot of snow as the system moved east. Officials in Kansas City, Missouri, said City Hall would be closed Tuesday and municipal courts would operate remotely.


Madison, Wisconsin, was under a winter storm warning until early Wednesday, with as much as 23 centimeters (9 inches) of snow and 64 kph (40 mph) winds on tap. City officials canceled garbage collection to prevent residents from putting trash cans along curbs and making it difficult for snowplows to navigate.


Northwestern Illinois was also under a winter storm warning with forecasts calling for  18 to 30 centimeters (7 to 12 inches) of snow by early Wednesday. The Chicago area as well as Gary, Indiana, were under winter storm advisories, with forecasts calling for up to 15 centimeters 6 inches) of snow and wind gusts of up to 48 kph 30 mph).


The Illinois Tollway, a state agency that maintains toll roads across 12 northern Illinois counties, urged drives to take a "go it slow" attitude.


Disruptions extended as far south as the Oklahoma panhandle, where Cimmaron County emergency managers asked citizens to stay home. More than a dozen motorists were stranded there Monday afternoon, with whipping winds and blizzard conditions leading to near-zero visibility, said Lea Lavielle, the county's emergency management director.


"At this point in time, we are advising individuals to shelter in place the best they can," Lavielle said.


Another storm was on the way that will affect the Pacific Northwest into the northern Rockies, Oravec said. Blizzard warnings were out for much of the Cascade and Olympic ranges in Washington and Oregon.

## January 8, 2024 

date: 2024-01-09, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog

With President Joe Biden&#8217;s speech today at Mother Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church in Charleston, South Carolina, coming after his speech in Pennsylvania on January 5, the election year of 2024 is in full swing. The first Republican caucus will be held on January 15 in Iowa; the first Democratic primary will be held on February 3. (A caucus is held by a political party and can have public voting, by a show of hands or gathering behind a candidate&#8217;s team; a primary election is run by the government and uses secret ballots.)

## Blinken in Israel Amid Push to Contain Gaza War

date: 2024-01-09, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he would discuss “the way forward” as he met Tuesday with Israeli leaders in Tel Aviv, amid a push to prevent the war in Gaza from spreading in the region and for Israeli officials to do more to protect civilians and facilitate humanitarian aid deliveries to Gaza.

 

Speaking alongside Israeli President Isaac Herzog, Blinken said he would have the opportunity to meet with the families of the some of the hostages held by Hamas militants in Gaza, and to relay to Israeli leaders some of what he heard from other leaders in the region during stops in Turkey, Greece, Jordan, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.


Herzog thanked the United States for “standing steadfast with Israel” and said the war against Hamas is one that “affects international values and the values of the free world.”


Herzog also rejected a lawsuit filed at the International Court of Justice accusing Israel of genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, calling the accusation “atrocious and preposterous.”


Hearings in the case are due to begin Thursday, and Herzog said Israel will “present proudly our case of using self-defense under our most inherent right under international humanitarian law.”


U.S. officials have called on Israel to do more to protect civilians in Gaza, and that message was one Blinken planned to repeat in his meetings Tuesday.


Gaza health officials say close to 23,000 Palestinians, a large percentage of them women and children, have been killed in Israel's military offensive in the Gaza Strip.


Israel has criticized Hamas for locating its operations in civilian areas, including the use of tunnels under cities.  Herzog said Tuesday that Israel is “doing our utmost under extremely complicated circumstances” to ensure there are no civilian casualties.


Blinken said Monday that leaders in the Middle East are determined to prevent the Gaza conflict from spreading and that there is broad recognition on the need to “chart a political path forward for the Palestinians.”


“The West Bank and Gaza should be united under Palestinian-led governance,” Blinken told reporters in Saudi Arabia.


“The future of the region needs to be one of integration, not division and not conflict,” Blinken said, adding “for that to happen, we need to see the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.”


In a statement following talks with Blinken, Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman underscored the importance of halting military operations in the Gaza Strip and the need to create conditions for restoring peace and stability.


When asked about the U.S.-led talks to normalize the relationship between Saudi Arabia and Israel, Blinken said there is “a clear interest” in Saudi Arabia, as well as in the region, in pursuing that goal but “it will require that the conflict end in Gaza, and it will also clearly require that there be a practical pathway to a Palestinian state.”


Saudi Arabia has paused diplomatic talks to normalize ties with Israel amid the military conflict between Hamas militants and Israeli forces.


After an Israeli airstrike killed a key Hezbollah commander in southern Lebanon on Monday — the latest sign of a possibly widening conflict in the Middle East — Blinken told reporters it is clearly not in the interest of Israel, Lebanon, or Hezbollah to see an escalation outside Gaza and “the Israelis have been very clear with” the U.S. that “they want to find a diplomatic way forward.”


Hezbollah has identified the commander as Wissam al-Tawil. Last week, senior Hamas official Saleh al-Arouri was killed in a drone strike in Beirut. Both Hamas and Hezbollah are backed by Iran, whose militant allies in Syria, Iraq and Yemen have also been carrying out longer-range attacks against Israel.

 

The United States has urged Israel to shift to smaller scale military operations in Gaza but has continued to support Israel in refusing Arab demands for a cease-fire to halt the fighting in the three-month war. Israel has vowed to continue the war until it believes the threat of future Hamas attacks has been eradicated and the militant group no longer controls Gaza, a narrow strip of territory along the Mediterranean Sea.


Israel began its military campaign to wipe out Hamas after Hamas fighters crossed into southern Israel on Oct. 7. Israel said about 1,200 people were killed and about 240 captives taken in the terror attack.


Some material for this report was provided by Reuters and The Associated Press.

## A Narrowly Avoided Disaster as Jet's Wall Rips Away at 3 Miles High

date: 2024-01-09, from: VOA News USA

PORTLAND, Ore.  — The loud "boom" was startling enough, and the roaring wind that immediately filled the airline cabin left Kelly Bartlett unnerved. Still, it wasn't until a shaken teenager, shirtless and scratched, slid into the seat next to her that she realized just how close disaster had come.


A section of the Boeing 737 Max 9's fuselage just three rows away had blown out — at 4.8 kilometers (3 miles ) high — creating a vacuum that twisted the metal of the seats nearby, and snatched cellphones, headsets and even the shirt off the teenager's back.


"We knew something was wrong," Bartlett told The Associated Press on Monday. "We didn't know what. We didn't know how serious. We didn't know if it meant we were going to crash."


The first six minutes of Alaska Airlines flight 1282 from Portland to Southern California's Ontario International Airport on Friday had been routine, the Boeing 737 Max 9 about halfway to its cruising altitude and traveling at more than 640 kph (400 mph).


Flight attendants had just told the 171 passengers that they could resume using electronic devices — in airplane mode, of course — when it happened.


Then suddenly a 61-centimeter-by-122-centimeter (2-foot-by-4-foot) piece of fuselage covering an unoperational emergency exit behind the left wing blew out. Only seven seats on the flight were unoccupied, and as fate would have it, these included the two seats closest to the blown-out hole.


The oxygen masks dropped immediately, and Bartlett saw a flight attendant walking down the aisle toward the affected row, leaning forward as if facing a stiff wind. Then flight attendants began moving passengers from the area where the blowout occurred and helped them move away.


Among them was the teenage boy moved next to Bartlett.




"His shirt got sucked off of his body when the panel blew out because of the pressure, and it was his seatbelt that kept him in his seat and saved his life. And there he was next to me," she said, adding that his mother was reseated elsewhere.


"We had our masks on, and the plane was really loud so we couldn't talk. But I had a ... notes app on my phone that I was typing on. So I typed to him and I asked him if he was hurt," Bartlett said. "I just couldn't believe he was sitting there and what he must have gone through, what he must have been feeling at the time."


She said the boy typed back that he was OK, but a bit scratched, adding "that was unbelievable" and "thank you for your kindness."


The exit door plug landed in the southwest Portland backyard of high school physics teacher Bob Sauer. Sauer said his heart "did start beating a little faster" when he saw it in the beam of his flashlight Sunday night as he searched for any debris.




"It was very obviously part of a plane," he told a group of reporters outside his home on Monday. "I thought, 'Oh my goodness, people have been looking for this all weekend and it looks like it's in my backyard.'"


Sauer said he and the seven National Transportation Safety Board agents who came to his home to pick up the door plug were amazed it was intact. It appeared that tree branches had broken its fall.


A headrest landed on the patio of Sauer's neighbor, Diane Flaherty. Flaherty didn't realize what the charcoal-colored cushion was until a friend emailed her to say federal agents were looking for airplane parts in her neighborhood. An NTSB agent came by to pick it up.




"What are the chances that a headrest cushion falls out of the sky into your backyard?" she said.


The pilots and flight attendants have not made public statements and their names have not been released, but in interviews with National Transportation Safety Board investigators they described how their training kicked in. The pilots focused on getting the plane quickly back to Portland and the flight attendants on keeping the passengers safe and as calm as possible.


"The actions of the flight crew were really incredible," NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said at a Sunday night news conference. She described the scene inside the cabin during those first seconds as "chaos, very loud between the air and everything going on around them and it was very violent."


Bartlett echoed praise for the crew, saying the entire time she felt like the plane was under control even though the roaring wind was so loud she couldn't hear the captain's announcements.


"The flight attendants really responded well to the situation. They got everyone safe and then they got themselves safe," she said. "And then there was nothing to do but wait, right? We were just on our way down and it was just a normal descent. It felt normal."




Inside the cockpit, the pilot and co-pilot donned their oxygen masks and opened their microphone, but "communication was a serious issue" between them and the flight attendants because of the noise, Homendy said. The pilots retrieved an emergency handbook kept secure next to the captain's seat.


The co-pilot contacted air traffic controllers, declaring an emergency and saying the plane needed to immediately descend to 3,048 meters, (10,000 feet) the altitude where there is enough oxygen for everyone onboard to breathe.


"We need to turn back to Portland," she said in a calm voice that she maintained throughout the landing.


In the cabin, the flight attendants' immediate focus was on the five unaccompanied minors in their care and the three infants being carried on their parents' laps.


"Were they safe? Were they secure? Did they have their seat belts on or their lap belts on? And did they have their masks on? And they did," Homendy said.


Some passengers began sending messages on social media to loved ones. One young woman said on TikTok that she was certain the plane would nosedive at any second and she wondered how her death would affect her mother, worrying that she would never recover from the sorrow.




But she and others said the cabin remained surprisingly calm. One passenger, Evan Granger, who was sitting in front of the blowout, told NBC News that his "focus in that moment was just breathe into the oxygen mask and trust that the flight crew will do everything they can to keep us safe."


"There were so many things that had to go right in order for all of us to survive," Granger said.


Video taken by those on board showed flight attendants moving down the aisle checking on passengers. Through the hole, city lights could be seen flickering past.


Evan Smith, an attorney traveling on the plane, told reporters the descent and landing were loud but smooth. When the plane touched down at Portland International about 20 minutes after it departed, the passengers broke into applause. Firefighters came down the aisle to check for injuries, but no one was seriously hurt.


Homendy said that if the blowout had happened a few minutes later, after the plane reached cruising altitude, the accident might have become a tragedy.




Bartlett's mind also keeps returning to the what-ifs.


"I'm glad that it is not any worse than it was — that's all. I keep coming back to it," she said. "Like, how lucky Jack got. That was his name, the kid who sat next to me. His name was Jack, and how lucky he was that he had a seatbelt on."


On Sunday, a passenger's cellphone that had been sucked out of the plane was found. It was still operational, having survived its plunge from the sky.


It was open to the owner's baggage claim receipt.

## Biden Describes White Supremacy as 'Poison' in Pitch to Black Voters

date: 2024-01-09, from: VOA News USA

Washington — President Joe Biden made a heartfelt appeal to Black voters on Monday, speaking passionately at a storied South Carolina church scarred by racially motivated tragedy and seeking support as members of the state’s large Black community head to the nation’s first Democratic primary next month.


Before a packed congregation at Charleston’s Mother Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, Biden spoke of “a poison that’s for too long haunted this nation,” echoing words from former President Donald Trump, who has made waves on the campaign trail by accusing immigrants of “poisoning the blood” of the nation. 


“What is that poison?” Biden continued. “White supremacy. ... Throughout our history, it’s ripped this nation apart. This has no place in America. Not today, tomorrow or ever.” 


With those words, Biden became the first sitting American president to speak from the pulpit of one of the nation’s oldest and most respected Black spiritual institutions. The stately church, founded more than two centuries ago, was the scene of a gruesome mass shooting in 2015 in which nine people, including the church’s pastor, were killed by a white supremacist.


President Barack Obama delivered the eulogy at the Reverend Clementa Pinckney’s funeral in 2015, which was held in TD Arena at the College of Charleston. 


The tragedy prompted South Carolina’s governor at the time, Nikki Haley — who is now running for the Republican presidential nomination — to remove the Confederate flag that flew over the state Capitol.


Biden also capitalized on the venue by indirectly mentioning Haley’s reluctance in a recent public forum to acknowledge that disagreements over slavery caused the Civil War.


“Let me be clear for those who don't seem to know: Slavery was the cause of the Civil War,” he said, to applause. “There is no negotiation about that.”


Racism an election issue


Groups that work to mobilize overlooked voters say racism is a top issue that emerges time and again in polls and focus groups.


Cynthia Wallace founded the New Rural Project after her unsuccessful congressional run in 2020 showed that 60,000 registered voters of color in her North Carolina district didn’t turn up at the polls.


“When we look at the top issues that concern folks, and we look at it by demographics, African American infrequent voters — these are part of those 60,000 folks who didn't show up, who we are actually specifically targeted to speak to — one of their top issues, whether it's from the polling or the focus groups, is racism,” she told VOA. 


But, she added, “We continue to hear most of the rural folks that we speak to focus on the kitchen-table issues.” 


South Carolina Representative Jim Clyburn hit some of those points in introducing Biden, listing what he saw as Biden’s achievements and contrasting him with Trump.


Clyburn outlined Biden’s attempts at student loan forgiveness, his appointment of an unprecedented number of Black female judges, his support of abortion rights, his work to reduce health care costs and his efforts to help veterans. 


“We know Joe,” he said. “But most importantly, Joe knows us well.”


“I rest my case,” Biden quipped after Clyburn’s speech, as attendees chanted “Four more years!” in support of Biden’s reelection.


But Clyburn’s rousing words contrasted with his weekend comments on CNN, where he said he was “very concerned” about the Biden campaign’s ability to “break through that MAGA wall” — a reference to Trump’s Make America Great Again motto — and communicate his message to voters. 


Polls show that Biden faces challenges with Black voters, who propelled him to victory over Trump in 2020. A poll conducted late last year by the GenForward Survey project found that 17% of Black voters said they would vote for Trump, and 20% would vote for “someone else.” Sixty-three percent said they would vote for Biden.


'Cease-fire now' or 'four more years'?


Some of the disagreements appeared in real-time on Monday, when a heckler, referring to the ongoing conflict in Gaza, led a chant of “cease-fire now” — which was then drowned out by louder chants of “four more years.”


Biden acknowledged the hecklers, saying, “I understand their passion.”


He added, “I’ve been quietly working with the Israeli government to get them to reduce and significantly get out of Gaza. I’ve been using all that I can to do that.”


Democratic strategist Douglas Wilson, speaking to VOA from North Carolina, said the Black community is divided on perceptions of the war in Gaza, with younger voters viewing “Palestinians as being people of color and look at the end of the Israelis as occupiers or as colonizers.”


“That's a course that's up for debate,” he added. “I don't agree with that personally. But there is a segment of the community that feels that way.”


Misinformation and the economy 


Wallace, of the New Rural Project, noted the role of misinformation in skewing attitudes. She said that only one Black voter she spoke to raised the issue of Gaza and falsely claimed that Biden supports Hamas, the militant group that launched the stunning attack on Israel on Oct. 7. 


Biden has repeatedly called Hamas “terrorists,” described their acts as “evil” and has given material and moral support to Israel. Hamas is a U.S.-designated terrorist group.


“I think in this information-heavy world, I think it's hard for information to cut through,” Wallace said. “You’ve got to make sure that people actually know what things you've done and what things you plan to do more of and what things you're fighting for.”


Wilson added that more details on Black economic empowerment could also shift voter support. 


“I would have liked to hear him give a brief outline of what his economic agenda will be in a second term for Black America,” he said. “And I think that if he can begin to articulate that, then it will give Black voters a reason to come out and vote for him in high numbers.”


South Carolina voters participate in the Democratic presidential primary on Feb. 3, in which Representative Dean Phillips and author and self-professed spiritual adviser Marianne Williamson are also on the ballot.

<p>Lenovo is showing off a concept wireless keyboard &#38; mouse set at CES 2024 that never needs to be plugged in to charge. That&#8217;s because the Mechanical Energy Harvesting Combo system &#8220;uses mechanical movement and solar irradiation&#8221; to generate enough power to keep the peripherals running. We&#8217;ve seen mobile gadgets with solar panels before, but it [&#8230;]</p>

## Blinken: Middle East Leaders Determined to Prevent Wider War

date: 2024-01-09, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Monday leaders in the Middle East are determined to prevent the Gaza conflict from spreading and that there is broad recognition on the need to "chart a political path forward for the Palestinians." 


"The West Bank and Gaza should be united under Palestinian-led governance," Blinken told reporters at Al Ula airport in Saudi Arabia. 


"The future of the region needs to be one of integration, not division and not conflict," said Blinken, adding "for that to happen, we need to see the establishment of an independent Palestinian state." 


In a statement following talks with Blinken, Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman underscored the importance of halting military operations in the Gaza Strip and the need to create conditions for restoring peace and stability. Local media have reported that this effort aims to ensure the Palestinian people obtain their legitimate rights and achieve a just and lasting peace. 




On Monday, Blinken met with the United Arab Emirates President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan and senior officials from Saudi Arabia before heading to Israel. 


The chief U.S. diplomat said he would push Israeli officials for more humanitarian aid to Gaza and more protection for civilians. He also plans to discuss efforts to secure the release of the remaining hostages and how to ensure the conflict does not spread to other parts of the region.   




When asked about the U.S.-led talks to normalize the relationship between Saudi Arabia and Israel, Blinken stated that there is "a clear interest" in Saudi Arabia, as well as in the region, in pursuing that goal but "it will require that the conflict end in Gaza, and it will also clearly require that there be a practical pathway to a Palestinian state." 


Saudi Arabia has paused diplomatic talks to normalize ties with Israel amid the military conflict between Hamas militants and Israeli forces. 


After an Israeli airstrike killed a key Hezbollah commander in southern Lebanon on Monday — the latest sign of a possibly widening conflict in the Middle East — Blinken told reporters it's clearly not in the interest of Israel, Lebanon, or Hezbollah to see an escalation outside Gaza and "the Israelis have been very clear with" the U.S. that "they want to find a diplomatic way forward." 


Hezbollah has identified the commander as Wissam al-Tawil. Last week, senior Hamas official Saleh al-Arouri was killed in a drone strike in Beirut. Both Hamas and Hezbollah are backed by Iran, whose militant allies in Syria, Iraq and Yemen have also been carrying out longer-range attacks against Israel. 


 


 




In meetings Sunday with Jordan King Abdullah II and Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, the top U.S. diplomat spoke of the need for Israel to curb civilian casualties during the Israeli-Hamas war in Gaza and significantly increase the amount of humanitarian aid reaching famished Palestinians in Gaza. 


But the U.S. has continued to support Israel in refusing Arab demands for a cease-fire to halt the fighting in the three-month war. Israel has vowed to continue the war until it believes the threat of future Hamas attacks has been eradicated and the militant group no longer controls Gaza, a narrow strip of territory along the Mediterranean Sea. 


Jordan's royal court said King Abdullah "warned of the catastrophic repercussions" of Israel's war in Gaza against Hamas while calling on the U.S. to press for an immediate cease-fire. Israeli and U.S. officials have said they believe that a cease-fire would only allow Hamas to be able to regroup in its fight against Israeli forces. 


While in Amman, Blinken also visited a World Food Program warehouse where trucks are loaded with aid for famished Palestinians in Gaza. 




"The efforts right here to collect and distribute food to people in need are absolutely essential," Blinken said. "The United States has worked from day one to open access routes into Gaza." 


"We continue to work on that every single day, not only to open them but to multiply them, to maximize them and to try to get more assistance, more effectively," he said. "We're determined to do everything we possibly can to ameliorate the situation for the men, women and children in Gaza."


Israel began its military campaign to wipe out Hamas after Hamas fighters crossed into southern Israel on October 7. Israel said about 1,200 people were killed and about 240 captives taken in the terror attack.


Gaza health officials say close to 23,000 Palestinians, a large percentage of them women and children, have been killed in Israel's military offensive in the Gaza Strip.


The United States has stated its opposition to forcibly removing Palestinians from Gaza. The U.S. is also working on a postwar road map for the Palestinian territories.


"Gaza cannot, once again, serve as a launching pad for terrorist attacks against Israel," State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told VOA last week.


"What we ultimately want to see is Gaza and the West Bank reunited under Palestinian leadership," and "certainly there's no role for Hamas in that."

## MSNBC’s Mehdi Hasan Quits Rather Than Accept Demotion at News Network

date: 2024-01-09, from: VOA News USA

New york — Prominent Muslim journalist Mehdi Hasan has decided to quit MSNBC rather than accept a demotion that saw him lose a regular Sunday night program on the network.


Hasan announced at the end of Sunday show that "I've decided to look for a new challenge. This is not just my final episode of 'The Mehdi Hasan Show,' it's my last day at MSNBC."


The network had announced in November that Hasan would lose his weekly show after three years but would remain as an analyst and fill-in anchor.


That decision, with no public explanation, launched a fruitless petition campaign in protest by the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. U.S. Representative Ilhan Omar called it "deeply troubling that MSNBC is canceling his show amid a rampant rise of anti-Muslim bigotry and suppression of Muslim voices."


An MSNBC spokeswoman said Monday the network had no comment on Hasan's exit.


His final show featured an interview with Motaz Azaiza, a Palestinian photographer who talked about the danger of working in Gaza during Israeli military operations.


Hasan on Monday also forwarded a report on X, formerly Twitter, about Palestinian children losing limbs, adding the message, "Read this sentence. Then reread it. Then ask yourself how anyone is OK with this level of human suffering."


Hasan told viewers that he's proud of what had been achieved on his show.


"As I say: new year, new plans," he said.

Hasan, who previously worked at Al Jazeera English and the Intercept, offered no details and declined further comment on Monday.


To replace Hasan, MSNBC is increasing the weekend hours of Ayman Mohyeldin, another Muslim journalist.

## Pluralistic: Molly McGhee's "Jonathan Abernathy You Are Kind" (08 Jan 2024)

date: 2024-01-09, from: Cory Doctorow's blog

Today's links Molly McGhee's "Jonathan Abernathy You Are Kind": A haunting novel of debt, work, dreams, and the capitalist nightmare. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2004, 2009, 2014, 2019, 2023 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading Molly McGhee's "Jonathan Abernathy You Are Kind" (permalink) Jonathan Abernathy You Are Kind is Molly McGhee's debut novel: a dreamlike tale of a public-private partnership that hires the terminally endebted to invade the dreams of white-collar professionals and harvest the anxieties that prevent them from being fully productive members of the American corporate workforce: https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/734829/jonathan-abernathy-you-are-kind-by-molly-mcghee/ Though this is McGhee's first novel, she's already well known in literary circles. Her career has included stints at McSweeney's, where she worked on my book Information Doesn't Want To Be Free: https://store.mcsweeneys.net/products/information-doesn-t-want-to-be-free And then at Tor Books, where she worked on my book Attack Surface: https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250757531/attacksurface But though McGhee is a shrewd and skilled editor, I think of her first and foremost as a writer, thanks to stunning essays like "America's Dead Souls," a 2021 Paris Review piece that described the experience of multigenerational debt in America in incandescent, pitiless prose: https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2021/05/17/americas-dead-souls/ McGhee's piece struck at the heart of something profoundly wrong in American society &#8211; the dual nature of debt, which represents a source of freedom for the wealthy, and bondage for workers: https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/19/zombie-debt/#damnation When billionaire mass-murderers like the Sacklers amass tens of billions of liabilities stemming from their role in deliberately starting the opioid crisis, the courts step in to relieve them of their obligations, allowing them to keep their blood-money: https://pluralistic.net/2023/08/11/justice-delayed/#justice-redeemed And when Silicon Valley Bank collapses due to mismanagement by ultra-wealthy financiers, the public purse yawns open and billions flow out to ensure that the wealthiest investors in the country stay whole: https://pluralistic.net/2023/03/18/2-billion-here-2-billion-there/#socialism-for-the-rich When predatory payday lenders target working people and force them into bankruptcy with four-digit APRs, the government intervenes&#8230;to save the lenders and keep workers on the hook: https://pluralistic.net/2022/01/29/planned-obsolescence/#academic-fraud "Debtor vs creditor" is the oldest class division we have. The Bronze Age custom of jubilee &#8211; the periodic cancellation of all debts &#8211; wasn't some weird peccadillo. It was essential public policy, and without jubilee, the hereditary creditor class became the arbiter of all social priorities, destabilizing great nations and even empires by directing production to suit their parochial needs. Societies that didn't practice jubilee (or halted it) collapsed: https://pluralistic.net/2022/07/08/jubilant/#construire-des-passerelles Today's workers are debt burdened at scales and in ways that defy comprehension, the numbers are so brain-breakingly large. Students who take out modest loans and pay them off several times over remain indebted decades later, with outstanding balances that vastly outstrip the principle: https://pluralistic.net/2020/12/04/kawaski-trawick/#strike-debt Workers who quit dead-end jobs are billed for five-figure "training repayment" bills that haunt them to the end of days: https://pluralistic.net/2022/08/04/its-a-trap/#a-little-on-the-nose Hospitals sue indigent patients at scale, siccing debt-collectors on people who can't pay &#8211; and were entitled to free care to begin with: https://armandalegshow.com/episode/when-hospitals-sue-patients-part-2/ And debt collectors are drawn from the same social ranks as the debtors, barely trained and unsupervised, engaging in lawless, constant harassment of the debtor class: https://pluralistic.net/2023/08/12/do-not-pay/#fair-debt-collection-practices-act McGhee's "American Dead Souls" crystallized all of this vast injustice into a single, beautiful essay &#8211; and then McGhee crystallized things further by posting a public resignation letter enumerating the poor pay and working conditions in New York publishing, triggering mass, industry-wide resignations by similarly situated junior editorial staff: https://electricliterature.com/molly-mcghee-jonathan-abernathy-you-are-kind-interview-debut-novel-book-debt/ Thus we arrive at McGhee's debut: a novel written by someone with a track record for gorgeous, brutally insightful prose; incisive analysis of the class war raging in the embers of capitalism's American Dream; and consequential labor organizing against the precarity and exploitation of young workers. As you might expect, it's fantastic. Jonathan Abernathy is a 25 year old, debt haunted, desperately lonely man. An orphan with a mountain of college debt, Abernathy lives in a terrible basement apartment whose rent is just beyond his means. The only thing that propels him out of bed and into the world are his affirmations: Jonathan Abernathy you are kind You are well respected and valued by your community People, including your family, love you That these are all easily discerned lies is beside the point. Whatever gets you through the night. We meet Jonathan as he is applying for a job that he was recruited for in a dream. As instructed in his dream, he presents himself at a shabby strip-mall office where an acerbic functionary behind scratched plexiglass takes his application and informs him that he is up for a gig run jointly by the US State Department and a consortium of large corporate employers. If he is accepted, all of his student debt repayments will be paused and he will no longer face wage garnishment. What's more, he'll be doing the job in his sleep, which means he'll be able to get a day job and pull a double income &#8211; what's not to like? Jonathan's job is to enter the dreams of sleeping middle-management types in America's largest firms &#8211; but not just any dreams, their nightmares. Once he has entered their nightmare, Jonathan is charged with identifying the source of their anxiety and summoning a more senior operative who will suck up and whisk away that nagging spectre, thus rendering the worker a more productive component of their corporate structure. But of course, there's more to it. As Jonathan works through his sleeping hours, he is deprived of his own dreams. Then there's the question of where those captive anxieties are ending up, and how they're being processed, and what new products can be made from refined nightmares. While Jonathan himself is pulling ever so slightly out of his economic quagmire, the people around him are still struggling. McGhee braids together three strands: the palpable misery of being Jonathan (a proxy for all of us), the rising terror of the true nature of his employment, and beautifully turned absurdist touches that are laugh-aloud funny. This could be a mere novel of ennui and misery but it's not &#8211; it's a novel of hilarity and fear and misery, all mixed together in a glorious and terrible concoction that is not like anything else you've ever read.

Well-Typed, Tweag I/O, Serokell, Equinix, SimSpace, Haskell Foundation, and

## InfluxDB FDW 2.1.0 release

date: 2024-01-09, from: PostgreSQL News

<p>InfluxDB FDW 2.1.0 released</p>
<p>We have just released version 2.1.0 of the Foreign Data Wrapper for InfluxDB. This release can work with PostgreSQL 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16.</p>
<p>This release improves following item (from 2.0.0): </p>
<ul>
<li>Support PostgreSQL 16.0 </li>
<li>Bug fix: Cannot delete when time series column defined as timestamptz type</li>
</ul>
<p>The FDW supports following features :</p>
<ul>
<li>InfluxDB FDW supports pushed down some aggregate functions: count, stddev, sum, max, min.</li>
<li>InfluxDB FDW supports INSERT, DELETE statements.</li>
<li>InfluxDB FDW supports bulk INSERT by using batch_size option from PostgreSQL version 14 or later.</li>
<li>WHERE clauses including timestamp, interval and now() functions are pushed down.</li>
<li>LIMIT...OFFSET clauses are pushed down when there is LIMIT clause only or both LIMIT and OFFSET.</li>
<li>Support schemaless mode that allows access to elements in the data file without changing the table definition by using jsonb typed column.</li>
</ul>
<p>Limitations :</p>
<ul>
<li>UPDATE is not supported.</li>
<li>WITH CHECK OPTION constraints is not supported. Following limitations originate from data model and query language of InfluxDB.</li>
<li>Result sets have different number of rows depending on specified target list. For example, SELECT field1 FROM t1 and SELECT field2 FROM t1 returns different number of rows if the number of points with field1 and field2 are different in InfluxDB database.</li>
<li>Timestamp precision may be lost because timestamp resolution of PostgreSQL is microseconds while that of InfluxDB is nanoseconds.</li>
<li>Conditions like WHERE time + interval '1 day' &lt; now() do not work. Please use WHERE time &lt; now() - interval '1 day'.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is developed by Toshiba Digital Innovation Technology Center. 
Please see the repository for details.

## Etiology of lower respiratory tract in pneumonia based on metagenomic next-generation sequencing: a retrospective study

date: 2024-01-09, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Pneumonia are the leading cause of death worldwide, and antibiotic treatment remains fundamental. However, conventional sputum smears or cultures are still inefficient for obtaining pathogenic microorganisms.Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) has shown great value in nucleic acid detection, however, the NGS results for lower respiratory tract microorganisms are still poorly studied.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This study dealt with investigating the efficacy of mNGS in detecting pathogens in the lower respiratory tract of patients with pulmonary infections. A total of 112 patients admitted at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University between April 30, 2018, and June 30, 2020, were enrolled in this retrospective study. The bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was obtained from lower respiratory tract from each patient. Routine methods (bacterial smear and culture) and mNGS were employed for the identification of pathogenic microorganisms in BALF. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The average patient age was 53.0 years, with 94.6% (106/112) obtaining pathogenic microorganism results. The total mNGS detection rate of pathogenic microorganisms significantly surpassed conventional methods (93.7% vs. 32.1%, P &lt; 0.05). Notably, 75% of patients (84/112) were found to have bacteria by mNGS, but only 28.6% (32/112) were found to have bacteria by conventional approaches. The most commonly detected bacteria included <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> (19.6%), <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> (17.9%), <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (14.3%), <italic>Staphylococcus faecium</italic> (12.5%), <italic>Enterococcus faecium</italic> (12.5%), and <italic>Haemophilus parainfluenzae</italic> (11.6%). In 29.5% (33/112) of patients, fungi were identified using mNGS, including 23 cases of <italic>Candida albicans</italic> (20.5%), 18 of <italic>Pneumocystis carinii</italic> (16.1%), and 10 of <italic>Aspergillus</italic> (8.9%). However, only 7.1 % (8/112) of individuals were found to have fungi when conventional procedures were used. The mNGS detection rate of viruses was significantly higher than the conventional method rate (43.8% vs. 0.9%, P &lt; 0.05). The most commonly detected viruses included  Epstein–Barr virus (15.2%), cytomegalovirus (13.4%), circovirus (8.9%), human coronavirus (4.5%), and rhinovirus (4.5%). Only 29.4% (33/112) of patients were positive, whereas 5.4% (6/112) of patients were negative for both detection methods as shown by Kappa analysis, indicating poor consistency between the two methods (P = 0.340; Kappa analysis). </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Significant benefits of mNGS have been shown in the detection of pathogenic microorganisms in patients with pulmonary infection. For those with suboptimal therapeutic responses, mNGS can provide an etiological basis, aiding in precise anti-infective treatment.</p></sec>

## Possible modulating functions of probiotic Lactiplantibacillus plantarum in particulate matter-associated pulmonary inflammation

date: 2024-01-09, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology

<p>Pulmonary disease represents a substantial global health burden. Increased air pollution, especially fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) is the most concerned proportion of air pollutants to respiratory health. PM<sub>2.5</sub> may carry or combine with other toxic allergens and heavy metals, resulting in serious respiratory allergies and anaphylactic reactions in the host. Available treatment options such as antihistamines, steroids, and avoiding allergens/dust/pollutants could be limited due to certain side effects and immense exposure to air pollutants, especially in most polluted countries. In this mini-review, we summarized how PM<sub>2.5</sub> triggers respiratory hyperresponsiveness and inflammation, and the probiotic <italic>Lactiplantibacillus plantarum</italic> supplementation could minimize the risk of the same. <italic>L. plantarum</italic> may confer beneficial effects in PM<sub>2.5</sub>-associated pulmonary inflammation due to significant antioxidant potential. We discussed <italic>L. plantarum’s</italic> effect on PM<sub>2.5</sub>-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS), inflammatory cytokines, lipid peroxidation, and DNA damage. Available preclinical evidence shows <italic>L. plantarum</italic> induces gut-lung axis, SCFA, GABA, and other neurotransmitter signaling via gut microbiota modulation. SCFA signals are important in maintaining lung homeostasis and regulating intracellular defense mechanisms in alveolar cells. However, significant research is needed in this direction to contemplate <italic>L. plantarum</italic>’s therapeutic potential in pulmonary allergies.</p>

## First genome assembly and annotation of Sanghuangporus weigelae uncovers its medicinal functions, metabolic pathways, and evolution

date: 2024-01-09, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology

<p><italic>Sanghuangporus</italic>, also known as “Sanghuang” in China, is a well-known genus of traditional Chinese medicinal macrofungi. To make more effective use of <italic>Sanghuangporus</italic> resources, we completed the first genome assembly and annotation of a monokaryon strain of <italic>S. weigelae</italic> in the present study. A 33.96-Mb genome sequence was assembled as 13 contigs, leading to prediction of 9377 protein-coding genes. Phylogenetic and average nucleotide identity analyses indicated that the <italic>S. weigelae</italic> genome is closely related to those of other <italic>Sanghuangporus</italic> species in evolutionary tree, which clustered in one clade. Collinearity analysis revealed a high level of collinearity of <italic>S. weigelae</italic> with <italic>S. baumii</italic>, <italic>S. vaninii</italic>, and <italic>S. sanghuang</italic>. Biosynthesis pathways potentially involved in medicinal properties, including terpenoid and polysaccharide synthesis, were identified in <italic>S. weigelae</italic>, while polysaccharides were identified as the main medicinal metabolites in <italic>S. weigelae</italic>, with flavonoids more important in <italic>Sanghuangporus</italic> than other medicinal mushroom groups. Genes encoding 332 carbohydrate-active enzymes were identified in the <italic>S. weigelae</italic> genome, including major glycoside hydrolases and glycosyltransferases predicted, revealing the robust lignocellulose degradation capacity of <italic>S. weigelae</italic>. Further, 130 genes, clustered in seven classes were annotated to encode cytochromes P450 in the <italic>S. weigelae</italic> genome. Overall, our results reveal the remarkably medicinal capacity of <italic>S. weigelae</italic> and provide new insights that will inform the study of evolution and medicinal application of <italic>S. weigelae</italic>. The data are a reference resource for the formulation of scientific and rational ecological protection policies for <italic>Sanghuangporus</italic> species.</p>

## Xenophagy receptors Optn and p62 and autophagy modulator Dram1 independently promote the zebrafish host defense against Mycobacterium marinum

date: 2024-01-09, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology

<p>Anti-bacterial autophagy, also known as xenophagy, is a crucial innate immune process that helps maintain cellular homeostasis by targeting invading microbes. This defense pathway is widely studied in the context of infections with mycobacteria, the causative agents of human tuberculosis and tuberculosis-like disease in animal models. Our previous work in a zebrafish tuberculosis model showed that host defense against <italic>Mycobacterium marinum</italic> (Mm) is impaired by deficiencies in xenophagy receptors, optineurin (Optn) or sequestome 1 (p62), and Damage-regulated autophagy modulator 1 (Dram1). However, the interdependency of these receptors and their interaction with Dram1 remained unknown. In the present study, we used single and double knockout zebrafish lines in combination with overexpression experiments. We show that Optn and p62 can compensate for the loss of each other’s function, as their overexpression restores the infection susceptibility of the mutant phenotypes. Similarly, Dram1 can compensate for deficiencies in Optn and p62, and, vice versa, Optn and p62 compensate for the loss of Dram1, indicating that these xenophagy receptors and Dram1 do not rely on each other for host defense against Mm. In agreement, Dram1 overexpression in <italic>optn/p62</italic> double mutants restored the interaction of autophagosome marker Lc3 with Mm. Finally, <italic>optn/p62</italic> double mutants displayed more severe infection susceptibility than the single mutants. Taken together, these results suggest that Optn and p62 do not function downstream of each other in the anti-mycobacterial xenophagy pathway, and that the Dram1-mediated defense against Mm infection does not rely on specific xenophagy receptors.</p>

## Eliminating the invading extracellular and intracellular FnBp+ bacteria from respiratory epithelial cells by autophagy mediated through FnBp-Fn-Integrin α5β1 axis

date: 2024-01-09, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Background</title><p>We previously found that the respiratory epithelial cells could eliminate the invaded <italic>group A streptococcus</italic> (GAS) through autophagy induced by binding a fibronectin (Fn) binding protein (FnBp) expressed on the surface of GAS to plasma protein Fn and its receptor integrin α5β1 of epithelial cells. Is autophagy initiated by FnBp<sup>+</sup> bacteria via FnBp-Fn-Integrin α5β1 axis a common event in respiratory epithelial cells?</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We chose <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (<italic>S. aureus/S. a</italic>) and <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> (<italic>L. monocytogenes/L. m</italic>) as representatives of extracellular and intracellular FnBp<sup>+</sup> bacteria, respectively. The FnBp of them was purified and the protein function was confirmed by western blot, viable bacteria count, confocal and pull-down. The key molecule downstream of the action axis was detected by IP, mass spectrometry and bio-informatics analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We found that different FnBp from both <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> could initiate autophagy through FnBp-Fn-integrin α5β1 axis and this could be considered a universal event, by which host tries to remove invading bacteria from epithelial cells. Importantly, we firstly reported that S100A8, as a key molecule downstream of integrin β1 chain, is highly expressed upon activation of integrin α5β1, which in turn up-regulates autophagy.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Various FnBp from FnBp<sup>+</sup> bacteria have the ability to initiate autophagy via FnBp-Fn-Integrin α5β1 axis to promote the removal of invading bacteria from epithelial cells in the presence of fewer invaders. S100A8 is a key molecule downstream of Integrin α5β1 in this autophagy pathway.</p></sec>

## Lipid nanoparticles based on natural matrices with activity against multidrug resistant bacterial species

date: 2024-01-09, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology

<p>Lately, the bacterial multidrug resistance has been a reason to public health concerning around world. The development of new pharmacology therapies against infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria is urgent. In this work, we developed 10 NLC formulations composed of essential oils (EO), vegetable butter and surfactant. The formulations were evaluated for long-term and thermal cycling stability studies in terms of (particle size, polydispersion index and Zeta potential). <italic>In vitro</italic> antimicrobial assays were performed using disk diffusion test and by the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) performed with fresh and a year-old NLC. The most promising system and its excipients were structurally characterized through experimental methodologies (FTIR-ATR, DSC and FE-SEM). Finally, this same formulation was studied through nanotoxicity assays on the chicken embryo model, analyzing different parameters, as viability and weight changes of embryos and annexes. All the developed formulations presented long-term physicochemical and thermal stability. The formulation based on cinnamon EO presented <italic>in vitro</italic> activity against strains of <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic>, <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> isolated from humans and <italic>in vivo</italic> biocompatibility. Considering these promising results, such system is able to be further tested on <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy assays.</p>

## Antibody reactive immunomes of Ehrlichia chaffeensis and E. canis are diverse and defined by conformational antigenic determinants

date: 2024-01-09, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology

<p>For decades, the defined antibody reactive proteins of <italic>Ehrlichia chaffeensis</italic> and <italic>E. canis</italic> were limited to a small group with linear antibody epitopes. Recently, our laboratory has utilized an immunomics-based approach to rapidly screen and identify undefined <italic>Ehrlichia chaffeensis</italic> and <italic>E. canis</italic> antigenic proteins and antibody epitopes. In this study, we analyzed the remaining portion (~50%) of the <italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> and <italic>E. canis</italic> proteomes (<italic>n</italic> = 444 and <italic>n =</italic> 405 proteins, respectively), that were not examined in previous studies, to define the complete immunomes of these important pathogens. Almost half of the <italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> proteins screened (196/444) reacted with antibodies in convalescent HME patient sera, while only 43 <italic>E. canis</italic> proteins reacted with CME dog sera. New major immunoreactive proteins were identified in <italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 7) and <italic>E. canis</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 1), increasing the total number of <italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> (n = 14) and <italic>E. canis</italic> proteins (n = 18) that exhibited antibody reactivity comparable to well-defined major antigenic proteins (TRP120 and TRP19). All of the <italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> but only some <italic>E. canis</italic> major immunoreactive proteins contained major conformation-dependent antibody epitopes. The <italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> immunoreactive proteins were generally small (&lt; 250 amino acids; ~27kDa) and the <italic>E. canis</italic> proteins were slightly larger (&gt; 320 amino acids; ~35 kDa). The majority of these new <italic>Ehrlichia</italic> major immunoreactive proteins were predicted to be type I secreted effectors, some of which contained transmembrane domains. Characterization of the immunomes of <italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> and <italic>E. canis</italic> and understanding the host specific <italic>Ehrlichia</italic> immune responses will facilitate identification of protective antigens and define the biophysical epitope characteristics vital to effective vaccine development for the ehrlichioses.</p>

## Clinical features and risk factors of liver injury in patients with Chlamydia psittaci pneumonia- a retrospective analysis

date: 2024-01-09, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Background</title><p>Research into the effects of <italic>Chlamydia psittaci</italic> pneumonia on the liver has emerged in the last few years. However, no studies have systematically described liver injury in patients with psittacosis. We present the first report on the clinical features and risk factors of liver injury in patients with <italic>Chlamydia psittaci</italic> pneumonia.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We retrospectively collected the clinical parameters for 46 patients with <italic>Chlamydia psittaci</italic> pneumonia admitted to Jinhua Central Hospital from January 2019 to February 2023. We analyzed the liver function parameters and summarized the clinical characteristics and risk factors of liver injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Among the 46 patients, 39 (84.8%) had abnormal liver function, and 23 (50.0%) had liver injury. The ratio of patients with a history of alcohol consumption (39.1% vs. 4.3%, <italic>P</italic> =0.004) or severe pneumonia (56.5% vs. 26.1%, <italic>P</italic> =0.036) was higher in the liver injury group compared with the non-liver injury group. Laboratory tests showed higher lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels in the liver injury group (<italic>P &lt;</italic>0.001). The optimal cut-off LDH level associated with liver injury was 473 IU/L as determined by ROC curve analysis. Furthermore, multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that a history of alcohol consumption (odds ratio [OR] = 11.251; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.022 ~ 123.897, <italic>P</italic> =0.048) and an LDH level of ≥ 473IU/L (OR = 11.635, 95% CI = 1.832 ~ 73.869, <italic>P</italic> =0.009) were independent risk factors for liver injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>A history of alcohol consumption and an LDH level of over 473 IU/L are independent risk factors for <italic>Chlamydia psittaci</italic> pneumonia-related liver injury.

## Characterization of nontyphoidal Salmonella strains from a tertiary hospital in China: serotype diversity, multidrug resistance, and genetic insights

date: 2024-01-09, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Objective</title><p>Nontyphoidal <italic>Salmonella</italic> is a significant public health concern due to its ability to cause foodborne illnesses worldwide. This study aims to characterize the nontyphoidal <italic>Salmonella</italic> strains isolated from patients in China.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A total of 19 nontyphoidal <italic>Salmonella</italic> strains were characterized through serovar identification, antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST), biofilm formation assessment. Genetic relatedness was determined using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). WGS was employed to decipher the resistance mechanism and to contextualize the <italic>S.</italic> serovar Mbandaka strains among previously sequenced isolates in China. The biofilm associated <italic>mrkA</italic> gene was examined by PCR.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The predominant serovar identified was <italic>S.</italic> Enteritidis, followed by <italic>S.</italic> Mbandaka, <italic>S.</italic> Thompson, <italic>S.</italic> Livingston, <italic>S.</italic> Alachua, and <italic>S.</italic> Infantis. PFGE analysis indicated a notable genetic similarity among the <italic>S.</italic> Mbandaka isolates. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that these strains were likely derived from a single source that had persisted in China for over five years. One multidrug resistance (MDR) <italic>S.</italic> Enteritidis isolate carried a highly transferable IncB/O/K/Z plasmid with <italic>bla</italic><sub>CTX-M-15</sub>. One <italic>S.</italic> Thompson strain, harboring the <italic>mrkABCDF</italic> operon in an IncX1 plasmid, isolated from cutaneous lesions, demonstrated robust biofilm formation. However, no <italic>mrkABCDF</italic> loci were detected in other strains.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study emphasizes the importance of persisted surveillance and prompt response to <italic>Salmonella</italic> infections to protect public health. The dissemination of <italic>bla</italic><sub>CTX-M-15</sub>-harboring IncB/O/K/Z plasmid and the spread of virulent <italic>mrkABCDF</italic> operon among <italic>Salmonella</italic> in China and other global regions warrant close monitoring.</p></sec>

## Plasmid content of carbapenem resistant Acinetobacter baumannii isolates belonging to five International Clones collected from hospitals of Alexandria, Egypt

date: 2024-01-09, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology

<p>Multidrug resistant <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> is one of the most important nosocomial pathogens worldwide. During the last decades it has become a major threat for healthcare settings due to the high antibiotic resistance rates among these isolates. Many resistance determinants are coded by conjugative or mobilizable plasmids, facilitating their dissemination. The majority of plasmids harbored by <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> species are less than 20 Kb, however, high molecular weight elements are the most clinically relevant since they usually contain antibiotic resistance genes. The aim of this work was to describe, classify and determine the genetic content of plasmids harbored by carbapem resistant <italic>A. baumannii</italic> isolates belonging to predominant clonal lineages circulating in hospitals from Alexandria, Egypt. The isolates were subjected to S1-Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis experiments to identify high molecular weight plasmids. To further analyze the plasmid content and the genetic localization of the antibiotic resistance genes, isolates were sequenced by Illumina Miseq and MinION Mk1C and a hybrid assembly was performed using Unicycler v0.5.0. Plasmids were detected with MOBsuite 3.0.3 and Copla.py v.1.0 and mapped using the online software Proksee.ca. Replicase genes were further analyzed through a BLAST against the <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> Plasmid Typing database. Eleven plasmids ranging in size from 4.9 to 205.6 Kb were characterized and mapped. All isolates contained plasmids, and, in many cases, more than two elements were identified. Antimicrobial resistance genes such as <italic>bla</italic><sub>OXA-23</sub>, <italic>bla</italic><sub>GES-like</sub>, <italic>aph(3’)-VI</italic> and <italic>qacEΔ1</italic> were found in likely conjugative large plasmids; while virulence determinants such as septicolysin or TonB-dependent receptors were identified in plasmids of small size. Some of these resistance determinants were, in turn, located within transposons and class 1 integrons. Among the identified plasmids, the majority encoded proteins belonging to the Rep_3 family, but replicases of the RepPriCT_1 (Aci6) family were also identified. Plasmids are of high interest as antibiotic resistance control tools, since they may be used as genetic markers for antibiotic resistance and virulence, and also as targets for the development of compounds that can inhibit transfer processes.</p>

## systemd through the eyes of a musl distribution maintainer

date: 2024-01-08, from: OS News

systemd, as a service manager, is not actually a bad piece of software by itself. The fact it can act as both a service manager and an inetd(8) replacement is really cool. The unit file format is very nice and expressive. Defining mechanism and leaving policy to the administrator is a good design. Of course, nothing exists in a vacuum. I don’t like the encouragement to link daemons to libsystemd for better integration – all of the useful integrations can be done with more portable measures. And I really don’t like the fact they consider glibc to be “the Linux API” when musl, Bionic, and other libcs exist. I’d like to dive into detail on the good and the bad of systemd, as seen through my eyes as all of: end user, administrator, and developer. ↫ awilfox awilfox is a maintainer of Adélie Linux, which does not use systemd, but this blog post is one of the few reasonable, well-written, and substantiated critiques of systemd &#8211; as opposed to the usual mindless screeching you usually hear about systemd. A great read.

## The Texas Grid Is Bracing for Another Freeze

date: 2024-01-08, from: Heatmap News

	Winter has begun to arrive in Texas. In the panhandle, temperatures are expected to get as low as 22 degrees Fahrenheit on Monday, while the National Weather Service forecast office in Amarillo told residents to <a href="https://www.weather.gov/ama/novcold" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">brace themselves</a> for Tuesday, when “temperatures will plummet to some 20 to 30 degrees below normal.” The more populous parts of the state can expect more cold weather later this week and next; in Austin, lows could dip below freezing by Sunday and into next week, while in Dallas, the thermometer could reach down to 25 this weekend. Austin could have ice, possibly leading to snarled traffic and the occasional downed power line thanks to a gliding car.</p><p>
	None of this is any match for Winter Storm Uri, which paralyzed the state in February 2021, causing a multi-day blackout that killed more than 200 people<strong>. </strong>But any winter cold stretch in Texas will bring up questions about how the state’s <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/how-the-texas-power-grid-has-dodged-disaster-so-far" target="_blank">unique electricity system</a> will handle it. “It’s deep in the Texas psyche now, and anytime it gets really hot or really cold the grid is front of mind,” said Joshua Rhodes, a research scientist at the University of Texas.</p><p>
	The vast majority of Texas is on its own electric grid, and the state’s electricity market for businesses and households is far less regulated than anywhere else in the country — Texas households have more options about where they can purchase electricity from, for instance, and the offerings tend to be less standardized.<strong> </strong>While Texas does typically have low electricity prices, the system can also lead to massive spikes in what households pay. After Uri, when some customers who did still have power faced <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/20/us/texas-storm-electric-bills.html" target="_blank">charges in the five figures</a>, utilities regulators <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-17/texas-power-prices-surge-6-000-as-grid-calls-for-conservation" target="_blank">capped prices</a> at $5,000 per megawatt hour.<br/></p><p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/interactive/2023/home-electrification-heat-pumps-gas-furnace/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">As in much of the South</a>, Texan households are more like to <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=47116#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20U.S.%20Census,to%20fan%20heat%20throughout%20houses.">use electricity</a> to heat their homes, which makes a blackout during a prolonged cold snap extra deadly. The failures during Uri triggered a slew of <a href="https://www.ferc.gov/news-events/news/final-report-february-2021-freeze-underscores-winterization-recommendations" target="_blank">reports</a> and <a href="https://www.rtoinsider.com/62278-ferc-enforcement-report-closed-probe-winter-storm-uri/" target="_blank">investigations</a> into what happened and who profited from it. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission found a lack of weatherization across the board, but especially in the natural gas system, which was behind 87% of all generation outages, some due to distribution failures and others due to power production issues. There were <a href="https://energy.utexas.edu/sites/default/files/UTAustin%20%282021%29%20EventsFebruary2021TexasBlackout%2020210714.pdf" target="_blank">wind outages</a>, as well, thanks to iced turbine blades.</p><p>“ERCOT” — the Texas electricity authority — “says they’re ready, but they say they’re ready all the time,” said Ed Hirs, an energy economist and lecturer at the University of Houston. “There’s a credibility issue.”</p><p>
	There has been substantial winterization across the entire system since Uri, Rhodes said. Considering the expected lows will be around 12 degrees higher this week than they were during Uri, Rhodes added, “if any power trips offline for temperature issues, then that would worry me because that means we haven’t done our jobs.”</p>

## ‘Impossible’ to create AI tools like ChatGPT without copyrighted material, OpenAI says

date: 2024-01-08, from: OS News

The developer OpenAI has said it would be impossible to create tools like its groundbreaking chatbot ChatGPT without access to copyrighted material, as pressure grows on artificial intelligence firms over the content used to train their products. Chatbots such as ChatGPT and image generators like Stable Diffusion are “trained” on a vast trove of data taken from the internet, with much of it covered by copyright – a legal protection against someone’s work being used without permission. ↫ Dan Milmo for the Guardian I can&#8217;t become a billionaire without robbing banks so therefore robbing banks should be legal.

## Motūrus OS: microkernel operating system for the cloud written in Rust

date: 2024-01-08, from: OS News

Motūrus project builds a simple, fast, and secure operating system (Motūrus OS) for the cloud. In more specific terms, Motūrus OS (sometimes called Motor OS), is a new operating system targeting virtual machine-based workloads such as web serving, &#8220;serverless&#8221;, edge caching, etc.  Motūrus OS is a microkernel-based operating system, built in Rust, that targets virtualized workloads exclusively. It currently supports x64 KVM-based virtual machines, and can run in either Qemu or Cloud Hypervisor. Rust is the language of Motūrus OS: not only it is implemented in Rust, it also exposes its ABI in Rust, not C. ↫ Motūrus OS GitHub page At this point, there are more alternative operating systems written in Rust than there are Linux distributions, but you&#8217;re not hearing any complaints from me. While not all of these will have a bright future, they&#8217;ll teach a lot of people valuable skills and introduce a lot of people to the concept of alternative operating systems.

## GNOME 46 to introduce headless remote logins via GNOME Display Manager

date: 2024-01-08, from: OS News

The alpha version of the GNOME 46 desktop environment should be out for public testing any day now for early adopters and enthusiasts who want to get an early taste of the newly implemented features, one of them begin support for headless remote logins via GDM (GNOME Display Manager). This is one of the highly requested features for GNOME and it is achieved through the gnome-remote-desktop component, which provides a remote desktop server for the GNOME desktop to allow you to connect to your machine remotely using PipeWire. ↫ Marius Nestor The final release is planned for late March.

## The Quest to Ban the Best Raincoats in the World

date: 2024-01-08, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDg4MTg4NS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0NTE3MzE1MH0.NCjkb8cD_8UCoHv8aSnOzNxvH1vh-M31Dfo5dlgAeyw/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">Hiking gear exists so that, when nature tries to kill you, it is a little less likely to succeed. Sometimes this gear’s life-saving function is obvious — a Nalgene to carry extra water so you don’t die of thirst, or a fist-sized first-aid kit so you don’t bleed to death — while other things you don’t necessarily purchase with the thought that they might one day save your life. Like, say, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/amzn1.dv.gti.1cb8e005-16ec-9c68-5406-0e887f58a992?autoplay=0&ref_=atv_cf_strg_wb" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a small Swiss Army Knife</a>. Or, in my case, a raincoat.</p><p>Last summer, on a casual day hike in Mount Rainier National Park, my family was overtaken by a storm that, quite literally, rose up out of nowhere. It had been a sunny, clear day when we left the parking lot; at four miles in, we were being lashed by hail and gale-force winds on an exposed alpine trail, with no trees or boulders nearby for shelter.</p><p>Then, one member of our hiking party tripped.</p><p>In the split second before she stood up and confirmed she could walk out on her own, my mind raced through what I had in my pack. Stupidly, I had nothing to assemble a makeshift shelter, no warmer layers. But I <em>did</em> have my blue waterproof rainshell. In weather as extreme as the storm off Rainier that day, keeping dry is essential; if we’d had to wait out the rain due to a broken ankle, we’d have become soaked and hypothermic long before help arrived. My raincoat, I realized during those terrifying seconds, could save my life.</p><p>But what made my raincoat so trustworthy that day on the mountain could also, in theory, kill me — or, more likely, kill or sicken any of the thousands of people who live downstream of the manufacturers that make waterproofing chemicals and the landfills where waterproof clothing is incinerated or interred. Outdoor apparel is typically <a href="https://heatmap.news/lifestyle/ultraprocessed-fashion-forever-chemicals" target="_self">ultraprocessed</a> and treated using perfluoroalkyl and poly-fluoroalkyl substances, a class of water- and stain-resistant “forever chemicals” that are more commonly referred to as PFAS (pronounced “pee-fass”). After decades of work by environmental groups and health advocates, states and retailers are finally banning the sale of textiles that have been treated with the chemicals, which in the outdoor industry often manifest in the form of Gore-Tex membranes or “durable water repellent” treatments.</p><p>These bans are fast approaching: Beginning <a href="https://www.saferstates.org/press-room/first-in-nation-ban-on-pfas-forever-chemicals-in-menstrual-products-cleaning-ingredients-cookware-and-dental-floss-signed-by-minnesota-governor-today/#:~:text=Several%20states%20have%20adopted%20restrictions,many%20categories%20of%20textile%20products." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in 2025</a> — less than 12 months from now — California will forbid the sale of most PFAS-treated textiles; New York will restrict them in apparel; and Washington will regulate stain- and waterproofing treatments, with similar regulations pending or approved in a number of other states. Following <a href="https://toxicfreefuture.org/press-room/rei-announces-it-will-ban-pfas-in-all-textiles/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pressure from activists</a>, the nation’s largest outdoor retailer, REI, also announced last winter that it will ban PFAS in all the textile products and cookware sold in its stores starting fall 2024; <a href="https://s27.q4cdn.com/812551136/files/doc_downloads/csr/Restricted-Substances-List-(RSL)-April-2022.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dick’s Sporting Goods</a> will also eliminate PFAS from its brand-name clothing. </p><p>This will upend the outdoor apparel industry. Some of the best coats in the world — legendary gear like Arc’teryx’s Beta AR and the <a href="https://toxicfreefuture.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/toxic-convenience.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">traditional construction</a> of the <a href="https://www.patagonia.com/stories/say-goodbye-to-forever-chemicals/story-133800.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Patagonia Torrentshell</a> — use, or until recently used, PFAS in their waterproofing processes or in their jackets’ physical membranes. Though the bans frequently allow vague, temporary loopholes for gear intended for “extreme wet conditions” or “expeditions,” such exceptions will be closed off by the end of the 2020s. (Patagonia has “committed to making all membranes and water-repellent finishes without [PFAS] by 2025,” Gin Ando, a spokesperson for the company, told me; Arc’teryx spokesperson Amy May shared that the company is “committed to moving towards PFAS-free materials in its products.”)</p><p>Even if you aren’t buying expedition-level gear, your closet almost certainly contains PFAS. A 2022 study by Toxic-Free Future found the chemicals <a href="https://toxicfreefuture.org/research/pfas-in-stain-water-resistant-products-study/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in nearly 75%</a> of products labeled as waterproof or stain-resistant.

PFAS are manufactured chains of fluorine-carbon bonds that are <em>incredibly</em> difficult to break (the precise number of carbons is also used in the naming process, which is why you’ll hear them called “C8” or “C6,” sometimes, as well). Because of this strong bond, other molecules slip off when they come into contact with the fluorine-carbon chain; you can observe this in <a href="https://www.ecocenter.org/test-your-products-pfas-water-droplet" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a DIY test at home</a> by dripping water onto a fabric and watching it roll off, leaving your garment perfectly dry.</p><p>It is also because of this bond that PFAS are so stubbornly persistent — in the environment, certainly, but also in us. An estimated 98% to 99% of people have <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/why-pfas-are-so-impervious-and-who-is-most-at-risk-from-the-forever-chemicals" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">traces of PFAS</a> in their bodies. Researchers have found the molecules in breast milk, rainwater, and Antarctica’s snow. We inhale them in dust and drink them in our tap water, and because <a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/8/25/23318667/pfas-forever-chemicals-safety-drinking-water" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">they look a little like a fatty acid to our bodies</a>, they can cause health problems that we’re only beginning to grasp. So far, PFAS have been linked to <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/research/what-we-study/pfas" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">kidney and testicular cancer</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36334833/#:~:text=Conclusion%3A%20Based%20on%20the%20evidence,in%20odds%20ratio%20for%20infertility." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">decreased fertility</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300483X21001682#:~:text=Multiple%20epidemiological%20studies%20have%20reported,about%2010%20mg%2FdL)." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">elevated cholesterol</a>, <a href="https://www.sdu.dk/en/nyheder/forskere-finder-direkte-sammenhaeng-mellem-pfas-og-overvaegt#:~:text=A%20new%20study%20finds%20that,body%20weight%20after%20weight%20loss." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">weight gain</a>, <a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/about/newsroom/2023/certain-per-and-polyfluoroalkyl-forever-chemicals-identified-as-potential-risk-factor-for-thyroid-cancer#:~:text=Mount%20Sinai%20researchers%20have%20discovered,study%20published%20in%20eBioMedicine%20today." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">thyroid disease</a>, the pregnancy complication <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/11/211101190847.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pre-eclampsia</a>, <a href="https://news.emory.edu/stories/2023/09/hs_PFAS_in_newborns_14-09-2023/story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">increased risk of preterm birth</a> and <a href="https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/ehp10723#:~:text=PFAS%20have%20been%20associated%20with,both%20animal%20and%20human%20studies.&text=Reductions%20in%20birthweight%20have%20been,and%20perfluorononanoic%20acid%20(PFNA)." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">low birth weight</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7926449/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hormone interference</a>, and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37337047/#:~:text=Abstract,vaccination%20may%20modify%20such%20effects." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reduced vaccine response in children</a>.</p><p>Chemical companies and industry groups <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/06/05/forever-chemicals-state-bans-pfas/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">often argue</a> that certain PFAS are demonstrably worse than others; the so-called “long-chain” molecules, for instance, are thought to have higher bioaccumulation and toxicity potential, and have mostly been replaced by “short-chain” molecules. But as Arlene Blum, a pioneering mountaineer and the founder of the Green Science Policy Institute, an environmental advocacy organization that opposes PFAS, told me, “in all the cases that we’ve studied,” forever chemicals have been found “to be harmful in one way or another,” whether they’re <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1385894719319096?fbclid=IwAR3zIeEDnluiG2QKSGTh4HN0Q-sIsBvr_WuZAeS6dkrIshQBWyWQ8JF-8gA" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">short or long</a>.</p><p>From a health perspective, the good news is that activists are winning. While initial efforts to protect humans and the environment from PFAS <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sdwa/questions-and-answers-drinking-water-health-advisories-pfoa-pfos-genx-chemicals-and-pfbs#q2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in the mid-2000s</a> resulted only in the voluntary phase-out of long-chain chemicals like PFOA and PFOS, the new laws target the entire class of thousands of compounds to prevent an ongoing game of whack-a-mole with chemical manufacturers. (A recent report <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/nov/07/us-chemical-industry-110-million-thwart-pfas-legislation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">by<em> The Guardian</em></a> found that the chemical industry spent $110 million in the last two U.S. election cycles trying to thwart or slow the various bans.) Public pressure campaigns mounted against ostensibly sustainability-minded companies like REI have prompted store-initiated PFAS bans that will also influence future gear sold in the United States. (REI was long <a href="https://grist.org/health/outdoor-industry-ditches-forever-chemicals-rei-pfas/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a PFAS laggard</a>, and was even hit in 2022 with a <a href="https://truthinadvertising.org/class-action/reis-waterproof-apparel/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">class-action lawsuit</a> over allegedly marketing PFAS-containing clothes as “sustainable.” The company declined to comment for this story. Dick’s Sporting Goods did not respond to requests for comment.)</p><p>But as the days tick closer to the first PFAS bans coming into effect in stores this fall, outdoor apparel companies are still scrambling to redesign their clothing. Some alternatives to PFAS do exist — Blum swears by her PFAS-free Black Diamond jacket — though even the most ardent supporters of the forever chemical bans will admit the waterproofing alternatives haven’t 100% caught up yet.</p><p>“The main concern that most people have in the industry is the amount of work that it’s going to take to meet these guidelines,” Chris Steinkamp, the head of advocacy at the trade association Snowsports Industries America, told me. “Because PFAS is omnipresent. Unfortunately, they’re pretty much in everything.”</p><p class="drop-caps">Many outdoor apparel companies genuinely want to comply with the coming bans, Karolína Brabcová, the campaign manager for toxic chemicals in consumer products at Arnika, a Czech environmental non-profit, told me. “It’s not such a matter of greenwashing here,” she said. “It’s more about the fact that you’ve got the chemical industry on one side and the downstream users joining the consumers on the other side. And the downstream users don’t know everywhere the PFAS are being used; it’s a business secret.”</p><p>In one case <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-02-02/raincoats-without-toxic-pfas-chemicals-are-coming" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">detailed by <em>Bloomberg</em></a>, the Swedish company Fjällräven had stopped using PFAS in its products, only to learn from a 2012 Greenpeace investigation that the chemicals were still present in its apparel. “A supplier using fluorochemistry on another company’s products was cross-contaminating Fjällräven’s,” the <em>Bloomberg</em> authors write, adding that “subsequent testing revealed” just having “products in stores near products from other companies that used the chemicals still resulted in low levels of contamination.” </p><p>It isn’t always the case, however, that clothing manufacturers are unwitting victims of chemical sloppiness. Some apparel companies have taken advantage of the alphabet soup of chemical names to look more sustainable than they are. “We’ve seen in recent years products labeled as ‘PFOA-free’ or ‘PFOS-free,’ which suggests that they do not contain the long-chain PFAS that have largely been phased out from production in the United States,” Blum warned me. “That’s really misleading because oftentimes it’s a signal a product likely contains other PFAS chemicals, which may be just as persistent and may also be quite toxic in production to disposal.”</p><p>The reason I could count on my raincoat to protect me in the mountains, though, was because, like most expedition-level gear, it is made of <a href="https://www.gore-tex.com/sustainability/protect-the-planet/reduce-chemical-impacts" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a membrane manufactured by Gore-Tex</a>, with an additional DWR waterproofing finish <a href="https://www.patagonia.com/stories/our-dwr-problem/story-17791.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">that also contains PFAS</a>. Gore-Tex is known in the outdoors industry for making the holy grail of performance fabrics: Its membranes are waterproof, durable, and breathable enough to exercise in, a challenging and impressive combination to nail. But to achieve this, the company has traditionally used the fluoropolymer PTFE, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/amzn1.dv.gti.c6b73311-9e06-1b77-7872-e437b0923c68?autoplay=0&ref_=atv_cf_strg_wb" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a notorious forever chemical</a> you probably know by the trademarked name Teflon.</p><p>This technology — or rather, these chemicals — are incredibly and irresistibly good at what they do. “The terrible truth,” <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/best-rain-jackets/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Wired</em> wrote</a> in its list of raincoat recommendations updated this past December, “is that if you’re going to be exposed [to inclement weather] for multiple hours, you are probably not going to be able to rely on a [PFAS]-free DWR to keep hypothermia at bay.”</p><p>When I reached out to Gore-Tex about its use of PFAS, company spokesperson Julie Evans told me via email that “there are important distinctions among materials associated with the term PFAS” and that the fluoropolymers Gore uses, such as PTFE, “are not the same as those substances that are bioavailable, mobile, and persistent.” She stressed that “not all PFAS are the same” and that PTFE and the other fluoropolymers in the Gore arsenal meet the standards of low concern, and are “extremely stable and do not degrade in the environment,” are “too large to be bioavailable,” and are “non-toxic [and] safe to use from an environmental and human perspective.” The National Resource Defense Council, by contrast, <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/pfas_scorecard_r_22-04-b_03_locked.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">writes</a> that PFAS polymers like PTFE, “when added as a coating or membrane to a raincoat or other product, can pose a toxic risk to wearers, just as other PFAS can.” </p><p>Some of the environmental health advocates I spoke with said Gore-Tex’s language was misleading. Mike Schade, the director of Toxic-Free Future’s Mind the Store program, which pressures retailers to avoid stocking items that use hazardous chemicals, told me that while it is “laudable that the company has phased some PFAS out of their products … what we’re concerned about is the entire class. We think it’s misleading to consumers and to the public to suggest that other PFAS are not of environmental concern.”</p><p>Blum, of the Green Science Policy Institute, admitted that while “probably your Gore-Tex jacket won’t hurt you” — there is <a href="https://www.outdoorresearch.com/blogs/stories/what-is-pfas" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">limited evidence</a> that PFAS will leech into your body just from wearing it — there’s a more significant issue at the heart of the PFAS debate. “When you go from the monomer to the polymer” in the chemical manufacturing process, she said, it “contaminates the drinking water in the area where it’s made.” The disposal process — and especially incineration, a common fate for discarded clothing — is another opportunity for PFAS to shed into the environment. People who live near landfills and chemical manufacturing plants in industrial hubs like <a href="https://www.ewg.org/interactive-maps/pfas_contamination/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Michigan</a> and many cities in <a href="https://apparelresources.com/business-news/sustainability/transforming-bangladesh-manufacturing-hub-meet-bangladesh-initiative/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bangladesh</a> suffer from PFAS at disproportionate levels.</p><p>So then, where do we go from here? Hikers, skiers, mountaineers, fly-fishers — they all still need clothing to stay dry. “Our industry is committed to performance and making sure that the gear that people are sold can live up to the standards that athletes need,” Steinkamp said. “I know that is top of mind, and that’s what’s making [the transition] so hard.”</p><p>But it also might be the case that our gear is <em>too</em> waterproof. “When we think about the intended performance of outdoor gear, there’s a lot of expectation that your gear will keep you extremely dry,” Kaytlin Moeller, the regional sustainability manager at Fenix Outdoor North America, the parent company of outdoors brands like Fjällräven and Royal Robbins, told me. “But when we really start to look at it,” she added, “I think part of the question is: What is the level of functionality that is really necessary for the customer to have a positive experience outdoors and be prepared for their adventure?”</p><p>It’s probably less than you think; consumers frequently don Everest-level technologies to walk their dogs for 15 minutes in a drizzle. “As responsible creators of products, it’s our job to balance functionality with impact,” Moeller said. “And in terms of [PFAS], it just wasn’t worth the risk and the carcinogenic qualities to continue putting that treatment on our products when there are other innovative coatings and constructions that we can use.”</p><p>Those alternatives, like innovative fabric weavings and proprietary waxes, might not sound as high-tech as hydrophobic chemicals. Still, for the vast majority of regular people — and even most outdoor recreators — it’s likely more than enough to stay comfortably dry. “We’ve been going into the outdoors for hundreds and hundreds of years without these chemicals,” Schade pointed out. “We can do it again.”</p><p>Luckily for everything and everyone on the planet, new waterproofing products are getting better by the day. Gore-Tex has spent “the better part of the last decade” developing its new PFAS-free “ePE membrane,” Evans told me. Short for expanded polyethylene, ePE is fluorine-free (albeit, <a href="https://www.mensjournal.com/gear/gore-tex-epe-membrane" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">derived from fossil fuels</a>) and has been adopted by Patagonia, Arc’teryx, and others in the outdoor industry as a PFAS-free alternative. Evans described it as feeling “a little lighter and softer” than old-school Gore-Tex, but “with all the same level of performance benefits” as the historic products. </p><p>Other companies, including Patagonia, have been <a href="https://www.patagonia.com/stories/say-goodbye-to-forever-chemicals/story-133800.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">transparent</a> about their phase-out goals and the ongoing difficulties of the PFAS-free transition; Gin, the Patagonia spokesperson, told me that as of this fall, “92% of our materials by volume with water-repellent chemistries are made without” PFAS, and that the new waterproofing “stands up to the demands of our most technical items.” Deuter, Black Diamond, Outdoor Research, Jack Wolfskin, Mammut, Marmot, and prAna are among other outdoor brands that are <a href="https://pfascentral.org/pfas-free-products/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">working to remove</a> PFAS from their gear. </p><p>“We have to work together, collaboratively, if we really want to eliminate them — to the point of the verbiage around being [PFAS]-free,” Moeller stressed. “No one can be [PFAS]-free ‘til everyone in the industry is, because of the risk of cross-contamination.”</p><p>Then there are the consumers who will need to adjust. I admit, in the weeks before beginning the reporting for this article, I bought myself another raincoat. It was on sale from one of my favorite outdoor brands, and I was attracted to its aggressively cheerful shade of Morton Salt-girl yellow, which I thought would also help me stand out in the case of a future emergency.</p><p>At the time, I hadn’t even thought to check what it was made of; what mattered to me was how, when I slipped it on, I became amphibious — like some kind of marine mammal, slick and impervious to the rain. Stepping out of my front door and <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/nyc-flooding-whirlpool-subway-sea-lions" target="_self">into a downpour</a>, I felt practically invincible.</p>

## Start now, don’t wait

date: 2024-01-08, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1>Start now, don’t wait</h1>

<p>If I had young people ask me for advice (which they aren’t and when I was young I also didn’t) I’d say this: The world is designed to keep you docile and distracted. If you want to do adventurous things, risk things, go far, you must do it now. If you wait, you will be too late.</p>

<p>Everybody going on adventure everywhere is ill prepared. There fact that you cannot prepare is what makes it an adventure. Great things were done by people who were ill prepared.</p>

<p>It’s true for sports, for your career, for politics. If you wait until the time is right, all the people who got started when the time was not right will have made the decisions for you.</p>

<p>The same is true for any kind of change. People like me tell you that we’ve got this but we don’t – and by the time you realize that everybody is fumbling and improvising, and when you finally learn how important it is to network and to be sly, how nobody who gets anything done just speaks the truth, when you realize that just because you are right people aren’t going to change their opinions, when you realize that to make changes you need to be politically active, to organize, even though you won’t learn how to do this in school because school prepares you for the world that is, for the system that upholds it, not the better world that is possible because it isn’t tried and true and nobody is financing that, then you’ll be as old as me and still won’t have done a thing.</p>

<p>Sure, it’s never too late but if you get started early, there’s still time.</p>

<p>And if instead you think, old man, I have done all that and more, what are you talking about? Then I am relieved and my fears are unfounded. Thank you!</p>

## Grumpy, grouchy and cranky

date: 2024-01-08, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>No, we&#8217;re not talking about three of Snow White&#8217;s seven dwarfs — we&#8217;re talking about the mood of the American consumer. Despite low levels of unemployment, solid GDP growth and cooling inflation, Americans remain pretty darn sour on the economy. What gives? Plus, China is sanctioning five American defense contractors, and a massive new train line in Mexico is stirring controversy among environmentalists.</p>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-01-08, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

I would like to give a LLM a pointer to a folder of my writing and say "learn this" and then a few hours or days later I'd be able to ask it questions about what I wrote. I also have folders of stuff my parents wrote. It would be kind of interesting to feed those into a LLM and then ask questions about them. Could be the equivalent of ten years of therapy.

## AM Briefing: Why Insurers Are 'Quiet Quitting'

Insurance companies are ‘quiet quitting’ in extreme weather regions </h3><p><strong></strong>Insurance companies are “<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=bc9b4edcaa&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">quiet quitting</a>” in certain high-risk areas of the United States, as extreme weather disasters become more frequent and more costly, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=a33bd6d62f&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reports</a> <em>The Wall Street Journal.</em> Insurance agents and analysts tell the paper that, rather than face public backlash from officially abandoning states like Florida or California, carriers are resorting to more subtle – but equally effective – tactics to “choke off” new business. These include closing local offices or making it difficult for homeowners to even get a quote unless they fight through layers of red tape. “Most of the carriers have just flat out said, we are not accepting new business right now [in California]. But that statement is made to insurance agencies, not the public,” says Timothy Gaspar, head of a Los Angeles-based insurance agency. “Or they’re making it next to impossible to get a new policy.”</p><h3>2. Winter storm leaves nearly 2,000 homes flooded in England</h3><p><strong></strong>The devastating firsthand effects of the climate crisis are playing out in real time in England, where flooding from storm Henk left several villages under water and nearly 2,000 homes damaged.

Shipowners reluctant to upgrade to greener vessels </h3><p><strong></strong>The global shipping fleet is getting old. A <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=b4036c841b&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a> from the <em>Financial Times</em> finds shipowners are resisting growing pressure to order newer, greener vessels and decarbonize the sector, opting instead to hold on to older ships. The average age of the global container shipping fleet is now 14.3 years, and the average age of tankers is 12.9 years. Why are owners keeping their aging vessels? One reason is they’re not confident in the availability of new energy sources like green fuel. Another is the soaring resale value of second-hand ships, which are being bought up by a “shadow fleet” transporting Russian oil. The United Nations International Maritime Organization (IMO) recently set a 2050 net zero target for global shipping, but no legally binding measures have been set to facilitate the goal. International shipping <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=a10c968ac4&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">produced</a> about 2% of the world’s energy-related carbon emissions in 2022. </p><h3>5. Researchers want to use seawater to ‘refreeze’ Arctic ice</h3><p><strong></strong>This week a team of British researchers will embark on a mission to learn if pumping seawater on top of sea ice can “refreeze” the Arctic, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=7947ee2ba1&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reports</a> the <em>Times</em> of London. As global temperatures rise, sea ice is rapidly shrinking, decimating habitats for wildlife and exacerbating a global warming feedback loop: Less ice means more water to absorb the sun’s energy. The scientists plan to cut a hole in the ice and pump seawater on top of it, which they hope will freeze, “speeding up the natural freezing process underneath the ice,” the <em>Times</em> explains.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

Another is whether powering the project could even be feasible. This particular trial is being powered by a hydrogen fuel cell, but reversing ice loss trends would require about 10 million pumps. As one researcher put it: “That’s a lot of pumps.” This is one of several engineering methods being floated as potential solutions to the rapidly worsening sea ice problem, the <em>Times</em> reports.

## Second Interdisciplinary Workshop on Reimagining Democracy

date: 2024-01-08, updated: 2024-01-09, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Last month, I convened the Second Interdisciplinary Workshop on Reimagining Democracy (<a href="https://www.schneier.com/iword/2023/">IWORD 2023</a>) at the Harvard Kennedy School Ash Center. As with <a href="https://www.schneier.com/iword/2022/">IWORD 2022</a>, the goal was to bring together a diverse set of thinkers and practitioners to talk about how democracy might be reimagined for the twenty-first century.</p>
<p>My thinking is very broad here. Modern democracy was invented in the mid-eighteenth century, using mid-eighteenth-century technology. Were democracy to be invented from scratch today, with today’s technologies, it would look very different. Representation would look different. Adjudication would look different. Resource allocation and reallocation would look different. Everything would look different, because we would have much more powerful technology to build on and no legacy systems to worry about...</p>

## China clamps down on weapons sales to Taiwan

<p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> China has announced sanctions against five American arms manufacturers over weapons sales to Taiwan.The move comes just ahead of this weekend&#8217;s Taiwanese elections. Also, trains are starting to run on Mexico’s new multibillion-dollar train network, known as Tren Maya. It’s projected to bring 2 million more tourists a year to the impoverished Yucatan Peninsula, but critics say it’s an environmental catastrophe.</p>

## US Investigators Recover Key Part From Alaska Airlines 737 MAX Jet

date: 2024-01-08, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said late on Sunday the "key missing component" from the Boeing 737 MAX 9 jet involved in an Alaska Airlines emergency landing had been recovered from the backyard of a suburban home.


The plug door tore off the left side of an Alaska Airlines jet on Friday following takeoff from Portland, Oregon, en route to Ontario, California, depressurizing the plane and forcing pilots to turn back and land safely with all 171 passengers and six crew on board.


The Federal Aviation Administration on Saturday ordered the temporary grounding of 171 Boeing MAX 9 jets installed with the same panel, which weighs about 27 kg and covers an optional exit door mainly used by low-cost airlines.


The missing plug door was recovered on Sunday by a Portland school teacher identified only as "Bob" in the Cedar Hills neighborhood who found it in his backyard, NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said, saying she was "very relieved" it had been found.


She had earlier told reporters the aircraft part was a "key missing component" to determine why the accident occurred.


"Our structures team will want to look at everything on the door - all of the components on the door to see to look at witness marks, to look at any paint transfer, what shape the door was in when found. That can tell them a lot about what occurred," she said.


The force from the loss of the plug door was strong enough to blow open the cockpit door during flight, said Homendy, who said it must have been a "terrifying event" to experience.


"They heard a bang," Homendy said of the pilots, who were interviewed by investigators.


A quick reference laminated checklist flew out the door, while the first officer lost her headset, she said. "Communication was a serious issue... It was described as chaos."


Homendy said the cockpit voice recorder did not capture any data because it had been overwritten and again called on regulators to mandate retrofitting existing planes with recorders that capture 25 hours of data, up from the two hours required at present.


Earlier pressurization issues


Homendy said the auto pressurization fail light illuminated on the same Alaska Airlines aircraft on Dec. 7, Jan. 3 and Jan. 4, but it was unclear if there was any connection between those incidents and the accident.


Alaska Airlines made a decision after the warnings to restrict the aircraft from making long flights over water to Hawaii so that it could return quickly to an airport if needed, Homendy said.


The Seattle-based carrier said earlier in response to questions about the warning lights that aircraft pressurization system write-ups were typical in commercial aviation operations with large planes.


The airline said, "in every case, the write up was fully evaluated and resolved per approved maintenance procedures and in full compliance with all applicable FAA regulations."


Alaska Airlines added it has an internal policy to restrict aircraft with multiple maintenance write-ups on some systems from long flights over water that was not required by the FAA.

 

Planes grounded


The FAA said on Sunday the affected fleet of Boeing MAX 9 planes, including those operated by other carriers such as United Airlines, would remain grounded until the regulator was satisfied they were safe.


The FAA initially said on Saturday the required inspections would take four to eight hours, leading many in the industry to assume the planes could very quickly return to service.


But criteria for the checks have yet to be agreed between the FAA and Boeing, meaning airlines have yet to receive detailed instructions, people familiar with the matter said.


The FAA must approve Boeing's inspection criteria before the checks can be completed and planes can resume flights. Alaska Airlines said late on Sunday it had still not received instructions from Boeing.


Alaska Airlines canceled 170 flights on Sunday and a further 60 on Monday and said travel disruptions from the grounding were expected to last through at least midweek. United, which has grounded its 79 MAX 9s, canceled 230 flights on Sunday, or 8% of scheduled departures.


The accident has put Boeing back under scrutiny as it awaits certification of its smaller MAX 7 as well as the larger MAX 10, which is needed to compete with a key Airbus model.


In 2019, global authorities subjected all MAX planes to a wider grounding that lasted 20 months after crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia linked to poorly designed cockpit software killed a total of 346 people.

## Docs observability, or measuring docs inside a product-docs system

date: 2024-01-08, from: Blog by Fabrizio Ferri-Benedetti

<p>As technical writers we want to know if the docs we’re writing are accomplishing their goals. In other words, we want to know how good are docs relative to the business goals they’re aiming to support or improve. Are docs serving their purpose? Which of <a href="https://swizec.com/blog/the-3-budgets/">the three budgets</a> are docs supporting? When tech bubbles burst, roles usually seen as cost centers, such as tech writing, are ripe for layoffs, no matter how staunchly we defend them.

## 'Oppenheimer' Dominates Golden Globes, 'Poor Things' Upsets 'Barbie' in Comedy

date: 2024-01-08, from: VOA News USA

BEVERLY HILLS, California — "Oppenheimer has dominated the Golden Globe Awards, taking home the night's top honor. Yorgos Lanthimos' "Poor Things" has won best comedy or musical at the 81st Golden Globes, an upset victory over the category favorite, "Barbie." 

Emma Stone also won for her performance in "Poor Things."


On the television side, "Succession" and "The Bear" are took multiple honors. Christopher Nolan's epic American drama "Oppenheimer" picked up five big awards including best drama film, best director for Nolan, best actor for Cillian Murphy, best supporting actor for Robert Downey Jr. and for Ludwig Göransson's score.


Paul Giamatti and Da'Vine Joy Randolph both won for their performances in "The Holdovers."


Christopher Nolan's blockbuster biopic "Oppenheimer" dominated the 81st Golden Globes, winning five awards including best drama, while Yorgos Lanthimos' Frankenstein riff "Poor Things" pulled off an upset victor over "Barbie" to triumph in the best comedy or musical category.


If awards season has been building toward a second match-up of Barbenheimer, this round went to "Oppenheimer."




The film also won best director for Nolan, best drama actor for Cillian Murphy, best supporting actor for Robert Downey Jr. and for Ludwig Göransson's score.


"I don't think it was a no-brainer by any stretch of the imagination to make a three-hour talky movie — R-rated by the way — about one of the darkest developments in our history," said producer Emma Thomas accepting the night's final award and thanking Universal chief Donna Langley.


Along with best comedy or musical, "Poor Things" also won for Emma Stone's performance as Bella, a Victorian-era woman experiencing a surreal sexual awakening.


"I see this as a rom-com," said Stone. "But in the sense that Bella falls in love with life itself, rather than a person.


She accepts the good and the bad in equal measure, and that really made me look at life differently."


Lily Gladstone won best actress in a dramatic film for Martin Scorsese's "Killers of the Flower Moon." Gladstone, who began her speech speaking the language of her native tribe, Blackfeet Nation, is the first Indigenous winner in the category.


"This is a historic win," said Gladstone. "It doesn't just belong to me."


The Globes were in their ninth decade but facing a new and uncertain chapter. After a tumultuous few years of scandal, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association was dissolved, leaving a new Globes, on a new network (CBS), to try to regain its perch as the third biggest award show of the year, after the Oscars and Grammys. Even the menu (sushi from Nobu) was remade.




"Golden Globes journalists, thank you for changing your game, therefore changing your name," said Downey in his acceptance speech.


It got off to a rocky start. Host Jo Koy took the stage at the Beverly Hilton International Ballroom in Beverly Hills, California.


The Filipino American stand-up hit on some expected topics: Ozempic, Meryl Streep's knack for winning awards and the long-running "Oppenheimer." ("I needed another hour.")


After one joke flubbed, Koy, who was named host after some bigger names reportedly passed, also noted how fast he was thrust into the job.


"Yo, I got the gig 10 days ago. You want a perfect monologue?" said Koy. "I wrote some of these and they're the ones you're laughing at."


Hi, Barbie


Downey's win, his third Globe, denied one to "Kenergy." Ryan Gosling had been seen as his stiffest competition, just one of the many head-to-head contests between "Oppenheimer" and Greta Gerwig's "Barbie."


The filmmakers faced each other in the best director category, where Nolan triumphed.


It was two hours before "Barbie," the year's biggest hit with more than $1.4 billion in ticket sales, won an award Sunday. Billie Eilish's "What Was I Made For?" took best song, and swiftly after, "Barbie" took the Globes' new honor for "cinematic and box office achievement."


Some thought that award might go to Taylor Swift, whose "Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour" also set box-office records. Swift, though, remains winless in five Globe nods.


Margot Robbie, star and producer of "Barbie," accepted the award in a pink gown modeled after 1977's Superstar Barbie.


"We'd like to dedicate this to every single person on the planet who dressed up and went to the greatest place on Earth: the movie theaters," said Robbie.


"Barbie" and "Oppenheimer," two blockbusters brought together by a common release date, also faced off in the best screenplay category.


But in an upset, Justine Triet and Arthur Harari won for the script to the French courtroom drama "Anatomy of a Fall." Later, Triet's film picked up best international film, too.


Though the Globes have no direct correlation with the Academy Awards, they can boost campaigns at a crucial juncture. Oscar nomination voting starts Thursday, and the twin sensations of Barbenheimer remain frontrunners.


Other contenders loom, though, like "Poor Things" and "The Holdovers."


Paul Giamatti and Da'Vine Joy Randolph both won for Alexander Payne's "The Holdovers." Giamatti, reuniting with Payne two decades after "Sideways," won best actor and Randolph won for her supporting performance as a grieving woman in the 1970s-set boarding school drama.


"Oh, Mary you have changed my life," Randolph said of her character. "You have made me feel seen in so many ways that I have never imagined."


Hayao Miyazaki's "The Boy and the Heron" won best animated film, an upset over "Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse."


'Succession,'  'The Bear' Lead TV Winners


The final season of "Succession" cleaned up on the television side. It won best drama series for the third time, a mark that ties a record set by "Mad Men" and "The X-Files." Three stars from the HBO series also won: Matt Macfadyen, Sarah Snook and Kieran Culkin.


"It is bittersweet, but things like this make it rather sweeter," said "Succession" creator Jesse Armstrong.


Hulu's "The Bear" also came away with a trio of awards, including best comedy series. Jeremy Allen White won for the second time, but this time he had company.


Ayo Edebiri won her first Globe for her leading performance in the Hulu show's second season. She thanked the assistants of her agents and managers.


"To the people who answer my emails, you're the real ones," said Edebiri.


"Beef" won three awards: best limited series as well as acting awards for Ali Wong and Steven Yeun.


The Globes also added a new stand-up special award. That went, surprisingly, to Ricky Gervais, who didn't attend the show he so often hosted. Some expected Chris Rock to win for "Selective Outrage," his stand-up response to the Will Smith slap.


The Globes Comeback


A few years ago, the Golden Globes were on the cusp of collapse. After The Los Angeles Times reported that the HFPA had no Black members, Hollywood boycotted the organization.


The 2022 Globes were all but canceled and taken off TV. After reforms, the Globes returned to NBC last year in a one-year deal, but the show was booted to Tuesday evening.


With Jerrod Carmichael hosting, the telecast attracted 6.3 million viewers, a new low on NBC and a far cry from the 20 million that once tuned in.


The Golden Globes were acquired by Eldridge Industries and Dick Clark Productions, which Penske Media owns, and turned into a for-profit venture.


The HFPA (which typically numbered around 90 voters) was dissolved and a group of some 300 entertainment journalists from around the world now vote for the awards.


Questions still remain about the Globes' long-term future, but their value to Hollywood studios remains providing a marketing boost to awards contenders. (The Oscars won't be held until March 10.)


This year, because of the actors and writers strikes, the Globes are airing ahead of the Emmys, which were postponed to Jan. 15.


With movie ticket sales still 20% off the pre-pandemic pace and the industry facing a potentially perilous 2024 at the box office, Hollywood needed the Golden Globes as much as it ever has.


The most comical evaluation on the Globes came from presenters Will Ferrell and Kristin Wiig, who blamed the awards body for the constant interruption of a song they found irresistible while otherwise solemnly presenting best actor in a drama.


A furious, dancing Ferrell shouted: "The Golden Globes have not changed!"

Going to take tonight off, as Buddy&#8217;s season has ended and he is on vacation so we have been off gallivanting. I need to catch up on some sleep. One of the good things about hitting the road with a man who is accustomed to getting up at 4:00 is that he tiptoes out in the morning to see the sights while I sleep in, and then comes back to the hotel with coffee and a bagel or pastry.

He said I was a good <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/01/02.html#a123238">sports writer</a> and boasted of the current Celtics team (he's from Boston). They're worth boasting about. What a team, such depth and so many interesting players. They were great before they added <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/11/09.html#a135827">Kristaps Porzingis</a>, who we know well in New York. He was our rookie unicorn and franchise player at the end of the Phil Jackson debacle. He's one of those ex-Knicks we still root for, so I feel an affinity for this year's Celtics. I would pay to see them kill a west coast team like the Warriors or Kings in this year's finals. Anyway, I write sports for people who are not sports fans, though I think everyone who loves politics or business should pay close attention to sports, because it all happens quickly in sport, and the human element is so visible and front and center. I'm glad Chris is a basketball fan. Maybe we can go to a Knicks-Celtics game sometime, either in Boston or NYC. The Knicks are getting good, and it likely would be a good game and Knicks could even win. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">💥</span>

## First US Lunar Lander In More Than 50 Years Rockets Toward Moon With Commercial Deliveries

date: 2024-01-08, from: VOA News USA

Cape Canaveral, Florida — The first U.S. lunar lander in more than 50 years rocketed toward the moon Monday, launching private companies on a space race to make deliveries for NASA and other customers.


Astrobotic Technology's lander caught a ride on a brand new rocket, United Launch Alliance’s Vulcan. The Vulcan streaked through the Florida predawn sky, putting the spacecraft on a roundabout route to the moon that should culminate with an attempted landing on Feb. 23.


The Pittsburgh company aims to be the first private business to successfully land on the moon, something only four countries have accomplished. But a Houston company also has a lander ready to fly, and could beat it to the lunar surface, taking a more direct path.


“First to launch. First to land is TBD" — to be determined, said Astrobotic chief executive John Thornton.


NASA gave the two companies millions to build and fly their own lunar landers. The space agency wants the privately owned landers to scope out the place before astronauts arrive while delivering NASA tech and science experiments as well as odds and ends for other customers.


Astrobotic's contract for the Peregrine lander: $108 million.


The last time the U.S. launched a moon-landing mission was in December 1972.


Apollo 17’s Gene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt became the 11th and 12th men to walk on the moon, closing out an era that has remained NASA’s pinnacle.


The space agency’s new Artemis program — named after the twin sister of Apollo in Greek mythology — looks to return astronauts to the moon’s surface within the next few years.


First will be a lunar fly-around with four astronauts, possibly before the end of the year.


Highlighting Monday's moonshot was the long-delayed initial test flight of the Vulcan rocket from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.


The 61-meter rocket is essentially an upgraded version of ULA’s hugely successful workhorse Atlas V, which is being phased out along with the company’s Delta IV. Jeff Bezos' rocket company, Blue Origin, provided the Vulcan's two main engines.


The Soviet Union and the U.S. racked up a string of successful moon landings in the 1960s and 70s, before putting touchdowns on pause. China joined the elite club in 2013 and India in 2023. But last year also saw landers from Russia and a private Japanese company slam into the moon. An Israeli nonprofit crashed in 2019.


Next month, SpaceX will provide the lift for a lander from Intuitive Machines. The Nova-C lander's more direct one-week route could see both spacecraft attempting to land within days or even hours of one another.


The hourlong descent to the lunar surface — by far the biggest challenge — will be “exciting, nail-biting, terrifying all at once,” said Thornton.


Besides flying experiments for NASA, Astrobotic drummed up its own freight business, packing the 1.9-meter-tall Peregrine lander with everything from a chip of rock from Mount Everest and toy-size cars from Mexico that will catapult to the lunar surface and cruise around, to the ashes and DNA of deceased space enthusiasts, including “Star Trek” creator Gene Roddenberry and science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke.


The Navajo Nation recently sought to have the launch delayed because of the human remains, saying it would be a “profound desecration” of a celestial body revered by Native Americans.


Thornton said the December objections came too late but promised to try to find “a good path forward” with the Navajo for future missions.


One of the spaceflight memorial companies that bought room on the lander, Celestis, said in a statement that no single culture or religion owns the moon and should not be able to veto a mission.


More remains are on the rocket’s upper stage, which, once free of the lander, will indefinitely circle the sun as far out as Mars.


Cargo fares for Peregrine ranged from a few hundred dollars to $1.2 million per kilogram, not nearly enough for Astrobotic to break even. But for this first flight, that's not the point, according to Thornton.


“A lot of people’s dreams and hopes are riding on this,” he said.

## The cooperation between orf virus and Staphylococcus aureus leads to intractable lesions in skin infection

date: 2024-01-08, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology

<p>A large amount of evidence shows that different kinds of microorganisms can jointly cope with environmental pressures including cell hosts. For example, in many cases, it has been found that secondary or mixed infection of animals caused by ORFV (an epitheliophilic Parapoxvirus) and bacteria (such as Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus) shows a mutual aid mode that indirectly leads to the deterioration of the disease. However, the lack of research on the co-pathogenic mechanism, including how to hijack and destroy the cell host in the pathological microenvironment, has hindered the in-depth understanding of the pathogenic process and consequences of this complex infection and the development of clinical treatment methods. Here, we summarized the current strategies of trapping cell hosts together, based on the previously defined ORFV-Host (O-H) system. The opportunistic invasion of <italic>S. aureus</italic> destroyed the delicate dynamic balance of the O-H, thus aggravating tissue damage through bacterial products (mediated by Agr), even causing sepsis or inducing cytokine storms. In fact, the virus products from its adaptive regulatory system (VARS) weaken the immune attacks and block molecular pathways, so that <italic>S. aureus</italic> can settle there more smoothly, and the toxins can penetrate into local tissues more quickly. This paper focuses on the main challenges faced by cell hosts in dealing with mixed infection, which provides a starting point for us to deal with this disease in the future.</p>

## Probiotics for functional constipation in children: an overview of overlapping systematic reviews

date: 2024-01-08, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Background</title><p>This overview of systematic reviews (SRs) and meta-analysis (MAs) aimed to systematically collate, appraise and synthesize evidence of probiotics for functional constipation (FC) in children.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>SRs/MAs of probiotics for FC in children were systematic identified by searching Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, and Web of science. Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews 2 (AMSTAR-2), Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) were unitized by two reviewers independently to assess the methodological quality, reporting quality, and quality of evidence, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Seven SRs/MAs met the eligibility criteria and were included in this study. According to AMSTAR-2, a very low methodological quality assessment was given to the included SRs/MAs due to the limitations of items 2, 4 and 7. For the PRISMA statement, the overall quality of reporting was unsatisfactory due to the lack of reporting on protocol, risk of bias across studies, synthesis of results, and additional analysis. According to GRADE, the quality of evidence for outcomes was rated as very low to moderate.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Probiotics may be beneficial in improving FC in children. Because of limitations and inconsistent conclusions, further rigorous, normative and comprehensive SRs/MAs are needed to provide robust evidence for definitive conclusions.</p></sec>

## Anti-obesity effects by parasitic nematode (Trichinella spiralis) total lysates

date: 2024-01-08, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Background</title><p>Obesity is an inducible factor for the cause of chronic diseases and is described by an increase in the size and number of adipocytes that differentiate from precursor cells (preadipocytes). Parasitic helminths are the strongest natural trigger of type 2 immune system, and several studies have showed that helminth infections are inversely correlated with metabolic syndromes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal findings</title><p>To investigate whether helminth-derived molecules have therapeutic effects on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity, we isolated total lysates from <italic>Trichinella spiralis</italic> muscle larvae. We then checked the anti-obesity effect after intraperitoneal administration and intraoral administration of total lysate from <italic>T. spiralis</italic> muscle larvae in a diet-induced obesity model. <italic>T. spiralis</italic> total lysates protect against obesity by inhibiting the proinflammatory response and/or enhancing M2 macrophages. In addition, we determined the effects of total lysates from <italic>T. spiralis</italic> muscle larvae on anti-obesity activities in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes by investigating the expression levels of key adipogenic regulators, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPα) and adipocyte protein 2 (aP2). Oil Red O staining showed that the total lysates from <italic>T. spiralis</italic> muscle larvae decreased the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes by decreasing the number of lipid droplets. In addition, the production levels of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, IFN-γ and TNF-α were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). <italic>T. spiralis</italic> total lysates decreased intracellular lipid accumulation and suppressed the expression levels of PPARγ, C/EBPα and aP2.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion/Significance</title><p>These results show that <italic>T. spiralis</italic> total lysate significantly suppresses the symptoms of obesity in a diet- induced obesity model and 3T3-L1 cell differentiation and suggest that it has potential for novel anti-obesity therapeutics.</p></sec>

## Unravelling staphylococcal small-colony variants in cardiac implantable electronic device infections: clinical characteristics, management, and genomic insights

date: 2024-01-08, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Objectives</title><p>Staphylococcal small-colony variants (SCVs) are common in cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) infections. This is the first retrospective and multi-case study on CIED infections due to staphylococcal SCVs, aiming to provide a theoretical basis for the clinical management of CIED and device-related infections caused by staphylococcal SCVs.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Ninety patients with culture positive CIED infections were enrolled between 2021 and 2022. We compared the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with and without SCVs and performed genomic studies on SCVs isolates.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Compared to patients without SCVs, those with SCVs had a longer primary pacemaker implantation time and were more likely to have a history of device replacement and infection. They showed upregulated inflammatory indicators, especially higher NEUT% (52.6 vs. 26.8%, <italic>P</italic> = 0.032) and they had longer hospital stays (median 13 vs. 12 days, <italic>P</italic> = 0.012). Comparative genomics analysis was performed on <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> wild-type and SCVs. Some genes were identified, including <italic>aap</italic>, genes encoding adhesin, CHAP domain-containing protein, LPXTG cell wall anchor domain-containing protein, and YSIRK-type signal peptide-containing protein.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Staphylococcal SCVs affect the clinical characteristics of CIED infections. The process of staphylococcal SCVs adherence, biofilm formation, and interaction with neutrophils play a vital role.</p></sec>

## In vitro antibacterial activity of antiretroviral drugs on key commensal bacteria from the human microbiota

date: 2024-01-08, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Antiretroviral therapy has improved life expectancy in HIV-infected patients. However, people living with HIV under antiretroviral therapy are at higher risks of developing chronic complications and acquiring multidrug resistant bacteria than healthy population. These factors have been associated with shifts in gut microbiome composition and immune activation.  It is unclear how antiretroviral drugs affect gut microbiota composition, but it has been observed that antiretroviral treatment is not able to fully restore gut health after HIV infection. Additionally, some antiretroviral drugs have shown antibacterial activity suggesting that these drugs could have a direct impact on the human microbiome composition. </p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We determined the <italic>in vitro</italic> antibacterial activity of 16 antiretroviral drugs against a set of key clinically relevant and human commensal bacterial strains. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Our results demonstrate that 5 antiretroviral drugs have <italic>in vitro</italic> antibacterial activity against gut and vaginal human commensal bacteria. Zidovudine has antibacterial activity against <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>Prevotella bivia</italic>, abacavir against <italic>Gardnerella vaginalis</italic>, efavirenz against <italic>G. vaginalis</italic> and <italic>P. bivia</italic> and bictegravir against <italic>Enterococcus</italic> spp. and <italic>G. vaginalis</italic>. Moreover, we describe for the first time that elvitegravir has antibacterial activity against <italic>G. vaginalis</italic> and <italic>P. bivia</italic> and, most importantly, against vancomycin-resistant <italic>Enterococcus</italic> spp. and methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> strains with MIC values of 4-16 and 4 µg/mL, respectively showing high level of effectiveness against the tested multidrug-resistant bacteria.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Our results underscore that some antiretroviral drugs may influence the human microbiota composition. In addition, we report the potential use of elvitegravir to treat multidrug-resistant Gram-positive bacteria warranting the need of clinical studies to repurpose this antiretroviral drug. </p></sec>

## Chronic blue light-emitting diode exposure harvests gut dysbiosis related to cholesterol dysregulation

date: 2024-01-08, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology

<p>Night shift workers have been associated with circadian dysregulation and metabolic disorders, which are tightly coevolved with gut microbiota. The chronic impacts of light-emitting diode (LED) lighting at night on gut microbiota and serum lipids were investigated. Male C57BL/6 mice were exposed to blue or white LED lighting at Zeitgeber time 13.5-14 (ZT; ZT0 is the onset of “lights on” and ZT12 is the “lights off” onset under 12-hour light, 12-hour dark schedule). After 33 weeks, only the high irradiance (7.2 J/cm<sup>2</sup>) of blue LED light reduced the alpha diversity of gut microbiota. The high irradiance of white LED light and the low irradiance (3.6 J/cm<sup>2</sup>) of both lights did not change microbial alpha diversity. However, the low irradiance, but not the high one, of both blue and white LED illuminations significantly increased serum total cholesterol (TCHO), but not triglyceride (TG). There was no significant difference of microbial abundance between two lights. The ratio of beneficial to harmful bacteria decreased at a low irradiance but increased at a high irradiance of blue light. Notably, this ratio was negatively correlated with serum TCHO but positively correlated with bile acid biosynthesis pathway. Therefore, chronic blue LED lighting at a high irradiance may harvest gut dysbiosis in association with decreased alpha diversity and the ratio of beneficial to harmful bacteria to specifically dysregulates TCHO metabolism in mice. Night shift workers are recommended to be avoid of blue LED lighting for a long and lasting time.</p>

## Real-time detection of Seneca Valley virus by one-tube RPA-CRISPR/Cas12a assay

date: 2024-01-08, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Senecavirus A (SVA) is a highly contagious virus that causes vesicular disease in pigs. At present, laboratory detection methods, such as virus isolation and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), required  precision instruments and qualified personnel, making them unsuitable for point-of-care tests (POCT). Fortunately, the emergence of CRISPR/Cas system has provided new opportunities for fast and efficient pathogen detection.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This study successfully developed a precise and sensitive detection platform for diagnosing SVA by combining the CRISPR system with recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA). </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The minimum detection limit of the assay was 10 copies of the SVA genome.  Meanwhile, the assay demonstrated high specificity. To validate the effectiveness of this system, we tested 85 swine clinical samples and found that the fluorescence method had a 100% coincidence rate compared to RT-qPCR. </p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Overall, the RPA-CRISPR/Cas12a assay established in our study is a highly effective method for detecting SVA and holds great potential for practical applications in the resource-limited settings.</p></sec>

## Ghrelin regulating liver activity and its potential effects on liver fibrosis and Echinococcosis

date: 2024-01-08, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology

<p>Ghrelin widely exists in the central nervous system and peripheral organs, and has biological activities such as maintaining energy homeostasis, regulating lipid metabolism, cell proliferation, immune response, gastrointestinal physiological activities, cognition, memory, circadian rhythm and reward effects. In many benign liver diseases, it may play a hepatoprotective role against steatosis, chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis, and improve liver cell autophagy and immune response to improve disease progression. However, the role of Ghrelin in liver <italic>Echinococcosis</italic> is currently unclear. This review systematically summarizes the molecular mechanisms by which Ghrelin regulates liver growth metabolism, immune-inflammation, fibrogenesis, proliferation and apoptosis, as well as its protective effects in liver fibrosis diseases, and further proposes the role of Ghrelin in liver <italic>Echinococcosis</italic> infection. During the infectious process, it may promote the parasitism and survival of parasites on the host by improving the immune-inflammatory microenvironment and fibrosis state, thereby accelerating disease progression. However, there is currently a lack of targeted <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> experimental evidence for this viewpoint.</p>

## Multiple cross displacement amplification combined with nanoparticle-based lateral flow biosensor for rapid and sensitive detection of Epstein-Barr virus

date: 2024-01-08, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a highly dangerous virus that is globally prevalent and closely linked to the development of nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC). Plasma EBV DNA analysis is an effective strategy for early detection, prognostication and monitoring of treatment response of NPC.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Here, we present a novel molecular diagnostic technique termed EBV-MCDA-LFB, which integrates multiple cross displacement amplification (MCDA) with nanoparticle-based lateral flow (LFB) to enable simple, rapid and specific detection of EBV. In the EBV-MCDA-LFB system, a set of 10 primers was designed for rapidly amplifying the highly conserved tandem repeat BamHI-W region of the EBV genome. Subsequently, the LFB facilitate direct assay reading, eliminating the use of extra instruments and reagents.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The outcomes showed that the 65°C within 40 minutes was the optimal reaction setting for the EBV-MCDA system. The sensitivity of EBV-MCDA-LFB assay reached 7 copies per reaction when using EBV recombinant plasmid, and it showed 100% specificity without any cross-reactivity with other pathogens. The feasibility of the EBV-MCDA-LFB method for EBV detection was successfully validated by 49 clinical plasma samples. The complete detection process, consisting of rapid template extraction (15 minutes), MCDA reaction (65°C for 40 minutes), and LFB result reading (2 minutes), can be finalized within a 60-minutes duration.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>EBV-MCDA-LFB assay designed here is a fast, extremely sensitive and specific technique for detecting EBV in field and at the point-of-care (PoC), which is especially beneficial for countries and regions with a high prevalence of the disease and limited economic resources.</p></sec>

## The critical role of neutrophil-endothelial cell interactions in sepsis: new synergistic approaches employing organ-on-chip, omics, immune cell phenotyping and in silico modeling to identify new therapeutics

date: 2024-01-08, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology

<p>Sepsis is a global health concern accounting for more than 1 in 5 deaths worldwide. Sepsis is now defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Sepsis can develop from bacterial (gram negative or gram positive), fungal or viral (such as COVID) infections. However, therapeutics developed in animal models and traditional <italic>in vitro</italic> sepsis models have had little success in clinical trials, as these models have failed to fully replicate the underlying pathophysiology and heterogeneity of the disease. The current understanding is that the host response to sepsis is highly diverse among patients, and this heterogeneity impacts immune function and response to infection. Phenotyping immune function and classifying sepsis patients into specific endotypes is needed to develop a personalized treatment approach. Neutrophil-endothelium interactions play a critical role in sepsis progression, and increased neutrophil influx and endothelial barrier disruption have important roles in the early course of organ damage. Understanding the mechanism of neutrophil-endothelium interactions and how immune function impacts this interaction can help us better manage the disease and lead to the discovery of new diagnostic and prognosis tools for effective treatments. In this review, we will discuss the latest research exploring how <italic>in silico</italic> modeling of a synergistic combination of new organ-on-chip models incorporating human cells/tissue, omics analysis and clinical data from sepsis patients will allow us to identify relevant signaling pathways and characterize specific immune phenotypes in patients. Emerging technologies such as machine learning can then be leveraged to identify druggable therapeutic targets and relate them to immune phenotypes and underlying infectious agents. This synergistic approach can lead to the development of new therapeutics and the identification of FDA approved drugs that can be repurposed for the treatment of sepsis.</p>
