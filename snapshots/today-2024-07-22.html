<p>date: 2024-07-22, from: San Jose Mercury News</p>
<p>When the government released the June Consumer Price Index, there was
a sigh of relief among economists. The overall CPI rate actually slid by
0.1 percent in June from May. For the 12 months through June, CPI
increased by 3% and the core rate, which strips out food and energy, was
up 3.3%, the smallest 12-month increase since […]</p>

<p>The recent assassination attempt on former U.S. President Donald
Trump should be a “wake-up call” on gun violence, says U.S. Surgeon
General Dr. Vivek Murthy, who recently declared firearm violence in
America a “public health crisis.” But disagreements on how to resolve
the matter prevail. VOA’s Veronica Balderas Iglesias has more.</p>

“ChatGPT doesn’t summarise. When you ask ChatGPT to summarise this text,

<p>
The distinction is indeed important: it’s akin to making an easy reader
version, albeit one with the odd error here and there.
</p>
<p>
This is particularly important for newsrooms and product teams that are
looking at AI to generate takeaways from articles. There’s a huge chance
that it’ll miss the main, most pertinent points, and simply shorten the
text in the way it sees fit.

<h2 id="us-japan-to-hold-security-talks-on-july-28">US, Japan to hold
security talks on July 28</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>TOKYO — Foreign and defense ministers from Japan and the United
States will hold security talks in Japan on July 28 in an effort to push
forward what U.S. President Joe Biden called a historic upgrade in the
alliance.</p>
<p>The so-called “2+2” talks will cover extended deterrence, a term used
to describe the U.S. commitment to use its nuclear and conventional
forces to deter attacks on allies, Japan’s foreign ministry said on
Monday.</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will also hold a bilateral
meeting with his Japanese counterpart Yoko Kamikawa during the visit,
while U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin will hold three-way talks with
his counterparts from Japan and South Korea.</p>
<p>Tokyo and Washington in April announced a series of initiatives to
strengthen their ties in what Biden called the most significant upgrade
since the U.S.-Japan alliance, which was first signed in 1951,
began.</p>
<p>These include efforts to deepen cooperation between defense
industries and upgrade military command structures to improve
coordination, as both countries look to deter regional threats they see
emanating from China, North Korea and Russia.</p>
<p>“These historic 2+2 talks will cement our shift from a focus on
Alliance protection to one of Alliance projection,” U.S. ambassador to
Japan Rahm Emanuel said.</p>
<p>“Through a transformation of the command structure of the United
States forces in Japan, aligned with Japan’s own groundbreaking launch
of its joint command next March, the Alliance will be ready and equipped
to respond to the security challenges of the Indo-Pacific for decades to
come.”</p>

id="heat-related-deaths-in-texas-climb-after-hurricane-left-millions-without-power">Heat-related
deaths in Texas climb after hurricane left millions without power</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Spring, Texas — As the temperature soared in the Houston-area home
Janet Jarrett shared with her sister after losing electricity in
Hurricane Beryl, she did everything she could to keep her 64-year-old
sibling cool.</p>
<p>But on their fourth day without power, she awoke to hear Pamela
Jarrett, who used a wheelchair and relied on a feeding tube, gasping for
breath. Paramedics were called but she was pronounced dead at the
hospital, with the medical examiner saying her death was caused by the
heat.</p>
<p>“It’s so hard to know that she’s gone right now because this wasn’t
supposed to happen to her,” Janet Jarrett said.</p>
<p>Almost two weeks after Beryl hit, heat-related deaths during the
prolonged power outages have pushed the number of storm-related
fatalities to at least 23 in Texas.</p>
<p>The combination of searing summer heat and residents unable to power
up air conditioning in the days after the Category 1 storm made landfall
on July 8 resulted in increasingly dangerous conditions for some in
America’s fourth-largest city.</p>
<p>Beryl knocked out electricity to nearly 3 million homes and
businesses at the height of the outages, which lasted days or much
longer, and hospitals reported a spike in heat-related illnesses.</p>
<p>Power finally was restored to most by last week, after over a week of
widespread outages. The slow pace in the Houston area put the region’s
electric provider, CenterPoint Energy, under mounting scrutiny over
whether it was sufficiently prepared.</p>
<p>While it may be weeks or even years before the full human toll of the
storm in Texas is known, understanding that number helps plan for the
future, experts say.</p>
<p>What is known about the deaths so far?</p>
<p>Just after the storm hit, bringing high winds and flooding, the
deaths included people killed by falling trees and people who drowned
when their vehicles became submerged in floodwaters. In the days after
the storm passed, deaths included people who fell while cutting limbs on
damaged trees and heat-related deaths.</p>
<p>Half of the deaths attributed to the storm in Harris County, where
Houston is located, were heat related, according to the Harris County
Institute of Forensic Sciences.</p>
<p>Jarrett, who has cared for her sister since she was injured in an
attack six years ago, said her “sassy” sister had done everything from
owning a vintage shop in Harlem, New York, to working as an artist.</p>
<p>“She had a big personality,” Jarrett said, adding that her sister had
been in good health before they lost electricity at their Spring
home.</p>
<p>When will a complete death toll be known?</p>
<p>With power outages and cleanup efforts still ongoing, the death toll
likely will continue to climb.</p>
<p>Officials are still working to determine if some deaths that have
already occurred should be considered storm related. But even when those
numbers come in, getting a clear picture of the storm’s toll could take
much more time.</p>
<p>Lara Anton, a spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health
Services, which uses death certificate data to identify storm-related
deaths, estimated that it may not be until the end of July before they
have even a preliminary count.</p>
<p>In the state’s vital statistics system, there is a prompt to indicate
if the death was storm related and medical certifiers are asked to send
additional information on how the death was related to the storm, Anton
said.</p>
<p>Experts say that while a count of storm-related fatalities compiled
from death certificates is useful, an analysis of excess deaths that
occurred during and after the storm can give a more complete picture of
the toll. For that, researchers compare the number of people who died in
that period to how many would have been expected to die under normal
conditions.</p>
<p>The excess death analysis helps count deaths that might have been
overlooked, said Dr. Lynn Goldman, dean of the Milken Institute School
of Public Health at George Washington University.</p>
<p>What do different toll numbers tell us?</p>
<p>Both the approach of counting the death certificates and calculating
the excess deaths have their own benefits when it comes to storms, said
Gregory Wellenius, director of the Boston University School of Public
Health’s Center for Climate and Health.</p>
<p>The excess death analysis gives a better estimate of the total number
of people killed, so it’s useful for public health and emergency
management planning in addition to assessing the impact of climate
change, he said.</p>
<p>But it “doesn’t tell you who,” he said, and understanding the
individual circumstances of storm deaths is important in helping to show
what puts individual people at risk.</p>
<p>“If I just tell you 200 people died, it doesn’t tell you that story
of what went wrong for these people, which teaches us something about
what hopefully can we do better to prepare or help people prepare in the
future,” Wellenius said.</p>

<li>A quick look at Kamala Harris’ climate record</li>
</ol>
</h3>
<p>
President Biden announced yesterday he will not run for re-election and
endorsed his vice president, Kamala Harris, for the 2024 Democratic
ticket. Tributes from his colleagues poured in quickly, with many
hailing Biden’s decision as brave and patriotic, and others recounting
his accomplishments during three-and-a-half years in office, including
his climate record. “Biden will leave office with easily the strongest
climate record of any president — and one of the stronger environmental
records, generally, in decades,”
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/joe-biden-dropping-out-legacy?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--8inwIOiEDv86c6WefdLIeMjPf6isQnmF6mPaYb1ckHnkfZZUf4FUuHvG0GYUYEucke2Dy" rel="noopener" target="_self">wrote
Heatmap’s Robinson Meyer</a>. Biden signed the largest investment in
clean energy and decarbonization in American history, oversaw a
revitalization of American industrial strategy, passed the bipartisan
infrastructure law and CHIPS and Science Act (both of which funded or
expanded climate-friendly programs), and moved quickly to regulate
greenhouse gas emissions using executive authority. “Democrats had tried
and failed for 30 years to pass a climate law through the Senate,” Meyer
said. “Biden succeeded.”

her own climate agenda as a presidential candidate in 2019 was more
ambitious even than Biden’s. She called for a carbon tax, a ban on
fracking and fossil fuel leases on public lands, and $10 trillion in
spending to curb greenhouse gas emissions. She also was an early
co-sponsor of the Green New Deal. She supported a pollution fee, a
crackdown on fossil fuel companies, and as a top attorney in California,

California, and sits on the site of an old gas station. It’s the first

Netanyahu walks political tightrope on Washington trip following Biden’s
exit from race</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Jerusalem — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu left for
Washington on Monday, leaving behind a brutal war to make a politically
precarious speech before the U.S. Congress at a time of great
uncertainty following Joe Biden’s withdrawal from the presidential
race.</p>
<p>With efforts ongoing to bring about a cease-fire between Israel and
Hamas, rising concerns about the war spreading to Lebanon and Yemen, and
the U.S. in the midst of a dizzying election campaign, Netanyahu’s
speech has the potential to cause disarray on both sides of the
ocean.</p>
<p>The risks only increased with Biden’s decision Sunday to drop out of
the race for president, especially since the choice of a replacement
Democratic nominee — and the potential next American leader — are still
up in the air.</p>
<p>Before stepping on the plane, Netanyahu said he would emphasize the
theme of Israel’s bipartisanship in his speech and said Israel would
remain America’s key ally in the Middle East “regardless who the
American people choose as their next president.”</p>
<p>“In this time of war and uncertainty, it’s important that Israel’s
enemies know that America and Israel stand together,” he said, adding
that he will meet Biden during his trip and thank him for his support
for Israel.</p>
<p>A person familiar with Biden’s schedule confirmed Sunday that the
president will host Netanyahu at the White House. The official, speaking
on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment
publicly, said the exact timing of the meeting has not been established
because Biden is recovering from COVID-19.</p>
<p>Netanyahu is scheduled to address Congress on Wednesday. He is also
expected to meet with Vice President Kamala Harris, who is seeking the
Democratic Party’s presidential nomination.</p>
<p>Netanyahu will deliver his congressional address with an eye on
several audiences: his ultranationalist governing partners, the key to
his political survival; the Biden administration, which Netanyahu counts
on for diplomatic and military support; and Donald Trump’s Republican
Party, which could offer Netanyahu a reset in relations if he is
reelected in November.</p>
<p>His words risk angering any one of those constituencies, which the
Israeli leader cannot afford if he hopes to hold on to his tenuous grip
on power.</p>
<p>“There are a few land mines and pitfalls on this trip,” Eytan Gilboa,
an expert on U.S.-Israel relations at Israel’s Bar-Ilan University, said
before Biden’s withdrawal. “He is thought of as a political wizard who
knows how to escape from traps. I am not sure he still knows how to do
that.”</p>
<p>It is Netanyahu’s fourth speech to Congress — more than any other
world leader. During his address, his far-right governing partners will
want to hear his resolve to continue the war and topple Hamas.</p>
<p>The Biden administration will look for progress toward the latest
U.S.-backed cease-fire proposal and details on a postwar vision.
Republicans hope Netanyahu besmirches Biden and bolsters the GOP’s
hoped-for perception as Israel’s stalwart supporter.</p>
<p>The war, which was sparked by Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on southern
Israel, has tested Israel’s ties with its top ally as never before.</p>
<p>The Biden administration has stood staunchly beside Israel. But it
has grown increasingly alarmed about the conduct of the Israeli
military, the continued difficulties of getting humanitarian aid into
Gaza, especially after the short-lived U.S. military pier off Gaza
coast, as well as Israel’s lack of postwar plans and the harm to
civilians in Gaza. Similar concerns will likely persist if Americans
elect a new Democratic president.</p>
<p>Biden earlier this year froze the delivery of certain bombs over
fears they would be used in Israel’s incursion into the southern Gaza
city of Rafah, which at the time sheltered more than half of Gaza’s
population of 2.3 million.</p>
<p>The U.S. abstained from a United Nations Security Council vote in
March that called for a cease-fire and the release of hostages but did
not link the two. Netanyahu called the decision a “retreat” from a
“principled position” by Israel’s ally.</p>
<p>Biden has had to walk a fine line of his own. He has faced harsh
criticism from progressive Democrats and many Arab Americans. Even
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, the highest-ranking elected U.S.
Jewish official, lambasted Netanyahu in March for his handling of the
war.</p>
<p>Some Democrats will likely demonstrate their anger toward Biden and
Netanyahu by skipping Wednesday’s speech. Netanyahu is also likely to be
hounded by pro-Palestinian activists during his trip.</p>
<p>The last time Netanyahu spoke to Congress in 2015 was at the
invitation of the Republican Party. The trip drove Israeli-American
politics deep into the partisan divide as Netanyahu railed against
then-President Barack Obama’s Iran nuclear deal.</p>
<p>Netanyahu has not shied away from making Israel a partisan issue.
With his nationalist conservative ideology, he has been perceived as
throwing his support behind Republican candidates in the past, rankling
Democrats and Israelis who want to keep the U.S.-Israel relationship
bipartisan.</p>
<p>It’s unclear if he will meet Trump. If there is a meeting, it could
expose Netanyahu to accusations that he is once again taking sides. But
if he doesn’t meet with Trump, the former president could feel
slighted.</p>
<p>The speech also offers Netanyahu opportunity. He will be able to show
Israelis that despite the tensions with the Biden administration, U.S.
support for him remains ironclad.</p>
<p>“He wants the Israeli public to believe that he is very much still
very welcome in the United States. And this shows that the American
people are with him,” said David Makovsky, director of the program on
Arab-Israel Relations at the Washington Institute for Near East
Policy.</p>
<p>For critics of Netanyahu, that embrace is unacceptable and grants
legitimacy to a deeply polarizing leader whose public support has
plummeted. Netanyahu faces widespread protests and calls to resign over
the failures of Oct. 7 and his handling of the war.</p>
<p>In a letter to Congress, 500 Israeli writers, scholars and public
figures expressed their dismay over the invitation to Netanyahu, saying
he will use the platform to advance misguided policies that align with
his far-right governing partners.</p>
<p>“His only interest is preserving his own power,” they wrote. “Does
the United States Congress wish to support such a model of cynical and
manipulative leadership in these times?”</p>
<p>Israeli media reported that Netanyahu will be joined by rescued
hostage Noa Argamani and her father. But for many of the families of
hostages held in Gaza, the trip is an affront.</p>
<p>“This is not the time for trips,” Ayelet Levy Shachar, whose daughter
Naama was kidnapped on Oct. 7, told reporters.</p>
<p>“Netanyahu: First a deal, then you can travel.”</p>

id="bidens-decision-to-bow-out-goes-viral-on-chinese-social-media">Biden’s
decision to bow out goes viral on Chinese social media</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Taipei, Taiwan — The news of U.S. President Joe Biden’s decision to
end his reelection campaign quickly became a trending topic on Chinese
social media platforms Monday.</p>
<p>In a statement released on Sunday afternoon U.S. time, Biden
announced his decision to not run for a second term and vowed to focus
his energy on fulfilling his duties as president.</p>
<p>So far, the Chinese government has remained tight lipped about the
decision. At a regular press briefing on Monday, Foreign Ministry
spokesperson Mao Ning declined to comment, and said the “presidential
election is an internal affair of the United States.”</p>
<p>Online, however, the entry “Biden withdrew from the election”
attracted more than 400 million views on the China’s microblogging site
Weibo and tens of thousands of comments.</p>
<p>Other topics went viral as well. Topics such as “Zelensky respects
Biden’s decision to withdraw from the election,” “Harris praised Biden,”
and “Trump thinks Harris is easier to beat” were all in the top 20
searches Monday on Weibo, which is similar to the social media site
X.</p>
<p>Several major media outlets in China, including the state-run Xinhua
News Agency, People’s Daily, and the Global Times, covered Biden’s
withdrawal from the race extensively.</p>
<p>Many Chinese netizens expressed the view that Biden’s decision
ensures that Trump will win the election in November while some said
things have suddenly changed for Ukraine, referring to Trump’s repeated
criticism of U.S. military aid to Ukraine. “Tonight will be a sleepless
night for Zelensky,” Chinese netizen “Yo-Huai-To-Bi” from northeastern
Shandong province wrote on Weibo.</p>
<p>Other Chinese netizens argued that the United States will continue to
compete with China and try to contain the country’s rise regardless of
who wins the election in November.</p>
<p>“We shouldn’t be too happy about this news because Trump will likely
continue Biden’s strategies toward China and he might roll out harsher
measures,” a netizen called “BIGTREE33” from China’s southeastern Fujian
Province wrote on Weibo.</p>
<p>Some Chinese commentators said the Democratic Party will have very
little chance of winning the presidential election in November without
Biden.</p>
<p>“No faction in the Democratic Party can rebuild a campaign that can
challenge Trump within a short time, so after Biden withdrew from the
race, the Democrats will return to a very divided situation,” Jia Min,
an affiliated researcher at Shanghai Development Research Foundation,
told Shanghai Morning News in a video.</p>
<p>Hu Xijin, the former editor-in-chief of China’s state-run tabloid
Global Times, wrote on X that whoever becomes the Democratic Party’s
presidential candidate will make little difference to the presidential
race in November.</p>
<p>“Because Trump’s personality is so outstanding, American voters are
now divided into two groups: Trump lovers &amp; Trump haters,” he wrote,
adding that November’s election will be a choice between Trump or
“anyone.”</p>
<p>Harris vs. Trump</p>
<p>After Biden endorsed U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris to be the
presidential candidate for the Democratic Party and Harris vowed to win
the Democratic Party’s nomination, the entry “Could Harris defeat Trump”
quickly became a trending topic on Weibo.</p>
<p>More Chinese netizens seem to believe Harris has very little chance
of beating Trump in the presidential election. “If Hillary Clinton
couldn’t beat Trump back then, Harris would just be a joke,” a netizen
named “Falling in Love with Jia-tze-hu” from Shandong Province wrote on
Weibo.</p>
<p>Some Chinese analysts said Harris lacks the experience and
achievement to serve as the next president of the United States.</p>
<p>“Looking at Harris’s overall track record, her performance as vice
president has not been particularly outstanding, and she has not
achieved satisfactory results,” Sun Chenghao, a fellow at the Center for
International Security and Strategy at Tsinghua University, told Chinese
online media outlet the Paper.</p>
<p>Beijing-Washington rivalry to continue</p>
<p>While Biden’s decision to pull out of the presidential race will
likely shape the development of the U.S. presidential election, some
analysts say the Chinese government may think that these developments
won’t change the fact that Beijing and Washington are engaged in an
intense competition.</p>
<p>“Beijing’s view is that the U.S. and China are in this rivalry, and
it will continue no matter who runs in the election,” Ian Chong, a
political scientist at the National University of Singapore, told VOA by
phone.</p>
<p>Other experts say the Chinese government may not have clear
expectations about how different candidates may focus on issues related
to China.</p>
<p>“Despite being the vice president, Harris hasn’t said that much on
foreign policy, especially compared to the known track records of both
Biden and Trump,” said Timothy Rich, a political scientist at Western
Kentucky University.</p>
<p>“So, a known Trump, however erratic, may be easier [for Beijing] to
prepare for than Harris,” he told VOA in a written response.</p>
<p>If November’s election becomes a race between Trump and Harris, Rich
thinks a potential Trump victory would mean more tariffs on Chinese
commodities and a more explicit view of trade as a zero-sum game. A
potential Harris administration, he adds, may adopt a more nuanced
approach to address Washington’s trade relationship with China.</p>
<p>On the issue of Taiwan, Rich said the fact that the Republican
National Committee excluded Taiwan from the party platform may suggest
Trump is “thinking transactionally about how cutting off support for
Taiwan could lead to some big trade agreement with China.”</p>
<p>“In contrast, I can’t see a Harris administration deviating on
support for Taiwan much from her predecessor,” he told VOA.</p>

id="next-generation-us-jet-fighter-program-may-get-hit-by-budget-woes">Next-generation
US jet fighter program may get hit by budget woes</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The U.S. Air Force’s ambitious next-generation fighter
jet program, envisioned as a revolutionary leap in technology, could
become less ambitious as budget pressure, competing priorities and
changing goals compel a rethink, defense officials and industry
executives said. </p>
<p>Initially conceived as a “family of systems” centered around a
sixth-generation fighter jet, the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD)
program is meant to replace the F-22 Raptor and give the United States
the most powerful weaponry in the sky well into the mid-21st
century. </p>
<p>When it was first proposed, expectations were high, including an
unmatched stealth capability to keep it invisible from even the most
sophisticated radar, laser weapons and onboard artificial intelligence
to process masses of data coming from the latest in sensor technology.
 </p>
<p>However, sources said the current development budget of $28.5 billion
over five years ending in 2029 could be spread out over more time or
scaled-back as the Pentagon searches for a cost-effective solution. </p>
<p>Sources briefed on the Air Force’s internal budget deliberations said
the anticipated 2026 fiscal-year NGAD budget of $3.1 billion would be
slashed as funding shrinks, with one source adding that diminishing
funds could stretch development by two more years. </p>
<p>While it is unclear how much the overall program will cost, it could
eventually total well over $100 billion if 200 aircraft are produced,
including initial costs - plus maintenance and upgrades over time. There
are currently 185 F-22s in service — the plane NGAD is meant to
replace. </p>
<p>The Air Force is also reviewing the concept for the jet - perhaps
moving to a larger single-engine jet, from what is believed to be a
two-engine design, or even shifting more funding to a less expensive
unmanned drone to best address future air superiority needs given the
potential budget cuts, industry experts said. </p>
<p>“NGAD was conceived before a number of things: before the threat
became so severe, before CCAs [drone program] were introduced into the
equation and before we had some issues with affordability that we are
currently facing,” Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall said on Saturday at
Britain’s Royal International Air Tattoo, the world’s largest military
air show. </p>
<p>“Before we commit to the 2026 budget, we want to be sure we are on
the right path,” he added on a program that will be a popular talking
point at the Farnborough International Airshow this week. </p>
<p>The shift in focus comes as the Air Force grapples with substantial
cost overruns in several vital, and expensive, programs. For example,
its Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) program, which is
set to replace the aging Minuteman III missiles, has ballooned 81% over
budget, to around $141 billion. </p>
<p>Budget pressure has forced the Air Force to reassess its spending
priorities across various modernization efforts which also include
increasing production of the new B-21 bomber made by Northrop
GrummanNOC.N. </p>
<p>U.S. aerospace and defense companies Lockheed Martin LMT.N and Boeing
BA.N have responded to the Air Force’s request for proposal for the NGAD
system, sources told Reuters. </p>
<p>While defense firms are not exactly desperate for orders with
conflicts in Ukraine and Israel driving already-strong demand, NGAD was
one of several potentially giant programs many hoped would feed the
bottom line in the years ahead. </p>
<p>An Air Force spokesperson told Reuters the department is currently
building its fiscal 2026 budget which will be released early next year.
Representatives for Boeing did not return requests for comment. Lockheed
would not comment on NGAD. </p>
<p>“The part that seems to be getting stalled and re-evaluated is the
air vehicle itself, the central platform,” said J.J. Gertler, a senior
analyst at aerospace and defense analysis firm the Teal Group. </p>
<p>“The Air Force is now making sure that that’s what they actually want
and possibly changing their mind,” he added. </p>
<p>Possible new configurations might be shifting to a single engine for
the jet to save on up-front cost and long-term maintenance. Twin-engine
jets are much more expensive to buy and operate, but they are more
dependable and faster, therefore more deadly in a dogfight than their
single-engine foes. </p>
<p>Another key component emerging from this restructuring is the
possibility of shifting funds toward the unmanned fighter drone known as
the Collaborative Combat Aircraft initiative. </p>
<p>Development of the less expensive drone platforms, designed to
operate alongside the main jet, does not face budget changes.</p>

id="democratic-officials-donors-back-harris-after-biden-exits-us-presidential-race">Democratic
officials, donors back Harris after Biden exits US presidential
race</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Momentum appeared to be on the side of U.S. Vice
President Kamala Harris on Monday, as a groundswell of Democratic
lawmakers, governors and financial donors expressed their support for
her to be the party’s presidential nominee in the November election
after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race.</p>
<p>Biden followed his surprise announcement Sunday by issuing his own
endorsement of Harris to face former President Donald Trump, the
Republican Party’s nominee.</p>
<p>Harris, who is 59, quickly announced that she would seek the
nomination. She was a senator from the country’s most populous state,
California, when Biden picked her in 2020 as his running mate after
Harris’ challenge to Biden and other primary contenders fell apart.</p>
<p>Her approval ratings in national surveys have largely reflected
Biden’s, but some surveys of likely voters show Harris faring slightly
better than he does against Trump.  In a few, she has polled ahead of
Trump.</p>
<p>Harris said in a statement that Biden, by withdrawing from the race
against Trump, “is doing what he has done throughout his life of
service: putting the American people and our country above everything
else.”</p>
<p>“I will do everything in my power to unite the Democratic Party – and
unite our nation – to defeat Donald Trump,” she said. “We have 107 days
until Election Day. Together, we will fight. And together, we will
win.”</p>
<p>Early Monday, the Harris campaign said it had collected $49.6 million
in small-dollar donations since Biden withdrew and she announced her
candidacy. That stood in contrast to weeks of waning support for Biden,
particularly among top donors, following his stumbling performance in a
late June debate against Trump. </p>
<p>The Association of State Democratic Committees said in a statement
that an “overwhelming majority” of state party leaders backed Harris as
the party’s nominee, with several abstaining for procedural reasons.</p>
<p>Sunday’s outpouring of support for Harris also included at least one
Biden Cabinet member, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who said
he would do “all I can” to help elect Harris.</p>
<p>If Harris is accepted by the party to replace Biden, she would be the
first Black woman and South Asian major party presidential nominee in
the 248-year history of the United States.</p>
<p>Biden’s announcement Sunday followed a rising chorus within the
Democratic Party urging him to “pass the torch” amid his declining
national poll numbers and concerns raised by his debate performance.
During the debate, the 81-year-old president often appeared to lose his
train of thought, failed to forcefully press his case against the
78-year-old Trump or defend his own tenure in the White House.</p>
<p>Biden persevered, insisting he would not quit the race unless “the
Lord Almighty” asked him to or if he was shown polling numbers that he
could not beat Trump a second time or advised by his doctors he was not
physically able to continue.</p>
<p>But on Sunday, he said in a statement, “I believe it is in the best
interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus
solely on fulfilling my duties as president for the remainder of my
term,” which ends in six months in January.</p>
<p>Biden said he plans to address the nation about his decision later
this week.</p>
<p>Trump responded to the announcement by assailing both Biden and
Harris.</p>
<p>“Crooked Joe Biden was not fit to run for President, and is certainly
not fit to serve - And never was!” Trump posted on social media, adding
that Harris was just as bad as Biden.</p>
<p>“Harris will be easier to beat than Joe Biden would have been,” Trump
told CNN.</p>
<p>Many Republicans reacted by calling for Biden to resign as
president.</p>
<p>House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson, who is second in the
presidential line of succession behind Harris, called on Biden to step
down, claiming if he is unfit to keep his candidacy alive for another
four-year term, he is also unfit to remain as president until
Jan. 20.</p>
<p>If Biden were to resign, Harris would immediately be sworn in as the
country’s 47th president, at least until the inauguration for the victor
in the November 5 election.  </p>
<p>Names of other prominent Democrats have been floated as potential
candidates other than Harris, including several state governors:
Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, J.B.
Pritzker of Illinois and Gavin Newsom of California. Shapiro and Newsom
endorsed Harris on Sunday.</p>
<p>It was not immediately known who Harris might pick as her
vice-presidential running mate.    </p>
<p>Former president Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, who served as
Secretary of State under President Barack Obama but lost the 2016
presidential contest to Trump, endorsed Harris in a statement.  </p>
<p>Obama, whom Biden served with as vice president for eight years,
thanked Biden for his patriotism in leaving the race, but did not
endorse Harris or any other Democrat to be the party’s presidential
nominee.     </p>
<p>Media reports in the hours following Biden’s withdrawal quoted
sources close to Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, now an
independent, saying he was considering rejoining the Democratic Party to
try to replace the president at the top of the party’s ticket.</p>
<p>There are two ways for Democrats to replace Biden as the party’s
standard-bearer.</p>
<p>One would be a virtual vote among delegates to the Democratic
National Convention next month in Chicago that would lock in a new
nominee in early August. Chances are this process would favor Harris,
avoiding conflict at the Aug. 19-22 convention in front of a national
television audience.</p>
<p>The other way Democrats could pick a new nominee would be an “open”
convention in which several candidates, including Harris, would seek the
presidential nomination, a scenario the party hasn’t experienced since
1968, when President Lyndon Johnson dropped his plans to run for
reelection in face of widespread opposition to his handling of America’s
war against North Vietnam.</p>
<p>Some Democrats are suggesting the party quickly hold a “mini primary”
to allow Harris and anyone else to openly compete.</p>
<p>Biden has no public events on his schedule for Monday. The White
House said details on his schedule for the rest of the week will be
forthcoming.</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is headed to Washington to
address Congress on Wednesday and said he also plans to meet with
Biden. </p>

of migrants in new caravan headed for US border</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CIUDAD HIDALGO, Mexico — Hundreds of migrants from around a dozen
countries left from Mexico’s southern border on foot Sunday, as they
attempt to make it to the U.S. border.</p>
<p>Some of the members of the group said they hoped to make it to the
U.S. border before elections are held in November, because they fear
that if Donald Trump wins, he will follow through on a promise to close
the border to asylum-seekers.</p>
<p>“We are running the risk that permits (to cross the border) might be
blocked,” said Miguel Salazar, a migrant from El Salvador. He feared
that a new Trump administration might stop granting appointments to
migrants through CBP One, an app used by asylum-seekers to enter the
U.S. legally — by getting appointments at U.S. border posts, where they
make their cases to officials.</p>
<p>The app only works once migrants reach Mexico City, or states in
northern Mexico.</p>
<p>“Everyone wants to use that route” said Salazar, 37.</p>
<p>The group left Sunday from the southern Mexican town of Ciudad
Hidalgo, which is next to a river that marks Mexico’s border with
Guatemala.</p>
<p>Some said they had been waiting in Ciudad Hidalgo for weeks for
permits to travel to towns further to the north.</p>
<p>Migrants trying to pass through Mexico in recent years have organized
large groups to try to reduce the risk of being attacked by gangs or
stopped by Mexican immigration officials as they travel. But the
caravans tend to break up in southern Mexico, as people get tired of
walking for hundreds of kilometers.</p>
<p>Recently, Mexico has also made it more difficult for migrants to
reach the U.S. border on buses and trains.</p>
<p>Travel permits are rarely awarded to migrants who enter the country
without visas and thousands of migrants have been detained by
immigration officers at checkpoints in the center and north of Mexico
and bused back to towns deep in the south of the country.</p>
<p>Oswaldo Reyna, a 55-year-old Cuban migrant, crossed from Guatemala
into Mexico 45 days ago and waited in Ciudad Hidalgo to join the new
caravan announced on social media.</p>
<p>He criticized Trump’s recent comments about migrants and how they are
trying to “invade” the United States.</p>
<p>“We are not delinquents,” he said. “We are hard-working people who
have left our country to get ahead in life, because in our homeland we
are suffering from many needs.”</p>

id="bidens-decision-to-drop-out-crystalized-sunday-his-staff-knew-one-minute-before-the-public-did">Biden’s
decision to drop out crystalized Sunday; his staff knew one minute
before the public did</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — At 1:45 p.m. Sunday, President Joe Biden’s senior staff
was notified that he was stepping away from the 2024 race. At 1:46 p.m.,
that message was made public.</p>
<p>It was never Biden’s intention to leave the race: Up until he decided
to step aside Sunday, he was all in.</p>
<p>His campaign was planning fundraisers and events and setting up
travel over the next few weeks. But even as Biden was publicly dug in
and insisting he was staying in the race, he was quietly reflecting on
the disaster of the past few weeks, on the past three years of his
presidency and on the scope of his half-century career in politics.</p>
<p>In the end, it was the president’s decision alone, and he made it
quietly, from his vacation home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, sick with
COVID-19, the first lady with him as he talked it through with a small
circle of people who have been with him for decades.</p>
<p>“This has got to be one of the hardest decisions he’s ever made,”
said Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., the president’s closest ally in Congress,
who spoke with him Sunday. “I know he wanted to fight and keep going and
show that he could beat Donald Trump again, but as he heard more and
more input, I think he was wrestling with what would be the best for the
country,” Coons said in an interview with The Associated Press.</p>
<p>This story is based on interviews with more than a dozen people
familiar with the president’s thinking over the past few weeks, days and
hours as he made his decision. They spoke to The Associated Press on
condition of anonymity to talk about private discussions.</p>
<p>Deciding to leave the race</p>
<p>It wasn’t until Saturday evening that Biden began to come to the
conclusion that he would not run for reelection. He started writing a
letter to the American people.</p>
<p>Biden had been off the campaign trail for a few days, isolated
because of COVID-19, when it all started to deeply sink in — his
worsening chances of being able to defeat Donald Trump with so much of
his party in open rebellion, seeking to push him out of the race — not
to mention the persistent voter concerns about his age that were only
exacerbated by the catastrophic debate.</p>
<p>Biden was at his beach home with some of his and Jill Biden’s closest
aides: chief strategist Mike Donilon, counselor to the president Steve
Ricchetti, White House deputy chief of staff Annie Tomasini, and Anthony
Bernal, senior adviser to the first lady.</p>
<p>By Sunday, his decision crystalized. He spoke multiple times with
Vice President Kamala Harris, whom he would endorse. He informed White
House chief of staff Jeff Zients, and his longtime aide and campaign
chairwoman Jen O’Malley Dillon.</p>
<p>A small group of senior advisers from both the campaign and the White
House were assembled for the 1:45 p.m. call to relay Biden’s decision,
while his campaign staff released the social media announcement one
minute later.</p>
<p>“It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your
President. And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I
believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to
stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for
the remainder of my term,” Biden wrote.</p>
<p>Just about a half-hour later came his public vote of support for
Harris. It was a carefully choreographed strategy meant to give the
president’s initial statement full weight, and to put a period on the
moment before launching forward into the next step.</p>
<p>“Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to
be the nominee of our party this year,” Biden said in another post on X.
“Democrats — it’s time to come together and beat Trump.”</p>
<p>About that debate</p>
<p>It’s not like things had been going great before the June 27 debate.
In an August 2023 poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public
Affairs Research, fully 77% of U.S. adults said Biden was too old to be
effective for four more years. Not only did 89% of Republicans say that,
but so did 69% of Democrats.</p>
<p>And it hadn’t gotten any better by April, when more than half of U.S.
adults thought Biden’s presidency hurt the country on issues like the
cost of living and immigration.</p>
<p>But Biden had insisted — to himself, to the nation, to his supporters
— that he would be able to bring voters around if he got out there, told
people about his record, explained it to them. Talked to them. Looked
them in the eye.</p>
<p>He had a lifetime of experience that told him that if he stuck to it,
he’d overcome. His campaign was so confident, in fact, that they
arranged to go around the Commission on Presidential Debates to set up a
series of faceoffs with Trump under a new set of rules.</p>
<p>That produced the June 27 debate that set Biden’s downfall in motion.
Biden gave nonsensical answers, trailed off mid-sentence and appeared to
stare blankly in front of an audience of 51 million people. Perhaps most
distressing to other Democrats, Biden didn’t go after Trump’s myriad
falsehoods about his involvement in the violence around the insurrection
on Jan. 6, 2021, abortion rights or immigration.</p>
<p>Biden and his team blamed the night on so many different things. He
had a cold. He was jet-lagged. He needed to get more sleep. That night
opened the door for his party to push him out.</p>
<p>A slow acceptance</p>
<p>Publicly and privately Biden was fighting to stay in the race. He was
working to convince voters that he was up for the task for another four
years. He was frustrated by the Democrats coming out publicly against
him, but even angrier about the leaks and anonymous sources relaying how
even former President Barack Obama and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi
were working to get him to drop out.</p>
<p>It looked like he’d won out a couple times; the chorus of naysayers
seemed to die down. He had some well-received speeches mixed with so-so
TV interviews and a day featuring an extended news conference in which
he displayed a nuanced grasp of policy but also committed a few
gasp-inducing gaffes.</p>
<p>But the doubts didn’t go away.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer eventually invited top Biden
staff to a meeting on July 11 to talk about their concerns. It didn’t go
well. Senators expressed their concerns, and almost none of them said
they had confidence in the president. But even afterward, Schumer was
worried it wasn’t getting to Biden.</p>
<p>Following the meeting, Schumer called Democratic House Leader Hakeem
Jeffries, former Speaker Nancy Pelosi and former President Obama.
Schumer decided that day to request a meeting with Biden.</p>
<p>At a July 13 meeting in Rehoboth, Schumer told Biden he was there out
of love and affection. And he delivered a personal appeal focused on
Biden’s legacy, the country’s future and the impact the top of the
ticket could have on congressional races — and how that could
potentially affect the Supreme Court. That same day came the attempted
assassination of Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Schumer told the president he didn’t expect him to make an immediate
decision, but he hoped Biden would think about what he said, according
to a person familiar with the conversation.</p>
<p>Biden responded, “I need another week,” and the two men hugged.</p>
<p>Sunday’s decision</p>
<p>It was full steam ahead until Biden pulled the emergency brake.</p>
<p>The president had lost his voice, but he was recovering well and his
doctor had sent an update to the public shortly before 1 p.m. on his
condition. His small circle decided to post the statement on X on
Sunday, rather than let it leak out for days before he was prepared to
address the nation, which he is expected to do sometime early this
week.</p>
<p>Much of his campaign was blindsided, and it was clear by how little
had changed after he dropped out. For hours after the announcement,
Biden’s campaign website reflected that he was still running and
KamalaHarris.com still redirected to Biden’s page.</p>
<p>Even Harris’ statement announcing her intent to succeed Biden was
sent from “Joe Biden for President.”</p>
<p>After the public announcement, Zients held a senior staff call, sent
out an email and spoke with Biden’s cabinet. The president was also
making personal calls.</p>
<p>“Team — I wanted to make sure you saw the attached letter from the
President,” Zients wrote in the staff email. “I could not be more proud
to work for President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, and the
American people — alongside all of you, the best White House team in
history. There’s so much more to do — and as President Biden says,
‘there is nothing America can’t do — when we do it together.’”</p>
<p>Vermont Sen. Peter Welch, a Democrat who had called for Biden to bow
out, was gardening with his wife when the news broke, and said he was
momentarily “stunned.” Senators texted each other questioning if it was
really happening.</p>
<p>Democratic Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal was at an event in his
state, and there was spontaneous applause when it was announced to the
crowd that Biden wouldn’t run, he said.</p>
<p>There was a sense of excitement and energy in the crowd “that has
been completely lacking,” Blumenthal said.</p>
<p>“It was also, let’s be blunt, a sense of relief,” he said. “And a
sense of reverence for Joe Biden.”</p>
<p>By Sunday evening, Biden for President had formally changed to Harris
for President.</p>
<p>O’Malley Dillon told campaign staff their jobs were safe, because the
operation was shifting to a campaign for Harris.</p>

I didn’t post about it — what is there to say that hasn’t been said
elsewhere? — but former President Trump was almost shot last week. The
would-be assassin’s motive is muddy (he was a Republican), but the
bullet or a sliver of glass narrowly missed him, taking a nip out of his
ear. He’s been using it as political ammunition ever since, and the
entire RNC, which started the following day, was in essence a stage show
about toxic masculinity, featuring guests like Kid Rock, Hulk Hogan (who
tore off his shirt to reveal another shirt with the Trump / Vance logo
on it), and the CEO of the Ultimate Fighting Championship. At one point,
during a Michigan rally following the event, Trump pulled a guy out of
the crowd to remark how well-defined his arms were. His campaign, his
policies, his demeanor are <em>Idiocracy</em> come to life.

As for his Vice Presidential candidate, I’d love to see a lot more
people talking about JD Vance’s support for Curtis Yarvin, who believes
in the reinstatement of slavery, in replacing the democratically elected
government with a CEO king, and that Hitler was acting in self defense.
</p>
<p>
I have many differences with Joe Biden: most notably, his failure to
take a strong stand against the ongoing slaughter in Gaza, and his
war-faring foreign policy history throughout his career. But he’s not
Donald Trump and he’s not JD Vance. Domestically, the Biden Presidency
undoubtedly had some strong progressive successes over the last four
years, in ways that genuinely helped vulnerable Americans. I voted for
him in 2020. And certainly, were he the Democratic nominee, I would have
voted for him again.
</p>
<p>
It seems almost certain that the Democratic nominee will be Kamala
Harris. If that turns out to be the case, I’ll absolutely vote for her.
With enthusiasm.
</p>
<p>
What I hope is that she can paint a picture of the world she wants to
create. Biden never quite achieved that for me: he even memorably said
to donors, that “nothing would fundamentally change” if he was elected.
America needs change; it needs equity; it needs a renewed compassion,
stronger safety nets, a leg up for people who need it, and a mentality
that nobody should fall through the cracks. A focus on strong
communities and bonds based on empathy rather than breaks for the rich
and military might. A focus on a democratic, inclusive world and not
just an American one. Beyond just not being Trump and not being Vance,
those are my hopes for a Harris Presidency.

TRAC</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-21, from: Advent of Computing</p>
<p>
Have you ever formed a bad first impression? Way back when I formed a
hasty impression of this language called TRAC. It’s been called a
proto-esoteric language, and for good reason. It’s outlandish, complex,
and confounding. But, after the urging of some listeners, I’ve decided
to give TRAC a second look. What I’ve found is, perhaps, more confusing
than I ever imagined. This episode we are looking at the wild history of
TRAC, how it actually pioneered some good ideas, and why it feels so
alien.

<p class="drop-caps">
What is so striking, in immediate retrospect, about many of Joe Biden’s
accomplishments as president is how many of them depended on
<em><em>him</em></em>.
</p>
<p>
Democrats had tried and failed for 30 years to pass a climate law
through the Senate. Biden succeeded.
</p>
<p>
Now Biden, the 46th president of the United States, is dropping out of
the presidential race. He announced the news today on the social network
X, endorsing his vice president, Kamala Harris, who will now presumably
take over the party’s nomination.
</p>
<p>
Biden has not done everything climate activists wanted. He has not
declared a “climate emergency,” a legally controversial maneuver that
could let him order individual companies to change their behavior and
spend funds without Congress’s approval. And he has seemed flummoxed by
how to sell his decarbonization program to the public without ignoring
the economy’s ongoing dependence on fossil fuels. During his presidency,
American oil and natural gas production has hit an all-time high, and
the country has become the world’s largest fossil fuel exporter. Biden
has not really advertised that fact, which would be popular, but he
hasn’t run away from it, either — America’s achievement of energy
dominance has sat in an odd, under-noticed spot in the discourse.
</p>
<p>
But Biden will leave office with easily the strongest climate record of
any president — and one of the stronger environmental records,
generally, in decades. Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act, the
largest investment in clean energy and decarbonization in American
history. It is the first U.S. law that ties clean electricity incentives
directly to the country’s carbon emissions, ensuring that tax credits
will remain in place until the country hits its goals. But more broadly,
he oversaw a revitalization of American industrial strategy, passing the
bipartisan infrastructure law and CHIPS and Science Act, which both
funded or expanded climate-friendly programs.
</p>
<p>
His administration also moved quickly to regulate greenhouse gas
emissions using executive authority. In the past three years, the
Environmental Protection Agency has begun to restrict heat-trapping
emissions from power plants, cars, trucks, and oil and gas
infrastructure. He also paused the government’s approval of new permits
for liquified natural gas export terminals, although that pause
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/judge-overturns-bidens-lng-export-pause/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has
since been overturned</u></a> by a federal court.
</p>
<p>
Could another president have accomplished as much? Even though the
Inflation Reduction Act is
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/inflation-reduction-act-jesse-jenkins" target="_self"><u>largely
the product of a Democratic Senate</u></a> — of lawmakers drafting text
on the issues that they know best — making that into law required
Biden’s personal credibility with the labor movement and the party’s
cadre of older, working class voters. It is difficult, if not impossible
to imagine Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia — one of the chamber’s
decisive votes in 2022 — negotiating and voting for the IRA without
Biden’s persona. Biden could talk about the law’s aims to revitalize
labor, could cast infrastructure and clean energy as jobs programs,
without projecting the condescension or cross-class voyeurism that
younger Democrats might have summoned.
</p>
<p>
His sense — which seemed to be held too by his most successful chief of
staff, Ron Klain — that politics is above all a game of coalition
management meant he was able to keep the fragile Democratic Party in
line through the process. Biden often seemed, as his biographer Franklin
Foer, put it, a man from a different time — “the last politician.”
</p>
<p>
But a tension between policy success and political setback has also
defined Biden’s presidency.<strong> </strong>Again and again, he would
pull off some difficult domestic policy — and then fail to communicate
it to voters. He was foiled, in part, by the high inflation that plagued
the U.S. economy throughout the first years of his term. But as his
presidency went on, Biden also seemed to struggle with communication
specifically. He never successfully sold voters — and specifically young
people — on the value of his administration or on his climate
accomplishments.
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/biden-climate-legacy" target="_blank">As
I wrote earlier this month</a>, even voters who say they prioritize
climate change told pollsters that they knew little about the IRA. That
was and remains a tremendous missed opportunity, especially since —
regardless of what voters say or know — a Trump administration and a
Republican majority would gleefully gut the IRA if given the chance.
</p>
<p>
Now the Democratic party and its politicians must pick up where Biden’s
team leaves off and defend his domestic climate accomplishments. Many of
the IRA’s investments — and the ultimate fate of the EPA’s crackdown on
greenhouse gas pollution — will be left to Harris to fight for. Whether
she can convince voters that they are worth supporting will determine
the long term success of America’s most important decarbonization policy
— and whether it, or any climate policy, can survive the country’s
deteriorating politics.

id="openbsd-gets-hardware-accelerated-video-decodingencoding">OpenBSD
gets hardware accelerated video decoding/encoding</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-21, from: OS News</p>
<p>Only yesterday, I mentioned one of the main reasons I decided to
switch back to Fedora from OpenBSD were performance issues – and one of
them was definitely the lack of hardware acceleration for video
decoding/encoding. The lack of such technology means that
decoding/encoding video is done using the processor, which is far less
efficient than letting your GPU do it – which results in performance
issues like stuttering and tearing, as well as a drastic reduction in
battery life. Well, that’s changed now. Thanks to the work of, well,
many, a major commit has added hardware accelerated video
decoding/encoding to OpenBSD. Hardware accelerated video decode/encode
(VA-API) support is beginning to land in #OpenBSD -current. libva has
been integrated into xenocara with the Intel userland drivers in the
ports tree. AMD requires Mesa support, hence the inclusion in base. A
number of ports will be adjusted to enable VA-API support over time, as
they are tested. ↫ Bryan Steele This is great news, and a major
improvement for OpenBSD and the community. Apparently, performance in
Firefox is excellent, and with simply watching video on YouTube being
something a lot of people do with their computers – especially laptops –
anyone using OpenBSD is going to benefit immensely from this work.</p>

<p>date: 2024-07-21, from: OS News</p>
<p>NetWare 386 or 3.0 was a very limited release, with very few copies
sold before it was superseded by newer versions. As such, it was
considered lost to time, since it was only sold to large corporations –
for a massive almost 8000 dollar price tag – who obviously didn’t care
about software preservation. There are no original disks left, but a
recent “warez” release has made the software available once again. As
always, pirates save the day.</p>

<h2 id="managing-classic-mac-os-resources-in-resedit">Managing Classic
Mac OS resources in ResEdit</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-21, from: OS News</p>
<p>The Macintosh was intended to be different in many ways. One of them
was its file system, which was designed for each file to consist of two
forks, one a regular data fork as in normal file systems, the other a
structured database of resources, the resource fork. Resources came to
be used to store a lot of standard structured data, such as the
specifications for and contents of alerts and dialogs, menus,
collections of text strings, keyboard definitions and layouts, icons,
windows, fonts, and chunks of code to be used by apps. You could extend
the types of resource supported by means of a template, itself stored as
a resource, so developers could define new resource types appropriate to
their own apps. ↫ Howard Oakley And using ResEdit, a tool developed by
Apple, you could manipulate the various resources to your heart’s
content. I never used the classic Mac OS when it was current, and only
play with it as a retro platform every now and then, so I ever used
ResEdit when it was the cool thing to do. Looking back, though, and
learning more about it, it seems like just another awesome capability
that Apple lost along the way towards modern Apple. Perhaps I should
load up on my old Macs and see with my own eyes what I can do with
ResEdit.</p>

<h2 id="thoughts-on-digital-communities">Thoughts on digital
communities</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-21, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;I had some interesting exchanges recently with &lt;a href=&quot;https://kevquirk.com&quot;&gt;Kev&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ruk.ca&quot;&gt;Peter&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://renecoignard.com&quot;&gt;René&lt;/a&gt;, all touching on the topic of communities, both on and offline. Communities, especially here in the digital space, are something I’m very interested in. It’s something I find myself thinking about often and I constantly have ideas for things I should try. But let me ask you a more fundamental question: what even is a community? Always useful to grab a definition as a starting point:&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>
A community is a social unit (a group of living things) with a shared
socially significant characteristic, such as place, set of norms,
culture, religion, values, customs, or identity. Communities may share a
sense of place situated in a given geographical area (e.g. a country,
village, town, or neighborhood) or in virtual space through
communication platforms.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I think this is a good definition. We begin by making it clear that we
need <em>“living things”</em> to have a community and considering the
weird AI phase we’re going through that’s probably worth stating. So
bots are out, humans are in.
</p>
<p>
We then move on to what makes a community a community: the sharing of
some <em>“socially significant characteristic”</em>. In the context of
online communities, I like to refer to that as the <em>“what are we here
for”</em> characteristic. At a fundamental level, members of a community
have to share the same motivations to be there in the first place. If
those motivations start to diverge then things quickly fall apart.
</p>
<p>
It’s like politics. You can have different ideas on how things should be
done—and we can debate those forever—but we have to agree that, at a
fundamental, level we do want to move in the same general direction:
make the place better. The devil’s in the details and we can discuss
what better means but there has to be at least some common ground in the
overall direction. Without that, things will fall apart. And things
might fall apart even with a common ground!
</p>
<p>
Back to online communities. I have my place here on the web. I’m happy
with my site, I’m happy with my projects. But I keep thinking that maybe
there’s something else that can be done, that I should be doing. I keep
bouncing around various digital places—mostly forums—and I have yet to
find one that truly feels like the place where I want to be. Some move
too fast, some don’t move at all. Some are narrowly focused on one
thing, others are not focused at all and it’s pure chaos. And I don’t
blame those places or the people who tried to create them. Creating a
community is hard. Figuring out the right mixture of people is
complicated. Figuring out the right amount of people is complicated.
Group dynamics are never easy to navigate.
</p>
<p>
I’d love to know what you think about all this. Are there online places
where you feel at home? Is there something you’re missing? Do you even
care about all this? <a href="mailto:hello@manuelmoreale.com">Let me

<h2 id="google-url-shortener-links-will-no-longer-be-available">Google
URL Shortener links will no longer be available</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-21, from: OS News</p>
<p>In 2018, we announced the deprecation and transition of Google URL
Shortener because of the changes we’ve seen in how people find content
on the internet, and the number of new popular URL shortening services
that emerged in that time. This meant that we no longer accepted new
URLs to shorten but that we would continue serving existing URLs. Today,
the time has come to turn off the serving portion of Google URL
Shortener. Please read on below to understand more about how this will
impact you if you’re using Google URL Shortener. ↫ Sumit Chandel and
Eldhose Mathokkil Babu It should cost Google nothing to keep this
running for as long as Google exists, and yet, this, too, has to be
killed off and buried in the Google Graveyard. We’ll be running into
non-resolving Google URL Shortener links for decades to come, both on
large, popular websites a well as on obscure forums and small websites.
You’ll find a solution to some obscure problem a decade from now, but
the links you need will be useless, and you’ll rightfully curse Google
for being so utterly petty. Relying on anything Google that isn’t
directly serving its main business – ads – is a recipe for disaster, and
will cause headaches down the line. Things like Gmail, YouTube, and
Android are most likely fine, but anything consumer-focused is really a
lottery.</p>
