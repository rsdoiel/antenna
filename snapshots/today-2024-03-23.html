id="chinese-pastor-released-after-7-years-in-prison-unable-to-get-id">Chinese
Pastor Released After 7 Years in Prison, Unable to Get ID</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>beijing — Unable to buy a train ticket, or even see a doctor at a
hospital, a Chinese pastor found that his even after release from
prison, he is not quite free. </p>
<p>The Rev. John Sanqiang Cao was arrested and sentenced to seven years
in prison while coming back from a missionary trip in Myanmar. Now back
in his hometown of Changsha in southern Hunan province, he is without
any legal documentation in his country, unable to access even the most
basic services without Chinese identification. </p>
<p>“I told them I’m a second-(class) Chinese citizen, I cannot do this,
I cannot do that,” Cao in an interview with The Associated Press. “I’m
released, I’m a free citizen, why should there be so many restrictions
upon me?” </p>
<p>Cao, who was born and raised in Changsha, had dedicated his life to
spreading Christianity in China, where the religion is strictly
regulated. He had studied in the U.S., married an American woman and
started a family, but said he felt a calling to go back to his home
country and spread the faith. </p>
<p>It’s a risky mission. Christianity in China is allowed only in
state-sponsored churches, where the ruling Communist Party decides how
Scripture should be interpreted. Anything else, including clandestine
“house” churches and unofficial Bible schools, is considered illegal,
though it was once tolerated by local officials. </p>
<p>Cao was undeterred, citing the courage of Chinese Christians he had
met who spent time in prison for their faith. During his years in China,
he said he had set up some 50 Bible study schools across the
country. </p>
<p>In the years leading up to his arrest, he had started bringing
Chinese missionaries to parts of northern Myanmar that had been impacted
by the country’s civil war. They focused on relief work, campaigning
against drug use, and setting up schools in areas bordering China. </p>
<p>It was in coming back from one of these crossings that he was
detained in 2017. He was sentenced to seven years on a charge of
“organizing others to illegally cross the border,” which is usually
reserved for human traffickers. </p>
<p>His family and supporters advocated for Cao’s sentence to be reduced,
but to no avail. Cao was a prisoner of conscience, according to the
federal U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, which also
called for his freedom. </p>
<p>After completing his sentence, Cao is no longer behind bars. But he
is facing another major obstacle. </p>
<p>He said that police who came to his mother’s house in 2006 took away
her “hukou” registration book, which had also included Cao. </p>
<p>Every child born in China is registered in the hukou, which is an
identification system through which social benefits are allocated by
geography. Later in life, the hukou is needed to apply for a national ID
card, which is used in everything from getting a phone number to public
health insurance. </p>
<p>According to Cao, police said they would help his mother update the
hukou. It was only later that he found out in updating her registration
that they removed his name. </p>
<p>Cao never took American citizenship because of his calling, spending
his time between the two countries. He had kept his U.S. permanent
residency throughout this time, though he says that’s not accepted as an
ID in China. </p>
<p>He was traveling on his Chinese passport. Though he noted that he no
longer had the hukou registration, he did not realize how serious the
problem was until much later. </p>
<p>In prison, his Chinese passport had expired, he said, and he could
not renew it. </p>
<p>Cao said he has been to the police station many times since his
release and had even hired a lawyer. So far, he said police had not
given him a satisfactory answer as to why his records no longer
exist. </p>
<p>A police officer at the Dingwangtai police station in Changsha, where
Cao’s hukou registration is supposed to be, said he did not know how to
address Cao’s claims. “Even if he went to prison, he should still have a
hukou,” he told the AP. The officer refused to give his name because he
wasn’t authorized to talk to the media. </p>
<p>Cao’s two adult sons were able to visit him this month, spending two
weeks with their father. Cao said he wants to join them and his wife in
the U.S., though it’s unclear how he can do that. </p>
<p>“I moved from a smaller prison … to come to a bigger prison,” he
said.</p>

Crew Members Die During Holland America Cruise Ship ‘Incident’</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>FORT LAUDERDALE, Florida — Two crew members on a Holland America
cruise ship died during an “incident” in the ship’s engineering space,
the cruise line said. </p>
<p>The unidentified crew members died Friday while the Florida-based
Nieuw Amsterdam was at Half Moon Cay in the Bahamas, Holland America
said in a statement. </p>
<p>Authorities were notified and the cause of the accident is being
investigated, the cruise line said. Crew members were being offered
counseling. </p>
<p>“All of us at Holland America Line are deeply saddened by this
incident and our thoughts and prayers are with our team members’
families at this difficult time,” the statement said. “The safety,
security and welfare of all guests and crew are the company’s absolute
priority.” </p>
<p>The cruise line did not offer any further details about the crew
members. It later said the Bahamas Maritime Authority was leading the
investigation. The ship set sail out of Fort Lauderdale on March 16 for
a seven-night trip.</p>

<h2 id="some-personal-news">Some personal news</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-23, from: OS News</p>
<p>I’ve got two bits of related news that will affect the future of
OSNews. The first bit of news kind of led to the second bit of news. You
don’t have to care much about former, but the latter will be important
for where OSNews will be going from here on out. First, after 14 years,
I’ve effectively quit my job as a translator – I am self-employed so
there’s no dramatic clearing of my desk of being led out by security,
which is probably a little bit of a letdown to some of you. The
translation industry is in the process of collapsing – you know why –
and I’ve been feeling the squeeze for a while now, and I like going out
on my own terms. I’ve known this day would come, and I’m not sad about
it. My motto: it is what it is. Of course, this meant I had to think of
what to do next. Well, I have decided to work on OSNews full-time. This
is risky, scary, and I’m absolutely terrified of what this will mean.
Right now, my OSNews income – ads plus Patreon – does not even remotely
come close to what I earned as a translator, and as any translator will
tell you, translating isn’t exactly a cornucopia either. This means I’ve
got some serious work ahead of me to change that. After talking things
over with David, OSNews’ owner who takes care of the
commercial/advertisement side, we’ve already taken a few steps. First,
we’ve switched hosting providers and saved considerably on our hosting
costs in the process. Second, David changed advertising partners to one
that will most likely yield us some better rates, but since I don’t know
much about that side of OSNews – as it should be – I can’t comment much
on it. There are two main ways in which I can increase OSNews’ revenue,
and that is by growing our readership, and by giving people more reasons
to become a Patreon, make individual donations, or buy our merch. In
other words, you can expect more original articles so that people will
want to keep coming back, and possibly support me financially because
they like what I do. A third avenue for revenue I’m exploring is
sponsorships – this is a longer-term project, and I’m approaching and
talking to several (tech) companies about this. If you happen to work
for a company who would be a good fit for an OSNews weekly sponsorship,
feel free to contact me for more information. The end goal: have OSNews
be entirely funded by readers and sponsors, and remove all regular
advertising. This all sounds great, but there is a dark side to this
news, too. If all of this fails, if I am unable to attract more readers
and make my work for OSNews financially sustainable, I’ll have to find
work elsewhere – and that would mean the end of OSNews. I’m not trying
to be alarmist or scare you; I just want to be as honest and realistic
as possible about where we stand. Anyway, this is a big deal for me.
I’ve really only ever had one job, and that’s being a translator, a job
I am trained for with two university degrees to show for it. My only
other job was a teenage thing where I worked at a hardware store (think
hammers and screws, not computers) for eight years. I don’t like taking
risks with these sorts of matters, so I’m absolutely terrified, and
while I believe there’s a sustainable income hiding in this ol’ website,
it’s not always clear how to get at it. Anyway, want to become a
Patreon? Or a sponsor? Pretty please? Now would be kind of a really good
time to do so.</p>

id="arrests-for-illegal-border-crossings-up-in-february-among-lowest-of-biden-term">Arrests
for Illegal Border Crossings Up in February, Among Lowest of Biden
Term</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The number of arrests for illegally crossing the U.S.
southern border with Mexico nudged upward February over the previous
month. But at a time when immigration is increasingly a concern for
voters, the numbers were still among the lowest of Joe Biden’s
presidency. </p>
<p>According to figures from Customs and Border Protection, Border
Patrol agents made 140,644 arrests of people attempting to enter the
country between the legal border crossing points during February. </p>
<p>The figures are part of a range of data related to immigration, trade
and fentanyl seizures that is released monthly by CBP. The
immigration-related figures are a closely watched metric at a time of
intense political scrutiny over who is entering the country and whether
the Biden administration has a handle on the issue. </p>
<p>Republicans have charged that Biden’s policies have encouraged
migrants to attempt to come to the U.S. and that the border is out of
control. The Biden administration counters that Republicans failed to
work with Democrats to fund a key border security bill and argues that
what is happening on the southern border is part of a worldwide
phenomenon of more people fleeing their homes to seek safety. </p>
<p>The numbers come after a December that saw the Border Patrol tally
249,785 arrests — a record that increased tensions over immigration —
before the numbers plunged in January to 124,220. </p>
<p>Officials have credited enforcement efforts by Mexico as well as
seasonal fluctuations that affect when and where migrants attempt to
cross the border for the drop from December to January and
February. </p>
<p>Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said during a February
29 trip to Brownsville, Texas, with Biden that the “primary reason is
the enhanced enforcement efforts on the part of the Mexican government.”
But he said encounters remained up in Arizona in part because Sonora,
which is the Mexican state directly south of Arizona, is difficult to
patrol. </p>
<p>In February, the Tucson sector in Arizona was by far the busiest
region for migrant crossings between the ports of entry, followed by San
Diego and El Paso, Texas. </p>
<p>Separately, 42,100 migrants used an app called CBP One to schedule an
appointment to present themselves at an official border crossing point
to seek entry into the United States. </p>
<p>The app has been a key part of the Biden administration’s efforts to
reduce chaos at the border by encouraging migrants to wait for an
appointment instead of wading through the river or trekking across the
desert and seeking Border Patrol agents to turn themselves in. </p>
<p>The administration has also allowed 30,000 people a month into the
country from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela using the
administration’s humanitarian parole authority. The migrants must have a
financial sponsor in the U.S. and fly into an American airport.
According to the data released Friday, 386,000 people from those four
countries have been admitted to the country since that program was
announced in January 2023.</p>

self-explanatory. Jonathan Glazer’s profoundly subtle and disturbing
film, The Zone of Interest, no sooner won an Oscar for Best
International Feature than its director delivered an apology for his
Jewishness so grovelling in its emotional simplicity it would have made
the angels – of any religion – weep.</p>

<h2 id="growth-is-a-mind-cancer">Growth is a mind cancer</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-23, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;I&#39;m following with somewhat vague interest the various legal battles Apple is currently involved in. Reading their response to the EU&#39;s DMA makes me sad. Not for the company itself. I honestly could not care less about the company. Nor for the people who run that company. I&#39;m sad because the pursuit of endless growth is such a mind cancer. It consumes and distracts everyone. If you&#39;re an artisan, creating amazing objects is your end goal. Ideally, you want those objects to last forever. And if they don&#39;t, you want to do such an amazing job that once something is broken beyond repair, people will come to you again and ask you to make something new, rather than buying from someone else.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
Apple makes amazing products. I bought the laptop I’m typing this 9
years ago. It still works fine. Sure, it’s slow compared to my new
machine but I can use it to do calls and write blog posts. And that’s
great. I love it. I was happy to give Apple my money back in 2015. But
you know who’s not happy? Apple. Apple is not happy that I bought a
laptop in 2015 that was so good that it is still working fine 9 years
later. And it’s also not happy that I bought a phone more than 4 years
ago that still does all the things I need it to do. Because they need to
make money. More money. There’s no end state here. <em>“More”</em> has
no end state. At some point, a company like Apple will inevitably run
out of people willing to buy their stuff. Because it’s unreasonable to
expect people to upgrade phones, laptops, screens, watches, tablets,
virtual-ski-goggles every damn year. And so what do they do? They move
into services. Music, movies, games, fitness, storage. You name it. But
those also can’t grow forever. Because guess what? There are other
companies out there doing the same.
</p>
<p>
But they can’t stop. They’re a public company. If they’re not growing
enough it means they’re failing. Forget that they make amazing products
that can last decades with no issues. Forget that they’re an almost
3-fucking-trillions dollar company. If they’re not growing enough, stock
goes down and that’s no good. Because remember, there’s no finish line
here. They can’t just be happy with their size. They can’t be happy with
the idea of employing thousands of smart people and creating amazing
products. No, they have to keep growing. And sooner or later, this mind
cancer becomes malignant.
</p>
<p>
Don’t get me wrong, this is not just an Apple issue. It’s an issue with
any big company. It’s an issue with everyone who can’t accept that they
reached their end state.
</p>
<p>
Cory Doctorow famously coined the enshittification term to describe the
sad trend of online services going to shit over time. I don’t think
that’s just an online services issue. It’s a societal issue related to
the pursuit of endless growth. And if you think about it, it’s a deeply
human issue. It’s what happens when you can’t say stop. No matter what
you’re doing, it can be something positive or negative, if you can’t say
stop, bad things will happen. Try to go for a run, and don’t stop. Ever.
Or try to drink water, and don’t stop. Ever.
</p>
<p>
But it’s our fault. Our as a society. We celebrate when Apple becomes
the first trillion-dollar company but we don’t celebrate when someone
says <em>“You know what? I think I have enough”</em>.

<h2 id="us-mega-millions-jackpot-climbs-to-1.1b">US Mega Millions
Jackpot Climbs to $1.1B</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>DES MOINES, Iowa — The Mega Millions jackpot climbed to an estimated
$1.1 billion after no one matched the game’s six numbers Friday night,
continuing a stretch of more than three months without a big
winner. </p>
<p>The numbers drawn were: 3, 8, 31, 35, 44, 16. </p>
<p>The jackpot increased after a drawing for an estimated $977 million
failed to produce a jackpot winner. </p>
<p>No one has won the game’s jackpot since December 8, a string of 30
consecutive drawings without anyone taking home the top prize. That has
enabled the jackpot to slowly grow, week after week. </p>
<p>The $1.1 billion prize is for a sole winner who chooses to be paid
through an annuity over 30 years. Winners almost always opt for a cash
payment, which for the next drawing Tuesday night is an estimated $525.8
million. </p>
<p>A lucky player winning the $1.1 billion jackpot would take home the
eighth largest in U.S. lottery history. </p>
<p>The other U.S. lottery game, Powerball, has grown to an annuity
jackpot of $750 million and a cash payout of $357.3 million. The next
Powerball drawing is scheduled to take place Saturday night.</p>

<h2 id="doctorow-on-the-antitrust-case-against-apple">Doctorow on the
antitrust case against Apple</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-23, from: OS News</p>
<p>The foundational tenet of “the Cult of Mac” is that buying products
from a $3t company makes you a member of an oppressed ethnic minority
and therefore every criticism of that corporation is an ethnic slur.
Call it “Apple exceptionalism” – the idea that Apple, alone among the
Big Tech firms, is virtuous, and therefore its conduct should be
interpreted through that lens of virtue. The wellspring of this virtue
is conveniently nebulous, which allows for endless goal-post shifting by
members of the Cult of Mac when Apple’s sins are made manifest. ↫ Cory
Doctorow An absolutely brilliant response to the DoJ lawsuit from Cory
Doctorow. You notice this “Apple exceptionalism” a lot right now because
of the new laws in the EU and now the lawsuit by the US DoJ. Apple
products being better is posited as a fact, a law of the universe, and
as such, any claims, either through lawsuits or legislation, that Apple
is doing something wrong, illegal, or anticompetitive are by definition
false. Things that, according to them, make Apple products “superior”
can simply not be illegal. You also notice this a lot when it comes to
the existence of Android. People who don’t like being locked in or have
issues with Apple’s behaviour can just switch to Android, right? The
thought that there are real, monetary costs to switching from iOS to
Android – costs driven up by Apple’s very behaviour – is irrelevant to
them, because in the eyes of the tech pundit, everyone’s rich. What
we’ll be discovering over the course of the DoJ lawsuit – a course that
will take us years – is that the general public cares a lot less about
Apple as a company than Apple tech pundits think it does. People have
iPhones not because they love Apple, but because their previous phone
was an iPhone, because of network effects, or a bit of both. I doubt the
average (in this case) American gives a rat’s ass about Apple, and are
much more worried about the fact they have to live paycheck-to-paycheck
in a dysfunctional shell of a democracy while being told the economy is
doing just great.</p>

had my <a href="https://blogroll.social/">blogroll</a> for a couple of
weeks now, and I’ve got it on-screen a lot, as I’m developing another
user interface that has the blogroll in it. This blogroll is much like
the one I had in the 00s, but it’s in motion, and it’s a source of news
and ideas. It’s also doing the thing that Twitter used to do, it lets me
have a way to see what specific people are interested in. I expect more
of that as new people get this kind of blogroll. Right now I’m pretty
much the only one. The next step is getting the blogroll running in
WordPress. And then getting it running on <a href="https://om.co/">Om’s
blog</a> and <a href="https://doc.searls.com/">Doc’s blog</a>, both of
whom have real experience with the art of blogrolling. From that, I
expect to have a better idea of what the editorial UI should look like
for people creating and managing these blogrolls. We’ll iterate until
it’s pretty easy to set up and manage one. Also to be clear, I want it
to run in other platforms, this is not exclusive to WordPress. It’s just
the place where the people are right now, the ones I really want to work
with. But I wouldn’t mind it running in
<a href="https://substack.com/">Substack</a> for example, if there are
any writers there who find this compelling. That would require
cooperation from the company though, their platform as far as I know,
does not support other-party plugins.</p>

stronger’ than imagined: DOJ’s sweeping Apple lawsuit draws expert
praise</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-23, from: OS News</p>
<p>The Department of Justice’s antitrust division has come into its own,
having filed its third tech monopoly lawsuit in four years. The
accumulated experience shows up in the complaint, according to antitrust
experts who spoke with The Verge about the complaint filed Thursday
accusing Apple of violating antitrust law. The DOJ describes a sweeping
arc of behaviors by Apple, arguing that it adds up to a pattern of
illegal monopoly maintenance. Rather than focusing on two or three
illegal acts, the complaint alleges that Apple engages in a pattern of
behaviors that further entrench consumers into their ecosystem and make
it harder to switch, even in the face of high prices and degraded
quality. ↫ Lauren Feiner at The Verge It’s been somewhat entertaining
seeing Apple fanatics claim the complaint is bad, horrible, has no
merit, has no chance in court, and that the DoJ has zero clue what it’s
doing – while actual experts are actually positively surprised by how
the complaint seems better than they expected. I wonder whose judgement
to trust more.</p>

<p>date: 2024-03-23, from: OS News</p>
<p>Federal investigators have ordered Google to provide information on
all viewers of select YouTube videos, according to multiple court orders
obtained by Forbes. Privacy experts from multiple civil rights groups
told Forbes they think the orders are unconstitutional because they
threaten to turn innocent YouTube viewers into criminal suspects. ↫
Thomas Brewster at Forbes United States law enforcement has been asking
Google who watches certain YouTube videos, covering as many as 30,000
people per video. They wanted names, addresses, telephone numbers and
user activity for all Google accounts who had watched a video within a
certain week’s timeframe, and the IP addresses of everyone who watched
the video without a Google account. That’s an absolute crapton of data,
all because they suspected one person of a money-laundering scheme. And
this is just one example. Forbes could not determine if Google complied
with the requests, but it does highlight the dangers of having so much
data on one place.</p>

they could be that third choice and some of their late-model computers
have some impressive innovations. With that preamble over with, let’s
talk about the last Atari computer: the Falcon030. ↫ Paul Lefebvre In my

<p>Picotron is a Fantasy Workstation for making pixelart games,
animations, music, demos and other curiosities. It has a toy operating
system designed to be a cosy creative space, but runs on top of Windows,
MacOS or Linux. Picotron apps can be made with built-in tools, and
shared with other users in a special 256k png cartridge format. ↫
Picotron website Picotron is very similar to PICO-8, but more powerful
and with a few additional features – it’s actually made by the same
people as PICO-8. It also contains a small, ‘toy’ operating system to
serve as a workspace, everything makes use of Lua, and any applications
made with it can be shared using a special 256k PNG cartridge format.
It’s currently in alpha, and cost $11.99, and uses the early Minecraft
model of a one-time purchase for access to all future updates. The FAQ
has tons more information. It looks incredibly neat. I don’t have much
use for it, but I’m interested to see what people with actual skills
will make with it.</p>

When I first got into flying quadcopters (back when they were still
called quadcopters), I would sometimes imagine what it would be like to
shrink myself down Rick Moranis-style and hop aboard. But now thanks to
some enterprising Chinese engineers – or perhaps garage tinkerers – I
don’t have to imagine it anymore. Instead of shrinking the passengers
down, they’ve scaled up the entire drone and added a pilot’s chair.
</p>
<p>
Now the only question is, how brave are you?

<h2 id="biden-signs-1.2-trillion-budget-measure">Biden Signs $1.2
Trillion Budget Measure</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WILMINGTON, Delaware — President Joe Biden on Saturday signed a $1.2
trillion package of spending bills after Congress passed the long
overdue legislation just hours earlier, ending the threat of a partial
government shutdown.</p>
<p>“This agreement represents a compromise, which means neither side got
everything it wanted,” Biden said in a statement. “But it rejects
extreme cuts from House Republicans and expands access to child care,
invests in cancer research, funds mental health and substance use care,
advances American leadership abroad, and provides resources to secure
the border. … That’s good news for the American people.”</p>
<p>It took lawmakers six months into the current budget year to get near
the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by
conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending
cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The
impasse required several short-term spending bills to keep agencies
funded.</p>
<p>The White House said Biden signed the legislation at his home in
Wilmington, Delaware, where he was spending the weekend. It cleared the
Senate by a 74-24 vote shortly after funding expired for the agencies at
midnight.</p>
<p>But the White House sent out a notice shortly after the deadline
announcing that the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown
preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress
would pass the legislation and the Democratic president would sign it
Saturday.</p>
<p>The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the
departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among
others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before
funding expired for those agencies. The second covered the departments
of Defense, Homeland Security and State, as well as other aspects of
general government.</p>
<p>When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the
budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include
programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the
country’s rising debt.</p>
<p>On Ukraine aid, which Biden and his administration have argued was
critical and necessary to help stop Russia’s invasion, the package
provided $300 million under the defense spending umbrella. That funding
is separate from a large assistance package for Ukraine and Israel that
is bogged down on Capitol Hill.</p>
<p>Biden, in his statement, again pressed Congress to pass additional
aid.</p>
<p>“The House must pass the bipartisan national security supplemental to
advance our national security interests. And Congress must pass the
bipartisan border security agreement — the toughest and fairest reforms
in decades — to ensure we have the policies and funding needed to secure
the border. It’s time to get this done.”</p>
<p>A bipartisan border package collapsed last month when Republican
senators scuttled months of negotiations with Democrats on legislation
intended to cut back record numbers of illegal border crossings.</p>
<p>To win over support from Republicans, House of Representatives
Speaker Mike Johnson pointed to some of the spending increases secured
for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their
immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That’s about a 24%
increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more
money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.</p>
<p>Democrats are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start
programs and new child care centers for military families. They also
played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a
$100 million increase for Alzheimer’s research.</p>
<p>The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that
then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy of California worked out with the White
House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended
the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could
continue paying its bills.</p>
<p>Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow
Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed
amendments to the bill. But shortly before midnight, Senate Majority
Leader Chuck Schumer announced a breakthrough.</p>
<p>“It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan
deal. It wasn’t easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it,”
Schumer said.</p>
<p>The House passed the legislation Friday morning by a vote of 286-134,
narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval.</p>
<p>The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over
the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a
vote. Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though most
Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill
“represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.”</p>
<p>In a sign of the conservative frustration, Republican Representative
Marjorie Taylor Greene initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House
began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in
two weeks. It’s the same tool that was used last year to remove
McCarthy.</p>
<p>The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112
voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22
against.</p>

Iconic Washington Cherry Trees To Be Cut Down, Including ‘Stumpy’</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The sun is setting on Stumpy, the gnarled old cherry
tree that has become a social media phenom. This year’s cherry blossom
festivities in Washington will be the last for Stumpy and more than 100
other cherry trees that will be cut down as part of a multiyear
restoration of their Tidal Basin home.</p>
<p>Starting in early summer, crews will begin working to replace the
crumbling seawall around the Tidal Basin, the area around the Jefferson
Memorial with the highest concentration of cherry trees. The work has
been long overdue, as the deterioration, combined with rising sea
levels, has resulted in Potomac waters regularly surging over the
barriers.</p>
<p>The twice-daily floods at high tide not only cover some of the
pedestrian paths, they regularly soak some of the cherry trees’ roots.
The $133 million project to rebuild and reinforce the sea wall will take
about three years, said Mike Litterst, National Park Service
spokesperson for the National Mall.</p>
<p>“It’s certainly going to benefit the visitor experience, and that’s
very important to us,” Litterst said. “But most of all, it’s going to
benefit the cherry trees, who right now are every day, twice a day,
seeing their roots inundated with the brackish water of the Tidal
Basin.” Litterst said entire stretches of trees to the water, as wide as
100 yards, or 90 meters, have been lost and can’t be replaced “until we
fix the underlying cause of what killed them in the first place.”</p>
<p>Stumpy still alive</p>
<p>Stumpy remains alive, if in rough shape.</p>
<p>Plans call for 140 cherry trees — and 300 trees total — to be removed
and turned into mulch. When the project is concluded, 277 cherry trees
will be planted as replacements.</p>
<p>The mulch will protect the roots of surviving trees from foot traffic
and break down over time into nutrient-rich soil, “so it’s a good second
life” for the trees being cut down, Litterst said.</p>
<p>The National Cherry Blossom Festival is widely considered to be the
start of the tourist season in the nation’s capital. Organizers expect
1.5 million people to view the pink and white blossoms this year, the
most since the coronavirus pandemic. Large numbers of cherry blossom
fans have already been drawn to the area as the trees entered peak bloom
on March 17, several days earlier than expected.</p>
<p>Tree becomes social star</p>
<p>Stumpy became a social media star during the pandemic of 2020. Its
legacy has spawned T-shirts, a calendar and a fanbase. News of Stumpy’s
final spring has prompted people to leave flowers and bourbon and had
one Reddit user threatening to chain themselves to the trunk to save the
tree.</p>
<p>The good news on Stumpy is that the National Arboretum plans to take
parts of the tree’s genetic material and create clones, some of which
will eventually be replanted at the Tidal Basin.</p>
<p>The regular flooding at the Tidal Basin — sea levels have risen about
a foot since the the seawall was built in the early 1990s — is just one
of the ways climate change has impacted the cherry trees. Rising global
temperatures and warmer winters have caused peak bloom to creep earlier
in the calendar.</p>
<p>This year’s peak bloom, when 70% of the city’s 3,700 cherry trees
will be flowering, was originally predicted to start around Saturday but
ended up being declared on March 17. By comparison, the 2013 peak bloom
began on April 9.</p>
<p>Leslie Frattaroli, national resources program manager for the Park
Service, told The Associated Press in February that peak bloom could
regularly come in the middle of March by 2050.</p>
<p>“All the timing is off.” he said. “It’s a huge cascading effect.”</p>
<p>Another weather side effect: A mid-March cold snap in the D.C. area
should actually extend this year’s bloom past the predicted April 9
ending.</p>
<p>For visitors and cherry blossom enthusiasts, the annual tradition of
a stroll on the Tidal Basin under the flowers is a core Washington
experience.</p>
<p>Jorge and Sandra Perez make a point of coming every year from
Stafford, Virginia.</p>
<p>“Yes, we have cherry blossoms in my community, but it’s a completely
different feel when you see all of them bloom together,” Sandra Perez
said. “And you can walk through, you know, the trees under it and smell
it. And it’s just, it’s a beautiful view.”</p>
<p>They also came looking for Stumpy, having heard the legend and
knowing this would be its final spring.</p>
<p>“It’s actually beautiful,” Jorge Perez said. “So, it’s sad to see him
leave.”</p>

<p>As expected, Trump’s team has reorganized the Republican National
Committee’s donation system, arranging for maximum donations to go first
to Trump’s presidential campaign, then to Trump’s Save America political
action committee, and finally to the RNC to elect down ballot
candidates. The Save America PAC pays Trump’s legal bills. So far in
2024 it has spent $8.5 million on them. In essence, this new flow means

Says It Struck 3 Houthi Underground Storage Sites in Yemen</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The U.S. military said Friday it had struck three
underground storage facilities used by Yemen’s Houthis, as the
Iran-backed rebels continue to launch attacks on shipping in the Red
Sea.</p>
<p>U.S. forces “conducted self-defense strikes against three Houthi
underground storage facilities in Iranian-backed Houthi
terrorist-controlled areas of Yemen,” Central Command (CENTCOM) said in
a statement.</p>
<p>It said U.S. forces had also “successfully engaged and destroyed four
unmanned aerial vehicles” in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen throughout
Friday, while also registering four anti-ship ballistic missiles fired
by the Houthis toward the Red Sea.</p>
<p>“There were no injuries or damage reported by U.S., coalition, or
commercial ships,” CENTCOM said.</p>
<p>The Houthis began attacking ships in the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea
in November, a campaign they say is intended to signal solidarity with
Palestinians in Gaza.</p>
<p>They have vowed to target Israeli, British and American ships, as
well as vessels heading to Israeli ports, disrupting traffic through the
vital trade route off Yemen’s coasts.</p>
<p>The attacks have sent insurance costs spiraling for vessels
transiting the Red Sea and prompted many shipping firms to take the far
longer passage around the southern tip of Africa instead.</p>

Recent Headlines About Gear Falling Off Planes, Is Flying Safe?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>DALLAS — It has been 15 years since the last fatal crash of a U.S.
airliner, but you would never know that by reading about a torrent of
flight problems in the last three months.</p>
<p>There was a time when things like cracked windshields and minor
engine problems didn’t turn up very often in the news.</p>
<p>That changed in January, when a panel plugging the space reserved for
an unused emergency door blew off an Alaska Airlines jetliner 16,000
feet above Oregon. Pilots landed the Boeing 737 Max safely, but in the
United States, media coverage of the flight quickly overshadowed a
deadly runway crash in Tokyo three days earlier.</p>
<p>And concern about air safety — especially with Boeing planes — has
not let up.</p>
<p>Is flying getting more dangerous?</p>
<p>By the simplest measurement, the answer is no. The last deadly crash
involving a U.S. airliner occurred in February 2009, an unprecedented
streak of safety. There were 9.6 million flights last year.</p>
<p>The lack of fatal crashes does not fully capture the state of safety,
however. In the past 15 months, a spate of close calls caught the
attention of regulators and travelers.</p>
<p>Another measure is the number of times pilots broadcast an emergency
call to air traffic controllers. Flightradar24, a popular tracking site,
just compiled the numbers. The site’s data show such calls rising since
mid-January but remaining below levels seen during much of 2023.</p>
<p>Emergency calls also are an imperfect gauge: the plane might not have
been in immediate danger, and sometimes planes in trouble never alert
controllers.</p>
<p>Safer than driving</p>
<p>The National Safety Council estimates that Americans have a 1-in-93
chance of dying in a motor-vehicle crash, while deaths on airplanes are
too rare to calculate the odds. Figures from the U.S. Department of
Transportation tell a similar story.</p>
<p>“This is the safest form of transportation ever created, whereas
every day on the nation’s roads about a 737 full of people dies,”
Richard Aboulafia, a longtime aerospace analyst and consultant, said.
The safety council estimates that more than 44,000 people died in U.S.
vehicle crashes in 2023.</p>
<p>But a shrinking safety margin</p>
<p>A panel of experts reported in November that a shortage of air
traffic controllers, outdated plane-tracking technology and other
problems presented a growing threat to safety in the sky.</p>
<p>“The current erosion in the margin of safety in the (national
airspace system) caused by the confluence of these challenges is
rendering the current level of safety unsustainable,” the group said in
a 52-page report.</p>
<p>What is going on at Boeing?</p>
<p>Many but not all of the recent incidents have involved Boeing
planes.</p>
<p>Boeing is a $78 billion company, a leading U.S. exporter and a
century-old, iconic name in aircraft manufacturing. It is one-half of
the duopoly, along with Europe’s Airbus, that dominates the production
of large passenger jets.</p>
<p>The company’s reputation, however, was greatly damaged by the crashes
of two 737 Max jets — one in Indonesia in 2018, the other in Ethiopia
the following year — that killed 346 people. Boeing has lost nearly $24
billion in the last five years. It has struggled with manufacturing
flaws that at times delayed deliveries of 737s and long-haul 787
Dreamliners.</p>
<p>Boeing finally was beginning to regain its stride until the Alaska
Airlines Max blowout. Investigators have focused on bolts that help
secure the door-plug panel, but which were missing after a repair job at
the Boeing factory.</p>
<p>The FBI is notifying passengers about a criminal investigation. The
Federal Aviation Administration is stepping up oversight of the
company.</p>
<p>“What is going on with the production at Boeing? There have been
issues in the past. They don’t seem to be getting resolved,” FAA
Administrator Mike Whitaker said last month.</p>
<p>CEO David Calhoun says no matter what conclusions investigators reach
about the Alaska Airlines blowout, “Boeing is accountable for what
happened” on the Alaska plane. “We caused the problem and we understand
that.”</p>
<p>Where do design and manufacturing fit in?</p>
<p>Problems attributed to an airplane manufacturer can differ
greatly.</p>
<p>Some are design errors. On the original Boeing Max, the failure of a
single sensor caused a flight-control system to point the nose of the
plane down with great force — that happened before the deadly 2018 and
2019 Max crashes. It is a maxim in aviation that the failure of a single
part should never be enough to bring down a plane.</p>
<p>In other cases, such as the door-plug panel that flew off the Alaska
Airlines jet, it appears a mistake was made on the factory floor.</p>
<p>“Anything that results in death is worse, but design is a lot harder
to deal with because you have to locate the problem and fix it,” said
Aboulafia, the aerospace analyst. “In the manufacturing process, the fix
is incredibly easy – don’t do” whatever caused the flaw in the first
place.</p>
<p>Manufacturing quality appears to be an issue in other incidents
too.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the FAA proposed ordering airlines to inspect
wiring bundles around the spoilers on Max jets. The order was prompted
by a report that chafing of electrical wires due to faulty installation
caused an airliner to roll 30 degrees in less than a second on a 2021
flight.</p>
<p>Even little things matter. After a LATAM Airlines Boeing 787 flying
from Australia to New Zealand this month went into a nosedive — it
recovered — Boeing reminded airlines to inspect switches to motors that
move pilot seats. Published reports said a flight attendant accidentally
hitting the switch likely caused the plunge.</p>
<p>Not everything is Boeing’s fault</p>
<p>Investigations into some incidents point to likely lapses in
maintenance, and many close calls are due to errors by pilots or air
traffic controllers.</p>
<p>This week, investigators disclosed that an American Airlines jet that
overshot a runway in Texas had undergone a brake-replacement job four
days earlier, and some hydraulic lines to the brakes were not properly
reattached.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, a tire fell off a United Airlines Boeing 777
leaving San Francisco, and an American Airlines 777 made an emergency
landing in Los Angeles with a flat tire.</p>
<p>A piece of the aluminum skin was discovered missing when a United
Boeing 737 landed in Oregon last week. Unlike the brand-new Alaska jet
that suffered the panel blowout, the United plane was 26 years old.
Maintenance is up to the airline.</p>
<p>When a FedEx cargo plane landing last year in Austin, Texas, flew
close over the top of a departing Southwest Airlines jet, it turned out
that an air traffic controller had cleared both planes to use the same
runway.</p>
<p>Separating serious from routine</p>
<p>Aviation-industry officials say the most concerning events involve
issues with flight controls, engines and structural integrity.</p>
<p>Other things such as cracked windshields and planes clipping each
other at the airport rarely pose a safety threat. Warnings lights might
indicate a serious problem or a false alarm.</p>
<p>“We take every event seriously,” former NTSB member John Goglia said,
citing such vigilance as a contributor to the current crash-free streak.
“The challenge we have in aviation is trying to keep it there.”</p>

<h2 id="the-end-of-capitalism">2024-03-23 The end of capitalism</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-23, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2024-03-23-the-end-of-capitalism">
2024-03-23 The end of capitalism
</h1>
<p>
A few days ago, I saw a toot claiming that capitalism was the natural
state of being since the world just wasn’t altruistic, that is just the
way things are.
</p>
<p>
I… I don’t know where to start. The entire idea that production is part
of a natural state is bonkers. Nobody else purchases things. What about
other non-altruistic systems like dictatorships, slavery, feudalism, we
have so much choice in terrible solutions… and what a strange reaction
in face of one’s lack of imagination to just lie down and give up
instead of insisting on human ingenuity and demanding that we do better.
</p>
<p>
If you ever see anybody say anything about the natural state, the first
thing is to ask: are they a philosopher? A biologist? Or are they an
economist? Or a haver of opinions?
</p>
<p>
These are not alike.
</p>
<p>
I love philosophy enough to have read a few books and I spent four years
studying biology in the last millennium. I’m a master of science in
biology. Homo sapiens survived at least 49500 years without capitalism
and now we’ve had 500 years of capitalism max – that doesn’t sound like
a natural state, from my biologist perspective. There are a lot of extra
factors that are required for capitalism to flourish.
</p>
<p>
Modern humans appeared about 300,000 years ago. Cultural developments
started speeding up 40,000 years ago. Agriculture started about 10,000
years ago. Writing started about 6000 years ago. Mercantilism started
about 400 years ago.
</p>
<p>
I also don’t think that capitalism “evolved” naturally. As a biologist,
the word “evolve” is even more tricky than the word “natural”. When the
word “evolved” is used like in evolutionary biology, then I have
questions about the applicability of the concept to the development of
an economic system. It is not clear to me how this can work without
using it metaphorically. To compare an economic system with anything
that has evolved without genes (DNA or RNA, chromosomes, and so on) is
to use the word metaphorically.
</p>
<p>
My point is about the use of the word “natural” in an argument
supporting the existence of capitalism. Using the word “natural” is
extremely problematic. It usually raises more questions than it solves.
The examples I gave above illustrate that many aspects of capitalism
don’t exist in nature without humans. No animal has means of production
that allow them to exploit the labour of other creatures to increase
their capital and thus allow them to increase their means of production.
Thus, there is nothing “natural” about capitalism.
</p>
<p>
Or perhaps one would be tempted to argue that anything related to humans
is natural for humans, and therefore capitalism is a natural thing for
humans to engage in? But then all the alternative economic system are
just as natural: slavery empires, feudalism – all of it natural? Or
maybe the word “natural” would become unusable when used in this way
since it would no longer add anything to the conversation.
</p>
<p>
My point is also about there being a lot of other political systems that
are bad, that satisfy the condition of fitting a world that’s “not
altruistic”. These other political systems held for centuries, such as
monarchies, feudalism, slavery empires and the like. So “natural” cannot
be used to describe a tendency towards something so comparatively
short-lived as capitalism. We spent many more years doing all these
other evil economic systems and all of them at one point seemed
“natural” in the metaphorical sense, at the time, for a long time.
</p>
<p>
In order to argue that capitalism was the natural end-point of an
“evolution” is to argue like Hegel, Marx, or Fukuyama, it seems to me –
except that now it’s capitalism that’s the stable end-state, instead of
Prussia, communism or democracy. And if it isn’t the inevitable end,
then that’s exactly what I’ve been trying to say: the use of the word
“natural” in this context is bogus.
</p>
<p>
To have capitalism is at most a choice or maybe the result of external
conditions. If the oil dries up, if the energy no longer flows, if
famine comes back, then other economic systems might rise again. We
might revert to theocracy or to feudalism or to slavery empires.
</p>
<p>
My claim is that there’s no natural progression, there are just external
factors that currently benefit capitalism. And of course evil people
will be able to take advantage of power structures, no matter which
economic system a society uses.
</p>
<p>
And one day the conditions will no longer be right and capitalism will
end, not with a bang but with a whimper. When the economy crumbles to
dust and we’re thrown back into the conditions of the 15th century,
there will be no more capitalism. The sword will once again be mightier
than the coin.
</p>
<p>
Or maybe – and here I’ll allow myself to dream – we might yet find
another solution so that we can all inhabit this earth without torturing
each other to death.

Developer Preview 2 rolling out to Pixel</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-22, from: OS News</p>
<p>Android 15 adds “UI elements to ensure a consistent user experience
across the satellite connectivity landscape.” A system-level
“Auto-connected to satellite” notification conveys how “You can send and
receive messages without a mobile or Wi-Fi network” with a shortcut to
“Open Messages” or get more information. Meanwhile, note the status bar
icon at the right. Speaking of Google Messages, “Android 15 provides
support for SMS/ MMS applications as well as preloaded RCS applications
to use satellite connectivity for sending and receiving messages.” Other
apps will also be able to “detect when a device is connected to a
satellite, giving them more awareness of why full network services may
be unavailable.” ↫ Abner Li at 9To5Google 9To5Google also has a list of
all the new features in this Developer Preview with copious amounts of
screenshots.</p>

<p>
math is hard, for real, for most people beyond whole number arithmetic,
like not understanding relative sizes of fractions (thinking ⅓ is less
than ¼) or mistakes when calculating minutes &amp; days durations across
hours or months, so when blogging, writing microcopy, or designing a
user interface, keep any use of math relatively simple and instead
directly present visually clear durations and relative sizes.

API (application programmer interface) providers that use the
FixMyStreet platform. The change, added in version 1.07 of the program,
means it can now be used in both Norway (the data for which comes from
FiksGataMi) and Sweden (FixaMinGata). The UK data of course comes from

drops Onerep after CEO admits to running people-search networks</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-22, from: OS News</p>
<p>The nonprofit organization that supports the Firefox web browser said
today it is winding down its new partnership with Onerep, an identity
protection service recently bundled with Firefox that offers to remove
users from hundreds of people-search sites. The move comes just days
after a report by KrebsOnSecurity forced Onerep’s CEO to admit that he
has founded dozens of people-search networks over the years. On March
14, KrebsOnSecurity published a story showing that Onerep’s Belarusian
CEO and founder Dimitiri Shelest launched dozens of people-search
services since 2010, including a still-active data broker called Nuwber
that sells background reports on people. Onerep and Shelest did not
respond to requests for comment on that story. ↫ Brian Krebs It’s good
that Mozilla has immediately responded properly to this discovery, but
it does make one wonder – how did this happen in the first place? It
seems like a service provider like this would be thoroughly vetted,
especially considering Mozilla’s stated mission and types of users. My
worries about Firefox’ future are no secret, and this gaffe certainly
doesn’t help reduce my worries. It’s clear something went horribly wrong
here, and my hope is that it’s a random fluke, and not a sign of more
structural problems in Mozilla’s vetting process for potential
partners.</p>

emulator Suyu hit by GitLab DMCA, project lives on through
self-hosting</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-22, from: OS News</p>
<p>Switch emulator Suyu—a fork of the Nintendo-targeted and now-defunct
emulation project Yuzu—has been taken down from GitLab following a DMCA
request Thursday. But the emulation project’s open source files remain
available on a self-hosted git repo on the Suyu website, and recent
compiled binaries remain available on an extant GitLab repo. While the
DMCA takedown request has not yet appeared on GitLab’s public repository
of such requests, a GitLab spokesperson confirmed to The Verge that the
project was taken down after the site received notice “from a
representative of the rightsholder.” GitLab has not specified who made
the request or how they represented themselves; a representative for
Nintendo was not immediately available to respond to a request for
comment. ↫ Kyle Orland at Ars Technica Self-hosting the code repository
and binaries is probably the only way the Switch emulator can continue
to reasonably exist. The issue with Switch emulation seems to be that
the device is current, popular, and still makes endless amounts of money
for Nintendo; it’s very different from SNES or Mega Drive emulation, to
name a few examples. While I personally don’t think that should make
Switch emulation off-limits or any less valid than emulating older
systems, I can see how it would draw the ire of Nintendo more
readily.</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
America’s technology companies need power, and lots of it.
</p>
<p>
Artificial intelligence combined with still-growing internet and
smartphone use will likely require a game-changing investment in data
centers — one that its already showing up in huge projected
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/biden-ai-electricity-demand" target="_blank">increases
for electricity demand</a> across the country. At the same time, many
technology companies want to procure and invest in clean power, while
many states have clean energy goals that may make it difficult to add
new load to the grid without a corresponding investment in clean
generation. All told, the Department of Energy estimates that some 700
to 900 gigawatts of new clean firm capacity — energy generation that
doesn’t emit greenhouse gases and can run 24 hours a day — will be
necessary to build a
<a href="https://liftoff.energy.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Liftoff_DOE_NextGen_Geothermal.pdf" target="_blank">fully
decarbonized grid</a>. Even in the real world, technology companies are
interested in acquiring whatever clean power they can.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>This is where the nuclear industry would love to step in,
specifically the segment of the industry making small modular reactors,
otherwise known as SMRs. These reactors, which promise to be cheaper,
smaller, and faster to build than the existing nuclear fleet, seem like
an ideal match for what technology companies need. What could be better
for data centers than on-site power (meaning no transmission costs) that
runs all day (meaning no intermittency issues) with no carbon emissions
(meaning no climate worries)? And if those nuclear power plants could be
built quickly and cheaply out of pre-fabricated parts, all the better,
right?<del></del>
</p>
<p>
Whether SMRs actually <em>can</em> step in, well … “If I had every
agreement in principle SMRs have signed, I could walk from here to
Europe without getting my feet wet,” Dan Yurman, the publisher of
<em>Neutron Bytes</em> and a former project manager at the Idaho
National Laboratory, told me.
</p>
<p>
<strong></strong>The issue is that the most optimistic timeline for
commercial deployment of SMRs starts in the late 2020s, with most
observers putting actual deployment into sometimes in the 2030s. All the
while, demand for data centers is growing <em>now</em> and is projected
to accelerate sharply in the next few years.
</p>
<p>
As of today only a handful of small modular reactors are currently
operational anywhere in the world, and none in the United States. The
Nuclear Regulatory Commission<strong>, </strong>which governs all
civilian nuclear construction in the country, has so far approved just
one SMR design; NuScale, the company behind said design, recently laid
off
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/nuscale-power-lay-off-28-labor-force-save-costs-2024-01-08/" target="_blank">almost
a third of its employees</a> after its deal to
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/nuscale-small-modular-reactor-nuclear-costs-inflation" target="_self">build
a power plant in Utah</a> for a collection of local utilities fell
through due to rising costs.
</p>
<p>
That approval process cost $500 million and took around five years,
<a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/microsoft-targets-nuclear-to-power-ai-operations-e10ff798" target="_blank">according
to the Wall Street Journal</a> — and, of course, NuScale has yet to get
a functioning reactor out of it. The company is currently in the process
of getting the go-ahead on a more powerful version of its existing
design, which the company’s chief executive said could be approved
“within 24 months.”
</p>
<p>
On paper, however, enthusiasm for co-locating SMRs with data centers and
industrial sites abounds. Despite the collapse of the Utah project,
during an earnings call this month, NuScale eagerly talked up a
partnership with Standard Power to provide 2 gigawatts of electricity to
data centers in Ohio and Pennsylvania<strong>.</strong> While its shares
are down around 50% for the past 12 months, they are up about 35%
(albeit to around $4.20) since the end of last year. In its presentation
to investors, NuScale cited estimates that data center electricity
consumption would triple by the beginning of the next decade.
</p>
<p>
“Management is quite enthusiastic around its opportunity with data
center operators, noting that it’s in discussions with large players as
electricity demand accelerates via the AI buildout,” Ryan Pfingst and
Chris Souther, two analysts for B. Riley Securities, wrote in a note to
clients following the release of NuScale’s earnings
report.<br/><br/>That enthusiasm notwithstanding, it’s not clear how far
along the Standard Power project is. “A project of this size has a
significant amount of detail that’s confirmed and structured before a
project begins construction and those discussions are ongoing,” NuScale
CEO John Hopkins told analysts on the company’s most recent earnings
call. Standard Power did not return a request for comment asking for
more details on the financing or construction timeline for its project.
When asked for an update from NuScale, a spokesperson referred me to the
earnings call.<strong><em></em></strong>
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, in Surry County, Virginia, work is advancing on a project
adjacent to the existing Surry nuclear plant. The project would combine
data centers, small modular reactors, and hydrogen fuel production; the
<a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/nuclear-powered-data-center-campus-in-surry-virginia-gets-rezoning-approval/" target="_blank">data
centers would come first</a>, with SMRs following once costs come down,
according to
<a href="https://www.ip3international.com/about-us/ip3-founders-and-management/rear-admiral-ret-michael-hewitt-u-s-navy/" target="_blank">Michael
Hewitt</a>, the co-founder and chief executive officer of IP3, the
project’s developer.
</p>
<p>
For Hewitt, the model for SMR deployment is to build them in factories
and scale them directly for end users. “That’s the future of energy: If
I want a gigawatt of data center, I build SMRs for the data center on
day one,” he told me.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Which company will get there first? “If I had to guess right now, in
terms of what will be factory-built first and available to consumers
like us, it will more than likely be a light water reactor design —
<a href="https://www.gevernova.com/nuclear/carbon-free-power/bwrx-300-small-modular-reactor" target="_blank">GE</a>,
NuScale, or
perhaps<a href="https://www.rolls-royce-smr.com/" target="_blank">
Rolls-Royce</a>,” Hewitt said. GE’s SMR design, the BWRX-300, is in the
pre-application process with the NRC, and was picked by Ontario Power
Generation for a nuclear development on its
<a href="https://www.gevernova.com/news/press-releases/ge-hitachi-signs-contract-for-the-first-north-american-small-modular-reactor" target="_blank">existing
Darlington site</a>. The Rolls-Royce SMR
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/rolls-royce-shortlisted-uk-seeks-small-nuclear-plant-developers-2023-10-02/" target="_blank">has
been advancing</a> through the British regulatory and procurement
process, while the company currently designs light-water reactors for
the Royal Navy.
</p>
<p>
“The first guy to get the factory built is the winner,” Hewitt said. But
none will likely be ready for the Virginia project, at least not within
the next eight to 10 years, though, he added. Nevertheless, urgent
interest persists.
</p>
<p>
On Tuesday, Google, Microsoft, and the steel company Nucor announced
that they were forming a group that would
<a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/google-microsoft-nucor-clean-energy-initiative/" target="_blank">commit
to purchasing clean firm technologies</a> and included in its laundry
list of potential power sources advanced nuclear. Another advanced
nuclear developer, TerraPower, which is backed by Microsoft’s founder
Bill Gates, announced Tuesday that it was applying for a construction
permit for a plant in Wyoming and plans to start building non-nuclear
portions of it in June<strong>.</strong> The company expects the full
plant to
<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/418907d1-d497-439c-9800-eb814226ab71" target="_blank">come
online in 2030</a>.
</p>
<p>
There are dozens of other SMR designs at various stage of realization,
but the absolute fastest a new design could get online, according to
Adam Stein of the Breakthrough Institute, is around four years. “If a
developer has not already submitted an application to the NRC to build a
power plant — which none of them have for a specific site — then they
mostly likely would not be able to operate a power plant before 2028,”
Stein told me. “That is the soonest it could happen.”
</p>
<p>
That said, “If there’s more urgency from the market, a clearer and
larger demand signal, then developers will move faster than they are
right now,” Stein added.
</p>
<p>
What’s far more likely, according to Yurman, is that tech companies will
sign power purchase agreements for existing nuclear power plants, as
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/amazon-nuclear-talen-energy" target="_blank">Amazon
has with Talen Energy</a>. “That’s immediate access to reliable power,”
Yurman said.
</p>
<p>
And even if SMRs are actually built, they may not end up adjacent to
data centers, but instead on the sites of existing nuclear and even coal
plants (this is the plan for the TerraPower site) which have preexisting
grid connections. “If I’m putting together this kind of deal,” Yurman
told me, “I’m looking at an old coal power plant I can demolish and keep
the grid connection.”
</p>
<p>
While American tech companies are eager to buy up new power, the real
opportunity, should it ever come, may be overseas, where smaller
countries without indigenous energy supplies could be especially
interested in nuclear power.
</p>
<p>
“What we need to do is get to full rate production and start stamping
out SMRs with low risk,” Hewitt said. “If we do that, we can take these
things everywhere.”

Pledges Additional $22M to Fight Terrorism in Mozambique</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Maputo, Mozambique — U.S. officials pledged $22 million in new
funding Thursday to help Mozambique fight Islamist militants in the
country’s troubled, oil-rich Cabo Delgado, where an insurgency has
intensified in recent weeks.</p>
<p>The United States already had pledged $100 million.</p>
<p>At the end of a five-day visit to Maputo, Anne Witkowsky, U.S.
assistant secretary of state for conflict and stabilization operations,
said the funding aims to help Mozambique with stabilizing and
peacebuilding efforts in its northern provinces.</p>
<p>Calling security in north Mozambique critical, Witkowsky told VOA
that the U.S.-financed programs provide training for local government
officials to deliver services; promote social cohesion through peace
clubs, sports and the arts; and increase educational and employment
opportunities for youth.</p>
<p>“Mozambique is a priority partner country under our strategy to
prevent conflict and promote stability,” she said. “So, the U.S.
supports a Mozambique that is more prosperous, more secure, more
resilient and more democratic for all.”</p>
<p>Since 2017, Mozambique’s province of Cabo Delgado has faced an armed
insurgency, with some attacks claimed by an extremist group calling
itself Islamic State.</p>
<p>On Monday, Mozambican President Filipe Nyusi warned that terrorism
could divide the country, advocating that citizens unite to fight rebel
groups in the province.</p>
<p>Nyusi spoke after missionaries, priests and religious sisters were
forced to flee from remote towns and villages to Pemba and other large
cities, which are overwhelmed with persons displaced by the
conflict.</p>
<p>Nyusi said resolution of the problem depends on the unity of
Mozambicans and foreign forces supporting them.</p>
<p>The Reverend Marcos Macamo, a scholar of African theology and
religious sciences, is part of a coalition of religious and civic
advocacy groups that are urging the government to open negotiations with
the militants. But, he said, even diplomacy has its own challenges.</p>
<p>“The terrorists … wouldn’t have power unless local people give them
information,” Macamo said. “They [locals] open the doors slightly so
that the enemy can enter.”</p>
<p>The insurgency in northern Mozambique began in 2017 but has seen an
increase in attacks since the beginning of this year. In the last few
days alone, there have been several raids on towns and villages, and
people have been killed or kidnapped.</p>
<p>According to humanitarian agencies, the insurgency has killed at
least 5,000 people and displaced more than 1 million.</p>
<p>Oil giants Exxon Mobil and Total are among international energy
companies developing natural gas projects offshore of northern
Mozambique.</p>

<h2 id="suburbia-is-the-real-battleground-for-electric-cars">Suburbia Is
the Real Battleground for Electric Cars</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-22, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTgxMjU1Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcyNzAwNTAyNn0.gj6WGvSEsI_u5xonVCP7fthE0hS0GOnnhKLCA_7hd60/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Where I am from, people worry about
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGNWkj9jPPA" target="_blank">making
good time</a>. Nebraska small talk regresses not to what route you took
— the California concern — but how fast you got there. Rather than get
on a plane, people from the Great Plains will undertake a 10-hour drive
to Cousin Rob’s in Dallas and rue that they could’ve done it in nine and
a half if not for all the construction. Dads refuse to stop on long
drives for
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GenX/comments/17xoi65/comment/k9oqs0q/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3" target="_blank">this
very reason</a>.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Electric cars aren’t great for making great time. Even though charging
speeds are getting faster, the leisurely pace of the EV break can’t
compare to the Cannonball Run pit stop: pump gas, use the restroom, and
get back on the road within five minutes. EVs are not (yet) ideal for
other, more practical rural concerns. The punishing winter temperatures
of North Dakota can sap a battery’s driving range. So does towing the
boat to the lake. Flyover country is full of state highways where there
is nary a fast-charger in sight.
</p>
<p>
Those are among the reasons the residents of rural America hesitate to
embrace the EV. There is a tribal impetus, too: Rural areas are heavily
Republican and more likely to reject electric cars on the basis of
political identity. This fact may spell trouble for the Detroit auto
giants trying to sell EV pickup trucks to die-hard combustion loyalists
and for goals of making America an all-EV nation anytime soon. But when
it comes to climate, maybe it’s not a <em>crisis</em>.
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p class="drop-caps">
Like any environmental issue, the EV question is about scale. To reduce
the carbon pollution of the transportation sector, it’s not enough for a
few people to trade in their gas-guzzling Ford Expeditions for Mustang
Mach-Es. Most people need to do it to take a chunk out of emissions.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately, electric vehicles work best where people are concentrated.
City dwellers generally drive shorter distances than rural residents
during errands and commutes, meaning an EV with decent range can cover
their everyday needs. Even those at the exurban extents of major
metropolitan areas are generally close enough to city centers to make a
round trip without charging in the middle.
</p>
<p>
Charging infrastructure follows the population maps, too. As the country
scales up its supply of level 3 fast chargers, it still makes the most
sense to put the vast majority of those plugs in cities and along the
Interstate System where those urbanites do most of their driving. This
drives a feedback loop that will continue to make electric driving more
enticing to city people than country people.
</p>
<p>
For those rooting for mass adoption of EVs, this is good news. According
to sustainability researchers at the University of Michigan,
<a href="https://css.umich.edu/publications/factsheets/built-environment/us-cities-factsheet" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">83%</a>
of Americans now live in urban areas, up from 64% in 1950. That number
could approach 90% by mid-century. The United States, despite its small
town self-mythologizing, is an urban country that grows more urban by
the day, and that means most people live in a location where an EV could
meet their daily driving needs.
</p>
<p>
(Also, urban areas should embrace EVs to reduce the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-cars-improve-air-quality" target="_self">health-damaging
air pollution</a> from ICE tailpipes, which concentrates in places with
lots of people, and therefore cars. In rural places where people are
spread out and dozens of cars don’t sit idling as a herd during freeway
traffic, this is a less pressing concern.)
</p>
<p>
The fact that electric driving would prove more challenging for rural
America sounds like grim news for climate change, since
<a href="https://www.anthropocenemagazine.org/2020/02/the-unexpected-drivers-of-carbon-footprints/#:~:text=Overall%2C%20the%20rural%20carbon%20footprint,to%20transportation%20and%20home%20heating." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according
to one study</a>, they have a 20% larger carbon footprint compared to
their urban counterparts, a difference largely attributed to home
heating and to driving longer distances. But, again, the question is
about scale. Even though living in the boonies necessitates emitting
more carbon, there are just <em>so many more</em> metropolitan
Americans. The best way to make a big dent in transportation emissions
is to get metro residents — the 83% — to embrace the life electric.
</p>
<p>
Eventually, the EV revolution will reach the countryside, but those who
prefer combustion driving will be able to keep doing so for a long time
to come. Even if the nation followed the California goal of making the
light-duty vehicle market 100% electric by
<a href="https://rhg.com/research/build-back-better-transportation/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2035</a>,
that’s only <em>new</em> cars. (California
<a href="https://www.realclearenergy.org/articles/2024/01/18/california_landscapers_brace_for_gas-powered_lawn_equipment_ban_1005864.html#:~:text=On%20January%201%2C%202024%2C%20California,noise%20pollution%2C%20and%20climate%20change." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">banned</a>
the sale of gas-powered lawn equipment, but I still hear plenty of
small-engine leaf blowers at work around Los Angeles every afternoon.)
Vehicles are better-built than they’ve even been and last on the road
for more than a decade, meaning there’ll be
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/03/10/climate/electric-vehicle-fleet-turnover.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">plenty
of gas-burners</a> on the highway deep into the 2040s. It will just
become more expensive to fuel and to service them as the country’s
infrastructure and mechanic shops finally move away from combustion.
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p class="drop-caps">
Just like America’s presidential elections, the country’s EV battle may
be won or lost in the suburbs.
</p>
<p>
Consider one recent research
<a href="https://theconversation.com/suburban-living-the-worst-for-carbon-emissions-new-research-149332" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">project</a>,
which found that while rural residents emit more carbon than
city-dwellers, it’s suburbanites who are the very worst. They drive more
than those who live in the center city and might have access to decent
public transportation. And, on average, they earn more than truly rural
residents, which is
<a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1922205117" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">correlated
with a higher carbon footprint</a>. That project studied Austria, but
the Brookings Institute
<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/its-not-just-cities-suburbs-and-exurbs-need-to-adopt-and-implement-climate-plans-too/#:~:text=In%20metropolitan%20regions%2C%20suburbs%20emit,up%20to%20twice%20the%20average." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">found
the same thing</a> in the United States: “In metropolitan regions,
suburbs emit up to four times the household emissions of their urban
cores. While households located in more densely populated neighborhoods
have a carbon footprint 50% below the national average, those in the
suburbs emit up to twice the average.”
</p>
<p>
To put it another way: It’s suburbanites who could potentially do the
most climate good by switching to EVs. Plus, they are potentially
affluent enough to afford electric vehicles. They’re also likely to have
garages and driveways to make charging at home a simpler affair compared
to the apartment-dweller who has little control over whether their
landlord puts plugs in the parking lot. (Mine didn’t.)
</p>
<p>
Certainly suburbia has its share of MAGA rank-and-file who dismiss EVs
as the choice of the woke, as well as Towing Dads who’ll hold out until
electric pickup range can match that of gas. Yet the politically purple
‘burbs may be ruled by the pragmatists, or people who’ll happily buy an
EV — just as soon as they’re convinced it’s the right economic choice
for their families, or, perhaps, as soon as everybody else at their
kids’ school starts getting one.
</p>
<p>
Sources like David Rapson of the University of California, Davis have
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/03/americas-lost-year-electric-cars/677686/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told
me</a> these buyers are the tipping point for the mass adoption of the
electric vehicle. It makes sense: EVs may never convince their
entrenched opponents to ditch internal combustion, but they don’t have
to. If the bulk of Americans make the jump and begin driving the kids to
practice on battery power, that’s an enormous chunk of carbon that’s
simply not emitted.
</p>
<p>
Transportation is about the right technology for the right situation.
EVs are a just-okay choice for dense urban centers — they’re better than
gas cars, but thoughtful city planning could help people choose greener
and better solutions such as cycling and mass transit. For car-reliant
suburbs and exurbs, EVs hold the key to drastically reducing carbon
emissions. In truly rural America, the best choice for years to come
might be burning gasoline. And maybe that’s fine — as long as the
country’s population centers get with the program.

Is Still a Giant Climate Mystery</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-22, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTc0OTM1My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0NDEwMTUyNn0.4K9JXZkO07yhibQ5hDw7Bdyd68LYm0hOA6DXyE6itMk/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
As is usually the case, one of the most basic questions in
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/this-is-the-end-of-climate-science" target="_blank">climate
science</a> has also been one of the most difficult to answer: How much
energy is the Earth sending out into space? The pair of shoebox-sized
satellites that comprise PREFIRE — Polar Radiant Energy in the
Far-InfraRed Experiment — could very well provide the answer.
</p>
<p>
Principal investigator Tristan L’Ecuyer, a professor in the Department
of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at the University of
Wisconsin-Madison and the director of the Cooperative Institute for
Meteorological Satellite Studies, spoke with Heatmap about PREFIRE.
Tentatively scheduled to launch in May, the project stands not only to
make future climate models more accurate, but could also help shape a
new generation of atmospheric exploration.
</p>
<p>
The interview has been edited for length and clarity.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Could you tell me a little bit about your research and the work
that you do?</strong>
</p>
<p>
A lot of our climate information comes from models — where I come in is
trying to make sure that those predictions are rooted in actual
observations of our planet. But it’s impossible to cover the whole globe
with a temperature sensor or water vapor [sensor] or those sorts of
things, so I’ve always focused on using satellite observations, and in
particular I’ve been focusing on the exchange of energy.
</p>
<p>
Basically, what drives the climate is the incoming energy from the sun
and how that’s balanced by the thermal energy that the Earth emits. One
of the big influencers of that balance are clouds — they reflect the
sunlight, but they also have a greenhouse effect of their own; they trap
the thermal energy emitted. So I’ve spent most of my career trying to
understand the effects of clouds on the climate and how that might
change if the climate warms.
</p>
<p>
<strong>And what’s the goal of this particular mission?</strong>
</p>
<p>
One of the fastest changing regions on Earth right now is the polar
regions — I think a lot of people are aware of that. Normally, the polar
regions are very cold — they reflect a lot of sunlight just because of
the ice surface. But as the ice surface melts, the ocean is a lot darker
than ice, and so [the poles] can actually absorb more of the solar
radiation that’s coming in.
</p>
<p>
A lot of people say, “Well, okay, but that’s the Arctic. I don’t live
there.” But the way the climate works is that in order to create an
equilibrium between these really, really cold polar caps and the really,
really warm tropics. It’s just like heating the end of a rod — the rod
is going to transfer some of the heat from the hot end to the cold end
to establish an equilibrium between them. The Earth does the same thing,
but the way it does that is through our weather systems. So basically,
how cold the polar region is versus the equator is what’s going to
govern how severe our weather is in the mid-latitudes.
</p>
<p>
What we’re trying to do is make measurements of, basically, how that
thermal energy is distributed. We just have a lack of understanding
right now — or it’s more that the understanding comes from isolated,
individual field projects, and what we really want to do is map out the
whole Arctic and understand all of the different regions and how it’s
changing.
</p>
<p>
<strong>How do you expect your findings to influence our climate models?
Or how <em>significantly</em> do you expect them to affect the climate
models?</strong>
</p>
<p>
This is quite unusual for a satellite project, we actually have climate
modelers as part of our team. There’s the people that take, for example,
the Greenland ice sheet, and they model things like the melting of the
ice, how heat transports into the ice sheet, how the water once it melts
percolates through the ice and then runs off at the bottom of the
glacier, or even on top of the glacier. And then I have a general
climate modeling group that basically uses climate models to project
future climate.
</p>
<p>
There’s two ways that’s going to happen. The first is we’ve developed a
tool that allows us to kind of simulate what our satellite would see if
it was flying in a climate model as opposed to around the real Earth —
we can simulate exactly what the climate model is suggesting the
satellite should see. And then of course, we’re making the real
observations with the satellite. We can compare the two and evaluate, in
today’s climate, how well is that climate model reproducing what the
satellites see?
</p>
<p>
The other way is we’re going to generate models of how much heat comes
off of various surfaces — ice surfaces, water surfaces, snow surfaces —
and that information can be used to create a new module that goes right
into the climate model and improves the way it represents the surface.
</p>
<p>
<strong>So what do these satellites look like and how do they
work?</strong>
</p>
<p>
Our satellite is called a CubeSat. It’s not very big at all, maybe a
foot wide, a foot-and-a-half or so long. There’s a little aperture, a
little hole on the end of the satellite that lets the thermal energy
from the Earth go in, and then the the rest of the satellite is
basically just this big box that has a radio and a transmitter. In
total, I think the whole thing weighs about 15 kilograms.
</p>
<p>
Because it’s relatively small and relatively inexpensive, we’re actually
able to have two of those instead of just having one, and what that lets
us do is put them into different orbits. At some point that will cross
and see the same spot on the ground — let’s say somewhere in the center
of Greenland — but up to eight or nine hours apart. Let’s say it melts
in between, we’ll be able to understand how that melting process
affected the heat that was emitted from the surface into the atmosphere.
</p>
<p>
<strong>How big of a deal do you think this is? Or how big of a deal do
you think it could be?</strong>
</p>
<p>
There’s more than a couple of aspects to this. To really segue from the
last question to this one, the reason [the satellites are] inexpensive,
it’s not that they’re low-quality. It’s actually because they’re very
uniform sizes and shapes. You can mass produce them. And so it’s that
fact, coupled with the fact that we can now do real science on this
small platform. We’ve been able to miniaturize the technology. If we can
keep demonstrating that these missions are viable and producing
realistic science data, this could be the future of the field.
</p>
<p>
Coming back to the polar climate, we absolutely know that the poles are
warming at a very alarming rate. We know that the ice sheets are
melting. We know that this has implications for the weather in the lower
latitudes where we live, and for sea level. But when you try to predict
that 100 years from now, there’s quite a range of different answers,
from very catastrophic to still pretty bad. Depending on which of those
answers is correct, it really dictates what we need to do today. How
quickly do we need to adapt to a rising sea level, or to stronger storms
or more frequent storms? After this mission, we will be able to improve
the climate models in such a way that we’ll have a narrower range of
possibilities.
</p>
<p>
The other thing that’s exciting is also just the unknown. There’s always
new things that you learn by measuring something for the first time. We
might learn something about the tropics, we might learn something about
the upper atmosphere. There are some people in mountainous areas that
are quite interested in the measurements — at the top of mountains, it’s
actually quite similar in climate to the Arctic. So I’m also really
excited about what happens when the science community in general
explores that data for the first time.

Are grocery prices high because of supply chain problems and rising

trends to pad their profits? A new report from the Federal Trade

Biden cancels $5.8 billion in student debt for public service workers,
and we’ll hear key takeaways from CERAWeek, the “Super Bowl” of energy.

<h2>
The G4’s swan song
</h2>
<p>
Apple’s Blue-and-White G3 brought a bit of fun into the industrial
design of Apple’s pro desktop line of Macs. The four-handle
polycarbonate design language progressed through a few generations of G3
and G4, culminating in the ‘Mirrored Drive Door’ model.
</p>
<p>
This model is also nicknamed ‘Windtunnel’ for the amount of noise it
generates. The original G3 minitower ran a single 300 MHz G3.
</p>
<p>
The MDD came in configurations with up to <em>two</em> 1.42 GHz G4
(PowerPC 7455) CPUs, <em>two</em> full-size optical drive bays, and even
more expansion.

<strong></strong>Washington has told Ukraine to stop targeting Russia’s

A military intelligence official told the paper that there have been at
least 12 attacks on Russian oil refineries since 2022, nine of which
occurred this year. There have also been attacks on terminals and
storage infrastructure. “Russia remains one of the world’s most
important energy exporters despite western sanctions on its oil and gas
sector,” the <em>FT</em> said. Gas prices have risen almost 15% already
this year, putting pressure on President Biden leading into the November
election.

to “work to fully unlock the potential of nuclear energy” in the quest
for energy security and emissions reductions. The relatively vague
commitment, cosigned by the U.S., China, Britain, and Saudi Arabia,
emerged from the first-ever Nuclear Energy Summit in Brussels yesterday.
It says countries will help extend the lives of existing nuclear
reactors, construct new ones, and support deployment of advanced
reactors. “Generating electricity using nuclear fission remains a
divisive issue that cuts across partisan lines,”

Nicole Pollack at Heatmap</a>. Some environmental groups see the risk of
nuclear disasters as too high, while others see it as a reliable

Shortest Victory Parade Ever ​</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-22, from: The Signal</p>
<p>
On Dec. 30 (letters), Lois Eisenberg gave herself a pat on the back for
eliciting reactions from some of The Signal’s readers. She gleefully
proclaimed that she is always “truthful and factual” and took pride in
“hitting the political funny bone of some of these writers who have a
hard time grasping the truth and […]

<p>
So, today at around 1:30 p.m., I had just gotten home from a lot of
walking and I was tired. So I drove the couple of blocks to my little
neighborhood post office to drop off some bills. Don’t put them in the
drive-up post box anymore as, even in this, one of the safest […]

Thank you for your recent article discussing the City Council study

This nickname for President Joe Biden, “Let’s Go Brandon,” left the MAGA

Congress Cult and America how vital he is, and left that MAGA group in
shock. President Biden […]

<hr />
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Let’s start from the basics: can you introduce
yourself?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
Hello! I’m Taylor (mayor of
<a href="https://taylor.town/">taylor.town</a>).
</p>
<p>
I collect hobbies, build things, incite chaos, and engage in elaborate
tomfoolery. I work as a developer, designer, DB architect,
<a href="https://taylor.town/hire-me">and other things</a>.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>What’s the story behind your blog?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I created my first personal website to quickly teach myself how to make
websites, because I fudged my resume and accidentally landed a job as a
web developer before I was ready.
</p>
<p>
My website became a blog when I posted my digital notebooks online circa
2015. I maintained hundreds of markdown files on various topics and
ideas, but I was too embarrassed to publish most of the actual notes, so
I replaced the body of each file with “Coming soon!”. My private
ideas.txt file sits at 110,427 words right now. This does not include
hundreds of unfinished essays, papers, books, stories, games, gadgets,
etc.
</p>
<p>
As I grew more specific and organized, my notes became easier to digest.
In 2019, I started writing about
<a href="https://taylor.town/the-speedy-media-manifesto">my
opinions</a>, <a href="https://taylor.town/synthetic-intelligence">my
fears</a>, <a href="https://taylor.town/time">my inspirations</a>, and
<a href="https://taylor.town/how-do-taoists-quit-smoking">my
paradoxes</a>.
</p>
<p>
But I didn’t start writing seriously
<a href="https://taylor.town/1000-weekends">until I stopped drinking in
2022</a>. Writing was welcome respite from alcohol withdrawals. Without
booze to fill my emptiness, I suddenly found myself with plenty of
“boring” hours. So I kept writing. And now I can’t stop writing.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>What does your creative process look like when it comes to
blogging?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I consume absurd amounts of
<a href="https://taylor.town/books">books</a>,
<a href="https://blogs.hn/">small blogs</a>,
<a href="https://taylor.town/music">music</a>,
<a href="https://taylor.town/podcasts">podcasts</a>, and other internet
media.
</p>
<p>
From there, my inspiration ferments in a 1Mb text file called ideas.txt.
When I’m not doing chores, I start from the top of ideas.txt and work my
way down, making small
<a href="https://taylor.town/pseudoprose">pseudoprose</a> edits along
the way. An idea usually sits at the top of the list for a few months
before it’s ripe enough to publish.
</p>
<p>
Here’s an excerpt from the top of my list on Dec 7, 2023:

<strong>Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe
the physical space influences your creativity?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
Countless creations die in the pursuit of Ideal Creative Environments.
After hearing how much quality work Tyler Cowen completes while
traveling, I taught myself how to
<a href="https://taylor.town/between-time">scrounge for in-between
time</a>. Through that process, I made more time for creative pursuits
via
<a href="https://taylor.town/extinguish-all-notifications">extinguishing
notifications</a> and <a href="https://taylor.town/nowify">bespoke
time-tracking software</a>.
</p>
<p>
Today, most of my creative process occurs on couches – just me and my
laptop. When I need more real-estate, I use
<a href="https://taylor.town/my-battlestation">my battlestation</a>.
When my thoughts become tangled, I clean my home or play with my
daughter or walk outside. When I draw, I use our makeshift art studio in
the basement. And so on.
</p>
<p>
Everything in a home or office eventually becomes
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inattentional_blindness#Invisible_Gorilla_Test">invisible
gorillas</a>. In my experience, physical
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propinquity">propinquity</a> is
the fastest way to modulate creativity. Unsurprisingly, surrounding
myself with healthy and supportive people was a really good way to
become healthy and supported.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your
tech stack?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<ul>
<li>
All my writings are markdown files (with YAML frontmatter) in a GitHub
repo.
</li>
<li>
An ugly Elixir script converts each file into HTML and compiles
<a href="https://taylor.town/feed.xml">an atom feed</a>.
</li>
<li>
All of these files are served to the public via Cloudflare Pages.
</li>
<li>
Every few weeks, I copy/paste stuff into
<a href="https://buttondown.email/">Buttondown</a> for
<a href="https://newsletter.taylor.town/">my email newsletter</a>.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would
you do anything differently?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<ul>
<li>
More doodles! I’m still working up the courage to share more of my
drawings…
</li>
<li>
People cannot spell “Troesh” from memory, so I’m glad I chose
<a href="https://taylor.town/">taylor.town</a> over
<a href="https://taylor.troe.sh/">taylor.troe.sh</a>. But I’ll never
know if <a href="https://taylor.town/">taylor.town</a> was a better
choice than <a href="https://taylor.land/">taylor.land</a>.
</li>
<li>
If I started over, I probably wouldn’t write my build script in Elixir –
maybe Haskell or Go or JS instead?
</li>
<li>
I wasted a lot of time on essay ideas that were time-consuming but
obviously worthless. I should’ve learned earlier to sort by
<a href="https://dom.iowa.gov/resource/lean-resources/impact-difficulty-matrix-template">difficulty
vs. impact</a>.
</li>
<li>
I’m still unsure about Instagram, X, and other socials media. I love
meeting strangers via email – am I missing cool people from other
corners of the web?
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Financial question since the web is obsessed with money: how
much does it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost or does it
generate some revenue? And what’s your position on people monetising
personal blogs?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
It costs $0 to host my blog on GitHub and Cloudflare. I spend $30/mo on
Buttondown. I once hoped that my blog would land me some sweet
consulting gigs. As of 2023, total consulting revenue is $0.
</p>
<p>
I aim to be worth
<a href="https://taylor.town/dollar-per-hour">$1/hour</a>. Advertising
is spooky, so I’ve been working on books and games and services to sell
instead. But it’s hard to juggle making worthwhile art while working for
an employer while publishing free content.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth
checking out? And also, who do you think I should be interviewing
next?</strong>
</p>

The heads of BMW, Volkswagen, and Renault have spoken out against
European Union’s emission targets in recent days, arguing that the
phase-out rules put too much pressure on the industry and that consumers
aren’t buying EVs fast enough. Next year, the policy will tighten ahead
of the full ban of gas and diesel cars in 2035, leaving automakers to
pay steep fines if they fall short.

<h2 id="at-un-russia-and-china-veto-us-effort-at-gaza-cease-fire">At UN,
Russia and China Veto US Effort at Gaza Cease-Fire</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>UNITED NATIONS — The U.N. Security Council failed again Friday to
demand a Gaza cease-fire after Russia and China vetoed a U.S.-drafted
resolution supporting a halt to the fighting.</p>
<p>“Russia and China simply did not want to vote for a resolution that
was penned by the United States, because it would rather see us fail
than see this council succeed,” U.S. Ambassador Linda-Thomas Greenfield
said.</p>
<p>Eleven of the 15 council members supported the U.S. text, Algeria
joined Russia and China in voting against it, and Guyana abstained.</p>
<p>The United States drafted the resolution following its three earlier
vetoes of council texts calling for a halt to the fighting. In what some
council members said was vague language, the U.S. draft “determines the
imperative of an immediate and sustained cease-fire” to protect
civilians, get more humanitarian aid in and hostages out.</p>
<p>“However, to save the lives of peaceful Palestinian civilians, this
is not enough,” Russian envoy Vassily Nebenzia said of the language.
“This is in no way what is stipulated in the mandate of the U.N.
Security Council – the council, which is invested with a unique
mechanism to demand a cease-fire, and where necessary to compel
compliance therewith.”</p>
<p>China’s envoy echoed that, saying the draft resolution was
“ambiguous” and did not call for an immediate cease-fire.</p>
<p>Guyanese Ambassador Carolyn Rodrigues-Birkett, whose country joined
the council in January, said her government could not support a
resolution that did not “unequivocally” call for an immediate and
unconditional cease-fire.</p>
<p>“The demand for a cease-fire should not be linked to or conditioned
on the release of hostages,” she said. “The taking of hostages is
strictly prohibited under international law, and their release must be
unconditional.” </p>
<p>She also questioned why only Hamas was condemned for its actions and
not Israel, as well.</p>
<p>“For example, who is responsible for 1.5 million Palestinians taking
refuge in Rafah? And who has announced a planned military ground
offensive there? To whom is the demand for compliance with obligations
under international law regarding the protection of civilians and
civilian objects, humanitarian access, and the protection of
humanitarian relief and medical personnel, their assets and
infrastructure applicable?” she asked.</p>
<p>The condemnation of Hamas has been a repeated sticking point for some
council members. Thomas-Greenfield called it “outrageous” that the
council has failed to condemn its terror attack on Israel.</p>
<p>This was the seventh time the council failed to agree on a cease-fire
resolution since the war started in October. The International Crisis
Group’s U.N. director, Richard Gowan, told VOA that a lot of council
members may feel that Russia and China “blew up” what has been the best
opportunity to engage with the United States to achieve one.</p>
<p>“If the resolution had passed, it would at least have been a hook for
further negotiations and sent a signal to Israel to step back from
Rafah,” he said. “Now the Israelis may sense that they can push forward
with their operations without facing any censure at the U.N. So, the
main beneficiary of the Russian-Chinese vetoes is [Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu.”</p>
<p>A group of seven elected council members – Algeria, Guyana, Malta,
Mozambique, Sierra Leone, Slovenia, and Switzerland – have drafted their
own text that “demands” an immediate cease-fire for the Muslim holy
month of Ramadan – which is already under way.</p>
<p>Diplomats said the text will be voted on Saturday morning. Russia and
China said they would support it, but Thomas-Greenfield indicated that
in its current form it may not have Washington’s support.</p>
<p>“If that alternative resolution comes up for a vote and does not
support the diplomacy happening on the ground, we may once again find
this council deadlocked,” she said. “I truly hope that that does not
come about.”</p>
<p>Regional diplomacy</p>
<p>Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken left the Middle
East without convincing Netanyahu to call off a military offensive in
Rafah, in southern Gaza, which many believe would exacerbate the
territory’s humanitarian crisis.</p>
<p>Netanyahu said he told Blinken during talks Friday in Tel Aviv, that
“we have no way to defeat Hamas without entering Rafah.”</p>
<p>Blinken told reporters at the end of his visit that the U.S. shares
Israel’s goal of defeating Hamas.</p>
<p>“But a major ground operation in Rafah is not, in our judgment, the
way to achieve it and we were very clear about that,” he said.</p>
<p>The State Department said Blinken emphasized the need to protect
civilians in Gaza and increase and sustain humanitarian assistance,
including through both land and sea routes.</p>
<p>Blinken’s meeting with Israeli officials in Tel Aviv Friday came as
efforts continued to secure a six-week-long cease-fire between Israel
and Hamas in exchange for the release of hostages seized on October 7.
The threat of a potential invasion of Rafah casts doubt over the
talks.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Blinken told reporters after meetings in Egypt that “the
gaps are narrowing” and that there’s still “difficult work to get
there,” but he believes a deal is possible.</p>
<p>The main point of contention in negotiations has been that Hamas says
it will release the remaining hostages only as part of a deal that would
end the war, whereas Israel says it will consider only a temporary
pause.</p>
<p>At the United Nations, Israel’s ambassador told the Security Council
his government does not want to send its “sons and daughters” to fight
in Rafah, but that there is “no alternative” as its military must go
after the four remaining Hamas battalions it says are in the city.</p>
<p>“The road to a permanent cease-fire passes through Rafah,” Ambassador
Gilad Erdan said.</p>
<p>More than a million Palestinians are sheltering in Rafah, many of
them after fleeing other parts of Gaza to try to find safety amid the
war.</p>
<p>Hamas’ October 7 terror attack inside Israel triggered the war,
killing about 1,200 people. Israel’s subsequent counteroffensive in Gaza
has killed nearly 32,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run Gaza
health ministry.</p>
<p>Delivery of humanitarian assistance has been difficult, and a
U.N.-backed food insecurity report said last week that more than a
million Palestinians are at risk of famine in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>VOA’s State Department bureau chief Nike Ching contributed to this
report.</p>

Official in Guatemala for Talks, Says Texas Migrant Law
Unconstitutional</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Guatemala city — U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas
said Thursday that a Texas law giving state authorities the power to
arrest and deport migrants who have entered the country illegally is
unconstitutional.</p>
<p>“It is our strongly held view as a matter of law that SB4 [the Texas
law] … is unconstitutional and it is our hope and confidence that the
courts will strike it down with finality,” Mayorkas said during a joint
news conference with Guatemala President Bernardo Arevalo in the
Guatemalan capital.</p>
<p>A three-judge panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard
arguments on the Texas law Wednesday but did not rule. The law is on
hold for now.</p>
<p>Mayorkas was in Guatemala to work on the U.S.-led regional strategy
toward immigration. He described it as seeking to “build lawful, safe
and orderly pathways for people to reach safety from their place of
persecution and, at the same time, returning people to their countries
as a consequence when they do not take advantage of those lawful
pathways.”</p>
<p>Among those safe pathways is a U.S. effort to streamline the process
for those seeking U.S. asylum in the region through so-called safe
mobility offices. They allow migrants to start the process where they
are rather than making the dangerous and costly journey to the U.S.
border.</p>
<p>Guatemala’s safe mobility office, unlike some others like Colombia’s,
is only open to Guatemalans seeking U.S. protection. One of the requests
made by Mayorkas’ delegation was that Guatemala allow the safe mobility
office to process requests for migrants from other countries, according
to a Guatemalan official who requested anonymity because the issue was
still under discussion.</p>
<p>Asked during the joint news conference if the U.S. government had
asked Guatemala to sign a safe third country agreement, which
Guatemala’s previous president had agreed to during the Trump
administration, Mayorkas did not directly answer. Such an agreement
would require migrants from other countries passing through Guatemala to
seek protection from the Guatemalan government rather than at the U.S.
border.</p>
<p>Asked again in the interview with the AP, Mayorkas said that
Guatemala could be a safe destination for some migrants, but that he
deferred to Arevalo’s administration on that.</p>
<p>The U.S. has sought to improve cooperation with countries along the
migrant route, including Guatemala, Mexico, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia
and Ecuador, but Mayorkas acknowledged that it has been more challenging
in Nicaragua and Venezuela, where the U.S. has strained relations with
those governments.</p>
<p>Arévalo explained the talks in similar terms.</p>
<p>“We are operating under the principle that the immigration phenomenon
is a regional phenomenon and that for that reason has to have answers
framed in the collaborative efforts of different countries,” he
said.</p>
<p>Mayorkas also offered words of support for the Guatemalan leader,
whose election victory last year was challenged and whose party still
faces prosecution from Guatemala’s attorney general.</p>
<p>“We know that the forces of corruption continue to seek to threaten
democracy and the well-being of the people of Guatemala and beyond,”
Mayorkas said. “The United States stands with President Arevalo and his
fight for democracy against the forces of corruption and for the people
of Guatemala.”</p>

Bolstering Philippines Amid Increasing Assertiveness by China</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The U.S. and Philippines will for the first time venture
outside Manila’s territorial waters when they begin joint annual combat
drills in April, a Philippines government spokesman said Thursday.</p>
<p>Colonel Michael Logico said elements of the Balikatan 2024 drills
would be conducted about 22 kilometers (more than 12 nautical miles) off
the west coast of Palawan, an island in the archipelago nation that
faces a troubled region of the South China Sea.</p>
<p>Chinese ships this month blocked Philippine ships near the Second
Thomas Shoal, a reef about 200 kilometers (120 miles) off Palawan that
both sides claim.</p>
<p>“The message that we want to send is that we are serious about
defending our territory and we have allies,” Logico said at a news
conference, according to Philippine media.</p>
<p>Beijing claims most of the South China Sea as its own, putting it in
conflict with Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and
Vietnam, all of which border the sea. An international tribunal at The
Hague has rejected China’s claim.</p>
<p>Blinken visit</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited the Philippines this
week to bolster relations between the two countries and underscore
Washington’s commitment to Manila in the face of an increasingly
assertive China.</p>
<p>Blinken on Tuesday cited China’s “repeated violations of
international law and the rights of the Philippines: water cannons,
blocking maneuvers, close shadowing, [and] other dangerous
operations.”</p>
<p>China has been building up its military presence in the South China
Sea by building on reefs, including the disputed Scarborough Shoal,
which it effectively seized from the Philippines in 2012.</p>
<p>Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s government has defiantly
sought to assert sovereignty over disputed areas by supplying troops and
escorting fishing boats. He told Bloomberg TV on Tuesday that he was not
trying to start a conflict but “since the threat has grown, we must do
more to defend our territory.”</p>
<p>The Philippines announced last week that it would build a new port
with U.S. funding on its northern Batanes Islands, 200 kilometers (about
124 miles) from Taiwan.</p>
<p>While the port is expected to be for civilian use, analysts say it
could also be used for military purposes and play an important role in
defense — and not only for the Philippines.</p>
<p>Carl Thayer, an emeritus professor of politics at Australia’s
University of New South Wales School of Humanities and Social Sciences,
emailed VOA: “U.S. and Filipino forces in the northern Philippines would
be able to monitor and strike Chinese forces in the event a conflict
over Taiwan broke out.”</p>
<p>Beijing considers Taiwan a breakaway province that must one day
reunite with mainland China, by force if necessary, while the U.S. has
vowed to defend Taiwan’s right to self-rule.</p>
<p>But the U.S. mainland is separated from the Taiwan Strait by about
11,000 kilometers (6,000 nautical miles), while mainland China is
roughly 160 kilometers (100 miles) from the democratic island.</p>
<p>‘Positive impact’ for Taiwan</p>
<p>Although the U.S. has military bases that are closer to Taiwan in
Hawaii, about 8,150 kilometers (4,400 nautical miles); Guam, about 2,780
kilometers (1,500 nautical miles); and Okinawa, about 740 kilometers
(400 nautical miles), analysts say the closer its military assets are to
Taiwan, the faster they can respond and resupply in the event of a
Chinese attack.</p>
<p>“While the Philippines may not change the situation in the Taiwan
Strait, the greater interest in the Philippines by Washington and Tokyo
will have a positive impact on Taiwan’s security,” said Thomas J.
Shattuck, the senior program manager at the University of Pennsylvania’s
Perry World House, in an email to VOA.</p>
<p>“It will increase U.S. assets in Taiwan’s south,” Shattuck said. “It
will make it harder for China to dominate in the ‘southern theater’ of a
possible Taiwan conflict. But again, there is more work to be done in
this regard.”</p>
<p>Marcos last year said the U.S. military would be allowed to use four
new military bases in the Philippines, in addition to five where they
are already allowed, for training, building infrastructure and
pre-positioning supplies, though the access would not be permanent.</p>
<p>Although many countries in the Indo-Pacific region receive U.S.
military assistance, the Philippines receives the most.  From 2015 to
2022, Manila received more than $1.14 billion worth of aircraft, armored
vehicles, small arms, equipment and training, $475 million of it in
aid.</p>
<p>Blinken’s trip to the Philippines marks the second time a senior U.S.
Cabinet official has visited the nation this month. On March 11, U.S.
Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo announced fresh investments from U.S.
firms of more than $1 billion in the archipelago nation.</p>
<p>Despite China’s more assertive moves in the South China Sea, the
Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies’ Gregory
Poling argues Beijing has lost momentum. Poling, who is senior fellow
and director of CSIS’s Southeast Asia Program and Asia Maritime
Transparency Initiative, notes that since 2022, Southeast Asian nations
such as the Philippines have stopped giving ground to China.</p>
<p>At the same time, he writes in Eurasia Review, Indonesia, Malaysia,
the Philippines and Vietnam have resumed development of infrastructure
and oil and gas fields in the disputed region, despite China’s
objections.</p>
<p>China’s provocative moves are one of the main topics expected to be
on the agenda in April when President Joe Biden hosts a historic summit
with Marcos and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.</p>

id="creature-named-for-kermit-the-frog-offers-clues-on-amphibian-evolution">Creature
Named for Kermit the Frog Offers Clues on Amphibian Evolution</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — There definitely were no Muppets during the Permian
Period, but there was a Kermit — or at least a forerunner of modern
amphibians that has been named after the celebrity frog.</p>
<p>Scientists on Thursday described the fossilized skull of a creature
called Kermitops gratus that lived in what is now Texas about 270
million years ago. It belongs to a lineage believed to have given rise
to the three living branches of amphibians — frogs, salamanders and
limbless caecilians.</p>
<p>While only the skull, measuring around 3 cm long, was discovered, the
researchers think Kermitops had a stoutly built salamander-like body
roughly 15-18 cm long, though salamanders would not evolve for another
roughly 100 million years.</p>
<p>Amphibians are one of the four groups of living terrestrial
vertebrates, along with reptiles, birds and mammals. The unique features
of the Kermitops skull — a blend of archaic and more advanced features —
are providing insight into amphibian evolution.</p>
<p>“Kermitops helps us understand the early history of amphibians by
revealing there isn’t a clear trend of step by step becoming more like
the modern amphibian,” said Calvin So, a George Washington University
paleontology doctoral student and lead author of the study published in
the Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society.</p>
<p>The fossil was collected in 1984 near Lake Kemp in Texas and kept in
the expansive collection of the Smithsonian Institution’s National
Museum of Natural History in Washington but was not thoroughly studied
until recently.</p>
<p>Kermitops had a rounded snout, not unlike frogs and salamanders.
Preserved in its eye sockets were palpebral bones, or eyelid bones, a
feature absent in today’s amphibians. Its skull is constructed of
roof-like bones, in contrast to the thin and strut-like bones of modern
amphibians.</p>
<p>“The length of the skull in front of the eyes is longer than the
length of the skull behind the eyes, which differs from the other fossil
amphibians living at the same time. We think this might have allowed
Kermitops to snap its jaws closed faster, enabling capture of fast
insect prey,” So said.</p>
<p>The fossil record of early amphibians and their forerunners is
spotty, making it difficult to figure out the origins of modern
amphibians.</p>
<p>“Kermitops, with its unique anatomy, really exemplifies the
importance of continuing to add new fossil data to understanding this
evolutionary problem,” said National Museum of Natural History
paleontologist and study co-author Arjan Mann.</p>
<p>Kermit the Frog was created by the late American puppeteer Jim Henson
in 1955, and a Kermit puppet made in the 1970s is in the collection of
the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History as an important
cultural object.</p>
<p>Kermitops means “Kermit face,” a nod to the Muppet’s humorous
look.</p>
<p>“We thought that the eyelid bones gave the fossil a bug-eyed look,
and combined with a lopsided smile produced by slight crushing during
the preservation of the fossil, we really thought it looked like Kermit
the Frog,” So said.</p>
<p>Kermitops belonged to a group called temnospondyls that arose a few
tens of millions of years after the first land vertebrates evolved from
fish ancestors. The biggest temnospondyls superficially resembled
crocodiles, including two that each were around 6 meters in length,
Prionosuchus and Mastodonsaurus.</p>
<p>Temnospondyls are considered the progenitor lineage of modern
amphibians, Mann said.</p>
<p>Kermitops existed about 20 million years before the worst mass
extinction in Earth’s history and about 40 million years before the
first dinosaurs. It lived alongside other members of the amphibian
lineage as well as the impressive sail-backed Dimetrodon, a predator
related to the mammalian lineage.</p>
<p>The environment in which Kermitops lived appears to have alternated
between warm and humid seasons and hot and arid seasons.</p>
<p>“This environment would be similar to modern-day monsoons that take
place in the Southwest U.S. and Southeast Asia,” So said.</p>
