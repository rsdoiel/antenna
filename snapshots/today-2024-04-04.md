## Biden heralds 75th anniversary of NATO’s founding

date: 2024-04-04, from: VOA News USA

White House — President Joe Biden welcomed NATO’s 75th anniversary Thursday, as the security alliance hosted new member Sweden for the first time at a major meeting – and as Ukraine eagerly hopes for an invitation to join at an upcoming Washington summit. 


Biden, in a statement, welcomed the recent addition of new members Finland and Sweden, saying “we must choose to protect this progress and build on it.”


“This is the greatest military alliance in the history of the world,” Biden said. “But it didn’t happen by accident, nor was it inevitable. Generation after generation, the United States and our fellow Allies have chosen to come together to stand up for freedom and push back against aggression — knowing we are stronger, and the world is safer, when we do.”


Biden’s Democratic allies agreed.  




“Despite Putin’s attempts to splinter our alliance with his war against Ukraine, the transatlantic partnership is more united than ever before, thanks to the determined leadership of Joe Biden,” said former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. “On this monumental anniversary, we reaffirm that America's commitment to NATO remains bipartisan and ironclad – and that we will never waver in our defense of democracy.”


NATO allies have been increasingly unnerved by the prospect of former Republican President Donald Trump returning to the White House if he defeats Biden in the November 5 U.S. presidential election. 


As president, Trump frequently complained that numerous NATO countries were not meeting NATO’s recommendation that they spend 2% of their country’s economic output on defense.  


In February, at a campaign rally, Trump recounted what he said was a conversation he had when he was the U.S. leader with the "president of a big country."




"Well sir, if we don't pay, and we're attacked by Russia - will you protect us?" Trump quoted the unnamed leader as saying.


"I said: 'You didn't pay? You're delinquent?' He said: 'Yes, let's say that happened.' No, I would not protect you. In fact, I would encourage them (Russia) to do whatever the hell they want. You got to pay," Trump said.


Some analysts argue that the alliance remains relevant, citing Russia’s aggression in Ukraine. 


“Nearly a billion people sleep more soundly at night under NATO’s protective umbrella,” Robert Benson,  a senior policy analyst at the Center for American Progress, said in a message sent to VOA. “Yet a small but vocal minority views the alliance as a relic of the past, an albatross, or a distraction –– all this in a world where Russian imperial ambition has once again threatened international peace and security. The United States must continue to support Ukraine and to strengthen NATO, not out of charity or moral obligation, but because it makes us safer here at home."


The United States will host NATO's 75th anniversary summit in Washington in July.

## An Electric Minivan Might Be the Perfect Car

date: 2024-04-04, from: Heatmap News

New <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/03/ev-buyers-want-suvs-and-sedans-not-minivans-or-trucks-survey-says/" target="_blank">polling</a> released last week by the car publication Edmunds found that U.S. car shoppers want more range, they want more affordable options, and they want lots of SUVs and crossovers. Few respondents were excited about electric pickup trucks. Hardly anybody — just 5% — wanted a minivan EV.<br/></p><p>Poor, poor <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srpwqf2MWAw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pitiful</a> minivan. Even as its bigger sibling undergoes a renaissance as the road-tripping influencer’s ride of choice, few people are out there posting thirsty #MinivanLife pics of a Chrysler Town & Country. People are importing <a href="https://jalopnik.com/people-are-buying-worn-out-200-kei-vans-for-2-000-in-1846408604" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">vintage Japanese microvans</a> and embracing other oddball shapes to stand out against a world full of Toyota RAV4s. Yet, despite ongoing rumblings about a <a href="https://www.carscoops.com/2023/08/opinion-the-minivan-comeback-makes-total-sense/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">comeback</a>, the true minivan remains mired in tired stereotypes: It is the dorky dadmobile that appears in your driveway the day you buy a white pair of New Balance sneakers.</p><p>The thing is, a minivan is exactly what people want. And in the EV age, it could get even better.</p><p>Heatmap’s Shift Key podcast recently <a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-episode-8-rivian-minivans" target="_self">compared</a> the biological concept of carcinization — the way <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-do-animals-keep-evolving-into-crabs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">everything wants to become a crab</a> — to the convergent evolution of cars. In Robinson Meyer’s metaphor, automotive designs keep coming back to the minivan. After all, it has the primary features most families seek, namely three-row seating and lots of cargo space for kid stuff. But because the minivan is a loathed emblem of domesticity, carmakers continue to disguise its function in other forms.</p><p>This has been going on for generations. The bulbous station wagon, effectively a shorter minivan, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/04/heres-why-its-high-time-for-a-minivan-renaissance/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">was once</a> the country’s de facto family car. Its parental uncoolness led to the rise of the minivan — which then became loaded with its own “soccer mom” cultural baggage and fell out of favor. In the 1990s, parents in search of a hipper, rugged alternative embraced the squared-off SUV instead. Three decades later, those boxes on wheels have mostly morphed into the rounded crossovers that dominate the roads today — vehicles that are, fundamentally, just minivans stretched into a shape that shouts, “I am anything but.”</p><p>Tastes change, of course. And if Americans are going to switch to electric cars, then it’s imperative the car companies electrify the vehicles they want. The problem with the never-ending SUV-crossover craze is that minivans are objectively better for the lives we actually lead. </p><p>A minivan handles better because it generally has a lower center of gravity than high-riding SUVs, which were built as if their owners were going to ford a riverbed on the way to their middle child’s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=451489140488780" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">xylophone recital</a>. This is one reason car journalists have continued to praise the minivan over the years even as car buyers have spurned them.</p><p>Minivans have a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/189mzbr/minivans_are_by_far_the_best_all_purpose_vehicles/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">variety</a> of other <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/uabls0/mini_vans_are_by_far_the_best_vehicle/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">features</a> that make them better family cars than crossovers are. They’re roomy. They’re easy to get into and out of, especially when you’re loading or unloading children or car seats. The sliding doors prevent your offspring from dinging the next car over in the parking lot. </p><p>But because minivans have only a cult following these days and don’t sell big numbers, the electrified options are few. Online discussions about the best EV family car often come back to the plug-in hybrid Chrysler Pacifica because three-row EV crossovers are still rare and the all-electric <a href="https://www.vw.com/en/models/id-buzz.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Volkswagen ID.Buzz</a>, a revival of the old VW bus that would be America’s first mainstream minivan EV, hasn’t arrived yet. </p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

A long, heavy battery slung along the bottom of a van will add to its low center of gravity while providing a large number of kilowatt-hours. The voluminous cargo space inside EV minivans (and full-size vans like the electric <a href="https://insideevs.com/reviews/707294/mercedes-esprinter-first-drive-review/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sprinter</a>) will give small businesses a way to decarbonize. A fun bonus of EV life is being able to use the battery’s electricity to power the climate control and other accessories without having to run a combustion engine the whole time. That makes it easier to keep the whole family happy even if you’re waiting in the parking lot, and it will make the cabin an enjoyable place to kill time once AI starts doing all the driving.

The Kia EV9 has introduced a true three-row crossover EV to the U.S., and more like it will soon follow. It stands to reason that, eventually, today’s minivan standards like the Toyota Sienna and Honda Odyssey will electrify alongside everything else, creating a battery-powered offering for the small but growing <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/02/success/minivans-cool-again/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">niche</a> populated by van people. </p><p>Still, the minivan deserves better. Perhaps when its EV version finally arrives, drivers will get bored of the conformist crossover and realize that the electric van can.</p>

## Marine protected areas boost local economies, study finds

date: 2024-04-04, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Banning fishing and other human activity in marine protected areas (MPAs) has long pitted environmentalists against fishing interests, but a new study shows that nearby fisheries benefit from these areas.


The study comes as the United States considers establishing the world’s largest MPA in the Pacific Ocean southwest of Hawaii, waters where “fishing remains a major contributor to food security … and income generation,” according to a review by the science journal BMC Public Health. 


Mark Costello, a professor of biosciences and aquaculture at Norway’s Nord University and the study’s author, reviewed 51 studies of MPAs. He found that 39 of them showed increased catch in adjacent fisheries since their MPA designation. 


The National Geographic Society estimates that approximately 5,000 MPAs exist worldwide, covering 0.8% of the world’s oceans. 


Costello says the study’s data provides economic incentives for the Conference of Parties Global Biodiversity Framework goal set in 2022 of preserving 30% of the ocean by 2030.  


“If we think of [MPAs] as a benefit to fisheries, this completely changes the conversation from setting aside 30% that nobody can do anything with to actually 30% that is like having money in the bank,” Costello said in an interview with VOA via Zoom on March 27.


He said traditional Indigenous communities often protect certain areas so fish can spawn because they want to be sure that fish are available “in a time of maybe crisis due to other food supplies not being available.” 


Fish in protected areas “grow older, they’ll have more eggs, and they’ll spill over to the adjacent areas. So, you get those benefits,” Costello added.


Last year, the United States took a big step in trying to meet that 30% goal.


In March 2023, U.S. President Joe Biden proposed a marine sanctuary in the remote Pacific islands of nearly 2 million square kilometers, saying it would be “the largest protected ocean area on the planet.”




The Marine Conservation Institute’s Marine Protection Atlas shows the Ross Sea Region MPA as the largest MPA covering 1.9 million square kilometers.


Biden’s proposed MPA is bigger than the 1.5 million-square-kilometer reserve President Barack Obama established in 2016, a sanctuary that dwarfed and included the 300,000-square-kilometer sanctuary established by President George W. Bush in 2009 to protect parts of three remote Pacific island chains that are U.S. possessions.


Biden’s proposal has met with pushback in the Pacific Islands, where residents felt there wasn’t enough time for public input on a permanent change to their fishery access. 


“When you are trying to create something in perpetuity … 45 days to take that away from a people is not enough,” said J.D. Tenorio, a resident of Saipan who spoke at a May 18, 2023, public meeting held in the Northern Mariana Islands, a U.S. territory. 


According to the Marine Protection Atlas, two of the three largest MPAs are in the Pacific. They include fishing grounds off the coast of Hawaii, as well as the U.S. territories of Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands and the Marshall Islands. 


Costello says not all MPAs are permanent, adding it is important to consider the idea of reviewing the MPA designations.


“Maybe everything should be relooked at in 20 years' time,” he said. “The next generation should have a say.”


Ray Hilborn is a University of Washington professor in the School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences who serves on the Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council, which covers Hawaii, the territories of American Samoa and Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and several Pacific Remote Island Areas. 


The council opposes Biden’s proposed sanctuary, and Hilborn says MPAs are not a “silver bullet” for conservation in the Pacific region.


“Most of the MPAs in the world are being created in countries that have good fisheries management, like the United States, like Australia, like New Zealand, like Canada, and those benefits are not going to happen in those places,” he said in a Zoom interview with VOA on March 27.


Hilborn also said MPAs can hurt the fishing industry, especially when implemented in areas where overfishing is not an issue, as is the case for the Biden administration’s sanctuary proposal.


He cites a study published in the May 2020 edition of Marine Policy on the expansion of the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument in 2016. It concludes that the MPA designation triggered a drop of 7% in catch per unit of effort and a decrease of revenue per fishing trip by 9%, or $3.5 million during the first 16 months after it was enacted in June 2006.


Hilborn said the Costello study supports an “illusion that you’re really protecting” the ocean, but “the real protection comes by action. And those actions are regulating fisheries [and] reducing bycatch” — the fish caught by fleets that crews can’t sell, don’t want or are not allowed to keep.

## Understanding AP and RSS

date: 2024-04-04, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>What does ActivityPub does that RSS doesn't?</p>
<p>Off the top of my head, it's not the ability to syndicate, RSS already does that. I can follow anyone on any server. </p>
<p>I think it's the timeline? And the ability to delete posts. Keeping all that in sync is a lot of work, and presumably a lot of traffic? </p>
<p>Also replies. If I reply to a post when viewing it on another server, the reply should show up under any other view of that post.</p>
<p>What else??</p>
<p>PS: Only thinking about features that are used by Mastodon to federate, not potential future features. If that were the rule, then RSS could do anything AP could do, right -- because you can always add the feature. So, just the features that are in use.</p>
<p>PPS: I posted this <a href="https://mastodon.social/@davew/112213481032208332">on Mastodon</a> and may post it elsewhere, if I do I'll link them in here. </p>

## Death is a Feature

date: 2024-04-04, from: Doc Searls (at Harvard), New Old Blog

When Parisians got tired of cemeteries during the French Revolution, they conscripted priests to relocate bones of more than six million deceased forebears to empty limestone quarries below the city: a hundred miles of rooms and corridors now called The Catacombes. It was from those quarries that much of the city’s famous structures above—Notre Dame, et. al.—were built [&#8230;]

Agriculture expansion is another major driver of losses. Overall, tropical forest loss last year hit 3.7 million hectares, which is like losing 10 soccer fields per minute. This deforestation resulted in 2.4 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide being released into the atmosphere. For comparison, that’s about half the total annual emissions produced by the entire United States. The report also looks at tree cover outside the tropics, and finds that Canada’s devastating wildfires increased global tree cover loss by 24%.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

## 2024-04-04 An eye for an eye

date: 2024-04-04, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-04-04-an-eye-for-an-eye">2024-04-04 An eye for an eye</h1>

<p>I often think about the number of dead killed in an incident and the number of dead killed in the reaction.
It&rsquo;s not really revenge but a sort of &ldquo;we can strike back so we should&rdquo; and then people don&rsquo;t know when to stop.</p>

<p>Personally, I find that &ldquo;an eye for an eye&rdquo; is terrible advice.</p>

<p>I have no words for &ldquo;a hundred eyes for an eye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Think about Gaza in 2024: over 30,000 dead in half a year.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As of 5 March 2024, over 31,000 people (30,228 Palestinian and 1,410 Israeli) have been reported as killed in the Israel–Hamas war, including 94 journalists (89 Palestinian, 2 Israeli and 3 Lebanese) and over 136 UNRWA aid workers.</p>

<p>On 7 October 2023, 1,139 Israelis and foreign nationals, including 764 civilians, were killed, and 248 persons taken hostage during the initial attack on Israel from the Gaza Strip. – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Israel–Hamas_war">Casualties of the Israel Hamas war</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>30228 Palestinians dead after the original incident killed 1139 is more than 25:1.</p>

<p>I wonder about Iraq, too: 300,000 dead in over 20 years.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Documented civilian deaths from violence: 187,116 – 210,566</p>

<p>Total violent deaths including combatants: 300,000 – <a href="https://www.iraqbodycount.org/">Iraq Body Count</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And why?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Another justification included the alleged connection between the regime of Saddam Hussein and that of terrorist organizations such as Al-Qaeda that had attacked the United States during the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_invasion_of_Iraq">2003 invasion of Iraq</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The original incident:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Excluding the hijackers, the attacks killed 2,977 people, injured thousands more … – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks">September 11 attacks</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>300,000 dead after the original incident killed 2,977 is more than 100:1.</p>

<p>The two seem somehow related, I just can&rsquo;t put it into words. High tech weapons against civilians, drones, city warfare, a population that hates the invader, news so terrible I can&rsquo;t even finish reading the Wikipedia articles.</p>

<p>Oh, and out of curiosity, I had to look up the situation in Ukraine, too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ukrainian forces: ~70,000 killed, 100,000–120,000 wounded (US estimates) … Russian forces: ~120,000 killed, 170,000–180,000 wounded (US estimates) … the United Nations confirmed that by 31 January 2024, 10,378 civilians had been killed and 19,632 had been injured, but said they believe the real number is higher. – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War">Casualties of the Russo-Ukrainian War</a></p>

## The Biden Administration Is Unleashing $20 Billion for Green Banks

This is the official launch of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, a $27 billion program that was part of the Inflation Reduction Act — in fact, it is the single largest and most flexible program in the IRA. (The remaining $7 billion is earmarked for “<a href="https://www.epa.gov/greenhouse-gas-reduction-fund/solar-all" target="_blank">Solar for All</a>,” a separate initiative that will launch later this year.)<br/></p><p>The money will go to eight organizations and help “create a national clean financing network for clean energy and climate solutions.” The awardees include:</p><ul><li>The Coalition for Green Capital, a nonprofit that got $5 billion to help leverage a network of green lenders. More than 50% of its work under the grant will be aimed at low-income communities.</li><li>Rewiring America, which will share a $2 billion award with four other housing and community-building groups, including Enterprise Community Partners, LISC (Local Initiatives Support Corporation), Habitat for Humanity, and United Way to create a national financing program to decarbonize housing. The initiative will focus 75% of its investments in low-income and disadvantaged communities.</li><li>Community Preservation Corporation, a U.S. Treasury Department-certified community development financial institution and part of an umbrella coalition known as the Climate United Fund. Together with other nonprofit financial institutions, it will receive nearly $7 billion to lend to traditionally underserved populations, including rural and Tribal communities.</li></ul><p>The general idea is to funnel the money into green lending programs, colloquially known as “green banks,” that will offer low-cost loans and other financing options for consumers, community organizations, businesses, and local governments. Projects financed through the fund could do everything from residential electrification, to green public transit, to solar on schools, to storm water management. </p><p>EPA anticipates the awardees will mobilize $7 of private capital for every $1 of federal funds — a total investment of nearly $150 billion. Each of the winners will get access to their share of the funding in the next six months, and will have until 2031 to use it.</p>

## White House shows no indication of restricting weapons for Israel

date: 2024-04-04, from: VOA News USA

washington — U.S. weapons sales to Israel have been under increased scrutiny amid outrage over the reported deaths of tens of thousands of people in Gaza since the start of the war, including seven aid workers killed in an Israeli airstrike this week.


President Joe Biden said in a statement on Tuesday that he was "outraged and heartbroken" by the deaths, his latest stern rebuke of Israel's war conduct.


Israel said the strike was "unintentional" and promised an investigation.


On Wednesday, Biden ignored questions about whether he would put conditions on U.S. military aid. His aides suggest the administration is unlikely to do so, citing U.S. support for Israel's right to defend itself against the "still viable threat" from Hamas.


The administration will wait for results of Israel's investigation, National Security Council communications adviser John Kirby told reporters Wednesday. "I'm not going to get ahead of decisions that haven't been made yet," he said.


In an interview with Reuters on Wednesday, World Central Kitchen founder Jose Andres accused Israel of targeting the group's food convoy "systematically, car by car." He said he had established clear communication with the Israeli military about his aid workers' movements.


Andres is a celebrity chef who is well-known in Washington. That and the fact that the victims included U.S.-Canadian citizen Jacob Flickinger has added a new level of outrage, including among lawmakers of Biden's own Democratic Party, and renewed demands that the president condition military aid to Israel.


"Israel has killed more than 200 aid workers in 6 months. That's not an accident. No more aid for Netanyahu's war machine," Democratic Senator Bernie Sanders said in a social media post Tuesday.




Weapons transfer 


Israel is the largest recipient of U.S. aid, nearly $4 billion a year, most of it in the form of military assistance.


Under U.S. law, the administration must notify Congress of weapons transfers to Israel that are worth more than $25 million.




In December, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken approved two emergency weapons transfers to Israel, bypassing the congressional review requirement for foreign military sales.


Since the October 7 Hamas attack, two additional transfers have been made public, said Josh Paul, former director at the State Department agency that handles weapons transfers, who resigned in October in protest over the U.S.'s "continued lethal assistance to Israel."


Those two were made under the direct commercial sales process and Congress was notified, Paul told VOA. "But with less visibility, because there is less information that is provided to the public on direct commercial sales," he said.


In addition to the four that were made public, since October 7 more than 100 arms transfers to Israel have taken place without informing Congress, mainly because the packages were structured to fall below the notification threshold, according to reporting by The Washington Post, which VOA confirmed with a Department of Defense official who spoke on condition of anonymity.


Ari Tolany, director of security assistance, arms trade and technology at the Center for International Policy, said the moves amount to a "deliberate dodge of transparency" by the administration.


"When they are publicly saying that Israel needs to take more steps to protect civilians but privately pushing through hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of weapons, there's really no credibility," she told VOA.


The Biden administration refuses to use the most significant source of leverage it has, she said, which is "the massive amount of arms provided to Israel."


The Post reported that the transfers included billions of dollars in bombs and fighter jets in recent weeks, even as the administration publicly criticized Israel's intention for a ground invasion of Rafah, where 1.5 million displaced Palestinians seek safety.


Unconditional support 


Since Harry Truman recognized Israel minutes after its founding in 1948, American presidents have supported the country.


Almost all have done so unconditionally, with the exception of President George H.W. Bush, who in 1991 gave Israel an ultimatum to freeze settlements on Palestinian land in exchange for $10 billion in loan guarantees.


That approach worked. But not all agree that restricting aid will effect change.


"The emotive issue of providing for a country's means for their own defense can sometimes trigger different responses in different theaters. It's just been a sort of inexact tool for the U.S in the past," said Grant Rumley, a senior fellow specializing in military and security affairs at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.


"I think that's internalized within this administration right now," he told VOA. "That, coupled with the president's long-standing commitment to Israel, is why you haven't seen any real steps taken on this route."


There is also the fear that putting conditions on aid may send the wrong signal to Hezbollah and other Iranian proxies, increasing the prospects of opening a second front to the conflict at Israel's northern border with Lebanon.


In March, to meet the Biden administration's requirement set out in February, Israel provided assurances that American weapons are used in accordance with international and humanitarian law, which the administration accepted.


Those assurances are "not credible," said Human Rights Watch and Oxfam. The rights groups submitted examples of what they call Israeli violations of international humanitarian law, including "deprivation of services critical to the survival of the civilian population, and arbitrary denial and restrictions of humanitarian aid."


Eighty Muslim and Arab American organizations sent a similar letter to Biden on Wednesday, objecting to his "administration's decisions to falsely declare that Israel's war on Gaza complies with U.S. legal requirements and authorize the continued transfer of U.S.-manufactured weapons."


The groups cited the attacks on the World Central Kitchen aid workers as the latest example of Israel's violation of the laws of war.

## Scathing federal report rips Microsoft for response to Chinese hack

date: 2024-04-04, from: VOA News USA

BOSTON — In a scathing indictment of Microsoft corporate security and transparency, a Biden administration-appointed review board issued a report Tuesday saying "a cascade of errors" by the tech giant let state-backed Chinese cyber operators break into email accounts of senior U.S. officials including Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo.


The Cyber Safety Review Board, created in 2021 by executive order, describes shoddy cybersecurity practices, a lax corporate culture and a lack of sincerity about the company's knowledge of the targeted breach, which affected multiple U.S. agencies that deal with China.


It concluded that "Microsoft's security culture was inadequate and requires an overhaul" given the company's ubiquity and critical role in the global technology ecosystem. Microsoft products "underpin essential services that support national security, the foundations of our economy, and public health and safety."


The panel said the intrusion, discovered in June by the State Department and dating to May, "was preventable and should never have occurred," and it blamed its success on "a cascade of avoidable errors." What's more, the board said, Microsoft still doesn't know how the hackers got in.


The panel made sweeping recommendations, including urging Microsoft to put on hold adding features to its cloud computing environment until "substantial security improvements have been made."


It said Microsoft's CEO and board should institute "rapid cultural change," including publicly sharing "a plan with specific timelines to make fundamental, security-focused reforms across the company and its full suite of products."


In a statement, Microsoft said it appreciated the board's investigation and would "continue to harden all our systems against attack and implement even more robust sensors and logs to help us detect and repel the cyber-armies of our adversaries."


In all, the state-backed Chinese hackers broke into the Microsoft Exchange Online email of 22 organizations and more than 500 individuals around the world — including the U.S. ambassador to China, Nicholas Burns — accessing some cloud-based email boxes for at least six weeks and downloading some 60,000 emails from the State Department alone, the 34-page report said. Three think tanks and foreign government entities, including a number of British organizations, were among those compromised, it said.


The board, convened by Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas in August, accused Microsoft of making inaccurate public statements about the incident — including issuing a statement saying it believed it had determined the likely root cause of the intrusion "when, in fact, it still has not." Microsoft did not update that misleading blog post, published in September, until mid-March, after the board repeatedly asked if it planned to issue a correction, it said.


Separately, the board expressed concern about a separate hack disclosed by the Redmond, Washington, company in January, this one of email accounts — including those of an undisclosed number of senior Microsoft executives and an undisclosed number of Microsoft customers — and attributed to state-backed Russian hackers.


The board lamented "a corporate culture that deprioritized both enterprise security investments and rigorous risk management."


The Chinese hack was initially disclosed in July by Microsoft in a blog post and carried out by a group the company calls Storm-0558. That same group, the panel noted, has been engaged in similar intrusions — compromising cloud providers or stealing authentication keys so it can break into accounts — since at least 2009, targeting companies including Google, Yahoo, Adobe, Dow Chemical and Morgan Stanley.


Microsoft noted in its statement that the hackers involved are "well-resourced nation state threat actors who operate continuously and without meaningful deterrence."


The company said that it recognized that recent events "have demonstrated a need to adopt a new culture of engineering security in our own networks," and added that it had "mobilized our engineering teams to identify and mitigate legacy infrastructure, improve processes, and enforce security benchmarks."

However, one of the speakers was a friend of mine, so I went to support him. Toulouse is my hometown, so I bumped into a few people I knew. It was a nice evening.
I chatted with an old office mate from when I interned at INSA Toulouse.

## Judge denies Trump's request to delay his April 15 hush money trial

date: 2024-04-03, from: VOA News USA

new york  — A New York judge on Wednesday denied Donald Trump's bid to delay his April 15 trial on charges stemming from hush money paid to a porn star until the U.S. Supreme Court reviews claim to presidential immunity in a separate criminal case.  


The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear on April 25 the former U.S. president's arguments that he is immune from federal prosecution for trying to overturn his 2020 election defeat to President Joe Biden.  


His defense lawyers in the New York case in March asked Justice Juan Merchan to delay the trial until that review was complete, arguing it was relevant because prosecutors were seeking to present evidence of statements Trump made while he was president from 2017 to 2021.  


In a court ruling on Wednesday, Merchan said Trump had waited too long to raise the issue.  


"Defendant had myriad opportunities to raise the claim of presidential immunity well before March 7, 2024," Merchan wrote.  


Todd Blanche, a lawyer for Trump, declined to comment. 


Trump, the Republican candidate to challenge Biden in the November 5 election, has pleaded not guilty in each of the four criminal indictments he faces.  


The New York case could be the only one to go to trial before the election.  


He is accused of falsifying business records to cover up his former lawyer Michael Cohen's $130,000 payment to porn star Stormy Daniels for her silence before the 2016 election about a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump in 2006.  


Trump denies any such encounter with Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford.  


Trump also is seeking a delay on the basis that a deluge of news coverage of the case has led potential jurors to believe he is already guilty. Merchan has not yet ruled on that request.  


Prosecutors with Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office, which charged Trump in 2023, opposed that request in a court filing made public on Wednesday. 


They argued that Trump himself had generated much of the news coverage, and that they would be able to weed out biased jurors through the jury selection process. 


The Supreme Court's decision to take up Trump's appeal in the federal election interference case was a major victory for him, delaying the trial's start by months at least.  


He also faces a state case in Georgia over his efforts to reverse the 2020 election results, as well as a federal case in Florida over his handling of sensitive government documents after leaving office in 2021. Those cases also lack firm trial dates. 


No U.S. president has ever faced a criminal trial.

## US says UN not venue to negotiate Palestinian statehood

date: 2024-04-03, from: VOA News USA

Washington — The United States on Wednesday opposed a Palestinian push for full membership at the United Nations, with Washington saying it backed statehood but after negotiations with Israel. 


"We support the establishment of an independent Palestinian state," U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters. 


"That is something that should be done through direct negotiations through the parties, something we are pursuing at this time, and not at the United Nations," he said, without explicitly saying that the United States would veto the bid if it reached the Security Council. 


Miller said that U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has been actively engaged in establishing "security guarantees" for Israel as part of the groundwork for a Palestinian state. 


U.S. President Joe Biden's administration has increasingly highlighted support for a Palestinian state, with a reformed Palestinian Authority in charge in the West Bank and Gaza, as it looks for a way to close the ongoing war in which its ally Israel is seeking to eliminate Hamas from the Gaza Strip. 


Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has for decades resisted a Palestinian state and leads a far-right government with members hostile to the Palestinian Authority, which holds limited autonomy in sections of the West Bank. 


Under longstanding legislation by the U.S. Congress, the United States is required to cut off funding to U.N. agencies that give full membership to a Palestinian state. 


The law has been applied selectively. The United States cut off funding in 2011 and later withdrew from the U.N. cultural and scientific agency UNESCO, but Biden's administration returned, saying it was better to be present. 


Robert Wood, the U.S. deputy representative to the United Nations, said that recognition of a Palestinian state by the world body would mean "funding would be cut off to the U.N. system, so we're bound by U.S. law." 


"Our hope is that they don't pursue that, but that's up to them," Wood said of the Palestinians' bid. 


The Palestinian Authority has submitted a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres asking for the Security Council to reconsider a longstanding application for statehood in April. 


Any request to become a U.N. member state must first be recommended by the Security Council, where Israel's primary backer the United States as well as four other countries wield vetoes, and then endorsed by a two-thirds majority in the General Assembly.  


Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas launched the statehood application in 2011. It was not considered by the Security Council, but the General Assembly the following year granted observer status to the "State of Palestine."

## Tribblix image structural changes

date: 2024-04-03, from: OS News

We&#8217;ve talked about Tribblix before on OSNews &#8211; it&#8217;s a distribution of illumos, built by Peter Tribble. In his latest blog post, Tribble details some of the changes he&#8217;s made to the live ISO and other images for the most recent release. All along, there&#8217;s been an overlay (think a group package) called base-iso that lists the packages that are present in the live image. On installation, this is augmented with a few extra packages that you would expect to be present in a running system but which don&#8217;t make much sense in a live image, to construct the base system. You can add additional software, but the base is assumed to be present. The snag with this is that base-iso is very much a single-purpose generic concept. By its very nature it has to be minimal enough to not be overly bloated, yet contain as many drivers as necessary to handle the majority of systems. As such, the regular ISO image has fallen between 2 stools &#8211; it doesn&#8217;t have every single driver, so some systems won&#8217;t work, while it has a lot of unnecessary drivers for a lot of common use cases. ↫ Peter Tribble Tribble then details how he addressed this issue, which is, unsurprisingly, rather clever. I&#8217;m not going to spoil it here, so go on over and read the details.

## Improvements to static analysis in the GCC 14 compiler

date: 2024-04-03, from: OS News

I work at Red Hat on GCC, the GNU Compiler Collection.&#160;For the last five releases of GCC, I&#8217;ve been working on -fanalyzer, a static analysis pass that tries to identify various problems at compile-time, rather than at runtime. It performs &#8220;symbolic execution&#8221; of C source code—effectively simulating the behavior of the code along the various possible paths of execution through it. This article summarizes what&#8217;s new with -fanalyzer in GCC 14, which I hope will be officially released sometime in April 2024. ↫ David Malcolm No matter how many more of you become a Patreon to keep OSNews alive, I&#8217;ll never be able to really add anything meaningful to articles like these.

## KDE 6 release: D-Bus and Polkit galore

date: 2024-04-03, from: OS News

The SUSE security team restricts the installation of system wide D-Bus services and Polkit policies in openSUSE distributions and derived SUSE products. Any package that ships these features needs to be reviewed by us first, before it can be added to production repositories. In November, openSUSE KDE packagers approached us with a long list of KDE components for an upcoming KDE6 major release. The packages needed adjusted D-Bus and Polkit whitelistings due to renamed interfaces or other breaking changes. Looking into this many components at once was a unique experience that also led to new insights, which will be discussed in this article. For readers that are new to D-Bus and/or Polkit, the following sections offer a summary to get a better idea about these systems. ↫ Matthias Gerstner You don&#8217;t get these kinds of in-depth looks at how a major new release like KDE 6 gets implemented in a popular distribution like openSUSE. What&#8217;s especially crazy is that this only really covers D-Bus and Polkit, and those are just two of the countless aspects of openSUSE affected by KDE 6.

	But of course, part of the whole AI mythos is like, once it starts, you can’t stop it. There is a story out there that, frankly, you see as much from folks who are worried about the climate as you do from AI boosters, which is that very soon, we'’e going to be using a huge amount of energy on AI. And I want to ask you this directly: Should we be worried about AI, number one, overrunning the energy system? Or number two, AI causing a massive spike in carbon emissions that dooms us to, let's say, pass 2.5C that uses up the rest of our carbon budget? Is that something you're worried about? And just how do you think about this?
	<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Jonathan Koomey: </strong>Everyone needs to calm the heck down. So we talked about the original baseline, right? So the baseline, data centers are 1% of the world's electricity. And maybe AI now is 0.1%, right? For Google, it’s 0.15%, whatever. But 10% of the 1% is AI.<br/>
<br/>
	So let’s say that doubles — let’s say that triples in the next few years, or even goes up fivefold. That gets to about half a percent. So I think it will pale in comparison to the other growth drivers that Jesse was talking about in electrification. Because if you think about light vehicles, if you electrified all light vehicles in the U.S., that’s like a 20% or 25% increase in electricity consumption.And if you did that over 20 years, that’s like 1-ish% per year. Right? So that's, that to me is a very credible thing that’s likely to happen. And then when you add heat pumps, you add industrial electrification, a lot more. 
	<br/>
<br/>
	 I think there will be local impacts. There will be some places where AI and data centers more generally will be important and will drive load growth, but it is not a national story. It is a local story. And so a place like Ireland that has, I think at last count 17%, 18% of its load from data centers, if that grows, that could give them real challenges. Same thing, Loudoun County in Virginia. But you really do have to separate the national story or the global story from the local story.
	<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Jesse Jenkins:</strong> I think it was just about a week ago, Nvidia which is the leading producer of the graphics processing units that have become now the main workhorse chips for generative AI computing, they released their new best-in-class chip. And as they revealed that chip, they — for the first time, it sounded like — started to emphasize the energy efficiency improvements of the GPU. And the basic story the CEO told is that it would take about 73% less electricity and a shorter period of time to train AIs on this new chip than it did on their previous best-in-class chip. So that’s just one generation of GPU with nearly three-quarters reduction in the amount of energy consumed per ... I don't know how you measure the units of large language model training, but per smarts trained into generative AI. So yeah, huge gains. <br/>
<br/>
	And one might say, well, can that continue forever? And I guess we should maybe get your thoughts on that. But it has continued at least for the last 10 to 20 years. And so there’s a lot of reason to believe that there’s continued gains to be made.
	<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Koomey: </strong>Most people, when they think of efficiency, they think of Moore’s Law. They think of shrinking transistors. And anyone who follows this knows that every year or two, there’s another article about how Moore’s Law is ending, or slowing, or you know, it’s getting harder. And there’s no question about it, it’s absolutely getting harder and harder to shrink the transistors. But it turns out shrinking transistors is only one way to improve efficiency and performance. For a long time, the industry relied on that. <br/>
<br/>
	From the early days of microprocessors, starting in ’71, over time, they would ramp up the clock speed. And at the same time, they would ramp down the voltage of the chip. And that was called Dennard scaling. It allowed them to keep ramping up performance without getting to crazy levels of leakage current and heat and melting the chip and the whole thing. That worked for a long time, til the early 2000s. And then they hit the threshold voltage for silicon, which is like one volt. So once you hit that, you can no longer do that trick. And they needed new tricks. 
	<br/>
<br/>
	So what they did was they, most of you remember who were around at that time, there was this big shift to multiple cores on a chip. That was an innovation in hardware architecture that allowed them, for a time, to improve efficiency by going to software that could run on multiple cores, so you could multiprocess various activities. So that’s one way you can improve things. You can also work on the software — you can improve the efficiency of the software, you can improve the algorithms that you use.
	<br/>
<br/>
	So even if Moore's law shrinkage of transistors stops, which it hasn’t fully stopped. But even if it did, there are a lot of other things we can do. And AI in particular is relatively new. Basically, people threw a whole bunch of money at existing processors because there was this rush to deploy technology. But now, everyone’s stepping back and saying, well, look at the cost of the energy cost and the infrastructure cost. Is there a way to do this better? And sure, there definitely is, and Nvidia proved it in their presentation that you referred to.

## Seven Years of APFS

## U.S. Steel Is Trying Carbon Capture. Experts Aren’t Impressed.

date: 2024-04-03, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTg5OTkzMy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2MjUyNDI1Mn0.hpZIjrZ4ZFa5O-vkT3CjkP3NV4ec5rSKNirfRfiPRqc/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">Last week, the Department of Energy announced $6 billion in awards to help clean up some of the most greenhouse gas-intensive industries in the U.S., including <a href="https://www.energy.gov/oced/industrial-demonstrations-program-selections-award-negotiations-iron-and-steel" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$1.5 billion to transform iron and steel manufacturing</a>. U.S. Steel, one of the biggest American steelmakers, was not among the recipients.</p><p>On Wednesday, U.S. Steel made an announcement of its own: It is signing a 20-year agreement with CarbonFree, a Texas-based company, to capture carbon dioxide from Gary Works, the largest integrated steel mill in the country, and turn it into a marketable product. The $150 million project is the first to capture and utilize carbon from an American steel plant at a commercial scale.</p><p>Gary Works releases an ungodly amount of carbon into the air each year — more than the entire state of Vermont. CarbonFree will use its technology, known as SkyCycle, to collect 50,000 tons of CO2 from the plant per year and transform it into high grade calcium carbonate, a valuable ingredient for the food, pharmaceuticals, paint, and plastics industries.</p><p>Something certainly has to change if U.S. Steel is going to make good on its <a href="https://www.ussteel.com/roadmap-to-2050" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pledge of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050</a>, let alone stay competitive in a market that’s expected to increasingly look for greener products. It’s unclear, however, whom the company is going to convince with this project, which will capture less than 1% of the plant’s annual emissions. </p><p>“It’s deeply unserious, I think, is the words that come to mind,” Hilary Lewis, the steel director at Industrious Labs, a nonprofit that advocates for decarbonizing heavy industry, told me. The effort is especially embarrassing, she said, given that two of the company’s competitors, SSAB and Cleveland Cliffs, were awarded $500 million each by the DOE for far more transformative green steel projects. “This announcement is emblematic of how U.S. Steel is a laggard.”</p><p>U.S. Steel declined to make any of its executives available to interview for this story. In response to my request for comment, the company provided a statement that said this was a first of its kind opportunity to “significantly reduce” emissions at Gary Works, and that it was “the first step in exploring the scalability of this technology” to support the company’s goals.</p><p>CarbonFree executives, too, asserted that the Gary Works project is a stepping stone to something bigger. But outside experts I spoke with were skeptical that it would be able to scale enough to make a meaningful difference in the plant’s — or the industry’s — emissions. </p><p>The steel industry contributes about 8% of global energy-related emissions. Though the U.S. is not one of the worst offenders (we actually make some of the cleanest steel in the world) U.S. steelmakers still have a long, expensive journey ahead to decarbonize. </p><p>That’s because there are eight steel plants in the U.S. that still use blast furnaces, a dirty, coal-intensive production method. Gary Works is one of them. Though these plants only represent about 30% of the country’s steel production, they are responsible for nearly 70% of the sector’s emissions, according to the Department of Energy.</p><p>The advantage of the SkyCycle project is that it doesn’t require U.S. Steel to do very much. “We build, own, and operate the [carbon capture equipment], and we’re able to get a return based on the chemicals we sell,” Martin Keighley, the CEO of CarbonFree, told me. “So it’s a much more attractive proposition for, in this case, U.S. Steel, because they don't have to invest large amounts of money into the plant.” More attractive than at least one alternative, that is, which is to capture the carbon and sequester it underground. </p><p>It’s a compelling argument. Carbon capture and storage adds big costs — to install the equipment, transport the CO2, and pump it into the bedrock — with no financial benefit to manufacturers. While the federal government does encourage carbon capture by offering an $85 federal tax credit for every ton of CO2 captured and stored, no law compels steel companies to do so. In many cases, the subsidy may not be not enough to get investors on board for a project, especially since tax credits can come and go depending on the whims of Congress.</p><p>But if you find someone else who can take your carbon and make money off of it, then what have you got to lose? Keighley said CarbonFree will be able to earn a slightly smaller federal tax credit — $60 — for every ton of carbon it turns into calcium carbonate, but that the company’s business model doesn’t depend on that.</p><p>“You know, we all look at 2050 and net zero, but it doesn't stop there. To be net zero, we’re still emitting CO2, so we still have to capture it,” he said, referring to the idea that the “net” in net zero implies there will continue to be emissions that must be neutralized. “We're going to be capturing forever. So, therefore, we need sustainable business models that aren’t reliant on government sources.”</p><p>One advantage of SkyCycle over other carbon capture technologies is that it works with raw, dirty flue gas, which might have all kinds of other gases and chemicals mixed in with the CO2. The gas is channeled through a series of chemical reactions and eventually reacts with calcium, a mineral that’s notoriously thirsty for CO2, to create calcium carbonate. Once it binds with calcium, the CO2 is essentially locked up permanently. It would take either very high heat or a very strong acid to remove it. </p><p>Keighley said the high grade calcium carbonate on the market today has much greater emissions associated with its production than CarbonFree’s process, and is about the same price. That creates a “multiplier effect,” he told me. Not only is the company reducing emissions from the Gary Works plant, it’s also reducing emissions associated with the products that incorporate the cleaner calcium carbonate. On top of that, the company is sourcing its calcium from steel slag, a waste product from the steelmaking process that nobody has really figured out what to do with. (This is different from blast furnace slag, which is valuable for decarbonizing the cement industry as a replacement for carbon-intensive “clinker.”)</p><p>So far, so good. But the issue, according to Rebecca Dell, a former Department of Energy analyst and senior director of industry at the ClimateWorks Foundation, is that the market for high grade calcium carbonate is tiny. “You’re gonna saturate these high end markets way before you get anywhere close to absorbing the full 8 or 9 million tons a year of CO2 that just the Gary Works is emitting,” she told me.</p><p>When I raised this with Keighley, he acknowledged that the market was limited. But he said the market for calcium carbonate in general, not just the high purity stuff, is much bigger, and that the company could move into other segments later. CarbonFree is already working on its next system, which will be capable of capturing 250,000 tons of CO2 per year. Calcium carbonate is essentially limestone, which is an abundant and cheap material, so it might be hard to compete in lower-grade markets without bringing down production costs. But Keighley mentioned another plan. “The beauty is, if and when you run out of market altogether, you store it,” he told me. In other words, the company could just stash the calcium carbonate on the grounds of the Gary Works plant. That assumes, however, that they’ve brought down their costs enough to make a profit off the federal tax credit for carbon storage — and that assumes the tax credit still exists.</p><p>Lewis, of Industrious Labs, raised a different issue. “If you’re choosing to invest in carbon capture, you're locking in that reliance on coal for another 15, 20 years,” she told me. Carbon capture doesn’t address the other health-harming pollutants these steel mills rain over their surrounding community, including nitrous oxides, sulfur dioxide, and soot. She also noted that the biggest consumer of the types of steel produced by blast furnaces, the auto industry, has ambitious climate targets. While automakers have yet to make truly market-transforming commitments to buy cleaner steel, if and when they do, Gary Works could be left unprepared, threatening the job security of its more than 4,000 workers.</p><p>U.S. Steel’s plan is a stark contrast to one of the projects awarded funding by the DOE last week, Lewis said. Cleveland Cliffs, which owns five of the remaining seven blast furnace steel mills, will get $500 million to replace one of its blast furnaces at a mill in Ohio with what’s called a “direct reduced iron” plant. Direct reduction is more efficient, cleaner, and cheaper than a blast furnace; the company said it would <a href="https://www.clevelandcliffs.com/investors/news-events/press-releases/detail/629/cleveland-cliffs-selected-to-receive-575-million-in-us" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">save $150 per ton of steel produced</a> by making the switch. Though some direct reduction plants rely on natural gas, and therefore aren’t exactly carbon-free, the process can also be done with green hydrogen. That’s what a second project announced last week, led by the Swedish steelmaker SSAB, will be using at a new plant in Mississippi.</p><p>In my interview with Keighley, I asked what he thought about the criticism that this project would keep Gary Works hooked on coal for another 20 years, and that advocates wanted to see the plant transition to direct reduction. He responded by raising questions about green hydrogen. Producing green hydrogen requires lots of renewable energy, he said. Is that the best use of that renewable energy, or could you “get more decarbonization for your buck” by using it for something else?</p><p>Later, in an email, Keighley also pointed to SkyCycle’s readiness for deployment compared to the long development timelines for other solutions. Construction is expected to start as early as summer 2024, with operations beginning in 2026. He also emphasized that CarbonFree would be able to “easily” increase the size of the plant. “There’s so many different options and everyone’s trying to second guess everybody else. Just get on with doing something, you know?” </p><p>But Chris Bataille, a research fellow at the Columbia University Center on Global Energy Policy who focuses on pathways to net-zero for heavy industry, told me the tiny scope of this project is indicative of a larger issue. “These marginal changes are attractive to people who are just used to running a blast furnace their whole careers,” he said. “You can keep the rest of your plant, but that piece of equipment needs to change.”</p>

## Does Donald Trump have presidential immunity?

date: 2024-04-03, from: VOA News USA

New Orleans — The U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments this month about presidential immunity and whether former President Donald Trump can be tried on charges that he conspired to overturn the results of the 2020 election.


The high court’s decision will determine how some of the presumptive GOP nominee’s legal cases advance in an election year where he is facing 91 felony charges across four trials. They include the willful retention of national defense information in violation of the Espionage Act.


“Donald Trump is trying to show that a U.S. president is immune from criminal prosecution while acting in an official capacity,” University of Georgia political scientist Charles Bullock told VOA.


“But I think, at the heart of this matter, is just how broadly Trump and his lawyers define ‘official capacity,’” Bullock explained.


“They are defining it very broadly at the moment. Trump says a president should be completely immune while president, but the three-judge circuit panel that ruled against him posed the question: ‘Well, what if the president hired a hitman to take out one of their rivals? Is that in an official capacity, and are they immune from prosecution then, as well?’ I think we’d all say, of course not!”




Many Republicans continue to back Trump


This month’s case before the Supreme Court, which includes three Trump appointees, involves federal charges that Trump attempted to overturn the 2020 presidential election by spreading false information about voter fraud and by pressing Vice President Mike Pence to reject legitimate results when they were presented to Congress.


That congressional certification of electoral votes on January 6, 2021, was disrupted by Trump supporters who stormed the Capitol. For that attack, Trump is facing a charge of obstructing an official proceeding.


The former president argues he was acting in an official capacity at the time, and therefore cannot be charged. In its filing to the Supreme Court, Trump’s team wrote, “The president cannot function, and the presidency itself cannot retain its vital independence, if the president faces criminal prosecution for official acts once he leaves office.”



“A denial of criminal immunity would incapacitate every future president with de facto blackmail and extortion while in office,” the filing continues, “and condemn him to years of post-office trauma at the hands of political opponents.”


A Politico Magazine/Ipsos poll last month found that 70% of voters — including nearly half of Republicans — reject Trump’s argument that presidents should be immune from prosecution for crimes committed while in office.




Republican voter Jeff Williams from Valparaiso, Indiana, believes charges against Trump show he is being unfairly targeted by Democrats.


“It looks to me like these are all cases of Democrat-affiliated prosecutors in Democratic-leaning districts hoping for Democratic-slanted juries that will vote against Trump simply because they don’t like him,” Williams told VOA.


“Do I think a president should have total immunity from the law? No way,” Williams said. “But have I seen any evidence that suggests President Trump is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt? Absolutely not. This feels like a witch hunt.”


“Half of the country is going to have to justify voting for a criminal this year!”


“I can’t believe this is the situation we find ourselves in,” said Democratic voter Deborah Theobald of Woodstock, Georgia. “Half of the country is going to have to justify voting for a criminal this year!”


Fifty-five percent of Americans responding to a Reuters/Ipsos poll say they would not vote for Donald Trump if he was convicted of a felony by a jury, while 58% said they would not cast their ballot for the former president if he was currently serving time in prison.


“If a person has committed a crime while in office, and even a serious crime before office, then I think they should be prosecuted just as any other American would be,” said Rebecca Urrutia, a Connecticut mother who voted for Trump in both 2016 and 2020.


“Anyone who says that a president should have immunity from a prosecuted crime doesn’t stand for the Constitution or our country,” she said. “The president is a citizen and servant of our country, not a king or emperor, and if you break the law, I can’t vote for you.”




Impacting the coming election


It’s a turning point for the U.S. legal system and a pivotal political moment for Trump, says Robert Collins, a Dillard University professor of urban studies and public policy.


“Polling has shown that whether he is convicted or not has huge implications for the 2024 presidential election,” Collins told VOA. “But, outside of how these cases are ruled, the longer they go on, the more likely Trump avoids a guilty ruling in advance of Election Day.”


Independent voters are a pivotal group in swing states, with more than one-third telling a Politico Magazine/Ipsos poll that they are less likely to support Trump if he is convicted.


“But if a conviction doesn’t come in time for the election — or too close to the election for voters to change their mind — then Republican voters might stick with him,” Collins said. “And, if he wins the election, and is convicted afterwards, then he’ll make the case that as the sitting president, he’s able to pardon himself. It’s a dangerous situation.”


Melbourne, Florida voter Jillian Dani backed Donald Trump in 2016 and 2020 and says the results of his criminal cases will have a big impact on how she votes in November.


“On one hand, I wouldn’t vote for a felon,” Dani told VOA. “But on the other hand, I’m worried this is a witch hunt against someone the Democratic Party fears. I believe Clinton and Biden were criminals, too, but they weren’t convicted. If Trump isn’t convicted either, then why should he be treated differently?”

## US pushes back at judge over Trump claim that classified records were personal

date: 2024-04-03, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The U.S. prosecutor leading the case against Donald Trump for retaining classified documents after leaving office pushed back at a federal judge after she signaled she may accept the former president's claim that the records were his personal property. 


U.S. Special Counsel Jack Smith said in a court filing late on Tuesday that his office would appeal any decision by U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon that would instruct jurors in the case to consider what he called Trump's "fundamentally flawed legal premise." 


Trump, the Republican candidate challenging Democratic President Joe Biden in the November 5 election, pleaded not guilty last year to a 40-count indictment accusing him of illegally keeping classified documents after leaving office in 2021 and obstructing federal government efforts to retrieve them. 


Cannon, who was appointed to the bench by Trump, has signaled she is receptive to Trump's claim that he treated the documents as personal under a 1978 law called the Presidential Records Act that lets former presidents keep records that have no connection to their official responsibilities. 


Prosecutors have said the documents relate to U.S. military and intelligence matters, including details about the American nuclear program, and could not be construed as personal. 


The judge on March 18 directed the prosecution and defense to propose jury instructions based on two legal scenarios assuming Trump's argument would play a role at trial.  


One scenario, in which neither the jury nor the judge could question Trump's contention that the records are personal, would essentially direct the jury to acquit Trump, according to prosecutors. They urged Cannon to quickly decide if jurors will be told that Trump's claim is relevant to the charges against him, arguing that the prosecution must have time "to consider appellate review." 


Smith's filing said Cannon's order was based on a flawed legal premise and would "distort the trial." 


This is one of four criminal cases that Trump faces. He has pleaded not guilty in all of them and has sought to cast them as politically motivated. 


Trump's lawyers in a filing on Tuesday night reiterated their argument that what they call Trump's decision to treat the records as personal meant the charges should be tossed out before trial. 


The Presidential Records Act was passed to give the U.S. government possession of official records from a president's administration. It lets former presidents keep certain records deemed personal that have no connection to their official responsibilities. 


Trump has argued that his decision to take the material to his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida showed he treated the records as his personal property. Prosecutors have argued that the records law cannot authorize a former president to keep classified information.  


Trump faces charges that include violations of the Espionage Act, which criminalizes unauthorized possession of defense information, and conspiracy to obstruct justice. 


A May 20 trial date scheduled in the case is widely expected to be postponed.

Twitter is the place old friends who haven't heard they should find a new home are still posting. There are quite a few of them. Fact. It's kind of like what Facebook has become. There are a set of people I expect to see there regularly, and that's why I keep going back. Again, fact.

## Why Temu prices are so low

date: 2024-04-03, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>The Chinese-based platform Temu is transforming e-commerce, and it&#8217;s recently surged in popularity in the U.S. Described as being “like Amazon on steroids,” Temu’s products are often cheap and unbranded — but those low prices could be coming at high costs. Also on the program: few visible cracks in the labor market, a lack of remote work training, and an obituary for General Electric as a corporate conglomerate.</p>

## I want all the information

date: 2024-04-03, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2022/08/08/bootstrappingByEngelbart.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I want all the information about the products I make to be instantly available to anyone who wants to know, in exactly the form they want it. Until ChatGPT, that was a totally unattainable dream. But now, for many topics, it's reality. For example, if I have a question about CSS, and believe me, I do -- if I can ask the question clearly enough, I can get a clear and complete explanation of why the browser did the crazy thing with layout that it did. It means I could do something beautiful and refined like the blogroll I worked on in February and March, and the UI stuff I'm working on in March and April. </p>
<p>I can't wait until ChatGPT can answer all those questions about my stuff. But then people who make music don't want their songs to be available the same way. As someone who wants to know as much as possible about songs I have always loved but had no idea how they were made, or what they meant to the writer, knowledge about the work is equally valuable as understanding technical topics. I think the big difference is knowing that life is short, and if we want to leave something behind of ourselves, having the information be available is a blessing, not something to fight against. I don't see why software designers in the future should have to reinvent what my generation has already figured out. I don't want them to have to. It keeps coming back to this one idea -- to solve the problems we have as a species we're going to have to <i>work together, </i>and part of that means not being so guarded and selfish about sharing what we've learned. </p>
<p>We had this problem with music before, with Napster. The users of music, such as myself, found that the ability to program our own music was so liberating. To listen to a song a few times before moving on made a huge difference, or to choose a song to hear because we just thought of it for the first time in 30 years. But we were literally mocked by music promoters and artists. But ultimately, like it or not, the users got the power they wanted. It's got to happen that way too for ChatGPT et al. I guess some people must've felt that search engines were going to rob creative people of control of their creations. I guess this is something we always have to go through. </p>

## 2024-04-03 Return to the office? Never!

date: 2024-04-03, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-04-03-return-to-the-office-never">2024-04-03 Return to the office? Never!</h1>

<p><a class="account" href="https://dice.camp/@rdonoghue" title="@rdonoghue@dice.camp">@rdonoghue</a> wondered (mostly ironically, I suspect) about a correlation between the length of the commute and a propensity to favour Return To the Office (RTO) policies.</p>

<p>I used to walk 35min to the office and I still prefer the home office.</p>

<p>Based on what I saw during lockdown and based on what my wife tells me, I think more interesting options are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do you have kids at home and prefer Return To the Office? (if older)</li>
<li>Do you have parents at home and prefer Return To the Office? (if younger)</li>
<li>Do you manage a team but don&rsquo;t talk to team members individually and prefer Return To the Office because you can overhear them talk? (if project manager)</li>
<li>Do you have a need for sycophants surrounding you and prefer Return To the Office so you keep an eye on them? (ugh)</li>
</ul>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure there are more options but those seemed to be the obvious ones.</p>

<p>In all fairness:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do you have a hard time with focus and prefer the Home Office so that you&rsquo;re not exposed to noise, cross-talk and other distractions by coworkers? (me)</li>
</ul>

## Chinese state, social media echo Russian propaganda on concert hall attack

date: 2024-04-03, from: VOA News USA

Taipei, Taiwan — Specious theories designed to implicate Ukraine and the United States in connection with the late March terror attack in Russia are spreading on China’s state media outlets and on its heavily censored social media platform Weibo.


False claims that paint Kyiv and Washington as masterminds of the attack have fueled debate in Russia even after Islamic State-Khorasan — also known as IS, IS-K, ISIS and Daesh — claimed responsibility for killing at least 143 people and injuring nearly 200 at the Crocus City Hall music venue in suburban Moscow.


In China, an editorial in the state-run Global Times insinuated that “many observers linked the incident to the ‘hybrid war’ form of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.”


“Some Western thinkers have begun to speculate whether Washington had played a role in this terrorist attack,” it said without elaborating.


Without citing names or clear attribution, the Global Times repeated Russia’s false accusations that the U.S. failed to share “key intelligence” that could have helped Russian security services prevent the attack.


In fact, the U.S. warned the Russian authorities two weeks before the attack and shared appropriate intelligence, as it would do “for any other country,” John Kirby, White House national security communications adviser, told VOA.




“We provided useful, we believe, valuable information about what we thought was an imminent terrorist attack,” Kirby said. “We also warned Americans about staying away from public places like concert halls. So, we were very direct with our Russian counterparts appropriately to make sure that they had as much useful information as possible.”


Addressing a Russian intelligence agency board meeting three days before the attack, Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissed the U.S. warning as “outright blackmail” intended “to intimidate and destabilize our society.”


The Global Times also criticized Washington for being “slow to condemn the incident in a timely manner, which shocked the international community.”


In fact, the United States was among the first nations to condemn the Moscow attack, and on March 30, U.S. Ambassador to Russia Lynne Tracy placed flowers at the site.




With the Chinese Communist Party’s tight censorship of online content, contrarian views are quickly taken down, and the lack of independent media leave disinformation spread by state-controlled news outlets unchallenged.


Some, however, have voiced skepticism.


“I personally think it’s unlikely that the United States was behind this terrorist attack,” Jin Canrong, a scholar of international relations with an established “anti-American” reputation, wrote on Weibo.


The comments by Jin, who is a professor at the Renmin University of China, provoked heated reaction, with some Weibo users accusing him of being a U.S. sympathizer.


Since the attack, conspiracy theories echoing Russian propaganda have dominated the narrative on Weibo, typically boosted by anonymous pro-Russian and pro-Chinese influencers with millions of followers.


Weibo influencer Drunk Rabbit posted to his nearly half a million followers: “It is no wonder that the Russian people do not believe that this was done by IS. They all firmly believe that Ukraine and its masters who are at war with Russia planned and carried out this atrocity.”


To prove the point, the user posted two side-by-side video clips showing former U.S. Presidents Barak Obama and Donald Trump.


Drunk Rabbit​’s caption read: “Obama: ‘We trained ISIS,’” and “Trump: ‘Obama was the founder of ISIS.’”


“Both former presidents have confirmed that the United States is the creator of ISIS,” Drunk Rabbit continued. “Regarding the terrorist attack on the Moscow Concert Hall in Russia, what other evidence is needed?”


The quotes by Obama and Trump, however, are taken out of context and, in the case of Obama’s remarks, twisted to mean the opposite of what he said.


Trump’s claim has been debunked by fact-checkers and terrorism experts who traced Islamic State’s roots to 2002, six years before Obama was elected president, and Trump himself walked the remark back, calling it “sarcasm.”


It is not out of character for the Chinese state and social media to echo Russian propaganda and disinformation, especially when it targets the United States.

Snowpack is California’s largest source of stored water, so if it’s low in April – as it has been in recent years following historic droughts – residents know they should brace for water shortages in the summer months to come. On the flipside, if the snowpack is way above average, as it was last year, there’s a chance of flooding. But this year, levels are at about 110%, or just above average. Still, Governor Gavin Newsom wants residents to be mindful of their water use because “this time next year, we might be in a different place.” He said the state is preparing for a near-term future in which climate change will make water even more scarce, and is considering options like desalination and water recycling. Here is a look at how 2015 snowpack (top) compares to this year’s snowpack (bottom):

## The financial wisdom of having multiple generations under one roof

date: 2024-04-03, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>Multigenerational living arrangements began to decline in the 1950s, thanks to the growth of suburbs, new job opportunities for those willing to move and the rise of senior housing. Yet from 1971 to 2021, the number of people living in multigenerational family households quadrupled. Why? Housing affordability plays a big role. But first: How might Taiwan&#8217;s major earthquake impact the global supply chain for semiconductor chips?</p>

## How Stability AI’s founder tanked his billion-dollar startup

date: 2024-04-03, from: OS News

It was Stability’s armada of GPUs, the wildly powerful and equally expensive chips undergirding AI, that were so taxing the company’s finances. Hosted by AWS, they had long been one of Mostaque’s bragging points; he often touted them as one of the world’s 10 largest supercomputers. They were responsible for helping Stability’s researchers build and maintain one of the top AI image generators, as well as break important new ground on generative audio, video and 3D models. “Undeniably, Stability has continued to ship a lot of models,” said one former employee. “They may not have profited off of it, but the broader ecosystem benefitted in a huge, huge way.” But the costs associated with so much compute were now threatening to sink the company. According to an internal October financial forecast seen by Forbes, Stability was on track to spend $99 million on compute in 2023. It noted as well that Stability was “underpaying AWS bills for July (by $1M)” and “not planning to pay AWS at the end of October for August usage ($7M).” Then there were the September and October bills, plus $1 million owed to Google Cloud and $600,000 to GPU cloud data center CoreWeave. (Amazon, Google and CoreWeave declined to comment.) ↫ Kenrick Cai and Iain Martin As a Dutch person, I can smell a popping bubble from a mile away, even if tulipmania is most likely anti-Dutch British propaganda. In all seriousness, there&#8217;s definitely signs that the insane energy and compute costs of artificial image and video generation in particular are rising at such an insane pace it&#8217;s simply unsustainable for the popularity of these tools to just keep rising. Eventually someone&#8217;s going to have to pay, and I wonder just how much regular people are willing to pay for this kind of stuff.

## Amazon’s ‘Just Walk Out’ checkout system consisted of 1000 people in India watching you shop

date: 2024-04-03, from: OS News

Amazon is phasing out its checkout-less grocery stores with “Just Walk Out” technology, first reported by The Information Tuesday. The company’s senior vice president of grocery stores says they’re moving away from Just Walk Out, which relied on cameras and sensors to track what people were leaving the store with. Just over half of Amazon Fresh stores are equipped with Just Walk Out. The technology allows customers to skip checkout altogether by scanning a QR code when they enter the store. Though it seemed completely automated, Just Walk Out relied on more than 1,000 people in India watching and labeling videos to ensure accurate checkouts. The cashiers were simply moved off-site, and they watched you as you shopped. ↫ Maxwell Zeff Behind every Silicon Valley innovation are underpaid poor people.

## Class-Action Lawsuit against Google’s Incognito Mode

## The rise and fall of 3M’s floppy disk

date: 2024-04-03, from: OS News

Even with that said, those gray-hairs will frequently claim that of the many makers of floppies out there, 3M made the best ones. Given that, I was curious to figure out exactly why 3M became the most memorable brand in data storage during the formative days of computing, and why it abandoned the product. ↫ Ernie Smith I do not remember if I ever held any particular views on which brand of floppy disk (or diskettes, as we called them) was the best. We had a wide variety of brands, and I can&#8217;t recall any one of them being better than the other, but then, I&#8217;m sure people in professional settings had more experience with the little black squares and thus developed all kinds of feelings about them.

## The Super Bowl for Meteorologists

date: 2024-04-03, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTg3NzY5My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcxMzcyODA4Mn0.KThx9buWt8INTfS2zFuoGjhmST8FMUJNnZ_m_v4MB-s/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">On December 14, 2020, at a little past 1 p.m., meteorologist Matthew Cappucci sat down in the middle of a random field near the Chilean-Argentinian border and cried because it was cloudy. </p>
<p>“To say I was devastated would be an understatement,” he told me.</p>
<p>Cappucci had traveled from his home in Washington, D.C., to Pucón, Chile, to experience a total solar eclipse, only to be denied by an atmospheric river. Under normal circumstances, he could have driven into Argentina, where there were clear skies on the other side of the Andes, but COVID travel restrictions were still in place and the border was closed. His long months of planning and excitement, all dashed by a couple last-minute rain clouds.</p>
<p>All that is to say, Cappucci understands better than most the importance of making an immaculate eclipse-day forecast. In less than a week, millions of Americans will flood the 115-mile-wide, 15-state-long path of totality for the country’s last total solar eclipse until 2044. As they do so, they’ll be relying on the predictions of local and national meteorologists like Cappucci, an atmospheric scientist at <a href="https://business.myradar.com/eclipse/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MyRadar</a> and the Capitol Weather Gang. “I will say that I’ve never personally been more stressed about an event, nor been looking forward to something as much,” Cappucci told me.</p>
<p>Weather teams across the country have been preparing for April 8, 2024, since as early as 2017, when the last American total solar eclipse occurred. There was a noticeable giddiness among the meteorologists I spoke to; it’s fairly unusual for the public to have a high level of interest in a forecast that <em>isn’t</em> potentially life-threatening. “It’ll be really fun to get to be out there and not have to be in a raincoat or have things flying through the air,” Alex Wilson, an on-air meteorologist at The Weather Channel, joked to me.</p>
<p>But as Cappucci alluded to, there is also an elevated sense of responsibility. Every local weather website in or near the path of totality I checked last week already had information about the eclipse-day forecast on its homepage. National publications like <em>The Washington Post</em>, meanwhile, are publishing new <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/01/02/total-solar-eclipse-path-april/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">explainers</a>, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/03/29/cloud-cover-eclipse-forecast-maps-cities/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">live maps</a>, and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/03/31/total-solar-eclipse-america/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">opinion pieces</a> daily in the lead-up to the event. Wilson told me The Weather Channel will have “a bunch of teams” stationed from Texas all the way along the path of totality to Maine; she’ll personally be on hand in Dallas for the station’s Celestron telescope <a href="https://www.astronomy.com/observing/celestron-partners-with-astronomy-for-major-eclipse-event/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">live stream from Love Field</a>.</p>
<p>Cappucci and the rest of the small MyRadar team are also planning to head to Texas for their coverage, which is shaping up to include <a href="https://business.myradar.com/eclipse/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a live stream</a> and <a href="https://x.com/MyRadarWX/status/1774624242941739340?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an “Eclipse Week” package</a> that started Monday. (The company has also been giving away MyRadar-branded eclipse glasses in the lead-up to the event.) This time, Cappucci has thought of everything; he even has a StarLink subscription to ensure that the team can maintain internet connectivity if it ends up reporting from a remote corner of the state.</p>
<p>Fox Weather, meanwhile, has 120 meteorologists under its national, regional, and local umbrella, and has been planning <a href="https://www.foxweather.com/live" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">its own solar eclipse package</a> since October’s <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/edu/news/2023/9/28/the-science-of-solar-eclipses-and-how-to-watch-with-nasa/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">annular eclipse</a> over Texas. The finer details were still coming together last week when I spoke to Fox meteorologist Stephen Morgan, who is based in New York City and will be anchoring from Dallas. But at a minimum, the network plans to have correspondents on air in 10 cities along the path of totality, stretching from Eagle Pass on the Mexican border to Burlington, Vermont. “We’re excited,” Morgan told me, “but I think the elephant in the room is the fact that this is happening in the month of April, which is a very tough month when it comes to forecasting.”</p>
<p>Joe Rao, a longtime television meteorologist and an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse_chasing" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">umbraphile</a> who has seen 13 total solar eclipses, was even more blunt when I asked him what local weather teams would be grappling with this week. “Out of the 12 months of the year, April is probably the worst month to have an eclipse,” he told me.</p>
<p>April is a transitional month in North America, seasonally-speaking. It is a time when severe weather begins to ramp up; it’s <a href="https://www.foxweather.com/weather-news/april-begins-severe-weather-threat" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the second busiest</a> month for tornadoes. The continent’s <a href="https://eclipsophile.com/2024tse/#:~:text=April%E2%80%99s%20major%20storm%20tracks%20across%20the%20continent" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">three major west-to-east storm paths</a> also become more active. And in places like Texas, which experts said would have <a href="https://eclipsophile.com/2024tse/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the best chance of anywhere in the nation</a> for clear skies on eclipse day, you can still get a south wind that brings moisture off the Gulf of Mexico, giving clouds a chance to develop. </p>
<p>Houston-based Fox meteorologist Aaron Barker is keenly aware of this. He’s been sharing radar models for Central Texas <a href="https://x.com/weatherbarker/status/1775191926599192691?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on Twitter</a> and, as of now, the region is looking pretty dicey for cloud cover next week. Like Morgan and Cappucci, though, he said the pressure to get this particular forecast right is intense. “It’s obviously less serious than a hurricane or something like that, but the importance of the forecast for a lot of people is still very, very high,” he told me. </p>
<p>Ironically, that’s also part of the problem; because of the danger of storms like hurricanes and tornadoes, we’ve gotten pretty good at seeing them coming. “The science has improved remarkably over the years trying to hone in on those threats, but cloud cover — my word. That’s a tough one,” Morgan said. Clouds alone aren’t usually a life or death situation. But for people spending hundreds or thousands of dollars to chase a rare celestial phenomenon, the stakes can start to <em>feel</em> that high. </p>
<p>Cappucci gets it: “I’ve done a million kajillion tornadoes, hurricanes, the Northern Lights, the whole nine yards,” he said. “Simply nothing compares to a total solar eclipse.” As he explained, the “most important thing” you can see during an eclipse is the corona — the silvery atmosphere of the sun visible around the moon that “looks like the hairs of an angel because they’re glowing and radiating out into space.” To see it, though, you need clear skies. “Even some high cirrus clouds — yeah, they’re a nuisance, but you can still see some stuff,” Cappucci went on. “But to get overcast rain is really a showstopper.”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that’s precisely what Barker has been seeing on his radar models for most of Texas, and local meteorology teams in Dallas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas have begun to dampen expectations. Wilson, the Weather Channel meteorologist, admitted that she’s a little “nervous” while cautioning that it’s still early for such predictions. Meanwhile, upstate New York and Vermont, which have the worst records of clear skies this time of year, are shaping up to have the best show in the country. </p>
<p>Rao, the longtime eclipse-chaser, has only been clouded out at two of his 13 experiences. (If you believe in luck, note that he plans to watch this one somewhere upstate.) He has <a href="https://www.space.com/what-if-it-is-cloudy-for-total-solar-eclipse-april-8-2024" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tried to calm some of the panic</a> around the possibility of cloud cover, explaining to me that “it’s not like you’re not going to experience anything” if the sky is overcast on April 8. During one of his cloud-outs, at his first eclipse in Quebec in 1972, he watched the sky go from “battleship gray to weird colorations of saffron and pink. At one point, it was like I was looking at the clouds through the inside of a beer bottle or an iodine bottle.”</p>
<p>Of course, pretty clouds are just consolation; everyone wants perfect viewing conditions. The National Weather Service has even started to post <a href="https://x.com/NWSWPC/status/1774862804463538444?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a little jingle</a> alongside its daily cloud-cover updates: “Totality or bust, check the forecast and adjust!” The meteorologists I spoke to universally agreed that they won’t start to put too much stock in the cloud models until Wednesday or Thursday at the earliest. </p>
<p>Wilson said she personally won’t feel confident in the hourly models until at least three or four days out, and even then, you never really know. It was overcast when she was covering the annular eclipse in San Antonio in October and “everybody was kind of freaking out. Then, about 20 minutes before eclipse time, it cleared out.”</p>
<p>That is the annoying truth of modern meteorology: Not even the best computers, radars, <a href="https://heatmap.news/culture/old-farmers-almanac-climate-change" target="_self">almanacs</a>, or atmospheric scientists can predict whether a stray cloud will wander in front of the sun in the minutes before totality.</p>
<p>“I’m just really hoping that April doesn’t do April things and that weather-wise, it cooperates,” Morgan said. “But April is full of surprises — and clouds.”</p>

## 2024-04-01 What’s the plan?

date: 2024-04-03, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-04-01-what-s-the-plan">2024-04-01 What’s the plan?</h1>

<p><a class="account" href="https://mastodon.sdf.org/@Shufei" title="@Shufei@mastodon.sdf.org">@Shufei</a> asks what we&rsquo;ll do with all the billionaires if we survive the next decade, the next century. Like I said in that post about Israel and Palestine, it&rsquo;s worth imagining positive outcomes and then think about the intermediate steps. So, assuming we make it, what happened?</p>

<p>I think the long term change we would need is <a href="2024-04-03-tax">extremely high taxes</a> as a an explicit redistribution mechanism. We&rsquo;ll look back and say, &ldquo;during Late State Capitalism we nearly ended the planet but then we manage to curb inequality and raised inheritance tax to 80%, the max income tax bracket to 90% and the two-digit million wealth tax to 20%.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The goal would be a society with salaries between 50k and 200k per year and family, and wealth worth one year of salary. Health insurance paid for by taxes. Retirement homes paid for by taxes. Pensions paid for by immediate redistribution (i.e., taxes) instead of investments.</p>

<p><a class="account" href="https://mastodon.sdf.org/@Shufei" title="@Shufei@mastodon.sdf.org">@Shufei</a> commented on this and mentioned land reform:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rentierism in all facets has virtually no restraints in most of the world.  That is sometimes <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> of capital which a family could have put to family resiliency, instead going to landlords and investment epiphenomina like gentrification.  I’m not sure oldschool petite bourgeois distributionism (landed yeomanry) is the big answer there, but under a “permanent jubilee” it might be workable enough to eliminate the scourge of landlordism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m not quite sure what the plan is, though.</p>

<p>For urban planning it seems to be state-sponsored coop housing. As soon as the percentage of sponsored housing goes up, the other rents go down, while still leaving the option of more generous housing being built. This is a lesson that was somewhat forgotten in Zürich for a few decades and that seems to explain a lot about the high rents, here.</p>

<p>For agriculture, what seems to have worked in Switzerland (still not enough but a lot better than in the European Union) is protectionism, direct payment, zoning laws, government fixed pricing on agricultural land, etc. not a single thing but a whole set of interlocking mechanisms. And there is still room for improvement. But I’d defer to groups active in food sovereignty to better answer that question, I guess.
Maybe <a href="https://viacampesina.org/">Via Campesina</a> has a plan, for example.</p>

<p><a class="account" href="https://idiomdrottning.org/users/Sandra" title="@Sandra@idiomdrottning.org">@Sandra</a> just posted two links, one discussing alternatives and one where she looks for the elements of the solution. Let&rsquo;s talk about them.</p>

<p><a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/alternatives">Alternatives</a> argues for market socialism, as I read it. In a subsequent comment on fedi she disagreed with this take and said that it was by far the weakest alternative. But I&rsquo;m not so sure. Planned economy doesn&rsquo;t work; small nudges is what we have and it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be working either; and the last option seems to be &ldquo;utopias and sundry&rdquo;. That doesn&rsquo;t sound promising, either. I still think that in the given list, market socialism doesn&rsquo;t sound bad at all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Worker-owned cooperatives that trade with each other on a market. That’s it. That’s the whole plan.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then again, none of the alternatives seem pretty strong.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also not sure how market socialism would work in a global environment. How would we deal with local bad harvests and war? It&rsquo;s biggest benefit seems to be that it promises incremental improvements. No bloody revolution necessary. And that&rsquo;s already a plus.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A big upside of this track is that it’s somewhat compatible with the other systems and with present-day market capitalism. This means that it can be implemented piecemeal wherever it make sense and I think that’s awesome.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/solution">My best guess at a climate solution</a> is where Sandra ends with a call to regain influence in the media.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Making changes in our own lives is great (eat plants) but ideally we’d want politicians (and their overlords: mass media) to sober up and implement policies to steer industry and the rich.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here in Switzerland (and elsewhere), the fascists like to complain about left-wing media and fight them and defund them until they have them under their thumb (remember Berlusconi&rsquo;s media take-over in Italy). So we need to fight them all the way: Decry their meddling and scheming and increase the funding. Demand that they drop the airhead programming and bring back material that helps lift people up, not drag them down. Education and information is key.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not a media person, so I don&rsquo;t know how to do it. All I can say is that music programs that have interesting discussions surrounding the music work well for me. Podcasts work for me. Series seem to work for some. Just drop the quiz shows and reality-TV and all that order material that only serves to distract.</p>

<p>I guess that in my heart of hearts I feel that humanity’s main problem is sociopaths. These people are always there and they love their person gain and don’t feel other people’s pain. Therefore, the struggle is eternal. There is no solidification, no solution that will hold for generations. Every generation will have to fight this fight. All I can say is that it&rsquo;s a mistake to let a generation grow up in the belief that politics is not important, that struggle isn&rsquo;t necessary, or that the end of history has come.</p>

<p>That is never going to be true.</p>

## 2024-04-03 We need more taxes

date: 2024-04-03, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-04-03-we-need-more-taxes">2024-04-03 We need more taxes</h1>

<p>I recently wondered about <a href="2024-04-01-the-plan">our plan</a> for dealing with the rich.
A key part is increased taxation.</p>

<p>Whenever I hear talk about the state crumbling (and since my wife works for the federal government in Switzerland I hear plenty of that), the first thing many people think is that the fault lies with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balanced_budget_amendment">balanced budget amendment</a> (&ldquo;Schuldenbremse&rdquo;). And indeed, that is the obvious cause for many of the problems.</p>

<p>Arguing about the balanced budget amendment is doomed, however. Most people don&rsquo;t understand the difference between household economics and state economics. A much simpler solution exists, one that everybody understands: <strong>INCREASE TAXES FFS!</strong></p>

<p>Now I know why countries like Switzerland don&rsquo;t like to increase taxes: Where would all the oligarchs go? Where would all the great holdings go? And within Switzerland, same thing: as soon as one canton dropped inheritance tax they all feared that the rich would move elsewhere and started dropping their inheritance taxes. And now <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erbschaftssteuer_in_der_Schweiz">there is practically none</a>, for descendants. Wealth can stay in the family, like in the good old days of feudalism.</p>

<p>Next up: Fighting tax evasion, fighting the free movement of capital, fighting for a global tax (do not follow the Swiss model of malevolent compliance!), and more. The fighting just never stops, I know. 😩</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_tax">Progressive taxation</a> is great. The more you own and make, the more you can afford to support the public good. Pay proportionally more!</p>

<p>Taxes are great for redistribution of wealth. We don&rsquo;t need to argue about Universal Basic Income (I support it!) or new subsidies or anything else like that: We can simply use existing mechanisms to redistribute wealth, reducing that Gini coefficient, increasing happiness, increasing the feeling of living in a fair and just society, increasing the feeling that work can get you to the top.</p>

<p>Taxes are great to fight inflation, too! If the state hands out more money in a time of crisis, that excess money has to be taken back via taxes. This keeps the money flowing (and only money flowing is what counts). Of course you don&rsquo;t want to bring it back via asocial taxation schemes like a fixed per-head tax, or a VAT, but something like progressive income tax or progressive wealth tax.</p>

<p>This makes sense, even in broken system like ours: COVID money for everybody, everybody is squeezed by landlords and industry, then tax the rich to get the money back. Virtuous cycle!</p>

## NATO foreign ministers to discuss proposed 100 billion euro military fund for Ukraine

date: 2024-04-03, from: VOA News USA

STATE DEPARTMENT — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken held talks with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on Wednesday on how to bolster the alliance’s long-term military support for Ukraine.


The United States will host a NATO summit in Washington from July 9 to July 11. Blinken discussed priorities for the meeting with his counterpart as the alliance celebrates its 75th anniversary this year.


“Secretary Blinken and Secretary-General Stoltenberg discussed key priorities for the Washington Summit, including strengthening our shared commitment to Ukraine, furthering NATO’s Indo-Pacific and EU partnerships, and building upon collective defense commitments,” State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a statement.


“They also noted the strength of the Alliance, with Finland and Sweden participating as members, and increased investment by Allies,” Miller added.


This week, NATO foreign ministers met in Brussels to discuss a proposal for creating a five-year fund, totaling 100 billion euros or approximately $108 billion, to support Ukraine's military.


The plan, put forward by Stoltenberg, includes making NATO more directly involved in coordinating military assistance provided by member countries — a role that has been filled by a U.S.-led coalition of more than 50 countries.


Stoltenberg told reporters Wednesday it is important that support for Ukraine be less dependent on voluntary, short-term offers and more dependent on longer-term NATO commitments. He said Ukrainian commanders would be better able to make battlefield plans with more predictable support. 


Stoltenberg said the plan would also send a message to Russia that it cannot win by keeping the war going until Ukraine’s allies tire of providing support. 


“Ukraine has urgent needs,” Stoltenberg said. “Any delay in providing support has consequences on the battlefield as we speak.” 


A final decision on the proposal would not come until the NATO summit in July. It requires consensus among its 32 members.

While individual NATO members have been providing arms to Ukraine, the organization as a whole has concentrated on providing nonlethal aid for fear of escalating tensions with Russia through a more direct involvement.


On Thursday, foreign ministers from the security bloc will meet with its partners from the Indo-Pacific.


“North Korea, China, Iran are supporting Russia’s war of aggression in different ways, so this demonstrates that security is not regional security, it’s truly global, and therefore it’s important that we work together with our Asia-Pacific partners,” Stoltenberg said on Wednesday.


Ahead of the Brussels talks, Blinken renewed calls for the U.S. Congress to release military aid for Ukraine.


“We are at a critical moment where it is absolutely essential to get Ukrainians what they continue to need to defend themselves, particularly when it comes to munitions and air defenses,” Blinken said Tuesday during a visit to a defense facility in Paris with French Defense Minister Sébastien Lecornu.


Congress has yet to approve the Biden administration’s supplementary budget request that would resupply Ukraine’s armed forces and help the country fend off Russian offensives.


Biden has called on the Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives to approve the military and financial aid package. House Republicans have delayed action on it for months, prioritizing domestic issues.


Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has warned that Ukrainian forces will have to retreat “step by step, in small steps,” if Kyiv doesn’t receive the U.S. military aid.


Some information for this report came from Agence France-Presse and Reuters.

Almost six months have passed since President Joe Biden asked Congress to appropriate money for Ukraine in a national security supplemental bill. At first, House Republicans said they would not pass such a bill without border security. Then, when a bipartisan group of senators actually produced a border security provision for the national security bill, they killed it, under orders from former president Trump.

## Exiled Chinese businessman Guo Wengui must face US fraud indictment

date: 2024-04-03, from: VOA News USA

new york — A U.S. judge on Tuesday rejected exiled Chinese businessman Guo Wengui's bid to dismiss an indictment accusing him of defrauding thousands of investors out of more than $1 billion. 


U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres in Manhattan said prosecutors sufficiently alleged that Guo engaged in a pattern of racketeering through four fraud schemes, and that proving it was a matter for trial. 


Lawyers for Guo did not immediately respond to requests for comment after business hours. 


Guo has pleaded not guilty to 12 criminal charges including securities fraud, wire fraud, unlawful monetary transactions and conspiracy, including for money laundering. 


According to the indictment, Guo and his accomplices defrauded investors in a media company, cryptocurrency and other ventures. 


The indictment said Guo took advantage of his prolific online presence and hundreds of thousands of followers by promising outsized financial returns and other benefits. 


In reality, the scheme allowed the co-conspirators to enrich themselves and family members and fund Guo's "extravagant lifestyle," the indictment said. 


Two co-defendants face related criminal charges, and one defendant is charged with obstruction. 


Also known as Ho Wan Kwok and Miles Kwok, Guo is a critic of China's Communist Party and a business associate of former U.S. President Donald Trump's onetime adviser Steve Bannon. 


Guo has been jailed in Brooklyn, a borough in New York City, since his March 2023 arrest, with Torres and a federal appeals court rejecting his proposed $25 million bail package last year. 


Jury selection in his trial is scheduled to begin on May 20. 


Prosecutors also sought the forfeiture of various assets, including bank accounts, a $37 million yacht, a New Jersey mansion, a Bugatti, a Lamborghini and a Rolls Royce. 


Guo filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in Connecticut in February 2022. That case was later combined with the bankruptcies of other companies he controlled. Torres has twice rejected Guo's bid to stay the bankruptcy proceedings.

## Service provider for immigrants in detention ordered to pay $811M+ in lawsuit

date: 2024-04-03, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — A company that provides services for immigrants in federal detention was ordered Tuesday to pay more than $811 million in restitution and penalties in a lawsuit alleging it used deceptive and abusive tactics.


Nexus Services must pay roughly $231 million in restitution as well as penalties of $13.8 million to New York, $7.1 million to Virginia and $3.4 million to Massachusetts, according to a judgment filed in federal court for the Western District of Virginia in Harrisonburg. The Virginia-based company, its subsidiary Libre by Nexus and its three executives must also each pay more than $111 million in civil penalties.


"This judgment is a victory for thousands of immigrant families who lost their life savings and were targeted and preyed on by Libre," New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement. "Libre exploited vulnerable immigrants and their families to pad its pockets, and that is illegal and unconscionable."


James joined state attorneys general in Virginia and Massachusetts and the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in a 2021 lawsuit that accused the company of violating state and federal consumer protection laws.


The officials said the company promised to secure immigrants' release on bond while their immigration claims were being processed but concealed and misrepresented the true nature and costs of its services. They said the company collected thousands of dollars in fees above the face value of the bonds and forced immigrants to wear painful ankle monitors.


U.S. District Judge Elizabeth Dillon noted in her decision that the company isn't a licensed bail bond agent or a surety company certified by the U.S. Treasury but a "service provider that acts as an intermediary between immigration detainees and sureties and their bond agents."


The company said in a statement that it intends to appeal the judgment, calling it a "shocking departure from normal American jurisprudence" as it was decided "without evidence, without a trial and without a damages hearing."


"We continue to remain committed to serving our clients — people who suffer and sacrifice for a better life, and who do not deserve to be political pawns in an American legislature or an American courtroom," the company added.

## Blogroll software update

date: 2024-04-03, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/01/appleRunner.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">We're starting to test the blogroll software with a few users, but we hit a problem before we began. The blogroll code includes the CSS for the Bootstrap Toolkit. I use it as if it were part of the OS, but not everyone does, and it changes the global values of things. So when you install it on a page that has its own ideas how things should work, you can get an unpleasant effect (to put it mildly). So I created a localized <a href="http://scripting.com/code/blogroll/smallbootstrap.css">subset</a> of Bootstrap's styles, to be a better guest in other people's pages. That is now done. I expect we'll see more of that kind of thing. Web plugins are a new area for me. I guess that's pretty obvious. </p>
