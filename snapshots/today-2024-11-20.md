## Episode 146 - The Z4

date: 2024-11-25, from: Advent of Computing

<p data-pm-slice="0 0 []">The Z4, completed by Konrad Zuse in 1945, is a computer with a wild story. It was made from scrounged parts, survived years of bombing raids, moved all around Berlin, and eventually took refuge in basements and stables. In this episode we will follow the Z4's early days, and look at how it fits into the larger picture of Zuse's work. Along the way there is looting, rumors, and even...

## Why I became a Documentation Engineer (and what that even means)

date: 2024-11-24, from: Blog by Fabrizio Ferri-Benedetti

<p>A reader asked me how they’d become a Documentation Engineer, because they saw I got hired as one and felt curious about what it takes to get there. This inevitably got me thinking about job titles and the evolution of tech writing, two topics that are quite central to this blog. Let me begin with the short answer: As a tech writer you’ll have to wear many hats, but you’ll always be a technical writer. Depending on your preferences, some hats will be more comfortable than others. Docs Engineer is one of those.</p>

## LRMs Are Interpretable

date: 2024-11-21, updated: 2024-11-21, from: Tom Kellog blog

A year ago I wrote a post called LLMs Are Interpretable. The gist is that LLMs were the closest

say that LRMs (Large Reasoning Models) are even more interpretable.
