id="former-somali-refugee-elected-mayor-of-minnesota-city-making-history">Former
Somali Refugee Elected Mayor of Minnesota City, Making History</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Voters in the Minnesota city of St. Louis Park elected Nadia Mohamed,
a 27-year-old Somali-American, as the city’s first Black, first Somali,
and first Muslim mayor Tuesday night.</p>
<p>The election results show that Mohamed easily defeated Dale Anderson,
a former banker and continuing education teacher, by a margin of 58% to
41%.</p>
<p>“I am very happy to win as Somali-American, Muslim, migrant and
Black,” she told VOA’s Somali Service. “I would say thank you to all of
those who supported me in this. It is our victory.”</p>
<p>Maine State Rep. Deqa Dhalac was the first Somali American to serve
as mayor of an American city in 2021, when South Portland’s six-member
council selected Dhalac for the role. Mohamed becomes the first Somali
mayor in American history elected directly by voters.</p>
<p>“I have lived in this city for 18 years,” said Mohamed. “I grew up
and finished my school here, so it was easy for me to get elected
because people know me.”</p>
<p>An early start</p>
<p>As refugees, Mohamed’s family moved to St. Louis Park when she was 10
years old.</p>
<p>Mohamed says her aspirations for elected office started with routine
recreational walks when she was young.</p>
<p>“I would walk around the city hall and could only see the portraits
of city’s former mayors on the walls. All of them were white men. I only
saw two women. None of them looked like me,” she said. “But now, I am
very happy, and it is amazing to see my photo among these mayors,
knowing that — let us say, 50 years from now — it will be still
here.</p>
<p>“Muslim, black and migrant girls will have a better opportunity to
see one of them among these mayors,” she said.</p>
<p>Mohamed in 2019 was elected to the St. Louis Park City Council at the
age of 23, making her the youngest individual to hold the position in
the 170-year history of the Minneapolis suburb.</p>
<p>Before public office, she also held a position at the Minnesota
Department of Human Services as a diversity, equity and inclusion
specialist.</p>
<p>Predominantly white St. Louis Park, a city of roughly 50,000, has
seen the number of people of color more than double over the past two
decades, reaching 20% of the population. Some 10% of residents are
foreign-born, and the average household income is $87,639.</p>
<p>The city’s mayor is also its manager, responsible for executive-level
operations. The mayor also chairs the City Council.</p>
<p>Mohamed will succeed Jake Spano, who announced in March that he would
not seek reelection and endorsed Mohamed.</p>
<p>Other Somali-American successes</p>
<p>In nearby Minneapolis on Tuesday, another Somali-American, Ward 6
City Councilman Jamal Osman, defended his seat, receiving 44.6% of the
vote, followed by Kayseh Magan with 30.1% and Tiger Worku with
21.8%.</p>
<p>Speaking to his supporters after the election results were in, Osman
said he was happy and felt grateful to be trusted by Ward 6 residents
for three consecutive years.</p>
<p>“I’m super excited,” Osman said. “We have a lot of work going on. We
have a lot of work to do.”</p>
<p>In 2022, at least eight Somali-American women won races in U.S.
midterm elections.</p>
<p>The success of Somali-American female candidates in the U.S. eclipses
that of female aspirants for elected office in Somalia.</p>
<p>Female politicians in Somalia are so disenfranchised that in 2016,
Somalia’s federal and regional leaders had to start allocating a
specific quota of seats in parliament. But women still were never given
the opportunity to get the 30% quota promised.</p>
<p>In 2016, Somali women occupied 24% of the 329 seats in the two houses
of parliament. In 2022, female candidates secured 20%, well short of the
30% quota.</p>
<p>Mohamed Olad Hassan reported from Washington. This story originated
in VOA’s Somali Service.</p>

<h2 id="china-takes-back-washingtons-pandas-amid-frosty-diplomacy">China
Takes Back Washington’s Pandas Amid Frosty Diplomacy</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The trio of giant pandas in the Smithsonian National Zoo are heading
back to China on Wednesday, leaving only a handful of giant pandas in
North America amid tense diplomatic relations between the U.S. and
China.</p>
<p>Now age 25 and 26 respectively, the pandas Mei Xiang and Tian Tian
came to the U.S. in 2000 and have been a mainstay in the Washington zoo
ever since.</p>
<p>In 2020, they had a cub named Xiao Qi Ji, or “Little Miracle” in
English. But now the parents and the cub are embarking on a 19 hour-long
flight to Chengdu, China, aboard a cargo plane.</p>
<p>The Smithsonian National Zoo has spent millions over the years,
particularly to help the pandas breed healthily, and has paid $500,000
annually to its Chinese conservation counterpart, according to the zoo’s
most recent contract.</p>
<p>In the early morning, reporters saw the pandas in large, ventilated
crates and boxes of apples and bamboo shoots being hauled out of the
zoo.</p>
<p>The pandas’ one-way trip home came as expected: The agreement that
brought them to the U.S. stipulated their return. But many see the
trio’s departure as a sign of the times as the geopolitical rift between
East and West widens.</p>
<p>When it comes to lending pandas to zoos abroad, the Chinese
government prefers “nations with whom China’s relations are on the
upswing, as a form of soft power projection,” Kurt Tong, a managing
partner of the Asia Group consultancy, told Agence France-Presse.</p>
<p>Relations between Washington and Beijing have been strained by years
of disagreements over trade, human rights abuses and the status of
Taiwan.</p>
<p>According to Tong, “it is not surprising that Chinese authorities are
allowing panda contracts with U.S. zoos to expire.”</p>
<p>The Washington zoo held a weeklong “Panda Palooza” in September to
bid farewell to the bears. Over the last few months, thousands of panda
lovers visited to say their goodbyes.</p>
<p>Zoo Atlanta in Georgia plans to return its pandas in 2024, meaning
Mexico City’s Xin Xin will likely be the only panda left on the
continent.</p>
<p>The first pandas came to American zoos in 1972, after then-President
Richard Nixon’s famous visit to China.</p>
<p>Some information for this report was provided by Agence
France-Presse.</p>

Biden wants to ban ripoff “financial advisors” (08 Nov 2023)</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-08, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links Biden wants to ban ripoff “financial advisors”: Big
gubmint wants to take away your freedom to starve to death in old age.
Announcing The Lost Cause Tour: LA, Stratford, Concord, Simsbury,
Toronto, New York and Chapel Hill! Hey look at this: Delights to
delectate. This day in history: 2013, 2018, 2022 Colophon: Recent
publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects,
current reading Biden wants to ban ripoff “financial advisors”
(permalink) Once, American workers had “defined benefits pensions,”
where their employers promised to pay them a certain amount every year
from their retirement to their death. Jimmy Carter swapped that out for
401(k)s, “market” pensions where you have to guess which stocks will be
valuable or starve in your old age:
https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/25/derechos-humanos/#are-there-no-poorhouses
The initial 401(k) rollout had all kinds of pot-sweeteners that made
them seem like a good deal, like heavy employer matching that doubled or
even tripled the value of every dollar you put into the market for your
retirement. But over the years, as Reaganomics took hold and workers’
power ebbed away, all these goodies were clawed back. In the end, the
market-based pension makes you the sucker at the poker table, flushing
your savings into a rigged casino that is firmly tilted in favor of
finance barons and other eminently guillotineable plutocrats.
Neoliberalism is many things, but most of all it is a cult of
individualism. The fact that three generations of workers are nows
facing down retirement without pensions that will provide them with
secure housing and food – let alone money to see the odd movie, buy
birthday gifts for their grandkids, or enjoy a meal out now and then –
is framed as millions of individual failures, not a systemic one. In
other words, if you are facing food insecurity and homelessness after a
lifetime of hard work, it’s because you saved wrong. Perhaps you didn’t
save enough (through a 40-year run of wage stagnation and skyrocketing
housing, health and education costs). Or perhaps you saved wrong, making
the wrong bets on the stock market. If you can’t afford to run your air
conditioner during a heat dome, that’s on you: you should have been
better at stocks. Apologists for this system will say that you don’t
have to be good at stocks – you just have to pay an Independent
Financial Advisor to pick the stocks for you and you’ll be fine. But
IFAs don’t work for free! What if you can’t afford one? Enter “predatory
inclusion” – the practice of offering scammy, overpriced and substandard
products to poor people and declaring it to be a good deed, because
otherwise, those poor people would have to do without. The crypto bubble
relied heavily on this: think of Spike Lee and others shilling for
pump-and-dump scams as a way of “building Black wealth”:
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/07/business/media/cryptocurrency-seeks-the-spotlight-with-spike-lees-help.html
More recently, Intuit and other scammy tax-prep services have argued
against the IRS’s plan to offer free tax preparation as bad for Black
and brown people, because it will deny them the chance to be deceived
and ripped off with TurboTax:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/27/predatory-inclusion/#equal-opportunity-scammers
Back in 2018, Trump won the predatory inclusion Olympics, when his
Department of Labor let the Fifth Circuit abolish the “Fiduciary Rule”
for Independent Financial Advisors:
https://www.investopedia.com/updates/dol-fiduciary-rule/ What was the
Fiduciary Rule? It said that your IFN had to put your interests ahead of
their own. Like, if there were two different funds you could bet on, and
one would pay your IFN a big commission, while the other would be a
better bet for you, the IFN couldn’t put your retirement savings into
the fund that offered them a bribe. When Trump killed the Fiduciary
Rule, he proclaimed it a victory for poor people, especially Black and
brown people. After all, if IFNs weren’t allowed to accept bribes for
giving you bad financial advice, then they would have to make up the
difference by charging you for good advice. If you couldn’t afford that
advice, well, you’d have to make bad retirement investments on your own,
without the benefit of their sleazy self-dealing. The Biden
Administration wants to change that. Biden’s Acting Labor Secretary is
Julie Su, and she’s very good at her job. Last spring, she forced west
coast dockworkers’ bosses to cough up the contract they’d stalled on for
a year, with 8-10% raises for every worker, owed retroactively:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/06/16/that-boy-aint-right/#dinos-rinos-and-dunnos
Su has proposed a way to reinstate the Fiduciary Rule, as part of the
Biden Administration’s war on junk fees, estimating that this will
increase retirees’ net savings by 20%:
https://prospect.org/labor/2023-11-07-julie-su-labor-retirement-savers/
The new rule will force advisors who cheat their clients to pay
restitution, and will require them to deliver all their advice in
writing so that this cheating can be detected and punished. The industry
is furious, of course. They claim that “The Market (TM)” will solve
this: if you get bad retirement savings advice and end up homeless and
starving, then you will choose a different advisor in your next life,
after you are reincarnated (I guess?). And of course, they’re also
claiming that forcing IFNs to stop cheating their clients will deny poor
people access to expert (bad) advice. As the Financial Services
Institute’s Dale Brown says, this will have a “negative impact on Main
Street Americans’ access to financial advice”:
https://www.fa-mag.com/news/legal-challenge-predicted-for-new-dol-fiduciary-proposal-75257.html
Here’s that rule – read it for yourself, then submit a comment
expressing your views on it. The government wants to hear from you, and
administrative law requires them to act on the comments they receive:
https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/11/03/2023-23782/proposed-amendment-to-prohibited-transaction-exemptions-75-1-77-4-80-83-83-1-and-86-128
Su is part of a wave of progressive, technically skilled regulators in
the Biden administration that resulted from a horse-trading exercise
called the Unity Task Force, which divvied up access to top appointments
among the progressive wing and the finance wing of the Democratic Party.
The progressive appointments are nothing short of incredible – the most
competent and principled agency leaders America has seen in half a
century: https://pluralistic.net/2023/10/23/getting-stuff-done/#praxis
But then there’s the finance wing’s appointments, like Judge Jacqueline
Scott Corley, who ruled against Lina Khan’s attempt to block the rotten
Microsoft/Activision merger (don’t worry, Khan’s appealing):
https://pluralistic.net/2023/07/14/making-good-trouble/#the-peoples-champion
Perhaps the worst, though, is Biden’s Secretary of Commerce Gina
Raimondo, a private equity ghoul who did a stint for the notorious
wreckers Bain Capital before founding her own firm. Raimondo has stuffed
her department full of Goldman Sachs alums, and has sidelined labor and
civil society groups as she sets out to administer everything from the
CHIPS Act to regulating ChatGPT. As Henry Burke writes for the Revolving
Door Project and The American Prospect, Raimondo’s history as a
corporate raider, her deference to the finance sector, and she and her
husband’s conflicts of interest from their massive stakes in companies
she’s regulating all serve to undermine Biden’s agenda:
https://prospect.org/economy/2023-11-08-commerce-secretary-gina-raimondo-undercutting-bidenomics/
When the administration inevitably complains that its popular economic
programs aren’t breaking through the media coverage, they’ll have no one
to blame but themselves. The Unity Task Force gave us generationally
important policymakers, but ultimately, it’s a classic “pizzaburger.” If
half your family wants pizza, and the other half wants burgers, and you
serve them something halfway in between that makes none of them happy,
you haven’t made a wise compromise – you’ve just made an inedible mess:

id="analysts-taiwan-wont-feature-prominently-in-biden-xi-meeting">Analysts:
Taiwan Won’t Feature Prominently in Biden-Xi Meeting</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>As the U.S. and China prepare for the meeting between U.S. President
Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the APEC
Leaders Summit in San Francisco, some analysts say Beijing and
Washington will try to dissolve the mutual distrust they have over
Taiwan. </p>
<p>However, given their fundamental differences over the issue, China
and the U.S. will likely try to limit the amount of time they spend on
the issue.</p>
<p>“Both sides will have to say something about Taiwan, but this is not
the kind of environment in which they can sit down and have a frank
conversation about what each side’s approach is going to be,” Kharis
Templeman, a research fellow at Stanford University’s Hoover
Institution, told VOA in a video interview. </p>
<p>He thinks Beijing and Washington will try to talk about Taiwan “as
little as possible.”</p>
<p>“There is an election in Taiwan in January that could shake things
up, so neither side has the incentive to try to be bold and reach out to
the other side or deviate from the path that they have taken over the
last couple of years in the trilateral relationship [between the U.S.,
China, and Taiwan,]” Templeman added. </p>
<p>China views Taiwan as part of its territory and vows to reunite with
the self-ruled democracy one day, through force if necessary. In recent
years, Beijing has increased its military intimidation campaign around
Taiwan, repeatedly sending military aircraft into Taiwan’s air defense
identification zone and staging blockade-style military exercises around
the island. </p>
<p>Despite the lack of formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan, the U.S. has
long upheld a policy of ensuring it can defend itself, and has done so
through regular sales of military equipment. U.S. military sales to
Taiwan have become more frequent in recent years. </p>
<p>Washington’s support for Taiwan </p>
<p>While Beijing and Washington have taken steps in recent months to
resume high-level exchanges and stabilize bilateral relations, tensions
around the issue of Taiwan remain high. </p>
<p>According to CGTN, China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi told U.S.
National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan during their meeting in
Washington D.C. last month that “Taiwan independence,” as the Chinese
state-run TV channel  put it, is “the most severe threat to peace and
stability in the Taiwan Strait, which must be resolutely opposed and
reflected in concrete policies and actions.”</p>
<p>Apart from the stern warning from Wang, a top Chinese military
official also reiterated Beijing’s determination to quash any attempt to
separate Taiwan from China. </p>
<p>General Zhang Youxia,vice chairman of China’s Central Military
Commission, said late last month during China’s biggest annual military
diplomacy event — the 10th Xiangshan Forum in Beijing — that “no matter
who wants to separate Taiwan from China in any form, the Chinese
military will never agree and will show no mercy.”</p>
<p>In addition to warning against attempts to separate Taiwan from
China, Zhang also issued a veiled criticism of the U.S. and its allies,
accusing “some countries” of trying to undermine the Chinese
government. </p>
<p>Some experts say the Chinese government’s main concern is
Washington’s increased support and involvement in Taiwan. </p>
<p>“It raises questions about whether the U.S. remains committed to what
has been their One China Policy, which is essentially that the process
by which the two sides [of the Taiwan Strait] figure out their
differences has to be peaceful,” Amanda Hsiao, a senior China analyst
for the International Crisis Group (ICG), told VOA in a phone
interview. </p>
<p>She said Washington’s continuous political and military support for
Taiwan increases Beijing’s concern that the U.S. may try to “keep Taiwan
permanently separated” from China. </p>
<p>While China has repeatedly cited Taiwan independence as its red line,
the Hoover Institution’s Templeman said Beijing’s latest comments are in
line with what it has stated in the past. </p>
<p>“I haven’t seen anything that suggests there is a new tone or
rhetoric,” he told VOA, adding that this means there is no sign of
significant escalation in Beijing’s level of concern. </p>
<p>“Nobody is talking about a deadline for unification or China is going
to resolve the Taiwan question sooner rather than later. Those would be
a significant escalation from what they have said in the past,”
Templeman said. </p>
<p>Tilting the status quo </p>
<p>Compared to stern warnings from Beijing, the U.S. has repeated the
importance of maintaining the status quo across the Taiwan Strait during
meetings between high-level officials from the two sides. </p>
<p>According to the White House’s readout of  Sullivan’s meeting with
Wang, Sullivan “discussed concerns over China’s dangerous and unlawful
actions in the South China Sea” and “raised the importance of peace and
stability across the Taiwan Strait.”</p>
<p>Some analysts say the U.S. is trying to maintain the status quo
across the Taiwan Strait while “implicitly signaling” that it is China,
not Taiwan, that is shifting the status quo.</p>
<p>“Comments from the U.S. certainly repeat the type of rhetoric we have
seen before,” Timothy Rich, a professor of political science at Western
Kentucky University, told VOA in a written response. </p>
<p>Despite efforts to ease tensions, the U.S. and China remain critical
of each other’s military activities near Taiwan. On November 1, the U.S.
7th Fleet announced that a U.S. guided-missile destroyer, the USS Rafael
Peralta, and a Canadian frigate, HMCS Ottawa, “conducted a routine
Taiwan Strait transit.” </p>
<p>Beijing accused Washington of hyping the transit, and it deployed
warships and aircraft to follow the American and Canadian vessels.
Senior Colonel Shi Yi, the spokesperson for the People’s Liberation
Army’s Eastern Theater Command, said the Chinese military’s actions were
in accordance with laws and regulations. </p>
<p>Western Kentucky University’s Rich said he doesn’t expect the
tensions between the U.S. and China over Taiwan, or the two sides’
military actions, “to dissipate in the near future.” </p>
<p>“I would expect Chinese officials to continue to place the blame on
the U.S. and to frame their own actions in the Taiwan Strait as a
domestic issue,” he told VOA. </p>
<p>Since their fundamental differences over Taiwan currently seem
unresolvable, and given that both sides have many issues they want to
prioritize, Templeman thinks the U.S. and China may not give Taiwan a
significant focus during the Biden-Xi meeting at APEC. </p>
<p>“Both sides will need to talk about Taiwan at some point during the
meeting, but I would expect it to be pretty formulaic,” he told
VOA. </p>
<p>In Templeman’s view, if Taiwan is only a small part of the Biden-Xi
meeting, that could serve both Biden’s and Xi’s interests.</p>

<h2 id="at-g7-blinken-warns-israel-against-occupying-gaza">At G7,
Blinken Warns Israel Against Occupying Gaza</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned Israel against
reoccupying Gaza, even while acknowledging a “transition period” may be
necessary following Israel’s war against Hamas militants in the
Palestinian enclave. </p>
<p>At a press conference Wednesday on the sidelines of a Group of Seven
summit in Tokyo, Blinken reasserted U.S. support for Israel’s efforts to
oust Hamas, which killed 1,400 people and abducted over 200 others in an
attack last month in Israel. </p>
<p>But Blinken also said “it is clear that Israel cannot occupy
Gaza.” </p>
<p>“Now, the reality is that there may be a need for some transition
period at the end of the conflict. But it is imperative that the
Palestinian people be central to governance in Gaza and the West Bank,
as well,” he added. </p>
<p>In an interview Tuesday with ABC News, Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu suggested his country will play a security role in
Gaza for an “indefinite period” once the conflict ends. </p>
<p>Over 10,000 Palestinians have been killed, including over 4,000
children, according to Palestinian officials, as Israel intensifies its
ground operation and airstrikes in Gaza.</p>
<p>Netanyahu has insisted there will be no cease-fire until the hostages
taken by Hamas are released. But he suggested Tuesday that “tactical
little pauses – an hour there, an hour there” are possible. </p>
<p>In a joint statement issued Wednesday, G7 foreign ministers called
for “humanitarian pauses and corridors” to allow for the delivery of
humanitarian aid and the release of hostages. </p>
<p>The G7 statement also vowed to support Ukraine’s defense against
Russia “for as long as it takes,” condemned alleged Russian-North Korean
weapons transactions, and criticized a wide range of Chinese
actions.</p>
<p>Mideast focus</p>
<p>But the meeting was dominated by the Israeli-Palestinian crisis, amid
growing international calls for a cease-fire.</p>
<p>Last week, a large majority of countries in the United Nations
General Assembly voted for a resolution calling for an immediate and
sustained “humanitarian truce” in Gaza. </p>
<p>The United States voted against the proposal, warning that a
cease-fire would allow Hamas to regroup and conduct more attacks. </p>
<p>France, another G7 member, supported the resolution, underscoring
differences on the Mideast conflict even among wealthy, developed
countries. </p>
<p>G7 host Japan has also not been as outspokenly pro-Israel as other
U.S. allies, said Jeffrey J. Hall, a professor at the Kanda University
of International Studies.</p>
<p>“Japan is faced with either angering Washington, or angering the Arab
states that supply it with oil,” Hall said.</p>
<p>“It’s not really possible for the G7 to come out with a very strong
united position on this,” he added. </p>
<p>At his press conference, Blinken played down any suggestion of
friction, saying “G7 unity is stronger and more important than
ever.” </p>
<p>Pressing global concerns</p>
<p>In the joint statement that followed two days of meetings, G7 foreign
ministers addressed a wide range of other global issues. </p>
<p>On Ukraine, the G7 leaders vowed that their governments’ “steadfast
commitment” to Ukraine’s defense “will never waver.” </p>
<p>“We commit to standing by Ukraine for as long as it takes,” the
statement said. </p>
<p>Some analysts have expressed concern that the Israel-Gaza conflict
may shift international focus away from the Ukraine-Russia war.</p>
<p>Such concerns are valid, according to Sebastian Maslow, who teaches
international relations at Sendai Shirayuri Women’s College in
Japan. </p>
<p>“We are living in an attention economy now,” Maslow said.  But, he
said, G7 governments know that if they soften their support of Ukraine,
“this will send a strong signal towards Russia – and China, for that
matter – that the G7 has no ability to resolve a fundamental regional
crisis.”</p>
<p>Focus on Asia</p>
<p>In Tokyo, Blinken also stressed it is important for the United States
to continue to focus on Asia, even while it deals with urgent issues in
Europe and the Mideast.</p>
<p>“We are determined, and we are, as we would say, running and chewing
gum at the same time,” Blinken said. “The Indo-Pacific is the critical
region for our future.” </p>
<p>His comments come ahead of an expected meeting next week in
California between U.S. President Joe Biden and China’s top leader, Xi
Jinping. </p>
<p>Blinken said he could not comment on specific topics that Biden and
Xi will discuss, but that both sides “have acknowledged the importance
of leader level channels in managing the relationship.” </p>
<p>Analysts do not expect any breakthroughs at the Xi-Biden meeting but
say such meetings may help prevent U.S.-China tensions from spiraling
out of control. </p>
<p>Wednesday’s G7 statement repeated many longstanding concerns that the
United States and many of its allies have about China.</p>
<p>The statement expressed opposition to “unilateral attempts to change
the status quo by force or coercion” in the East and South China
seas. </p>
<p>The statement also linked the peace and stability of the Taiwan
Strait to the “security and prosperity” of the international
community.</p>
<p>China has increased its military threats against self-ruled Taiwan
and refuses to rule out taking the island by force. Beijing views the
issue as a domestic, not international, concern, and routinely
criticizes other countries’ comments on the matter.</p>
<p>In addition, the G7 statement expressed concern about the human
rights situation in China, including in Xinjiang and Tibet. </p>
<p>But G7 leaders added: “We stand prepared to build constructive and
stable relations with China, recognizing the importance of engaging
candidly and expressing our concerns directly to China.” </p>
<p>Blinken to Seoul</p>
<p>Following the G7 meetings, Blinken departed for Seoul, where he will
meet with senior South Korean leaders. Military cooperation between
North Korea and Russia will be high on the agenda, according to U.S.
officials.</p>
<p>Washington and Seoul have vowed to enhance joint deterrence against
growing threats from Pyongyang as North Korea continues its nuclear and
ballistic missile programs and prepares for what would be a third
attempt to launch a spy satellite.</p>
<p>The G7 statement strongly condemned recent North Korean weapons
tests, as well as alleged arms transfers from North Korea to Russia,
which it said directly violate U.N. Security Council resolutions.</p>

From the BBC World Service: Wine production around the world is set to
fall this year to its lowest level in more than 60 years, mainly down to
changes in the weather. Plus, consumer and environmental groups have

Nestle and Coca Cola are making misleading claims about plastic bottles
being 100% recycled – or being completely recyclable. The big brands
deny this. And, El Salvador made history in 2021 by becoming the first

In the last few years, a slew of ideas old and new have converged to

id="ivanka-trump-says-at-ny-fraud-trial-she-doesnt-recall-deal-details">Ivanka
Trump Says at NY Fraud Trial She Doesn’t Recall Deal Details</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Donald Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump testified on Wednesday that she
did not recall details of real-estate deals she worked on at her
father’s company, in a New York civil fraud trial that threatens the
former U.S. president’s business empire.  </p>
<p>Like her brothers Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, who testified last
week, Ivanka Trump sought to distance herself from the questionable
valuation methods that have already been ruled fraudulent by the judge
overseeing the trial.</p>
<p>Trump, by contrast, has acknowledged on the witness stand that some
of the estimates of golf courses, office towers and other company assets
were inaccurate.</p>
<p>The lawsuit by New York Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat,
accuses Trump and his family businesses of manipulating real estate
asset values to dupe lenders and insurers and embellish Trump’s
reputation as a successful businessman.</p>
<p>Unlike her siblings and father, Ivanka Trump is not a defendant in
the case.</p>
<p>As a top executive at the Trump Organization between 2011 and 2017,
Ivanka said she focused on redeveloping the Doral golf course in Florida
and the Old Post Office property in Washington.</p>
<p>At the trial, she was shown a 2011 email in which she acknowledged
that a requirement by lender Deutsche Bank that her father maintain a
net worth of at least $3 billion was a problem but encouraged company
officials to approve it anyway.</p>
<p>“We wanted to get a great rate and the only way to get proceeds/term
and principal where we want them is to guarantee the deal,” she wrote to
a Trump Organization lawyer.</p>
<p>On the witness stand, she said she favored the deal but did not
recall specific terms. “I felt generally that the deal terms with
Deutsche Bank for Doral were positive,” she said.</p>
<p>Trump, who leads his rivals for the 2024 Republican presidential
nomination despite a maelstrom of legal troubles, has denied wrongdoing
and accused James and Justice Arthur Engoron of political bias and
“election interference.” He repeated those claims on social media late
on Tuesday, saying it was “Sad!” that Ivanka was being forced to
testify.</p>
<p>During defiant and rambling testimony on Monday, Trump acknowledged
that valuations for his properties were not always accurate but said the
errors were not relevant to the financial institutions that used them to
price deals.  </p>
<p>Donald Jr. and Eric Trump testified last week that the financial
documents at the heart of the case were not their responsibility, though
emails and other documents showed they may have been more involved than
their testimony indicated.  </p>
<p>Ivanka joined her father during his 2017-2021 term in the White
House, leaving her brothers in charge of the company during that time.
 </p>
<p>James said Ivanka nevertheless was involved in manipulating property
values.  </p>
<p>“She will attempt today to distance herself from the company, but
unfortunately the facts will reveal that in fact she was very much
involved,” James said on the courthouse steps.</p>
<p>In a ruling that found Trump, his adult sons and 10 of his companies
liable for fraud, Engoron described in scathing terms how the defendants
made up valuations. His ruling could strip Trump’s control of some of
his best known properties, though that order is on hold during
appeal.</p>
<p>James is seeking $250 million in fines, as well as restrictions that
would prevent Trump and his adult sons from doing business in New
York.</p>
<p>In addition to this case, Trump is a defendant in four separate
criminal cases, including two stemming from his attempts to overturn
Democrat Joe Biden’s 2020 presidential election victory.  </p>
<p>Nevertheless, opinion polls show he holds a commanding lead over
Republican rivals to face Biden next year.</p>

Voters Approve Abortion Rights Protections, Democrats Grab Control of
Virginia Legislature</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A year away from the country’s next presidential election, Democrats
and abortion rights advocates won a series of victories in elections in
several U.S. states Tuesday.</p>
<p>Voters in the state of Ohio approved a constitutional amendment
guaranteeing access to abortion and other forms of reproductive health
care.</p>
<p>The measure follows the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision last year to
overturn the 1972 Roe v. Wade decision that had protected abortion
rights.</p>
<p>Ohio was one of several states where an abortion ban went into effect
as a result of the court’s decision.</p>
<p>Before Ohio, voters in several other states, including California,
Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Montana and Vermont, adopted initiatives to
protect abortion access following the Supreme Court ruling last
year.</p>
<p>In Kentucky, Democratic Governor Andy Beshear won re-election Tuesday
after a campaign that included advocating for exceptions to the state’s
near-total abortion ban.</p>
<p>Voters in Virginia denied Republican Governor Glen Youngkin’s hope of
putting the state’s legislature in his party’s control. Democrats held
onto a slim majority in the state Senate while taking back a majority in
the House of Delegates.</p>
<p>Youngkin has proposed instituting a 15-week abortion ban in Virginia
except in cases of rape, incest or if the life of the mother is at risk.
 A Democratic majority in the legislature will block that effort.</p>
<p>Republicans did score a win Tuesday in the state of Mississippi,
where Governor Tate Reeves defeated Democrat Brandon Presley to earn a
second term in office.</p>
<p>November 2024 will feature a much bigger slate of national and state
elections, led by races for the U.S. president, all 435 seats in the
U.S. House of Representatives and new terms for 33 seats in the U.S.
Senate.  </p>
<p>There will also be special elections to finish the final years of
Senate terms for two seats, one left vacant by the death of Democrat
Dianne Feinstein and the other by Republican Ben Sasse’s resignation to
become a university president.</p>
<p>Democrats currently hold a narrow majority in the Senate, while
Republicans have a small majority in the House.</p>
<p>Eleven states will hold elections for governor in 2024, while voters
in most of the 50 states will cast ballots in legislative races.</p>

House Votes to Censure Rep. Tlaib Over Her Israel-Hamas Rhetoric in
Stunning Rebuke</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The House voted late Tuesday to censure Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib
of Michigan — the only Palestinian American in Congress — an
extraordinary rebuke of her rhetoric about the Israel-Hamas war.</p>
<p>The 234-188 tally came after enough Democrats joined with Republicans
to censure Tlaib, a punishment one step below expulsion from the House.
The three-term congresswoman has long been a target of criticism for her
views on the decades-long conflict in the Middle East.</p>
<p>The debate on the censure resolution on Tuesday afternoon was
emotional and intense. Republican Rep. Rich McCormick of Georgia pushed
the measure in response to what he called Tlaib’s promotion of
antisemitic rhetoric. He said she has “levied unbelievable falsehoods
about our greatest ally, Israel, and the attack on October 7.”</p>
<p>With other Democrats standing by her side, Tlaib defended her stance,
saying she “will not be silenced and I will not let you distort my
words.”</p>
<p>She added that her criticism of the Jewish state has always been
directed toward its government and its leadership under Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>
<p>“It is important to separate people and government,” she said. “The
idea that criticizing the government of Israel is antisemitic sets a
very dangerous precedent. And it’s been used to silence diverse voices
speaking up for human rights across our nation.”</p>
<p>That criticism reached new heights after the Oct. 7 attack by the
terrorist group Hamas left hundreds of Israelis dead and scores injured.
Tlaib, who has family in the West Bank, came under heavy reproval after
she failed to immediately condemn Hamas after the attack.</p>
<p>All Democrats initially stood by Tlaib and helped defeat the first
censure resolution against her last week. But since then, many of her
colleagues, including prominent Jewish members, have become more
conflicted about her rhetoric about the war, especially because of a
slogan she has used frequently that is widely seen as calling for the
eradication of Israel.</p>
<p>Ultimately, more than 20 of them joined Republicans on Tuesday night
to censure her after an effort to shelve the measure failed earlier in
the day.</p>
<p>The latest censure push resulted in a dramatic vote on the House
floor amid political tensions over the ongoing, deadly Israel-Hamas
war.</p>
<p>While the majority of both parties have historically stood firmly on
the side of Israel, divisions have emerged in the Democratic Party about
the American response.</p>
<p>Rep. Brad Schneider, D-Ill., the lone Democrat to vote with
Republicans on Tuesday to advance the censure resolution, said he
believed it was important to debate the slogan “from the river to the
sea.”</p>
<p>“It is nothing else but the call for the destruction of Israel and
murder of Jews,” the Jewish Democrat said. “I will always defend the
right to free speech. Tlaib has the right to say whatever she
wants.”</p>
<p>He added, “But it cannot go unanswered.”</p>
<p>While the censure of a lawmaker carries no practical effect, it
amounts to severe reproach from colleagues, as lawmakers who are
censured are usually asked to stand in the well of the House as the
censure resolution against them is read aloud.</p>
<p>But the resolution against Tlaib did not call for the public
admonishment.</p>
<p>With the vote, Tlaib will become the second Muslim-American woman in
Congress to be formally admonished this year for her criticism of the
Jewish state.</p>
<p>Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., was removed in February from the House
Foreign Affairs Committee for similar comments she made about
Israel.</p>
<p>Some on the left have criticized President Joe Biden’s stance and
urged him to put conditions on U.S. support for Israel as its aggressive
military campaign drives the Palestinian death toll higher.</p>
<p>While the vote against Tlaib will take place against the
extraordinary backdrop of the war, the push to censure her is part of a
growing pattern in the House.</p>
<p>Censure had long been viewed as a punishment of last resort, just one
step below expulsion and to be triggered only for the most egregious
wrongdoing. But censure resolutions are quickly becoming routine in the
chamber, often wielded in strikingly partisan ways.</p>
<p>Many Democrats and some Republicans who opposed censuring Tlaib cited
free speech and warned of the precedent it would set.</p>
<p>“This resolution not only degrades our Constitution, but it cheapens
the meaning of discipline in this body for people who actually commit
wrongful actions like bribery, fraud, violent assault and so on,” said
Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., who defended Tlaib against the resolution on
the floor late Tuesday.</p>
<p>A second resolution by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., to censure
Tlaib had also been scheduled for a procedural vote late Tuesday night.
But that measure was put on hold after the censure resolution from
McCormick advanced to a final vote.</p>
<p>Tlaib is now the 26th person to ever be censured by the chamber, and
the second just this year. In June, Republicans voted to censure
Democrat Adam Schiff of California for comments he made several years
ago about investigations into then-President Donald Trump’s ties to
Russia.</p>
<p>When the House was under Democratic control, Republican Rep. Paul
Gosar of Arizona was censured in 2021 for tweeting an animated video
that depicted him striking Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of
New York with a sword. And Democratic Rep. Charlie Rangel of New York
was censured in 2010 over serious financial and campaign misconduct.</p>

<h2 id="maines-historic-public-power-push-goes-down-in-flames">Maine’s
Historic Public Power Push Goes Down in Flames</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-08, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDQyMTA3My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0MTEzNjM4NH0.BG6veVWjAouLpSqZz5v_EJhBHUOt2ITHGI58iO9i6r8/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p style>
An unprecedented “public power takeover” campaign in Maine failed on
Tuesday, according to a
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/11/07/us/elections/results-maine-question-3-create-pine-tree-power-co.html" target="_blank">projection
by <em>The New York Times</em></a>.<br/>
</p>
<p style>
The Maine ballot had asked voters if they wanted to create the Pine Tree
Power Company, a nonprofit electric utility governed by a
publicly-elected board, which would purchase and acquire all of the
investor-owned transmission and distribution utilities in Maine. When
the <em>Times</em> made its call, voters had rejected the initiative 71%
to 29%, with over a third of precincts reporting.
</p>
<p style>
The ballot question was the culmination of a multi-year campaign by a
group called Our Power, which initially brought the idea to a vote in
the Maine legislature in 2021. Though it passed, the bill was vetoed by
Governor Janet Mills, and supporters did not have the votes to override
the decision. Instead, they gathered the 63,000 signatures required to
put the question to Mainers on this year’s ballot.
</p>
<p style>
A growing contingent of the progressive climate movement is turning to
the idea of public power as a way to solve many aspects of the energy
transition at once. They argue that the system of providing electricity
through state-sanctioned private monopolies is incompatible with an era
of climate change, when utilities should be rapidly transitioning to
clean energy, while also growing and hardening the grid, and easing the
cost burden for the most vulnerable customers. The theory is that a
public utility, unencumbered by the need to turn a profit, will be able
to prioritize other public goals.
</p>
<p style>
Public power advocates in Maine offered voters a laundry list of other
reasons why they thought the state’s two investor-owned utilities, CMP
and Versant, should be replaced. Though it’s rare that anyone likes
their utilities, CMP and Versant are consistently rated the
<a href="https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2022-electric-utility-residential-customer-satisfaction-study" target="_blank">worst
for customer satisfaction</a> in the Northeast. CMP has faced multiple
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/a05f3fefce7f945f30a2e9d320302cbf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">investigations
and fines</a> over its billing system, customer service, and
<a href="https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/14/maine-utility-admits-solar-interconnection-faults-hiring-consultants/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">delays
connecting new solar projects</a> to the grid. Advocates also appealed
to nationalist views by highlighting the fact that both companies have
“foreign owners.” (CMP is owned by Iberdrola, a Spanish company. Versant
is owned by Enmax, a Canadian company owned by the city of Calgary.)
</p>
<p style>
But in the run-up to the vote, the two utilities spent millions of
dollars running targeted ads on social media and streaming services
calling the idea “too costly and too risky.” This “disaster for Maine”
would “hurt workers and small businesses,” they argued.
</p>
<p style>
A few key aspects of the takeover were uncertain, including the ultimate
cost of the acquisition, how long it would take to complete, and whether
the transition would result in lower rates for customers. Campaigners
essentially asked Mainers to take a leap of faith. They managed to
convince the city of Portland, but few other parts of the state appeared
to get on board.
</p>
<p style>
This was perhaps the most ambitious attempt at a public power takeover
the nation has seen since the early 20th century. But other, similar
efforts are underway in cities and towns all over the country, like Ann
Arbor, Michigan, and San Diego, California.

<h2 id="china-makes-largest-us-soy-purchases-in-months-traders">China
Makes Largest US Soy Purchases in Months: Traders</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>China booked its largest single-day U.S. soybean purchases in at
least three months on Tuesday, traders said, offering a glimmer of hope
for the most valuable U.S. farm export after overseas sales of the 2023
harvest had fallen well behind the normal pace.</p>
<p>Chinese importers bought around 10 cargoes of soybeans, or about
600,000 metric tons, for shipment from Gulf Coast and Pacific Northwest
export terminals between December and March, trade sources said.</p>
<p>The sales would be a relief to U.S. farmers, who have seen Brazil
dominate the global export market for soy as well as corn for longer
than normal this year.</p>
<p>If confirmed, Tuesday’s sales would be the largest single-day soybean
purchases by the world’s top soy importer since late July, according to
U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) daily sales data.</p>
<p>They were the latest in a series of soy import deals since late last
week by Sinograin, China’s state-owned importer, according to three
export traders with knowledge of the deals. Total purchases over that
time were estimated at as much as 20 to 25 cargoes, two traders
said.</p>
<p>Cash premiums for U.S. soybeans at Gulf Coast terminals GRYM, GRZD
jumped by as much as 10 cents a bushel on Tuesday as exporters scrambled
to source supplies, traders said.</p>
<p>High U.S. prices due to barge shipping disruptions and stiff export
market competition from Brazil, which harvested a record soy crop this
year, have hampered U.S. sales in the season so far.</p>
<p>Confirmed sales to China as of late October were down 35% from a year
ago, and sales to all destinations were down 28%. The USDA is currently
projecting a 12% year-on-year export decline.</p>
<p>But U.S. prices have become more competitive for shipments from
December through March, when Brazil’s next harvest will be
available.</p>
<p>The USDA has confirmed private sales totaling 236,000 metric tons of
U.S. soybeans over the past two days via the agency’s daily reporting
system. Traders expect additional “flash sales” following the deals on
Tuesday.</p>

<h2 id="us-nato-follow-russia-in-dropping-out-of-europe-arms-treaty">US,
NATO Follow Russia in Dropping Out of Europe Arms Treaty</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington and NATO allies said Tuesday they will echo Russia’s
suspension of a Cold War treaty to limit conventional arms proliferation
in Europe, with the White House saying it had “no option” but to leave.
 </p>
<p>Nonproliferation advocates said this won’t make a huge impact on the
battlefield.</p>
<p>Suspending the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE)
“will strengthen the [NATO] Alliance’s deterrence and defense capacity
by removing restrictions that impact planning, deployments, and
exercises — restrictions that no longer bind Russia after Moscow’s
withdrawal,” national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in a
statement.  </p>
<p>Treaty set limits</p>
<p>The 1990 treaty was designed to prevent either side of the post-Cold
War power structure — at the time, NATO and the former Soviet Warsaw
Pact — from being able to amass forces for a flash offensive. </p>
<p>It also set equal limits on the number of tanks, armored combat
vehicles, heavy artillery, combat aircraft and attack helicopters it
applied in the territory between the Atlantic Ocean and the Ural
Mountains. </p>
<p>John Kirby, director of strategic communications for the National
Security Council, said the U.S. had no better option but to pull out.
 </p>
<p>“I don’t know how we could justify not pulling out of it, given that
the Russians have decided unilaterally to just throw it in the trash
heap,” he said. “They left the United States and our NATO allies with no
choice but to cease our accommodations and compliance with the treaty,
as well.” </p>
<p>VOA asked if this decision could lead to NATO allies increasing the
footprint of conventional weapons in Ukraine.  </p>
<p>“As for future force posture, I certainly won’t talk about that from
this podium,” he said.  </p>
<p>NATO, which had criticized Russia’s June announcement to pull out,
defended its decision to do the same. In a statement, the 31-member
security alliance said they all support suspending their participation
“for as long as necessary.” </p>
<p>“Russia’s withdrawal is the latest in a series of actions that
systematically undermines Euro-Atlantic security,” NATO said in a
statement. “Russia continues to demonstrate disregard for arms control,
including key principles of reciprocity, transparency, compliance,
verification, and host nation consent, and undermines the rules-based
international order. While recognizing the role of the CFE as a
cornerstone of the Euro-Atlantic security architecture, a situation
whereby Allied States Parties abide by the Treaty, while Russia does
not, would be unsustainable.” </p>
<p>“The Treaty’s core objective, namely to ensure a balanced
conventional forces potential in Europe, cannot be achieved without
Russia,” Germany’s government said in a Tuesday statement explaining its
decision.  </p>
<p>Russia calls treaty ‘vestige of the past’</p>
<p>Russia gave its 150-day notice of withdrawal in June, arguing that
the treaty, forged in the ashes of the Cold War, was obsolete. It also
said the “last straw” for the decision was NATO’s decision to welcome
Finland and Sweden — both nonsignatories to the treaty — into the pact.
Finland borders Russia, and Moscow expressed concerns that it could be
used by third countries to amass weapons along Russia’s northwestern
border. </p>
<p>“It is clear that, in today’s conditions, the CFE has definitely
become a vestige of the past,” the Russian government said in a
statement. “Our opponents should not have any illusions about Russia
returning to the CFE compliance.” </p>
<p>Both U.S. parties agree on suspension</p>
<p>The U.S. decision was applauded by both parties, said U.S. Senators
Ben Cardin, a Democrat, and Jim Risch, a Republican. Both sit on the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee. </p>
<p>“This is an opportunity to reassess our force posture in Europe to
ensure we are ready to deter any Russian threats against U.S. national
security interests, including against our NATO allies and other regional
partners,” they said in a joint statement.  </p>
<p>But security and nonproliferation experts say this won’t make much
difference.  </p>
<p>“Russia stopped implementing the CFE treaty way back around 2007,”
John Erath, senior policy director at the Center for Arms Control and
Non-Proliferation, told VOA. “So, the implications are pretty much zero.
… The treaty has been dead for many years, and this is just further
acknowledgment that it is so.” </p>
<p>Pal Dunay, a professor of NATO and European security issues at the
George C. Marshall European Center for Security Studies, agreed in an
analysis he wrote when Russia issued its decision.  </p>
<p>“Russia’s decision to formally withdraw from the CFE Treaty will not
make much difference on the ground,” he wrote.    </p>
<p>But, Erath noted, one important thing will now change: Under the
treaty, signatories were required to send each other annual reports with
detailed information on their conventional forces. Russia, he said, did
not comply with that requirement, but was receiving the information from
the other signatories.</p>

<p>Fedora Workstation now features GNOME 45, which brings better

switcher and a much-improved image viewer. If you’re looking for a
different desktop experience, our Budgie Special Interest Group has
created Fedora Onyx, a Budgie-based “Atomic” desktop in the spirit of
Fedora Silverblue.  Of course, that’s not all — we also have updated
desktop flavors featuring KDE Plasma Desktop, Xfce, Cinnamon, and more.
As with every Fedora release, it comes with the latest and greatest
every one of the Linux desktops has to offer, as well as all the newest
versions of the various frameworks and underlying layers, down to the
kernel. Fedora KDE is my desktop of choice, so I’m definitely a bit
biased, but I can’t wait to load up the upgrade and install it.</p>

<h2 id="canada-wants-u.s.-offshore-wind-too">Canada Wants U.S. Offshore

<p>date: 2023-11-07, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p class="drop-caps" style>
The Northeast has a mismatch between its climate ambitions — some of the
most aggressive decarbonization targets in the country — and its
resources for renewable energy. While the Pacific Northwest has rivers
and gorges, the Southwest and Southeast have lots of sun, and the Great
Plains has lots of wind, the major renewable resource in the Northeast
lies on the Atlantic Ocean, where
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/offshore-wind-new-york-public-service-commission" target="_blank">plans
for billions of dollars in offshore wind investment</a> are being
delayed or even outright canceled as
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/offshore-wind-power-cost-expensive" target="_blank">high
costs take its toll on the industry</a>.
</p>
<p style>
But what the Northeast does have is a long border with Quebec.
</p>
<p style>
The Canadian province plays a major role in the decarbonization plans
for the entire region, thanks to the construction of transmission lines
that could conceivably shuttle power both ways across the border. The
Champlain-Hudson Power Express will connect 1,250 megawatts — enough to
power about one million homes — of Quebec’s hydro resources to New York
City by the spring of 2026, while the New England Clean Energy Connect
is scheduled to complete its construction through Maine down to
Massachusetts by 2025, conveying a similar amount of power.
</p>
<p style>
Quebec already is a world leader in decarbonization,
<a href="https://www.cer-rec.gc.ca/en/data-analysis/energy-markets/provincial-territorial-energy-profiles/provincial-territorial-energy-profiles-quebec.html" target="_blank">getting
nearly all of its electricity </a>from its massive network of dams
managed by the state-owned Hydro-Québec. But it also has its own power
needs — and ambitions — besides being a source of bulk power south of
the border.
<a href="https://www.hydroquebec.com/data/a-propos/pdf/action-plan-2035.pdf" target="_blank">The
province wants to fully decarbonize by 2050</a>, which means doubling
its electricity consumption and devoting a big chunk of additional
capacity to electrifying heat, transportation, and industry. That could
include using Quebec’s non-carbon-emitting power to
<a href="https://www.quebec.ca/en/government/policies-orientations/strategy-green-hydrogen-bioenergy" target="_blank">produce
hydrogen to replace fossil fuels in industrial processes</a>.
</p>
<p style>
“There is a selective approach taken — we don’t want all the demand,”
explained Serge Abergel, the chief operating officer of Hydro-Québec,
referring to which projects would get access to the province’s plentiful
and cheap renewable power. “We’re taking a selective approach with the
government of Quebec to determine which projects will bring most value
and transition the economy.“
</p>
<p style>
So where does that leave exports? Could the Northeast count on Quebec
for clean power as it sees, at best, delays in building out its own
renewable generating fleet?<br/><br/>“This relationship is evolving,”
Abergel told me. While the two transmission lines are under
construction, “it’s been a very difficult experience,” due to political
roadblocks, he said. The New England line took a famously circuitous
legal route to construction, having been first defeated in a referendum,
which was then overturned in a lawsuit.
</p>
<p style>
And as for new export projects, simply throwing up new transmission
lines south is a thing of the past, he said, having explained to
<em>Bloomberg</em> that its baseload commitments are reserved for the
New England and New York transmission lines. This means that any new
transmission lines — and there have been several proposed besides the
two under construction — will have to be more than just bulk power
exports. <br/>
</p>
<p style>
Going forward, Hydro-Québec wants to use its hydro power to
<em>complement </em>ample renewable resources in the neighboring regions
of the United States.
</p>
<p style>
“We believe our neighbors will stay the course,” Abergel said, referring
to neighboring states’ decarbonization plans. “There will be lots of
intermittent renewables all around us.”
</p>
<p style>
That combination of hydro power and wind power, John Parsons, a senior
lecturer in the MIT Sloan School of Management, told me is “a flexible
system … that can balance renewables in New England.” Theoretically,
when it’s very windy on the Atlantic Coast, a renewable-rich New England
(and New York) would sell power to Quebec, letting the province conserve
its hydropower (i.e. keep water in its reservoirs) for when the wind
dies down and renewables are not powering the Northeast’s whole grid.
</p>
<p style>
“Our resource is extremely flexible in terms of being dispatchable.
These two resources complement one another very well when you aim at an
100% clean grid,” Abergel told me.
</p>
<p style>
When Parsons and two colleagues modeled the flow of electricity between
New England and Quebec,
<a href="https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/130577/Two-Way%20Trade%20in%20Green%20Electrons-%20Deep%20Decarbonization%20of%20the%20Northeastern%20U.S.%20and%20the%20Role%20of%20Canadian%20Hydropower.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y" target="_blank">they
found</a> “it is optimal to shift … away from facilitating one-way
export of electricity from Canada to the U.S. and toward a two-way
trading of electricity to balance intermittent U.S. wind and solar
generation.” Making Canadian hydropower “a complement, rather than a
substitute” for low-carbon energy sources in the U.S. would make deep
carbonization about a fifth to a quarter cheaper.<br/><br/>But this
would require a change in mindset on both sides of the border — not to
mention to the economics of offshore wind. “It’s clear that policymakers
originally … did think of [hydro] as a substitute,” Parsons said. While
the existing transmission lines can send electricity both ways, the
market structure for large scale trading of electricity both ways
doesn’t exist, Parsons said. “The idea of it going two ways is not in
the current contracts … You have to sign protocols and negotiate
agreements to smooth out trade between.”
</p>
<p style>
Developers in the United States have heard loud and clear that Quebec is
interested in more than just sending power in one direction. The
proposed
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-announces-13-billion-build-out-nations-electric-transmission" target="_blank">Twin
States Clean Energy Link</a>, which recently won support from the
Department of Energy, is explicitly designed for electricity to flow
both ways. The planned line would run from the Canadian border
through<a href="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6401f652b7f983da69666fce/644fff5c735fb468378efc42_Twin%20States%20Detail%20Map%2005.01.23.pdf" target="_blank">
Vermont and New Hampshire</a>
</p>
<p style>
“As a bi-directional line, Twin States will enable clean energy
producers in New England, such as offshore wind, to export excess
capacity to Quebec during times of lower domestic demand, providing a
critical boost to the region’s clean energy economy,” according to the
project’s website, where it’s explicitly sold as a way to boost the
region’s wind power.
</p>
<p style>
While Abergel would not say what he directly thought about the specific
Twin States project, he did say that “so far we do have interest in the
concept” of connecting New England and Quebec into a regional balancing
system. “Much work needs to be done to determine how to bring value to
both regions.”
</p>
<p style>
“We’re at a crossroads right now where there’s a certain way of doing
things that’s now behind us, and being achieved, and we have this pause
where we reflect on the future and how to make it as efficient as
possible,” Abergel said. “There’s lots of opportunities,” he told me.
</p>
<p>
But, the idea that “we have lots of power to send down south and can do
another transmission line wherever, we’re not there anymore.”

<h2 id="us-aid-to-israel-trapped-in-government-funding-battle">US Aid to
Israel Trapped in Government Funding Battle</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. aid to Israel is at a standstill in the U.S. Congress as
lawmakers are running out of time to agree on billions of dollars in
security priorities before a short-term government funding bill expires
on November 17.</p>
<p>While Democrats and Republicans are broadly in agreement about
assisting Israel in the month-old conflict with Hamas, both parties have
attached conditions that have prevented the aid from moving forward.</p>
<p>The Democratic-majority Senate will not take up the $13.6 billion
bill providing funding for Israel’s air and missile defense systems
passed by the Republican-majority House of Representatives last week by
a vote of 226-196.</p>
<p>Democrats objected to Republicans paying for the aid to Israel by
making in-kind cuts to the budget of the Internal Revenue Service, the
agency responsible for taxation.</p>
<p>The House-passed legislation was the first major U.S. legislative
response to the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel under the leadership of
new House Speaker Mike Johnson.</p>
<p>“It’s an urgent necessity,” Johnson told reporters on Tuesday. “Some
of our Senate colleagues took issue with the pay-for that we put in
there, but I made the point that we can take care of our allies and
obligations and get our own fiscal house in order. Don’t forget, we have
a $33.6 trillion federal debt.”</p>
<p>Most House Democrats support sending aid to Israel but voted against
the bill because of the IRS budget cuts.</p>
<p>“Instead of passing life-saving aid to Israel that had an
overwhelming majority of support within the Congress, Johnson and the
MAGA [Make American Great Again], Republicans — for the first time in
Israel’s history — said that aid would only be available if we agreed to
their demands to pass public policy changes that make it easier for
billionaires to cheat on their taxes,” House Democratic Caucus Chairman
Pete Aguilar told reporters Tuesday.</p>
<p>Senate Democrats have also called for aid to Israel to be passed as
part of the White House’s broader $106 billion emergency supplemental
request, which includes a new round of aid for Ukraine’s defense against
Russia, funding to combat Chinese aggression in the Asia-Pacific region
and more money to secure U.S. borders.</p>
<p>“If Republicans inject partisanship into otherwise bipartisan
priorities, that is only going to make it harder to avoid a shutdown,
pass Israel aid, pass Ukraine aid, pass humanitarian aid for Gaza, and
all of our other priorities,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said
on the Senate floor Tuesday.</p>
<p>Republican support for additional aid to Ukraine has waned over
recent months, prompting Democrats to argue the security priorities
cannot be separated at a crucial time in the war.</p>
<p>“We are making a decision as we speak in the next several weeks about
whether Kyiv will be this time next year a Ukrainian city or a Russian
city. That is how serious the decision we are making is about our
support for Ukraine,” Democratic Senator Chris Murphy told reporters
Tuesday.</p>
<p>A group of Republican senators released a stand-alone border security
proposal that could serve as a negotiating point with Democrats to
compromise on aid for Ukraine. The proposal provides asylum and parole
reform while resuming construction of the wall at the U.S.-Mexico
border.</p>
<p>“President Biden’s immigration policies have put American workers
last and exposed our communities to crime and terrorism. This border
package will cut off the flow of illegal migration, prioritize
legitimate claims to entry, and restore order,” Republican Senator Tom
Cotton said in a statement.</p>
<p>Schumer said Tuesday that “making Ukraine funding conditional on the
hard-right border policies that can’t ever pass Congress is a huge
mistake by our Republican colleagues.”</p>
<p>The White House said its request for $60 billion in aid to Ukraine to
combat Russian aggression could not be separated from aid to Israel or
its own request for $14 billion in border security funding.</p>
<p>“The idea of an urgent supplemental is you’re submitting what you
think are urgent requests, and the president wants to see all of them
honored, all of them acted on, all of them together. We wouldn’t have
submitted it that way if we didn’t believe that they all weren’t
important,” John Kirby, White House national security spokesperson, told
reporters last week.</p>

Clean Energy Scandal Brings Down Portugal’s Prime Minister</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-07, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDQxNDkzMS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcwOTI3NzIzMn0.XbAj0c4-EPaYbLpMeTcoU60xQUNvtoUU-HrVqGozPDs/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p style>
As investment in renewable energy rises globally, so too does the
potential for massive corruption. This proved true on Tuesday, when
Portuguese Prime Minister António Costa resigned amid an explosive
investigation into his administration’s handling of lithium mining and
hydrogen projects.
</p>
<p style>
“The dignity of the functions of prime minister is not compatible with
any suspicion about his integrity, his good conduct, and even less with
the suspicion of the practice of any criminal act,” Costa said in a
tearful televised announcement on Tuesday.
</p>
<p>
While Costa assured viewers that he would be cooperating with
authorities in their investigation, he maintained his innocence, adding
that he is “not conscious of having done any illegal act or even any
reprehensible act.”
</p>
<p style>
Per
<a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/11/07/1211206454/portugal-prime-minister-antonio-costa-resigns" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NPR</a>,
the investigation involves “alleged malfeasance, corruption of elected
officials, and influence peddling” in awarding concessions for lithium
mines in northern Portugal, as well as a green hydrogen plant and
proposed data center in the town of Sines. Portugal’s large lithium
reserves are viewed as essential to the European Union’s green energy
transition because the mineral is used in the batteries powering
electric vehicles.
</p>
<p style>
Costa’s announcement came hours after police raided several public
buildings and detained Costa’s chief of staff, Vítor Escária. Arrest
warrants have also been issued for four other people in Costa’s inner
circle, including the mayor of the town of Sines. Prosecutors
additionally named infrastructure minister João Galamba as a formal
suspect in the corruption probe. These suspects, according to a
<a href="https://www.ministeriopublico.pt/" target="_blank">statement</a>
from the prosecutor general’s office, used Costa’s name and influence to
“unblock procedures” related to the exploration concessions.
</p>
<p style>
After taking office in 2015, Costa was re-elected with an absolute
majority last year, though his administration has been plagued by
scandal and allegations of misconduct ever since. In December 2022, his
infrastructure and housing minister was forced to resign amid a
controversy over an irregular severance payment made to a former board
member of the state-owned airline TAP Air Portugal.
</p>
<p style>
“It is a stage of my life that is finished,” Costa said in his
announcement, adding that he will not be running for office again.

<h2 id="no-let-up-in-attacks-on-us-forces-in-iraq-syria">No Let Up in
Attacks on US Forces in Iraq, Syria</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria have come under attack at least five
times over the past two days, according to U.S. defense officials, as
Iranian-backed militias persist in their nearly month-long campaign in
support of Hamas’ fight against Israel.</p>
<p>The Pentagon on Tuesday said the most recent rocket attack targeted
an installation in Syria known as Mission Support Site Euphrates but
added there were no injuries to U.S. forces and no damage to the base’s
infrastructure.</p>
<p>U.S. military officials earlier confirmed another attack Tuesday with
one-way drones targeting the air base in Irbil, Iraq.</p>
<p>Iranian-backed militias previously targeted Irbil Air Base on Monday,
while launching two attacks on U.S. forces near Tall Baydar in
Syria.</p>
<p>The Pentagon said none of the attacks caused any injuries or damaged
infrastructure.</p>
<p>“We’re seeing an uptick in attacks. But so far, we have not seen any
significant casualties. We’ve not seen significant damage to our
infrastructure,” Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh told
reporters Tuesday, confirming Iranian-backed militias have launched a
total of at least 40 attacks since October 17.</p>
<p>U.S. forces targeted</p>
<p>Twenty-two of the attacks have targeted U.S. forces in Iraq, with the
other 18 aimed at U.S. bases and personnel in Syria.</p>
<p>A total of 46 U.S. troops have been injured in the attacks, including
25 diagnosed with traumatic brain injuries, or TBI, as result of the
blasts from exploding rockets or drones.</p>
<p>Pentagon officials have described most of the injuries as minor,
saying 40 of the injured service members have returned to duty.</p>
<p>U.S. bolsters presence</p>
<p>In recent weeks, the United States has bolstered its force presence
in the Middle East, sending two aircraft carrier strike groups, dozens
of fighter jets, and a ballistic missile submarine to the region to
deter Iran and its proxies from expanding the conflict between Israel
and Hamas.</p>
<p>The U.S. also launched airstrikes on October 26 destroying two
weapons and ammunition storage facilities used by Iranian-backed
militias in Iraq.</p>
<p>“This is all about defending the people we have in Syria and Iraq,” a
senior U.S. military official said at the time, saying the facilities
were directly linked to attacks on U.S. forces.</p>
<p>‘An uptick in attacks’</p>
<p>Since then, Iranian-backed militias have increased the pace of
attacks on U.S. forces on the region, though Pentagon officials note
none of the attacks carried out after the U.S. airstrikes has caused any
injuries or damaged U.S. facilities.</p>
<p>“While we are seeing an uptick in attacks, our purpose is to ensure
that this conflict doesn’t widen out beyond Israel,” Singh told
reporters Tuesday. “So, I would say that deterrence right now is
incredibly strong on our side.”</p>
<p>She also denied the U.S. has been hesitant to retaliate for the drone
and rocket attacks.</p>
<p>“We decide to respond at a time and place of our choosing. We don’t
necessarily have to be tit for tat every single time,” Singh said. “We
are incredibly strategic about when we decide to take kinetic
action.”</p>

<h2 id="reactos-gets-initial-uefi-and-nt6-application-support">ReactOS
gets initial UEFI and NT6+ application support</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>The ReactOS project has published another newsletter filled with news
about their progress, and two things stand out. First, there’s now
initial support for booting using UEFI. Work has been underway since the
beginning of the year to transition FreeLoader, our default bootloader
for ReactOS, to support UEFI on x86 and AMD64, as well as ARM32 and
ARM64. Hermès has been developing a system for passing the UEFI
framebuffer information in a fashion that allows Windows XP to run on
UEFI systems, while Justin Miller (TheDarkFire) has been developing the
UEFI freeloader build. On top of supporting booting ReactOS, other
features are being built such as EFI chainloading and a
bootmgfw-compatible build of FreeLoader. These features would add boot
management capabilities and allow modern Windows systems to bootstrap
our favorite bootloader. Second, and this is a big one: work has been
done to add initial support for running Windows applications targeting
newer systems than Windows Server 2003. Up until now, ReactOS was
limited to running Windows applications targeting NT 5.2 found in Server
2003, but now work is being done to support appications targeting NT 6.0
and newer, as found in Windows Vista and newer. A group made up of Timo
Kreuzer, Justin Miller, and other developers and contributors alike are
developing the necessary APIs for compatibility with modern programs.
While Timo is still working on implementing a dynamic versioning system
for DLLs (#3239) that allows exporting of routines to applications
depending on their compatibility settings, he has added the option for
ReactOS bot builders to compile builds with NT6 exports which makes it
possible to experiment with NT6+ application compatibility. There are
also various improvements to the shell and debugger, but a new release
is still a ways away, so unless you want to dive into unstable builds,
there’s no way to test any of this just yet. Still, hose are some
massive projects being undertaken, and makes ReactOS a bit more prepared
for the future.</p>

<h2 id="us-viewed-as-isolated-in-diplomatic-fallout-of-gaza-war">US
Viewed as Isolated in Diplomatic Fallout of Gaza War</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>As Israel’s relentless bombing campaign over Gaza extends into its
second month, several countries have recalled their diplomats from Tel
Aviv over accusations of egregious war crimes.</p>
<p>“A genocide under the watch of the international community cannot be
tolerated,” Khumbudzo Ntshavheni, minister in the presidency of South
Africa, told reporters on Monday.</p>
<p>Turkey, Chad, Jordan, Bolivia, Chile, Bahrain, Honduras, Colombia and
South Africa have recalled their diplomats from Israel in protest of the
high number of deaths and the amount of destruction resulting from the
Israeli bombardment.</p>
<p>The bombings have killed more than 10,000 people in Gaza, including
over 4,000 children, according to the Gaza-based Ministry of Health, an
agency within the Hamas-led government.</p>
<p>Israeli officials say they are trying to minimize civilian casualties
but emphasize their resolve to eradicate the Hamas group, which they say
has placed key military sites close to hospitals and in densely
populated areas, effectively using civilians as human shields.</p>
<p>Hamas fighters killed 1,400 people and kidnapped over 200 others in
Israel last month.</p>
<p>The United States, historically a staunch ally of Israel, has rushed
to Israel’s support with $14 billion in emergency aid in addition to an
annual $3.3 billion in assistance. It has also used its veto to protect
Israel from critical resolutions in the United Nations Security
Council.</p>
<p>Last month, 120 U.N. member states voted for an immediate cease-fire
in Gaza, but the United States and 12 other states — among them Nauru,
which has a population of 10,800 — voted against the call.</p>
<p>“At present the U.S. seems somewhat isolated,” William Roebuck,
former U.S. ambassador to Bahrain, told VOA.</p>
<p>“I think it’s a temporary situation that reflects differences over
when a cease-fire should be called for and go into effect.”</p>
<p>Israeli and U.S. officials maintain that a cease-fire will benefit
Hamas, allowing it to prepare for yet another deadly attack on
Israel.</p>
<p>The United States has called for a “humanitarian pause” to allow
lifesaving aid to reach civilians in Gaza, but Israel has insisted any
halt to its bombardment must be accompanied by the release of all the
hostages.</p>
<p>“The sheer scale of Israel’s military operation in Gaza and the
simultaneously increased targeting of Palestinians by Israeli settlers
in the West Bank will likely lead more countries to consider diplomatic
moves such as public condemnation, delaying normalization talks (e.g.,
Saudi Arabia), or severing diplomatic ties,” Sarah Parkinson, a
professor of international studies at Johns Hopkins University, told VOA
by email.</p>
<p>China</p>
<p>This month, China is presiding over the Security Council meetings
where U.S., Russian and Chinese diplomats have already vetoed competing
draft resolutions aimed at addressing the crisis.</p>
<p>“As the rotating president of the Security Council, China will
continue to work with relevant parties to galvanize responsible Security
Council action and play an active and constructive role in ceasing the
hostilities, easing the humanitarian situation, and ultimately realizing
durable Palestinian-Israeli peace through the two-state solution,” Wang
Wenbin, a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said on
Tuesday.</p>
<p>While the call for a cease-fire has wider support among U.N. member
states, building consensus for it among the five permanent members of
the Security Council has been difficult if not impossible.</p>
<p>“The threat of a U.S. veto will make it impossible for China to get
anything out of the UNSC that’s critical of Israel, but if the fighting
continues and Washington concludes that this is damaging its position,
China may be able to get a resolution for a cease-fire that takes a
neutral stance and does not single out Israel,” Stephen Walt, a
professor of international affairs at Harvard Kennedy School, told
VOA.</p>
<p>Traditionally, every time Israel is involved in a war, the U.S. has
shielded it at the U.N. and other international bodies even at the cost
of appearing isolated and partial, experts say.</p>
<p>“The general calculation has been that when the conflict subsides,
often as the result of U.S. diplomatic efforts, the United States’
isolation will ease,” said Roebuck.</p>
<p>Criticisms</p>
<p>When defining U.S. “enlightened self-interest” in preserving a
rules-based international order in September, Secretary of State Antony
Blinken criticized Russia and China for standing isolated in dictating
their choices to other nations.</p>
<p>“They claim that what governments do within their borders is their
business alone, and that human rights are subjective values that vary
from one society to another,” Blinken said, adding that U.S. policy is
based on cooperating with other countries in solving global
challenges.</p>
<p>Over the past month, as Blinken toured the Middle East twice, he has
seen U.S. allies such as Jordan and Turkey criticizing Washington’s
unreserved support for Israel.</p>
<p>“For some countries, it looks like Western hypocrisy when Russia’s
invasion of Ukraine is strongly condemned, but Israel’s occupation of
Gaza is not condemned,” said Walt.</p>
<p>While vetoes have nearly paralyzed the Security Council on the Gaza
crisis, hundreds of thousands of people have marched in cities around
the world calling for an immediate cease-fire.</p>
<p>A pro-Palestinian protest in Washington on Saturday brought tens of
thousands of people within two miles of the State Department building,
demanding an end to U.S. aid for the Israeli military.</p>
<p>Despite their differences over a cease-fire, the United States is in
agreement with China and other countries in seeking an ultimate solution
to the Palestinian-Israel conflict.</p>
<p>“We remain committed to working towards a durable and sustainable
peace in the region, including the establishment of a Palestinian
state,” Blinken wrote on his official X account last week.</p>

“I choose to believe that future generations will look back on this
decade as the point at which we globally took collective action for our
planet… [and] became the architects of change towards a healthy and
sustainable world,” Prince William
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/07/climate/prince-william-earthshot-prize-2023-winners-climate-intl/index.html" target="_blank">said</a>
at the ceremony, which was held at Singapore’s Theatre at MediaCorp.
</p>
<p style>
The initiative launched in 2020 with the goal of boosting 50 such
environmental solutions by 2030, each year awarding prizes in five
categories: Protect and Restore Nature, Clean Our Air, Revive Our
Oceans, Build a Waste-Free World, and Fix Our Climate. Past winners
include an
<a href="https://earthshotprize.org/winners-finalists/kheyti/" target="_blank">Indian
producer</a> of small greenhouses that aims to help farmers become more

Fijian climate activist Ernest Gibson, Alibaba founder Jack Ma, and
others. The ceremony was co-hosted by actors Hannah Waddingham and
Sterling K. Brown, and celebrity presenters included Cate Blanchett and
Robert Irwin, the 19-year-old son of the late Steve “The Crocodile
Hunter” Irwin.
</p>
<p>
“It fills me with a lot of hope when there’s an incredible public
figure, a real voice for change, who is putting his platform behind
environmental issues,” Irwin
<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/royal-family/2023/11/04/prince-william-earthshot-prize-robert-irwin-praise/" target="_blank">said</a>
of Prince William. “And instead of focusing on all the ways the world is
suffering, [The Earthshot Prize is] an initiative that … is a beacon of
hope.”<br/>

<h2 id="syphilis-cases-in-us-newborns-skyrocketed-in-2022">Syphilis
Cases in US Newborns Skyrocketed in 2022</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Alarmed by yet another jump in syphilis cases in newborns, U.S.
health officials are calling for stepped-up prevention measures,
including encouraging millions of women of childbearing age and their
partners to get tested for the sexually transmitted disease.</p>
<p>More than 3,700 babies were born with congenital syphilis in 2022 —
10 times more than a decade before and a 32% increase from 2021, the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday. Syphilis caused
282 stillbirth and infant deaths, nearly 16 times more than the 2012
deaths.</p>
<p>The 2022 count was the most in more than 30 years, CDC officials
said, and in more than half of the congenital syphilis cases, the
mothers tested positive during pregnancy but did not get properly
treated.</p>
<p>The rise in congenital syphilis comes despite repeated warnings by
public health agencies, and it’s tied to the surge in primary and
secondary cases of syphilis in adults, CDC officials said. It’s also
been increasingly difficult for medical providers to get benzathine
penicillin injections — the main medical weapon against congenital
syphilis — because of supply shortages.</p>
<p>“It is clear that something is not working here, that something has
to change,” the CDC’s Dr. Laura Bachmann said. “That’s why we’re calling
for exceptional measures to address this heartbreaking epidemic.”</p>
<p>The federal agency wants medical providers to start syphilis
treatment when a pregnant woman first tests positive, rather than
waiting for confirmatory testing, and to expand access to transportation
so the women can get treatment. The CDC also called for rapid tests to
be made available beyond doctors’ offices and STD clinics to places such
as emergency rooms, needle-exchange programs and prisons and jails.</p>
<p>Federal officials again advised sexually active women of childbearing
age and their partners to get tested for syphilis at least once if they
live in a county with high rates. According to a new CDC map and
definition, 70% of U.S. adults live in a county with high rates. That’s
likely tens of millions of people, according to an Associated Press
estimate based on federal data.</p>
<p>The CDC’s recommendations are just that; there is no new federal
money going out to state and local health departments to bolster testing
or access. Some state health departments have already said they’re
stretched thin when it comes to treatment and prevention, although
Illinois announced last week it was starting a phone line for health
care providers to help with record searching, consultation and
assistance with mandatory reporting.</p>
<p>Syphilis is a bacterial infection that for centuries was a common but
feared sexually transmitted disease. New infections plummeted in the
U.S. starting in the 1940s when antibiotics became widely available and
fell to their lowest mark in the late 1990s. By 2002, cases began rising
again, with men who have sex with other men being disproportionately
affected, although the STD is spreading among several demographics.</p>
<p>In congenital syphilis, mothers pass the disease on to their babies,
potentially leading to the death of the child or health problems for the
child such as deafness, blindness and malformed bones. Case rates have
been rising across racial and ethnic groups.</p>
<p>Dr. Mike Saag, an infectious diseases expert at the University of
Alabama at Birmingham, said syphilis can be “a silent infection” in
women because it’s tricky to diagnose without a blood test — not
everyone gets painless sores, wart-like lesions or other visible
symptoms.</p>
<p>The CDC has long recommended that all pregnant women should be tested
for syphilis at their first prenatal visit, but poor access to prenatal
care — largely in rural areas of the U.S. — can make that difficult.
Nearly 40% of last year’s congenital syphilis cases involved mothers who
didn’t have prenatal care, the CDC said.</p>
<p>If syphilis is diagnosed early in a pregnancy, the threat of passing
it to the baby can be removed by a single penicillin shot. But experts
say the later one gets into pregnancy, the more likely one will need
multiple shots, and they have to be completed at least 30 days before
delivery.</p>
<p>“I have had patients who have been on (a three-shot) regimen who then
miss a shot,” said Dr. Nina Ragunanthan, an OB/GYN at the Delta Health
Center in Mound Bayou, Mississippi. “So they are trying to get their
shots, but if they don’t get the three in a row, because of
transportation issues, because of job issues, child care issues, any
number of reasons that prevent them from coming back, they don’t
complete their treatment.”</p>
<p>Plus, the shortage of shots makes the task of getting syphilis
numbers down difficult, health officials across the U.S. told the AP.
Patients who are not pregnant can use the antibiotic doxycycline to
treat syphilis, but health officials are concerned that the 14- to
28-day timeline of treatment is difficult to complete, leaving infected
people uncured.</p>
<p>Pfizer is the nation’s sole supplier of penicillin shots. Earlier
this year, company officials said penicillin was in short supply because
of increased demand. Pfizer also said the shortage may not be resolved
until next year.</p>
<p>The CDC said the shortage didn’t affect the 2022 congenital syphilis
case numbers and that, despite the shortage, it isn’t aware of patients
not getting their needed shots.</p>

Says Politics Didn’t Affect Hunter Biden Investigation</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. Special Counsel David Weiss, who is leading the probe into
President Joe Biden’s son Hunter Biden, told the Republican-led House
Judiciary Committee on Tuesday that he faced no political interference,
contradicting earlier whistleblower testimony. </p>
<p>Weiss has charged Hunter Biden, 53, with crimes related to owning a
firearm while using illegal drugs. The president’s son has said he
struggled with addictions to alcohol and crack cocaine.  </p>
<p>House Republicans allege the Justice Department improperly interfered
with the investigation of Hunter Biden, whose brushes with the law are a
central focus of their impeachment inquiry into the president. The White
House has denied wrongdoing. Democrats say the impeachment inquiry is
politically motivated. </p>
<p>“Throughout this investigation, the career prosecutors on my team and
I have made decisions based on the facts and the law,” Weiss said during
testimony behind closed doors, according to his prepared remarks.
“Political considerations played no part in our decision-making.” </p>
<p>Weiss insists on his authority</p>
<p>Weiss, the first special counsel to testify in Congress before his
final report is completed, is pushing back against comments by two
Internal Revenue Service whistleblowers who say he told officials at a
meeting that he did not have final authority on deciding to bring
charges as part of his probe.  </p>
<p>Weiss told lawmakers he has had and continues to have full authority
over his investigation. </p>
<p>In keeping with Justice Department policy, Weiss would not address
specifics about his probe.  </p>
<p>“Mr. Weiss reflected on his authorities, but then when we asked about
the influences on those authorities - were there emails or meetings
where people tried to move him in one direction or another? - he was
entirely recalcitrant,” Republican lawmaker Matt Gaetz told reporters.
 </p>
<p>Democrats participating in the interview sharply criticized it,
saying Republicans’ questions were misleading and labeling the meeting a
waste of time. </p>
<p>At least 10 current and former officials from the FBI, IRS and
Justice Department have testified behind closed doors as part of
lawmakers’ probe. Attorney General Merrick Garland also testified before
the House Judiciary Committee in a public hearing in September. </p>
<p>Trump cheers inquiry</p>
<p>The impeachment inquiry has been cheered on by Republican former
President Donald Trump, who is the frontrunner for the Republican
presidential nomination to take on Biden again in the 2024 election.
Trump is also the first U.S. president to be impeached twice. The Senate
acquitted him both times. </p>
<p>Trump is facing four criminal indictments for charges related to his
business activities, mishandling of classified documents, and attempt to
overturn the 2020 election. </p>
<p>It is not clear if the full House of Representatives, controlled by a
narrow 221-212 Republican majority, would support impeaching Biden. </p>
<p>Democratic lawmaker Glenn Ivey said the first hour or so of testimony
had mostly centered on letters between Weiss and lawmakers, and noted
that the interview was unprecedented. </p>
<p>“The irony is they’re always pushing to prosecute Hunter Biden, but
this is the kind of stuff that could derail or cause problems for it,”
Ivey told reporters. </p>
<p>Originally nominated during Trump’s administration, Weiss was allowed
to remain in place under Biden.</p>

the entire event was “Shot on iPhone.”

<p>
Then Apple posts a
<a href="https://youtu.be/V3dbG9pAi8I">behind-the-scenes video</a>
showing how this was done, revealing a rare and imposing glimpse into
the scale and scope of their industry-leading launch videos. At the
center of it all, instead of their customary
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arri_Alexa">Arri Alexa</a> (a
digital cinema camera costing $35–150K before you even add a lens, used
to shoot everything from <em>Avengers: Endgame</em> to <em>Barbie),</em>
was an off-the-shelf iPhone 15 Pro Max, gripped into truckloads of
professional support gear.
</p>
<iframe scrolling="no" allowfullscreen src="//www.youtube.com/embed/V3dbG9pAi8I?wmode=opaque" width="854" frameborder="0" height="480">
</iframe>
<p>
At this point, some folks felt differently about what was implied by
“Shot on iPhone.” There have been
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/31/23940060/apple-event-shot-on-iphone-behind-the-scenes">bad
takes</a> on this, and
<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/31/downplaying-shot-on-iphone">good</a>
<a href="https://joe-steel.com/2023-11-01-Videography-For-Dummies.html">takes</a>
on those bad takes.
</p>
<p>
Anyone who knows the tiniest bit about video production knows that the
camera is a small, but important, but <em>small,</em> part of the
overall production picture. “Shot on iPhone” doesn’t promise “and you
can do it too” any more than Stanley Kubrick lighting <em>Barry
Lyndon</em> with
<a href="https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/5059-kubrick-s-candle-tricks-in-barry-lyndon">candlelight</a>
means anyone with candles can make <em>Barry Lyndon.</em>
</p>
<p>
But when the camera is the least expensive piece of gear on the set
after clothespins and coffee, it does feel strange. I’ve been on a lot
of productions like this, having played an active role in the DV
filmmaking revolution of the late ’90s-to-early-2000s. It was an odd
feeling to scrounge for the adapter plates required to mount a $3,000 DV
camcorder purchased at Circuit City to a Fisher dolly that literally has
no purchase price.
</p>
<p>
Apple, of course, has no burden of best-practices logic for their
decision to shoot their “Scary Fast” event on iPhone — it’s a marketing
ploy, a cool stunt, and a massive flex. A thing to do for its own sake.
In the filmmaking community, it was the mic drop of the year. We
greedily soaked up all the details in the behind-the-scenes video, and
made a hundred tiny calculations about which aspects of this lavish
production actually mattered to the question of the iPhone 15’s validity
as a professional camera, and which did not.
</p>
<p>
With all that gear and production support, which aspects of the event
really matter to you, the iPhone-curious filmmaker? What can you learn,
and which aspects can you safely ignore?
</p>
<p>
Let’s take it one at a time:
</p>
<h2 id="that-they-did-it-does-matter">
That They Did It: Does Matter
</h2>
<p>
As camera features have played a larger and larger role in Apple’s
marketing for new iPhones over the years, you might have begun to feel a
bit of cognitive dissonance. Apple tells you about how great, and even
“pro,” these new iPhone cameras are — but would never have dreamt of
using them to shoot their own videos or product stills. Apple was
effectively saying “pro enough for you, but not for us.” Valid, but a
bit dissatisfying.

<p>
Apple has set the aesthetic bar impossibly high with these pre-recorded
events. They’re not just executives teleprompting in front of Keynote
slides — they feature “slice of life” moments shot on huge sets and real
locations. Elaborate visual effects transition between locations and
settings that might be partially virtual. These videos have looked great
ever since Covid pushed Apple to find an alternative to
executives-on-stage-in-front-of-slides, and even as Apple is now once
again able to welcome guests to in-person product launches, these
lavishly-produced videos are the new gold standard in pitching the world
on a new iThing.
</p>
<p>
With “Scary Fast,” Apple repeated their now well-established
high-production-value playbook, but yoinked out the professional cameras
and lenses, and dropped in a commodity consumer telephone in their
place.
</p>
<p>
And crucially, <em>none of us noticed.</em>
</p>
<p>
It’s a big deal.

<h2 id="they-shot-prores-log-matters-so-much-it-would-be-impossible-without-it">
They Shot ProRes Log: Matters So Much It Would Be Impossible Without It
</h2>
<p>
There is one single feature of the iPhone 15 Pro that made this stunt
possible: Log. As I detailed
<a href="https://prolost.com/blog/applelog">here in words and video</a>,
the “iPhone video look” is designed to win consumer popularity contests,
not mimic Apple’s own marketing videos, nor plug into professional
workflows.
</p>
<p>
It may be hard to imagine that a slightly different bit of signal
processing when recording a video file from a tiny sensor can make the
difference between consumer birthday-cam and professional viability, but
that is exactly the power of log. Apple Log has catapulted the iPhone
into filmmaking legitimacy.

Lighting matters more than any camera, more than any lens. As
<a href="https://prolost.com/blog/2009/4/13/fact-moment-light.html">I
wrote</a> in 2009:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Photos are nothing but light — it’s literally all they are made of.
Timmy’s birthday and Sally’s wedding are reduced to nothing but photons
before they become photographs. So getting the light right is more
meaningful to a photo than anything else.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Should you look at the giant lights in Apple’s video and feel dejected
that your own productions will never afford this level of illumination?
I say no, because a) you’re probably not lighting up the whole side of
an architectural marvel, and b) you’re probably not designing your
production around one of the world’s highest-paid CEOs.
</p>
<p>
For Tim Cook’s appearance, Apple’s production had their giant LED light
panels on camera dollies, which is not typical. The two reasons I can
image they did this are to be low-impact on the campus itself (rubber
wheels instead of metal stands), and to be able to adjust the lighting
quickly out of respect for Cook’s valuable time. It makes the lighting
rigs seem more complex than they really are.
</p>
<p>
What they really are is big, bright, and soft. And rather minimalistic —
mostly key, a bit of fill.
</p>
<p>
Big, soft LED lighting is actually quite affordable these days. I have
two

bi-color lights from Aputure</a>, and together they cost less than my
iPhone 15 Pro Max. I couldn’t cover Cook’s opening wide shot with them,
but I could get close.

<p>
I might also be willing to compromise on my ISO settings to work with a
smaller lighting package, where Apple seemingly was not. More on this
below.
</p>
<p>
So the lighting is important, but the quantity of it and the support
gear it’s on is specific to this rarified type of time-is-money,
night-exterior production. Don’t be distracted by the extra equipment,
focus on the fact that the lighting itself is actually rather spare.

The behind-the-scenes video is almost comical in its portrayal of the
iPhone gripped into all manner of high-end support gear.
</p>
<p>
You do not need any of this stuff.
</p>
<p>
I mean, every filmmaker <em>needs</em> a crane shot — but this is why
small cameras are so empowering: everything is a crane when your camera
weighs less than a Panavision lens cap!
</p>
<p>
Check out <a href="https://youtu.be/OnS5sLclqqY">this video</a> from
filmmaker Brandon Li. He uses a gimbal on a hand-held pole to create a
perfect crane shot for the opening of his action short. Toward the end,
he achieves a nifty top-down shot by… standing on a railing. All with a
camera substantially more cumbersome than a phone.

Apple used cranes and remote heads designed for big cameras because
that’s how they know how to shoot these videos. Apple’s marketing
department is large, and knows exactly what they need on these
productions. One thing they need is for a dozen people to watch the
camera feed, making sure everything is committee-approved perfect.

<p>
This kind of client-driven support gear compounds on its own
requirements. As Tyler Stalman points out in his
<a href="https://youtu.be/lDqQ_C5BkY4">excellent breakdown video</a>,
some of what’s bolted to the iPhones is simply a metal counterweight so
that a gimbal head, designed for a much larger camera, can be properly
balanced.
</p>
<p>
You can plug an external drive into the USB-C slot on the iPhone 15 Pro
Max, or you can plug in an HDMI adapter for a clean client feed. If you
want to do both, you need a USB-C hub, which at that point requires
power. So now you’ve got an Anton-Bauer battery pack mounted to this
tangle of gear.
</p>
<p>
When you don’t have clients, you can skip all that and just shoot. This
means you can replace most of the gear you see here with a
<a href="https://amzn.to/3stXw46">cheap consumer gimbal</a> — or a
tripod.
</p>
<p>
And here’s the key takeaway for this point: Apple achieved optimal image
quality from the iPhone in a number of ways, and one, I’m betting, was
by turning off image stabilization — which is only advisable when this
tiny camera is physically stabilized.
</p>
<p>
So you don’t need all the stuff Apple used, but if you want comparable
results, you need a way to mount your iPhone to something solid. Maybe
not a whole powered cage, but certainly a simple tripod mount. Then you
can eek out that last bit of extra image quality by turning off image
stabilization — which brings us to our next point:

The
<a href="https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/blackmagiccamera">Blackmagic
Camera app</a> has the option to turn off image stabilization, yes, and
also like a million other features. Manual, locking exposure control is
the top of the list, but there’s a ton more. The app includes a
false-color mode to help match exposure from shot to shot. It can load a
preview LUT, so you can shoot log but view something closer to what the
audience will see.
</p>
<p>
It’s silly to be grumpy with Apple for not offering this power in their
own camera app when they clearly worked with Blackmagic Design to have
this app available day-and-date with the iPhone 15.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and it’s free.

One slick feature of the Blackmagic Camera App is that you can choose to
express the shutter speed in degrees, like a cinema camera, rather than
fractions of a second, which is more typical in stills. A 180º shutter —
where the shutter is open for half the duration of a single frame,
e.g. 1/60th of a second at 30 fps — is important for a pro look.
Anything slower and you get smeary blur and a camcorder look. Anything
faster and your footage looks like you shot it on a phone, because 99%
of the time our iPhones are using insanely fast shutter speeds to handle
typical daylight. Look at any of your own daytime iPhone video — I’d be
surprised if you see any motion blur at all.
</p>
<p class>
Compare Apple’s motion blur to mine. 180º shutter vs. probably something
more like 1º.

They Shot at ISO 55: Matters to Apple’s Goal of Maximum Image Quality
</h2>
<p>
Here’s where the level of professional control over the lighting starts
to really matter: If Apple decided that they must shoot at ISO 55 (the
lowest, although possibly not the <em>native</em> ISO of the 1x camera)
for the highest image quality, and with a 180º shutter for the most
pro-camera look, that means they have no other control over exposure.
The iPhone 15 Pro 1x lens does not have a variable aperture, so shutter
speed and ISO are your only exposure controls.
</p>
<p>
When shooting in uncontrolled environments, the typical method of
limiting the amount of light entering the lens is via ND filters,
sometimes <em>variable</em> ND filters. I don’t see any evidence that
Apple used filters on this shoot, which would fit with their overall
prioritization of image quality over all else. So this goes back to
lighting — Apple’s team controlled that lighting perfectly, because they
opted out of any exposure control they might have had in-camera.
</p>
<p>
I’m curious to learn more about this setting though. YouTubers Gerald
Undone and Patrick Tomasso <a href="https://youtu.be/RNd74wyVtKw">did
some tests</a> and found that the best dynamic range from the iPhone 15
Pro came from ISO 1100–1450, with 1250 being their recommended sweet
spot. Did Apple prioritize low noise over dynamic range?
</p>
<h2 id="they-shot-30p-doesn-t-matter">
They shot 30p: Doesn’t Matter
</h2>
<p>
Apple has used 30 frames-per-second for these pre-recorded keynotes
since they started in September of 2020. They’re not trying to be
“cinematic,” they’re trying to make a nice, clean video that can take
the place of a live event. 30p is a choice, and a fine one for an
on-stage presentation. You might choose 24 or 25 fps for a more
narrative look, and that’s great too.
</p>
<p>
Note that Apple’s native Camera app offers 30.0 and 24.0 fps, but the
Blackmagic Camera app adds support for 29.97 and 23.976 fps, which are
the actual broadcast frame rates Apple uses for their productions.
</p>
<h2 id="they-focused-manually-doesn-t-matter">
They Focused Manually: Doesn’t Matter

<p>
The Blackmagic Camera app truly has a dizzying set of features, some
seemingly part of an attempt to win some kind of bizarre bet. Like
support for wireless external follow-focus controls? I mean, wow, but
also, really?
</p>
<p>
Sure makes for a cool behind-the-scenes shot, but I bet you can live
without this.

Matte boxes might feel like affectations in this context, but shielding
that tiny lens from glare is actually a significant way to improve
overall image quality. Luckily, you don’t really need a full-on matte
box to do this. A French flag will do it, as will your hand.
</p>
<p class>
If a bright light is dinging your little lens, you’re leaving a ton of
image quality on the floor.

The 1x camera, with image stabilization turned off, gives the

detecting a theme here? Apple imposed a number of limitations on how
they used the iPhone camera, seemingly always in the name of maximizing
image quality.

<p>
Eagle-eyed viewers noticed that an Adobe Premiere Pro timeline appears
behind the editor of “Scary Fast.” But we’re not in a real edit suite
here — we’re actually on one of the sets from the production. Did Apple
<em>really</em> edit in Premiere?
</p>
<p>
I have a feeling that this and Stefan Sonnenfeld’s interview were staged
on Apple’s standing sets rather than in real studio environements to
keep the production close to home, for cost, control, and secrecy
reasons. So let’s assume Apple really did cut in Premiere. This means
next to nothing. All editing software does the same job, and it’s
unlikely Apple would impose a workflow on the production company they
hired to both shoot and post-produce the video.
</p>
<p>
Other than of course to ensure that it be cut on a Mac. It’s interesting
to note that Apple’s Pro Workflows Group, representatives from which are
interviewed in the behind-the-scenes video, are a part of the hardware
division at Apple. Their charter is to promote and support professional
use of Apple <em>devices,</em> regardless of which software they’re
running.
</p>
<p>
Should FCPX users be
<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/11/02/tobin-bts-scary-fast">nervous</a>
that Apple might send it to live on a farm with Shake and Aperture? It’s
hard to regain our trust here, but Apple did just release a very nice
version for iPad a few months ago, and
<a href="https://www.polarpro.com/products/iphone-15-case?variant=iPhone15ProForest">substantial
updates</a> to that and the Mac version just yesterday.
</p>
<p>
So there’s really nothing to see here. Move along.

If you can get Stefan to color your video, <em>that’s</em> what matters
— not the tool he uses. Resolve is “free” (with many asterisks), but a
session at Company 3 is four-figures per hour.
</p>
<p>
Whether you use Resolve, Magic Bullet, or whatever else, what matters
here is that shooting log means color grading is not just possible, but
essential, and great care was taken with this part of the process.

<h2 id="this-all-makes-sense-why-do-i-still-feel-weird-about-it-">
This All Makes Sense. Why Do I Still Feel Weird About it?
</h2>
<p>
As much as I might disagree with an accusation that Apple was
disingenuous to say “Shot on iPhone” about a massive production with
seemingly unlimited resources, I understand where this feeling comes
from. “Shot on iPhone” carries with it the implication of accessibility.
We are meant to be inspired by this phrase to use a tool that we already
carry with us every day to capture videos that might transcend mere
records of our life’s moments, and become part of our artistic pursuits.
</p>
<p>
And we should absolutely feel that way about the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro
Max.
</p>
<p>
The reason we feel slightly disconnected from Apple’s impressive
exercise is not that they were dishonest — it’s that their priorities
were different from ours. Apple wants to sell iPhones, and to accomplish
this, they spared no expense to put the very highest image quality on
the screen.
</p>
<h4 id="as-a-filmmaker-you-care-about-image-quality-but-you-care-about-other-things-too-probably-more-">
As a filmmaker, you care about image quality, but you care about other
things too — probably more.
</h4>
<p>
Sticking to the 1x lens gives the best image quality, sure, but choosing
the right lens for the story you’re telling might matter more to a
filmmaker. You’ll probably use all the focal lengths Apple supplied.
</p>
<p>
As much as you might value the clean image that comes from shooting at
ISO 55, you might get more production value for your budget by using
smaller lights (or available light!) and accepting some noise at higher
ISOs.
</p>
<p>
You might truly appreciate the value of a 180º shutter, and simply not
always have a camera case/cage that allows you to mount a variable ND
filter to your telephone. I ordered one from
<a href="https://proloststore.com/products/applelog">PolarPro</a> the
day the iPhone 15 was released and it still hasn’t shipped, so I’ve shot
next to no 180º shutter footage so far.
</p>
<p>
You might well understand that turning off image stabilization will
improve your image — unless your shot is now wobbly, because you’re
shooting handheld out the window of a moving car. So maybe you’ll leave
stabilization on, and be a
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BZaekQujG3T/">human crane</a>, or
gimbal, or dolly, or all of the above.
</p>
<p class>
Never use the 5x lens. Never use image stabilization. Never shoot
through a dirty windshield. And never get this dope-ass shot.
</p>
<p>
Let’s be honest: If image quality is your top priority, there are much
better options for your next production than a consumer telephone. You’d
probably choose the iPhone for accessibility, nimbleness, ubiquity, and
cost. Those are great reasons, and when you pair them with image quality
that can be mistaken for high-end cinema camera footage by a veteran
colorist, you’ve got something magic.

So we may well ignore much of Apple’s implied advice, but we would do
well to follow some of it if we can:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Use camera support. Not crazy camera support, but some.
</li>
<li>
Use lights. Not crazy lights, but some.
</li>
<li>
Use a camera app that allows manual control, like Blackmagic Camera
</li>
<li>
Use 180° shutter, if you can (ND filters will help)
</li>
<li>
Keep light off of the lens using a $8,000 matte box or a bit of black
tape
</li>
<li>
Hire literally the world’s most famous colorist. Or just do some
<a href="https://prolost.com/blog/applelog">color correction</a>.
</li>
<li>
And most importantly, shoot in log, with a good preview

Shot on iPhone Means What it Means to You
</h2>
<p>
All of this is academic if you don’t go put it into practice. If you got
this far and feel empowered to wring the most out of your iPhone 15 Pro
with just the right amount of gear, that’s great. If you actively forget
all of this and occasionally flip on the Log switch so you can play with
the color of your iPhone videos in post, that’s great too.
</p>
<p>
Because here’s the thing: movies have already been shot on phones. No
production’s decisions validate any camera for all other production
needs. You decide what “Shot on iPhone” means to you, if anything. And
the way you decide is by getting out there and shooting something.

RX-7</a> dated November 1993, carrying the California license RX7 DSHR.
I bought it new and in the almost 30 years since have driven it for
nearly 140K miles. Unusually for an RX-7 this old, it is almost
completely stock and has never been on a track.<br /> <br /> Below the
fold, I recount an RX-7 saga spanning thirty-eight years and well over a
quarter-million miles.<br /> <span><a name='more'></a></span> <br /> I
moved to California to work at Sun Microsystems in September 1985, so I
needed a car. For the first few weeks, Andy Bechtolsheim lent me his
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porsche_944">Porsche 944</a>,
which was really fun to drive, but too expensive. On an earlier visit to
California a friend had driven me on part of Highway One in her
first-generation
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazda_RX-7#First_generation_(SA22C,_FB)">(FB)
RX-7</a>. I’d been impressed by the handling and the smooth power
delivery of the rotary engine, so I test drove a second-generation
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazda_RX-7#Second_generation_(FC3S_and_FC3C)">(FC)
RX-7</a>. It was immediately apparent that this was, in effect, a
Porsche 944 at half the price, so I bought one in white with the “Sport”
package (rear spoiler, stiffer suspension).<br /> <br /> The car had
more performance than I really needed and excellent handling although
the stiff suspension meant you really felt the “imperfections” in the
road surface. Driving to and from Lake Tahoe in ski season with chains
on was a bit of a trial. The FC served me well as my daily driver for
nearly a decade and around 125,000 miles. These included several long
road trips up the West Coast. The longest was from the Bay Area to Port
Angeles, WA to collect my mother off the ferry from Victoria, BC and
drive her back along the coast.<br /> <br /> Eventually the FC got
expensive to maintain and I needed a new car. By then Mazda had
introduced the third-generation
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazda_RX-7#Third_generation_(FD3S)">(FD)
RX-7</a>. I test-drove one and it was immediately apparent that it was a
huge step up from the FC; it was a Porsche 911 for half the price. Of
course, half the price of a 911 was still a lot more than half the price
of a 944, so I used a broker to find a base model in white. It was hard
to find; I subsequently discovered from Shawn Fanning that it was one of
only 13 1994 base models imported. The FD was my daily driver until
grandkids arrived; you can’t put a child seat in it and even now the
eldest is nearly my size their parents aren’t OK with them riding in
it.<br /> <br />

Some of the things that make the FD a wonderful driving experience
are:<br />
<ul>
<li>
The rotary engine, which is turbine-smooth as it races up to the 8,000
RPM red-line.
</li>
<li>
The light weight and stiff chassis.
</li>
<li>
The handling, thanks to its 49/51 weight distribution, wide track, short
wheelbase, firm suspension, low polar moment of inertia, and positioning
of the center of rotation right where the driver sits.
</li>
<li>
The gear-change which, while not quite as good as that on the MX-5, is
crisp, short and in the right place.
</li>
<li>
The driver-focused interior with seats that really hug you, a simple set
of classic analog dials, and no distractions — not even cup-holders!
</li>
</ul>

These days I fairly often get appreciative waves and comments from other
drivers. But my favorite was when, driving home from Mendocino, Vicky
&amp; I stopped for a short hike at
<a href="https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=438">Hendy Woods State
Park</a>. A 7-year old boy and his 5-year old brother watched us park,
and the elder excitedly announced “that’s a really cool car!”. I said “I
agree, but how did you know?” He replied “its in my video game.” My
guess is that it was <i>Gran Turismo</i>, but it could have been any of
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iX-NgifJO28">27
games</a>.<br /> <br /> You can get an impression of the FD from the
many reviews on YouTube, for example:<br />
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quLmDySyO7k">Hagerty</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZgOhP_RMSM">Doug DeMuro</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLaPPrXzpO0">The Straight

</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRzgp_XFkDs">Everyday
Driver</a> (300zx vs. Supra vs. RX-7)
</li>
</ul>
The three things every RX-7 review agrees on are that they are
unreliable, that you have to watch out for the huge surge of power when
the second turbo kicks in, and that the FD is among the best-handling
sports cars ever.<br /> <br /> The late, great
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Chapman">Colin Chapman
CBE</a> famously advised designers to
“<a href="https://www.classicdriver.com/en/article/genius-colin-chapman-simplify-then-add-lightness%E2%80%9D">simplify,
then add lightness</a>”. Some things about the RX-7 are far from simple,
such as the dual sequential turbochargers, but Mazda definitely added
lightness. My RX-7 weighs 2789lb (GVWR 3210lb); it was around 1000lb
lighter than the competition at the time, such as the Toyota Supra. For
comparison, the recent lightened, super-sporty Porsche Carrera T
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/11/porsche-911-carrera-t-first-drive-simplify-then-add-the-right-options/">weighs
3254lb</a>, 17% more. Of course, the Porsche has a 3.0 liter twin-turbo
flat-6 giving it 357HP for 220HP/ton whereas three decades earlier the
RX-7 only had a 1.3 liter twin-turbo dual-rotor giving 255HP for
183HP/ton.<br /> <br />

My favorite weight-saving example is that the jack is made out of
aluminum! It weighs only 3lb. As
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKLZtS2QVY">Jason Cammisa
explains</a>, an obession with light weight was key to the design of the
MX-5 Miata, by far the most successful sports car in history. In three
and a half decades the MX-5 has gained only about 100lbs.<br /> <br />
As regards unreliability, well yes, depending on how you treat an RX-7.
All that weight-saving and power increase doesn’t come for free, and
things under the hood get really hot. The real reason the RX-7 is still
on the road after nearly 140K miles and running well is the wonderful
Ivan Koinok, who has taken care of it almost the whole time. The major
items he has replaced include:
<ul>
<li>
Factory re-manufactured engine (water seals failed at 110K miles)
</li>
<li>
OEM stock turbo (oil leak)
</li>
<li>
OEM stock flywheel and clutch (I cooked it)
</li>
<li>
Competition radiator
</li>
<li>
OEM front struts
</li>
<li>
secondary air injection pump
</li>
<li>
central processing unit
</li>
</ul>
Except in stop-and-go traffic, driving the FD is a joy. Fortunately,
California is well-equipped with RX-7-friendly roads, including CA1
South from Carmel through Big Sur, and North from Mill Valley to Fort
Bragg, CA20 from Fort Bragg to Willits, and CA128 from Cloverdale to the
coast.<br /> <br />

<p>PS: Our other car is parent-approved for grandkid transportation. It
is a base model 2012
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_1_Series_(E87)">BMW 128i
coupe (E82)</a> in white with no options. It was also a really difficult
car to find; it took the dealership many weeks to find one on a ship
heading for Eureka via Long Beach.<br /> <br /> It is also a very
enjoyable car to drive, being the last year the 128i coupe had the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_N52">3.0 liter naturally
aspirated straight six</a>. This generation of the 1-series was the
basis for the legendary skunk-works project that developed the
<a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a15125348/2011-bmw-1-series-m-coupe-test-review/">1
series M coupe</a>
(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xkv4PiD0To">Chris Harris
loves his</a>). Our old 128i is the way non-M BMWs used to be before
they got fat and soft and turned into SUVs — a relatively (but compare
with the 1970 BMW 2002) small 2-door with a big straight six, rear-wheel
drive, good handling, and none of the modern driver distraction
technology.<br /> <br /></p>

Naomi Alderman’s ‘The Future’ (permalink) Naomi Alderman burst onto the
scene in 2016 with The Power, an explosive and brilliant feminist
apocalyptic parable. Now, seven years later, she’s back with a chunky,
propulsive second novel about a very different sort of apocalypse: The
Future:
https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Future/Naomi-Alderman/9781668025680
The Power was a thriller about a mysterious force that gives women the
power to administer violent electric shocks – even lethal ones – from
the palms of their hands. As this power races around the world, the
status quo is abruptly shattered. Abusers get nasty surprises. The Saudi
government topples. Parents of teenaged boys demand sex-segregated
classes to protect their sons from vicious girls:

In The Future, we get a very different kind of apocalypse: the imagined
apocalypse of the prepper. At the core of prepperism is a fantasy: that
the world will experience a cataclysm that requires the special skills
and supplies of the prepper themselves. Water chemists who turn prepper
fantasize about attacks on the water-supply – not because there’s any
special reason to expect one, but because if terrorists attack the water
supply, then water chemists become civilization-rescuing heroes:
https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/22/preppers-are-larpers/#preppers-unprepared
(And of course, if the world ends in such a way that marauding bandits
rove the wasteland, eating their former neighbors, then macho,
AR-15-obsessed musketfuckers get to reinvent themselves as warlords who
defend the sheeple from “bad guys.”) This is what makes billionaire
prepper fantasies just so weird – for most of us, it’s hard to imagine
how the skills of a billionaire are the one thing we’ll need to see us
through a crisis. But for billionaires themselves, the necessity of
billionaires in rebooting civilization is so self-evident as to be
unquestionable. What’s more, billionaires are convinced – more than any
of us – that the world is about to end. As Douglas <span
class="citation" data-cites="Rushkoff">@Rushkoff</span> puts it, these
guys want to earn enough money to outrun the consequences of how they’re
making all that money. This is #TheMindset, the idea that your own
position has jeopardized civilization itself, but that also, you must
survive the cataclysm, because only you can survive it. Rushkoff
chronicles the real-world fantasies of luxury bunkers patrolled by
mercenaries locked into explosive discipline collars in his book
Survival of the Richest:
https://pluralistic.net/2022/09/13/collapse-porn/#collapse-porn But
billionaires don’t just suck at running civilization, they also suck at
making up stories about its collapse. One thing that’s striking about
Rushkoff’s ethnography of rich people preparing to outlive the end of
the human race is how banal their eschatological fantasies are. It’s not
that there aren’t any exciting stories to tell about billionaire
survival fantasies. The granddaddy of these is, of course, Edgar Allan
Poe’s 1842 “#MasqueOfTheRedDeath”:
https://www.poemuseum.org/the-masque-of-the-red-death I published an
updated version with the same title in 2019 in my novella collection
#Radicalized:
https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/14/masque-of-the-red-death/#masque In
The Future, we get a cracking, multi-point-of-view adventure novel about
billionaires prepping for the end of the world. Three billionaires, the
lords of thinly veiled analogs to Facebook, Google and Amazon, each
getting ready in their own way. Stumbling into their midst comes Lai
Zhen, a prepper influencer vlogger with millions of followers. When Zhen
becomes romantically entangled with Martha Einkorn, the top aide and
chief-of-prepping for one of these billionaires, she finds herself in
possession of an AI chatbot that is devoted to protecting a very small
number of people from incipient danger. This chatbot determines that
Zhen is being stalked by an assassin at a mall in Singapore, and guides
her to safety. The chatbot is a closely held secret among the tech
billionaire cabal. It is designed to monitor world events and predict
when The Event is imminent, be it disease, war, or other cataclysmic
disaster. With the chatbot’s predictive powers and its superhuman
guidance, the billionaires, their families, and their closest
confidantes will be able to slip away before the shit hits the fan, fly
by different private jets to one or another luxury bunker, and wait out
the apocalypse. Once the fires raging without have died down to embers,
the chatbot’s billionaire charges will emerge to assume their places as
wise and all-powerful leaders of the next human civilization. As you
might imagine, not everyone who finds out about this plan – including
various members of the billionaires’ families who are fully aware of
these rich, powerful people’s fallibility – is enthusiastic about it. As
we build toward a looming crisis, we cycle between these family members,
Zhen and her hacker buddies, and members of an online prepper community
where Einkorn is a kind of provocateuse and eminence grise. Alderman
skillfully maneuvers all these power players and blocs into position
before detonating the crisis that sets off the book’s second act, where
we get into some damned fine Masque of the Red Death territory, but clad
in Tony Stark mecha survival suits and against a backdrop of total
disaster. I won’t give away any spoilers here, except to say that there
are lots of twists (that won’t surprise readers of The Power, which had
its own excellent surprises). But without delving too deeply into the
fake-outs, crosses, and turns that Alderman lays, I will say that this
is a fantastic and incredibly satisfying comeuppance novel that gets
very deep into the ideology of wishing the world would end, and dreaming
that when it does, you will finally matter. Hey look at this (permalink)

<h2 id="what-would-you-spend-to-save-san-franciscos-ferry-building">What
Would You Spend to Save San Francisco’s Ferry Building?</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-07, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDI5NTg4Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcxOTY0NjYzNH0.UaG6RG0k2817cW5GbtCEhjQETfnClp93DX7NhbKoVLY/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps" style>
When San Francisco’s Ferry Plaza Farmers Market is in full Saturday
swing, one way to dodge the determined foodies and casual browsers is to
retreat to the plaza just 30 steps south of the Ferry Building. It sits
atop three tiers of dark-veined granite, accessible by two flights of
nine stairs or a ramp that ascends along the water to a trio of ferry
gates that, like the plaza, were completed in 2021.
</p>
<p style>
The chosen height hints at what someday might be the norm — the
elevation where San Francisco’s constructed shoreline will need to be to
serve as a protective buffer between the natural bay and the developed
city. Here, more than any place on today’s Embarcadero, you confront the
existential predicament facing the Ferry Building, nearby piers, and
resurrected waterfronts in other coastal American cities: sea level
rise.
</p>
<p style>
<br/>
</p>
<p class="drop-caps" style>
According to projections that were modeled by climate scientists in
2018, San Francisco Bay faces a 66% likelihood that average daily tides
will rise 40 inches by 2100, with roughly half of the increase during
the next 50 years and the pace accelerating after that. The same report
includes an extreme but peer-reviewed scenario where the projected
increase soars to 93 inches during that same period — making grim
numbers profoundly worse.
</p>
<p style>
So-called king tides already arrive monthly during the winter, a natural
occurrence related to the moon’s gravitational pull that can send waves
washing past Pier 14 into the Embarcadero’s protected bike lane. Behind
Pier 5, water swells up and over the edge of the public walkway. For
now, that occasional splash of excitement is less fearsome than fun —
but if current forecasts are anywhere near accurate, future generations
will face a double bind.
</p>
<p style>
The threat isn’t just that tides might creep upward as temperatures
increase. It’s that the extreme rainfall patterns we already experience
will grow more intense, those destructive storms that in recent years
have introduced terms like <em>atmospheric rivers</em> and <em>bomb
cyclones</em> into conversations about the weather. For instance, if
daily tides are a foot higher in 2050 than they are now — the “likely”
projection — a major storm could surge 36 inches beyond where it would
register today.
</p>
<p style>
In the case of the Embarcadero, the hypothetical one-foot rise coupled
with an “intense storm” — the sort that in the past might occur every
five years — would send bay waters rushing toward the roadway in a dozen
locations if the storm hit when winds were brisk and the tide was high.
Kick the downpour’s fervor to the scale of the bomb cyclone that hit the
Bay Area in October 2021 — a day-long deluge that was the equivalent of
what scientists call a 25-year storm — and the Embarcadero could be
closed for nearly a mile between Folsom Street and Pier 9. Water
spilling across the roadway could flow down into the BART and Muni
subway beneath Market Street, potentially paralyzing both systems.
</p>
<p style>
The new plaza and the elevated ferry gates might rebuke the surging
tides to come, but the landmark next door would be more vulnerable than
ever. The Ferry Building has ridden out many perils since opening day in
1898, from earthquakes and the onslaught of automobiles to political
tumult, misguided renovations, and the wear and tear of urban life. Now
it faces the implacable though seemingly far-off threat of rising
waters, as if nature was determined to restore the marshes and tidal
flats that long-dead San Franciscans covered and forgot.
</p>
<p>
The addition of the granite plaza is an indicator of the danger facing
the icon to its north. And it’s not as if our hefty landmark with that
vaulted concrete foundation can be jacked up out of harm’s way.
</p>
<p>
Or can it?

</p>
<p class="drop-caps" style>
Steven Reel headed west from Philadelphia in 1992 to earn a structural
engineering degree at Stanford University because, he says now,
“structural engineering means ‘earthquakes’ at Stanford, and earthquakes
make structural engineering a lot more interesting.” The Bay Area was a
good place to live, and local governments were investing heavily in
seismic upgrades after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. In 2010, Reel
successfully applied for a job at the Port of San Francisco and, to his
surprise, grew intrigued by the historic aspects of making an urban
shoreline function in the here and now.
</p>
<p>
“I’d start studying old engineering drawings for projects and then go
down the rabbit hole,” recalls Reel, an easygoing bureaucrat with a
beard that approached Rasputin-like proportions during the pandemic (he
since has trimmed it back). He also began to notice regional planners
stressing sea level rise in meetings.
</p>
<p>
His first project at the port was Brannan Street Wharf, where two
ramshackle piers midway between the Bay Bridge and the ballpark were
torn out and replaced by a four-hundred-foot-long triangular green. The
response to climate concerns involved a slight upward incline from the
Embarcadero promenade and a concrete lip along the edge (the same move
since used for the plaza near the Ferry Building).
</p>
<p style>
There was another natural threat to consider — the possibility that a
tremor on the scale of the Great 1906 San Francisco Earthquake could
strike again. Would the Ferry Building and the seawall hold, as before?
Or would the three-mile-long agglomeration of boulders and concrete give
way after all this time? Reel found himself with a new job title —
manager of the seawall program — and responsibilities that included a
$450,000 study with consultants being told to diagnose the barrier’s
health and prescribe possible remedies.
</p>
<p>
The findings, released in April 2016, answered some questions and posed
a host of others.
</p>
<p>
The good news is that even with a cataclysmic earthquake, “complete
failure of the seawall is unlikely.” The rocks and boulders that form a
dike beneath the concrete wouldn’t scatter like marbles. The Financial
District wouldn’t be sucked into the bay toward Oakland. But the
combination of sandy fill atop soft mud, behind an aged barrier with
thousands of potentially moving parts of varying size, is a dangerous
combination. The fill was “subject to liquefaction,” the report
confirmed, making it likely that the seawall could slump and lurch
outward.
</p>
<p style>
“A repeat of the 1906 earthquake is predicted to cause as much as $1b in
damage and $1.3b in disruption costs,” the report declared. Better to
strengthen the entire three-mile seawall before a disaster struck —
though the cost estimates to do this were “on the order of $2 to $3
billion.” The consultants also emphasized that even with an upgraded
seawall, the slow-moving threat posed by sea level rise “will
necessitate intervention … over the next 100 years.” Figure that in, and
the combined price tag approached $5 billion.
</p>
<p style>
The city approached voters with a $425 million bond in 2018 to fund the
first round of projects; smartly, the campaign emphasized seismic
concerns, lightening the ominous message with such creative touches as a
neighborhood brewpub’s limited-release sour beer dubbed “Seawall’s Sea
Puppy.” The bond passed with 83% support. “The earthquake message
resonates,” Reel says. “Without it, I don’t think all this would have
moved forward as it did.”
</p>
<p style>
It makes sense to tackle the easiest fixes early, given the seismic
threats posed to the Bay Area by the San Andreas and other faults.
Breaking a daunting future into manageable parts also allows the Port
and City Hall to shift attention from the more eye-popping aspects of
climate adaptation — such as how potions of the Embarcadero might need
to be raised as much as seven feet to prepare for 2100’s more extreme
projected water levels.
</p>
<p>
Which leads us back to the Ferry Building.
</p>
<p style>
As so often has been the case during the landmark’s history, far more is
at stake than one particular structure. If the Ferry Building in its
heyday represented San Francisco’s prominence within the region and
beyond, in the 21st century it embodies how urban waterfronts can be
reinvented without sacrificing their past identities. At the same time,
the building remains essentially the same as it was in 1898 — a heavy
structure of concrete and steel that covers two acres and rises from a
foundation atop bundled piles of tree trunks.
</p>
<p style>
The assumption for the past 25 years has been that the landmark’s
impressive performance in 1906 and 1989 should ensure similar resilience
when the next big earthquake hits. But the most recent geotechnical exam
revealed a weak link: the section of the seawall behind the Ferry
Building rests in a trench filled with liquefiable sand rather than the
rubble that underlies almost everything else. That detail places “the
125-year-old Ferry Building Seawall, building substructure, and
surrounding piers at risk of damage in large earthquakes,” according to
the most recent Port update.
</p>
<p>
This isn’t just a concern for architecture buffs. San Francisco’s
disaster relief plans treat the outdoor spaces around the landmark as
crucial spots for retreat and regrouping. In a worst-case scenario where
the Bay Bridge is knocked out of commission, as was the case in 1989,
reliable access to a functioning ferry system will be crucial for
evacuating people from the downtown scene safely. The new plaza can also
serve as a staging area for bringing medical aid and supplies into the
city over the water. Regular people who need to connect with family and
friends know there won’t be confusion if someone says “let’s find each
other at the Ferry Building.”
</p>
<p style>
One solution could be to erect an entirely new seawall around the edge
of the Ferry Building’s foundation, in essence creating a basement
beneath it. And if you’re doing that, it’s only one more step — albeit
sure to be costly and complex — to raise the entire building by several
feet and resolve the challenge of sea level rise for another lifetime or
two.
</p>
<p style>
“With the Ferry Building, the one thing I know about it is that it has
to be saved … it has such a strong identification with the city,” Elaine
Forbes, the executive director for the Port, says. “So I talked myself
into okaying this big expenditure.”
</p>

</p>
<p class="drop-caps" style>
Realistically, adaptation planning in San Francisco and other waterfront
cities will involve a variety of responses at a variety of scales. But
the situation facing the Ferry Building, as at so many times in its
history, is unique unto itself. This time around, the task is to remake
a bustling civic icon so that life seemingly goes on as before. If
anyone has challenged the need to invest what likely will be hundreds of
millions of dollars to save a 125-year-old structure, the argument has
gained no traction.
</p>
<p style>
“The price would have to be really, really high before anything would
think twice” about whether the Ferry Building’s salvation is more
trouble than it’s worth, Reel says. He describes how during the public
discussions on what to do about the Embarcadero, attendees would be
asked to list priorities. <em>What are you concerned about? What do you
love?</em>
</p>
<p>
In the latter category, Reel recalls, “the Ferry Building kept getting
named. People want to see it forever.”
</p>
<p style>
This still leaves an array of unanswered questions. How to decide how
big of an engineering gamble to take. Whether to raise the structure, as
implausible as that sounds, or build a new seawall to the east that
would destroy the immediacy of the connection to the water. And what
becomes of the tenants inside the building, especially the locally based
merchants, if the building once again becomes a construction zone.
</p>
<p>
In a much different context, one San Franciscan offered a fatalistic
take on what the future might hold: Lawrence Ferlinghetti.
</p>
<p style>
Four years before his death in 2021, still living in North Beach,
Ferlinghetti sat down in a neighborhood café to talk with a
<em>Washington Post </em>writer about the beat era, the 97-year-old
poet’s life, and his enduring love for the city that he embraced long
ago. At one point, the writer asked Ferlinghetti about what might happen
after he was gone.
</p>
<p style>
“It’s all going to be underwater in 100 years or maybe even 50,”
Ferlinghetti said with a half-smiled shrug. “The Embarcadero is one of
the greatest esplanades in the world. On the weekends, thousands of
people strut up and down like it’s the Ramblas in Barcelona. But it’ll
all be underwater.”
</p>

id="special-counsel-in-hunter-biden-case-to-testify-before-lawmakers-in-unprecedented-step">Special
Counsel in Hunter Biden Case to Testify Before Lawmakers in
‘Unprecedented Step’</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The prosecutor overseeing the Hunter Biden investigation is expected
to testify on Tuesday, marking the first time a special counsel will
appear before Congress in the middle of a probe. It comes as House
Republicans are aiming to ramp up their impeachment inquiry into the
president and his family after weeks of stalemate.</p>
<p>David Weiss is set to appear for a transcribed interview before
members of the House Judiciary Committee as the U.S. attorney battles
Republican allegations that he did not have full authority in the
yearslong case into the president’s son.</p>
<p>“Mr. Weiss is prepared to take this unprecedented step of testifying
before the conclusion of his investigation to make clear that he’s had
and continues to have full authority over his investigation and to bring
charges in any jurisdiction,” Wyn Hornbuckle, a spokesperson for Weiss,
said in a statement Monday.</p>
<p>The rare move by the Justice Department to allow a special counsel or
any federal prosecutor to face questioning before the conclusion of an
investigation indicates just how seriously the department is taking
accusations of interference.</p>
<p>Weiss’ appearance comes after months of back-and-forth negotiations
between Republicans on the Judiciary Committee and the Justice
Department as lawmakers subpoenaed several investigators and attorneys
involved in the Hunter Biden case.</p>
<p>In July, Weiss, looking to correct the record of what he and the
department see as a misrepresentation of the investigation, agreed to
come to Capitol Hill but only if he was able to testify in a public
hearing where he could directly respond to claims of wrongdoing by
Republicans.</p>
<p>The two parties ultimately agreed on a closed-door interview with
both Democratic and Republican members and their respective staff.</p>
<p>The interview Tuesday is expected to focus on testimony from an
Internal Revenue Service agent who claimed that under Weiss, the
investigation into the president’s son was “slow-walked” and mishandled.
Weiss has denied one of the more explosive allegations by saying in
writing that he had the final say over the case.</p>
<p>Two other U.S. Attorneys from Washington and California testified in
recent weeks that they didn’t block Weiss from filing charges in their
districts, though they declined to partner with him on it.</p>
<p>But the IRS whistleblower, who testified publicly over the summer,
insists his testimony reflects a pattern of interference and
preferential treatment in the Hunter Biden case and not just
disagreement with their superiors about what investigative steps to
take.</p>
<p>Questions about Hunter Biden’s business dealings overall have been
central to a GOP-led impeachment inquiry into the president. That’s been
led in part by Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan, who is expected
to have a prominent role in the questioning Tuesday.</p>
<p>But what information, if any, Weiss will be able to provide to
Congress is unclear as under Justice Department policy and the law, he
will be unable to address the specifics of his investigation.</p>
<p>In general, open investigations are kept under wraps to protect
evidence, keep witnesses from being exposed, and avoid giving defense
attorneys fodder to ultimately challenge their findings.</p>
<p>In the Hunter Biden case, defense attorneys have already indicated
they plan to challenge the gun charges he is currently facing on several
other legal fronts and suggested that prosecutors bowed to political
pressure in filing those charges.</p>

<h2 id="ohio-deciding-abortion-rights-question-tuesday">Ohio Deciding
Abortion-rights Question Tuesday</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Ohio becomes the latest flashpoint on Tuesday in the nation’s ongoing
battle over abortion access since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a
constitutional right to the procedure last year.</p>
<p>Voters will decide whether to pass a constitutional amendment
guaranteeing an individual right to abortion and other forms of
reproductive healthcare.</p>
<p>Ohio is the only state to consider a statewide abortion-rights
question this year, fueling tens of millions of dollars in campaign
spending, boisterous rallies for and against the amendment, and months
of advertising and social media messaging, some of it misleading.</p>
<p>With a single spotlight on abortion rights this year, advocates on
both sides of the issue are watching the outcome for signs of voter
sentiment heading into 2024, when abortion-rights supporters are
planning to put measures on the ballot in several other states,
including Arizona, Missouri and Florida. Early voter turnout has also
been robust.</p>
<p>Public polling shows about two-thirds of Americans say abortion
should generally be legal in the earliest stages of pregnancy, a
sentiment that has been underscored in half a dozen states since the
Supreme Court’s decision reversing Roe v. Wade in June 2022.</p>
<p>In both Democratic and deeply Republican states — California, Kansas,
Kentucky, Michigan, Montana and Vermont — voters have either affirmed
abortion access or turned back attempts to undermine the right.</p>
<p>Voter approval of the constitutional amendment in Ohio, known as
Issue 1, would undo a 2019 state law passed by Republicans that bans
most abortions at around six weeks into pregnancy, with no exceptions
for rape and incest. That law, currently on hold because of court
challenges, is one of roughly two dozen restrictions on abortion the
Ohio Legislature has passed in recent years.</p>
<p>Issue 1 specifically declares an individual’s right to “make and
carry out one’s own reproductive decisions,” including birth control,
fertility treatments, miscarriage and abortion.</p>
<p>It still allows the state to regulate the procedure after fetal
viability, as long as exceptions are provided for cases in which a
doctor determines the “life or health” of the woman is at risk.
Viability is defined as the point when the fetus has “a significant
likelihood of survival” outside the womb with reasonable
interventions.</p>
<p>Anti-abortion groups have argued the amendment’s wording is overly
broad, advancing a host of untested legal theories about its impacts.
They’ve tested a variety of messages to try to defeat the amendment as
they seek to reverse their losses in statewide votes, including
characterizing it as “anti-parent” and warning that it would allow
minors to seek abortions or gender-transition surgeries without parents’
consent.</p>
<p>It’s unclear how the Republican-dominated Legislature will respond if
voters pass the amendment. Republican state Senate President Matt
Huffman has suggested that lawmakers could come back with another
proposed amendment next year that would undo Issue 1, although they
would have only a six-week window after Election Day to get it on the
2024 primary ballot.</p>
<p>The voting follows an August special election called by the
Republican-controlled Legislature that was aimed at making future
constitutional changes harder to pass by increasing the threshold from a
simple majority vote to 60%. That proposal was aimed in part at
undermining the abortion-rights measure being decided now.</p>
<p>Voters overwhelmingly defeated that special election question,
setting the stage for the high-stakes fall abortion campaign.</p>

id="the-supreme-court-takes-up-case-that-again-tests-limits-of-gun-rights">The
Supreme Court Takes Up Case That Again Tests Limits of Gun Rights</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The Supreme Court is taking up a challenge to a federal law that
prohibits people from having guns if they are under a court order to
stay away from their spouse, partner or other family members. The
justices are hearing arguments Tuesday in their first case about guns
since last year’s decision that called into question numerous gun
control laws.</p>
<p>The federal appeals court in New Orleans struck down the law
following the Supreme Court’s Bruen decision in June 2022. That high
court ruling not only expanded Americans’ gun rights under the
Constitution, but also changed the way courts are supposed to evaluate
restrictions on firearms.</p>
<p>Justice Clarence Thomas’ opinion for the court tossed out the
balancing test judges had long used to decide whether gun laws were
constitutional. Rather than consider whether a law enhances public
safety, judges should only weigh whether it fits into the nation’s
history of gun regulation, Thomas wrote.</p>
<p>The Bruen decision has resulted in lower-court rulings striking down
more than a dozen laws. Those include age restrictions, bans on homemade
“ghost guns” and prohibitions on gun ownership for people convicted of
nonviolent felonies or using illegal drugs.</p>
<p>The court’s decision in the new case could have widespread ripple
effects, including in the high-profile prosecution of Hunter Biden. The
president’s son has been charged with buying a firearm while he was
addicted to drugs, but his lawyers have indicated they will challenge
the indictment as invalid following the Bruen decision.</p>
<p>The outcome probably will come down to the votes of Chief Justice
John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh. They were part of the
six-justice conservative majority in Bruen, but Kavanaugh wrote
separately, joined by Roberts, to underscore that not every gun
restriction is unconstitutional.</p>
<p>The case before the court involves Zackey Rahimi, who lived near Fort
Worth, Texas. Rahimi hit his girlfriend during an argument in a parking
lot and then fired a gun at a witness in December 2019, according to
court papers. Later, Rahimi called the girlfriend and threatened to
shoot her if she told anyone about the assault, the Justice Department
wrote in its Supreme Court brief.</p>
<p>The girlfriend obtained a protective order against him in Tarrant
County in February 2020.</p>
<p>Eleven months later, Rahimi was a suspect in additional shootings
when police searched his apartment and found guns. He eventually pleaded
guilty to violating federal law. The appeals court overturned that
conviction when it struck down the law. The Supreme Court agreed to hear
the Biden administration’s appeal.</p>
<p>Rahimi remains jailed in Texas, where he faces other criminal
charges. In a letter he wrote from jail last summer, after the Supreme
Court agreed to hear his case, Rahimi said he would “stay away from all
firearms and weapons” once he’s released. The New York Times first
reported the existence of the letter.</p>
<p>Guns were used in 57% of killings of spouses, intimate partners,
children or relatives in 2020, according to data from the federal
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Seventy women a month, on
average, are shot and killed by intimate partners, according to the gun
control group Everytown for Gun Safety.</p>
<p>A decision in U.S. v. Rahimi, 22-915, is expected by early
summer.</p>

<p>A new U.S. political poll shows former President Donald Trump leading
President Joe Biden in a 2024 matchup in key battleground states, with
voters citing their long-held concerns about Biden’s advanced age and
the economy — but also, new concerns over a recent outburst of conflict
between Israel and Hamas. VOA’s Anita Powell reports from the White

<p>The top Republican Party presidential candidates are gathering on
Wednesday for the third debate of the year. This debate is expected to
differ from the rest as candidates try to set themselves apart with
their views on the Israel-Hamas war. As VOA’s Carolyn Presutti tells us,
that’s not the only change in this debate.</p>

Shows Trump Leading Biden in 5 Battleground States in 2024</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>President Joe Biden’s reelection campaign said Monday it’s not
worried after a U.S. political poll showed former President Donald Trump
leading Biden in a 2024 matchup in key battleground states.</p>
<p>In the poll, voters cited their long-held concerns about Biden’s
advanced age and the economy, but also new concerns over the recent
conflict between Israel and Hamas.</p>
<p>In a statement shared with VOA from Biden’s campaign, White House
assistant press secretary Kevin Munoz seemed unfazed.</p>
<p>“We’ll win in 2024 by putting our heads down and doing the work, not
by fretting about a poll,” he said.</p>
<p>The New York Times/Siena College poll predicts that Trump would
triumph over Biden in five of six swing states — Arizona, Georgia,
Michigan, Nevada and Pennsylvania. The poll showed Biden ahead in
Wisconsin.</p>
<p>Pollsters looked at the usual issues: abortion, preserving democracy,
the economy, national security and immigration — but also at how voters
see Biden’s handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict.</p>
<p>On Saturday, tens of thousands of protesters made their feelings on
that last issue clear, gathering at the White House gates to express
their dissatisfaction with Biden’s support for Israel.</p>
<p>Biden, meanwhile, is moving forward, crisscrossing the country to
sell Americans on how his administration has improved their lives. On
Monday in his home state of Delaware, he touted a $16 billion effort
along the Atlantic seaboard.</p>
<p>“Twenty-five different projects, all to build the Northeast Corridor
from Boston to Washington, is part of my agenda to invest in America,”
he said. “And I’ve been fighting for this for a long time.”</p>
<p>It’s a stark contrast to Trump’s approach. The former president also
spoke Monday as he arrived in New York to testify in a civil fraud case
over accusations that he wildly overstated his net worth. He claims that
his 91 felony charges, in four different jurisdictions, are all
politically motivated.</p>
<p>“I’m leading all over the place,” Trump said. “But it’s a very unfair
situation. This is really election interference. It’s kind of
ridiculous.”</p>
<p>Pollsters say no one should be surprised that Americans are so deeply
conflicted — but some, such as polling expert Mark Mellman and political
scientist Todd Belt, question this poll.</p>
<p>“Anybody who’s paid close attention, I think, to American politics
over the last number of years would assume it’s going to be a close
race,” said Mellman, a Democratic pollster who also leads advocacy group
Democratic Majority for Israel. The polls have consistently shown it to
be a very close race. I think this poll is a bit of an outlier. It shows
more support for Trump in some of these states than in lots of other
polls, too.”</p>
<p>Mellman said he reads this recent poll as showing rare voter
consensus on the Israel-Hamas conflict, in which both front-runners say
they strongly support Israel.</p>
<p>Some analysts say that predictions this far ahead of a poll aren’t
useful.</p>
<p>“People I have talked to from the Biden campaign have told me that
No. 1, it’s way too far out,” said Belt, a professor of political
management at The George Washington University. “And No. 2, they think
that when it comes down to a general election, and it’s a binary choice
between Joe Biden and Donald Trump, they think Joe Biden takes it
because they believe that people just don’t want to go back to the chaos
of the Trump years.”</p>
<p>The poll comes as Americans are voting this week, choosing state and
local representatives and ballot initiatives.</p>

Boat Captain Guilty of ‘Seaman’s Manslaughter’ in Fire Deaths of 34
People</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The captain of a dive boat that caught fire and sank off the
California coast in 2019, killing 34 people in one of the state’s
deadliest maritime disasters, was found guilty on Monday on a federal
charge of seaman’s manslaughter.</p>
<p>Jerry Boylan, 70, was found guilty by a U.S. District Court jury in
Los Angeles on a single charged count of “misconduct or neglect of a
ship officer” under a federal homicide statute dating from steamboat
accidents in the early 1800s.</p>
<p>The felony conviction, capping a 10-day trial, carries a maximum
penalty of 10 years in prison, according to Thom Mrozek, a spokesman for
the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Los Angeles. Sentencing was set for
Feb. 8, 2025.</p>
<p>Boylan was captain of the 75-foot dive boat Conception, which went up
in flames early in the morning on Sept. 2, 2019. The vessel was anchored
in Platt’s Harbor near Santa Cruz Island, off the Santa Barbara Coast,
during a sport diving trip.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thirty-three passengers and one member of the crew died in the Labor
Day holiday weekend blaze. They had been sleeping below deck when the
fire began.</p>
<p>The five surviving crew members, including Boylan, had been above
deck in berths behind the wheelhouse and escaped by leaping overboard as
the burning vessel sank into the Pacific. They told investigators that
flames coming from the passenger quarters were too intense to save
anyone trapped below.</p>
<p>But the jury unanimously agreed with prosecutors that Boylan, as
charged in the indictment, acted with “reckless disregard for human life
by engaging in misconduct, gross negligence, and inattention to his
duties.”</p>
<p>Among other lapses cited by prosecutors, Boylan neglected to maintain
a night watch or roving patrol as required, failed to conduct sufficient
fire drills and crew emergency training and left the vessel without
attempting to fight the blaze.”</p>
<p>Prosecutors said he was the first to abandon ship and did so without
using the boat’s public address system to warn passengers and crew about
the fire.</p>

id="high-level-us-china-trade-discussions-set-for-this-week">High-Level
US-China Trade Discussions Set for this Week</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will meet Chinese Vice Premier He
Lifeng for talks Thursday and Friday meant to continue a cautious
rapprochement on trade between the world’s two largest economies.</p>
<p>The meeting, which will take place in San Francisco, comes ahead of
an anticipated meeting between President Joe Biden and Chinese President
Xi Jinping later this month at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) forum.</p>
<p>For much of this year, U.S. officials have been working to improve
trade and other relations between China and the United States.</p>
<p>Yellen and other senior administration officials have visited China.
In September, Yellen and He created two “working groups” meant to
provide a means for the two governments to engage in discussions about
economic and financial policy. The working groups will meet again this
week.</p>
<p>Troubled relationship</p>
<p>Relations between the United States and China have been significantly
strained of late.</p>
<p>China accused the U.S. of actively attempting to suppress China’s
economic growth. Among Beijing’s complaints is that the Biden
administration has implemented a ban on the sale of certain high-tech
goods to China, plans to further restrict outbound U.S. investment in
China beginning next year, and has encouraged U.S. firms to diversify
their sources of critical goods and raw materials in order to reduce
U.S. reliance on Chinese imports.</p>
<p>For its part, the U.S. regularly complains that China’s policies are
designed to give its domestic companies — especially manufacturers — an
unfair advantage in global competition. The U.S. claims it does this by
offering extensive government support to companies and by placing
onerous restrictions on non-Chinese firms operating in China.</p>
<p>In the years prior to Biden taking office, former President Donald
Trump launched a trade war with China that imposed new tariffs on many
Chinese goods, most of which were left in place by the Biden
administration.</p>
<p>Despite the strains, trade between the two countries remains robust,
with the dollar value of total trade in goods at or near-record levels
in recent years.</p>
<p>Progress seen as unlikely</p>
<p>Experts told VOA they do not anticipate any big breakthroughs this
week.</p>
<p>“Quite frankly, I have pretty low expectations,” said Nicholas Lardy,
a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
“There’s a mismatch of expectations, I think. The Chinese agreed to set
up these discussion bodies because they want to talk the United States
into reducing some of the restrictions that have been imposed on
technology transfer and financial flows. And I think the U.S. has no
intention of doing that.”</p>
<p>“It’s very good that they’re talking, and maybe some better
understanding of everything will emerge, but I’m not expecting anything
dramatic,” Lardy said.</p>
<p>“My guess would be that we are likeliest to see incremental gains
rather than breakthroughs in the economic relationship ahead of APEC,”
Lily McElwee, deputy director and fellow in the Freeman Chair in China
Studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told
VOA.</p>
<p>“Yellen has made it clear she will bring up China’s coercive and
non-market-based economic practices when she meets with He, but I doubt
Beijing will be looking to concede much before Xi and Biden meet — which
in some ways is already seen as a concession, or at least Beijing doing
its part to keep relations stable,” McElwee said.</p>
<p>Seeking healthy competition</p>
<p>In advance of the meeting later this week, Yellen published an op-ed
Monday in The Washington Post laying out the U.S. position with regard
to China, as well as her hopes for the meeting.</p>
<p>She said the U.S. is not engaged in efforts to suppress China’s
economic growth, but that Washington simply wants “healthy competition”
that can benefit both countries.</p>
<p>“But healthy competition requires a rules-based, level playing
field,” Yellen wrote. “This week, I will speak to my counterpart about
our serious concerns with Beijing’s unfair economic practices, including
its large-scale use of non-market tools, its barriers to market access
and its coercive actions against U.S. firms in China.”</p>
<p>Yellen also repeated that the U.S. has no interest in an economic
“decoupling” of China and the U.S., which she said would be
“economically disastrous and run counter to our national interests.”
However, she said that the U.S. is making an effort to “diversify” its
supply chain of critical goods, thereby reducing reliance on China in
areas where their purchase had reached a level of
“overconcentration.”</p>
<p>Yellen offered no sign that the U.S. will reconsider its restrictions
on the export of sensitive technologies to China, but said the decisions
that led to that policy were rooted in national security concerns, not
in an effort to stifle China’s growth.</p>
<p>Economic shift </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The high-level meetings take place at a time when China is struggling
economically. An economic bounceback from the COVID-19 pandemic slowed
sharply earlier this year, and a cascading crisis in the country’s real
estate sector is dragging down the broader economy.</p>
<p>Recently, there have been signs that Beijing is embarking on a
strategy of directing government investments into the manufacturing
sector, hoping to spark growth. This is likely to renew U.S. concerns
about China giving unfair advantages to domestic firms competing on the
global market.</p>
<p>Whether or not an infusion of cash into the manufacturing sector will
produce the results Beijing is seeking is an open question. In recent
weeks, there has been a significant outflow of foreign funds from the
Chinese economy, a signal that international investors and companies
doing business in China have lost confidence.</p>
<p>“There is a reason foreign businesses are moving out of China,” said
McElwee. “Discriminatory Chinese regulations are part of the problem,
but so, too, are broader geopolitical uncertainties and questions about
where Xi Jinping intends to take the country and economy.</p>
<p>“I don’t see incremental changes to regulations or policies changing
this assessment,” she said. “And some of the
reshoring/friendshoring/diversification of supply chains is simple risk
management in ways that go beyond China. So yes, I think any moves that
seem to promise greater state intervention in the economy in favor of
domestic producers is likely to sour corporate sentiment further.”</p>

<p>date: 2023-11-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>Ironclad is a formally verified, hard real-time capable kernel for
general-purpose and embedded uses, written in SPARK and Ada. It is
comprised of 100% free software, free in the sense that it respects the
user’s freedom. Version 0.5.0 has been released. This release brings a
lot of improvements to mainly the scheduling, time keeping, userland,
and networking subsystems. The easiest way to try Ironclad, either
virtually or on real hardware, is to use a distribution that uses it –
Gloire seems to be the recommended option. Gloire is an OS built with
the Ironclad kernel and using GNU tools for the userland, along with
some original applications like gwm. This repository holds scripts and
tools to build the OS from the ground up. I had never heard of this
project before, but it seems incredibly cool.</p>

New Yorkers Occupy Statue of Liberty to Demand Gaza Cease-Fire</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Hundreds of U.S. Jewish activists peacefully occupied New York’s
Statue of Liberty on Monday to demand a cease-fire by Israel and an end
to the “genocidal bombardment” of civilians in Gaza. </p>
<p>Dressed in black T-shirts emblazoned with the slogans “Jews demand
ceasefire now” or “Not in our name,” the protesters unfurled banners
reading, “The whole world is watching” and “Palestinians should be free”
at the base of New York’s iconic landmark. </p>
<p>The huge copper statue sits on Liberty Island at the entrance to New
York Harbor. </p>
<p>“The famous words of our Jewish ancestor Emma Lazarus etched into
this very monument compel us to take action supporting the Palestinians
of Gaza yearning to breathe free,” Jay Saper of Jewish Voice for Peace,
or JVP, the gathering’s organizer, said in a statement, referring to the
19th-century activist who helped Jewish refugees fleeing to New York
from Europe. </p>
<p>The statement quotes Lazarus’s poem “New Colossus,” which is engraved
on the statue’s base as an ode to U.S. immigrants.  </p>
<p>Participants from the Institute for Middle East Understanding
demanded “an end to Israel’s genocidal bombardment of Palestinian
civilians in Gaza.” </p>
<p>“As long as the people of Gaza are screaming, we need to yell louder,
no matter who attempts to silence us,” said photographer Nan Goldin,
standing alongside several local elected officials, some with strong
roots in the political left. </p>
<p>New York City, a famed melting pot of migrants, has been rocked for
the past month by dueling pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian
demonstrations. </p>
<p>The city is home to some 2 million Jews and hundreds of thousands of
Muslims, and it so far has avoided any violence related to the conflict,
though tensions are palpable in certain spots such as university
campuses. </p>
<p>But opinions are not monolithic in either community. </p>
<p>A liberal segment of American Jewish youth — Jews vote overwhelmingly
for the Democratic Party — has unleashed harsh criticism of Israel,
which it accuses of perpetrating “genocide” on Palestinians in
Gaza. </p>
<p>They also denounce President Joe Biden’s military and diplomatic
support for Israel, which has engaged in a month-long bombardment of the
Palestinian territory since Hamas’s October 7 attack that Israeli
officials said left 1,400 people. </p>
<p>The death toll in Gaza surpassed 10,000 people Monday, according to
the Hamas-run health ministry.  </p>
<p>On Saturday, tens of thousands of demonstrators, some brought by JVP,
gathered in Washington to call for an immediate cease-fire in the Gaza
Strip, and to denounce U.S. policy of support for Israel.  </p>
<p>In late October, thousands of protesters, many gathered by JVP,
occupied the huge Grand Central train station in Manhattan with the same
demands. </p>
<p>Separately, thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters, including some
from U.S. Jewish organizations, shut down the Brooklyn Bridge, leading
from Manhattan to the multicultural and fashionable borough across the
East River.</p>

Michigan looks likely to pass an aggressive package of climate laws this
week, as the state’s Democrats are set to capitalize on their first
governing trifecta in nearly four decades.
</p>
<p>
The climate laws would require that 100% of Michigan’s electricity come
from carbon-free sources by 2040, putting the state on par with the
fastest state-level decarbonization deadlines nationwide.
<a href="https://www.lohud.com/story/news/ny-news/2022/12/20/new-york-passes-climate-plan-meet-net-zero-emissions/69742350007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">New
York</a>,
<a href="https://portal.ct.gov/Office-of-the-Governor/News/Press-Releases/2022/05-2022/Governor-Lamont-Signs-Key-Climate-Change-Energy-Legislation#:~:text=Connecticut%20has%20committed%20to%20getting,including%20supporting%20electric%20vehicle%20adoption." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Connecticut</a>,

and
<a href="https://www.oregon.gov/deq/ghgp/pages/clean-energy-targets.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Oregon</a>
also aim to achieve zero-carbon electricity by 2040.
</p>
<p>
The bills would also open a new Just Transition Office within the
Michigan Department of Labor and strengthen the state’s
energy-efficiency and utility laws.
</p>
<p style>
While other states have passed aggressive climate legislation, none of
them are as politically contested — or quite as central to national
politics — as Michigan.
</p>
<p style>
“What’s really exciting is that this is probably the most purple state
we’ve seen with a bold climate package on the cusp of the finish line,”
Courtney Bourgoin, a senior policy manager for
<a href="https://evergreenaction.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Evergreen
Action</a>, a climate advocacy group, told me.
</p>
<p>
“It’s going to be significant. This is a very pragmatic plan, but it
builds off a strong foundation that we have in Michigan,” state Senator
Sam Singh, who introduced one of the bills, told me. “It also positions
us well to pull down the federal dollars that are available for this
transition.”
</p>
<p>
Michigan’s Democrats are enjoying
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/nov/17/michigan-democrats-state-senate-house" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">their
first statehouse majority</a> in nearly four decades. They have already
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/right-to-work-repeal-michigan-democrats-b4304a2780909d37e76f211c7b070a6b" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">repealed</a>
the state’s anti-union “right to work” laws and
<a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/2023/03/16/michigan-lgbtq-protections-bill-civil-rights-law/69990432007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">passed
new LGBT protections</a>.
</p>
<p>
The suite of four climate laws passed the state House of Representatives
last week and is expected to go to the state Senate for a final vote in
the next few days. The Senate already approved an earlier version of the
legislation.
</p>
<p>
Governor Gretchen Whitmer is expected to sign the laws after passage. In
August, Garlin Gilchrist, the state’s lieutenant governor,
<a href="https://www.michiganradio.org/environment-climate-change/2023-08-11/whitmer-administration-signals-support-for-faster-climate-action-as-new-report-touts-benefits" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">suggested
in a speech</a> that Whitmer supported the laws. Whitmer’s
<a href="https://www.michigan.gov/egle/about/organization/climate-and-energy/mi-healthy-climate-plan" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MI
Healthy Climate Plan</a> initially proposed zeroing out carbon pollution
from the power sector by 2050, not 2040.
</p>
<p>
“The climate crisis is urgent,” Gilchrist
<a href="https://www.michiganradio.org/environment-climate-change/2023-08-11/whitmer-administration-signals-support-for-faster-climate-action-as-new-report-touts-benefits" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said
at the time</a>. “We need to act now. We need to act legislatively. We
need to act administratively.”
</p>
<p>
Here’s what the four proposed laws would do:
</p>
<p style>
<a href="https://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(vs45agcvvzple2z4rq123mr5))/mileg.aspx?page=GetObject&objectname=2023-SB-0271" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The
first law</a> sets a new, 100% clean-energy target by 2040. It also
rewrites the state’s existing renewable portfolio standard to require
that 60% of the state’s electricity come from wind, solar, or another
renewable source by 2034. (The remaining 40% of electricity could come
from nuclear power or natural gas with carbon capture.)
</p>
<p style>
<a href="https://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(isko21hvdzt33mjy0jbw2wel))/mileg.aspx?page=GetObject&objectname=2023-SB-0273" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The
second law</a> sets new energy efficiency requirements for the state’s
power and gas utilities. For the first time, utilities must spend at
least 25% of their efficiency funds on low-income communities.
</p>
<p>
The law also encourages utilities to electrify people’s homes in the
state by installing induction stoves or heat pumps. That’s particularly
important because Michigan ranks
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/state/?sid=MI" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">among
the top five states</a> for use of home-heating oil.
</p>
<p style>
<a href="https://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(jilergbbdcyawofz0cjnushn))/mileg.aspx?page=GetObject&objectName=2023-SB-0502" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">A
third law</a> will allow the state’s public service commission, which
regulates utilities, to consider climate and reliability questions while
planning the state’s electricity grid.
</p>
<p style>
<a href="https://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(cd4gcpduxdyfm3jjwmiyl4w4))/mileg.aspx?page=GetObject&objectName=2023-SB-0519" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The
final law</a> establishes a new Just Transition Office within the
state’s labor and economic-development office that will advise the
government about how best to retrain and help workers and communities
who are hurt by decarbonization.
</p>
<p>
The office, for instance, could help connect “internal combustion engine
vehicle workers” with retraining opportunities, counseling, skills
matching, and potentially ways to replace their lost income. Most of its
work would come from proposing new state programs, writing “transition
plans” for various industries, or identifying federal funding. (My sense
is that the office would be as effective and useful as the person
directing it.)
</p>
<p>
“We’re going to be working with industry and workers concurrently,”
Singh said. “I’m excited because we ensured that equity is part of the
conversation as well as making sure we put strong labor requirements in
as well.”
</p>
<p>
Another pair of proposals would let renewable-energy developers apply to
the state’s public service commission for permission to build a project
instead of going through a local zoning board. Michigan has highly
restrictive local-level zoning rules on building new solar and wind,
Sarah Mills, a University of Michigan researcher, told me.
</p>
<p style>
While those proposals have passed the House, their fate in the Senate is
less certain. The state’s fall legislative session ends on Friday.

release based on Qt5, before the next release moves to Qt6. LXQt 1.4.0
is based on Qt 5.15, the last LTS version of Qt5. If everything goes as
planned, this is the last Qt5-based release – we’ll do our best to port
the next release to Qt6, even if we’ll have to delay it. It’s loaded
with new features, bugfixes, and improvements, and, as always, will find
its way to your distribution of choice soon enough.</p>

<p>date: 2023-11-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>Cities: Skylines 2 like its predecessor is made in Unity, which means
the game can be decompiled and inspected quite easily using any .NET
decompiler. I used JetBrains dotPeek which has a decent Visual Studio
-like UI with a large variety of search and analysis options. However
static analysis doesn’t really tell us anything concrete about the
rendering performance of the game. To analyze what’s going with
rendering I used Renderdoc, an open source graphics debugger which has
saved my bacon with some of my previous GPU-y personal projects. An
incredibly detailed look at just what’s going on under the hood to make
the new Cities: Skylines 2 behave so poorly.</p>

<p>I’ve been working on getting anchor tag keywords into the search

webpage. The problem I’m attempting to address is that many websites
don’t really describe themselves particularly well. As Steve Ballmer’s
stage performance once illustrated, merely repeating a word doesn’t on
its own make what you’re saying relevant to the term. Another good
example of how it falls short is PuTTY’s website, which will be used as
a pilot case to improve.</p>
