## “I fixed a 6-year-old .deb installation bug in Ubuntu MATE and Xubuntu”

date: 2024-07-10, from: OS News

I love a good bug hunting story, and this one is right up there as a great one. Way back in 2018, Doug Brown discovered that after installing Ubuntu MATE 18.04, if he launched Firefox from the icon in the default panel arrangement to install Chrome from the official Chrome website, the process was broken. After downloading the .deb and double-clicking it, GDebi would appear, but after clicking &#8220;Install&#8221;, nothing happened. What was supposed to happen is that after clicking &#8220;Install&#8221;, an authentication dialog should appear where you enter your root password, courtesy of gksu. However, this dialog did not appear, and without thinking too much of it, Brown shrugged and just installed the downloaded Chrome .deb through the terminal, which worked just fine. While he didn&#8217;t look any deeper into the cause of the issue, he did note that as the years and new Ubuntu releases progressed, the bug would still be there, all the way up until the most recent release. Finally, 2.5 years ago, he decided to dive into the bug. It turned out there were lots of reports about this issue, but nobody stepped up to fix it. While workarounds were made available through wrapper scripts, and deeper investigations into the cause revealed helpful information. The actual error message was a doozy: &#8220;Refusing to render service to dead parents&#8221;, which is quite metal and a little disturbing. In summary, the problem was that GDebi was using execv() to replace itself with an instance of pkexec, which was intended to bring up an authentication dialog and then allow GDebi to run as a superuser. pkexec didn’t like this arrangement, because it wants to have a parent process other than init. Alkis mentioned that you could recreate the problematic scenario in a terminal window by running gdebi-gtk with setsid to run it in a new session. ↫ Doug Brown Backing up a few steps, if the name &#8220;gksu&#8221; rings a bell for you, you might have already figured out where the problem most likely originated from. Right around that time, 2018, Ubuntu switched to using PolicyKit instead, and gksu was removed from Ubuntu. GDebi was patched to work with PolicyKit instead, and this was what introduced the actual bug. Sadly, despite having a clear idea of the origin of the bug, as well as where to look to actually fix it, nobody picked it up. It sat there for years, causing problems for users, without a fix in sight. Brown was motivated enough to fix it, submitted the patch, but after receiving word it would be looked at within a few days, he never heard anything back for years, not helped by the fact that GDebi has long been unmaintained. It wasn&#8217;t until very recently that he decided to go back again, and this time, after filling out additional information required for a patch for an unmaintained package, it was picked up, and will become available in the next Ubuntu release (and will most likely be backported, too). Brown further explains why it took so long for the bug to be definitely fixed. Not only is GDebi unmaintained, the bug also only manifested itself when launching Firefox from the panel icon &#8211; it did not manifest when launching Firefox from the MATE menu, so a lot of people never experienced it. On top of that, as we all sadly know, Ubuntu replaced the Firefox .deb package with the SNAP version, which also doesn&#8217;t trigger the bug. It&#8217;s a long story for sure, but a very interesting one. It shows how sometimes, the stars just align to make sure a bug does not get fixed, even if everyone involved knows how to fix it, and even if fixes have been submitted. Sometimes, things just compound to cause a bug to fall through the cracks.

His campaigns received generous donations from fossil fuel interests. In 2012, Inhofe authored a book called <em><em>The Greatest Hoax: How the Global Warming Conspiracy Threatens Your Future</em></em>. In a 2015 stunt, he brought a snowball into the Senate in an attempt to prove that man-made global warming was not real. He opposed efforts to cap greenhouse gas emissions and once called the Environmental Protection Agency a “Gestapo bureaucracy.” He later went on to play a key role in transforming the EPA under former President Trump.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

## ‘It’s about survival’: Athens mayor focuses on getting capital through extreme heat

date: 2024-07-10, from: Ben Werdmuller's blog

    <div class="known-bookmark">
                <div class="e-content">
<p>[<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/10/athens-mayor-extreme-heat-greece">Helene Smith at The Guardian</a>]</p><blockquote><p>"Barely six months into the job, the mayor of Athens’s top priority is simple: ensuring that the people of Greece’s capital – mainland Europe’s hottest metropolis – survive the summer. After a June that was the hottest on record, the city has already witnessed record-breaking temperatures and wildfires."</p></blockquote><p>We're deeply into the climate crisis at this point; a major city having to make major changes in order to "survive the summer" is just another example.</p><p>When you get into the detail, it's terrifying - particularly considering that we're still only at the foothills of where the crisis will lead us:</p><blockquote><p>“It’s not a matter of lifestyle, or improving the quality of life; it’s about survival when 23% of the green lung around Athens has in recent years been destroyed by fires. It’s vital we have more trees, more air-conditioned community centres and more water stations on our streets and squares.”</p></blockquote><p>Over time, we're going to see mass migrations and real, sustained changes to the way people live. We're also going to see a great deal of suffering. These are things we've been warned about for many decades, but the stories are transitioning from projections from climate experts to being the news headlines.</p><p>The onus is on the international community to respond to the crisis with robust energy, but we've been waiting for decades for this to really happen. Instead we get carbon trading schemes and economic deals that don't cut to the core of the problem.</p><p>There's an individual responsibility, too. These days that responsibility goes beyond making sensible choices about our own energy use (although most of us don't) and extends to voting, taking to the streets, and making it clear to our leaders that continued inaction is not acceptable.</p><p>If there isn't change, wars will be fought over this. In a certain light, they already are.</p>

## Substack rival Ghost federates its first newsletter

<p>[<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/08/substack-rival-ghost-federates-its-first-newsletter/">Sarah Perez at TechCrunch</a>]</p><blockquote><p>"Newsletter platform and Substack rival Ghost announced earlier this year that it would join the fediverse, the open social network of interconnected servers that includes apps like Mastodon, Pixelfed, PeerTube, Flipboard and, more recently, Instagram Threads, among others. Now, it has made good on that promise — with its own newsletter as a start."</p></blockquote><p>I'm certain that this is a large part of the future of how information will be disseminated on the internet - and how publishers will run subscription programs. Subscribers who use the fediverse see the benefit of rich content that they can reshare and comment on; publishers <a href="https://werd.io/2024/the-fediverse-for-media-organizations">get to understand a lot more about their subscribers than they would from the web or email newsletters</a>.</p><p>Ghost's reader will certainly be augmented by other, standalone readers that work a bit like Apple News. Its fediverse publishing capabilities will be followed by other content management systems. Notably, Automattic has been working on fediverse integration, for example, and Flipboard has been doing amazing work in this area.</p><p>I'm also convinced there's room for another fediverse-compatible social network that handles both long and short-form content in a similar way to Substack's articles and Notes. If someone else doesn't build that, I will.</p><p><a href="https://werd.io/tag/Fediverse" class="p-category" rel="tag">#Fediverse</a></p>            <p>[<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/08/substack-rival-ghost-federates-its-first-newsletter/">Link</a>]</p>

## Rural Republicans Pushing Back Against School Voucher Expansions

date: 2024-07-10, from: Ben Werdmuller's blog

    <div class="known-bookmark">
                <div class="e-content">
<p>[<a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/rural-republicans-school-vouchers-education-choice">Alec MacGillis at ProPublica</a>]</p><blockquote><p>"Voucher advocates, backed by a handful of billionaire funders, are on the march to bring more red and purple states into the fold for “school choice,” their preferred terminology for vouchers. And again and again, they are running up against rural Republicans like Warner, who are joining forces with Democratic lawmakers in a rare bipartisan alliance. That is, it’s the reddest regions of these red and purple states that are putting up some of the strongest resistance to the conservative assault on public schools."</p></blockquote><p>This is heartening to see: a bipartisan push against the school voucher system. Public schools are important social infrastructure that deserve significantly more investment rather than having funds siphoned away to support exclusive institutions. A free market for schools is not the way - and clearly, the communities who would be most affected by a voucher system see this too.</p><p>This also feels like one of those rare moments where some Republicans are actively practicing old-school conservatism: the kind that isn't drawn from <em>The Handmaid's Tale</em>. That's nice to see, and I'd love to see more of it.</p><blockquote><p>"[Republican Representative] Greene believes vouchers will harm his district. It has a couple of small private schools in it or just outside it — with student bodies that are starkly more white than the district’s public schools — but the majority of his constituents rely on the public schools, and he worries that vouchers will leave less money for them."</p></blockquote><p>Exactly.

## How to Turn Any Old Car Into an EV

date: 2024-07-10, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjUyMTUyNS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcyODcyMjAxNH0.kOT7f_EljGxKIEriNHF9ppzL0kBwdIo7HseFo1MHGTI/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">When Adam Roe hits the accelerator and sends his vintage Land Rover flying past a Porsche, he likes to imagine what the other driver must be thinking.</p><p>While Roe’s ride looks the part of a restored Land Rover Series II, an off-roading, unbreakable icon from the late 1950s, the secret is what’s under the skin. Whereas the original bruiser produced about 45 total horsepower, Roe says, the “restomod” created by his company, ZeroLabs, is a fully electric vehicle with 600 horses — more than enough to catch a sports car by surprise.</p><p>Being a classic car enthusiast doesn’t have to mean burning fossil fuels anymore. ZeroLabs is part of a small but growing community of startup companies and DIYers who are transforming some of the most beloved vehicles of automotive history into zero-emissions EVs. The next time you see a beautifully restored boxy Chevy Blazer rolling down the highway, it might just be battery-powered. </p><p class="drop-caps">Patrick Mackey has been turning vintage Mazda Miatas into electric cars for more than a decade. Back in the 2000s, he wanted a fun but fully electric car like the original Tesla Roadster, but couldn’t afford what Elon Musk was asking. When he looked around at the kind of cars the DIY-inclined were hacking into EVs, he thought about small rides like the Toyota Yaris and Honda De La Soul. But it was the classic Miata — derided by muscle-heads as too wimpy, but beloved by car enthusiasts who recognize its compact greatness — that became the obvious choice.</p><p>“The Miatas have a great reputation for handling,” Mackey says. “They sold a ton of ‘em, so there’s a lot of ‘em out there and you can get one for a reasonable price.” Despite its small stature, the Miata was a sturdy car, with thick frame rails that are strong enough to hold a hefty EV battery back. (Mazda itself won’t be selling you an <a href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/2026-mazda-mx-5-miata-electrified-future-cars/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>electric Miata</u></a> until 2026, by the way.)</p><p>Initially, Mackey and his colleagues considered building their own EV conversions and selling them directly to people, like ZeroLabs does, or making kits to sell that would contain all the parts a person would need to turn a gas-powered Miata into an electric one. But the steel parts weighed a ton and wouldn’t fit inside one another for shipping, rendering the idea impractical. </p><p>Instead, Mackey’s <a href="https://ev-miata.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>EV Miata</u></a> website offers all the plans and fabrication documents a home mechanic would need to take on the job. It’s up to the builder to source the off-the-shelf electrical components to do the job, or, perhaps, to salvage them from a wrecked EV as many DIYers do now, he says.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image image-crop-3x2">
<img alt="Blueprint for engine rack." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="48bfe3f36a22da5054abbe02dee8a5b9" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="4cecd" loading="lazy" src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjY2NzE1Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3ODQ5NzgyMH0.TKmNtI7HQZuhQ0RFD0krJvu74G00-msNKh5Xy9m5nE4/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&quality=80&coordinates=373%2C0%2C407%2C0"/>
<small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Courtesy of EV-Miata.com</small></p><p>A surprising amount of the original Miata parts can survive the transformation. “You would keep the transmission and everything behind it, so that part of the powertrain you keep. You’d replace the motor with an adapter plate to connect the motor up to it. Then there’s the battery pack and the controller and all those E components come into play. But in that case, the majority of the car is there. If you are going racing, or you’re looking for something with higher performance, you could remove the transmission and then do a direct drive and have two or three motors that are driving the rear wheels.” Or, he says, some people are doing what’s called a stack replacement. They get a Nissan Leaf’s entire subframe, containing the axles and transmission and motors, and swap that into their EV conversion so it’s running on all Leaf parts.</p><p class="drop-caps">Car restoration has always been a money pit of a hobby. EV conversion is no different — you do it for love, not because it’s cheaper than just buying an electric car. Mackey says the EV Miata project probably costs about $22,000 now, not counting the cost of buying an old Mazda nor the sweat equity required to build it.</p><p>Nevertheless, plenty of people with the proper mechanical chops take on the challenge. At Caltech, where I work (and where lots of people are electrical engineers), there’s a vintage Porsche often plugged in next to me that was clearly hacked into an electric. With enough cash, you could buy a <a href="https://www.evwest.com/catalog/index.php?cPath=40" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>kit</u></a> to convert just about any classic car into an EV.</p><p>And the DIY EV is just one end of the spectrum. On the far side lies fully realized conversions like those by ZeroLabs, which specializes in not just electrifying, but modernizing Ford Broncos and other beloved SUVs of yore. </p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image image-crop-3x2">

<small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Courtesy of ZeroLabs.</small></p><p>“A restoration is to say, hey, we’re going to put this back to the original condition exactly as it would’ve been, which means no Bluetooth, no three-point seat belts. You got to use radial tires, you got to put on whitewalls. You got to use period-correct paint and AM radio and [an] ashtray. That’s a restoration. That’s not what we’re doing.”</p><p>Roe was inspired by a backcountry snowboarding trip when the engine on his old Bronco cut out, a problem that plagued the old SUVs. As it coasted silently, he fell in love with the idea of a classic car without all the noise. “You could hear the winds, you could hear the tires, you’re in your classic, but you’re also kind of with nature versus being hidden by this loud rumbly loud noise engine with your stereo,” he says.</p><p>In place of their original bare-bones interiors, ZeroLab’s reimagined EV trucks and SUVs have all the tech features of a modern vehicle. “We looked at everything that needs to be done for a modern car: How do we think about steering, how do we think about brakes, communication, upgradeability, and charging rates? All of that has changed, and so simply electrifying that car isn't really enough.”</p><p>Their creations aren’t for the faint of wallet. The fully realized ZeroLabs first-generation <a href="https://www.zerolabs.com/bronco" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Bronco</u></a> starts at nearly $300,000. But it seems there are plenty of wealthy buyers looking for a boxy, retro, or just plain eccentric electric car that doesn’t look anything like the production EVs now rolling off the assembly line. Roe exudes optimism that EV restomods will have their Tesla moment within the next couple of years — and the EVs that are old on the outside and new on the inside will be the next big thing.</p>

<em>Jesse is on vacation until August, so this is a special, Rob-only summer episode of Shift Key.</em>
</p><p class="drop-caps">
	Over the past few weeks, the U.S. Supreme Court has profoundly changed how the federal government does its day-to-day work. In a series of landmark rulings, the high court sharply curtailed the ability of government agencies — including the Environmental Protection Agency — to write and enforce rules and regulations.
</p><p>
	That will change how the federal government oversees the products we buy, the air we breathe, and the water we drink. But it could also alter how the government regulates heat-trapping greenhouse gas pollution.
</p><p>
	But how, exactly, will these new rulings affect climate law? And is there an upside to the deregulatory revolution? This week, Rob holds a roundtable with two environmental law experts about what the high court’s rulings mean for America’s decarbonization project — and whether the court just inadvertently made the country’s already burdensome permitting process even worse. They are Jody Freeman, a Harvard law professor and former Obama administration lawyer, and Nicholas Bagley, a University of Michigan law professor.

	Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p><blockquote>
<strong>Nicholas Bagley:</strong> I was working at the court and working for Justice Stevens when <em><em>Massachusetts v. EPA</em></em> was decided, and you know, even at the time, the level of frustration and even anger from the conservative justices — it was a 5-4 decision — was pretty intense. And since that time, of course, the conservatives have really consolidated their authority on the court.<br/>
<br/>
	And there are a lot of cases after 
	<em><em>Mass v. EPA</em></em> that accept the principle that EPA can regulate greenhouse gases while still finding ways to push back on agency efforts to do so. And so, is <em><em>Mass v. EPA</em></em> going to be overruled? Well, the court doesn’t tend to like to overrule statutory holdings. Once the Supreme Court has said <em><em>statute means X</em></em>, it gives that determination a very high degree of precedential effect, even more so than in the constitutional context. The theory is that if Congress doesn’t like what we said, Congress can always fix it. In the constitutional context, we actually have to be a little bit more flexible because Congress can’t just fix any mistakes that we might make. So there’s a kind of super <em><em>stare decisis</em></em>, is what they call it, a super precedential effect of that decision.<br/>
<br/>
	And so far, the court hasn’t decided to kind of go after that interpretation, and I’m not sure they will. And I’m not sure they need to [with] all of these different doctrinal outs that they’ve got: the major questions doctrine, 
	<em><em>we’re going to interpret your statute differently</em></em>, <em><em>we’re going to strike it down on arbitrary and capricious grounds</em></em>, it gives them all the tools they need to push back on EPA without actually taking the big, bold, and splashy step of overruling <em><em>Mass v. EPA</em></em>.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Jody Freeman: </strong>You can see all these cases as revenge for <em><em>Mass v. EPA</em></em>, a sort of reaction to <em><em>Mass v. EPA</em></em> in a funny way. I mean, to be sure, if the court currently constituted were to have to rule on that case, they would never have decided that the Clean Air Act authorizes regulation of greenhouse gas. So they’re fighting a rearguard action in all the ways Nick suggested.<br/>
<br/>
	This Supreme Court appears to be, as one scholar said, a sort of anti-novelty court. That is, agencies shouldn’t do new things, Congress should have to pass new statutes for that to happen. And it’s a really disabling notion because Congress passes broad statutes that say things like “protect the public health with an adequate margin of safety.” They give the agency broad authority to, say, protect workers against grave dangers in the workplace without necessarily defining what “grave danger” could mean, or what “public health protection” could mean, because they expect the agencies to develop their view over time, depending on what science says and what technology makes available and so on.
	<br/>
<br/>
	And this court seems to be opposed to evolution, right? To progress and letting agencies adapt over time. And in that sense, I think they’re a kind of small-C conservative court, in the sense that change is bad, and certainly regulatory change is bad unless Congress itself authorizes agencies anew to do something. And that, in and of itself, is, if not anti-regulatory, it’s hostile to any kind of innovation or adaptation by the federal bureaucracy.

## US-built pier will be put back in Gaza for several days to move aid, then permanently removed

date: 2024-07-10, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The pier built by the U.S. military to bring humanitarian aid to Gaza will be reinstalled Wednesday to be used for several days, but then the plan is to pull it out permanently, several U.S. officials said. It would deal the final blow to a project long plagued by bad weather, security uncertainties and difficulties getting food into the hands of starving Palestinians.


The officials said the goal is to clear whatever aid has piled up in Cyprus and on the floating dock offshore and get it to the secure area on the beach in Gaza. Once that has been done, the Army will dismantle the pier and depart. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because final details are still being worked out.


Officials had hoped the pier would provide a critical flow of aid to starving residents in Gaza as the nine-month-long war drags on. But while more than 8.6 million kilograms of food has gotten into Gaza via the pier, the project has been hampered by persistent heavy seas and stalled deliveries due to ongoing security threats as Israeli troops continue their offensive against Hamas in Gaza.


The decision comes as Israeli troops make another push deeper into Gaza City, which Hamas says could threaten long-running negotiations over a cease-fire and hostage release, after the two sides had appeared to have narrowed the gaps in recent days.


U.S. troops removed the pier on June 28 because of bad weather and moved it to the port of Ashdod in Israel. But distribution of the aid had already stopped due to security concerns.


The United Nations suspended deliveries from the pier on June 9, a day after the Israeli military used the area around it for airlifts after a hostage rescue that killed more than 270 Palestinians. U.S. and Israeli officials said no part of the pier itself was used in the raid, but U.N. officials said any perception in Gaza that the project was used may endanger their aid work.


As a result, aid brought through the pier into the secure area on the beach piled up for days while talks continued between the U.N. and Israel. More recently, the World Food Program hired a contractor to move the aid from the beach to prevent the food and other supplies from spoiling.


The Pentagon said all along that the pier was only a temporary project, designed to prod Israel into opening and allowing aid to flow better through land routes — which are far more productive than the U.S.-led sea route.


And the weather now is projected only to get worse.


The pier was damaged by high winds and heavy seas on May 25, just a bit more than a week after it began operating, and was removed for repairs. It was reconnected on June 7, but removed again due to bad weather on June 14. It was put back days later, but heavy seas again forced its removal on June 28.

## US judge's security shoots man during attempted carjacking, say authorities

date: 2024-07-10, from: VOA News USA

washington — A member of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor's security detail shot an armed man during an attempted carjacking in the early morning hours, according to court documents. 


It happened as two deputy U.S. Marshals were on duty in a government car in Washington about 1 a.m. on July 5. They were confronted by a man who got out of a silver minivan and pointed a gun at one of them through the driver's side window, according to a criminal complaint. The car was unmarked, but the pair were dressed in U.S. Marshals shirts. 


The deputy pulled out his department-issued gun and shot the man about four times, hitting him in the mouth. He then gave the man first aid while the minivan drove away, charges state. The suspect was hospitalized and placed under arrest on suspicion of attempted carjacking and resisting officers. 


A spokeswoman for the U.S. Marshals confirmed the deputies were part of the detail protecting Supreme Court justices. The deputies were stationed near Sotomayor's home.   


Sotomayor was not directly mentioned in court documents and there is no indication she was the target of the attack.   


It comes after a string of high-profile carjackings in the nation's capital last year. Other victims included a diplomat from the United Arab Emirates and U.S. Representative Henry Cuellar of Texas. Secret Service agents protecting President Joe Biden's granddaughter also opened fire after three people tried to break into an unmarked Secret Service vehicle last year. No one was struck. 


The overall number of carjackings is on the decline so far this year, according to police data.

## Russian election meddlers hurting Biden, helping Trump, US intelligence warns

date: 2024-07-10, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Russia is turning to a familiar playbook in its attempt to sway the outcome of the upcoming U.S. presidential election, looking for ways to boost the candidacy of former President Donald Trump by disparaging the campaign of incumbent President Joe Biden, according to American intelligence officials. 


A new assessment of threats to the November election, shared Tuesday, does not mention either candidate by name. But an intelligence official told reporters that the Kremlin view of the U.S. political landscape has not changed from previous election cycles.


"We have not observed a shift in Russia's preferences for the presidential race from past elections," the official told reporters, agreeing to discuss the intelligence only on the condition of anonymity.


The official said that preference has been further cemented by “the role the U.S. is playing with regard to Ukraine and broader policy toward Russia.”


The caution from U.S. intelligence officials comes nearly four years after it issued a similar warning about the 2020 presidential elections, which pitted then-President Trump against Biden.


Moscow was using “a range of measures to primarily denigrate former Vice President Biden and what it sees as an anti-Russia ‘establishment,’” William Evanina, the then-head of the U.S. National Counterintelligence and Security Center, said at the time.


“Some Kremlin-linked actors are also seeking to boost President Trump’s candidacy on social media and Russian television,” he added. 


A declassified post-election assessment, released in March 2021, reaffirmed the initial findings. Russian President Vladimir Putin authorized "influence operations aimed at denigrating President Biden's candidacy and the Democratic Party" while offering support for Trump, the report said. 


U.S. intelligence officials said they have been in contact with both presidential campaigns and the candidates but declined to share what sort of information may have been shared.


Trump pushback


The Trump campaign Tuesday rejected the U.S. intelligence assessment as backward.


"Vladimir Putin endorsed Joe Biden for President because he knows Biden is weak and can easily be bullied, as evidenced by Putin's years-long invasion of Ukraine,” national press secretary Karoline Leavitt told VOA in an email.


“When President Trump was in the Oval Office, Russia and all of America's adversaries were deterred, because they feared how the United States would respond,” she said.


“The only people in America who don't see this clear contrast between Biden's ineffective weakness versus Trump's effective peace through strength approach are the left-wing stenographers in the mainstream media who write false narratives about Donald Trump for a living," she added.




The Biden campaign has so far not responded to questions from VOA about the new U.S. assessment.


Russian sophistication


Russian officials also have not yet responded to requests for comment on the latest allegations, which accuse the Kremlin of using a “whole of government” approach to see Trump and other American candidates perceived as favorable to Moscow win in November.


“Moscow is using a variety of approaches to bolster its messaging and lend an air of authenticity to its efforts,” the U.S. intelligence official said. "This includes outsourcing its efforts to commercial firms to hide its hand and laundering narratives through influential U.S. voices."


Russia’s efforts also appear focused on targeting U.S. voters in so-called swing states, states most likely to impact the outcome of the presidential election, officials said.


Some of those efforts have already come to light.


Russia and AI


Earlier Tuesday, the U.S. Department of Justice announced the seizure of two internet domains and of another 968 accounts on the X social media platform, part of what officials described an artificial intelligence-driven venture by Russian intelligence and Russia’s state-run RT news network.




A Justice Department statement said Russian intelligence and RT used specific AI software to create authentic-looking social media accounts to mimic U.S. individuals, “which the operators then used to promote messages in support of Russian government objectives.”


A joint advisory, issued simultaneously by the U.S., Canada and the Netherlands, warned Russia was in the process of expanding the AI-fueled influence operation to other social media platforms.


The U.S. intelligence official who spoke to reporters Tuesday described such use of AI as a “malign influence accelerant,” and warned the technology had already been deployed, likely by China, in the run-up to Taiwan’s elections this past January.




China waiting


For now, though, U.S. intelligence officials see few indications Beijing is seeking to interfere in U.S. elections, as it did in 2020 and 2022. 


China “sees little gain in choosing between two parties that are perceived as both seeking to contain Beijing," said the U.S. intelligence official, noting things could change.


“The PRC is seeking to expand its ability to collect and monitor data on U.S. social media platforms, probably to better understand and eventually manipulate public opinion,” the official said. “In addition, we are watching for whether China might seek to influence select down-ballot races as it did in the 2022 midterm elections.”


The Chinese Embassy in Washington, which has denied previous U.S. allegations, responded by calling the U.S. “the biggest disseminator of disinformation.”


“China has no intention and will not interfere in the US election, and we hope that the US side will not make an issue of China in the election,” spokesperson Liu Pengyu told VOA in an email.


‘Chaos agent’


The new U.S. election threat assessment warns that in addition to concerns about Russia and China, there is growing evidence Iran is seeking to play the role of a “chaos agent” in the upcoming U.S. vote.


“Iran seeks to stoke social divisions and undermine confidence in U.S. democratic institutions around the elections,” according to an unclassified version of the assessment. 


It also warned that Tehran “has demonstrated a long-standing interest in exploiting U.S. political and societal tensions through various means, including social media.”


As an example, officials Tuesday pointed to newly declassified intelligence showing Iran trying to exploit pro-Gaza protests across the U.S.


"We have observed actors tied to Iran’s government posing as activists online, seeking to encourage protests, and even providing financial support to protesters," said National Intelligence Director Avril Haines.


Haines cautioned, though, that Americans who interacted with the Iranian actors “may not be aware that they are interacting with or receiving support from a foreign government."




Iranian officials have not yet responded to VOA’s request for comment.

## Biden: Ukraine to get 5 more air defense systems

date: 2024-07-10, from: VOA News USA

Pentagon — Ukraine is receiving five additional air defense systems to protect its sovereign territory, including three additional Patriot batteries from the United States, Germany and Romania.


U.S. President Joe Biden announced the five systems as NATO members commemorated the 75th anniversary of the alliance during a summit in Washington.


Allies marked the anniversary at Mellon Auditorium, the site of the original signing of the North Atlantic treaty that established the defensive bloc in 1949.


Topping the summit agenda is support for Ukraine’s battle against Russia’s illegal invasion.


The Netherlands and other partners are donating Patriot components to build a fourth Patriot battery, while Italy is donating an additional SAMP-T system, according to a joint statement Tuesday by the leaders of the United States, Germany, the Netherlands, Romania and Ukraine.


Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told NATO members in April that Ukraine needed a minimum of seven Patriot or other high-end air defense systems to counter Russian air strikes.


NATO allies say they are coordinating closely with Kyiv to make these systems available as soon as possible. They also said they are working to make another announcement about additional strategic air defense systems for Ukraine later this year.


“Not even our support for Ukraine has been a given,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Tuesday. “The reality is there are no cost-free options with an aggressive Russia as a neighbor. There are no risk-free options in a war, and remember, the biggest cost and the greatest risk will be if Russia wins in Ukraine.”


Since the U.S. Congress approved new aid for Ukraine following months of delays, the United States has provided Ukraine with hundreds of millions of dollars in equipment pulled from U.S. stockpiles, including the additional Patriot battery announced Tuesday and multiple rounds of long-range missiles known as ATACMS, two U.S. officials told VOA.


The ATACMS have a range of up to 300 kilometers (about 185 miles) and nearly double the striking distance of Ukraine’s missiles.


In addition, the U.S. has provided billions of dollars of funding for Kyiv’s long-term defense needs, including last week’s $2.2 billion Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative package that is being used to purchase interceptors for NASAMS (medium-range ground-based air defense system) and Patriot air defense systems for Ukraine.

## PGroonga 3.2.1 - Multilingual fast full text search

date: 2024-07-10, from: PostgreSQL News

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>PGroonga 3.2.1 has been released!</p>
<p>This release adds support for WAL resource manager!</p>
<p>With the WAL resource manager support, you can solve the
following problems with the general WAL approach in PGroonga &lt; 3.2.1:</p>
<ul>
<li>You need to remove old WAL manually to avoid unlimited storage usage</li>
<li>You need to use additional mechanism to apply WAL in background</li>
<li>You need to recover from a crash after PostgreSQL started</li>
</ul>
<p>See also the following document how to use this feature:
<a href="https://pgroonga.github.io/reference/streaming-replication-wal-resource-manager.html">Streaming replication by WAL resource manager</a></p>
<p>Note that you need PostgreSQL 15 or later because this is based on
custom WAL resource manager feature that is available since PostgreSQL 15. </p>
<p>If you're interesting in how to implement the WAL resource manager,
see also the following blog post:</p>
<p>Japanese:
<a href="https://www.clear-code.com/blog/2024/7/5/pgroonga-custom-wal-resource-manager.html">How to implement the PGroonga's WAL resource manager</a></p>
<p>English:
<a href="https://www-clear--code-com.translate.goog/blog/2024/7/5/pgroonga-custom-wal-resource-manager.html?_x_tr_sl=ja&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=ja&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp">Google Translate of the post</a></p>
<h3>About PGroonga</h3>
<p><a href="https://pgroonga.github.io/">PGroonga</a> is a PostgreSQL extension that
makes PostgreSQL fast full text search platform for all languages!
It's released under PostgreSQL license.</p>
<p>There are some PostgreSQL extensions that improves full text search feature
of PostgreSQL such as pg_trgm<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/pgtrgm.html">^1</a>.</p>
<p>pg_trgm doesn't support languages that use non-alphanumerics characters such
as Japanese and Chinese.</p>
<p>PGroonga supports all languages, provides rich full text search related
features and is very fast. Because PGroonga uses Groonga<a href="https://groonga.org/">^2</a> that is a
full-fledged full text search engine as backend.</p>
<p>See the following benchmark results for performance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Benchmark result for PGroonga, textsearch and pg_trgm with English Wikipedia
    https://pgroonga.github.io/reference/pgroonga-versus-textsearch-and-pg-trgm.html</li>
<li>Benchmark result for PGroonga and pg_bigm with Japanese Wikipedia
    https://pgroonga.github.io/reference/pgroonga-versus-pg-bigm.html</li>
</ul>
<p>PGroonga also supports JSON search. You can use each value
for condition. You can also perform full text search against
all texts in JSON like textsearch in PostgreSQL.</p>
<h3>Changes</h3>
<p>Here are highlights in PGroonga 3.2.1:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added support for WAL resource manager</li>
<li>Added support for downgrading by using <code>ALTER EXTENSION ... UPDATE</code></li>
<li>Added support for Ubuntu 24.04 (Noble Numbat)</li>
<li>Added support for typo-tolerance search</li>
<li>Fixed some crash bugs</li>
</ul>
<p>See also <a href="https://pgroonga.github.io/news/#version-3-2-1">the 3.2.1 release note</a>
for full changes.</p>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>You can use PGroonga without full text search knowledge. You
just create an index and puts a condition into WHERE:</p>
<pre><code>CREATE INDEX index_name ON table USING pgroonga (column);
SELECT * FROM table WHERE column &amp;@~ 'PostgreSQL';
</code></pre>
<p>You can also use LIKE to use PGroonga. PGroonga provides a
feature that performs LIKE with index. LIKE with PGroonga
index is faster than LIKE without index. It means that you
can improve performance without changing your application
that uses the following SQL:</p>
<pre><code>SELECT * FROM table WHERE column LIKE '%PostgreSQL%';
</code></pre>
<p>Are you interested in PGroonga? Please install<a href="https://pgroonga.github.io/install/">^4</a> and try
tutorial<a href="https://pgroonga.github.io/tutorial/">^5</a>. You can know all PGroonga features.</p>
<p>You can install PGroonga easily. Because PGroonga provides
packages for major platforms. There are binaries for
Windows.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

## Purdue Pharma secures litigation freeze after US Supreme Court ruling

date: 2024-07-09, from: VOA News USA

New York — Purdue Pharma on Tuesday received U.S. court approval for a 60-day freeze on lawsuits against its owners — members of the wealthy Sackler family — in its first court appearance since a landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling upended its bankruptcy settlement.  


U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane granted an injunction at a court hearing in White Plains, New York, saying that a litigation cease-fire will give Purdue a chance to renegotiate a comprehensive settlement of lawsuits alleging that its painkiller OxyContin spurred an opioid addiction crisis in the U.S.  


The U.S. Supreme Court ruled on June 27 that Purdue Pharma's bankruptcy settlement cannot shield the Sacklers, who did not file for bankruptcy themselves, over their role in the nation's deadly opioid epidemic. 


The ruling sent Purdue back to the drawing board after nearly five years in bankruptcy and imperils billions of dollars in funding that the company and the Sacklers had promised to pay toward addressing the harms from the crisis. 


Lawsuits against Purdue and Sackler family members by state and local governments, as well as by individual plaintiffs, have accused them of fueling the opioid crisis through deceptive marketing of its pain medication. The company pleaded guilty to misbranding and fraud charges related to its marketing of OxyContin in 2007 and 2020.  


Purdue's bankruptcy has stopped the opioid lawsuits from proceeding against the Stamford, Connecticut-based drugmaker since 2019, and Purdue has extended that legal protection to the Sacklers, as well. 


Purdue's attorney, Marshall Huebner, said the company will engage in "a high-speed, high-stakes mediation" with the Sacklers, state and local governments and other stakeholders. Protecting the Sacklers during a "modest" 60-day negotiating period will give Purdue a real chance to negotiate a new bankruptcy settlement and put money toward stopping opioid overdoses and treating addiction, Huebner said. 


"Every single day of delay continues to come at a tragic, tragic cost," Huebner said. 


Several stakeholders expressed hope for a settlement but said mediation should not be extended beyond the 60-day schedule proposed by Purdue. 


"It is essential to all parties in this case that we bring this five-year Chapter 11 case to a conclusion," said Kenneth Eckstein, an attorney representing a coalition of state and local governments.  


During the hearing, Lane also appointed two mediators to aid settlement talks, including retired bankruptcy judge Shelley Chapman, who brokered a previous deal under which the Sacklers agreed to pay up to $6 billion to settle the opioid lawsuits. Eric Green will serve as the other mediator.  


If mediation fails, Purdue has said a court-appointed committee representing its creditors should be allowed to sue the Sacklers over claims they drained more thabn $11 billion from the company and that their conduct made Purdue liable for other lawsuits. 


The Sacklers have said the creditors' proposed litigation is counterproductive and based on "factual errors." Members of the family have denied wrongdoing and would fiercely oppose any litigation if the settlement talks break down, their attorneys said.  


"No one is assured of a recovery in this court or any other court," said Gerard Uzzi, an attorney representing members of the Sackler family.  


Purdue's previous bankruptcy settlement was supported by attorneys general from all 50 states, local governments and most of the individual opioid victims who voted on it.  


But it has also had detractors such as Carrie McGaha, who has had repeated overdoses and said Tuesday that individuals have been placed at the "bottom of the heap" throughout Purdue's bankruptcy.

## US accuses Iran of seeking to exploit American Gaza protests

date: 2024-07-09, from: VOA News USA

washington — The U.S. intelligence chief on Tuesday accused Iran of egging on protests inside the United States against the Gaza war, including by paying demonstrators.


Avril Haines, the director of national intelligence, stressed she was not alleging that Americans taking to the streets against Israel or U.S. policy were insincere or doing Iran's bidding, but said Tehran was stepping up efforts.


"In recent weeks, Iranian government actors have sought to opportunistically take advantage of ongoing protests regarding the war in Gaza, using a playbook we've seen other actors use over the years," Haines said in a statement.


"We have observed actors tied to Iran's government posing as activists online, seeking to encourage protests and even providing financial support to protesters," she said.


"The freedom to express diverse views, when done peacefully, is essential to our democracy, but it is also important to warn of foreign actors who seek to exploit our debate for their own purposes," she said.


Iran's clerical state supports Palestinian militants Hamas, whose massive attack on Israel on October 7 has triggered a relentless Israeli offensive on the Gaza Strip.


Iranian state-backed media seized on pro-Palestinian protests that swept U.S. campuses and accused the United States of hypocrisy in the crackdowns on some of the demonstrations.


Iran, an arch-nemesis of the United States since the 1979 Islamic revolution toppled the pro-Western shah, has faced frequent charges of trying to target dissident voices in the West.


The United States has repeatedly condemned what it calls disinformation campaigns by China and especially Russia, including through deceptive social media posts.

## Google extends Linux kernel support to keep Android devices secure for longer

date: 2024-07-09, from: OS News

Android, like many other operating systems, uses the open-source Linux kernel. There are several different types of Linux kernel releases, but the type that’s most important to Android is the long-term support (LTS) one, as they’re updated regularly with important bug fixes and security patches. Starting in 2017, the support lifetime of LTS releases of Linux was extended from two years to six years, but early last year, this extension was reversed. Fortunately, Google has announced that moving forward, they’ll support their own LTS kernel releases for four years. Here’s why that’s important for the security of Android devices. ↫ Mishaal Rahman at Android Authority I fully support the Linux kernel maintainers dropping the LTS window from six to two years. The only places where such old kernels were being used were embedded devices and things like smartphones vendors refused to update to newer Android releases, and it makes no sense for kernel maintainers to be worrying about that sort of stuff. If an OEM wants to keep using such outdated kernels, the burden should be on that OEM to support that kernel, or to update affected devices to a newer, supported kernel. It seems Google, probably wisely, realised that most OEMs weren&#8217;t going to properly upgrade their devices and the kernels that run on them, and as such, the search giant decided to simply create their own LTS releases instead, which will be supported for four years. Google already maintains various Android-specific Linux kernel branches anyway, so it fits right into their existing development model for the Android Linux kernel. Some of the more popular OEMs, like Google itself or Samsung, have promised longer support life cycles for new Android versions on their devices, so even with this new Android-specific LTS policy, there&#8217;s still going to be cases where an OEM will have to perform a kernel upgrade where they didn&#8217;t have to before with the six year LTS policy. I wonder if this is going to impact any support promises made in recent years.

## US voters say they will consider economy when choosing between Biden and Trump

date: 2024-07-09, from: VOA News USA

new orleans, louisiana — "The economy controls everything," said South Carolina sales executive Chris Stinson. "Hands down it's what I'm most concerned about, and that's what I'll be thinking about when I vote this November." 


Stinson isn't alone. 


American voters are prioritizing the health of their wallets and pocketbooks with less than four months to go before Election Day. 


A CNN poll last week showed that 36% of respondents said the economy is the most important issue in deciding how to vote. "Protecting democracy" ranked second. 


"Who do I trust with the economy?" Stinson wondered aloud. "I'm undecided. Democrats seem proud to be anti-business, and pro-regulation, but [presumptive Republican nominee and former president Donald] Trump got us started down this path of devastating inflation when he introduced all that COVID stimulus." 


"What I know is all of these other issues Democrats like to talk about —things like hurting white men like me by adding regulations wherever they can — people don't care about the health of the oceans or which gender uses which bathroom when they're unemployed and can't find a job," Stinson told VOA. 


That economic anxiety comes despite cooling inflation, a scorching-hot stock market, and a better-than-expected monthly jobs report showing American employers added 206,000 jobs in June. 


Yet persisting economic concerns seem likely to impact this year's presidential election. In a June survey by PBS News/NPR/Marist, 54% of registered voters polled said they believed Trump would best handle the economy, not President Joe Biden (45%). 


Alabama Democratic voter Collins Pettaway said the economy "will play a major role in this election, as it so often does, and I have the utmost confidence President Biden will continue to manage the economy effectively, just like he did leading us out of the unprecedented pandemic and wrecked economy he inherited in his first term."  "   


An anxious nation 


A Pew Research Center poll from mid-May showed that only 23% of U.S. adults believe the economy is in excellent or good shape, down from 28% at the beginning of the year.  


That change is mostly the result of Democratic voters, whose collective opinion has slipped to 37% — down seven percentage points since January. 


"It's impossible to deny the effects of inflation," Carl Fink, a Democratic voter and father of three in New Orleans, Louisiana, told VOA. "Groceries, car insurance, entertainment — they're all so much more expensive these days. But none of that compares to how much the cost of child care and a good school has increased in the four years since our first child was born. It's so much tougher now." 


Just last week, the Federal Reserve reported to Congress that "inflation eased notably last year and has shown modest further progress so far this year." The Fed says it's just a matter of time before the pace of price increases settles back to where it was before the COVID-19 crisis. 




But for many Americans who have suffered the fastest price increases since the early 1980s, talk of slowing inflation doesn't improve their current financial situation. 


"The economy is the key factor in this election because citizens like me can no longer afford what was once considered the basics of living in America," said George Barisich, a fisherman and Republican voter from Chalmette, Louisiana. 


"Every supply house, fuel dock, icehouse, mechanic," he continued, "everything related to the fishing industry, and every other industry — they're all going out of business. Diesel and gas prices have skyrocketed. I can't make any money." 


"At least Trump is a businessman," Barisich said. "I think he'll be able to help us out." 


Looking through partisan glasses


In a period of increased partisanship, Cleveland State University associate professor of political science David Stack said voters cherry-pick economic indicators that best align with their political sentiments rather than with overall economic health. 


"If you're a Democrat, you point to the lowered unemployment rate and the rising stock market and you say, 'Look at how Biden fixed Trump's mess. He should be president,'" Stack told VOA. "But if you're a Republican, you point to the rate of inflation and say, 'See how Biden is screwing up the economy? Trump did better, so Trump should be president.'" 


Stack said most Republicans believe the high unemployment rate at the end of Trump's term was the result of the pandemic lockdown, whereas Democrats believe the stimulus package during COVID-19 resulted in a predictable spike in inflation.


What it means for November 


Shane Finkelstein, a Democratic voter from New Orleans who lost his business during the pandemic and has now found work after two years of unemployment, said he is pleased with Biden on the economy. 

 

"It's one of the most important issues we face, and I think it's also where Biden has done his strongest job," Finkelstein said. "Inflation is a big problem, but it's also usually the reflection of a strong economy. The reason it has been more intense this time is because of supply and demand issues during and post COVID." 


Maryland voter Nick Merson said he hopes other issues — such as gun control and access to abortion — will power Biden to a second term, even if the economy cannot. 


"I think in any other election, current views around inflation and the economy would result in an easy win for Republicans," Merson told VOA. "But Republicans also have the most toxic candidate in history. 


"We don't have a great one, either, but this election matters too much to sit out."

## Mozilla opts to extended Windows 7/8/8.1 support

date: 2024-07-09, from: OS News

Among them, Byron Jourdan, Senior Director, Product Management of Mozilla, under the Reddit username ComprehensiveDoor643 revealed that Mozilla plans to support Firefox on Windows 7 for longer. When asked separately about whether it also included Windows 8 and 8.1 too, Jourdan added that it was certainly the plan, though for how long the extended support would last was still undecided. ↫ Sayan Sen at Neowin Excellent move by Mozilla. I doubt there&#8217;s that many new features and frameworks in Windows 10 or 11 that are absolutely essential to Firefox working properly, so assuming it can gracefully disable any possible Windows 10/11-exclusive features, it should be entirely possible to use Firefox as an up-to-date, secure, and capable browser on Windows 7/8.x. Windows 7 and 8.x users still make up about 2.7% of Windows users worldwide, and with Windows&#8217; popularity, that probably still translates to millions and millions of people. Making sure these people have access to a safe and secure browser is a huge boon, and I&#8217;m very happy Mozilla is going to keep supporting these platforms as best they can, at least for now. For those of us who already consider especially Windows 7 a retrocomputing platform &#8211; I sure do &#8211; this is also great news, as any retro box or VM we load up with it will also get a modern browser. Just excellent news all around.

## No more boot loader: please use the kernel instead

date: 2024-07-09, from: OS News

Most people are familiar with GRUB, a powerful, flexible, fully-featured bootloader that is used on multiple architectures (x86_64, aarch64, ppc64le OpenFirmware). Although GRUB is quite versatile and capable, its features create complexity that is difficult to maintain, and that both duplicate and lag behind the Linux kernel while also creating numerous security holes. On the other hand, the Linux kernel, which has a large developer base, benefits from fast feature development, quick responses to vulnerabilities and greater overall scrutiny. We (Red Hat boot loader engineering) will present our solution to this problem, which is to use the Linux kernel as its own bootloader. Loaded by the EFI stub on UEFI, and packed into a unified kernel image (UKI), the kernel, initramfs, and kernel command line, contain everything they need to reach the final boot target. All necessary drivers, filesystem support, and networking are already built in and code duplication is avoided. ↫ Marta Lewandowska I&#8217;m not a fan of GRUB. It&#8217;s too much of a single point of failure, and since I&#8217;m not going to be dual-booting anything anyway I&#8217;d much rather use something that isn&#8217;t as complex as GRUB. Systemd-boot is an option, but switching over from GRUB to systemd-boot, while possible on my distribution of choice, Fedora, is not officially supported and there&#8217;s no guarantee it will keep working from one release to the next. The proposed solution here seems like another option, and it may even be a better option &#8211; I&#8217;ll leave that to the experts to discuss. It seems like to me that the ideal we should be striving for is to have booting the operating system become the sole responsibility of the EUFI firmware, which usually already contains the ability to load any operating system that supports UEFI without explicitly installing a bootloader. It&#8217;d be great if you could set your UEFI firmware to just always load its boot menu, instead of hiding it behind a function key or whatever. We made UEFI more capable to address the various problems and limitations inherent in BIOS. Why are we still forcing UEFI to pretend it still has the same limitations?

## Former US Senator Inhofe, defense hawk and climate change skeptic, dies at 89

date: 2024-07-09, from: VOA News USA

OKLAHOMA CITY, oklahoma — Former Senator Jim Inhofe, a conservative known for his strong support of defense spending and his denial that human activity is responsible for the bulk of climate change, has died. He was 89. 


Inhofe, a powerful fixture in Oklahoma politics for more than six decades, died Tuesday morning after suffering a stroke during the July Fourth holiday, his family said in a statement. 


Inhofe, a Republican who underwent quadruple bypass heart surgery in 2013 before being elected to a fourth term, was elected to a fifth Senate term in 2020, before stepping down in early 2023. 


'The greatest hoax'


Inhofe frequently criticized the mainstream science that human activity contributed to changes in the Earth's climate, once calling it "the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people." 


In February 2015, with temperatures in the nation's capital below freezing, Inhofe brought a snowball on to the Senate floor. He tossed it before claiming that environmentalists focus attention on global warming as it kept getting cold. 


As Oklahoma's senior U.S. senator, Inhofe was a staunch supporter of the state's five military installations and a vocal fan of congressional earmarks. The Army veteran and licensed pilot, who would fly himself to and from Washington, secured the federal money to fund local road and bridge projects, and criticized House Republicans who wanted a one-year moratorium on such pet projects in 2010. 


"Defeating an earmark doesn't save a nickel," Inhofe told the Oklahoma City Chamber of Commerce that August. "It merely means that within the budget process, it goes right back to the bureaucracy." 


He was a strong backer of President Donald Trump, who praised him for his "incredible support of our #MAGA agenda" while endorsing the senator's 2020 reelection bid. During the Trump administration, Inhofe served as chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee following the death of Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona. 


Closer to home, Inhofe helped secure millions of dollars to clean up a former mining hub in northeast Oklahoma that spent decades on the Environmental Protection Agency's Superfund list. In a massive buyout program, the federal government purchased homes and businesses within the 104-square-kilometer region of Tar Creek, where children consistently tested for dangerous levels of lead in their blood. 


Republican U.S. Representative Frank Lucas, the senior member of the Oklahoma congressional delegation, called Inhofe a true public servant. 


"His long career in the United States House and Senate serves as a testament to his strong moral compass and innate desire to better his home state," Lucas said in a statement 


In 2021, Inhofe defied some in his party by voting to certify Democrat Joe Biden's victory in the presidential election, saying that to do otherwise would be a violation of his oath of office to support and defend the Constitution. He voted against convicting Trump at both of his impeachment trials. 


Worked in business, public service


Born James Mountain Inhofe on Nov. 17, 1934, in Des Moines, Iowa, Inhofe grew up in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and received a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of Tulsa in 1959. He served in the Army between 1956 and 1958 and was a businessman for three decades. 


He was elected to the state House in 1966 and two years later to the state Senate, where he remained during unsuccessful runs for governor in 1974 and for the U.S. House in 1976. He then won three terms as Tulsa mayor starting in 1978. 


Inhofe went on to win two terms in the U.S. House in the 1980s, before throwing his hat into a bitter U.S. Senate race when longtime Senator David Boren resigned in 1994 to become president of the University of Oklahoma. Inhofe beat then-U.S. Representive Dave McCurdy in a special election to serve the final two years of Boren's term and was reelected five times. 


Boren, a Democrat, said he and Inhofe worked together in a bipartisan manner when both were in the state Legislature. He later defeated Inhofe in a race for governor. 


"While we ran against each other for governor, we were opponents but never enemies and remained friends," Boren said in a statement. "I hope we can rebuild that spirit in American politics." 


Frequent flyer


Inhofe was a commercial-rated pilot and flight instructor with more than 50 years of flying experience. 


He made an emergency landing in Claremore in 1999, after his plane lost a propeller, an incident later blamed on an installation error. In 2006, his plane spun out of control upon landing in Tulsa; he and an aide escaped injury, though the plane was badly damaged. 


In 2010, Inhofe landed his small plane on a closed runway at a rural South Texas airport while flying himself and others to South Padre Island. Runway workers scrambled, and Inhofe agreed to complete a remedial training program rather than face possible legal action. 


He later sponsored legislation that expanded the rights of pilots when dealing with Federal Aviation Administration disciplinary proceedings. 


Inhofe is survived by his wife, Kay, three children and several grandchildren. A son, Dr. Perry Dyson Inhofe II, died in November 2013, at the age of 51, when the twin-engine aircraft he was flying crashed a few miles north of Tulsa International Airport.

The Gulf of Mexico is not just a frequent target and breeding ground for massive storms, it is also one of America’s — and the world’s — most important energy hubs. Texas and Louisiana contains giant oil and gas fields, and the region is home to about <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/gas-prices-summer-hurricanes" target="_self"><u>half of the United States’ refining capacity</u></a>.</p><p>At least so far, the oil and refining industry appears to have largely dodged Beryl’s worst effects. The storm made landfall in Matagorda, a coastal town between Galveston and Corpus Christi, both of which are major centers for the refinery industry. Only one refinery, the Phillips 66 facility in Sweeny, Texas, was in the storm’s cone, <a href="https://www.tacenergy.com/news-and-views/gasoline-and-diesel-contracts-are-exchanging-hands-about-5-lower-than-where" target="_blank"><u>according to TACenergy</u></a>, a petroleum products distributor. Phillips 66 did not respond to a request to comment, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/texas-energy-industry-braces-beryl-storm-gathers-strength-2024-07-08/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>but <em>Reuters</em> reported</u></a> that the Sweeny facility as well as its refinery in Lake Charles, Louisiana were powered and operating. Crude oil prices have seen next to no obvious volatility, rising to $83.88 a barrel on July 3 and since settling around $82.84.</p><p>Electricity consumers, however, were not so lucky<strong>. </strong>As many as <a href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/climate-environment/hurricane-beryl-to-make-landfall-in-texas-after-ripping-through-caribbean-19347758" target="_blank"><u>2.7 million Texans</u></a> <span style="background-color: initial;">lost power,</span> and some 2.3 million are currently experiencing outages according to <a href="https://poweroutage.us/" target="_blank">PowerOutage.us</a>. In Arkansas and Louisiana, about 35,000 electric customers are without power. ERCOT, the energy market for about 90% of Texas, described the current outages as “local in nature and not an ERCOT grid reliability issue,” indicating that the problem is with distribution and transmission, not <a href="https://x.com/ERCOT_ISO/status/1810300525088317828" target="_blank">supply and demand</a>.</p><p>The heavily industrialized Gulf Coast would seem to be a perfect spot to build out offshore wind infrastructure, but the regular hurricane-force winds in the region are <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/gulf-mexico-leases-offshore-wind" target="_self"><u>holding it back</u></a>. The Department of the Interior has successfully auctioned off <a href="https://www.boem.gov/renewable-energy/state-activities/gulf-mexico-activities" target="_blank">just one lease</a> for wind development off of Lake Charles, Louisiana near the Texas border. The next auction will include sites along the Texas coast closer to Houston and Bay City, Texas, and thus <a href="https://www.boem.gov/sites/default/files/documents/renewable-energy/state-activities/GOMWind2LeasaeOptionsandGOMW1Lease.pdf" target="_blank"><u>closer to where Beryl made landfall</u></a>.</p><p>Beryl is now a tropical depression, working its way <a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/refresh/graphics_at2+shtml/144916.shtml?rainqpf" target="_blank"><u>up the Great Plains and the Midwest</u></a>, bringing along with it heavy rains and strong winds. Power generators may be off the hook in Texas, but the situation there does not bode well for our ability to get electricity to households and businesses reliably in a world of <a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/is-extreme-weather-climate-change#hurricanes" target="_blank">stronger storms</a>. </p><p>“For a Category 1 hurricane to result in over a million customer outages in its immediate aftermath demonstrates that there is plenty of need for the resiliency hardening investments,” Wei Du, a consultant at PA Consulting Group and former Con Edison analyst, told me.</p>

## Climate Scored Some Quasi-Victories in Europe

date: 2024-07-09, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjU1ODc1OC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2MDM1MTMyN30.6wYy0HzBZpl4xU5RV-TkcvrDoJRHK200P00CKP0RT90/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p>While America has been distracted by its suddenly-very-real upcoming election, two other important political stories have been unfolding across the pond. The results of last week’s parliamentary votes in France and the United Kingdom have the power to sway global climate policy — and they might even contain lessons for the U.S. about the rise (or fall) of the far-right. </p>
<h3>What happened in France?</h3><p>In June, French President Emmanuel Macron called snap elections, and the far-right National Rally party led by Marine Le Pen was widely expected to achieve a majority in the country’s 577-seat National Assembly. Instead, the New Popular Front, a hastily-formed alliance between the hard left, Greens, and Socialists, came out on top in a runoff, followed by the centrist Ensemble (which includes Macron’s Renaissance party) and the National Rally in a distant third. Because no party won the 289 seats needed to gain control of the chamber, the left and center now have to form a coalition government, which means ideological compromise — something that’s distinctly un-French. “We're not the Germans, we're not the Spanish, we're not the Italians — we don't do coalitions,” one French political commentator <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/france-elections-latest-far-right-national-rally-hoping-to-win-majority-as-second-round-vote-sees-huge-rise-in-turnout-13173764" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>told</u></a> <em><em>Sky News</em></em>.</p>
<h3>What did the National Rally want for climate?</h3><p>Climate change wasn’t a big theme, but the National Rally’s proposals certainly had experts nervous. The party tapped into <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/bears-cars-angry-farmers-fuel-green-deal-backlash-eu-agenda-european-commission-ursula-von-der-leyen/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>simmering discontent</u></a> among some demographics — <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/france/20240223-angry-french-farmers-drive-their-tractors-into-paris-in-fresh-protests" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>farmers, in particular</u></a> — who feel unfairly burdened by new regulations in service of the European Union’s ambitious agenda, known as the <a href="https://climate.ec.europa.eu/eu-action/climate-strategies-targets/2030-climate-targets_en#:~:text=In%202023%2C%20the%20EU%20adopted,climate%2Dneutral%20continent%20by%202050." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Green Deal</u></a>, including a goal to cut the bloc’s net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050. If it had won, the party planned to dismantle France’s energy efficiency rules, roll back a 2035 ban on new gas-powered cars, block new wind farms, do away with low-emission zones, and transform electricity trade. France is already the EU’s third biggest emitter, and the EU as a whole is responsible for <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Greenhouse_gas_emission_statistics_-_carbon_footprints#:~:text=The%20EU's%20consumption%20(final%20demand,through%20imports%20into%20the%20EU." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>about 9%</u></a> of global CO2 emissions, although <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/09/eu-greenhouse-gas-emissions-transport/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>emissions have been falling</u></a>, especially in the energy sector.</p>
<h3>So is European climate policy safe? </h3><p>As the dust settles in France, the biggest danger to climate policy now is stalemate. The lackluster results for the far right are no doubt a relief to the climate conscious. “We have avoided a catastrophe,” Alain Fischer, president of the French Academy of Sciences in Paris, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02260-5" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>told</u></a> <em><em>Nature</em></em>. The winning NFP, for its part, backs the Green Deal’s emissions targets and wants France to become “the European leader in renewable energies” through offshore wind power and the development of hydroelectric power. It also calls for the “creation of an international court for climate and environmental justice.” But the next several months are likely to be chaotic as the parties tussle over what the government should look like, and there is no deadline for these decisions to be made. The leadership limbo could bring political paralysis at a time when the EU is just <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/frances-allies-relieved-by-le-pen-loss-wonder-whats-next-2024-07-08/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>getting its bearings</u></a> following bloc-wide parliamentary elections — which, by the way, saw the Greens lose seats in lots of places. In response, the non-profit Climate Group put out a <a href="https://www.theclimategroup.org/our-work/news/climate-group-responds-french-parliamentary-election-results" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>statement</u></a> calling for the French government to “commit to safeguarding the EU Green Deal and ensuring a sustainable future for the continent.” The good news is that a <a href="https://x.com/DaveKeating/status/1799489322028023839" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>large majority</u></a> of EU voters want to see more climate action. </p><h3>What about in the U.K.?</h3><p>The Labour Party won the general election in a landslide, bringing an end to 14 years of Conservative Party rule. During his tenure, former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/in-depth-qa-what-do-rishi-sunaks-u-turns-mean-for-uk-climate-policy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>watered down</u></a> key net-zero strategies, delayed a ban on new combustion engine vehicles, scrapped energy efficiency standards, and approved a large new oil field in the North Sea. His party also pulled <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jun/07/tories-pledge-to-reverse-ulez-expansion-and-limit-20mph-roads-in-wales" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>low-emission zones into the culture wars</u></a> in a desperate attempt to win over voters. None of this played to his advantage. <a href="https://www.desmog.com/2024/07/08/two-thirds-of-anti-net-zero-tories-wiped-out-in-uk-election/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>According to Desmog</u></a>, two-thirds of the Conservative members of Parliament who were anti-net zero lost their seats, including the former energy secretary. “With a clear mandate for climate action,” <a href="https://www.e3g.org/news/the-uk-is-back-in-the-race-to-net-zero/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>wrote</u></a> climate change think tank E3G, “all eyes are now on Labour to deliver.”</p>
<h3>What does Labour want to do on climate?</h3><p>New Prime Minister Keir Starmer has pledged to turn the U.K. into a “clean energy superpower” by doubling onshore wind, tripling solar power, and quadrupling offshore wind by 2030. He also plans to upgrade the grid to speed the rollout of clean energy projects, while at the same time denying new licenses for oil and gas exploration in the North Sea. He wants to establish a publicly owned clean energy firm and decarbonize the power sector by 2030. And he plans to reinstate the 2030 ban on new gas cars. The goals are lofty, and meeting them will “extensive change across every sector of the economy,” <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/interactive-labour-governments-in-tray-for-climate-change-energy-and-nature/#:~:text=Labour%20has%20pledged%20to%20introduce,vulnerable%20to%20foreign%20energy%20powers." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>wrote</u></a> Carbon Brief. But Labour seems to be wasting little time. Days after taking power, the new government scrapped a ban on onshore wind farms that had been in place since 2015 and which the new Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves called “absurd.” </p>
<h3>Can the U.K. be a global climate leader?</h3><p>The U.K. accounts for about <a href="https://www.iea.org/countries/united-kingdom" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>1% of global greenhouse gas emissions</u></a>. That might be paltry compared to, say, the U.S. (<a href="https://www.iea.org/countries/united-states" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>13.5%</u></a>) or China (<a href="https://www.iea.org/countries/china" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>32%</u></a>), but it has a chance now to use its global influence and proximity to Europe to keep the needle moving in the right direction. That goes especially if it is nudged by the Green party, which surprised everyone by quadrupling its number of seats in Parliament (albeit to just four). As <em><em>The New York Times</em></em> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/05/climate/labor-starmer-election-climate.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>noted</u></a>, Britain is where the industrial revolution began, so “the speed and scale of Britain’s energy transition is likely to be closely watched by other industrialized countries and emerging economies alike.”</p>
<h3>Are there lessons in either of these elections for the U.S.?</h3><p>What’s clear from both of these cases is that people really care about climate policy and are willing to vote with that in mind. That can swing either way, though, depending on the particular set of policies and how they affect the electorate. As extreme weather intensifies, however, it may become more difficult for far-right parties to minimize the significance of climate change. “We need to recognize that extreme weather is politicizing people against this climate denial,” <a href="https://www.outrageandoptimism.org/episodes/elections-roundup?hsLang=en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>said</u></a> Paul Dickinson, founder of CDP, an emissions disclosure platform, and co-host of the podcast <em><em>Outrage + Optimism</em></em>. “It is the Achilles heel of the extreme right that they’re opposed to the realities of extreme weather. That’s how I think if we’re organized and disciplined, we will defeat them.” </p>

## My technology coaching and consulting in 2024

date: 2024-07-09, from: Ben Werdmuller's blog


<div class="e-content entry-content">
<p>My availability has opened up for a handful of consulting engagements in addition to my regular work as Senior Director of Technology at <a href="https://propublica.org">ProPublica</a>.</p><p><a href="https://resume.werd.io">I’ve founded two startups</a> (both based on open-source technology communities that I also founded). I’ve been a CTO, led product, and invested in early-stage startup ventures. I’ve also taught venture and product design to teams that include startups, top-tier educational institutions, and local newsrooms. My products have been used by social movements and Fortune 500 companies. <strong>I would love to help you to move faster and make stronger technology decisions.</strong></p><p>Here are some ways I might be helpful to you:</p><h3>A Sounding Board</h3><p>I can be your technology and product sounding board for your products and how your product or engineering team is run. I offer regular check-ins, or I can be available on an ad hoc, as-needed basis.</p><p>I’ll help you solve problems and coach you through getting to enduring solutions and productive work cultures. In the process, you’ll avoid common pitfalls, take advantage of a new but experienced set of eyes on your problems, and have someone in your corner when you need.</p><h3>Accelerated Technology Product Sprints</h3><p>Do you need to quickly evaluate a product idea or a way to solve problems for a customer you’ve identified? Do you need to identify that customer or market?</p><p>I can lead you through a short design sprint, either remotely or in person. At the end of it, you’ll have a stronger idea of your user and customer, learned tools for quickly running experiments and making progress, and identified and evaluated the core hypotheses that your product rests upon.</p><p><strong>You’ll iterate and get to market faster, increase your product’s chance of success, and build practices in your team to help you move faster long after we’ve finished working together.</strong></p><h3>Technical Evaluation and Advice</h3><p>Are you wondering how a technology (perhaps AI or the fediverse) might be used in your business? Do you have an idea in mind that needs to be feasibility-tested?</p><p>I’ll learn about your product and business and report on how you can leverage available technology with the time, team, and resources you have.</p><p><strong>You’ll more quickly understand what you can build, what’s technically possible, and where the technology opportunities are for your existing business.</strong></p><h3>Deck Review</h3><p>Are you presenting a strategy to your board or managers? Are you a startup going out to raise money?</p><p>I can give you actionable feedback to help you build your deck and tell a more robust story that has a better chance of getting you to the outcome you’re looking for.</p><p><strong>You’ll tell a stronger story, make a deeper emotional impact on your audience, and learn how to tell compelling stories in the future.</strong></p><h3>Courses</h3><p>Any of the above can be provided as workshops for your larger course. They are available both in-person and remotely.</p><h3>Get in Touch</h3><p>If you’re interested in these — or if <a href="https://resume.werd.io">you think you could make use of my other skills and experiences</a> — please email me directly at <a href="mailto:ben@werd.io">ben@werd.io</a> to arrange an initial meeting. I’m excited to talk to you!</p></div>

## Federal Reserve's Powell says US making 'modest' progress on inflation

date: 2024-07-09, from: VOA News USA

Washington — The U.S. Federal Reserve is making "modest" progress in its inflation fight, the head of the U.S. central bank told lawmakers Tuesday, on the first of two days of testimony in Congress.


When prices surged in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Fed responded by hiking interest rates to a two-decade high as it attempts to cool down the U.S. economy and return inflation to its long-term target of two percent.


Inflation has eased significantly since it peaked in 2022, but progress stalled in the first quarter of this year, effectively putting the Fed's fight on pause.


The data in the second quarter has been more encouraging, prompting some cautious optimism from some policymakers in recent weeks.


Speaking in Washington on Tuesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers on the Senate Banking Committee that the most recent readings "have shown some modest further progress" since the first quarter of the year.


"More good data would strengthen our confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward two percent," he added, according to prepared remarks.


The Fed is widely expected to hold interest rates again when it meets to set interest rates later this month, but could begin cutting rates in September.


Futures traders have assigned a probability of more than 75% that the Fed will make its first rate cut by September.

## Saudi Aramco’s Big Bet on Combustion Engines

</p><h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2><h3>1. Oil giant invests big in internal combustion engines</h3><p>
	The world’s largest oil company, Saudi Aramco, recently invested €740 million (about $800 million) in taking a 10% stake in a company that makes internal combustion engines (ICEs), the <em>Financial Times</em> <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a3019ce4-be91-4dc8-83c5-489f18bf56cf?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--f0jV1ccwzhIdyK94g0r2nkCrShbhmpfL4Z9dIxiJLM_RrVM-kq5Y28SFnDyRpOwx49Yz_" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>, signalling that the oil giant believes these engines aren’t going anywhere anytime soon. The investment in Horse Powertrain is based on a calculation that “as the industry stops designing and developing its own combustion engines, it will start buying them from third parties,” the <em><em>FT</em></em> wrote. Aramco’s executive vice president, Yasser Mufti, told the paper he thinks ICEs will see “significant improvements” over the coming years that will make them more sustainable, but didn’t specify what those improvements might be. ICEs, of course, run on fossil fuels and spew greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Saudi Aramco last year bought lubricant brand Valvoline, which will supply all Horse engines with products. As the <em><em>FT</em></em> noted, “the venture’s success will depend on whether other carmakers are willing to put their trust in a company born out of their rivals.”

## Who Is Auditioning for Trump’s Cabinet?

date: 2024-07-09, from: Heatmap News

	If Donald Trump moves back to Washington, D.C., in January 2025, he won’t arrive alone. Though Trump’s first term was marked by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/it-went-off-the-rails-almost-immediately-how-trumps-messy-transition-led-to-a-chaotic-presidency/2017/04/03/170ec2e8-0a96-11e7-b77c-0047d15a24e0_story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a messy transition</u></a> and bouts of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/03/09/unique-incompetence-donald-trump-crisis/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>political incompetence</u></a>, Republican operatives have spent the past four years <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-climate-change-project-2025" target="_self"><u>putting together a plan</u></a> to hit the ground running if or when he returns — as well as a list of <a href="https://www.project2025.org/personnel/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>friendly names</u></a> for plum positions in the would-be Trump administration. Many additional Republicans have quietly (and, often, <em><em>not</em></em> so quietly) spent the past few years auditioning for these top roles, typically by signaling their willingness to continue <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/supreme-court-epa" target="_self"><u>dismantling the regulatory and administrative states</u></a>.
</p><p>
	While <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/russ-vought-schedule-f" target="_self"><u>nearly all positions</u></a> in a Trump cabinet have at least some ability to limit or eliminate climate progress, here are some names circulating for the most influential departments.
</p><h2>The Department of Energy</h2><p>
	The past is prologue when it comes to a future Trump administration, making <strong>Dan Brouillette</strong> an easy guess to head of the Department of Energy: His reappointment would mark a return to the post he left during the presidential transition in 2021.
</p><p>
	But Secretary of Energy is nothing if not a competitive position, and Brouillette isn’t treating it like he’s a shoo-in, either. Since 2023, he’s served as the president and CEO of the Edison Electric Institute, a trade association for electric utilities that has taken <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/why-eei-is-trying-to-kill-bidens-climate-rule/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a more tepid stance on climate policies</u></a> during his tenure. He’s also spent plenty of time going on TV and <a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/eenews/2024/01/25/eei-chief-brouillette-on-trump-climate-law-and-the-lng-fight-00137645" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>speaking</u></a> to the press against Biden’s (since overturned) <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6345650468112" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>pause</u></a> in approving new export facilities for liquified natural gas — an industry <a href="https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2021/07/15/sempra-hires-former-us-energy-secretary-under-trump/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>he has history with</u></a> but that falls well outside his purview EEI. The effect is more a performance for Trump than it is any sort of service for his organization’s members. Brouillette has also repeatedly <a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2024/01/republicans-unlikely-to-kill-the-ira-eei-ceo-brouillette-00137571" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>insisted</u></a> that the Trump administration won’t gut the Inflation Reduction Act, an oddly blasé attitude about legislation that has significantly <a href="https://rmi.org/what-happens-when-utilities-start-to-integrate-the-ira-into-planning/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>benefited</u></a> the utilities EEI represents.
</p><p>
<strong>Bernard McNamee, </strong>the author of the Department of Energy section of Project 2025, is another top choice for the DOE. One of the “<a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/eenews/1060100464" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>most overtly political</u></a>” people to ever be appointed to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, in the words of <em><em>E&E News</em></em>, McNamee has <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/mcnamee-im-not-anti-renewable/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>said</u></a> that fossil fuels are “key to our prosperity” and that the renewable push amounts to “tyranny.” His chapter of Project 2025 calls for — among other things — closing the renewable energy offices at the DOE, eliminating energy efficiency standards for appliances, and refocusing the three National Labs run by DOE on “national security issues.”
</p><p>
	If Trump doesn’t pick <strong>Doug Burgum</strong> for vice president, there is a strong chance there could be a home for him at the DOE instead. Many see the governor of North Dakota as a <a href="https://www.kfyrtv.com/2024/04/13/senator-daines-says-north-dakota-governor-doug-burgum-would-be-great-energy-secretary-under-trump-administration/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>frontrunner</u></a> for Energy Secretary, suspicions Burgum has reinforced by cozying up to Trump as a political surrogate, even <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/05/12/trump-attacks-biden-criminal-charges-new-jersey/73660138007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>warming up</u></a> crowds at the candidate’s political rallies. While Burgum “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/09/climate/burgum-energy-trump-oil.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>at times [could] seem environmentally conscious</u></a>” during his gubernatorial tenure, he’s recently shifted to more familiar Republican talking points on the oil and gas industry and reportedly helped connect Trump to would-be donors in the fossil fuel sectors, according to reporting by <em><em>The New York Times</em></em>. He has also informally advised the Trump campaign on energy policy.
</p><p>
	There might also be a high-ranking position in the DOE for Texas oil and fracking magnate <strong>Harold Hamm</strong>, who was <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2016/07/20/trump-considering-top-fracking-mogul-harold-hamm-as-energy-secretary-sources-tell-reuters.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reportedly</u></a> a finalist for the position back in 2016. Hamm, a conservative megadonor, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-31/oil-tycoon-hamm-cuts-trump-support-while-aiding-desantis-haley" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>briefly broke with Trump</u></a> during the Republican primary but has since returned to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/oil-executives-host-trump-fundraiser-houston-2024-05-21/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>fundraise for his campaign</u></a>. Trump prizes loyalty, however, which is why Secretary Hamm might be more of a longshot; Hamm may return to being an informal advisor for the administration instead.
</p><h2>The Department of the Interior</h2><p>
	South Dakota Governor <strong>Kristi Noem</strong> seems <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/south-dakota-gov-kristi-noem-indicated-hasnt-formally-vetted-trumps-ru-rcna158448" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>pretty solidly off the VP shortlist</u></a> after making national headlines for admitting in her memoir that she killed a puppy, but she may yet fill a role in the administration that is less in the public spotlight. Interior wouldn’t be so far-fetched: Noem played an active part in slashing environmental protections in her state — something that <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/trump-debate-best-environmental-numbers" target="_self"><u>ought to endear her to Trump</u></a> — and she worked closely with Trump’s Secretary of the Interior to explore returning controversial <a href="https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-signs-moa-south-dakota-explore-future-fireworks-display-mount-rushmore" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>firework shows to Mount Rushmore</u></a>. In South Dakota, Noem also <a href="https://apnews.com/general-news-1f9c54dd230724a2e9dc15b42bf4a3ab" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>rolled</u></a> the Department of Environment and Natural Resources into the Department of Agriculture and has been <a href="https://southdakotasearchlight.com/briefs/solar-for-all-but-not-south-dakota-state-one-of-six-not-applying-for-grants/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>actively hostile</u></a> to the build-out of renewable energy, going so far as to <a href="https://www.sdstandardnow.com/home/if-trump-doesnt-pick-noem-as-his-running-mate-her-poisonous-policies-could-land-her-in-his-cabinet" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>refuse to apply for IRA grant money</u></a> — an action that signals her uncompromising commitment to the party’s political message to anyone watching.
</p><p>
	If not Noem, it’s possible <strong>David Bernhardt</strong> could return to the position he held under the first Trump administration. He’s used his time out of national politics to promote <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2024/04/09/david-bernhardt-biden-is-pandering-to-the-swamp-of-career-bureaucrats/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>better swamp management</u></a> (that’s the metaphorical swamp, not literal swamps, such as the critical <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/07/climate/trump-beaches-sand-protected-areas.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>beachfront-adjacent</u></a> wetlands he limited protections for while in office) and <a href="https://thefederalist.com/2023/05/09/trump-interior-secretary-the-monstrous-administrative-state-killing-self-government-must-be-stopped/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>to push Trump’s plan</u></a> to reinstate Schedule F — which will make it easier to fire employees that aren’t deemed loyal enough to the administration — declaring that his own agency had been “<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/ex-interior-secretary-takes-on-abortion-pills-agency-power-at-supreme-court/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>overwhelmingly liberal</u></a>” during his tenure. Bernhardt has adopted <a href="https://www.axios.com/pro/energy-policy/2023/05/09/bernhardts-bureaucracy-bomb" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>skepticism of career civil </u></a><u>servants</u> as something of a pet cause, publishing a 2023 book called <em><em>You Report to Me: Accountability for the Failing Administrative State</em></em> and <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/ex-interior-secretary-takes-on-abortion-pills-agency-power-at-supreme-court/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>filing an amicus brief to the Supreme Court</u></a> earlier this year that argued, “One would be naïve not to understand how policy drives the ‘science’ at an agency.”
</p><p>
	Those familiar with Bernhardt’s thinking, though, see the former secretary as angling for a more ambitious post in a future Trump administration, such as director of the Office of Management and Budget. An OMB appointment would potentially put Bernhardt on a collision course with <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/russ-vought-schedule-f" target="_self"><u>Russ Vought</u></a>, another Schedule F proponent, which means that if the former Interior secretary’s apparent angling for a new office doesn’t pan out, he may end up back in a more familiar role.
</p><p>
	Trump’s former ambassador to Portugal, <strong>George Glass</strong>, has also been floated in the Interior conversation. An Oregon businessman, Glass fits the bill as a Westerner — since 1949, just one Interior secretary has not been a resident or native of a state west of the Mississippi. He also sees eye-to-eye with Trump <a href="https://clubofmozambique.com/news/chinese-investment-in-portugal-is-of-concern-us-ambassador/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>as a China hawk</u></a>, and while he doesn’t have much of a climate record, he has been a steady donor whose loyalty could be rewarded again with a plum administrative position.
</p><h2>The Department of Agriculture</h2><p>
	While the Department of Agriculture doesn’t have the same levers to pull as Interior or Energy, the USDA nevertheless <a href="https://civileats.com/2020/11/02/how-four-years-of-trump-reshaped-food-and-farming/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>oversees</u></a> one of the most <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/sustainable-food-systems/articles/10.3389/fsufs.2020.518039/full" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>significant sources of planet-warming emissions</u></a> in the United States. While the Biden administration’s USDA has explicitly pursued an “equitable and climate-smart food and agriculture economy,” the Heritage Foundation instead wants the agency to “play a limited role” that doesn’t “hinder food production or otherwise undermine efforts to meet consumer demand.”
</p><p>
<strong>J. D. Vance</strong> has emerged as one candidate to get that job done. The <em><em>Hillbilly Elegy</em></em> author-turned-Ohio-senator previously invested in an <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-technology-us-securities-and-exchange-commission-ohio-government-politics-861dd10deeb4cdecd335abe3ad4fe775" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>agriculture startup</u></a> and has taken a particular interest in <a href="https://spectrumnews1.com/oh/columbus/news/2024/03/14/ohio-farm-bill" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the farm bill</u></a>, while at the same time boasts a <a href="https://scorecard.lcv.org/moc/jd-vance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>0% lifetime score</u></a> from the League of Conservation Voters. Vance’s name has also been <a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-2024-trump-vice-president-vance-ohio-33c2179a5ace72c742bbb3823298538b" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>in the hat for VP</u></a>, and he’s certainly <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/jd-vance-vice-president-trump-5157007c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>done his best</u></a> to remain in Trump’s good graces, which could land him a secretary post if he doesn’t ultimately make the cut as a running mate.
</p><p>
	There might be a better case, though, that this department ends up in the hands of <strong>Sid Miller</strong>. Currently serving as the Texas Agriculture Commissioner, Miller was <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/11/trump-eyes-top-texas-maga-disciple-for-usda-chief-00151797" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reportedly</u></a> on the shortlist for the position back in 2016. He has blamed weather-related power outages in his state on renewable intermittency, at one time <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MillerForTexas/posts/we-should-never-build-another-wind-turbine-in-texas-the-experiment-failed-big-ti/3103832863172197/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>writing</u></a>, “to heck with green energy or climate change.” Miller is something of a <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2016/11/01/miller-calls-clinton-obscene-term-twitter/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>firebrand</u></a>, however, alienating even some within his own party, and he could struggle to garner the bipartisan support that will likely be necessary to win confirmation.
</p><h2>The Environmental Protection Agency</h2><p>
	Though Trump initially avoided answering a question about the climate during the first presidential debate, he had <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/biden-trump-debate-climate-change" target="_self"><u>talking points ready</u></a> thanks to <strong>Andrew Wheeler</strong>, his former head of the Environmental Protection Agency. Trump seemingly <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/27/politics/read-biden-trump-debate-rush-transcript/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>referred</u></a> to Wheeler as one of “my top environmental people,” suggesting that in addition to being an informal adviser to the campaign, Wheeler and his work at the EPA remain in high regard with Trump himself. While in the previous administration, Wheeler notably <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/11/andrew-wheeler-epa-climate-change-bye.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>helped to roll back</u></a> over 100 clean air, water, and environmental regulations.
</p><p>
	Wheeler himself <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/holland-hart-welcomes-former-epa-head-andrew-wheeler-in-dc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has been cagey</u></a> about whether he’s auditioning for another Trump position, though — this spring, he joined the Holland & Hart law firm as a partner focused on federal affairs. If Wheeler decides to stay in the private sector, Trump might turn instead to <strong>Mandy Gunasekara</strong>, one of the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2020/02/14/she-pushed-trump-exit-paris-climate-agreement-rollback-environmental-rules-shes-returning-epa-chief-staff/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>primary architects</u></a> of the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on climate change and the author of the especially concerning Project 2025 chapter on the EPA.
</p><p>
	Gunasekara has bolstered the case for herself by describing how she would curtail the EPA’s powers, eliminate its enforcement office, and “update the 2009 endangerment finding” that greenhouse gases <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2016-08/documents/endangermentfinding_legalbasis.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>are a threat</u></a> to public health and the environment — science that has been used as the backbone for the EPA’s climate change regulations for years. Gunasekara has also <a href="https://www.npr.org/transcripts/1192634090" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>said</u></a> that while she believes in human-caused climate change, planetary warming is “overstated” and <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/the-5-quotes-you-need-to-know-from-the-ipcc-report" target="_self"><u>erroneously</u></a> claimed that scientific data shows “a mild and manageable climate change in the future.” That rhetoric puts her right <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-fact-check-intro" target="_self"><u>in sync</u></a> with her potential future boss.

## Some more thoughts on TBC

date: 2024-07-09, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>I know, I know. You’re tired of hearing me ranting about The Browser Company and their Arc “browser”. I’m also tired of reading about them but I keep stumbling on news about this silly company and I can’t help myself from yelling at the screen. They aired a commercial on TV the other day, clearly a reasonable thing to do when you have a product with no revenues and no business model. And not happy with that, they released a YouTube video with the CEO explaining the ideas “hidden” in the commercial and that tells you how good at marketing these people are. If you need to release an almost 5-minute video to explain the meaning of a stupid 1-minute ad you probably need a better marketing department.</p>
<p>Anyway, leaving aside the pointlessness of this whole thing what prompted me to write this post were some of the things the CEO said in the video explainer which are so profoundly stupid that I find them offensive. If you are an ARC user you should be offended too because he must think you’re all a bunch of idiots.</p>
<p>He said in the video that there were three questions he wanted to ask:</p>
<ol>
<li>What is this internet we want to live within?</li>
<li>What if the web were truly made for you?</li>
<li>What are we here for?</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>What is this internet we want to live within? What do we want to create for ourselves?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just to make it clear, what this company is allegedly making is a browser. It’s in their fucking name: The Browser Company. They’re not making a new internet. They’re not creating anything. As I wrote before, they’re not even making an actual browser like the awesome people at <a href="https://ladybird.org">Ladybird</a>. They’re building a wrapper around Chrome. This makes the CEO rant about browser monoculture even more hilarious since by doing that they're part of the problem.</p>
<p>In the video, he tries to argue that Silicon Valley companies are driven by efficiency, you type something in Google and he gives you an answer but there are times when you don’t want an answer, you want to get access to the best set of results because you’re after experiences and serendipity and a bunch of other complete nonsense. He asked, “Do we even believe in a single answer?“. The answer is no Josh. No, we don’t. This is why all search engines have a SERP. No search engine gives you one answer. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>A lot of other times something just seems really interesting to you and you want to go wide and deep and be surprised there are a lot of other things we might want to optimise for when we’re designing this new internet</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Designing this new internet? You’re not designing a new internet. You’re using some algorithm to decide for me which 6 or 8 results I should be seeing. In doing that you’re worse than Google. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The second thing is what would it look like if truly the web was made for you?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m gonna ask you a question Josh: how can you make a web for me without profiling me? I’ll wait for an answer the same way I’m still waiting to hear back from your support team on that ticket I opened months ago where I was asking how to prevent your stupid ARC Search from accessing my sites.</p>
<p>You asked “What does the personal web, the personal internet look like” and there are various ways to tackle this question but it certainly doesn’t look like a generated ARC Search result page that is the same for everyone. You said the web doesn’t feel personal because we all see the same stuff and yet you showed a screenshot of your stupid ARC Search pulling in results from Reddit and Trip Advisor. Again, if you’re reading this and you’re an ARC user, they must think you’re a complete idiot to believe all this stuff.</p>
<p>As for the final question, what are we here for and why am I looking at this video, well Josh, I work in tech. I code websites, I care about the web. Especially the independent, personal one. The one you’re ranting about but probably don’t care about at all. I also have to care about your stupid browser because even though it’s Chrome sometimes it has bugs that aren’t present on Chrome and so I have to test on it. I’d love to not care about your browser and your stupid ARC Search but I have to because this is the world I live in. My email is public if you want to get in touch. You probably won’t because why would you, you have nothing to gain from a private exchange after all.</p>                <hr>
                <p>Thank you for keeping RSS alive. You're awesome.</p>

## American mountaineer found mummified in Peru 22 years after vanishing

date: 2024-07-09, from: VOA News USA

LIMA, Peru — The preserved body of an American mountaineer — who disappeared 22 years ago while scaling a snowy peak in Peru — has been found after being exposed by climate change-induced ice melt, police said Monday.


William Stampfl was reported missing in June 2002, aged 59, when an avalanche buried his climbing party on the mountain Huascaran, which stands more than 6,700 meters (22,000 feet) high. Search and rescue efforts were fruitless.


Peruvian police said his remains were finally exposed by ice melt on the Cordillera Blanca range of the Andes.


Stampfl's body, as well as his clothes, harness and boots had been well-preserved by the cold, according to images distributed by the police.


His passport was found among his possessions in good condition, allowing police to identify the body.


The mountains of northeastern Peru, home to snowy peaks such as Huascaran and Cashan, are a favorite with mountaineers from around the world.


In May, the body of an Israeli hiker was found there nearly a month after he disappeared.


And last month, an experienced Italian mountaineer was found dead after he fell while trying to scale another Andean peak.

## Searing heat grips parts of US, causes deaths in the West

date: 2024-07-09, from: VOA News USA

death valley, california — A searing heat wave gripped large parts of the United States on Monday, with record daily high temperatures in Oregon suspected to have caused four deaths in the Portland area following a motorcyclist's death in dangerous heat over the weekend in Death Valley, California.


More than 146 million people around the U.S. were under heat alerts Monday, especially in the Western states. California, Nevada, Arizona, Oregon, Washington and Idaho on Monday were under an excessive heat warning, the National Weather Service’s highest alert, while parts of the East Coast as well as Alabama and Mississippi were under heat advisories.


The early U.S. heat wave came as the global temperature in June reached record warmth for the 13th straight month and marked the 12th straight month that the world was 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than pre-industrial times, the European climate service Copernicus said.


Dozens of locations in the West and Pacific Northwest tied or broke previous heat records over the weekend and are expected to keep doing so into the week.


In Oregon’s Multnomah County, home to Portland, the medical examiner is investigating four suspected heat-related deaths recorded Friday, Saturday and Sunday, officials said. Three of the deaths involved county residents who were 64, 75 and 84 years old, county officials said in an email. Heat also was suspected in the death of a 33-year-old man transported to a Portland hospital from outside the county.


Portland broke daily record temperatures Friday, Saturday and Sunday and was on track to do so again on Monday with a forecast high of 102 degrees Fahrenheit (38.9 Celsius), National Weather Service meteorologist Hannah Chandler-Cooley said. High temperatures were expected in Portland through Tuesday evening.


“We are looking at the potential for breaking more records,” she said.


The temperatures aren’t expected to reach as high as they did during a similar heat wave in the Pacific Northwest in 2021, which killed an estimated 600 people across Oregon, Washington and western Canada. But the duration could be problematic because many homes in the region lack air conditioning. Round-the-clock hot weather keeps people from cooling off sufficiently at night, and the issue is compounded in urban areas where concrete and pavement store heat.




Heat illness and injury are cumulative and can build over the course of a day or days, officials warn. In San Jose, California, a homeless man died last week from apparent heat-related causes, Mayor Matt Mahan reported on the social platform X, calling it “an avoidable tragedy.” San Jose police said the man's body had no obvious signs of foul play.


In eastern California's sizzling desert, a high temperature of 128 F (53.3 C) was recorded Saturday and Sunday at Death Valley National Park, where a visitor, who was not identified, died Saturday from heat exposure. Another person was hospitalized, officials said.


They were among six motorcyclists riding through the Badwater Basin area in scorching weather, the park said in a statement. The other four were treated at the scene. Emergency medical helicopters were unable to respond because the aircraft cannot generally fly safely over 120 F (48.8 C), officials said.


More extreme highs are in the near-term forecast, with a high of around 127 F (52.7 C) expected in Death Valley on Monday, and possibly 130 F (54.4 C) around midweek.


The largest national park outside Alaska, Death Valley is considered one of the most extreme environments in the world and is among the hottest during the summer. The hottest temperature ever officially recorded on Earth was 134 F (56.67 C) in July 1913 in Death Valley, though some experts dispute that measurement and say the real record was 130 F (54.4 C), recorded there in July 2021.


“While this is a very exciting time to experience potential world-record-setting temperatures in Death Valley, we encourage visitors to choose their activities carefully, avoiding prolonged periods of time outside an air-conditioned vehicle or building when temperatures are this high,” park Superintendent Mike Reynolds said.


Across the desert in Nevada, Las Vegas set a record high of 120 F (48.8 C) Sunday and was forecast to hit a record high of 115 F (46.1 C) Monday. The National Weather Service forecast a high of 117 F (47.2 C) in Phoenix.


People flocked Monday to the beaches around Lake Tahoe, especially Sand Harbor State Park, where the record high of 92 (33.3) set Sunday smashed the old record of 88 (31.1 ) set in 2014. For the fifth consecutive day, Sand Harbor closed its gates within 90 minutes of opening at 8 a.m. because it had reached capacity.


“It’s definitely hotter than we are used to,” Nevada State Parks spokesperson Tyler Kerver said.

## US not expecting policy change from Iran under new president

date: 2024-07-09, from: VOA News USA

washington  — The United States said Monday that it did not expect policy changes from Iran after voters elected reformist candidate Masoud Pezeshkian, and downplayed chances to resume dialogue.


"We have no expectation that this election will lead to a fundamental change in Iran's direction or its policies," State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters.


Miller said Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was expected to call the shots in Iran, an adversary of the United States since the 1979 Islamic revolution.


"Obviously, if the new president had the authority to make steps to curtail Iran's nuclear program, to stop funding terrorism, to stop destabilizing activities in the region, those would be steps that we would welcome," Miller said.


"But needless to say, we don't have any expectation that that's what's likely to ensue."


Asked if the United States was at least willing to reopen diplomacy with Iran after Pezeshkian's election, Miller said: "We have always said that diplomacy is the most effective way to achieve an effective, sustainable solution with regard to Iran's nuclear program."


But at the White House, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby, asked if the United States was ready to resume nuclear talks with Iran, said emphatically, "No."


"We'll see what this guy wants to get done, but we are not expecting any changes in Iranian behavior," Kirby said.


President Joe Biden took office in 2021 with hopes of returning to a 2015 nuclear deal with Iran that was negotiated under former President Barack Obama and ended by his successor, Donald Trump, who imposed sweeping sanctions on Iran.


But talks, negotiated through the European Union, broke down in part over a dispute about the extent to which the United States would remove sanctions on Iran.


Relations have deteriorated further since the October 7 attack on U.S. ally Israel by Hamas, which receives support from Iran.
