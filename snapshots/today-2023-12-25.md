<p>Jeremy Scahill summed it up well:</p><p>Remarkable how so many defenders of Israel’s mass killing operations in Gaza sound like a Hollywood depiction of a sociopath torturing someone. “We can make it all stop if Hamas puts down its weapons &amp; surrenders.” The “it” here being the annihilation of 1,000 children a week.</p>

## Newsboat 2.34 is out

date: 2023-12-25, updated: 2023-12-25, from: Newsboat News


            <p>
                Here‘s a little update to your favourite RSS/Atom reader,
                everyone :)
            </p>

            <p>
                There aren‘t many user-visible changes though; most of the
                effort was spent improving things internally. Dennis van der
                Schagt and bogdasar1985 continue to make progress on various
                fronts, which should eventually bring us a new key-bind system,
                help fix the long-standing issue with non-UTF-8 content in old
                cache.db files, and more.
            </p>

            <p>
                Docs also received some updates and polish. Lysander Trischler
                continues to play a vital role here, reviewing all the
                docs-related changes and helping authors improve them even
                further. Incidentally, I don‘t mention any of this work in the
                changelog; should I?
            </p>

            <p>
                Hope you‘ll find this new release at least as good as the
                previous one. We‘re already working on the next, better one :)
                Merry Christmas to those who celebrate today, and a happy New
                Year!
            </p>

            <p>
                Here are the files:

I made a change to how images are served from this blog, to see if the images are still blocked by GMail. Previously we redirected to an <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/images/2022/12/01/santa.png">S3 file</a>, so we could use HTTPS and but not have to have the bits flow through one of my Digital Ocean servers, which after this change, they now do.

## A pulse check on holiday travel and holiday hiring

date: 2023-12-25, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>The holiday travel season is likely to be a busy one, with more people expected to travel domestically this year than in 2022. Meanwhile, drivers can expect to pay the same (or even a bit less) for a gallon of gas. And there&#8217;s zero days left to wrap up Christmas shopping — so what better time to take stock of how hiring for the holiday season has shaped up?</p>

This period is often a time of innovation in the world of blogs, podcasting and feeds. For me this year, I'm using the time to do more work on CSS and basic user interface stuff for <a href="https://feedland.com/">FeedLand</a> and for news products like <a href="http://news.scripting.com/">news.scripting.com</a>, which has been surprisingly popular. The new stuff will start showing up first in that site, pretty soon. The goal is to build on its popularity, to bootstrap a new platform.

## Chinese Migration Up at Border as US Marks Anniversary of Repeal of Exclusion Act

date: 2023-12-25, from: VOA News USA

Washington   — As the U.S marks the 80th anniversary of the repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act, thousands of Chinese immigrants are crossing the U.S.-Mexico border, mostly for the same reasons as their countrymen did more than a century ago. 


Zhongwei Wang made that journey this spring through Central America with his family.


"When I knew there was a way to leave China, I felt overjoyed, really overjoyed," he said. 


According to the U.S. Border Patrol, from January through September, more than 24,000 Chinese migrants crossed the border without authorization, about 13 times the number recorded during the same period last year. 


"They see a lack of opportunity. They see the Chinese economy stagnating. There's also been a lot of frustration with how controlling the Chinese government is, how many restrictions there are on their lives, and people have been researching how to get to the United States," said Madeline Y. Hsu, a history professor at the University of Maryland. 




Hsu spoke at CRCEA80, the gathering on December 5 of nearly 400 representatives from 121 Chinese-American organizations who came together to mark the 80th anniversary of the repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act, the only U.S. law that prohibited immigration based solely on race. 


Wang's journey 


Wang arrived with his parents, his wife, and their two children in May. They left China's Anhui province, he told VOA's Mandarin Service, because of the Chinese government's aggressive COVID-19 lockdown and human rights issues.


The family flew from Hong Kong to Turkey to Quito, Ecuador, which offers a 90-day visa exemption for Chinese passports. 


From there, they walked through the Darien Gap, a dangerous path in the mountainous jungle between Colombia and Panama that tens of thousands of migrants used in 2022 on their way to the U.S. "We had to climb four hills on the first day," he said. 


His wife was carrying her 14-month-old son on her back. His mother, who was in poor health, couldn't walk after climbing the first hill, but a fellow migrant helped along the way.


Those without the means to obtain a visa sometimes choose this dangerous route. Wang said he originally planned to apply for a tourist visa to come to the United States, but at that time the waiting list for a tourist visa interview to the United States was more than six months.


While he said he objected to China's COVID-19 lockdown policies and human rights record, he had also protested against the Chinese government after he arrived in the U.S., which prompted local law enforcement to visit his uncle's home in China. 


"We must not stop [protesting the Chinese government] overseas, despite their threats to intimidate my family, my uncle, and the others. So, when we are overseas, we cannot keep a low profile. If we don't speak out when [our families] are threatened, they [the Chinese government] know this method is effective and they will threaten others again," he said.


Chinese Exclusion Act 


The Chinese Exclusion Act, which passed in 1882, was the only law in U.S. history that singled out a specific ethnic group. President Franklin D. Roosevelt officially ended the act on Dec. 17, 1943, and granted Chinese Americans equal citizenship rights for the first time. 


Renata Castro, a Florida-based immigration lawyer, says today's Chinese migrants, if they are unable to come to the U.S. with an existing visa, are finding other ways to flee the world's second-most populous nation, including showing up at the U.S.-Mexico border to seek asylum. 




"Mainly because these are individuals that are escaping the oppressions of the Chinese government. … But most importantly, they are fleeing the lack of economic expectations they have in China right now," she said.


When people come to the U.S. seeking protection because they have suffered persecution or are afraid that they will suffer persecution based on race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular group, they are permitted to file for asylum regardless of their immigration status.


But to apply for asylum, a person must be present in the U.S.  


Chinese migrants who cross into the U.S. without authorization usually wait for agents from U.S. Border Patrol to pick them up. Once the agents process these migrants, many are assigned court dates and released in cities close to their final destination, adding to an immigration court system that is taking about five years to decide cases. 


According to October data from Syracuse University's Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, Chinese migrants were granted asylum nearly 67% of the time in immigration courts over the past two decades — one of the highest rates by nationality. The reasons, per the Christian nonprofit ChinaAid, is the continuing decline in human rights conditions, higher accessibility to information on social media about crossing the U.S. Mexico border, and restrictions on religious freedom. 


Out of 108,273 Chinese migrant applications, 77,711 were granted asylum. Asylum was denied to 29,635 and 927 applications received another type of immigration relief.

## A Denver nugget against Trump?: The 14th Amendment may keep him off the Colorado ballot

				<p>There are many ways to deny demagogic, anti-democratic Donald John Trump a second presidential term, which is an American imperative. When Trump was running for a first term in 2016, this newspaper ran the longest editorial in its history urging his defeat. When he was running for reelection in 2020, we outlined 99 reasons he had to be beaten. Fortunately, that time he was, and soundly so. </p>

## Activists Emboldened to Seek Ouster of Ex-Iranian Officials From US Academia After Ex-Diplomat's Suspension

date: 2023-12-25, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Iranian-American activists seeking to oust former Iranian officials from U.S. academia to hold them accountable for the Islamic republic’s poor human rights record say a U.S. college that suspended one former official last month needs to do more. 


Alliance Against Islamic Regime of Iran Apologists (AAIRIA) also tells VOA that the suspension of Mohammad Jafar Mahallati at Ohio’s Oberlin College has emboldened the nonprofit group to target a second former Iranian official for removal from another U.S. higher education institution. 


Oberlin told U.S. media earlier this month that it put Mahallati on indefinite administrative leave on November 28. It provided no reason for the move. 


Mahallati served as Iran's ambassador to the U.N. from 1987-89. He then left the Iranian government for teaching and research roles at several U.S. and Canadian universities, including New York’s Columbia University in the 1990s, before joining Oberlin as a religion professor in 2007. 


AAIRIA activists, who include former political prisoners and relatives of executed dissidents in Iran and other human rights advocates, had campaigned for years for Oberlin to remove Mahallati. They accuse him of covering up Iran’s 1988 mass killings of jailed dissidents while he served as its envoy to the U.N. 


In an October 2020 statement to The Oberlin Review, a student-run weekly newspaper at the college, Mahallati said: "I categorically deny any knowledge and therefore responsibility regarding mass executions in Iran when I was serving at the United Nations.” He did not respond to a VOA email sent to his gmail address on December 15 seeking further comment for this report. 


AAIRIA member Lawdan Bazargan, whose brother was among those killed in the 1988 mass executions, discussed Mahallati’s case in the latest edition of VOA’s Flashpoint Iran podcast. She also elaborated on AAIRIA’s next demands of Oberlin and her group’s goal of securing the removal of former Iranian diplomat Seyed Hossein Mousavian as a scholar at New Jersey’s Princeton University. 




Oberlin responded to a VOA email about Bazargan’s interview by saying it has no comment. The Oberlin Review reported earlier this year that in 2021, the college hired an “unnamed third party” to investigate whether Mahallati covered up the 1988 mass killings. It said the college concluded based on the findings that there was “no evidence to corroborate” the accusation.


Mousavian served as Iran’s ambassador to Germany from 1990-97 and then in a series of other diplomatic and national security roles until leaving the government to join Princeton in 2009. He did not respond to a VOA email, sent Friday to his Princeton address, seeking reaction to Bazargan’s comments. 


In an article published last month, Princeton Alumni Weekly said Mousavian sent it an email saying: "All my books, articles, speeches, and interviews during 13 years working at Princeton University are about peace, security, stability, and opposing wars and warmongering.”


The following transcript of Bazargan’s December 14 interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.


VOA: What is your reaction to Mahallati’s denial that he covered up the 1988 mass killings in Iran when he served as Iranian ambassador to the U.N.?


Lawdan Bazargan, Alliance Against Islamic Regime of Iran Apologists: His position always had been that he did not know. So, we gathered more documents, sending them to [rights group] Amnesty International. 


Amnesty International in February 2023 issued its latest report that documented this atrocity. It previously reported [in 2018] that in the first three weeks of July 1988, the Iranian regime had killed members of [opposition group] Mujahedeen-e Khalq (MEK) and then paused for two weeks [before starting a second wave of killings in late August 1988]. 


Amnesty International’s latest report says the organization released its first alert about the atrocity during that pause [on August 16, 1988]. So Mahallati had 11 days to save at least the opposition leftists [from being killed]. Four thousand MEK members already had been killed. But 1,000 leftists, including my brother, could have been saved if he had spoken up, which he did not. 


VOA: You said that you want to see Oberlin College do more than just suspend Mahallati. What are the next steps that you would like to see?


Bazargan: We want to make sure that he does not receive a pension, that Oberlin College creates a memorial in the memory of our loved ones, and that a course is taught at the college about the Iranian regime and its atrocities in the same way that we teach about Nazism and what Stalin did in Russia. We have to teach that the reason behind all the atrocities and wars in the Middle East is actually the Islamic republic of Iran, and they have to be punished for what they did. 


VOA: What is your expectation about whether the college will do these things?


Bazargan: For the past three and a half years, people have been telling us it is impossible [to remove Mahallati from Oberlin]. They said, ‘He has a tenure, there is no way you guys can do it.’ And we did it. 


I am sure that it will take time and effort [to achieve our next goals], but we will go for them. And we will go after other apologists of the Islamic regime of Iran, like Mousavian at Princeton and others.

## mTCP NetDrive

date: 2023-12-25, from: FreeDOS News

<div class="markdown_content"><p>NetDrive is a DOS device driver that allows you to access a remote disk image hosted by another machine as though it was a local device with an assigned drive letter. The remote disk image can be a floppy disk image or a hard drive image. Thanks to Michael B. Brutman for add this to his already very feature packed mTCP set. However, Michael notes that the rest of mTCP hasn't changed much so he's made NetDrive available as a separate download - although newer mTCP releases should include NetDrive.

## CloudNativePG 1.22.0, 1.21.2 and 1.20.5 Released!

date: 2023-12-25, from: PostgreSQL News

<p>The <strong>CloudNativePG Community</strong> is thrilled to unveil version 1.22.0 of the
<strong>CloudNativePG Operator</strong>, a significant milestone featuring the introduction
of <strong>declarative tablespaces</strong> and <strong>temporary tablespaces</strong> alongside various
enhancements and fixes.</p>
<p>Tablespaces, a powerful and widely adopted feature in database management
systems, now take center stage in CloudNativePG 1.22.0. This release empowers
users to boost the vertical scalability of their databases by decoupling the
physical and logical data modeling, achieving optimal performance through
parallel on-disk read/write operations. With CloudNativePG, users can define
additional tablespace volumes, and also ensure they can be used for temporary
operations (CloudNativePG seamlessly manages the <code>temp_tablespaces</code> GUC).</p>
<p>This marks a pivotal step towards adopting Very Large Databases, building upon
the foundation laid by Kubernetes volume snapshots introduced in version 1.21.</p>
<p>Starting from version 1.22.0, the <code>ALTER SYSTEM</code> command is now disabled by
default. This ensures that changes to the PostgreSQL configuration are
orchestrated through the Kubernetes API. This streamlined approach guarantees
coherence across the entire high-availability cluster and aligns with best
practices for Infrastructure-as-Code.</p>
<p>In terms of security, all supported versions now require TLS 1.3 for PostgreSQL
connections by default, further bolstering the integrity of data transmission.</p>
<p>Before initiating an upgrade, carefully review the
<a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/current/installation_upgrade/#upgrading-to-1220-1212-or-1205">detailed instructions</a>.
New patch releases are now available for all supported versions, including
1.21.2 and 1.20.5.</p>
<p>Considering the notable changes introduced, we strongly recommend upgrading to
CloudNativePG 1.22.0 at your earliest convenience. Alternatively, update to the
latest patch version within your current minor release.</p>
<p>With the release of 1.22.0, the 1.20.x minor version will reach its <a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.22/supported_releases/#support-status-of-cloudnativepg-releases">end of
life</a>
on January 21, 2024.</p>
<p>This release addresses several bugs for improved stability. For a comprehensive list of changes, refer to the following release notes:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.22/release_notes/v1.22/">Release notes for 1.22.0</a></li>

<li><a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.20/release_notes/v1.20/">Release notes for 1.20.5</a></li>

## Microsoft ending support for Windows 10 could send 240 mln PCs to landfills – report

date: 2023-12-24, from: OS News

Microsoft&#8217;s plan to end support for Windows 10 operating system could result in about 240 million personal computers being disposed, potentially adding to landfill waste, Canalys Research said. The electronic waste from these PCs could weigh an estimated 480 million kilograms, equivalent to 320,000 cars. While many PCs could remain functional for years post the end of OS support, Canalys warned demand for devices without security updates could be low. ↫ Akash Sriram for Reuters A lot of these machines are perfectly capable of running Windows 11 if not for Microsoft&#8217;s artificial restrictions, and while less relevant &#8211; most people can&#8217;t just switch to Linux or BSD &#8211; there are alternative operating systems to keep these machines going. The only good thing that might come of this is a flurry of cheap, usable hardware on the second hand market, which can be used by us enthusiasts for all kinds of things.

## Console

date: 2023-12-24, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1>Console</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to get used to <code>sway</code> as my window manager. Recently I realized that my <code>dmenu</code> wouldn&rsquo;t list games like <code>openarena</code>. No surprise there: <code>/usr/games/bin</code> is not part of <code>PATH</code> and so it doesn&rsquo;t get shown. I wondered how to get it there, and then I found that many people log in from the Linux console without a session manager or display manager. That is, they login from the console, get a login shell, and that shell then starts the window manager.</p>

<p>This is what I see on the first virtual console:</p>

<pre><code>Debian GNU/Linux 12 melanobombus tty1

login: _
</code></pre>

<p>If I log in, <code>fish</code> starts and one of the startup files it executes is <code>.config/fish/conf.d/sway.fish</code> which starts <code>sway</code> but only when logging in from <code>tty1</code>. You can switch between the consoles using Alt-F1 to Alt-F6. Once <code>sway</code> runs, you can switch back to the remaining virtual consoles using Ctrl Alt F2 to Ctrl Alt F6.</p>

<pre><code># If running from tty1 start sway
set TTY1 (tty)
[ &quot;$TTY1&quot; = &quot;/dev/tty1&quot; ] &amp;&amp; exec sway
</code></pre>

<p>Since this script uses <code>exec</code>, <code>sway</code> replaces <code>fish</code>. No big deal. But I still get to setup PATH.</p>

<p>So now I was staring at the login prompt of the console… and I don&rsquo;t know about you, but I could use a larger font!</p>

<p>I tried to go the <code>console-setup</code> route but that doesn&rsquo;t help:</p>

<pre><code>sudo dpkg-reconfigure console-setup
</code></pre>

<p>This allows me to change the console font.</p>

<p>And once my script runs, I can repeat that:</p>

<pre><code>setupcon
</code></pre>

<p>But at that point I&rsquo;m already logged in!</p>

<p>In theory, there&rsquo;s a systemd service that is supposed to handle it:</p>

<pre><code>$ systemctl status console-setup
● console-setup.service - Set console font and keymap

<p>And yet… it does not! Why is that? Examining <code>/lib/systemd/system/console-setup.service</code> I find that it runs <code>/lib/console-setup/console-setup.sh</code> and that does some complicated stuff to try and determine whether to run <code>setupcon</code> or not. I guess in my case doesn&rsquo;t?</p>

<p>Oh well, there&rsquo;s always the option of using kernel parameters!</p>

<p>I created a one line file called <code>/etc/default/grub.d/font.cfg</code> to set a console font. This way the default setting in <code>/etc/default/grub</code> is overwritten, too. No more <code>quiet splash</code>! I like to see the output scroll by as the system boots.</p>

<pre><code>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=&quot;fbcon=font:TER16x32&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>To activate it:</p>

<pre><code>sudo dpkg-reconfigure grub2
</code></pre>

<p>Rebooting the system, I noticed that things still didn&rsquo;t seem to work for the <code>initramfs</code> which ends up asking me for the password to decrypt my disk. So what I needed was to get the new config into the <code>initramfs</code>, too.</p>

<p>Based on the current kernel I&rsquo;m running:</p>

<pre><code>sudo dpkg-reconfigure linux-image-6.1.0-15-amd64
</code></pre>

<p>I think it works, now!</p>

## Automakers believe that their wish list is reasonable

Tomorrow is Christmas Day, and the hard-working elves at the Environmental Protection Agency are putting the finishing touches on tailpipe emission regulations that will govern the auto industry from 2027 to 2032. It is unlikely that Santa will be delivering finalized rules by tomorrow morning, but wish lists from all stakeholders were due on July 5th. The Alliance for Automotive Innovation (AAI) was not shy about asking for shiny new regulations that are less aggressive than those proposed by the EPA.

## Biden Campaigns on Economy, Abortion, Democracy — and Not Being Trump

date: 2023-12-24, from: VOA News USA

philadelphia / washington — U.S. President Joe Biden describes next year's election as a battle for "the soul" of his nation. His campaign has centered on that, and assertions that he has improved Americans' lives through his stands on the economy, access to abortion, and threats to democracy.


In recent months, he has crisscrossed the nation to talk up legislation that has created jobs, to promote his efforts to protect abortion rights and improve gun safety, and to speak — often passionately — about his work to protect constitutional rule.


He has approached so-called kitchen table issues in metaphorically apt settings that let him communicate several messages at once, such as when he told first responders Monday in Philadelphia — the birthplace of the U.S. Constitution — that firefighters once saved his house from burning down.


Or when he visited the district of one of his loudest Republican detractors in November to tout his work in bringing them climate-friendly jobs.


"The historic investments we're celebrating today is in Congressman [Lauren] Boebert's district," Biden said. "She's one of the leaders of this extreme MAGA [Make America Great Again] movement. She, along with every single Republican colleague, voted against the law that made these investments in jobs possible."


Or, at an event in November touting job growth, when he flexed his credentials as a grandparent to a rural Minnesota mother who tried to silence a crying baby, telling her, "It's OK. Kids are allowed to do that with me."


From his perch at the White House, Biden seems confident about his chances of defeating his most likely challenger, former President Donald Trump.


When a reporter asked him in early December if he thought Trump could be beaten by any Democrat other than him, Biden paused, smiled and said, "Probably 50 of them. … I'm not the only one who can defeat him, but I will defeat him."




Age factor 


But for a lot of U.S. voters, this is a numbers issue. Pollsters say most worry about the economy, while many also point to a number the Biden administration can't change: his advanced age.


By election night, Biden — who at 81 is about four years older than Trump — will be five years senior to the oldest man to ever occupy the office — Ronald Reagan.


Democratic pollsters say these concerns are weighing Biden down, leaving Trump currently ahead in critical swing states.


"Voters are not comfortable with the age of either of our candidates," Evan Roth Smith, head pollster for Blueprint, a public opinion research initiative, told VOA. "I think the age factor is part of the wider dissatisfaction with, 'Oh no. This again? We're doing this again, Trump versus Biden?'"


Trump has campaigned on the sidelines of his many court appearances facing a range of charges.


"He's playing to — as strange as it sounds — a sense of nostalgia, that when Donald Trump was president — and this is what he would say — prices were lower, the Middle East wasn't at war, Ukraine wasn't being invaded by Russia, China was was less muscular, and so on and so forth," Smith said.


Warns of Trump's vitriol


Biden also has recently worked a bit more Trump vitriol into his campaign, recently hammering on Trump's words that he will be a "dictator" for a day if he is re-elected.


"I'm going to follow the Hatch Act and avoid commenting on the 2024 election," deputy White House deputy press secretary Andrew Bates said in response to VOA's question about whether the administration sees Trump's comments as a national security threat.


But he added, "And I want to say: It is wrong to suspend the Constitution and abuse federal power to persecute critics and trample the First Amendment. It is wrong to override the will of the voters, as upheld by over 80 federal judges and the Trump administration's top election security official. It is wrong to engage in violent rhetoric and spread dangerous conspiracy theories that have cost brave police officers their lives."


Trump made the comment December 5 during an interview with a popular conservative media personality, who asked, "You are promising America tonight you would never abuse power as retribution against anybody?"


"Except for Day One," Trump replied.


He then elaborated, "I want to close the border, and I want to drill, drill, drill."


This strong contrast is one that both men — and those trying to supplant Trump for the Republican nomination — are attempting to highlight before November.


But one thing is clear if either man wins in 2024: After four years with each, American voters know exactly what kind of president they're choosing.

## US Investors See Value in Israeli Tech Firms Despite War

date: 2023-12-24, from: VOA News USA

HERZLIYA, Israel — Nearly 7,000 miles away in Portland, Oregon, venture capitalist George Djuric said he was compelled to visit Israel during the country's war with Palestinian militant group Hamas and to pledge support for the high-tech sector.


Djuric, chief technology officer at yVentures who arrived in the United States as a 3-year-old refugee from Bosnia during the Bosnian war in the mid-1990s, this week joined some 70 other U.S. tech executives and investors on a trip to Israel.


"Coming here is a chance to stand in solidarity with Israel and also support the tech ecosystem, which is the world's second largest after Silicon Valley," he said. "As a technology fund, it makes sense for us to be here."


Although not Jewish, Djuric said he was drawn to Israel by the state's resiliency and as someone whose family's views were shaped by war.


"I was horrified by what happened on October 7 and I was equally horrified the next day when I saw people demonstrating in support of what happened," he said, referring to the October 7 attack on Israel launched by Hamas.


Investors and analysts had predicted the conflict with the Palestinians would derail a fragile recovery in high-tech, which accounts for more than half of Israel's exports and nearly a fifth of its overall economic output.


Funding had already dropped sharply amid a global slowdown and a divisive government judicial overhaul when the war took its toll on the economy. Growth, on pace for a 3.4% clip this year, has fallen to an expected 2% with the outlook at least as grim.


At least 15% of the tech workforce has been called up for military reserve duty.


Yet, even as the war rages, tech funding deals are still getting done, albeit at a slower pace. Startups have raised more than $6 billion in 2023 compared with $16 billion in 2022.


On Tuesday, ScaleOps, a startup specializing in cloud resource management, announced a $21.5 million funding round. Last week, cyber startup Zero Networks, which prevents attackers from spreading in corporate networks, raised $20 million.


'Long-term bullish on Israel'


Ron Miasnik, of Bain Capital Ventures who co-organized the delegation, said he had expected Israeli startups to go on drawing large sums. He said he believed the country's economy would ultimately bounce back.


"It doesn't matter to us whether the economic rebound takes three months, six months, nine months or 12 months," he said. "We're long-term bullish on Israel."


Miasnik said the idea of the trip emerged from watching other solidarity groups, such as religious ones. "We felt the (U.S.) tech and the venture capital community, which is so heavily integrated within Israel, was missing," he said.


Initially, it was supposed to be just 15 people but, he said, hundreds of people showed interest. They included CEOs and senior executives of U.S.-based tech and VC funds from Meetup.com, Apollo, TPG, Susquehanna Growth Equity, Mastercard, John Deere and Harvard University's endowment investment fund.


In addition to meeting local investors and startups, they met Israeli leaders and families of hostages still held captive in Gaza and toured border towns hit by the October 7 attack.


Bain has a number of investments in Israel, including Redis Labs, in which the fund has invested more than $100 million, and cybersecurity firm Armis, and Miasnik said he was seeking to add more Israeli cybersecurity startups to its portfolio.


Similarly, Danny Schultz, managing director of New York-based Gotham Ventures said he was looking to invest in 10 to 20 Israeli growth stage startups, mainly in fintech, in the next three to five years.


"At the point that Israeli CEOs need more capital, they also need relationships across the ocean in the U.S. and Europe to really help build their companies," he said.


Joy Marcus co-founded a new VC fund called The 98 and only invests in "women-led technology businesses that are disrupting industry."


"I am tortured by the war. ... So I am here to support Israel first and foremost," she said. "And I am also very interested in investing in some Israeli women."

## Nevada Tribe Says Coalitions, Not Lawsuits, Will Protect Sacred Sites as US Advances Energy Agenda

date: 2023-12-24, from: VOA News USA

RENO, NEV. — The room was packed with Native American leaders from across the United States, all invited to Washington to hear from federal officials about President Joe Biden's accomplishments and new policy directives aimed at improving relationships and protecting sacred sites.


Arlan Melendez was not among them.


The longtime chairman of the Reno-Sparks Indian Colony convened his own meeting 4,023 kilometers away. He wanted to show his community would find another way to fight the U.S. government's approval of a massive lithium mine at the site where more than two dozen of their Paiute and Shoshone ancestors were massacred in 1865.


Opposed by government lawyers at every legal turn, Melendez said another arduous appeal would not save sacred sites from being desecrated.


"We're not giving up the fight, but we are changing our strategy," Melendez said.


That shift for the Nevada tribe comes as Biden and other top federal officials double down on their vows to do a better job of working with Native American leaders on everything from making federal funding more accessible to incorporating tribal voices into land preservation efforts and resource management planning.


The administration also has touted more spending on infrastructure and health care across Indian Country.


Many tribes have benefited, including those who led campaigns to establish new national monuments in Utah and Arizona. In New Mexico, pueblos have succeeded in getting the Interior Department to ban new oil and natural gas development on hundreds of square miles of federal land for 20 years to protect culturally significant areas.


But the colony in Reno and others like the Tohono O'odham Nation in Arizona say promises of more cooperation ring hollow when it comes to high-stakes battles over multibillion-dollar "green energy" projects. Some tribal leaders have said consultation resulted in little more than listening sessions, with federal officials not incorporating tribal comments into the decision making.




Rather than pursue its claims in court that the federal government failed to engage in meaningful consultation regarding the lithium mine at Thacker Pass, the Reno-Sparks Indian Colony will focus on organizing a broad coalition to build public support for sacred places.


Tribal members are concerned other culturally significant areas will end up in the path of a modern-day Gold Rush that has companies scouting for lithium and other materials needed to meet Biden's clean energy agenda.


Melendez was among those thrilled when Biden appointed Deb Haaland to lead the Interior Department. A member of Laguna Pueblo, Haaland is the first Native American to serve as a Cabinet secretary.


Melendez, a former member of the U.S. Human Rights Commission who has led his colony for 32 years, said he understands the difficulty of navigating the electoral landscape in a western swing state where the mining industry's political clout is second only to the power wielded by casinos.


Still, he was disappointed Haaland declined an invitation to visit the massacre site.


"The largest lithium project in the United States and they don't even have the time to come out here and meet with the tribal nations in the state of Nevada," he said.


The tribe's lawyer, Will Falk, urged other tribes to resist "tricking ourselves into believing that just because the first Native American secretary of Interior is in office that she actually cares about protecting sacred sites."


Interior Department spokeswoman Melissa Schwartz didn't respond directly to that criticism but said in an email to The Associated Press that there has been "significant communications and partnership with tribes in Nevada."


The federal government in early December published new guidance for dealing with sacred sites. While Falk and others are skeptical, they acknowledged the document speaks to concerns tribes have raised for decades.


Among other things, the guidance says federal agencies should involve tribes as early as possible when planning projects to identify potential impacts to sacred sites and to determine whether mitigation measures can allay concerns. Agencies also should consult with tribes that attach significance to the project area, regardless of where they are located.


It also suggests Indigenous knowledge should be on equal footing with other sciences and incorporated into the federal decision-making process. That knowledge can consist of practices, cultural beliefs and oral and written histories that tribes have developed over many generations.


Justin C. Ahasteen, executive director of the Navajo Nation Washington (D.C.) Office, said the new guidance appears to have incorporated some of the recommendations made by tribal leaders but that it could have gone further.


"If this guidebook increases transparency in the consultation process, we will take it as a win," Ahasteen said. "But ultimately the thing we all seek is for the federal government to acknowledge the necessity of tribal consent before changing rules that affect tribes."


The problem, Falk said, is none of it is legally binding.




"These kinds of documents function more as pacifying propaganda," he said.


Western Shoshone Defense Project Director Fermina Stevens said the changes were "more 'lip service' for the government to deal with the 'Indian problem' in this new day and age of mineral extraction."


Morgan Rodman, executive director of the White House Council on Native American Affairs, disagrees. He said the guidance is intended to serve as a springboard to improve engagement with tribes and that the administration will be aggressive with training to make sure employees have an understanding of what sacred sites are.


"While change certainly doesn't happen overnight, it's part of a continuum of important policy statements — part of the momentum we've been building the last three years," he said in an interview.


Rodman made clear he wasn't referencing Thacker Pass, but some directives he highlighted have been key points of contention in that case.


U.S. Judge Miranda Du in Reno twice ruled the tribe failed to prove the massacre occurred on the specific grounds of the mining project, or that far-flung tribes had a legal stake in the fight. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld her earlier ruling in July.


The tribe says the government has ignored evidence that the land they consider sacred isn't limited to a specific site where the U.S. Calvary first attacked men, women and children as they slept.


They cited newspaper accounts, diaries and a government surveyor's report documenting human skulls discovered along a miles-long escape route crossing the mine site where troops killed and scalped those who tried to flee.


Tribal historic preservation officer Michon Eben said the whole stretch is an unmarked burial ground.


Melendez said he's pleased Biden has promised to enhance consultation.


But if federal agencies don't follow through, he said, "Well, it's just words that really don't mean anything to us."

## Alarm clock failure

date: 2023-12-24, from: Jirka's blog

During 2018 and 2019 I used the PSION Organiser IILZ as my alarm clock. It  was very  good for  that:  it is  possible  to define  eight or  so different alarms which can be  repeated daily, on workdays, on weekends or just in selected day of week.  It fitted my needs very well. And she sound was loud enough (unlike the  alarm on m68k Palms which is useless because it is quiet and very short). It has been also practical to have a simple note taking device near my  bed - to record some evening ideas and so.

## Haitian Migrants in US Place Their Hopes on Hard Work, Helping Hands

date: 2023-12-24, from: VOA News USA

BOSTON  — When Ernseau Admettre decided to leave Haiti and head north with his young family in tow, very little was guaranteed.


But the situation in his homeland, beset by poverty and gang violence, had grown so dire that a risky passage to and then across the United States' Southern border offered a kind of hope he said he could never find by staying put.


Admettre discovered Boston through the internet and set his sights on Massachusetts. The trip took the family through several countries including the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua and Mexico.


"We're going through a very tragic moment in our country. We have no safety. We cannot definitely have all our needs met in Haiti," Admettre said through a translator Friday. "Leaving Haiti was the best solution to survive."


The Admettres — Ernseau, 43; his wife, Jimene, 36: and their children Elionai, 6, and Gabyana, 2 months — eventually arrived at the Boston International Airport right as winter temperatures were settling in.


Ernseau Admettre said he was lucky to be discovered by volunteers working to fill gaps in the shelter system as his family was being kicked out of the airport. He viewed those volunteers as angels sent by God.


"I don't have any family who lives in the United States," he said. "We didn't expect to receive this welcome or experience because we have no family ties here."


The family is now one of eight that have found shelter at a rectory building at the Bethel AME Church in Boston's Jamaica Plain neighborhood. The families — which include 13 children ranging from infants to a 15-year-old — total 28 individuals, according to Geralde Gabeau, executive director of the Immigrant Family Services Institute in Boston, which is helping provide services.


Admettre said he has received a work authorization and hopes to start bringing in money so his family can move out of the shelter and into an apartment. He said he has studied business administration and computer sciences and is also a tailor.


Gabeau said the migrants are determined to work hard to find their way in the country. She said they are focused first on getting authorized to work. The organization hopes to bring in employers in January to help those living in the rectory find a way to jobs and more permanent homes.


For now, they live and cook together and take English and computer classes.


"They live as a community," Gabeau said, pointing to big pots of vegetables and meat and Haitian rice on the kitchen stove.


Demand for shelter has increased as the state struggles to find newly arriving migrants places to stay after hitting a state-imposed limit of 7,500 families in its emergency homeless shelter system last month.


As of Thursday, there were more than 350 families on the state waiting list hoping to find a spot in the system. The state planned to open a former courthouse in Cambridge as an overnight overflow site to accommodate some of them.


The space can fit up to 70 families with cots and limited amenities and will only be used in the evening and overnight hours, according to Scott Rice, director general of Massachusetts Emergency Assistance. The site is only open to families who have been assessed at a state intake site and determined to be eligible for emergency assistance.


Rice said the facility will give eligible families a warm, safe place to sleep until a shelter unit becomes available.


"We encourage community organizations to reach out to us with any daytime programs and resources they are able to provide to families in need," Rice said in a statement.

## Contrary to Politicians' Claims, Offshore Wind Farms Don't Kill Whales

date: 2023-12-24, from: VOA News USA

PORTLAND, Maine  — Unfounded claims about offshore wind threatening whales have surfaced as a flashpoint in the fight over the future of renewable energy.


In recent months, conservatives including former President Donald Trump have claimed construction of offshore wind turbines is killing the giant animals.


Scientists say there is no credible evidence linking offshore wind farms to whale deaths. But that hasn't stopped conservative groups and ad hoc “not in my back yard”-style anti-development groups from making the connection.


The Associated Press sorts fact from fiction when it comes to whales and wind power as the rare North Atlantic right whale's migration season gets under way:


Where are US offshore wind projects?


To date, two commercial offshore wind farms are under construction in the United States. Danish wind energy developer Ørsted and the utility Eversource are building South Fork Wind, located 56 kilometers east of Montauk Point, New York. Ørsted announced December 7 that the first of its 12 turbines there is now sending electricity onto the grid. Vineyard Wind is building a 62-turbine wind farm 24 kilometers off Massachusetts. Both plan to open by early next year, and other large offshore wind projects are obtaining permits.


There are also two pilot projects — five turbines off Rhode Island and two off Virginia. The Biden administration aims to power 10 million homes with offshore wind by 2030 — a key piece of its climate goals.


Lawsuits from community groups delayed Ørsted’s two large offshore wind projects in New Jersey, and the company recently announced it’s canceling those projects. That decision was based on their economic viability and had nothing to do with offshore wind opposition in New Jersey, said David Hardy, group executive vice president and CEO Americas at Ørsted.


Are US wind farms causing whale deaths?


Experts say there’s no evidence that limited wind farm construction on the Atlantic Coast has directly resulted in any whale deaths, despite politically motivated statements suggesting a link.


Rumors began to swirl after 2016, when an unusual number of whales started to be found dead or stranded on New England beaches — a trend that predates major offshore wind farm construction that began this year.


"With whale strandings along the Northeast earlier this year in places like New Jersey, the reality is that it’s not from offshore wind," said Aaron Rice, a marine biologist at Cornell University.


In answering questions about whale strandings earlier this year, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported that around 40% of recovered whale carcasses showed evidence of death from fishing gear entanglement or vessel strikes. The others could not be linked to a specific cause.


In Europe, where offshore wind has been developed for more than three decades, national agencies also have not found causal links between wind farms and whale deaths.




Meanwhile, U.S. scientists are collecting data near offshore wind farms to monitor any possible impacts short of fatality, such as altered behavior or changes to migration routes. This research is still in preliminary stages, said Doug Nowacek, a marine biologist at Duke University who helped put trackers on whales this summer off Massachusetts as part of a five-year federally-funded study.


What real dangers do whales face?


While the exact causes of recent whale strandings along the East Coast mostly are not known, whales do face dangers from human activities.


The biggest threats are shipping collisions and entanglement in fishing gear, according to scientists and federal authorities. Underwater noise pollution is another concern, they say.


Some advocates for protecting whales have characterized the push against offshore wind power as a distraction from real issues. "It seems that this is being used in an opportunistic way by anti-wind interests," said Gib Brogan, fisheries campaign director at the environmental group Oceana.


Since 2016, humpback whales have been dying at an advanced rate — one the federal government terms an "unusual mortality event." The much rarer North Atlantic right whale with fewer than 360 on Earth is also experiencing an unusual mortality event.


NOAA reports 83 whales have died off the East Coast since December 1, 2022. Roughly half were humpbacks between Massachusetts and North Carolina, and two were critically-endangered right whales in North Carolina and Virginia.


What's being done to protect whales near wind farms?


Federal law sets limits on human-generated sound underwater for continuous noise and short sudden bursts.


Marine construction projects can reduce possible impact on marine mammals, including by pausing construction during migration seasons, using “bubble curtains” to contain sound from pile-driving and stationing trained observers with binoculars on ships to look for marine mammals.


Offshore wind developers are taking steps required by regulators, but also are voluntarily adopting measures to ensure marine mammals are not harmed. Ørsted won't drive piles between December 1 and April 30, when whales are on the move. It uses additional lookout vehicles, encircles monopiles for turbines with bubble curtains and does underwater acoustic monitoring.


Equinor plans to use acoustic monitoring and infrared cameras to detect whales when it starts developing two lease areas off Long Island with its partner bp. The company says it will limit pile driving to months when right whales are least likely to be present.


Why are some people alleging wind farms cause whale deaths?


One vocal opponent of offshore wind is the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank based in Washington, D.C. Diana Furchtgott-Roth, director of the foundation's center for energy, climate and environment, wrote in November that Ørsted's scrapped New Jersey wind project was "unsightly" and a threat to wildlife.


"Whales and birds ... stand to gain if offshore wind abandons the Garden State," Furchtgott-Roth wrote.


Ørsted's Hardy said claims about wind farms killing whales are "not scientific" but "very much politically-driven misinformation."


The Heartland Institute, another conservative public policy group, has also pushed back at offshore wind projects. H. Sterling Burnett, director of the Arthur B. Robinson Center on Climate and Environmental Policy at the institute, said the wind projects are subject to unfairly lax regulatory restrictions compared to fossil fuel projects.


"We think it should be held to the same standard that any oil and gas project would be," Burnett said.


Smaller anti-wind groups have also organized in coastal communities to oppose projects they feel jeopardize water views, coastal industries and recreation.


What's the impact of misinformation?


Offshore wind opponents are using unsupported claims about harm to whales to try to stop projects, with some of the loudest opposition centered in New Jersey.


Misinformation can cause angst in coastal communities where developers need to build shoreside infrastructure to operate a wind farm.


Republican politicians have taken opposition from shore towns and community groups seriously. GOP congressmen from New Jersey, Maryland and Arizona got the U.S. Government Accountability Office to open an investigation into the offshore wind industry's impacts on commercial fishing and marine life and want a moratorium on projects.


New Jersey’s Democrat-controlled Legislature remains steadfastly behind the industry.


Are whales affected by climate change?


One reason whale advocates push for renewable energy is that they say climate change is harming the animals — and less reliance on fossil fuels would help solve that problem.


Scientists say global warming has caused the right whale's preferred food — tiny crustaceans — to move as waters have warmed.


That means the whales have strayed from protected areas of ocean in search of food, leaving them vulnerable to ship strikes and entanglements. Large whales play a vitally important role in the ecosystem by storing carbon, so some scientists say they are also part of the solution to climate change.
