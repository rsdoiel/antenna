id="man-who-sold-fentanyl-laced-pill-liable-for-5.8-million-in-death-of-young-female-customer">Man
who sold fentanyl-laced pill liable for $5.8 million in death of young
female customer</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — In 2019, Brandon McDowell was contacted by a sophomore
in college who asked to buy Percocet, a prescription painkiller. </p>
<p>What the 20-year-old sold her instead were counterfeit pills laced
with fentanyl, a deadly synthetic opioid that can be lethal in a dose as
small as 2 milligrams. Hours later, Alexandra Capelouto, also 20, was
dead in her Temecula, California, home. </p>
<p>It is an increasingly common scenario as fentanyl overdoses have
become a leading cause of death for minors in the last five years, with
more than 74,000 people dying in the U.S. from a synthetic opioid in
2023, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. </p>
<p>McDowell has been behind bars since 2022 with a fentanyl possession
conviction. But the Capeloutos have now won an additional $5.8 million
judgment against him for the death of their daughter. </p>
<p>“We’ve won the battle but not the war,” said Matt Capelouto,
Alexandra’s father. “We still have a long ways to go in terms of holding
drug dealers accountable for deaths.” </p>
<p>Baruch Cohen, the Capeloutos’ lawyer, said this was the first time a
drug dealer has been held liable civilly for someone’s death, to his
knowledge. </p>
<p>“Here’s the hope that this judgment will be the shot that’s heard
around the world, so to speak,” Cohen said. “Because if it inhibits
another drug deal from going down, where the drug dealer … realizes
that, besides the jail sentence, he is liable for millions of dollars of
damages, maybe he’ll think twice.” </p>
<p>McDowell, now 25, first pleaded guilty in California federal court in
2022 for possession with intent to distribute fentanyl, a charge that
carries a 20-year minimum sentence if linked to death or serious injury
and convicted by a jury. McDowell was sentenced to nine years in
prison. </p>
<p>Alexandra’s father felt that wasn’t enough. He and his wife, who was
diagnosed with stage four breast cancer that year and has been battling
it since, decided to sue McDowell for wrongful death. </p>
<p>“For taking somebody’s life, that was not a fair sentence,” he said.
“I was going to pursue every means possible to make sure justice was
served.” </p>
<p>While McDowell filed for bankruptcy, the Capeloutos won a judgment of
about $5 million against him. The Superior Court of Riverside County
found he sold harmful narcotics with “willful and malicious” intent that
led to Alexandra Capelouto’s death. A few months later, the Capeloutos
filed another case in federal bankruptcy court to ensure that McDowell
could not escape his debt under bankruptcy. </p>
<p>“Bankruptcy is designed for honest debtors, not crooked criminal
debtors,” Cohen said. “This judgment will haunt him the rest of his
life, and when he does make money, we’ll garnish it. When he does buy
property, we’ll put a lien on it.” </p>
<p>Judge Mark Houle ruled in the Capeloutos’ favor, ordering a $5.8
million judgment against Brandon McDowell that includes a year and half
of interest in addition to the initial $5 million. </p>
<p>Since his daughter’s death, Matt Capelouto founded the non-profit
Stop Drug Homicide to advocate for families and push for more
legislation to hold drug dealers accountable. One is Alexandra’s Law,
which would require a formal warning be given to anyone with a
drug-related conviction to inform them of the dangers of dealing drugs
and that they could be charged with murder if they distribute drugs that
lead to someone’s death. </p>
<p>In California, it can be difficult for prosecutors to charge drug
dealers with someone’s death because they must prove the dealer had
knowledge that the drugs could cause death, Capelouto said. Having an
admonishment on the record for dealers who have been convicted of a
drug-related crime could be used as evidence in future cases if someone
dies from the drugs they sold. Alexandra’s Law is included in
Proposition 36, a tough-on-crime ballot measure that Californians will
vote on in November. </p>
<p>Capelouto is also part of a group of 60 families suing Snapchat for
its role in the distribution of deadly narcotics. Alexandra Capelouto
and Brandon McDowell had communicated over Snapchat when she bought
pills from him. </p>
<p>Justin McDowell, Brandon’s father, said it is unfair for his son to
take all the blame. He said his son was struggling with drug abuse and
had been in rehab, and he didn’t live with him at the time because the
McDowells had younger children. </p>
<p>“My son is no drug dealer at all. They were both users. They both had
an addiction,” he said. “He was a stupid 20-year-old kid.” </p>
<p>Justin McDowell said he felt like the Capeloutos were seeking revenge
through their lawsuits, and he did not have the money and resources to
fight on his son’s behalf in court. Brandon McDowell was being held at
the federal prison in San Pedro during the lawsuit and did not have
lawyers to defend himself in civil or bankruptcy court. </p>
<p>“I think that’s sad, that shouldn’t be allowed,” Justin McDowell
said. “We’ll wait for him to get out of prison, give him a hug, and
figure out how to deal with the situation … the kid’s never going to
make $5.8 million in his life.” </p>
<p>Matt Capelouto said there was no evidence of his daughter having a
drug addiction, and Brandon McDowell’s addiction does not absolve him of
responsibility in her death. </p>
<p>“When you go from drug user to drug dealer, you cross a line from
needing help to needing to be held accountable,” he said.</p>

<h2 id="teamsters-union-declines-to-endorse-trump-or-harris">Teamsters
union declines to endorse Trump or Harris</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The International Brotherhood of Teamsters declined
Wednesday to endorse Kamala Harris or Donald Trump for president, saying
neither candidate had sufficient support from the 1.3 million-member
union.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, neither major candidate was able to make serious
commitments to our union to ensure the interests of working people are
always put before big business,” Teamsters President Sean O’Brien said
in a statement. “We sought commitments from both Trump and Harris not to
interfere in critical union campaigns or core Teamsters industries — and
to honor our members’ right to strike — but were unable to secure those
pledges.”</p>
<p>Harris met Monday with a panel of Teamsters, having long courted
organized labor and made support for the middle class her central policy
goal. Trump also met with a panel of Teamsters and even invited O’Brien
to speak at the Republican National Convention, where the union leader
railed against corporate greed.</p>
<p>The Teamsters said Wednesday that internal polling of its members
showed Trump with an advantage over Harris.</p>
<p>The Teamsters’ choice to not endorse came just weeks ahead of the
November 5 election, far later than other large unions such as the
AFL-CIO and the United Auto Workers, which have chosen to back
Harris.</p>

id="gnome-47-released-with-accent-colours-and-completely-new-opensave-file-dialogs">GNOME
47 released with accent colours and completely new open/save file
dialogs</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-18, from: OS News</p>
<p>The GNOME project has released their newest major version, GNOME 47,
and while it’s not the most groundbreaking release, there’s still a ton
of good stuff in here. Two features really stand our, with the first one
being the addition of accent colours. Instead of being locked into the
default GNOME blue accent colour, you can now choose between a variety
of colours, which is a very welcome addition. I use the accent colour
feature on all my computers, and since I run KDE, I also have this nifty
KDE feature where it’ll select an accent colour automatically based on
your wallpaper. No, this isn’t a groundbreaking feature, but considering
GNOME’s tendency towards not allowing any customisation, this is simply
very welcome. A much more substantial feature comes in the form of brand
new open/save file dialogs, and I’m sure even the GNOME developers
themselves are collectively sighing in relief about this one. GNOME’s
open/save dialogs were so bad they became a meme, and now they’re
finally well and truly fixed, thanks to effectively removing the old
ones and adding new ones based on the GNOME Files file manager. GNOME 47
comes with brand new file open and save file dialogs. The new dialogs
are a major upgrade compared with the previous versions, and are based
on the existing Files app rather than being a separate codebase. This
results in the new dialogs having a much more complete set of features
compared with the old open and save dialogs. With the new dialogs you
can zoom the view, change the sort order in the icon view, rename files
and folders, preview files, and more. ↫ GNOME 47 release notes And yes,
this includes thumbnails. There’s tons more in GNOME 47, like a new
design for dialog windows that look and feel more like they belong on a
mobile UI, tons of improvements to Files, the Settings application,
GNOME Online Accounts, Web, and more. GNOME 47 will make its way to your
distribution of choice soon enough, but of course, you can always build
and install it yourself if you’re so inclined.</p>

id="climate-week-talks-to-include-critical-minerals-and-seabed-mining-debate">Climate
week talks to include critical minerals and seabed mining debate</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — When activists, policymakers and representatives from
across the globe gather next week in New York to participate in climate
week, one pressing issue on the agenda that is less frequently discussed
and known will be the environmental impact of seabed mining. </p>
<p>As countries look for ways to lower emissions, critical minerals are
playing a key role in that transition. Critical minerals are used in all
kinds of green technologies, from solar panels and wind turbines to
batteries in electric vehicles. And one place where those mineral
resources are abundant is deep under the sea. </p>
<p>The debate over accessing seabed resources is heated. Supporters say
the technology exists to safely access these critical minerals undersea,
but environmentalists and activists say the potential of undiscovered
biodiversity on the seafloor is too important to endanger. </p>
<p>During climate week, which will take place on the sidelines of U.N.
General Assembly meetings, organizers are expected to host a roundtable
on the environmental impact of seabed mining and other discussions about
critical minerals. </p>
<p>The World Economic Forum says that if the globe wants to reach
net-zero emissions by 2050, two-thirds of vehicles must be powered by
electric batteries. And the International Energy Agency says that to
reach that goal, the world needs six times more mineral resources by
2040 than it has today. </p>
<p>Some of the largest mineral deposits are found on the ocean floor in
the form of polymetallic nodules, or rocks.  </p>
<p>Ocean of resources </p>
<p>According to the International Seabed Authority, or ISA, there are 21
billion tons of polymetallic nodules strewn across the seabed of the
Clarion-Clipperton Zone, or CCZ. Each nodule contains a combination of
electric vehicle battery components such as nickel, manganese, copper
and cobalt. The ISA plans to release regulations for mining in the
international waters of the CCZ by 2025. </p>
<p>The ISA has already awarded 17 exploration contracts for polymetallic
nodules in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone – a large swath of the Pacific
Ocean the size of the continental United States which sits between
Hawaii and Mexico. Three of those exploration contracts went to The
Metals Company, a Canadian deep-sea mining company.   </p>
<p>The Pacific Island Nations of Nauru, Kiribati and Tonga have
sponsored The Metals Company’s efforts to develop a portion of the
seabed. In an interview with VOA, CEO Gerard Barron said the company is
ready to begin as soon as the ISA allows mining. </p>
<p>“Our collector methodology is to put a robot on the seafloor which
crawls around the ocean floor and fires a jet of water at the nodule and
it creates an inverse pressure and lifts the nodule up, and so we don’t
go down and scour the seafloor,” said Barron via Zoom, adding that TMC
has spent the past decade focused on testing this equipment and
collecting data on its environmental impact as part of its permit
application to the ISA. </p>
<p>Moratorium needed </p>
<p>Critics worry scooping up these mineral-rich rocks will disrupt
important biodiversity – much of it still unnamed and some of it
undiscovered. Researchers have found that 90% of the more than 5,000
species in the zone are new to science. Eddie Palu, president of the
Tonga Fishery Association, wants a pause for more research. </p>
<p>“We demand a moratorium on the seabed mining until the environmental,
economic and social risk are comprehensively understood,” he said during
a panel discussion at the recent Pacific Islands Forum in Tonga. </p>
<p>Shiva Gounden from Greenpeace Australia Pacific, who also sat on the
panel, agreed.  </p>
<p>“We know only very little of the deep sea, and the race for the final
frontier could cause irreversible damages to the people and to the
communities of our Pacific,” Gounden said. </p>
<p>But scientists say no light and very little oxygen reaches the deep
sea – limiting the life there to mostly bacteria and small
invertebrates.  </p>
<p>The Metals Company’s Barron said combating climate change is a bigger
threat to the planet than undersea mining, adding that the company’s
environmental impact studies show that “we can safely collect these
nodules” and turn them into battery metals without having “a negative
impact on the ocean.” </p>
<p>“The notion that we can do any extraction with zero impact is a
dream,” added Barron. “The oceans are impacted by every single thing we
do today, especially global warming. So, we need to address the main
driver for climate change and reduce emissions.” </p>
<p>Fueling innovation  </p>
<p>Still, the quest to do just that – access minerals on the seabed with
minimal impact to the environment – has created competition between
technology companies. </p>
<p>U.S. tech startup Impossible Metals is testing a robot which can
avoid nodules where it detects life and harvests those where it does
not. </p>
<p>“The vehicle hovers above the seabed, uses the camera and it actually
picks up the nodules one by one. So this really minimizes all of the
negative concerns around big sediment plumes,” CEO Oliver Gunasekra told
VOA in an interview. </p>
<p>Gunaskera’s company spun off Viridian Biometals. Its technology
bypasses energy-intensive processes such as smelting with bacteria which
can separate metal ore from the rock around it. The process creates no
emissions or waste. </p>
<p>“The bacteria need oxygen just like we do to breathe. And when
there’s not enough oxygen in the water around them, the bacteria have
learned that there’s oxygen in the rocks, and they have adapted to
breathe that oxygen,” said Viridian CEO Eric Macris. </p>
<p>Impossible Metals and Viridian Biometals say they are two to three
years out from commercializing their technology, depending on funding.
TMC says it could be ready to begin its collection operations as soon as
international regulations are released next year.</p>

town moves Confederate monument that became an eyesore</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>grenada, mississippi — A Mississippi town has taken down a
Confederate monument that stood on the courthouse square since 1910 — a
figure that was tightly wrapped in tarps the past four years,
symbolizing the community’s enduring division over how to commemorate
the past.</p>
<p>Grenada’s first Black mayor in two decades seems determined to follow
through on the city’s plans to relocate the monument to other public
land, a concrete slab behind a fire station about 5.6 kilometers from
the square.</p>
<p>But a new fight might be developing. A Republican lawmaker from
another part of Mississippi wrote to Grenada officials saying she
believes the city is violating a state law that restricts the relocation
of war memorials or monuments.</p>
<p>The Grenada City Council voted to move the monument in 2020, weeks
after police killed George Floyd in Minneapolis. The vote seemed timely:
Mississippi legislators had just retired the last state flag in the U.S.
that prominently featured the Confederate battle emblem.</p>
<p>The tarps went up soon after the vote, shrouding the Confederate
soldier and the pedestal he stood on. But even as people complained
about the eyesore, the move was delayed by tight budgets, state
bureaucracy or political foot-dragging.</p>
<p>A new mayor and city council took office in May, prepared to take
action. On Sept. 11, with little advance notice, police blocked traffic
and a work crew disassembled and removed the 6.1-meter stone
structure.</p>
<p>“I’m glad to see it move to a different location,” said Robin
Whitfield, an artist with a studio just off Grenada’s historic square.
“This represents that something has changed.”</p>
<p>Still, Whitfield, who is white, said she wishes Grenada leaders had
invited the community to engage in a discussion about the symbol, to
bridge the gap between those who think moving it is erasing history and
those who see it as a daily reminder of white supremacy. She was among
the few people watching as a crane lifted parts of the monument onto a
flatbed truck.</p>
<p>“No one ever talked about it, other than yelling on Facebook,”
Whitfield said.</p>
<p>Mayor Charles Latham said the monument has been “quite a divisive
figure” in the town of 12,300, where about 57% of residents are Black
and 40% are white.</p>
<p>“I understand people had family … fight and die in that war, and they
should be proud of their family,” Latham said. “But you’ve got to
understand that there were those who were oppressed by this, by the
Confederate flag on there. There’s been a lot of hate and violence
perpetrated against people of color, under the color of that flag.”</p>
<p>The city received permission from the Mississippi Department of
Archives and History to move the Confederate monument, as required. But
Representative Stacey Hobgood-Wilkes of Picayune said the fire station
site is inappropriate.</p>
<p>“We are prepared to pursue such avenues that may be necessary to
ensure that the statue is relocated to a more suitable and appropriate
location,” she wrote, suggesting a Confederate cemetery closer to the
courthouse square as an alternative. She said the Ladies Cemetery
Association is willing to deed a parcel to the city to make it
happen.</p>
<p>The Confederate monument in Grenada is one of hundreds in the South,
most of which were dedicated during the early 20th century when groups
such as the United Daughters of the Confederacy sought to shape the
historical narrative by valorizing the Lost Cause mythology of the Civil
War.</p>
<p>The monuments, many of them outside courthouses, came under fresh
scrutiny after an avowed white supremacist who had posed with
Confederate flags in photos posted online killed nine Black people
inside the historic Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in
Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015.</p>

<h2 id="renewable-energys-farmland-free-for-all">Renewable Energy’s
Farmland Free-for-All</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-18, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzY0NDMxMS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1NDEwMTMzMX0.cSTFCnlGOzMA1Iz-jruDfd1fDXZm52Qg0axOUI3UUFc/image.jpg?width=2160&height=1440&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Farms are fast becoming one of the most powerful opponents to renewable
energy in the United States, second perhaps only to the fossil fuel
industry. And it’s frighteningly unclear how developers will resolve
this problem – or if they even can.
</p>
<p>
As solar and wind has grown rapidly across the country, so too have
protests against solar and wind power on “prime farmland,” a loose term
used by industry and government officials to describe property best
suited for growing lots of crops. Towns and counties are banning the
construction of solar and wind farms on prime farmland. State regulators
– including those run by Democrats – are restricting renewable
development on prime farmland, and members of Congress are looking at
cutting off or restricting federal funds to projects on prime farmland.
</p>
<p>
In theory, meeting our country’s climate goals and industry needs should
require
<a href="https://today.oregonstate.edu/news/installing-solar-panels-agricultural-lands-maximizes-their-efficiency-new-study-shows" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>very
little farmland</u></a>. But those same wide expanses flush with
sunlight and gusts of wind sought after by developers happen to often be
used by farmers: A USDA study released this
<a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/109209/err-330.pdf?v=9082.7" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>year
found</u></a> more than 90% of wind turbines and 70% of solar farms in
rural areas were sited on agricultural land.
</p>
<p>
It would be easy for an activist or energy nerd to presume this farmland
free-for-all is being driven by outside actors or adverse incentives
(and there’s a little bit of that going on, as we’ll get to).
</p>
<p>
However, weeks of reporting – and internal Heatmap News datasets – have
revealed to me that farmland opposition actually has a devilishly simple
explanation: many large farm owners are just plain hostile to land use
changes that could potentially, or even just hypothetically, impact
their capacity to grow more crops.
</p>
<p>
This means there is no easy solution and as I’ll explain, it is unclear
whether the renewables sector’s efforts to appear more accommodating to
agricultural businesses – most notably agri-voltaics – will stem the
tide of local complaints from rural farmers.
</p>
<p>
“This is a new land use that is very quickly accelerating across the
country and one of the major reactions is just to that fact,” Ethan
Winter of American Farmland Trust, a nonprofit promoting solar education
in farm communities, told me. “These are people who’ve been farming this
land for generations in some instances. The idea of doing anything to
take it out of agricultural production is just hard for them, for their
community, and it’s about the culture of their community, and if solar
is something that can be considered compatible with agriculture.”
</p>
<h2>
Tracking the conflict
</h2>
<p>
Over 40% of all restrictive ordinances and moratoriums in Heatmap Pro’s
database are occurring in counties with large agricultural workforces.
</p>
<p>
In fact, our internal data via Heatmap Pro has found that agricultural
employment can be a useful predictor of whether a community will oppose
the deployment of renewables. It’s particularly salient where there’s
large-scale, capital-intensive farming, likely because the kind of
agriculture requiring expensive machinery, costly chemicals, and
physical and financial infrastructure — think insurance and loans —
indicates that farming is the economic cornerstone of that entire
community.
</p>
<p>
Resentment against renewables is pronounced in the Corn Belt, but it’s
also happening even in the bluest of states like Connecticut, where
state environmental regulators
<a href="https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/deep/permits_and_licenses/client-concierge/draft-guidance-for-siting-solar-on-agricultural-land.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>have
recommended</u></a> against developing on prime farmland and require
additional permits to build on preferred fertile soils. Or New York,
where under pressure from farming groups including the state Farm
Bureau, the state legislature last year included language in a new
<a href="https://legislation.nysenate.gov/pdf/bills/2023/s4006c#page=115" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>permitting
authority law</u></a> limiting the New York Power Authority from
approving solar and wind on “land used in agricultural production”
unless the project was agrivoltaics, which means it allows simultaneous
farming of the property. The state legislature is now looking at
<a href="https://nysfocus.com/2024/04/05/transmission-renewable-energy-transition-new-york" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>additional
curbs</u></a> on siting projects in farmland as it considers new
permitting legislation.
</p>
<p>
Deanna Fox, head of the
<a href="https://nyfb.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>New
York Farm Bureau</u></a>, explained to me that her organization’s
bottom-up structure essentially means its positions are a consensus of
its grassroots farm worker membership. And those members really don’t
trust renewables to be safe for farmland.
</p>
<p>
“What happens when those solar arrays no longer work, or they become
antiquated? Or farmland loses its agricultural designation and becomes
zoned commercial? How does that impact ag districting in general? Does
that land just become commercial? Can it go back to being agricultural
land?” Fox asked. “If you were to talk to a group of farmers about
solar, I would guarantee none of them would say anything about the
emotional aspect of it. I don’t think that’s what it really is for them.
[And] if it’s emotional, it’s wrapped around the economics of it.”
</p>
<p>
Surveys of farmers have hinted that fears could be assuaged if
developers took steps to make their projects more harmonious with
agricultural work. As we reported last week, a
<a href="https://www.ssii.org/report-70-of-americas-farmers-open-to-solar-development/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>survey
by</u></a> the independent research arm of the Solar Energy Industries
Association found up to 70% of farmers they spoke with said they were
“open to large-scale solar” but many sought stipulations for dual usage
of the land for farming – a practice known as agrivoltaics.
</p>
<p>
Clearly, agrivoltaics and other simultaneous use strategies are what the
industry wants to promote. As we hit send on last week’s newsletter, I
was strolling around RE+, renewable energy’s largest U.S. industry
conference. Everywhere I turned, I found publicity around solar and
farming.
</p>
<p>
The Department of Energy even got in on the action. At the same time as
the conference, the department chose to announce a
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/articles/biden-harris-administration-invests-nearly-20-million-improve-siting-renewable-energy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>new
wave of financial prizes</u></a> for companies piloting simultaneous
solar energy and farming techniques.
</p>
<p>
“In areas where there has been a lot of loss of farmland to development,
solar is one more factor that I think has worried folks in some
communities,” Becca Jones-Albertus, director of DOE’s solar energy
technologies office, told me during an interview at the conference.
However agri-voltaics offer “a really exciting strategy because it
doesn’t make this an <em><em>either or</em></em>. It’s a <em><em>yes
and</em></em>.”
</p>
<p>
It remains to be seen whether these attempts at harmony will resolve any
of the discord.
</p>
<h2>
Grazing: Helpful or irrelevant?
</h2>
<p>
One industry practice being marketed to farm communities that folks hope
will soften opposition is sheep grazing at solar farms. At RE+, The
American Solar Grazing Association, an advocacy group,
<a href="https://www.grazinglands.org/events/solar-grazing-documentary-premiere-reception" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>debuted
a documentary</u></a> about the practice at the conference and had an
outdoor site outside the showroom with sheep chilling underneath solar
panel frames. The sheep display had a sign thanking sponsors including
AES, Arevon, BP, EDF Renewables, and Pivot Energy.
</p>
<p>
Some developers like Avangrid have found grazing to be a useful way to
mitigate physical project risks
<a href="https://www.avangrid.com/w/avangrid-begins-largest-solar-grazing-operation-in-the-pacific-northwest" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>at
solar farms</u></a> in the Pacific Northwest. Out in rural Oregon and
Washington, unkempt grasslands can present a serious fire risk. So after
trying other methods, Avangrid partnered with an Oregon rancher, Cameron
Krebs, who told me he understands why some farmers are skeptical about
developers coming into their neck of the woods.
</p>
<p>
“Culturally speaking, this is agricultural land. These are communities
that grow wheat and raise cattle. So my peers, when they put in the
solar farms and they see it going out of production, that really bothers
the community in general,” he said.
</p>
<p>
But Krebs doesn’t see solar farms with grazing the same way.
</p>
<p>
“It’s a retooling. It may not be corn production anymore. But we’re
still going to need a lot of resources. We’re still going to need tire
shops. I think there is a big fear that the solar companies will take
the land out of production and then the meat shops and the food
production would suffer because we don’t have that available on the
landscape, but I think we can have utility scale solar that is healthy
for our communities. And that really in my mind means honoring that soil
with good vegetation.”
</p>
<p>
It’s important to note, however, that grazing can’t really solve
renewables’ farmland problem. Often grazing is most helpful in dry
Western desert. Not to mention sheep aren’t representative of all
livestock – they’re a small percentage. And Heatmap Pro’s database has
found an important distinction between farms focused on crops versus
livestock — the latter isn’t as predisposed to oppose renewable energy.
</p>
<h2>
The uproar around Oak Run
</h2>
<p>
Ground zero for the future of renewables on farmland is Savion’s
proposed Oak Run project in Ohio, which at up to 800 megawatts of
generation capacity would be the state’s largest solar farm. The
developer also plans to let farmers plant and harvest crops in between
the solar arrays, making it the nation’s largest agri-voltaics site if
completed.
</p>
<p>
But Oak Run is still being opposed by nearby landowners and local
officials citing impacts to farmland. At Oak Run’s proposed site,
neighboring township governments have passed resolutions opposing
construction, as has
<a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/18052024/ohio-solar-projects-politics/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
county board of commissioners</u></a>, and town and county officials
sued to undo Oak Run’s approval at the Ohio Power Siting Board. Although
that lawsuit
<a href="https://opsb.ohio.gov/news/OPSB-approves-Oak-Run-Solar-Project+in-Madison-County" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>was
unsuccessful</u></a>, its backers want to take the matter to the state
Supreme Court.
</p>
<p>
Some of this might be tied to the pure fact Ohio is super hostile to
renewables right now. Over a third of counties in the state have
restricted or outright banned solar and wind projects, according to
Heatmap Pro’s database.
</p>
<p>
But there’s more at play here. The attorney representing town and county
officials is Jack Van Kley, a lawyer and former state government
official who remains based in Ohio and who has represented many farms in
court for myriad reasons. I talked to Van Kley last week for an hour
about why he opposes renewables projects (“they’re anything but clean in
my opinion”), his views on global warming (“I don’t get involved in the
dispute over climate change”) and a crucial fact that might sting: He
says at least roughly two thirds of his clientele are farmers or
communities reliant on agricultural businesses.
</p>
<p>
“It’s neighbor against neighbor in these communities,” he told me.
“You’ve got a relatively low number of farmers who want to lease their
land so that the solar companies can put solar panels on them for thirty
or forty years, and it’s just a few landowners that are profiting from
these projects.”
</p>
<p>
Van Kley spoke to a concern voiced by his clients I haven’t really heard
addressed by solar developers much: overall impacts to irrigation.
Specifically, he said an outsized concern among farmers is simply how
putting a solar or wind farm adjacent or close to their property will
impact how groundwater and surface water moves in the area, which can
impact somebody’s existing agricultural drainage infrastructure.
</p>
<p>
“If you do that next to another property that is being farmed, you’ll
kill the crop because you’ll flood the crop,” he claimed. “This is
turning out to be a big issue for farmers who are opposing these
facilities.”
</p>
<p>
Some have
<a href="https://www.cleveland.com/open/2023/07/this-lawyer-is-a-thorn-in-ohio-green-energys-side-whos-paying-the-bills.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>tried
to paint</u></a> Van Kley as funded or assisted by the fossil fuel lobby
or shadowy actors. Van Kley has denied any involvement in those kinds of
backroom dealings. While there’s glimpses of evidence
<a href="https://energynews.us/2024/08/26/connections-confirmed-between-grassroots-ohio-solar-opposition-and-dark-money-natural-gas-group/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>gas</u></a>
and
<a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/02/18/1154867064/solar-power-misinformation-activists-rural-america" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>coal
money</u></a> plays at least a minor role with other characters
fomenting opposition in the state, I really have no evidence of him
being one of these people right now. It’s much easier and simpler to
reason that he’s being paid by another influential sect – large
landowners, many of whom work in agriculture.
</p>
<p>
That’s the same conclusion John Boeckl reached. Boeckl, an Army
engineer, is one of the property owners leasing land for construction of
the Oak Run project. He supports Oak Run being built and has submitted
testimony in the legal challenge over its approvals. Though Boeckl
certainly wants to know more about who is funding the opposition and has
his gripes with neighbors who keep putting signs on his property that
say “no solar on prime farmland,” he hasn’t witnessed any corporate
skullduggery from shadowy outside entities.
</p>
<p>
“I think it’s just farmers being farmers,” he said. “They don’t want to
be told what to do with their land.”

<p>
<strong>1. Newport County, Rhode Island </strong>– I’ve learned that
climate activists in Rhode Island are now using local protests to oppose
NIMBYs who are challenging renewables projects.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
On Sept. 19, members of Climate Action Rhode Island – a
<a href="https://world.350.org/rhodeisland/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>local
offshoot of 350.org</u></a> – will be on the ground disrupting the
entrance to
<a href="https://www.discovernewport.org/blog/post/newport-mansions-wine-food-festival/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
lavish dinner</u></a> hosted by the Preservation Society of Newport
County, a wealthy architectural conservation group that sued federal
regulators over their approval of Eversource’s Revolution offshore wind
project.
</li>
<li>
As that lawsuit works its way through the courts, activists are using
local opposition to draw public attention to the Preservation Society
and portray it as an obstacle to progress on decarbonization with
op-eds, meetings, and now more protests.
</li>
<li>
Nick Horton of Climate Action Rhode Island told me that this public
awareness campaign may also target the TV network HBO, as its show “The
Gilded Age”
<a href="https://www.newportmansions.org/gilded-age/episode-deep-dive/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has
been filmed</u></a> at the Preservation Society’s historic mansions.
</li>
<li>
“I think broadly speaking the environmental movement really needs to
start organizing around the threat of NIMBYism, and needs to start
identifying these NIMBY organizations as prime bad actors in the
pushback against the renewable energy transition,” Horton said.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>2. Coos County, Oregon </strong>– The Confederated Tribes of the
Coos, Lower Umpqua, and Siuslaw Indians

</p>
<ul>
<li>
The tribes are opposing offshore wind for many of the same reasons
tribes in California and Washington state have fought against
development – impacting the viewshed could hinder tribal cultural
practices. This litigation also cites potential environmental impacts
and requests additional government analysis.
</li>
<li>
This lawsuit arrives as two coastal counties – Coos and Curry – will
<a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2024/08/07/coos-county-offshore-wind-development/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>vote

<strong>3. Polk County, Iowa </strong>– Landowners

Carbon Solutions CO2 pipeline and providing eminent domain authority,
the latest in a string of setbacks that has galvanized local opposition
from the midwest to the Dakotas.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Fresh off news of the lawsuit, Gevo – a sustainable aviation fuel
startup that plans to use the pipeline to transport its products – today
announced it acquired

</li>
<li>
I spoke with Gevo CEO Patrick Gruber last month about Summit and his
answer presaged this move: “When do we need a pipeline? Do I need it
tomorrow? Nope. I don’t need it until 2027, 2028, I have a lot of time
here. I don’t need it until then. I’ve got options, really. We have a
lot of game to play still.”
</li>
<li>
I’ll be watching for future developments in the Summit saga as well as
whether CO2 pipeline opposition is fueling local moratoria against solar
and wind as well.

<strong>4. Houston County, Georgia </strong>– One of Georgia’s largest
proposed solar projects has been rejected by a potential host county
over its potential impacts to bear habitat and property values.

<li>
The roughly 4,600-acre Silicon Ranch solar project would be built

residents, as well as recent legal challenges against other solar
projects and home value concerns.

Federal Reserve cuts key rate by sizable half-point, signaling end to
its inflation fight</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday cut its benchmark
interest rate by an unusually large half-point, a dramatic shift after
more than two years of high rates helped tame inflation but that also
made borrowing painfully expensive for American consumers.</p>
<p>The rate cut, the Fed’s first in more than four years, reflects its
new focus on bolstering the job market, which has shown clear signs of
slowing. Coming just weeks before the presidential election, the Fed’s
move also has the potential to scramble the economic landscape just as
Americans prepare to vote.</p>
<p>The central bank’s action lowered its key rate to roughly 4.8%, down
from a two-decade high of 5.3%, where it had stood for 14 months as it
struggled to curb the worst inflation streak in four decades. Inflation
has tumbled from a peak of 9.1% in mid-2022 to a three-year low of 2.5%
in August, not far above the Fed’s 2% target.</p>
<p>The Fed’s policymakers also signaled that they expect to cut their
key rate by an additional half-point in their final two meetings this
year, in November and December. And they envision four more rate cuts in
2025 and two in 2026.</p>
<p>In a statement, the Fed came closer than it has before to declaring
victory over inflation: It said it “has gained greater confidence that
inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%.”</p>
<p>Though the central bank now believes inflation is largely defeated,
many Americans remain upset with still-high prices for groceries, gas,
rent and other necessities. Former President Donald Trump blames the
Biden-Harris administration for sparking an inflationary surge. Vice
President Kamala Harris, in turn, has charged that Trump’s promise to
slap tariffs on all imports would raise prices for consumers even
further.</p>
<p>Rate cuts by the Fed should, over time, lower borrowing costs for
mortgages, auto loans and credit cards, boosting Americans’ finances and
supporting more spending and growth. Homeowners will be able to
refinance mortgages at lower rates, saving on monthly payments, and even
shift credit card debt to lower-cost personal loans or home equity
lines. Businesses may also borrow and invest more.</p>
<p>Average mortgage rates have already dropped to an 18-month low of
6.2%, according to Freddie Mac, spurring a jump in demand for
refinancings.</p>
<p>The Fed’s next policy meeting is Nov. 6-7 — immediately after the
presidential election. By cutting rates this week, soon before the
election, the Fed is risking attacks from Trump, who has argued that
lowering rates now amounts to political interference. Yet Politico has
reported that even some key Senate Republicans who were interviewed have
expressed support for a Fed rate cut this week.</p>
<p>The central bank’s officials fought against high inflation by raising
their key rate 11 times in 2022 and 2023. Wage growth has since slowed,
removing a potential source of inflationary pressure. And oil and gas
prices are falling, a sign that inflation should continue to cool in the
months ahead. Consumers are also pushing back against high prices,
forcing such companies as Target and McDonald’s to dangle deals and
discounts.</p>
<p>Yet after several years of strong job growth, employers have slowed
hiring, and the unemployment rate has risen nearly a full percentage
point from its half-century low in April 2023 to a still-low 4.2%. Once
unemployment rises that much, it tends to keep climbing. Fed officials
and many economists note, though, that the rise in unemployment this
time largely reflects an influx of people seeking jobs — notably new
immigrants and recent college graduates — rather than layoffs.</p>
<p>At issue in the Fed’s deliberations is how fast it wants to lower its
benchmark rate to a point where it’s no longer acting as a brake on the
economy — nor as an accelerant. Where that so-called “neutral” level
falls isn’t clear, though many analysts peg it at 3% to 3.5%.</p>

<strong>Tariffs time, baby</strong> – All eyes are on the U.S. Trade
Representative after the Biden administration
<a href="https://electrek.co/2024/09/13/us-100-tariffs-on-chinese-evs-will-begin-this-month/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>locked
in</u></a> 100% tariffs on Chinese electric vehicle imports effective in
a week and a half, and
<a href="https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/Section%20301%20Modifications%20Determination%20FRN%20(Sept%2012%202024)%20(FINAL).pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>determined
up next</u></a> are a 50% tariff on solar cells and 25% tariff on steel,
aluminum, EV batteries and transition metals.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Before the duty news came down, walking around RE+ last week, I was
honestly surprised at the sheer number of Chinese manufacturers with
convention showroom booths, from EV company BYD to companies like Gotion
that have riled up lawmakers in D.C. It was a charm offensive.
</li>
<li>
If Ford executives
<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ford-ceo-cfo-left-shocked-after-chinese-ev-test-drive-2024-9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>are
to be believed</u></a>, China could still play a role in the future of
the U.S. automotive industry. But that being said, I have my doubts U.S.
trade policy will change on EV and solar supply chains given the big
lobbying spend from domestic manufacturers and mining companies in
Washington.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Permit time, time permitting </strong>– Lots of hay is being
made of permitting reform back in D.C., where congressional Republicans
have revived legislative efforts to overhaul the National Environmental
Policy Act and Endangered Species Act.

<ul>
<li>
Action lately has largely taken place in the House Natural Resources
Committee, which oversees land use issues. The committee held a
<a href="https://naturalresources.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=416501" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>hearing
on legislation</u></a> to modify NEPA implementation last week. Its
chair Bruce Westerman also introduced legislation that would
<a href="https://newhouse.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/newhouse-esa-reform-bill-protects-species-and-landowners" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>change
federal species preservation</u></a>.
</li>
<li>
These bills go much further than the bipartisan permitting compromise
reached in the Senate, which focuses on judicial review, fossil fuel
leasing, and renewable energy timelines.
</li>
<li>
I’ll say this with all the painful confidence of someone who covered
Congress for far too long: some centrists have applauded the bills but
they’re DOA – especially if Kamala Harris wins the November presidential
election. That’s simply because the math for radically changing NEPA
just isn’t there, and doubly so for wildlife protection law.

Dresselhuys, CEO of ESS, Makes the Case for Iron-Flow Batteries</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-18, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzY0NDMyNi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1NTk0NDk3OH0.Y4GDr1B00pPzFM-Mj61RMK1jjKzN1WsjjCDareyDnPg/image.jpg?width=900&height=410&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
While in Anaheim for RE+ last week, I met with Eric Dresselhuys, CEO of
long duration iron-flow battery storage manufacturer ESS Inc. We chatted
about battery fires, community buy-in, and the future of China policy. I
came in expecting optimism and left feeling we need a lot more
conversations like this one.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The following is an abridged version of our conversation that has been
edited for clarity.
</p>
<p>
<strong>How does your product address the opinion that battery storage
has a buy-in problem? </strong>
</p>
<p>
It’s not so much an opinion as just reporting the obvious, which is that
lithium-ion batteries on the grid have a buy-in problem. Maybe if you’re
in rural western Australia nobody cares because there are no human
beings around, but if you look at the need for energy storage to
facilitate the energy transition, it’s pretty clear we have to put
batteries all over the place and specifically close to where human
beings live. And that’s a problem.
</p>
<p>
Can iron-flow help solve that problem? I think unequivocally we can.
It’s a very different architecture. It’s a battery that’s really
designed from the beginning to operate as a grid backup battery. If you
go back to look at lithium, it was never designed to go onto the grid.
It was designed to go into camcorders, phones. This is not the
technology I think anybody would’ve picked for the grid if they had
started from scratch.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Are you seeing any change in demand for your product from
protests over lithium battery projects? </strong>
</p>
<p>
I think it’s the old gag of <em><em>all politics are local</em></em>.
The politics of siting is a local problem. What’s simultaneously true is
adoption of storage on the grid is growing at a phenomenally high rate.
And yet there are stories [about opposition] all over the place. There
was just one up in Marin County, California, where the
<a href="https://www.marinij.com/2023/03/13/marin-battery-storage-project-sparks-early-opposition/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>community
said</u></a> it’s in an area adjacent to wetlands. And they said you
know what? We’re just not going to put a–
</p>
<p>
<strong>But are these communities opposed to lithium storage actually
choosing iron-flow over these projects, or are they just saying no to
any development? </strong>
</p>
<p>
Right now, they’re just saying no. The communities are not going to
solve the problem. They’re going to tell you what is unacceptable and
it’s going to be somebody else’s job to solve the problem.
</p>
<p>
I’ll use
<a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/iron-flow-battery-ess-schiphol-airport-technology-startup" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Schiphol
Airport in Amsterdam</u></a> [as an example]. They said, <em><em>we have
thousands of gallons of jet fuel laying around. And people. And
airplanes. We can’t put a lithium battery out here. </em></em>So they’re
using an iron-flow and sought out a non-lithium battery to solve their
energy storage problems because it was safer.
</p>
<p>
<strong>China policy looms large over the future of U.S. battery
supplies. What do you think the final endgame will be of our approach to
China’s dominance in this business segment? </strong>
</p>
<p>
It’s a great question that I don’t think I know the answer to. I think
the next step is to try and get the playing field somewhat level. The
amount of subsidy that goes into renewables in general and batteries in
particular in China is daunting. People talk about the IRA and all these
things as if it’s a lot of money, but it’s a pittance compared to what
China is putting in.
</p>
<p>
Getting the playing field a little more level in the short term through
a combination of incentives here and tariffs coming on will be a next
step. Until we get carbon accounting — cradle-to-grave carbon accounting
— it’ll be hard to get things totally level because in the U.S. we
enforce environmental laws and we don’t employ prison labor to build
[these] things. Until we get that full ESG accounting, I think there’s
going to be some limitation.

The LincStation N1 is a Network Attached Storage (NAS) device from a
company called LincPlus. But it is different from most recent
consumer-oriented NAS systems, in that it’s not just a plain-looking box
designed to hold a few hard drives and run a proprietary operating
system. Instead, it’s a small and sleek looking NAS with […]

id="sean-diddy-combs-makes-fresh-bid-for-bail-in-sex-trafficking-conspiracy-case">Sean
‘Diddy’ Combs makes fresh bid for bail in sex trafficking, conspiracy
case</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — Lawyers for Sean “Diddy” Combs asked a judge Wednesday to
let him await his sex trafficking trial at his luxury home on an island
near Miami Beach, rather than a grim federal jail in Brooklyn. </p>
<p>Combs’ lawyers offered a $50 million bail package — using his mansion
as collateral — in exchange for releasing him to home detention with GPS
monitoring. A hearing on the request was scheduled for Wednesday
afternoon. On Tuesday, a U.S. magistrate judge in Manhattan ordered
Combs held without bail. </p>
<p>The hip-hop mogul whose career blossomed in the 1990s was arrested on
Monday on charges contained in an indictment that accuses Combs of using
his “power and prestige” for “sex trafficking, forced labor, interstate
transportation for purposes of prostitution, drug offenses, kidnapping,
arson, bribery and obstruction of justice.” </p>
<p>It describes the inducement of female victims and male sex workers
into drugged-up, elaborately produced sexual performances dubbed “Freak
Offs” that Combs arranged, directed, masturbated during and often
recorded. The events would sometimes last days and require IVs to
recover from, the indictment said. </p>
<p>It alleges he coerced and abused women for years while using
blackmail, including the videos he shot, and shocking acts of violence
to keep his victims in line, coordinated and facilitated from the top
down by a network of associates and employees. </p>
<p>Combs’ attorney Marc Agnifilo submitted a letter to Judge Andrew L.
Carter on Wednesday seeking the release of Combs, 54, on conditions
including home detention with GPS monitoring, along with a restriction
on all visitors to his residences except for family, property caretakers
and friends who are not considered co-conspirators. </p>
<p>Combs’ house is on Star Island, a man-made dollop of land in Biscayne
Bay, reachable only by a causeway or boat. It is among the most
expensive places to live in the United States. Combs’ request echoes
that of a long line of wealthy defendants who have offered to pay
multimillion-dollar bails in exchange for home detention in luxurious
surroundings. </p>
<p>“Sean Combs has never evaded, avoided, eluded or run from a challenge
in his life,” the defense said in a court filing. “He will not start
now.” </p>
<p>Combs was expected to reenter his not guilty plea in his initial
appearance before Carter. </p>
<p>So far, prosecutors have successfully argued that he is a danger to
the community and a flight risk and should remain incarcerated until
trial. </p>
<p>For all the revelations that came with the unsealing of the
indictment Tuesday, most of what it outlines had been described in a
November lawsuit filed by his former longtime girlfriend and protege,
the R&amp;B singer Cassie, whose legal name is Cassandra Ventura. The
suit was settled the following day, but its allegations have followed
Combs since. </p>
<p>Its descriptions of beatings, sexual assaults, silencing tactics and
“Freak Offs” were echoed throughout the criminal indictment, though it
did not use her name or the names of any other women. </p>
<p>Agnifilo, also without naming Ventura but clearly referring to her,
argued at Tuesday’s arraignment that the entire criminal case is an
outgrowth of one long-term, troubled-but-consensual relationship that
faltered amid infidelity. </p>
<p>The “Freak Offs,” Agnifilo contended, were an expansion of that
relationship, and not coercive. </p>
<p>“Is it sex trafficking?” Agnifilo asked. “Not if everybody wants to
be there.” </p>
<p>Prosecutors, however, portrayed the scope as far larger. They said in
court papers that they had interviewed more than 50 victims and
witnesses and expect the number to grow. </p>
<p>Like many aging hip-hop figures — including many of those he beefed
with in the bicoastal rap feuds of the 1990s alongside the Notorious
B.I.G. — the Bad Boy Records founder Combs had established a gentler,
more worldly public image. The doting father of seven children was a
respected international businessman, whose annual “White Party” in the
Hamptons was once a must-have invitation for the jet-setting elite. </p>
<p>But prosecutors said he used the same companies, people and methods
he used to build his business and cultural power to facilitate his
crimes. They said they would prove it with financial, travel and billing
records, electronic data and communications and videos of the “Freak
Offs” to prove their case. </p>
<p>The AP does not typically name people who say they have been sexually
abused unless they come forward publicly, as Ventura did. </p>
<p>Combs was arrested late Monday in a Manhattan hotel, roughly six
months after federal authorities raided his luxurious homes in Los
Angeles and Miami and revealed they were conducting a sex trafficking
investigation. </p>
<p>During the searches, law enforcement seized narcotics, videos of the
“Freak Offs” and more than 1,000 bottles of baby oil and lubricant,
according to prosecutors. They said agents also seized firearms and
ammunition, including three AR-15s with defaced serial numbers. </p>
<p>The indictment portrays Combs as so violent that he caused injuries
that often took days or weeks to heal. His employees and associates
sometimes witnessed his violence and kept victims from leaving or
tracked down those who tried, the indictment said. </p>
<p>A conviction on every charge in the indictment would require a
mandatory 15 years in prison with the possibility of a life
sentence. </p>
<p>Combs and his attorneys denied similar allegations made by others in
a string of lawsuits filed after Ventura’s.</p>

reports of explosives found in car near Trump rally spread online</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — Law enforcement officials on Long Island worked quickly on
Wednesday to publicly knock down social media posts falsely reporting
that explosives had been found in a car near former President Donald
Trump’s planned rally in New York.</p>
<p>The false reports of an explosive began circulating hours before the
Republican presidential nominee’s campaign event at Nassau Coliseum in
Uniondale, just days after he was apparently the target of a second
possible assassination attempt.</p>
<p>Nassau County Police Commissioner Patrick Ryder said police
questioned and detained a person who “may have been training a bomb
detection dog,” near the site of the rally and “falsely reported
explosives being found.”</p>
<p>Lt. Scott Skrynecki, a spokesperson for the county police, said in
follow-up messages that the person, who police have not yet identified,
was a civilian and not a member of a law enforcement agency.</p>
<p>He also said the person was not working at or affiliated with the
event, which is expected to draw thousands of Trump supporters to the
arena that was formerly the home of the NHL’s New York Islanders.</p>
<p>The rally is Trump’s first on Long Island, a suburban area just east
of New York City, since 2017.</p>
<p>In 2020, President Joe Biden defeated Trump by a roughly 4% margin on
Long Island, besting him in Nassau County by about 60,000 votes, though
Trump carried neighboring Suffolk County by more than 200 votes.</p>
<p>Earlier Wednesday, Skrynecki and other county officials responded
swiftly to knock down the online line claims, which appear to have
started with a post from a reporter citing unnamed sources in the local
police department.</p>
<p>The claims were then shared widely on X, formerly Twitter, by a
number of prominent accounts, including that of the company’s owner,
Elon Musk, which has nearly 200 million followers. Spokespersons for X
didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment.</p>
<p>“False,” Skrynecki texted the AP as the claims spread.</p>
<p>“No. Ridiculous. Zero validity,” said Christopher Boyle, spokesperson
for Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman.</p>

<h2 id="boeing-to-start-temporary-furloughs-amid-seattle-strike">Boeing
to start temporary furloughs amid Seattle strike</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — Boeing said Wednesday it would start temporary furloughs
of professional and white-collar staff as it seeks to conserve cash amid
a labor strike that has shuttered Seattle manufacturing plants.</p>
<p>The furloughs, which pertain to executives, managers and workers,
will be initiated in the coming days and affect tens of thousands of
Boeing employees, company officials said.</p>
<p>Boeing plans for “selected employees to take one week of furlough
every four weeks on a rolling basis for the duration of the strike,”
said a message to employees from CEO Kelly Ortberg.</p>
<p>The new Boeing boss added that he and the rest of the leadership team
“will take a commensurate pay reduction for the duration of the
strike.”</p>
<p>Boeing had said that furloughs were on the table earlier in the week
when it announced a hiring freeze, travel budget austerity measures and
a reduction of supplier expenditures.</p>
<p>About 33,000 Seattle-area Boeing workers with the International
Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 751 walked off
the job Friday after overwhelmingly rejecting a contract renewal.</p>
<p>The two sides resumed talks Tuesday with the assistance of mediators
from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service.</p>
<p>The IAM blasted Boeing in a bargaining update posted late
Tuesday.</p>
<p>“We are frustrated,” the IAM said. “The company was not prepared and
was unwilling to address the issues you’ve made clear are essential for
ending this strike: Wages and Pension. The company doesn’t seem to be
taking mediation seriously.”</p>
<p>Ortberg’s message to employees reiterated his commitment to
“resetting our relationship with our represented employees and
continuing discussions with the union to reach a new agreement that is
good for all of our teammates and our company as soon as possible.”</p>

id="two-years-after-mahsa-amini-death-western-allies-sanction-a-dozen-iranian-officials">Two
years after Mahsa Amini death, Western allies sanction a dozen Iranian
officials</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The U.S., Canada and Australia hit a group of Iranian
officials with sanctions Wednesday for their participation in
suppressing protests and detaining people in relation to the death of
Mahsa Amini, an Iranian woman who died in the custody of Iran’s morality
police two years ago for improperly wearing a mandatory headscarf.</p>
<p>Amini, 22, died on Sept. 16, 2022, in a hospital after being arrested
for allegedly not wearing her mandatory headscarf, or hijab, to the
liking of the authorities. Her death sparked nationwide protests against
the country’s hijab laws and its ruling theocracy.</p>
<p>Included in Wednesday’s sanctions are a dozen officials accused of
killing and detaining protesters, suppressing protests in 2019 and 2022
and arresting journalists.</p>
<p>The country’s new reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian campaigned on
a promise to halt the harassment of women by morality police. Still,
since Amini’s death, videos have emerged of women and girls being
roughed up by officers.</p>
<p>In 2023, a teenage Iranian girl was injured in a mysterious incident
on Tehran’s Metro while not wearing a headscarf and later died in the
hospital. In July, activists say police opened fire on a woman fleeing a
checkpoint in an attempt to avoid her car being impounded for her not
wearing the hijab.</p>
<p>U.S. Treasury official Bradley T. Smith said, “Despite the Iranian
people’s peaceful calls for reform, Iran’s leaders have doubled down on
the regime’s well-worn tactics of violence and coercion.” The U.S. and
its allies “will continue to take action to expose and hold accountable
those responsible for carrying out the Iranian regime’s cruel agenda,”
Smith said.</p>
<p>The sanctions, which block access to U.S. property and bank accounts
and prevent the targeted people and companies from doing business with
the U.S. are largely symbolic since many of the individuals do not
interact with the U.S.</p>
<p>In March, a United Nations fact-finding mission determined that Iran
is responsible for the “physical violence” that led to the death of
Amini. It also found that the Islamic Republic employed “unnecessary and
disproportionate use of lethal force” to put down the demonstrations
that erupted following Amini’s death and that Iranian security forces
sexually assaulted detainees.</p>
<p>Increasingly, on the streets of Iranian cities, it’s becoming more
common to see a woman passing by without a mandatory headscarf.</p>

<h2 id="us-targets-second-major-chinese-hacking-group">US targets second
major Chinese hacking group</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The United States has identified and taken down a botnet
campaign by China-directed hackers to further infiltrate American
infrastructure as well as a variety of internet-connected devices.</p>
<p>FBI Director Christopher Wray announced the disruption of what he
called Flax Typhoon during a cyber summit Wednesday in Washington,
describing it as part of a much larger campaign by Beijing.</p>
<p>“Flax Typhoon hijacked Internet-of-Things devices like cameras, video
recorders and storage devices — things typically found across both big
and small organizations,” Wray said. “And about half of those hijacked
devices were located here in the U.S.”</p>
<p>Wray said the hackers, working under the guise of an information
security company called the Integrity Technology Group, collected
information from corporations, media organizations, universities and
government agencies.</p>
<p>“They used internet-connected devices — this time, hundreds of
thousands of them — to create a botnet that helped them compromise
systems and exfiltrate confidential data,” he said.</p>
<p>But Flax Typhoon’s operations were disrupted last week when the FBI,
working with allies and under court orders, took control of the botnet
and pursued the hackers when they tried to switch to a backup
system.</p>
<p>“We think the bad guys finally realized that it was the FBI and our
partners that they were up against,” Wray said. “And with that
realization, they essentially burned down their new infrastructure and
abandoned their botnet.”</p>
<p>Wray said Flax Typhoon appeared to build on the exploits and tactics
of another China-linked hacking group, known as Volt Typhoon, which was
identified by Microsoft in May of last year.</p>
<p>Volt Typhoon used office network equipment, including routers,
firewalls and VPN hardware, to infiltrate and disrupt communications
infrastructure in Guam, home to key U.S. military facilities.</p>
<p>The Chinese Embassy in Washington Wednesday rejected the U.S
accusations.</p>
<p>“Without valid evidence, the U.S. jumped to an unwarranted conclusion
and made groundless accusations” Chinese Embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu
told VOA in an email, responding to the allegations about Flax
Typhoon.</p>
<p>“The U.S. itself is the origin and the biggest perpetrator of
cyberattacks,” Liu added. “We urge the U.S. to stop its worldwide cyber
espionage and cyberattacks, and stop smearing other countries under the
excuse of cyber security.”</p>
<p>The FBI and the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency
have previously warned that Chinese-government directed hackers, like
Volt Typhoon, have been positioning themselves to launch destructive
cyberattacks that could jeopardize the physical safety of Americans.</p>
<p>Following Wednesday’s announcement by the FBI, the U.S. National
Security Agency (NSA) issued an advisory encouraging anyone with a
device that was compromised by Flax Typhoon to apply needed patches.</p>
<p>It said that as of this past June, the Flax Typhoon botnet was making
use of more than 260,000 devices in North America, Europe, Africa and
Southeast East.</p>
<p>The NSA said almost half of the compromised devices were in the U.S.
Another 18 countries, including Vietnam, Bangladesh, Albania, China,
South Africa and India, were also impacted.</p>

Justice Department sues over Baltimore bridge collapse and seeks $100
million in cleanup costs</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BALTIMORE — The U.S. Justice Department on Wednesday sued the owner
and manager of the cargo ship that caused the Baltimore bridge collapse,
seeking to recover more than $100 million that the government spent to
clear the underwater debris and reopen the city’s port. </p>
<p>The lawsuit filed in Maryland alleges that the electrical and
mechanical systems on the ship, the Dali, were improperly maintained,
causing it to lose power and veer off course before striking a support
column on the Francis Scott Key Bridge in March. </p>
<p>“This tragedy was entirely avoidable,” according to the lawsuit. </p>
<p>The collapse snarled commercial shipping traffic through the Port of
Baltimore for months before the channel was fully opened in June. </p>
<p>“With this civil claim, the Justice Department is working to ensure
that the costs of clearing the channel and reopening the Port of
Baltimore are borne by the companies that caused the crash, not by the
American taxpayer,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said in written
statement. </p>
<p>The case was filed against Dali owner Grace Ocean Private Ltd. and
manager Synergy Marine Group, both of Singapore. The companies filed a
court petition days after the collapse seeking to limit their legal
liability in what could become the most expensive marine casualty case
in history. </p>
<p>The ship was leaving Baltimore bound for Sri Lanka when its steering
failed because of the power loss. Six members of a road work crew on the
bridge were killed in the collapse. The men were working an overnight
shift filling potholes on the bridge deck when it suddenly crumbled
beneath them, sending them tumbling into the water. </p>
<p>“This accident happened because of the careless and grossly negligent
decisions made by Grace Ocean and Synergy, who recklessly chose to send
an unseaworthy vessel to navigate a critical waterway and ignored the
risks to American lives and the nation’s infrastructure,” said Chetan
Patil, the acting deputy assistant attorney general. </p>
<p>On Tuesday, the victims’ families declared their intent to file a
claim seeking to hold the ship’s owner and manager fully liable for the
disaster. Several other interested parties, including city officials and
local businesses, have filed opposing claims accusing the companies of
negligence. </p>
<p>The families are also calling for more robust workplace protections,
especially for immigrant workers. All the victims were Latino immigrants
who came to the United States in search of better-paying jobs and
opportunities.</p>

renewals online</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Americans can now renew their passports online,
bypassing a cumbersome mail-in paper application process that often
caused delays.</p>
<p>The U.S. State Department announced Wednesday that its online
passport renewal system is now fully operational.</p>
<p>“By offering this online alternative to the traditional paper
application process, the Department is embracing digital transformation
to offer the most efficient and convenient passport renewal experience
possible,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement.</p>
<p>After staffing shortages caused mainly by the COVID-19 pandemic
resulted in lengthy passport processing delays, the department ramped up
hiring and introduced other technological improvements that have reduced
wait times by about one-third over last year. It says most applications
are now completed in far less than the advertised six to eight weeks.
The online renewal system is expected to further reduce that.</p>
<p>The system will allow renewal applicants to skip the current process,
which requires them to print out and send paper applications and a check
by mail and submit their documents and payment through a secure website,

chipmaking business</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-18, from: OS News</p>
<p>Intel’s woes are far from over. Pat Gelsinger, the company’s CEO, has
announced that Intel’s chipmaking business will be spun off and turned
into a separate company. A subsidiary structure will unlock important
benefits. It provides our external foundry customers and suppliers with
clearer separation and independence from the rest of Intel. Importantly,
it also gives us future flexibility to evaluate independent sources of
funding and optimize the capital structure of each business to maximize
growth and shareholder value creation. There is no change to our Intel
Foundry leadership team, which continues to report to me. We will also
establish an operating board that includes independent directors to
govern the subsidiary. This supports our continued focus on driving
greater transparency, optimization and accountability across the
business. ↫ Pat Gelsinger This is a big move, and illustrated the
difficulties Intel is facing. Its foundry business lost $7 billion last
year, and it’s cutting 15% of its workforce – 15000 people – indicating
it needs to do something to turn the ship around. Intel is also pausing
construction on two additional plants in Europe, but will continue its
expansion efforts in the United States. Bitter note is that Intel
received a massive cash injection from the US Biden administration, yet
then proceeds to fire 15000 people. Socialism for the rich, capitalism
for the poor.</p>

wins challenge against $1.66B EU antitrust fine</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BRUSSELS — Alphabet unit Google won its challenge on Wednesday
against a $1.66 billion antitrust fine imposed five years ago for
hindering rivals in online search advertising, a week after it lost a
much bigger case. </p>
<p>The European Commission, in its 2019 decision, said Google had abused
its dominance to prevent websites from using brokers other than its
AdSense platform that provided search adverts. The practices it said
were illegal took place from 2006 to 2016.</p>
<p>The Luxembourg-based General Court mostly agreed with the European
Union competition enforcer’s assessments of the case, but annulled the
fine.</p>
<p>“The court […] upheld most of the commission’s assessments, but
annulled the decision imposing a fine of almost 1.5 billion euros [$1.66
billion] on Google, on the grounds in particular that it had failed to
take into account all the relevant circumstances in its assessment of
the duration of the contractual clauses that it had found to be unfair,”
the judges said.</p>
<p>The AdSense fine, one of a trio of fines that have cost Google a
total of some $9 billion, was triggered by a complaint from Microsoft in
2010.</p>
<p>Google has said it changed the targeted contracts in 2016 before the
Commission’s decision.</p>
<p>The company last week lost its final fight against a $2.6 billion
fine levied for using its price comparison shopping service to gain an
unfair advantage over smaller European rivals.</p>

Geothermal is getting closer to the big time. Last week, Fervo Energy —
arguably the country’s leading enhanced geothermal company —
<a href="https://fervoenergy.com/fervo-energys-record-breaking-production-results-showcase-rapid-scale-up-of-enhanced-geothermal/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>announced</u></a>
that its Utah demonstration project had achieved record production
capacity. The new approach termed “enhanced geothermal,” which borrows
drilling techniques and expertise from the oil and gas industry, seems
poised to become a big player on America’s clean, 24/7 power grid of the
future.
</p>
<p>
Why is geothermal so hot? How soon could it appear on the grid — and why
does it have advantages that other zero-carbon technologies don’t? On
this week’s episode of Shift Key, Rob and Jesse speak with a
practitioner and an expert in the world of enhanced geothermal.

Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Robinson Meyer:</strong> I just wanted to hit a different note
here, which is, Sarah, you’ve alluded a few times to your past in the
oil and gas industry. I think this is true across Fervo, is that of
course, the technologies we’re discussing here are fracking derived.
What has your background in the oil and gas industry and hydrocarbons
taught you that you think about at Fervo now, and developing geothermal
as a resource?<br/> <br/> <strong>Sarah Jewett:</strong> There are so
many things. I mean, I’m thinking about my time in the oil and gas
industry daily. And you’re exactly right, I think today about 60% of
Fervo’s employees come from the oil and gas industry. And because we are
only just about to start construction on our first power facility, the
percentage of contractors and field workers from the oil and gas
industry is much higher than 60%.<br/> <br/> <strong>Jesse Jenkins:
</strong>Right, you can’t go and hire a bunch of people with geothermal
experience when there is no large-scale geothermal industry to pull
from.<br/> <br/> <strong>Jewett: </strong>That’s right. That’s right.
And so the oil and gas industry, I think, has taught us, so many
different types of things. I mean, we can’t really exist without
thinking about the history of the oil and gas industry — even, you know,
Wilson and I are sort of comparing our learning rates to learning rates
observed in various different oil and gas basins by different operators,
so you can see a lot of prior technological pathways.<br/> <br/> I mean,
first off, we’re just using off the shelf technology that has been
proven and tested in the oil and gas industry over the last 25 years,
which has been, really, the reason why geothermal is able to have this
big new unlock, because we’re using all of this off the shelf technology
that now exists. It’s not like the early 2000s, where there was a single
bit we could have tried. Now there are a ton of different bits that are
available to us that we can try and say, how is this working? How is
<em><em>this</em></em> working? How’s this working?<br/> <br/> So I
think, from a technological perspective, it’s helpful. And then from
just an industry that has set a solid example it’s been really helpful,
and that can be leveraged in a number of different ways. Learning rates,
for example; how to set up supply chains in remote areas, for example;
how to engage with and interact with communities. I think we’ve seen
examples of oil and gas doing that well and doing it poorly. And I’ve
gotten to observe firsthand the oil and gas industry doing it well and
doing it poorly.<br/> <br/> And so I’ve gotten to learn a lot about how
we need to treat those around us, explain to them what it is that we’re
doing, how open we need to be. And I think that has been immensely
helpful as we’ve crafted the role that we’re going to play in these
communities at large.<br/> <br/> <strong>Wilson Ricks: </strong>I think
it’s also interesting to talk about the connection to the oil and gas
industry from the perspective of the political economy of the energy
transition, specifically because you hear policymakers talk all the time
about retraining workers from these legacy industries that, if we’re
serious about decarbonizing, will unavoidably have to contract — and,
you know, getting those people involved in clean energy, in these new
industries.<br/> <br/> And often that’s taking drillers and retraining
some kind of very different job — or coal miners — into battery
manufacturers. This is almost exactly one to one. Like Sarah said,
there’s additional expertise and experience that you need to get really
good at doing this in the geothermal context. But for the most part, you
are taking the exact same skills and just reapplying them, and so it
allows for both a potentially very smooth transition of workforces, and
also it allows for scale-up of enhanced geothermal to proceed much more
smoothly than it potentially would if you had to kind of train an entire
workforce from scratch to just do this.

<h2 id="iconic-us-container-firm-tupperware-files-for-bankruptcy">Iconic
US container firm Tupperware files for bankruptcy</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Tupperware Brands and some of its subsidiaries filed for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Tuesday, the food container firm said
in a statement.</p>
<p>The company, known for its trademark food storage containers, has
been hit by dwindling sales in recent years.</p>
<p>Last year the New York Stock Exchange-listed firm warned of
“substantial doubt” about its ability to keep operating in light of its
poor financial position.</p>
<p>“Over the last several years, the company’s financial position has
been severely impacted by the challenging macroeconomic environment,”
president and CEO Laurie Ann Goldman said in a statement announcing the
bankruptcy filing.</p>
<p>“As a result, we explored numerous strategic options and determined
this is the best path forward,” added Goldman.</p>
<p>The company said it would seek court approval for a sale process for
the business to protect its brand and “further advance Tupperware’s
transformation into a digital-first, technology-led company.”</p>
<p>The Orlando, Florida-based firm said it would also seek approval to
continue operating during bankruptcy proceedings and would continue to
pay its employees and suppliers.</p>
<p>“We plan to continue serving our valued customers with the
high-quality products they love and trust throughout this process,”
Goldman said.</p>
<p>The firm’s shares were trading at $0.5099 Monday, well down from
$2.55 in December last year.</p>
<p>Tupperware said it had implemented a strategic plan to modernize its
operations and drive efficiencies to ignite growth following the
appointment of a new management team last year.</p>
<p>“The company has made significant progress and intends to continue
this important transformation work.”</p>
<p>In its filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of
Delaware, Tupperware listed assets of between $500 million and $1
billion and liabilities of between $1 billion and $10 billion.</p>
<p>The filing also said it had between 50,000 and 100,000 creditors.</p>
<p>Tupperware, whose name became synonymous with its airtight plastic
containers, in recent years lost popularity with consumers and an
initiative to gain distribution through big-box chain store Target
failed to reverse its fortunes.</p>
<p>The company’s roots date to 1946, when chemist Earl Tupper “had a
spark of inspiration while creating molds at a plastics factory shortly
after the Great Depression,” according to Tupperware’s website.</p>
<p>“If he could design an airtight seal for plastic storage containers,
like those on a paint can, he could help war-weary families save money
on costly food waste.”</p>
<p>Over time, Tupper’s hermetically sealed plastic containers also
became associated with “Tupperware Parties,” where friends would gather
with food and drink as a company representative demonstrated the
items.</p>

id="us-decision-on-nippon-bid-for-us-steel-pushed-to-after-election-sources-say">US
decision on Nippon bid for US Steel pushed to after election, sources
say</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON/TOKYO — The U.S. national security panel reviewing Nippon
Steel’s $14.9 billion bid for U.S. Steel let the companies refile their
application for approval of the deal, a person familiar with the matter
said, delaying a decision on the politically sensitive merger until
after the Nov. 5 presidential election.</p>
<p>The move offers a ray of hope for the companies, whose proposed
tie-up appeared set to be blocked when the Committee on Foreign
Investment in the United States (CFIUS) alleged on Aug. 31 the
transaction posed a risk to national security by threatening the steel
supply chain for critical U.S. industries.</p>
<p>CFIUS needs more time to understand the deal’s impact on national
security and engage with the parties, the person said on Tuesday.
Refiling sets a new 90-day clock to review the proposed tie-up and make
a decision.</p>
<p>The review was expected to take close to the full 90 days, another
person familiar with the matter said.</p>
<p>Nippon Steel declined to comment. CFIUS and U.S. Steel did not
immediately respond to requests for comment from Reuters.</p>
<p>“Extending the timeline takes pressure off the parties and,
importantly, pushes the decision past the election in November,” said
Nick Klein, a CFIUS lawyer with DLA Piper.</p>
<p>The deal has become a political hot potato. This month, Vice
President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, said at a
rally in Pennsylvania, the swing state where U.S. Steel is
headquartered, that she wants U.S. Steel to remain “American owned and
operated,” echoing a view held by President Joe Biden.</p>
<p>The White House reiterated that position on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Harris’ Republican rival Donald Trump has pledged to block the deal
if elected. Both candidates have sought to woo union votes.</p>
<p>Postponing the decision to after the U.S. elections will “dial down”
the political temperature but does not guarantee approval, said David
Boling, a former U.S. trade official who is now an analyst at Eurasia
Group.</p>
<p>“Regardless of the CFIUS review, Nippon Steel still must reach an
agreement with the United Steelworkers,” Boling said. “Without that,
it’s very hard to see this deal happening.”</p>
<p>The United Steelworkers Union, which vehemently opposes the deal,
said on Tuesday “nothing has changed regarding the risks that Nippon’s
acquisition would pose to national security or the critical supply chain
concerns that have already been identified.”</p>
<p>The deal is being closely watched in Japan, a close U.S. ally and its
biggest foreign investor.</p>
<p>“Further strengthening economic relations, including expanding mutual
investment between Japan and the U.S., are essential for both
countries,” Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Moriya told reporters
on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Nippon Steel shares were up 1.1% in afternoon trading in Tokyo. U.S.
Steel shares closed down 0.4% on Tuesday.</p>
<p>CFIUS is concerned Nippon Steel’s merger could hurt the supply of
steel needed for critical transportation, construction and agriculture
projects, it said in its August letter to the companies, exclusively
obtained by Reuters.</p>
<p>It also cited a global glut of cheap Chinese steel, and said that
under Nippon, a Japanese company, U.S. Steel would be less likely to
seek tariffs on foreign steel importers. It added that decisions by
Nippon could “lead to a reduction in domestic steel production
capacity.”</p>
<p>In a 100-page response letter to CFIUS, also exclusively obtained by
Reuters, Nippon Steel said it will invest billions of dollars in U.S.
Steel facilities that otherwise would have been idled, “indisputably”
allowing it to “maintain and potentially increase domestic steelmaking
capacity in the United States.”</p>
<p>The company also reaffirmed a promise not to transfer any U.S. Steel
production capacity or jobs outside the U.S. and would not interfere in
any of U.S. Steel’s decisions on trade matters, including decisions to
pursue trade measures under U.S. law against unfair trade practices.</p>
<p>The deal, Nippon added, would “create a stronger global competitor to
China grounded in the close relationship between the United States and
Japan.”</p>
<p>Robust CFIUS reviews take 90 days but it is common for companies to
withdraw their filings and resubmit them to give them more time to
address the panel’s concerns.</p>
<p>According to CFIUS’s 2023 annual report, 18% of companies seeking
deal approval refiled their applications last year. Nippon Steel and
U.S. Steel filed for the review in March, and CFIUS allowed them to
refile in June, starting a second 90-day clock that runs out on
Sept. 23, Reuters reported on Friday.</p>
<p>In December, CFIUS could approve the deal, possibly with measures to
address national security concerns, recommend that the president block
it, or extend the timetable again.</p>

Air Force general: Russia military larger, better than before Ukraine
invasion</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PENTAGON — Russia’s military is bigger and stronger than it was prior
to invading Ukraine in February 2022, the commander of United States Air
Forces in Europe and Africa cautioned Tuesday.</p>
<p>“Russia is getting larger, and they’re getting better than they were
before. … They are actually larger than they were when [the invasion]
kicked off,” Air Force General James Hecker told reporters at the Air
&amp; Space Forces Association’s annual Air, Space &amp; Cyber
Conference.</p>
<p>The improvements come despite heavy casualties inflicted by Ukraine.
U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin has estimated that since 2022,
more than 350,000 Russian troops have been killed or wounded.</p>
<p>“The rates of casualties that they’re experiencing are staggering,”
Pentagon press secretary Major General Pat Ryder told reporters Tuesday
in response to a question from VOA.</p>
<p>On Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered that the Russian
army grow by 180,000 active-duty troops for a total of 1.5 million
soldiers, making Russia’s military the second largest in the world,
behind China’s.</p>
<p>“Russia is going to be something that we’re going to have to deal
with for a long time, no matter how this thing ends,” Hecker said.</p>
<p>However, William Pomeranz, a senior scholar at the Kennan Institute,
told VOA that “this move suggests that Vladimir Putin is losing the
war.”</p>
<p>“This is an open signal from Vladimir Putin that his army and his
military is in trouble and doesn’t have the resources to maintain troops
in the field,” Pomeranz said.</p>
<p>Despite Russian improvements on the battlefield, Ukraine has
continued to put chinks in Russia’s armor, shooting down more than 100
Russian aircraft since Moscow began its full-scale invasion, which
amounts to dozens more aircraft than Russia has been able to down on the
Ukrainian side, according to General Hecker.</p>
<p>“So what we see is the aircraft are kind of staying on their own side
of the line, if you will, and when that happens, you have a war like
we’re seeing today, with massive attrition, cities just being
demolished, a lot of civilian casualties,” he said.</p>
<p>To gain even the slightest advantages in a war where no clear side
dominates the skies, Ukraine has turned to low-cost solutions that also
appeal to the U.S. military.</p>
<p>“We have to get on the right side of the cost curve with this. Taking
down $10,000, $15,000, $20,000 one-way UAVs [drones] with $1 million
missiles, we just can’t afford to do that in the long-term,” the general
told reporters. </p>
<p>General Chance Saltzman, the chief of the U.S. Space Force, announced
Tuesday that a Space Force pilot program that uses commercial satellite
imagery and related analytics to create more situational awareness for
military leaders has proven very cost-effective when compared with
traditional intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance collection via
U.S. MQ-9 drones, which are expensive and limited in number.</p>
<p>AFRICOM was able to use the $40 million Tactical Surveillance,
Reconnaissance and Tracking Program to maintain situational awareness
during the full withdrawal of U.S. forces from two air bases in Niger in
July and August. The drawback, however, was that instead of real-time
situational awareness, the data took one to four hours to get to the
security team.</p>
<p>“Not as good as real time, right? With MQ-9 that you would have, but
it’s better than nothing, right?” Hecker said.</p>
<p>Hecker also said the U.S. was looking into more cost-effective ways
to sense incoming threats around bases, including methods like Ukraine’s
Sky Fortress system that uses thousands of inexpensive sensors to
identify aerial threats. He says the technology has been demonstrated in
Romania and other countries.</p>

influence campaign intensifies as US election nears</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — At first glance, Noah R. Smith might seem like your
typical social media user. His bio says he’s a father, a former “Track
and Field representative,” and a current member of the PanAm Sports
organization.</p>
<p>On July 14, a day after the first assassination attempt on Republican
presidential candidate Donald Trump, Smith shared three posts from an
account named “TRUMP WON.”</p>
<p>One post declared, “AMERICA was attacked today … we must get it
together. It’s literally a matter of life and death,” accompanied by an
image depicting a divine hand halting a bullet aimed at Trump.</p>
<p>Another post urged “all MAGA GOD Fearing Patriots” to connect,
stating, “Grow These Accounts, UNITED We Are Strong.”</p>
<p>While it might seem that Smith is a devoted Trump supporter, closer
inspection suggests otherwise. His cover photo features Chinese
watermarks, his profile picture is sourced from a company that provides
photos, videos and music, and his bio is lifted from an authentic
account named Laurel R. Smith.</p>
<p>In reality, Noah R. Smith is impersonating a U.S. voter who supports
Trump. A joint investigation by VOA Mandarin and Doublethink Lab (DTL),
a Taiwanese social media analytics firm, uncovered 10 such accounts on
X.</p>
<p>These accounts are linked to China’s Spamouflage network — a
state-sponsored operation aimed at supporting the Chinese government and
undermining its critics. This network was first identified by social
media analytics company Graphika in 2019 and was used to target Hong
Kong pro-democracy protesters at that time.</p>
<p>Following the assassination attempt on July 14, the accounts began
promoting pro-Trump content. Previously, they shared material consistent
with Spamouflage’s broader interests: defending China, criticizing U.S.
foreign policy, and exploiting divisive domestic issues such as gun
violence and racial tensions.</p>
<p>DTL labeled this network of accounts posing as Americans “MAGAflage
1,” because they all seem to be promoting Trump’s slogan “Make America
Great Again [MAGA].”</p>
<p>“The MAGAflage accounts are different because they are not just
criticizing stuff. They are amplifying positive content about Trump,”
Jasper Hewitt, a digital intelligence analyst at Doublethink Lab, told
VOA Mandarin.</p>
<p>He added that it’s too early to draw conclusions about whom China is
supporting, as researchers are still tracking accounts that criticize
both Republican candidate Donald Trump and Democratic candidate Kamala
Harris.</p>
<p>“Engaging with the MAGA movement, or any part of the political
spectrum, might merely be a new attempt to generate authentic traffic,”
Hewitt told VOA.</p>
<p>The first MAGAflage network was discovered by Elise Thomas, a senior
analyst at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, in April 2024. This
network focuses on promoting positive content of Trump. She told VOA
earlier that by wrapping a topic in a U.S. partisan political frame,
these accounts got “a reasonable amount of engagement from real American
users.”</p>
<p>Limited influence</p>
<p>The VOA Mandarin investigation revealed that the accounts operate in
coordination. Six out of the 10 accounts were created in 2015 but had
their first visible posts on May 18 or May 19, 2022.</p>
<p>The batch accounts — the 10 new accounts — are not very active. Each
account has roughly 100 posts or reposts over the last two years. The
batch accounts were inactive for one year but were awoken after the
first Trump assassination attempt.</p>
<p>Additionally, these accounts occasionally post or repost Chinese
content.</p>
<p>For example, an account named Super-Rabbit shared praise for China’s
political and economic model from state-linked influencers like Shanghai
Panda and Xinhua News Agency’s reporter Li Zexin. One post from
September 3 contrasted U.S. President Joe Biden’s inactivity with
China’s President Xi Jinping’s engagement in Africa.</p>
<p>“When Joe Biden is sitting on the beach wasted away, China’s
President Xi is shaking hands with various African leaders and making a
better impact in Africa,” the post said.</p>
<p>VOA contacted the Trump and Harris campaigns for comment but did not
receive a response as of publication time.</p>
<p>Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington,
told VOA in a statement that “China has no intention and will not
interfere in the U.S. election, and we hope that the U.S. side will not
make an issue of China in the election.”</p>
<p>So far, the newly discovered MAGAflage 1 accounts have had limited
influence, with only a handful of followers and minimal
interactions.</p>
<p>U.S. intelligence agencies issued their latest assessment earlier
this month, warning that Russia, Iran, and China are intensifying
efforts to influence the U.S. presidential election.</p>
<p>While Russia remains the primary concern, officials noted that
Chinese online influence actors have “continued small scale efforts on
social media to engage U.S. audiences on divisive political issues,
including protests about the Israel-Gaza conflict and promote negative
stories about both political parties.”</p>

Republicans again block legislation to guarantee rights to IVF</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Republicans have blocked for a second time this year
legislation to establish a nationwide right to in vitro fertilization,
arguing that the vote is an election-year stunt after Democrats forced a
vote on the issue.</p>
<p>The Senate vote was Democrats’ latest attempt to force Republicans
into a defensive stance on women’s health issues and highlight policy
differences between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President
Donald Trump in the presidential race, especially as Trump has called
himself a “leader on IVF.”</p>
<p>The 51-44 vote was short of the 60 votes needed to move forward on
the bill, with only two Republicans voting in favor. Democrats say
Republicans who insist they support IVF are being hypocritical because
they won’t support legislation guaranteeing a right to it.</p>
<p>“They say they support IVF — here you go, vote on this,” said
Illinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth, the bill’s lead sponsor and a military
veteran who has used the fertility treatment to have her two
children.</p>
<p>The Democratic push started earlier this year after the Alabama
Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos can be considered children under
state law. Several clinics in the state suspended IVF treatments until
the GOP-led legislature rushed to enact a law to provide legal
protections for the clinics.</p>
<p>Democrats quickly capitalized, holding a vote in June on Duckworth’s
bill and warning that the U.S. Supreme Court could go after the
procedure after it overturned the right to an abortion in 2022.</p>
<p>The bill would establish a nationwide right for patients to access
IVF and other assisted reproductive technologies and a right for doctors
and insurance companies to provide it, an effort to pre-empt state
efforts to limit the services. It would also require more health
insurers to cover it and expand coverage for military service members
and veterans.</p>
<p>In a statement after the vote, Harris said Republicans in Congress
“have once again made clear that they will not protect access to the
fertility treatments many couples need to fulfill their dream of having
a child.”</p>
<p>Republican vice presidential candidate and Ohio Sen. JD Vance, who
missed the vote because he was campaigning, said during a stop in
Wisconsin that the measure was not a serious IVF bill, but a measure
designed to make Republicans look bad.</p>
<p>“The Senate blocked a ridiculous showboat bill that had no chance of
passing,” Vance said.</p>
<p>Republicans argued that the federal government shouldn’t tell states
what to do and that the bill was an unserious effort. Only Republican
Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska voted with
Democrats to move forward on the bill both times.</p>
<p>South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the No. 2 Senate Republican, said that
Democrats are trying to create a political issue “where there isn’t
one.”</p>
<p>“Let me remind everybody that Republicans support IVF, full stop,”
Thune said just before the vote.</p>

lawmakers welcome Russian activist freed in August prisoner swap</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. lawmakers welcomed Vladimir Kara-Murza to Capitol
Hill Tuesday, celebrating the release of the Russian activist from a
Kremlin prison last month. </p>
<p>Kara-Murza was part of the biggest prisoner exchange between the U.S.
and Russia since the end of the Cold War. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Ben Cardin said Tuesday
that Kara-Murza “was at the forefront of the human rights struggle and
an inspiration for so many people around the world.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In a letter written upon Kara-Murza’s release, Cardin said, “Your
return home is both a personal victory and a testament to the unwavering
strength of the human spirit.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Democratic Representative Bill Keating described Kara-Murza as one of
the people Russian President Vladimir Putin most despises because of his
ability to speak directly to the Russian people. Kara-Murza has twice
survived suspected poisoning attempts. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Kara-Murza, a deputy leader of the People’s Freedom Party, was
arrested in Russia in April 2022 and later faced charges of treason and
spreading disinformation about the Russian military. Russian prosecutors
suggested he face the maximum 25-year sentence in a prison colony. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Kara-Murza was awarded the Václav Havel Human Rights Prize by the
Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in October 2022 and the
Pulitzer Prize for commentary in 2024. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Surreal doesn’t come close to describing what I feel — just a few
weeks ago sitting in a maximum-security prison in Siberia and now seeing
so many friends in the halls of the U.S. Congress,” Kara-Murza told a
gathering of lawmakers, journalists and activists on Capitol Hill. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Kara-Murza thanked the public for keeping their attention focused on
his situation.</p>
<p>“The only way we will be able to achieve long-term peace, stability,
security and democracy on the European continent will be with a
peaceful, free and democratic Russia,” he said.</p>
<p>The Biden administration secured the release of 16 detainees in
return for the release of eight detainees and two minors on Aug. 1.</p>
<p>James O’Brien, assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian
affairs, thanked Kara-Murza for his work on the Global Magnitsky Act,
bipartisan legislation that authorizes the U.S. government to sanction
government officials throughout the world who are human rights
offenders.</p>
<p>“Vladimir, you gave us one of the main tools that we use to focus our
advocacy for your freedom in the Global Magnitsky Act, and your work on
that, I’m sure you didn’t do it as a tool for yourself, but your work on
that has helped us enormously as we work to free prisoners in the
Western Hemisphere, in other countries across the world,” O’Brien
said.</p>
<p>Democratic Senator Chris Coons said Putin is still holding untold
numbers of political prisoners in Russia.</p>
<p>“We must realize [Putin] does that, like all authoritarians, because
he’s afraid, afraid of his own people, afraid of accountability, afraid
of the Ukrainians who just on the border of Russia are fighting with
determination,” Coons said.</p>

id="experts-say-voters-should-feel-confident-in-us-elections-this-year">Experts
say voters should feel confident in US elections this year</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — American voters face a challenging duality as they count
down the days until November’s presidential election: a security
landscape that officials say has become ever more dangerous even as the
infrastructure to hold elections has become ever-more secure. </p>
<p>The run-up to the 2024 election has seen the “most complex threat
landscape yet,” according to Cait Conley, a senior adviser at the U.S.
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the government
body responsible for overseeing election security. </p>
<p>“We do see a growing and diverse array of foreign adversaries,
foreign actors, trying to disrupt our elections,” Conley said Tuesday,
speaking at Politico’s AI and Tech Summit in Washington.  </p>
<p>But U.S. voters should feel confident, she added. </p>
<p>“We have been surging resources,” Conley said. “We have seen
tremendous investment and progress in ensuring the full spectrum of
security and resilience of our election infrastructure.” </p>
<p>Nevertheless, Conley and other U.S. officials acknowledge the dangers
are widespread, often extending beyond the voting booth. </p>
<p>Physical threats </p>
<p>The FBI and U.S. Postal Service said Tuesday they are investigating
suspicious packages sent to election workers in at least 12 states. </p>
<p>CISA officials have reported a growing number of swatting incidents —
false reports to emergency services about violence or an emergency at a
home or other location — targeting election workers. </p>
<p>And the number of direct threats is rising rapidly. </p>
<p>“We are seeing an unprecedented and extremely disturbing level of
threats of violence, and violence, against public officials,” said U.S.
Deputy General Lisa Monaco, also speaking at the summit in Washington.
 </p>
<p>“For sure weekly and, sometimes, daily,” Monaco said of the frequency
of the threats. </p>
<p>Many of the threats target officials responsible for conducting
elections. </p>
<p>“These are people who are simply volunteering their time to help all
of us undertake the most fundamental right,” she said. “These are people
who are being threatened simply for doing their job.” </p>
<p>Officials also warn that other public servants are getting a growing
number of threats, including law enforcement officers, prosecutors and
elected officials and candidates. </p>
<p>“It’s serious,” said Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas,
citing Sunday’s apparent assassination attempt against former President
Donald Trump as he played golf at his course in West Palm Beach,
Florida. </p>
<p>He also pointed to the rash of threats in Springfield, Ohio,
following the spread of unsubstantiated rumors about Haitian immigrants
eating pets.</p>
<p>“We are in a heightened threat environment … a threat environment
that is of deep concern,” Mayorkas said. “It requires vigilance at every
level of government and frankly on every block of each community across
this country.” </p>
<p>Concerns about the heightened threat environment are not new. </p>
<p>Homeland Security officials have been warning of the dangers since at
least January 2021, saying lone offenders or small groups could be
motivated to carry out attacks motivated by a range of political and
personal grievances.</p>
<p>Only now, high emotions over the election combined with efforts by
U.S. adversaries are fueling discontent and anger that could lead to
more attacks. </p>
<p>Cyber operations </p>
<p>“When it comes to malign influence campaigns, we are seeing a very
aggressive set of actors,” Monaco said. </p>
<p>Many of the efforts to sow discord have originated in Russia and
Iran, and to a lesser extent China.  But they are far from alone. </p>
<p>“We’re seeing more actors in this space acting more aggressively in a
more polarized environment and doing more with technologies, in
particular AI,” Monaco said.  </p>
<p>Earlier this month, the U.S. Justice Department took action against
what it said were two Russian plots to spread disinformation, taking
down 32 fake news websites while bringing charges against two employees
of Russia-backed media outlet RT, accusing them of funneling nearly $10
million to a U.S. company to promote material favorable to the Russian
government. </p>
<p>And last week, the U.S. State Department accused a number of Russian
media companies, including RT, of working directly for Russia’s
intelligence agencies – charges Russia and RT denied. </p>
<p>US preparations </p>
<p>The best defense, Monaco said, is for U.S. voters to be careful about
where they get their information. </p>
<p>“We have to be very vigilant on what we are consuming,” she
said. </p>
<p>Experts like Margaret Talev, who directs the Syracuse University
Institute for Democracy, Journalism and Citizenship in Washington,
agree. </p>
<p>Voters should “take a pause. Take a minute,” Talev told VOA. “It
involves all of us teaching ourselves, taking our time and trying to
verify information from multiple sources rather than just believing the
first thing that we see.” </p>
<p>The National Association of Secretaries of State (NASS), whose
members play key roles in running elections, has also sought to make
getting verified information easier, pushing a social media campaign it
calls #TrustedInfo2024. </p>
<p>NASS says its goal is “to promote election officials as the trusted
sources of election information during the 2024 election cycle and
beyond.” </p>
<p>And CISA, the cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency, has
been working with election officials across the country to make sure
they are ready for almost any contingency. </p>
<p>CISA officials have also tried to rein in the hype about the dangers
of AI, or artificial intelligence, blamed for helping U.S. adversaries
to spread disinformation more effectively. </p>
<p>“Generative AI is not going to fundamentally introduce new threats to
this election cycle,” the agency’s Conley told VOA earlier this
month.</p>
<p>While AI is exacerbating existing threats, so far it has not produced
anything elections officials have not already seen. </p>
<p>“This threat vector is not new to them,” Conley said. “And they have
taken the measures to ensure they’re prepared to respond
effectively.”</p>

Does OpenAI’s New Breakthrough Mean for Energy Consumption?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-17, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzYzMTQ2Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczMjQ2MzgxM30.6qcLJqjIn2Nl8zgMLlT2rhKLDJwlGfXQ5225MnAK5nY/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
What happens when artificial intelligence takes some time to think?
</p>
<p>
The newest set of models from OpenAI, o1-mini and o1-preview, exhibit
more “reasoning” than existing large language models and associated
interfaces, which spit out answers to prompts almost instantaneously.
</p>
<p>
Instead, the new model will sometimes “think” for as long as a minute or
two. “Through training, they learn to refine their thinking process, try
different strategies, and recognize their mistakes,” OpenAI
<a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>announced
in a blog post last week</u></a>. The company said these models perform
better than their existing ones on some tasks, especially related to
math and science. “This is a significant advancement and represents a
new level of AI capability,” the company said.
</p>
<p>
But is it also a significant advancement in energy usage?
</p>
<p>
In the short run at least, almost certainly, as spending more time
“thinking” and generating more text will require more computing power.
As Erik Johannes Husom, a researcher at SINTEF Digital, a Norwegian
research organization, told me, “It looks like we’re going to get
another acceleration of generative AI’s carbon footprint.”
</p>
<p>
Discussion of energy use and large language models has been dominated by
the gargantuan requirements for “training,” essentially running a
massive set of equations through a corpus of text from the internet.
This requires hardware on the scale of tens of thousands of graphical
processing units and
<a href="https://www.ri.se/en/news/blog/generative-ai-does-not-run-on-thin-air" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>an
estimated 50 gigawatt-hours of electricity to run</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Training GPT-4 cost “more than” $100 million OpenAI chief executive Sam
Altman
<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/openai-ceo-sam-altman-the-age-of-giant-ai-models-is-already-over/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has
said</u></a>; the next generation models will likely
<a href="https://time.com/6984292/cost-artificial-intelligence-compute-epoch-report/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>cost
around $1 billion</u></a>, according to Anthropic chief executive Dario
Amodei, a figure that might balloon to $100 billion for further
generation models, according to Oracle founder Larry Ellison.
</p>
<p>
While a huge portion of these costs are hardware, the energy consumption
is considerable as well. (Meta reported that when training its Llama 3
models, power would sometimes <em><em>fluctuate</em></em> by “tens of
megawatts,”
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21783" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>enough
to power thousands of homes</u></a>). It’s no wonder that OpenAI’s chief
executive Sam Altman
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-18/sam-altman-s-helion-energy-promises-fusion-power-by-2028" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has
put hundreds of millions of dollars into a fusion company</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
But the models are not simply trained, they’re used out in the world,
generating outputs (think of what ChatGPT spits back at you). This
process tends to be
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/24066646/ai-electricity-energy-watts-generative-consumption" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>comparable
to other common activities like streaming Netflix or using a
lightbulb</u></a>. This can be done with different hardware and the
process is more distributed and less energy intensive.
</p>
<p>
As large language models are being developed, most computational power —
and therefore most electricity — is used on training, Charlie Snell, a
PhD student at University of California at Berkeley who studies
artificial intelligence, told me. “For a long time training was the
dominant term in computing because people weren’t using models much.”
But as these models become more popular, that balance could shift.
</p>
<p>
“There will be a tipping point depending on the user load, when the
total energy consumed by the inference requests is larger than the
training,” said Jovan Stojkovic, a graduate student at the University of
Illinois who has written about optimizing inference in large language
models.
</p>
<p>
And these new reasoning models could bring that tipping point forward
because of how computationally intensive they are.
</p>
<p>
“The more output a model produces, the more computations it has
performed. So, long chain-of-thoughts leads to more energy consumption,”
Husom of SINTEF Digital told me.
</p>
<p>
OpenAI staffers have been downright enthusiastic about the possibilities
of having more time to think, seeing it as another breakthrough in
artificial intelligence that could lead to subsequent breakthroughs on a
range of scientific and mathematical problems. “o1 thinks for seconds,
but we aim for future versions to think for hours, days, even weeks.
Inference costs will be higher, but what cost would you pay for a new
cancer drug? For breakthrough batteries? For a proof of the Riemann
Hypothesis? AI can be more than chatbots,” OpenAI
<a href="https://x.com/polynoamial/status/1834280969786065278" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>researcher
Noam Brown tweeted</u></a>.<br/><br/>But those “hours, days, even weeks”
will mean more computation and “there is no doubt that the increased
performance requires a lot of computation,” Husom said, along with more
carbon emissions.
</p>
<p>
But Snell told me that might not be the end of the story. It’s possible
that over the long term, the overall computing demands for constructing
and operating large language models will remain fixed or possibly even
decline.
</p>
<p>
While “the default is that as capabilities increase, demand will
increase and there will be more inference,” Snell told me, “maybe we can
squeeze reasoning capability into a small model … Maybe we spend more on
inference but it’s a much smaller model.”
</p>
<p>
OpenAI hints at this possibility, describing their o1-mini as “a smaller
model optimized for STEM reasoning,” in contrast to other, larger models
that “are pre-trained on vast datasets” and “have broad world
knowledge,” which can make them “expensive and slow for real-world
applications.” OpenAI is suggesting that a model can know less but think
more and deliver comparable or better results to larger models — which
might mean more efficient and less energy hungry large language
models.<strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
In short, thinking might use less brain power than remembering, even if
you think for a very long time.

id="things-you-really-should-know-about-windows-input-but-would-rather-not">Things
you really should know about Windows Input, but would rather not</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>Are you developing a game for Windows, and are you working on input
handling? At first, it could reasonably be assumed that mouse and
keyboard should be the simplest parts of this to deal with, but in
reality, they are not – at least if we are talking about Windows. In
fact, several extremely popular AAA games ship with severe mouse input
issues when specific high-end mice are used, and some popular engines
have issues that are still extant. In this article we’ll explore a few
reasons why that is the case, and end up with a solution that works but
is still unsatisfactory. I assume that there is a whole other level of
complexity involved in properly dealing with accessories like steering
wheels, flight sticks, and so on in simulators, but so far I never had
the pleasure of working on a game that required this, and this article
will not cover those types of input devices. ↫ Peter ‘Durante’ Thoman
So, what is the problem? Basically, there are two ways to handle mouse
input in Windows: if you use batched raw input processing, which is
pretty much a requirement, you need to also choose whether or not to
keep legacy input enabled. If you keep it enabled, the legacy input will
add so much junk to your message queue it can negatively impact the
performance of your game quite harshly. If you disable it, however,
something really fun happens: you can no longer move the game window…
Because the Windows UI uses legacy input. Thoman has a solution that he
and his company uses, and he considers it an ugly hack, but they just
don’t know of a better way to solve this issue. Thoman keeps legacy
input enabled, but just limits the number of message queue events per
frame that are being processed (they limit it to 5). As far as they can
tell, this doesn’t seem to have any negative side effects, but it’s
clearly a bit of an ugly hack that shouldn’t be necessary. I found this
a rather interesting niche topic, and I wonder how many people have
struggled with this before, and what kind of other solutions exist.</p>

id="myanmar-diaspora-protests-at-chinese-embassy-in-washington">Myanmar
diaspora protests at Chinese Embassy in Washington</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — More than 50 Burmese Americans gathered in front of the
Chinese Embassy in Washington, protesting China’s alleged interference
in Myanmar’s internal affairs.</p>
<p>The protest on Saturday, part of a global campaign, called on China
to withdraw its support for Myanmar’s military junta and respect the
will of the people, who have been fighting for democracy since the
February 2021 coup.</p>
<p>The protest — with demonstrators waving banners that read “Reject
Junta’s Sham Elections” and “Solidarity With the People of Myanmar” —
was sparked by a statement released earlier Saturday by the Chinese
Embassy in Myanmar, saying that China was not interfering in the
country’s affairs and would continue to promote peace and stability.</p>
<p>“We reject the Chinese Embassy’s statement that they’re not
interfering in Myanmar’s internal matters,” said Yin Aye, a protest
leader who has been organizing demonstrations in the Washington area
since the 2021 coup. “If they would stop supporting sham elections and
truly pressure the military to stop causing so much pain to our people,
we might believe them.”</p>
<p>Yin Aye referred to China’s close ties with Myanmar’s military junta
and its alleged interference in the operations of ethnic resistance
forces in northern Shan State, actions that have drawn widespread
criticism from Burmese and pro-democracy groups.</p>
<p>On August 29, the Ta’ang National Liberation Army, or TNLA, an armed
ethnic group fighting against the junta in northeastern Myanmar, said it
had received a letter from Chinese authorities in the border town of
Ruili warning the group to halt its offensive in northern Shan State,
where key Belt and Road Initiative projects are located, or face
consequences.</p>
<p>Hla Kyaw Zaw, a veteran observer of China-Myanmar relations, said
China’s recent actions, particularly its warning to the TNLA, have
sparked outrage among the Myanmar public, who view it as a direct threat
to ethnic resistance forces fighting for democracy.</p>
<p>“The language used in the letter was undiplomatic and threatening,”
Hla Kyaw Zaw told VOA’s Burmese Service.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the TNLA told VOA that Chinese authorities had
warned the group in the letter to stop fighting, maintain stability
along the China-Myanmar border and protect Chinese citizens. The letter
warned that failure to comply would result in China “teaching them a
lesson” and holding the group responsible for any consequences.</p>
<p>When asked about the letter at a regular press briefing in late
August, China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Liu Jian did not confirm
or deny Beijing had sent the letter.</p>
<p>“China is closely following the situation in Myanmar and the
developments of the conflict in northern Myanmar and has been working to
promote peacetalks and ceasefire,” spokesperson Liu Jian said. “As
Myanmar’s biggest neighboring country, China has all along sincerely
hoped that Myanmar will achieve stability and development and has worked
actively to this end.”</p>
<p>Since then, members of the Myanmar diaspora have intensified protests
outside Chinese embassies worldwide, accusing China of supporting
Myanmar’s military coup.</p>
<p>Protests worldwide</p>
<p>Saturday’s protest in Washington was part of a series of coordinated
demonstrations by Burmese diaspora communities worldwide.</p>
<p>In July, activists in Washington, New York, San Francisco, London and
Tokyo protested outside Chinese embassies and consulates.</p>
<p>In the July protest in Washington, protesters attempted to hand
deliver an open letter to Chinese authorities, urging Beijing to halt
its support for Myanmar’s military junta. However, the letter went
unanswered.</p>
<p>“When we handed the letter to the Chinese embassy here in D.C., they
refused to accept it. They didn’t even acknowledge our demands,” said
Yin Aye.</p>
<p>Activists were instructed to send the letter by post, but previous
attempts to mail similar letters to the Chinese Embassy were returned
undelivered.</p>
<p>Despite the lack of formal response, Myanmar activists say the
Chinese Embassy in Washington has been monitoring their protest
activities in recent weeks.</p>
<p>“Now, we see them videotaping our protests,” Yin Aye said.</p>
<p>Voice of America reached out to the Chinese embassies in Washington
and Yangon for comment about the protests but did not receive a response
by the time of publication.</p>
<p>War crimes allegations</p>
<p>The Myanmar diaspora argues that China’s support for Myanmar’s
military is not only undermining the will of the people but also
enabling war crimes, including aerial bombardments and the targeting of
internally displaced persons.</p>
<p>Minmin Berwald, an activist of Myanmar descent, was compelled to
participate in the protest on Saturday.</p>
<p>“I want to ask China to immediately stop supporting this military
regime and interfering in Burma’s internal affairs,” Berwald said. “It’s
not just homes being set on fire. Internally displaced people who have
fled war are being bombarded.”</p>
<p>China’s contradictory stance</p>
<p>China has maintained a complex position toward Myanmar since the
February 2021 coup, balancing its own interests with regional stability,
Hla Kyaw Zaw said. She noted that China has sent high officials to
Myanmar, called for peace in the country and sponsored mediating talks
between the junta and the armed ethnic groups.</p>
<p>After the coup, however, China’s official Xinhua news agency
described the military’s takeover and replacement of elected ministers
as a “major cabinet reshuffle,” avoiding the use of the term “coup.”</p>
<p>Beijing called for all parties in Myanmar to “resolve their
differences” and refrained from condemning the military. In 2022, China
also abstained from voting on U.N. Security Council Resolution 2669,
which called for an end to violence in Myanmar. However, critics argue
that China’s actions on the ground suggest deeper involvement.</p>
<p>A veteran China-Myanmar affairs expert in Yangon, who requested
anonymity for security reasons, said China’s statements often appear
contradictory. “It’s clear that China wants to control the situation to
its advantage,” the expert said, referring to China’s public calls for
peace while its actions suggest otherwise.</p>
<p>China, for its part, has denied interfering in Myanmar’s internal
affairs on multiple occasions. In its statement Saturday, the Chinese
Embassy in Myanmar reiterated its position of noninterference and called
for a peaceful resolution to the conflict. The embassy also condemned
what it called “unjustified accusations” from individuals and media.</p>
<p>The fight continues</p>
<p>Protesters also called for China to take a more active role in
cutting off support to Myanmar’s junta, including halting the supply of
jet fuel used in airstrikes against civilians. Amnesty International has
documented multiple cases of the Myanmar military using airpower to
target civilian areas, and activists argue that China’s continued
engagement with the junta implicates them in these atrocities.</p>
<p>For now, the protesters have vowed to keep returning to the Chinese
Embassy in Washington. “We will continue to protest, continue to speak
out,” said Yin Aye.</p>

<h2 id="a-brief-history-of-quicktime">A brief history of QuickTime</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>We all know about the Desktop Publishing revolution that the first
Macs and their PostScript LaserWriter printers brought in the late
1980s, but many have now forgotten the Desktop Video revolution that
followed in the next decade. At its heart was support for multimedia in
Apple’s QuickTime. QuickTime isn’t a single piece of software, or even
an API in Classic Mac OS, but a whole architecture to support almost any
media format you could conceive of. It defines container and file
formats for multiple media types, forming the basis for the MPEG-4
standard, extensible encoding and decoding of a wide variety of media
using Codecs, and more. ↫ Howard Oakley As a Windows users before I
switched to the Mac somewhere in 2003 or 2004 or so, I mostly associated
QuickTime with an annoying piece of crapware I sometimes had to install
to watch videos, despite my Windows installation being perfectly capable
of playing a whole slew of video codecs just fine. To make matters
worse, Apple eventually started forcing Windows users to also install
their auto-update tool that ran in the background, which would
occasionally just… Install stuff without your permission. Of course,
QuickTime was a whole lot more than that, especially on the Mac, where
it was simply a core technology of the Mac operating system and the name
of the built-in video player. It also served as underpinnings for a
whole slew of related technologies, from movie editors like iMovie to
the QuickTime streaming tools included in Mac OS X Server, so odds are
that somehow, somewhere, you’ve used QuickTime in your life time. I’m
not entirely ashamed to admit I had to check if QuickTime was still part
of macOS today – I haven’t actively used macOS since, I think, the Snow
Leopard days in 2009 – but it obviously has been sunset quite a while
ago in favour of AVFoundation, which macOS still uses today.</p>

id="pentagon-inspector-general-ukraine-is-job-one-for-defense-oversight">Pentagon
inspector general: Ukraine is ‘job one’ for defense oversight</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine
in February 2022, the U.S. Congress has appropriated $174 billion,
including U.S. weapons and materiel, to respond to the crisis and help
Ukraine defend itself against Russia’s aggression.</p>
<p>U.S. Department of Defense Inspector General Robert Storch calls the
oversight of U.S. security assistance to Ukraine his office’s “job one,”
with more than 200 people assigned to that task.</p>
<p>In an interview with Voice of America’s Ukrainian Service, Storch
discussed the challenges in obtaining the information necessary for such
oversight in a country that is fighting a war, suffers from endemic
corruption and has no large-scale U.S. military presence.</p>
<p>According to the most recent quarterly Special Inspector General
report to the U.S. Congress on Operation Atlantic Resolve (the name of
the U.S. military response to Russian operations in Ukraine), issued in
mid-August, there were 57 open investigations as of June 30, 2024. They
involved “grant and procurement fraud, corruption, theft, program
irregularities, and diversion and counter-proliferation of technology of
weapons systems components.”</p>
<p>In January, Ukraine’s SBU security service reported that it had
uncovered a $40 million corruption scheme, implicating defense ministry
officials and arms supplier managers, that involved the embezzlement of
funds for purchase of 100,000 mortar shells.</p>
<p>That case did not involve U.S.-provided materiel. However, in
September 2023, Oleksii Reznikov was removed as Ukraine’s defense
minister “over various corruption cases despite enjoying a solid
reputation in representing Ukraine in its discussions with Western
allies,” Reuters reported.</p>
<p>Storch told VOA that the Pentagon is working with Ukraine’s military
to ensure that it provides timely and accurate information, and with
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s government to fight
corruption. He said that in the days immediately following Russia’s
full-scale invasion, Ukraine’s armed forces were delinquent in providing
information, but that the situation has improved, in part thanks to
oversight.</p>
<p>While corruption remains endemic in Ukraine, Storch said that
Ukraine’s anti-corruption institutions are maturing and that the
oversight community is working to ensure that such progress continues.
The following has been edited for length and clarity.</p>
<p>VOA: You are overseeing numerous Pentagon programs. How robust is
oversight of the delivery of weapons to Ukraine?</p>
<p>Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Defense Robert Storch: We
are leading a robust, comprehensive oversight effort that really covers
all aspects of U.S. assistance to Ukraine. I have responsibility over
the security assistance that’s provided, and we partner very closely,
hand-in-glove, with our great colleagues from the State Department
Office of Inspector General and the U.S. Agency for International
Development Office of Inspector General to make sure we’re covering all
aspects of humanitarian or other assistance that’s being provided to
Ukraine.</p>
<p>VOA: How large is your team that is overseeing the Ukrainian
program?</p>
<p>Storch: We have a lot of things pulling at us and lots going on in
the world with the Department of Defense. But Ukraine is very much job
one. I always say it’s really a matter of the highest priority for my
office and for my colleagues’ offices as well.</p>
<p>So, in the case of the Department of Defense Office of Inspector
General, we have over 200 people who are engaged in one aspect or
another of oversight over U.S. security assistance to Ukraine. That
includes about 30 people who were forward deployed in the region. We
have several offices in Germany. We have folks in Poland. And we have
both investigators and programmatic oversight personnel at the [U.S.]
Embassy in Kyiv. If you take all of our partners from State and AID in
oversight entities, it is between 300 and 400 people who are engaged in
oversight in this whole-of-government effort.</p>
<p>VOA: When you talk to Ukrainian officials, do they appreciate the
importance of reporting?</p>
<p>Storch: Without exception, they acknowledge the importance of making
sure that we get the information we need to be able to do our oversight
to make sure there’s accountability, and frankly to be able to tell the
decision-makers here in Washington that that’s going on. …</p>
<p>I go up to the Hill [Capitol Hill, location of the U.S. Congress] not
infrequently. And you know, I’m not a policymaker. It’s up to the
administration and the Congress to set what the policies are. But one of
the things I get asked all the time is, ‘Are we getting the information
we need to carry out our work?’ and we have been getting that, and we’re
going to work to make sure we continue to.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>VOA: The Pentagon transfers materiel to the Ukrainian armed forces.
Do they understand the importance of oversight, and do they provide
timely self-reporting?</p>
<p>Storch: We work really closely to make sure that’s the case. That’s
one of the big lines of effort with regard to our oversight. We’ve done
a number of reports looking at the monitoring and the reporting. There
are obligations that the Ukrainian armed forces have for reporting on
the status of the equipment, and U.S. personnel keep track and there’s a
database. When things are lost or destroyed, they have to be reported in
a certain way. … [T]hat’s one area where I like to think that our
oversight has really made a difference. When we first started on that,
the level of delinquency in that reporting was really pretty high, and
some of that was because, when the war started, the U.S. personnel had
to leave the country.</p>
<p>There was equipment being provided and really no one doing that sort
of accountability and inventory. So, a lot of it has been playing
catch-up. And … there are challenges with a wartime setting and a lot of
this equipment is being used on the front lines and [in] really
difficult and sad situations. And so being able to maintain
accountability is difficult, but we do a lot of work on that.</p>
<p>VOA: In one of your reports, you mentioned endemic corruption in
Ukraine. You worked in Ukraine in 2007 to 2009 to help the country
overcome corruption. Can you compare the situation in Ukraine now to
what you saw back then?</p>
<p>Storch: I actually had the opportunity to work and live in Ukraine
back in 2007 to 2009, when I was with the Department of Justice working
with the Ukrainians to help them develop measures to address official
corruption. And I had the opportunity to go back on a number of
occasions and provide assistance in the drafting of the anti-corruption
legislation, and that created the National Anti-Corruption Bureau and
the Office of the Special Anti-Corruption Prosecutor, so I have had a
lot of experience out there and have seen the way these institutions
have matured. The Ukrainians made it happen …</p>
<p>But Ukraine has had long-standing issues with corruption, obviously,
and people are working to address it. One of the things we talk about in
our quarterly reporting … is that they’re continuing to make efforts to
address it, and we continue as the United States both to provide
assistance in that, and then, in the oversight community, to do
oversight over that to make sure that progress is being made.</p>
<p>VOA: Your report mentions that there are 57 investigations ongoing
into allegations ranging from irregularities in procurement to
corruption, diversion and theft. Have any of those allegations been
substantiated?</p>
<p>Storch: At this point, based on our completed work, we haven’t
substantiated those allegations, but obviously the investigations
continue, right?</p>
<p>VOA: About half of the allegations involve the proliferation of
weapons. How high is the risk of diversion?</p>
<p>Storch: Sure, there’s a significant risk there, but we always want to
make sure we’re doing everything we can to address it, and that’s why I
mention the programmatic oversight.</p>
<p>We have a website [with] links to the hotlines that my office and our
counterparts operate. I really encourage folks to take advantage of that
to report that information. So, people can look into it.</p>
<p>VOA: There is reporting that the Pentagon overestimated the value of
some of the U.S. equipment destined for Ukraine. Do you think this
accounting error will persist or is it being corrected?</p>
<p>Storch: We’re doing everything we can to help the [Defense]
Department to address it. We became concerned about that pretty early on
and consulted with the department about it and, without getting too
complex, basically the department was using a methodology to value the
materiel that was being provided that resulted in an overvaluation of
it. If you were donating your car, you probably wouldn’t be able to
donate the cost of buying a new car like that, right? It’s a little more
complicated than that, but basically it resulted in an overvaluation.
Initially the Department looking into it found about $6.2 billion that
they thought was overstated. We came in and did additional oversight,
which is reflected in our reporting, and found about $1.9 billion
additionally.</p>
<p>So, the answer to your question is we made recommendations to help
the Department address the issues, and we’re going to keep working to
make sure those recommendations are carried out and the problems
addressed.</p>

court upholds British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell’s sex trafficking
conviction</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>new york — A U.S. court on Tuesday upheld disgraced British socialite
Ghislaine Maxwell’s conviction on sex trafficking charges for helping
the late financier Jeffrey Epstein abuse underage girls.</p>
<p>Maxwell’s lawyers had argued that her convictions violated an
agreement Epstein reached with federal prosecutors 15 years ago and
violated the statute of limitations. They also cited judicial error and
a miscalculation of the federal sentencing guidelines range as reason to
reject her conviction and sentence.</p>
<p>But the ruling by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York
said Epstein’s non-prosecution agreement with federal prosecutors in
Florida didn’t bar federal prosecutors in New York from bringing a case.
They also found that Maxwell’s indictment was within the statute of
limitations.</p>
<p>Maxwell, 62, was found guilty in December 2021 of luring young girls
to Epstein so he could molest them, between 1994 and 2004. She was
sentenced to 20 years in prison in June 2022.</p>
<p>Epstein sexually abused children hundreds of times over more than a
decade, exploiting vulnerable girls as young as 14. Prosecutors said
Maxwell, his longtime companion, helped him and made the abuse
possible.</p>
<p>He killed himself in 2019 while awaiting trial.</p>
<p>Epstein and Maxwell’s associations with royals, presidents and
billionaires were not a prominent part of her trial but mentions of
friends such as Bill Clinton and Donald Trump showed how the pair
exploited their connections to impress their prey.</p>
<p>The trial revolved around allegations from only a handful of
Epstein’s accusers. Four testified that they were abused in the 1990s
and early 2000s at Epstein’s mansions in Florida, New York, New Mexico
and the Virgin Islands.</p>
<p>Maxwell is serving her sentence at a low-security federal prison in
Tallahassee, Florida.</p>

owner Meta bans Russia state media outlets over ‘foreign
interference’</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>London — Meta said it’s banning Russia state media organization from
its social media platforms, alleging that the outlets used deceptive
tactics to amplify Moscow’s propaganda. The announcement drew a rebuke
from the Kremlin on Tuesday. </p>
<p>The company, which owns Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, said late
Monday that it will roll out the ban over the next few days in an
escalation of its efforts to counter Russia’s covert influence
operations. </p>
<p>“After careful consideration, we expanded our ongoing enforcement
against Russian state media outlets: Rossiya Segodnya, RT and other
related entities are now banned from our apps globally for foreign
interference activity,” Meta said in a prepared statement. </p>
<p>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov lashed out, saying that “such
selective actions against Russian media are unacceptable,” and that
“Meta with these actions are discrediting themselves.” </p>
<p>“We have an extremely negative attitude towards this. And this, of
course, complicates the prospects for normalizing our relations with
Meta,” Peskov told reporters during his daily conference call. </p>
<p>RT was formerly known as Russia Today. Rossiya Segodnya is the parent
company behind state news agency RIA Novosti and news brands like
Sputnik. </p>
<p>“It’s cute how there’s a competition in the West — who can try to
spank RT the hardest, in order to make themselves look better,” RT said
in a release. </p>
<p>Rossiya Segodnya did not respond to a request for comment from The
Associated Press. </p>
<p>Meta’s actions comes days after the United States announced new
sanctions on RT, accusing the Kremlin news outlet of being a key part of
Russia’s war machine and its efforts to undermine its democratic
adversaries. </p>
<p>U.S. officials alleged last week that RT was working hand-in-hand
with the Russian military and running fundraising campaigns to pay for
sniper rifles, body armor and other equipment for soldiers fighting in
Ukraine. They also said RT websites masqueraded as legitimate news sites
but were used to spread disinformation and propaganda in Europe, Africa,
South America and elsewhere. </p>
<p>Earlier this month, the Biden administration seized Kremlin-run
websites and charged two RT employees of covertly providing millions of
dollars in funding to a Tennessee-based content creation company to
publish English-language social media videos pushing pro-Kremlin
messages. </p>
<p>Moscow has rejected the allegations. </p>
<p>Meta had already taken steps to limit Moscow’s online reach. Since
2020 it has been labeling posts and content from state media. Two years
later, it blocked state media from running ads and putting their content
lower in people’s feeds, and the company, along with other other social
media sites like YouTube and TikTok, blocked RT’s channels for European
users. Also in 2022 Meta also took down a sprawling Russia-based
disinformation network spreading Kremlin talking points about the
invasion of Ukraine. </p>
<p>Meta and Facebook “already blocked RT in Europe two years ago, now
they’re censoring information flow to the rest of the world,” RT said in
its statement. </p>
<p>Moscow has fought back, designating Meta as an extremist group in
March 2022, shortly after sending troops into Ukraine, and blocking
Facebook and Instagram. Both platforms — as well as Elon Musk’s X,
formerly known as Twitter, which is also blocked — were popular with
Russians before the invasion and the subsequent crackdown on independent
media and other forms of critical speech. The social media platforms are
now only accessible through virtual private networks.</p>

‘Diddy’ Combs charged with racketeering, sex trafficking</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Music mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs has been hit with three
federal charges of racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and
transportation to engage in prostitution, according to an indictment
unsealed on Tuesday.  </p>
<p>Combs, 54, was arrested in Manhattan by federal agents on Monday
night, following a year in which his career was derailed by several
lawsuits accusing him of physical and sexual abuse. </p>
<p>Marc Agnifilo, Combs’ lawyer, said he was disappointed with the
decision to pursue an “unjust prosecution” of the rapper and
producer. </p>
<p>“Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs is a music icon, self-made entrepreneur, loving
family man, and proven philanthropist who has spent the last 30 years
building an empire, adoring his children, and working to uplift the
Black community,” Agnifilo said on Monday night. “He is an imperfect
person, but he is not a criminal.” </p>
<p>Agnifilo added that Combs voluntarily relocated to New York in
anticipation of the charges. </p>
<p>Combs, who has also been known as P. Diddy and Puff Daddy, was a
major figure in hip-hop in the 1990s and 2000s. He founded the label Bad
Boy records, and is credited with helping turn rappers and R&amp;B
singers such as Mary J. Blige, Faith Evans, Notorious B.I.G. and Usher
into stars. </p>
<p>His reputation came under fire last November when former girlfriend
Casandra Ventura, an R&amp;B singer known as Cassie, accused him in a
lawsuit of serial physical abuse, sexual slavery and rape during their
decade-long relationship. She agreed to an undisclosed settlement one
day after suing, even as Combs denied her allegations. </p>
<p>His legal pressures mounted, and he has faced several civil lawsuits
by women and men who accused him of sexual assault and other misconduct.
His lawyers have been fighting those cases in court. Federal agents
raided his homes in Los Angeles and Miami Beach, Florida six months
ago. </p>
<p>Singer Dawn Richard, formerly of Danity Kane, last week accused Combs
in a lawsuit of sexual assault, battery, sex trafficking, gender
discrimination and fraud. </p>
<p>A Michigan judge this month ordered Combs to pay $100 million to
Derrick Lee Smith, who said Combs drugged and sexually assaulted him at
a party almost 30 years ago, after Combs failed to show up to defend
himself in court. A lawyer for Combs said he would seek to dismiss that
judgment. </p>
<p>Combs has also rejected claims in a February sex trafficking lawsuit
by Rodney “Lil Rod” Jones, who Combs employed as a producer on his 2023
release “The Love Album: Off the Grid.” </p>
<p>The indictment is not Combs’ first brush with the law. He was
acquitted in March 2001 of bribery and weapons charges in a criminal
trial stemming from a nightclub shooting that left three people
wounded.</p>

boosts military ties with Southeast Asian countries</h2>

<p>The United States has deepened its cooperation with allies in the
Indo-Pacific region in recent years, including Japan and South Korea.
But it has also reached out to non-allies, including non-aligned
countries of Southeast Asia like Indonesia. VOA’s Virginia Gunawan

say Vietnam official’s US trip could set path to C-130 deal</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam — Analysts say this week’s visit to
Washington by Vietnamese Defense Minister Phan Van Giang shows advances
in cooperation between the two countries, despite rising Vietnamese
nationalism that may indicate rising anti-American sentiment in
Vietnam.</p>
<p>A U.S.-based analyst told VOA on September 12 that Giang’s trip set
the groundwork for Hanoi to potentially purchase military cargo planes
from the United States this year.</p>
<p>Giang met with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin at the Pentagon on
Monday. [September 9] Both leaders “reaffirmed the importance of the
U.S.-Vietnam partnership,” the Defense Department said in a statement,
and noted the one-year anniversary of the elevation of the countries’
ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership, the highest tier in
Hanoi’s diplomatic hierarchy.</p>
<p>The leaders also underscored the importance of working together to
address the lasting impacts of the U.S.-Vietnam War. Austin announced
that the U.S. would budget $65 million over the next five years to
complete the decontamination of Bien Hoa airbase of dioxin, bringing the
total from department to $215 million. The airbase was the primary
storage site for the toxic chemical Agent Orange during the U.S.-Vietnam
War and remains an environmental and public health hazard for those
nearby.</p>
<p>Andrew Wells-Dang, who leads the Vietnam War Legacies and
Reconciliation Initiative at the United States Institute of Peace, told
VOA by phone on September 5 that diplomatic visits are key to advancing
war-remediation efforts, including finding and identifying the remains
of missing soldiers. He said that along with the U.S. visit of Deputy
Defense Minister Vo Minh Luong in July, visits from authorities provide
“opportunity for them to have high level support.”</p>
<p>Zachary Abuza, a professor at the National War College in Washington
and an expert on Southeast Asia, said joint war-reconciliation efforts
also set the groundwork for defense cooperation more broadly.</p>
<p>“The United States is very pleased with the growth in bilateral
defense relations, and it started from very low levels and was built on
humanitarian missions,” Abuza said during the August 29 call.</p>
<p>“We’ve just continued to build on that,” he added.</p>
<p>Cargo planes</p>
<p>Reuters reported in July that Hanoi was considering purchasing
Lockheed Martin C-130 cargo planes from the U.S., according to unnamed
sources.</p>
<p>The U.S.-based analyst, who asked that his name to be withheld
because he has not been cleared to discuss the topic, said the C-130
deal was discussed but not finalized during Giang’s visit. The analyst
said the deal was held back by the “massive [U.S.] bureaucracy” and
because solidifying the purchase during the Washington visit would be
“too inflammatory for the Chinese.”</p>
<p>Ian Storey, senior fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in
Singapore, noted Vietnam’s delicate diplomatic balancing act,
illustrated by Giang’s travel itinerary before the Washington trip.</p>
<p>“Vietnam aims to keep its relations with the major powers in
balance,” he wrote in an email on August 30. “As such, Vietnamese
Defense Minister Phan Van Giang visited Russia and China in August.”</p>
<p>Storey added that the purchase of C-130 planes would not pose a
threat to China in its maritime territorial disputes with Vietnam.</p>
<p>“C-130 aircraft would enable the Vietnamese to transport troops and
supplies to its occupied atolls in the South China Sea, but these assets
are non-strategic and won’t shift the dynamics in the South China Sea,”
he wrote.</p>
<p>Nguyen The Phuong, a maritime security expert at the University of
New South Wales Canberra, said the C-130 purchase would be a “symbolic
move.”</p>
<p>“Vietnam will try to explore more areas of security and defense
cooperation between Vietnam and the United States to upgrade to a
higher, more meaningful level,” he told VOA on August 30. “The C-130
would be the symbol of that kind of evolving relationship,” he said.</p>
<p>Phuong said a C-130 is a likely entry point as there is still
mistrust between the former foes regarding lethal weapons, and the deal
would not rankle China too much.</p>
<p>“It could be quite advantageous for Vietnam,” he said of a potential
C-130 purchase. “Vietnam can improve its relationship with the United
States, and at the same time, we could not anger China because Vietnam
would just buy non-lethal weapons.”</p>
<p>Rising nationalism</p>
<p>Although there are positive signs to improving Hanoi-Washington
relations, there have also been recent instances of anti-Western
sentiment that could be an impediment to the countries relations, Phuong
said.</p>
<p>Fulbright University Vietnam, which has significant backing from the
United States, is facing accusations of fomenting a “color revolution,”
similar to the popular uprisings in former Soviet republics.</p>
<p>On August 21, Vietnam National Defense TV aired a critique of
Fulbright for allegedly not displaying the Vietnamese flag at a
graduation ceremony and facilitating a color revolution.</p>
<p>The report has since been taken down, but Phuong said the Fulbright
issue and other recent incidents show tension between Vietnam’s
conservative and liberal factions.</p>
<p>“It’s a presentation of a continuous struggle between different
factions, one conservative and one liberal,” Phuong said.</p>
<p>Abuza said that Vietnamese authorities may be attempting to tighten
control ahead of the anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War in
1975.</p>
<p>“Next April is the 50th anniversary of the fall of Saigon,” he said.
“The Vietnamese want to control that narrative 100%. There are a lot of
sensitivities.”</p>
<p>Along with the Fulbright incident, Phuong pointed to recent uproar
around Vietnamese celebrities who were pictured with the South Vietnam
flag while traveling to the United States. In addition, a Vietnamese
high school student faced cyber bullying and was summoned by police
after posting in September that he wanted to leave the country and would
“probably never see the [Communist] Party positively again.”</p>
<p>“There’s extreme nationalism in Vietnam at the moment,” Phuong said.
“It’s against Western values.”</p>

The number of jobs in the U.S. solar industry last year grew to 279,447,

<a href="https://irecusa.org/census-solar-job-trends/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8y4oVUnJHGc756BUahnx-2ulysoVpLclWgRZFx7qrQmRQJYthVaLpxuaXryGBLE-n1oAJz" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new
report</a> from the nonprofit Interstate Renewable Energy Council.
Utility-scale solar added 1,888 jobs in 2023, a 6.8% increase and a nice
rebound from 2022, when the utility-scale solar market recorded a loss
in jobs. The report warns that we might not see the same kind of growth
for solar jobs in 2024, though. Residential installations have dropped,
and large utility-scale projects are struggling with grid connection.
The report’s authors also note that as the industry grows, it faces a
shortage of skilled workers.

Most employers reported that hiring qualified solar workers was
difficult, especially in installation and project development. “It’s
difficult because our projects are built in very rural areas where there
just aren’t a lot of people,” one interviewee who works at a
utility-scale solar firm said. “We strive to hire as many local people
as possible because we want local communities to feel the economic
impact or benefit from our projects. So in some communities where we go,
it is difficult to find local people that are skilled and can perform
the work.”

<h2 id="china-says-it-tailed-us-aircraft-over-taiwan-strait">China says
it tailed US aircraft over Taiwan Strait</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Beijing — The Chinese military tailed a U.S. aircraft that flew
through the politically sensitive Taiwan Strait on Tuesday, Beijing’s
army said, vowing to “resolutely defend national sovereignty.”</p>
<p>“On September 17, a U.S. P-8A anti-submarine patrol aircraft flew
through the Taiwan Strait,” Li Xi, a senior captain and spokesperson for
the Eastern Theater Command of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army,
PLA, said in a statement.</p>
<p>The PLA theater command “organized fighter jets to tail and stand
guard against the US aircraft’s flight, dealing with it in accordance
with the law,” Li said.</p>
<p>“Theater troops are on constant high alert to resolutely defend
national sovereignty and security and regional peace and stability.”</p>
<p>Beijing views self-ruled Taiwan as a renegade province and claims
jurisdiction over the body of water that separates the island from the
Chinese mainland.</p>
<p>The U.S. Navy’s Seventh Fleet said in a statement that a “P-8A
Poseidon transited the Taiwan Strait in international airspace on
Sept. 17 (local time).”</p>
<p>The statement did not mention the aircraft being tailed by the
Chinese military.</p>
<p>“By operating within the Taiwan Strait in accordance with
international law, the United States upholds the navigational rights and
freedoms of all nations,” it said.</p>
<p>“The aircraft’s transit of the Taiwan Strait demonstrates the United
States’ commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific.”</p>
<p>Taiwan’s defense ministry said in a statement “a US P-8A aircraft
passed through Taiwan Strait from south to north this morning.”  </p>
<p>“The military has monitored the situation and no anomaly was detected
in our surroundings,” it said.</p>
<p>China also accused Germany of heightening security risks in the
Taiwan Strait on Saturday after two of its military vessels sailed
through the waterway.</p>
<p>Taipei thanked Washington on Tuesday for approving $228 million worth
of “return, repair, and reshipment of spare parts” for its aircraft and
related equipment, the 16th such sale of arms to the island under U.S.
President Joe Biden.</p>

id="judge-rejects-former-trump-aides-bid-to-move-arizona-case-to-federal-court">Judge
rejects former Trump aide’s bid to move Arizona case to federal
court</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PHOENIX — A judge has rejected a bid by Mark Meadows, a former chief
of staff to President Donald Trump, to move his charges in Arizona’s
fake elector case to federal court, marking the second time he has
failed in trying to get his charges out of state court.</p>
<p>In a decision Monday, U.S. District Judge John Tuchi said Meadows
missed a deadline for asking for his charges to be moved to federal
court, didn’t offer a good reason for doing so and failed to show that
the allegations against him related to his official duties as chief of
staff to the president.</p>
<p>Meadows faces charges in Arizona and Georgia in what authorities
allege was an illegal scheme to overturn the 2020 election results in
Trump’s favor. He had unsuccessfully tried to move charges in the
Georgia case last year. It’s unknown whether Meadows will appeal the
decision. The Associated Press left phone and email messages for two of
Meadows’ attorneys.</p>
<p>While not a fake elector in Arizona, prosecutors said Meadows, while
chief of staff, worked with other Trump campaign members to submit names
of fake electors from Arizona and other states to Congress in a bid to
keep Trump in office despite his November 2020 defeat. Meadows has
pleaded not guilty to the charges in Arizona and Georgia.</p>
<p>In 2020, Democrat Joe Biden won Arizona by 10,457 votes.</p>
<p>The decision sends Meadows’ case back down to Maricopa County
Superior Court.</p>
<p>In both Arizona and Georgia, Meadows argued his charges should be
moved to federal court because his actions were taken when he was a
federal official working as Trump’s chief of staff and that he has
immunity under the supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution, which says
federal law trumps state law.</p>
<p>Arizona prosecutors said Meadows’ electioneering efforts weren’t part
of his official duties at the White House.</p>
<p>Meadows last year tried to get his Georgia charges moved but his
request was rejected by a judge whose ruling was later affirmed by an
appeals court. Meadows has since asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review
the ruling.</p>
<p>The Arizona indictment says Meadows confided to a White House staff
member in early November 2020 that Trump had lost the election.
Prosecutors say Meadows also had arranged meetings and calls with state
officials to discuss the fake elector conspiracy.</p>
<p>Meadows and other defendants are seeking a dismissal of the Arizona
case.</p>
<p>Meadows’ attorneys said nothing their client is alleged to have done
in Arizona was criminal. They said the indictment consists of
allegations that he received messages from people trying to get ideas in
front of Trump — or “seeking to inform Mr. Meadows about the strategy
and status of various legal efforts by the president’s campaign.”</p>
<p>In all, 18 Republicans were charged in late April in Arizona’s fake
electors case. The defendants include 11 Republicans who had submitted a
document falsely claiming Trump had won Arizona, another Trump aide and
five lawyers connected to the former president.</p>
<p>In August, Trump’s campaign attorney Jenna Ellis, who worked closely
with former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, signed a cooperation
agreement with prosecutors that led to the dismissal of her charges.
Republican activist Loraine Pellegrino became the first person to be
convicted in the Arizona case when she pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor
charge and was sentenced to probation.</p>
<p>The remaining defendants have pleaded not guilty to the forgery,
fraud and conspiracy charges in Arizona.</p>
<p>Trump wasn’t charged in Arizona, but the indictment refers to him as
an unindicted coconspirator.</p>
<p>The 11 people who were nominated to be Arizona’s Republican electors
met in Phoenix on Dec. 14, 2020, to sign a certificate saying they were
“duly elected and qualified” electors and claimed Trump had carried the
state.</p>
<p>A one-minute video of the signing ceremony was posted on social media
by the Arizona Republican Party at the time. The document was later sent
to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored.</p>
<p>Prosecutors in Michigan, Nevada, Georgia and Wisconsin have also
filed criminal charges related to the fake electors scheme.</p>

id="next-generation-of-buffetts-is-poised-to-become-one-of-the-biggest-forces-in-philanthropy">Next
generation of Buffetts is poised to become one of the biggest forces in
philanthropy</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>OMAHA, Neb. — The next generation of Buffetts — Howard, Susie and
Peter — is poised to become one of the most powerful forces in
philanthropy when their 94-year-old father, the legendary businessman
and leader of Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett, eventually passes
away.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t always going to be that way.</p>
<p>Buffett announced in June that he would donate his fortune, now
valued at nearly $144 billion, to a charitable trust managed by his
three children when he dies, instead of giving it to the Gates
Foundation, as he indicated 18 years ago.</p>
<p>The next generation of Buffetts will then have 10 years to give the
money away, Warren Buffett said.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the elder Buffett continues to make huge annual
donations to the Gates Foundation and his four family foundations, which
will continue throughout his lifetime. He first mentioned plans for a
new charitable trust in November.</p>
<p>Howard Buffett told The Associated Press he’s learned what his father
told him and his siblings about philanthropy was true: “It’s not so easy
to give away money if you want to do it smart, if you want to be
intelligent about it.”</p>
<p>The middle Buffett child, Howard said his father is as sharp as ever
and that he hopes he lives a long time, adding: “It’s pretty amazing
that he’s giving us this opportunity.”</p>
<p>Buffett has entrusted Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates with
significant annual gifts to their foundation since 2006 — a remarkable
$43 billion to date.</p>
<p>“Wealthy people don’t tend to give their money to other people to
give away,” said James Ferris, founding director of The Center on
Philanthropy and Public Policy at the University of Southern California.
But many of the wealthiest people are also hesitant to hand over their
fortunes to the next generation over concerns that it hampers their
ingenuity, he said.</p>
<p>Ferris thinks the story of Buffett’s changing philanthropic
intentions is a positive one. “It shows how a donor is making choices
and is adapting to circumstances,” he said.</p>
<p>The Gates Foundation did not say when it learned of Buffett’s
decision or what the impact will be on its budget. It previously said in
a statement that “Warren Buffett has been exceedingly generous,” and
that he has “played an invaluable role in championing and shaping the
foundation’s work to create a world where every person can live a
healthy, productive life.”</p>
<p>Over the years, Buffett gave the Gates Foundation large annual
donations, but also donated billions to foundations run by his three
children and a fourth family foundation. Their work offers some insight
into the priorities of the next generation of Buffetts.</p>
<p>The Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, named after Warren Buffett’s
first wife, is the largest in terms of donations. It supports
organizations that provide reproductive health care and access to
contraception and abortion around the world. Susie Buffett, 71, is its
board chair and Peter Buffett, 66, is a board member.</p>
<p>Susie Buffett also leads The Sherwood Foundation, a major supporter
of early childhood development nationally that gives grants to
organizations and projects within Omaha, Nebraska, the Buffetts’
hometown.</p>
<p>Peter Buffett’s NoVo Foundation has been an important funder of
organizations advocating for the autonomy of girls and women and against
gender-based violence. In 2020, Peter and his wife, Jennifer, decided to
reorient their focus, expanding their support for Native American
communities and projects to build sustainable, local communities with a
focus on agriculture and food access.</p>
<p>The Howard G. Buffett Foundation has focused on conflict mitigation
and agriculture around the world. Since 2022, it has donated some $800
million — more than most countries — to humanitarian initiatives in
Ukraine during the country’s war with Russia. These include supporting
food distribution at schools, demining activities, and the rebuilding of
a major publishing company and a key bridge transporting grain.</p>
<p>In a relatively rare interview for a family that seldom makes time to
speak with the media, Howard Buffett, 69, said he couldn’t predict
exactly how he and his siblings would give away their father’s fortune.
However, he said they would continue to take risks and find ways to make
the biggest difference as their father recommended.</p>
<p>“I can tell you, we’ll sit down in a room when the time comes, and
we’ll get it figured out pretty quickly,” he said, acknowledging that
the directive to donate all the money within 10 years was a
challenge.</p>
<p>The siblings’ different ways of thinking and approaches to giving are
assets, he said.</p>
<p>“What this is going to do is we’re going to bring all of our
collective experience together,” he said.</p>
<p>But don’t expect to find the family name on a lot of buildings, which
the siblings have largely avoid even as they’ve given away more than $15
billion of their father’s money since 2006.</p>
<p>Kathleen Enright, president and CEO of the Council on Foundations,
said the Buffetts have effectively made philanthropy a family business,
with the next generation now seasoned donors who have built enduring
institutions in their foundations.</p>
<p>“It is a big deal,” she said, of the amount of money that the
Buffetts are poised to give away, noting that because the fortune will
likely continue to grow, they will have to give away highly visible sums
to spend it down.</p>
<p>The tight timeframe to give away his fortune after his death reflects
one of Warren Buffett’s longstanding conditions for receiving charitable
funding. He has instructed the Gates Foundation and his family’s
foundations to grant out the full amount they received within a
year.</p>
<p>The next generation of Buffetts have run their foundations with tiny
staffs — much like how Warren Buffett oversees his massive Berkshire
Hathaway conglomerate with only about two dozen people at its
headquarters in Omaha.</p>
<p>Howard Buffett said his foundation employs just 22 staff members. It
granted $458.1 million in 2023, according to tax documents. He
acknowledged that his “lean” staff puts some limits on their capacity,
but said the way they’ve scaled their work is through creating strong
and enduring relationships with other organizations to help implement

will ‘continue to push’ for release of detainees in China, State
Department says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — On Monday, after the U.S. State Department announced the
release of David Lin, an American pastor, from nearly two decades of
imprisonment in China, officials said more work remains to secure the
freedom of other Americans held in China. </p>
<p>U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters that
the U.S. government had been working to secure Lin’s release for some
time. </p>
<p>“When it comes to David Lin, we are glad to see he is released. We
welcome it. We’ll continue to push the release of other Americans,”
Miller said during a regular press briefing.</p>
<p>Lin, 68, was detained in 2006 after entering China. He was later
convicted of contract fraud and given a life sentence in 2009. After
Chinese courts reduced his sentence, he was set to be released from
Beijing in 2029.</p>
<p>Bob Fu, a pastor and founder of ChinaAid, a nonprofit dedicated to
religious freedom in China, called the original charges against Lin a
“scam” and said they were facilitated by the Chinese government as a
gambit to unjustly take hostages.</p>
<p>The imprisonment and now release of Lin, Fu told VOA, is especially
significant as China is increasingly cracking down on religious
practices within the country, with human rights violations in Xinjiang
and Tibet and growing governmental restrictions on Christian
traditions. </p>
<p>Despite this, Fu said that the success of Lin’s release could be
attributed to two factors: the souring of the global public opinion on
China and the hard work of U.S. officials.</p>
<p>“This shows that if our top political leaders really take this
seriously and persistently, it will bear fruits for our citizens’
freedom,” he said.</p>
<p>According to the Dui Hua Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to freeing
detainees through dialogue with China, over 200 American nationals in
China under coercive measures, including wrongful detentions and exit
bans.</p>
<p>The State Department has listed two other detained individuals as
priority cases: Businessman Kai Li, accused of espionage in 2016, and
Mark Swidan, convicted of drug trafficking in 2019.</p>
<p>“We’ll continue to push the release of other Americans,” Miller said.
“It’s something that we have been working on for some time.”</p>
<p>Miller declined to say if Lin’s release had been the result of a
swap, according to a report by Reuters.</p>
<p>China’s embassy in Washington declined to comment when asked if
Beijing had received anything from the U.S. in return for Lin’s release,
according to Reuters. The embassy also told Reuters that Chinese
authorities handle criminal suspects in accordance with the law and
“treat them equally regardless of their nationality.”</p>
<p>Later this week, a U.S. congressional hearing is set to be held on
Americans who have been arbitrarily imprisoned in China.</p>

says it’s weighing temporary layoffs to save cash during machinists
strike</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>seattle — Boeing plans to freeze hiring and reduce travel and is
considering temporary layoffs to save cash during a factory worker
strike that began last week, the company told employees Monday. </p>
<p>The company said the moves, which include reduced spending on
suppliers, were necessary because “our business is in a difficult
period.” </p>
<p>Chief financial officer Brian West detailed 10 immediate cutbacks in
a memo to employees. They include a freeze on hiring across all levels,
a pause in pay increases for managers and executives who get promoted,
and a cancellation of all travel that isn’t critical. </p>
<p>“We are also considering the difficult step of temporary furloughs
for many employees, managers and executives in the coming weeks,” West
said. </p>
<p>Boeing’s business is in a difficult spot, he said, adding: “This
strike jeopardizes our recovery in a significant way.” </p>
<p>About 33,000 workers represented by the International Association of
Machinists and Aerospace Workers began a strike early Friday. The
walkout came after workers rejected an offer of a 25% increase in pay
over four years. The union originally sought a pay hike of at least
40%. </p>
<p>Representatives of the company and the union are scheduled to meet
Tuesday with federal mediators. The union has started to survey its
members to learn what they want most in a new contract. </p>
<p>Striking workers are picketing at several locations around Washington
state, Oregon and California. </p>
<p>Outside Boeing’s huge factory in Everett, Washington, Nancie
Browning, a materials-management specialist at Boeing for more than 17
years, said last week’s offer was worse than the one that prompted a
two-month strike in 2008. She said that without annual bonuses that
workers have come to depend on, the proposed pay increase was more like
9%, not 25%. </p>
<p>“We just want a piece of the pie like everybody else,” she said. “Why
should we work all this overtime and bust our backs while these guys
[Boeing executives] are sitting up in their suites just raking in the
cash?” </p>
<p>The bonuses have emerged as a flash point for union members. Workers
say they range from $3,000 to $5,000 a year. </p>
<p>Boeing says it is hard to calculate bonuses in a way that is fair to
33,000 people who perform different jobs. So instead, the company
proposes to ditch the payouts and replace them with automatic
contributions of $4,160 per year to each employee’s 401(k) retirement
account. </p>
<p>Workers are bitter that in contract extensions over the past 16
years, Boeing ended its traditional pension plan and lowered health care
benefits. </p>
<p>“We want our pension back,” said Jacob Bustad, a machinist with
Boeing for 14 years who was also on the picket line in Everett. “We just
keep losing and we never gain, while the people at the top just get more
and more money. Boeing has done really good for me and my family, but
these last years have been hard.” </p>
<p>Boeing has lost more than $25 billion since the start of 2019 and
burned through $4.3 billion in the second quarter of 2024 alone as it
stood poised to post another money-losing year. The strike will delay
deliveries of new planes, which are an important source of cash for the
company. </p>
<p>Stephanie Pope, the head of Boeing’s commercial airplanes division,
cited the company’s $60 billion in total debt in urging blue-collar
workers to accept the contract offer last week. She called it the best
offer Boeing had ever made — and it was endorsed by the union’s local
president and negotiators. </p>
<p>But workers rejected the recommendation of their own leaders, which
had not happened since 1995. </p>
<p>Additional cost-cutting moves spelled out in the chief financial
officer’s memo included eliminating first- and business-class service
for anyone on travel that is deemed critical and stopping spending on
outside consultants. </p>
<p>West also said Boeing plans to make “significant reductions in
supplier expenditures” and will stop most supplier purchase orders
related to the 737, 767 and 777 airplane models. </p>
<p>After the strike started, Moody’s put Boeing on review for a possible
credit downgrade, and Fitch said a strike longer than two weeks would
make a downgrade more likely. Both agencies rate Boeing debt one notch
above noninvestment or junk status.</p>

No Running Water at Home
</h2>
<p>
For people in industrial societies, few activities demand more privacy
than washing and grooming the body. We usually do it alone, in our
private bathrooms, with locked doors. Seen in a historical context, that
is unusual. Bathing in the presence of others has been the rule rather
than the exception. As late as the first half of the twentieth century,
many households, even in the most advanced industrial societies, did not
have running water at home, let alone a private bathroom.
<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
A bathroom requires a domestic water supply, but also a sewer drain, and
an energy source to heat the water. Of course, it’s possible to have a
hot bath at home without these infrastructures. Ever since Antiquity,
the rich have built private baths in their houses. Most often, they
could do that because less well-off people - either servants or slaves -
filled and emptied their bathtubs with bucketloads of water and
collected firewood to heat them.
</p>
<p>
However, for most people, it was more practical to take their bodies to
the water rather than the other way around. For some, that meant bathing
in rivers, lakes, and springs. For others, especially in urban
environments, it meant visiting the public bathhouse.

<h2 id="is-bathing-unsustainable">
Is Bathing Unsustainable?
</h2>
<p>
Modern bathing practices are a textbook example of an unsustainable
lifestyle based on fossil fuels. Hot water production is the second
largest energy use in many homes (after space heating and/or cooling),
and much of it is used for bathing or showering.
<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>
The modern bathroom also uses a lot of water and adds extra energy use
through space heating and waste-water treatment. Building and renovating
bathrooms requires resources, too.
</p>
<p>
Sustainability advocates follow two strategies to address these
problems. The first strategy concentrates on technological solutions,
such as low-flow showerheads, water boilers heated by solar collectors,
waste-water heat recovery systems, and greywater recycling. The second
strategy counts on behavioral or social changes by questioning modern
standards of cleanliness: bathing or showering shorter and less
frequently, taking cold showers, or doing a cat wash at the sink.
<sup id="fnref1:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
These strategies are unlikely to bring much results. Many technological
fixes are difficult or impossible to install in existing buildings,
especially in cities. For example, as the number of floors increases, an
apartment building quickly runs out of roof space to install solar
collectors for all residents. On the other hand, promoting discomfort as
a sacrifice for sustainability is unlikely to engage broader
environmental practices.
<sup id="fnref1:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Communal bathing makes it easier to disconnect bathing practices from
fossil fuels.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Communal bathing could be a third approach, but it’s rarely mentioned.
That’s remarkable because, in terms of resource efficiency, it’s hard to
beat. Building and operating a bathhouse for 1,000 people requires much
less energy than building and operating 1,000 individual bathrooms. A
public bathhouse is also more efficient concerning materials, money, and
space.
<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Just as importantly, public bathing makes applying the sustainable
technologies mentioned above more feasible. That further reduces energy
consumption and makes it possible to disconnect bathing practices from
fossil fuels. Finally, a public bathhouse can achieve significantly
improved sustainability without promoting discomfort. On the contrary,
pooling resources to build something for a community rather than for
every household separately allows for a high level of sustainable
extravagance. That may be an easier sell than cold showers.

<h2 id="bathing-in-rivers-lakes-and-hot-springs">
Bathing in Rivers, Lakes, and Hot Springs
</h2>
<p>
Nature has provided humans with bathing facilities through streams,
rivers, pools, lakes, waterfalls, and rain showers. Humanity spent much
time in tropical Africa, where bathing did not require artificially
heated water for comfort. When we moved into colder climates, Nature
presented us with another solution: hot springs. Many tens of thousands
of thermal springs exist around the planet — only a few present-day
countries lack them entirely.
<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup><sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Bathing in hot springs was common in ancient civilizations all over the
world. However, it’s a practice that goes back even further in time.
Archeological evidence abundantly shows that many prehistoric
settlements established themselves near hot springs.
<sup id="fnref1:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup><sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>
It’s impossible to prove rock solid that people used those waters for
bathing, but why wouldn’t they, especially in cold regions?
<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Enjoying a hot bath is a practice that predates recorded history.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Today’s bathing culture relies on fossil fuels, but if we consider the
historical context, enjoying a hot bath is not unsustainable. In the
case of hot springs, the entire infrastructure and operation — water
supply, drainage, and heat source — are already in place.
</p>
<p>
Our ancestors also invented the steam or sweat bath to take advantage of
cold water in all seasons and climates. Rather than heating water, it
heats people so they can bathe comfortably in cold water. The earliest
steam huts, from prehistoric times, were little more than small log
cabins or tent-like structures covered with woolen blankets or hides.

The Birth of the Bathhouse
</h2>
<p>
Artificial bathing facilities made from brick or stone appeared around
4,000 years ago.
<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>
They could be an open-air pool, a bathhouse, or a private bathroom. Many
bathhouses and bathing pools were built on top of natural hot springs,
modifying the natural environment to make it more convenient, safe, and
attractive.<sup id="fnref2:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup><sup id="fnref1:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>
People also began to divert water into urban bathing facilities using
canals, pipes, and aqueducts. They started building baths that used
artificially heated water as well.
</p>
<p>
The Ancient Romans are most famously associated with the public
bathhouse, although they took much inspiration from the Ancient Greeks.
Greek bathhouses comprised rooms with individual hip baths against the
walls. Sitting up straight, the bathers threw hot water over themselves
or had this done by a servant. In contrast, Roman bathers shared the
water in large bathtubs or pools. Both used steam baths as well.
<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup><sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup><sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup><sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
At the height of the Empire, there were around 1,000 public baths in the
city of Rome alone for a population of about 1 million people - one
bathhouse per 1,000 people.
<sup id="fnref2:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup><sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>
The most prominent bathhouses were the “thermae,” which could hold up to
a few thousand people bathing at the same time. These facilities, which
only appeared in the largest cities, were richly decorated with mosaics,
marble floors and pools, granite columns, and statues. However, most
Ancient Roman bathhouses were smaller neighborhood baths called
“balnea.”

The Preindustrial Bathhouse
</h2>
<p>
The public bathhouse’s history continues after the Roman Empire’s
demise. In the East, the Roman bathhouse evolved into the hammam, which
ditched the pools and concentrated more on sweating as a cleaning
method.<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup><sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>
After a sweat bath, people threw water over themselves. Reminiscent of
the small Roman baths known as balnea, hammams spread in large numbers
in all cities of the Islamic world as they facilitated bodily
cleanliness and the accomplishment of body ablutions before praying.
<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In Western Europe, many Roman baths fell into disrepair. However, the
public bathhouse returned in full swing during the late Middle Ages,
when a new period of urbanization set in.
<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup><sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup><sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>
In the 13th, 14th, and 15th centuries, a lot of European cities had a
public bathhouse per 2,000 to 5,000
citizens.<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>
Many were steam baths inspired by the hammam. A second type of bathhouse
offered wooden bathtubs to seat a small group of people. The medieval
bathhouse was known as a “stew,” which refers to the oven that either
heated water for the bathtubs or filled the room with steam.

Northern Europe and Russia - never conquered by Roman or Islamic Empires
- stuck to sweat and hot air baths. For example, public “banyas” existed
in towns throughout Muscovy during the Middle Ages.
<sup id="fnref1:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>
Asia also developed independent bathing cultures. For instance, in late
medieval Japan, people shared private hot baths among families,
neighbors, and friends for economic reasons. For these “cooperative
baths” of mostly four to ten individuals, every bather brought a portion
of firewood to heat the water. That practice evolved into larger public
baths - “sento” - which experienced rapid growth from the fifteenth
century
onwards.<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup><sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>

Bathing for Pleasure
</h2>
<p>
Nowadays, sustainability advocates who promote shorter or less frequent
showers implicitly regard bathing as a strictly utilitarian practice.
However, for most of history, bathing was never just about hygiene.
Apart from getting clean, people also visited public baths to relax,
have fun, and socialize. Rather than a quick affair, the bathing process
— no matter its form — often went on for hours.
<sup id="fnref2:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup><sup id="fnref1:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The Ancient Greeks sat together in individual bathtubs, having
conversations, for which the space’s acoustics were optimally suited.
<sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup>
In Ancient Rome, public baths were places where people went almost daily
to be seen, mingle, relax, gossip, dine, or play sports and study.
Bathers accessed beauty treatments such as massages, shaving,
hairdressing, and depilating. They celebrated parties and anniversaries
and honored foreign guests.
<sup id="fnref3:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup><sup id="fnref1:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup><sup id="fnref1:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup><sup id="fnref2:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup><sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>

<p>
The medieval European bathhouse continued these traditions with less
splendor but not necessarily with less revelry. In particular, medieval
stews with wooden bathtubs were often a place of amusement that also
furnished food, drink, music, and various types of bodily care.
<sup id="fnref2:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>
In Japan, during the 16th century, public baths became places to gather
and socialize, with large groups of people eating, drinking, and
singing.
<sup id="fnref1:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup><sup id="fnref2:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>
River bathing, which continued around cities and in rural areas until
the 20th century, was a kind of play in which swimming was a potential
element.
<sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
At the same time, bathing was considered essential to prevent and cure
diseases, following the Hippocratic ideas that people could maintain or
restore the balance of bodily fluids by exposing the body to cold, hot,
moist, or dry circumstances. The layout of preindustrial baths reflected
these ideas, featuring pools and spaces of different temperatures.

Communal Luxury
</h2>
<p>
While these elements of pleasure, social interaction, and health
continue today in mineral spas, there is a crucial difference with
earlier bathing practices. The present-day spa is far too expensive to
substitute for a private bathroom. In contrast, the historical public
bathhouse was an egalitarian institution.
</p>
<p>
Roman public baths had no or low entrance fees and were open to
everyone. There were no areas reserved for higher-ranking patrons.
Combined with the splendid architecture and opulent decoration of the
baths, this ensured that even the most humble servant would have a taste
of luxury.
<sup id="fnref5:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup><sup id="fnref2:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup><sup id="fnref2:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>
These customs continued into the European Middle Ages and were shared by
bathing cultures across the world.
<sup id="fnref3:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>
For example, in Japan, the bathhouse aided in “slowly deconstructing the
existing social hierarchy and created a new cultural flow between the
elite and the commoners.”
<sup id="fnref3:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup><sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The only separation happened between men and women, and it was far from
universal across space and time. They would either go to different
bathhouses, occupy different sections, or share the same spaces at
different times of the day or the week.

<h2 id="the-fuel-use-of-roman-bathhouses">
The Fuel Use of Roman Bathhouses
</h2>
<p>
How sustainable was that communal luxury? Most research about the energy
use of bathhouses concerns Ancient Roman baths. Historians have
sometimes faulted the large bathhouses from the Empire for their
wastefulness, arguing that their widespread use caused deforestation.
<sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup><sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup><sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup>
However, in recent years, archeological research, thermal analysis, and
heat transfer studies have made it increasingly clear that Ancient Roman
bathhouses, in spite of their opulence, were remarkably energy-efficient
buildings.
<sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup><sup id="fnref1:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The first reason was the hypocaust system. It consisted of one or more
underground furnaces that distributed hot air under the floor and into
the hollow walls (some baths had heated ceilings, too). Because of the
large radiant surfaces, the spaces in the building could be heated at a
lower temperature, saving energy. Although the water for the pools was
reheated periodically in an insulated boiler close to the furnace, the
heat in the floors and the walls helped to keep it warm for an extended
period.
<sup id="fnref1:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup><sup id="fnref2:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
A study of the Stabian Baths, one of the oldest surviving thermae, shows
a fuel consumption of between 5 and 8 kg of firewood per hour, depending
on the season.
<sup id="fnref2:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup><sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup>
That corresponds to a wood supply of slightly more than 60 ash trees per
year, which was unlikely to cause deforestation.
<sup id="fnref3:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>
Firewood consumption was probably even lower because Roman baths
routinely supplemented wood with other locally available fuels, often
waste products: reeds, harvest by-products (olive pits, orchard
trimmings, chaff), and animal wastes (dung and bones).
<sup id="fnref3:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Many Roman baths were heated almost exclusively by solar energy on sunny
days.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Following the same methodology, a study of a later bathing complex - the
Forum Baths in Ostia - shows that the Romans continued improving their
bathhouses’ energy efficiency.
<sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup><sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup>
The Forum Baths were three times larger than the Stabian Baths - 923m2
versus 310m2 of heated spaces - but their calculated annual wood
consumption is not even twice as high: roughly 100 trees per year.
<sup id="fnref1:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup><sup id="fnref4:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>
The newer bathhouse had thicker walls (two meters instead of one meter),
as well as much larger glazed windows, which increased the share of
solar radiation.
<sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup>
Earlier research has shown that the Forum baths were heated almost
exclusively by solar energy on sunny days.
<sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The studies above assume that the Romans heated their baths for 24 hours
daily and only shut them down for maintenance. Roman bathhouses likely
continued to be heated through the night, as it was more practical and
energy-efficient. Many baths were open daily, and it could take a whole
day to heat them from a cold state. In later centuries, medieval stews
and hammams often used the heat or the ashes of the furnace to bake
bread and other foods at night.
<sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup>
Hammams and medieval stews were less energy-efficient than Roman baths.
Hammams had heated floors but no heated walls and few windows, while
medieval stews often had none of these.

<h2 id="roman-bathhouse-versus-private-shower">
Roman Bathhouse Versus Private Shower
</h2>
<p>
How does the energy use of the Roman bathhouse compare to that of the
modern shower? Academic research does not provide an answer, but a quick
calculation shows that the Roman bathing experience, which lasted for
hours, was more energy-efficient than the present-day private shower,
which lasts, on average, 9 minutes. The daily energy use of the Forum
baths corresponds to the daily energy use of 557 showers.
<sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup>
While we don’t know how many people visited the Forum Baths daily, they
likely surpassed that number: the baths could host up to 500 bathers
simultaneously.
<sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>

energy-efficient than the present-day private shower, which lasts, on
average, 9 minutes.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Furthermore, in the calculation above, the energy use for the shower
only concerns water heating, while the fuel use for the public baths
also - and mainly - includes space heating.
<sup id="fnref5:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>
For example, assuming that the water in the pools of the Stabian baths
was changed only once per day, heating the water accounted for less than
10% of the total energy use, corresponding to the energy use of only 52
showers. The low energy use for water heating is partly explained by the
excellent thermal insulation of the heated floors and walls, meaning
that space and water heating cannot be separated. However, it is also
because the Romans shared the water in pools, while every shower
requires freshly heated water.
</p>
<p>
The Roman bathhouse also compares favorably to the typical backyard
sauna, for which the fuel consumption hovers between 5 and 15kg of
firewood per session.
<sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup>
Only sixteen such sauna sessions require as much fuel as the Stabian
baths used daily. The sauna has no heated floor and walls. Furthermore,
historically, it was often built partly underground to save fuel, but
nowadays, it’s usually a badly insulated building standing in a cold
climate.

The Public Baths of the Industrial Revolution
</h2>
<p>
Bathing practices have changed quite a lot since Roman and late medieval
times, particularly in most of the Western world. Few of us will have
the time or even the need to linger in a bathhouse for several hours
daily, and some of us may feel uncomfortable bathing in public.
<sup id="fnref1:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>
However, a bathhouse can also take a form more in line with modern
bathing habits. The public bathhouse of the Industrial Revolution
demonstrates this.
</p>
<p>
In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, cities received large
numbers of immigrants who came to work in factories. Most of these
people were housed in overcrowded tenement buildings without running
water, leading to unsanitary conditions.
<sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup>
Recurring epidemics and new medical insights led to a “gospel of
cleanliness” that resulted in a new wave of public bathhouses across the
Western world. Many of these baths only disappeared between the 1950s
and 1980s.
</p>
<p>
The public hygiene movement began in England and peaked there in the
1840s. By 1896, more than 200 municipalities in Britain were maintaining
public baths. The English bathhouse emulated the splendor of Roman baths
in its architecture and decoration: it was “large, handsome, and
costly.”
<sup id="fnref1:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup>
However, it did not copy the Ancient bathing customs. It now reserved
different sections of the bathhouse for different social classes.
Furthermore, while the pools still provided social interaction, the
bathtubs were now placed in individual compartments. Finally, the modern
bathhouse instituted maximum time limits for using the pool and the
bathtubs.

The Shower Bathhouse
</h2>
<p>
Germany, the first to follow the British on the continent, also built
monumental bathhouses.
<sup id="fnref:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup>
However, in the 1880s, Berlin physician Oscar Lasser argued that the
large baths were too costly to build in the necessary numbers. He
proposed the introduction of smaller bathhouses with nothing but showers
in individual compartments. Until then, the shower was only attached to
a bathtub or used in barracks and prisons, where soldiers and inmates
were showered with cold water.
<sup id="fnref1:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup><sup id="fnref3:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup><sup id="fnref3:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The shower bathhouse became the dominant public bath type in most of
Western Europe and also in North America, where the sanitary reform
movement took off in the 1890s.
<sup id="fnref:50"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">50</a></sup><sup id="fnref:51"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup>
It cleared away the last vestiges of the Ancient bathing culture by
ditching the pools and switching to a more practical architecture. For
better or worse, the public bathhouse from the Industrial Revolution was
the “antithesis of the preindustrial bathhouse.”
<sup id="fnref1:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup>
Although bathers still made use of communal infrastructure, there was no
more space for pleasure, social interaction, public nakedness, and
social mixing.

<blockquote>

As the higher social classes gradually gained access to their private
water supply and bathrooms, the public bath became increasingly
associated with poverty. Although shower bathhouses did not have
separate sections for different social classes, they were mainly built
in low-income neighborhoods, aimed at the poor only. Bathers were led to
their shower cubicle by an attendant, who opened the tap, decided on the
water temperature, and started a timer. People had at most 20 minutes to
undress, shower, and dress
again.<sup id="fnref4:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup><sup id="fnref2:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup>

Bring Back the Public Bathhouse?
</h2>
<p>
In Europe and North America, the public bathhouse disappeared once
everyone got their private bathroom - although we still bathe together
in sports centers and continue using communal bathrooms in hostels or
campings. The public bathhouse survives elsewhere but is in decline
almost everywhere. For example, Cairo had only eight hammams in 2000,
compared to more than seventy at the beginning of the 19th
century.<sup id="fnref:52"><a href="#fn:52" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">52</a></sup><sup id="fnref:53"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">53</a></sup>
In 1968, greater Tokyo boasted 2,687 public bathhouses. In 2022, only
462 were left.
<sup id="fnref:54"><a href="#fn:54" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">54</a></sup><sup id="fnref:55"><a href="#fn:55" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">55</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Historically, the bathhouse was born out of the need for efficiency:
bathing was too resource-intensive to organize individually. That is no
longer the case thanks to the advance of central infrastructures -
fossil fuels, electricity, water supply, sewers. However, in the context
of the present environmental crisis, the resource efficiency of the
public bathhouse has become relevant once again. It’s a solution that
could reduce energy use relatively quickly without the need for new
technologies or sacrificing comfort. Resilience is another argument for
the bathhouse.

What Type of Public Bathhouse Do We Want?
</h2>
<p>
The metamorphosis of the public bath in the 19th and 20th centuries,
which also affected public baths outside the Western world, presents a
challenge to anyone wanting to revive public bathing for sustainability.
What type of bathhouse do we want? Of course, the Roman bath and the
shower bathhouse are both extremes, and many intermediate forms are
imaginable. Nevertheless, any designer of a future bathhouse will have
to make decisions that are likely to be controversial.
</p>
<p>
For example, one could argue that the shower bathhouse not only fits
modern bathing practices but also maximizes resource efficiency. That is
especially true when the government, rather than the bather, controls
shower duration and water temperature. In that way, the public bathhouse
could become a technology to enforce frugality upon the whole
population. However, to put it mildly, such an approach is unlikely to
generate enthusiasm for reviving public bathhouses. Neither does it do
much to improve social interaction.
<sup id="fnref:57"><a href="#fn:57" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">57</a></sup>
</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>
Advocating for the return of the preindustrial public bathhouse, which
centers around social interaction and communal luxury, may be more
successful in luring people away from their private bathrooms, but it
also runs into obstacles. The public bathhouse has faced resistance for
2,000 years, mostly because of conflicting views about health and
morals.
<sup id="fnref:58"><a href="#fn:58" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">58</a></sup>
For example, concerns about debauchery and prostitution - real and
imagined - run throughout the history of the bathhouse in all cultures.
<sup id="fnref:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">59</a></sup>
Separating males and females does not fully address those worries.

<p>
Any plea for reviving public baths will also have to deal with the fear
of contagious disease. For example, a “lockdown” of society, as many
governments applied during the coronavirus pandemic in 2020 and 2021, is
incompatible with public bathhouses. Such a measure only works when
everybody has a private bathroom.
<sup id="fnref:60"><a href="#fn:60" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">60</a></sup>
The link between communal bathing and health is complex. Science has
confirmed many of the health benefits of cold, hot, and steam baths and
has also shown the importance of social interaction. However, bringing
people together will always raise health risks, too.
</p>
<h2 id="how-to-build-a-low-tech-bathhouse">
How to Build a Low-tech Bathhouse?
</h2>
<p>
There’s another distinction between bathhouses built before and after
the Industrial Revolution: preindustrial baths worked with renewable
fuels, while industrial baths ran on fossil fuels. Many modern
bathhouses had an on-site coal power plant, which heated the space and
the water and provided electricity for lighting. Fossil fuel-powered
bathhouses are more energy efficient than fossil fuel-powered private
bathrooms, but we can do better than that.
</p>
<p>
A large bathhouse heated by a hypocaust system and large windows is
still hard to beat as a carbon neutral technology, at least based on
sustainable wood production.
<sup id="fnref:61"><a href="#fn:61" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">61</a></sup><sup id="fnref:62"><a href="#fn:62" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">62</a></sup>
However, biomass combustion creates air pollution, while we could also
power a bathhouse with renewable energy sources that don’t have that
problem. The most apparent solution for space and water heating is flat
plate solar collectors in which the sun heats water. Heat-generating
windmills are a low-tech alternative to solar thermal collectors in less
sunny climates.
<sup id="fnref:63"><a href="#fn:63" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">63</a></sup>
Other potential heat sources are geothermal energy and factory waste
heat.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Fossil fuel-powered bathhouses are more energy efficient than fossil
fuel-powered private bathrooms, but we can do better than that.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
A solar or wind-powered bathhouse’s biggest drawback is its dependency
on favorable weather conditions. To compensate for that, solar or wind
power can be combined with thermal energy storage, such as insulated
water tanks. Storing heat in a thermal mass for longer periods is much
cheaper and more sustainable than storing electricity in chemical
batteries. However, it requires space that only communal bathing can
offer. Steam baths and saunas are more difficult to disconnect from
biomass combustion, but some innovative examples exist.
<sup id="fnref:64"><a href="#fn:64" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">64</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Clustering bathing facilities in a shared infrastructure also creates
sufficient space for a bathhouse to have extensive heat insulation (a
decisive factor in energy consumption) and provide for its water supply
(for example, by catching and storing rainwater) as well as wastewater
treatment (for example through phytoremediation using plants).
</p>
<p>
Architects have applied some of these ideas in countries where public
baths are still used. For example, in a mountain village in China, a
community bathhouse for 5,000 people is largely off-the-grid, pumping up
its water from a well, heating it with solar collectors, and filtering
the run-off wastewater from the showers and the toilets in basins filled
with bamboo plants.
<sup id="fnref:65"><a href="#fn:65" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">65</a></sup>

<p>
However, a public bathhouse also fits the more high-tech vision of a
centralized energy infrastructure based on solar PV panels and wind
turbines that provide electricity. In such a configuration, public
bathhouses could absorb excess electricity during abundantly sunny or
windy days. Rather than curtailing the electricity from surplus solar
and wind power, we could use it to power electric heat pumps and store
the heat in the thermal mass of public baths.
<sup id="fnref:66"><a href="#fn:66" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">66</a></sup>
While this approach is less resource-efficient than off-grid bathhouses
operating without electricity, it still beats a scenario in which a
centralized renewable power grid supplies energy to many private
bathrooms.

The spread of water supply and sewer networks took a lot of time,
especially in older European cities. Before 1900, only the most
expensive Paris flats had a bathroom.
<sup id="fnref1:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup> Plumbed-in
private baths appeared in the wealthiest British households in the
1860s. Still, it was not until the 1950s that working-class homes were
routinely supplied with hot and cold running water.
<sup id="fnref2:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> In
the newer cities of the USA, installing a water supply and sewer
infrastructure was easier. From the 1870s, American plumbing outstripped
that of every other country. More than half of all American houses had a
complete bathroom in 1940. For comparison, in the whole of France, only
one house or apartment in ten had a shower or bath in 1954.

The first written reference to the steam bath dates back to the fifth
century BC, when Greek historian Herodotus compared the Scythian sweat
bath north of the Black sea to the Greek steam bath of his time.
However, it’s very likely that its origins go back to prehistoric times.
Not surprisingly, the steam bath and the hot air bath initially spread
in regions with cold and long winters: northwestern Europe, Russia,
Alaska, and Canada. It was also used by Native Americans, and spread to
Central and South America as well.

One of the earliest archeological records of human-made bathing
facilities dates back to around 2300 BC in what is now Pakistan. The
inhabitants of Mohenjo-daro, the probable capital of the Indus
civilization, built wells and drainage systems allowing for private
bathrooms in most residential buildings, as well as a large, communal
bathing pool. The private bathrooms had a 1m2 shallow platform, where
people threw buckets of water over themselves. The “Great Bath” was a
brick basin with steps on either side and a capacity for 160 m3 of
water. As the city was located in a hot desert climate, there was no
need for heating the water. Sources: Graeber, David, and David Wengrow.

The egalitarian nature of the public bath was reinforced by the fact
that people were partly or completely naked. “One stripped not only of
their clothes but also of their social rank and material wealth, which
become largely invisible”, concludes a historian of the Japanese public
bath.

The study assumes that the baths were heated for 24 hours per day and
only shut down for maintenance. The fuel used for heating up the bath
initially (calculated at 35 kg in the case of the Stabian Baths) is
added only once to the total yearly energy use. The results are also
based on the assumption that the water of the baths was changed once per
day (and thus had to be heated from a cold state once per
day). <a href="#fnref:37" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a>

Whether or not the (small) windows in the Stabian baths had glass or
shutters is not entirely clear. The study concludes that energy use is
pretty similar with both glazed and unglazed windows. However, the Forum
baths, with windows several meters high, would have required almost 1.5
times more wood to heat rooms with unglazed windows during the month of
May, and more than twice as much in the coldest
month. <a href="#fnref:40" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a>

A fuel use of 7.5 to 12 kg/hr averages at 9.75 kg/hr, which corresponds
to 234 kg firewood per day. One kg of wood contains roughly 5 kWh of
thermal energy, which brings the daily fuel use of the Forum baths to
1,170 kWh. A shower of 8.9 minutes (the average in the netherlands)
takes 2.1 kWh of thermal energy.
<sup id="fnref3:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>
Conclusion: the daily energy use of the Forum Baths equals that of 557
showers. The daily fuel use of the smaller and less energy efficient
Stabian baths corresponds to the energy use of 378
showers. <a href="#fnref:43" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a>

The energy use of a sauna is more variable than the energy use of a
shower, and I could not find any reliable academic research. The data I
use are a rough estimation based on numbers that I found on internet
forums and websites. Also note that climate explains part of the
difference in energy efficiency: the sauna is often located in a cold
climate, while most Roman baths stood around the
Mediterranean. <a href="#fnref:45" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a>

This is especially true in Western Europe, where opposition grew so
strong that the bathhouse eventually disappeared in some regions between
the sixteenth and the nineteenth century.
<sup id="fnref8:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>
The reasons for the temporal demise of bathing in Western Europe - a
unique event in world history - are controversial among historians. Some
point to the pressure of the Catholic and Protestant church, who
increasingly perceived the medieval stews as places of immorality and
sin.
<sup id="fnref1:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">59</a></sup>
Others see the cause in epidemics, or point to changing medical views -
doctors no longer considered hot water and steam healthy.
<sup id="fnref9:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>
Opposition started even before organized religion appeared. Ancient
Roman philosopher Seneca was critical of the larger Roman baths and
wrote several rants against them. He complained about the noise in the
thermae, and accused them of extravagance and hedonism. See, for
example: Moral letters to Lucilius by Seneca. Letter 86. On Scipio’s
villa.
<a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Moral_letters_to_Lucilius/Letter_86">https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Moral_letters_to_Lucilius/Letter_86</a> <a href="#fnref:58" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a>

In Ancient Rome, some bathhouses allowed mixed bathing, while others
separated male and female bathers. Prostitution was legal, but the fact
that a man’s wife had bathed with other men was a legitimate reason for
divorce.
<sup id="fnref9:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>
In Muslim Spain, substantial fines were assessed to men who either
slipped into the bathhouse on days assigned to women, or who were caught
spying through the windows of the structure. Women risked their legal
rights if they did the same. Abusing a woman in a bathhouse, even
verbally, carried the death penalty. See: Powers, James F. “Frontier
municipal baths and social interaction in thirteenth-century Spain.” The
American Historical Review 84.3 (1979): 649.667. In the Low Countries
during the middle ages, authorities distinguished “honest” from
“dishonest” stews. To maintain the quality of the “honest” bathhouses,
they abolished, mixed bathing, set rules for bathmaids, and made
prostitution in the bathhouse illegal.

There’s no doubt that public bathhouses were a vector in historical
epidemics. Medical tracts even advised against visiting the bathhouse.
However, almost all baths remained open, very likely because they were
seen as a service too essential to withdraw. At least, that was the case
in the medieval Low Countries and in the Roman Empire, see:

Moreover, the hypocaust was further improved in the middle ages, meaning
that it could be made even more energy efficient than in Roman times.

For example, researchers at the University of Stuttgart have devised a
hybrid storage system consisting of a pressurized water and steam tank
that serves as a storage for solar energy. The steam can be released in
a sauna anytime, while the water serves to heat the space. See:
Schaefer, M., et al. “Development of a zero-energy-sauna: Simulation
study of thermal energy storage.” Energy and Buildings 256 (2022):
111659.

A very low-tech example is “Solauna”, which works with solar heat alone,
basically by building a very large and well-insulated solar box cooker.
See:
<a href="https://www.biopiscinas.pt/en/solar-sauna/">https://www.biopiscinas.pt/en/solar-sauna/</a>.
“Lytefire” creates heat and steam by sunlight from mirrors concentrated
on a metal plate or a bag of stones. See:

Another example is a bathhouse in Eastern Iran, built in 2004, which
runs on two solar collector fields (195 m2 total) and two thermally
insulated storage tanks (3m3 each). The facility supplies hot water for
twelve showers and four baths, serving the hot water demands of 150
people per day. Source: Azad, E. “Design, installation and operation of
a solar thermal public bath in eastern iran.” Energy for Sustainable
Development 16.1 (2012): 68-73. Researchers are also investigating the
combined use of biomass furnaces and solar thermal collectors for
hammams in Morocco. See: Krarouch, M., et al. “Simulation of floor
heating in a combined solar-biomass system integrated in a public
bathhouse located in Marrakech.” IOP Conference Series: Materials
