it was partnering with Banana Pi to design and sell the first router […]

imitation on data from human labelers. Instead of the mysticism of
“asking an AI”, think of it more as “asking the average data labeler” on
the internet. … But

<h2 id="faqs-are-not-the-answer">FAQs are not the answer</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-30, from: Blog by Fabrizio Ferri-Benedetti</p>
<p>
Everybody loves to hate Frequently Asked Questions, or FAQs. More often
than not, technical writers pale and stagger at the sight of hefty,
unsorted FAQs, as if they were beholding a writhing mass of primal
chaos. Others value their pragmatic qualities: FAQs, they say, lower the
bar to contribution and are good fuel for LLMs and search engines. My
opinion is that FAQs pose a problem only when there’s no strategy around
their usage.

Our website has a new look! The illustrated algae-eared rabbit nav
helped solve the problem of navigating on mobile. We added a lot of
information to this wiki over the years, creating separate portals for
its evergrowing content was inevitable, we hope you like the re-design.
Some of the content has shifted, and we’ve simplified many of the pages.

Mini PCs can serve a variety of purposes. There are high-performance
models that you can use as a full-fledged desktop or even gaming PC.
There are fanless models that can be used as silent media players,
digital signage systems, file servers, or network utilities. And there
are pocket-sized models that you can easily hide behind […]

Amazon’s Fire tablets offer a lot of bang for the buck. With list prices
starting as low as $60, they’re far cheaper than any iPad, and more
affordable than most tablets from companies like Samsung, Google, or
Lenovo. Amazon’s tablets also go on sale for even lower prices at least

The first MSI Claw handheld gaming PC wasn’t very well received when it

graphics. But MSI has promised that the company’s next-gen models would

The Lenovo Legion Go has proven to be a relatively popular handheld
gaming PC since shortly after it first launched a year ago. But with
list prices starting at $700, it’s not exactly the most affordable
option around. So it’s unsurprising that Lenovo is not only planning a

<p>date: 2024-11-29, from: Glasgow Haskell Compiler</p>
<h1>
GHC 9.12.1-rc1 is now available
</h1>
<h4 class="text-muted">
Zubin Duggal - 2024-11-29
</h4>
<p>
The GHC developers are very pleased to announce the availability of the
release candidate for GHC 9.12.1. Binary distributions, source
distributions, and documentation are available at
<a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/9.12.1-rc1">downloads.haskell.org</a>.
</p>
<p>
We hope to have this release available via ghcup shortly.
</p>
<p>
GHC 9.12 will bring a number of new features and improvements,
including:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
The new language extension
<a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0522-or-patterns.rst">OrPatterns</a>
allowing you to combine multiple pattern clauses into one.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The
<a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0569-multiline-strings.rst">MultilineStrings</a>
language extension to allow you to more easily write strings spanning
multiple lines in your source code.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Improvements to the OverloadedRecordDot extension, allowing the built-in
<code>HasField</code> class to be used for records with fields of non
lifted representations.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The
<a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0409-exportable-named-default.rst">NamedDefaults</a>
language extension has been introduced allowing you to define defaults
for typeclasses other than <code>Num</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
More deterministic object code output, controlled by the
<code>-fobject-determinism</code> flag, which improves determinism of
builds a lot (though does not fully do so) at the cost of some compiler
performance (1-2%). See
<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/12935">#12935</a> for
the details
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
GHC now accepts type syntax in expressions as part of
<a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0281-visible-forall.rst">GHC
Proposal <span>#281</span></a>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The WASM backend now has support for TemplateHaskell.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
… and many more
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
A full accounting of changes can be found in the
<a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/9.12.1-rc1/docs/users_guide/9.12.1-notes.html">release
notes</a>. As always, GHC’s release status, including planned future
releases, can be found on the GHC Wiki
<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/GHC-status">status</a>.
</p>
<p>
We would like to thank GitHub, IOG, the Zw3rk stake pool, Well-Typed,
Tweag I/O, Serokell, Equinix, SimSpace, the Haskell Foundation, and
other anonymous contributors whose on-going financial and in-kind
support has facilitated GHC maintenance and release management over the
years. Finally, this release would not have been possible without the
hundreds of open-source contributors whose work comprise this release.
</p>
<p>
As always, do give this release a try and open a
<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/new">ticket</a> if
you see anything amiss.
