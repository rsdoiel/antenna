Sabalenka defeats America’s Pegula to win US Open women’s title</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Belarusian Aryna Sabalenka beat American sixth seed
Jessica Pegula 7-5, 7-5 in the U.S. Open women’s final on Saturday.</p>
<p>Sabalenka blocked out the wild cheers of the home crowd in Arthur
Ashe Stadium to break Pegula in the final game and win her first title
at Flushing Meadows.</p>
<p>A year after coming up short in the final, the second seed fought
back from a break down in both sets to claim victory and fell to the
court in her moment of triumph.</p>
<p>The 30-year-old Pegula had waited a long time to reach her first
major final but could not match her opponent’s raw power despite the
noisy backing of the New York crowd.</p>
<p>The roof on Arthur Ashe Stadium was closed because of heavy rain, and
the players traded breaks twice as they settled into the stormy affair
in front of a celebrity-packed house.</p>
<p>Sabalenka held her serve through a four-deuce 11th game and fought
through a spine-tingling 12th, mixing precision at the net with her
usual power from the baseline before breaking her opponent on the fifth
set point.</p>
<p>Pegula struggled with her rackets throughout the match, complaining
to her coaches as she seemed unable to find the right tension on her
strings, and it looked as though she would not put up a fight in the
second set when Sabalenka went 3-0 up.</p>
<p>But the American found another level and brought the fans to their
feet when she won the next five games in a furious fight back.</p>
<p>Sabalenka leveled when she sent over a forehand winner that just
kissed the line on break point in the 10th game and sought to bring a
swift end to the contest, holding serve and then applying pressure from
the baseline in the final game.</p>
<p>The tears flowed immediately for Sabalenka as she claimed her third
Grand Slam title after winning the Australian Open twice, and she
high-fived fans as she ran up the stands to share a joyful celebration
with her team.</p>

id="keyhole-a-highly-effective-windows-drm-bypass-also-present-on-the-xbox-one">Keyhole:
a highly effective Windows DRM bypass also present on the Xbox One</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>The MAS project, a group of people working on an open source Windows
and Office activator featuring HWID, Ohook, KMS38, and Online KMS
activation methods, discovered quite a neat and interesting bug in the
code responsible for licensing in Windows. In our ongoing work to bypass
Windows licensing checks, we occasionally stumble upon bugs that we
choose to keep secret. This decision allows us to preserve potential
future activation methods by avoiding bug fixes, while also giving us
valuable tools for testing or developing new methods. One such
discovery, which we’ve named “Keyhole”, turned out to be a highly
effective DRM bypass. It gave users the ability to license any Microsoft
Store app or any modern Windows edition with ease. ↫ The MAS project
There were quite a number of roadblocks to overcome here, such as
Microsoft’s code obfuscation tool, called Warbird, which was already
done by someone else, after which they could really start digging into
the code responsible for handling Microsoft Store and Windows licenses.
They then discovered that circumventing the license blocks that hold the
actual license information was dead simple – every license block is
followed by a signature block covering all the data that comes before
it. It turns out that messing with the licensing system was as simple
as… Adding data after that signature block. That was it. As it turns
out, data after the signature block isnt checked at all… and it can even
override data that came before it. Whenever two blocks of the same type
are stored together, the last one overrides all the others before it.
So, if we want to change any license data, we can just make a block for
it and put it after the signature block! This method lets us make
licenses for anything sold on the Microsoft Store, including Windows,
from any other Microsoft Store license. And since there are so many free
apps with licenses, we now had the ability to make as many as we wanted
for whatever we wanted. This bug essentially punched a hole straight
through CLiP’s DRM, so we decided to name it “Keyhole”. ↫ The MAS
project This opened up a massive hole in Microsoft’s licensing tools and
DRM, and allowed the MAS project to pretty much do whatever they wanted.
They could even do things that used to be impossible, such as
“activating Enterprise LTSC with a digital license, or even activating a
legitimate KMS server with a generic key”. Sadly, the fun didn’t last
long, as right around the same time, Cisco TALOS discovered this same
bug, reported it to Microsoft, who then proceeded to fix it. the MAS
project also discovered something else incredibly interesting, something
which further highlights the seemingly terrible lack of quality
assurance and code quality inside Microsoft. They noted that the kernel
driver responsible for licensing looked incredibly shoddy, full of what
they call “odd choices and compromises”. In fact, they soon realised
that they had seen this code before: it was a straight-up copy/paste job
from the licensing DRM found on the Xbox One. And there’s the same bug
that’s in CLiP, but in Xbox code. In fact, we weren’t too surprised to
find this, as we found that almost all of CLiP, from the XML format of
the licenses to the TLV-based license blocks, is copy-pasted straight
from the Xbox One’s DRM system. ↫ The MAS project Code reuse obviously
makes sense in some situations, but the fact Microsoft even copy/pasted
entire sections of code from the Xbox One straight into the Windows
kernel as a kernel driver seems rather irresponsible. Shouldn’t code
added to the Windows kernel and installed on billions of devices be
vetted a little better than this?</p>

Stellantis recalls 1.46 million vehicles worldwide</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Chrysler parent Stellantis said Saturday it is recalling
1.46 million vehicles worldwide due to a software malfunction in the
anti-lock brake system that can increase the risk of a crash.</p>
<p>The recall includes nearly 1.23 million Ram 1500 trucks from the 2019
and 2021-2024 model years in the United States, as well as about 159,000
vehicles in Canada, 13,000 in Mexico and 61,000 outside North
America.</p>
<p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said a software
malfunction might result in the anti-lock brake system control module
disabling the electronic stability control system.</p>
<p>The issue means the vehicles do not comply with a federal motor
vehicle safety standard on electric stability control systems.</p>
<p>Stellantis said if the issue occurs, the ABS, ESC, adaptive cruise
control and forward collision warning indicator lights will be
illuminated at vehicle start up, indicating the systems are not working.
Foundational braking would be working, it added.</p>
<p>The company said it is unaware of any related injuries or
crashes.</p>
<p>Stellantis also said Saturday it is recalling about 33,000 Jeep
Gladiator models from 2020-2024 and Jeep Wrangler vehicles from
2018-2024 due to a potential internal short circuit issue in the
instrument panel cluster.</p>

<p>Close to the U.S. capital of Washington, the rural state of West
Virginia was solidly Democratic for most of the 20th century. But now
it’s a Republican stronghold, delivering overwhelming wins for former
President Donald Trump in 2016 and 2020. VOA’s congressional
correspondent, Katherine Gypson, went to Berkeley Springs, West
Virginia, to see how the 2024 election season is playing out.

id="boeings-beleaguered-starliner-returns-home-without-astronauts">Boeing’s
beleaguered Starliner returns home without astronauts</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Boeing’s beleaguered Starliner made its long-awaited
return to Earth on Saturday without the astronauts who rode it up to the
International Space Station, after NASA ruled the trip back too
risky.</p>
<p>After years of delays, Starliner launched in June for what was meant
to be a roughly weeklong test mission — a final shakedown before it
could be certified to rotate crew to and from the orbital
laboratory.</p>
<p>But unexpected thruster malfunctions and helium leaks en route to the
ISS derailed those plans, and NASA ultimately decided it was safer to
bring crewmates Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams back on a rival SpaceX
Crew Dragon — although they’ll have to wait until February.</p>
<p>The gumdrop-shaped Boeing capsule touched down softly at the White
Sands Space Harbor in New Mexico, its descent slowed by parachutes and
cushioned by airbags, having departed the ISS around six hours
earlier.</p>
<p>As it streaked red-hot across the night sky, ground teams reported
hearing sonic booms. The spacecraft endured temperatures of 1,650
degrees Celsius during atmospheric reentry.</p>
<p>NASA lavished praise on Boeing during a post-flight press conference,
where representatives from the company were conspicuously absent.</p>
<p>“It was a bullseye landing,” said Steve Stich, program manager for
NASA’s commercial crew program. “The entry in particular has been darn
near flawless.”</p>
<p>Still, he acknowledged that certain new issues had come to light,
including the failure of a new thruster and the temporary loss of the
guidance system.</p>
<p>He added it was too early to talk about whether Starliner’s next
flight, scheduled for August next year, would be crewed, instead
stressing NASA needed time to analyze the data it had gathered and
assess what changes were required to the design of the ship and the way
it is flown.</p>
<p>Ahead of the return leg, Boeing carried out extensive ground testing
to address the technical hitches encountered during Starliner’s ascent,
then promised — publicly and behind closed doors — that it could safely
bring the astronauts home. In the end, NASA disagreed.</p>
<p>Asked whether he stood by that decision, NASA’s Stich said: “It’s
always hard to have that retrospective look. We made the decision to
have an uncrewed flight based on what we knew at the time and based on
our knowledge of the thrusters and based on the modeling that we
had.”</p>
<p>History of setbacks</p>
<p>Even without crew aboard, the stakes were high for Boeing, a
century-old aerospace giant.</p>
<p>With its reputation already battered by safety concerns surrounding
its commercial jets, its long-term prospects for crewed space missions
hung in the balance.</p>
<p>Shortly after undocking, Starliner executed a powerful “breakout
burn” to swiftly clear it from the station and prevent any risk of
collision — a maneuver that would have been unnecessary if crew were
aboard to take manual control if needed.</p>
<p>Mission teams then conducted thorough checks of the thrusters
required for the critical “de-orbit burn” that guided the capsule onto
its reentry path around 40 minutes before touchdown.</p>
<p>Although it was widely expected that Starliner would stick the
landing, as it had on two previous uncrewed tests, Boeing’s program
continues to languish behind schedule.</p>
<p>In 2014, NASA awarded Boeing and SpaceX multibillion-dollar contracts
to develop spacecraft to taxi astronauts to and from the ISS, after the
end of the Space Shuttle program left the U.S. space agency reliant on
Russian rockets.</p>
<p>Although initially considered the underdog, Elon Musk’s SpaceX surged
ahead of Boeing and has successfully flown dozens of astronauts since
2020.</p>
<p>The Starliner program, meanwhile, has faced numerous setbacks — from
a software glitch that prevented the capsule from rendezvousing with the
ISS during its first uncrewed test flight in 2019, to the discovery of
flammable tape in the cabin after its second test in 2022, to the
current troubles.</p>
<p>With the ISS scheduled to be decommissioned in 2030, the longer
Starliner takes to become fully operational, the less time it will have
to prove its worth.</p>

spy chiefs urge support for Ukraine in joint essay</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LONDON — The heads of the American and British foreign intelligence
agencies said in a joint essay published Saturday that ongoing support
for Ukraine in its conflict with Russia is essential.  </p>
<p>They pledged to enhance cooperation between their agencies and
address other global challenges. </p>
<p>CIA Director William Burns and Richard Moore, head of Britain’s MI6
secret intelligence service, wrote the opinion piece in the Financial
Times newspaper.  </p>
<p>This marks the first time the leaders of the two agencies have
co-written an essay. </p>
<p>The spy chiefs highlighted that their partnership is a cornerstone of
the “special relationship” between the U.S. and Britain.  </p>
<p>They noted that their agencies have collaborated for 75 years and are
united in opposing Russia’s aggression against Ukraine. </p>
<p>“Staying the course in Ukraine is more vital than ever,” they
wrote.</p>
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin, they said, “will not succeed in
extinguishing Ukraine’s sovereignty and independence.”  </p>
<p>They committed to continuing support for Ukrainian intelligence. </p>
<p>Russian forces are making slow progress in eastern Ukraine, while
Ukrainian troops continue their activities in Russia’s Kursk region.
 </p>
<p>Kyiv has been seeking additional air defense support from the U.S.
and its allies. </p>
<p>The spy chiefs also addressed Russian intelligence operations,
accusing them of sabotage and disinformation across Europe.  </p>
<p>Russia has denied those allegations. </p>
<p>Burns and Moore said their agencies have reorganized to confront a
growing challenge from China, which they described as the principal
intelligence and geopolitical concern of the 21st century. </p>
<p>They also emphasized their efforts to use intelligence to promote
restraint and de-escalation in the Middle East, including working toward
a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. </p>
<p>Burns is leading U.S. negotiations to resolve the conflict and
address humanitarian issues. </p>
<p>On Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged military
allies to provide more weaponry to strengthen Ukraine’s defense as
Russia continues its invasion.  </p>
<p>Speaking at Germany’s Ramstein Airbase during the Ukraine Defense
Contact Group (UDCG) meeting, Zelenskyy stressed the need for improved
air defense systems and permission to use U.S.-supplied long-range
weapons to target locations in Russia and Russian-occupied Ukrainian
territory. </p>
<p>Zelenskyy highlighted the urgent need for additional air defense
systems due to recent drone and missile attacks. </p>
<p>He noted that while some support has been provided, several promised
systems have not yet arrived. </p>
<p>U.S. policy currently restricts Ukraine from using U.S. weapons to
strike deep within Russia.  </p>
<p>White House national security spokesperson John Kirby confirmed that
the policy remains unchanged but noted that discussions with Ukrainian
officials are ongoing. </p>
<p>Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, speaking at the UDCG meeting,
reiterated support for Ukraine’s immediate needs, including air defense
and armor.  </p>
<p>He also emphasized the importance of Ukraine boosting its own defense
production for long-term security. </p>
<p>NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, in a related development,
called for continued military support for Ukraine, echoing Zelenskyy’s
appeal. </p>
<p>He stressed that a strong Ukraine is crucial for ending the war and
urged all allies to maintain their support during this critical
period.</p>

id="republican-bill-to-avoid-government-shutdown-requires-proof-of-citizenship-to-vote">Republican
bill to avoid government shutdown requires proof of citizenship to
vote</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives
unveiled on Friday their legislation to avoid a partial government
shutdown at the end of the month and fund the government into late
March, when a new president and Congress would make the final decision
on agency spending and priorities for fiscal 2025.</p>
<p>Republicans also added a hot-button immigration issue to the measure
by requiring states to obtain proof of citizenship, such as a birth
certificate or passport, when someone registers to vote. Inclusion of
the citizenship requirement is a nonstarter in the Senate, complicating
prospects for the spending bill’s passage.</p>
<p>Lawmakers are returning to Washington next week following a
traditional August recess spent mostly in their home states and
districts. They are not close to completing work on the dozen annual
appropriations bills that will fund the agencies during the next fiscal
year, so they’ll need to approve a stopgap measure to prevent a shutdown
when the new fiscal year begins October 1.</p>
<p>“Today, House Republicans are taking a critically important step to
keep the federal government funded and to secure our federal election
process,” Speaker Mike Johnson said in a statement. “Congress has a
responsibility to do both, and we must ensure that only American
citizens can decide American elections.”</p>
<p>Bipartisanship urged</p>
<p>But in a joint statement, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and
Appropriations Committee Chair Patty Murray said avoiding a shutdown
requires bipartisanship, not a bill drawn up by one party.</p>
<p>“If Speaker Johnson drives House Republicans down this highly
partisan path, the odds of a shutdown go way up, and Americans will know
that the responsibility of a shutdown will be on the House Republicans’
hands,” Schumer and Murray said.</p>
<p>It is a crime under federal law for a noncitizen to vote, or even
register to vote, in a federal election, according to the Brennan Center
for Justice.</p>
<p>Johnson’s decision to add the proof of citizenship requirement to the
spending measure comes after the House Freedom Caucus called for it in a
position statement last month. The group of conservatives, banking on a
win by Republican nominee Donald Trump, also urged that the measure fund
the government into early next year so Republicans could get more of
their priorities in legislation.</p>
<p>Some Republican leaders had wanted to pass the final spending bills
by the end of this Congress so that the new president, whether it be
Trump or Democratic nominee Kamala Harris, could focus more on getting
staffed and pursuing their own top priorities rather than dealing with
spending disagreements.</p>
<p>Republicans say requiring proof of citizenship would ensure American
elections are only for American citizens, improving confidence in the
nation’s federal election system. But opponents say the available
evidence shows that noncitizen voting in federal elections is incredibly
rare and such a requirement would disenfranchise millions of Americans
who don’t have the necessary documents readily available when they want
to register.</p>
<p>What remains to be seen is what happens if the bill passes the House
this week and the Senate declines to take it up or votes it down.</p>
<p>The bill would fund agencies at current levels until March 28,
although there’s also money to help cover additional security costs
associated with Inauguration Day and $10 billion for the Federal
Emergency Management Agency’s disaster relief fund.</p>

<h2 id="rare-copy-of-us-constitution-to-be-sold-at-auction">Rare copy of
US Constitution to be sold at auction</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ASHEVILLE, north carolina — Seth Kaller, an appraiser and collector
of historic documents, spreads a broad sheet of paper across a desk.
It’s in good enough condition that he can handle it, carefully, with
clean, bare hands. There are just a few creases and tiny discolorations,
even though it’s just a few weeks shy of 237 years old and has spent who
knows how long inside a filing cabinet in North Carolina. </p>
<p>At the top of the first page are familiar words but in regular type
instead of the sweeping Gothic script readers are accustomed to seeing:
“WE the People.” </p>
<p>And the people will get a chance to bid for this copy of the U.S.
Constitution — the only one of its type thought to be in private hands —
at a sale by Brunk Auctions on September 28 in Asheville, North
Carolina. </p>
<p>The minimum bid for the auction of $1 million has already been made.
There is no minimum price that must be reached. </p>
<p>This copy was printed after the Constitutional Convention finished
drafting the proposed framework of the nation’s government in 1787 and
sent it to the Congress of the ineffective first American government
under the Articles of Confederation, requesting that it be sent to the
states to be ratified by the people.</p>
<p>Few copies remain </p>
<p>It’s one of about 100 copies printed by the secretary of that
Congress, Charles Thomson. Just eight are known to still exist and the
other seven are publicly owned. </p>
<p>Thomson likely signed two copies for each of the original 13 states,
essentially certifying them. They were sent to special ratifying
conventions, where representatives, all white and male, wrangled for
months before accepting the structure of the U.S. government that
continues today. </p>
<p>“This is the point of connection between the government and the
people. The Preamble — ‘we, the people’ — this is the moment the
government is asking the people to empower them,” auctioneer Andrew
Brunk said. </p>
<p>What happened to the document up for auction between Thomson’s
signature and 2022 isn’t known. </p>
<p>Two years ago, a property was being cleared out in Edenton in eastern
North Carolina that was once owned by Samuel Johnston. He was the
governor of North Carolina from 1787 to 1789 and he oversaw the state
convention during his last year in office that ratified the
Constitution. </p>
<p>The copy was found inside a squat, two-drawer metal filing cabinet
with a can of stain on top, in a long-neglected room piled high with old
chairs and a dusty bookcase, before the old Johnston house was
preserved. The document was a broad sheet that could be folded one time
like a book. </p>
<p>“I get calls every week from people who think they have a Declaration
of Independence or a Gettysburg Address and most of the time it is just
a replica, but every so often something important gets found,” said
Kaller, who appraises, buys and sells historic documents. </p>
<p>“This is a whole other level of importance,” he added. </p>
<p>Washington letter</p>
<p>Along with the Constitution on the broad sheet printed front and back
is a letter from George Washington asking for ratification. He
acknowledged there would have to be compromise and that rights the
states enjoyed would have to be given up for the nation’s long-term
health. </p>
<p>“To secure all rights of independent sovereignty to each and yet
provide for the interest and safety for all — individuals entering into
society must give up a share of liberty to preserve the rest,” wrote the
man who would become the first U.S. president. </p>
<p>Brunk isn’t sure what the document might go for because there is so
little to compare it to. The last time a copy of the Constitution like
this sold, it went for $400 - in 1891. In 2021, Sotheby’s of New York
sold one of only 14 remaining copies of the Constitution printed for the
Continental Congress and delegates to the Constitutional Convention for
$43.2 million, a record for a book or document. </p>
<p>But that document was meant to be distributed to the Founding Fathers
as delegates to the Constitutional Convention. The signed copy being
sold later this month was one meant to be sent to leaders in every state
so people all around the country could review and decide if that’s how
they wanted to be governed, connecting the writers of the Constitution
to the people in the states who would provide its power and
legitimacy. </p>
<p>The auction listing doesn’t identify the seller, saying it’s part of
a collection that is in private hands. </p>
<p>Other items up for auction in Asheville include a 1776 first draft of
the Articles of Confederation and a 1788 Journal of the Convention of
North Carolina at Hillsborough, where representatives spent two weeks
debating if ratifying the Constitution would put too much power with the
nation instead of the states.</p>
