date: 2024-12-11, updated: 2024-12-11, from: Chaos Computer Club Updates

Eine Arbeitsgruppe der EU-Kommission fordert allen Ernstes Zugriff auf jede Ende-zu-Ende-verschlüsselte Kommunikation und obendrauf eine neue Form der europaweiten Massenüberwachung von Telekommunikations- und Internetdaten. Wenn diesem gefährlichen Unsinn nicht Einhalt geboten wird, kann Europa einpacken.

## POSIX Conformance Testing for the Redox Signals Project

date: 2024-12-11, from: Redox OS News

The Redox team has received a grant from NLnet to develop Redox OS Unix-style Signals, moving the bulk of signal management to userspace, and making signals more consistent with the POSIX concepts of signaling for processes and threads. It also includes Process Lifecycle and Process Management aspects. As a part of that project, we are developing tests to verify that the new functionality is in reasonable compliance with the POSIX.1-2024 standard.

## Suspicious Package Keeps on Tickin’

Skype (via Hacker News): Skype Credit is no longer available. For new purchases, check out the monthly subscriptions or make a free Skype call to anyone anytime.

## Storing Times for Human Events

date: 2024-12-10, from: Michael Tsai

Simon Willison: What&#8217;s wrong with calculating the exact UTC time the event is starting and storing only that? [&#8230;] It&#8217;s surprisingly common for countries to make decisions about DST with very little notice. Turkey and Russia and Chile and Morocco are four more examples of countries that can often cause short-term chaos for software developers [&#8230;]

## Generative Logic

date: 2024-12-10, from: O'Reilly Radar

Alibaba’s latest model, QwQ-32B-Preview, has gained some impressive reviews for its reasoning abilities. Like OpenAI’s GPT-4 o1,1 its training has emphasized reasoning rather than just reproducing language. That seemed like something worth testing out—or at least playing around with—so when I heard that it very quickly became available in Ollama and wasn’t too large to [&#8230;]

## Is ML Experience A Liability For AI Engineering?

date: 2024-12-10, updated: 2024-12-10, from: Tom Kellog blog

Yesterday I posted here about becoming an AI Engineer and made a statement that prior ML experience 
is often a liability for transitioning into AI engineering. That turned out to be quite the hot take! In this 
post I’ll incorporate feedback and try
to expand that into a more balanced take. I’ll expand on the perspective of it being an asset, as well as where 
it’s a liability.
