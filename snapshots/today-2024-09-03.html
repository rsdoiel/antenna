10 Senate Races That Will Decide the Next Few Years of Climate
Policy</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-03, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzU2NjU0MC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcyNjAyMTg3MX0.U7GbSX6GPMAeRGFVfJcTAjrJUj7KiUQkduICVv4ndKo/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
The United States Senate sits on a knife-edge. Democrats currently
control the chamber by a 51-49 margin, but they are defending more seats
than Republicans are in this election. In fact, with the retirement of
Joe Manchin and the nearly inevitable passing of that West Virginia seat
to a Republican, Democrats need to win almost every contested race in
order to keep the chamber at 50-50, which would give them control if
Kamala Harris wins the White House and Tim Walz is able to cast
tie-breaking votes.
</p>
<p>
The consequences of a shift in control for climate policy could be
enormous, not just in the legislation that will (or won’t) pass, but in
the fate of nominees to key agencies. So how are Senate candidates
confronting the climate issue? This roundup of the 10 most closely
contested races shows that while the contrasts between the candidates
are stark, for the most part, climate has been a secondary or even
absent issue on the campaign trail.
</p>
<p>
The contrasts between the candidates are unmistakeable; to take just one
example, every Democrat on this list who was in Congress at the time
voted for the Inflation Reduction Act, the most significant climate
legislation in history, and every Republican opposed it. But with the
exception of Pennsylvania, where fracking has been a major issue, and to
a lesser extent in Arizona, where Ruben Gallego often brings up the toll
of increasing temperatures, in none of these races is climate change
anywhere near the forefront of the debate.
</p>
<p>
That’s mostly because Democrats have chosen not to elevate the issue.
Though they might criticize their Republican opponents for opposing the
IRA or ignoring climate altogether if you ask them, they haven’t put
time and resources behind the criticism. You don’t see them discussing
climate in their advertising, and in most cases you won’t even find it
mentioned on their websites — or if it’s there, it merits only a brief
statement of intentions and nothing more detailed.
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, the contrast remains: All of these Democrats can be
counted on to support most or all of a Harris administration’s climate
initiatives, just as the Republicans will reliably oppose them, or
support a second Trump administration’s efforts to roll back the
measures the Biden administration has undertaken. Which is why so much
depends on where the Senate falls after election day.
</p>
<h3>
<u>Arizona</u>
</h3>
<p>
<strong>The candidates: </strong><em>Democrat Ruben Gallego</em>
vs. <em>Republican Kari Lake</em><em></em>
</p>
<p>
Gallego has been a particularly forceful advocate on one aspect of
climate change: extreme heat. He
<a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/07/12/arizona-senate-election-candidates-kari-lake-ruben-gallego/74294768007/" target="_blank"><u>told
</u><u><em><em>The Arizona Republic</em></em></u></a> that “our state
will become uninhabitable in the summer if we wait much longer to act,”
has introduced

<a href="https://rubengallego.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/gallego-watson-coleman-introduce-shade-act-combat-rising-temperatures" target="_blank"><u>bills</u></a>
to address it, and
<a href="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/4818894-ruben-gallego-biden-administration-extreme-heat-protections/" target="_blank"><u>criticized</u></a>
the Biden administration for not going far enough to confront the danger
of rising temperatures. Lake, on the other hand, dismisses any such
concern. Last summer she
<a href="https://x.com/KariLakeWarRoom/status/1684621687109885952" target="_blank"><u>accused</u></a>
Gallego and Governor Katie Hobbs of “pushing mass hysteria in an effort
to declare a climate emergency.” She
<a href="https://cronkitenews.azpbs.org/2024/07/15/arizona-republicans-skeptical-climate-change-despite-evidence/" target="_blank"><u>told</u></a>
a podcast, “Newsflash, it’s hot in Arizona in the summer,” and said
“don’t tell me that we’re in some sort of a weird heating trend … I
don’t believe that for a minute.”
</p>
<h3>
<u>Florida</u>
</h3>
<p>
<strong>The candidates: </strong><em>Democrat Debbie
Mucarsel-Powell</em>, the challenger vs. <em>Republican Rick Scott</em>,
the incumbent
</p>
<p>
When he became Florida’s governor in 2011, Scott reportedly issued an
informal
<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/2015/03/09/florida-governor-climate-change-global-warming/24660287/" target="_blank"><u>ban</u></a>
on the use of the terms “climate change” and “global warming” in state
communication. He denied the story and in recent years has
<a href="https://floridapolitics.com/archives/631617-rick-scott-climate-change/" target="_blank"><u>softened</u></a>
his previous climate denial, but he was regularly
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/florida-governor-has-ignored-climate-change-risks-critics-say/2017/09/08/04a8c60a-94a0-11e7-aace-04b862b2b3f3_story.html" target="_blank"><u>criticized</u></a>
for inaction in a state unusually vulnerable to climate impacts and has
been
<a href="https://www.lcv.org/media-center/lcvvf-names-first-member-2018-dirty-dozen-flsens-rick-scott/" target="_blank"><u>a
consistent opponent</u></a> of efforts to address warming.
Mucarsel-Powell’s
<a href="https://www.debbieforflorida.com/on-the-issues/protecting-clean-water-and-our-environment/" target="_blank"><u>website</u></a>
says she “knows climate change is real and she is ready to take action
to address the climate crisis that is impacting Floridians, their lives,
and their property,” but she’s been quiet about it on the trail.
</p>
<h3>
<u>Maryland</u>
</h3>
<p>
<strong>The candidates: </strong><em>Democrat Angela Alsobrooks</em>
vs. <em>Republican Larry Hogan</em>
</p>
<p>
<strong></strong>Former Governor Hogan is the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/larry-hogan-ira-ocean-city" target="_self"><u>most
moderate</u></a> Republican on this list, and during his tenure in
Annapolis he went farther on climate than most Republicans liked, but
not as far as state Democrats wanted. He
<a href="https://news.maryland.gov/dgs/2021/11/17/governor-hogan-announces-state-of-maryland-joins-national-climate-challenge-to-reduce-greenhouse-gas-emissions/" target="_blank"><u>committed</u></a>
the state to reducing emissions, but grappled with Democrats in the
legislature over a sweeping climate plan, eventually
<a href="https://foxbaltimore.com/news/local/sweeping-climate-change-bill-becomes-law-hogan-declines-to-sign" target="_blank"><u>allowing</u></a>
a scaled-back version to become law without his signature. Alsobrooks
<a href="https://marylandmatters.org/2024/04/02/democratic-senate-contenders-share-policy-prescriptions-for-fighting-climate-change/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>calls</u></a>
climate change an “existential threat” and
<a href="https://www.angelaalsobrooks.com/priority/climate-change" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>touts</u></a>
her climate efforts as Prince George’s County Executive, including
obtaining funding for more electric buses and creating a

program. She issued
<a href="https://www.princegeorgescountymd.gov/sites/default/files/archive-center/executive_order_5_2022.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>an
executive order</u></a> in 2022, setting a goal of making her country
carbon-neutral by 2045.
</p>
<h3>
<u>Montana</u>
</h3>
<p>
<strong>The candidates: </strong><em>Republican Tim Sheehy</em>, the
challenger vs. <em>Democrat Jon Tester</em>, the incumbent
</p>
<p>
For a red-state Democrat, Tester
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/03/24/senate-only-farmer-is-an-unlikely-champion-climate-action/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>talks</u></a>
a good deal about climate, not mincing words about the effects of global
warming (which he says he witnesses as a working farmer) and regularly
<a href="https://www.tester.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/tester-secures-more-than-4-million-to-protect-three-forks-from-flooding-and-natural-disasters/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>touting</u></a>
funding he has secured to mitigate climate effects in Montana; he gets a
<a href="https://scorecard.lcv.org/moc/jon-tester" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>lifetime
score</u></a> of 89% from the League of Conservation Voters. But he
favors carrots over sticks,
<a href="https://www.tester.senate.gov/newsroom/news-coverage/billings-gazette-tester-balks-at-bidens-climate-change-policies/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>objecting</u></a>
to some tougher pollution regulations and
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/tester-weighs-action-against-bidens-coal-leasing-plans/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>supporting</u></a>
continued fossil fuel production, including the Keystone XL
<a href="https://nbcmontana.com/news/local/tester-urges-president-biden-to-reverse-course-on-keystone-pipeline" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>pipeline</u></a>.
Sheehy is a full-on climate denier who
<a href="https://www.mtpr.org/montana-news/2024-05-15/q-a-tim-sheehy-republican-candidate-for-u-s-senate" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>rails
against</u></a> “the radical climate cult agenda” and the “woke crap” of
ESG investing. Yet the company that made Sheehy rich
<a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/republican-senate-tim-sheehy-climate-change_n_64dfa52fe4b0ee8ece70c7e6" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>markets</u></a>
its wildfire-fighting efforts as a response to climate change’s effects.
</p>
<h3>
<u>Michigan</u>
</h3>
<p>
<strong>The candidates: </strong><em>Republican Mike Rogers</em>
vs. <em>Democrat Elissa Slotkin</em>
</p>
<p>
Slotkin, a current member of the House of Representatives, has portrayed
herself as something of a climate moderate in Congress, cosponsoring
bipartisan emissions
<a href="https://lawler.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=872" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>legislation</u></a>
but
<a href="https://slotkin.house.gov/media/press-releases/statement-us-rep-elissa-slotkin-green-new-deal" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>declining</u></a>
to support the Green New Deal. Still, she often brings up
<a href="https://slotkin.house.gov/media/press-releases/rep-slotkin-stresses-climate-changes-impact-military-readiness-national" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>her
work</u></a> preparing the Department of Defense to adapt to climate
change, and has been supportive of the Biden administration’s climate
initiatives. Rogers, on the other hand, was a
<a href="https://scorecard.lcv.org/moc/mike-j-rogers" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>consistent
vote</u></a> in the House, where he served from the aughts to the
mid-2010s, against all kinds of environmental initiatives, and ridiculed
DOD climate efforts: “When we dedicate scarce defense funding to global
climate change, biofuel initiatives and social engineering experiments
with military personnel, you can almost hear the cheers and laughter of
our adversaries,”
<a href="https://www.defensenews.com/opinion/commentary/2021/06/22/the-case-for-a-defense-budget-that-focuses-more-on-china-less-on-climate-change/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>he
wrote in 2021</u></a>. While Slotkin has
<a href="https://news.yahoo.com/news/u-sen-gary-peters-joins-204453328.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>brought
up</u></a> climate on the campaign trail, neither candidate mentions it
on their website.
</p>
<h3>
<u>Nevada</u>
</h3>
<p>
<strong>The candidates: </strong><em>Republican Sam Brown</em>, the
challenger vs. <em>Democrat Jacky Rosen</em>, the incumbent
</p>
<p>
<strong></strong>Rosen has been more
<a href="https://www.rosenfornevada.com/issue/climate-change/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>outspoken</u></a>
about climate change than many Democrats on this list, and has been a
particularly strong booster of Nevada’s
<a href="https://www.rosen.senate.gov/2024/04/22/rosen-cortez-masto-help-secure-156-million-to-increase-access-to-affordable-clean-energy-in-nevada/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>solar

COP26 in 2021. Brown’s
<a href="https://www.captainsambrown.com/issues/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>website</u></a>
says, “We have been blessed with an abundance of natural resources, but
we’ve also been plagued by politicians pushing extreme left energy
agendas, like the Green New Deal, that raise prices and destroy jobs”;
he has also
<a href="https://x.com/CaptainSamBrown/status/1770549613793358256" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>criticized</u></a>
electric vehicles and incentives to increase EV sales.
</p>
<h3>
<u>Ohio</u>
</h3>
<p>
<strong>The candidates:</strong> <em>Democrat Sherrod Brown</em>, the
incumbent vs. <em>Republican Bernie Moreno</em>, the challenger
</p>
<p>
<strong></strong>Senator Brown has used his chairmanship of the Senate
Banking Committee to
<a href="https://www.brown.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/sherrod-brown-climate-change-is-here-we-must-act-now" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>draw
attention</u></a> to climate issues, including
<a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/banking-law/brown-makes-pitch-for-climate-action-by-federal-reserve-board" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>pressing</u></a>
the Federal Reserve to incorporate climate risks into its relationship
with the banking industry. He has
<a href="https://www.cleveland.com/news/g66l-2019/03/333a2374534720/in-depth-ohio-sen-sherrod-browns-record-on-13-major-issues.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>called</u></a>
climate “one of the greatest moral issues of our time,” and has long
<a href="https://www.brown.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/sen-browns-impact-act-included-in-house-climate-change-bill" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>advocated</u></a>
clean energy as a vehicle to rebuild the country’s industrial base. But
during this campaign, he has become increasingly
<a href="https://www.brown.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/sherrod-brown-will-vote-to-overturn-epa-power-plant-rule" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>wary</u></a>
of certain emissions regulations he fears will lead to job loss,
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/a-new-sherrod-brown-democrat-runs-from-climate-agenda/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>saying</u></a>

“Biden’s radical Green New Deal agenda,” arguing that achieving “energy
dominance” through fossil fuel production is vital to prosperity.
</p>
<h3>
<u>Pennsylvania</u>
</h3>
<p>
<strong>The candidates:</strong> <em>Democrat Bob Casey</em>, the
incumbent vs. <em>Republican Dave McCormick</em>, the challenger
</p>
<p>
<strong></strong>Though Casey has a strong environmental
<a href="https://scorecard.lcv.org/moc/bob-casey" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>record</u></a>,
McCormick has succeeded in making fracking a central issue of the
campaign, including
<a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/aug/16/dave-mccormick/pennsylvania-sen-bob-casey-has-never-called-for-ba/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>falsely
accusing</u></a> Casey of supporting a ban on the technique, which is
commonly used in Pennsylvania to extract natural gas. McCormick
<a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/dave-mccormick-a-rescue-plan-for-american-energy-and-the-environment/ar-BB1jtJif" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>acknowledges</u></a>
that climate change is real, but nevertheless told the
<em><em>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</em></em> he wants to “unlock oil and
gas production here at home.” (The U.S. is already the world’s largest
producer of both oil and natural gas.) In the midst of the fracking
controversy, Casey seems to have quieted his prior
<a href="https://www.casey.senate.gov/news/releases/casey-announces-264-million-for-pa-to-reduce-carbon-emissions" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>climate

does
<a href="https://bobcasey.com/issue/preserving-pennsylvanias-energy-legacy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>have
one</u></a> on “Preserving Pennsylvania’s Energy Legacy”), but he hasn’t
publicly disavowed any of his prior positions.
</p>
<h3>
<u>Texas</u>
</h3>
<p>
<strong>The candidates: </strong><em>Democrat Colin Allred</em>, the
challenger vs. <em>Republican Ted Cruz</em>, the incumbent
</p>

Cruz has long been one of Congress’ most prominent
<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fact-check-ted-cruzs-claims-about-climate-change-science/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>climate

<a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/recips?ind=E01++" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>contributions</u></a>
from the fossil fuel industry. He blames the Green New Deal, a piece of

federal agencies for “fueling youth climate anxiety.” While Allred has
<a href="https://allred.house.gov/media/press-releases/allred-votes-climate-action-now-act" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>supported</u></a>
climate action in the past, he has trod somewhat carefully on the issue
during the campaign (he

border policy spurred migrant camps hundreds of miles away in Mexico’s
capital</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Mexico City — “That’s it, dude! Done!” exclaimed Eliezer López as he
jumped up and down, throwing his arms to the sky and drawing a sign of
the cross across his chest. His joy was so contagious, his friends
started to emerge from nearby tents to celebrate with him.</p>
<p>López, a 20-year-old Venezuelan migrant in Mexico City, had reason to
rejoice: After several frustrating attempts, he was able to secure an
appointment to seek asylum in the U.S.</p>
<p>He is one of thousands of migrants whose U.S.-bound journey has
landed them in the Mexican capital, the southernmost point until
recently from which migrants can register to request an appointment to
seek asylum through the U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s mobile app
known as CBP One.</p>
<p>Since June, when the Biden administration announced significant
restrictions on migrants seeking asylum, the app became one of the only
ways to request asylum at the Southwest border.</p>
<p>This U.S. asylum policy and its geographic limits are a driving force
behind the emergence of migrant encampments throughout the Mexican
capital where thousands of migrants wait weeks — even months — in limbo,
living in crowded, makeshift camps with poor sanitation and grim living
conditions.</p>
<p>From point of transit to temporary destination</p>
<p>Historically, Mexico City has not been a stop for northbound
migrants. They try to cross the country quickly to reach the northern
border. But the delays in securing an appointment, coupled with the
danger that plagues cartel-controlled northern Mexico border cities and
the increased crackdown by Mexican authorities on migrants have combined
to turn Mexico City from a point of transit to a temporary destination
for thousands.</p>
<p>Some migrant camps have been dismantled by immigration authorities or
abandoned over time. Others, like the one where López has lived for the
past few months, remain.</p>
<p>Like López, many migrants have opted to wait for their appointment in
the somewhat safer capital, but Mexico City presents its own
challenges.</p>
<p>Shelter capacity is limited, and unlike large U.S. cities like
Chicago and New York, which rushed last winter to find housing for
arriving migrants, in Mexico City they are mainly left to their own
devices.</p>
<p>Andrew Bahena, coordinator of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant
Rights of Los Angeles, or CHIRLA, said that up until late 2023 many
migrants were contained in southern Mexican cities like Tapachula, near
the border with Guatemala. Many tried to disguise their location to
defeat CBP One’s geographic limits, but when U.S. authorities took
notice, more migrants began aiming for Mexico City to make their
appointments from there, he said.</p>
<p>As a result, there has been an increase in the migrant population
living in the Mexico City camps.</p>
<p>“We talk about this as border externalization and it’s something the
United States and Mexico have been jointly implementing for years,” said
Bahena. “The CBP One app is probably one of the best examples of that
today.</p>
<p>“These folks are asylum seekers, they’re not homeless people living
in Mexico,” he added.</p>
<p>A maze of tents and tarps</p>
<p>When López first arrived in Mexico City at the end of April, he
thought about renting a room only to realize it was not an option.</p>
<p>He earned $23 a day working three times a week at a market. Rent was
$157 per person to share a room with strangers, an arrangement that has
become commonplace in Mexican cities with migrant populations.</p>
<p>“The camp is like a refuge,” said López. Migrants can share space
with people they know, avoid the curfews and strict rules of shelters
and potentially stay longer if necessary.</p>
<p>The camps are a maze of tents and tarps. Some call their space
“ranchito,” or small ranch, assembled from wood, cardboard, plastic
sheets, blankets and whatever they can find to protect them from the
chilly mountain air and intense summer rains that pound the city.</p>
<p>At another camp in La Merced neighborhood, hundreds of blue, yellow
and red tents fill a plaza in front of a church. It’s one of the
capital’s largest camps and just a 20-minute walk from the city
center.</p>
<p>“This is a place where up to 2,000 migrants have been living in the
last year,” said Bahena. “About 40% are children.”</p>
<p>Migrants in La Merced have organized themselves, building an
impromptu pump that moves water from the public system and distributes
it on a fixed schedule, with every tent receiving four buckets of water
every day.</p>
<p>“At the beginning there were a lot of problems, lots of trash and
people in Mexico didn’t like that,” said Héctor Javier Magallanes, a
Venezuelan migrant, who has been waiting nine months for a CBP One
appointment. “We made sure to fix those problems little by little.”</p>
<p>As more migrants kept arriving at the camp, he set up a task force of
15 people to oversee security and infrastructure.</p>
<p>Despite efforts to keep the camp clean and organized, residents
haven’t been able to avoid outbreaks of illnesses, exacerbated by
drastic weather changes.</p>
<p>Keilin Mendoza, a 27-year-old Honduran migrant, said her kids
constantly get colds, especially her 1-year-old daughter.</p>
<p>“She’s the one that worries me the most, because she takes the
longest to recover,” she said. Mendoza has tried accessing free medical
attention from humanitarian organizations at the camp, but resources are
limited.</p>
<p>Israel Resendiz, coordinator of Doctors Without Borders’ mobile team,
said the uncertainty of life in the camps weighs heavily on migrants’
mental health.</p>
<p>“It’s not the same when a person waiting for their appointment […]
can get a hotel, rent a room or have money for food,” Resendiz said.
“The majority of people don’t have these resources.”</p>
<p>The secretary of inclusion and social welfare and the secretary of
the interior in Mexico City didn’t respond to a request for comment from
The Associated Press about the camps. Press representatives of Clara
Brugada, the incoming mayor of Mexico City, said the issue must first be
discussed at the federal level.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, tensions between camp residents and neighbors have
increased, sometimes leading to mass evictions of the camps.</p>
<p>In late April, neighbors from the trendy and central Juárez
neighborhood blocked some of the city’s busiest streets, chanting, “The
street is not a shelter!”</p>
<p>Eduardo Ramírez, one of the protest organizers, said it’s the
government’s job to “help these poor people that come from their
countries in search of something better and have the bad luck of
traveling through Mexico.”</p>

Is summer really over? Meteorologists would say one thing, astronomers
another, and Americans will just decide to start making things
pumpkin-flavored whenever they please. So who’s to say? And after all
the record-breaking this summer, does it really matter? So far, 2024 has
proven that climate change is as real as ever and bizarre weather is
here to stay.
</p>
<h3>
Buckle up for a ride, Midwesterners
</h3>
<p>
The heat in the Midwest last week was no joke. States including
Illinois, Wisconsin, Iowa, Indiana, and even some farther East, like
Pennsylvania, saw temperatures above 90 degrees Fahrenheit. Some cities
recorded readings in the low 100s. The intense heat came just as
children went back to school, and it was so bad in Philadelphia that
<a href="https://6abc.com/post/extreme-heat-concerns-force-63-philadelphia-schools-dismiss-early-2nd-day-week/15238637/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>63
schools had to dismiss classes early</u></a> on both Tuesday and
Wednesday. In Chicago, sports practices were canceled and other outdoor
activities had to be moved inside.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Looking Ahead:</strong> <strong>Temperatures in the region will
be up and down for the foreseeable future.</strong> Through Tuesday, the
weather will be much cooler — in the 70s instead of the low 90s.
Humidity levels will also be much lower, Paul Pastelok, AccuWeather’s
Lead Forecaster, told me. On Wednesday, temperatures will briefly climb
back up before going down again on Thursday, when a cold front settles
into the region, bringing temperatures 12 degrees below average. More
heat is in store as we go into this month, however — a long warm period
will start next week and persist through late September, Pastelok
explained.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Fall makes another appearance in the Northeast
</h3>
<p>
Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern states were under several heat alerts last
week, as temperatures rose to around 100 degrees. The U.S. Open tennis
tournament, held in New York City, was under an “extreme weather
policy,” offering more and longer breaks for players.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Looking Ahead:</strong> Temperatures have already started to go
back down and will stay well below average this entire week, according
to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s temperature
<a href="https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/archives/short_range/2024/08/27/610temp.20240827.fcst.gif" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>outlook</u></a>.
In other words, <strong>the first week of September might actually feel
like the first week of fall</strong> for those on the East coast. But
don’t get too hopeful: Temperatures will likely bounce back up soon, as
the new season is predicted to feel like a “second summer” for most of
the country.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Texas is not hellish anymore — just very hot
</h3>
<p>
Texas also had its share of back to school chaos last week, which even
led to a lawsuit. A
<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/video/video-shows-students-pleading-with-bus-driver-to-keep-windows-open-amid-extreme-heat-218101829779" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>video</u></a>
shows children in the Sealy Independent School District pleading with
their bus driver to open the windows as temperatures were above 100
degrees, but the driver refuses, saying the kids were sticking their
hands out the window; parents are alleging that the children were being
unduly punished. The battle to ensure all school buses in the country
have air conditioning has been a long one, but state-level legislation
on the matter keeps
<a href="https://lailluminator.com/2024/05/22/mandatory-air-conditioning-for-louisiana-school-buses-hits-dead-end/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>dying</u></a>
due to a lack of funds.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Looking Ahead: </strong>Central and South Texas are still
covered by clouds and enjoying some rain, which means
<strong>temperatures won’t rise much this week</strong>, Pastelok told
me; other parts of the state will be warmer, but still around the upper
80s. Later in the week, though, the precipitation pattern might move,
pushing temperatures a little higher. Readings should stay below 100
degrees this week, though.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Did it just snow in California? In August?
</h3>
<p>
Last Saturday, those exploring in the mountains around Lake Tahoe got a
little surprise: a light dusting of snow in late August. While the
winter-like cold front had been forecasted for the region — including
the possibility of snow — Pastelok told me the event is still unusual
for this time of the year. More snow is certainly possible as we go into
September, but before that, California will go back to behaving more
normally. And by that, I mean being very, very hot.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Looking Ahead:</strong> <strong>“Above average temperatures will
be the general rule next week,”</strong> Pastelok said. In the Central
Valleys and lower deserts into southern Nevada, temperatures will
average 6 degrees to 10 degrees above average in most places on a daily
basis, hitting up to 110 degrees later in the week.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Those elsewhere in the West will get their share of above average
temperatures this week. The interior Northwest will start this week hot,
with highs around the 90s and running 10 degrees to 14 degrees above
average. But Northwesterners, please think twice before you start
complaining. It seems like <strong>Washington and Oregon are the only
states which will see fall weather any time soon</strong>.
</p>
<h3>
Finally, looking back: Summer 2024, by the numbers
</h3>
<p>
<strong>21,058:</strong> That’s the number of daily high temperature
records broken this year in the U.S. so far this year.
</p>
<p>
<strong>118</strong>: The number of <em><em>all-time</em></em> high
temperature records broken. While scientists haven’t officially called
it yet, it seems like 2024 will dethrone last year as the hottest summer
on record.
</p>
<p>
<strong>428:</strong> number of wildfire incidents in California this
summer.
</p>
<p>
<strong>429,603: </strong>the number of acres burned by the Park Fire in
California. The fire is now 98% contained and could become the third
largest wildfire in American history.
</p>
<p>
<strong>62.87: </strong>the planet’s average temperature on July 22,
2024, the Earth’s hottest day on record.
</p>
<p>
<strong>130:</strong> the highest temperature recorded in the country
this summer, in the Death Valley.
</p>
<p>
<strong>160,000,000:</strong> the highest number of Americans under
excessive heat warnings on the same day. It happened on July 9.

id="pitch-deck-gives-new-details-on-companys-plan-to-listen-to-your-devices-for-ad-targeting">Pitch
deck gives new details on company’s plan to listen to your devices for
ad targeting</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>For years now, people believe that their smartphones are listening to
their conversations through their microphones, all the time, even when
the microphone is clearly not activated. Targeted advertising lies at
the root of this conviction; when you just had a conversation with a
friend about buying a pink didgeridoo and a flanel ukelele, and you then
get ads for pink didgeridoos and flanel ukeleles, it makes intuitive
sense to assume your phone was listening to you. How else would Google,
Amazon, Facebook, or whatever, know your deepest didgeridoo desires and
untapped ukelele urges? The truth is that targeted advertising using
cross-site cookies and profile building is far more effective than
people think, and on top of that, people often forget what they did on
their phone or laptop ten minutes ago, let alone yesterday or last week.
Smartphones are not secretly listening to you, and it’s not through
covert microphone activation that it knows about your musical interests.
But then. Media conglomerate Cox Media Group has been pitching tech
companies on a new targeted advertising tool that uses audio recordings
culled from smart home devices. The existence of this program
was revealed late last year. Now, however, 404 Media has also gotten its
hands on additional details about the program through a leaked pitch
deck. The contents of the deck are creepy, to say the least. Cox’s tool
is creepily called “Active Listening” and the deck claims that it works
by using smart devices, which can “capture real-time intent data by
listening to our conversations.” After the data is captured, advertisers
can “pair this voice-data with behavioral data to target in-market
consumers,” the deck says. The vague use of artificial intelligence to
collect data about consumers’ online behavior is also mentioned, with
the deck noting that consumers “leave a data trail based on their
conversations and online behavior” and that the AI-fueled tool can
collect and analyze said “behavioral and voice data from 470+ sources.”
↫ Lucas Ropek at Gizmodo Looking at the pitch deck in question, you can
argue that it’s not even referring to smartphones, and that it is
incredibly vague – probably on purpose – what “active listening” and
“conversations” are really referring to. It might as well be simply
referring to the various conversations on unencrypted messaging
platforms, directly with companies, or stuff like that. “Smart devices”
is also intentionally vague, and could be anything from one of those
smart fridges to your smartphone. But you could also argue that yes,
this seems to be pretty much referring to “listening to our
conversations” in the most literal sense, by somehow – we have no idea
how – turning on our smartphone microphones, in secret, without iOS or
Android, or Apple or Google, knowing about it? It seems far-fetched, but
at the same time, a lot of corporate and government programs and efforts
seemed far-fetched until some whisteblower spilled the beans. The
feeling that your phones are listening to you without your consent, in
secret, will never go away. Even if some irrefutable evidence came up
that it isn’t possible, it’s just too plausible to be cast aside.</p>

NetBSD</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>After covering setting up your own CDN with both FreeBSD and OpenBSD,
it’s now time to learn how to set up your own CDN wit NetBSD. This
article is a spin-off from a previous post on how to create a
self-hosted CDN, but this time we’ll focus on using NetBSD. NetBSD is a
lightweight, stable, and secure operating system that supports a wide
range of hardware, making it an excellent choice for a caching reverse
proxy. Devices that other operating systems may soon abandon, such as
early Raspberry Pi models or i386 architecture, are still fully
supported by NetBSD and will continue to be so. Additionally, NetBSD is
an outstanding platform for virtualization (using Xen or qemu/nvmm) and
deserves more attention than it currently receives. ↫ Stefano Marinelli
All the same from my previous post still applies, and it’s a great thing
that Marinelli covers all three of the major BSDs (so far). If you want
to run your own CDN on BSD, you can now make a pretty informed decision
on which BSD best suits your needs.</p>

<h2 id="the-dev-tools-performance-monitor-panel">The Dev Tools
Performance Monitor Panel</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-03, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
Weeks ago I was looking in to a performance issue for our animated
spinner component and stumbled across a tool in DevTools I hadn’t used
before:
<a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/performance-monitor">The
Performance Monitor Panel</a>. In you open <code>Dev Tools &gt; More
Tools &gt; Performance Monitor</code> you’ll see some helpful high-level
charts and graphs of the realtime performance data of your UI.
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/perfmonitorpanel.jpg" alt="The Figma.com homepage with the performance panel open to the side showing 120 style recalcs per second" />
</p>
<p>
The Performance Monitor collects performance data in realtime and puts
it on a graph. It’s handy for detecting performance problems at a
high-level. If your CPU, memory, DOM node count, or event listeners only
go up while
<a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2024/sanding-ui/">clicking
around</a>, you probably have a leak in your code. The part I was most
interested in were style recalculations per second and layouts per
second. Our spinner component was triggering style recalculations and
layout calls at a rate of 120 per second. Yikes! That’s a lot of extra
work on the CPU.
</p>
<p>
Next I turned on <code>Dev Tools &gt; More Tools &gt; Rendering &gt;
Show Paint Flashes</code> and I could immediately see the tactile
feedback of green boxes thrashing around as the browser repainted the
component hundreds of times per second. The green paint boxes confirmed
that this UI work was happening on the main thread instead of the
compositor thread. The Performance Monitor showed my CPU usage at 5-9%
of my Mackbook Pro. Double Yikes.
</p>
<p>
The Performance Monitor panel pairs nicely with the top-level
Performance panel. While the Performance Monitor panel is very
high-level, the Performance panel is an in-depth debugging tool where
you can inspect a snapshot of your app down to each function and render
call.
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/perfpanel.jpg" alt="A flame graph inside the Performance Panel in dev tools" />
</p>
<p>
Capturing a snapshot in the Performance panel confirmed what I was now
seeing. I could see the “red line of death” of dropped frames where I
locked the main thread. The remediation steps were pretty simple but I
did need to strip down and recode how our animation worked.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<a href="https://web.dev/articles/animations-guide">Avoid properties
that trigger paint or layout</a>
</li>
<li>
Tamp down layout recalcs with <code>contain</code>
</li>
<li>
Use <code>overflow: hidden</code> instead of CSS masks
</li>
</ol>
<p>
It took a couple of prototypes to shop around a workable solution. The
good news is our animation is off-loaded to the compositor instead of
the main thread now. CPU use is now at <code>0.2%</code> (down from
5-9%) and our recalcs and layouts are down to <code>0</code> but the
animation still chugs along. Truth be told, a loading spinner is a
pretty insignificant component and is only temporary, but reducing CPU
usage by 10% here makes room for other JavaScript activities… like…
y’know… fetching and parsing data.

id="decision-on-major-policy-shift-on-marijuana-wont-come-until-after-us-presidential-election">Decision
on major policy shift on marijuana won’t come until after US
presidential election</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — A decision on whether to reclassify marijuana as a less
dangerous drug in the U.S. won’t come until after the November
presidential election, a timeline that raises the chances it could be a
potent political issue in the closely contested race.</p>
<p>The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration last week set a hearing date
to take comment on the proposed historic change in federal drug policy
for Dec. 2.</p>
<p>The hearing date means a final decision could well come in the next
administration. While it’s possible it could precede the end of
President Joe Biden’s term, issuing it before Inauguration Day “would be
pretty expedited,” said cannabis lawyer Brian Vicente.</p>
<p>That could put a new spotlight on the presidential candidates’
positions on marijuana. Vice President Kamala Harris has backed
decriminalizing the drug and said it’s “absurd” to have it in the DEA’s
Schedule I category alongside heroin and LSD. The Democratic nominee’s
position has shifted over the years; she once oversaw the enforcement of
cannabis laws and opposed legalized recreational use for adults in
California while running for attorney general in 2010.</p>
<p>Former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, signaled
support for a Florida legalization measure on Saturday, following
earlier comments that he increasingly agrees that people shouldn’t be
jailed for the drug now legal in multiple states, “whether that’s a good
thing or a bad thing.”</p>
<p>During his run for president in 2016, Trump said that he backed
medical marijuana and that pot should be left up to the states. But
during his first term, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions lifted an
Obama-era policy that kept federal authorities from cracking down on the
pot trade in states where the drug is legal.</p>
<p>Trump’s campaign didn’t immediately respond to a query about his
position on rescheduling the drug.</p>
<p>The Justice Department proposed reclassifying it in May, saying the
change would recognize marijuana’s medical uses and acknowledge it has
less potential for abuse than some of the nation’s most dangerous drugs.
The proposal, which would not legalize marijuana for recreational use,
came after a call for review from Biden, who has called the change
“monumental.”</p>
<p>The DEA has said it doesn’t yet have a position on whether to go
through with the change, stating in a memo that it would keep weighing
the issue as the federal rulemaking process plays out.</p>
<p>The new classification would be the most significant shift in U.S.
drug policy in 50 years and could be a potent political issue,
especially with younger voters. But it faces opposition from groups such
as Smart Approaches to Marijuana.</p>
<p>Its president, Kevin Sabet, argues there isn’t enough data to move
cannabis to the less-dangerous Schedule III category, alongside ketamine
and some anabolic steroids. The DEA’s move to hold the hearing is “a
huge win in our fight to have this decision guided by medical science,
not politics,” he said in a statement, adding that 18 states’ attorneys
general are backing his opposition.</p>
<p>The hearing sparked some consternation among pot industry players,
though little surprise about the DEA decision to hold one.</p>
<p>“While the result ultimately may be better, I think we’re so used to
seeing delays that it’s just a little disappointing,” said Stephen
Abraham, chief financial officer at The Blinc Group, supplier of
cartridges and other hardware used in pot vapes. “Every time you slow
down or hold resources from the legal market, it’s to the benefit of the
illicit market.”</p>
<p>The proposal, which was signed by Attorney General Merrick Garland
rather than DEA Administrator Anne Milgram, followed a recommendation
from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.</p>
<p>Federal drug policy has lagged behind that of many states in recent
years, with 38 having already legalized medical marijuana and 24
legalizing its recreational use.</p>
<p>Lawmakers from both major political parties have pushed for the
change as marijuana has become increasingly decriminalized and accepted.
A Gallup poll last year found 70% of adults support legalization, the
highest level yet recorded by the polling firm and more than double the
roughly three in 10 who backed it in 2000.</p>
<p>The marijuana industry has also grown quickly, and state-licensed pot
companies are keen on rescheduling partly because it could enable them
to take federal business-expense tax deductions that aren’t available to
enterprises involved in “trafficking” any Schedule I or II drug. For
some of Vicente’s clients, the change would effectively reduce the tax
rate from 75% to 25%.</p>
<p>Some legalization advocates also hope rescheduling could help
persuade Congress to pass legislation aimed at opening banks’ doors to
cannabis companies. Currently, the drug’s legal status means many
federally regulated banks are reluctant to lend to such businesses, or
sometimes even provide checking or other basic services.</p>
<p>Rescheduling could also make it easier to research marijuana, since
it’s difficult to conduct authorized clinical studies on Schedule I
substances. Some medical marijuana patient advocates fear that the
discussion has already become deeply politicized and that the focus on
rescheduling’s potential effect on the industry has shifted attention
from the people who could benefit.</p>
<p>“It was our hope that we could finally take the next step and create
the national medical cannabis program that we need,” said Steph Sherer,
founder and president of Americans for Safe Access. The organization
advocates for putting cannabis in a drug category all its own and for
creating a medical cannabis office within DHS.</p>
<p>The immediate effect of rescheduling on the nation’s criminal justice
system, though, would likely be more muted, since federal prosecutions

of one: US restaurants cater to growing number of solo diners</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Parisa Imanirad, a scientist and cancer researcher from
San Francisco, is married and has a wide circle of friends. But once or
twice a week, she goes to a restaurant by herself.</p>
<p>Imanirad said dining alone gives her time to think or read. She tries
not to touch her phone and relishes the silence. “It’s like a spa, but a
different type,” Imanirad said during a recent solo lunch at Spruce, an
upscale restaurant in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Imanirad isn’t alone in her desire to be alone. In the United States,
solo dining reservations have risen 29% over the last two years,
according to OpenTable, the restaurant reservation site. They’re up 18%
this year in Germany and 14% in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Japan even has a special term for solo dining: “ohitorisama,” which
means “alone” but with honorifics spoken before and after the word to
make parties of one feel less hesitant. In a recent survey, Japan’s Hot
Pepper Gourmet Eating Out Research Institute found that 23% of Japanese
people eat out alone, up from 18% in 2018.</p>
<p>As a result, many restaurants in Japan and elsewhere are redoing
their seating, changing their menus and adding other special touches to
appeal to solo diners.</p>
<p>“Even so-called family restaurants are increasing counter seats for
solitary diners, and restaurants are offering courses with smaller
servings so a person eating alone gets a variety of dishes,” said
Masahiro Inagaki, a senior researcher at the institute.</p>
<p>OpenTable CEO Debby Soo thinks remote work is one reason for the
increase, with diners seeking respites from their home offices. But she
thinks there are deeper reasons, too.</p>
<p>“I think there’s a broader movement of self-love and self-care and
really … enjoying your own company,” Soo said.</p>
<p>The pandemic also made social interactions less feasible and
therefore less important while eating out, said Anna Mattila, a
professor of lodging management at Penn State University who has studied
solo dining. And smartphones help some restaurant patrons feel connected
to others even when they’re by themselves, she said.</p>
<p>“The social norms have changed. People don’t look at solo diners
anymore and think, ‘You must be a loner,’” Mattila said.</p>
<p>More people live and travel solo</p>
<p>The growth comes as more people are living alone. In 2019, the Pew
Research Center found that 38% of U.S. adults ages 25 to 54 were living
without a partner, up from 29% in 1990. In Japan, single households now
make up one-third of the total; that’s expected to climb to 40% by 2040,
according to government data.</p>
<p>Increasing interest in solo travel — particularly among travelers
ages 55 and over — is also leading to more meals alone.</p>
<p>On a recent solo trip to Lucerne, Switzerland, Carolyn Ray was
stunned when the hostess led her to a beautiful lake-view table set for
one, complete with a small vase of flowers. Ray, the CEO and editor of
JourneyWoman, a website for solo women travelers over 50, said other
restaurants have tried to seat her toward the back or pointedly asked if
someone will be joining her.</p>
<p>Ray counsels women planning to dine alone to go somewhere else if
they’re treated rudely or given a bad table.</p>
<p>“It’s almost like the world hasn’t caught up with this idea that we
are on our own because we want to be on our own and we’re independent
and empowered,” she said. “We can go into any restaurant we want and
have a table for one and feel good about it.”</p>
<p>Shawn Singh, a Houston-based content creator and restaurant reviewer,
said he eats alone about 70% of the time. If the idea of venturing out
for a solitary meal is intimidating, he suggests going to lunch instead
of dinner — when tables are usually more crowded with groups — or going
early on a weekday.</p>
<p>“The best way to see a restaurant you’ve been wanting to see for a
long time is definitely going solo,” Singh said. “If I go at 5 p.m. and
alone, I haven’t been denied at one place ever.”</p>
<p>Restaurants aren’t always thrilled to seat a single diner at a table
that could fit more. A Michelin-starred London restaurant, Alex Dilling
at Hotel Cafe Royal, caused a stir last year when it started charging
solo patrons the same price as two customers. Its eight-course dinner
tasting menu, which includes caviar and Cornish squid, costs 215 pounds
($280) per person.</p>
<p>The restaurant, which has only 34 seats, didn’t respond to a request
for comment. But its website doesn’t allow reservations for fewer than
two people.</p>
<p>‘Playing the long game’</p>
<p>Other restaurants say it’s worth seating one person at a table made
for two because solo diners tend to be loyal, repeat customers.</p>
<p>“While there may be a short-term loss there, I think we’re kind of
playing the long game and establishing ourselves as a place that’s truly
special,” said Drew Brady, chief operating officer at Overthrow
Hospitality, which operates 11 vegan restaurants in New York.</p>
<p>Brady has seen an increase in solo diners since the pandemic, and
says they’re evenly split between men and women. At the company’s
flagship restaurant, Avant Garden, they make up as much as 8% of
patrons.</p>
<p>In response, the restaurant teamed up with Lightspeed, a restaurant
tech and consulting company, to develop a solo dining program. Avant
Garden now has a spacious table designed for solo diners, with a $65
four-course menu fashioned like a passport to enhance the sense of
adventure. If solo diners order a cocktail, a bartender mixes it
tableside.</p>
<p>Mattila, at Penn State, said restaurants might want to consider
additional changes. Her research has found that solo diners prefer
angular shapes — in lights, tables or plates, for example — to round
ones, which are more associated with the connectedness of groups. They
also prefer slow-tempo music.</p>
<p>Jill Weber, the founder of Sojourn Philly, a Philadelphia company
that owns two restaurants and a wine bar, said she adds a communal table
at special events such as wine tastings so individuals have a place to
gather. She also doesn’t offer specials designed for two.</p>
<p>Weber, who is also an archaeologist, loves dining alone when she’s
traveling.</p>
<p>“There’s something about not having to agree on where to go and
everything that goes with that. You have the freedom to stay as long as
you want, order what you want and sit with those things,” she said. “It
also feels brave sometimes.”</p>

Fed welcomes ‘soft landing’ even if many Americans don’t feel like
cheering</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — When Jerome Powell delivered a high-profile speech last
month, the Federal Reserve chair came the closest he ever had to
declaring that the inflation surge that gripped the nation for three
painful years was now essentially defeated.</p>
<p>And not only that. The Fed’s high interest rates, Powell said, had
managed to achieve that goal without causing a widely predicted
recession and high unemployment.</p>
<p>Yet most Americans are not in the same celebratory mood about the
plummeting of inflation in the face of the high borrowing rates the Fed
engineered. Though consumer sentiment is slowly rising, a majority of
Americans in some surveys still complain about elevated prices, given
that the costs of such necessities as food, gas and housing remain far
above where they were before the pandemic erupted in 2020.</p>
<p>The relatively sour mood of the public is creating challenges for
Vice President Kamala Harris as she seeks to succeed President Joe
Biden. Despite the fall of inflation and strong job growth, many voters
say they’re dissatisfied with the Biden-Harris administration’s economic
record — and especially frustrated by high prices.</p>
<p>That disparity points to a striking gap between how economists and
policymakers assess the past several years of the economy and how many
ordinary Americans do.</p>
<p>In his remarks last month, given at an annual economic symposium in
Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Powell underscored how the Fed’s sharp rate hikes
succeeded much more than most economists had predicted in taming
inflation without hammering the economy — a notoriously difficult feat
known as a “soft landing.”</p>
<p>“Some argued that getting inflation under control would require a
recession and a lengthy period of high unemployment,” Powell said.</p>
<p>Ultimately, though, he noted, “the 4-1/2 percentage point decline in
inflation from its peak two years ago has occurred in a context of low
unemployment — a welcome and historically unusual result.”</p>
<p>With high inflation now essentially conquered, Powell and other
central bank officials are preparing to cut their key interest rate in
mid-September for the first time in more than four years. The Fed is
becoming more focused on sustaining the job market with the help of
lower interest rates than on continuing to fight inflation.</p>
<p>Many Americans ‘have taken a big hit’</p>
<p>Many consumers, by contrast, are still preoccupied most by today’s
price levels.</p>
<p>“From the viewpoint of economists, central bankers, how we think
about inflation, it really has been a remarkable success, how inflation
went up, has come back, and is around the target,” said Kristin Forbes,
an economist at MIT and a former official at the United Kingdom’s
central bank, the Bank of England.</p>
<p>“But from the viewpoint of households, it has not been so
successful,” she added. “Many have taken a big hit to their wages. Many
of them feel like the basket of goods they buy is now much more
expensive.”</p>
<p>Two years ago, economists feared that the Fed’s ongoing rate hikes —
it ultimately raised its benchmark rate more than 5 percentage points to
a 23-year high in the fastest pace in four decades — would hammer the
economy and cause millions of job losses. After all, that’s what
happened when the Fed under Chair Paul Volcker sent its benchmark rate
to nearly 20% in the early 1980s, ultimately throttling a brutal
inflationary spell.</p>
<p>In fact, at Jackson Hole two years ago, Powell himself warned that
using high interest rates to defeat the inflation spike “would bring
some pain to households and businesses.”</p>
<p>Yet now, according to the Fed’s preferred measure, inflation is 2.5%,
not far above its 2% target. And while a weaker pace of hiring has
caused some concerns, the unemployment rate is at a still-low 4.3%, and
the economy expanded at a solid 3% annual rate last quarter.</p>
<p>While no Fed official will outright declare victory, some take
satisfaction in defying the predictions of doom and gloom.</p>
<p>“2023 was a historic year for inflation falling,” said Austan
Goolsbee, president of the Chicago Fed. “And there wasn’t a recession,
and that’s unprecedented. And so we will be studying the mechanics of
how that happened for a long time.”</p>
<p>Measures of consumer sentiment, though, indicate that three years of
hurtful inflation have dimmed many Americans’ outlook. In addition, high
loan rates, along with elevated housing prices, have led many young
workers to fear that homeownership is increasingly out of reach.</p>
<p>‘Inflation overhang’</p>
<p>Last month, the consulting firm McKinsey said that 53% of consumers
in its most recent survey “still say that rising prices and inflation
are among their concerns.” McKinsey’s analysts attributed the escalated
figure to “an ’inflation overhang.” That’s the belief among analysts
that it can take months, if not years, for consumers to adjust
emotionally to a much higher level of prices even if their pay is
keeping pace.</p>
<p>Economists point to several reasons for the wide gap in perceptions
between economists and policymakers on the one hand and everyday
consumers and workers on the other.</p>
<p>The first is that the Fed tailors its interest rate policies to
manage inflation — the rate of price changes — rather than price levels
themselves. So when inflation spikes, the central bank’s goal is to
return it to a sustainable level, currently defined as 2%, rather than
to reverse the price increases. The Fed’s policymakers expect average
wages to catch up and eventually to allow consumers to afford the higher
prices.</p>
<p>“Central bankers think even if inflation gets away from 2% for a
period, as long as it comes back, that’s fine,” Forbes said. “Victory,
mission accomplished. But the amount of time inflation is away from 2%
can have a major cost.”</p>
<p>Research by Stefanie Stantcheva, a Harvard economist, and two
colleagues found that most people’s views of inflation are very
different from those of economists. Economists in general are more
likely to regard inflation as a consequence of strong growth. They often
describe inflation as a result of an “overheating” economy: Low
unemployment, strong job growth and rising wages lead businesses to
sharply increase prices without necessarily losing sales.</p>
<p>By contrast, a survey by Stantcheva found, ordinary Americans “view
inflation as an unambiguously bad thing and very rarely as a sign of a
good economy or as a byproduct of positive developments.”</p>
<p>Her survey respondents also said they believed that inflation stems
from excessive government spending or greedy businesses. They “do not
believe that (central bank) policymakers face trade-offs, such as having
to reduce economic activity or increase unemployment to control
inflation.”</p>
<p>Perceived recession</p>
<p>As a result, few consumers probably worried about the potential for a
downturn as a result of the Fed’s rate hikes. One opinion survey, in
fact, found that many consumers believed, incorrectly, that the economy
was in a recession because inflation was so high.</p>
<p>At the Jackson Hole conference, Andrew Bailey, governor of the Bank
of England, argued that central banks cannot guarantee that high
inflation will never appear — only that they will try to drive it back
down when it does.</p>
<p>“I get this question quite often in Parliament,” Bailey said. “People
say, ‘Well you failed to control inflation.’ I said no.”</p>
<p>The test of a central bank, he continued, “is not that we will never
have inflation. The test of the regime is how well, once you get hit by
these shocks, you bring it back to target.”</p>
<p>Still, Forbes suggested that there are lessons to be learned from the
post-COVID inflation spike, including whether inflation was allowed to
stay too high for too long, both in the U.S. and the U.K. The Fed has
long been criticized for having taken too long to start raising its
benchmark rate. Inflation first spiked in the spring of 2021. Yet the
Fed, under the mistaken impression that high inflation would prove
“transitory,” didn’t begin raising rates until nearly a year later.</p>
<p>“Maybe should we rethink … where we seem to be now: ‘As long as it
comes back four to five years later, that’s fine,’” she said. “Maybe
four to five years is too long.</p>
<p>“How much unemployment or slowdown in growth should we be willing to
accept to shorten the length of time that inflation is too high?”</p>

average of 15,

<li>The first-drive reviews of Volvo’s EX90 SUV are in</li>
</ol>
</h3>
<p>
Today seems to be the day everyone is publishing their first-drive
reviews of the Volvo EX90, the company’s new flagship all-electric SUV.
The long-delayed, three-row vehicle starts at a base price of $82,290,
and has a range between 296 and 308 miles. It’s being manufactured in
South Carolina and U.S. deliveries are expected toward the end of 2024.
Here’s a distilled version of what everyone is saying:
</p>
<p>
<strong>The good: </strong>The SUV is comfortable, cushy, and
beautifully designed.
“<a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/volvo/ex90?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-85LREOujxSjjrYcpKmweCjHHecKDWT1yrfztuZCqMwEHk3DYgv5QPWDl1c7Md-687cTYgE" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The

smooth ride and incredible torque considering its hefty weight. And the

astonishing.</a>”
</p>
<p>
<strong>The bad: </strong>Software glitches (no Apple CarPlay or Android
Auto at launch, non-functional lidar), buggy connectivity (the
phone-as-key feature seems particularly confused),
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/09/ex90review/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-85LREOujxSjjrYcpKmweCjHHecKDWT1yrfztuZCqMwEHk3DYgv5QPWDl1c7Md-687cTYgE" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">battery
drain when parked</a>, and a cramped back row.
</p>
<p>
<strong>The bottom lines:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
“If you’re interested in an EX90, and its promise of serene
emissions-free motoring, you’re just going to have to keep waiting. Wait
until Volvo can polish the software, then buy the finished product. You
shouldn’t spend $90,000 on a promise.”

Hogan</a>, deputy editor of <em><em>InsideEVs</em></em>
</li>
<li>
“Unless the need for a third row is not optional, it’s hard to ignore
the Polestar 3, built alongside the EX90 in South Carolina, which is
several thousand dollars cheaper and much more fun to drive.”

M. Gitlin</a>, automotive editor at <em><em>Ars Technica </em></em>
</li>
<li>
“The launch of the EX90 has been delayed by almost a year due to the
complexity of getting the software right, and even that delay has not
been enough to get it to a level you’d rightly expect of any new car
launched in 2024, let alone one like the EX90.”

Tisshaw</a>, editor at <em><em>Autocar</em></em>
</li>
<li>
“As a minimum viable product, the EX90 is still pretty good. Future
updates and bug fixes will make it the luxury vehicle that Volvo hopes
it will be, with all the promised bells and whistles.”

<p>date: 2024-09-03, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
Climate has
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/dnc-climate-change" target="_blank">not
exactly</a> been the focus in this election cycle that it was in 2020 —
but the political climate could still be polarizing public opinion on
clean energy.
</p>
<p>
For the latest Heatmap News poll, Embold Research surveyed more than
5,000 registered voters over two weeks in early August. When asked
whether they were in favor clean energy projects in either their state,
their local area, or near their own property, a majority of respondents
said they were at least somewhat supportive, with declining levels of
enthusiasm as the projects got closer to their homes. The responses also
followed a predictable partisan gradient: 81% of Democrats supported
clean energy projects “on a property near yours” compared to 28% of
Republicans. But this level of support was also slightly lower than what
it was in April,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/battery-support-survey" target="_self"><u>when
Embold fielded a similar Heatmap survey</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Support went up among members of both major parties as the hypothetical
projects got further away from their homes, but across the board, the
numbers were lower in August than they were in April. “We have seen a
slight dip in voters’ support for various types of clean energy,” Embold
analyst Ben Greenfield told me. As with any poll gyration, the dip could
be a “statistical blip,” Greenfield said. But it’s also “possible that
this is an election year phenomenon.”
</p>
<p>
“This is something we do occasionally see — that support for various
types of policies and policy-related things can change in the heat of
the an election year, even if they don’t seem on their face directly
related to the election,” Greenfield added. While the opinions may be
transitory, however, they can have long-lasting consequences.
</p>
<p>
Opposition to clean energy projects can manifest — and matter — at both
the local and national level. A Republican congressional majority, for
instance, if convinced that its constituents don’t see much value in
wind and solar projects<strong>,</strong> may be more aggressive in
unwinding parts of the Inflation Reduction Act. Likewise, a great deal
of the clean energy development activity supported by tax policy that
was beefed up and extended in the Inflation Reduction Act has occurred
in Republican-controlled districts and states. To the extent that local
communities turn against clean energy because of its association with
Democrats, it could mean a slower and dirtier transition away from
fossil fuels.
</p>
<p>
Other differences between Republicans’ and Democrats’ survey answers
appear to reflect not just attitudes toward clean energy in general, but
also the respondents’ own values and preferences for energy projects.
Even when Republicans support clean energy projects, Greenfield noted,
their reasons for doing so are different from what Democrats cite.
</p>
<p>
When asked what would be a “strong” benefit of a clean energy project,
the most popular answer for Republicans, garnering 47% support, was the
claim that it “reduces our dependence on foreign sources of oil and
gas.” Among Democrats, meanwhile, 76% picked out “combats climate
change” as a benefit of clean energy, compared to 39% of independents
and only 13% of Republicans. “On that question, Democrats are kind of
equally interested in the economic benefits and environmental benefits,
whereas Republicans are almost entirely focused on economic benefits,”
Greenfield said. Donald Trump has made a point of attacking clean energy
policies on economic grounds, especially
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-wind-solar-fact-check" target="_self"><u>wind</u></a>,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/trump-sharks-electric-boats" target="_self"><u>electric
boats</u></a>, and depending on the day,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-electric-vehicles-fact-check" target="_self"><u>electric
cars</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
“We see lower support for wind than solar — at least rooftop solar,”
Greenfield said. That could be because rooftop solar is seen as a way to
save money and increase one’s own personal resilience, as opposed to a
more purely environmental choice like wind power.
</p>
<p>
“We found that there’s more support for incentives for clean power
plants, home renovations, building of factories in the U.S.,” Greenfield
also noted, suggesting that clean energy policies with a more obvious
economic nexus may be more popular than ones that are seen as more
purely to do with climate change.
</p>
<p>
While Trump modulates his views on EVs seemingly
<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/12/trump-musk-electric-vehicles-00173682" target="_blank"><u>depending
on how he feels about Elon Musk that day</u></a>, there’s good evidence
that one reason he attacked them in the past is that he knew his
supporters would like to hear it. When asked whether they thought
installing a variety of clean energy technologies in their home would
improve or diminish their quality of life, more than half of Republicans
said an electric car would make their quality of life “much worse,”
compared to just 5% of Democrats; over 50% of Democrats said an electric
car would make their quality of life better.
</p>
<p>
“Any time we talk about EVs, we see lower levels of support and stronger
opposition among Republicans than you might expect people to have about
a type of car,” Greenfield told me. “The big difference is the partisan
difference on the environmental benefit and whether that is important.
Clean energy tends to be a Democratic coded issue. That is clearly
driving a lot of the partisan difference.”

<h2 id="turkey-arrests-15-accused-of-assaulting-us-servicemen">Turkey
arrests 15 accused of assaulting US servicemen</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Ankara, Turkey/Washington — A nationalist Turkish youth group
physically assaulted two U.S. soldiers Monday in western Turkey, the
U.S. Embassy in Turkey and the local governor’s office said, adding that
15 assailants had been detained over the incident.</p>
<p>In a statement, the Izmir governor’s office said members of the
Turkey Youth Union (TGB), a youth branch of the nationalist opposition
Vatan Party, “physically attacked” two U.S. soldiers dressed in civilian
clothes in the Konak district.</p>
<p>It added that five U.S. soldiers joined in after seeing the incident,
and that police intervened. All 15 attackers had been detained and an
investigation was launched into the matter, it said.</p>
<p>A White House spokesperson said Monday, Washington was “troubled” by
the assault but added it was “appreciative that Turkish police are
taking this matter seriously and holding those responsible
accountable.”</p>
<p>The U.S. Embassy to Turkey also confirmed the attack and said the
U.S. soldiers were now safe.</p>
<p>“We can confirm reports that U.S. service members embarked aboard the
USS Wasp were the victims of an assault in Izmir today, and are now
safe,” it said on social media platform X.</p>
<p>Earlier, the TGB posted a video on X showing a group holding down a
man on the street and putting a white hood over his head, while shouting
slogans.</p>
<p>The group said the man was a soldier on board the USS Wasp, an
amphibious assault ship. The U.S. Embassy in Ankara had said earlier
Monday that the ship was carrying out a port visit to the Aegean coastal
town of Izmir this week.</p>
<p>“U.S. soldiers who carry the blood of our soldiers and thousands of
Palestinians on their hands cannot dirty our country. Every time you
step foot in these lands, we will meet you the way you deserve,” TGB
said.</p>
<p>U.S.-Turkey ties have been strained in recent years by the U.S.
alliance with Syrian Kurds that Turkey deems extremists, and over
Turkey’s purchase of Russian S-400 defenses that prompted U.S. sanctions
and removal from a F-35 jet program.</p>
<p>There has also been divergence over Israel’s war in Gaza, where over
40,000 people have been killed according to Gaza authorities, and over
which Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has sharply criticized
Washington’s ally.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the U.S. ambassador to Turkey said U.S.-Turkey
relations are now “in a better place than we’ve been in a while” and
noted the “useful role” Turkey played in a recent prisoner exchange
between the United States and Russia.</p>

<h2 id="people-shot-at-new-yorks-west-indian-american-day-parade">5
people shot at New York’s West Indian American Day Parade</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>new york — Five people were shot Monday at New York City’s West
Indian American Day Parade, police said. It was the latest incident of
violence to mar one of the world’s largest annual celebrations of
Caribbean culture.</p>
<p>A gunman targeting a specific group of people opened fire along the
parade route in Brooklyn around 2:35 p.m., NYPD Chief of Patrol John
Chell said. The parade had kicked off hours earlier, with thousands of
revelers dancing and marching down Eastern Parkway, a main thoroughfare
through the borough. It was expected to continue into the night.</p>
<p>Two people were critically wounded, Chell said. The three other
victims were expected to survive their injuries, he said. The gunman
fled.</p>
<p>“This was not random,” Chell said. “This was an intentional act by
one person towards a group of people. We do not by no means have any
active shooter or anything of that nature running around Eastern Parkway
as we speak. The parade is going on and will go on until later on
tonight.”</p>
<p>An Associated Press videographer who was nearby when the shots rang
out saw at least two people being treated for what appeared to be wounds
to the face and arm. </p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer was marching in the parade at
the time and completed the route. A message was left with Schumer’s
office.</p>
<p>Police cordoned off an area adjacent to the parade route, where they
placed crime scene markers. The parade continued flowing past as
officers were seen bagging items.</p>
<p>Chell asked that bystanders provide police with any video footage
they may have recorded of the shooting.</p>
<p>“We need that video,” Chell said. “We are going to solve this, but
it’s going to take a lot of work.”</p>
<p>The parade, an annual Labor Day event in its 57th year, turns Eastern
Parkway into a kaleidoscope of feather-covered costumes and colorful
flags as participants make their way down the thoroughfare alongside
floats stacked high with speakers playing soca and reggae music.</p>
<p>The parade routinely attracts huge crowds, who line the almost 2-mile
(3.2-kilometer) route that runs from Crown Heights to the Brooklyn
Museum. It’s also a popular destination for local politicians, many of
whom are of West Indian heritage or represent members of the city’s
large Caribbean community.</p>
<p>Though a joyous occasion, the parade and related celebrations have
been plagued by violence over the years.</p>
<p>In 2016, two people were killed and several others were wounded near
the parade route. The year before, Carey Gabay, an aide to then-Governor
Andrew Cuomo, was shot in the head during pre-parade festivities. He
died nine days later.</p>
<p>The West Indian American Day Parade has its roots in more
traditionally timed, pre-Lent Carnival celebrations started by a
Trinidadian immigrant in Manhattan around a century ago, according to
the organizers. The festivities were moved to the warmer time of year in
the 1940s.</p>
<p>Brooklyn, where hundreds of thousands of Caribbean immigrants and
their descendants have settled, began hosting the parade in the
1960s.</p>
<p>The Labor Day parade is now the culmination of days of carnival
events in the city, which include a steel pan band competition and
J’Ouvert, a separate street party commemorating freedom from
slavery.</p>

<h2 id="what-we-can-learn-from-vintage-computing">What we can learn from
vintage computing</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-02, from: OS News</p>
<p>Thanks to open source, no technology ever has to become obsolete, so
long as a community remains to support it. You can sync Newtons and Palm
Pilots with modern desktops, download web browsers for long-discontinued
operating systems, or connect vintage computers like the Apple IIe to
the modern internet via WiFi. Every year, new cartridges are
released for old-school video game consoles like the Nintendo
Entertainment System and Game Boy. People keep old software and online
platforms alive as well. The Dreamwidth team forked an old version of
the early social network LiveJournal’s source code and built a community
around it. The dial-up bulletin board system software WWIV is still
maintained and there are plenty of BBSes still around. Teams are working
to restore aspects of early online services like AOL and Prodigy. And
you can still use Gopher, the hypertext protocol that was — for a brief
period in the early 1990s — bigger than the web. ↫ Klint Finley
Retrocomputing is about a lot of things, and I feel like it differs per
person. For me, it’s a little bit of nostalgia, but primarily it’s about
learning, and experiencing hardware and software I was unable to
experience when they were new, either due to high cost or just general
unavailability. There’s a lot to learn from platforms that are no longer
among us, and often it helps you improve your skills with the modern
platforms you do still use. The linked article is right: open source is
playing such a massive role in the retrocomputing community. The number
of open source projects allowing you to somehow use decades-old
platforms in conjunction with modern technologies is massive, and it
goes far beyond just software – projects like BlueSCSI or very niche
things like usb3sun highlights there’s also hardware-based solutions for
just about anything retro you want to accomplish. And we really can’t
forget NetBSD, which seems to be the go-to modern operating system for
bringing new life to old and retro hardware, as it often runs on just
about anything. When I got my PA-RISC workstation, the HP Visualize
c3750, I couldn’t find working copies of HP-UX, so I, too, opted for
NetBSD to at least be able to see if the computer was fully functional.
NetBSD is now a tool in my toolbox when I’m dealing with older, unique
hardware. Retrocomputing is in a great place right now, with the
exception of the ballooning prices we’re all suffering from, with even
successful mainstay YouTubers like LGR lamenting the state of the
market. Still, if you do get your hands on something retro – odds are
there’s a whole bunch of tools ready for you to make the most of it,
even today.</p>

<h2 id="the-mouse-programming-language-on-cpm">The Mouse programming
language on CP/M</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-02, from: OS News</p>
<p>Mouse is an interpreted stack orientated language designed by Peter
Grogono around 1975. It was designed to be a small but powerful language
for microcomputers, similar to Forth, but much simpler. One obvious
difference to Forth is that Mouse interprets a stream of characters most
of which are only a single character and it relies more on variables
rather than rearranging the stack as much. The version for CP/M on
the Walnut Creek CD is quite small at only 2k. ↫ Lawrence Woodman (2020)
Even with very little to no programming experience I can tell that this
language looks a lot smaller and more compact than other code I’ve seen.
I’ll have to leave it to the actual programmers and developers among the
OSNews audience to provide more valuable insight, but I feel like
there’s definitely something here that’ll interest some of you.</p>

seizes plane used by Venezuela’s Maduro, citing sanctions
violations</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The U.S. government has seized a plane used by
Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro that officials say was illegally
purchased through a shell company and smuggled out of the United States,
citing violations of sanctions and export control laws.</p>
<p>The Dassault Falcon 900EX was seized in the Dominican Republic and
transferred to the custody of federal officials in Florida, the Justice
Department said Monday.</p>
<p>U.S. officials say associates of the Venezuelan leader used a
Caribbean-based shell company to hide their involvement in the purchase
of the plane, valued at the time at $13 million, from a company in
Florida. The plane was exported from the U.S. to Venezuela, through the
Caribbean, in April 2023 in a transaction meant to circumvent an
executive order that bars U.S. persons from business transactions with
the Maduro regime.</p>
<p>The plane, registered to San Marino, was widely used by Maduro for
foreign travel, including for trip earlier this year to Guyana and
Cuba.</p>
<p>“Let this seizure send a clear message: aircraft illegally acquired
from the United States for the benefit of sanctioned Venezuelan
officials cannot just fly off into the sunset,” Matthew Axelrod, an
assistant secretary for export enforcement in the Commerce Department,
said in a statement.</p>
<p>CNN first reported the plane seizure.</p>
<p>The seizure announcement comes just over a month after Venezuelans
headed to the polls for a highly anticipated presidential election in
which ruling party-loyal electoral authorities declared Maduro the
victor without showing any detailed results to back up their claim. The
lack of transparency has drawn international condemnation against
Maduro’s government.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the opposition managed to obtain more than 80% of vote
tally sheets – considered the ultimate proof of results – nationwide.
The documents, the faction said, show Maduro losing by a wide margin
against former diplomat Edmundo Gonzalez.</p>
<p>It was also the plane that carried several Americans jailed for years
in Venezuela to the Caribbean Island of Canouan last December where they
were swapped for a close Maduro ally, businessman Alex Saab, imprisoned
in the U.S. on money laundering charges.</p>
<p>In March, it flew to the Dominican Republic, along with a
Venezuelan-registered plane, for what was believed to be maintenance,
never to leave again.</p>
<p>The U.S. has sanctioned 55 Venezuelan-registered planes belonging to
state owned oil giant PDVSA.</p>
<p>It’s also offered a $15 million bounty for the arrest of Maduro to
face federal drug trafficking charges in New York.</p>
<p>The Venezuelan government’s centralized press office did not
immediately return a message from The Associated Press seeking comment
Monday.</p>

<p>Despite reports to the contrary, Microsoft has stated that Recall
will not be uninstallable after all. The feature did show up in the
Windows Features dialog, but apparently, that was a bug. “We are aware
of an issue where Recall is incorrectly listed as an option under the
‘Turn Windows features on or off’ dialog in Control Panel,” says Windows
senior product manager Brandon LeBlanc in a statement to The Verge.
“This will be fixed in an upcoming update.” ↫ Tom Warren at The Verge
The company is not committing to saying it will not ever be
uninstallable, probably because the European Union might have something
to say about that. At the very least you’ll be able to turn Recall off,
but it seems actually removing it might not be possible for a while.</p>

<p>In New York, aspiring fashion designers often attend colleges like
the Fashion Institute of Technology or Parsons School of Design. But for
those without the means or access to higher education, a Harlem-based
fashion incubator – a company that helps new fashion designers grow and
learn the business – is providing alternative paths to the industry.

in Shanghai, Chinese bookstore reopens in Washington</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — A Chinese bookstore reopened in Washington on Sunday,
six years after the Chinese government forced it to close its doors in
Shanghai.</p>
<p>JF Books was teeming with books — and customers — when it opened its
doors in Washington’s Dupont Circle neighborhood. In the storefront, the
shop’s name is displayed in English and Mandarin in neon green lights.
The sporadic rain was perhaps fitting considering the bookstore’s
namesake “jifeng” means “monsoon” in Mandarin.</p>
<p>The bookstore is located next to Kramers, an indie bookstore that has
been a Washington fixture for decades. Yu Miao, who runs JF Books, says
he hopes his bookstore becomes an institution for the local community,
too.</p>
<p>“I hope the bookstore can establish a connection between people in
the Chinese community, and this connection could be established through
knowledge,” Yu told VOA shortly before the shop opened for business.
“Also, I hope the bookstore’s function can go beyond the Chinese
community. It can also contribute to the local community.”</p>
<p>The shop sells Chinese-language books from Mainland China, Hong Kong
and Taiwan, in addition to a selection of English-language books. It
will also regularly host speakers for events.</p>
<p>Founded in Shanghai in 1997 as Jifeng Bookstore, the shop ran into
trouble in 2017 when its landlord said the lease couldn’t be extended.
The bookstore looked for a new location, but the prospective landlords
at each potential site received warnings or notifications from the
government.</p>
<p>Jifeng Bookstore is one of several independent bookstores that
Beijing has forced to close in recent years.</p>
<p>The fact that bookstores have become a battleground underscores the
Chinese government’s broader repression of free expression and crackdown
on anything deemed to be critical of the government, according to Sophie
Richardson, the former China director at Human Rights Watch.</p>
<p>“[Chinese President] Xi Jinping and his government have clearly
targeted a great deal of hostility at scholars,” Richardson told VOA at
the bookstore. “Their books are regarded as potential threats, and so
the party does what the party knows how to do, which is to send people
into exile, to send them to jail, to shut down bookstores.”</p>
<p>China’s Washington embassy did not immediately reply to VOA’s email
requesting comment for this story.</p>
<p>Gesturing at the throngs of people who were looking at books about
everything from Chinese history to science, Richardson, who is now a
visiting scholar at Stanford, added that there is a clear hunger for
Chinese books.</p>
<p>“It’s amazing to see this clear demand for this kind of material in
an environment where people can get it free of fear of persecution,” she
said.</p>
<p>That’s another reason why Yu wanted to reopen the bookstore: It can
be difficult to find Chinese-language books in the United States, he
said. “And so, I think there must be many others that have the same
concern,” he said.</p>
<p>When Jifeng Bookstore closed its doors in 2018, Yu never expected it
to reopen.</p>
<p>“I thought it was closed, then its story ended,” Yu said. “I never
imagined to reopen the bookstore.”</p>
<p>Now, JF Books has joined a rising number of independent Chinese
bookstores that are being opened by members of the diaspora in cities
around the world. They sell books and hold discussions about politics
and history in a way that the Chinese government has stifled inside
China.</p>
<p>JF Books already has scheduled three speakers for September. Howard
Shen, a graduate student at Georgetown University, told VOA that he’s
especially excited about the upcoming events.</p>
<p>“It’s such a big thing in the Chinese speaking community in D.C. We
are all very excited to have this bookstore. It’s such a meaningful
place for all Chinese in the world who love freedom,” said Shen, who is
from Taiwan. </p>
<p>One corner of the store features farewell messages that customers
wrote back when the store was forced to shutter in 2018. Leading up to
the bookstore’s second floor, photos on the wall memorialize the
bookstore’s two-decade history in Shanghai. At the top of the staircase,
photos show the bookstore’s final day in 2018.</p>
<p>“Jifeng Bookstore will soon depart from Shanghai,” the caption of one
photo reads, “but the monsoon will continue to blow.”</p>

id="us-prioritizes-deterrence-over-denuclearization-on-north-korea-experts-say">US
prioritizes deterrence over denuclearization on North Korea, experts
say</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — As North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs become
increasingly sophisticated, U.S.-based experts see the United States
shifting the focus of its diplomacy from the pursuit of denuclearization
of the Korean Peninsula to one of deterrence. </p>
<p>Officially, the U.S. State Department insists that denuclearization
remains the primary goal of the United States and South Korea, a policy
that is unlikely to change regardless of the outcome of the November
U.S. presidential election. </p>
<p>But in a series of email interviews with VOA Korean, more than half a
dozen experts said they saw scant hope that North Korean leader Kim Jong
Un could be persuaded to give up his growing nuclear arsenal and that
the U.S. must concentrate instead on seeing that it is never used.  </p>
<p>“I think, in practical terms, most Americans believe we have little
choice at this point but to prioritize deterrence, at least for the
foreseeable future,” said Michael O’Hanlon, director of foreign policy
research at the Brookings Institution in Washington, in an email to VOA
Korean this week.  </p>
<p>Robert Peters, research fellow for nuclear deterrence and missile
defense at the Heritage Foundation, told VOA Korean via email that
American politicians on both sides of the political spectrum are
questioning whether North Korea would even consider abandoning its
nuclear weapons. </p>
<p>“I think there is little appetite in either political party to seek
denuclearization with North Korea, given the failures of the late
2010s,” Peters said, referring to the collapse of the nuclear talks
between former U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim
Jong Un, who met three times in 2018 and 2019. </p>
<p>“I think all sides recognize that Kim will not give up nuclear
weapons at any price.”  </p>
<p>Shifting priorities </p>
<p>Negotiations over North Korea’s nuclear program between Washington
and Pyongyang have been nearly nonexistent since October 2019. </p>
<p>Peters added, “Bottom line — without question, the ground has shifted
regarding how we think about the North Korean nuclear threat.”  </p>
<p>Gary Samore, former White House coordinator for arms control and
weapons of mass destruction during the Obama administration, said
Washington’s shift in direction was inevitable. </p>
<p>“The U.S. government has been forced to place more emphasis on
deterrence over denuclearization because Kim Jong Un has shown no
willingness to negotiate a nuclear deal or even meet with the U.S. to
discuss denuclearization,” Samore told VOA Korean via email. </p>
<p>“Instead, North Korea has continued to advance its nuclear and
missile program, and the U.S. has responded by strengthening military
cooperation with the ROK and Japan, including joint efforts to enhance
extended deterrence.” </p>
<p>ROK stands for Republic of Korea, the official name of South Korea.
 </p>
<p>Denuclearization of North Korea is now viewed in Washington as a
“mission impossible,” said Bruce Bennett, a senior defense analyst at
the RAND Corporation. </p>
<p>“I think it is fair to say that the U.S. government is now more
focused on deterrence, which is largely succeeding, than on
denuclearization,” Bennett told VOA Korean via email. </p>
<p>“This change does not mean that the U.S. and ROK have abandoned
trying to negotiate for denuclearization, which North Korea steadfastly
refuses to do, but rather that our governments no longer see
denuclearization as a viable solution to the North Korean nuclear weapon
threat.” </p>
<p>Markus Garlauskas, director of the Indo-Pacific Security Initiative
at the Atlantic Council, told VOA Korean via email it was “fully
appropriate” that Washington has been paying more attention in recent
years to deterring North Korean aggression than attempting to negotiate
denuclearization. </p>
<p>“I have long argued that Kim Jong Un does not intend to give up his
nuclear weapons, that the nuclear weapons and missile capabilities of
North Korea have grown and will continue to grow, meaning that we in the
United States and its allies must adjust our strategy and policy
accordingly,” he said. </p>
<p>“We should not let hopes of negotiations get in the way of making
tough decisions to improve deterrence,” added Garlauskas, who served as
the U.S. national intelligence officer for North Korea from 2014 to
2020. </p>
<p>He stressed, however, that “accepting the reality that North Korea is
nuclear-armed and will remain so while under Kim Jong Un’s leadership”
does not mean that the U.S. should or would give up denuclearization as
a goal. </p>
<p>“Our principled stand can and should remain that North Korea must
comply with U.N. Security Council resolutions by halting its nuclear and
ballistic missile programs and relinquishing its nuclear weapons, and I
do think there is still broad agreement on that in Washington,”
Garlauskas said. </p>
<p>Commitment to denuclearization </p>
<p>Sydney Seiler, who until last year was the national intelligence
officer for North Korea on the U.S. National Intelligence Council, said
the U.S. should keep denuclearization as a priority, adding that
“denuclearization and deterrence are not mutually exclusive.” </p>
<p>“We have a responsibility on a day-by-day basis to deter provocative
actions, coercion, blackmail and even possible invasion by North Korea
and have been doing so for the last 70 years of armistice,” said Seiler,
who is now a senior adviser on Korean affairs at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies. </p>
<p>“Successfully ensuring deterrence does not mean abandoning the goal
of the denuclearization of North Korea,” he told VOA Korean via
email. </p>
<p>Robert Abrams, a retired U.S. Army four-star general who served as
commander of U.S. Forces Korea from 2018 to 2021, emphasized that a
strategy of deterrence should be clearly differentiated from the goal of
denuclearization. </p>
<p>“The U.S. strategic deterrent was never about stopping the North
Korean regime from developing their own nukes,” Abrams told VOA Korean
in an August 20 email. </p>
<p>“Sanctions and diplomatic efforts were intended to stop North Korea’s
nuclear program. The strategic deterrent is to deter North Korea from
ever using nuclear weapons, and that has obviously been very
successful.” </p>
<p>Officially, Washington reiterates that denuclearization of North
Korea remains a goal of the U.S.-South Korea alliance. </p>
<p>“The United States and the ROK continue to pursue the shared
objective of the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,” a
State Department spokesperson told VOA Korean via email this week. “We
believe that the only effective way to reduce nuclear threats on the
peninsula is by curbing the proliferation of nuclear weapons.” </p>
<p>But the spokesperson stressed that deterrence was also a crucial
element of U.S. policy toward North Korea. </p>
<p>“At the same time, the United States and the ROK will continue
working together to strengthen extended deterrence in the face of
increasingly aggressive DPRK rhetoric about its nuclear weapons
program,” the spokesperson said. </p>
<p>He added that the 16-month-old Washington Declaration “reinforces the
fact that any nuclear attack by [North Korea] against [South Korea] will
be met with a swift, overwhelming and decisive response from the United
States.” </p>
<p>In April 2023, U.S. President Joe Biden and South Korean President
Yoon Suk Yeol adopted the Washington Declaration, which outlines a
series of measures to deter North Korea’s nuclear weapons use.</p>

<h2 id="at-us-theme-parks-halloween-celebrations-start-in-summer">At US
theme parks, Halloween celebrations start in summer</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>los angeles, california — Halloween has arrived earlier than ever at
major U.S. theme parks, as operators such as Disney, Six Flags, and
Universal Studios seek to expand their reach and build on consumers’
love of spooky costumes and scares. </p>
<p>Theme park operators have introduced a range of attractions, live
performances, merchandise and food and beverages in August — before
summer has ended and well before the October 31 holiday — to take
advantage of the surging popularity of Halloween. These holiday-themed
efforts come at a time when domestic theme park attendance has slumped,
following a surge in demand after COVID.  </p>
<p>Edithann Ramey, chief marketing officer at Six Flags, told Reuters
that the theme parks saw attendance gains and increases in guest
spending in 2023 when it introduced attractions based on the horror
films “SAW” and “The Conjuring.” </p>
<p>The offerings were so successful that the theme park company has been
investing more in Halloween experiences, Ramey said. </p>
<p>“It’s become this time of the year that’s grown in explosive ways,”
Ramey said. “It’s become a billion-dollar industry in the last five
years.”</p>
<p>Jakob Wahl, chief executive for the International Association of
Amusement Parks and Attractions, said Halloween has become one of the
strongest selling points for parks that cater to young people and
families.  </p>
<p>“We actually see a growth every year in terms of Halloween events,
not only North America, but across the world,” Wahl said.  </p>
<p>Disney starts season in August</p>
<p>Walt Disney’s parks started the Halloween season earlier than ever
this year with “Mickey’s Not So Scary Party” beginning on August 9 and
running through the end of October.  </p>
<p>The Oogie Boogie Bash, a separately ticketed event named for the
“Nightmare Before Christmas” villain, sold out this year in 11 days,
Disney said. Its popularity prompted the company to push the release
date to August 25 from September 5. </p>
<p>“We’ve seen from our guests in years past that there’s a demand for
them to come and enjoy that season with us,” said Tracy Halas, creative
director of Disney Live Entertainment.  </p>
<p>Six Flags also kicks off Halloween early this year, on September 14,
with a new experience called “Saw: Legacy of Terror” celebrating the
20th anniversary of the “SAW” horror movie franchise.  </p>
<p>Following the $8 billion merger of Six Flags and former rival Cedar
Fair, which created the nation’s largest amusement park operator, with
42 parks across 17 states, Six Flags is increasing its investment in
Halloween.  </p>
<p>That includes adding Hollywood-themed experiences to Six Flags Fright
Fest based on Netflix’s science fiction series, “Stranger Things,” as
well as horror films “Texas Chainsaw Massacre,” and “The Conjuring.”</p>
<p>Universal adds ‘Ghostbusters’ haunted house </p>
<p>Comcast-owned Universal Studios 2024 Halloween Horror Nights in
Orlando runs from August 30 to November 3, the longest season they’ve
ever had. The company did not immediately respond to a Reuters request
for comment. </p>
<p>Universal is adding a “Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire” haunted house to
its Halloween programming alongside the first attraction inspired by
horror franchise, “A Quiet Place.”  </p>
<p>Universal also aims to attract guests at Universal Studios Japan with
a new 4D show in collaboration with the anime television series
“Chainsaw Man.”  </p>
<p>Both Universal Orlando and Japan will add cast members dressed as the
antagonists called Death Eaters to haunt Diagon Alley during Horror
Nights.  </p>
<p>Disney villain Cruella de Vil hosted a “Let’s Get Wicked” celebration
at Hong Kong Disneyland in 2022, which received an industry award and
returns this year.</p>

<p>date: 2024-09-02, from: Blog by Fabrizio Ferri-Benedetti</p>
<p>
I’ve recently found out about
<a href="https://typespec.io/">TypeSpec</a>, a new language aimed at
describing web APIs, through
<a href="https://nordicapis.com/api-design-in-the-post-openapi-era/">an
interview</a> that bears the provocative title of <em>API Design in the
Post-OpenAPI Era</em>. Leaving aside the fact that OpenAPI is very much
alive, what left me stupefied was the assertion that OpenAPI files
should be “automatically generated artifacts and nothing more”. After
digging a bit, I found the picture to be slightly more reassuring, but
still quite representative of a world that keeps steering away from
human-driven design to bury itself in curly brackets paradises.

id="california-lawmakers-approve-laws-banning-deepfakes-regulating-ai">California
lawmakers approve laws banning deepfakes, regulating AI</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Sacramento, California — California lawmakers approved a host of
proposals this week aiming to regulate the artificial intelligence
industry, combat deepfakes and protect workers from exploitation by the
rapidly evolving technology.</p>
<p>The California Legislature, which is controlled by Democrats, is
voting on hundreds of bills during its final week of the session to send
to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s desk. Their deadline is Saturday.</p>
<p>The Democratic governor has until Sept. 30 to sign the proposals,
veto them or let them become law without his signature. Newsom signaled
in July he will sign a proposal to crack down on election deepfakes but
has not weighed in on other legislation.</p>
<p>He warned earlier this summer that overregulation could hurt the
homegrown industry. In recent years, he often has cited the state’s
budget troubles when rejecting legislation that he would otherwise
support.</p>
<p>Here is a look at some of the AI bills lawmakers approved this
year.</p>
<p>Combating deepfakes</p>
<p>Citing concerns over how AI tools are increasingly being used to
trick voters and generate deepfake pornography of minors, California
lawmakers approved several bills this week to crack down on the
practice.</p>
<p>Lawmakers approved legislation to ban deepfakes related to elections
and require large social media platforms to remove the deceptive
material 120 days before Election Day and 60 days thereafter. Campaigns
also would be required to publicly disclose if they’re running ads with
materials altered by AI.</p>
<p>A pair of proposals would make it illegal to use AI tools to create
images and videos of child sexual abuse. Current law does not allow
district attorneys to go after people who possess or distribute
AI-generated child sexual abuse images if they cannot prove the
materials are depicting a real person.</p>
<p>Tech companies and social media platforms would be required to
provide AI detection tools to users under another proposal.</p>
<p>Setting safety guardrails</p>
<p>California could become the first state in the nation to set sweeping
safety measures on large AI models.</p>
<p>The legislation sent by lawmakers to the governor’s desk requires
developers to start disclosing what data they use to train their models.
The efforts aim to shed more light into how AI models work and prevent
future catastrophic disasters.</p>
<p>Another measure would require the state to set safety protocols
preventing risks and algorithmic discrimination before agencies could
enter any contract involving AI models used to define decisions.</p>
<p>Protecting workers</p>
<p>Inspired by the monthslong Hollywood actors strike last year,
lawmakers approved a proposal to protect workers, including voice actors
and audiobook performers, from being replaced by their AI-generated
clones. The measure mirrors language in the contract the SAG-AFTRA made
with studios last December.</p>
<p>State and local agencies would be banned from using AI to replace
workers at call centers under one of the proposals.</p>
<p>California also may create penalties for digitally cloning dead
people without consent of their estates.</p>
<p>Keeping up with the technology</p>
<p>As corporations increasingly weave AI into Americans’ daily lives,
state lawmakers also passed several bills to increase AI literacy.</p>
<p>One proposal would require a state working group to consider
incorporating AI skills into math, science, history and social science
curriculums. Another would develop guidelines on how schools could use
AI in the classrooms.</p>

motion sickness</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-02, from: Lean Rada’s blog</p>
<p>
Last May, Apple announced a new feature called <strong>Vehicle Motion
Cues</strong> for their iOS devices. It’s an overlay that can help
reduce motion sickness while riding a vehicle.
</p>
<p>
I have really bad motion sickness, and riding cars, buses, and trains
makes me nauseous. This feature would have been a nice relief for me,
but as it stands, I use Android.
</p>
<p>
Instead of buying a Malus fruit device, I took the matter into my own
programmer hands. I created an alternative app for Android.
</p>
<p>
<span>To be sure, I checked the patents. Apple does have one regarding a
certain motion sickness solution, but it’s specifically for head-mounted
displays, not handheld devices. I figured it’s because there is prior
art for handheld devices, such as

<p>
My app is called <strong>EasyQueasy</strong>. What it does is display
onscreen vestibular signals that try to help prevent motion sickness.
This functions as an overlay that is displayed on top of whatever you’re
doing, browsing the web or watching videos.

The app is open source. I might try to get it on F-Droid someday.

account due to “inactivity”.</small>

I made this for myself so I haven’t really sorted out distribution.

<p>
There are two facets to this inquiry:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
How does it help with motion sickness?
</li>
<li>
How does the app work behind the scenes?

<p>
Let’s go over them sequentially.

How to unsick motion
</h2>
<p>
<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_sickness"><strong>Motion
sickness</strong></a> happens when your brain receives conflicting
motion cues from your senses. Motion cues come from the
<strong>vestibular system</strong> (“sense of balance”, inner ears) and
the <strong>visual system</strong> (eyes).
</p>
<img srcset="/notes/motion-sickness-app/1.png 664w" sizes=" 664px" spec="100% [664) 664" loading="lazy" width="100%" data-placeholder="" caption="The system diagram" src="https://leanrada.com/notes/motion-sickness-app/1.png?ref=rss">
<span>The system diagram</span>
<p>
When you’re in a moving car, your eyes mostly see the stationary
interiors of the car but your inner ears feel the movement. The signal
of being stationary and the signal of being in motion does not make
<em>sense</em> in the central processing system somewhere in the brain
<em>(which decides that the solution to this particular situation is to
vomit)</em>.
</p>
<img srcset="/notes/motion-sickness-app/2.png 664w" sizes=" 664px" spec="100% [664) 664" loading="lazy" width="100%" data-placeholder="" caption="There’s a bug in the central processing module that triggers an unexpected response to conflicting signals." src="https://leanrada.com/notes/motion-sickness-app/2.png?ref=rss">
<span>There’s a bug in the central processing module that triggers an
unexpected response to conflicting signals.</span>
<p>
<span>Side note: The inverse happens in virtual reality when you move or
rotate your character — your eyes recognise motion but your inner ears
(your physical body) feel no motion, causing sickness. As I mentioned, I
have really bad motion sickness, and both car movement and VR movement
are almost unbearable to me.</span>
</p>
<p>
To reduce motion sickness, we need to match the visual input with the
vestibular input. Unfortunately, there’s no hardware that can override
the inner ears’ sense of motion just yet. But we can semi-hijack the
visual system via age-old hardware called screens.
</p>
<p>
By displaying movement on-screen that matches the actual movement of the
body, motion sickness can be thus reduced!
</p>

<p>
Almost every smartphone has an <strong>accelerometer</strong> in them.
It’s a hardware module that measures <em>acceleration</em> in real time.
</p>
<p>
Coincidentally, the inner ears also sense the same particular aspect of
motion, <em>acceleration</em>. That’s why it can detect up or down (the
planet’s gravity is an ever-present acceleration towards “down”),
functioning as a “sense of balance”, and detect relative motion at the
same time.
</p>
<p>
So, smartphones have “inner ear” hardware. By reading off of this
sensor, we can generate the correct visuals.

<span>The visual layer is just an adapter to same acceleration data used

<p>
The other Android app, KineStop, appear to use the phone’s magnetic
sensor (compass) in addition to the accelerometer. So, it also knows
about your absolute orientation in the world. It’s more effective in
turning motions, but not so much for bumpy rides.
</p>
<pre><code>          &lt;p&gt;There are definitely multiple ways to solve the problem, but I find that the purely acceleration-based solution is sufficient for me.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;</code></pre>
<h2 id="dead-reckoning">
Dead reckoning
</h2>
<p>
The accelerometer provides acceleration data, but what we actually need
to draw dots on the screen is <strong>position</strong>.
</p>
<p>
Recall in calculus or physics that the integral of acceleration is the
<em>velocity</em> and the integral of velocity is <em>position</em>.
There are two layers of integration before we can draw dots on the
screen.
</p>
<p>
<code>acceleration → velocity → position</code>
</p>
<p>
What the app does is
<a target="_blank" href="http://lampx.tugraz.at/~hadley/physikm/apps/a2x.en.php"><strong>numerical
integration</strong></a>. It keeps track of an estimated velocity and an
estimated position in memory. Then, on every tick, it adds the current
acceleration vector to the velocity vector, and add the velocity to the
position. Note: all vectors here are in 3D.
</p>
<p>
The calculated position vector provides an estimate of the phone’s
current position! Finally, we can draw dots!
</p>
<p>
To provide the correct sensation of movement, the dots must appear
stable relative to the origin, that is, the earth. Negating the
calculated position vector achieves this effect.
</p>
<pre><code><span>// pseudocode</span>
<span>onEveryFrame</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  velocity <span>+=</span> accelerometer<span>.</span><span>getAcceleration</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
  position <span>+=</span> velocity

<span>}</span></code></pre>
<h2 id="error-correction">
Error correction
</h2>
<p>
The accelerometer signal is very <strong>noisy</strong>. While that is
workable for many applications, when we’re doing position integration
the errors really add up, and simple dead reckoning is way off.
</p>
<p>
Standard signal processing techniques can be applied to deal with noise,
like a low-pass filter.
</p>
<pre><code><span>// Example: With a low-pass filter</span>
<span>onEveryFrame</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// low-pass filter</span>
  smoothAcceleration <span>+=</span>
    <span>(</span>accelerometer<span>.</span><span>getAcceleration</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>-</span> smoothAcceleration<span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>0.60</span>

  <span>// position integration</span>
  velocity <span>+=</span> smoothAcceleration
  position <span>+=</span> velocity

  <span>drawDots</span><span>(</span>offset <span>=</span> <span>-</span>position<span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>
But a simpler solution like dampening the velocity over time is plenty
sufficient.
</p>
<pre><code><span>// Example: With velocity dampening</span>
<span>onEveryFrame</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// position integration</span>
  velocity <span>+=</span> accelerometer<span>.</span><span>getAcceleration</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
  position <span>+=</span> velocity

  <span>// dampen</span>
  velocity <span>*=</span> <span>0.80</span>

  <span>drawDots</span><span>(</span>offset <span>=</span> <span>-</span>position<span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>
And that is basically how EasyQueasy works. And presumably iOS does it
similarly as well.
</p>
<h2 id="easyqueasy-features">
EasyQueasy features
</h2>
<p>
EasyQueasy’s features and advantages over the current iOS solution are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Configurable speed and other parameters.
</li>
<li>
It’s 3D! Because movement in the real-world is three-dimensional!
</li>
<li>
Option to activate the overlay from any screen via quick gesture
shortcuts.
</li>
</ul>
