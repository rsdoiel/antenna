Pi now sells branded storage (SD cards and SSDs)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-23, from: Liliputing</p>
<p>
The Raspberry Pi line of products are often refereed to as single-board
computers because nearly everything you need to run them comes on a
credit card-sized board including the processor, memory, storage, and
plenty of I/O. One thing that isn’t usually included in the base price
though? Storage. For the Raspberry Pi 4 and earlier […]

Ryzen Z2 chips could bring Strix Point graphics to handhelds in 2025
(Updated)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-23, from: Liliputing</p>
<p>
AMD’s been making laptop processors for years that have integrated
graphics powerful enough to let you play many recent games without a
discrete GPU. And in 2023 the company released its first Ryzen Z series
processors designed specifically for handheld gaming PCs like the Asus
ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. Recently AMD officials confirmed plans to

pleasant song, but because of this particular version. To the same

same time. If you listen through a single

<h2 id="solving-the-mystery-of-arm7tdmi-multiply-carry-flag">Solving the
mystery of ARM7TDMI multiply carry flag</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-23, from: OS News</p>
<p>The processor in the Game Boy Advance, the ARM7TDMI, has a weird
characteristic where the carry flag is set to a “meaningless value”
after a multiplication operation. What this means is that software
cannot and should not rely on the value of the carry flag after
multiplication executes. It can be set to anything. Any value. 0, 1, a
horse, whatever. This has been a source of memes in the emulator
development community for a few years – people would frequently joke
about how the implementation of the carry flag may as well
be cpu.flags.c = rand() &amp;amp; 1;. And they had a point – the carry
flag seemed to defy all patterns; nobody understood why it behaves the
way it does. But the one thing we did know, was that the carry flag
seemed to be deterministic. That is, under the same set of inputs to a
multiply instruction, the flag would be set to the same value. This was
big news, because it meant that understanding the carry flag could give
us key insight into how this CPU performs multiplication. And just to
get this out of the way, the carry flag’s behavior after multiplication
isn’t an important detail to emulate at all. Software doesn’t rely on
it. And if software did rely on it, then screw the developers who wrote
that software. But the carry flag is a meme, and it’s a really tough
puzzle, and that was motivation enough for me to give it a go. Little
did I know it’d take 3 years of on and off work. ↫ bean machine Please
don’t make me understand any of this.</p>

licensing issues have been a frequent topic, even as we approach the end
of 2024. It’s surprising that many customers still feel uncertain about
how to navigate this mess. While VMware has been a mainstay in
enterprise environments for years, these ongoing issues make customers
nervous. And they should be – it’s hard to rely on something when even
the licensing situation feels volatile. Now, as much as I’m a die-hard
FreeBSD fan, I have to admit that FreeBSD still falls short when it
comes to virtualization – at least from an enterprise perspective. In
these environments, it’s not just about running a VM; it’s about having
the flexibility and capabilities to manage workloads without
interruption. Years ago, open-source solutions like KVM (e.g., Proxmox)
and Xen (e.g., XCP-ng) introduced features like live migration, where
you can move VMs between hosts with zero downtime. Even more recently,
solutions like SUSE Harvester (utilizing KubeVirt for running VMs) have
shown that this is now an essential part of any virtualization
ecosystem. ↫ gyptazy FreeBSD has bhyve, but the part where it falls
short, according to gyptazy, is the tool’s lack of live migration. While
competitors and alternatives allow for virtual machines to be migrated
without downtime, bhyve users still need to shut down their VMs,
interrupt all connections, and thus experience a period of downtime
before everything is back up and running again. This is simply not
acceptable in most enterprise environments, and as such, bhyve is not an
option for most users of that type. Luckily for enterprise FreeBSD
users, things are improving. Live migration of bhyve virtual machines is
being worked on, and basic live migration is now supported, but with
limitations. For instance, only virtual machines with a maximum of 3GB
could be migrated live, but that limit has been raised in recent years
to 13 to 14GB, which is a lot more palatable. There are also some issues
with memory corruption, as well as some other issues. Still, it’s a
massive feat to have live migration at all, and it seems to be improving
every year. The linked article goes into much greater detail about where
things stand, so if you’re interested in keeping up with the latest
progress regarding bhyve’s live migration capabilities, it’s a great
place to start.</p>

announces Snapdragon 8 Elite flagship smartphone SoC</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-23, from: OS News</p>
<p>At the Snapdragon Summit today, Qualcomm is officially announcing the
Snapdragon 8 Elite, its flagship SoC for smartphones. The Snapdragon 8
Elite is a major upgrade from its predecessor, with improvements across
the board. Qualcomm is also changing its naming scheme for its flagship
SoCs from Snapdragon 8 Gen X to Snapdragon X Elite. ↫ Pradeep
Viswanathan at Neowin It’s wild – but not entirely unexpected – how we
always seem to end up in a situation in technology where crucial
components, such as the operating system or processor, are made by one,
or at most two, companies. While there are a few other smartphone
system-on-a-chip vendors, they’re mostly relegated to low-end devices,
and can’t compete on the high end, where the money is, at all. It’s
sadness. Speaking of our mobile SoC overlords, they seem to be in a bit
of a pickle when it comes to their core business of, well, selling SoCs.
In short, Qualcomm bought Nuvia to use its technology to build the
current crop of Snapdragon X Elite and Pro laptop chips. According to
ARM, Qualcomm does not have an ARM license to do so, and as such, a
flurry of lawsuits between the two companies followed. ARM is now
cancelling certain Qualcomm ARM licenses, arguing specifically its
laptop Snapdragon X chips should be destroyed. What we’re looking at
here is two industry giants engaged in very public, and very expensive,
contract negotiations, using the legal system as their arbiter. This
will eventually fizzle out into a new agreement between the two
companies with renewed terms and conditions – and flows of money – but
until that dust has settled, be prepared for an endless flurry of
doomerist news items about this story. As for us normal people? We don’t
have to worry one bit about this legal nonsense. It’s not like we have
any choice in smartphone chips anyway.</p>

<h2 id="tmp-should-not-exist">/tmp should not exist</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-22, from: OS News</p>
<p>I commented on Lobsters that /tmp is usually a bad idea, which caused
some surprise. I suppose /tmp security bugs were common in the 1990s
when I was learning Unix, but they are pretty rare now so I can see why
less grizzled hackers might not be familiar with the problems. I guess
that’s some kind of success, but sadly the fixes have left behind a lot
of scar tissue because they didn’t address the underlying
problem: /tmp should not exist. ↫ Tony Finch Not only is this an
excellent, cohesive, and convincing argument against the existence of
/tmp, it also contains some nice historical context as to why things are
the way they are. Even without the arguments against /tmp, though, it
just seems entirely more logical, cleaner, and sensible to have /tmp
directories per user in per user locations. While I never would’ve been
able to so eloquently explain the problem as Finch does, it just feels
wrong to have every user resort to the exact same directory for
temporary files, like a complex confluence of bad decisions you just
know is going to cause problems, even if you don’t quite understand the
intricate interplay.</p>

AirPods Pro hearing health features are as good as they sound</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-22, from: OS News</p>
<p>Apple announced a trio of major new hearing health features for the
AirPods Pro 2 in September, including clinical-grade hearing aid
functionality, a hearing test, and more robust hearing protection. All
three will roll out next week with the release of iOS 18.1, and
they could mark a watershed moment for hearing health awareness. Apple
is about to instantly turn the world’s most popular earbuds into an
over-the-counter hearing aid. ↫ Chris Welch at The Verge Rightfully so,
most of us here have a lot of issues with the major technology companies
and the way they do business, but every now and then, even they
accidentally stumble into doing something good for the world. AirPods
are already a success story, and gaining access to hearing aid-level
features at their price point is an absolute game changer for a lot of
people with hearing issues – and for a lot of people who don’t even yet
know they have hearing issues in the first place. If you have people in
your life with hearing issues, or whom you suspect may have hearing
issues, gifting them AirPods this Christmas season may just be a perfect
gift. Yes, I too think hearing aids should be a thing nobody has to pay
for and which should just be part of your country’s universal healthcare
coverage – assuming you have such a thing – but this is not a bad option
as a replacement.</p>

<h2 id="system76-unveils-arm-ampere-altra-workstation">System76 unveils
ARM Ampere Altra workstation</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-22, from: OS News</p>
<p>System76, purveyor of Linux computers, distributions, and now also
desktop environments, has just unveiled its latest top-end workstation,
but this time, it’s not an x86 machine. They’ve been working together
with Ampere to build a workstation based around Ampere’s Altra ARM
processors: the Thelio Astra. Phoronix, fine purveyor of Linux-focused
benchmarks, were lucky enough to benchmark one, and has more information
on the new workstation. System76 designed the Thelio Astra in
collaboration with Ampere Computing. The System76 Thelio Astra makes use
of Ampere Altra processors up to the Ampere Altra Max 128-core ARMv8
processor that in turn supports 8-channel DDR4 ECC memory. The Thelio
Astra can be configured with up to 512GB of system memory, choice of
Ampere Altra processors, up to NVIDIA RTX 6000 Ada Generation graphics,
dual 10 Gigabit Ethernet, and up to 16TB of PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD storage.
System76 designed the Thelio Astra ARM64 workstation to be complemented
by NVIDIA graphics given the pervasiveness of NVIDIA GPUs/accelerators
for artificial intelligence and machine learning workloads. The Astra is
contained within System76’s custom-designed, in-house-manufactured
Thelio chassis. Pricing on the System76 Thelio Astra will start out at
$3,299 USD with the 64-core Ampere Altra Q64-22 processor, 2 x 32GB of
ECC DDR4-3200 memory, 500GB NVMe SSD, and NVIDIA A402 graphics card. ↫
Michael Larabel This pricing is actually remarkably favourable
considering the hardware you’re getting. System76 and its employees have
been dropping hints for a while now they were working on an ARM variant
of their Thelio workstation, and knowing some of the prices others are
asking, I definitely expected the base price to hit $5000, so this is a
pleasant surprise. With the Altra processors getting a tiny bit long in
the tooth, you do notice some oddities here, specifically the DDR4 RAM
instead of the modern DDR5, as well as the lack of PCIe 5.0. The problem
is that while the Altra has a successor in the AmpereOne processor, its
availability is quite limited, and most of them probably end up in
datacentres and expensive servers for big tech companies. This newer
variant does come with DDR5 and PCIe 5.0 support, but doesn’t yet have a
lower core count version, so even if it were readily available it might
simply push the price too far up. Regardless, the Altra is still a
ridiculously powerful processor, and at anywhere between 64 and 128
cores, it’s got power to spare. The Thelio Astra will be available come
12 November, and while I would perform a considerable number of
eyebrow-raising acts to get my hands on one, it’s unlikely System76 will
ship one over for a review. Edit: here’s an excellent and detailed reply
to our Mastodon account from an owner of an Ampere Altra workstation,
highlighting some of the challenges related to your choice of GPU.

<p>date: 2024-10-22, from: Liliputing</p>
<p>
The AYANEO AM02 is a small desktop computer with a design that’s heavily

Bridge: Art or Annoyance?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-22, from: The California Tech (Caltech student

<p>For the astute eyes on cam- pus, you may have noticed something
different about Caltech Hall, specifically the bridge across the pond.
But for those who may not know, the bridge going across Caltech Hall
Pond has been complete- ly covered in gold leaf, or so it seems.</p>

<p>In the heart of Pasadena, nestled between the evergreen dotted hills
and the sprawling cityscape, stands a campus symbolizing human ingenuity
and environmental harmony: Caltech. Remarkably, what was once a patch-
work of open chaparral and agricultural land has transformed into a
living laboratory where science meets sustainability.</p>

<p>date: 2024-10-22, from: Rachel Kwon blog</p>
<p>I recently got contact lenses, for the first time in 34 years, as
someone who has required corrective eyewear since the age of 6. I have
attributed the decision mostly to my ongoing midlife/existential crisis
— as a way to prove to myself that I’m NOT set in my ways and I CAN do
new things — and for whatever reason I had increasingly been thinking
that my eyeglasses are my whole personality and I was interested in
experimenting with a different look.</p>

<p>date: 2024-10-22, from: Accidentally in Code</p>
<p>A few weeks ago everyone was arguing about “founder mode”, but before
it came the idea of “Peace time CEO/War time CEO”. The removal of the
unnecessary violence in the metaphor is an improvement, but the content
of peacetime/wartime is actually better. It’s more specific, and more
about operating with focus and efficiency. Founder mode […]</p>

<p>date: 2024-10-22, from: O’Reilly Radar</p>
<p>I’m worried about AI. I’m not worried about it taking my job. I
believe AI is a genuine productivity tool. By which I mean it can make
developers produce more. The question is whether those developers are
producing something good or not. The difference between an experienced
developer and a junior is that an experienced […]</p>

<p>Introduction One of the more interesting features added to the RP2350
chip at the heart of the Raspberry Pi Pico 2 is that it contains two
32-bit RISC-V CPU cores. Sadly, you can’t run both the ARM and RISC-V
CPU cores at the same time, you have to choose one or the other. In this
