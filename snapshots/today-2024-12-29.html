Encanto 2</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-29, updated: 2024-12-29, from: Simon Willison’s

<strong><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3leezrzlvrk2m">Google
search hallucinates Encanto 2</a></strong>
</p>
Jason Schreier on Bluesky:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I was excited to tell my kids that there’s a sequel to Encanto, only to
scroll down and learn that Google’s AI just completely made this up
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I just replicated the same result by
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=encanto+2&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en-us&amp;client=safari">searching
Google for encanto 2</a>. Here’s what the “AI overview” at the top of
the page looked like:
</p>
<p>
<img alt="Search Labs | Al Overview. Encanto 2: A New Generation is an animated musical fantasy comedy film that is scheduled for release in the United States on August 25, 2024. lt is the sequel to the 2021 Disney film Encanto. Here are some details about the film: Plot: The film takes place years after the original and centers on a new generation of the Madrigal family, led by an older Mirabel and her grandson, José. Directors: Byron Howard and Jared Bush are directing the film. Show more..." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/encanto-2.jpg" />
</p>
<p>
Only when I clicked the “Show more” link did it become clear what had
happened:
</p>
<p>
<img alt="Writers: Jared Bush and Charise Castro Smith are writing the film. Music: Lin-Manuel Miranda will write original songs for the film, as he did for the
original. Some say that a sequel to Encanto is logical because of the film's huge  investment in the franchise. Jared Bush, who co-directed the original Encanto, has hinted that a sequel may be in the works. He said, &quot;I would love to spend more time in the Madrigal House and return to Encanto.” Generative Al is experimental" src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/encanto-2-2.jpg" />
</p>
<p>
The link in that first snippet was to the
<a href="https://ideas.fandom.com/wiki/Encanto_2:_A_New_Generation">Encanto
2: A New Generation</a> page on <a href="https://ideas.fandom.com/">Idea
Wiki</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
This is a fanon wiki, and just like fan-fiction wikis, this one has a
variety of fan created ideas on here! These include potential sequels
and new series that have yet to exist.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Other cited links included
<a href="https://screenrant.com/encanto-movie-live-action-images-mirabel-madrigal-family/">this
article about Instagram fan art</a> and
<a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/entertainment/news/encantos-sequel-chances-addressed-by-disney-director/ar-AA1u7ZJB">Encanto’s
Sequel Chances Addressed by Disney Director</a>, a very thin article
built around a short quote from Encanto’s director at D23 Brazil.
</p>
<p>
And that August 2024 release date (which the AI summary weirdly lists as
“scheduled for release” despite that date being five months in the
past)? It’s from the Idea Wiki imaginary info box for the film.
</p>
<p>
This is a particularly clear example of how badly wrong AI summarization
can go. LLMs are gullible: they believe what you tell them, and the web
is full of misleading information - some of which is completely
innocent.
</p>
<p id="hallucination">
<strong>Update</strong>: I’ve had some pushback over my use of the term
“hallucination” here, on the basis that the LLM itself is doing what
it’s meant to: summarizing the RAG content that has been provided to it
by the host system.
</p>
<p>
That’s fair: this is not a classic LLM hallucination, where the LLM
produces incorrect data purely from knowledge partially encoded in its
weights.
</p>
<p>
I classify this a bug in Google’s larger LLM-powered AI overview system.
That system should be able to take the existence of invalid data sources
into account - given how common searches for non-existent movie sequels
(or TV seasons) are, I would hope that AI overviews could classify such
searches and take extra steps to avoid serving misleading answers.
</p>
<p>
<p>So think this is a “hallucination” bug in the AI overview system
itself: it’s making statements about the world that are not true.</p>

<p>date: 2024-12-28, from: Chris Coyier blog</p>
<p>I’ve been noticing a certain type of ad placement lately I have no
better name for than “ads after you do a thing”. I’m sure they aren’t
new, they just feel new to me as I’ve been thinking about it. Examples:
What distinguishes these to me is that: they aren’t terribly annoying.

<h2 id="my-approach-to-building-large-technical-projects">My Approach to
Building Large Technical Projects</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-28, updated: 2024-12-28, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://mitchellh.com/writing/building-large-technical-projects">My
Approach to Building Large Technical Projects</a></strong>
</p>
Mitchell Hashimoto wrote this piece about taking on large projects back
in June 2023. The project he described in the post is a terminal
emulator written in Zig called
<a href="https://ghostty.org/">Ghostty</a> which just reached its
<a href="https://mitchellh.com/writing/ghostty-1-0-reflection">1.0
release</a>.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I’ve learned that when I break down my large tasks in chunks that result
in seeing tangible forward progress, I tend to finish my work and retain
my excitement throughout the project. People are all motivated and
driven in different ways, so this may not work for you, but as a broad
generalization I’ve not found an engineer who doesn’t get excited by a
good demo. And the goal is to always give yourself a good demo.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
For backend-heavy projects the lack of an initial UI is a challenge
here, so Mitchell advocates for early automated tests as a way to start
exercising code and seeing progress right from the start. Don’t let
tests get in the way of demos though:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
No matter what I’m working on, I try to build one or two demos per week
intermixed with automated test feedback as explained in the previous
section.
</p>
<p>
Building a demo also provides you with invaluable product feedback. You
can quickly intuit whether something <em>feels good</em>, even if it
isn’t fully functional.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
For more on the development of Ghostty see
<a href="https://mitchellh.com/writing/ghostty-and-useful-zig-patterns">this
talk</a> Mitchell gave at Zig Showtime last year:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I want the terminal to be a modern platform for text application
development, analogous to the browser being a modern platform for GUI
application development (for better or worse).
</p>

<p>
Looking back, it’s clear we overcomplicated things. While embeddings
fundamentally changed how we can represent and compare content, they
didn’t need an entirely new infrastructure category. What we label as
“vector databases” are, in reality, search engines with vector
capabilities. The market is already correcting this
categorization—vector search providers rapidly add traditional search
features while established search engines incorporate vector search
capabilities. This category convergence isn’t surprising: building a
good retrieval engine has always been about combining multiple retrieval
and ranking strategies. Vector search is just another powerful tool in
that toolbox, not a category of its own.
