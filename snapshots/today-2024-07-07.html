id="us-envoy-expresses-regret-over-alleged-military-sex-crimes-in-okinawa">US
envoy expresses regret over alleged military sex crimes in Okinawa</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Tokyo — U.S. Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel expressed regret
Saturday for the handling of two cases of sexual assaults allegedly
committed by American military personnel on Okinawa, which have again
stoked resentment of the heavy U.S. troop presence on the strategic
island in Japan’s far southwest.</p>
<p>The issue broke out late last month, triggering an uproar over
reports that two American service members had been charged with sexual
assaults months earlier.</p>
<p>Both cases were first reported in local media in late June. In one
arrest made in March, a member of the U.S. Air Force was charged with
the kidnapping and sexual assault of a teenager, and while in May a U.S.
Marine was arrested on charges of attempted rape resulting in injury.
Further details about the alleged victims were not released.</p>
<p>Okinawa police said they did not announce the cases out of privacy
considerations related to the victims. The Foreign Ministry, per police
decision, also did not notify Okinawa prefectural officials.</p>
<p>The cases are a reminder to many Okinawans of the 1995 rape of a
12-year-old girl by three U.S. service members, which sparked massive
protests of the U.S. presence. It led to a 1996 agreement between Tokyo
and Washington to close a key U.S. air base, although the plan has been
repeatedly delayed due to protests at the site designated for its
replacement on another part of the island.</p>
<p>Emanuel said he deeply regretted what happened to the individuals,
their families and their community, but fell short of apologizing.
“Obviously, you got to let the criminal justice process play out. But
that doesn’t mean you don’t express on a human level your sense of
regret.”</p>
<p>“We have to do better,” he said, adding that the U.S. military’s high
standards and protocols for education and training of its troops was
“just not working.”</p>
<p>Emanuel said the U.S. may be able to propose measures to improve
training and transparency with the public at U.S.-Japan foreign and
defense ministers’ security talks expected later this month in
Tokyo.</p>
<p>On Friday, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said the
Japanese authorities would do their utmost to provide more prompt
disclosures of alleged crime related to U.S. military personnel on
Okinawa while protecting victims’ privacy.</p>
<p>The cases could be a setback for the defense relationship at a time
when Okinawa is seen increasingly important in the face of rising
tensions with China.</p>
<p>Some 50,000 U.S. troops are deployed in Japan under a bilateral
security pact, about half of them on Okinawa, where residents have long
complained about heavy U.S. troop presence and related accidents, crime
and noise.</p>
<p>Emanuel commented on the issue while visiting Fukushima, on Japan’s
northeast coast.</p>
<p>Earlier Saturday, the ambassador visited the nearby town of
Minamisoma to join junior surfers and sample locally-caught flounder for
lunch, aiming to highlight the safety of the area’s seawater and seafood
amid ongoing discharges of treated and diluted radioactive water from
the tsunami-ruined Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.</p>
<p>China has banned Japanese seafood over the discharges, a move Emanuel
criticized as unjustified.</p>

id="despicable-me-4-debuts-raking-in-122.6-million-since-opening-wednesday">‘Despicable
Me 4’ debuts, raking in $122.6 million since opening Wednesday</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — After a historically bad first half of the year, the box
office is suddenly booming.</p>
<p>“Despicable Me 4,” the Illumination Animation sequel, led the way
over the holiday weekend with $75 million in ticket sales Friday through
Sunday and $122.6 million since opening Wednesday, according to studio
estimates Sunday.</p>
<p>The Independence Day holiday weekend haul for the Universal Pictures’
release further extends the considerable box-office reign of the
Minions, arguably the most bankable force in movies today. And it also
kept a summer streak going for Hollywood.</p>
<p>Though overall ticket sales were down more than 40% from levels prior
to the COVID 19 pandemic, heading into the summer moviegoing season,
theaters have lately seen a succession of hits. After Sony’s “Bad Boys:
Ride or Die” outperformed expectations, Pixar’s “Inside Out 2” rapidly
cleared $1 billion in ticket sales worldwide, making it the first
release since “Barbie” to reach that mark. Last weekend, the Paramount
prequel “A Quiet Place: Day One” also came in above expectations.</p>
<p>With “Deadpool &amp; Wolverine” tracking for a $160 million launch
later this month, Hollywood’s summer is looking up.</p>
<p>“If you look at the mood of the industry about eight weeks ago, very
different than today,” says Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for
Comscore. “The song says what a difference a day makes. What a
difference a month has made.”</p>
<p>It helps to have the Minions at your disposal. Since first debuting
in the 2010 original “Despicable Me,” each entry of the franchise —
including two sequels and two “Minions” spinoffs — has seemingly
guaranteed to gross around $1 billion. The four previous movies all made
between $939 million (2022’s “Minions: Rise of Gru”) and $1.26 billion
(2015’s “Minions”) globally.</p>
<p>That run has helped give Illumination founder and chief executive
Chris Meledandri one of the most enviable track records in Hollywood.
“Despicable Me 4,” directed by Chris Renaud and Patrick Delage, returns
the voice cast led by Steve Carell and Kristen Wiig and doubles down on
more Minion mayhem. Reviews (54% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) weren’t
particularly good for the latest installment, which includes a witness
protection plot and a group of Minions transformed into a superhero
squadron. But in their 12-year run, little has slowed down the
Minions.</p>
<p>“This is one of the most beloved franchises, quite frankly, in the
history of film, and certainly animation,” said Jim Orr, distribution
chief for Universal. “Chris Meledandri and Illumination have their
finger on the pulse of what families and audiences around the world want
to see.”</p>
<p>Family movies are powering the box office. “Despicable Me 4”
performed strongly despite the still considerable drawing power of
“Inside Out 2.” In its fourth weekend of release, the Pixar sequel added
another $30 million domestically and $78.3 million overseas.</p>
<p>“Inside Out 2,” with $1.22 billion in ticket sales thus far, is
easily the year’s biggest hit and fast climbing up the all-time ranks
for animated releases. It currently ranks as the No. 5 animated release
worldwide.</p>
<p>Instead of cannibalizing the opening weekend for “Despicable Me 4,”
“Inside Out 2” may have helped get families back in the habit of heading
to theaters.</p>
<p>“What happened, I think, is the release calendar finally settled into
a nice rhythm,” said Dergarabedian, referencing the jumbled movie
schedule from last year’s strikes. “It’s all about momentum.”</p>
<p>The continued strong sales for “Inside Out 2” were enough to put the
film in second place for the domestic weekend. Last week’s top new film,
“A Quiet Place: Day One,” slid to third with $21 million in its second
weekend, with another $21.1 million from overseas theaters. That was a
steep decrease of 60%, though the Paramount prequel has amassed $178.2
million worldwide in two weeks.</p>
<p>The run of hits has caused some studios to boost their forecasts for
the summer movie season. Heading into the most lucrative season at
theaters, analysts were predicting a $3 billion summer, down from the
more typical $4 billion mark. Now, closer to $3.4 billion appears
likely.</p>
<p>The weekend’s other top new release was Ti West’s “MaXXXine,” the
third in a string of slasher films from A24 starring Mia Goth. In 2,450
locations, “MaXXXine” collected $6.7 million in ticket sales, a
franchise best. The film, which follows “X” and “Pearl” (both released
in 2022), stars Goth as a 1980s Hollywood starlet being hunted by a
killer known as the Night Stalker.</p>
<p>Angel Studios, which last year released the unexpected summer hit
“Sound of Freedom,” struggled to find the same success with its latest
Christian film, “Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trot.” It debuted
with $3.2 million.</p>
<p>Kevin Costner’s big-budget gamble, “Horizon: An American Saga,”
didn’t do much to turn around its fortunes in its second weekend. The
first chapter in what Costner hopes will be a four-part franchise –
including a chapter two Warner Bros. will release in August – earned
$5.5 million in its second weekend. The film, which cost more than $100
million to make, has grossed $22.2 million in two weeks.</p>
<p>Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian
theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released
Monday.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>“Despicable Me 4,” $75 million.</p></li>
<li><p>“Inside Out 2,” $30 million.</p></li>
<li><p>“A Quiet Place Day One,” $21 million.</p></li>
<li><p>“MaXXXine,” $6.7 million.</p></li>

id="beryl-bears-down-on-texas-where-its-expected-to-hit-monday-and-regain-hurricane-strength">Beryl
bears down on Texas, where it’s expected to hit Monday and regain
hurricane strength</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MATAGORDA BAY, TEXAS — The outer bands of Beryl brought rain and
intensifying winds to Texas on Sunday as coastal residents boarded up
windows, left beach towns under evacuation orders and braced for the
tropical storm that forecasters expected to strengthen back into a
hurricane before landfall.</p>
<p>Much of Texas’ shoreline was under a hurricane warning and landfall
was expected early Monday. Officials in several coastal counties urged
tourists along the beach for the Fourth of July holiday to leave.</p>
<p>The earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 hurricane in the
Atlantic, Beryl caused at least 11 deaths as it passed through the
Caribbean on its way to Texas. The storm ripped off doors, windows and
roofs with devastating winds and storm surge fueled by the Atlantic’s
record warmth.</p>
<p>“We’re seeing the outer bands of Beryl approach the Texas coast now
and the weather should be going downhill especially this afternoon and
evening,” Eric Blake, a senior hurricane specialist with the National
Hurricane Center, said Sunday morning. “People should definitely be in
their safe space by nightfall and we’re expecting the hurricane to make
landfall somewhere in the middle Texas coast overnight.”</p>
<p>Beryl would be the 10th hurricane to hit Texas in July since 1851 and
the fourth in the last 25 years, according to Colorado State University
hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach.</p>
<p>Three times in its one week of life, Beryl has gained 56 kilometers
per hour in wind speed in 24 hours or less, the official weather service
definition of rapid intensification.</p>
<p>Beryl’s explosive growth into an unprecedented early whopper of a
storm shows the literal hot water of the Atlantic and Caribbean, and
what the Atlantic hurricane belt can expect for the rest of the storm
season, experts said.</p>
<p>Texas officials warned people along the entire coastline to prepare
for possible flooding, heavy rain and wind. The hurricane warning
extended from Baffin Bay, south of Corpus Christi, to Sargent, south of
Houston.</p>
<p>Beryl lurked as another potential heavy rain event for Houston, where
storms in recent months have knocked out power across the nation’s
fourth-largest city and flooded neighborhoods. A flash flood watch was
in effect for a wide swath of the Texas coast, where forecasters
expected Beryl to dump as much as 25 centimeters of rain in some
areas.</p>
<p>Potential storm surges between 1.2 and 1.8 meters above ground level
were forecast around Matagorda. The warnings extended to the same
coastal areas where Hurricane Harvey came ashore in 2017 as a Category 4
hurricane, which was far more powerful than Beryl’s expected intensity
by the time the storm reaches landfall.</p>
<p>In Port Lavaca, Jimmy May was boarding up his business Jimmy Hayes
Electric on Sunday to protect the glass, “in case we get a little bit
too much wind, too much trash blowing,” he said. He said he wasn’t
concerned about the forecasted high winds or possible storm surge in
town but people in lower-lying areas “need to get out of there.”</p>
<p>Those looking to catch a flight out of the area could find that
option more difficult as Beryl closes in on the Texas coast. While the
majority of flights from Houston’s two major commercial airports were
leaving on time as of midday Sunday, more than 65 flights had been
delayed and another four canceled, according to FlightAware data.</p>
<p>In Corpus Christi, officials asked visitors to cut their trips short
and return home early if possible. Residents were advised to secure
homes by boarding up windows if necessary and using sandbags to guard
against possible flooding.</p>
<p>Traffic was nonstop for the past three days at an Ace Hardware store
in the city as customers bought tarps, rope, duct tape, sandbags and
generators, employee Elizabeth Landry said Saturday.</p>
<p>“They’re just worried about the wind, the rain,” she said. “They’re
wanting to prepare just in case.”</p>
<p>Ben Koutsoumbaris, general manager of Island Market on Corpus
Christi’s Padre Island, said there has been “definitely a lot of buzz
about the incoming storm,” with customers stocking up on food and
drinks, particularly meat and beer.</p>
<p>The White House said Sunday that the Federal Emergency Management
Agency had sent emergency responders, search-and-rescue teams, bottled
water, and other resources along the coast.</p>
<p>Some coastal cities called for voluntary evacuations in low-lying
areas that are prone to flooding, banned beach camping and urged
tourists traveling on the Fourth of July holiday weekend to move
recreational vehicles from coastal parks. In Refugio County, north of
Corpus Christi, officials issued a mandatory evacuation order for its
6,700 residents.</p>
<p>Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is acting governor while Gov. Greg Abbott
is traveling in Taiwan, issued a preemptive disaster declaration for 121
counties.</p>
<p>Beryl this past week battered Mexico as a Category 2 hurricane,
toppling trees but causing no injuries or deaths before weakening to a
tropical storm as it moved across the Yucatan Peninsula.</p>
<p>Before hitting Mexico, Beryl wrought destruction in Jamaica,
St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and Barbados. Three people were reported
dead in Grenada, three in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, three in
Venezuela and two in Jamaica.</p>

residents a respite from the influx.</p>
<p>A measure that would ban cruise ships with 250 or more passengers
from docking in Juneau on Saturdays qualified for the Oct. 1 municipal
ballot, setting the stage for a debate about how much tourism is too
much in a city that is experiencing first-hand the impacts of climate
change. The measure would also ban ships on July 4, a day when locals
flock to a downtown parade.</p>
<p>The “ship-free Saturdays” initiative that qualified last week will go
to voters unless the local Assembly enacts a similar measure by Aug. 15,
which is seen as unlikely.</p>
<p>Juneau, accessible only by water or air, is home to the Mendenhall
Glacier, a major draw for the cruise passengers who arrive on
multi-story ships towering over parts of the modest downtown skyline.
Many residents of this city of about 32,000 have concerns about
increased traffic, congested trails and the frequent buzz of
sight-seeing helicopters transporting visitors to the Mendenhall and
other glaciers.</p>
<p>Deborah Craig, who has lived in Juneau for decades, supports
ship-free Saturdays. Craig, who lives across the channel from where the
ships dock, often hears their early-morning fog horns and broadcast
announcements made to passengers that are audible across the water.</p>
<p>The current “overwhelming” number of visitors diminishes what
residents love so much about Juneau, she said.</p>
<p>“It’s about preserving the lifestyle that keeps us in Juneau, which
is about clean air, clean water, pristine environment and easy access to
trails, easy access to water sports and nature,” she said of the
initiative.</p>
<p>“There’s this perception that some people are not welcoming of
tourists, and that’s not the case at all,” Craig said. “It’s about
volume. It’s about too much — too many in a short period of time
overwhelming a small community.”</p>
<p>The current cruise season runs from early April to late October.</p>
<p>Opponents of the initiative say limiting dockings will hurt local
businesses that rely heavily on tourism and could invite lawsuits. A
voter-approved limit on cruise passenger numbers in Bar Harbor, Maine,
another community with a significant tourism economy, was challenged in
federal court.</p>
<p>Laura McDonnell, a business leader who owns Caribou Crossings, a gift
shop in Juneau’s downtown tourist core, said she makes 98% of her annual
revenue during the summer season.</p>
<p>Tourism is about all the “local businesses that rely on cruise
passengers and our place in the community,” said McDonnell, who is
involved in Protect Juneau’s Future, which opposes the initiative.</p>
<p>Some schools recently closed due to factors including declining
enrollment, while the regional economy faces challenges, she said.</p>
<p>“I think that as a community, we really need to look at what’s at
stake for our economy,” she said. “We are not in a position to be
shrinking our economy.”</p>
<p>The cruise industry accounted for $375 million in direct spending in
Juneau in 2023, most of that attributable to spending by passengers,
according to a report prepared for the city by McKinley Research Group
LLC.</p>
<p>After a two-year pandemic lull, cruise passenger numbers rose sharply
in Juneau, hitting a record of more than 1.6 million in 2023. Under this
year’s schedule, Sept. 21 will be the first day since early May with no
large ships in town.</p>
<p>The tourism debate is polarizing, and the city has been trying to
find a middle ground, said Alexandra Pierce, Juneau’s visitor industry
director. But she noted there also needs to be a regional solution.</p>
<p>If the Juneau initiative passes, it will impact other, smaller
communities in southeast Alaska because the ships, generally on trips
originating in Seattle or Vancouver, Canada, will have to go somewhere
if they can’t dock in Juneau on Saturdays, she said.</p>
<p>Some residents in Sitka, south of Juneau, are in the early stages of
trying to limit cruise visitation to that small, island community, which
is near a volcano.</p>
<p>Juneau and major cruise lines, including Carnival Corp., Disney
Cruise Line, Norwegian Cruise Line and Royal Caribbean Group, agreed to
a limit of five large ships a day, which took effect this year. They
more recently signed a pact, set to take effect in 2026, seeking a daily
limit of 16,000 cruise passengers Sundays through Fridays and 12,000 on
Saturdays.</p>
<p>Pierce said the overall goal is to keep total cruise passenger
visitation around 1.6 million, and to even out daily numbers of visitors
that can spike to about 18,000 on the busiest days and feel “a bit
suffocating.” Juneau traditionally has been the most popular cruise port
in the state.</p>
<p>A number of projects around Juneau are expected to help make existing
cruise numbers feel less impactful. Those include plans for a gondola at
the city-owned ski area and increased visitor capacity at the Mendenhall
Glacier recreation area, she said.</p>
<p>Renée Limoge Reeve, vice president of government and community
relations for the trade group Cruise Lines International Association
Alaska, said the agreements signed with the city were the first of their
kind in Alaska.</p>
<p>The best strategy is “ongoing, direct dialogue with local
communities” and working together in a way that also provides a
predictable source of income for local businesses, she said.</p>
<p>Protect Juneau’s Future, led by local business leaders, said the
success of the ballot measure would mean a loss of sales tax revenue and
millions of dollars in direct spending by cruise passengers. The group
was confident voters would reject the measure, its steering committee
said in a statement.</p>
<p>Karla Hart, a sponsor of the initiative and frequent critic of the
cruise industry, said the threat of litigation has kept communities from
taking steps to limit cruise numbers in the past. She was heartened by
legal wins this year in the ongoing fight over the measure passed in Bar
Harbor, a popular destination near Maine’s Acadia National Park.</p>
<p>She believes the Juneau initiative will pass.</p>

heat bakes millions in large swaths of US, setting records and fanning
wildfires</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Las Vegas — Roughly 130 million people were under threat over the
weekend and into next week from a long-running heat wave that broke or
tied records with dangerously high temperatures and is expected to
shatter more from East Coast to West Coast, forecasters said.</p>
<p>Ukiah, north of San Francisco, hit 117 degrees Fahrenheit (47 degrees
Celsius) on Saturday, breaking the city’s record for the date and tying
its all-time high. Livermore, east of San Francisco, hit 111 F (43.8 C),
breaking the daily maximum temperature record of 109 F (42.7 C) set more
than a century ago in 1905.</p>
<p>Las Vegas tied the record of 115 F (46 C), last reached in 2007, and
Phoenix topped out at 114 F (45.5 C), just shy of the record of 116 F
(46.7 C) dating to 1942.</p>
<p>The National Weather Service said it was extending the excessive heat
warning for much of the Southwest through Friday.</p>
<p>“A dangerous and historic heatwave is just getting started across the
area, with temperatures expected to peak during the Sunday-Wednesday
timeframe,” the National Weather Service in Las Vegas said in an updated
forecast.</p>
<p>In Las Vegas, where the mercury hit 100 F (37.7 C) by 10:30 a.m.,
Marko Boscovich said the best way to beat the heat is in a seat at a
slot machine with a cold beer inside an air-conditioned casino.</p>
<p>“But you know, after it hits triple digits it’s about all the same to
me,” said Boscovich, who was visiting from Sparks, Nevada to see a Dead
&amp; Company concert Saturday night at the Sphere. “Maybe they’ll play
one of my favorites — ‘Cold Rain and Snow.’”</p>
<p>In more humid parts of the country, temperatures could spike above
100 F (about 38 C) in parts of the Pacific Northwest, the mid-Atlantic
and the Northeast, said Jacob Asherman, a weather service
meteorologist.</p>
<p>Heat records shattered across the Southwest</p>
<p>Meteorologists predicted that temperatures would be near daily
records in the region through most, if not all, of the coming week, with
lower desert highs reaching 115 to 120 degrees F (46.1 to 48.8 C).</p>
<p>Rare heat advisories were extended even into higher elevations
including around Lake Tahoe, on the border of California and Nevada,
with the National Weather Service in Reno, Nevada, warning of “major
heat risk impacts, even in the mountains.”</p>
<p>“How hot are we talking? Well, high temperatures across (western
Nevada and northeastern California) won’t get below 100 degrees (37.8 C)
until next weekend,” the service posted online. “And unfortunately,
there won’t be much relief overnight either.”</p>
<p>Indeed, Reno hit a high of 104 F (40 C) on Saturday, smashing the old
record of 101 F (38.3 C).</p>
<p>More extreme highs are in the near forecast, including 129 F (53.8 C)
for Sunday at Furnace Creek, California, in Death Valley National Park,
and then around 130 F (54.4 C) through Wednesday.</p>
<p>The hottest temperature ever officially recorded on Earth was 134 F
(56.67 C) in July 1913 in Death Valley, eastern California, though some
experts dispute that measurement and say the real record was 130 F (54.4
C), recorded there in July 2021.</p>
<p>The worst is yet to come across the West and mid-Atlantic</p>
<p>Triple-digit temperatures are likely in the West, between 15 and 30 F
(8 and 16 C) higher than average into next week, the National Weather
Service said.</p>
<p>The Eastern U.S. also was bracing for more hot temperatures.
Baltimore and others parts of Maryland were under an excessive heat
warning as heat index values could climb to 110 F (43 C), forecasters
said.</p>
<p>“Drink plenty of fluids, stay in an air-conditioned room, stay out of
the sun, and check up on relatives and neighbors,” read a National
Weather Service advisory for the Baltimore area. “Young children and
pets should never be left unattended in vehicles under any
circumstances.”</p>
<p>Deaths are starting to mount</p>
<p>In Arizona’s Maricopa County, which encompasses Phoenix, there have
been at least 13 confirmed heat-related deaths this year, along with
more than 160 other deaths suspected of being related to heat that are
still under investigation, according to a recent report.</p>
<p>That does not include the death of a 10-year-old boy last week in
Phoenix who suffered a “heat-related medical event” while hiking with
family at South Mountain Park and Preserve, according to police.</p>
<p>California wildfires fanned by low humidity, high temperatures</p>
<p>Firefighters dispatched aircraft and helicopters to drop water or
retardant on a series of wildfires in California.</p>
<p>In Santa Barbara County, northwest of Los Angeles, the Lake Fire has
scorched more than 19 square miles (49 square kilometers) of grass,
brush and timber. Firefighters said the blaze was displaying “extreme
fire behavior” and had the “potential for large growth” with high
temperatures and low humidity.</p>
<p>Festival revelers meet the heat with cold water and shade</p>
<p>At the Waterfront Blues Festival in Portland, Oregon, music fans
coped by drinking cold water, seeking shade or freshening up under water
misters. Organizers of the weekend revelries also advertised free access
to air conditioning in a nearby hotel.</p>
<p>Angelica Quiroz, 31, kept her scarf and hat wet and applied
sunscreen.</p>
<p>“Definitely a difference between the shade and the sun,” Quiroz said
Friday. “But when you’re in the sun, it feels like you’re cooking.”</p>

<h2 id="nato-to-discuss-russia-north-korea-military-cooperation">NATO to
discuss Russia-North Korea military cooperation</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The NATO summit scheduled for this week will include a
discussion among the allies about strengthening security ties with South
Korea and Japan against deepening military cooperation between Russia
and North Korea, experts said.</p>
<p>The leaders of 32 NATO members will convene in Washington July 9 to
11 to discuss ways to provide continued military support to Ukraine to
help it defend itself against Russia, which invaded more than two years
ago.</p>
<p>Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea — sometimes referred to
as the Indo-Pacific 4 or IP4 — are invited to the NATO summit. The
United States, Japan and South Korea plan to meet on the sidelines of
the summit.</p>
<p>Among the items that analysts expect NATO to discuss with Japan and
South Korea is the growing military cooperation between Russia and North
Korea.</p>
<p>“The Russian-North Korean agreement is a problem for both NATO
countries and for the countries in the Northeast Asia,” said Bruce
Bennett, a senior defense analyst at the RAND Corporation.</p>
<p>“I expect that it will be discussed at this meeting. It may become a
critical aspect of the meeting, if, by that time, intelligence is saying
that North Korea is sending many military personnel to support Russia in
Ukraine,” Bennett said.</p>
<p>After Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim
Jong Un signed a mutual defense pact in Pyongyang last month, some
speculated that North Korea could dispatch army engineers to
Russian-occupied Donetsk to rebuild the war-torn region.</p>
<p>Pentagon press secretary Major General Patrick Ryder said at a press
conference on June 25 that the U.S. is keeping an eye on a possible
dispatch of troops but warned North Korea about sending military forces,
saying they would be “cannon fodder in an illegal war against
Ukraine.”</p>
<p>North Korea on June 27 renewed its support for Russia’s war against
Ukraine, saying, “We will always be on the side of the Russian army” in
“the war of justice.”</p>
<p>Both Washington and Seoul have estimated that Pyongyang sent about
10,000 containers of munitions to Russia. Moscow and Pyongyang denied
arms exchanges between the two.</p>
<p>But in the defense pact that Putin and Kim signed last month, they
agreed to set up ways to bolster their defense capabilities and openly
announced possible military and technical cooperation.</p>
<p>“NATO members will discuss the implications of closer Russia-North
Korea relations and how best to respond, including in terms of risks and
opportunities,” said Matthew Brummer, a professor at the National
Graduate Institute for Policy Studies in Tokyo.</p>
<p>“Risks primarily include material outcomes, such as how North Korea
involvement will come to bear on warfighting in Ukraine. But there are
also opportunities to be exploited, including how to use increased North
Korea involvement to drive a wedge between China and Russia,” he
said.</p>
<p>“The reemerging axis between China, Russia and North Korea has most
certainly precipitated the security link between Europe and Asia. As a
result, I expect increased NATO involvement in East Asia, especially
with Japan, which is the world’s greatest latent military power,”
Brummer said.</p>
<p>Beijing said that it is keeping “a close eye” on the NATO summit and
that it hopes the summit does not “target any third party.”</p>
<p>Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington,
told VOA on Tuesday that “the Asia-Pacific lies beyond the geographical
scope of the North Atlantic” and that “NATO’s attempt to make eastward
inroads into the Asia-Pacific will inevitably undermine regional peace
and stability.”</p>
<p>“The countries and people in this region are on high alert against
this and firmly oppose any words or actions designed to bring military
blocs into this region and stoke division and confrontation,” he
said.</p>
<p>The U.S. State Department did not respond to an inquiry by VOA’s
Korean Service seeking a response to Beijing’s comments.</p>
<p>Luis Simon, director of the Elcano Royal Institute in Brussels,
Belgium, said he would not rule out NATO countries conducting joint
military exercises with its East Asian partners “in the Korean Peninsula
context rather than in a China context” because it offers
“diplomatically an easier entry point.”</p>
<p>At the same time, he said, “It will be more with NATO allies rather
than the NATO as a whole because NATO as a whole is very clear about
being laser focused” on defending Ukraine.</p>
<p>The Japan Air Self-Defense Force announced on June 25 that it will
hold a series of joint drills in July with Germany, Spain and France —
all NATO members.</p>
<p>David Maxwell, vice president of the Center for Asia Pacific
Strategy, also said that bilateral arrangements between South Korea and
individual NATO countries could be possible as “a number of NATO
countries are member states of the United Nations Command.”</p>
<p>The U.N. Command is a multinational military body created during the
Korean War of 1950-53 to defend against North Korean aggression.</p>
<p>Some analysts said there are limits to NATO’s involvement in the
Indo-Pacific.</p>
<p>“Most of the countries in NATO are focused on the Atlantic area, and
those who have projection capabilities” that can go beyond that “have
rather small ones,” said Barry Posen, Ford international professor of
political science at MIT.</p>
<p>William Ruger, a nonresident senior fellow at Defense Priorities,
said U.S. “capabilities, material and policy bandwidth” are not
sufficient to deal with the security of both Europe and Asia.</p>

<h2
id="sizzling-sidewalks-unshaded-playgrounds-pose-risk-of-burns">Sizzling
sidewalks, unshaded playgrounds pose risk of burns</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PHOENIX, Arizona — Ron Falk lost his right leg, had extensive skin
grafting on the left one and is still recovering a year after collapsing
on the searing asphalt outside a Phoenix convenience store where he
stopped for a cold soda during a heat wave.</p>
<p>Now using a wheelchair, the 62-year-old lost his job and his home.
He’s recovering at a medical respite center for patients with no other
place to go; there he gets physical therapy and treatment for a
bacterial infection in what remains of his right leg, which is too
swollen to use the prosthesis he’d hoped would help him walk again.</p>
<p>“If you don’t get somewhere to cool down, the heat will affect you,”
said Falk, who lost consciousness due to heat stroke. “Then you won’t
know what’s happening, like in my case.”</p>
<p>Sizzling sidewalks and unshaded playgrounds pose risks for surface
burns as air temperatures reach new summertime highs in Southwest U.S.
cities such as Phoenix, which just recorded its hottest June on record.
The average daytime high was 43 degrees Celsius (109.5 degrees
Fahrenheit), without a single 24-hour high below 37.7 Celsius (100
Fahrenheit).</p>
<p>Young children, older adults and homeless people are especially at
risk for contact burns, which can occur in seconds when skin touches a
surface of 82 C (180 F).</p>
<p>Since the beginning of June, 50 people have been hospitalized with
such burns, and four have died at Valleywise Health Medical Center in
Phoenix, which operates the Southwest’s largest burn center, serving
patients from six states, according to its director, Dr. Kevin Foster.
About 80% were injured in metro Phoenix.</p>
<p>Last year, the center admitted 136 patients for surface burns from
June through August, up from 85 during the same period in 2022, Foster
said. Fourteen died. One out of five were homeless.</p>
<p>“Last year’s record heat wave brought an alarming number of patients
with life-threatening burns,” Foster said of a 31-day period with
temperatures at or above 43 C (110 F) during Phoenix’s hottest
summer.</p>
<p>In Las Vegas, which regularly sees summertime highs in the triple
digits, 22 people were hospitalized in June alone at the University
Medical Center’s Lions Burn Care Center, said spokesperson Scott Kerbs.
That’s nearly half as many as the 46 hospitalized during all three
summer months last year.</p>
<p>As in Phoenix, the desert sun punishes Las Vegas for hours every day,
frying outdoor surfaces such as asphalt, concrete and metal doors on
cars and playground equipment such as swings and monkey bars.</p>
<p>Contact with pavement</p>
<p>Surface burn victims often include children injured walking barefoot
on concrete or touching hot surfaces, adults who collapsed on a sidewalk
while intoxicated, and older people who fell on the pavement due to heat
stroke or another medical emergency.</p>
<p>Some don’t survive.</p>
<p>Thermal injuries were among the main or contributing causes of last
year’s 645 heat-related deaths in Maricopa County, which encompasses
Phoenix.</p>
<p>One victim was an 82-year-old woman with dementia and heart disease
admitted to a suburban Phoenix hospital after being found on the
scorching pavement on an August day that hit 41.1 C (106 F).</p>
<p>With a body temperature of 40.5 C (105 F), the woman was rushed to
the hospital with second-degree burns on her back and right side,
covering 8% of her body. She died three days later.</p>
<p>Many surface burn patients also suffered potentially fatal heat
stroke.</p>
<p>Valleywise hospital’s emergency department recently adopted a new
protocol for all heat stroke victims: submerging patients in a bag of
slushy ice to quickly bring down body temperature.</p>
<p>Recovery for those with skin burns was often lengthy, with patients
undergoing multiple skin grafts and other surgeries, followed by months
of recovery in skilled nursing or rehabilitation facilities.</p>
<p>Bob Woolley, 71, suffered second- and third-degree burns to his
hands, arms, leg and torso after he stumbled onto the broiling backyard
rock garden at his Phoenix home while wearing only swim trunks and a
tank top.</p>
<p>“The ordeal was extremely painful; it was almost unbearable,” said
Woolley, who was hospitalized at the Valleywise burn center for several
months. He said he considers himself “95% recovered” after extensive
skin grafts and physical therapy and has resumed some former activities
such as swimming and motorcycle riding.  </p>
<p>Children among the burned</p>
<p>Some burn victims in Phoenix and Las Vegas were children.</p>
<p>“In many cases, this involves toddlers walking or crawling onto hot
surfaces,” Kerbs said of those hospitalized at the Las Vegas center.</p>
<p>Foster said about 20% of the hospitalized and outpatient skin-burn
victims seen at the Phoenix center are children.</p>
<p>Small children aren’t fully aware of the harm a sizzling metal door
handle or a scorching sidewalk can cause.</p>
<p>“Because they’re playing, they don’t pay attention,” said urban
climatologist Ariane Middel, an assistant professor at Arizona State
University who directs the SHaDE Lab, a research team that studies the
effects of urban heat.</p>
<p>“They may not even notice that it’s hot.”</p>
<p>In measuring surface temperatures of playground equipment, the team
found that in 37.7-degree C (100 F) weather without shade, a slide can
heat up to 71.1 C (160 F), but a covering can bring that down to 43.8 C
(111 F). A rubber ground cover can hit as high as 86.6 C (188 F), a
handrail can heat up to 48.8 C (120 F) and concrete can reach 55.5 C
(132 F).</p>
<p>Many metro Phoenix parks have covered picnic tables and plastic
fabric stretched over play equipment, keeping metal or plastic surfaces
up to 30 degrees Fahrenheit cooler. But plenty do not, Middel said.</p>
<p>She said cooler wood chips are better underfoot than rubber mats,
which were designed to protect kids from head injuries but soak up heat
in the broiling sun. Like rubber, artificial turf gets hotter than
asphalt.</p>
<p>“We need to think about alternative surface types, because most
surfaces we use for our infrastructure are heat sponges,” Middel
said.</p>
<p>Pets in danger, too</p>
<p>Hot concrete and asphalt also pose burn risks for pets.</p>
<p>Veterinarians recommend dogs wear booties to protect their paws

Owners are also advised to make sure their pets drink plenty of water
and don’t get overheated. Phoenix bans dogs from the city’s popular
hiking trails on days the National Weather Service issues an excessive
heat warning.</p>
<p>Recovering at Phoenix’s Circle the City, a respite care facility he
was sent to after being released from Valleywise’s burn unit, Falk said
he never imagined the Phoenix heat could cause him to collapse on the
broiling asphalt in his shorts and T-shirt.</p>
<p>Because he wasn’t carrying identification or a phone, no one knew
where he was for months. He has a long road ahead but still hopes to
regain part of his old life, working for a concessionaire for

up and said, ’Hey, wait, I lost a leg.’ But that doesn’t mean you’re
useless.”</p>

id="north-dakota-tribe-goes-back-to-its-roots-with-a-massive-greenhouse-operation">North
Dakota tribe goes back to its roots with a massive greenhouse
operation</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BISMARCK, North Dakota — A Native American tribe in North Dakota will
soon grow lettuce in a giant greenhouse complex that when fully
completed will be among the country’s largest, enabling the tribe to
grow much of its own food decades after a federal dam flooded the land
where they had cultivated corn, beans and other crops for millennia.</p>
<p>Work is ongoing on the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation’s
1.3-hectare greenhouse that will make up most of the Native Green Grow
operation’s initial phase. However, enough of the structure will be
completed this summer to start growing leafy greens and other crops such
as tomatoes and strawberries.</p>
<p>“We’re the first farmers of this land,” Tribal Chairman Mark Fox
said. “We once were part of an Aboriginal trade center for thousands and
thousands of years because we grew crops — corn, beans, squash,
watermelons — all these things at massive levels, so all the tribes
depended on us greatly as part of the Aboriginal trade system.”</p>
<p>The tribe will spend roughly $76 million on the initial phase, which
also will include a warehouse and other facilities near the tiny town of
Parshall. It plans to add to the growing space in the coming years,
eventually totaling about 5.9 hectares, which officials say would make
it one of the world’s largest facilities of its type.</p>
<p>The tribe’s fertile land along the Missouri River was inundated in
the mid-1950s when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers built the Garrison
Dam, which created Lake Sakakawea.</p>
<p>Getting fresh produce has long been a challenge in the area of
western North Dakota where the tribe is based, on the Fort Berthold
Indian Reservation. The rolling, rugged landscape — split by Lake
Sakakawea — is a long drive from the state’s biggest cities, Bismarck
and Fargo.</p>
<p>That isolation makes the greenhouses all the more important, as they
will enable the tribe to provide food to the roughly 8,300 people on the
Fort Berthold reservation and to reservations elsewhere. The tribe also
hopes to stock food banks that serve isolated and impoverished areas in
the region, and plans to export its produce.</p>
<p>Initially, the MHA Nation expects to grow nearly 907,000 kilograms of
food a year and for that to eventually increase to 5.4 million to 6.4
million kilograms annually. Fox said the operation’s first phase will
create 30 to 35 jobs.</p>
<p>The effort coincides with a national move to increase food
sovereignty among tribes.</p>
<p>Supply chain disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic led tribes
nationwide to use federal coronavirus aid to invest in food systems,
including underground greenhouses in South Dakota to feed the local
community, said Heather Dawn Thompson, director of the U.S. Department
of Agriculture’s Office of Tribal Relations. In Oklahoma, multiple
tribes are running or building their own meat processing plant, she
said.</p>
<p>The USDA promotes its Indigenous Food Sovereignty Initiative, which
“really challenges us to think about food and the way we do business at
USDA from an Indigenous, tribal lens,” Thompson said. Examples include
Indigenous seed hubs, foraging videos and guides, cooking videos and a
meat processing program for Indigenous animals.</p>
<p>“We have always been a very independent, sovereign people that have
been able to hunt, gather, grow and feed ourselves, and forces have
intervened over the last century that have disrupted those independent
food resources, and it made it very challenging. But the desire and goal
has always been there,” said Thompson, whose tribal affiliation is
Cheyenne River Sioux.</p>
<p>The MHA Nation’s greenhouse plans are possible in large part because
of access to potable water and natural gas resources.</p>
<p>The natural gas released in North Dakota’s Bakken oil field has long
been seen by critics as a waste and environmental concern, but Fox said
the tribal nation intends to capture and compress that gas to heat and
power the greenhouse and process into fertilizer.</p>
<p>Flaring, in which natural gas is burned off from pipes that emerge
from the ground, has been a longtime issue in the No. 3 oil-producing
state.</p>
<p>North Dakota Pipeline Authority Director Justin Kringstad said that
key to capturing the gas is building needed infrastructure, as the MHA
Nation intends to do.</p>
<p>“With those operators that are trying to get to that level of zero,
it’s certainly going to take more infrastructure, more buildout of
pipes, processing plants, all of the above to stay on top of this
issue,” he said.</p>
<p>The Fort Berthold Reservation had nearly 3,000 active wells in April,
when oil production totaled 203,000 barrels a day on the reservation.
Oil production has helped the MHA Nation build schools, roads, housing
and medical facilities, Fox said.</p>

<h2 id="ready-to-come-out-scientists-emerge-after-year-on-mars">‘Ready
to come out?’ Scientists emerge after year ‘on Mars’</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The NASA astronaut knocks loudly three times on what
appears to be a nondescript door and calls cheerfully: “You ready to
come out?” </p>
<p>The reply is inaudible, but beneath his mask he appears to be
grinning as he yanks the door open, and four scientists who have spent a
year away from all other human contact, simulating a mission to Mars,
spill out to cheers and applause. </p>
<p>Anca Selariu, Ross Brockwell, Nathan Jones and team leader Kelly
Haston have spent the past 378 days sealed inside the “Martian” habitat
in Houston, Texas, part of NASA’s research into what it will take to put
humans on the Red Planet.  </p>
<p>They have been growing vegetables, conducting “Marswalks,” and
operating under what NASA terms “additional stressors,” such as
communication delays with “Earth,” including their families; isolation
and confinement.  </p>
<p>It’s the kind of experience that would make anyone who lived through
pandemic lockdowns shudder, but all four were beaming as they reemerged
Saturday, their hair slightly more unruly and their emotion apparent.
 </p>
<p>“Hello. It’s actually so wonderful just to be able to say hello to
you,” Haston, a biologist, said with a laugh. </p>
<p>“I really hope I don’t cry standing up here in front of all of you,”
Jones, an emergency room doctor, said as he took to the microphone, and
nearly doing just that several moments later as he spotted his wife in
the crowd.  </p>
<p>The habitat, dubbed Mars Dune Alpha, is a 3D-printed,
160-square-meter facility, complete with bedrooms, a gym, common areas,
and a vertical farm for growing food. </p>
<p>An outdoor area, separated by an airlock, is filled with red sand and
is where the team donned suits to conduct their “Marswalks,” though it
is still covered rather than being open air. </p>
<p>“They have spent more than a year in this habitat conducting crucial
science, most of it nutrition-based and how that impacts their
performance … as we prepare to send people on to the Red Planet,” Steve
Koerner told the crowd. Koerner is the deputy director at NASA’s Johnson
Space Center. </p>
<p>“I’m very appreciative,” he added. </p>
<p>This mission is the first of a series of three planned by NASA,
grouped under the title CHAPEA — Crew Health and Performance Exploration
Analog. </p>
<p>A yearlong mission simulating life on Mars took place in 2015-2016 in
a habitat in Hawaii, and although NASA participated in it, it was not at
the helm. </p>
<p>Under its Artemis program, America plans to send humans back to the
Moon to learn how to live there long-term to help prepare a trip to
Mars, sometime towards the end of the 2030s.</p>

<h2 id="android-15-could-include-a-desktop-mode-but-what-for">Android 15
could include a desktop mode — but what for?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-06, from: OS News</p>
<p>If there was ever a “will they, won’t they?” love story in mobile
computing, it’s definitely Google’s on and off again relationship with
Android’s desktop mode. There have been countless hints, efforts, and
code pertaining to the mythical desktop mode for Android, but so far,
Google has never flipped the switch and made it available. It’s 2024,
Android 15 development is in full swing, and it seems Google and
Android’s desktop mode are dating again. This past spring, Google added
DisplayPort support to the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro in a Feature Drop
update, allowing for easy wired connections to external monitors. Then,
tinkering in Android 14 QPR3 Beta 2.1, Mishaal Rahman was able to get a
new desktop interface up and running, complete with Android apps running
in resizeable floating windows. It’s not confirmed that Android 15 will
ship with a built-in desktop mode, but the bones are there. It does make
me wonder, though: why? What would a desktop interface add to Android? ↫
Taylor Kerns at Android Police I’m actually fairly convinced Android
could, indeed, serve as an excellent desktop operating system, but
without any official backing by Google, it’s always been a massive hack
to use Android with a mouse and keyboard. It’s not so much the hardware
support – it’s all there – but rather the software support, and the
clunky way common Android UI tasks feel when performing them with a
mouse. I’ve installed Android desktop ‘distributions’ countless times,
and the third-party hacks they use, like clunky taskbars and custom
menus and so on, make for a horrid user experience. Samsung DEX seems to
be the only somewhat successful attempt at adding a desktop mode to
Android, but it can’t be installed on any regular PC or laptop, and
requires cumbersome cabling or expensive docks, making it more of a
curiosity than a true desktop mode in the sense most of us are thinking
of. This feature needs to come from Google itself, and it needs to be
something third parties can use in their ROMs and x86 builds so we can
truly use Android on a desktop. I don’t believe that’s going to happen,
though. It’s clear Google is more interested in pushing Chrome OS for
desktop and laptop use, and it seems more likely that any desktop mode
that gets added to Android is going to be similar in nature to DEX –
something you can only use by hooking up your phone to a display and
configuring wireless input devices. Cool, but not exactly something that
will turn Android into a desktop contender.</p>

Congratulations! You hired your first technical writer. At some point
you must have realized that you needed one, lest your product becomes a
user nightmare. Or perhaps you thought that hiring a writer would free
your developers from writing documentation and feel more “agile”.
Whatever your motivation, you had the courage to hire a documentarian,
and for that we applaud you. Now, how can you make sure your tech writer

I think I sense a theme in Final Cut Pro UI elements: it goes out of its
way to avoid using the system keyboard for data entry.
</p>
<p>
And come to think of it, the TextField with a keyboard is really a bad
UI for entering numbers.

<p>
Lots of wasted space when all you need are the top row, “.” and

coast braces for Beryl, expected to regain hurricane strength</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>houston, texas — Texas officials Saturday urged coastal residents to
brace for a potential hit by Beryl as the storm is expected to regain
hurricane strength in the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico. </p>
<p>“We’re expecting the storm to make landfall somewhere on the Texas
coast sometime Monday, if the current forecast is correct,” said Jack
Beven, a senior hurricane specialist at the National Hurricane Center in
Miami. “Should that happen, it’ll most likely be a Category 1
hurricane.” </p>
<p>The earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 hurricane in the
Atlantic, Beryl caused at least 11 deaths as it passed through the
Caribbean islands earlier in the week. It then battered Mexico as a
Category 2 hurricane, toppling trees but causing no injuries or deaths
before weakening to a tropical storm as it moved across the Yucatan
Peninsula. </p>
<p>Texas officials warned the state’s entire coastline to brace for
possible flooding, heavy rain and wind as they wait for a more defined
path of the storm. The hurricane center has issued hurricane and storm
surge warnings from Baffin Bay south of Corpus Christi to San Luis Pass,
less than 80 miles (130 kilometers) south of Houston. </p>
<p>Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, the acting governor while
Governor Greg Abbott is traveling in Taiwan, issued a preemptive
disaster declaration for 121 counties.  </p>
<p>“Beryl is a determined storm, and incoming winds and potential
flooding will pose a serious threat to Texans who are in Beryl’s path at
landfall and as it makes its way across the state for the following 24
hours,” Patrick said in a statement Saturday.</p>
<p>Some Texas coastal cities called for voluntary evacuations in
low-lying areas prone to flooding, banned beach camping, and urged
tourists traveling on the July 4 holiday weekend to move recreational
vehicles from coastal parks. </p>
<p>Mitch Thames, a spokesperson for Matagorda County, said Saturday that
officials issued a voluntary evacuation request for the coastal areas of
the county about 160 kilometers (about 99 miles) southwest of Houston to
inform the large number of visitors in the area for the holiday
weekend. </p>
<p>“I certainly don’t want to ruin the holiday weekend for our visitors.
But at the same time, our Number 1 goal is the health and safety of all
our visitors and of course our residents,” Thames said. </p>
<p>Residents secure homes with boards, sandbags</p>
<p>In Corpus Christi, officials asked visitors to cut their trips short
and return home early if possible. Officials asked residents to secure
their homes by boarding up windows if necessary and using sandbags to
guard against possible flooding. </p>
<p>“We’re taking the storm very serious and we’re asking the community
to take the storm very serious as well,” Corpus Christi Fire Chief
Brandon Wade said Friday.  </p>
<p>Traffic has been nonstop for the past three days at Ace Hardware in
Corpus Christi as customers buy up tarps, rope, duct tape, sandbags and
generators, employee Elizabeth Landry said Saturday. </p>
<p>“They’re just worried about the wind, the rain,” she said. “They’re
wanting to prepare just in case.” </p>
<p>Ben Koutsoumbaris, general manager of Island Market on Corpus
Christi’s Padre Island, said there’s “definitely a lot of buzz about the
incoming storm,” with customers stocking up on food and drinks —
particularly meat and beer. </p>
<p>“I heard there’s been some talk about people having like hurricane
parties,” he said by telephone Saturday. </p>
<p>County mandates evacuation</p>
<p>In Refugio County, north of Corpus Christi along Texas’ Gulf Coast,
officials issued a mandatory evacuation order for its 6,700 residents
Saturday. </p>
<p>Refugio County Judge Jhiela “Gigi” Poynter, the county’s top elected
official, said that based on the growing confidence of Beryl’s track and
the uncertainty regarding the storm’s intensity and holiday weekend
traffic that is already backing up roads, she made the decision to call
for the mandatory evacuation. </p>
<p>“I would rather be cautious and let Tropical Storm Beryl come
crawling in with a little bit of rain and a little bit of wind to an
empty Refugio County than the alternative if it were to strengthen more
than the predictions, which we know has happened with several storms in
the past,” Poynter said in a video posted on Facebook. </p>
<p>On Saturday, Beryl was about 615 kilometers (about 382 miles)
southeast of Corpus Christi and had top sustained winds of 95 kilometers
(50 miles) per hour, according to the National Hurricane Center. It was
moving west-northwest at 20 kilometers (12.4 miles) per hour.</p>
<p>Before hitting Mexico and moving into the Gulf, Beryl had already
spread destruction in Jamaica, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and
Barbados this week. Three people have been reported dead in Grenada,
three in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, three in Venezuela and two in
Jamaica, officials said.</p>

id="storm-beryl-spares-mexicos-yucatan-beaches-takes-aim-at-texas">Storm
Beryl spares Mexico’s Yucatan beaches, takes aim at Texas</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CANCUN/TULUM, Mexico — Tropical Storm Beryl was blowing out to the
Gulf of Mexico on Friday afternoon and appeared likely to reach Texas by
late Sunday, after its strong winds and heavy rain largely spared
Mexico’s top beach destinations.</p>
<p>The core of the storm, downgraded from a hurricane, crossed the
Yucatan Peninsula by Friday afternoon, with its maximum wind speeds
slowing to around 105 kph after striking near the coastal beach resort
of Tulum in the morning.</p>
<p>The storm, which at one point intensified to a massive Category 5
hurricane, left a deadly trail of destruction across the Caribbean
earlier this week. However, there were no casualties in Mexico, the head
of the country’s civil protection agency, Laura Velazquez, said in a
press conference on Friday afternoon.</p>
<p>While Beryl’s passage over Mexico’s Quintana Roo and Yucatan states
resulted in slower winds, the U.S. National Hurricane Center still
forecast dangerous storm surges in the surrounding area.</p>
<p>For those who hunkered down as Beryl churned overhead, a sense of
relief prevailed.</p>
<p>“Holy cow! It was an experience!” said Mexican tourist Juan Ochoa,
who was staying in Tulum.</p>
<p>“Really only some plants flew up in the air,” he said. “Thank God
we’re all OK.”</p>
<p>Tourist infrastructure was without major damage in Quintana Roo, the
state government said in a statement.</p>
<p>Still, many in the area lost electricity, including 40% of Tulum,
said Guillermo Nevarez, an official with Mexico’s national electricity
company CFE, speaking to local broadcaster Milenio.</p>
<p>Civil protection chief Velazquez said she expected service to be
restored in full by Sunday.</p>
<p>Among Mexico’s top tourist getaways, the Yucatan Peninsula is known
for its white sand beaches, lush landscapes and Mayan ruins.</p>
<p>Stranded tourists camped out in Cancun’s international airport on
Friday, unsure of when they would make it home.</p>
<p>Nora Vento said her flight home to Chile was postponed multiple
times, and that her airline’s counter was unstaffed.</p>
<p>“So, I don’t know when I will get to Chile,” she said.</p>
<p>Beryl, currently located over the port of Progreso in Mexico’s
Yucatan state, was expected to pick up intensity as it enters the Gulf
of Mexico and forecast to regain hurricane status and approach the
western Gulf coast on Sunday.</p>
<p>A hurricane watch was in effect for the Texas coast from the mouth of
the Rio Grande northward to Sargent, according to the U.S. National
Hurricane Center (NHC).</p>
<p>Mexico’s meteorological service issued a hurricane watch for the
northeastern coast of Mexico from Barra el Mezquital to the mouth of the
Rio Grande.</p>
<p>“There is an increasing risk of damaging hurricane-force winds and
life-threatening storm surge in portions of northeastern Mexico and the
lower and middle Texas Coast late Sunday and Monday where hurricane and
storm surge watches have been issued,” the NHC said.</p>
<p>It warned that flash and urban flooding were possible across portions
of the Texas Gulf Coast and eastern Texas from Sunday through the middle
of next week.</p>
<p>Rainfall of 13 to 25 centimeters, with localized amounts of 38
centimeters, is projected across portions of the Texas Gulf Coast and
eastern Texas beginning late on Sunday through the middle of next
week.</p>
<p>Mexico’s national water commission, CONAGUA, flagged a risk of
flooding around the tourist hubs, as well as in neighboring Campeche
state.</p>
<p>Quintana Roo schools were closed, as were local beaches, and
officials lifted a temporary ban on alcohol sales.</p>
<p>Beryl was the first hurricane of the 2024 Atlantic season, and this
week became the earliest Category 5 hurricane on record, with scientists
pointing to its rapid strengthening as almost certainly fueled by
human-caused climate change.</p>
<p>Before reaching Mexico, Beryl wreaked havoc across several Caribbean
islands. It swept through Jamaica, Grenada, St. Vincent and the
Grenadines, in addition to unleashing heavy rainfall on northern
Venezuela. It has claimed at least 11 lives, tearing apart buildings
while felling power lines and trees.</p>
<p>Destruction in the islands of Grenada was especially pronounced.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell pointed to major damage to homes in
Grenada, Carriacou and Petite Martinique during a video briefing
Thursday night. Parts of the latter two islands suffered “almost
complete devastation,” he said.</p>
<p>“Many of our citizens have lost everything.”</p>
<p>Mexico’s major oil platforms, primarily located in the southern rim
of the Gulf of Mexico, are not expected to be affected or shut down.</p>
<p>Beryl is also expected to have little impact on U.S. offshore oil and
gas production, energy companies said on Friday while evacuating
personnel from some facilities out of caution.</p>
<p>Research by the ClimaMeter consortium determined that climate change
significantly intensified Beryl. According to the study, the storm’s
severity, along with its associated rainfall and wind speed, saw an
increase of 10%-30% as a direct result of climate change.</p>

focus on Harris as talk of replacing Biden intensifies</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — For years it’s been a Republican scare tactic.</p>
<p>A vote to reelect President Joe Biden, the GOP often charges, is
really a vote for Vice President Kamala Harris. It’s an attack line
sometimes tinged with racist and misogynist undertones and often macabre
imagery.</p>
<p>But after Biden’s dismal performance at last week’s presidential
debate, which has sparked Democratic calls for him to step aside, what
was once dismissed as a far-right conspiracy — Harris replacing Biden —
could now have a chance of coming to pass. And Republicans, including
Donald Trump, are ramping up their attacks.</p>
<p>Trump and his allies have been rolling out new attack lines against
Harris, insulting her abilities, painting her as Biden’s chief enabler
and accusing her of being part of a coverup of his health. It’s an
effort, campaign officials insist, is not a reflection of their concerns
about a potential change at the top of the ticket, given Biden’s
insistence he is not leaving the race.</p>
<p>But in a post marking Independence Day on his Truth Social site
Thursday, Trump singled out Harris, calling her his “potentially new
Democrat Challenger” and giving her a new derisive nickname: “Laffin’
Kamala Harris.”</p>
<p>“She did poorly in the Democrat Nominating process, starting out at
Number Two, and ending up defeated and dropping out, even before getting
to Iowa, but that doesn’t mean she’s not a”highly talented” politician!
Just ask her Mentor, the Great Willie Brown of San Francisco,” he wrote.
(Harris dated Brown in the mid-1990s.)</p>
<p>The post came after Trump campaign senior advisers Chris LaCivita and
Susie Wiles released a statement earlier this week that offered a
different, but similar, moniker, calling her Biden’s “Cackling Copilot
Kamala Harris.”</p>
<p>Trump also posted an expletive-laced video, which was first been
reported by The Daily Beast, in which he was captured on the golf course
calling Biden an “old broken-down pile of crap” and declaring that he’d
driven the president from the race. (Trump, in interviews, has
repeatedly said he did not expect Biden to be pushed aside.)</p>
<p>“He’s quitting the race,” Trump said. “And that means we have Kamala.
I think she’s going to be better. She’s so bad. She’s so pathetic,” he
said.</p>
<p>Allies have also joined the attacks, painting Harris as a chief
defender of Biden’s faculties and accusing her of lying to the American
public.</p>
<p>Biden, the White House and his campaign insist he has no plans to
drop out of the race. He told reporters Friday he was “completely ruling
that out.”</p>
<p>White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre pushed back against
the tenor of attacks against Harris, particularly Trump’s decision to
invoke a decades-old relationship.</p>
<p>“I think it’s gross, I think it’s disturbing,” Jean-Pierre told
reporters Friday aboard Air Force One. “She should be respected in the
role that she has as vice president. She should be respected like any
other vice president before her who was in that room. It is appalling
that, I’m going to be careful here, that a former president is saying
that about a current vice president. And we should call that out — it is
not OK.”</p>
<p>It remains unclear how Harris would fare against Trump, compared to
Biden. Replacing a candidate this late in a presidential cycle — much
less an incumbent president who has already sailed through the
Democratic Party’s primaries — would be unprecedented in modern history,
and the mechanics are complicated and potentially messy.</p>
<p>Polling shows that Harris’ favorability ratings are similar to
Biden’s and Trump’s. A June AP-NORC poll found about 4 in 10 Americans
have a favorable opinion of her. But the share of those who have an
unfavorable opinion is slightly lower than for Trump and Biden, and
about 1 in 10 have no opinion of her yet.</p>
<p>Harris, at 59, would be a marked generational contrast to Trump, who
is 78 and has also shown signs of aging. As the first woman, the first
Black person and the first person of South Asian descent to serve as
vice president, she would also chart a potentially barrier-breaking
candidacy that could draw the support of women, minority voters and
younger people — groups with whom Trump has been working to make
significant inroads.</p>
<p>Harris has also been the Biden administration’s leading voice on
abortion rights, an animating issue for Democrats since the overturning
of Roe v. Wade that could again motivate turnout this fall.</p>
<p>Trump’s campaign, however, said it was confident in Trump’s chances
regardless of his opponent and dismissed the idea that Harris might pose
a greater challenge to Trump, seeing her as a more polarizing figure
than the president.</p>

id="heat-wave-scorches-much-of-us-record-setting-temperatures-predicted">Heat
wave scorches much of US; record-setting temperatures predicted</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>portland, oregon — A slow-moving and potentially record-setting heat
wave is spreading across the Western United States, the National Weather
Service said, sending many residents in search of a cool haven from the
dangerously high temperatures.</p>
<p>The Southeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S. are also
sweltering, with oppressive heat and humidity expected to last through
Saturday.</p>
<p>Widespread temperature records are expected to be tied or even broken
during the heat wave, with much of the West Coast likely to see
temperatures that are between 15- and 30-degrees Fahrenheit (8 and 16
degrees Celsius) higher than average, the National Weather Service
said.</p>
<p>“The duration of this heat is also concerning, as scorching above
average temperatures are forecast to linger into next week,” the weather
service said.</p>
<p>In the Portland, Oregon, suburb of Gresham, Sherri Thompson, 52, was
waiting in her car with her 14-year-old Chihuahua Kiwani for a cooling
center to open late Friday morning. Thompson has lived in her car for
three years and can only run its air conditioning for about 20 minutes
at a time as it causes the engine to overheat.</p>
<p>Thompson said the high temperatures prompted health concerns, as she
has been hospitalized for heat stroke in the past.</p>
<p>“I have anxiety and panic attacks and I get worried,” she said. “I
don’t want to have another heat stroke, and everything just triggers my
anxiety a lot.” </p>
<p>Pavement, sidewalks magnify heat</p>
<p>Inside the air-conditioned center, Multnomah County spokesperson
Julia Comnes oversaw county staff and people working with a local
homeless services provider as they lined up thin mattresses in rows on
the floor and set up cots for people with disabilities. She said the
space had capacity for up to 80 people.</p>
<p>“We had a pretty cool June, so our bodies aren’t totally acclimated
yet to the heat,” she said. “For people living outside or more
vulnerable people, the cooling space like this is really important for
them to just cool off for a few hours.”</p>
<p>The blistering weather in the Portland region is expected to last at
least through Monday, National Weather Service meteorologist Clinton
Rockey said. If the triple-digit Fahrenheit temperatures (well over 37
degrees Celsius) stretch into Tuesday, then the region will match a
record last seen in July 1941, with five consecutive days of more than
100-degree weather, Rockey said.</p>
<p>The duration is a problem: Many homes in the area lack air
conditioning, and round-the-clock hot weather means people’s bodies
can’t cool down at night. The issue is compounded in many city settings,
where concrete and pavement can store the heat, essentially acting as an
oven.</p>
<p>“That’s what drives people batty,” Rockey said. “It’s going to be
obnoxious. And unfortunately for some people, if you’re not having good
shelter, it could be a very challenging, life-threatening
situation.”</p>
<p>Heat leads to 13 deaths</p>
<p>In Arizona’s Maricopa County, which encompasses the city of Phoenix,
there have been at least 13 confirmed heat-related deaths this year,
while the causes of more than 160 other suspected heat deaths were still
under investigation, according to the county’s most recent report on
such deaths through June 29.</p>
<p>That doesn’t include the death of a 10-year-old boy earlier this week
in Phoenix, who suffered a “heat-related medical event” while hiking
with his family at South Mountain Park and Preserve, according to the
Phoenix Police Department.</p>
<p>Among extremes, the forecast for Furnace Creek in Death Valley
National Park calls for daytime highs of 129 degrees Fahrenheit (53.8
degrees Celsius) Sunday, and then around 130 F (54.44 C) through
Wednesday. The official world record for hottest temperature recorded on
Earth was 134 degrees F (56.67 C) in Death Valley in July 1913, but some
experts dispute that measurement and say the real record was 130 F
recorded there in July 2021.</p>
<p>At Bullhead City, Arizona, the temperature already had reached 111 F
(44.4 C) by 11 a.m. Friday. The city opened a pair of cooling centers
for seniors and others, but locals seemed to be taking it in stride.</p>
<p>“While this is a heat wave and we urge everyone to be cautious, we
typically don’t see large attendance at our cooling centers unless there
are power outages,” Bullhead City spokesperson Mackenzie Covert said
Friday.</p>
<p>Figure skaters took to the ice at the Reno Ice Rink in Nevada
starting at 6 a.m. Friday, general manager Kevin Sunde said. By the time
the rink closes at 10:30 p.m. Friday, Sunde expected nearly 300 people
would have visited, with more parents hanging around to watch kids’
hockey practice than usual.</p>
<p>“They may not be getting on the ice themselves, but enjoying the
cool,” Sunde said. “We’re the only sheet of ice within about an hour’s
drive.”</p>
