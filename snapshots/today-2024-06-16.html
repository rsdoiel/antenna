Hi,<br/> The Oberon subsystem opens in revision.10272 but the
&lt;delete&gt; key doesn't delete, &lt;F1&gt; doesn't set the star and
&lt;F2&gt; doesn't clear marks. HotKeys has preempted the familiar
Oberon key functionalities?
</p>
<p dir="auto">
I found a note that &lt;F12&gt; should disable or toggle HotKeys. In
10272 &lt;F12&gt; gives a report in the log that a SystemTools command
doesn't exist.
</p>
<p dir="auto">
SystemTools was omitted inadvertently?
</p>

Thanks, … Peter E.

<p>date: 2024-06-16, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;The other day I was emailing with &lt;a href=&quot;https://starbreaker.org/&quot;&gt;Matthew “Starbreaker” Graybosch&lt;/a&gt; about his recent post titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://starbreaker.org/blog/tech/robots-txt-nuclear-option/index.html&quot;&gt;“robots.txt: the Nuclear Option”&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re a regular reader of this site you know I love this kind of stuff and I especially love nuclear options when it comes to fighting silly tech.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
I experimented with blocking everything in the past but this recent
exchange made me want to revisit this idea. With perfect timing, Robb
Knight posted
<a href="https://rknight.me/blog/perplexity-ai-is-lying-about-its-user-agent/">“Perplexity
AI Is Lying about Their User Agent”</a> and that was all the extra
motivation I needed to join the fun.
</p>
<p>
I already had a 403 in place for Mastodon because I don’t want to get a
shit ton of traffic coming my way every time someone posts a link of
mine but I loved Matthew’s idea of returning a
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/402">402</a>.
</p>
<p>
So I grabbed 180 or so entries from the
<a href="https://darkvisitors.com/agents">Dark Visitors’s agents
list</a> and set up an NGINX redirect based on those UA. Gonna be
interesting to see if this has any effect on the server so I’ll write a
follow-up.
</p>
<p>
I tried to leave out all the RSS fetchers because I love RSS, RSS is
great and if you’re using RSS in 2024 you’re an awesome person BUT I
might have inadvertently broken some RSS feed out there with this move.
If you notice something not working properly let me know and I’ll fix
it.

<p>date: 2024-06-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>On January 6, 2021, the U.S. Capitol building was attacked by
supporters of then-President Donald Trump challenging his loss of the
2020 election. In their rematch this year, Trump and President Joe Biden
are both campaigning on the issue of the January 6 violence, but each in
his own way. VOA’s Dora Mekouar reports.</p>

code republished 15 years later</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-16, from: OS News</p>
<p>Way, way, way back in 2009, we reported on a small hobby operating
system called StreamOS – version 0.21-RC1 had just been released that
day. StreamOS was a 32-bit operating system written in Object Pascal
using the Free Pascal Compiler, running on top of FreeDOS. It turns out
that its creator, Oleksandr Natalenko (yes, the same person), recovered
the old code, and republished it on Codeberg for posterity. It’s not a
complete history, rather a couple of larger breadcrumbs stuck together
with git. I didn’t do source code management much back in the days, and
there are still some intermediate dev bits scattered across my backup
drive that I cannot even date properly, but three branches I pushed
(along with binaries, btw; feel free to fire up that qemu of yours and
see how it crashes!) should contain major parts of what was done. ↫
Oleksandr Natalenko It may not carry the same import as Doom for the
SNES, but it’s still great to see such continuity 15 years apart. I hope
Natalenko manages to recover the remaining bits and bobs too, because
you may never know – someone might be interested in picking up this 15
year old baton.</p>

<p>
The FTC gets involved in the obviously rife practice of overselling the
capabilities of AI services. These are solid guidelines, and hopefully
the precursor to more meaningful action when vendors inevitably cross
the line.
</p>
<p>
While these points are all important, for me the most pertinent is the
last:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“Don’t violate consumer privacy rights. These avatars and bots can
collect or infer a lot of intensely personal information. Indeed, some
companies are marketing as a feature the ability of such AI services to
know everything about us. It’s imperative that companies are honest and
transparent about the collection and use of this information and that
they don’t surreptitiously change privacy policies or relevant terms of
service.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It’s often unclear how much extra data is being gathered behind the
scenes when AI features are added. This is where battles will be fought
and lines will be drawn, particularly in enterprises and well-regulated
industries.

<h2 id="a-brief-history-of-mac-enclaves-and-exclaves">A brief history of
Mac enclaves and exclaves</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-16, from: OS News</p>
<p>Howard Oakley has written an interesting history of secure enclaves
on the Mac, and when he touches upon “exclaves”, a new concept that
doesn’t have a proper term yet, he mentions something interesting. While
an enclave is a territory entirely surrounded by the territory of
another state, an exclave is an isolated fragment of a state that exists
separately from the main part of that state. Although exclave isn’t a
term normally used in computing, macOS 14.4 introduced three kernel
extensions concerned with exclaves. They seem to have appeared first in
iOS 17, where they’re thought to code domains isolated from the kernel
that protect key functions in macOS even when the kernel becomes
compromised. This in turn suggests that Apple is in the process of
refactoring the kernel into a central micro-kernel with protected
exclaves. This has yet to be examined in Sequoia. ↫ Howard Oakley I’m
not going to add too much here since I’m not well-versed enough in the
world of macOS to add anything meaningful, but I do think it’s an
interesting theory worth looking into by people who posses far more
knowledge about this topic than I do.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
“United Airlines announced that it is bringing personalized advertising
to the seatback entertainment screens on its flights. The move is aimed
at increasing the airline’s revenue by leveraging the data that it has
on its passengers.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Just another reason why friends don’t let friends fly United. We should
all be reducing our air travel overall anyway, given the climate crisis,
and in a world where we all fly less, shouldn’t we choose a better
experience?
</p>
<p>
This sounds like the absolute worst:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“United believes its advertising network will be appealing to brands
because “there is the potential for 3.5 hours of attention per traveler,
based on average flight time.”“
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Passengers from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Virginia, and Utah
can opt out of having their private information used to show targeted
ads to them for the duration of what sounds like an agonizing flight.
Passengers from other US States are out of luck - at least until their
legislatures <em>also</em> pass reasonable privacy legislation.
</p>
<p>
Other airlines are removing seat-back entertainment to reduce fuel, so
on top of the baseline climate impact of the air travel industry,
there’s a real additional climate implication here. Planes with
seat-back entertainment, in general, use more fuel; United is making a
revenue decision with all kinds of negative impacts that they should not
be rewarded for.

<p>
Perplexity AI doesn’t use its advertised browser string or IP range to
load content from third-party websites:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“So they’re using headless browsers to scrape content, ignoring
robots.txt, and not sending their user agent string. I can’t even block
their IP ranges because it appears these headless browsers are not on
their IP ranges.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
On one level, I understand why this is happening, as everyone who’s ever
written a scraper (or scraper mitigations) might: the crawler for
training the model likely <em>does</em> use the correct browser string,
but on-demand calls likely don’t to prevent them from being blocked.
That’s not a good excuse at all, but I bet that’s what’s going on.
</p>
<p>
This is another example of the core issue with robots.txt: it’s a
handshake agreement at best. There are no legal or technical
restrictions imposed by it; we all just hope that bots do the right
thing. Some of them do, but a lot of them don’t.
</p>
<p>
The only real way to restrict these services is through legal rules that
create meaningful consequences for these companies. Until then, there
will be no sure-fire way to prevent your content from being accessed by
an AI agent.

Roberts help Biden raise $28 million at fundraiser featuring dire
warnings about Trump</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — Some of Hollywood’s brightest stars headlined a glitzy
fundraiser for President Joe Biden on Saturday night, helping raise what
his reelection campaign said was $28 million and hoping to energize
would-be supporters for a November election that they argued was among
the most important in the nation’s history.</p>
<p>George Clooney, Julia Roberts and Barbra Streisand were among those
who took the stage at the 7,100-seat Peacock Theater in Los Angeles.
Late-night host Jimmy Kimmel interviewed Biden and former President
Barack Obama, who both stressed the need to defeat former President
Donald Trump in a race that’s expected to be exceedingly close.</p>
<p>During more than half an hour of discussion, Kimmel asked if the
country was suffering from amnesia about the presumptive Republican
nominee, to which Biden responded, “all we gotta do is remember what it
was like” when Trump was in the White House.</p>
<p>Luminaries from the entertainment world have increasingly lined up to
help Biden’s campaign, and just how important the event was to his
reelection bid could be seen in the Democratic president’s decision to
fly through the night across nine time zones, from the G7 summit in
southern Italy to Southern California, to attend.</p>
<p>He also missed a summit in Switzerland about ways to end Russia’s war
in Ukraine, instead dispatching Vice President Kamala Harris who made a
whirlwind trip of her own to represent the United States there, a stark
reminder of the delicate balance between geopolitics and Biden’s bid to
win a second term.</p>
<p>Further laying bare the political implications were police in riot
gear outside the theater, ready for protests from pro-Palestinian
activists angry about his administration’s handling of Israel’s war
against Hamas in Gaza.</p>
<p>The event featured singing by Jack Black and Sheryl Lee Ralph, and
actors Kathryn Hahn and Jason Bateman introduced Kimmel, who introduced
Biden and Obama. The comedian deadpanned, “I was told I was getting
introduced by Batman, not Bateman.”</p>
<p>But he quickly pivoted to far more serious topics, saying that “so
much is at stake in this election” and listing women’s rights, health
care and noting that “even the ballot is on the ballot” in a reference
to the Biden administration’s calls to expand voting rights.</p>
<p>Kimmel asked the president what he was most proud of accomplishing,
and Biden said he thought the administration’s approach to the economy
“is working.”</p>
<p>“We have the strongest economy in the world today,” Biden said,
adding “we try to give ordinary people an even chance.”</p>
<p>Trump spent Saturday campaigning in Detroit and criticized Biden’s
handling of the economy and inflation. The president was fundraising
“with out-of-touch elitist Hollywood celebrities,” Trump campaign
spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said.</p>
<p>But Biden told the crowd in California that “we passed every major
piece of legislation we attempted to get done.” And Obama expressed
admiration for sweeping legislation on health care, public works, the
environment, technology manufacturing, gun safety and other major
initiatives that the administration of his former vice president has
overseen.</p>
<p>“What we’re seeing now is a byproduct of in 2016. There were a whole
bunch of folks who, for whatever reason, sat out,” said Obama, who, like
Biden wore a dark suit and a white shirt open at the collar. </p>
<p>Obama, speaking about the Supreme Court, added that “hopefully we
have learned our lesson, because these elections matter in very concrete
ways.”</p>
<p>Trump nominated three justices who helped overturn Roe v. Wade, the
landmark decision guaranteeing a constitutional right to an abortion.
The audience expressed its displeasure at the mention of Roe, to which
Obama responded, “don’t hiss, vote.” That was a play on his common
refrain prioritizing voting over booing.</p>
<p>Biden said the person elected president in November could get the
chance to nominate two new justices, though a second Biden term probably
wouldn’t drastically overhaul a court that currently features a 6-3
conservative majority.</p>
<p>He also suggested if Trump wins back the White House, “one of the
scariest parts” was the Supreme Court and how the high court has “never
been this far out of step.”</p>
<p>Biden also referenced reports that an upside-down flag, a symbol
associated with Trump’s false claims of election fraud, was flown
outside the home of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito in January 2021.
He worried Saturday that, if Trump is reelected, “He’s going to appoint
two more who fly their flags upside down.”</p>
<p>Kimmel brought his special brand of humor to the event. At one point
he asked how can a president get back at a talk-show host who makes fun
of him on TV every night.</p>
<p>“Ever hear of Delta Force?” Biden responded, referring to the Army
special operations unit.</p>
<p>Earlier in the program, Kimmel noted Biden’s campaign promise to
restore the soul of America and said “lately it seems we might need an
exorcism.” Then he asked Biden, “Is that why you visited the pope?”
Biden and Pope Francis met in Italy on Friday.</p>
<p>Biden’s campaign said it was still counting, but Saturday night’s
gathering had taken in at least $28 million, more money than any event
for a Democratic candidate in history.</p>
<p>That meant outpacing the president’s fundraiser in March at Radio
City Music Hall in New York, which raised $26 million and featured
late-night host Stephen Colbert interviewing Biden, Obama and former
President Bill Clinton.</p>
<p>Biden held an early lead in the campaign money race against Trump,
but the former president has gained ground since he formally locked up
the Republican nomination.</p>
<p>Trump outpaced Biden’s New York event by raking in $50.5 million at
an April gathering of major donors at the Florida home of billionaire
investor John Paulson. The former president’s campaign and the
Republican National Committee announced they raised a whopping $141
million in May, padded by tens of millions of dollars in contributions
that flowed in after Trump’s guilty verdict in his criminal hush money
trial.</p>
<p>That post-conviction bump came after Trump and the Republican Party
announced collecting $76 million in April, far exceeding Biden and the
Democrats’ $51 million for the month.</p>

industry could serve as example as dairy farmers confront bird flu</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>des moines, iowa — As the U.S. dairy industry confronts a bird flu
outbreak, with cases reported at dozens of farms and the disease
spreading to people, the egg industry could serve as an example of how
to slow the disease but also shows how difficult it can be to eradicate
the virus.</p>
<p>There have been earlier bird flu outbreaks in the U.S., but the
current one started in February 2022 and has forced the slaughter of
nearly 100 million chickens and turkeys. Hot spots still occur, but
their frequency has dropped in part because of biosecurity efforts at
farms and a coordinated approach between companies and agricultural
officials, experts say.</p>
<p>Dairy farmers could try to implement similar safeguards, but the vast
differences between the animals and the industries limit what lessons
can be learned and applied.</p>
<p>How can a 1,500-pound cow and a 5-pound chicken have the same
illness?It’s commonly called bird flu because the disease is largely
spread by wild birds that can survive infections. Many mammals have
caught the illness, too, including sea lions and skunks.</p>
<p>Effects differ greatly</p>
<p>Animals can be infected by eating an infected bird or by being
exposed to environments where the virus is present. That said, there are
big differences in how cows and chickens have fared after getting
infected.</p>
<p>Bird flu is typically fatal to chickens and turkeys within days of an
infection, leading to immediate mass killings of birds. That’s not true
for cows.</p>
<p>Dairies in several states have reported having to kill infected
animals because symptoms continued to linger and their milk production
didn’t recover, but that’s not the norm, said Russ Daly, an extension
veterinarian at South Dakota State University.</p>
<p>He said it appears that bird flu isn’t usually fatal to cows but that
an infected animal can be more vulnerable to other ailments typically
founds in dairies, such as bacterial pneumonia and udder infections.</p>
<p>What has the egg industry done to protect chickens? Egg operators
have become clean freaks.</p>
<p>To prevent disease from spreading, egg producers require workers to
shower and change into clean clothes before they enter a barn and shower
again when they leave. They also frequently wash trucks and spray tires
with solutions to kill off virus remnants.</p>
<p>Many egg operations even use lasers and install special fencing to
discourage wild birds from stopping by for a visit.</p>
<p>“Gone is the day of the scarecrow,” said Emily Metz, president of the
American Egg Board.</p>
<p>Without these efforts, the current outbreak would be much worse, said
Jada Thompson, a University of Arkansas agriculture business professor.
Still, maintaining such vigilance is difficult, even if the cost of
allowing disease into an operation is so high, she said.</p>
<p>Chickens raised for meat, known as broilers, also have been infected
with bird flu but such cases are less common. In part, that’s because
broiler chickens are killed when they’re only 6 to 8 weeks old, so they
have less time to get infected.</p>
<p>Some safeguards apply</p>
<p>Can the same be done to protect cows and dairy workers? Yes and
no.</p>
<p>Dairies can certainly reduce the spread of disease by limiting access
to barns, so people and equipment don’t bring in the virus from
elsewhere. Workers could also wear eye protection, aprons and gloves to
try to protect themselves, but there’s no way around it: Big animals are
messy.</p>
<p>“The parlor is a warm, humid place with lots of liquid flying around,
whether it’s urine, feces, water, because they’re spraying off areas.
Cows might kick off a milk machine, so you get milk splatter,” said
Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Laboratory.</p>
<p>Dairies also don’t have time or staff to disinfect milking equipment
between animals, so equipment could become contaminated. Pasteurization
kills bacteria and viruses in milk, making it safe for people to
drink.</p>
<p>Poulsen said the dairy industry could follow a path laid by the
poultry and pork industries and establish more formal, better funded
research organizations so it could respond more quickly to problems like
bird flu — or avoid them altogether.</p>
<p>The dairy industry also could tamp down disease spread by limiting
the movement of lactating cows between states, Poulsen said.</p>
<p>Are there new efforts to fight the virus? The U.S. Department of
Agriculture will soon begin testing a vaccine that could be given to
calves, offering the animals protection and also reducing the chance of
worker illnesses.</p>
<p>The egg industry also is hopeful researchers can develop vaccines for
poultry that could be quick, inexpensive and effective. Workers can’t
give shots to the millions of hens that might need a vaccine, but
industry officials hope a vaccine could be distributed in the water the
birds drink, in the pellets they eat or even before birds hatch from
their eggs.</p>
<p>Efforts to develop vaccines have become even more important now that
the disease has spread to dairy cows and even a few people, Thompson
said.</p>
<p>“Part of what is being developed right now is: What way can we
vaccinate them that is cost-effective and disease-resistant?” Thompson
said.</p>

<h2 id="on-fathers-day-lgbtq-couple-celebrates-their-sperm-donor">On
Father’s Day, LGBTQ+ couple celebrates their sperm donor</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PRAIRIE VILLAGE, Kansas — David Titterington had a sense of what his
childhood friend would ask him when she led him into a photo booth at a
mutual friend’s wedding roughly a decade ago. As the countdown for the
second photo ticked, Jen Wilson popped the question: Will you be my
sperm donor?</p>
<p>“Of course I said yes,” Titterington said. “I mean, who would have
guessed that, being a gay man, I would have this opportunity to have
biological children and also be part of their lives?”</p>
<p>On Father’s Day, which is Sunday, Kansas residents Jen and Whitney
Wilson will pack up their three children — ages 9, 7 and 3 — and head to
picnic at Titterington’s Missouri house to celebrate the man who helped
make their family possible. Like other LGBTQ+ couples, they and their
sperm donor have created their own traditions around Father’s Day.</p>
<p>“We just have decided to celebrate him,” said Jen Wilson, who works
as the executive director of the LGBTQ+ advocacy group Modern Family
Alliance.</p>
<p>For LGBTQ+ people, single-parent households, other nontraditional
families or those with strained family relationships, Father’s Day and
Mother’s Day can be painful and confusing. Events featuring those
holidays at school can make some children feel isolated. Jen Wilson said
many schools are working toward being more inclusive, such as turning
events like “Donuts with Dads” to “Donuts with Grown-Ups.”</p>
<p>“There are families who don’t have a David, who can’t really point
to, like, this is what it means to be a dad or have a father figure. So
I consider us really lucky,” Whitney Wilson said. She later added: “I
think we’re really lucky in that we have lots of people in our life to
point to. Not just David … grandpas and uncles and all kinds of people
who are also fathers.”</p>
<p>Between 2 million and 3.3 million children under age 18 have an
LGBTQ+ parent, according to the group Family Equality.</p>
<p>Such families are growing more visible in recent years, said Cathy
Renna, the communications director of the National LGBTQ Task Force.
Most Pride events now include family-friendly activities, like climbing
walls, she said.</p>
<p>“Now we see families of all kinds and shapes and sizes, and that’s
really important. It’s important not just for us,” Renna said. “It’s
also important for kids to understand, you know, that families do come
in many different, configurations and that families are about love.”</p>
<p>When it comes to Father’s Day, Jen Wilson said: “People focus so much
on just their own father instead of highlighting the fact that there are
a lot of really great fathers in the world in lots of different
communities and just celebrating them for stepping up and … being the
great dads that they are.”</p>
<p>Jen Wilson and Titterington have been friends since childhood. When
Jen Wilson and her wife began planning for a family, Titterington tossed
out the idea of being a sperm donor, and he was overjoyed when the
couple later made the ask official.</p>
<p>Titterington sees his role in the kids’ lives as more akin to a
godfather than a father. He and his husband go to school events and
birthday parties, and Titterington said they see themselves as “coaching
them from the sidelines.” He said he is partial to the title “blood
father,” but the Wilsons said the children more often refer to him as
their “bio dad” or “donor dad.”</p>
<p>“I am their father, but I’m not really their parent,” Titterington
said. “Because Jennifer and Whitney are the two parents, and they’re
doing an amazing job.”</p>
<p>Even with David, the idea that the children don’t have a dad can be
hard for them, Whitney Wilson said, but it isn’t “something that keeps
anybody in our house up at night.”</p>
<p>“There are a lot of people that would love the opportunity to tell
our children how terrible it is that they don’t have a father figure in
their life,” Jen Wilson said. “We know that’s not true.”</p>
<p>For Titterington, fatherhood is the weight of the Wilsons’ firstborn
falling asleep on his chest, gifts of scribbled artwork that can never
be thrown away, and cleaning up after a toddler in potty training. But
after a tiring weekend slumber party, he can send the children home to
their mothers.</p>
<p>“There’s so many ways to be a father,” Titterington said. “We get to
celebrate all kinds of fathers on Father’s Day.”</p>

id="midwives-state-law-could-jeopardize-native-hawaiian-birth-traditions">Midwives:
State law could jeopardize Native Hawaiian birth traditions</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>HONOLULU — Ki’inaniokalani Kahoʻohanohano longed for a deeper
connection to her Native Hawaiian ancestors and culture as she prepared
to give birth to her first child at home on the north shore of Maui in
2003.</p>
<p>But generations of colonialist suppression had eroded many Hawaiian
traditions, and it was hard to find information on how the islands’
Indigenous people honored pregnancy or childbirth. Nor could she find a
Native Hawaiian midwife.</p>
<p>That experience led Kahoʻohanohano — now a mother of five — to become
a Native Hawaiian midwife herself, a role in which she spent years
helping to deliver as many as three babies a month, receiving them in a
traditional cloth made of woven bark and uttering sacred, tremorous
chants as she welcomed them into the world.</p>
<p>Her quest to preserve tradition also led her into a downtown Honolulu
courtroom this week, where she and others are seeking to block a state
law that they say endangers their ability to continue serving pregnant
women who hope for such customary Native Hawaiian births.</p>
<p>“To be able to have our babies in the places and in the ways of our
kupuna, our ancestors, is very vital,” she testified. “To me, the point
of what we do is to be able to return birth home to these places.”</p>
<p>Lawmakers enacted a midwife licensure law in 2019, finding that the
“improper practice of midwifery poses a significant risk of harm to the
mother or newborn, and may result in death.” Violations are punishable
by up to a year in jail, plus thousands of dollars in criminal and civil
fines.</p>
<p>The measure requires anyone who provides “assessment, monitoring, and
care” during pregnancy, labor, childbirth and during the postpartum
period to be licensed. The women’s lawsuit says that would include a
wide range of people, including midwives, doulas, lactation consultants,
and even family and friends of the new mother.</p>
<p>Until last summer, the law provided an exception for “birth
attendants,” which allowed Kahoʻohanohano to continue practicing Native
Hawaiian birth customs. With that exception now expired, however, she
and others face the licensing requirements — which, they say, include
costly programs only available out of state or online that don’t align
with Hawaiian culture and beliefs.</p>
<p>In 2022, the average cost of an accredited midwifery program was
$6,200 to $6,900 a year, according to court documents filed by the
state.</p>
<p>Attorneys for the state argued in a court filing that the law
“undoubtedly serves a compelling interest in protecting pregnant persons
from receiving ill-advice from untrained individuals.”</p>
<p>State Deputy Attorney General Isaac Ickes told Judge Shirley Kawamura
that the law doesn’t outlaw Native Hawaiian midwifery or homebirths, but
that requiring a license reduces the risks of harm or death.</p>
<p>The dispute is the latest in a long history of debate about how and
whether Hawaii should regulate the practice of traditional healing arts
that dates to well before the islands became the 50th state in 1959.
Those arts were banished or severely restricted for much of the 20th
century, but the Hawaiian Indigenous rights movement of the 1970s
renewed interest in the customary ways.</p>
<p>Hawaii eventually adopted a system where councils versed in Native
Hawaiian healing certify traditional practitioners, though those suing
say their efforts to form such a council for midwifery have failed.</p>
<p>Practicing midwifery without a license, meanwhile, was banned until
1998 — when, lawmakers say, they inadvertently decriminalized it when
they altered the regulation of nurse-midwives, something the 2019 law
sought to remedy.</p>
<p>Among the nine plaintiffs are women who seek traditional births and
argue that the new licensing requirement violates their right of privacy
and reproductive autonomy under Hawaii’s Constitution. They are
represented by the Center for Reproductive Rights and the Native
Hawaiian Legal Corporation.</p>
<p>“For pregnant people whose own family may no longer hold the
knowledge of the ceremonial and sacred aspects of birth, a midwife
trained in Native Hawaiian traditional and customary birthing practices
can be an invaluable, culturally informed health care provider,” the
lawsuit states.</p>
<p>When Kahoʻohanohano was unable to find a Native Hawaiian midwife to
attend the birth of her first child, she turned instead to a Native
American one, who was open to incorporating traditional Hawaiian aspects
that Kahoʻohanohano gleaned from her elders.</p>
<p>She surrounded herself with Hawaiian cultural practitioners focusing
on pule, or prayer, and lomilomi, a traditional massage with physical
and spiritual elements. It all helped ease her three days of labor, she
said. And then, “two pushes and pau” — done — the boy was born.</p>
<p>The births of her five children in various Maui communities,
Kahoʻohanohano said, were her “greatest teachers” in herself becoming
one of the very few midwives who know about Native Hawaiian birthing
practices.</p>
<p>She is believed to be the first person in a century to give birth on
her husband’s ancestral lands in Kahakuloa, a remote west Maui valley of
mostly Native Hawaiians, where her daughter was born in 2015. The
community is at least 40 minutes along winding roads to the island’s
only hospital.</p>
<p>Kahoʻohanohano testified about helping low-risk pregnant women and
identifying instances where she transferred someone to receive care at
the hospital but said she’s never experienced any emergency
situations.</p>
<p>Among the other plaintiffs are midwives she has helped train and
women she has aided through birth. Makalani Franco-Francis testified
that she learned about customary birth practices from Kahoʻohanohano,
including how to receive a newborn in kapa, or traditional cloth, and
cultural protocols for a placenta, including taking it to the ocean or
burying it to connect a newborn to its ancestral lands.</p>
<p>The law has halted her education, Franco-Francis said. She testified
that she’s not interested in resuming her midwifery education through
out-of-state or online programs.</p>
<p>“It’s not in alignment with our cultural practices, and it’s also a
financial obligation,” she said.</p>
<p>The judge heard testimony through the week. It’s not clear how soon a
ruling might come.</p>

<p>A judge has overturned the conviction of a Missouri woman who was a
psychiatric patient when she incriminated herself in a 1980 killing.
Sandra Hemme has spent 43 years behind bars. Her attorneys argue the
killing actually was committed by a now-discredited police officer.
Judge Ryan Horsman ruled late Friday that Hemme had established evidence
of actual innocence. Her attorneys says this is the longest time a women
has been been incarcerated for a wrongful conviction. The judge said
Hemme must be freed within 30 days unless prosecutors retry her.
Prosecutors didn’t immediately respond to a phone message from The
Associated Press seeking comment.</p>

id="trump-michigan-trip-includes-black-church-far-right-activists-meeting">Trump
Michigan trip includes Black church, far-right activists’ meeting</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>DETROIT, MICHIGAN — Donald Trump will use back-to-back stops Saturday
to court Black voters and a conservative group that has been accused of
attracting white supremacists as the Republican presidential candidate
works to stitch together a coalition of historically divergent interests
in the battleground state of Michigan.</p>
<p>Trump is scheduled to host an afternoon roundtable at an African
American church in downtown Detroit. Later he will appear at the
“People’s Convention” of Turning Point Action, a group that the
Anti-Defamation League says has been linked to a variety of
extremists.</p>
<p>Roughly 24 hours before Trump planned to address the conference,
well-known white supremacist Nick Fuentes entered Turning Point’s
convention hall surrounded by a group of cheering supporters. He was
quickly escorted out by security.</p>
<p>Fuentes created political problems for Trump after Fuentes attended a
private lunch with the former president and the rapper formerly known as
Kanye West at Trump’s Florida estate in 2022.</p>
<p>Trump’s weekend plans underscore the evolving political forces
shaping the presidential election this fall as he tries to deny
Democratic President Joe Biden a second term.</p>
<p>Few states are expected to matter more in November than Michigan,
which Biden carried by less than 3 percentage points four years ago. And
few voting groups matter more to Democrats than African Americans, who
made up the backbone of Biden’s political base in 2020. But now, less
than five months before Election Day, Black voters are expressing modest
signs of disappointment with the Democrat.</p>
<p>Michael Whatley, the new chairman of the Republican National
Committee, told Michigan Republicans at a dinner Friday that the state
could not be more important.</p>
<p>“Everybody knows if we don’t win Michigan, we’re not going to have a
Republican in the White House,” Whatley said. “Let me be more blunt: If
we don’t win Michigan, we’re not going to have Donald Trump in the White
House.</p>
<p>“We are going to determine the fate of the world in this election in
November,” he said.</p>
<p>Trump argues that he can pull in more Black voters due to his
economic and border security message, and that his felony indictments
make him more relatable.</p>
<p>Democrats are offering a competing perspective.</p>
<p>“Donald Trump is so dangerous for Michigan and dangerous for America
and dangerous for Black people,” Michigan Lieutenant Governor Garlin
Gilchrist II, who is African American, said Friday.</p>
<p>He said it was “offensive” for Trump to address the Turning Point
conference, which was taking place at the same convention center that
was “the epicenter of their steal the election effort.”</p>
<p>Indeed, dozens of angry Trump loyalists chanting “Stop the count!”
descended on the TCF Center, now named Huntington Place, the day after
the 2020 presidential election as absentee ballots were being counted.
Local media captured scenes of protesters outside and in the lobby.
Police prevented them from entering the counting area.</p>
<p>The protests took place after Trump had tweeted that “they are
finding Biden votes all over” in several states, including Michigan.</p>
<p>The false notion that Biden benefited from widespread voter fraud has
been widely debunked by voting officials in both parties, the court
system and members of Trump’s former administration. Still, Trump
continues to promote such misinformation, which echoed throughout the
conservative convention over the weekend.</p>
<p>Speaking from the main stage, Turning Point founder and CEO Charlie
Kirk falsely described the conference location as “the scene of a
crime.”</p>
<p>Such extreme rhetoric does not appear to have hurt Trump’s standing
with Black voters, however.</p>
<p>Among Black adults, Biden’s approval has dropped from 94% when he
started his term in January 2021 to just 55%, according to an Associated
Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll published in
March.</p>
<p>About 8 in 10 Black voters have an unfavorable opinion of Trump, with
roughly two-thirds saying they have a “very unfavorable” view of him,
according to an AP-NORC poll conducted in June. About 2 in 10 Black
voters have a very or somewhat favorable view of Trump.</p>
<p>Trump won 8% of the Black vote in 2020, according to AP VoteCast. And
in what is expected to be a close election, even a modest shift could be
consequential.</p>
<p>Maurice Morrison, a 67-year-old lifelong Detroit resident, plans to
attend Trump’s church appearance. Morrison acknowledged that Trump, for
whom he voted twice before and plans to again, is deeply unpopular in
his community and even inside his home.</p>
<p>“Once he decided to run for president as a Republican, that
automatically made him racist. That’s his middle name now — ‘Trump is
racist’ — everybody I talk to, all the people I know, my family,” said
Morrison, who is Black.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, thousands of conservative activists, most of them young
and white, were eagerly awaiting Trump’s keynote address Saturday
night.</p>

<h2 id="us-diplomat-warns-chinas-provoking-of-taiwan-risks-conflict">US
diplomat warns China’s provoking of Taiwan risks conflict</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Taipei, Taiwan — Outgoing director of the American Institute in
Taiwan, Sandra Oudkirk, has warned China against aggressive moves in the
region that could spark a larger conflict.</p>
<p>Oudkirk made the comment in response to a question at a June 14
farewell news conference.</p>
<p>“The United States is profoundly devoted to a status quo in the
straits and in the region … that is one of peace and stability. And that
is why we have consistently urged the PRC [People’s Republic of China]
to avoid coercive or provocative actions both in the Taiwan Straits and
in other areas like the South China Sea and off Japan, because
provocative actions are almost by definition dangerous,” she said. “They
run the risk of a miscalculation or an accident that could spark a
broader conflict.”</p>
<p>During Oudkirk’s three-year term, China conducted three
island-circling military exercises against Taiwan, causing an
unprecedented level of tension in the history of the American Institute
in Taiwan, or AIT, which serves as Washington’s de facto embassy.</p>
<p>China considers self-governing Taiwan a breakaway province that must
one day be reunited with the mainland, by force if necessary.</p>
<p>The U.S., like many countries, does not recognize Taiwan as a country
in order to have relations with China. But Washington maintains informal
diplomatic relations with Taipei through the AIT, along with direct
trade and defense ties, and supports Taiwan as a self-governing
democracy.</p>
<p>Oudkirk reiterated U.S. support for Taiwan’s defense capabilities
against Chinese aggression, saying that bolstering Taiwan’s ability to
defend itself was AIT’s “top priority.”</p>
<p>“We look forward to the delivery of the military capabilities” from
the long-awaited U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, she said. Worth nearly $20
billion, they were purchased over the past several years but have seen
delays in delivery.</p>
<p>Oudkirk blamed the COVID-19 pandemic for affecting supply chains but
said the delays were gradually unwinding and to “watch this space.”</p>
<p>The U.S. in early June approved an $80 million sale of F-16 fighter
jet spare and repair parts to Taiwan.</p>
<p>China’s defense ministry declared Beijing’s strong opposition to the
arms sales on June 7 and urged Washington to withdraw them
immediately.</p>
<p>Amid concerns about a potential defense vacuum in Taiwan, some
analysts have suggested the U.S. move some arms and ammunition
production to Taiwan.</p>
<p>In response, Taiwan’s Defense Minister Wellington Koo said on June 11
that the two countries are moving toward “possible joint production,”
reported Taiwanese media.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Oudkirk noted that Taiwan is looking at becoming a
component supplier for the U.S. defense industry.</p>
<p>“We have had a variety of delegations come through Taiwan looking at
cybersecurity, looking at unmanned systems, drones. I can tell there is
a lot of interest there but there are still some steps in terms of
meeting the standards that the U.S. puts down for its defense industrial
base that Taiwan’s private companies would have to meet.”</p>
<p>Tzu-yun Su, an associate research fellow at the Institute for
National Defense and Security Research in Taipei, told VOA the technical
issues for Taiwan and U.S. defense companies to expand cooperation are
not big, but a major hurdle is corporate governance.</p>
<p>“The confidentiality of the companies, personnel safety control and
information network security will be the three major factors,” said Su.
“At the same time, the government laws must be connected. If Taiwanese
companies can keep up with these regulations and management aspects,
they will have a relatively good chance of entering the U.S. defense
supply chain.”</p>
<p>Asked about concerns that U.S. policy to Taiwan could change if
President Joe Biden is not reelected in November, Oudkirk said, “In the
United States, unlike on almost any other issue of foreign policy or
domestic policy, there is a broad-based, bipartisan consensus on policy
towards Taiwan. So, I do not think an election would necessarily change
that.”</p>
<p>The American Institute in Taiwan announced in late May that Raymond
Greene will succeed Oudkirk as head of the office in Taipei sometime
this summer.</p>

id="from-g7-to-fundraiser-biden-balances-geopolitics-with-campaign">From
G7 to fundraiser: Biden balances geopolitics with campaign</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — After flying through the night across nine time zones,
from southern Italy to Southern California, U.S. President Joe Biden is
shifting his focus from Russia’s challenge of Western unity to raking in
big money for his reelection campaign at a Hollywood fundraiser
featuring George Clooney and Julia Roberts.</p>
<p>Biden went straight from the Group of Seven summit of wealthy
democracies, where Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of
Ukraine took center stage, to Los Angeles and the glitzy gathering
unfolding Saturday night at the Peacock Theater. The journey was only
broken up by a layover to refuel outside Washington.</p>
<p>Former President Barack Obama is joining headliners Clooney and
Roberts, and late-night host Jimmy Kimmel will interview all of them
onstage. In a text message to donors beforehand, Roberts called it “a
crucial time in the election.” Kimmel wrote in his own text that
presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump “will hate this, so let’s do
it.”</p>
<p>Luminaries from the entertainment world have increasingly lined up to
help Biden’s campaign, hoping to provide a fundraising jolt and to
energize would-be supporters to turn out ahead of Election Day against
Trump.</p>
<p>But appearing with stars this time means Biden is skipping a summit
in Switzerland about ways to end Russia’s war in Ukraine. Vice President
Kamala Harris is representing the United States.</p>
<p>It’s a stark reminder that his responsibilities as president and his
reelection effort can sometimes conflict.</p>
<p>“We are going to see an unprecedented and record-setting turnout from
the media and entertainment world,” Jeffrey Katzenberg, the Hollywood
mogul, major Democratic donor and co-chair of Biden’s campaign, said in
a statement.</p>
<p>A Biden fundraiser in March at Radio City Music Hall in New York
featured late-night host Stephen Colbert interviewing the president,
Obama and former President Bill Clinton. It raised a then-record $26
million, but the California event will bring in at least $28 million,
according to the Biden campaign.</p>
<p>Still, Trump has hauled in even bigger numbers.</p>
<p>He outpaced Biden’s New York event in April, raking in $50.5 million
at a gathering of major donors at the Florida home of billionaire
investor John Paulson. The former president’s campaign and the
Republican National Committee announced they had raised a whopping $141
million in May, padded by tens of millions of dollars in contributions
that flowed in after Trump’s guilty verdict in his criminal hush money
trial.</p>
<p>That post-conviction bump came after Trump and the Republican Party
announced collecting $76 million in April, far exceeding Biden and the
Democrats’ $51 million for the month and narrowing a fundraising
advantage Biden built earlier in the race.</p>

gains, Native Americans still face voting barriers</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Native Americans today say they still face barriers to
casting their votes, six decades after U.S. President Lyndon Johnson
signed the Voting Rights Act.</p>
<p>Many live miles away from voter registration and polling sites and
lack access to reliable transportation.</p>
<p>Others may not have traditional mailing addresses and cannot satisfy
voter registration requirements. Voting by mail can be “iffy,” according
to O.J. Semans, a Sicangu Lakota citizen living on the Rosebud
Reservation in South Dakota and co-executive director of Four
Directions, a voting rights advocacy group that has worked on behalf of
tribes in several states.</p>
<p>“You must remember, the old Pony Express [mail delivery on horseback]
wasn’t meant for reservations. It was for outposts and settler towns,”
Semans said. “The U.S. Postal Service has neglected every Indian
reservation in the United States when it comes to ensuring we have
equality.”</p>
<p>A 2023 study of mail service on the Navajo Nation — the largest
reservation in the U.S. — notes that when deciding where to open post
offices during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the U.S. Postal
Service picked locations that would “advance military objectives and
serve the interests of Anglo-American settlers.”</p>
<p>“Post Offices are fewer and farther from each other on reservation
communities; there are fewer service hours; and we show in a mail
experiment that letters posted on reservations are slower and less
likely to arrive,” the study said.</p>
<p>Post offices exist on Seman’s Rosebud Reservation, but they no longer
accept general delivery.</p>
<p>“So, if you want to vote by mail, you can request an absentee ballot
and fill it out. But you’d never get the ballot back,” he said.</p>
<p>States pass restrictive laws</p>
<p>The 1965 Voting Rights Act banned traditional forms of voter
discrimination such as literacy tests, character assessments and other
practices widely used to disenfranchise minority voters.</p>
<p>It authorized the federal government to oversee voter registration
and election procedures in certain states and localities with histories
of discriminatory practices, and it also required those jurisdictions to
obtain “preclearance” from the Justice Department or a federal court
before changing voting laws or procedures.</p>
<p>In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the formula for deciding
which localities needed preclearance as unconstitutional, opening the
way for states to pass new voting laws.</p>
<p>During a Senate Indian Affairs Committee hearing in 2021, Jacqueline
De Leon, an enrolled member of the Isleta Pueblo and a staff attorney at
the Native American Rights Fund, or NARF, described some conditions for
Indigenous voters.</p>
<p>“In South Dakota, Native American voters were forced to vote in a
repurposed chicken coop with no bathroom facilities and feathers on the
floor,” she testified.</p>
<p>In Wisconsin, Native Americans were required to cast their ballots
inside a sheriff’s office.</p>
<p>NARF, tribes fight back</p>
<p>In 2021, President Joe Biden created the Interagency Steering Group
on Native American Voting Rights to report on barriers facing Native
voters.</p>
<p>“Native American communities have not been immune, but indeed have
been packed or divided by district lines that dilute their vote or
otherwise discriminate,” the group reported.</p>
<p>In November 2021, North Dakota’s Republican-led legislature approved
a new legislative map that separated state House districts on the Turtle
Mountain Indian Reservation and the Fort Berthold reservation, home to
the Three Affiliated Tribes.</p>
<p>The Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa and Spirit Lake tribes filed a
federal lawsuit arguing that the new map violated the Voting Rights Act
by packing the Turtle Mountain band — that is, concentrating them into a
single electoral district to reduce their influence in other districts,
and cracking — or dividing — the Spirit Lake tribe across districts to
dilute their voting power.</p>
<p>“A conservative judge found this was a clear violation of the Voting
Rights Act,” De Leon told VOA. “And rather than protect its Native
constituents where there was a violation, the state has appealed, trying
to just block the cost of action as opposed to remediating the
discrimination.”</p>
<p>Arizona passed a law in 2022 requiring voters to provide proof of
their physical address.</p>
<p>“And that was really an attack on the Native vote because about
40,000 homes in Indian Country in Arizona don’t have traditional
addresses on them or any way to prove residential location,” De Leon
said.</p>
<p>With NARF’s support, the Tohono O’odham Nation and the Gila River
Indian Community in 2022 filed suit in U.S. District Court for Arizona.
In 2023, the court ruled in their favor, finding that the address
requirements violated tribe members’ constitutional right to vote.</p>
<p>With five months to go before November’s general election, Semans
said, Indigenous voting rights activists must stay vigilant.</p>
<p>“With this new Supreme Court, even rulings that we got years ago that
were positive for Indian country could change before then,” he said.
“Things can change on a dime.”</p>

<h2 id="worst-of-rainfall-that-triggered-florida-floods-is-over">Worst
of rainfall that triggered Florida floods is over</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>FORT LAUDERDALE, Florida — Although more rain could trigger
additional isolated Florida flooding, forecasters say the strong,
persistent storms that dumped up to 50 centimeters (20 inches) in
southern parts of the state appear to have passed.</p>
<p>Some neighborhood streets in the Miami and Fort Lauderdale areas
still have standing water, although it is rapidly receding, officials
said.</p>
<p>“The worst flooding risk was the last three days,” said Sammy Hadi, a
meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Miami. “The heaviest
rainfall has concluded.”</p>
<p>The no-name storm system pushed across Florida from the Gulf of
Mexico at roughly the same time as the early June start of hurricane
season, which this year is forecast to be among the most active in
recent memory amid concerns that climate change is increasing storm
intensity.</p>
<p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis held a media briefing in Hollywood,
south of Fort Lauderdale, and said while more rain was coming, it’s
likely to be more typical of South Florida afternoon showers this time
of year.</p>
<p>“We are going to get some more rain today, maybe throughout the
balance of the weekend. Hopefully it’s not approaching the levels that
it was, but we have a lot of resources staged here, and we’ll be able to
offer the state’s assistance,” he said.</p>
<p>DeSantis said the state has deployed about 100 pumps in addition to
what cities and counties are using to try to clear water from
streets.</p>
<p>Florida Emergency Management Director Kevin Guthrie said while
flooding was extensive, there were no reports of destroyed homes and
very few of severely damaged homes. No deaths or serious injuries have
been reported.</p>
<p>“We don’t think there’s going to be enough damage to necessarily
qualify for a federal disaster declaration,” DeSantis said. But he added
the storms may have affected enough business to qualify for Small
Business Administration assistance.</p>
<p>The downpours hit Tuesday and continued into Wednesday, delaying
flights at two of the state’s largest airports and leaving vehicles
waterlogged and stalled in some of the region’s lowest-lying streets.
The main problem was hundreds of vehicles that were stranded on streets
as people were unable to navigate the flood waters.</p>
<p>“Looked like the beginning of a zombie movie,” said Ted Rico, a tow
truck driver who spent much of Wednesday night and Thursday morning
helping to clear the streets of stalled vehicles. “There’s cars littered
everywhere, on top of sidewalks, in the median, in the middle of the
street, no lights on. Just craziness, you know. Abandoned cars
everywhere.”</p>

city repeals ban on psychic readings as industry gains more
acceptance</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NORFOLK, Virginia — Ashley Branton has earned a living as a psychic
medium for seven years, helping a growing number of people with heavy
choices about toxic relationships, home purchases and cross-country
moves.</p>
<p>And while the tarot cards are never wrong, she said, they didn’t see
this one coming.</p>
<p>The City Council in Norfolk, Virginia, repealed a 45-year-old ban
this week on “the practice of palmistry, palm reading, phrenology or
clairvoyance, for monetary or other compensation.”</p>
<p>Soothsaying, it turned out, had been a first-degree misdemeanor and
carried up to a year in jail.</p>
<p>“I had no idea that was even a thing,” Branton said with a laugh
Thursday among the crystals in her Norfolk shop, Velvet Witch, where she
also performs tarot readings and psychic healings. “I’m glad it’s never
come down on me.”</p>
<p>It’s unclear exactly why this city of 230,000 people on the
Chesapeake Bay, home to the nation’s largest Navy base, nullified the
1979 ordinance. Versions of the ban had existed for decades before.</p>
<p>Norfolk spokesperson Kelly Straub said in an email that it was
repealed “because it is no longer used.” City Council members said
little during their vote Tuesday, although one joked that “somebody out
there predicted that this was going to pass.”</p>
<p>Jokes aside, the city’s repeal comes as the psychic services industry
is growing in the U.S., generating an estimated $2.3 billion in revenue
last year and employing 97,000 people, according to a 2023 report from
market research firm IBIS World.</p>
<p>In late 2017, a Pew Research Center survey found that most American
adults identify as Christians. But many also hold New Age beliefs, with
4 in 10 believing in the power of psychics. A 2009 survey for the Pew
Research Center’s Religion &amp; Public Life Project found about 1 in 7
Americans had consulted a psychic.</p>
<p>Branton, 42, who previously worked as a makeup artist, said the
market is expanding for psychic mediums because social media has fueled
awareness. An aversion to organized religion also plays a role, along
with the nation’s divisive politics and a growing sense of uncertainty,
particularly among millennials and younger generations.</p>
<p>“Ever since COVID, people have been carrying this weight. They’re
just carrying so much,” Branton said.</p>
<p>“And people are starting to do inner work,” she continued. “They’re
starting to take care of their mental health. And they’re starting to
take care of the spiritual aspect.”</p>
<p>Branton said she considers her work a calling. Psychic gifts run in
her family, and she’s had them her whole life.</p>
<p>“I always had interactions with spirits,” she said. “I’ve always been
an empath. I can feel people’s energies.”</p>
<p>Branton said she’s built up her clientele through word of mouth,
without any advertising.</p>
<p>“I’m very proud of that,” she said. “There’s going to be scammers and
people out here doing this for just the money. Obviously, this is my way
of living now. But it was never about money for me.”</p>
<p>In 2022, AARP warned of scam psychics who prey on “people who are
grieving, lonely or struggling emotionally, physically or
financially.”</p>
<p>And some bans remain in place. In October, the police chief in
Hanover, Pennsylvania, told a witchcraft-themed store that any
complaints about tarot card readings would prompt an investigation, The
New York Times reported.</p>
<p>The police chief cited an old state law that makes it illegal to
predict the future for money. In 2007, the city of Philadelphia cited
the same law when it shut down more than a dozen psychics, astrologers
and tarot-card readers, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported.</p>
<p>Fortune telling bans stemmed from anti-witchcraft and anti-vagrancy
laws in 18th century England, said Charles McCrary, a professor of
religious studies at Eckerd College in St. Petersburg, Florida.</p>
<p>The American laws took hold in the mid-19th century, an era of
growing concern about fraudulent business practices, McCrary said. But
the Spiritualism movement, which often involved channeling the dead, was
also growing in popularity, particularly among the middle and upper
classes.</p>
<p>“There was something about these white, Spiritualist women that I
think troubled a lot of people,” McCrary said.</p>
<p>“Part of what made it threatening was it couldn’t be written off as
something that poor people do or something for the marginal,” he added.
“It was very popular. And so more mainstream Christians found it
especially threatening. And a lot of people were Christians who also did
seances.”</p>
<p>Such laws faced little scrutiny from the courts at first, said David
L. Hudson, a law professor at Belmont University in Nashville,
Tennessee, and a fellow with the Freedom Forum think tank in
Washington.</p>
<p>The Ohio Supreme Court upheld a state law in 1928 that regulated
fortune telling, writing that “liberty of speech is not license to speak
anything that one pleases freed from all criminal or civil
responsibility.” Other courts reasoned that fortune telling was
commercial speech, which received no First Amendment protection until
the mid-1970s.</p>
<p>More recently, courts have increasingly viewed bans on fortune
tellers with skepticism on First Amendment grounds. Maryland’s Supreme
Court ruled in 2010 that fortune telling for a fee is protected free
speech.</p>
<p>“We’ve come a long way, both in terms of social norms and social
acceptance,” Hudson told The Associated Press, likening psychic readings
to tattoos. “But also there’s been a massive development of First
Amendment law … It’s very disfavored to entirely ban a medium of
expression.”</p>
<p>Even though Norfolk’s ban was practically forgotten and no longer
enforced, Carol Peterson is relieved about the repeal. She owns the
Crystal Sunflower, a store in Norfolk that offers tarot card readings
and vibrational sound therapy. She is also a civilian geologist for the
military.</p>
<p>“I was like, ‘Oh my God, I could get a class one misdemeanor,’”
Peterson said.</p>
<p>“People have this misconceived notion that tarot is evil or demonic,”
Peterson added. “But you’re helping people tap into their highest self
for their journey. And if people would be more curious instead of
judgmental, I think that they would be pleasantly surprised.”</p>

birth of rare white buffalo calf fulfills Lakota prophecy</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>HELENA, Montana — The reported birth of a rare white buffalo in
Yellowstone National Park fulfills a Lakota prophecy that portends
better times, according to members of the American Indian tribe who
cautioned that it’s also a signal that more must be done to protect the
earth and its animals.</p>
<p>“The birth of this calf is both a blessing and warning. We must do
more,” said Chief Arvol Looking Horse, the spiritual leader of the
Lakota, Dakota and the Nakota Oyate in South Dakota, and the 19th keeper
of the sacred White Buffalo Calf Woman Pipe and Bundle.</p>
<p>The birth of the sacred calf comes as after a severe winter in 2023
drove thousands of Yellowstone buffalo, also known as bison, to lower
elevations. More than 1,500 were killed, sent to slaughter or
transferred to tribes seeking to reclaim stewardship over an animal
their ancestors lived alongside for millennia.</p>
<p>Erin Braaten of Kalispell took several photos of the calf shortly
after it was born on June 4 in the Lamar Valley in the northeastern
corner of the park.</p>
<p>Her family was visiting the park when she spotted “something really
white” among a herd of bison across the Lamar River.</p>
<p>Traffic ended up stopping while bison crossed the road, so Braaten
stuck her camera out the window to take a closer look with her telephoto
lens.</p>
<p>“I look and it’s this white bison calf. And I was just totally,
totally floored,” she said.</p>
<p>After the bison cleared the roadway, the Braatens turned their
vehicle around and found a spot to park. They watched the calf and its
mother for 30-45 minutes.</p>
<p>“And then she kind of led it through the willows there,” Braaten
said. Although Braaten came back each of the next two days, she didn’t
see the white calf again.</p>
<p>For the Lakota, the birth of a white buffalo calf with a black nose,
eyes and hooves is akin to the second coming of Jesus Christ, Looking
Horse said.</p>
<p>Lakota legend says about 2,000 years ago — when nothing was good,
food was running out and bison were disappearing — White Buffalo Calf
Woman appeared, presented a bowl pipe and a bundle to a tribal member,
taught them how to pray and said that the pipe could be used to bring
buffalo to the area for food. As she left, she turned into a white
buffalo calf.</p>
<p>“And some day when the times are hard again,” Looking Horse said in
relating the legend, “I shall return and stand upon the earth as a white
buffalo calf, black nose, black eyes, black hooves.”</p>
<p>A similar white buffalo calf was born in Wisconsin in 1994 and was
named Miracle, he said.</p>
<p>Troy Heinert, the executive director of the South Dakota-based
InterTribal Buffalo Council, said the calf in Braaten’s photos looks
like a true white buffalo because it has a black nose, black hooves and
dark eyes.</p>
<p>“From the pictures I’ve seen, that calf seems to have those traits,”
said Heinert, who is Lakota. An albino buffalo would have pink eyes.</p>
<p>A naming ceremony has been held for the Yellowstone calf, Looking
Horse said, though he declined to reveal the name. A ceremony
celebrating the calf’s birth is set for June 26 at the Buffalo Field
Campaign headquarters in West Yellowstone.</p>
<p>Other tribes also revere white buffalo.</p>
<p>“Many tribes have their own story of why the white buffalo is so
important,” Heinert said. “All stories go back to them being very
sacred.”</p>
<p>Heinert and several members of the Buffalo Field Campaign say they’ve
never heard of a white buffalo being born in Yellowstone, which has wild
herds. Park officials had not seen the buffalo yet and could not confirm
its birth in the park, and they have no record of a white buffalo being
born in the park previously.</p>
<p>Jim Matheson, executive director of the National Bison Association,
could not quantify how rare the calf is.</p>
<p>“To my knowledge, no one’s ever tracked the occurrence of white
buffalo being born throughout history. So I’m not sure how we can make a
determination how often it occurs.”</p>
<p>Besides herds of the animals on public lands or overseen by
conservation groups, about 80 tribes across the U.S. have more than
20,000 bison, a figure that’s been growing in recent years.</p>
<p>In Yellowstone and the surrounding area, the killing or removal of
large numbers of bison happens almost every winter, under an agreement
between federal and Montana agencies that has limited the size of the
park’s herds to about 5,000 animals. Yellowstone officials last week
proposed a slightly larger population of up to 6,000 bison, with a final
decision expected next month.</p>
<p>But ranchers in Montana have long opposed increasing the Yellowstone
herds or transferring the animals to tribes. Republican Gov. Greg
Gianforte has said he would not support any management plan with a
population target greater than 3,000 Yellowstone bison.</p>
<p>Heinert sees the calf’s birth as a reminder “that we need to live in
a good way and treat others with respect.”</p>
<p>“I hope that calf is safe and going to live its best life in
Yellowstone National Park, exactly where it was designed to be,” Heinert
said.</p>

id="some-mexican-shelters-see-crowding-as-bidens-asylum-ban-takes-hold">Some
Mexican shelters see crowding as Biden’s asylum ban takes hold</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MATAMOROS, Mexico — Some shelters south of the U.S. border are caring
for many more migrants now that the Biden administration stopped
considering most asylum requests, while others have yet to see much of a
change.</p>
<p>The impact appears uneven more than a week after the temporary
suspension took effect. Shelters south of Texas and California have
plenty of space, while as many as 500 deportations from Arizona each day
are straining shelters in Mexico’s Sonora state, their directors
say.</p>
<p>“We’re having to turn people away because we can’t, we don’t have the
room for all the people who need shelter,” said Joanna Williams,
executive director of Kino Border Initiative, which can take in 100
people at a time.</p>
<p>About 120 are in San Juan Bosco shelter in Nogales, across the border
from the Arizona city with the same name, up from about 40 before the
policy change, according to its director, Juan Francisco Loureiro.</p>
<p>“We have had a quite remarkable increase,” Loureiro said Thursday.
Most are Mexican, including families as well as adults. Mexico also
agreed to accept deportees from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and
Venezuela.</p>
<p>A shelter in Agua Prieta, a remote town bordering Douglas, Arizona,
also began receiving more Mexican men, women and children last weekend —
40 on Sunday, more than 50 on Monday and then about 30 a day. Like those
sent to Nogales, most had entered the U.S. farther west, along the
Arizona-California state line, according to Perla del Angel, a worker at
the Exodus Migrant Attention Center.</p>
<p>Mexicans make up a relatively large percentage of border arrests in
much of Arizona compared to other regions, which may help explain why
Nogales is affected. Mexicans are generally the easiest nationality to
deport because officials only have to drive them to a border crossing
instead of arranging a flight.</p>
<p>In Tijuana, directors of four large shelters said this week that they
haven’t received a single migrant deported since the asylum ban took
effect. Al Otro Lado, a migrant advocacy group, consulted only seven
migrants on the first full day operating an information booth at the
main crossing where migrants are deported from San Diego.</p>
<p>“What there is right now is a lot of uncertainty,” said Paulina
Olvera, president of Espacio Migrante, who houses up to 40 people
traveling in families, predominantly from Mexico, and has others
sleeping on the sidewalk outside. “So far what we’ve seen is the rumors
and the mental health impact on people. We haven’t seen returns
yet.”</p>
<p>Biden administration officials said last week that thousands have
been deported since the new rule took effect on July 5, suspending
asylum whenever arrests for illegal crossings hit a trigger of 2,500 in
a single day. The officials, who briefed reporters on condition of
anonymity, were not more specific. The halt will remain in effect until
arrests fall below a seven-day daily average of 1,500.</p>
<p>“We are ready to repatriate a record number of people in the coming
days,” Blas Nuñez-Neto, assistant homeland security secretary for border
and immigration policy, told Spanish-language reporters after the policy
was announced.</p>
<p>The Homeland Security Department did not immediately respond to a
request for figures on Friday and neither did the National Immigration
Institute in Mexico.</p>

id="speaker-house-will-sue-for-bidens-justice-department-interview-audio">Speaker:
House will sue for Biden’s Justice Department interview audio</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — Speaker Mike Johnson said Friday that the House of
Representatives would go to court to enforce the subpoena against
Attorney General Merrick Garland for access to President Joe Biden’s
special counsel audio interview, hours after the Justice Department
refused to prosecute Republicans’ contempt-of-Congress charge. </p>
<p>“It is sadly predictable that the Biden administration’s Justice
Department will not prosecute Garland for defying congressional
subpoenas even though the department aggressively prosecuted Steve
Bannon and Peter Navarro for the same thing,” Johnson said in a
statement.   </p>
<p>In a letter to Johnson earlier Friday, a Justice Department official
cited the agency’s “long-standing position and uniform practice” to not
prosecute officials who don’t comply with subpoenas because of a
president’s claim of executive privilege. </p>
<p>The Democratic president last month asserted executive privilege to
block the release of the audio, which the White House says Republicans
want only for political purposes. Republicans moved forward with the
contempt effort anyway, voting Wednesday to punish Garland for refusing
to provide the recording. </p>
<p>Assistant Attorney General Carlos Felipe Uriarte noted that the
Justice Department under presidents of both political parties has
declined to prosecute in similar circumstances when there has been a
claim of executive privilege. </p>
<p>Accordingly, the department “will not bring the congressional
contempt citation before a grand jury or take any other action to
prosecute the attorney general,” Uriarte said in the letter to Johnson.
The letter did not specify who in the Justice Department made the
decision. </p>
<p>Republicans were incensed when special counsel Robert Hur declined to
prosecute Biden over his handling of classified documents and quickly
opened an investigation. GOP lawmakers — led by Representatives Jim
Jordan and James Comer — sent a subpoena for audio of Hur’s interviews
with Biden, but the Justice Department turned over only some of the
records, leaving out audio of the interview with the president. </p>
<p>Republicans have accused the White House of suppressing the tape
because they say the president is afraid to have voters hear it during
an election year. </p>
<p>A transcript of the Hur interview showed Biden struggling to recall
some dates and occasionally confusing some details — something longtime
aides say he’s done for years in both public and private — but otherwise
showing deep recall in other areas. Biden and his aides are particularly
sensitive to questions about his age. At 81, he’s the oldest-ever
president, and he is currently seeking another four-year term. </p>
<p>The attorney general has said the Justice Department has gone to
extraordinary lengths to provide information to the lawmakers about
Hur’s investigation. However, Garland has said releasing the audio could
jeopardize future sensitive investigations because witnesses might be
less likely to cooperate if they know their interviews might become
public. </p>
<p>In a letter last month detailing Biden’s decision to assert executive
privilege, White House counsel Ed Siskel accused Republicans of seeking
the recordings so they can “chop them up” and distort them to attack the
president. Executive privilege gives presidents the right to keep
information from the courts, Congress and the public to protect the
confidentiality of decision-making, though it can be challenged in
court. </p>
<p>The Justice Department noted that it also declined to prosecute
Attorney General Bill Barr, who was held in contempt in 2019. The
Democratically controlled House voted to issue a referral against Barr
after he refused to turn over documents related to a special counsel
investigation into former President Donald Trump. </p>
<p>The Justice Department similarly declined to prosecute former Trump
White House chief of staff Mark Meadows after he was held in contempt of
Congress for ceasing to cooperate with the January 6 committee
investigating the attack on the U.S. Capitol. Years before that,
then-Attorney General Eric Holder was held in contempt related to the
gun-running operation known as Operation Fast and Furious. The Justice
Department also took no action against Holder. </p>
<p>Navarro and Bannon, two former Trump White House officials, were
prosecuted for contempt of Congress for defying subpoenas from the
January 6 committee. They were both found guilty at trial and sentenced
to four months in prison.</p>
