date: 2024-02-03, from: San Jose Mercury News

In practical terms — and in Haley's calculus — the GOP primary has barely begun. Just two states have voted so far in a process that will ultimately span all 50 before concluding at the GOP's national nominating convention in July.

## The European regulators listened to the Open Source communities

date: 2024-02-03, from: OS News

Many OSI Affiliates engaged with the European Commission, European Parliament and European Council during 2023. With the welcome coordination of Open Forum Europe, a group met regularly to keep track of progress explaining the issues. Many of us also committed time and travel to meet in-person. As a result of all this effort from so many people, the final text of the CRA mitigated pretty much all the risks we had identified to individual developers and to Open Source foundations. ↫ Simon Phipps (yes, the Simon Phipps) Many in the open source community were deeply worried about the EU&#8217;s Cyber Resiliency Act&#8217;s impact on open source software, and rightfully so. It&#8217;s great to hear that the EU communicated and cooperated closely with the open source community to ensure the impact of the CRA on open source would be minimal, and it turns out they listened. Excellent news.

## Senators Reach Deal on Border Policy Bill That Faces Uphill Road to Passage

date: 2024-02-02, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON  — Senate negotiators on Friday reached a deal on a proposal to overhaul the asylum system at the U.S. border with Mexico, clearing the way for Democratic and Republican Senate leaders to begin the difficult task of convincing Congress to pass a national security package that will include tens of billions of dollars for Ukraine and immigration enforcement, as well as funding for Israel and other American allies.


Sen. Chris Murphy, the lead Democratic negotiator, posted on social media Friday that a deal had been reached and that text of the bill would be released over the weekend. Senators are still working on finishing the rest of the package, which was initiated by a request from President Joe Biden for $110 billion for wartime aid for allies, domestic defense manufacturing, humanitarian assistance for conflicts around the world, and managing the influx of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border.




Senators are preparing for a key test vote on the package next week, but it already faces a steep climb through Congress. Republicans in both chambers have balked at compromises on border security policy. Senate Republicans had initially demanded that the package include border policy changes, but Donald Trump, the GOP's likely presidential nominee, has become a vocal opponent of the legislation.


"Republicans said the border is a priority and we should craft a bipartisan bill to help control the border. We did that. We have a deal," Murphy said on the social media platform X. He added: "It's decision time."


The core group of negotiators has been laboring for months to craft a package that can win support from a bipartisan coalition of moderates in Congress. As they prepared to allow the details of the bill to be scrutinized, it remained to be seen whether they could cobble together the requisite votes from both sides of the aisle.


"The criticisms are based on rumors and misconceptions," Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, an Arizona independent who was central to crafting the bill, said on Thursday.




Senate Democrats, increasingly wary of the political vulnerabilities facing Biden and their party on immigration, have become more comfortable with the contours of the package, though progressive and Hispanic members of the House are still expected to oppose the border policy changes in droves if it passes the Senate.


The wartime aid for Israel could also divide Democrats. Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent of Vermont, said Friday he would push to strip funding for offensive weaponry for Israel from the package while maintaining funds for defensive systems.


On the right, many conservatives oppose both continued funding for Ukraine, as well as compromises on border enforcement. House Speaker Mike Johnson has repeatedly declared he won't compromise on hardline border enforcement measures, but he has said he will not pass final judgment until he is able to read the bill.


As GOP lawmakers view the political repercussions of enacting immigration laws in the midst of an election year, many Trump allies have argued that Congress does not even need to act because presidents already have enough authority on the border. And in a sign they will try to stop the bill from advancing to a final vote, some have lobbied leaders to give them weeks to make further changes through committee hearings.


"I think we've pretty much been held hostage by the Republican leadership. The Republican leadership pushed this on us," Sen. Tommy Tuberville, a Republican of Alabama, said Thursday on Steve Bannon's "War Room" podcast. "And now if we don't pass something, we're going to look bad in the eyes of the American people. But I'm just telling people right now we do not need a border policy. We already have one intact."


The legislation largely focuses on a challenge that both Republican and Democratic administrations have grappled with: How to tamp down the growing number of people who come to the border seeking asylum, which offers protection from persecution for race, religion, political affiliation or membership in a discriminated group.


Asylum is a key part of international law and the U.S.'s ability to advance human rights, but the system has become overwhelmed in recent years, creating years-long waits for asylum cases to be heard, even though many migrants fail to prove their asylum case in the end.


The bill seeks to address that, according to Sinema, by making it tougher for people to enter the asylum system, dramatically speeding up the process, and denying them the ability to apply for asylum if illegal border crossings grow to become unmanageable for authorities.


Most migrants who seek asylum would receive an initial interview, known as a credible fear screening, within days of arriving at the border. They would then either be expelled from the country or given a work permit during a months-long wait to have their case heard by an immigration judge.


Immigration advocates are concerned the proposal would deprive asylum-seekers of the ability to make full cases, especially when they have just made arduous and often traumatic journeys to get to the U.S.

## US Begins Retaliation for Deadly Drone Attack on Its Soldiers

date: 2024-02-02, from: VOA News USA

Washington  — The United States has begun carrying out airstrikes in the Middle East in retaliation for last Sunday's fatal drone attack on an American base in Jordan.  



The U.S. Central Command said its forces on Friday "conducted airstrikes in Iraq and Syria against Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps [IRGC] Quds Force and affiliated militia groups. U.S. military forces struck more than 85 targets, with numerous aircraft to include long-range bombers flown from [the] United States."




"We hit exactly what we meant to hit," said U.S. Army Lieutenant General Douglas Sims, who serves as the operations director for the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He explained the air assault took place over about 30 minutes and said that three of the sites struck were in Iraq and four were in Syria.


Iraq, but not Iran, was informed prior to the strikes, according to U.S. officials.


U.S. President Joe Biden said the attacks were carried out at his direction.


"Our response began today. It will continue at times and places of our choosing. The United States does not seek conflict in the Middle East or anywhere else in the world.  But let all those who might seek to do us harm know this: If you harm an American, we will respond," said Biden in a Friday evening statement.


Hours before the U.S. military response, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi reiterated earlier promises to potentially retaliate for any U.S. strikes targeting its interests.


Iran, he said, "will not start a war, but if a country, if a cruel force wants to bully us, the Islamic Republic of Iran will give a strong response." 


B-1 bombers were flown from the United States and were part of the operation that used more than 125 precision munitions, according to U.S. military officials.


"This is the start of our response," Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement. "The president has directed additional actions to hold the IRGC and affiliated militias accountable for their attacks on U.S. and Coalition Forces. These will unfold at times and places of our choosing.


"There will be additional response actions taken in [the] coming days."


On a call with journalists, White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said, "There will be additional response actions taken in [the] coming days.”


The U.S military said it struck "command and control operations, centers, intelligence centers, rockets, and missiles, and unmanned aired vehicle storages, and logistics and munition supply chain facilities of militia groups and their IRGC sponsors who facilitated attacks against U.S. and coalition forces." 


Syrian state media in Damascus reported that "U.S. aggression" at several sites in desert areas and along the Syria-Iraq border had resulted in casualties.  


Biden and Austin, among other U.S. government officials, had made clear in recent days there would be a multi-tiered military response after the first American deaths under fire in what some describe as an escalating proxy war with Iranian-supported militias in the region. 


Sunday's attack on a base in Jordan killed three U.S. soldiers and injured more than 40 others. There has been no U.S. communication with Iran since that attack, said Kirby.


There have been more than 165 attacks on U.S. forces in the Middle East since mid-October. 


"I think anytime you lose men and women overseas in an operation, it does put additional pressure on any administration, whether they're Democrats or Republicans, to take a very firm response," Jeremi Suri, a history professor at the University of Texas at Austin told VOA. 


"The huge issue that the administration is dealing with is having a strong deterrence policy without having escalation throughout the region, and threading that needle is difficult. I would say the choices that they made so far have been good ones," said Suri.  


The latest conflict in the Middle East was sparked nearly four months ago by Hamas terrorists and other militant groups crossing from Gaza into Israel and slaughtering 1,200 people, mostly Israeli civilians, in their homes, at a music festival and elsewhere.  


Return of slain U.S. soldiers 


The first indication of Friday's retaliatory bombings came minutes after a dignified transfer of the remains of the three U.S. Army reservists concluded at Dover Air Force Base in the state of Delaware.  


The Friday airstrikes by U.S. warplanes "had no connection, none whatsoever, with the timing of the dignified transfer," Kirby said in response to a question from VOA.


Biden and first lady Jill Biden watched for 15 minutes as a carry team of seven soldiers wearing white gloves in a formation of two lines marched slowly toward a C5 Galaxy military transport plane to individually retrieve the transfer cases that were draped with American flags. 


They carried each case about 100 meters toward a vehicle, slowly passing a somber-looking president who had his right hand on his chest. The other civilians, including the first lady and Austin, also had their hands on hearts, as did attending lawmakers and grieving family members.   


The president's attendance at the event came amid a ray of optimism that Hamas and Israel were moving slowly toward a deal to free hostages held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip in exchange for a freeing by Israel of Palestinian prisoners and a truce.  


Israel-Hamas war 


Israel has relentlessly bombarded Gaza in response to the October 7 terror attacks. The response has killed more than 27,000 Palestinians and wounded 66,000, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry. Officials with the United Nations say the war has created a humanitarian catastrophe with about a quarter of Gaza's 2.3 million people starving.  


The Israel Defense Forces said Friday it attacked a Hezbollah military complex and trucks that were storing weapons in southern Lebanon.  


Fighter jets attacked the complex near the village of Lida, and the truck hit was near the village of Shuba, according to the IDF. This operation followed rocket launches into northern Israel from Hezbollah earlier in the day.  


The Houthi movement said it fired ballistic missiles Friday at the Red Sea port city of Eilat in Israel. The IDF said its Arrow aerial defense system had intercepted a surface-to-surface missile over the Red Sea.  


VOA White House Bureau Chief Patsy Widakuswara contributed to this report from Dover Air Force Base in Delaware.

## We Have Learned Nothing in the Year Since East Palestine

date: 2024-02-02, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTI4NjQ2OC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcyNDQ4NTQ1NX0.eX9jQZpaVEBFuzItO-EWczp5pG-upjjW0OBEkCYu0bo/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p>This time last year, the 151 cars of Norfolk Southern train 32N were still rolling along somewhere between Madison, Illinois, and Ohio’s eastern border. The train had suffered a brief breakdown on its northeast journey to Toledo, where a new crew came on before the double locomotives turned southeast, following the shore of Lake Erie into Cleveland, a metropolitan area of 2.18 million residents. It’d have been an irritating train to encounter at a railroad crossing: It stretched almost two miles long. </p>
<p>32N also weighed 18,000 tons, and in its 20 hazardous material tank cars, it carried some 700,000 pounds of vinyl chloride, a known carcinogen, which had originated in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/17/climate/train-fire-palestine-plastics-pvc.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">chemical plant</a> outside of Houston — a crucial hub in the American plastics machine, booming thanks to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/17/climate/train-fire-palestine-plastics-pvc.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cheap shale gas</a>. Some rail workers reportedly referred to the train as “32 Nasty,” due to its reputation for being <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/88qze4/32-nasty-rail-workers-say-they-knew-the-train-that-derailed-in-east-palestine-was-dangerous" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">difficult to handle</a>.</p>
<p>On February 3, 2023, around 8:12 p.m., 32N passed a metal processing plant in Salem, Ohio, where surveillance footage showed flames and sparks coming from the wheels of one of the cars. About half an hour later, 38 of its cars derailed due to an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/07/business/norfolk-southern-derailment-east-palestine-regulation.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">overheated wheel bearing</a> that engineers detected only after it was too late to stop the rupture. Eleven of the derailed cars carried <a href="https://www.news5cleveland.com/news/east-palestine-train-derailment/one-year-later-east-palestine-residents-still-concerned-about-health-homes-businesses-futures" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hazardous materials</a>, which immediately began leaking into the soil, nearby water, and air. The train came to rest a little less than 200 miles away from its final destination, abruptly terminating in a burst of flames in East Palestine, Ohio, population 4,700. </p>
<p>A year on, what we still don’t know about the Norfolk Southern derailment is almost as shocking as what we do. For all the <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/pittsburgh/news/epa-formal-review-vinyl-chloride-east-palestine-ohio-train-derailment/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">attention of the Environmental Protection Agency</a>, which was on site almost immediately after the accident, there are glaring pieces of information missing: the <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/epa-promised-clarity-transparency-after-ohio-train-derailment-but-some-air-monitors-didnt-work/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">concentration of the chemicals</a> locals were exposed to; how much of the surrounding environment <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/mar/17/norfolk-southern-derailment-east-palestine-ohio-carcinogenic-chemical-levels" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">is still polluted</a>; and what health issues could still arise. Even “the plan for documenting and responding to long-term health effects experienced by residents is still being ironed out,” <em>Bloomberg</em> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-02/a-train-derailment-in-ohio-has-a-toxic-legacy-how-toxic-is-still-unclear" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reports</a>, 364 days later.</p>
<p>Days after the initial derailment and the town’s first round of evacuation orders, emergency responders and Norfolk Southern made the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/02/17/ohio-derailment-controlled-burning-toxic/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">decision</a> to vent and then ignite the train’s remaining vinyl chloride days later, reportedly to <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/news/2023/02/norfolk-southern-train-was-traveling-below-the-speed-limit-when-it-derailed-in-east-palestine.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">prevent an explosion</a>. This sent an alarming black plume into the sky over the town. Locals subsequently reported headaches, nausea, rashes, and coughs, among other ailments; some said they saw animals <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/02/16/ohio-train-derailment-response-toxic-contamination/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">get sick or die</a>. “We basically nuked a town with chemicals so we could get a railroad open,” one hazardous materials expert <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/3856043-3-more-chemicals-discovered-in-ohio-train-derailment/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> <em>The Associated Press</em> in the aftermath. </p>
<p>Former President Donald Trump visited three weeks after the derailment to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-speaks-forgotten-american-during-trip-east-palestine-we-stand-with-you" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hand out Trump-branded water bottles</a> and tell the residents, “You are not forgotten.” Marianne Williamson, who is mounting a longshot challenge to President Joe Biden in the 2024 Democratic primary, <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/marianne-williamson-climate-change-2024" target="_self">recalled to Heatmap</a> last summer that on her own visit after the disaster, “I saw the frustration, the bitterness, the despair, and in some cases, the hopelessness of people who had been not only neglected, abandoned, abused, and traumatized by Norfolk Southern, but had been re-traumatized by the neglect of their state and federal government.” Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg visited the day after Trump; Biden is expected to make his first visit to the disaster zone this month.</p>
<p>Despite bipartisan hand-wringing, little has been done to prevent another disaster. A <a href="https://www.brown.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/as-one-year-anniversary-of-norfolk-southern-train-derailment-approaches-brown-continues-to-fight-for-east-palestine-and-rail-safety" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rail safety bill</a> that would enhance safety protocols for trains carrying hazardous materials sponsored by Ohio’s Senators, Democrat Senator Sherrod Brown and its Republican JD Vance, has yet to go to the floor. Experts <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/transportation/4404209-mcconnell-stands-in-way-of-brown-vance-victory-on-rail-safety-act/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">don’t believe</a> it will get the nine necessary Republican votes to advance, partly because Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell opposes it.</p>
<p>Yet Toxic-Free Future <a href="https://toxicfreefuture.org/research/toxic-cargo/key-findings/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reports</a> that some 3 million people live along vinyl chloride transportation routes between the plants in Texas and the plastic factories in New Jersey, and train derailments <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/28/business/ohio-train-derailment-safety-east-palestine.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">have been on the rise</a>. </p>
<p>Politicians and pundits will mark Saturday’s derailment with their cases and appeals for this and that. But locals are uncomfortably aware that it will be years more before they know what their lingering coughs and headaches mean — for them, for their children, and everything else attempting to live in their town. Whatever eventually becomes clear may be a help to others down the line, but will likely come too late for East Palestine.</p>

## Carl Weathers, Linebacker-Turned-Actor in 'Rocky,' ‘Predator’ Movies, Dies

date: 2024-02-02, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — Carl Weathers, a former NFL linebacker who became a Hollywood action movie and comedy star, playing nemesis-turned-ally Apollo Creed in the “Rocky” movies, facing off against Arnold Schwarzenegger in “Predator” and teaching golf in “Happy Gilmore,” has died. He was 76.


Matt Luber, his manager, said Weathers died Thursday. His family issued a statement saying he died “peacefully in his sleep."


Weathers was comfortable flexing his muscles on the big screen in “Action Jackson” as well as joking around on the small screen in such shows as “Arrested Development.” He was perhaps most closely associated with Creed, who made his first appearance as the cocky, undisputed heavyweight world champion in 1976’s “Rocky,” starring Sylvester Stallone.


“It puts you on the map and makes your career, so to speak. But that’s a one-off, so you’ve got to follow it up with something. Fortunately, those movies kept coming, and Apollo Creed became more and more in people’s consciousness and welcome in their lives, and it was just the right guy at the right time,” he told The Daily Beast in 2017.


Most recently, Weathers appeared in all three seasons of the Disney+ hit “The Mandalorian,” for which he earned an Emmy nomination in 2021.


Creed, who appeared in the first four “Rocky” movies, memorably died in the ring of 1984’s “Rocky IV,” going toe-to-toe with the hulking, steroid-using Soviet Ivan Drago, played by Dolph Lundgren.




Weathers went on to 1987’s “Predator,” where he flexed his pecs alongside Schwarzenegger, Jesse Ventura and a host of others, and 1988’s nouveau blaxploitation flick “Action Jackson.”


He later added a false wooden hand to play a golf pro for the 1996 comedy classic “Happy Gilmore” opposite Adam Sandler and starred in Dick Wolf’s short-lived spin-off series “Chicago Justice” in 2017.


He also voiced Combat Carl in the “Toy Story” franchise.


Weathers grew up admiring actors such as Woody Strode, whose combination of physique and acting prowess in “Spartacus” made an early impression. Others he idolized included actors Sidney Poitier and Harry Belafonte and athletes Jim Brown and Muhammad Ali, stars who broke the mold and the color barrier.


“There are so many people that came before me who I admired and whose success I wanted to emulate, and just kind of hit the benchmarks they hit in terms of success, who created a pathway that I’ve been able to walk and find success as a result. And hopefully I can inspire someone else to do good work as well,” he told the Detroit News in 2023.


Growing up in New Orleans, Weathers started performing in plays as early as grade school. In high school, athletics took him down another path, but he would reunite with his first love later in life.


Weathers played college football at San Diego State University — he majored in theater — and went on to play for one season in the NFL, for the Oakland Raiders, in 1970.


After the Raiders, he joined the Canadian Football League, playing for two years while finishing his studies during the offseason at San Francisco State University. He graduated with a B.A. in drama in 1974.


After appearing in several films and TV shows, including “Good Times,” “The Six Million Dollar Man,” “In the Heat of the Night” and “Starsky & Hutch,” as well as fighting Nazis alongside Harrison Ford in “Force 10 From Navarone,” Weathers landed his knockout role — Creed. He told The Hollywood Reporter that his start in the iconic franchise was not auspicious.


He was asked to read with the writer, Stallone, then unknown. Weathers read the scene but felt it didn’t land and so he blurted out: “I could do a lot better if you got me a real actor to work with,” he recalled. “So I just insulted the star of the movie without really knowing it and not intending to.”


Weathers is survived by two sons.

## VOA Headquarters Honored as Historic Site in Journalism

date: 2024-02-02, from: VOA News USA

Washington  — A plaque honoring Voice of America's headquarters in Washington as a historic site in journalism was unveiled Thursday, with current and former newsroom leaders present to affirm the importance of the outlet's editorial independence.


The Society of Professional Journalists, or SPJ, designated VOA's Washington headquarters as a historic journalism site in 2022 and formally handed over the plaque on Thursday.


"We chose VOA because of its long history of ethical and independent journalism," Dan Kubiske, a board member of SPJ's Washington chapter, told VOA at the event.


This is the eighth time SPJ has honored a historic journalism site in the Washington area, according to Kubiske.


He added that he hopes the VOA commemoration helps people "understand that VOA reporters and editors are not government hacks."


"They are reporters and editors in the tradition of all the great reporters and editors in the country," Kubiske continued.


Although funded by Congress, VOA and its sister outlets are editorially independent.


"For more than 80 years and in more than 80 languages, the Voice of America has been a comprehensive source of accurate and objective journalism," the plaque reads. "Despite its status as a U.S. government agency, VOA has its editorial independence protected through custom and its charter."




Following the plaque's unveiling, current and former newsroom leaders gathered to discuss the highlights and challenges they experienced during their various tenures.


For David Ensor, a veteran journalist who led VOA from 2011 to 2015, a particularly proud moment was when he helped VOA establish a local language service in Mali amid rising terrorist activity in the country's north.


"One of my favorite moments as director was driving through the streets of the capital city in the evening," Ensor said. "And you could hear Voice of America playing in every house in the entire city."


Political challenges facing VOA over the years also featured in the panel's discussion.


"Talking about being beaten around politically, I don't think there's been any era where that hasn't happened," said Amanda Bennett, CEO of VOA's parent organization, the U.S. Agency for Global Media, and a former VOA director.


"I think that's the nature of the game when you're a free press," she added during the panel discussion.


Bennett served as VOA's director from 2016 until 2020, when she resigned following the congressional confirmation of conservative activist Michael Pack to lead the U.S. Agency for Global Media, or USAGM. That came after then-President Donald Trump spent months condemning VOA's coverage.


A federal investigation later found that Pack repeatedly abused power and engaged in severe mismanagement. Pack targeted staffers perceived as critical of Trump and interfered in the outlet's journalistic independence.


Sanford Ungar, who led VOA from 1999 to 2001, warned that tough times could be ahead for the international broadcaster.


"The next 10 months are very, very important for the future life of VOA," said Ungar, who now runs the Free Speech Project at Georgetown University.


"There's a strong possibility that VOA in particular, but perhaps all of USAGM, will be under siege, once again, after the election in November," Ungar continued.


Bennett said fortifying VOA's independence is a priority.


"Every day, no matter what we know is up ahead, we should be strengthening and practicing that independence," she said. "It is the fundamental, existential fact of our existence."

## Big Oil Is Doing Great ... Except in California

date: 2024-02-02, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTI4NjAyMi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcyMDM3Mjg5OX0.7s_xr5JE4aX2_FiWNmwKBfk8lgzY2CVSAOjTB_QK8h4/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p>It was a good 2023 for Big Oil. In most places.</p><p>Both Exxon and Chevron reported substantial fourth quarter and full-year 2023 earnings Friday — $36 billion and $21 billion for 2023, respectively, their <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/energy-oil/oil-profits-keep-flowing-for-exxon-and-chevron-458b3b83" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">second highest annual profits</a> ever. Both also called out California, however, once one of the cradles of the U.S. oil industry (see: <em>There Will Be Blood</em>) and now its biggest domestic political headache as a place where they’re enduring billions in losses.<br/><br/>While the two oil majors’ issues in California are specific to how they operate there, they are also perhaps a preview — or a warning — of what a full spectrum climate policy could mean for them. </p><p>While the Biden administration has done more legislating on climate than any previous administration, it has not done much of anything to impair the supply of hydrocarbons. Instead, the Inflation Reduction Act is largely devoted to subsidizing the supply of non-carbon-emitting forms of energy (and electric vehicles) and making it easier for people to electrify their homes. The upcoming Environmental Protection Agency power plant regulations, meanwhile, are designed essentially to <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/epa-power-plants-supreme-court" target="_self">force power plant operators</a> to capture and store their emissions.</p><p>All of this would, if it works, increase demand for green energy and decrease demand for fossil energy. But much to the chagrin of many environmentalists, it would do little directly to limit fossil fuel extraction — nor, to the chagrin of more market-oriented environmentalists, would it set a tax on carbon emissions or establish a cap-and-trade system that would act as a tax. As Biden administration officials sometimes point out, oil and gas production has hit <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2049" target="_blank">record highs</a> under their watch.</p><p>California is different. It has a cap-and-trade system, it’s passed restrictions on where oil and gas drilling can occur (although they’re <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/california-new-oil-well-approvals-have-nearly-ground-halt-data-show-2023-07-13/#:~:text=California%20also%20passed%20a%20law,including%20homes%2C%20schools%20and%20hospitals." target="_blank">on hold</a> pending a referendum that could overturn them), and permitting for new oil wells has slowed to near zero. Local governments there are often not particularly keen on hydrocarbon infrastructure or drilling, especially offshore.</p><p>In its earnings release, Exxon reported a $2 billion “impairment as a result of regulatory obstacles in California that have prevented production and distribution assets from coming back online.” This was a reference to its <a href="https://www.syu.exxonmobil.com/history" target="_blank">oil and gas operation off the Santa Barbara County coast</a>, which started pumping in the early 1980s and stopped in 2015, when a pipeline rupture spilled more than 142,000 gallons of oil <a href="https://www.independent.com/2022/09/29/plains-all-american-pipeline-to-pay-230-million-in-oil-spill-settlement/" target="_blank">into the ocean</a>. Exxon has been trying to get out of this business ever since, even lending money to another company to take the project off its hands. However, the deal has been <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/exxons-faces-hurdles-25-billion-exit-california-offshore-2024-01-08/" target="_blank">continually delayed</a> thanks to litigation surrounding pipeline repairs, as well as getting state and local approvals to operate again.</p><p><span></span>For Chevron, which is headquartered in California and maintains an active extraction and refining operation there, the <a href="https://www.chevron.com/-/media/chevron/PDF-Reports/Investors/2023-4Q-earnings-pressrelease-.pdf" target="_blank">troubles</a> were “higher U.S. upstream impairment charges <em>mainly in California</em>” — emphasis mine.</p><p>In an earlier release this year, Chevron previewed losses from its California operations, saying that they were “due to continuing regulatory challenges in the state that have resulted in lower anticipated future investment levels in its business plans.” Combined with writedowns in the Gulf of Mexico, the company reported $3.7 billion worth of charges on its fourth quarter earnings. </p><p>Chevron — which operates refineries in both Northern and Southern California — has been in a public dispute with California policymakers over their energy policy proposals, especially around refining. The state plans to ban sales of internal combustion vehicles by 2035 and is working through a proposal to <a href="https://www.energy.ca.gov/event/workshop/2023-11/sb-x1-2-workshop-maximum-gross-gasoline-refining-margin-and-penalty" target="_blank">essentially cap profits on refining gasoline in the state</a>. Chevron officials have said that a refining margin cap would make it “really challenging to want to put our money there,” the company’s refining chief Andy Walz <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-27/chevron-says-california-s-climate-fight-is-fueling-soaring-gas-prices" target="_blank">told <em>Bloomberg</em></a>.<strong><em></em></strong></p><p>California has consistently higher gas prices than other states thanks to its lack of access to a national market (it’s not served by a pipeline network) and special requirements for its gasoline. Today, gas prices are $4.57 a gallon in California compared to $3.15 nationally, <a href="https://gasprices.aaa.com/?state=CA" target="_blank">according to AAA</a>. If Chevron is right about how California will treat refiners going forward, that gap could grow. <strong></strong></p>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-02-02, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

Here's what the snag was. We were low on storage starting at the beginning and eventually we ran out of space, and the error messages we got indicated the problem was something else. All the searching we did, none of the hits, or ChatGPT suggested looking at memory usage. Quite independently after thrashing around trying various theories, we finally got a message from the Digital Ocean service saying the server was out of space. When I doubled the space, that gave it enough room to do the tasks we had for it. Now running the last query. Looks like we may be over the hump. Let's just pray the software runs when we turn the server back on. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">💥</span>

## US Bolsters Defenses Around Jordan Base as It Readies Response to Drone Attack

date: 2024-02-02, from: VOA News USA

washington — The U.S. has bolstered defenses at a base in Jordan that was attacked by Iran-backed militants as it prepares for a wider U.S. response to the drone attack that killed three service members, a U.S. official said Friday.


Even as a larger U.S. military response seemed imminent, some Iran-backed factions pledged to continue to attack U.S. forces in the Middle East. In a statement released Friday, one of Iraq's strongest Iran-backed militias, Harakat al-Nujaba, announced its plans to continue military operations against U.S. troops, despite other allied factions having called off their attacks in the wake of the Sunday drone strike in Jordan.


Some of the militias have been a threat to U.S. bases for years, but the groups intensified their attacks in the wake of Israel's war with Hamas following the October 7 terror attack on Israel. The war has led to the deaths of thousands of civilians in Gaza and spilled across four other countries. Iran-backed militia groups throughout the region have used the conflict to justify striking Israeli or U.S. interests, including threatening civilian commercial ships and U.S. warships with drones or missiles in almost daily exchanges.


On Friday, the Israeli military said its Arrow defense system intercepted a missile that approached the country from the Red Sea, raising suspicion it was launched by Yemen's Houthi rebels. The rebels did not immediately claim responsibility.


A second U.S. official said the military had taken additional self-defense strikes inside Yemen Friday against Houthi military targets deemed an imminent threat. Al-Masirah, a Houthi-run satellite news channel, said that British and American forces conducted three strikes in the northern Yemeni province of Hajjah, a Houthi stronghold.


While previous U.S. responses in Iraq and Syria have been more limited, the attack on Tower 22, as the Jordan outpost is known, and the deaths of the three service members has crossed a line, the official said. In response, the U.S. is weighing a much wider response to include striking militia leaders. The U.S. options under consideration include targets in Syria, Yemen and Iraq, where the Iranian-made drone that killed the service members was fired from, the official said.


The attack on Tower 22 led to the first deaths of U.S. service members since the war between Israel and Hamas broke out. U.S. response options were being weighed as President Joe Biden, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs General Charles Q. Brown traveled to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to be with the families of those fallen soldiers as they are honored at a transfer ceremony.


The U.S. has blamed the Jordan attack on the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, a coalition of Iranian-backed militias. In the days since the attack, the U.S. has bolstered the defenses around Tower 22, which houses about 350 U.S. troops and sits near the demilitarized zone on the border between Jordan and Syria. The Iraqi border is only 6 miles (10 kilometers) away.


On Thursday, Defense Secretary Austin indicated the U.S. response against the militias would widen.


"At this point, it's time to take away even more capability than we've taken in the past," Austin said in his first press conference since he was hospitalized on January 1 due to complications from prostate cancer treatment.




Austin said that Iran has had a hand in the attacks by supplying and training the militias. The U.S. has tried to communicate through backchannels to Iran over the last few months to get them to rein in the militant groups, another U.S. official said.


The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details that have not been acknowledged publicly.


The U.S. has also tried more limited military responses in a series of strikes against weapons storage sites and training areas. So far, the U.S. response has not deterred the groups, which have attacked U.S. facilities at least 166 times since October.


At least one group, Kataib Hezbollah, another powerful Iranian-backed Iraqi militia, which has been watched closely by U.S. officials, said Tuesday it would "suspend military and security operations against the occupying forces" to avoid embarrassing the Iraqi government in the wake of the Jordan attack.

## Biden Meets Grieving Families of 3 US Troops Killed in Jordan

date: 2024-02-02, from: VOA News USA

DOVER AIR FORCE BASE, DELAWARE — U.S. President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden joined grieving families at Dover Air Force Base on Friday to honor the three American service members killed in a drone attack in Jordan. The solemn ritual, called a dignified transfer, has become relatively uncommon in recent years as the U.S. has withdrawn from conflicts abroad.


The Bidens arrived at the base Friday afternoon to witness the transfer of the remains of the troops killed in Sunday's assault. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and General Charles Q. Brown, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, joined the Bidens for the transfer in Dover.


The Bidens met privately with the families before the ceremony.


The Army Reserve members killed Sunday were all from Georgia — Sergeant William Jerome Rivers of Carrollton, Sergeant Kennedy Sanders of Waycross and Sergeant Breonna Moffett of Savannah. Sanders and Moffett were posthumously promoted to sergeant rank.


The deaths were the first U.S. fatalities blamed on Iran-backed militia groups, who for months have been intensifying their attacks on American forces in the region following the onset of the Israel-Hamas war in October. Separately, two Navy SEALs died during a January mission to board an unflagged ship that was carrying illicit Iranian-made weapons to Yemen.


“These service members embodied the very best of our nation: Unwavering in their bravery. Unflinching in their duty. Unbending in their commitment to our country — risking their own safety for the safety of their fellow Americans and our allies and partners with whom we stand in the fight against terrorism,” Biden said earlier this week. “It is a fight we will not cease.”




Sanders' father, Shawn, in a posting on Facebook on Friday morning said that “kindness and outpouring of love” was “the only thing holding me up” since his daughter's death.


“This is not the homecoming for Kennedy I dreamed about,” he said in the post. “Now, I can’t stop reliving this nightmare.”


At Thursday’s National Prayer Breakfast at the Capitol, Biden acknowledged Rivers, Moffett and Sanders by name, again vowing to never forget their sacrifice to the nation.


“They risked it all,” the president said.


Rivers, Sanders and Moffett hailed from different corners of Georgia but were brought together in the same company of Army engineers that was based in Fort Moore. Sanders and Moffett, in particular, were close friends who regularly popped in on each other's phone calls with their families back home.


Moffett had turned 23 years old just nine days before she was killed. She joined the Army Reserves in 2019, but she also worked for a home care provider to cook, clean and run errands for people with disabilities.


Sanders, 24, worked at a pharmacy while studying to become an X-ray technician and coached children’s soccer and basketball. She had volunteered for the deployment because she wanted to see different parts of the world, according to her parents.


Rivers, who was 46 years old and went by Jerome, joined the Army Reserve in New Jersey in 2011 and served a nine-month tour in Iraq in 2018.


The Dover ceremonies have been increasingly uncommon as the U.S. has withdrawn from conflicts abroad, most notably the war in Afghanistan, where U.S. involvement lasted two decades.


According to the most recent statistics available from the Defense Department, no service members were killed as a result of hostile action in 2022. Thirteen service members were killed as a result of hostile action the year prior during the fall of Kabul in Afghanistan, when a suicide bomber at the airport’s Abbey Gate killed 11 Marines, one sailor and one soldier. Nine service members were killed as a result of hostile action in 2020.


The U.S. government said this week that the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an umbrella group of Iran-backed militias that includes the group Kataib Hezbollah, had planned, resourced and facilitated the overnight drone attack. While Biden and White House officials have stressed that they don’t want a broader war with Iran, the administration has also warned that it will respond to the deadly assault.


More than 40 troops were injured in the Sunday drone attack at Tower 22, a secretive U.S. military desert outpost whose location allows U.S. forces to infiltrate and quietly leave Syria.

## Court Filing Reveals Relationship Between District Attorney, Special Prosecutor in Trump Case

date: 2024-02-02, from: VOA News USA

atlanta, georgia — A court filing Friday discloses that Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis is involved in a "personal relationship" with a special prosecutor she hired for the Georgia election interference case against former President Donald Trump, but she argues there are no grounds to dismiss the case or to remove her from the prosecution. 


Willis hired special prosecutor Nathan Wade in November 2021 to assist her investigation into whether the Republican former president and others broke any laws as they tried to overturn his loss in the 2020 presidential election in Georgia. Since Trump and 18 others were indicted in August, Wade has led the team of lawyers Willis assembled to prosecute the case. 


In an affidavit accompanying the filing, Wade said that in 2022, he and the district attorney had developed a personal relationship in addition to their "professional association and friendship." 


He also said he had never lived with Willis nor shared a financial account or household expenses with her. He said none of the funds paid to him as part of the job have been shared with Willis, an attempt to undercut defense lawyer claims of a conflict of interest. 


Wade described himself and Willis as "both financially independent professionals; expenses or personal travel were roughly divided equally between us." 


"At times," Wade said, "I have made and purchased travel for District Attorney Willis and myself from my personal funds. At other times District Attorney Willis has made and purchased travel for she and I from her personal funds." 


"I have no financial interest in the outcome of the 2020 election interference case or in the conviction of any defendant," he wrote. 




The Friday filing by Willis' team came in response to a motion filed last month by defense attorney Ashleigh Merchant, who represents Trump co-defendant Michael Roman. The motion alleged that Willis and Wade were in an inappropriate romantic relationship that created a conflict of interest. The filing seeks to dismiss the case and to have Willis and Wade and their offices barred from further prosecuting the case. 


Trump and at least one other co-defendant, Georgia attorney Robert Cheeley, have filed motions to join Roman's effort to dismiss the indictment and remove Willis from the case. 


Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee, who's presiding over the election case, has set a February 15 hearing on Roman's motion. Willis and Wade are among a dozen witnesses Merchant has subpoenaed to testify at that hearing. 


The Friday filing asks McAfee to dismiss Roman's motion without a hearing.

## Pluralistic: Worker misclassification is a competition issue (02 Feb 2024)

date: 2024-02-02, from: Cory Doctorow's blog

Today's links Worker misclassification is a competition issue: Corrupt employers created a market for lemons. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2004, 2009, 2014, 2019, 2023 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading Worker misclassification is a competition issue (permalink) The brains behind Trump's stolen Supreme Court have detailed plans: they didn't just scheme to pack the court with judges who weren't qualified for &#8211; or entitled to &#8211; a SCOTUS life-tenure, they also set up a series of cases for that radical court to hear. Obviously, Dobbs was the big one, but it's only part of a whole procession of trumped-up cases designed to give the court a chance to overturn decades of settled law and create zones of impunity for America's oligarchs and the monopolies that provide them with wealth and power. One of these cases is Jarkesy, a case designed to allow SCOTUS to euthanize every agency in the US government, stripping them of their powers to fight corporate crime: https://www.americanprogress.org/article/sec-v-jarkesy-the-threat-to-congressional-and-agency-authority/ The argument goes, "Congress had the power to spell out every possible problem an agency might deal with and to create a list of everything they were allowed to do about these problems. If they didn't, then the agency isn't allowed to act." This is an Objectively Very Stupid argument, and it takes a heroic act of motivated reasoning to buy it. The whole point of expert agencies is that they're experts and that they might discover new problems in American life, and come up with productive ways of fixing them. If the only way for an agency to address a problem is to wait for Congress to notice it and pass a law about it, then we don't even need agencies &#8211; Congress can just be the regulator, as well as the lawmaker. If there was any doubt that Congress created the agencies as flexible and adaptive hedges against new threats and problems, then the legislative history of the FTC Act should dispel it. Congress created the FTC through the FTCA because the courts kept misinterpreting its existing antitrust laws, like the Sherman Act. Companies would engage in the most obvious acts of naked, catastrophic fuckery, and judges would say, "Welp, because Congress didn't specifically ban this conduct, I guess it's OK." So Congress created the FTC with an Act that included a broad authority to investigate and punish "unfair methods of competition." They didn't spell these out &#8211; instead, they explicitly said (in Section 5) that it was the FTC's job to determine whether something was unfair, and to act on it: https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/10/the-courage-to-govern/#whos-in-charge The job of the FTC is to investigate unfair conduct before it becomes such a problem that Congress takes action, and to head that conduct off so that it never rises to the level of needing Congressional intervention. Now, it's true that since the Reagan years, the FTC has grown progressively less interested in using this power, but that's broadly true of all of America's corporate watchdogs. But as the public all over the world has grown ever more furious about corporate abuses and oligarchic wealth, governments everywhere have rediscovered their role as a public protector. In America, the Biden administration altered the course of history with the appointment of new enforcers in the key anti-monopoly agencies: the FTC and the DOJ's antitrust division. But more importantly, the Biden admin created a detailed, technical plan to use every agency's powers to fight monopoly, in a "whole of government" approach: https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/party-its-1979-og-antitrust-back-baby Now, this can give rise to seeming redundancies. Take labor issues. The NLRB is a (potentially) powerful regulator that had been in a coma for decades, but has awoken and taken up labor rights with a fervor and cunning that is a delight to behold: https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/06/goons-ginks-and-company-finks/#if-blood-be-the-price-of-your-cursed-wealth At the same time, the FTC has also taken up labor rights, using its much broader powers to do things like ban noncompetes nationwide, unshackling workers from bosses who claim the right to veto who else they can work for: https://pluralistic.net/2022/02/02/its-the-economy-stupid/#neofeudal But the NLRB doesn't make the FTC redundant, or vice-versa. The NLRB's role is principally reactive, punishing wrongdoing after it occurs. But the FTC has the power to intervene in incipient harms, labor abuses that have not yet risen to the level of NLRB enforcement or new acts of Congress. This case is made beautifully in Alvaro Bedoya's speech "'Overawed': Worker Misclassification as a Potential Unfair Method of Competition," delivered to the Law Leaders Global Summit in Miami today: https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/Overawed-Speech-02-02-2024.pdf Bedoya describes why the FTC has turned its attention to the problem of "worker misclassification," in which employees are falsely claimed to be contractors, and thus deprived of the rights that workers are entitled to. Worker misclassification is rampant, and it transfers billions from workers to employers every year. As Bedoya says, 10-30% of employers engage in worker misclassification, allowing them to dodge payment for overtime, Social Security, workers' comp, unemployment insurance, healthcare, retirement and even a minimum wage. Each misclassified worker is between $6k-18k poorer thanks to this scam &#8211; a typical misclassified worker sees a one third decline in their earning power. And, of course, each misclassified worker's boss is $6k-$18k richer because of this scam. It's not just wages, it's workplace safety. One of the most dangerous jobs in the country is construction worker, and worker misclassification is rampant in the sector. That means that construction workers are three times more likely than other workers to lack health insurance. What's more, misclassified workers can't form unions, because their bosses' fiction treats them as independent contractors, not employees, which means that misclassified construction workers can't join trade unions and demand health-care, or safer workplaces. Contrast this with, say, cops, who have powerful "unions" that afford them gold-plated health care and lavish compensation, even for imaginary ailments like "contact overdoses" from touching fentanyl &#8211; a medical impossibility that still entitles our nation's armed bureaucrats to handsome public compensation: https://pluralistic.net/2022/01/27/extraordinary-popular-delusions/#onshore-havana-syndrome Cops have far safer jobs than construction workers, but cops don't get misclassified, so they are able to collect benefits that no other worker &#8211; public or private &#8211; can hope for. Not every employer wants to cheat and maim their employees, of course. In Bedoya's speech, he references Sandie Domando, an executive VP at a construction company in Palm Beach Gardens. Domando's company keeps its employees on its books, giving them health-care and other benefits. But when she started bidding against rival firms for jobs funded by the covid stimulus, she couldn't compete &#8211; two thirds of those jobs went to other firms that were able to put in cheaper bids. Those bids were cheaper because they were defrauding their workers by misclassifying them. Thus, publicly funded projects were overwhelmingly handed over to fraudulent companies. Fraud becomes a fitness-factor for winning jobs. It's a market for lemons &#8211; among employers. Employee misclassification is a pure transfer from workers to bosses. Bedoya recounts the story of Samuel Talavera, Jr, a short-haul trucker who worked for decades in the Port of Los Angeles. For decades, his job paid well: enough to support his family and even take his kids to Disneyland now and again. But in 2010, his employer reclassified him as a contractor. They ordered him to buy a new truck &#8211; which they financed on a lease-purchase basis &#8211; and put him to work for 16 hours stretches in shifts lasting as much as 20 hours per day. Talavera couldn't pick his own hours or pick his routes, but he was still treated as an independent contractor for payroll and labor protection purposes. This lead to an terrible decline in Talavera's working conditions. He gave up going home between shifts, sleeping in his cab instead. His pay dropped through the floor, thanks to junk-fees that relied on the fiction that he was a contractor. For example, his boss started to charge him rent on the space his truck took up while he was standing by for a job at the port. Other truckers at the port saw paycheck deductions for the toilet-paper in the bathrooms! Talavera's take-home pay dropped so low that he was bringing home a weekly wage of $112 or $33 (one week, his pay amounted to $0.67). His wife had to work three jobs, and they still had to declare bankruptcy to avoid losing their home. When Talavera's truck needed repairs he couldn't afford, his boss fired him and took back the truck, and Talavera was out the $78,000 he'd paid into it on the lease-purchase plan. This story &#8211; and the many, many others like it from the Port of LA &#8211; paint a clear picture of the transfer of wealth from workers to their bosses that comes with worker misclassification. The work that Talavera did in the Port of LA didn't get less valuable when he was misclassified &#8211; but the share of that value that Talavera received dropped to as little as $0.67/week. Worker misclassification is rampant across many sectors, but its handmaiden is technology. The fiction of independence is much easier to maintain when the fine-grained employer-employee control is mediated by an app (think of Uber): https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/12/algorithmic-wage-discrimination/#fishers-of-men That's why those scare-stories that AI trucks were going to make truckers obsolete and create an employment crisis were such toxic nonsense. Not only are we unlikely to see self-driving trucks, but the same investors that back AI technology are making bank on companies that practice worker misclassification through the "it's not a crime if we do it with an app" gambit: https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/11/robots-stole-my-jerb/#computer-says-no By focusing our attention on a hypothetical employment crisis that will supposedly be caused by future AI developments, tech investors can distract us from the real employment crisis that's created by app-enabled worker misclassification, which is also the source of much of the capital they're plowing into AI. That's why the FTC's work on misclassification is so urgent. Misclassification is a scam that hurts workers and creates oligarchic power &#8211; and it's also a mass-extinction event for good companies that don't cheat their workers, because those honest companies can't compete. Worker misclassification is having a long-overdue and much needed moment. The revolutionary overthrow of the rotten old leadership at the Teamsters was caused, in part, by a radical wing that promised to focus the Teamsters' firepower on fighting worker misclassification: https://pluralistic.net/2021/11/19/hoffa-jr-defeated/#teamsters-for-a-democratic-union This has become a focus of labor organizers all around the world, as worker misclassification-via-smartphone has infected labor markets everywhere: https://pluralistic.net/2021/09/22/kropotkin-graeber/#an-injury-to-one Bedoya's speech is a banger, and it reminds us that labor rights and anti-monopoly have always been part of the same project: to rein in corporate power and protect workers from the insatiable greed of the capital class: https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/14/aiming-at-dollars/#not-men Hey look at this (permalink) Moral Bankruptcy https://prospect.org/justice/2024-01-31-moral-bankruptcy/ Rebecca Solnit: How to Comment on Social Media https://lithub.com/rebecca-solnit-how-to-comment-on-social-media/ KOSA isn’t designed to help kids https://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2024/01/31/kosa-isnt-designed-to-help-kids.html This day in history (permalink) #20yrsago Tablature for Super Mario Brothers https://artport.whitney.org/gatepages/artists/galloway/ #20yrsago Unix as she is spoke https://web.archive.org/web/20040215071845/http://www.eeng.brad.ac.uk/help/.faq/.unix/.pronun.html #15yrsago Comprehensive excoriation of ebook stupidity https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2009/02/the-once-and-future-e-book/ #15yrsago Disneyland Paris’s smoking area/stroller rental https://www.flickr.com/photos/doctorow/3246021936/ #15yrsago UK to introduce “photograph a cop, 10 years in jail” law https://web.archive.org/web/20090204092654/http://www.bjp-online.com/public/showPage.html?page=836675 #15yrsago Does the Medieval Warm Period mean that climate change isn’t real, dangerous and caused by humans?

## In Rare Intervention, US Urges Britain to 'Reassess' Cuts to Armed Forces

date: 2024-02-02, from: VOA News USA

London — Britain's readiness and ability to fight a major conflict is under the spotlight after senior military officials at home and abroad questioned cuts to the country's armed forces at a time of heightened global threats.


In a rare intervention, a senior United States official urged its ally Britain to reassess the size of its armed forces. The remarks, by U.S. Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro, echo concerns of senior military commanders in Britain.


"I think it is important for the United Kingdom to reassess where they are today given the threats that exist today," Del Toro told an audience at London's Royal United Services Institute January 25, adding that Britain had to make a "decision around whether the army needs to be strengthened."




He also spoke of his "tremendous respect" for the UK's armed forces and praised the joint efforts between Britain and the U.S. in Operation Prosperity Guardian, a multinational force targeting Houthi rebels in Yemen to safeguard commercial shipping in the Red Sea.


Britain's government defended its spending on the armed forces. A spokesperson for the British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said in a statement following Del Toro's remarks: "The UK is the second biggest defense spender in NATO and the largest in Europe. The Navy, Army and Royal Air Force are all playing an active global role, operating across every ocean and continent. Our military strength is also why we are the U.S.'s partner of choice in taking action to defend against the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea."


Meanwhile, some 20,000 British troops are set to take part in Exercise Steadfast Defender 2024 — NATO's biggest drills since the Cold War. British Defense Secretary Grant Shapps highlighted Britain's contribution in a speech last month.


"It will see our military joining forces with counterparts from 30 NATO countries — plus Sweden — providing reassurance against the Putin menace. Our carrier strike group will be out in full force, with our magnificent flagship HMS Queen Elizabeth leading the way, and flying from her decks will be the fifth generation F-35 Lightning jets," Shapps said.




Behind that veneer, however, critics argue Britain's armed forces are underfunded, underequipped and facing a recruitment crisis.


General Patrick Sanders, the outgoing head of the British army, warned recently that more needs to be done to equip and modernize the country's armed forces in the face of the threat from Russia. Britain has about 73,000 soldiers — half the size it was 30 years ago. Sanders said Britain may need to train a "civilian army" in the event of a major war.


"Although there's a lot of rhetoric from British defense ministers and senior officials that numbers aren't everything, numbers are pretty important," said Brigadier (Retired) Ben Barry, senior fellow for land warfare at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London.


"For example, a tank or a frigate or an F-35 can't be in two places at once. It's also fair to say that the British armed forces have a broad range of capabilities, which I think the U.S. welcomes, but many of those are themselves very small. For example, the British army can only produce a single division. The French army can produce two, the German army can produce three," Barry told VOA.


The British army, navy and air force have all missed recruitment targets, according to government figures, with navy recruitment down by 22 percent in the 12 months to March 2023, compared with the previous year.


Two British naval frigates, the HMS Westminster and the HMS Argyll, are set to be decommissioned this year owing to a lack of crew able to operate them, reducing the total to nine, according to a report by London's The Daily Telegraph.




The government did not comment on the newspaper report but highlighted that it has ordered eight new frigates — although these won't be in service until at least the end of the decade.


Meanwhile, there are shortages of equipment across the armed forces, according to Barry, of the International Institute for Strategic Studies.


"All three armed forces don't have sufficient stockpiles of ammunition and spare parts to conduct a sustained battle for the length of time that NATO envisages, and that NATO requires them to do," Barry said.


"What we've seen over the last couple of years is the relative hollowing out of Europe's armed forces, very publicly displayed with the well-reported difficulties of supplying enough equipment — weapons and ammunition — for Ukraine," he said.


The British government has pledged to spend 2.5 percent of GDP on defense by 2030 and said it was committed to spending more "when conditions allow."


Barry said the British military was still effective.


"One key ingredient is actually that they are willing to fight. And I think it's fair to say the British armed forces still retain an ethos of combat in their DNA. And the British public, politicians and the media all see the use of force against the country's enemies, in extremis [in highly difficult circumstances], as what the armed forces are for. That's not true in all European or Western countries," he told VOA.

## US Employers Added Surprisingly Robust 353,000 Jobs In January

date: 2024-02-02, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The nation's employers delivered a stunning burst of hiring to begin 2024, adding 353,000 jobs in January in the latest sign of the economy's continuing ability to shrug off the highest interest rates in two decades.


Friday's government report showed that last month's job gain — far above what economists had predicted — topped the December gain of 333,000, a figure that was itself revised sharply higher. The unemployment rate stayed at 3.7%, just above a half-century low.


Wages rose unexpectedly fast in January, too. Average hourly pay climbed a sharp 0.6% from December, the fastest monthly gain in nearly two years, and 4.5% from January 2023. The strong hiring and wage growth could complicate or delay the Federal Reserve's intention to start cutting interest rates later this year.


The latest gains showcased employers' willingness to keep hiring to meet steady consumer spending. It comes as the intensifying presidential campaign is pivoting in no small part on views of President Joe Biden's economic stewardship. Public polls show widespread dissatisfaction largely because even though inflation has sharply slowed, most prices remain well above pre-pandemic levels. Some recent surveys, though, show public approval gradually improving.




This week, the Fed took note of the economy's durability, with Chair Jerome Powell saying "the economy is performing well, the labor market remains strong." The central bank made clear that while it's nearing a long-awaited shift toward cutting interest rates, it's in no hurry to do so.


The details in Friday's jobs report pointed to broad hiring gains across the economy. Professional and business services, a category that includes managers and technical workers, added 74,000 jobs. Healthcare companies added 70,000, retailers 45,000, governments at all levels 36,000 and manufacturers 23,000.


The unemployment rate has now come in below 4% for two straight years, the longest such streak since the 1960s.


"Overall, the labor market remains strong and continues to defy expectations of a softening,'' said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics. "For Fed officials, these data strongly support patience on rate cuts. Policymakers will be in no rush to lower rates if job and wage growth continue to be robust over coming months.''


To fight inflation, the Fed raised its benchmark rate 11 times beginning in March 2022. The higher borrowing costs were widely expected to boost unemployment and likely cause a recession. Yet the economy has managed to deliver enough job growth to avoid a downturn without accelerating inflation pressures. Inflation cooled throughout 2023, making it likelier that the Fed would achieve a "soft landing" — taming inflation without derailing the economy.


A series of high-profile layoff announcements, from the likes of UPS, Google and Amazon, have raised some concerns about whether they might herald the start of a wave of job cuts. Yet measured against the nation's vast labor force, the recent layoffs haven't been significant enough to make a dent in the overall job market. Historically speaking, layoffs are still relatively low, hiring is still solid and the unemployment rate is still consistent with a healthy economy.


Consumers as a whole have proved more resilient than expected in the face of the Fed's rate hikes. Having socked away savings during the pandemic, most were willing to spend it as the economy reopened. And a wave of early retirements, some of them related to COVID-19, limited the number of people available for work and contributed to a tight labor market.


The gradual improvement in public confidence has emerged in a series of recent surveys. A measure of consumer sentiment by the University of Michigan has jumped in the past two months by the most since 1991. A survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York found that Americans' inflation expectations have reached their lowest point in nearly three years. And a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that 35% of U.S. adults call the national economy good, up from 30% who said so late last year.


The rate at which Americans are quitting their jobs, considered a reliable predictor of wage trends, has slowed to pre-pandemic levels. That suggests that workers have grown somewhat less confident of finding a better job elsewhere. Employers, as a result, may be less likely to feel pressure to raise wages to keep them — and to increase their prices to make up for their higher labor costs. That cycle can perpetuate inflation.

## Volvo and Polestar Break Up

date: 2024-02-02, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDM0MDAwMC9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2ODQzODE2Nn0.7qLtGHwtvJDuHPOt-W4Ue-pqu3d_1ggV3S7sxzg1utg/image.png?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C1%2C0%2C1"/><br/><br/><p>
<em><strong>Current conditions:</strong> <em>“The largest storm of the season” is scheduled to make landfall tomorrow in California, which is fresh off one storm that dumped water across the state.</em> <em>The Spanish region of Catalonia has declared a state of emergency over its worst drought on record. Residents are protesting unprecedented water shortages in Mexico City, which is struggling after years of little rain.</em></em>
</p><h2>
THE TOP FIVE
</h2><h3>
1. Volvo splits with Polestar
</h3><p>
	Yesterday, Swedish automaker Volvo announced it is pulling funding from Polestar, its EV arm, which has struggled to gain a foothold in the market. As Jennifer Mossalgue <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/02/01/volvo-breaks-up-with-polestar-and-sees-its-stock-soar/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reports</a> in <em>Electrek</em>, Polestar is bleeding cash — it announced plans to cut 15% of its workforce last week, and needs a billion-dollar cash infusion over the next year to stay in business. Polestar will instead become the purview of Volvo parent company Geely, owned by Chinese billionaire Li Shufu.
</p><h3>
2. Tesla settles lawsuit over water pollution</h3><p>
	Yesterday, a judge in California's San Joaquin County <a href="https://sfdistrictattorney.org/press-release/tesla-inc-settles-environmental-enforcement-action-brought-by-california-district-attorneys/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ordered</a> Tesla to pay $1.5 million to settle a lawsuit brought by more than two dozen counties, including Los Angeles and San Francisco, for mislabeling hazardous waste and sending it to landfills that could not accept the particular substances, including “paint materials, brake fluids, used batteries, antifreeze and diesel fuel.” The lawsuit alleged that at least 101 facilities violated California’s waste management laws, including the factory in Fremont. The electric vehicle-maker has had multiple previous tangles with the Environmental Protection Agency over pollution from its factories.
</p><p>
	“While electric vehicles may benefit the environment, the manufacturing and servicing of these vehicles still generates many harmful waste streams,” said San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins in a press release. “Today’s settlement against Tesla, Inc. serves to provide a cleaner environment for citizens throughout the state by preventing the contamination of our precious natural resources when hazardous waste is mismanaged and unlawfully disposed.”
</p><h3>
3. Democrats take on AI’s environmental impact

</p></center><p>
	A group of Democratic lawmakers, led by Massachusetts Senator Ed Markey, introduced a <a href="https://www.markey.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/artificial_intelligence_environmental_impacts_act_of_2024_-_020124pdf.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bill</a> that would direct the EPA to study the environmental impacts of artificial intelligence. It also asks the National Institute of Standards and Technology to set up a system to both measure and voluntarily report those impacts. AI, like <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/bitcoin-crypto-electricity-consumption" target="_self">crypto mining</a>, is energy-intensive, but it’s difficult to tell just how that energy use impacts the environment without any measurement or reporting mechanism in place.

4. Rooftop solar’s woes continue
</h3><p>
	Earlier this week the software company Aurora Solar laid off 20% of its 500-person staff, about a year after it raised $200 million in a Series D round.
</p><p>
	“Like many other companies in the solar industry, we’ve felt the effects of larger macroeconomic challenges, including higher interest rates and the impact of NEM 3.0 in California,” Aurora Solar <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/30/aurora-solar-layoffs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> Tim De Chant at <em>TechCrunch</em>.
</p><p>
	NEM 3.0 is California’s latest iteration of a net metering regulation. Under the new structure, which came into effect in April of last year, compensation rates for solar customers in the state dropped by about 75%, which means rooftop solar is no longer the steal deal it once was.
</p><p>
	The news is the latest in a series of signs that the rooftop solar industry is in a tough spot at the moment — as Alana Semuels <a href="https://time.com/6565415/rooftop-solar-industry-collapse/https://time.com/6565415/rooftop-solar-industry-collapse/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> in <em>Time</em> last week, more than 100 residential solar-related companies declared bankruptcy in 2023 alone.
</p><center></center><h3>
5. Otters are inadvertent erosion fighters
</h3><p>
	Sea otters are playing a crucial role in stopping estuaries in California from eroding away, according to a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00217-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">delightfully-titled</a> article in <em>Nature</em>. After conservation efforts succeeded in helping sea otter populations in the state rebound from the brink of extinction, researchers found that the animals were inadvertently stopping salt marshes like Monterey Bay’s Elkhorn Slough from washing away by eating the crabs that were picking at vegetation that keeps the sandy banks of the marsh together. Erosion in the areas where otters returned slowed from 30 centimeters a year to 10 centimeters a year.
</p><p>
	“It’s remarkable when you think about it,” Jane Watson, a community ecologist at Vancouver Island University in Nanaimo, Canada, told <em>Nature’s </em>Jude Coleman. “You can have a single animal, the sea otter, come in and through predation actually mitigate the effects of erosion.”
</p><h2>
THE KICKER
</h2><p>
	It’s cloudy with a chance of flurries in Punxsutawney, PA, where the eponymous rodent is scheduled to make his prediction for Groundhog Day, and <em>The</em> <em>Washington Post</em>’s Kasha Patel has a story about it <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/02/01/groundhog-day-prediction-spring-winter/" target="_blank">told entirely in verse.</a> Punxsutawney Phil, Patel notes, has a bit of competition these days:
</p><p>
	“The National Weather Service issues seasonal outlooks based on computer models and science. They do not have a groundhog for reliance.”

## Why so many companies are incorporated in Delaware

date: 2024-02-02, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>Elon Musk is considering reincorporating Tesla in Texas after a court in Delaware, where Tesla is currently incorporated, voided his $56 billion compensation package. But roughly two-thirds of Fortune 500 are incorporated in the First State. We&#8217;ll examine why. Plus, Apple and Amazon are doing just fine, as reported in their latest earnings. And how can nature be a measurable part of our economy? The Biden administration seeks to find out.</p>

## A Self-Enforcing Protocol to Solve Gerrymandering

date: 2024-02-02, updated: 2024-01-26, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>In 2009, <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2009/08/self-enforcing.html">I wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>There are several ways two people can divide a piece of cake in half. One way is to find someone impartial to do it for them. This works, but it requires another person. Another way is for one person to divide the piece, and the other person to complain (to the police, a judge, or his parents) if he doesn&#8217;t think it’s fair. This also works, but still requires another person&#8212;­at least to resolve disputes. A third way is for one person to do the dividing, and for the other person to choose the half he wants.</p></blockquote>
<p>The point is that unlike protocols that require a neutral third party to complete (arbitrated), or protocols that require that neutral third party to resolve disputes (adjudicated), self-enforcing protocols just work. Cut-and-choose works because neither side can cheat. And while the math can get really complicated, the idea ...</p>

<div class="a"><p>This is Winnie, and I’m from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore">Singapore</a> where I’ve spent most of my life except a few years when I worked in San Francisco. I was a self-taught designer in both print and digital from 2000-2016 before I had to quit due to chronic migraines and photosensitivity.</p>
<p>I don’t have any hobbies per se in the sense of things I enjoy doing because I seem to <a href="https://winnielim.org/journal/my-mind-the-invisible-loudspeaker/">lack the ability to feel pleasure</a>, but I do a variety of things that enrich me: reading, exercise, photography, learning, and I am trying to pick up drawing. Perhaps one day I would like to learn how to play the keyboard. </p>
<p>I try to publish at least once a week, mostly documenting my life and struggles with both my health and existence.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>What&#039;s the story behind your blog?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>I got really into learning how to make websites when I had my first computer at 15 all the way back in 1996. So my first website was on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoCities">Geocities</a>. It felt like a natural progression to start blogging when I saw other people start doing it in the late 90s. My first blog was on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greymatter_(software)">Greymatter</a> on a now defunct domain. I would just post links to websites I liked and perhaps some emo poetry. A while later my friend introduced me to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LiveJournal">Livejournal</a>, which is interesting to me till this day because the inherent culture and dynamics of it encouraged people to pour out their feelings on it. I don’t know if I am rewriting my own history but I feel like Livejournal was instrumental in the process in setting the tone of my writing till today. It gave me the idea that writing my feelings out to some invisible audience could be somewhat therapeutic. One thing that is now permanently gone from the Livejournal era is the ability to easily follow and like your friend’s blog, and publish only to your network of friends. I hope something like this can exist on federated systems one day. </p>
<p>Sadly Livejournal got sold, and I moved to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vox_(blogging_platform)">Vox</a>, which also got sold, then to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterous">Posterous</a> – well you get the idea. I finally bought the domain winnielim.org sometime in 2012 and set up my blog there. I had loved the network effects and community of early twitter, so when Medium came along I got a job there, hence publishing exclusively there for a while, continued even after I left the job but stopped when it started putting up paywalls. My personal lived history of the internet has taught me it is really important to have our own domain. It is not just about the ownership of content but it is sad when urls go dead.</p>
<p>I felt very alienated and lonely as a young person in the 1990s. It was incredible to discover the internet and know there is an entire world out there, that there are actually many people living diverse lives that were not visible or encouraged in Singapore. Reading people’s vulnerable and honest writing on their blogs made me feel like I was not alone. So I try to pay it forward by doing the same with my writing.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>What does your creative process look like when it comes to blogging?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>Since 2013 I mostly just turn up every Sunday, and start writing. Half the time I have no idea what I’m writing about till I finish writing it. The other times I have an idea but it becomes something else entirely in the writing process. They call it intuitive writing I guess. Once in a long while I write <a href="https://winnielim.org/book-reviews/">book reviews</a> or essays to share something in a more structured way. Those take considerable focus and multiple-sittings, so I don’t do it very often.</p>
<p>I do publish more frequently than weekly if I get inspired or if circumstances encourage it, like my recent trip to Japan where I tried to <a href="https://winnielim.org/tag/japan2023/">travel blog during the trip</a>. </p>
<p>I’ve tried writing “proper” pieces before where there is a ton of editing and proofreading by other people, but I didn’t enjoy the process. It made me feel disconnected from the writing. Some of these pieces did very well, which made me realise that being able to write however I want is more important than views.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe the physical space influences your creativity?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>I do believe that physical space influences creativity. I constantly feel inspired in a place like Japan, where the culture itself has aesthetic and creative elements. But I also believe it is important to cultivate a capacity to be creative anywhere, because sometimes in life we get caught in circumstances and environments that are not ideal. </p>
<p>I try to keep my entire home a creative environment. It is not one of those beautiful minimalistic environments like you see in youtube videos. It is more like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zakka">zakka style</a>, where it contains things that feel creative to me: lots of (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/launshae">my partner</a>’s) artwork hung up on the walls, tons of books, art materials and tools, a warm and cosy space that feels psychologically safe. A lot of it is thanks to my partner who is an artist and an efficient organiser.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your tech stack?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>I use <a href="https://opalstack.com/">Opalstack</a> as my webhost, they offer VPS-like hosting but managed. I chose them because I used to use Webfaction, which got sold. For a few years in between I hosted my website on a droplet at Digital Ocean, but I decided managing my own server is too tedious. </p>
<p>Like many others I use <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">Namecheap</a> for my domains. It was highly recommended in the 2000s, so I used it and stuck with it since I have no issues with it so far.</p>
<p>For the beginning few years my blog in its current incarnation was on Jekyll, but it is now on Wordpress because I want to be able to dynamically query it like <a href="https://winnielim.org/experiments/website/this-website-as-a-learning-and-reflection-tool/">I am querying my second brain</a>. I also use a plugin called <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/pods/">Pods</a> that allows me to create custom post types and surface relationships between them easily. Everything is connected, and I want to demonstrate and understand these connections. A blog post is not just a piece of writing to me. It is a piece of my self, and these pieces track the process of my becoming. Sometimes <a href="https://winnielim.org/journal/remembering-forgotten-lessons-and-selves/">I forget and I get lost</a>, so these pieces and connections help to <a href="https://winnielim.org/journal/returning-to-ones-core/">bring me back</a> to who I am and who I aspired to be. These are not things that a static website can do, so I stay with Wordpress despite its obvious issues.</p>
<p>It is also important to use something that has proven stability and longevity.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would you do anything differently?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>I would host my own website using the same domain right from the start. But given the highly-ephemeral and experimental nature of the web back then, I think it would have been challenging not to hop on new technologies and platforms, especially because I have an experimental nature. But I am envious of blogs who ignored all of those things and persistently stayed on their own domain or even on Blogger. It is such a magnificent thing to see an archive that spans decades because on the internet we create and destroy content like it doesn’t matter since it is so easy to do so. Witnessing some permanence is beautiful when everything is so transient.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>Financial question since the web is obsessed with money: how much does it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost or does it generate some revenue? And what&#039;s your position on people monetising personal blogs?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>For now Opalstack is $115 a year, and it costs $15 to renew my domain. These costs increase every now and then. So roughly it is about $11 a month, which is about 2 cups of coffee. </p>
<p>When I first quit my job I tried to use Patreon to gather monetary support, not so much for my writing but for my interactive experiments. However along with my chronic illness, that experience made me realise I don’t have the personality required for this. I am too afraid of rejection, and it also makes me deeply uncomfortable to the point of being perpetually anxious when people <em>do</em> support me. It felt stressful to try to upkeep something to some invisible expectations, and during times when I fell sick and was unable to work on my projects I felt like I was letting people down. </p>
<p>I do understand when people monetise blogs, but I hope it can be a model where some people are supporting the content financially in order for everybody else to read it free. This is because there is already deep inequality in this world, and putting content behind pay walls is exacerbating that inequality. </p>
<p>Having freely accessible information on the internet during the 90s impacted my life so deeply, a major contributor to my career. I know it changed so many people’s lives, and lifted people out of their poor living circumstances. However I understand that it is the only source of income for some people and paywalls are the only way to go for them. I am encouraged by examples of people who are successful with the some-supporters-pay-for-the-rest model though, like <a href="https://kottke.org/members/">kottke.org</a>.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth checking out? And also, who do you think I should be interviewing next?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>I love a ton of blogs – I have hundreds of blogs on my rss reader – so it is difficult to pick a few, but if I really have to:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://brainbaking.com/">Brain Baking</a>: Wouter writes widely and deeply, a quality I really appreciate on the internet.</li>
<li><a href="https://ruk.ca/">Peter Rukavina</a>: classic example of blogging that is rare these days – frequent, slice of life updates. </li>
<li><a href="https://popagandhi.com/">Popagandhi</a>: Adrianna has been a huge inspiration for me because she has been writing transparently and vulnerably since the early 2000s. She was writing about lgbtq when it was still considered taboo (at least in Singapore), and till today continues to write on some potentially divisive topics. <a href="https://popagandhi.com/2005/01/the-eight-ages-of-a-woman/">Some of her early writing</a> has this heartbreaking poetic quality. </li>
<li><a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/pb-eli-mellen">another</a> vote for <a href="https://maya.land/">maya.land</a>: I’ve not seen a range of topics like this anywhere else.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also love <a href="https://blogroll.org/">blogroll.org</a> for always recommending new interesting blogs to follow. I think Wouter of Brain Baking would be a great interview subject.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>Final question: is there anything you want to share with us?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>The longevity of websites is something I still think about. I often wonder <a href="https://winnielim.org/journal/on-writing-to-exist-and-website-graveyards/">what would happen to my website</a> after I pass on. I know of at least <a href="https://www.sheldonbrown.com/">one great website</a> that is being maintained by family and friends after the owner passed on, but what would happen when they too are no longer around? There is this attitude that websites are ephemeral and not important, but there is a lot of richness, history and information within them that deserves to be preserved. It would be sad that we didn’t try hard enough to keep them. I know there is the <a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a> that is doing great work, but I wish there was an option to keep a website in its entirety. Wordpress has recently launched <a href="https://wordpress.com/blog/2023/08/25/introducing-the-100-year-plan/">a 100-year plan</a>, but it is only for wordpress.com users and it costs 38k. I wish there are more viable solutions out there.</p>
<p>Finally, I hope people will not be afraid to pick up new skills, hobbies or any learnings at any age. I recently started to <a href="https://wynlimdraws.tumblr.com/">learn how to draw</a>, and I think being unafraid of <a href="https://winnielim.org/journal/daring-to-be-ugly/">“being ugly”</a> or failure goes a long way. I see too many people not pursue art/skills/hobbies because it is “too late”, “no talent”, or if they do they give up because they cannot tolerate not living up to their internal standards. But we can relish the process of doing things without being great at it. For me, it is also an act of rebellion towards an utilitarian world.</p></div>

## Class Notes: Enchiridion

date: 2024-02-02, from: Ayjay blog

Second in a series of reflections on what I’m teaching.  Late in his life, Augustine wrote his Enchiridion in response to a request from someone named Laurentius. What Laurentius wanted was a handy summary of Christian teaching that he could “always keep beside” him, to have ready when questions arose. He also wanted the handbook [&#8230;]

## UK Court Throws Out Trump's 'Steele Dossier' Lawsuit

date: 2024-02-02, from: VOA News USA

London — London's High Court on Thursday threw out Donald Trump's lawsuit against a British private investigations firm over the "Steele dossier" which alleged ties between Trump's election campaign and Russia.


Trump, the frontrunner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, had brought a data protection lawsuit against Orbis Business Intelligence about claims in a dossier written by its co-founder, former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele.


Judge Karen Steyn ruled that the former U.S. president's case could not continue, saying in a written ruling that "there are no compelling reasons to allow the claim to proceed."


Trump said in a witness statement made public in October that he brought the case to prove claims in the so-called Steele dossier, published by the BuzzFeed website in 2017, that he engaged in "perverted sexual acts" in Russia, were false.


Many of the allegations were never substantiated and lawyers for Trump, 77, said that the report was "egregiously inaccurate" and contained "numerous false, phony or made-up allegations."


Steyn noted that Trump said the allegations were untrue, adding: "I have not considered, or made any determination, as to the accuracy or inaccuracy of the (allegations)."


Orbis argued that Trump brought the claim simply to address his "longstanding grievances" against the company and Steele.


Steyn said in her ruling that she did not need to decide that because Trump had "no reasonable grounds for bringing a claim for compensation or damages."


The London lawsuit is one of many legal cases involving Trump, who faces four separate criminal prosecutions in the United States.


Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung said in a statement: "President Trump will continue to fight for the truth and against falsehoods such as ones promulgated by Steele and his cohorts."

## Hostages Rescued, Armed Man Detained at P&G Factory in Turkey

date: 2024-02-02, from: VOA News USA

ANKARA — Police detained an armed man who took staff hostage at a Procter & Gamble factory in northwestern Turkey on Thursday and rescued seven hostages, ending a protest against Israel's military campaign in Gaza, the local governor's office said.


The Kocaeli governor's office said that the hostages were unharmed, adding that the operation to rescue them was launched after negotiations with the hostage-taker failed.


"Our security forces intervened and neutralized the suspect," the statement said, adding that he was an employee of the factory who "wanted to draw attention to the ongoing occupation in Gaza."


P&G thanked the authorities for their handling of the crisis.


"The fact that no one was harmed is our greatest relief. We are grateful to the authorities and first responders who managed the situation with courage and professionalism," the company said in a statement.


"Our efforts to support those employees most directly impacted, their families and the entire P&G community are ongoing." 


The hostage-taker entered the factory in Gebze industrial zone in Kocaeli province around 3 p.m. (1200 GMT), the Demiroren news agency said earlier, adding that police had then rushed to the scene and sought to persuade him to give himself up. 


The hostages were six men and a woman, media reports had said. 


A photo released by local media earlier showed a man inside the factory whose face was covered with a Palestinian scarf and who was wearing what looked possibly like an explosive device. 


Another photo from the scene showed the man holding a gun in one hand and making a 'V' sign with his other hand in front of a wall on which Turkish and Palestinian flags were painted with a script that reads: "Gates will open. Either coffin rest or death for Gaza."

## Highly-condensed time-lapse footage with Frigate

<p>I'm a little bit <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/search?search_api_fulltext=timelapse">nutty about timelapses</a>, and have made them with dashcams, GoPros, full DSLRs, webcams, and <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/pi-timelapse">even Raspberry Pi</a>.</p>

<p>But one thing I <em>haven't</em> done (until now) is make easy timelapses from IP cameras like the <a href="https://amzn.to/3HPGcdT">Annke 4K PoE cameras</a> I use for security around my house.</p>

<p>Eventually I'm planning on automating things further, but for now, here's my process for building up a timelapse that's relatively small in file size, preserving only frames where there's motion from frame to frame.</p>

<p>For something like clouds/sky, or natural environments, it's better to do a straight timelapse export and maybe recompress it if you want, but for indoor or outdoor security footage, it's nice to condense it down.</p></div>

## Western Analysts Warn of Russia's, China's Influence in Western Balkans

date: 2024-02-02, from: VOA News USA

washington — With Russia and China increasingly aligned, Western policymakers and analysts are sounding the alarm over their influence in the Western Balkans. With so much focus on the wars in the Middle East and Ukraine, they warn that the Western Balkans should not be ignored. 


U.S. Representative Pete Sessions told VOA on Wednesday that Russia has been a part "of destabilizing the Balkans for a number of years," and that it has demonstrated it uses misinformation and military force to fulfill its objectives. 


"Destabilizing the Balkans is something that each of the countries there see," he said. "And they see these not only happening, but they see whether it's a deliberate attempt to undermine these nations."  


Sessions said the United States needs to stand behind these nations and "work within established parameters, the EU, NATO and other organizations. ... The United States needs to be front and center to say, 'We support this, and we will stick together.' That is what these nations need. The United States of America standing strong with them individually and as a group." 


'Part of Putin's strategy' 


Edward P. Joseph, a Balkans analyst at Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies, agrees.  


"The Balkans are part of Putin's strategy. He wants to divide Europe from the United States, and he wants to divide Europe within itself. And the Balkans are a prime avenue for him to do that," he told VOA on Wednesday.  


Sessions and Joseph participated this week in an annual security forum in Congress focused on this issue and held around the time of the National Prayer Breakfast. They were joined by politicians and lawmakers from Europe and the Western Balkans, a region of six countries including Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Kosovo, North Macedonia and Serbia.  


Analysts say Moscow uses political interference and disinformation that it deploys through its historically close ties with Serbia and other friendly actors in the region.  


"Russia is active with its operations in the Balkans at very low cost," Joseph said. He cited as an example Serbia hosting the Russian media outlets Russia Today and Sputnik. 


"These are platforms that are giving pro-Russian narratives around the region," he said. "And that's only one of the ways that Serbia affects, in a negative way, advancing Russian agenda."  


Focus on integration 


During the security forum, Naz Durakoglu, assistant secretary of state for legislative affairs, said the U.S. is very concerned about the influence of China and Russia in the region and works in a variety of ways to strengthen democracy in those countries. These include foreign aid, a focus on the fight against corruption and promotion of reforms "to help integrate Western Balkan countries into the EU and with each other." 


Albania is a NATO member and works closely with the United States. Its former defense minister, Fatmir Mediu, is one of the organizers of the security forum. 


"The way that forces such as Russia and China act is, first they try to ignite new conflicts," he told VOA. "The second is to create a kind of status quo regarding certain situations and unresolved problems to prevent membership in the European Union and NATO and expand their geoeconomic and geopolitical influence." 


China Belt and Road 


Durakoglu said that while Russia exerts its influence through gas and disinformation, China furthers its interests mostly through economic and infrastructure investments. 


Valbona Zeneli, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, has written extensively about the Chinese and Russian influence in the Western Balkans. 


"The Western Balkans has seen a significant expansion of Chinese influence over the last decade, in line with Beijing's geo-economic and diplomatic vision of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), and in the broader strategic context of China-EU relations," she wrote in recent research paper. She is also working on a book on the topic.  


"The geo-strategic position of the Western Balkans is perfect as a bridgehead to EU markets and a key transit corridor for the Chinese BRI. Chinese interests in the region are strongly related to infrastructure projects and privatization opportunities, where demand for preferential lending is high and acquisition prices are low," she said. 


'We hold the cards'


As Russia and China align their positions in opposition to the West, experts say they want to divert attention from the major world conflicts, such as Ukraine, Middle East and China's increasingly hostile posture in South China Sea.


To Albania's Mediu, it is clear that "there is a move by Russia but also by China, maybe also by Iran to create problems in the Balkan region, to have another point of conflict and to shift attention from Ukraine."  


In countering this influence, the U.S. is supporting allies in the region. The Pentagon has confirmed last month's approval by the United States of the potential sale of Javelin anti-tank missiles to Kosovo for an estimated $75 million.  


"This proposed sale will support the foreign policy goals and national security of the United States by improving the security of a European partner which is an important force for political and economic stability in Europe," the Pentagon said. 


It added that the sale "will improve Kosovo's long-term defense capacity to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity to meet its national defense requirements." 


Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic expressed "deep disappointment" at the decision. Russia also "strongly condemned" the plans. 


The proposed sale comes during tensions between Kosovo and Serbia that the EU is seeking to resolve. In its continued rejection of its former province's independence, Serbia has had the firm support of Russia and China. 


With all the concern over Russia's and China's forays in the region, Joseph of Johns Hopkins University said the good news is the West holds the cards.  


"This is not like Ukraine. Russia is too far to bring in land forces. The NATO members surround the Balkans. All the countries in the region except Serbia want to join NATO. And some are already members of NATO," he said.


The European Union, he said, "is by far the main trading partner. So, we hold the cards. We have to use them correctly."

## Redox gets more Linux utilities, changes resource path format, and more

date: 2024-02-02, from: OS News

The Redox project has published an overview of the progress made in January, and it&#8217;s a long list. Redox now supports the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+, a few of System76&#8217;s Cosmic Desktop applications now run on Redox, several more Linux applications haven been ported (most notably for me, nano, my CLI text editor of choice), and much more. The most important change is an overhaul of how Redox handles resource paths: Redox has a microkernel core, with drivers and other resource providers running as tasks and providing “schemes”. A scheme is the name of a resource provider, and until now, resources have been accessed using URI/URL format. For example, files would be accessed as file:path/to/my_file, and a TCP connection would be accessed as tcp:127.0.0.1. This format, while forward-looking, has not been very backwards-compatible. In order to simplify our efforts to port Linux software to Redox, we have decided to change our resource path format to the Linux-compatible /scheme/scheme_name/path/to/resource. Paths that do not begin with /scheme will be assumed to refer to the file scheme, so /path/to/my_file is treated by the system as /scheme/file/path/to/my_file, but the application will only see the /path/to/my_file portion. Using this format, normal paths now look just like Linux paths, while drivers and other resources can still be addressed without breaking software. ↫ Ron Williams The change is an ongoing process, so you might encounter some issues related to it in the coming time.

## Bootable Windows on ReFS still not ready for prime time due to lack of wider compatibility

date: 2024-02-02, from: OS News

That was back in August and since then, there has not been anything too noteworthy in terms of Windows bootability support on ReFS. Meanwhile, Microsoft has also not updated the officially supported ReFS version up from 3.10 yet, and as such, trying to run Windows on any newer ReFS version leads to an immediate crash on the newest Canary build 26040. Apparently, the crash is worse than it was on previous builds as it now throws up no recovery messages either. ↫ Sayan Sen at NeoWin It seems like NTFS will be with us for quite a while longer.

## ReactOS details its new graphical installer

date: 2024-02-01, from: OS News

The ReactOS project is working on a new graphical installer to replace the older, text-mode one. In the first blog post about this effort, from December 2023, developer hbelusca details their work on setupapi, the module that enables &#8220;reading and processing INF files, moving/copying files from an installation source media to a target, supporting also extraction from compressed .CAB cabinet files&#8221;, as well as device installation functions. The second post dives into partitioning during installation, which involves a lot of very delicate work, from partitioning to installing the bootloader, and from copying files to modifying the registry. On top of that, this needs a GUI, and preferably one that&#8217;s better and more versatile than the well-known blue text-mode setup we all know from old versions of Windows. The new GUI presents more options, allows for bootloader settings, and, of course, partitioning in a non-destructive way before committing. In addition, while the blue text-mode setup can only go forward, the new GUI is bidirectional. The third and final post dives into testing all this work and fixing bugs. The post goes into great detail describing a number of bugs and their fixes, and is well worth a read, too.

## US Hurricane Center's Forecasts to Expand to Include Inland Areas

date: 2024-02-01, from: VOA News USA

ST. PETERSBURG, Florida — The "cone of uncertainty" produced by the National Hurricane Center to forecast the location and ferocity of a tropical storm is getting an update this year to include predictions for inland areas, where wind and flooding are sometimes more treacherous than damage to the coasts. 


The Miami-based hurricane center said Thursday on the X social media platform that the new, experimental forecast tool will be ready around August 15, just before the traditional peak of the hurricane season that begins June 1. 


"This experimental graphic will help better convey wind hazard risk inland in addition to coastal wind hazards," the center said in the post. 


The traditional cone in use for years generally shows the forecast track of a hurricane or tropical storm but is focused on wind and storm surge along the coasts — and forecasters always warn not to focus on the center line alone. Heavy rains and strong winds can be deadly and cause significant damage inland, which happened in 2022 with Hurricane Ian, when 149 people died in Florida. 


The goal of the expanded forecast cone is to make sure people who don't live along a coast are aware of the dangers they could still face, said Jamie Rhome, deputy director of the hurricane center. The new cone features colors to show which places face threats in a much broader way than before. If someone lives in one of those areas, "you are under risk," Rhome said. 


There's growing evidence that the impacts of climate change — such as rising sea levels — are making the most severe hurricanes even more intense and increasing the likelihood that a developing hurricane will rapidly intensify and lead to more flooding and more powerful storm surges battering coastlines, experts say. 


After Ian blasted across the Fort Myers, Florida, area — where the most people died and the worst damage was caused — the storm kept dumping rain and toppling trees across a wide swath of the state of Florida. Floods were reported around Orlando and its theme parks, south to Kissimmee, east to Daytona Beach, and in central Florida's cattle and citrus country. 


Ian produced between 10 and 20 inches (51 centimeters) of rain across much of central Florida, the hurricane center reported. 


People near rivers were deeply and possibly unexpectedly affected. After Ian slogged through inland DeSoto County and the Peace River flooded the community, Fire Chief Chad Jorgensen urged residents to flee, saying the river was unpredictable and dangerous. 


The first named storm of 2024 will be Alberto. The 2023 season saw 20 named storms, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, including seven hurricanes.

## Windows 11 is getting native sudo command

## Crypto Mining Consumes a Mind-Boggling 2% of U.S. Electricity

date: 2024-02-01, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTI3NjEwNi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcxMjY3NzU5NX0._xwhVFI3IOnEpsqm3L7_xx9snU4u9dkkjBMn-LuAOHg/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p>Just how much electricity does cryptocurrency mining use? It could be over 2% of all electricity in the United States, according to a <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61364" target="_blank">preliminary estimate</a> released by the Energy Information Administration. More specifically, “annual electricity use from cryptocurrency mining probably represents from 0.6% to 2.3% of U.S. electricity consumption.”</p><p>Using data from the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance on Bitcoin, specifically, the EIA estimated that, at least as of January 2022, almost 38% of all Bitcoin mining <strong></strong><em></em>was occurring in the U.S., which let it produce a range of estimates for Bitcoin mining’s electricity usage, ranging from 25 terawatt-hours to 91 terawatt-hours — about the same amount of electricity consumed by around 3 million to around 6 million homes — or roughly the electricity consumption of Utah or West Virginia. That wide range is due to the imprecise nature of the measurements, which are based on how active a crypocurrency mining operation would be based on the price of Bitcoin and other factors. Global electricity consumption based on these estimates, the EIA said, was “about the same as total electricity consumption in Greece or Australia.”</p><p>So why is Bitcoin so power hungry?</p><p>In some deep sense, Bitcoin <em>is</em> electricity. The cryptocurrency is “mined” — i.e. new Bitcoins are generated — through what’s called a proof of work system, essentially a way of proving that a computer (or, in reality, lots of computers) have done a lot of computation. This computational work maintains the system as a whole, and thus the new Bitcoins are a reward for doing this decentralized maintenance. (Lots of other cryptocurrencies also use a proof of work system the mint new coins, the notable exception being Ethereum, which last year switched to what’s called a “proof of stake” system that uses less energy. This, Ethereum leadership said, makes the blockchain “<a href="https://ethereum.org/energy-consumption" target="_blank">green</a>.”)</p><p>All that computation is incredibly energy intensive, which is why we see crypto miners glom onto sources of cheap energy. Sometimes the cheapest energy they can use is not using energy at all — Bitcoin mines in Texas are part of a demand management program run by the state’s electricity market, ERCOT, where they can collect <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/06/texas-paid-bitcoin-miner-riot-31point7-million-to-shut-down-in-august.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hefty payments</a> for not operating when electricity demand is high.</p><p>This energy consumption is a frequent point of criticism for advocates, activists, and lawmakers who are skeptical of cryptocurrency and earlier this week, the EIA said it would start <a href="https://www.eia.gov/pressroom/releases/press550.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">collecting its own data</a> on cryptocurrency mining.</p><p>So far, the EIA has found 137 cryptocurrency mining facilities, with several of the largest ones located in Texas. But this was just done by scanning publicly available data. The EIA said <a href="https://www.eia.gov/pressroom/releases/press550.php" target="_blank">earlier this week</a> that it will be conducting a “mandatory survey” to better understand crypto’s energy demands.</p>

## What's up at Harvard?

date: 2024-02-01, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I wrote this note to Chris Lydon re the <a href="https://radioopensource.org/the-humbling-of-harvard/">latest episode</a> of his podcast. </p>
<ul>
<li>Chris,</li>
<li>I'm listening to your latest <a href="https://radioopensource.org/the-humbling-of-harvard/">podcast about Harvard</a>, and totally appreciate this. </li>
<li>In my two years at Harvard in the 00s, I never:</li>
<ul>
<li>1. Experienced antisemitism.</li>
<li>2. Saw antisemitism.</li>
<li>3. Even thought about the <i>possibility</i> of antisemitism.</li>
</ul>
<li>On the Harvard campus.</li>
<li>That said, antisemitism is everywhere, even inside me, a man whose grandparents were Jews who fled for their lives with their children from the Holocaust before and during WWII. I am a product of that, in ways I didn't even realize until my parents were gone. It's everywhere, all around, inside myself, inside everyone, and the best we can hope for imho is that it will stay hidden. </li>
<li>Ask me about what happened in the NBA with <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+kyrie">Kyrie Irving</a>, and how, by their silence, the players and coaches showed how huge and deep the problem is.</li>
<li>To see the Repubs monetize this for political gain is par for the course. To see Harvard buckle under that, is weak and the people who made that decision imho should resign in disgrace. </li>
<li>Thanks for your continued and unique excellence. </li>
<li>Dave</li>
</ul>

## Making a PDF that’s larger than Germany

date: 2024-02-01, from: OS News

A few times a year, a claim will make the rounds that the largest PDF you can make is a square covering about the middle section of Germany &#8211; 381 km × 381 km. Turns out, this is only the maximum size Acrobat Reader can display, and not the limit of the format itself at all. So, how big can you go? Very big: If you’re curious, that width is approximately the distance between the Earth and the Moon. I’d have to get my ruler to check, but I’m pretty sure that’s larger than Germany. I could keep going. And I did. Eventually I ended up with a PDF that Preview claimed is larger than the entire universe – approximately 37 trillion light years square. Admittedly it’s mostly empty space, but so is the universe. If you’d like to play with that PDF, you can get it here. Please don’t try to print it. ↫ Alex Chan Don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;m out of magenta anyway.

## Why This Copper-Nickel Mine Has Been Delayed for Nearly 20 Years

date: 2024-02-01, from: Heatmap News

Permits have been issued and revoked; <a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2023/08/02/mpca-was-arbitrary-and-capricious-in-granting-polymet-permit-supreme-court-rules/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">state</a> and <a href="https://knsiradio.com/2022/01/25/wildlife-groups-sue-agencies-over-assessment-on-polymet-mine/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">federal agencies</a> have been sued. The argument at the heart of the saga <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/01/23/1086458/critical-minerals-nickel-inflation-reduction-act-environmental-dangers/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">is familiar</a>: Whether the pollution and disruption the mine will create are worth it for the jobs and minerals that it will produce. </p>
<p>The arguments are so familiar, in fact, that one wonders why we haven’t come up with a permitting and approval process that accounts for them. In total, the $1 billion NewRange project required more than 20 state and federal permits to move forward, all of which were secured by 2019. But since then, a number have been <a href="https://apnews.com/article/new-range-mine-tribe-water-pollution-minnesota-075463042956fa4e89d576c5cae8f663" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">revoked</a> or <a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2023/08/02/mpca-was-arbitrary-and-capricious-in-granting-polymet-permit-supreme-court-rules/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">remanded</a> back to the permit-issuing agencies. Just last year, for instance, the Army Corps of Engineers rescinded NewRange’s wetlands permit on the recommendation of the Environmental Protection Agency. </p>
<p>The messy history of this mine displays the difficult decisions the U.S. faces when it comes to securing the critical minerals that are key to a clean energy future — and the ways in which our current regulatory and permitting infrastructure is ill-equipped to resolve these tensions.</p>
<p>All sides in this debate recognize that minerals like nickel and copper are vital to the energy transition. Nickel is an integral component in most lithium-ion EV battery chemistries, and copper is used across a whole swath of technologies — electric vehicles, solar panels, and wind turbines, to name a few. </p>
<p>“We recognize that you're going to need copper, nickel, and other minerals in order to have a functioning society and to make the clean energy transition that we're all interested in,” Aaron Klemz, Chief Strategy Officer at the Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy, told me. But along with a number of other environmental groups and the Fond du Lac band of the Minnesota Chippewa tribe, which lives downstream of the proposed mine, MCEA opposes the project. “You can’t not mine. We understand that. But you have to take it on a case-by-case basis.” </p>
<p>On the one hand, the Duluth Complex, where the NewRange mine would be sited, contains one of the world’s largest <a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2022/07/07/northeast-minnesotas-fraught-choice-precious-metals-v-precious-water/#:~:text=The%20Duluth%20Complex%2C%20where%20its%20mine%20would%20be%20located%2C%20is%20considered%20one%20of%20the%20largest%20undeveloped%20copper%2Dnickel%20resources%20in%20the%20world%2C" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">untapped deposits</a> of copper, nickel and other key metals. However, the critical minerals in this water-rich environment are bound to sulfide ores that can release toxic sulfuric acid when exposed to water and air. The proposed mine sits in a watershed that would eventually flow into Lake Superior, a critical source of drinking water for the Upper Midwest.</p>
<p>Many advocacy groups believe water pollution from the mine is inevitable, especially given NewRange’s plans for its waste basin. The current proposal involves covering the waste products, known as tailings, with water and containing the resulting slurry will with a dam. That’s considered much riskier than draining water from the tailings and “dry stacking” them in a pile. NewRange’s <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN2AX0YI/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">upstream dam construction</a> method is also a concern, as the wet tailings can erode the dam’s walls more easily than with other designs. An upstream dam <a href="https://www.minnpost.com/environment/2019/08/a-dam-collapse-in-brazil-has-some-worried-about-polymets-plans-why-the-dnr-says-it-wont-happen-here/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">collapsed in Brazil in 2019</a>, leading the country to ban this type of construction altogether. </p>
<p>And lastly, there’s the narrow question of the NewRange dam’s bentonite clay liner. Late last year, an administrative law judge recommended that state regulators <a href="https://apnews.com/article/minnesota-mining-environment-copper-nickel-8807341897539ec884d03c515a2eadd6" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">refrain from reissuing NewRange’s permit to mine</a> on the grounds that this liner was not a “practical and workable” method of containing the tailings.</p>
<p>Christie Kearney, director of sustainability, environmental and regulatory affairs for NewRange Copper Nickel, called these criticisms “tired and worn talking points” in a follow-up email to me, and said that the concerns simply don’t hold water “after the most comprehensive and lengthy environmental review and permitting process in Minnesota history.” The bentonite issue in particular, she told me, represents one of the main reasons permitting has been so challenging. “Instead of allowing agencies (who have the expertise) to make these decisions as established in Minnesota law, the regulatory decisions get challenged in court by mining opponents, leaving it to judges (who don’t have the technical expertise) to make these determinations,” she wrote.</p>
<p>The whole process could have gone more smoothly if all the stakeholders were involved from the beginning, she told me when we spoke. “In particular, we have a number of state permits that are overseen by the EPA, yet the EPA isn't involved until the very end, which has caused frustration both in our environmental review process as well as our permitting process.” </p>
<p>Klemz has another approach to ending the confusion. What is needed, he said, is a pathway to shut down projects once and for all if they’re deemed too environmentally hazardous. “There is no way to say no under the system we have now,” he told me. While courts can deny or revoke a permit, companies like NewRange can always go back to the drawing board and resubmit. “What we have instead is a system where the company has the incentive to keep on trying over and over and over again, despite whatever setback they encounter.”</p>
<p>While there’s no systematic way to block a mine, myriad avenues can lead to a “no.” Last year, the federal government placed a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/26/climate/mining-ban-boundary-waters-copper.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">moratorium</a> on mining on federal lands upstream of Minnesota’s Boundary Waters Canoe Wilderness Area, effectively shutting down another proposed copper-nickel mine. And the EPA <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/31/climate/pebble-mine-epa-decision.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">banned the disposal of mine waste</a> near Alaska’s proposed Pebble mine, blocking that project as well. </p>
<p>It’s a delicate balancing act, because ultimately the administration does want to incentivize domestic critical minerals production. The Inflation Reduction Act provides <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/cleanenergy/clean-energy-updates/2023/03/31/treasury-releases-guidance-to-drive-investment-in-critical-minerals-battery-supply-chains-in-america/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">generous tax credits</a> for companies involved in minerals processing, cathode materials production, and battery manufacturing. Then there’s the $7,500 credit available to consumers that purchase a qualifying EV, which depends on the automaker sourcing minerals from either the U.S. or a country the U.S. has a free-trade agreement with. </p>
<p>Under the <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/12/15/2023-27498/section-45x-advanced-manufacturing-production-credit#:~:text=Direct%20material%20costs,as%20production%20costs." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">current interpretation of the IRA</a>, it’s possible that none of this money would flow directly to NewRange, since mineral extraction isn’t eligible for a tax credit, and it’s yet unclear whether the company will process the metals to a high enough grade to be eligible for credits there, either. Automakers that source from NewRange could benefit, but the project doesn’t currently have offtake agreements with any electric vehicle or clean energy company. That’s something that critics of the mine point to when <a href="https://www.newrangecoppernickel.com/news/newrange-copper-nickel-poised-to-supply-critical-minerals-for-clean-energy-transition" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NewRange touts its clean energy credentials</a>.</p>
<p>“It's much more likely that this will end up in a string of Christmas lights than it will end up in a wind turbine in the United States,” Klemz told me. Of course, more critical minerals in the market overall will lower prices, thereby benefiting clean energy projects. But NewRange is a less neat proposition than, say, the <a href="https://talonmetals.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">proposed Talon Metals nickel mine</a>, which is sited about two hours southwest of NewRange. <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/01/25/1087027/climate-subsidies-inflation-reduction-act-mining-critical-minerals/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">As MIT Technology Review reports</a>, this mine could unlock billions in federal subsidies through its offtake agreement with Tesla.</p>
<p>That hasn’t inoculated Talon from fierce local opposition, either. “As disinterested as the public may be in a lot of things, they are really engaged in a new mining project in their backyard,” said Adrian Gardner, Principal Nickel Markets Analyst at the energy and research consultancy Wood Mackenzie, which has been tracking both the Talon and NewRange mine since they were first proposed.</p>
<p>The Biden administration is also engaged. Two years ago, the Department of the Interior <a href="https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-department-launches-interagency-working-group-mining-reform" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">convened an interagency working group</a> to make domestic minerals production more sustainable and efficient, starting with the Mining Law of 1872 — still the law of the land when it comes to new mining projects. The group <a href="https://www.doi.gov/media/document/mriwg-report-final-508-pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">released a report</a> last September recommending, among other things, that the Bureau of Land Management and U.S. Forest Service provide standardized guidance to prospective developers and require meetings between all relevant agencies and potential developers before any applications are submitted. That means Congress will need to provide more resources to permitting agencies.</p>
<p>Those resources could come from a proposed royalty of between 4% and 8% on the net proceeds of minerals extracted from public lands, a fee that would also go to help communities most impacted by mining. The National Mining Association, of which NewRange is a member, has <a href="https://nma.org/2023/09/12/iwg-recommendations-on-mining-unworkable-and-unreasonable/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">come out strongly against</a> the report’s recommendations, highlighting the high royalties as a particular point of contention. </p>
<p>But many of the report’s proposals might have helped NewRange in its early days. “There were a lot of early missteps by the company,” Kearney admits. “The first draft [Environmental Impact Statement] that the company went through received a very poor reading from the EPA, and the company went back to its drawing board, changed out its leadership and its environmental leads.”</p>
<p>More stern rebukes, of course, would be the ideal for many advocacy groups. “I don't know how they could redesign it quite honestly, given what we know about the science, to comply with the law,” Klemz said. </p>
<p>Kearney is adamant, though, that even after five years of litigation, NewRange has no plans to give up the fight. “Not many companies can weather that,” Kearney said. Not many companies, however, are backed by mining giant Glencore. PolyMet, the project’s original developer, “really only survived because Glencore came in a few years back and invested over time until the point where they got <a href="https://apnews.com/article/glencore-polymet-newrange-teck-copper-nickel-mining-8221342118d7fefb29a7e204f5e3b9ef" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">100% contro</a>l,” Kearney told me. </p>
<p>Glencore, a $65 billion Swiss company, is pursuing the NewRange project in partnership with Teck Resources, which is worth $20 billion. The companies can afford to fight for a very long time, meaning nobody knows quite how or when this all ends. </p>
<p>“We do need this material. I get that,” Klemz told me. “So I don't really know if there's going to be some kind of neat future resolution to this.”</p>
<p>Kearney put it simply. “We don't have a timeline right now.”</p>

## The Sega AI Computer (セガＡＩコンピューター)

date: 2024-02-01, from: OS News

Around late 1986, Sega released the “Sega AI Computer”. This is one of Sega’s least well known and rarest systems. Not much is known about this system apart from a small amount of information in Japanese and American flyers and press articles. The information we have is still piecemeal and may be partly inaccurate. Today we are making public, for the first time: all system roms extracted from the Sega AI Computer, data dumps from 26 my-cards and 14 tapes, many scans and photographs, and in collaboration with MAME developers, an early working MAME driver allowing this computer to be emulated. ↫ SMS Power! Incredible. Usually stuff like this is relegated to a YouTube video, with potential archival efforts pushed to the background since it&#8217;s boring and won&#8217;t get any views. This is an amazing effort.

## Pentagon Hints at Stronger Response Against Iranian Proxies

date: 2024-02-01, from: VOA News USA

Washington  — U.S. forces are preparing to hit Iran-backed proxies across the Middle East with increased intensity in response to a drone attack on a base in Jordan that killed three U.S. soldiers and injured more than 40 others.


U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, speaking to reporters for the first time since he was hospitalized January 1 for complications from prostate cancer surgery, called the attack against sleeping quarters at Tower 22 in northeastern Jordan "egregious," adding such actions will not be tolerated.


"It's time to take away even more capability than we've taken in the past," Austin said Thursday, when asked why the United States has waited to respond more strongly to the more than 165 attacks on U.S. forces in the Middle East dating to mid-October of last year.


The U.S. defense secretary also seemed to dismiss a statement issued by Kataib Hezbollah, an Iran-backed militia in Iraq, that it was suspending military operations against the U.S.


"We always listen to what people are saying, but we watch what they do," he said. "Actions are everything."


Austin also suggested that following the deadly attack in Jordan, such gestures are too little, too late.


"We look to hold the people that are responsible for this accountable," he said. "And we also look to make sure that we continue to take away capability from them as we go forward."


Like his counterparts at the White House and the State Department, Austin said the U.S. is moving forward with a "multi-tiered response" likely to include multiple military strikes.


CBS News reported Thursday that U.S. President Joe Biden has approved plans for several days of strikes on targets that include "Iranian personnel and facilities" in both Iraq and Syria.


With the exception of a strike on January 4 in Baghdad that killed the leader of the Iran-backed Harakat-al-Nujaba militia, previous U.S. responses have focused on hitting sites and storage facilities instead of militia personnel.




Some critics, though, have raised concerns that Washington's willingness to talk about a military response has given the Iran-backed militias, many of which have launched attacks on U.S. forces under the banner of the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, time to prepare.


But Austin said he was not concerned with reports that some of the militias have been evacuating bases and training facilities.


"In terms of telegraphing about strikes and whether or not people leave or what is left, I won't speculate," the defense secretary said.


"They have a lot of capability. I have a lot more," he said. "We're going to do what's necessary to protect our troops and our interests."


The defense chief also acknowledged there has been no end to attacks on international shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden by Iran-backed Houthi militants in Yemen despite several warnings and a series strikes on Houthi facilities and missile launch locations.


"The Houthis continue to do some things that are very irresponsible and illegal," he told reporters. "So, our goal is to make sure that we continue to take away capability from the Houthis to do what they've been doing.


"We would call upon Iran to quit or to cease supplying the Houthis with these advanced conventional weapons that they've used to attack ships," he said, calling it an issue of international concern.


The Houthis have launched nearly 40 attacks on international shipping since mid-November, including a flurry of attacks and attempted attacks on Thursday.


U.S. Central Command, which oversees U.S. forces in the Middle East, said it started with the shootdown of a drone in the early morning hours, Yemen time, over the Gulf of Aden.


Several hours later, U.S. forces in the Red Sea destroyed a Houthi naval drone packed with explosives that was headed for international shipping lanes.


“It presented an imminent threat to merchant vessels and the U.S. Navy ships in the region,” U.S. Central Command, also known as CENTCOM, said in a statement.


A couple of hours after the naval drone was eliminated, CENTCOM said the Houthis fired two anti-ship ballistic missiles in the general direction of the M/V Koi, a Bermuda-owned cargo ship.


A CENTCOM statement said the missiles missed the ship and splashed into the water.


In January, the U.S. designated the Houthis as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist group.

Warren, Mich.; Washington — U.S. President Joe Biden on Thursday visited Michigan to meet with union autoworkers (UAW) crucial to his reelection bid in the important swing state that is also home to the highest number of Arab Americans.


On the same day he issued an executive order to sanction individuals who support settler violence against Palestinians in the West Bank.


His administration says the action reflects a “holistic approach” to the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, that has bled into increasing violence in the West Bank, a separate Palestinian enclave.


"President Biden has also spoken about his concern about the rise in violence that we have seen in the West Bank from extremist actors — in particular the rise in extremist settler violence, which reached record levels in 2023," national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in a statement Thursday.


White House officials say the executive action had been long planned and deny that it was issued to coincide with Biden's visit amid anger from Arab and Muslim Americans, as well as young and progressive Democrats over his staunch support for Israel's military campaign in Gaza. Biden first expressed his concern over Palestinians in the West Bank under attack by what he called "extremist" Israeli settlers in late October, a few weeks after the Hamas attack.


The financial sanctions target four Israeli men accused of fomenting and participating in settler violence.


"There’s no plans to target with sanctions Israeli government officials at this time," John Kirby, a spokesperson for the National Security Council, told VOA aboard Air Force 1 on Thursday.


Kirby denied that Biden is using the executive order to signal displeasure at hardline members of Netanyahu’s government who have facilitated such violence, including National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir.


"It’s a signal to the whole world how seriously President Biden takes ... the settler violence against Palestinians in the West Bank," Kirby said.


Immediately after the Hamas October 7 attack, Ben Gvir distributed more than 10,000 rifles to arm Israeli civilians, including those in towns near the West Bank.




White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre sidestepped questions why the lone Palestinian American congresswoman, Democrat Rashida Tlaib, did not join Biden on the trip. Her district is near the site of his visit, and it is customary for the president to invite elected officials to join him. Senators Debbie Stabenow and Gary Peters traveled with Biden on Thursday, as did Rep. Debbie Dingell. All are Democrats.


Tlaib has been vocal in her criticism of Biden’s support for Israel, and in her calls for a cease-fire. In November, Tlaib posted a video online in which she accused Biden of "supporting the genocide of the Palestinian people."


The Arab American community is among a growing number of Americans who have expressed concerns about Biden’s steadfast support of Israel’s aggressive military operation in response to the Hamas militant group’s October 7 terror attack on Israeli civilians. The U.S., U.K. and EU have designated Hamas as a terrorist organization.


"We understand how difficult this is for many," Jean-Pierre said to VOA. "We get that."


Close to 200 pro-Palestinian demonstrators were waiting for Biden near the UAW Region 1 building in Warren, the outskirts of Detroit, ahead of his event there. The president's motorcade bypassed them using side streets and he was largely spared from streetside protesters who in previous trips have lined his route and interrupted his events. In his last stop however, he was met with a small group waving Palestinian flags and chanting "Genocide Joe."


Prominent members of the community have complained that the White House has ignored their concerns.


"Since October 7th, I have received ZERO correspondence from White House, DNC [Democratic National Committee], or MDP [Michigan Democratic Party] leadership about the concerns from our community on the ongoing genocide unfolding in Gaza," said Rep. Abraham Aiyash of the Michigan state Legislature on social media ahead of Biden’s visit.


A New York Times/Siena College poll published in December, however, found that almost as many Americans believe that Israel should push on to total victory even in the face of mounting civilian casualties.


And there is a diversity of opinion within the Muslim American community.


"He's doing the best he can," Mustafa Abdullah Rahman, a U.S. Army veteran, told VOA as Biden stopped at a Black-owned restaurant near Detroit. "And I feel bad for my Palestinian brothers and sisters, because they are suffering. Both sides are suffering. And so he's doing the best he can in a very touchy, touchy situation."


Biden has so far resisted pressure to call for a cease-fire, saying it will only benefit Hamas at this point. His administration is pushing for negotiations that would allow 6 weeks of cessation of hostilities for the exchange of more than 100 Israeli hostages still held by Hamas with Palestinians held in Israeli jails.


While Biden continues to provide significant military and diplomatic support for Israel, analysts say there has been a shift in his approach.


Since October 7, especially in the last few weeks, Biden has "visibly put pressure on Israel to limit the damage in Gaza," said Jeremi Suri, a history professor at the University of Texas at Austin. And he has expressed empathy and concern for the lives of citizens in Gaza and elsewhere, Suri said.


"He has moderated and balanced his language, maybe not as much as some people want," Suri told VOA. "But as we know, there's no one who's happy with it or found perfect balance on this issue."


Robert Murrett, a professor in the Department of Public Administration and International Affairs at Syracuse University, said it makes sense that the administration has shifted.


"I'm a military person, so we tend to put it in phases," he said. "The situation has changed. Over the last couple of months, I don't think there's any question that concerns over the level of Palestinian casualties – more than 20,000 dead in Gaza – have modified positions by a lot of people, including a White House and just about all of our allied governments and many others."


As Biden was touring a restaurant meeting voters, VOA asked Biden what his message is to Arab American communities.


He did not respond.


White House correspondent Anita Powell reported from Washington.

## “I used to listen to your podcast”

date: 2024-02-01, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>Often when I talk with folks who know me from <a href="https://shoptalkshow.com/">my podcast</a> they will say something along the lines of, “I used to listen to your podcast!” Then they blush because their statement implies they don’t listen anymore (<a href="https://piccalil.li/blog/shoptalk-reaches-600th-episode/">Exhibit A</a>). And I just wanted to say…</p>
<p>I get it.</p>
<p>It’s fine. I take no offense. In fact, that’s part of the magic of podcasts! There’s an ebb and flow to them. Here’s ten reasons I give up on podcasts<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>:</p>
<ol>
<li>You need certain podcasts at certain times in your life.</li>
<li>You and the podcast grow in different directions.</li>
<li>You finish a season or story arc and it feels like a good stopping point.</li>
<li>You find yourself subscribed to <em>too many</em> of the <em>same kind</em> of podcast (tech, murder mystery, actual play, two white dudes talking, etc).</li>
<li>Nearly every podcast goes through an experimental phase and it’s okay not to join them on that cringe journey, you can catch up afterwards.</li>
<li>Podcasts bring an immense amount of joy, but they can become another item on the to do list.</li>
<li>There might be a global pandemic that cut your daily commute to zero and now you don’t have time for podcasts.</li>
<li>You might get into audiobooks with a consistent narrative instead of rambly diatribes.</li>
<li>People are only so original. When podcasts get a bit repetitive, it’s okay to peel off.</li>
<li>A great reset where all podcasts must earn their position back in the queue!</li>
</ol>
<p>Unsubscribe and if you miss it you can always go back. As long as they paid their hosting bill, it should still be there.</p>
<p>With RSS you can unplug from the machine. Podcasts – built on RSS – are the same. A never ending stream of content… but with latency. It’s important we celebrate the Thrill of Missing Out.</p>
<section class="footnotes">
<ol>
<li id="fn1">
<p>You can also unsubscribe for petty reasons like audio quality or you don’t like the person’s voice, but I’d encourage you to seek past that best you can. <a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-backref">↩</a></p>

## On digital relationships

date: 2024-02-01, from: Manu - I write blog

<p>This is my entry for February’s <a href="https://indieweb.org/indieweb-carnival">IndieWeb carnival</a>. This month is hosted by yours truly and I’d love to have you as part of this initiative.</p>
<hr />
<p>Digital relationships are a fascinating concept. The idea that a relationship with someone else can be lived, consumed, and enjoyed entirely inside the digital space is something we probably take for granted but it’s such a unique and distinctive feature of this time we live in.</p>
<p>If you’re like me, you probably met and interacted with more people in the digital world than in real life. And I’m not saying this because I’m an introvert, I don’t think I am. I’m saying this simply because it’s the result of the life I live.</p>
<p>Daily I receive emails or messages from people I don’t know and will never meet “in real life”. And daily I send back messages to these people sharing thoughts, opinions, bits of my life. That’s just what my life is these days and, to be honest with you, I find it incredibly rewarding at a personal level.</p>
<p>But my life hasn’t always been like that. I’m technically a child of the 80s—juuuuust barely—but I grew up in the 90s. The internet wasn’t part of my life and the same can be said for most of the technology we take for granted nowadays. I had a cellphone—not a smartphone—and SMS was how we communicated. But SMS was such a limited and costly way to interact that using it to have digital relationships was not an option. And you had to have someone’s number first.</p>
<p>My first experience with a digital relationship happened on a forum. Do you remember those? I love forums. They’re such a neat way to organize an online community. I’m even considering setting up one myself! Anyway, I remember browsing and posting on <a href="https://www.hwupgrade.it/forum/">hwupgrade.it/forum/</a> in the early 2000s and becoming friends with an Italian girl. We talked PS1 games and it was awesome. I never met her, never seen a picture of her, never even cared about asking for one. The only thing we exchanged were names and that was it.</p>
<p>That was just the first in a long series of fun digital relationships. I met people playing the original COD MW2, back in 2009, I connected with strangers during the #followfriday days of early Twitter, and I exchanged countless emails with designers and developers during my years curating the—now defunct—thegallery.io.</p>
<p>With most of the people I consider friends I have digital relationships. I met <a href="https://robhope.com">Rob</a> in person once in my life. We’ve known each other since I think 2012 and I hear from him pretty much daily. The same is true for <a href="https://carlbarenbrug.com">Carl</a>. We met in person exactly once and I hear from him daily. <a href="https://mwarrenarts.com">Mike</a> connected with me via email in 2015 and we’re still friends to this day. We never met in person and that’s absolutely fine.</p>
<p>Digital relationships are powerful. Some people discard them because they think they’re not at the same level as “real relationships” but I disagree. Digital relationships are their own thing. They have their own rules, and their own ways to be unique. And they can be as important as any other relationship.</p>
<p>The current internet can be a miserable place, I know. Social media can be a cesspool, people are mean, and there are weirdos everywhere. It sucks. I’m not going to pretend everything is wonderful out there. But I still have hope. I do because of the countless lovely exchanges I had via email with people like you.</p>
<p>You, are a wonderful person. I don’t have any reason to think otherwise. And I’m sure there are others like you out there. Curious people, kind people, generous people. People who like to share, to engage honestly.</p>
<p>Digital relationships are powerful but don’t take my word for it. Try for yourself. Next time you stumble on a personal site you find interesting, try to connect with the person behind that site. Write an email, say hi, send them some love. You won’t regret it.</p>
<hr />
<p>You have time until March 1st to publish something on the topic of “Digital Relationships” and be part of the IndieWeb Carnival. Just make sure to <a href="mailto:hello@manuelmoreale.com">send me an email</a> with the link if you want to be included in the roundup post.</p>

## Why is L.A. Still Letting Single-Family Homeowners Block Solutions to the Housing Crisis?

date: 2024-02-01, updated: 2024-02-01, from: RAND blog

Some constituencies will always oppose development. Los Angeles policymakers who are serious about solving the dual crises of housing affordability and homelessness have to take a hard look at how much political capital they are willing to spend to create effective policies in the face of such objections.

## Austin Says He Never Told Anyone on His Staff to Keep White House in the Dark on Hospitalization

date: 2024-02-01, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON  — Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Thursday he never directed anyone on his staff not to tell the White House he'd been hospitalized and takes full responsibility for keeping President Joe Biden in the dark for weeks that he'd been diagnosed with prostate cancer.


“We did not handle this right and I did not handle this right. I should have told the president about my cancer diagnosis. I take full responsibility,” Austin said.


“The news shook me,” Austin, 70, said when he first got the diagnosis. “Frankly, my first instinct was to keep it private.”


Speaking to reporters in the Pentagon briefing room, Austin provided his most extensive comments to date on the secrecy surrounding his cancer diagnosis and struggles with complications since his surgery on Dec. 22. It was the first time he had answered questions from reporters since being rushed back to the hospital on Jan. 1.




“I never directed anyone to keep my January hospitalization from the White House,” Austin said.


Known as a very private person, Austin appeared calm as he fielded a barrage of questions about his health and why he failed to inform the president and other key leaders about his hospitalizations until days after he was admitted to intensive care.


His lack of disclosure prompted changes in federal guidelines and triggered an internal Pentagon review and an inspector general review into his department’s notification procedures. Both reviews are ongoing, and members of Congress have called for hearings on the matter.


Austin was diagnosed with prostate cancer early in December and had surgery on Dec. 22. On Jan. 1, he was taken by ambulance to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center after experiencing extreme pain due to complications from the surgery and was admitted to the intensive care unit.




He transferred decision-making authorities to Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks, but did not tell her why. And he did not tell Biden and other top officials about his diagnosis, his surgery or hospitalization until several days after he was in the ICU.


Asked about the matter earlier in January, Biden said it was a lapse in judgment for Austin not to tell him about his hospitalization, but Biden said he still has confidence in his Pentagon chief.


Austin, who worked from home for two weeks after his release from the hospital Jan. 15, returned to work in the Pentagon on Monday. He had not been in the building since Dec. 21.


Underscoring the secrecy surrounding Austin's hospital visit, one of his aides asked first responders to avoid using lights and sirens when requesting an ambulance be sent to the secretary's northern Virginia home on Jan. 1.

## The Stanford Digital Library Project

<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/205323.205338"><i>The Stanford Digital Library Project</i></a> stated its goal thus:<br />
<blockquote>
  The Stanford Integrated Digital Library Project will develop enabling technologies for an integrated “virtual” library to provide an array of new services and uniform access to networked information collections. The Integrated Digital Library will create a shared environment linking everything from personal information collections, to collections of conventional libraries, to large data collections shared by scientists.
</blockquote>
Stanford librarians <a href="http://diglib.stanford.edu:8091/diglib/pub/people.shtml">Vicky Reich and Rebecca Wesley</a> provided the "library" input for the research.<br />

This rough transcript runs from <a href="https://youtu.be/GjR7sRASjdo?feature=shared&amp;t=2867">[47:47]</a> to <a href="https://youtu.be/GjR7sRASjdo?feature=shared&amp;t=3215">[53:35]</a>. Andy speaks:<br />
<br />
The true story is that I met the founders of Google before the company existed because they were, like I was, a student at Stanford.
I'm not sure Larry was really ready to abandon the PhD program and jump into this.
So I was in this same position once myself and I used the same line "you'll always finish your PhD later".
Now the concern I had is that if they didn't get going this great idea may be not happening.
<br /><br />
Of course I was involved in the company itself but it was really really a very good idea, one of the best ideas I've ever seen.
This notion of relevant search  and relevant ads and this business model that solved it
Put it this way, I was very familiar with scientific publishing where what matters is not how many papers you write but how many people cite your papers.
So if you apply the same thing to the Web clearly what is relevant is what other people link to and notice.
You could automatically build a graph, a structure that said what's more important than others.
<br /><br />
At the time people didn't think automatic search was actually possible because Alta Vista which was popular at the time just looked at keywords.
What people would do is they would add the whole dictionary as a dark page behind the document.
Since every word you are looking for is in the dictionary you couldn't find anything any more because every document had every word.
That wasn't a path to success; you couldn't actually look at the document because it could just be spam.
<br /><br />
Yahoo believed fairly strongly, they actually had at one point talked to Larry and Sergey and maybe even Larry was offering them to sell them the idea but Yahoo passed on the belief that you just couldn't do it.
They really thought you could hire people, like newspaper editors, they would make the sports section and the garden section like a newspaper; select content from the Web that then they would present to the front page.
Clearly that was not going to scale if there were millions of Web pages you just couldn't keep it up.
<br /><br />
So Larry and Sergey believed very strongly that it had to be automatic and that if that wasn't possible  — it was the only way to do it basically.
That first demo which they had on a laptop was actually quite compelling it looked the same as before — here's the lucky button.
The only worry was they wanted to sort of demo they could scale the search engine to like a couple of racks of computers before they would raise the real venture and there was some question whether it was scalable.
For that they just wanted to raise a small amount of money to build the first couple of racks with motherboards.
<br /><br />
The money that I put in there on day one was actually before the company started helped to demonstrate that.
So I bought them this check.
They had the name of the company but the check was to the name of the company that didn't exist.
At the time some of the law firms were so busy they didn't want to take on new clients that didn't have some funding behind them.
I figured if I write them a check it would help them to get the right firm.
But I can't claim any credit for what they've done its all due to the insight they had and the team they built.
<br /><br />
Let me back up here.
I couldn't find stuff on Alta Vista so I was desperate for better search.
A lot of my time was looking for data sheets and information I was looking for and if I couldn't find anything on the Web the Web wouldn't be very useful.
Like, how do you find stuff?
Its the most important thing.
So for me it was a personal goal to have something that would actually work.
<br /><br />
But in any new company the first question is "what's your business model?"
Even at the time they had this model of sponsored links that would take your search query and link it to this ad inventory.
I asked them "how much is it per click?" and they said 5 cents per click which is still their bottom price today - this is before they got into the competitive bidding - and I did this math in the back of my mind  "a million clicks a day and 5 cents a click is $50K a day" — they can't go broke.
<br /><br />
I had no idea how this would scale, in effect I don't think anybody understood this but it was clear that there was enough interest in finding the people who were looking for stuff.
Lets say you search for a tennis racket.
That means you're probably a tennis player and most likely there will be an ad that shows you tennis rackets or tennis balls or something that relates to your interest.
And the key was you have an unlimited ad inventory, instead of having these banner ads that I have never clicked on in my life, maybe once.
<br /><br />
Banner ads are a waste of bandwidth essentially.
These ads were highly more relevant and even today except for spam mail its the most cost-effective way of advertising or finding customers.
It took advantage of the fact that the Internet is a full-duplex communication path whereas banner ads were more like TV — here's your ad break and here's what you have to consume before you get to the next page.
<br /><br />
Google was an absolutely brilliant idea but funnily enough their business really took off after the dot-com implosion in 2001.
If you look at their historical revenue what happened at that point I believe was that people realized that they spent on banner ads was basically wasted and they got back to an ROI calculation of where do we apply money more cost-effectively and, yeah, so Google.
Once people started bidding for the keywords of course the price per click went up but it still provides very very good value for advertisers.

## Jay Powell under pressure

date: 2024-02-01, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>The Federal Reserve is expected to lower interest rates sometime in 2024 — but that didn&#8217;t happen this week and Fed Chair Jerome Powell said not to expect it in March either. We&#8217;ll discuss the move (or lack thereof), as well as pressure on the central bank to confront housing costs. Plus, we&#8217;re getting more productive, churn in labor market isn&#8217;t as frenzied, and Medicare will start negotiating drug prices.</p>

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/02/01/runner.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Here's what's going to happen. A bunch of new networks are forming, and they will melt into one, following a pattern established by the internet itself, when they formed a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol">net of nets</a> based on a common protocol called TCP. On top of that HTTP was built, with a number of years following with very productive building and bootstrapping, and from there it was a lot of chaos, around the advent of Twitter, Facebook and Google Reader. The last time we had a common way of <a href="http://scripting.com/2014/03/21/theWebIsMadeOfInterop.html">interop</a> was 17 years ago. I think/hope we're incentivized to make one edit box suffice, in place of the 5-10 <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/01/14.html#a145854">tiny little textboxes</a> we now all have to copy-paste between, and btw one way of addressing nodes, and then we can start building again as we did last in the 90s and 00s. I see something brilliant in the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/31/24057231/iconfactory-kickstarter-internet-reader-project-tapestry-twitterrific">new path</a> that Twitteriffic wants to go down (I gave <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/iconfactory/project-tapestry">them</a> $128). It's same path I've been going down, mostly without partners, for the 17 years since we crawled on land and started tweeting. I don't see the negative shit that's happening on Twitter, it's easy to avoid the mess -- I don't think that's the reason we're breaking out of that silo -- it's that all at once all the devs who had been quietly suffering with Twitter were set free. Boom. All at once. And it turns out perhaps we don't give up so easily. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>

## SimpliSafe Video Doorbell: Halt and Catch Fire

date: 2024-02-01, from: Jeff Geerling blog

<span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">SimpliSafe Video Doorbell: Halt and Catch Fire</span>

<p>This SimpliSafe doorbell burned up less than a week after I installed it. I never would've thought a doorbell would be the most dangerous thing I set up at my studio!</p>

<p>I learned a LOT about powering 'smart' doorbells, and talked directly to SimpliSafe about it. They did sent a replacement, but it has it's own problems.</p>

<p>I'm still happy with SimpliSafe overall, but I don't like how I've spent about 8 hours troubleshooting a 'smart' doorbell. The only thing that's been 100% reliable on this thing is the basic ding dong I could've gotten with a <a href="https://amzn.to/4987S9w">five dollar dumb doorbell</a>!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This blog post is based off my latest moving vlog, episode 12, where I talk about my SimpliSafe doorbell problems, the new 10G and 25G networking gear I'm testing, and a new 'retro corner' in my office. Check it out below:</p></blockquote></div>

## GM Announces the Return of the Hybrids

date: 2024-02-01, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDM0MDAwMC9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2ODQzODE2Nn0.7qLtGHwtvJDuHPOt-W4Ue-pqu3d_1ggV3S7sxzg1utg/image.png?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C1%2C0%2C1"/><br/><br/><p>
<em><strong>Current conditions:</strong> The city of Oakland, California opened two emergency shelters for unhoused residents ahead of storms that brought the threat of floods to the state • Dense fog is disrupting flights and trains in Delhi, which is experiencing its coldest January in 13 years • A heat wave in Australia, where it’s currently the summer, is breaking temperature records.</em>
</p><h2>
THE TOP FIVE
</h2><h3>
1. Podesta to become new climate envoy
</h3><p>
	Senior Biden advisor John Podesta will take over from former Secretary of State John Kerry as the U.S. special envoy for climate change, the White House 
	<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=fed2c77d47&e=f1409a4534" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a>. Kerry, who’s stepping down this spring, was the first person to hold the position; while his role was based at the State Department, Podesta will instead remain at the White House, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=b9c6e030f2&e=f1409a4534" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reports</a> Maxine Joselow in the <em>Washington Post</em>, with his title changing to “senior adviser to the president for international climate policy.”
</p><p>
	The appointment marked an expansion of Podesta’s current role implementing Biden’s signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act. He’s going to continue that work — which, Joselow writes, probably means he’ll travel less often than Kerry — but will now also be tapped to help Biden manage relationships with foreign powers.
</p><p>
	If you’d like some insight into how Podesta thinks about climate change and the IRA, our 
	<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=64f9b5a855&e=f1409a4534" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview </a>with him from the sidelines of COP 28 in Dubai might be a good place to start.
</p><h3>
2. Climate laws begin at home
</h3><p>
	The IRA and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (better known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, or BIL) are filled with subsidies to help with the clean energy transition. But, as I 
	<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/ira-bil-tax-incentives-guides" target="_blank">wrote</a> on the site yesterday, a new study shows that while the share of funds for household improvements in each act is relatively small — about 12% in the IRA and 5.7% in the BIL — the impact those improvements could have on emissions is proportionally huge. Household emissions, the study authors write, could decrease by as much as 40% by 2030.
</p><h3>
3. GM’s bringing back hybrids
</h3><p>
	In the face of 
	<a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/dealers-to-gm-we-want-hybrids-5387d2bf" target="_blank">dealer protests</a>, GM CEO Marry Barra told investors this week that the automaker would bring back plug-in hybrids. That's a reversal from the company’s stance of just a few years ago, <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/gms-all-in-electric-future-now-includes-gasoline/" target="_blank">reports</a> David Ferris at <em>E&E News</em>, when GM said it was “all in” on electric vehicles, and is a sign of the difficulties automakers have faced in trying to switch over to EVs.
</p><p>
The announcement comes the same week as 
	<a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61344" target="_blank">new data</a> showing EVs and hybrids made up more than 16% of total light-duty vehicle sales in the U.S. in 2023, up from 12.9% in 2022. Italian luxury automaker Lamborghini also <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/01/lamborghini-will-make-hybrid-versions-of-all-its-cars-to-cut-its-co2/" target="_blank">announced</a> that it will start producing hybrid versions of all its models.</p><div class="horizontal-rule">

4. Crypto mines face an energy accounting
</h3><p>
	Next week the Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration will start collecting data on the energy use of cryptocurrency mining, 
	<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=1f46a4db56&e=f1409a4534" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reports</a> Justine Calma in <em>The Verge</em>. It’s a win for activists and lawmakers who have long warned of the climate impacts of crypto projects, which are so energy-hungry that they’ve spurred the reopening of some shuttered fossil fuel plants.
</p><p>
	“We intend to continue to analyze and write about the energy implications of cryptocurrency mining activities in the United States,” said EIA Administrator Joe DeCarolis in a 
	<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=39532208f5&e=f1409a4534" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a>. “We will specifically focus on how the energy demand for cryptocurrency mining is evolving, identify geographic areas of high growth, and quantify the sources of electricity used to meet cryptocurrency mining demand.”

5. Ford to give away Tesla charger adapters
</h3><p>
	Ford will send free Tesla charging adapters to owners of its Mustang Mach-E and Ford F-150 Lightning EVs in the U.S. and Canada, 
	<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=2ebd18dffa&e=f1409a4534" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a> CEO Jim Farley on X. The adapters will allow Ford owners to access one of the largest and most reliable charging networks in the country. They’re also another nail in the coffin of the Combined Charging Standard or CCS, which Ford and other automakers defaulted to before Ford — followed shortly after by practically every other automaker in the country — announced it would switch to the Tesla plug, which is now known as the North American Charging Standard.
</p><h2>
THE KICKER
</h2><p>
<a href="https://heatmap.news/heatmap-is-hiring-a-climate-tech-reporter" target="_self"></a>The Sun’s magnetic poles are due to flip starting this year, <a href="https://www.vox.com/science/2024/1/31/24047913/solar-maximum-cycle-explained-25-flares-coronal-mass-ejection" target="_blank">writes</a> Brian Resnick in <em>Vox</em>. The flip could cause solar storms that disrupt communications satellites, but will also lead to more vivid auroras. So start planning your aurora trips now — just maybe don’t count on having GPS the whole way.

## What Would You Do?

date: 2024-02-01, from: Dan Rather's Steady

I write this not to advocate for people immigrating to the United States or to campaign against them. This is a story about a desperate journey that tens of thousands are making, in spite of the cost or consequences. Because they feel they must. It is not about one person or group. I am using the stories of Venezuelans as an example because so many have fled their country and are coming to ours. In 2023, more than 260,000 Venezuelan migrants crossed the U.S.-Mexico border. Venezuela&#8217;s migrants represent the largest displacement crisis in the world.

<h4>Good start, but we want further reassurance, says Competition and Markets Authority</h4> <p>Google so far has lived up to its commitments to make room in its Privacy Sandbox for rivals, though the UK's Competition and Markets Authority says a number of concerns still have to be addressed before the web giant's ambitious advertising technology gets its blessing.…</p>

<p>On January 10th the forge that we use to host our projects was taken down by DDoS attacks and was struggling to come back online(it's back now, read the <a href="https://sourcehut.org/blog/2024-01-19-outage-post-mortem/" target="_blank">post-mortem</a>), the event reminded us that we ought to host mirrors and release versions of these source files ourselves. We have begun to <a href="http://wiki.xxiivv.com/etc/" target="_blank">host copies</a> across our various websites. The builds are still accessible through <a href="https://hundredrabbits.itch.io/" target="_blank">itch.io</a>. These will be automatically updated as we work on them in their individual repositories, but mirrored there for reliability. We are thankful for Sourcehut's tireless work on resolving the issue and for taking the time to communicate important changes.</p>

<p>In keeping with the spirit of improving the resilience of the tools we use we've taken a moment to write a kind of pocket version of the console emulator and <a href="http://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/drifblim.html" target="_blank">self-hosted assembler</a> as to see how many lines are needed to start from the seed assembler and replicate it. A copy of the pocket emulator, the source for the assembler and its hexadecimal representation have been <a href="http://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/uxn.html" target="_blank">documented</a>.</p>

<p>On January 17th <a href="https://100r.co/site/victoria.html" target="_blank">Victoria</a> got its first <a href="https://100r.co/media/content/stream/2024_snow.jpg" target="_blank">snowfall</a>, with it came temperatures below freezing. We got to test our recent improvements, like a new <a href="https://100r.co/media/content/boat_projects/vent.jpg" target="_blank">louvered closet vent</a> to help ventilate the space(there are also two existing vents at the top, one on each side). The closet has been dry for the first time in 3 years. We've made an effort not to keep too many items on the floor so the area can breathe. We got ice inside of the windows for the first time ever though... not ideal.</p>

## January 31, 2024

date: 2024-02-01, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog

Stef W. Kight and Zachary Basu of Axios reported tonight that the border measure, on which a bipartisan group of senators have worked for four months, is &#8220;on life support&#8221; after former president Trump urged his supporters in the House to block it so he can run on the issue. Senators are still holding out hope they can get it through, blaming &#8220;misinformation&#8221; about the bill, whose text has not yet been released.

## US Strikes Multiple Drones in Yemen, American Official Says

date: 2024-02-01, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The United States struck up to 10 unmanned drones in Yemen that were preparing to launch, a U.S. official said late on Wednesday, amid escalating tensions from the war in Gaza spreading through the region.


A U.S. Navy ship also shot down three Iranian drones and a Houthi anti-ship ballistic missile in the Gulf of Aden, the U.S. military's Central Command said in a statement. There were no injuries or damage reported, it said.


The Iran-aligned Houthi militants, who control the most populous parts of Yemen, have launched a wave of exploding drones and missiles at commercial vessels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden in recent weeks, calling it a response to Israel's military operations in Gaza and a show of solidarity to Palestinians.


The Houthi campaign has disrupted international shipping.


The United States and Britain have launched strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen and returned the militia to a list of "terrorist groups."


The Houthis, earlier on Wednesday, said their naval forces carried out an operation targeting an "American merchant ship" in the Gulf of Aden hours after firing missiles at U.S. Navy destroyer Gravely.


Houthi attacks on ships in and around the Red Sea have slowed trade between Asia and Europe, raised fears of supply bottlenecks and alarmed major powers concerned that the Gaza war may become a regional conflict.


U.S. President Joe Biden said earlier in January that strikes on Houthi targets would continue even as he acknowledged they may not be halting their attacks.


Israel's assault on the Hamas-run Gaza Strip followed a surprise attack by Hamas militants on southern Israel on October 7, killing 1,200. The Gaza health ministry says nearly 27,000 people have been killed in the fighting since.

## Kataib Hezbollah Should Take US Warning ‘Seriously,’ White House Says

date: 2024-02-01, from: VOA News USA

The White House — National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby warned that Kataib Hezbollah, an Iran-backed group based in Iraq, should take "seriously" the Biden administration's determination to respond to Sunday's drone attack by Iran-backed militants that killed three American soldiers on a U.S. base in Jordan.


VOA White House Bureau Chief Patsy Widakuswara spoke with Kirby following Kataib Hezbollah's Tuesday announcement that it is suspending all military operations against American troops in the region. Kirby also discussed the war in Gaza and other challenges the U.S. is facing around the world.


The following interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.


VOA: Do you attribute Kataib Hezbollah’s announcement to stop attacking U.S. troops in the region to the president firmly signaling that he is ready for a response?


JOHN KIRBY, NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL: It's hard to know exactly why Kataib Hezbollah put that statement out. They should take seriously the determination of the United States and President [Joe] Biden to do what we have to do to protect our troops, our facilities, our interests in the region. They should take that very seriously.


VOA: You're not attributing the attack to them. You're attributing it to their umbrella group, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq?


KIRBY: The Intelligence community's comfortable with an assessment that it was the umbrella group, Islamic Resistance in Iraq, that was responsible for this attack. And as you know, there's several groups that are participants under that moniker.


VOA: And combining that answer with your statement that the U.S. response will be multitiered over a period of time, can we assume that what the president intends to do is striking different Iran-backed proxies in the region over time?


KIRBY: I won't get into the specific actions we're going to take and what the response looks like. The first thing that you see will not be the last thing that you see.


VOA: You also said that striking these Iran-backed proxies won't jeopardize any kind of hostage negotiations with Hamas, but don't these groups have the same ideology?


KIRBY: What I said was, there's no reason for what we're doing to protect our troops and our facilities to impact the negotiations that we're having to try to get another hostage deal in place, and we believe both are important to do. And we're pressing forward with both.


VOA: Are you saying one goal wouldn’t complicate the other?


KIRBY: I'm saying there's no reason for there to be an effect on the hostage negotiations that we're in, by a response to this terrible attack which killed three American soldiers.


VOA: U.S. funding for UNRWA won't start until there are fundamental changes in the agency. Those fundamental changes could take a while to implement. What is the U.S. prepared to do in the meantime? Stand by and allow war orphans to starve?


KIRBY: Of course not, and we are the world's leading nation when it comes to getting humanitarian assistance [to] the people of Gaza. And UNRWA does essential work on the ground in Gaza. Make no mistake about it, they're helping save thousands of lives. They are the prime distributor of aid and assistance inside Gaza, and we recognize that.


We want them to take this seriously. Unacceptable that any employee of UNRWA could be involved in the attacks on October 7, but we're going to wait and see how the investigation goes. We're going to wait and see what kind of accountability measures the U.N. and UNRWA, specifically, are willing to put in place. But we're going to continue to do everything we can to get the security assistance into Gaza. And we certainly want the vast majority of UNRWA employees, who have no connection to Hamas, to be able to continue to do their job.


VOA: But you are admitting that stopping U.S. funding is impacting their work, no?


KIRBY: It’s only affecting the work that we were doing in Jordan. The suspension has nothing to do with Gaza. The money that we have left to spend — that we suspended — has been already pre-earmarked by UNRWA for use in Jordan, not for use in Gaza.


VOA: I'm going to move on to Ukraine funding. It appears that House Republicans are rejecting any kind of border compromise, because they don't really want to give the president a win in an election year.


KIRBY: I certainly can't talk about election politics or what may be behind the motivations here. It's critical that we get this funding for Ukraine, for Israel, for the Indo-Pacific, and certainly for border security.


The president is negotiating in good faith on the Senate side. We believe those discussions are going well, and we hope to get a resolution here relatively soon. Now, what happens in the House is going to be up to Speaker [Mike] Johnson, and Speaker Johnson has not been consistent in what he says he wants to see at the border. So, I would point people to him. He has to speak for the inconsistencies in his messaging. But we are negotiating in good faith. We believe those negotiations are making progress, and that's what we're focused on.


VOA: Are you still sticking to that approach? Would you consider sending a new stand-alone bill just for Ukraine?


KIRBY: I don't want to get ahead of where we are. I mean, we are in the midst of negotiations right now that are not over. So, I wouldn't want to get into speculating about what hypotheticals might happen as a result.


VOA: Can you confirm reporting that Chinese President Xi Jinping promised President Biden that China will not meddle in U.S. elections?


KIRBY: We gave a full summary of that meeting. The president talked to you all after he met with President Xi. I don't have any additional context to share. All I can tell you is that we take the soundness of our election system here in the United States very, very seriously. And we've been clear publicly, and we've been clear privately with interlocutors all around the world that we will do what we have to do to make sure that our elections are free and fair. And they have been, and they will continue to be.


VOA: But just today, Christopher Ray, the FBI director, gave testimony in Congress that Chinese hackers might be targeting U.S. infrastructure, targeting all sorts of things that may disrupt even the election. How do you square that?


KIRBY: I won't speak to specific threats. All I can tell you is we take them seriously. We do everything we can to preserve critical infrastructure, and in the president's mind, our election system is critical infrastructure.


VOA: A new report released by the U.N. sanctions monitoring team today says that al-Qaida has established eight new training camps and a new base to stockpile weaponry in Afghanistan. Are you aware, and are you countering?


KIRBY: I think we're just aware of this report. We haven't worked our way all the way through it. But I think it's important to remember that al-Qaida is a vastly diminished organization in Afghanistan and elsewhere. In fact, the real threat from al-Qaida is the way it's metastasized into other groups elsewhere in the region, like al-Shabab in Somalia.


VOA: Are you downplaying the threat?


KIRBY: Of course not. We're not downplaying any terrorist threat anywhere in the world. Those three American soldiers that were killed were involved in helping our counter ISIS coalition, which is still active in Iraq and Syria. I don't think the record bears out that we've been light on terrorist networks at all, killing [al-Qaida chief Ayman] al-Zawahiri and other leaders in ISIS in just recent weeks and months. What I'm saying is, this is a report we haven't worked our way through right now, and the intelligence community, their assessment is that al-Qaida does not pose an immediate threat to U.S. soil.


VOA: Tomorrow, the president will participate in the dignified transfer of the three American soldiers who died in Jordan. How do you think that will impact Americans’ thinking about the conflict in the Middle East?


KIRBY: I hope it underscores Americans' gratitude for the service, and in many cases, the sacrifice that American men and women in uniform are demonstrating on their behalf, to keep them safe. And that's certainly the case with these three brave individuals who aren't going to make it back home alive to their families.


And I hope it's also a reminder of how diligently President Biden is working to keep the conflict between Israel and Hamas from escalating and widening into a broader regional conflict. We don't seek a war with Iran. We don't want to see a broader conflict, and almost everything the president has done since the seventh of October has been designed to prevent that from happening.

## John Podesta to be Top US International Adviser on Climate Change

date: 2024-02-01, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON  — White House senior adviser John Podesta will add international climate policy to his job responsibilities, replacing special climate envoy John Kerry as the top U.S. official on international climate issues, the White House said Wednesday.


Kerry announced in mid-January that he would step down from the climate job to work on President Joe Biden's reelection campaign. Podesta will take over Kerry's responsibilities, though not his title, when he departs, likely this spring, the White House said.


Podesta was a behind-the-scenes veteran on climate in past Democratic administrations. He was brought back to the White House last year to put into place an ambitious U.S. climate program revived with the $375 billion approved in the 2022 climate law. He also led the administration's climate task force.


Kerry's job was created by the Biden administration specifically to fight climate change on the global stage. Kerry has been in the position since Biden took office in 2021.


Kerry's appointment did not require confirmation by the Senate, but a law passed in 2022 requires that special envoys reporting to the secretary of state will have to win Senate approval.


In a step that avoids a potential partisan fight in the Senate, Podesta was not named as climate envoy but rather a senior adviser to the president for international climate policy.


As outlined Wednesday by the White House, Podesta will continue to be involved in overseeing federal spending under the climate law, known as the Inflation Reduction Act, along with domestic climate priorities, adding the international portfolio that Kerry handled. The job will not require Senate confirmation.


White House Chief of Staff Jeff Zients said Kerry "has tirelessly trekked around the world'' to help confront the climate crisis, most recently at a U.N. climate conference in Dubai late last year.


"There is no one better than John Podesta to make sure" the U.S. continues to "meet the gravity of this moment," Zients said, calling Podesta "a fierce champion for bold climate action" who has served three Democratic presidents and has Biden's trust.


The Washington Post first reported Podesta's appointment.

## Installing pgloader from source

date: 2024-02-01, from: Robert's Ramblings

I'm working on macOS at the moment but I don't use Home Brew so the instructions to install pgloader are problematic for me. Except I know pgloader is a Lisp program and once upon a time I had three different Lisps running on a previous Mac.  So what follows is my modified instructions for bringing pgloader up on my current Mac Mini running macOS Sonoma 14.3 with Xcode already installed.

pgloader is written in common list but the instructions at https://pgloader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html specifically mention compiling with [SBCL](https://sbcl.org) which is one of the Lisps I've used in the past. But SBCL isn't (yet) installed on my machine and SBCL is usually compiled using SBCL but can be compiled using other common lists.  Enter [ECL](https://ecl.common-lisp.dev/), aka Embedded Common-Lisp. ECL compiles via a C compiler including the funky setup that macOS has. This means the prep for my machine should look something like

1. Compile then install ECL
2. Use ECL to compile SBCL
3. Install SBCL
4. Now that we have a working SBCL, follow the instructions to compile pgloader and install

NOTE: pgloader requires some specific configuration of SBCL when SBCL is compiled

This recipe is straight forward. ...
